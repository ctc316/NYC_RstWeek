5.0,4/26/2019,"I'm a huge fan of American Cut - have even had my own birthday dinner here before! The restaurant has the classic steakhouse look and feel, amazing food, and top notch service. The warm biscuits at the beginning of the meal are to die for. The oysters and shrimp cocktail were great starters for the table. I also always enjoy a few bites of a caesar salad from a steakhouse, and this did not disappoint. The steak has always been cooked perfectly when I've visited, with the option to add sauces on the side. The béarnaise sauce is incredible. The french fries are delicious, definitely worth ordering. And I believe they did a nice job cooking the vegetables. If you have room for dessert, definitely order something to share. My first time at American Cut, they even gave us complimentary warm cookies.I'm looking forward to the next time I dine here again!",0,0,0,Olivia G.,"New York, NY",0,16,15
3.0,4/21/2019,"Nice ambiance and service was top notch, very attentive.  The mini seafood tower is what we started out with, oysters were good, shrimp cocktail , the shrimp had been sitting around awhile in sauce, limp but still good.  The crabmeat could have had more lump, and the tuna tartare was ok.The boneless ribeye had good char and was well seasoned the special Mac and cheese was weak and watery.  Overall the experience was very good, it's elevated when I find parking right outside the place.  Would I come back. That's another question......",0,0,0,S. A.,"Manhattan, NY",1,104,2
5.0,3/28/2019,"Absolute perfection. Jan/Jon (forgot which way he spells his name) was the best server I've ever had in my entire life, which in itself was worth 5 stars. Everything from the decor to service, plating, and food quality was superb. We got the seafood tower to start with and the ceviche/sauce was literally like an orgasm in my mouth. So incredibly delicious and full of flavor, we were blown away with the first bite. The oysters were little mouthfuls of heaven and the chili lobster is a rich, delightful bowl of joy. My main course of the montauk tuna was so flawlessly cooked it just melted in my mouth. And just when we thought the meal couldn't get any better, we reached our climax with the cheesecake.... I mean Jesus Christ, I wasn't even in the mood for dessert after all that food but I couldn't stop treating my self with this pleasure.

When booking, I indicated online that reservation was for a special birthday and even reminded the staff when I called--However, the restaurant did nothing to make the night special.

5.0,3/22/2019,"I knew I loved this place from the moment I walked in.  Has a lovely vibe, really cool bar with seating for happy hour (good happy hour specials -- food and drink!) and a spectacular, large, but intimate feeling dining room to the left.  The lighting is dim and candle-lit, perfect for date night.  We started with the smoked Old Fashioned, which is presented table side.  The glass is pre-smoked, and the drink is poured over a large cube.  Big drink, lasted us the entire meal.  They started us off with the everything-spiced biscuit... most spectacular biscuit you've ever had.  We had a few apps before the Hanger Steak, all of which were great.  Highly recommend the tuna tar tar, the caesar salad (also chopped table side) and obviously the steak.  We didn't go for the t-bone, but got to watch the flambé process from a far, which was fun.  Go for their signature dessert - popcorn ice cream sounds weird, but you'll be pleasantly surprised.  Staff was wonderfully attentive, and chocolate mints are provided on the way out.  Can't wait to go back!",0,0,0,Mia R.,"Northport, NY",0,10,0

4.0,3/10/2019,"We came to American Cut for Valentines Day. Now, I know what you are thinking! Why are you going out on the day? Well, because everyone else does! Lol This restaurant is beautiful, elegant and romantic.  We came early and found comfortable seats at the bar and ordered a signature smoky old fashion cocktail. It was just delicious. Tbh you don't even realize you are drinking alcohol. It's in a beautiful glass with a large ice cube that continually cools your drink! It was perfect. It was finally our reservation time and we were seated promptly in the large room to the back. It's very pretty although a little loud. We ordered the hotel salad and the crab cocktail for an app. Both were delicious. It had great flavor. The crab was fresh and sweet. The salad was creamy and satisfying.We both ordered steak. I had the filet and ordered the Oscar on top.  Also, the pastrami ribeye. They were both cooked and seasoned perfectly.  For sides we ordered chef dans potatoes. They were interesting. Large pieces of bacon and crunchy potatoes.  The spinach was creamy but way over salted!  Lastly, we ordered the lobster Mac and cheese.  It came with truffles on top. Which I'm allergic too. We pushed it to the side and just ate the rest. We had seen a dessert walking in. We inquired and decided to order it. What a mistake! It was baked Alaska. It was super sweet. The liquor was overpowering. It was more eye candy and not palatable.Overall, American Cut is a great steakhouse. Staff here is very pleasant and accommodating.  There was some hit and misses with food but we def enjoyed our time here. We had a great time and you should def check it out!",4,1,7,Kim G.,"New York, NY",149,340,1077
2.0,3/10/2019,"Mediocre food; sub-par service. I ate at American Cut last night (Saturday) with the girlfriend. We arrived early for a 9:15 reservation and were not seated until 10:00. The hostess was nice enough to comp us a round of drinks, but this just shouldn't happen at a restaurant with a price point of $50 for a typical entree. We waited at the bar, which was full of other people waiting to he seated. The bar was only staffed with 2 bartenders, and they wouldn't serve you unless you waived them down. The drinks themselves were nothing special, and the first round was $45 for 2 drinks (with tip). One was only a Chivas 12-yr. (neat), which seemed like very little work for $20 or so.Once we were seated our waitress spent most of her time with a large party in a private room. She never asked how the food turned out, which should really happen anywhere you go. We felt a bit rushed through the appetizer phase. The customer copy of the receipt was placed on top of the bill, which was annoying since I signed it before noticing. We ordered the crab cocktail as an appetizer. It was gray and didn't taste very fresh. My girlfriend enjoyed the filet mignon. I ordered a 20oz bone-in ribeye, but it was 13oz at best. A little fat should be expected on a ribeye but the quality wasn't much better than what I've had at diners in Texas suburbs. The only positive vs. a diner ribeye was the seasoning, but it wasn't worth $61. We had mashed potatoes and spinach for sides, which were good.Generally I think you can get much better quality and service in Manhattan for the price point.",0,1,0,Nick R.,"Chicago, IL",0,6,0
3.0,3/1/2019,"Bring back the old pretzel recipe. I've been here many times for happy hour and the delicious Smokey old fashioned and the giant pretzel. Today I realized the pretzel has changed. It's more like a chewy twisted breadstick versus the previous delicious buttery pretzel. No good! I probably won't be ordering this pretzel anymore. Unfortunately, pretzels are one of my favorite snacks and used to tell everyone this place had one of my favorite pretzels every anywhere.

I went in here with higher expectations and maybe it's why I didn't find it great but I must admit, based off this one experience alone, there are other places in the city that do porterhouse better. Again, not saying it was bad, it was pretty good just not memorable. The place had nice decor and the service was very good so no complaints there.

3.0,2/3/2019,The service was subpar. The waiter was inattentive and had to flag them down to order more drinks and to check on food that was forgotten. The steak was ok but not as tender as other places I've been. The table side flambé is dramatic but didn't add much flavor to the steak. I had to ask for more salt.  The octopus appetizer was very seafoody tasting which made me feel it wasn't that fresh. The everything biscuit seems like a great idea but it was only ok.The decor and vibe was pretty modern but I feel like that is mostly what you are getting rather than a quality steak meal.,1,1,0,David N.,"Manhattan, NY",192,420,213

3.0,1/6/2019,"The restaurant has a very sophisticated look and feel, I love the leather paneling on the leather seats and I also liked the overall dark feel to the restaurant. As a whole, I thought the place itself was a nice place to have a steak, the service was excellent, I thought the staff was really top notch. Also, the tableside bread is a biscuit that they serve with a compound butter, this biscuit was insanely good.The food:OG 1924 Hotel Caesar- Parmigiano Reggiano, soft egg, Pullman crouton. I have to admit, this salad was excellent. The salad was perfectly dressed and I thought the flavor on it was delicious. Highly recommend. Grilled Bacon, Schaller & Weber, MF steak sauce, black onion. The bacon was 3 strips to an order and I thought the bacon was good, the bacon had this interesting glaze on it that added a nice sweetness.Octopus- Marcona almond romesco, celery salsa verde. The octopus was nice and tender, even though the octopus was tender, it didn't have a whole lot of flavor to it on it's own. I did think the romesco sauce was excellent, though and I loved how they left the marcona almonds in large chunks. Bone-in Ribeye- Bone marrow butter. This is why I gave this place a three star, the apps were nice but the bulk of my review will based on the steak since it is a steakhouse. First, the night we went, there was some kind of issue with the bone-in strip, it went from only having one left to not having any at all but the manager really did a great job remedying the situation. So the Bone in ribeye annoyed me, it was cooked OK but the steak had some really chewy parts but the thing that bothered me the most on the steak was the flavor. The steak had no flavor even for a dry aged piece of meat, the meat itself had very little flavor, it almost seemed the steak was not dry aged and not seasoned which was really odd. Also, the bone marrow butter offered little flavor to that bland steak.Chef Dan's Potatoes- Bacon, mushrooms. Chef Dan's potatoes was like a potato gratin but in the shape of a loaf. This was my fav side, I really liked the flavor on this and the texture of the potato was great.Fries- AC secret sauce. I thought the fries were good, they were nicely fried and not greasy at all. Fries are worth ordering. Potato Puree ""Robuchon""- local butter. I thought this was just OK, I didn't like the texture of the potato, they kinda just tasted like reg mash potatoes to me.Crackerjack Sundae- Caramel popcorn, peanut brittle, popcorn ice cream. I thought this was an OK desert, it was good but didn't leave much of an impression.",17,9,14,Ben L.,"Queens, NY",978,1001,2785

4.0,12/24/2018,"I had dinner recently at American Cut, and although I've been in this area of town for meals at a lot of nearby spots, I had never noticed the inauspicious front of this steakhouse before eating here. The entrance has low lighting and a bar for congregating at, with the dining room back and to the left. Even if you show up early and need to wait for your table to be ready, it's pretty easy to order a drink at the bar. While I did have some wine while I was here - it is a steakhouse after all - I have to say that I did enjoy the few cocktails that I mainly stuck with. The most memorable one was probably the planked negroni, which has a bit of a slightly savory smoky aroma that works really well to lightly temper the booze. Our servers were always present in getting our food and drinks out, and they also gave us good recommendations on what we should order.We started out with a number of appetizers to share, most of which came from the 3-level seafood tower that came out. It's pretty spectacular, and all of the food here was pretty good. I really liked the lobster and crab meat (no surprise there), and the oysters were solid as well. The only thing I would have passed on were the clams, just as it's hard to prepare them raw, and I didn't feel that they were all that distinctive. We also had a starter of lobster claws in a spicy, Cajun-like broth that was really delicious, although the lobster meat was just a hair overcooked. For the main, I went with the bone-in ribeye prepared medium (I am one of those who feels medium-rare on steak is a hit-or-miss proposition, even at a top-notch spot), flavor was absolutely spot-on, especially with the bone marrow butter providing even more richness to each bite. The only thing I was disappointed with - and perhaps inevitable with a bone-in order - was that there was more fat on the steak than I would have thought, even accounting for the meat not on the bone. The sides were typical steakhouse sides (creamy spinach, whipped potatoes), but they were all solid, with the potatoes being the right consistency to soak up all the juicy goodness from the steak.I'm not a big steak eater in general, but American Cut is a good choice if you're feeling particularly carnivorous. The ambiance is a good mix of the cosmopolitan with a hint of a throwback vibe, and the food and drink are both a cut above (pun intended). I'd enjoy coming back here, and it's worth a visit, even if you're not right in the Tribeca area.",1,1,1,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",371,1653,169
2.0,12/19/2018,"My first thought walking In was wow look at this upscale beautiful steakhouse, I was with a party of 16 people for appetizers we ordered the seafood tower, bacon, and octopus. The seafood tower was one of the worst I've ever had (and I've had over a hundred) the restaurant slipped everything in these little glass bowls and placed them in the tower and let me tell you for the price we paid it was horrible that the bowls were not even half way filled up it was a complete rip off, I'm not really a bacon lover but my husband is and he said it was delicious even though I personally felt it was over salted with whatever sauce they put on it, the octopus was delicious....for main we ordered the Japanese wagyu steak very pricey but an excellent cut. Now I have to get in to the cocktails and let me just say I am a drinker lol and I can taste the differences between vodkas that's how experienced I am and I can say that the drinks were horrible! Tasted awful even a simple drink as vodka tonic, light ice, with a splash of lime juice was made wrong. The cherry on top of the night for my group and I was when our waiter ran outside and told us that ""we are short cash"" it was rather embarrassing and degrading especially since other guests at the restaurant started to stare at us and some even laugh....we kindly asked the waiter to recount the cash he received when he did he came back and apologized but by that time the damage was done.

4.0,12/7/2018,"Came here last night for a birthday. This place was ok, which hurts me to say because I wanted it to be awesome. It's really 3 stars at BEST but I'm giving it 4 because our server Nick was cool and also because there were certain parts of the meal that were indeed very good. Walking in we were told coat check was full so we had to carry our jackets around inside, which immediately put us off. Then at the bar while waiting for a table I see the bartender using a spoon to fish out an ice cube from my wife's cocktail. Clearly she thought something had gotten into the drink. I waited to see if she was going to serve it to me and unfortunately I could tell she was. That is until she saw me looking at her. Then she threw that one out and made a new drink. Ambience was ok, it was a little noisier than I would have preferred. Oyster app was very good. Desserts were meh, but then again, we didn't get the crackerjack thing that everyone rants about, so that might have been a mistake.  I have to say I was disappointed with the ribeye with bone marrow butter. Cooked correctly - yes, but I'm guessing that the butter also contained garlic and chive or something like that because it had this distinct flavor that can best be described as akin to sour cream and onion dip. For me it overpowered the flavor of the meat. Here's the thing though, after scraping it off and trying the meat without it, I noticed the meat itself wasn't that flavorful.  Safe to say it wasn't the best steak I've ever had, and for what we paid, it should have been!

We were seated in the private room in the back at a gorgeous oval wood table and were able to share an intimate meal with 12 people. We were served fresh complimentary biscuits to start. Next, we ordered a few hot and cold towers for the table followed by wedge and Caesar salads. We then had several lamb chops which come as two double chops, salmon which was served over a delicious bed of quinoa and 2 tomahawk chops & 2 porterhouse chops. Sides included the Brussels sprouts, creamed spinach, French fries and potato puree. My personal favorites were the steaks which were perfectly seasoned and juicy in addition to the creamed spinach and the French fries which were super crispy and worth it! The steak is presented to the table by a chef who wheels in a pan and creates a fire to complete the dish table-side. My only complaint is that the service was a bit slow...

I wasn't sure whether I needed to dress fancy or casual, and it's a good thing I went somewhere in between. The restaurant is pretty noisy, and the tables are close together. Noisy isn't necessarily a bad thing, it just contributed to the casual vibes we were getting. The food started off with a bang. The everything biscuit and chive butter were better than expected and a nice way to kick off our meal. We also went with the mac and cheese of the day, which turned out to be a carbonara mac. This was a perfectly small portion of rich mac and cheese loaded with pancetta and topped with a fried egg. After the biscuit and the mac, we were really looking forward to our steak. We went with the bone-in dry aged rib eye. The rib eye was cooked a beautiful medium rare, and the dollop of bone-marrow butter on top made it a picture-worthy steak. Although the steak was undoubtedly high quality, the steak was severely under-seasoned. It had minimal flavor, which was the one disappointment of the night. The potato puree was spectacular, and the Brussels sprouts were also a nice side with dinner. As full as we were, we ended dinner with the crackerjack sundae. Wow, what an amazing dessert. The service was great unlike what some others have mentioned. Our water glasses were always full, and the main server was very friendly.",1,0,1,Sean W.,"Orange County, CA",11,138,132
3.0,10/9/2018,"A great looking place with chain restaurant service and above-average food at a high price. They did a good job on this place but it needs some major work. The steak isn't better than Wolfgang's and the service is borderline embarrassing. Where did they find these servers?With that being said, it's in a great location and the design it top notch. It's still somewhat early, so I hope to see this place get better.",1,1,1,Anthony M.,"Brooklyn, NY",160,146,1
5.0,10/2/2018,"Wow. I'm not a discerning steak person by any means but I would love to come here again. Before I start rambling about the food and how I hit a brick wall about halfway through because everything was so delicious but also super rich:- This place is absolutely massive. Great for birthday dinners where your group takes up an entire wall and for date nights. - It doesn't deviate from the standard steakhouse decor of dark wooden paneling and cherry leather booths and you'll likely need to read the menu by candle-light. - You're in Tribeca near the financial district. Expect lots of suits. Heck, you're probably a suit yourself. Now let's get to the good part: - The everything biscuits with veggie butter. If I could have eaten only this for the meal, I would have been a happy camper. - I have only recently figured out that ordering salmon on the rare side at a steakhouse is absolutely amazing. This melted like putty. - I tried fois gras for the first time! I think it was cooked very well but would I ever crave it? Probably not - plus I've watched too many documentaries of the poor goose with a tube down its throat. - I'm a firm believer that a good steakhouse will elevate the sides to the same level of glory as the beef. We went with the asparagus (which came with roasted hazelnuts), the mushroom grits (definitely order this), and the creamed spinach. The brick wall came out of nowhere. All of a sudden I was so stuffed that even drinking a sip of water seemed too formidable. The crackerjack sundae seemed intriguing at the very beginning of the meal but, as I felt like I perhaps needed to resort to crawling on all-fours to leave, we said no to dessert. And we had enough leftovers for a full meal. I think this place definitely reaches $$$ baller status.",7,2,6,Joy G.,"New York, NY",1203,824,173

1.0,9/30/2018,"Terrible on nearly all fronts. Avoid.We were a large party of 10. We were seated in a separate room, at a large table that could accommodate us. The table was nice and the room was not crowded. Amongst the few good qualities of the dinner.Service was bad from the start. They took a tremendous amount of time to take drink orders. More than 45 minutes passed by the time we had placed our food orders. The drinks took more than 25 minutes to come out after we had ordered them. They brought some biscuits which were cold, this would have been good if they let us eat them. But, they removed the biscuits and the bread plates about 15 minutes later, but the food didn't come for a long time after that.The worst part of the service was the waiters attitude. At some point he decided to remove a bunch of place settings. This in itself was reasonable since we were originally expecting a few more people who didn't show. But it was the settings that he chose to rove which was the problem. I had gotten up to speak to someone, and when I got back to my place my setting was gone. I brought this up, and was told that the settings were rearranged and that my setting was definitely there. I pointed out to him that remaining settings had wine in their glasses and that I had finished mine. I further pointed out that there was a womans purse on the chair that he said was mine. The level of callousness that he exhibited was completely unacceptable. The proper response should be to accommodate the customer. None of that here. In the end, we had to pull up another chair ourselves, and I ended up sharing a glass of water with my fiance the whole night, they couldn't even be bothered to correct their mistake later on.The food was mediocre and overpriced. I asked for a dry aged rib eye cooked black and blue. The temperature was spot on, but that's where the good news ended. The steak didn't taste dry aged. Niether of the two steaks that I tasted were seasoned properly. The foie gras that I ordered on the side was clearly grade B or lower. I had asked for two sauces with my steak, they were not delivered when the meat was. I brought this up and they brought out the house steak sauce, and made a big deal about not charging us for it. Finally the sauces that I asked for came out, but they were no good. The chimmichuri was bland, the au poivre was watery and sweet. Every dish that I tried was lacking in flavor, including the potato puree, the asparagus, mushrooms. Overall, it was the poor service and the high prices that left a bitter taste in my mouth. I would not recommend this place at all. I will not visit them again.",6,1,1,Timir D.,"New York, NY",158,231,269

The bread/scone/biscuit they served was heavenly! There was a restaurant week promo going on and the filet mignon was great, asked for medium well and it came well done but everyone was so friendly and nice I didn't feel like troubling them. Nonetheless it was one of the better well done steaks I had in my life.  The charr on the outside was great. My baby enjoyed the streak very much with his two teeth, a great way to celebrate him being 9 months out in this world! Back to the food, The steak accompliments were pretty interesting, hashbrows that we're deep fried with peppers and an amazing sauce + a rautetouille that hit the spot!The baked oysters were really really good, the freshest oysters with a thick decadent creamy sauce. So So Good!   The desserts were lovely, cracker jack sundae is something I will order again when I return.  All around good food, great ambience, super wonderful service, high price tag but without all that pretentiousness of certain steak houses in the fidi. Our family loves steaks and we found a new place go to place for special occasions! They were really accomadating to my baby, which was much appreciated. I know, who brings a baby to a steakhouse!

1.0,8/10/2018,"I do not write Yelp reviews often, but I was so dissatisfied with the service at this restaurant that I had to share my experience and warn others. I visited this restaurant during Restaurant Week with my co-workers. We had a reservation, so they sat us down pretty quickly. The orders were placed and appetizers were brought fairly quickly as well. However, after this things went downhill. It took them over 15 minutes to bring us wine samples, and another 10-15 minutes to actually pour wine in glasses. This was nothing though for what was about to come next.When they brought the main course, I could not believe my eyes. At first I thought that it was a mistake and they've brought us another appetizer, but boy was I wrong: it was indeed the main course. I cannot tell you the exact weight of this piece of ""steak"", but it was no more than 3 ounces, 4 at best. It looked like the cook took a regular steak portion, cut it in 4 pieces, and served to 4 people. One of my co-workers ate his piece of steak in literally 2-3 bites and asked the waiter when the main course is coming. When he learned that this was the main course, he mumbled under his breath that the weight of his feces is heavier than this ""main course"". He was probably correct in that assessment.Regarding the actual steak: I am by no means a steakhouse expert, but even from my limited experience I will say that the quality of the steak very not good at all; it was either not cooked well or overcooked. We had to ask for steak sauce to make it taste better.We were done with wine, appetizer, main dish and desert in less than an hour, which shows you how how small the portions were, and quickly departed. Needless to say that we will not be coming back. If you are reading this review, I strongly suggest taking your money to a real steakhouse with real portions, such as Delmonico's or Marc Joseph steakhouse, you will get a much better service for your money.Note to this restaurant's owners: if you are going to be so cheap with portions during restaurant week, guess what: don't participate in the restaurant week! You've now lost potential clients that will now never come back to your establishment based on the poor service that was provided.",3,0,0,Michael S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,5,0
4.0,8/6/2018,"My boyfriend and I decided to try out restaurant week this past Friday night. I will say the ambiance and food tasted great for the most part and our waiter was extremely knowledgeable and pleasant. The main issue here was the speed in which they rush you through your meal--we were already on our main course by the time our drinks came. The waiter graciously told us that they were free of charge, but the point is-we were barely able to finish our drinks by the time dessert arrived. The entire 3 course meal was probably a little over an hour which is kind of absurd to me, it felt like a sprint of a meal rather than the slower pace you'd want at a nice restaurant. I got the ravioli and my boyfriend got the yellowtail as appetizers which were both great. Our filet was delicious but slightly under seasoned. The Cracker Jack Sunday was even better once it melted a little! Probably my favorite thing we ate the entire meal were the everything biscuits, hot and buttery. I would probably come back here and give it another shot, but I hated the feeling like we were being pushed out.",0,0,0,Felicia W.,"New York, NY",439,6,28

It was a business dinner.  No one mentioned as we walked in, or notified us via OpenTable or phone that the a/c was broken.  We had to ask and their response was a French shrug. The manager said there was nothing they could do -- a gracious manager would have at least offered something while we sweated with our meat (which was fine) -- a bottle of wine? A discount? Some acknowledgement?  In addition beware that they bring more than you ask without checking first - we ordered 3 appetizers and they brought (and charged) 6.  With so many well managed restaurants in NYC - we will pick another next time.",0,0,0,L S.,"New York, NY",0,24,0
3.0,7/27/2018,"We went to this steakhouse and sat in the bar area. You are able to order from the full menu at one of the bar tables, and that was sufficient for us. The complimentary bread is quite tasty. I am not a bread person but I could easily eat that bread all evening. The food we ordered was not terrible. There are three things that made this experience a three star:1. The air conditioner was broken. There was no sign on the door to notify patrons that there was no air conditioning. We did not notice immediately but a few minutes in I noticed it was unusually warm. I then heard the patrons sitting next to me complaining about the temperature to the point where they were ready to leave. Every now and again you felt a slight breeze of cool air to keep you hopeful that there was more coming...but the more just never came.2. Our drinks were weak. If you are looking for an experience with strong and unique cocktails, this isn't the place to go.  We tried different cocktails and none of them hit the spot.3. The filet mignon was drier than I would have liked. That was disappointing.  However, the scallops were tasty and the butternut squash was delicious.Overall, it was not a terrible experience.

4.0,7/26/2018,"I have to preface this by saying that I usually only go to steakhouses when they're paid for during a business dinner. I've been to Peter Lugers, Wolfgang's, Quality Meats, Club A Steakhouse, and Minetta Tavern. If I'm speaking frankly, I have to say that when you're getting that top quality dry aged steak, the minute difference between these top places really tend to escape me. They're all fantastic steakhouses with meat that you will dream of long after you've left their doors, but I'm just not that discriminating a taster to immediately notice the difference.That being said, American cut certainly ranks up there with the best of them in terms of meat quality.Our night started off with a drink at the bar as I was waiting for my date. It was happy hour and I gladly ordered up a Smokey old fashioned for what I thought was the bargain price of $10. It turns out that this cocktail was premixed and was horribly butchered. There was so much bitters in the drink that I could quite literally feel my chest hair growing.For dinner, we ordered the New York strip steak, some sort of fish tartare (I forget the name of the fish), mashed potatoes, and their Cracker Jack sundae to finish.They brought out these amazing layered biscuits with everything bagel seasoning to start off our meal. These were unbelievably addictive and I struggled to keep myself in check before the actual food arrived.The meat was perfectly cooked to a medium rare and was every bit as good as any other top steakhouse in NYC. The fish tartare was very refreshing with a tangy sauce. It didn't taste THAT different from tuna tartare but as I said before, I'm also not the kind of guy who would notice these small details.The mashed potatoes were super creamy and almost stretchy, like cheese. There must have been so much butter and cheese in there for it to take on that entirely unpotato consistency. It was delicious but very rich.The Cracker Jack Sundae was as good as it sounds. There's really nothing to explain about this one. It's ice cream with cracker jacks on it. What more do you want?We also ordered up a bottle of red wine that wasn't bad and also didn't break the bank (under $60). I don't know much about wine so I can't comment on this, nor do I even remember the name of the bottle.The service was very attentive but not intrusive. Our waiter was very lively and knowledgeable about the menu.The decor is modern and upscale. Great place to flaunt your money if you're looking to impress someone.Overall, we spent about $200-300 here for dinner on one HH cocktail, one app, one entree, one dessert, and a bottle of wine.

My sister and I sat at the bar for some time waiting; happy hour was 2 thumbs up and my sister said it was the best old fashioned she's ever had. I ordered the yellowtail crudo, filet mignon with Mickey D's hashbrowns and Cracker Jack sundae.  Crudo was so good! but the other option, ravioli, may have been better? Really depends on what you're feeling that night! As I mentioned, steak came just a touch overcooked but was delicious and I would absolutely come back for more steak. I think I'd order the ratatouille side next time though ! We sat upstairs, and it was a little dim and loud, but regardless, I enjoyed the atmosphere. On our visit, it was predominantly an after work crowd.

In fact t the appys were pricier than the entrees imo. I had the beef short ribs and they were amazing. Served in a metal crock pot they were tender, tasty and a nice portion. Others seemed to like their entrees too and they were appealing to the eye. The mashed were extra watery - didn't like them.Overall, An expensive meal like most NYC steakhouses. NOTE: unfortunately I left my credit card at the bar where I bought 1 beer while waiting for my group. I called the following morning and they had my card and the Manager, Amil, said it was in the safe but he couldn't send it to me.

1.0,6/24/2018,"Wish I could recommend this place, because the food is quite good.  Unfortunately our experience was mostly ruined by the service.We had a table for 12 people for a bachelor party dinner.  Due to travel issues, 6 of the people were not able to make it.  We had a $1,500 minimum spend and when we asked if there was anything they could do to lower it, the manager was insistent that we were stuck with the total spend, which equated to $320 per person.Then when we are seated, the service staff push fancy water bottles on us.  After the first 2, I ask if they can only give us tap water going forward.  When the bill came, I was shocked to see they charged us for 6 water bottles for a total of $60.  When you are dropping over $2,400 on a dinner for 6 people, it is disappointing to see the restaurant try to nickel and dime you for something as trivial and universal as water.Then the general manager comes over to suggest a wine. We ask for the sommollier and the general manager reacts defensively and says he is certified and that the somm would be by later.  We felt like the staff tried to push a specific wine on us instead of presenting multiple options.  The bachelor whose upcoming wedding we were celebrating tastes the wine and doesn't say anything for a long time (he didn't like it).  Usually this would be a prompt to offer alternatives, but the staff did not do so.  Pretty surprising for a $200 bottle of wine.When we were putting in orders, we originally just wanted to order the appetizers and order the entrees later to space it out, but the waiter pressured us to order entrees as well.  We made it clear that we wanted to have time to savor the appetizers and the waiter said he would space it out.  Then, when we were halfway through the appetizers, the wait staff tried to pressure us to take the appetizers and told us the steaks were coming out momentarily.  The waiter said he would take care of it, but when the steaks came out they had clearly been kept under a heat lamp.  Again, when you are paying over $400 a person, you want to have the steaks fresh off the grill (I can taste the difference) and not have to feel rushed.They did throw in a key lime pie on the house, but when we are dropping $400 a person, that seemed like a small gesture.Overall the food was good and the ambience is great, but this experience was spoiled by the service.   I would expect more at this price point and I would recommend that NY's upper crust look elsewhere.",1,1,0,David L.,"West Village, Manhattan, NY",15,45,0

1.0,3/27/2018,"CELIAC DISEASE/GLUTEN-INTOLERANT BEWARE - this is my personal story from March 2018.  Simply, I was food poisoned here.  I have celiac disease and notified the manager and waiter.  They told me what I should order - and I got horribly ill.  Not a little bit (which is what might happen if a small mistake happens) but a very bad food poisoning where I had severe stomach aches, headaches, trouble sleeping for 3 days later.  If you have a gluten allergy, celiacs, or a severe intolerance, do not go here.  The customer service is horrible too.  It's one thing to make a mistake, get your customer sick, and then try to fix it by refunding the meal.  It's another thing to waste the customer's time, and actually be rude by belittling the customer's concerns.  I spoke with their Director of Hospitality, and he provided zero hospitality. In fact, he told me that I could not have gotten sick there because everything I ate was gluten-free because his girlfriend allegedly has a gluten intolerance and she's fine with eating it.  That's not professional in my opinion, it does not matter what experiences his girlfriend had.  He also told me I must have gotten sick by eating something before, but not at his restaurant.  That is again, insulting. Not an offer to fix anything - they just told me I should come back to the restaurant (to spend $300 to possibly get sick again).  I asked the Director why he bothered to reach out to me if he had nothing to offer, to fix the problem - instead, he just wanted to challenge the customer. So, that's my story.  I believe that a classy place that charges $150 a person on average should be both more careful with allergies (not just talk)... and in the event of a mistake, be very hospitable (because mistakes happen, this is the most important part of all of this).",0,1,0,Bernardo F.,"Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn, NY",0,17,0

Great char, nice lean cut of meat, cooked pretty precisely.* Caesar salad was surprisingly killer. They chopped the house-made croutons and eggs right at the table.* Waiter and sommelier were solid. Responsive and friendly.Cons:* Felt like overall a lot of the sides -- especially the bread -- went way heavy on the salt* Few minor glitches -- they ran out of the size fillet I wanted, they switched our orders, got a 2 oysters with almost no meat in them. Nothing super bad but it wouldn't happen at an ultra high-end place.Overall:The steak, which is what this place is all about, is among the best. For the price, you could eat at a Michelin-starred restaurant which would really get all of these details perfect.I'm not sure it stacks up to other restaurants in its price range in terms of experience / precision / creativity, but if you think of it as a premium version of say The Capital Grille, it makes sense.Overall would recommend.",0,0,0,Aaron G.,"New York, NY",70,68,2

My husband order the New York steak which he acclaimed and I the salmon. We shred the spinach and carrots and he also ordered the potato grait something (I forgot what it was called) all the sides were tasty as well as our meat. The only thing I must say is the seating itself wasn't uncomfortable but I had on 6 in Loubs and I couldn't comfortable place my feet anywhere. My heels ended up getting partially stuck under the table in attempt to comfortably rest my feet.

It's a buttery ""everything"" biscuit with a vegetable spread (think everything bagel with vegetable cream cheese). Each layer of the biscuit flakes off into a crispy but bread-y morsel.

The fresh oysters were amazing with beautiful presentation and delicious sauces to accompany. We also had the house salad, which looked fairly plain on the menu. However, the salad was delicious and crafted to perfection with olives, artichoke hearts, feta and green tomatoes. We also ordered the Kampachi Tartare which was out of this world. I do not even know how to describe this wonderful dish. The restaurant was running some specials for Valentine's Day, so we tried the Truffle Mac and Cheese (homemade pasta) with the Potato Puree and Sausage and Peppers. The Sausage dish was VERY spicy but in a very pleasant and delicious way. Our steaks were cooked to perfection and exactly as ordered.

So, on a rainy Wednesday, I ventured here, accompanied by my aunt and cousin.I arrived here and it was relatively empty, as they open at 5, that was to be expected. The hostess was courteous, as was the lady at coat check. The manager, or who I believe was the manager, mentioned I could sit at the table across from the bar, or at the bar, as I awaited the rest of my party.Fast forward to the eating portion, the waiter was nice, he seemed a little pushy in regards to making a choice for our drinks/dinner. The drinks came out rather quickly, I went with one of their specialty drinks, and I didn't care for it too much. Food wise, I went with the Filet, which was cooked to perfection, was extremely tender, but lacked flavor-- the same could be said for the mashed potatoes. I did enjoy my Caesar salad and my dessert, but was bummed that my main course was sub par. My family members enjoyed their meal, my aunt was critical of how their desert was presented, as my cousin is a baker, but I saw no issues with it:Overall, this place is about a 3.5: perfect for a date with the intimate lighting, but it's a little loud here, the tables are a little too close together, and it seemingly gets jam packed after 7.Although I was underwhelmed with my experience-- I would give this place another shot in the future.",1,0,0,Jason R.,"Brooklyn, NY",400,480,1763
3.0,2/12/2018,"Average steakhouse in a city that has a plethora of great ones. Tight seating which I am not used to at a steakhouse. So much so we had to move our chairs every time they walked by with a cart. Prices are ridiculously high. Wine is jacked up (we got the cheapest bottle and it was still over $80). Steaks are $50-100 a pop. The bread they bring out to start is excellent...so much so I stole my buddy's piece. Steak was good but not great. It was cooked exactly as stated. If you order a particular drink they perform this tableside show which in the 2 we witnessed, both times they failed in doing so (smoking up a glass...). Portion sizes on sides are definitely on the smaller side. Table of 8 split 5...wasn't enough. The Dry Aged Potatoes w/Bacon and mushrooms was the best of the bunch.

We went on a Monday night which tends to be ""slower"" night but it was anything but slow there. The ambiance was great, not too loud, and overall a good vibe.For food, we had a choice of 3 apps, 3 main courses, 2 sides and 3 desserts. Also noted, they had a number of wine specials (by the bottle) which we took advantage of as well. We started out with the most amazing bread with even more amazing butter. That was dangerous. I got the ceasar salad as my first course and it was pretty typical. My friend got pork belly which was VERY tasty (and I'm not a huge pork belly fan). For the main course, most of us got the filet, which was great. A hearty piece, cooked to order and quite tasty.  We shared the sides (kale and mashed potatoes) both of which were good although the portions were a little small. For dessert, we shared the bread pudding, cracker jack sundae and sorbet. None of us liked the sorbet (it was way to savory for dessert) the other desserts were unmemorable.

3.0,1/31/2018,"TLDR: top-notch service; swanky, ""boy's club"" feel; delicious complimentary bread; free prosecco if you check-in on yelp; disappointing steakCame here with a friend on a Wednesday night around 9:45pm (15 minutes before closing). Despite this, they were more than happy to seat us at the bar and at no point did we feel rushed throughout our 1.5 hour meal. This restaurant had a luxurious ""boy's club"" feel with dark wood tables, large leather seats, brick walls, and dim lighting. It seemed like the type of place Mike and Harvey from Suits would go to after winning a big case.We were going to order red wine to pair with our steak, but discovered the free prosecco offer after checking in on yelp, so went with that. I was surprised that a $$$$ restaurant would have a free check-in offer like this, but when we asked about it, the bartender / server was happy to honor it. For food, we decided to share the carrot glazed carrot (yes, this is what it's called), brussel sprouts, and NY strip with a side of chimichurri sauce.While we were waiting, we were served complimentary bread, which consisted of enormous garlic popovers with a side of garlic and chive butter. I feel bad saying this, but the bread was my favorite part of the meal. The popovers had a great garlic flavor and the flaky texture was complemented well by the smooth, slightly sweet butter.The glazed carrot and brussel sprouts came next and were pretty good. The carrot was cooked perfectly and had a sweet glaze while the brussel sprouts were unique in that they were mixed with other vegetables and had a pickled taste. Given that this place is a steak house, I was really looking forward to the NY strip, but unfortunately was pretty disappointed. With a $60 price tag, I was expecting top-notch, but the supposedly medium rare steak was tough, dry, and bland. While the chimichurri sauce helped a bit, it was far from the tender, juicy steak I was expecting. To be honest, I've had better steak at fast casual chains like Outback Steakhouse, which is much more affordable.While the steak was disappointing and perhaps a one-time fluke, I did enjoy the bread, appetizers, and service.

Unfortunately I was the straggler because the trains had all the delays (probably my fault for trusting the MTA) so I called the restaurant to let them know I would be a little bit late and to apologize. Thankfully, they allowed someone from my party to check in for the group, but said that it was their policy that we would lose our reservation if I was more than 15 minutes late. OK - challenge accepted! I had a herniated disc in my back, but I basically sprinted to the restaurant and got there at 7:38. Not bad, I was proud (injured back aside). I saw my party waiting for me, and booked it to the hostess stand where they told me that our table was safe (yay!) but that there would be a bit of a wait for us to be seated. OK, no problem - we thought about going to the bar but it was packed, so we decided to stand in the foyer near the coat check and wait for our table.10 minutes go by... no table. No worries, I was a little late, so I apologized to the group and told them I would buy everyone dessert, figuring it was my fault.20 minutes go by... no table. At this point my back is killing me, so I made my way to the hostess stand and asked about our table. She kindly informed me that they were still waiting on tables to finish desserts and drinks - can't really blame them, it's not like the restaurant staff can physically remove lingerers from their table. I asked if there was anywhere I could sit (bar was packed) - my back was a mess. Thankfully, they had these short little tables by the bar that were apparently bar seating, so they offered to let us wait at those tables and bought us a round of drinks - awesome! We sat at the teeny tiny bar table and had our round of drinks (drinks were delightful - I got the prickly pear cocktail and it was fantastic) and figured it wouldn't be long now....Fast forward 40 minutes. We had been waiting for a little over an hour at this point and our cocktail waitress checked in with the hostess on our dinner table for us. She said it'd be a little while longer - people were still finishing desserts and drinks. However, she said she could serve us dinner at our bar table. Now, this table was not at all conducive to eating steak (it was incredibly low... it was around knee level, and definitely a lounge type table for resting drinks), but we figured... what the heck, we're starving and everything smells delicious.I had the pork belly BLT (like a deconstructed BLT - it was amazing) and the filet (cooked to perfection) with smashed potatoes. One of our group had the MFC chicken (which was a super crispy fried chicken that tasted great - tiny bit of spice, definite hint of serrano, and a touch of maple syrup), and someone ordered the lobster bisque (also excellent). Our waitress was AWESOME and kind enough to comp us some brussels sprouts and a twice baked potato. We had a couple bottles of wine for the table as well, and the sommelier was also awesome (very knowledgeable and very animated). Dessert was fantastic - the cracker jack sundae is INCREDIBLE.So, all in all, awesome food, excellent service, but REALLY poor management took a 5 star meal to a 3 star meal.I probably won't be going back any time soon - though the food is great, I just cant stomach paying good money for poor management.",0,0,0,Ivan P.,"New York, NY",0,3,0

5.0,12/18/2017,"5 stars because the 30 day dry-aged bone-in ribeye is the BEST piece of steak I've ever eaten. So tender, juicy and charred to perfection ($59, 20 oz with bone marrow butter). The service was top-notch and the decor of the steakhouse is classy, modern and romantic. Not your typical old-school steakhouse. Dressy attire is definitely recommended. For appetizers, I recommend trying the Diamond Jim Brady baked oysters and the Cornflake Crab Cake - both were unique and excellent. I only had the Brussels sprouts as a side, while delicious, it was a pretty small portion for $14.",2,1,2,Kara Y.,"New York, NY",20,90,220
1.0,12/15/2017,"Well where to start.  We were a holiday party of 15, I made the reservation for 14 and we had an extra person at the very last minute. Upon arriving I informed the manager we had an extra person and by his reaction I thought he was not going to seat him. It took at least 20 minutes to locate an extra chair. While this Kaos was happening most of the party was standing unsure if we could stay. Finally we sat and waited another 20 minutes to get our first drink order placed. The entire night they were slow with drinks. Finally after being there more than an hour they took food orders. We watched as the private room who arrived an hour or more after we did began to receive their food orders. We ordered 3 $110.00 seafood towers. It included 1 very small lobster tail cut up, 3 small shrimp a few clams and oysters. It was a joke! On the positive size after waiting 3 hours from the time we arrived the main course was served. My Filet was good and the bacon appetizer was good. To sum up we had an issue getting seated, waited almost an hour for our first drink, 2 hours to receive our appetizers and another hour for the main course while another party was served long after we arrived. Not evan an apology for the wait or issues. Our bill was $3000.00 with tip. I set up a NYC steak house diner for this group every year for the last 10 and the lack of attention, ridiculous seafood platter (could have been put together for 20 bucks at Shop-rite) and just being ignored is why they received this rating.

For $21, there was hardly any bone marrow... D:-Octopus Appetizer - I enjoyed this. Very tender pieces and a good amount of ocotopus. -Bone In Rib Steak with bone marrow butter - Clearly you can see my obsession with all things butter. i didn't really think the bone marrow butter did anything for this dish. The steak was also a little under medium rare. -I also had two sides with the steak - spinach and dry aged potato. The spinach was very salty.

4.0,12/5/2017,"So this is now my 4th American Cut that I've been to (AC, Englewood Cliffs, Midtown and Tribeca) and this one is better than the Midtown location. My boyfriend and I went for dinner 2 nights ago and had a good time, but of course there were a couple of mishaps. We were seated in a corner booth which was perfect but it took a solid 10 minutes to get menus. After receiving menus, we had to sit through a 5 minutes presentation from the waiter which I thought it was strange when we had already told him that we'd been to another American Cut which probably means we know what we want. Whatever. We didn't get any of the items he wasted his time babbling about. I wanted to get oysters that night but I was so turned off from the oysters I had at the midtown location a couple months ago (I have a review) that I couldn't bring myself too. So I settled with the clams on the half shell which were PERFECT. I ordered the hangar steak with the Carrot glazed carrot, which was delicious for what it was. The service was ok. The waiter was simply too talkative. As a server myself, I know that being personable with your customers is everything, but having full blown conversations with every table and ignoring others, just isn't good business. My boyfriend had a dessert which he said was good and a cappuccino. Our bill came to $150 for 6 clams, 2 hangars, 2 sides, 2 sauces, a dessert and a coffee. It's not terrible but more than I wanted to spend on 2 hangar steaks, we didn't even have filets or wine or anything. But regardless, it was a good dinner. Definitely will be back.

I guess people watch tv and have heard of the chef, so they come here for a ""big NYC meal."" wrong!!!!My ribeye was over charred and burnt. BF went with porterhouse. How do you screw up a porterhouse??? Well, they managed to so. Service was meh. Biscuits were best part of the meal. A few of the sides were cold. Should have stopped with the biscuits and cut our losses. Out of town cousin was disappointed. Thought he was going to get a great NY steak. Next time, I pick the place, Tommy!

4.0,10/27/2017,"A little late, but I came here for restaurant week with a friend in hopes of getting one of those ridiculous funnel cake ice cream sandwiches I saw on Instagram. We came on a Wednesday evening at 6pm and it was nearly empty. The restaurant is huge and very dim, like most steakhouses, but well appointed. First big pro, the waiter was really nice to us, even though we were there for restaurant week, which is not always the case. He wasn't even visibly annoyed when we used the Yelp check-in for free prosecco (why not? ¯_(ツ)_/¯).On to the food. I could've eaten 10 of the warm everything biscuits they brought. So delicious! My friend and I both had the filet. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars rather than 5 is that I was really underwhelmed by my steak. It was ok, but expected more from a steakhouse. The waffle fries with beer cheese were good. For dessert, we tried the cracker jack sundae, the chocolate bread pudding, and of course we ordered an extra funnel cake ice cream sandwich for the table because that's the reason we came. Yes, we ate three desserts... I thought the sundae was too sweet, but my friend really liked it. I think popcorn flavored ice cream may be hit or miss for some.

4.0,9/25/2017,"this has all the makings to be the best steakhouse in nyc, however, it is not there just yet. First off, we had to wait 45 min for our reservation. Seemed like they were backed up all night bc the bar was filled with people waiting for their reservation. They did buy us a round of drinks which was nice.  I ordered my drink of choice which is the old fashioned and was not happy with it. Not the right balance of flavors... not a good start. Once we were sat in the dining room we noticed it was unusually loud. I know steakhouses can be loud and that is standard but this was middle school cafeteria loud. Now for the food...The bread they bring out at the beginning of the meal is phenomenal. It is like a cross between bread and a biscuit. This was the best complimentary bread I ever had. For appetizers, started with the steak knife wedge salad, the shirmp cocktail, and they brought out complimentary lobster and octopus appetizer. All very good. My favorite was the wedge salad. Very well balanced with just the right amount of ingredients to dressing.For main courses, we had ordered the real wagyu and the other oregon wagyu type steak. The real wagyu was by far better so if you are going to go big I would order it. It was juicy and although a tad fatty it melted in our mouths. For side dishes nothing really wow-ed me. The mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts werent great. I wouldnt order them again. The cauliflower was pretty good though.Aside from the wait, this place was pretty good. The food overall was delicious and the service was also top notch. We enjoyed our experience and with some fine tuning could be one of the best.",6,2,5,Nicholas G.,"Hoboken, NJ",4367,1076,2695

The rest of my party arrived there was 6 of us had a few more drinks at the bar again the bartender her service was impeccable. I will say one negative thing I asked the hostess a question there were two Hostess there one was African-American and one was a tall white woman with a red blouse that was way too tight not in a good way it was a cheap polyester that did not compliment  her body, her attitude was not good ,when I asked her a question and really not smiling at all as I remember walking in. Other than that situation everything was wonderful. we sat at a booth in the back of the restaurant which was so comfortable our waiter came over to the table his name was Todd so pleasant again another very attentive staff member so much knowledge of the menu he was a real pleasure. The staff there attended to every need I did not have to ask for water I dropped my knife I think before it hit the ground someone was coming with a new knife I kid you not. Also met another waiter named Anthony absolutely gorgeous and the personality was again impeccable. Our food arrived cooked to perfection . I don't know who trained the staff there but they did an incredible job just really need to get a new hostess when you walk into a restaurant that prestigious you really need someone attractive and with a smile and not attitude as I said  the African-American absolutely Pleasant. I actually told the host that she needs to have a drink and loosen up a little bit I had to. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone I'm actually thinking about planning a recital dinner of 40 people there.

We came here on a Friday night (last day of RW so I'm not too helpful in that department) and there was an hour and a half wait for a table in the dining area so we opted to sit at the tables in the bar area. I did get a peak at the downstairs as well as the dining area and it is quite swanky. Even though we weren't in the proper dining room, service was still very good. The staff was very welcoming despite not having a reservation and sitting in the bar area. Our server was attentive and very sweet. As far as the food goes, the meal was exactly as described by other Yelpers who came for Restaurant Week. Fantastic steak, amazing everything biscuits w/ garden vegetable butter, very good Caesar salad and chilled lobster soup, pretty good green beans and bad beer cheese and fries. Based on previous reviews, everything was what we anticipated it to be. Despite the mediocre sides that came with the filet, it was still a very good meal. For drinks, I had a Titos martini and my boyfriend had two Old Fashions. My drink was $18 and his were $17 each. A bit overpriced for Titos in my opinion but still good nonetheless.

4.0,8/16/2017,"We came here for the first time to try their Restaurant Week menu.  We were asked to wait for about 20 or 30 minutes past our reservation time in their lounge, but I had read that in their Yelp reviews, so I already kind of expected it.  What was somewhat unfortunate, though, was that although I had specifically requested a booth seat in my reservation, even after being made to wait, without saying anything, they gave us a regular 2 seat table that was squeezed in the middle of a row of tables that were uncomfortably close to each other.  You know when you feel like you're infringing on the conversations of the people next to you?  And you're all awkwardly side-eyeing each other's food?  On both the right AND the left?  Yeah.  We could've asked to get a new table, but we didn't want to wait anymore.  But ultimately, the reason why I give American Cut 4 stars instead of 5 is because our service was incredibly slow, despite the fact that it seemed like there were a number of empty tables in the downstairs area where we were.  It took a crazy long time for our waitress to come back to us for our order, for each course, and finally for the bill.In terms of food, we both started with the chilled lobster soup, then had the filet mignon for entree and split both the waffle fries and green beans, then ended with their famous crackerjack sundae.  We also added the steak tartare as an additional appetizer.Everything biscuits: Their complementary starter was fantastic and definitely lived up to the rave Yelp reviews.  It was exactly like you would imagine: everything bagel in biscuit form.  The vegetable spread was also insanely addicting.Steak tartare: Very well done and interesting with the light, crispy fried filo dough (maybe?) on top.  It had an acidic note to it that was just a little too strong for me, but overall, we were really happy with it.  I should note, though, that if you want a picture, you should take it fast, because the waiter immediately smashed the egg and toppings into the tartare for us, which was nice, but we didn't really have long to admire it or take any photos.Chilled lobster soup: The soup was perfectly done and included some impressively large chunks of lobster.  I am normally not a huge fan of chilled soups, but I had absolutely no complaints about this one.Filet mignon: The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare, which is a feat in itself, and I was blown away by the chimichurri sauce on top.  Everything about this was exactly how it should be and really celebrated the flavor of the meat rather than covering it up.Waffle fries with beer cheese: We had high hopes for this veritable calorie splurge, but unfortunately the whole thing was way too salty, and we ended up not eating it.Green beans: The beans were nicely cooked, not too mushy, and it had good flavor, but ultimately not anything to write home about.  If you're not doing their set menu, I would opt for a different side.Crackerjack sundae: They were nice enough to accommodate my peanut allergy and take off the peanut brittle.  It was really tasty, if a little sweet, but what do you expect from a sundae?  I also told them that we were celebrating my fiance's birthday, and they upgraded his sundae to the ""full size"" and even gave us a small cake with a candle.  I was impressed by their thoughtfulness with this one.",5,1,4,Christy T.,"Honolulu, HI",213,98,161

5.0,8/12/2017,"My husband took me to American Cut last Thursday for date night. We were drawn in by the fond memory of the tomahawk, but were tempted by the restaurant week menu and unbeatable deal. We started by sharing a bottle of the Cabernet Sauvignon from the restaurant week menu that was a great price point and just what we look for. Dry and oaky, with a hint of dark berry that went great with our steaks. I chose the lobster soup to start, good but missing a wow factor. The filet minon cut like butter and melted in your mouth. Amazingly seasoned, and definitely doesn't require the house made steak sauce but tried it anyway and was not disappointed. My husband also enjoyed the filet minon, so we shared our sides. The green beans were pleasantly crunchy with a hint of vinegar and salt. The truffle cheese waffle fries were fatty and delicious. A little salty spice on top, with creamy melty truffle cheese underneath. To follow our meals we shared the peach mint sorbet and the chocolate bread pudding. The desserts paired well together, but as a stand alone item go for the sorbet. It was refreshing, tangy and an excellent pallet cleanser. The best part of our dining experience this time around though, was our waiter Anthony. His service was impeccable. Our wine glasses were always full, and he checked on us throughout each course. Then going above and beyond he even helped pull the table from the booth for me to exit with ease. (Not an easy task with a tiny space between tables and 5inch heels, am I right ladies?!)

The exterior is unassuming but I love that the interior is dark and bold but classic - definitely a great spot for dates but honestly for any occasion in my opinion. Service was the best and definitely met the general standard expected at nice restaurants of this caliber. The filet mignon was divine, their green bean side could be skipped, and the chocolate bread pudding was great, especially with the candied nuts. The beer cheese fries were pretty standard but obviously good for satisfying a craving of either fries or beer cheese. Was very impressed by the pork belly dish. Overall I loved the experience though and would definitely come back for a nice meal.",0,0,0,Michelle W.,"New York, NY",25,140,176
5.0,8/8/2017,"I took my wife to American Cut last Thursday for date night. We were drawn in by the fond memory of the tomahawk, but were tempted by the restaurant week menu and unbeatable deal. We started by sharing a bottle of the Cabernet Sauvignon from the restaurant week menu that was a great price point and just what we look for. Dry and oaky, with a hint of dark berry that went great with our steaks. I chose the pork belly with the filet minon, and truffle cheese waffle fries. The filet minon cut like butter and melted in your mouth. Amazingly seasoned, and definitely doesn't require the house made steak sauce but tried it anyway and was not disappointed. My wife ordered the lobster soup, good but missing a wow factor. She Also enjoyed the filet minon, so we shared green beans  which were Pleasantly crunchy with a hint of acid and salt. the truffle cheese waffle fries were fatty and delicious. A little salty spice on top, with creamy melty truffle cheese underneath. To follow our meals we shared the peach mint sorbet and the chocolate bread pudding. The desserts paired well together, but as a stand alone item go for the sorbet. refreshing, tangy and an excellent pallet cleanser. The best part of our dining experience this time around though, was our waiter Anthony. His service was impeccable. Our wine glasses were always full, and he checked on us throughout each course. Then going above and beyond he even helped pull the table from the booth for my wife to exit with ease. Some of the best service we have received.",1,0,1,Cristian C.,"Delaware, NY",117,4,0

4.0,8/7/2017,"More of a 3.5 star in my book, but officially a 4 on Yelp because of the great service we received.Fiance and I came here fo Restaurant Week because neither of us are particularly big steakhouse people but had heard a lot of great things from co-workers. While there were very few reservation slots left when I checked the week prior, I was surprised to find the restaurant almost completely empty when I arrived (5:30) and still fairly sparse when I left a couple hours later. The RW menu is a really great value. The warm ""everything"" biscuits we got at the start of the meal were incredible. Both of us wanted a second round but heeded our waitress' warnings and held off. We both got the pork belly starter, which was huge. The pork belly was cooked perfectly but we both wish it hadn't been smothered in sauce and that the sauce itself was a bit too sweet. Our filet mignon entrees came out quickly and my fiance opted for the option to add some summer truffle shavings for $10. My steak was a little overcooked, pushing it more to a medium rather than medium rare. The stars of the meal were the desserts. The cracker jack sundae was the perfect combination of sweet and savory, and I couldn't get enough of the vanilla bean(?) whipped cream. I got the chocolate bread pudding which came out more like a steaming chocolate lava cake served with ice cream... super rich, decadent, and amazing.Throughout our entire meal, all of the staff were super friendly and attentive.

5.0,8/1/2017,"In a word, Amazing - and let me tell you why. They are CLASSY! My friend and I arrived 10 minutes early for our 7:45pm reservation. We were told there may be a slight wait - and that was fine with us. We know how it is to perhaps be in the middle of a conversation when the bill comes and you may want to enjoy the evening a bit longer. No issues there. At 8pm, the hostess (who was delightfully nice) told us it would be a few more minutes but please join her at the bar for a round of drinks on them for making us wait. We did not complain - this was entirely a kind gesture on their part. I had a nice wine - and my friend and a beer. We tipped generously the bartender. He was very gracious and also introduced himself to us and it was an all around nice experience. You really feel welcomed here. 10 minutes  later, we were seated at one of the nicer booths in the restaurant and the meal begun. Ordered the following:Complimentary biscuits with a cream cheese butter / herbs spread. (They are famous for this) Chilled Lobster soup for my friend. (Terrific flavor - full body and enjoyable)Caesar Salad for me (AMAZING dressing - made in front of the table. Plenty of fresh pieces and grated of parmesan cheese. Wedge Salad for my friend (Could have used more dressing but many might disagree)Baked Oysters with Champagne and Truffles to Share (WOW! Wow! No words..)Filet Mignon for my friend. (Excellent)Porterhouse for 2...for me (Delicious and PERFECTLY grilled).Chocolate Cake of the day with Peanuts and a peanut butter icing (GOD DAMN GOOD!

5.0,7/25/2017,"American cut steakhouse Tibeca I was early to my 7:45 dinner reservation and my table was not ready at the designated time. I got seated at about 8:10 PM. This lack of punctuality was not a good start to my experience. One thing I immediately noticed was how persistent they can be with up selling you. Within 1 min of being seated I had already been offered expensive bottled water (""bottled or tap?"" they ask) and cocktails from 3 separate people in the restaurant. The up selling thing didn't really bother me as I was more than prepared. I came here knowing EXACTLY what I would be ordering. Just keep this in mind if you're trying to avoid breaking the bank here.Let's get to the food. Below ill detail the meal item by item The Biscuits, 4/5 stars - These were good. They are a clever play on the everything bagel found almost anywhere in NYC. These biscuits are quite rich and hearty and pair well with the vegetable cream cheese spread that comes with them. I didn't find them to be outstanding and life changing as other Yelpers have but they do accompany the rest of the food nicely and add a nice New York touch to the meal.  The Bacon Appetizer, 4/5 stars - This type of Thickly cut bacon is a staple at steakhouses around NYC. American Cuts version compares very well to the competition. I have had the same item at Peter Luger and its better at AC. The difference is the sauce,  AC uses a nice tangy sauce that compliments the pork flavor. They also do a good job at making the bacon firm with crispy edges. I found the bacon a Luger to be more flimsy which is a quality I don't prefer in my bacon. If I was a bacon enthusiast I might give this item a 5 but I'm not so it's a 4 in my book. The Hanger Steak, 5/5 stars -  Awe-Inspiring! Its pretty simple here, the way that they age, season and cook their steak is better than anywhere I've been. The hanger cut is not even close to the best cut of steak I've had. In fact, it's the cheapest steak you can buy here. But it's about what they do with it. They coat their steaks in pastrami spice. Imagine biting in to a PERFECTLY cooked medium steak with a delectable pastrami like exterior.  The Meat had a beautiful crust similar in texture to the ""bark"" you will find on an expertly BBQ'd slab of ribs. The seared pastrami spice does wonders in the flavor and texture departments.This is a steak that needs no additional sauce, salt or anything. The flavor is perfect the way they serve it to you..Based on what they did with the cheaper cut of meat I would expect their rib-eye to be unequivocally the best steak I've ever had.The pureed potatoes, 5/5 stars - These were great! So Buttery and flavorful.They were the best mash potatoes I've ever had. They had a smooth creamy consistency unlike any potatoes I've tasted.The spinach, 5/5 stars- Just like everything else, full flavored! This was another excellent item that seemed to be seasoned perfectly to my taste.  The Crackerjack Sundae, 5/5 stars- What a terrific conclusion to a virtually flawless meal. This sundae is perfectly balanced flavor wise. It has sweet and salty as well as Creamy and crunchy elements. Who knew that Carmel popcorn went so well with ice-cream?Why 5 stars? Culinary excellence is the answer. I have eaten in the top steakhouses in New York. Everyone has top of the line USDA beef. What sets American Cut apart is how they prepare it. In my opinion the big name steakhouses in this city have become outdated in how they do things As they focus on preserving that early 1900s taste. American Cut has successfully combined a modern culinary approach with staples that make steakhouses of old the institutions that they are. In addition to excellent food the service was top notch.American Cut offers everything you should expect at this price point. If you couldn't tell from this write up they became my favorite steakhouse last night.",0,0,0,Gregory M.,"Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, NY",0,5,5

The crackerjack sundae was every sweet tooth's dream come true Now, I know this is going to sound weird, but drinks service was insanely slow. I ended up cancelling my 2nd drink because it wasn't worth the wait. Also, the NY cut steak? It was just ok, I was actually rather underwhelmed.

The one glass of wine I had was good, too. (sorry, can't remember what I had.)The biscuit they serve to start is really delicious. I ordered the dry aged rib eye, which was good--but not great. It was not as well-marbled or tender as I hoped. The porterhouse for two was really very good. Very thick and tender. Served with a garlic (I think) butter sauce. We only got two sides--the pureed potatoes and the green beans. Both were good. Nice smoky steak sauce in a little non-descript bottle was very good--even though I don't normally like to use steak sauce. That little bottle almost ended up in my purse.

No milk with coffee, 30 mintues to get and close out the check. Not a big deal. I left happy.

4.0,5/31/2017,"This review is for a Yelp Elite event in the private dining room downstairs. Great venue if you need to host a work party / small networking event.The ambiance upstairs was also very nice. Probably one of the most modern sleek looking steakhouses I've been in NY. Most steakhouses here remind me of old bankers gathered to discuss the next deal, but American Cut is different. You can still come for work meals, but the place also lends itself for special occasions (salty prices), dinner dates, taking parents, etc.Can't comment much on service, but as soon as you get in they have a coat check and everyone I spoke with was very serviceable. The food: we had pars d'oeuvre of many of their signature dishes- Porterhouse: the star of the night, it was sooooo tender!!! Take it from an Argentine that knows her steak. This thing MELTS in your mouth. Meat lovers rejoice!- Crab Cakes: very tasty, were not as oily as others I had- Caesar Salad: came in a little wedge, flavorful, perfect to pair with meat (so you still feel healthy )- Stuffed Mushrooms: loved them!!

We inquired if there were seats and were told we could sit in the lounge or at the bar--which was perfectly fine by us. We just missed a small table at the lounge so we sat at the bar and ordered a rib-eye and a baked truffle potato. We were then asked if we were bread eaters (lol) and were served a complimentary bread with vegeterian spread. It was taking awhile and when we asked about it, we were told it was made to order and received it piping hot and yummy. We had tried it downstairs earlier, which we hadn't liked that much, as it was kind of stale, but definitely good when fresh. The rib-eye came out, cooked perfectly to medium, and seasoned well. The steak sauce given was nothing special and was honestly better without it. I would pass on the truffle potato--it was very greasy feeling and just all in all not that great. We ended the meal with satisfied stomachs and asked for the check, giving the gift card to partially pay for it. It took a long time for them to figure out how to use the card, as they could tell there was $25 on it but it wouldn't allow them to use it for payment.

American Cut holds the title for my favorite steakhouse in NYC - the steaks are dry aged and cooked to perfection (unlike other places like Wolfgangs where I get as much grey band as I do medium rare steak) and the service is fantastic. The waiter was charismatic but not at all pushy - he played off us not wanting desert as a compliment instead of showing disdain or forcing a menu onto us anyways. We had both the tomahawk as well as the porterhouse steaks and both tender and flavorful as could be.

Marc Forgione and his staff actually served lunch at my office building last year, and I really it enjoyed it. So, I was really looking forward to going to the restaurant in person. My partner and I each had a 3 course meal. The best part of our meals were the appetizers (octopus, salad). My partner's fish dish was okay. I got a steak (I normally love steaks), but this was subpar; it was highly salted but other than that, had no taste. Next came the desserts (crackerjack sundae, chef's selection of ice cream). My sundae had salted caramel but it was way too salty; I couldn't finish it. Somehow the sorbet/ice cream had some added salt too (we did not expect that, and was also too salty).  Overall, the meal left us very disappointed (and left us drinking water all night long).

Not an apology not a Comp dessert or coffee. We will not go back. My husband who always over tips and never complains. I told him absolutely do not tip this waiter well at all.I felt bad the bill was over $500. Not cool!,1,0,0,J g.,"Rockville Centre, NY",0,32,0

3.0,2/20/2017,"A very good restaurant, nice service and food deserves 4 stars BUT it is totally unacceptable for such a restaurant to have a widely unaffordable wine list. No bottle below 85$ and the vast majority above 120$. We are Italians - my gf is a sommelier! - and you can get a very nice bottle of red for 30-60$ in NYC. Not a surprise that no one had a bottle of wine at the table (not even a glass since that was about 18-26$!). Moreover, the wine list doesn't pair the food menu as that is quite balances (filet for 49$ sounds right in NYC!).

The first time was with my wife. Service: Waiter excellent. Really stayed on top of things but not too much so. StartersBiscuits: Delicious as ever. Great twist on a starter breadKing Crab for my wife: tasty but they literary gave one leg cut into little pieces. Is this a French restaurant or a steakhouse?Bacon for me: Strips are slightly smaller than other steakhouses but they are flavorful. The only problem is that they are basted in a smoky steakhouse sauce which overwhelms the meatSidesSpinach: A nice twist on creamed spinach. Recommend. Mushrooms and grits: Fantastic. Can't say enough about these. Aged Potatoes: A great alternative to the standard steakhouse hash browns (which I love). Think of them like scalloped potatoes but cooked in the drippings of the steak. Main CourseSignature Tomahawk Ribeye for 2The absolute biggest let down. For the whopping price I had high expectations. My wife is no steak snob but she turned to me and said it was the worst steakhouse steak she ever had. An exaggeration but definitely a poor cut. No marbling and no taste. It had the texture of a strip steak. We had a similar cut at Maestros two months ago which was off the charts delicious. Dessert Pecan ""slash"" pie for the wife: Very tasty but you really have to love pecans, there are about two solid inches of them between the crust. Definitely a dessert to share so folks get a taste around the tableCrackerjack Sunday: a nice twist in the typical steakhouse Sunday.

3.0,2/4/2017,"What a freaking letdown. You can see from my previous review that I had a phenomenal experience the first time I visited. Let me tell you: times have changed. Let's start with the service. My party of four was on time for our 8:00 PM reservation during Restaurant Week. It took 25 minutes for us to be seated and we barely received an apology. Not cool. Appearances from our waiter during the meal were sporadic. We also waited a full half hour between the entrees and dessert, which we ordered with the rest of our pre fixes, so it's not like we needed time to look at menus or anything.Food was fine, but not as great as last time - and it was the same exact menu, so I can make a fair comparison. The bagel-breads were still amazing. Caesar salad wasn't chopped tableside like it used to be, which is not a big deal, but that did make it special. The steak was great, as were the spinach and mashed potato sides, but my salmon was kind of hard and the chicken bordered on bland. At a restaurant of this caliber, I expect everything to be as good as the steak, though I understand that's the main event. The desserts were good, especially the bread pudding. This was sort of ruined when were given four ""petit fours"" (they were essentially mini Rice Krispies treats) with the check, and they were overly sweet and dry to the extent that I didn't even finish mine. They seemed out of place. Finally, the staff did the oddest thing with our leftovers. As a disclaimer, I don't like wasting food, and I don't care if it comes off as a tacky move to take things home during RW or at an expensive restaurant. Anyway, my friend and I both purposely moved the leftover sides (spinach etc) to our plates and asked them to wrap it all together. When we opened our containers the next day, we could see they'd scraped all of the sides out and only wrapped the leftover meat and fish. The sides weren't in a separate container - they were just gone. Who does that?TL;DR: I had a much worse experience than the first time I came, and I probably won't be back, which is a shame because the steak really is quite good.",3,1,1,Gab G.,"New York, NY",208,1651,5011

We arrived very early, at 8pm to ensure we were seated promptly, and purchased a few drinks at the bar while we waited. The host told us to ""come find him"" at 8:30, not, ""I will find you."" So, at 8:30 my friend left the bar and was told ""a few more minutes, we are turning the table over now"" as I cashed out and lost the only bar seats left available. By 8:50 we still had no table, and were told ""another 5-10 minutes."" This is outrageous to me. I have never waited 30min for a reservation in an upscale establishment in NYC. Granted, it was restaurant week, but we had made this reservation far in advance and were there for a $450 bill, not a $42 pre-fix menu, catering to the lobby full of 21 year-olds, most of whom can only afford this restaurant during restaurant week.

We ordered filets, latkes, and Brussels sprouts. No salad, no dessert. Filets were really tender and crispy on the outside. Latkes were a little heavy. Brussels sprouts were cooked perfectly. Basically, everything was fine or slightly better than fine, but what really earns the 3 stars instead of 4 is how they rushed us out of there! Perhaps not ordering salads is what did it, but they brought the steaks within 2 minutes of the cocktails and we had half a bottle of wine left once the meal was finished.

We ordered the ""house special"" 52 day aged porterhouse for two for - brace yourselves - $165. For that kind of dough it better be the best piece of meat, ever, and it wasn't even close. Very little marbling, quite tough to cut, actually, and without much flavor. In fact, I had to ask for steak sauce even after the custom sauce, which, while fun to watch prepare at your table, was nothing special.

Before coming here I contemplated whether I should go with the classic steak or pastrami rub. I went with classic as I am a purist when it comes to my steak. Glad I did. I tasted the pastrami steak and although it was unique and kind of exciting at first, it detracted from the beef after a few bites. double baked potato and mushroom polenta were delicious and excellent pairings for the steak. Chili lobster was such an experience. I could eat that broth everyday. Although a bit overpowering for the lobster, the heat was a flavor punch.

The steak was huge and they made it in front of us which was so cool. My favorite thing though was the everything biscuits. It's basically like an everything bagel except it's a biscuit and it came with the best cream cheese and I fell in love. I didn't bother to get fancy drinks so I settled with whiskey which was roughly 16 dollars. The fancy drinks weren't anything special but they tasted good so I've heard.

There are so many great steakhouses in the city, so unless you feel like you've been to them all and want to try somewhere new (that was us on this one), I'd definitely suggest going to a different one.I had actually been to American Cut once before about two years ago and had a good meal there, but after last weekend, we probably won't go back again.First, we had one of those waiters who is quick to recommend only the most expensive items on the menu. Thanks for nothing, right? Our party of 6 split a few bacon and chili lobster appetizers. The bacon was EXCELLENT and the lobster was pretty good, yet was an insanely small portion for $34. The real issue was with the steaks. We ordered porterhouses and the tomahawk ribeye medium rare, but they didn't come out anywhere close to medium rare. How does a sliced steak come out so wrong? That's what really confused me the most... We had to send them back, but they left all of the sides on the table, so that created that awkward tension where you don't know whether to eat the sides without any steak to go with it...Of course, by the time the steaks came back (cooked better this time), we were mostly full from eating the sides, which by then were largely cold. But it's just never the same quality anyway when that happens. For several hundred $$ in steaks, just very disappointing. A free dessert as a half-hearted apology didn't go very far. Last, one of the most egregiously priced wine lists I've seen. There many two bottles of Pinot Noir under $100 but no Cabernet under $110 or so. Pretty nuts.

Its a warm, beautiful art-deco dining room is a great scene to enjoy a slab of good beef; and the bar (and very reasonable happy hour with chill bartenders) is very welcome and friendly too.

Steaks are a work of art, even the Bell & Evans Chicken & Short Rib are very good. Sides are mixed. Twice baked potato was beautiful but lacked seasoning and flavor. Spinach was good. Unless your dining on a corporate account or celebrating a special event, this is not at the top of my list for a regular dinner out. Service is excellent, personable and knowledgeable.  I see mixed reviews on this topic, so I think it depends on whos waiting on you, and the overall ""vibe"" of the restaurant that evening.

Probably preferred that seat over the deafening roar that came from the proper dining room next door, if I'm being honest.The meal started off with some delicious everything biscuits and vegetable butter (omg so good, one of the best free bread starters I've ever had). We also split an order of half dozen oysters, which were delicious though probably overpriced, and tuna tartare, which was probably the most disappointing part of the night (decent, but I'd rather have had something else). Our main was the tomahawk steak for two, which was a rather large and impressive cut of meat. We asked for it to be cooked medium rare, and it came out more on the rare side if anything, but that didn't stop us from devouring most of it. Mushrooms and polenta made for the perfect side (I'd come here again just for this).For dessert we split the berry buckle which, while not amazing, was a nice bite to end the meal.Service was very friendly throughout, and even while I was sitting there for 60+ minutes waiting for my friend (this offset the slightly icy hostesses).

4.0,9/11/2016,"oddly enough, i am in this area all the time & i have never noticed american cut. must be kind of new. anyway, a friend wanted to come try this place out so i said sure, lets do it. we had an 830 reservation on a saturday night. other reviewers are correct, you have to wait a half hour at the bar before they seat you. but they have a solid bar with good looking bartenders. its kind of fancy and everyone looked pretty dressed up. i peeked into the restaurant section and there was a man and his young son having dinner. how cute. then i saw a bunch of flames. not sure what the dish is they serve where they do this at tableside, but its kind of entertaining. i did not check yelp before i came.but anyway, they brought biscuits to the table and it was so friggin good. bread and butter is usually just a pile of carbs to me but i did not eat prior so i went for it. really really good biscuits with the cream cheese spread. i ordered the filet mignon but they were out! our waiter suggested the ny strip instead. it was a good choice. perfectly seared on the outside. medium rare just like how i like it. it was not chewy at all. my friend, ordered the wedge salad without the bacon. while it was a good attempt, there was too much blue cheese drizzle. it was pretty much like eating blue cheese. this was all he had. it was all he wanted. but ok! i finished about 90% of my steak. the waiter told me he was impressed. not sure if that was a compliment or not. ha! dessert and appetizers was definitely not needed in addition to my steak. i was beyond full after the 2 martinis. however, after coming home and checking yelp, i think i want to come back and try the bone marrow and the steak tartare. next time i will be more prepared for you, american cut. so despite the half an hour wait time to be seated, it's what i expect from a steakhouse in tribeca. it does have a sort of meatpacking feel to it, but it was a good experience nonetheless.",1,0,0,Ms G.,"New York, NY",253,270,155

The classy interior, food and service are all what you would expect of a Marc Forgione restaurant. I wouldn't classify this as a traditional steakhouse, as it's located in Greenwich Village and adopts a more modern, trendy image, but the steak itself will bring you right back. Don't skip the bread basket - mirroring what others have mentioned, the everything biscuits paired with vegetable compound butter are ten steps up from your regular toasted bagel in the morning. For the entree, I got the 9 oz. pastrami spiced hanger, which was incredibly flavorful and tender, and a side of fontina creamed spinach.

It didn't have anything that gave me the hint of pastrami.American Cut, Why is it that you feel a steak is better charred on the outside. Charred is another word for burned. My steak was dry, overcooked and the accompanying bernaise sauce wasn't hot, it was kinda congealed...gross. Wait staff - perfunctory is the word that comes to mind. Nothing memorable.

We had a pretty fantastic meal, and I'm not usually a steakhouse person. They're often stuffy, pretentious, and the food is boring. This place is not any of those - the dining room is old-school glam but comfortable. Our waitress made really good food and wine recommendations, although she was hard to track down at times but I'd take her over a grumpy old man (picture typical steakhouse waiter) anyday. We started with the clams special, very much like clams casino, and the clams themselves were cooked perfectly. We then shared the porterhouse and it was also perfect, and the actual quality and flavor of the steak was so much better than Peter Lugers (I know - big statement). The side of sunchoked spinach is more spinach with cheese than creamed spinach, a nice take where you can actually taste the vegetable. Asparagus was too lemony but otherwise a nice side dish (gotta try to get health points somewhere).

Or better yet, if I had any chest hair, lets just say I would have felt a little curl and tingle. As for the menu choices, it was delicious! My hanger steak was marinated and grilled to perfection (medium rare) and their side spinach was stunning with flavors. So much so, that I almost felt like Popeye, where I finished the spinach first even before the steak.Their oyster was flavored nicely but only wish them suckers were more plum so I wouldn't feel like I was having yummy sauce with oysters instead of oysters with yummy sauce.

5.0,8/16/2016,"Living in NYC for just over a month and I have to say that this is my favourite restaurant so far. It was totally unexpected, but on a Friday evening, my boyfriend and I decided to try a restaurant in Tribeca for dinner. We came across American Cut and looked up their Restaurant Week Menu to see if we both liked it. We planned on ordering from the RW Menu but once we sat down in the bar/lounge and had a look at the Happy Hour Menu, we changed our minds... This is honestly the best Happy Hour Menu I have ever seen. AND it lasts until 7pm! Everything sounded delicious, so we tried a few different things. We ordered the wagyu sliders, chili lobster wings and bang bang shrimp. My boyfirend also ordered some oysters. So to sum it all up, the wagyu sliders were the BEST I have ever tasted. I would go back just for those sliders. They are much larger than I expected too. The chili lobster wings are actually chicken wings covered in a lobster sauce. Very unique and really spicy once you get to the sauce! The bang bang shrimp was unreal. You better like spice if you order them though. The shrimp are quite large and I believe you get 6 of them. It also comes with a piece of bread dipped in their spicy sauce - delicious!! Now onto the oysters...I didn't have any, but my boyfriend has tried oysters all over the place. He said they were the BEST oysters he has ever tasted! And they were only $1 each... like I said, this is an amazing Happy Hour Menu.Didn't have enough room for dessert because we thought the items would be smaller (hence why we ordered so much!) but will definitely be back to try it out.When we got home, we did some research and found out that they have an amazing burger. Apparently they only make a certain number every night (12-14?) and they announce at about 4:30pm on their Twitter page about how many burgers they make that night. We will definitely be trying that burger.",0,0,0,Amanda R.,"Manhattan, NY",1,24,3
4.0,8/14/2016,"There for dinner during RW. Seated in the basement, where decor was lackluster. Clearly inferior to upstairs and was prepared to ask for a table up there, but didn't want to complain given we were ordering from RW menu. (Plus, the table itself was admittedly a spacious but very round booth that was nicely intimate for a couple).Bacon starter was OK, but not as tender or melt-in-your-mouth as I would have expected. I think it was due to how it was prepared--perhaps the rub on the outside didn't allow the fat to cook as nicely as it otherwise could have. The Caesar salad starter was on point, though, and amongst the best I've had. Steak was a nice-sized cut of meat for a RW serving and thoroughly enjoyable (though I could have lived with whatever marinade/seasoning was contributing to the smoked flavor that wasn't my personal favorite... but I recognize it was part of the dish). And the sides (especially the creamed spinach) were very nicely done. Service was attentive throughout the night and made up for the crappy downstairs setting.

For appetizers we ordered:Jim Brady Oysters - Champagne, Black Truffle, Cruccola: a decadent and tasty dish, came with 3 oysters.Bacon, Schaller & Weber - MF Steak Sauce, Black Onion: Really tasty. Nice thick (and meaty/not all gristly!) cuts of bacon with a tangy bbq dipping sauce. Awesome.For our entrees, we ordered:Pastrami-spiced Hanger Steak - As a pastrami lover, wow. Oh man, winner winner.Bell & Evans Chicken - Natural Jus, Chili: They give you a really generous portion of nice and juicy cooked chicken.  I like-a de-jus.  The jus...it make-a it tasty goood. (props if you get the snl reference)We also just got one of each of the sides offered:Sunchoke Spinach, Fontina, Smoked Salt - nicely steamed spinach; helped me feel okay about eating the steak...and everything else.Potato Puree "" Robuchon"", Local Butter - rich, creamy, what's not to like?And for dessert, we ordered the: Cracker Jack Sundae - Really fun treat, with bits of caramel popcorn and other goodies.

We expected the entrees to make up for the poor apps, but unfortunately that wasn't the case. Tough, overcooked steak, and fine salmon with three tiny mushrooms thrown on top. The deserts were just as a disappointment as the rest - Cracker Jack sundae of grocery store whipped cream with Carmel and a tiny scoop of ice cream. The blueberry bread was dry and boring.

5.0,7/2/2016,"I'm not sure where to even start on a review for American Cut.  Another one of Marc Forgione's masterpieces, this place is the pinnacle of what it means to put a ""New American"" twist on the traditional steakhouse (if you're looking for a boring, plain porterhouse, go somewhere else).  To preface, I've eaten at the bar a few dozen times, and have eaten in the dinning rooms on 10-15 different occasions.  What's incredible is how consistent the food and experience actually is.  Let's start with the atmosphere.  American Cut doesn't subscribe to the be seen ""boys club"" steakhouse mentality.  Instead, you walk through a very dimly light bar area with a painting of Muhammad Ali overlooking the bar area (because why not), which surprisingly fits the ""art deco yet industrial tribeca loft"" type feel.  The decor is meticulous, upscale, yet cozy, with exposed brick complimenting dark wood tables and beautiful black chairs.  Now on to the food.  Note that the bar menu is different from the dinner menu (and annoyingly, you usually can't order the bar food at your table).  The Happy Hour/Bar Menu is one of the most incredibly diverse yet appealing bar menus I've ever seen, ranging from soft baked pretzels, wagyu sliders, lobster wings, popcorn shrimp (literally shrimp in a bowl of popcorn), tater tots, and some of the best Chesapeake oysters I've ever eaten (at $1 each!).  Each item is a meal in itself, with the sliders enough for at least two people.  That said, the dinner menu is where the party's at.  The dinner menu ranges from cold seafood (oysters, clams, foie gras, steak tartare, etc), to salads, to hot seafood (jim brady oysters, bone marrow, and legendary chili lobster), to world class sides, and what I believe is the best lineup of meats in Manhattan.  To that later point, the 20 oz New York City Cut rubbed in pastrami spices is something you can't find anywhere in Manhattan (and the best steak I've ever consumed).  The Colorado lamb is also a shockingly good alternative to their beef lineup.  In terms of sides,  the latkes are out of this word, but be sure to listen closely to their specials (the jalapeno mashed potatoes and tater tots aren't on the menu, but are incredible additions to your meal).  Do try to order a bit of everything on the menu as there is little that won't blow you away (plus, you're going to leave stuffed and 10 lbs heavier anyway).On to the drink menu.  Note that their signature cocktail is the plank smoked old fashioned (maker's 46, maple smoke, ac bitters, and caster sugar), which is an experience in itself as your server starts a plank of wood on fire to smoke your drink.  Being a steakhouse, the wine menu has hundreds of different bottles of wine (ranging from $50 to $2,000+).  That said, if you made it this far into the review, you'd pick up the fact that some of the menu items are particularly unique and flavorful .  That said, their sommeliers usually have a good understanding of what to pair with each menu item.Lastly, the service is truly world class.  Your server, table help, general manager, and maybe even Marc Forgione himself are constantly at the ready to answer any questions and give recommendations.  All are exceptionally friendly and always make you feel at home.All that said, if you haven't picked up on my tone by now, I strongly believe American Cut Tribeca is the best steakhouse in New York City.",3,1,4,Matt K.,"New York, NY",262,93,22

The menu did not indicate there were almonds in the grilled octopus, nor did the waiter inform us when the order was placed, or when he served it.  It's dark in this restaurant, so it was thought that the almonds were fava beans in the he sauce surrounding the octopus. After half way through it, it was discovered that they are Brazilian raw almonds.  The waiter was tripping over himself. The manager comes to the table asking whether we'd like him to call someone. Who? 911 in the middle of the crowded restaurant? Fortunately, the epi pen did not have to come out, just a lot of Benadryl since the nuts were not eaten, just the octopus.

3.0,5/16/2016,"Had high expectations as we love Marc Forgione the Restaurant.  We had a pretty early reservation so we got there around 6:30 pm on a Friday.  There were some people at the bar but the dining room was crickets.  Fine...we're early.  The atmosphere is classic NYC steakhouse, dark room with no windows.  The food was good but nothing special.  Considering all the steakhouse options in NYC, I was not blown away by the steak.  Again good but nothing I would run back for.  Most of the dishes we really enjoyed were basically the hit list from Marc Forgione.  The cocktails were good but hard to cough up $18 for just one drink.  Everyone seemed to be raving about the biscuits, I thought they were ok.Considering how expensive the bill was, I will probably not be back anytime soon.  If I get the craving for steak, I'll be going to Peter Lugers, Sparks, Mortons, etc.  I don't think American Cut did much to differentiate from the rest and the steak didn't compete.",0,0,0,Sal G.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,34,0

We came on a friday. But it is very good. You need sides as the fries that come with it are TINY! The pickles that came with it were really yummy. Had an sour but savory tang. We got the mussels as a side which were awesome. They were the smaller kind. The tater tots i wasn't as much a fan of as they were too large and the insides were a bit mushy.

1.0,4/7/2016,This place is awful. The pastrami spiced steak is horrible. It was worse the second time.  The first time it was a novelty so it tasted good but the spices that they rub on there are so gritty it does not make for an enjoyable steak The sides are still creative but they are absolutely small at $12 per side I didn't bother getting desserts The desserts are absolutely horrible here The service was nonexistent tonight and I just don't understand how this place is so crowded I guess a lot of people just don't know any better The wine list is totally ridiculous $100 is the least expensive bottle of red wine . What a way to screw your customers What nerve I will never return to this ridiculous steakhouse. What balls in this wine list pricing.

4.0,3/29/2016,"Soooo, I rarely give out 5s, but they came relatively close. It wasnt the best steak I've ever had, but in my definite top steaks category.Why they came close to a 5: The ambiance is nice, the wait staff was very attentive,  and the selection is pretty good. Their biscuits made me forget why I ever gave up carbs. The ceaser salad was made table side & was pretty darn good. They actually cooked a medium steak right (there's been an epidemic of overcooked steak in my life) and it was well flavored and didnt even need their house steak sauce.The creamed spinach was flavorful (not too dry & not too creamy)Their short ribs were well cooked & seasonedTheir lobster chili was good, but not mind blowingly great (per my dinner guests)The sides were an appropriate size to share, not too big & not too smallI was too stuffed to try dessert, so no opinion on thatWhy they fell short of a 5: my table of 4 was seated next to the kitchen (I guess someone has to sit there)The broccoli was overcooked and dry, their potatoes lacked flavor & the mushrooms were dry as well. They only offered one size for their filet which I think a 10 oz is a lot to deal with. Plus, I've never been to an upscale steakhouse that made and offered you steak sauce. Most are insulted when you ask for it. It wasn't that great and actually distracted from the flavor of the steak.I dont think the taste of the meal in totality matched the price, but it had its highlights. All in all, a good restaurant. Pricey, but it met most of my culinary standards. I was just visiting nyc, so I cant compare it to other steakhouses.

2.0,3/27/2016,Only reason why I gave this place two stars was because the atmosphere.The waiter was horrible - forgot my salad and what I ordered. Another person came over and checked and got me the salad but not what I ordered.The waiter acted like the restaurant was the greatest and we were privileged for being in a half empty steak house on a Saturday night @ 9 pm. The worst was the most ordered steak with the pastrami seasoning. It was so over seasoned I couldn't even taste the beef. Scrapped off or cut off the top layer of the steak and it; you will be able to eat it. The one person who ordered the fillet - was lucky. Properly seasoned steak. If I had to go here for steak or eat a McDonald's breakfast steak sammich - I would go to McDonald's.Don't waste your money go to a good steak house like the strip house.

5.0,3/24/2016,"A delicious restaurants with lots of steakhouse favorites (with a twist!)It's very dark inside American Cut, but the decor and vibe is great. The table for 4 was extra large, which I love  (hate being cramped in, especially when you're about to eat a feast).Our server, Yasminca, was awesome. She was friendly, offered suggestions, and accommodated all our odd requests. We mostly skipped drinks, but dove into the plate of everything biscuits. WARNING: these are highly addicting. I could have eaten 10 of them, but had to control myself so I stopped at 1.5 :)They are served with this amazing vegetable cream cheese/butter blend. So simple, yet so smart!We shared the Hiramasa and Steak Tartare. The hiramasa looked weird (like a dumpling in a bowl of soup), but actually tasted really good. It had a sashimi taste with a miso broth (it's not hot though). The steak tartare had a great kick from the tabasco. We decided (4 of us) to share the 52 oz portherhouse special (flambeed tableside!) So much meat, even for the 4 of us. It was crispy on the outside, perfectly medium-rare on the inside. We also shared a bunch of sides: fontina creamed spinach (the best side, in my opinion), the twice baked potato with cheddar and truffle (I'm not too crazy about baked potatoes, but it was good), and the mashed potatoes (literally the creamiest potatoes I've ever had).Somehow, we managed to save room for dessert-the candy bar cake. The roasted peanuts added great dimension and texture.",4,2,2,Michelle B.,"Huntington Station, NY",816,1320,3063
4.0,3/16/2016,"This place has more people going crazy for biscuits, than a kennel does for dogs. The only downside with that is, when you tell people you're checking out a steakhouse for the first time and they first rave to you about the biscuits but not the steaks, it could raise an eyebrow or two. (Usually two, when I try to raise one I end up looking stupid and raising two)Regardless I was excited. Upon entering the place, it definitely had the feel of some other top notch steak houses I've been to in New York. Got our table right away, ordered some wine from their extensive menu, and was ready to eat. We started off with the biscuits and they delivered as advertised. They're amazing with or without the cream cheese. It's as if an everything bagel and a biscuit combined into one, and someone said that tasted awful, then decided to make this which is really good. Caesar salad was good. Nothing too special. Now for the steak. It was a bit of a disappointment. If wasn't awful, I just wasn't as blown away as I normally am at some other fine New York City steakhouses. I like my steak rare to medium rare. This was just too chewy in my opinion. On the flip side, I did try their well steak (hey, I didn't order it) and I have to say it wasn't too bad. I'm not a fan of well done steaks, nor should anyone be, but this was excellent for a well done steak. Maybe it's what they do best. It could be the seasoning. The rub they put on is very good. Another thing I heard people talking about was the crackerjack sundae. This bad boy is delicious. And by bad I mean it's bad for you, but who cares? I've just stuffed my face with steak and a half, on top of some mouth water biscuits and thousand calorie salad. Do I really care how unhealthy this is? I left stuffed and happy. It was a great meal. I have no quarrel with paying top dollar for a good steakhouse, but for the price you pay here, you can be going to some other spots that are better.",3,4,3,Mitch E.,"Brooklyn, NY",846,1050,451
3.0,3/13/2016,"3.5 Stars- I came here for a birthday dinner during Restaurant Week, and was mostly pleased with what I had, but it didn't necessarily live up to some of the hype. Actually, when we consider that this is a steakhouse and the steak I tried was my least favorite item, that doesn't bode well. However, the appetizers and sides were pretty outstanding in flavor and cute presentation (all-clad mini pots for your sides, etc). It's a nice restaurant, so don't show up in sweats and a t-shirt. Soft, dim lighting and a great atmosphere for a nice date. Waitstaff is very attentive and very quick to address even the smallest of your concerns. And that's how it should be when you pay a decent amount for your dining experience. Restaurant Week Menus obviously means limited options, but I was able to have a nibble of everything on that menu between myself and the guest of honor. We started with their house biscuits. Think everything bagel, a bit too salty, and a creamy butter. The biscuits themselves are light, perfect texture, but again a little too salty for my personal taste and I wasn't able to finish a whole one. I had the Diamond Jim Brady Oysters for my appetizer and I enjoyed them a lot. The bacon was scrumptious, while the hanger steak was far less impressive and served without resting. I ordered the chicken, which was decent, but not that flavorful- the crispy skin is what saved them because the jus/gravy wasn't all that. The sides were the best part of this meal and worth a return trip, and probably a great deal of praise. The creamed spinach with fontina is to die for. The potato puree, I would like to have intravenously forever and ever, amen. If you haven't already figured it out, this place is not a dieter's friend- cheese in the spinach and ish. But these sides were worth every penny and I think really saved my chicken. We didn't finish the hanger steak, which I find to be pitiful in a steakhouse. Lastly, the crackerjack sundae is right on the money, but the red velvet thing we tried isn't worth the calories. Will come back for the potatoes and other sides, but skip the main dishes.",11,4,6,Chloe C.,"Manhattan, NY",229,199,1033

2.0,3/8/2016,"Came here because we were craving good meat and it was restaurant week. The staff were really friendly and the ambiance was really nice. The food was pretty good too. The biscuit they gave us was probably the best biscuit I've ever had in my life. Since it was restaurant week (Jan 2016) I had the bacon for the app, the hanger steak for the main, and the cracker jack sundae for dessert. My friends all got the oysters for the app, the steak for main, and the red velvet bread pudding. The bacon was good but bacon is always good. For a steakhouse, the steak was underwhelming. It wasn't even that pretty to look at - just some strips of steak cut onto a scratched up/dirty looking white plate that looked like it came from a dive restaurant. I didn't take a picture cus it didn't look that good. However, the spinach and mashed potato that came with it was really buttery and delicious though. The best part was the cracker jack sundae. It was probably the best part of the whole meal. So sweet and delicious! My friends got the red velvet dessert and it didn't really taste good. I was glad I got the sundae. Being known as a steakhouse, it was kind of underwhelming on the meat side. but they really stood out with the biscuits and cracker jack sundae. WARNING: my friends got food poisoning the following days. We think it was either from the oysters or red velvet bread pudding. We had all our meals together that day and I was the only one who didn't get the oysters or red velvet bread pudding, and I was the only one who didnt get food poisoning. EXTRA WARNING: we tried to get in contact with the restaurant to let them know that they might be serving spoiled food, but they were pretty dismissive of us and told us they would get back to us... they never got back to us.

5.0,2/29/2016,"105 is the magic number. I came here for their dry aged burger at the bar, and 105 is the magic number. It took me 105 chews to finally get myself to swallow the first bite. There is absolutely no way to formulate a description of this burger other than it is 100% worth every single bit of effort to go down here. Piece by piece breakdown of my meal coming up:1) The Dry Aged Burger (14$)The burger was phenomenal. Taking the first couple bites, you sometimes chew into a crunchy little crisp bite. That is the charred dry aged steak that has been perfectly cooked and crisped to a point. The delicious layer of cheese that drapes over this magnificent patty blankets the innocent, succulent little mushrooms, cowering away from the world. This review may seem a bit awkward, but I have to say, there is no better way to describe the burger... Do yourself a favor and just go get the burger.2) The Crab Cakes (19$)Solid home styled crab cakes, coated by corn flakes, apparently an old family recipe. It definitely shows with how full the flavor is. Paired with a tangy coleslaw, the crab cake is biased on top of a delicious glazed onion purée. Excellent pair with the crispy crab cake.3) Tater Tots? (8$)Meh... Good home styled tatertots with a rich home style ketchup, but honestly, I could have done without.4) Plank Roasted Bourbon (10$ on Happy Hour)This was a nice pairing to the burger. Nice and Rich with a definite smokey residue flavor, paired really well with the crisp of the burger. If you're gonna get the burger, get the Bourbon as well, it makes it all come together oh so well.All in all, this place is definitely a place to go and would 100% recommend making the effort to come here. *** Heads up, they only make a small amount of burgers a day, so go early to catch the burger and check their Twitter at approximately 4:30 daily because that's when they tell how many burgers they have for that night.",2,3,0,Paul Y.,"New York, NY",504,131,117

Our server was knowledgable and offers great recommendations. Food- ehhh super pricey and just okay. For starters we got the foie gras and crab cakes. The crab cakes were deeply fried and crab meat really mushy. I've had much better crab cakes at other steak houses. For entree we got the dole and filet mignon. My boyfriend said the steak was just ""okay"" and unforgettable. There's so many steak houses in New York that he wouldn't go back here. The dole was okay and absolutely over priced.

Seems to be a growing trend in the NYC restaurant business. Definitely our fault b/c one of our friends was 30 minutes late. By that time they had given away our table. They informed us that it would be another 30 minutes before a table would be ready. Luckily for us, we had already perused the RW menu online so we all knew what we wanted to order by the time we sat down. I was able to try the slab of bacon and the baked oysters which were both excellent. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the hangar steak. There was honestly no flavor at all to it and the meat was beyond chewy. I actually left 1/3 of it on the plate b/c I couldn't stomach anymore. Saving grace was the dessert-- cracker jack sundae!!

When I went back our waiter was all smiles and didn't act annoyed for a bit. Food was truly excellent. I loved the spice in the caesar salad and texture of the chopped egg. The steak was medium rare and perfectly charred and seasoned. Sunchoked spinach was creamy although I wasn't sure if a chunk of sunchoke was placed at the bottom intentionally or by accident. Dessert of cracker jack sundae was simple but delicious. In the end we were actually kicked out because the place got too busy. I didn't mind. I highly recommend this place if you are looking to get an unconventional steak dinner.,2,1,2,Joy Y.,"New York, NY",266,824,1216
4.0,2/5/2016,"Had dinner and drinks here with the wife and mother in law. Was very pleasantly surprised upon arrival. We had reservations for 5:30 and got there at 5 for a cold one at the bar. The happy prices can not be beat. I highly recommend their old fashioned which they have a nice take on. Was seated promptly on time by a hostess. Our waiter was ACES. He explained the menu to us and gave us his recommendations (seemed legit, I know some waiters are just blowing smoke up your...). He was very personable, friendly and polite, which of course makes your dining experience even more enjoyable. We ordered off the RW menu and ordered the oysters for our app. Three oysters that were very tasty. Had the steak for an entree that was a little on the tough side but delicious. Dessert was a red velvety raspberry cupcakeish thing that was pretty good.The food was pretty good, but the ambiance and waitstaff really made this place awesome. I would recommend for a couple of cold ones for happy hour with co workers.",1,1,1,Kevin S.,"Manhattan, NY",1,15,0
3.0,2/3/2016,"Kinda happy we didn't opt for Restaurant Week here AND skipped their Citi Perks/BlackBoardEats deal, because the customer service was lacking for 'my kind' (i.e., non-finance type yet dressed respectably) on my visit. Arrived just after 5:30 when the kitchen opens (the bar apparently opens @5 and was already half-full a half-hour later) and sat at the bar for 7 minutes not only unacknowledged but ignored when I tried to politely get the attention of the handful of staff behind the bar. Went against my best judgment and stuck around to order up their $14 burger medium rare (check Twitter daily to see how many are available and get there early to guarantee one), which took a bit to emerge as they placed an empty place setting in front of me, only to be replaced by the food-filled plate when it arrived from behind me. The few fries were already lukewarm AND pre-dipped in the house ketchup the second the plate landed on the bar in front of me. The burger -- beer cheese on top of a blend of dry-aged rib-eye, short rib and prime brisket (which makes it sound like a great value) -- was quite good, but I'm actually happy they decided to serve it with the pickles on the side, as one was enough.",3,2,2,George C.,"New York, NY",0,7747,14304

4.0,1/29/2016,"Was there for restaurant week. Overall, love everything except the wait time. Our dinner reservations was for 7:45pm. We got there at 7:40pm and the hostess (not so friendly) said our table is not ready but the guests are paying. So we waited but no follow up and finally at 7:55pm, I went up to the hostess and asks, ""exactly how long do we have to wait when we have reservations? "". We waited another 2-3 mins and finally got seated. I'm very surprised with reservations, we still have to wait a bit. I see from other yelpers reviews, this is not the first complaint and probably won't be the last if they don't fix this. Other than the wait time issue, we love our server, Ahmed. He was very professional, friendly, kind and was so attentive. Thank goodness for awesome customer service. Even though it's restaurant week, the restaurant has to realize that customers will spend more if customer service experience is at least above average and will look forward to coming back.We love everything from their restaurant menu and the appetizers from their regular menu.

5.0,1/29/2016,"One of the best dining experience that I've had.  From host to servers, everyone was so friendly and nice here. It didn't hurt that our server was very cute. I was recommended the Old Fashion and moments later, our server push a cart over and smoked the glass right in front of us. I never had an Old Fashion before so I can't really compare but it was pretty good. Unfortunately, my meal soon took over most of my attention and my drink was neglected for a while and when I finally returned to it, it was mostly watered down by the melted ice...haha.  The biscuits were so good. I was tempted to eat the whole thing but knowing there were more food to come, I tamed myself. We ordered the crab cake for appetizer. I'm not a big fan of crab cakes so I only tried a little bit. It was delicious. Full of flavor. For the main course, we ordered the Surf and Turf for two.  The Tomahawk steak, over 40 oz of ribeye cooked medium-rare.  Just seeing the size of the bone on that plate cracked me up. (I see where the name tomahawk comes in now.) The steak was perfectly cooked. Very juicy. The steak sauce in the bottle was on the sweet side. I liked it. The spicy lobster was amazing. Cut nicely so it was easy to eat. The sweet spicy flavor had just the right kick. It was my favorite. We also ordered the spinach and the pureed potatoes as sides.  They were both delicious but the potato was too smooth for my liking. (I prefer the chunky texture so it wasn't for me but great flavors.)We were too full to have dessert but I see their Cracker Jack ice cream is really popular. We were given gummy bears at the end of the meal. Very cute.  This is a good place to impress a date. Great food and great service. I certainly was impressed.",0,0,0,Ann L.,"Staten Island, NY",0,26,3

My friends couldn't keep their hand to them selves when they saw the bacon, it was delicious, as for the steak not my favorite (for a steak house kind of disappointing) the potatoe purée was delicious (again those friend of mine dug right in) for dessert I had the cracker jack sundae, nothing spectacular, just vanilla ice cream with some Cracker Jack pop corn...what happened to the peanuts or hot fudge?!! Add these 2 ingredients  then you can it a sundae. My friends had the lemon yuzu tart (which was to tart for my taste but wow was it art work, beautiful display) the other the vanilla bean cheesecake this would make me come back for more.

1.0,1/27/2016,"Literally one of the worst dining experiences i've EVER had in my 5 years in NYC. We came here for Restaurant Week and the menu choices looked good and on top of having great reviews, we decided to try. Our night started off with AN HOUR WAIT for a reservation at 7:45pm. So we decided to go to the bar with only 2 bartenders....another 15 mins at the bar and still no drink. So we decided to sit at a cocktail table where we ordered drinks but our waiter never even checked on us, asked if we wanted another round (with clearly empty glasses), AND we had to ask for our check.While waiting for our table, there were 3 hostesses at the front who didn't care about reassuring other parties who were waiting as well and we had to go up 3 times to ask when we would be seated. Someone definitely messed up their reservations and their excuse was ""we can't make people get up from tables for dinner"" and I told them that they shouldn't double book tables then if they don't know how to time them correctly!!!!Then finally my friend and I finally get seated. They had ran out of oysters so they subbed that for crab cakes (which weren't bad). Entrees we had the chicken and salmon with sides of spinach and potato puree. My salmon came out COMPLETELY RAW while the chicken was overdone and tough to eat. The best part of the meal was probably the sundae and sides very sadly.... The waiter service was extremely mediocre and was barely apologetic when I sent back the salmon. I really wanted to like this place more. I would only come back for the sundae and only good thing about this place is that they have a nice ambiance and decor. The reviews are overrated and I would rather take my business to Strip House or somewhere else.... It's unacceptable to have bad customer service with no manager in sight.

5.0,1/23/2016,"Normally I avoid restaurant week because the menu selections are pretty bad and don't include stuff from the regular menu, but American Cut knows how to do it. Great food and great service. I normally come here for their amazing burger, but their regular dishes are just as good. We got their restaurant week menu, which we've had during a previous restaurant week visit.  For the appetizers: we chose the oysters which were just as good as I remember.  Ours came with two small ones and one large.  I think I could have eaten a dozen of these.  If you've never had their oysters, you should try the ones on the appetizer menu.  We also got the bacon and while it's not the regular size slice, it was enough to get us going.  The both of us got the 9 oz pastrami spice smoke Hanger Steak medium rare and rare.  My medium rare was delicious and melt in your mouth.  It was cooked just right, but you have to eat it right away since it won't taste as good when it gets cold.  It's also seasoned very well so there is no need for the steak sauce.  For the sides, we got the Sunchoke Spinach and Potato Puree ""Robuchon"".  The sides were delicious and you can't go wrong with these two options.We tried their Cracker Jack Sundae and Red Velvet Bread Pudding.  The bread pudding didn't taste very red velvet to me.  It tasted more like chocolate.  I think I will stick to the sundae next time since that never fails.  It's rare, a steakhouse will keep me coming back, but American Cut has done it somehow.  I've been here countless times for their steak as well as their burger and I have a good time every time.",4,0,1,Angeline C.,"Brooklyn, NY",64,623,346

1.0,1/19/2016,"I was treating my boyfriend to a birthday dinner. I am so embarrassed I decided to take him here to celebrate the occasion.  I had reservations at 7PM for a party of two. We weren't seated until 7:25PM and were only seated because I had to go back to the hostess twice to make her aware that we needed to run to an event immediately after dinner. Otherwise, we would have been kept waiting even longer. Turns out, there was an entire downstairs section with available tables. Even the main floor seemed to have open tables. There was no apology for the wait. The hostess gave me attitude and even rolled her eyes at me. I overheard other parties of two checking in for a 7PM reservation, and they too were seated a half hour later (one party, coincidentally at the empty table next to ours). If you don't plan on honoring reservations in a timely fashion, then you shouldn't be taking reservations in the first place. This is unacceptable. The manager greeted and checked in with every party on the floor except mine. We didn't feel welcomed whatsoever to have a meal here. Not to mention the food wasn't that spectacular. I have never eaten a steak that was that unseasoned, tough (I ordered it rare...), and bland. The couple next to us (who was seated after us), received their desserts before we did. We had to rush through the entire meal (and rush to our next event, which we ended up being late for), because the timing was so off. To top it off, the bill came out completely wrong, and I had to waste more time waiting for the staff to fix it.

It was kind of tough and not very juicy.

The bacon. Mmmm. It was a single piece of thick cut bacon, almost steak like, with a maple glaze and almost melted in my mouth. The creamed corn was not your average corn from a can either. It was only mildly creamy, and had bacon. My entree was fried chicken with a chili pepper sauce, so tasty and unusual (also I'm a big sucker for a good piece of fried chicken) and not too greasy.

3.0,12/12/2015,"This restaurant looks really nice and cool from the outside but i was very disappointed with it overall.Stopped by on a friday night at around 730 and the place was full! Luckily we had reservations.  Everything started out well, the service here is excellent!  One of those places where you take a sip of water and then someone comes and immediately refills it for you.  Ok maybe that is a bit of an overstatement but you get what i mean.  They fold your napkin for you when you leave the table type of place.  Anyways, the biscuits that come out in the beginning were delicious! Im not a big biscuit person but everyone at the table loved them.  They had bits of veggies and grains in them which was pretty cool.  On to the food.  we had a table of six so we ordered a few of the sides (all sides sold separately) for the table and then we each ordered our own steaks. I opted for the filet mignon.  It was ok.  The cook was perfect(medium rare) but in terms of flavor, i was not impressed. And for $46, i was expecting a lot more.  The sides were interesting.  My favorite was the brussels sprouts of all things.  It had an asian flavor to it and came with onions as well.  A MUST TRY! If you can make brussels sprouts taste good..youre definitely doing something right, right? The twice baked potatoes were just ok for me.  The potato part inside with the cheese was tasty but the skin tasted old :( since the skin is my favorite part i was a little sad about this.  Overall this place deserves four stars.  The service is amazing.  Everyone was so nice and helpful from the waiters to the busboys.  Like i said a little expensive but thats to be expected.  My issue here was how the night ended.  At around 1030 we were asked to leave.  We had only just finished eating and paid the tab when someone came by our table and asked us to leave.  They were very nice about it do not get me wrong.  But there was just no need for it.  We are visiting from California and were having dinner with some friends we rarely get to see.  We were taking some time to catch up after eating and then we were asked to leave? Pretty rude in my opinion.  There was no one waiting outside to be seated and there were a few other open tables in case a party came in at the last minute.  The restaurant closed at 11 so I'm sure they were not expecting a huge rush or anything.  And the place was full enough to where they would definitely be staying around until after 11.  So what was the need to ask us to leave?  That honestly just left a bad taste in my mouth so I do not think I will ever be back.",1,1,0,Maricela V.,"Los Angeles, CA",242,212,80

Ordered it medium rare and it came out medium rare. Served with caramelized onions and beer cheese on a light and crunchy bun. The burger comes with a few sticks of French fries which was the only superfluous thing on the plate (fries are also stuck directly into the ketchup container, which makes them soggy, not sure why they do this).  Also ordered the tater tots, which were hands down the best tots we've had yet. Handmade, piping hot, super crispy, with a sprinkling of salt on top. The only criticism I have of the tots is that I expected slightly more of them, especially for $8 an order (at happy hour pricing too). Ended our meal with the crackerjack sundae -- which was to die for, a perfect blend of salty, sweet, and crunchy!For drinks, we got an Old Fashioned which was delicious and very well crafted with house made bitters, that make it a slightly milder version.  We also asked to be surprised with a sweet, citrusy mocktail - they delivered with an orange-y drink, great except the $10 price tag that came with it (higher than we expected for a non-alcoholic drink).Overall excellent food and excellent service.

(no idea how). Perfectly cooked- a bit heavy on the pepper for me but good.  Sides were the spinach which was excellent- aged potatoes which looked better than they tasted.  They were fabulous that they did not rush us- but we were only a few tables in the restaurant.  They were out of the one dessert we wanted so we skipped it.Décor is 80's upscale steakhouse- but I liked it a lot- great music in the background.,1,1,0,Amal S.,"New York, NY",57,286,16

The steak was cooked to what we wanted of medium rare and was super juicy. As for their desserts, the AC Carbomb and their more popular Crackerjack sundae were both perfect ends to a filling meal.

I'll be honest with you guys the though of sprouts usually makes me queezy but they really make love to this dish, I never though I would ever like brussel sprouts.  The *AGED POTATOES was a great side too, as well as *SUNCHOKED SPINACH.  We started off the night with raw bar... the oysters and shrimp cocktail were so good, I love their horseradish sauce....",0,0,0,Alicia L.,"Manhattan, NY",321,162,193
4.0,11/11/2015,"A friend and I came here just to try the burger. We arrived a little before 5:30pm because we knew that there is a limited amount available. I checked their Twitter feed and there were only 5 available on the day that we went. To get the burger, we were told you have to sit in the bar area, which was actually really nice and comfortable, as well as still easy to talk with the person I came with. The chairs were high up and the seats were pleasantly cushioned. We made sure to order our burgers right away. The burgers came out beautifully! It is made with deliciously gooey cheese covering the meat (mix of brisket, short rib and dry aged rib eye), along with caramelized onion. It was very tasty... I loved the cheesiness of it and the meat was perfectly tender, while the onions added to the wonderful savory flavor. Definitely one of the better burgers I have ever had. There were a few french fries on the side, which were pretty good - crispy and great potato flavor. It almost didn't bother me that the amount of fries were minuscule because the burger filled me up. Service was top notch and it was fun to watch the bartenders make the Old Fashioned drink, which is made by torching the glass on a wooden panel, adding a huge piece of ice in then the alcohol. The smell was quite intoxicating -- in a good way.",15,13,13,Kathy X.,"Queens, NY",783,438,5876
5.0,11/10/2015,"American Cut Is the real deal!I went to this steakhouse for a friends birthday having high expectations because it is owned by Iron Chef Marc Forgione and it did not disappoint.When you walk in there is a large bar/lounge area which is nice while you wait for the rest of your party to arrive.After moving out of the bar area into the dinning area the ambiance complete changes and playing some old school music classic. There was six of us and it was a birthday so we went all out getting the surf and turf as well as the 52 day age steak (which is not on the menu), stuffed potatoes, fries, and the Cesar salad because we figured we need to eat some greens with all the meat we are about to get.Before we got our salads we got these everything biscuits which were amazing and made fresh. These biscuits let you know the food is only going to get better. When the salad arrived it was cut up right infront of us along with making fresh Cesar salad. Which was one of the best Cesar salads I have ever had.Now all we needed was the main course but I'm the mean time we were sipping on our bourbon. When the main course arrived it came in fashion. Out on a push cart with a hot top where they made a fresh dressing for the steak which you can see in the video. Everything was absolutely amazing it was tender, juicy, full of flavor. I couldn't have ask for a better dinner. After finishing the meal we got a Cracker Jack Popcorn Sundae for our friends birthday so he could blow out a candle. This was nice sweet touch to end the night and is must if you come here.In the end this has been one of the best steakhouses I have ever been to because of the friendly staff amazing food and great service.",68,37,56,Jon W.,"New York, NY",3020,302,1053

We ordered drinks, apps for the table, a couple bottles of wine, lots of sides and everyone had their own main plus a huge birthday cake.  The server was pleasant but shameless in trying to get us to order more. I shared the porterhouse for two.  It came out cooked a perfect medium rare as we asked. The flavor was good but the texture was a little disappointing.  The fat streaks were so tough and sinewy it was hard to even get a steak knife through it.  For $109 bucks, I'd expect better.  The sides were ok and pretty standard with the addition of spaghetti squash that sounded good but was pretty bland. Overall it's a kinder, gentler steakhouse with more thought than usual going to ambiance and style, but I've had better meat at the bar at Wollensky's.  Go if you're on expense account but otherwise I'd skip it.",0,1,0,Jennifer B.,"New York, NY",2,90,2

4.0,10/27/2015,"I started this review 2 years ago and I have probably been to American Cut over 5 times for various reasons since then. Birthday Party, Steak dinner with the guys, Business Lunches/Dinners, Afterwork drinks... etc... I wouldn't put American Cut on the exact same tier of a Peter Lugars, Smith and Wollensky's or a Keen's... There is no ""old school"" vibe. It's a new age American Steakhouse in the realm of a STK or a BLT. The menu serves the classics w/ a variety of cuts including various Wagyu and Kobe cuts with new twists. Weekdays: You will find a more corporate crowd... Citigroup, Goldman Sachs etc are all very nearby so you will find a good amount of business dinners with suits wheeling and dealing going on from the hours of 5:30pm-9pm. The place certainly slows down a bit as most places do afterwards - I will note there is never a drop off on table service even at peak hours. That being said - a Thursday night will always be much more crowded then a Monday or Tuesday.Weekends: I haven't been on a weekend but I expect this crowd to be less corporate and more dinner parties/date groups. You will have an occasional sighting of a celebrity of some sorts - Marc Forgione owns the restaurant and you might also see him somewhere on the floor when he is there.  The vibe over is classy as a new modern age steak restaurant would be feel but a bit sleepy when I am in there for some reason.   Drinks - Get the Smoky Old Fashion. End of story. It's not a cheap drink (~$16) but it is skillfully crafted by the bartenders. The wine list is pretty extensive and well... steakhouse priced accordingly.. a good variety in vintage of Caymus, Borolo's etc as you would want when eating a heavier meal and red meats.I've been lucky enough to have had every cut of meat here but I would rank the Wagyu/Kobe at the top in regards to super-cuts but the Pastrami Spiced is certainly a nice twist to a classic NY Cut. It's not for everyone as some prefer the classic all natural flavor of a good steak but it's nice to switch it up sometimes and definitely worth it. The Tomahawk Ribeye cut is 'big' as you would expect (42oz... but the bone takes up a large portion of it... so value wise... not really). All steaks were perfectly cooked so no issues from that end. The Chili Lobster is also another signature dish here - In fairness it's awesome and slightly priced above where it should be for the portion size but if you're in the mood to splurge a bit - go for it... you definitely wont be disappointed in the flavors.I would recommend coming if you want to switch from the classic steakhouse and have a bit of variety in the sides and other dishes. American Cut is pricey ($$$$) as you would expect for a steak house attached with a celebrity chef name. This place is good for business dinners, night out with the boys or out of towners. I personally would not bring a date here for a romantic vibe - although it is a bit more on the trendy side if your going to steakhouse...",1,1,0,Tim K.,"Manhattan, NY",192,26,0

Definitely one of the best happy hour deals that I've encountered! We supplemented our $1 oysters with chili lobster rolls ($14 each), and they were very tasty as well. If you're looking for a large lobster roll like you would find at Luke's or elsewhere, be warned - these are more refined lobster rolls. The lobster is served on ""housemade buns"", and by buns, they mean two slices of bread smaller than the iPhone 5.

We ordered the chilled lobster for the appetizer and OMG it was amazing! Full of flavor and spices and just simply mouthwatering! For entrees, we order the pastrami based rib eye and the short ribs. Both meals were simply delectable! The short ribs gracefully fell off the bone and were filled with suck flavor. The rib eye was so tender and juicy and definitely a must try!

Regarding the food, I'm just going to preface this with the background that my palate is pretty basic and that unnecessary fancy names to describes things I've eaten before in a way to impress me but only adds confusion isn't my thing.

So the main dining room is the show, but unfortunately size limitations may wind up having you seated in purgatory--outside the main dining room in an off the bar area. Seating is randomThere are some interesting dishes like chili lobster that tantalize and remind you this is a Marc Forgione place, although they might due to size leave you hungry.  The problem here are the steaks. There are a selection of wet and dry aged, but the steaks are very tough, difficult to cut and lack flavor.Desserts are in a word fun.Wine list is obscene by almost any standard. Some basic bottles marked up 4 times.While there is excess staffing at every position, not a manager to be found in the place. So service suffers despite the excess staffing. They would be better off reducing staff and getting a floor manager, as service at the front, the bar and in the dining room left a lot to be desired. So this place is an enigma.

It was good, but I only tasted the vegetables in the dough.Jim Brady Oysters - very rich and tasty. The cheese definitely complements the oyster well. Hanger Steak - I ordered it medium rare and they delivered just that. The meat was chewy and not under or overcooked, though the thinner end did get a little burnt on the outside. The pastrami spice also worked quite well with the steak. However, I do wish the presentation was better because it was served as slices of meat sitting in a pool of its own juices. Potato Puree and Sunchoke Spinach - both were very creamy and were good accompaniments to the steak. I loved how the little pots made it easy to share.Blueberry Bread Pudding - it was served warm and the lemon elevated the buttery and blueberry flavors of the bread pudding. It was a nice small treat to end the meal with.

While I am not a steak connoisseur but I do enjoy steak once in a while; personal quota of once every three months to be exact. Upon arrival, we could not stop complimenting how classy and sophisticated the ambiance was. If you are looking to impress or a place for intimate celebrations, look no further.My sister and I opt in for the Restaurant Week which we both got Jim Brady Oysters, Hanger Steak, a side, and the infamous Cracker Jack Sundae. Complimentary biscuits were served first with vegetable cream cheese. The bi  scuits were covered with black and regular sesame seeds. It was crunchy on the outside and super duper buttery soft on the inside. Vegetable cream cheese was great add-on, though I thought it was butter at first. Jim Brady Oysters were baked and it was quite tasty with the hints of truffle oil. Hanger Steak was pastrami spiced and smoked. I do love the taste of pastrami spice and never thought it could work on the hanger steak. Steak was cooked into perfection of medium that I asked for and still so chewy. My sister both ordered the only two sides to share which was the Potato Puree and Sunchoke Spinach. Both sides are served in a tiny pot and the server mixes the condiments in front of us. Potato Puree was pretty much like mashed potato. Smooth texture and mixed with butter. Sunchoke Spinach had the right amount of sea salt. Both sides complements the Pastrami Hanger Steak. Cracker Jack Sundae just simply blew me away. Ice cream drizzled with caramel sauce and topped with Cracker Jack popcorn. It was the perfect end to our meal. While I agree that some people have doubts about Restaurant Week with good reason but I have to say this is one of the better choices. The three-course meals here really gave a fantastic sample overview of American Cut's creativity and identity. It is definitely worth coming back even when it's not Restaurant Week.

Was it the best steak I ever had, no but the Tomahawk Ribeye for two was cooked to perfection (mid rare).  It was a very nice atmosphere, I must say a little louder than other steakhouses I have been to, it was dark with a lot of wood the way a steakhouse needs to be.  I started with the Caesar Salad hands down one of the best, only down side is I had to ask for fresh black pepper it was not offered.  For the table we had the slab bacon appetizer it was on par with all other steakhouses.   As I said before the ribeye was great and cooked perfectly.  I was worried about the pastrami spices they use on it (rib eye for me is salt and pepper only, it's about the steak not the seasoning) but it worked well, it did not make it better but it worked better than I thought.  Sides we had the cauliflower (this was my favorite) it had onions and capers simply great!! Creamed spinach and asparagus.  Everything was real good.

The decor is a little dark (or at least a little too dark for a party of four guys going out for a nice dinner.  Good date spot though.  Servers were prompt, friendly, and gave good recommendations.  The bacon appetizer was delicious.  The creamed spinach and potato sides were quite good as well.At this point, everything I've said above is almost expected for a high-end steakhouse, right?  Here are the difference-makers:Con: the pastrami-spiced rib eye... just something was off. Our whole table ended up getting it based on the server's recommendation.  The meat itself was tender, but the spices weren't really carrying over into the meat itself.  One of my friends had to request salt for his steak! Though I didn't think it was that extreme, I could sense just a lack of salt to the steak.  Ironically, the sides (though I said were quite good) were just a tad on the salty side.Pro: the bread is amazing. seriously amazing. loved it.Pro: we ordered an old-fashioned-esque cocktail with wood smoked into the glass. I was afraid it was too gimicky, but it actually was an excellent way to enhance the drink.  Fantastic.Overall it's a great place and I'd definitely come back!",1,0,0,Arthur A.,"Rego Park, NY",176,389,2

5.0,7/25/2015,"Best Ever Restuarant Week!Hands down best meal offer and quality for RW in New York City. Plus the all important service top notch. I had just returned from a 4 day trip to Chicago which allowed us to taste several low and high restuarants in the Windy City. None could compare with the reduced price RW offer of American Cut. They also have a beautiful lower dining area which I noticed was open for sitting I think for the RW overflow. Not to sound like a late night TV ad but run don't walk to American Cut because you will need the exercise considering the amount of quality food you are about to be offered. I am originally born and raised in Chicago but the city has a ways to go in terms of customer service especially in ""Rick Bayless"" establishments. I'm not sure why well known Chefs like Rick Bayless can't get service right. My guess is they don't eat or rather allow themselves to have the customer experience.

3.0,7/22/2015,"Went for my birthday dinner, and would probably never go again. For starters the restaurant was so loud on a Tuesday night.  Very loud.  And my boyfriend and I were sitting so far away from each other (the tables are long).  The waiter was very smart and catty with us.  He knew it was my birthday, and barely said happy birthday.  Didn't sing to me.  Didn't offer to bring a dessert out.  Nada. My boyfriend and I were impressed by the everything seasoned biscuits, and the bacon we ordered as an app.  The bacon was cut so thick, so juicy, and caramelized. Yum. I ordered the filet - which was good; not great.  My boyfriend got the strip which he described as ""a background dancer. Not the star of the show.""

One of our party had fish which was slightly over cooked.Overall at this price point the overall quality of the food should have been better.   It feels like the kitchen is trying too hard.  Probably won't go back, too many other places to get a great steak in the big city.",0,0,0,Eileen F.,"Manhattan, NY",4,9,0
3.0,7/19/2015,"At first glance, this restaurant really excited me. It's really hard to find hanger steak in traditional steakhouses, but that night I had a craving for one of my favorite cuts. When you first walk into American Cut, the bar ambiance is dark, sexy, and candlelit. To the left is the dining room. It's spacious, with ample room between the tables. The general service and food was good, but there were a few things that marred our experience. We wanted a small side green salad with our entrees, and we emphasized small. What arrived was a huge salad with goat cheese hidden underneath the greens. Why didn't the waiter inform us that cheese is served standard with the salad? Also, we were charged for an ""entree salad,"" and when we brought this up to our server he gave us a meek shoulder shrug and sorry, without offering to rectify. To top it all off, I have never been served a steak with that much blood and oil on the plate. Did the chef not let the meat rest after cooking? I felt cheated of the tenderness and flavor. One of the first things I learned in culinary school was, you let your meat rest for at least 5 minutes to let the juices redistribute. Please pass this on to the chef! I prefer Dylan Prime around the corner.",4,1,2,Opal T.,"Atlanta, GA",306,238,475
5.0,7/16/2015,"I have to say, I honestly do not write many reviews.  Like most people I have to get pretty pissed off to lug my ass to a computer and go all ""HOW DARE YOU"" on a place.  And they pretty much have to be the second coming for me to remember to lug my ass to the computer to write a good review.  Well American Cut is the second coming of steakhouses for me.  NY has a decent array of notable meat purveyors.  For a town that doesn't have a slaughterhouse on the outskirts, we know our way around a t-bone.  So it's not like the last steak I murdered was from Longhorn or Outback.  The pastrami spiced, smoked ribeye I embarrassed myself over last night was the real deal.  The flavor, texture and preparation were all absolutely perfect.  It's a shame we have to call the supporting dishes something as reductive as ""sides"".  We chose the spinach with fontina and the aged potatoes with bacon.  Bacon, that's another thing.  If anyone asks you if you would like ""bacon on top of that"" just say yes.  I don't care if it's the bathroom attendant.  Just say yes.  The bacon was AMAZING.And the dessert is not a sad little cart of stale afterthoughts like they wheel out at other steakhouses.  The blueberry thingy and the crackerjack sundae, both had two grown assed 6ft 3 inch men swooning.  Seriously our eyes were rolling back in our heads and we were doing that little moan.  You know the one.  Like when your mom is eating her good chocolates.I actually went to American Cut intending to try the not so secret, ""secret burger"" everyone has been talking about.  It's only served at the bar so I had to have that awesome ribeye instead.  So the secret burger is now an excellent excuse to go back asap, which I will be doing.I also have to say the waitstaff was incredibly friendly and helpful.  They made sure we had everything we needed to enjoy a phenomenal meal.",0,1,0,Jeff H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0
4.0,7/16/2015,"We received a gift card for American Cut at Christmas time and finally decided to give it a shot.  Mind you...the gift card didn't even cover third of our check, but it helped!  The atmosphere in the dining room is very nice, but dark.  I could have used a little more light in there.  The service was impeccable.  Everyone was so helpful and we never had to wait on anything.  Drinks kept flowing and the food kept coming.  I must say that their everything bagel biscuit is to die for!  I could have eaten that all night, but had to control myself since we had so much more food coming.  We started with the Chili Lobster for our appetizer, which was awesome.  Not very spicy, but had a little kick.  I believe my BF sopped up all the lobster juice with his bread until there was nothing left.  We opted for the special steak of the day which was the 52oz porterhouse aged 52 days.  What a show to watch the waiter make the garlic butter sauce at our table!  The steak was delicious and very tender, but I thought it was just a tad bit overcooked for a medium rare steak.  We chose the aged potato and the cauliflower for our sides, which were both delish!!  We didn't finish half of our food and had them wrapped up to take home, because we needed to leave room for dessert and the desserts didn't disappoint.  My BF had the Cherry pie, which was a special of the day and I had the Strawberry buckle.  OMG....I would go back to American Cut just for that Strawberry Buckle again!!  BEST DESSERT EVER.  With a few drinks for the BF, our bill came to over $350...yes, it's pricey, but worth the food and experience.  :)",0,0,0,Yukie P.,"Oceanside, NY",18,122,172
5.0,7/10/2015,"My boyfriend and I have been meaning to come here for a while and boy was it worth the wait.. American cut is def one of those places that makes you feel right at home. The hostess is nothing but a perfect example of how to make you feel comfortable the second you enter those TriBeCa doors. Now, I have turned into a pesceterian for the last month and so far so good. American cut didn't get in the way of that at all. All the seafood options were amazing!! We started with the infamous chili lobster. PLEASE do yourself the FAVOR! I don't know how I'm going to be able to function without that for the next couple of weeks. Anyway, for entrees I had the salmon and Andy the filet mignon. Our sides were asparagus, double baked potatoes and tator tots. Now, I eat salmon often but wowwww.. So delicious! I can't stress enough how pleased I was with everything! I was treated to a banana Jameson, my bro in law loves Jameson and I just can't even take the smell. The banana Jameson is a REVELATION people!! The smoothest drink ever and im already thinking of ways to copy this at home!Of course the popcorn sundae was ordered.. Again don't leave without trying this, I warped back to 5th grade somehow. Now we talk about the service there..GREAT! The vibe was awesome and the whole staff there was attentive from start to finish.

5.0,7/8/2015,"I have been remiss.  After my somewhat moderate review of American Cut, I have not yet updated on how awesome this place is as a happy hour spot.  The excellence here is two-fold. First of all, their drink specials include a smokey old-fashioned.  Which is basically an old-fashioned, done right, with a glass that is cupped over a burned maple wood board.  Gimmicky?  Perhaps.  But this really add an amazing scent that makes it all worth it, for a great happy hour price of $10.  Hey, a majority of what you taste comes from smell, right?Secondly, and actually more importantly, is their burgers here are best in class....in the world.  I will stand by the statement that there is no other place, that does a burger as well, and consistently as American Cut does.  I forget the exact combination, but it's some mixture of dry-aged steak trimmings, shortribs, beer cheese, and awesome bun.  You might feel a little bit underwhelmed by the 3 sticks of fries that come with the burger, but trust me, it's worth it.  If I were on my death bed, and someone told me I could only have a burger before I went....this would be it.",1,3,1,Dennis L.,"New York, NY",76,196,1
4.0,6/27/2015,"Americans, cut! Use your knives (engraved with the name of this restaurant), slice, chop, tear but most importantly cut your masterfully prepared cut of meat.Like the open plains of the North American continent, American Cut is spacious. From the downstairs bar to the cavernous main dining room, from the red wood forest to the Gulf stream waters, this restaurant was made for you and me.The sheer amount of space is reminiscent of casual dining restaurants like those in the Darden group, found in strip malls across the USA. To have such enormity in Manhattan is truly rare. I didn't miss the experience of literally rubbing elbows with fellow dinners (which nowadays more likely consists of zombified fingers of death scrolling across the almighty Screen) and value the privacy that this environment makes possible. If you want to feel like Jabba on his pleasure barge (or moghul emperor, khanate, Caligula type) do order the table side prepared old fashioned cocktail. For it's not enough to be brought an already made drink but instead you will have a fire show before your very eyes. Perhaps this trend of table prep taps into an unconscious power vibe of the mind, where like Kubla Khan of Xanadu, a stately pleasure-dome of alcohol is decreed and made before my eyes. Could I give a nod of disapproval and have the preparer sent to the lions? I do wonder...Anyway, the old fashioned is a very smoky old fashioned thanks to the wood on fire preparation technique. Large ice cube enthusiasts rejoice- there's an iceberg in your glass.The appetizers that we ordered were thankfully light and perfect for sharing. The crab cake's complement of Charleston slaw and onion remoulade stole the show, transforming lumps of crab into something inspiring. Chili lobster was roughly 1 and 1/4 pounds of cracked lobster floating about a sriracha infused sauce that demanded bread be dipped into it. Since this is American Cut and not French (sorry, baguettes) you're given texas toast for dipping. A creative combination that strikes all the right numbers of flavor.The main course presented a number of options of various degrees of uniqueness, depravity and gluttony. Since I had never seen a menu with a ""New York City Cut"" (not strip!) that's a bone-in rib eye dry aged for 30 days in pastrami spices, I had to order it.Pastrami spices? Yes and when taking my first bite it felt as if I were noshing on a pastrami sandwich more so than a steak. (But with knife and fork) It was a study in contrasts as the eyes showed me what looked like a steak, cut like a steak and sat on my plate like a steak. However, the aroma and contact with taste buds revealed a very different experience. Different isn't always bad and I regret nothing about my order. I enthusiastically finished every nibble, nook and cranny of this pastrami beef chimera  with glee. To address the question of a second time ordering, the answer is probably negative. I'm happy to have tried it but as a minor pastrami enthusiast, I'll have to pass. There are plenty of other tempting options to lure my appetite.For dessert, you'll observe a listing of items that merge the popular with the artistic, the low-brow with the intellectually deep. (Which probably does describe America best at times).  So you won't get an ice cream sundae, it's a crackerjack sundae. Want cake? It's candy bar cake. Want to blow people up? The unfortunately named ""AC Carbomb"" will send your dining companions to shreds.The crackerjack sundae was a refreshing dessert, especially after the previous pastrami intensity. Long spoon dipped into the sundae serving dish would reveal vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and caramel, with the occasional bit of crackerjack to liven things up. So American Cut is indeed a cut above the rest in terms of creativity and novel takes on the sometimes fossilized steakhouse experience. A sound track that features David Bowie over Sinatra earns points in my book, making American Cut a place that honors steakhouse tradition by trying to improve and innovate on it.

5.0,5/30/2015,"American Cut is Marc Forgione's latest venture which debuted in TriBeCa mirroring his Atlantic City establishment.The entrance of American Cut is muted in an understated color scheme of black and white. The establishment is substantially extensive. Bare bulbs are suspended from the ceiling. Each tremendous shade is kissed with an inner lining of brass foil and varnished with matte black cloth. The space is illuminated in a sultry dim lighting. Under the ceiling lined of raw, untouched wooden planks, are walls of exposed red brick. The sleek leather tapered seats flank the rich cherry-colored wood tables. We started off with Chili Lobster ($34) which is served with thickly-carved slices of golden French brioche. American Cut encourages diving in with your fingers; the entree is served with a bowl of water and paper-thin slices of lemon for your hands. A peninsula of tails and claws are surrounded by a sea of chili lobster stock. Small cull lobsters are utilized for this dish, which are much meatier than the norm. The stock is made with dry white wine, dense tomato paste, and creamy butter. It is flavored with shallots and flavored with a dash of combustible Sriracha. It is simplistically garnished with fresh leaves of mint. This dish is exceptional. Forgione's prime rib steak is dry aged with a pastrami rub. The NY Strip ($45) is simple, dredged with a mix of coarsely ground black pepper, granulated garlic, aromatic cloves, onion powder, and smoky paprika. The steak is flawlessly seasoned and perfectly seared after approximately a month of aging. The customer service is phenomenal and veritable. Each table is guaranteed to encounter at least half of the staff. Some pro tips: American Cut has a basement with plenty of seating for groups.

2.0,5/2/2015,"The nicest part of experiencing this place is how the restaurant looks inside.  Other than that, it lacks in very other category.  The restaurant itself is nicely decorated with marble floors, dim lighting, and comfortable leather seats.  Unfortunately the food is mediocre and the service is rushed and sub par in terms of what you should expect when you are paying top dollar at minimum $100 per person.  If you don't get there at the time of your reservation, they text message you and threaten to take away your reservation if you don't get there in 15 minutes. They did this to us, however surprise surprise, the place had at least 5-6 empty tables when we walked in.  In addition, they blast music so loud you can barely here the person sitting across from you.  Unless I'm at a rave concert, I don't want to have loud obnoxious oldies music blasting while I'm eating my expensive dinner.  It seems that the management is clueless when it comes to properly running a supposed high end restaurant.  Besides our waiter bringing the wrong dish, taking our plates away BEFORE we finished eating without even asking us or looking at our plates to see if we were done eating, the weirdest thing happened that I've never experienced before in a restaurant.  When our waiter brought us the dessert menus, he never came back to take our order or see if we needed anything.  Instead he abandoned us, and a new waiter came to take our order and told us that our other waiter was busy serving another table that just walked in.  So basically he figured let me work the table with more people and forget the two I was just serving because more people more money.  Having worked as a waiter myself, you never abandon any of your tables.  The tip you receive is for the service you provide.  If there is no service, why should you get tipped?  Needless to say we still tipped appropriately because we are human beings unlike our waiter.  Anyway, after drinking our coffee, the new waiter came by and took my friends napkin as my friend went to use the bathroom and then dropped off the bill without us asking for it or having finished our coffee either.  They basically rush you here.  They want your money as fast as possible and don't even care if you've finished your meal.  It's rude, unprofessional, and insulting.  Overall, American cut is one restaurant I'll be definitely ""cutting"" off my list of places to eat.",0,0,0,Billy G.,"SUNNYSIDE, NY",0,22,0
4.0,4/29/2015,"For the most part, steakhouses and I have a pretty neutral relationship. While I'm not a vegetarian by any means, there are other forms and preparations of beef that are more appealing... So when Restaurant Week rolled around for yet another season and I saw American Cut on the list, I took it as a sign that I needed to visit. I'd dined at Restaurant Marc Forgione nearly two years ago, so I'd kept up with news and reviews of American Cut; given the fair amount of positive feedback, I was fairly optimistic about making my reservation for a group of four on a weekend evening.Located near the west border of TriBeCa, American Cut is one of the few steakhouses in the neighborhood. The interior is dim, plush, and modern, a welcome venue for the post-work crowd, especially given its comfortable bar area. Once the last member of our party had arrived, we were led by our server into the dining room, and given menus and glasses of water. She made sure to point out the Restaurant Week menu available that evening, which offered a few options per course, all of which can be found on their regular menu.Although I was initially teased for ordering the ""boring"" Caesar Salad, I have to say that I made one of the better appetizer selections for the night. The dish is impressively presented at first, with all the ingredients layered into a large wooden bowl, with the stalk of romaine still intact. It's then chopped and mixed tableside before being plated separately. It's a simple, but well-executed, salad, featuring crisp lettuce, an aromatic Caesar dressing, pullman croutons, and a soft egg.As we were in a steakhouse, all of us wound up ordering the Hanger Steak as our entree. In a 9 ounce portion, it's by no means pedestrian, especially given the perfect medium-rare cook of the meat. The protein itself is delicious, juicy and with an innate flavor, and with just the right amount of char and a generous amount of pastrami spice and mustard seed, it's a carnivore's delight. We also had the option of a side dish, and the Potato Puree ""Robuchon"", which should be half butter and half potatoes (when correctly prepared), was a creamy, buttery, and much-needed complement to the steak.To finish: their Cracker Jack Sundae. I believe the dessert served during Restaurant Week was a modified (smaller) take on their traditional presentation, but a combination of ""popcorn ice cream"", complete with popcorn kernels, a caramel drizzle, and a final topping of whipped cream was the perfect sweet note to end the meal on. I have to commend American Cut on pulling off one of the more successful Restaurant Week services that I've yet to encounter. Many times, restaurants will cut corners in terms of food and service to accommodate the increased demand during these weeks, but this was clearly not the case here. The restaurant is well worth a visit, especially if you happen to be in the area, and if a corporate card is not readily on hand... well, that's what Restaurant Week is for.",13,6,15,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827
1.0,4/25/2015,"This is by far the worst restaurant experience  I have ever had in New York. I had an 8:45 reservation for 4 and arrived on time with my party. The hostess told us that our table was not yet ready and suggested hat we had a seat at the bar while we waited. By 9:45 we still had not been seated, despite having checked in with the hostess several times (actually, she rudely instructed us to ""have another drink"" and walked away). After another 15 minutes we were taken by another hostess in the opposite direction of everyone else down into the BASEMENT of the restaurant where ABSOLUTELY NO ONE ELSE was seated. The hostess, clearly trying to ""sell us"" on the area, told us that we were ""special"" and being taken to the most exclusive part of the restaurant where nobody else could go. Obviously, this was a room reserved for parties and private events. Someone came to take our drink order and told us not to worry and that all of the other people waiting at the bar would soon be seated down here as well, so we shouldn't be upset about being the only table in this ridiculous party room. Then the waiter gave us a bullshit story that this area was the new and exclusive part of the restaurant that was not going to be open to the public until the following week, and we were special because we were the only ones chosen to sit down here this evening. Each story contradicted the one before it. Every person had a different ridiculous story and lying to customers after making them wait over an hour for a table WHEN THEY HAD A RESERVATION is the absolute worst management of a restaurant that I have ever seen in my life. We obviously left and I can promise that I will never come back to any American Cut ever again. To top it off, the drinks we had were horrible and the basement/ bullshit exclusive new part of the restaurant/party area was filthy dirty, which can only mean that the rest of the restaurant can not possibly be clean either. There was also a horrendous stench coming from the bathrooms that spread to the rest of the restaurant.

4.0,4/18/2015,"I came here mainly because of this voucher someone had dropped off at my job. It was good for two complimentary cocktails at American Cut, and I kept it in my wallet for months and today just felt like the day to use it.The interior is really dark, it can actually be a little disorienting when you walk in off a bright sunlit street. The hostesses at the front are stunning. And they play great music, at least on an early Saturday evening (White Stripes, Florence and the Machine, a classic rock song I can't remember). They have a huge backlit photo of Muhammad Ali knocking some guy out behind the bar, and a surprisingly good selection of gin alongside the unsurprisingly good selection of whiskey. My friend ordered their cheeseburger ($14) and I ordered the chilie lobster ($34). Both were amazing. It comes with bread and butter pickles, a nicely toasted bun, and a single potato wedge. It was melt in your mouth tender, a blend of three different cuts of beef, and it came our practically rare. Just delicious. I don't even like cheese on my burgers. The chile lobster is the only dish featured in all three of their restaurants and its reputation is well deserved. Tail and claw piece in a slightly spicy, thick, creamy sauce with four pieces of Texas toast to soak up every last drop. I loved it. I had the Garden Daiquiri for my cocktail and it was interesting.

4.0,3/16/2015,"Definitely enjoyed my meal here!To start, I didn't really like the bartender.  I asked him a question about their signature drinks, and I found his answer to be short.  He didn't attempt to suggested anything else, or be accommodating.  Had he been. I may have tried a specialty drink, which I so much enjoy trying various cocktails at different places.  I stuck with my usual opener and switched to wine past appetizers.We ordered quite a bit of appetizers, their signature chili lobster, crabcake, and brussel spout salad.  The chili lobster had a nice kick, which I'm very much into, but the amount of meat per price was quite lacking.  The crabcake was quite tasty, and the salad was good, but nothing exceptional.My main dish was a bigger disappointment for me.  I like my steak as rare and it can go, beyond black and blue if possible.  And i understand this is a pretty hard temperature to achieve, but I kind of expect it when I go to a steakhouse, especially one with the caliber as this.  I would call my steak rare, and this just dampers my meal when it was what I was looking forward to most.  But the twice baked potato and carrot were good, the roasted onion...not at much.We did have the cracker jack sundae, which was a nice treat, but does not compare to the sundae at Ichabods!  If you're looking for a sensational dessert, my recommendation would surely be there!I do love tribeca, so will surely be back to the area looking for another great eatery.",1,1,1,Sarah L.,"Manhattan, NY",7,49,0
3.0,3/15/2015,"Great restaurant. The servers were nice and helped answer our questions. We had a great anniversary dinner, champagne, red wine (bf) Cesar salad (yummy) if you like Cesar you should definitely order this! We got the bus it's also with the veggie creamCheese (the biscuits were served warm and it was great for pre appetizer) I had filet Mignon and it was cooked, I asked for medium well, however they seemed to have lost track of time as the outside of my steak was a little burnt on the seasoning parts (I was concerned by that, not super mad just cut it off.) My bf had the Ny cut bone in ribeye and he enjoyed it, with added foie gras (too expensive for a little piece of foie gras). We had the dry aged potatoes and they were nice, just slid right onto the fork, the spinach was nice creamed spinach. We had the Guinness and Jameson dessert yummy! I was however upset that we called ahead made a reservation and my bf made sure to let them know that it was our anniversary, they didn't even offer to bring us any type of celebratory dessert. We had to order dessert and tell them, (I'm sure he was the manager who ended up taking our dessert order) that it was our 1 year, and they added a little touch adding (Happy 1 year) on the dessert plate, but come on we were spending over $200 already and you could give us a brownie or something for choosing your restaurant to celebrate our 1 year.

4.0,3/14/2015,"'The best steak I have even eaten', to quote my husband (and he's been to Wolfgangs & Mastros). We went last night for a special occasion. The surroundings were a delight, dimmed lights without being too dark and Art Deco accents. The service was impeccable. There was always someone there to check on you, fill your drink or available to ask any questions. We had an intro from our server of the specials and to highlight any signature dishes on the menu. He was really nice and really brought the dishes to life in his explanation, he spoke very passionately. We decided to skip appetizers and go for dessert instead. We started with the complimentary biscuits - amazing! I think it's the cream cheese that really brings them to life. So good & complimentary!! For our main dishes I ordered the filet mignon & my husband the NY strip. We then ordered fries & broccolini as side dishes. We also ordered the chili lobster to share. Both steaks were amazing! So tasty, without having a sauce and very tender. My filet, I ordered medium and it did have a bit of a chargrilled/burnt crisp to the outside, but apart from that it was excellent. The sides were very generous portion sizes and the fries were more like wedges and were thick cut, which are my favorite when I'm having steak! We found they cook their steaks heavy, so maybe consider ordering one temperature down, my husband ordered medium rare, but the steak was cooked more medium. Now the reason why I'm giving this restaurant a 4/5 was due to the chili lobster. It wasn't to my taste at all. The sauce was very overpowering that you couldn't actually taste the lobster, just the chili. There wasn't enough lobster either (at $34), there was more sauce and bread. We were very disappointed, especially considering this is a signature dish after their steaks. After the meal we shared a dessert & my husband had an espresso. We had the candy bar cake, which was rich and delicious and the ice cream amazing. If I hadn't been so full I probably would have appreciated it more! I had one of their gin cocktails, Calling Card, which was very refreshing and well presented. It was very nice.

Tried to go back on the spur of the moment some time later and no reservation to be had. So this week I made a reservation, one day ahead and again, WOW!

He explained the food well and his timing was impeccable. I hate to be rushed, interrupted or bugged while I dine. Actually now that I think of it our server on the first visit was pretty horrible about intruding and interuppting. Anyway Lou was none of that! We had a fabulous steak dinner, special aged porter for 2, the cauliflower awesome! The carrot presentation is only trumped by its taste! Potatoes here...not so much. Ive had the twice baked and the salt/vinegar fries and they were both quite dry. The wedge is a really nice twist on the norm. Did I forget the everything bread!!???? Well you won't! Look If this had been a bad experience I would be on here and everywhere burying this place, I don't play.

4.0,3/2/2015,"My third WInter 2015 RW pick! Steakhouses are always a good choice for value, in my opinion, when there's a promising prix fix menu in the mix. They were able to accomodate our giant group, and even gave us the private room. We all felt super important sitting around a giant table. The lighting is dim, very lounge-like, as some others have said. The decor is fairly minimal--there's a downstairs bar area in addition to the upstairs dining area. I thought the food was good, albeit a little heavy. The cheesy bread rolls they start you out with are filling, and very good.  The appetizers included baked oysters with cheese (yum... sorry, arteries), caesar salad, or bacon. Our party got a variety of the choices, and they all looked delicious. The entrees were a hanger steak (9 oz), planked salmon, and bell & evans chicken. All but one in our party got the steak (one person got salmon). The default is medium, but I asked for mine medium rare, figuring that I was, for once, at a very high-quality steakhouse. My mouth is watering just thinking about the steak, which is seasoned with pastrami spice and lightly smoked, and goes great with their house steak sauce. It also came with a choice of side--pureed potatos, or pureed spinach. The spinach was amazing--it tasted like the dip that comes with appetizers that you always consider eating by itself but feel obligated to actually dip something in it besides your spoon. The steak turned out to be perfect, but the medium-rare was on the rarer side, and by the end of the steak, it was a little too bloody for me. But the flavor was great. The meat was fresh, tender, delicate, and infused with flavor.  For dessert, there were two choices--the candy cake (flourless chocolate cake), or cracker jack ice cream. Both were great. Finishing off such a rich meal with an even richer chocolate cake might have been a small mistake (I got uncomfortably full), but it was so worth it. Our waiter was warm and friendly, always checking in and asking if there was ""anything you would love to enjoy?"" I thought that was a nice touch, and a fine sign of high-end server training.

The seating was a little awkward as it was a booth but an open table concept so I was facing the guy across from me who wasn't even in my party. But I got over that pretty quickly as soon as those everything biscuits came my way. Holy smokes. I don't care what kinda diet you're on, eat those - hell have 2 like I did. Everything biscuit - so basically the seasoning from an everything bagel served warm, filled with scallions and accompanied along with some loving cheddar scallion cream cheese. Uhhh yes please. Apps - there were three options, I decided to really just go for it and get the cut of bacon. Not sorry. This isn't a piece of bacon from your local bodega when you're hung over Saturday morning - this is fancy, melt in your mouth bacon. Entree - steak/chicken/salmon. When at a steak house ... don't be a dingus get the steak. Okay fine unless you don't eat meat. 9 oz Hanger steak seasoned with Pastrami spice and their house sauce. I got mine medium, next time I would maybe go a little more well since it was a little bloody. But .... dy-na-mite. This is also about the time I was eating my second biscuit - again not sorry.

When you walk in, you find yourself in a very comfortable place, warmly greeted & seated. I absolutely love the ambiance here. Tables are spaced apart with enough breathing room for everyone, the booths make you want to stay all night. The music is notably appropriate too - good ol' american classics. Love it.To start it all off on the right, I recommend splurging on their version of an Old Fashioned. It is made tableside and will surely impress you and whoever you are with. Or if you like a simpler well-made cocktail, I really enjoyed the Calling Card.But let's talk about the food. The everything biscuits are to die for. I couldn't resist devouring this, fearful that I'd fill up but oh well! Then we had a raw dish and the bone marrow as starters. Yum and yum. And the steaks were absolute perfection. I had the hangar with chimichurri sauce on the side. It didn't even need a sauce, it was so flavorful on its own. If you are on the fence about sides, try the latkes - they are incredible!By the time dessert rolls around, you're probably saying, ""no, i couldn't possibly."" Oh but yes, you CAN!

Then we got the ribeye steak with wild mushroom, baked potato, creamed spinach, mashed potato and cauliflowers(?) as sides. Everything was great. The steak wasn't that fatty so the foie gras that was served with it complemented the meat very well. In my opinion, the appetizers were better than the steak. As for dessert, we ordered the black and blonde cake. I like the burnt sugar and the presentation was nice. They also gave us a round of their version of root beer float made with club soda on the house, which was yummy.

4.0,1/27/2015,"I came here with some co-workers after work on a Thursday night and it was exactly what I was expecting being located in Tribeca.  It has a more ""sceney"" atmosphere for a steakhouse (sat next to Jason Williams - former Duke star) and it just had an overall trendy vibe.We got there right on time for an 8:30 reservation after multiple text messages were sent out to us from the restaurant stating the table would be given away should we not show up on time.  We patiently waited for our table at the bar and were not seated until about 9:15, but were comped one round of drinks as a form of compensation which was nice.  Getting to the food, we started with an assortment seafood towers and spreads which were all fresh and excellent.  For our entrees, we did a mix of Tomahawks and Surf & Turf specials that were all cooked to perfection.  The sides all accompanied the meats very well and Marc Forgione does another great job with this place.  The price was very reasonable with a couple rounds of cocktails and bottles of wine for a steakhouse and I would highly recommend it.Buon appetito.",2,1,1,Marco M.,"Manhattan, NY",447,503,263
5.0,1/26/2015,"The best steak restaurant I have been to. I loved how the classic menu stables were given a modern eclectic twist, satisfying my steak craving. Loved the decor bringing elements of art deco style, while chic and warm setting the right mood for the night.I don't like seeds and their bread option were biscuits with seeds, with that said they were extremely accommodating replacing it with their texas toast. I thought that was a very nice gesture showing that making my experience memorable was a high priority. The appetizers ordered were the Octobus and Chili Lobster, taste beyond words. Octopus and lobster both perfectly cooked with exuding flavors, definitely a must-try. Always a fan of filet, I have recently been craving steak with more flavor and opted for their hanger instead (adding chimichurri to accompany it). Nervous at first, the cut was very tasty making up for the additional work it took to eat versus the filet. Not a huge fan of dessert (I like savory more than sweet) I ordered the Crackerjack ice cream and passion fruit sorbet. Very tasteful and helped finish the meal nicely. Loved the place so much I am dragging my husband back in two weeks (he loved it too!), and this time ordering the New York City Cut. After reading an article on its preparation by the very talented Marc Forgione I hope it taste better than it looks (the photos make it look amazing).

4.0,1/23/2015,"Ambience:  It reminded me of That 70's Show hitting the lottery.  Furniture and decor was something our parents coveted during the 70's but couldn't afford.  Seating was extremely spacious, i'm pretty sure I could have fit another guest in my single chair.  The lighting was dim but I was still able to properly identify all of the tenants on my plate.  Service:  We showed up at 8:10 for our 8:15 and was told we would be seated at 8:15.  At 8:20 the hostess came over to apologize for the wait.  At 8:30 the hostess explained that the current occupants of our table were still taking their time settling their bill and apologized again.  At 8:40 we were offered free drinks from the bar.  At 8:45 we were told that we would be ""taken care"" of for our wait.  We were finally seated at 9pm.  During our wait, we were comfortably seated and apologized to over and over again which made the seemingly long wait go by rather quickly.  I understand that sometimes restaurants are over booked and some guests tend to overstay their welcome.  The hostess handled this beautifully by letting feel that seating us was a priority for her.  Once seated, our server also apologized for the wait.  During our meal, the health inspector decided to show (what a night) and our main course was delayed for a few more minutes.  Our server was just as apologetic and generous and brought us drinks from the bar for our trouble.  In the end we were offered 2 rounds of drinks from the bar and free dessert for something almost all NYC diners experience on a regular basis.  High Five to the staff here for going above and beyond! Food: TABLE BREAD WAS AMAAAAAZING!! APP - Brussel Sprouts Salad:  Despite my dining partner giving me a death stare for ordering salad as our share app I couldn't resist the words ""brussel sprouts"".  I love brussel sprouts and this salad definitely did not disappoint.  It was sweet, salty and flavorful.  The textures were chewy, crunchy, and soft.  Every quadrant of our palette were doing a happy dance as the salad passed through our mouths.  The only downside to this salad was having to share it.  MAIN - Tomahawk Ribeye Chop:  (Let me preface this by stating that I am not a true carnivore.  Although I enjoy the occasional steak its definitely not my first choice on most nights.)  The steak is bone in, or more like Flinstone - bone in.  It was seasoned well and cooked perfectly. Although the meat was tasty it was a bit too fatty for me. My carnivorous friend said she enjoyed the steak but felt that it could have been a little bit more tender (she was comparing to Quality Meats).  We added on a side of the chimichurri sauce which wouldn't have been missed if we hadn't gotten it.  SIDES - The only side we ordered was the twice baked potato which I definitely recommend.  It comes with 3 potatoes stuffed with mashed potatoes drizzled in truffle oil and a bit of cheddar on top.  It was delicious and personally I may have enjoyed this more than the steak!  DESSERT -   DEFINITELY get the cracker jack sundae.  Vanilla ice cream topped with caramel coated popcorn.  It was divine and it was a recurring dish floating to most of the tables in the dining room.  In conclusion:  Happy Belly, not so happy but understanding Wallet.  :)",1,0,1,Jannie C.,"Closter, NJ",10,2,0

Real estate comes at a premium, to keep the bill manageable, we had steaks and sides.  We skipped appetizers since we had snacked somewhere else beforehand.  We chose not to have any drink for us because the prices were quite high.  This isn't the typical classic NY steak, the steak here can be dressed up with egg, bacon, bone marrow, foie gras, and chili lobster.  A great steak should not be topped by anything except a little salt (and maybe pepper).  The cauliflower side was the highlight of our meal.If it was my choice I probably wouldn't return here again, though I know the experience is completely different on someone else's dime.",2,3,1,Jenny L.,"Queens, NY",95,191,288

Like the cracker jack sundae.  The food was very good, though.  For apps we had oysters, shrimp, and tuna tartare.  For dinner, we had roasted chicken and ribeye steak.  The steak and roasted chicken were phenomenal.  The service was excellent - we had a very attentive wait staff.  I do not think this is a place for a 16th birthday however, but we came here because a family member had a friend who works at the establishment.  I definitely want to come back here and try other options on the menu.",1,0,0,Dirien F.,"Bay Shore, NY",87,30,0
3.0,12/18/2014,"This rating is based almost entirely on the preparation of the steak... $44 for a 10 oz piece of meat decorously called a ""filet mignon"" HAS to be perfectly cooked!  I ordered it medium-rare, and as I started slicing my way in, it was pretty clear it was medium-well, with only a bit of pink in the center.  Meanwhile my friend's steak (also a medium-rare) looked like that cow that gets severed in half when the dome drops down on Chester's Mill.  But I didn't complain.. as I gnawed through it, it slowly got bloodier and bloodier, and at one point medium-rare was achieved, but by the end of it, it was rare and bloody.  It was like the cook just flung it on the grill on one side, ignored it, and when it was time to serve, quickly charred the top and sprinkled on a bunch of spices so it looked all fancy.Otherwise - this is a really cool restaurant, has a sleek, modern feel to it but still retains steakhouse credibility.  It kind of screams ""dude's 30th birthday dinner"" and indeed there was one of those going on next to us.  The service was classy and attentive, so no complaints there.But you gotta cook them steaks right!  They're $44!!!",0,0,0,L.

There is something happening on every corner, so like I said, around the corner to American Cut.My friend arrived and we sat down in the bar area and ordered drinks. Great atmosphere, it was early so the noise level was muted and we were there to talk business so it worked out just fine.

I came to the yelp page to see if anything was listed about a corkage fee so that I can look into the next reservation that I would like to make, and was surprised at the poor ratings other guests have given. I'm basing this only on the two visits that I've been here but every time we walk in, we feel like a regular and like I said, I've been here twice. My fiancé and I work at a competitor (They didn't know this until we paid the bill on our first visit) but during that first visit the service was wonderful, nicely paced, we never felt rushed. We absolutely LOVE the old fashion and sometimes come here for just that. The everything biscuits are fabulous and our favorite starter is the steak tartare. The Porterhouse which we normally share is always cooked to perfection and seasoned just right. The cauliflower is BEYOND AMAZING. Their sommelier was kind and listened to what we wanted and pointed us in the direction of something wonderful. On my second visit, I came with my best friend and the amount of hospitality was unparalleled. Its what we expect especially working in the same industry and we certainly weren't disappointed.  My dear friend had also only been here once before after hearing about our experience but obviously left a big impression. The sommelier recognized him and brought us a glass of champagne to start. Automatically feeling like the most important table in the room, the couple next to us kept asking who we were, which made us giggle. Everything was 5 star. We always look forward to coming here.

5.0,10/2/2014,"We showed up to this restaurant at 9:15PM for a 9:30 reservation. No problem! We were seated immediately on a somewhat ""wet"" Wednesday night.  Despite the lousy weather, the place was pretty crowded.  Mostly males with a handful of gorgeous females.  Lots of suits, no one was wearing sneakers and everyone was sipping on whiskey.Luckily we were dressed the part, *phew*.  As all the reviews have mentioned the ""everything biscuits"" and the ""everything"" butter were incredible.  I've never had anything like it!  They're very dense and filling though, so if you don't have much of an appetite, try to resist eating the whole thing.  I'm not a huge pastrami fan, but I got convinced in to ordering the NY Cut steak with their pastrami seasoning.  My wife wasn't particularly hungry but she anticipated scoring a few bites from my plate and was lured in by the Chilli Lobster, so she ordered that as her entree (it's supposed to be an appetizer OR a topping for your steak).  We also got a side of wild mushrooms and polenta for the table(one side is good for two people easily).They dropped off our chilean pisco sour and bacon apple boom(made with vodka infused vodka)... both were excellent.  About 15 minutes later, we got our food.  WOW... the ribeye looked amazing but it didn't make my mouth water the way the chilli lobster did...simply beautiful!  I cut in to my NY Cut steak and the knife went through like it was butter.  I am a ""medium"" person, but this particular steak should be ordered medium rare, which I did.  The meat almost melts in your mouth.  My wife said it's the best that she's ever had, but I beg to differ.  The chilli lobster was roughly a 1.5lb lobster that was cut up so it's relatively easy to pull out of the shell without getting your fingers messy.  They did give us a finger bowl with the dish JUST in case though.  The huge slices of buttery texas toast went very well with the dish and all of the slices dissapeared :).  The chilli curry/sauce or whatever you want to call it was outstanding.  My wife and I constantly joked about how we wanted to order some white rice so we could eat it with the sauce.... we would do it if no one was looking :-D.The wild mushrooms/polenta were really good. Half way through eating the polenta, we introduced some of the chili lobster sauce to it and made it 1000X better.The dessert menu was incredible. It's very rare when you go to a restaurant and every single dessert item on the menu looks amazing.  We ended up getting the AC car bomb, I'm not too sure what the AC means, but I'm guessing it means ""alcoholic""?  I definitely felt a little bit a of a buzz after eating it lol.  The chocolate bread pudding was delicious, the bananas foster was a nice compliment to it and the Guinness ice cream was superb.Along with the check, they gave us some peanut butter and jelly marshmallows.......very interesting indeed.  I personally would try to make smores flavored marshmallows :).P.S.  The decor of this restaurant is very romantic/sexy/sophisticated.  Upon walking in I was expecting a $300 dollar bill, but it was more like $200 after tip for a party of two.",3,2,2,Biru S.,"Mamaroneck, NY",333,671,153

Serve it at completely the wrong temperature and throw seasoning out the window. We asked for medium rare and it came well done. Salt? Pepper? Huh? If it weren't for the chili lobster on top, I would have just left the steak on the table.

2.0,8/24/2014,"Not sure what planet the other reviewers are eating on, but WOW, was I disappointed last night.The space is beautifully appointed .....but.....First of all, the liquor is measured out in the skimpiest way possible and ridiculously overpriced...4 of us at the bar, 2 drinks each...bar tab $225Then...We are seated at a lovely table for 4 next to a round table for 8 which includes a noisy toddler... On Saturday night at a steak restaurant...seriously? By 9:00 they left, and another really loud party is seated. There is a real problem with the acoustics here. The biscuits are probably the best biscuits I have ever had  and the waiter was super friendly and knowledgeable (hence the 2 stars)Anyway, I ordered the Hiramasa appetizer, which is a dumpling filled with a raw white fish...very tasty except that it was in a pool of cold, oversalted and incredibly lemony miso broth that was inedible. I put the dumpling on my bread plate and it was delicious.I like very rare steak and usually ask that it be barely cooked. Last night I asked for it rare, no additional comments on my part, and I was concerned that it might be overcooked. It was raw...had good flavor on the outside, but raw. I did not want to send it back because I figured I would then have overcooked $32 hanger steak. We ordered Latkes, which were underseasoned mini potato pies- 2 in a portion.Our other dished were equally as unexciting and disappointing.They brought us out a dessert plate with a birthday candle, and the cheesecake was fantastic.

5.0,8/18/2014,"The service at American Cut was so perfect,  I couldn't help but think how other Manhattan steakhouses of similar caliber should be ashamed of themselves.  Sleek and attentive yet not overly intrusive or pretentious.  It created the perfect setting for a delicious meal.  The biscuits are delicious.  In fact, I would not mind having a few of those around for breakfast.  The steak knife salad,  good, but overly salty from all the cheese and bacon.  This may be a pro for some.  I had the 10 oz filet.  I have to say the seasoning and char on the outside of the steak is the best I have ever tasted.  Whatever they are doing, its working.  The Joel Rubuchon potatoes were not as good as I have had in the past at an actual Joel Rubuchon restaurant.  In fact they tasted sort of like a TV dinner mashed potato.  However, they were good and did go well with the meat.  I had a chocolate cheesecake for dessert and it looked and tasted like a candy bar.  It was delicious and noteworthy.  Overall,  I would return but perhaps change my order a bit.  But I can definitely see how it has garnered such high ratings.",0,0,0,Christina B.,"Staten Island, NY",18,20,4

5.0,8/9/2014,"""EFF Peter Luger's,"" is what my cousin said. To let that go unanswered would have almost been treason but I was willing to see where this went. I've dined here three times so far and this review is way overdue.Decor. This is some swanky ass gourmet type of place. Very dimly lit with this retro feel, kind of makes you feel like you're on a set from Mad Men. Drinks. I have only tried one but the Plank Smoked Old Fashion is just spectacular. How often do you get to see the bartender go to work with a pair of pliers and a blow torch. Okay, no pliers. If you caught that one, you're cool. Really though, this is one of my all time favorite drinks.Appetizers. The steak tartare is done very well, it may not be the most epic but it definitely passes the test. The Steak Knife Wedge Salad is tasty but considering all the other great stuff, I usually try not to get it as it just wastes stomach real estate. I have a lot but even I run out sometimes sadly. Diamond Jim Brady or DJB Oysters, ridiculously good. The truffle on the light layer of cheese with the creamed spinach, I can easily do two orders of this myself; we usually do.Entree. I only order the Tomahawk Ribeye Chop when I come here. I have tried it both as a standalone with the foie gras add-on and with the lobster. The marbling on this steak brings a tear to my eye. I order my steak black/blue and it's done perfectly at AC. Cool red center with this crispy seasoned exterior, just wonderful. I don't typically use sauce but I really enjoy the au poivre sauce with this. The chili lobster is delicious as well, very tasty with the bang bang.Sides. Dry Aged Potatoes, very interesting texture but just as interestingly good. Very hearty but really good. Latkes, I don't know if I've ever seen this as a side anywhere else but crispy/satisfying. Twice Baked, NY cheddar and truffle; nuff said. I would recommend you share this trio of potato grenades with a friend, these will MESS you up. In a good way though. Sunchoked Spinch, a fresh deviation from the typical creamed spinach. The fontina in this really brings this alive and is probably one of my favorite sides here.Desserts. Cracker Jack Sundae, caramel popcorn in ice cream; you know the deal. A nice way to end the meal and bring you back to your childhood. Coconut Panna Cotta, very different twist but it has a delightful tropical flavor. AC Car Bomb, you are not doing yourself any favors by not ordering this. Make room for it, it is that frickin' good. This will make you poo rainbows. Chocolate bread pudding sitting beneath a scoop of Guinness (WTF) ice cream, flanked by bananas and Jameson butterscotch..I don't even like chocolate. Everything blends to deliver a dessert that's good for your stomach and soul. I don't need to write anymore. The service is on par with the food as expected.

4.0,7/25/2014,"I was waiting for a long time to try this place and the number one thing that stands out about this place is the impeccable service. It is probably the best service I have received at any restaurant anywhere in the world. We went on a stormy Thursday night around 7:30 and the place was nearly empty, I'm sure on the weekends it has a more packed crowd. As soon as we stepped in though, I was impressed with the décor and dimly lit atmosphere, making it great for date night or a dinner with a group. Every detail was elegant and sexy. We first ordered a round of drinks, I wanted a fruity martini and the waiter suggested a raspberry martini that apparently they make fresh (like fresh squeeze the fruit?)...what ever they did it was DELICIOUS. Onto the meal itself, I am a very picky eater but after a few sips of the martini the everything biscuits tasted great, and the rest of my party loved them. I skipped an appetizer because nothing to me looked appetizing but my table had a few apps (including the east/west oysters) which they enjoyed. For dinner I ordered a fillet minion... I have to be 100% honest, I did not love it. We frequently dine at steak houses like Delfrisco's and Strip House and I just did not find the steak comparable. First of all it was not cooked medium like I requested, it was definitely medium rare, but it was so dark in there I closed my eyes an ate it. The flavoring just was not there. I ordered the steak fries with ketchup as a side...the ketchup sucked....absolutely sucked....it was some home made crap, did not enjoy. Onto dessert (which I typically have with every meal) well that I had to skip, due to a lack of chocolate option on the menu. How do you not have one chocolate item on the menu!? The waiter was very apologetic and brought out mini cookies with the check. That was a great touch....and I felt special :-) Overally I would rate this steakhouse in 3rd place, Delfrisco's being first, Strip House 2nd. I would probably return in the future with a group due to the location and the impeccable service. It is definitely a great place to bring someone to impress them.

3.0,6/5/2014,"American Cut has some new twists and modern wrinkles on the steakhouse formula, but in the end loses out to some of the old bastions of NYC steak in my opinion.No doubt, the centerpiece here is the massive tomahawk rib-eye.  This really is a world class steak.  Intensely flavorful with a near perfect char.  I topped it with bone marrow, but really found it to be an unnecessary addition.  Ordered it medium-rare, came out a touch on the rare side, but no real complaints there.  As for the accompaniments, the biscuits that are served in lieu of bread service were good, but I don't  prefer this over a good bread and butter service.  Personal preference.  The wedge salad is an impressive take on the old classic, and a welcome tinker to the old favorite. Only one negative food wise was the wild mushroom polenta side dish which was WAY too salty as well as overcooked.  Could not taste the polenta at all, and the wild mushrooms were dried out. Martinis' were okay, albeit with two olives (kind of a faux pas).The dining room is very spacious and comfortable, but really the whole experience just feels like a steakhouse without much of a soul.  Certainly feels like like the kind of place Bloomberg absolutely adores.  Maybe I'm being too harsh, and this is norm these days, but I find these kind of ""expense account is king"" establishments are a bit too sanitized.  This goes for the service, which was professional and polished all around to be sure, but again largely soulless.Overall a good experience, but seeing as I don't frequent these kind of high end $65 steak on a plate restaurants very often, I'm partial to some of the old school top shelf favorites first that have character and do the classics right, i.e. Lugers, Keens, or even Palm.",2,1,0,One D.,"Manhattan, NY",28,191,18

I must say I was impressed and they were comparable to the Mamburi oysters that I love, but can only find in Kenya. I am not crazy about truffle but it was just the right amount -I could barely taste it. Oh I cannot forget to mention their bread with cream cheese...how divine. We ordered a steak and the Montauk Flute. Both were tasty. I was actually quite impressed with how well the fish turned out. Sides included, spinach, baked potato and the biggest carrot I have ever seen! All were good. And then of course dessert called for the Cracker Jack Sundae.

4.0,5/3/2014,"Solid, solid 4.  Big Fan of Marc Forgione as he brings a real contemporary and edgy flare to everything he cooks.  Now, let's talk food.  Starting w. the real inventive ""everything"" biscuit.  Def one of the top biscuits I've eaten and flavorful and delicate enough where the veggie cream cheese wasn't even necessary but a plus nonetheless.  We ordered the American Cut Seafood tasting.  The idea of this is great because it brings a new look on the traditional chilled seafood platter where everyone does and shows no culinary skills.  However, his platter included the below:""Chili Lobster, DJB Oysters, Raw Oysters, Shrimp Cocktail, Hiramasa Tartare, Tuna, Jumbo Lump Crab"" and we added the Bacon. (It was good, but I actually preferred plain and simple w. either Luger's or Wolfgang's)The last 5 items on this list was good but not too memorable because it can be ordered at most seafood or japanese restaurants.  However, the first 2 items were dynamite and epitomizes Marc Forgione cooking.  The sauce/broth on the Chili Lobster was the actual star of the show and using the texas toast to mop up the sauce was delightful.  The DJB oysters were outstanding and the hint of truffle paired so well w. the champagne cheese sauce and the oyster.  I need to find a way to mimic this recipe, haha.The 3 of us then shared the 10oz. A5 Miyazaki and the 20oz. bone-in Pastrami Ribeye.  No words can describe the best cut of Wagyu one can get so that's your answer.  As for the Pastrami Ribeye, apprehensive at first fearing the spices would overpower the meat, this was cooked and prepared beautifully.  Not sure what other people were eating but the essence of the ribeye was there and the pastrami spices enhanced the flavors.  We also paired all the steaks w a great Brunello di Montalcino, not sure what the name was but it was recommended by our waiter/sommelier but it was $165 so that helps to narrow it down.The side dishes were actually the reason why the rating was not higher.  Maybe we ordered the wrong things but we got the latkes, sauteed broccolini, sunchoke spinach, and caramelized onions in the form of ""french onion"" soup.  The latkes was probably the best item but I found it a bit overcooked....exterior too crunchy.  The spinach and caramelized onions were fine.  The broccolini was so salty and just didn't pair well w. the rest of the meal because it was more Italian style cooked like onions and peppers.  At last, dessert.  Outrageous expresso martini and crackerjack sundae.  Very good AC carbomb and the guiness ice cream actually helped mellow out the overall sweetness of the dessert.Food was great, service was great, and ambiance was great.  What else do you expect?!?  Reading through other reviews, mostly the negative ones and the common theme is $$$.  Do you not look at the menu first before you make the reservation?  Every steakhouse in NYC is at the same price range.  You want a cheaper meal then find your closest OUTBACK.  Also, as a fellow restauranteur, let me enlighten consumers that steakhouses albeit the exorbitant prices, actually don't make much money on steaks.  The process of purchasing high quality Prime steaks and then aging it shrinks the original size by at least 25%.  Great quality prime steaks go for $18-25 a lb.  Therefore, they are only charging you double as opposed to typical pricing at 3-4 times the cost for normal foods.  For another odd reason, these negative reviews are always from people who have less than 15 reviews.  All of a sudden, you became a critic?!?  Anyways, Can't wait to go back....",1,0,2,Ricky C.,"San Francisco, CA",49,221,4

They can definitely accommodate larger groups with notice. We ordered a mix of sides and several porterhouses to share with the table. For a 100$ porterhouse, it left much to be desired. We ordered a few for the table, all at medium, and each came out at a different doneness. They also seemed to overdo the char on the cut as well as several cuts had a burnt bitter taste to it. The rarer pieces were an indicator that the quality of the meat was amazing. I just wished the entire experience had the same consistency.  Perhaps I should've just gone with the tartare. We ordered a few different sides to go with the steak. Twice cooked potatoes, spinach, caramelized onions, and dry aged potatoes. The sides were amazing and the everything bagel biscuits were great.

The everything biscuits are perfect and the best complimentary bread I've ever had. We had a bottle of Malbec and it was great. The Jim Brady oysters were fantastic- rich and cooked perfectly. The Caesar  salad is where things started to deteriorate. I've read many rave reviews and it was shockingly flavorless. It had no sharpness/anchovy flavor at all. My girlfriend had been looking forward to the New York City Cut Ribeye for months and it was a massive disappointment. The cut itself was almost definitely USDA Choice, not Prime nor dry aged. It was hard to explain but underneath the terrible pastrami spices there was no beef or dry aged flavor. The pastrami spices were awful. It tasted only of caraway seed (Rye flavor). No other spices were detectible. We were expecting a cross between Katz' pastrami mixed with a good dry aged steak and it tasted like neither. To make it worse, it was ordered medium but came out cooked unevenly. Some of it was medium, but the closer she got to the bone is was fully well done. My Ribeye without the pastrami spices was delicious and had a perfect dry aged taste, but the cut was the oddest and smallest I've ever had with a ribeye. Compared to her 20oz ribeye, mine had to be 14oz easily. I probably should have sent it back for a full sized steak. The side of Potato Latkes was bland, greasy and very small for a side. The Candy Bar dessert was really good. However, I let them know ahead of time that it was her birthday and they put a candle on the dessert.....but they didn't comp anything!?

We ordered the diamond Jim Brady Oysters, which were delicious!!!!! Everything started off just wonderfully, but ended in disappointment. The Caesar salad was blah. The dressing was missing a kick...needed more anchovy flavor. I ordered the famous pastrami ribeye and my boyfriend got the dry aged ribeye with no seasoning. When the steak was placed in front of me, I was drooling. It looked beautiful. However, it was slightly overcooked, dry and lacked flavor.  My boyfriend tasted it as well and it merely tasted like rye bread. The steak had no flavor. I had to add salt, blasphemy! I was so disappointed with the flavor that I refused to send it back because I felt it was not worth it. For this to be American Cut's signature dish, it should be cooked to perfection and flavorful, but it wasnt. My boyfriend enjoyed his steak, which was topped with bone marrow. As a side we had the potato latkes with the applesauce on the side. They were small and bland. To end the evening, we had the candy bar cake, which was very good.

Our server, Justin was fast, friendly and had a great read on what we needed. Good for business, couples, or a small group. There was private room that looked like it seated 12-14.

5.0,3/20/2014,"I thought I walked into the set of a Superman movie in this new Art Deco steakhouse opened by Marc Forgione. It is very posh and I felt like I should be wearing my hair pinned up 40's style. The food is incredible. To begin, the ""Everything Biscuits"" w/ veggie cream cheese was to die for! I started off w/ delicious cosmos which were perfect and oysters. They were divine and then we both had a filet mignon which I could almost use my fork to cut into! The service was extraordinary but with these prices, I did not expect otherwise. I been back after my first visit for cocktails and even on New Year's but the prices are SO overwhelming (it is VERY expensive). I do not think I can go again unless it is just to sit at the bar. This is a ""night out"" spot, romantic and old world. I def. suggest it for a special event!",2,1,1,Annette V.,"New York, NY",801,234,36
4.0,3/17/2014,"Okay Marc Forgione.... You win. I dislike pricey restaurants, but, if I had to go to one, I'm glad our friend chose your spot.When my group for dinner picked this place, I a) cringed at the amount of dollar signs, and b) am not a red-meat person, so to be honest, I went in a bit miffed. That uneasiness dissipated once our bartender introduced us to their whiskey list, and graciously poured a Bookers over a whiskey-cube. They do measured pours here (I mean, when you charge $17 for a Bookers shot, you must be looking to rake in some cash so why NOT be stingy with your pouring...)We sat for our meal after the rest of our party arrived and easily broke into some red and white wine alongside those famous ""everything"" biscuits. I saw that Erath 2011 Pinot Gris on the list and encouraged that - The retail from the vineyard itself is about half that listed price, so if you can find it at only double on a restaurant list, its a deal. And with nuances of honeysuckle and orange, it didnt disappoint. We had a red that was called ""duck"" something.. also very tasty (not sure how reasonable THAT one was...)We, for the most part, skipped starters, but my guy had a ceasar salad that was lovely (a little heavy on the dressing) and someone else got the wedge (which, in my opinion, $14 for a quarter-head of iceburg lettuce is absurd). Most reasonable human beings ordered steaks... my guy loved his filet and whatever sauce he got with it. I grabbed the hot-appetizer of octopus as my main with a $10 side of spinach. Yeah... $10 spinach. My octopus tasted like bacon and was sliced upon arrival, which helped cut down on its chewiness (not the most tender Ive had, but still delicious). The spinach was creamy but not fatty-feeling, and the salty cheese-crust on top was divine. After, the nine of us split a crackerjack sundae, which was absolutely mind-blowing (now, THAT was worth the pricetag).Overall - portions vs price is not particularly favorable for hungry middle-class folks, but if youre looking for a nice treat, want to celebrate a special occasion, or just want to play the game of ""how high can I get my bill before I dine and dash?"" - this place may be worth looking into.",3,3,1,Heather H.,"Jersey City, NJ",440,341,1

2.0,3/15/2014,"Disappointing experience. Started out well enough. Everything biscuits with veggie cream cheese spread was great. Would be great for an egg sandwich. Unfortunately went downhill from there. Bacon app had too much BBQ sauce, couldn't taste the bacon. Caesar looked nicer than it tasted. Hiramasa app was the best of the 3. The big let down was the tomahawk ribeye for two. Steak had no flavor. Dry aging for 28 days didn't leave much of a mark. They also cut the pieces of steak way too thick. Again, it looked a lot nicer than it tasted. And at a steakhouse where you're paying for their most expensive steak that's not a winning combination. The crackerjack sundae was pretty good but not good enough to pull this rating up after the very disappointing steak. Won't be coming back. Sorry, Forgione.

5.0,3/1/2014,"Wow. I brought my gf here for a belated valentines day dinner and we had such an amazing time. I love the corner booth seats that let you stretch out your arms around your significant other between dishes. Decor and overall quality of this place is top notch for a fancy steak house. I think anyone would be impressed by its subtleties and attentive staff. Let's talk about food. Here's what to order:1) cracker jack sundae. Even though this is dessert, I mention this in the beginning because you should certainly save room for this baby. The caramel bits with popcorn is flavorful and completely infused in the ice cream to give everything a consistent taste and complimentary range of sweetness. 2) steak for two. I've always recommended ordering the larger steak portions because the cut is better and more flavorful. We got the 40 Oz NY strip with the bone marrow topping and it was amazing. I could barely keep my eyes open from the savory flavor. We ordered it raw and it came out exactly the raw I wanted. Their house steak sauce also has a nice tangy and smoky flavor behind it, but I rather taste the natural flavor of murder. 3) mashed potatoes. This isn't just because I love mashed potatoes. Well... Not entirely due to that. It's because they use a tomato puree method that really goes nicely as a side sauce to top on the steak. Of course, I tend to mix mashed potatoes with everything... 4) California cab red wine. Bought a bottle because sometimes you have to go big. Great idea with the honig 2011. Steep, but worth it with pairing. 5) Caesar salad. This is a weird one, but I've always found Caesar salads to be specifically done right at a steakhouse.

4.0,2/18/2014,"After having one of the best meals of my life at Marc Forgione, I had to check this place out when I heard the iron chef was opening a steakhouse. See below:Flavor: 9I had the NYC cut rib eye, which was a 20oz bone-in cut that was seasoned with pastrami spices (mainly mustard seed and rye seed). It was definitely different and unique. I loved it for the first half of the steak, but on the back end I was kinda just craving a regular steak taste. But the meat was cooked perfectly, it was juicy and tender, and it had great char and crust. Bravo for thinking outside the box on this cut. On a second trip I shared the rib eye for two with a friend and my wife. It was perfectly cooked, and absolutely delicious. I also got to taste a bit of the filet mignon from another friend who ordered it. Very juuicy and tender, with great seasoning.Choice of Cuts & Quality Available: 10The quality is all fantastic from what I could tell; all aged for many weeks. They had several different steaks for two to choose from (rib eye, porterhouse), a standalone strip, a standalone rib eye (the one I had), a filet (plus one on special), a hanger steak, and a wagyu rib eye.Portion Size & Plating: 9The sizes here are good: 20oz for the rib eye, 14oz for the strip, 10oz for both the hanger and filet, 42oz for the rib eye for two, and 40oz for the porterhouse. Plating was nice - basic, elegant, but not overly fancy. A word of caution: the rib eye for two has a lot of bone on it - tomahawk style. I could probably take it down by myself, but if you load up on apps and sides, you will be okay with sharing it.Price: 8The steaks are fair in price ($44 for the rib eye), but I thought some of the apps were a little too pricey. For example, the chili lobster was $27 and it was, at best, a half of a 1-pound lobster. I've had bigger and better lobsters for $3.99/lb from my local grocery store. Also the bacon - two thick cut slabs is $16. A bit expensive. Both dishes were yummy though (see below). On the plus side, I had $100 from a contest I won on Tabelog for my restaurant reviews, so I used that toward the bill.Bar: 8The bar is nice here. It's set back behind the greeting station, but it's a good set up. They have a great cocktail menu with some really nice, interesting things. My wife tried a fig margarita and an artichoke sour. Both were good in my opinion, but the artichoke cocktail was a little too bitter in the back end of each sip. They mixed a good martini, but the martini could definitely benefit from some better quality olives. With dessert I tried the homemade sambuca: it was nice and potent, with strong hints of vanilla, ginger and coffee.Specials & Other Meats: 9Our waitress offered us three specials: a baby greens salad with squash, a 7oz filet with hunter's sauce (reduced red wine, bacon, mushroom), and a brussels sprouts with pearl onions side dish. We didn't try any because we were too enticed by the regular menu items. In the ""other meats"" department they offer a braised short rib; lamb, veal, and pork porterhouses; a clove chicken; and as I said above some wagyu and alternative cuts like hanger. I guess I'll mention it here - why he fuck not... the steak sauce was nice and tangy, and would go well with any meat. My steak was heavily spiced with the pastrami stuff, so I didn't use it, but it might be good on something like chicken. I like the cool old-timey apothecary bottle it was presented in too:Apps Sides & Dessert: 8We started with three items: bacon, octopus, and steak tartare. The steak tartare was a bit too tangy and vinegary for our liking. It came with a soft boiled, pickled quail egg that sat at the bottom of the meat. it was served with toasted bread and homemade sweet pickles. Overall it was just too sour and salty for our taste, but we did eat it all.The bacon was delicious. Crispy outside, soft and fatty inside, great flavor. Just a bit pricey as I mentioned before. It was topped with a nice sort of onion marmalade:Here's a shot of the bone marrow app, which my wife tried on a second visit. Gorgeous and stunning:The octopus was excellent. I've had better at a local Italian place on Long Island, but I really liked the array of different flavors that came through with each bite here. Olive oil, shaved celery, roasted red peppers, lemon, garlic. It was great:On the side we had the sunchoked spinach. it was a nice take on creamed spinach. I love the flavor of sunchoke so I was excited to try this. They put some fontina cheese on top to give it the extra salt and cream, but I thought maybe half the amount of cheese would have been plenty.review cut for length",2,0,1,JohnnyPrimeC.

We got there right as they open and were the only two patrons for probably about 45mins which was nice as the attention given was amazing. The decor and ambiance of this place is sultry and I appreciated their attention to details. Our servers were amazing and very personable. We had a great banter with all of them, which made us feel like we were very welcomed. Even the hostess came back to our table to tell us a funny story about my boyfriends coat (which weighs the same amount of a small child) falling on her in the coat room. She was able to get out unscathed. That Everything Biscuit, is the the truth. I want the recipe and thought about going back to the kitchen to seduce who ever made it. We got an amazing bottle of red wine which set our mouths just right for what we ate which was the Surf n Turf for two. When that plate came out, even the servers stopped to stare and throw up a thumbs up! I honestly feel like that cow was personally bred for me just so that I could have an excellent steak on my bday. No lie, it was that good. That chili lobster smacks you in the face with its heat and I desperately wanted to get every micro inch of it but I'm an adult now in an adult setting so had to be demure. Dessert came and I had the flour less chocolate cake with roasted peanut ice cream and my boyfriend got the malt blondie. They came out with my cake to sing me Happy Birthday and our nice neighbors next to us joined in! It was a truly nice moment shared by all and I almost invited everyone to be in my bday pic. Anyway, that dessert was all the good memories of my 20s put together in a bowl and I don't think we talked at my table bc we were too busy shoveling it all in. Then the check came..and it hurt...but since that cow and lobster died so gracefully for my taste buds it was worth it.

But I'm hard-pressed to identify exactly what accounts for it. The music is an ecletic selection of Boston, RHCP, Gang of Four, Bowie, and other stuff I like.

Let me first start with stating how amazing the staff is ALL Of them are just superb, warm, friendly, helpful and over the top accommodating so they deserve an off the chart rating based on staff and service. Also their have a nice ambiance, cool selections of special drinks and nice and big tables which is sometimes a luxury in Manhattan but this is a great spacious restaurant.OK that out of the way the reason why I gave it  three stars is because the food was really really not good and at that price point you do expect everything on the menu to be delicious and the only thing I had that was good were raw Oyster (now you can't mess that up). I had the Salmon dish (I knew not to expect much from a stake house when it came to anything other than stake) even with low expectations my dish was just terrible barely eatable (which I didn't eat much of it just enough to convince me that it was awful) no flavor, overlooked just bad. To their credit they were really nice about it and offered if I wanted something else and even took that salmon dish of the bill which was great and the right thing to do. The rest of the people at my table did get stake dishes and they liked their food much better than I did mine so it is still a place to go to as long as you are having some sort of stake cut.

4.0,12/16/2013,"As far as steakhouses go in NYC, the steak at American Cut was right up there with my other favorites (Strip House, Wolfgangs, Quality Meats). I hat the 10 oz filet mignon, and my date had the 20 oz NY cut rib-eye (without traditional seasoning vs their special pastrami seasoning). The rib-eye was perfectly cooked and bursting with flavor. I also really liked that you could order different sauces (herb butter, chimichurri, au poivre, red wine etc.) for your steak, although it didn't need it as it was seasoned really well. As far as the rest of the meal goes, we loved our drinks (poached fig margarita and the plank smoked old fashion). We opted for the twice baked potatoes and creamed spinach as our sides. Both were nice, standard options, but didn't blow me away. They offer plenty of other sides to choose from too.The starters were our least favorite. We had the mixed greens, which was a deconstructed salad with a small piece of goat cheese and a wedge of squash. I was hoping for more. The chili lobster Texas toast was an interesting concept - 4 pieces of Texas toast triangles in a bowl of spicy lobster broth with some pieces of lobster (maybe a half tail, one knuckle, one claw). The flavor of the broth was spicy but delicious, and if I had a spoon I would have eaten more of it. Otherwise, the amount of lobster was disappointing.The everything style biscuit and vegetable butter was an amazing way to start our meal instead of the traditional bread basket. I'd be happy eating this every single day.Not sure how we were able to fit in dessert, but we chose the cracker jack ice cream sundae. It is by no means a small serving, but it is delicious and absolutely worth getting as everything in the sundae is homemade.The service was attentive and friendly.

Not as messy, crowded and overwhelmed as QM.the sides are also great. Brussels sprout special was devine, wild mushrooms is a must! potato latkes is great! spinach... epic! even the service bread with the butter is iconic! I had the two slices of bacon appetizer and that was better than Wolfgang's but not as good as David Burke's Prime Steakhouse's honey glazed bacon triple slices. If you gonna have an Appetizer here... get the chili lobster... comes with toast to soak in the sauce. Expensive appetizer but its too die for. WineList is very poor though. If you are an experienced wineguy or a winegal, especially in the business; you will be searching for the value bottle which is Nonexistent. They have the heavyweights like Phelps for over $110 or the Opus for $350 but do the wine collectors will drink Scarecrow for $500 or Checkboard for $250 or a Conterno Barbera or Sandrone's for $75 to $85 before drinking Opus for $350 or even Ruffino Gold Label Chianti for $85. I ended up drinking a $50 Bottle of immature Italian for like $120. Offensive list if you know wine. If you don't know wine then its a good list. $100 bucks is not bad for a bottle of red wine because they all taste the same anyways... ""how's the wine?"" and they all say, ""wine tastes good"".Overall, my goto Steakhouse in NYC now that Quality Meats is too complicated to get a table and the drinks are definitely better here... Bar's much better too if I, as a Belvedere if not Fine Wine kinda guy can drink the Bourbon or Rye that's in their Old Fashioned. -CellarReview.com",0,0,0,Young K.,"Union City, NJ",0,14,77
5.0,12/2/2013,"I LOVE steak but I hate steakhouses. They always have stuffy staff, white table cloths and identical menus. That's the antithesis of a dining experience to me. I came here and got the exact opposite. The food was amazing, the interior was beautiful, the staff was very accommodating and warm all around. I've worked in restaurants for years and was very impressed, especially since they apparently opened pretty recently. The appetizers were really unique, I shared a caesar salad with my Dad (I know, not so unique, but pretty damn good) and the lobster, which was spicy and glorious. The server highly recommended the NYC cut for an entree and my Dad had it before on a previous trip, refused to share one with me because he wanted one for himself. So I got one for myself - I'm glad he didn't want to share. It was cooked perfectly and the spices on top added a glorious dimension to my steak. I was too full for dessert but I saw them at other tables and they looked spectacular, like little works of art. Overall, it was easy to give this place 5 stars, on hospitality alone. I felt comfortable and at home and of course, the food was out of this world, totally blew other steakhouses out of the water. If you're looking for white table cloths, this isn't the place but you will get white table cloth service and amazing food.",0,0,0,Zoe G.,"Manhattan, NY",3,45,0

5.0,11/30/2013,"Went looking to escape the cold with a fantastic Friday night steak and American Cut more than delivered. I was obligingly greeted at the door immediately by the [straight off the runway] maître d' and decided to warm myself up at the bar with a literally smoked old fashioned. Soon after a smile-clad hostess ushered me into a cozy yet chic dining room to a corner booth. I hadn't even realized that this steakhouse was owned by Iron Chef Marc Forgione and to be honest I wouldn't have if I hadn't looked it up. I've found that in many big name NY restaurants that the staff can frequently hold their noses up a little too high for my liking. However the staff at American Cut was anything but - confident yet humble, knowledgeable without pretension. The sommelier spoke to my palette and not to the price tag. My spicy chili lobster was amazing to start. My NYC ribeye was impeccable and with a little bit of history tied into it, a frequent occurrence on much of the menu. I had asked my server for a recommendation for a side dish and replied without hesitation that I must have the glazed Brussels sprouts with rutabaga and thick chunks or bacon. Phenomenal. I finished the meal with an AC Carbomb, a chocolate bread pudding with Guiness ice cream and bananas- and it was exactly that. On my way out the manager approached me and thanked me for coming. I wish I had done it sooner. As I left the three lovely ladies at the front desk wished me warm on my way home.

5.0,11/29/2013,"LOVED American Cut! This is my new favorite steakhouse.  I arrived a half hour early, and the staff could not have been more welcoming to me. I was shown to a lovely booth, and the service from everyone was terrific. (Almost as if they were trained by Danny Meyer).  Even a staff member who was not taking care of my table came by to welcome me since she remembered me from The NoMad. The ""everything"" biscuit with cream cheese is delicious, but since I had already planned my dinner, I needed to save room. My first course was the yummy potato latkes--a must dish.  My main course was the pastrami coated ribeye served a beautiful hot pink medium. Funny how I've always ordered my steak med-rare, but it turns out I really like medium. Terrific char and great flavor and tender too!  Half of it will be a wonderful dinner for tomorrow. My sides: the Pommes purée a la Robuchon may not have been as stellar as at Joel Robuchon, but they were delicious. I also ordered tonight's special of Brussels sprouts with rutabaga and bacon (and I think a soy glaze)--delicious too, and better than at The NoMad and Betony. Took home half of the potatoes and Brussels sprouts. Had to save room for the Cracker Jack Sundae and the espresso martini. Both were delicious! Will definitely order them again. Too bad I couldn't take them home too. Considering I ordered enough food for two, the bill was very reasonable (for me). I was never rushed or ignored, but was treated as a welcomed guest. Definitely plan to return to American Cut!",1,0,0,Ellen O.,"New York, NY",51,200,503
3.0,11/25/2013,"A solid 3.5 stars.  The appetizers were the stars of the meal.  I absolutely loved the Everything Biscuit.  Its everything its cracked up to be and served with homemade vegetable cream cheese.  It was perfectly crunchy with a warm soft interior.We shared Marc Forgione's infamous Chili Lobster and the Diamond Jim Brady Oysters.  The Oysters were probably one of the best oysters I've ever had.  The Chili lobster was also delicious.  A bit spicy but even so, I couldn't stop scooping up the sauce with my spoon For entrees we shared the 20 oz NY Cut with Pastrami Spices and Latkes. Between the biscuit and the apps, it was ALOT of food - we had half a steak left over.  The Pastrami Spices made the steak very interesting but both S and I weren't huge fans because it tasted too much like Pastrami and not enough like a steak.  With that in mind, it was perfectly cooked and I would definitely go back and try the steak without the spices and get the Oysters again.  The Latkes were delicious though a bit greasy. Being a huge fan of Latkes I loved them but I don't think S liked them too much.  He's not much of a potato fan. We were way too stuffed for dessert but they gave us complimentary chocolate biscuits and 1 almond candy. Nice gesture but a bit too chewy.  Also there were 2 of us and they gave us only 1 almond candy - granted we were both too full to try it but did they expect us to fight over it? Marc, either give us 2 pieces of each or just the chocolate biscuits. Thanks again S for a great birthday meal!",1,1,1,Kathy L.,"New York, NY",109,298,69
2.0,11/24/2013,"After hearing rave reviews about Marc Forgione's newest TriBeCa restaurant, American Cut, we were excited to try it. We arrived 15 minutes early and the hostess informed us that our table would be ready closer to our reservation time, which wasn't a problem. Once it was 15 minutes passed our reservation time I went back to check on our table. An unapologetic  hostess said it would be another 15 minutes. I was a little taken back by her abrupt and rude demeanor. I then informed her that there was an unattended Bag behind our barstool. She told me to retrieve for her. I was  mortified with her tone and blatant rudeness. Not a good start. Once we were finally seated we were excited to look over the menu. After hearing the waiter describe the NYC Cut 20 oz bone-in-ribeye, which was quite different than what was spelled out in the menu, we opted for this steak. What he described and what we received were two completely different things. Not sure where the disconnect was. We ordered the steak with a side of the french onion and the Brussels sprouts special, which was anything but special. We were so disapponted with our entree and the sides that we couldn't eat more than a couple bites. Our waiter came to remove our plates and didn't bother to ask if we wanted to take anything home or if we didn't like it. There appeared to be two managers in the dining area, of which not one bothered to ask if everything was ok, especially since we hardly touched our dinner. Our appetizers were ok. The undercooked bone marrow with chewy rubbery little escargot balls mixed with short rib was an underwhelming starter. However, the hiramasa was good. Besides leaving the restaurant, the highlight of this pathetic dining experience was the biscuit and the 2003 Jordan Cab, which we selected. The wine was not only amazing, but reasonably priced. I can't get over how terrible the service was. From the obnoxious hostess, who reminded me of an LA bouncer with a power trip, to the passionless and inattentive waiter. Even the sommelier acted like she could careless about her job or her interaction with guests.  It was quite apparent that none of the staff wanted to be there. It's surprising that an ""Iron Chef"" would employ such a passionless staff. Years ago we had dined at Forgione's self-titled restaurant and had similar experience. I honestly can't remember the last time a dining experience made me feel so angry, even the following day I was so upset with how we were treated and the quality of food we received. If the service was better, perhaps I'd be more forgiving on the food, though the dishes were still nothing more than average.",5,2,1,Sara D.,"Manhattan, NY",505,175,1035
4.0,11/18/2013,"KenScale: 8.0/10American Cut is the second location of Marc Forgione's Atlantic City-based steakhouse in TriBeCa. It is a steakhouse with a sleek dining room that features signature dishes from Forgione's eponymous restaurant plus more. I wouldn't say I was blown away at the restaurant, but it does offer some solid dishes for a steak night with friends.The meal started with biscuit that was pretty tasty. I proceeded to try three different starters. Cornflake crab cake was pretty solid, as was the ceasar salad that is prepared in front of you (although I still prefer the epic salad from Carbone). Bacon was a little too salty, but did enough to whet my appetite. Then came the main menu, the massive surf and turf for two (at a hefty $175 price tag) featuring two dishes (tomahawk ribeye chop and chili lobster) that helped Forgione make his mark in the New York dining scene. Chili lobster, with a side of toasts, was as great as always. I haven't had Forgione's tomahawk ribeye chop before, and had high expectations before the dish came out. I would say the meat, cooked medium rare, is incredibly juicy and tender, but the seasoning was a little off. Some parts of the chop were a little too salty that they ended up overwhelming the texture of the meat. I had three sides to go along with surf and turf: the fries with sea salt and vinegar, broccolini with onions, and the ""infamous"" $10 carrot. They were all alright, but none of them made particularly big impressions. Despite being close to full by the end of the meal, I still had to try a couple of desserts. Cracker Jack sundae with popcorn ice cream and pumpkin cheesecake were both delicious but overwhelmingly rich, and I had to stop after a couple of scoops. The dining room is beautifully decorated, and was filled with mostly young couples (some with their kids) probably from TriBeCa and the nearby neighborhoods. The restaurant has an extensive wine and cocktail menu, and the service staffs were attentive and professional. For a larger group dinner to indulge on serious meatfest with no expenses to be spared, American Cut is certainly a place worth visiting, but I wouldn't put it at the top of the New York steakhouse pantheon just yet.",2,0,0,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738

We were not disappointed, this place is gorgeous, a tasteful remake of a 1930s restaurant, your wish the main room was your private dining room.Lucky for us, since it was the opening, Chef Marc forgione was in the Kitchen.I started with the house signature cocktail called Plank Smoked Old Fashion served in a maple wood smoked glass ($20 or 25 I forgot). This signature cocktail is a true gentleman drink a winner for this autumn-winter season. Table was not ready when we arrived, it's ok, it was the opening, we enjoyed 20 minutes seated at the bar, it was relaxed and extremely welcoming. Finally we got the perfect corner table with a view of the room. Attentive service, friendly staff. Prices are reasonable, and the size of the starters are perfect for sharing like the bone marrow ($16), the Diamond Jim Brandy oysters ($18), cooked with champagne and truffle...totally my taste.  I loved my swordfish ($31), my wife her salmon ($31), both of them cooked to perfection and beautifully dressed in their plates. I have try the latkes ($10) because they looked good on the table of our neighbors. Oh boy, that was bad, I really could not eat that, so greasy, the taste of chicken skin was repulsive. My mistake. The carrot glazed is a very interesting dish, a single carrot is served glazed with mint and will cost you like all the side dishes...$10, no joke.The wine list is extensive, wine by the glass are extremely affordable.

The. salad was perfectly seasoned, I loved the dressing, the texture of the sunflower seeds and I especially enjoyed the squash, it was really very nice, very tasty. The Halibut was also quite excellent, seasoned just right, soft and flaky. I committed a mortal sin by not trying either the tomahawk ribeye or the porterhouse for two...but the dry aged 14 oz strip was a competent piece of meat and by no means a slouch, it was just too bad they were out of the standard ribeye...an obvious favorite at this place and mine as well. The night would have been perfect were it not for this untimely absence. I ordered all the steak butters/spreads to try, the red wine reduction was by far my favorite.Their Cabernet and Malbec by the glass were excellent pairs to my sanguine friend...I'll have to take a few notes on their extensive wine list for my personal pleasure.

Now, to be serious. I am a meat eater and one thing I do not play with is people messing up my steak. This was the true test. And...they passed. My filet Mignon was perfectly, perfectly cooked. It was buttery. Meaning it was tender (not tough). They provided you with a knife but really, you didn't need it. And what is steak without truffles shaved on top?

I must have given him a look because he stepped back quickly from the table. Hey, enter at your own risk when you interrupt me eating something this good. I digress. Back to the sauce. My first instinct was not to desecrate this perfectly cooked piece of meat. Reluctantly I poured some of the sauce on the side. Holy bejesus is that stuff good! Don't let the unlabeled brown bottle fool you. There is pure goodness on the inside.

4.0,10/14/2013,"Great vibe & great decor. All areas in restaurant are great for people watching -- quite a scene! Food-- Filet was great, Tomahawk was awesome. Bread/biscuits were to die for. Cheesecake dessert was phenomenal.Our waiter was extremely pleasant and knowledgeable-- and very accommodating to all our requests.Will definitely go back-- a little pricey, but no more than other similar places.. The location & vibe definitely worth it -- especially for a special occasion.",0,0,0,Angela D.,"New York, NY",0,2,0
1.0,10/13/2013,"I had read reviews regarding American Cut and how they canceled others reservations. I thought perhaps it was a one time problem, but I was wrong. We made reservations several weeks ahead when the restaurant first opened for a trip we were making to NYC.  They called a few days before our trip to cancel our reservations due to a wine tasting event for 10/19.  I am a business owner and know that you are typically aware of these events way in advance.   I am put off by their actions and lack of consideration. I hope others will not have this happen again!",2,0,0,Tina L.,"Grapevine, TX",0,4,0

5.0,10/11/2013,"Yet another great restaurant from Marc Forgione in TriBeCa.There's some pretty good stuff at his self-named restaurant, and everybody seems to love Khe-Yo, but everything about this place is head and shoulders above those.Most importantly of course, the food is incredible. To start with, one of the most important aspects of steakhouses, the complimentary bread, was one of the best I've ever had. Instead of some plain old bread, they give you ""Everything Biscuits"" (as in an ""Everything"" Bagel) with vegetable cream cheese. This was an incredibly buttery, huge, satisfying biscuit. The cream cheese wasn't even needed, but it's excellent so you should slather some on anyway.For appetizers, since my shellfish allergy always ruins life, we just got the OG 1924 Hotel Caesar Salad ($14), which sounds a lot cooler than what it really is (i.e. just a caesar salad). It happens to be delicious though. They bring it out to show you what it looks like to start, with a huge Pullman Crouton and a runny egg on top, and then bring it over and prepare and mix it for you table side. I don't really mess with caesar salad much, but I thought it was great, and it made me feel a bit better about all the meat and garbage I was about to eat (disregard the fact that it's covered in cheese and dressing).For the mains, we got the 10 oz. Filet Mignon ($42) and The New York Cut ($44), which is a bone-in ribeye with pastrami spices on top. Both were really delicious, juicy, excellent cuts of meat. We got Bernaise Sauce to go with the Fliet ($2), while they also give you MF Sauce as well (fancy name for their own A-1 imitation). The New York Cut was incredible - the pastrami spices really made it great and made it unnecessary to add any sauce to the mix.For the sides, I convinced myself that the greens from the Caesar Salad were enough, so we went with two potatoes. You always have to try the fries at a steakhouse, so we got the Kennebec Fries ($10), which were ok. They were of the steak fry variety, so much thicker and very potato-y. They were better than these kind usually are though, as they still managed to be nice and crispy. They also came with AE Ketchup (?), which went well with it of course. The real winner of the night though were the other potatoes we got, the Latkes ($10). These were really incredible, and some of the best latkes I've ever had (sorry mom). They were insanely salty, which is perhaps owed to the slightly overwhelming gribenes layered between each one, but that's to be expected with latkes. This is definitely a must order for a side here.Lastly, perhaps the best part of the meal, which sounds silly and unexpected at a steakhouse, was the dessert. I usually see at most one good choice at serious steakhouses (like a baked alaska or chocolate cake or something generic like that), but here I struggled to pick just two (I know most normal people just split one, but these were too good to choose only one). My love for popcorn and peanut butter won out though, and we went with the Cracker Jack Sundae and the Candy Bar Cake ($12 each). Both of these were shockingly good and beautifully presented.The sundae is served in a tall glass, with a large dollop of whipped cream and a piece of peanut brittle resting on the top, with some delicious clusters of caramel popcorn scattered at the base of the cup. $12 sounds like a lot, but they really hook you up with a LOT of that amazingly delicious, buttery popcorn ice cream. The tall glass felt bottomless, as I kept scooping out bite after bite, which was riddled with more of that great caramel popcorn.The Candy Bar Cake may have been even better - it's a piece of super dense flourless chocolate cake, with a bunch of peanuts baked into the base, along with an excellent scoop of roasted peanut ice cream. That salty sweet combo is one of the most delicious sweet tastes I've had in recent memory. And I've eaten a ton of memorable sweets recently.To cap off a perfect meal, they give you two house-made Girl Scout Cookies with the check (a Samoa and a Thin Mint). This did exactly as they intended and left me contented enough to leave an even more generous tip to reward the outstanding service throughout the meal.The space itself is beautiful. Low-lit, with a very nice, classy atmosphere in the first room, where the bar area is as well. We sat at a cozy table in the inner dining room, which was a bit brighter and just as nice. It's a great place for a celebration or a nice date.I went for the early bird special since we were catching a 7 PM movie at the nearby Regal theater, but by the time we were leaving, it was pretty much packed. I hope this place continues to do well, as it is an excellent choice for a new steakhouse in the neighborhood. I would love to come back for some more of that excellent steak and the rest of those incredible desserts.",14,8,10,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1694,69834
5.0,10/11/2013,"Second time back last night and words cannot express how much I enjoy the food, service and energy of this restaurant.Although it is a steak house--and fantastic here.. the swordfish is the best I have ever had. So fresh and perfectly cooked and this is no easy task. Desserts are divine!Excellent wine list and they also have master bartenders who know what they're talking about and can make a wicked cocktail. Sat at the bar the first night for dinner and that was great--perfect service. Last night sat in the main dinning and that was an absolute joy. The decor is modern and contemporary with a deco flair and does not disappoint. To top it off had the pleasure of meeting Marc Forgione the man behind this amazing establishment. He was checking on tables and introduced himself with great poise. He was an absolute pleasure to talk to.Dean the general manager is on top of his game. Welcoming, knowledgable and so accommodating. He took great care of me the 1st night I was there having dinner at the bar. Created a whole tasting for me off the menu. WOW! Ian also helps run the place and is great as well.My client was extremely happy and no doubt helped me close some business here..a perfect place to entertain for business or have a night out with friends.I will be back and you should try. It is top of my list and being very fortunate I have tried a lot of great restaurants since I have to take clients out quite a bit. This is my go to!",0,0,0,LU U.,"New York, NY",115,7,0

Made reservation for a large table at 8pm, then stopped by to reconfirm the night before and was told the time had been moved to 9pm. One guy had the audacity to say that no reservation for 10 people could be made without speaking to him.  Really awesome....they made me hate the place before I stepped inside.I will stick with Wolfgangs one block up. They at least appreciate their customers.",7,3,0,John G.,"New York, NY",0,2,0
4.0,10/6/2013,"This is probably closer to a 4 1/2 star rating.American Cut is now tied with Strip House as my favorite steakhouse in NYC. The cool thing about this place is that although it is, more or less, a steakhouse, I'd totally order the chicken or the fish, for example, but the real showstoppers here are the sides and starters. They start you off with an ""everything buttermilk biscuit,"" which was heavenly. You'll finish it even though you shouldn't if you ordered well.Chili lobster dish is fantastic. More like a soup than I expected, but superb, nonetheless.The bone marrow was cooked perfectly, though I'm not sure that the extras (fried escargot, crispy short rib balls) were totally necessary. One of the best caesar salads I've had in a long time.Order the latkes! Woah, good.The sunchoke spinach was tasty--like creamed spinach but without any actual cream.The french onion side (meant to represent the best part of a crock of french onion soup) was really good too but not good enough to finish with everything else we had on the table.My boyfriend and I shared the 40 oz porterhouse. I was enthralled; this is definitely dry-aged meat--a little funky, tons of earth and flavor. My boyfriend wasn't as into it, but he ate it like he was.Get the cracker jack sundae for dessert.Our server was awesome and helpful in helping us narrow down our order. His recommendations were stellar. Cool space, good vibe, friendly bartenders, so-so hostess...I'd go back for sure.",3,0,0,Gwen G.,"Brooklyn, NY",21,45,0
4.0,10/3/2013,"One star off because of 20 minutes our group had to wait to get drinks at the bar. I understand the place is new and is busy, however, 20 minutes is way too long, even if you are backed up. Though the staff in the main dining area was professional, knowledgeable and overall pleasant The place was high energy, on a louder side, I am not sure whether it was because of the group in the middle of the dining area or that's how the place normally rolls.  Loved the solid, heavy chairs.The food was good, solid 5 stars here.",2,0,0,D R.,"New York, NY",62,73,45
