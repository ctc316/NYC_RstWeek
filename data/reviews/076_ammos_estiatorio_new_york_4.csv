2.0,4/29/2019,"This Greek restaurant has lots of soft lighting and comfortable seating. Brick walls, high ceilings and large floor to ceiling windows add to the ambience. We visited on a Monday night and ordered the prix fixed dinner for $42 each, which included a selection of appetizer, main, and desert. For the appy I ordered the fried Calamari and my partner the grilled. The grilled was excellent...perfectly cooked and tender in a smoky lemon sauce. The fried was good too with a crispy,  spicy coating accompanied by an aoli. The moussaka arrived sometime later. Mine was actually quite cool. I sent it back to be reheated. Taste-wise, the moussaka was rather bland, the sauces were tasteless and to be honest, I wasn't sure if it was freshly made or frozen. There was no lamb taste at all. It could have been shepherds pie. For desert my partner ordered ice cream. I ordered the walnut cake, which also came with a scoop of ice cream. The cake was dry. I didn't finish it but the ice cream was good. Service was very good and attentive. Ample time was given between courses.",0,0,0,Dee G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,1,0
5.0,3/29/2019,Excellent fresh food. Good service. Greek music playing. Is authentic Greek food with an American twist. We got a fresh fish and appetizers. The fish was extremely fresh and priced per pound.  Great cocktail menu although the prices for cocktail are a little on the higher side.,0,0,0,Mia F.,"North Riverdale, Bronx, NY",0,3,0
1.0,3/7/2019,"One of the worst food experiences I've ever had.  I was meeting colleagues for lunch and arrived first.  The uber-obnoxious blonde at the door says ""You can wait at the bar for your party.""  OK, not exactly gracious but...I'm aware that many restaurants have a policy against seating partial groups  I said I'd rather wait at the table.  Her response:  ""You can wait at the bar for your party.""  Not, ""I'm sorry, we don't seat partial groups"" or anything remotely acceptable or welcoming.  3 minutes later the rest of the group arrived and we were seated.  Literally one minute after we sat down the waitress asked if we were ready to order  We said no.  1 minute later she returned with the same question.  Again we said no.  On her third trip two minutes later, we had decided.  I ordered the prix fixe (salad, swordfish kabob and sorbet).  The salad was a few pieces of mesclun, and 4 pieces of tomato.  The swordfish kabob had 3 tiny pieces of overcooked swordfish.  The sorbet arrived appearing as though it had partially melted and then been refrozen.  Please avoid this restaurant.  If it goes out of business, maybe something better will open up.  There are so many better Greek restaurants.",1,0,0,Kevin O.,"New York, NY",7,6,0
4.0,3/2/2019,"We took advantage of the happy hour special from 3pm to closing. We arrived there after 8pm and it was pretty much dead. The happy hour specials were $6 merlot, $6 Sauvignon blanc and $6 red sangria. The first time I was here years ago I had the Zucchini chips, which were greasy yet good especially when having the cocktail. The bartender gave us a small tasting of the sangria. My friend liked it, I didn't like it as much. I ended up with the merlot which tasted better. I don't know if the restaurant still have ladies night.

4.0,2/16/2019,"Right next to Grand Central Train Station so location is great. Servers are friendly and helpful but the food really took a long time to be served. However on my second visit which was for dinner , they did a little bit better.What is awesome , is that they show you a selection of fresh fish to choose from , then they go prepare it.

1.0,2/14/2019,This was one of the most mediocre meals I have had in New York City. The plethora of quality Greek restaurants in the city (i.e. Avra and Milos) makes you accustom to how Greek food should be prepared and what top notch service is. The Saganaki was doused in alcohol used to cook the dish on its way to your table. It was borderline uneatable and disgusting since it tasted like straight rubbing alcohol. We could not eat it and it was one of the worst dishes i have ever had anywhere. The lamb riblets (Plevrakia) were extremely average and not worth the order. We ended our meal with the whole fish of Fagri which was fine but not worth $41 and the mixed vegetables side was average at best. We preceded to cancel our dessert and get the check as quickly as possible to get out of there. We jokingly said that we should just pay for the meal and not even wait to the get the fish since we knew it would be mediocre at best. I have never written a Yelp review before but this experience was so poor that I was inclined to do so on this occasion! Don't forget the waitresses were terrible as well.,0,0,0,Peter D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",202,1,0

3.0,12/17/2018,"3.5...Clearly a place for the convenient lunches from the local businesses from the Met building to up and down Park for those with the resources to either peddle their wares or invest as such. Our party partook in the salads and lamb, albeit with a level of promptness due to the need to get to another meeting. While the hummus was tasty the lamb was dry and the salads felt to be underwhelming. However the location was quite convenient and the service reasonable with accommodations made for one our party due to his ambulatory state. One of our party commented that we'd need to come again when we weren't so rushed in order to truly evaluate the offering. My sentiments as well.",0,0,0,Bertrand L.,"Burnaby, Canada",19,215,109

1.0,8/24/2018,"THIS PLACE IS A RIP OFF - AVOID!!I have eaten here a few times because I like Greek food and it's convenient to Grand Central. It's nothing special but the location for commuters is a draw. Last night I went with two friends at my suggestion. My friends ordered the shared whole fish option which was pricey to begin with at $42 per person without sides. (The fish is charged by the pound and the menu recommends one pound per person which is what they ordered.) They chose the red snapper. The waitress returned from the kitchen to report that there were no more large red snapper to share but instead offered two individual fish. They chose this option assuming it was the same deal. When the bill came, the fish was a whopping $107!! Again, this was before you add sides! $53.50 each for fish! We are not talking dry aged steak at a top steak restaurant. We talked to the manager who insisted that the fish was charged by the pound and that was the price for what we got. He didn't care that they originally ordered one pound each. He was dismissive of our complaint which was very annoying - our total bill was $330, not including drinks at the bar beforehand so taking off the extra $23 would have been the right thing to do. Not wanting to punish the waitress, we still left a $15 tip each. It would have been $20 each but for this overcharge. If you want mediocre food at a ridiculously high price and like being ripped off, this is the place for you. Otherwise avoid like the plague.",0,0,0,Janet W.,"New York, NY",0,3,0

1.0,8/20/2018,"Unfortunate that they sell a horrible 3 course throw away menu for 42 dollars, with all the waiters telling you the food is good when they have no idea it's both over seasoned and under seasoned.While sitting there and trying to swallow down the disgusting over salted lamb and the fish of the day with old vegetables, the seemingly regulars are being server something worth less than 42 dollars that could have been recommended to you instead of the poo you're eating.After i tried and failed i asked for a manager, who only took one of the disgusting things off the receipt. the bill was still 65 bucks i could have gone home eaten left overs and not spent 65 dollars, or they could train their waiters to do their job and say the truth about the crappy food on the menu.For god's sake recommend a salad if you don't know.disappointed.",0,0,0,Hadiza D.,"San Francisco, CA",1,2,0
3.0,8/14/2018,"I have mixed feeling for this restaurant! I love the really nice and relax atmosphere, plus convenient location by Grand Central which is great! My husband and I noticed there were more 'corporate' dinning than regulars, but it's quite busy on a Monday night regardless. The food wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either. For appetizer, we ordered the saganaki-flaming graviera cheese, can't go wrong with that! We picked the King Shrimp and Mediterranean White Snapper (both by the pound) for our main courses. We were a bit disappointed on the texture/mouthfeel of the King Shrimps($62/lb). It wasn't as firm/crunchy as we anticipated on fresh perfectly cooked shrimp should be, but it taste pretty good tho. The Grilled White Snapper ($65/lb) was okay, lacking flavor to my taste. Overall, I don't think it was worth that price point ($202 before tips) for an okay dinner.",3,0,1,Grace W.,"Long Island City, New York, NY",7,149,379
2.0,8/14/2018,"To begin, due to condensation dripping from overhead cooling system, the floor was wet around several tables and there was even a gentleman with a makeshift mop (?) trying to absorb the water before it dripped onto the customers below!  I started with a half dozen blue point oysters, 2 were disgusting and the other 4, although palatable, were the worst blue points I have ever had.  I told the server who did absolutely nothing - did not apologize, did not offer to bring replacements, did not offer a refund... NOTHING.  I then had the crab cakes for my entree and they tasted old, possibly freezer burned.  Very disappointed, as the venue is appealing to the eye and the menu looked promising.  I won't be returning.",0,0,0,Lisa A.,"Scarsdale, NY",0,4,0
4.0,8/12/2018,"My boyfriend and I had a restaurant week dinner here. First, we were seated upstairs where there was a birthday party table. They hadn't started dinner yet but were already so loud that we weren't quite able to hear each other, so we asked to get another seat. The seats we got downstairs had much better ambience. What we liked: The bread with raisins in it that came before our meal, the spinach spanakopita, the lamb shank over orzo, the sole (although the portion was a tad small), the sauvignon blanc they recommended with the fish, and the yiaourti (yogurt, honey, and walnut dessert). What we would skip next time: my boyfriend found the the dolmades (stuffed grape leaves) to be disappointing, the orzo and veggies that came with the fish was dry, and the walnut cake was too sweet.

3.0,7/15/2018,"I too was extremely impressed with the ambience of this venue. I came in here on a Thursday evening with my friend for drinks and had a wonderful time - happy hour really awesome, I chose a glass of sangria. At $6 you can't go wrong and the sangria was good!In spite of the less than stellar reviews based on that experience we decided to come back for lunch. Unfortunately that experience was not as outstanding. The service is standard. But the food does not live up to expectations. I ordered off the prix fixe Menu, at $33 which includes appetizer entrée and dessert. The salad was soggy was a little too much oil and not enough variety . The best thing about this entrée which was fish and vegetables were the vegetables that were absolutely delicious but the fish had Ann odd tasteThe  dessert was actually the highlight of the meal, Greek yogurt with honey and berries. The food was just mediocre at best. In addition I did not realize that we would be charged extra for the few pieces of Pita that they brought us upon request. It's just not that kind of restaurant .

2.0,7/8/2018,Seen 3 star on yelp and 4 1/2 on open table. We figured to give it a try being it was right across the street from the hotel we were staying at (The Roosevelt Hotel). Tonight was our first anniversary. Menu looked good and place looked nice. I'm being nice to say a 2 star. We're not ones to complain much but this place is not worth the money or time. Decor was nice but that was it. We were one of the other three customers there. It was about 9:00pm. It took them about 10 minutes to bring us water and then another 5 minutes for the champagne. We started off with the octopus as an appetizer. It was ok. The dirty plates stayed in front of us for 15 minutes till our food came out. We had the Dover sole which was ice cold and the lamb shank was no bigger then a chicken leg. Really. When they brought out the fish the plate and the fish was so hot. They must of nuked it for 3 minutes. There was no flavor. No one came by to ask how everything was or if we wanted another drink. During our time there I noticed the waitress bring beers and a rum and coke which I watched the manager make into the kitchen. Then they did it again. I'm all for having a drink but after work. Close the kitchen first. We won't be going back to this place again. Try another Mediterranean restaurant if your in Manhattan.,3,0,0,Norm K.,"Cypress, TX",0,1,0

Tried adding some salt and pepper to wake it up. Was hoping our main dishes would be more tasty. We had a whole Bronzino and half baked chicken with potato's and greens. These also were lacking in flavor. Since we were still hungry because we didn't eat much of our meals we went for dessert. Finally had something I enjoyed. The Baklava was a little different than I am accustomed to but it was very good. My wife had the Greek yogurt with honey, nuts and dark cherries. Also very good. Overall very disappointing.

Fish of the day - red snapper on a bed of colorful veggies. The presentation definitely triggered my appetite. Fish itself was chewy to the right extent, but the zucchini below made the dish a bit slushy. Soup - Portion is too little, felt like it was for a newborn. The huge bowl that it came in didn't help.

5.0,2/21/2018,"Second NYC restaurant week excursion and I couldn't have been happier. I heard very mixed reviews, many revolving around the fact that the Prix Fixe menu is partially precooked so it doesn't come out fresh. I said screw it, I'm grown. I can make my own decisions and I am glad I did. I started off with the spinakatova-- a spinach pastry with a tomato reduction and feta cheese plating. Oh wait, the BREAD. Guys, I am a carb FIEND. There was olive oil drizzled on top-- I DIED. Okay, back to the food. For my entree I had the salmon, medium well, with a beet salad. I'm not a huge fan of beets, but this was done right. May I mention that i am a huge pairings fan. I like my libations to compliment my food, so I had the Sauvignon Blanc (2016)-- beautiful. It was crisp, fruity, semi sweet. I finished the courses off with an almond cake and a vanilla bean gelato. Oh and one of my waitresses was Algerian and being Togolese myself, we conversed a bit in French, so that was nice.

The restaurant provides a complimentary bread and olives board for the table to share. For appetizer I had the grilled octopus, that was very tasty and not overly chewy, which I appreciate. For the main course I had the fish of the day, which was the swordfish, over a bed of couscous with a balsamic vinaigrette drizzled around the plate. I'm not sure if my fish was overcooked but the fish was not flaky at all and when I cut into it, the texture was more meatloaf-ish, something that I was not expecting our of a fish based dish. The couscous was delicious though.

A group of coworkers and I stopped by around 7 ish on a Tuesday night. We noticed they had a happy hour special going on until 8 p.m., so we figured we take full advantage of a boozy dinner. We ordered a pitcher of sangria which was mediocre, but wet the palette. The entire table decided to go with the Arni Yiouvetsti - a slow roasted lamb shank with tomato sauce over greek orzo. It arrived relatively quickly, and was quite tasty. Midway through my meal, I realized I needed my glass of water refilled. I mean, to be fair -- you should NEVER have to think ""I need my glass of water refilled."" I waited, and waited, and waited, and waited for a waiter to come refill my glass of water. I ended up just going through my entire meal and once the check came they STILL didn't refill my water. I was over it at that point and just really wanted to get home. Ammos Estiatorio was a one and done type of place. I did it, but probably won't be heading back.",3,1,1,Lauren P.,"Brooklyn, NY",187,323,9

2.0,8/27/2017,I went to this restaurant during restaurant week for a business lunch. The food is commercial and I felt rushed the whole time. The grilled calamari was okay but my chicken with orzo dish was subpar. I looked at the regular menu as well and prices are pretty high for the lack of authenticity.

2.0,8/15/2017,"Since this place is close to the office, my coworker and I came here for a lunch. Despite having a 1pm reservation we had to awkwardly wait for 10 minutes in the cramped entryway before getting seated. Once seated the service was more attentive which was good. We ordered the grilled octopus appetizer (decent--a bit on the chewy side), the meatballs (pass--pretty dry and flavorless), the dolmade (can't really go wrong with these tho they weren't the best I've had), and the spanikopita (didn't get to try this one).As my main I had a sole as was recommended by the waiter. I knew there was something wrong the moment I cut into it. Namely, I couldn't. Maybe sole is meant to be that way, but why anyone would pay 30+ dollars for a tough, overcooked fish is beyond me. Next time I'll definitely walk a bit further away from the office for a better bite.",2,0,1,Kat T.,"New York, NY",244,267,203

I should've trusted the 3-star Yelp review and skip this place...The meatballs were dry and hard. The grilled calamari was very bland. I ordered salmon well down and it's not even 50% cooked. I didn't bother to send it back because I do eat raw salmon, but with this kind of dish i preferred it cooked. And the beets pairing was just not working. The walnut cake dessert was terrible. Was that dough even ready to be baked?Also the 2-person tables were all places in tight aisles. The waiters kept bumping into our tables and no apologies were ever offered.Maybe if I order from the regular menu, I may have a better experience. But restaurants should understand that most people use restaurant week to try out the place, to see if it's worthwhile to come back at another time.

If you want an upscale greek food place without the crazy prices this is it.The atmosphere varies from a romantic table for two towards the windows or the front by the bar for a more lively scene. Giving it a romantic and fun vibe for everyone. Me and my boyfriend are regulars here. Lunch time, I even come for a more business atmosphere. It is always full and busy so you know the fish is always fresh.

Good for big family dinner, business meals or events.We got the menu and I was disappointed as it was not a brunch menu but groupon menu which has entrees listed for lunch/dinner. As far I know brunch involves eggs so even though we were there for brunch we end up having lunch. I ordered Fish of the day which was very delicious and filling.In the end we got the bill and we owe $4 taxes. I am glad they didn't include tip as many places started doing that. Tip & gratuity is customary not mandatory but nowadays restaurant started adding mandatory service charge & gratuity. We left the tip and left from there very satisfied.

3.0,2/6/2017,"I've been to Ammos Estiatorio several times and decided to take advantage of the restaurant week dinner menu. Consistent with past experiences, the food was amazing! I paid a $9 supplement to get the Garides Kataifi (shrimp wrapped in phyllo dough) as an appetizer and the additional cost was well worth it. The dough was just right and the yogurt sauce on top was delectable. Still dreaming about those. I wish I had more than three. For my entree I tried the Pasari (fish of the day)-another amazing culinary feat. The presentation was great and the fish itself was moist and well flavored. YUM! Couldn't pass up on the opportunity for an amazing wine pairing for the meal. The waitress recommended the Assyrtiko/Sauvignon and what a recommendation that was. Very nice complement to the meal. Here's why I gave this place three stars... I dined with a group of four and there were several lulls as we waited for service. We sat down and waited 15 minutes to place our orders. Once orders were placed we waited 10 minutes to get our wine. Once the entrees were delivered to the table, we had to request additional paper napkins and silverware three times....wanted to sample each other's plates. And finally to get the bill, we waited again. If the restaurant was full I'd understand but I went on a Monday night, there were only three other filled tables in the restaurant and I've gone during lunch time and had impeccable service.

2.0,2/3/2016,"This restaurant does business due to its prime location. That's it.  I work in midtown and have eaten there many times over the last decade but tonight's experience was worthy of some commentary.  The service was a joke. Several attempts before we got drinks, wine, or even  heard the specials etc.  The initial server was replaced due to incompetence, presumably. The drinks were sent back due to errors, along with the grilled octopus which tasted fishy, like sardines and was dry as a bone. I was afraid to swallow it in fear of getting sick later. I eat this dish frequently at a few other restaurants and it never tasted like what I sampled tonight. The main course and dessert were fine. At one point the manager was called over so we could voice  feedback. While he was friendly,  he did nothing to apologize and instead defended the restaurant in every respect. The waitress was more accommodating and comped a few items which was more appropriate; this meal was a business expense and the gesture was appreciated more so than the actual cost savings. Separately this is the same restaurant that refused to seat a coworker of mine due to being  10 mins late for a lunch reservation.  My colleague and his clients were sent to the bar due to their tardiness.

2.0,2/3/2016,"Such an odd experience. I am in the city for work (live in Austin, TX) and wanted to have a nice dinner to catch up with coworkers. We decided to give Ammos a try so I made a reservation. This is when it all went down hill. When we showed up the hostess acted as if she would not seat us. She kept mentioning our entire party had to be present but when I pulled up the reservation confirmation it stated three people - and three people stood before her. Finally we were seated and decided to order a round of drinks. Almost 30 minutes later...still no drinks. Our drinks came out with our food which was pretty disappointing but we let it go. The food was great which was a plus (only reason it's two stars). Except we were never asked if we wanted another drink, the food was taken before we were done and just an hour into arriving the manager asked us to leave stating he needed the table and was ""so slammed"". Please note we did not just order apps and hold a table all night. It was a Wednesday, we spent almost $200 between the three of us and stayed an hour. He offered us a free drink at the bar but it was too late to fix the rudeness of this night. The bar was cramped - nowhere for us to sit and continue catching up. All in all awful. I've experienced quick service in the city - but this was not that. It was simply rude. Definitely not worth your time if you want to enjoy a meal and catch up with friends.

I realize you often have to read between the lines of some reviews as oftentimes the reviewer may have another agenda. Plus I feel reviews on restaurants during Restaurant Week or New Years Eve/ Valentines Day should be taken lightly. I was looking for a restaurant to meet my sister & brother-in- law for lunch near Grand Central this Saturday. Almost all of the favored ones were either closed for lunch or serving brunch. When I saw the Ammos review I was impressed by the photos of the restaurant but I was hesitant to suggest it because of all the poor reviews.I'm glad I didn't.It is a pretty and  spacious restaurant...the reviewers who commented on the tight space must have never been to the small midtown restaurants. Plus the servers were attentive and very pleasant...which I find most are if you take time to engage them. And we all agreed our dishes were great. We stuck with the $33 (+6 for lamb) prix fixe lunch which we thought was fair. Mind you, if you compare it to the usual Greek places then it is pricey. But everything was fresh, simply prepared and tasty. My husband loved his snapper as we did our lamb chops. My brother-in-law thought the chops and the baklava was one of the best he'd ever had. The baklava was not super sweet or soaked In honey and the Greek yoghurt flan was delicious. I felt this place needed a better review than most of the postings.

My friend and I each ordered a glass of white wine and appetizers - calamari and fried zucchini and eggplant chips. Both were really good, and each came with it's own special sauce. Only complaint is that sometimes the zucchini and eggplant chips were super salty on one side and other chips had no seasoning on it at all. Not a huge deal, but when you charge $20 for zucchini and eggplant sliced thinner than a penny, you really should season everything properly. The service was really good, almost to the point of being annoying. Our water glasses were constantly filled and never empty, and our waiter came up to us 3 times asking if everything was okay. That's 3 times in the hour that we were there, and then the bus boy literally circled our table like a shark before coming up to us and asking if we were finished with our food (we were not). Then our waiter came up a couple of minutes later and asked us again if we were done with our food (still not done). There were no lines for tables at the bar, and there were plenty of empty bar tables so I'm not sure why they kept coming up to us and interrupting our conversation.

I had the fish of the day which was a tiny portion for the $38 price tag and it was covered in a peppery sauce. This is to be expected of restaurants near Grand Central so beware of price hikes.

When someone has a berry allergy, you do NOT bring berries to them on a plate. I don't care if its on top of the pudding or next to the pudding, do not bring freaking berries.Oh to top of our horrible dinner, we got there at 530pm, and had signed the check by 710pm.

3.0,10/5/2014,"Food (4/5)   Decor (4/5)   Service (4/5)   Value (2/5)Ammos Estiatorio is a nice Greek restaurant that specializes in fish. Unique to the experience was a waiter who brought out a platter of raw fish to illustrate to us the availabilities for the evening. Food was certainly above average, especially the Octopodi appetizer. I have had octopus many times before, but never has it been as tender or tasty as they made it here. That was the best part of the meal though. The fish, while the center of attention of this restaurant, was just marginally above average. It was fairly flavorful on top where all the seasoning was, but failed to be quite as flavorful throughout. This restaurant screams corporate dinner to me a bit because it fails to deliver a lot of value. The fish are charged on a per pound basis with most of them running in the $30-40 per pound range. A little bit pricey for a pound of fish in my opinion.

Iced Latte tasted like Iced Water With A Shot of powdered coffee in it. The salmon tasted like it sat in a vat of olive oil for 4 days. And what's more, they really skimp on the portions. My $30 salmon sat on less of a bed of orzo, and more of a sleeping bag of orzo. So Ammos. Listen t' me.

Sat down in the front area nice place smells like fish ..eeuu  so not a good thing well at least not for me.They have decent specials , wine , mix drinks not bad I guess ? I am guessing that If u stick w wine u will be ok . Mix Drinks not so much !! Vodka & cranberry ?? I did say that I got cranberry juice !!! Really ? I know it's happy hour & they feel they have to cut some corners but Damm so not good at all !! It's like charge me a lil more & give a drink that actually has some alcohol in it. Gin & Tonic no better , tasted like soap ughhh. I don't know the place is nice , maybe the food is good ?

Our trio grabbed up a high top table in the bar area and waited ( a little longer than I would have liked) for menus. We decided to try something out of the box and went with a bottle of Restina for our first round. We are in the planning stages of a trip to Greece and out server assured us this wine was a staple.A little into our wine we received a spread of complimentary apps fried eggplant, greek yogurt , and spinach and feta balls. Everything was fried and delicious .Our second bottle of wine was more of a hit it had the essence of pine trees and was very drinkable. We chatted with the owner who gave us some great tips for planning our trip to Greece. The restaurant started to get a little busy towards the end of our HH but service was European(slower than normal) . I actually like not being bothered and to be able to enjoy my food and drink so if your a fast diner that wants to get in and get out I would probably say that coming here and sitting at the bar would be your safest bet.i wouldn't rush back to midtown to come to this place but if I found myself in close proximity to grand central I would stop in.",0,0,1,Aaliyah P.,"Philadelphia, PA",310,588,500
3.0,2/15/2012,"Good food, everything else was kind of bad. We were sitting at an admittedly large table (8 people) but the servers had consistent problems getting the basics right. We ordered wine and it took an extraordinarily long amount of time for the wine to actually be poured into our glasses. One of the guys at our table had to repeatedly prompt the server for wine, and other basic things that should have been automatic. Four of us ordered coffee after dinner, only three of us got it. When you're paying a boat load for a nice dinner in Manhattan, these issues simply should not come up. That said, the food mostly saved the day. Good range of seafood, chicken and lamb, all at the table were satisfied. The french fries were surprisingly nice too. Dessert was also varied and lovely. Perhaps it was an off night or new people working, but if they get their staff trained up a bit better, then Ammos could distinguish itself as it has a solid and fairly unique menu of real quality.",3,1,2,Justin L.,"Arlington, VA",19,296,4
1.0,2/9/2012,"After hearing great things about this place for a long time, I decided to try it out with some girl friends during restaurant week. We had a terrible experience. To you I submit the following:1. Super slow service. We were seated for about 20 mins before we had to ask for a menu. I've experienced European service, but 20 minutes is a tad on the long side. We also had to ask for the restaurant week menu, after which it all went down hill.2. Table wasn't set properly and water had a piece of orzo in it, usually not a big deal, but when you add it to everything else it matters.3. Condescending waiter. When I asked for the specials, he told me that there are no specials for the restaurant week menu, and when i said i wasn't ordering from the restaurant week menu, he said ""this is a Greek seafood restaurant, so the fish"". Also, when I asked for a description of the preparation of the Greek salad, he told me ""this isn't a diner"". Lastly, at the end of my meal I wanted a Greek coffee, I asked for it at least 3 times and he kept saying ""regular coffee"" and I thought I had been clear that I wanted Greek coffee. Also, he did not bring the dessert menu for me (i was the only one who ordered ala carte and rightfully should have been shown the menu). I asked if I could have baklava and he said ""I'll see what I can do"", which I didn't understand because it was on the menu.4. I was never asked to check my coat and it was repeatedly touched and trampled on by the restaurant staff. Finally when I made enough faces the manager came and took it. Also, they kept running into my chair and hitting my ponytail (I have very thin shoulder length hair...so it's not like it was a giant thing sticking way out into the walkway).5. The food simply wasn't that great, the vegetables in the greek salad were not very fresh. The cucumbers and tomatoes were soggy while the yellow tomatoes lacked flavor and actually were under-ripe. The spanakopita was merely okay. The presentation of the dishes were sloppy. The dolmades basically looked like someone slopped them onto a plate. My friends ordered the lamb, moussaka and the salmon and no one was raving about how great it was. The baklava was nothing to write home about.6. I complained to the manager upon leaving and he was nothing but defensive and had an answer/excuse for everything. I listed to him my complaints above and he  basically did nothing. Although, he gave me his card and ""hopes I come back and give them another chance"". Fat chance, what would entice me to come back? To top it all off, after I left, they cancelled my reservation on open table so that I can't give them a review!!!! The nerve!If I could give this place a zero rating I would. If you really have a hankering for some tasty Greek, go to Kellari Taverna it's just a few blocks away, the service is impeccable, and the food is better, fresher and more flavorful.",5,3,0,Tia T.,"Hicksville, NY",30,209,15

2.0,2/1/2012,"Fantastic Food. Abysmal Service.Nice-looking Greek spot known for their by-the-pound fish specials steps away from Grand Central. What one would expect at this mostly businessmen spot (at least at lunch) is quick and attentive service. Come expecting this and you will leave sorely disappointed.My mother and I arrive around 12:30pm, the place is about 60-70% full. We are seated right next to the server station (while there are plenty of better open seats - & we had a reservation to boot). 10 minutes pass, we finally get water. 30 minutes pass and we have not been greeted by a waiter or been given menus. Unacceptable.40 minutes go by, we get menus and 2 minutes later are asked what we'd like! We JUST got our menus, come on. . .I order one of the lunch specials, and I do have to concede that all of the food on the table was delicious. My mother orders some sort of octopus salad - divine. I get the spinach pie (perfect & warm) followed 45 minutes later (!!!) by a lamb burger. Of course, in this time, my mother has finished her meal and is itching to get out to make it to her business meeting while I am just being served a medium-rare burger. So, in short, despite sitting right next to the servers, ordering a meal that takes 5 minutes to prepare, I have waited almost 1.5 hours before the main dish arrives. What the hell? No apologies, nothing seemed unusual to the maitre'd, who comes over and pats me on the back (condecendingly) while asking how I enjoyed the food. Maybe he'd get the hint that we asked for the bill and the dessert (came with the meal) to-go prior to even receiving my meal. Nope.Maybe their servers need to be reminded what city they are in. The food is excellent, but avoid at all costs if you are in any kind of hurry. A 2-hour casual lunch is not for everyone. . .",2,1,0,David B.,"Brooklyn, NY",79,292,108
1.0,1/1/2012,"I went to this place for New Year's Eve for the first time. They had a package for $60 that included buffet and open bar from 9pm till midnight (yeah right!). When I bought the tickets a few days before the big night, the person who sold them to me (named Angelos) completely lied to me about what was supposed to happen that night. He reassured me that we were going to have a table for the dinner.The big night comes, we arrive at Ammos at 10pm and we had to STAND IN LINE to get in, despite that we bought the tickets upfront and the place was half-empty. As if this wasn't enough, they would let people in ahead of us that didn't even have a ticket! After standing outside for 20-30 min, they let us in to face almost no tables in there. The few that were left in were used for bottle service (although the manager orinally said that this was supposed to happen after midnight and the end of the buffet). The buffet was a disappointment: they had 4 different types of dips, pita bread, greek salad and ravioli and shrimps. The worst part was the ""open bar"": there was only a small bar in a  corner with two barmen and half the people in the club crowded around it to get  their drinks. So you had to wait at least 20 min for a drink! It's easy to calculate how many drinks you could get during this ""open bar"" session (I only had two). Apart from this, you were only allowed to have either vodka or Hennessy - something that no one told us before going there.Last part: after midnight the place was suppose to continue as a club till late. Around 00.30 am, the music stops. We found out that there was a fight or something, they threw the guy out and he got the police. From what i understood, the police was checking their licenses and wouldn't let them continue their program because they probably didn't have the permit to do so.Bottom line: spoiled new year's eve, lies from the managers and complete lack of professionalism on behalf of the people who run the place!I'll never go there again!!!",3,0,0,Constantinos Z.,"New York, NY",59,6,2
1.0,12/24/2011,"This review is based on how the management at Ammos mishandled our rehearsal dinner the night before our wedding this past October.We chose Ammos to host our rehearsal dinner because we had been happy with the food, service and treatment on several prior occasions.  In July, we met with two managers who seemed very eager to please and went over the details of our 60 person event with us seemingly very carefully.  We told them that we wanted a private event and they agreed, stipulating that we had to be out by 9:30pm because they had another party coming in. I recall this conversation distinctly because they were very hesitant at first to offer a ""buy out,"" because it was Saturday night, but they did, in fact, agree to let us have the place to ourselves until 9:30pm. In the contract we received soon after, the dinner was listed as ""private event.""As the event drew closer, we discussed a couple of changes to the menu: one of which was extremely important. My Aunt is extremely allergic to fish--she could go into anaphylaxis--and we made it very clear fish had to be taken off the menu.  We also made a point of saying that we wanted our guests to be able to get up and make speeches. They assured us that they had a microphone and sound system that we could use for this purpose.So...the Big Night comes and we arrive early to get ready.  We are shown where our tables are all set-up and we see another table of 25 set that was not a part of our number but right next to us.  When we asked what this was, the manager present said that it was a birthday party that was coming in.  Our stomachs fell to our feet.  When we asked about our private event that we were promised, the manager told us that we had a ""private event""--that the table of 25 was also a ""private event""--and that there was yet another ""private event"" that was going to be in the loft area upstairs and visible from our ""private event.""  The manager said that they never agreed on a ""buy out,"" but they absolutely did.  To make matters worse, as we were in the heat of discussing our distress and disappointment over their failure to live up to what any reasonable person would consider a ""private event,"" they started seating random people that were coming in off the street for dinner.As if you couldn't see this coming, they served a fish spread when they were specifically told no fish could be served. Luckily, as soon as we realized this, we swept it off the table where my Aunt was dining.  Disaster averted.  Nothing ruins a rehearsal dinner more than one of the key guests dropping dead from an allergic reaction. Oh yes, and the microphone they promised us for our speeches--now being made in a room of our friends, family and a whole gaggle of strangers dining and having their own ""private event"" in the same room--was hanging from the loft area down into the main dining room, like they have at a boxing match.  Ugggh.Fortunately, our friends and family were very happy for us and in the mood to celebrate and we did not let these setbacks ruin our evening.  We felt sorry for the birthday party who also expected a ""private event' and were compromised.  So, we overcame the obstacles and had a wonderful evening, despite what was promised and certainly not delivered.We will never give any more business to Ammos in the future, nor will any of our family or friends.  The management really blew it.",8,4,1,Kim G.,"New York, NY",116,22,10

2.0,12/9/2011,"Usually a decent Greek spot in midtown, today I had probably the worst lunch I've ever experienced in Manhattan. Everything was absolutely horrible. The only reason I gave it two stars was because the manager came to the table to apologize for the long wait and offer us a bottle of wine.  We sent the grilled calamari back. The saganaki went back as well. Nothing was cooked properly from start to finish.  Dishes were coming out randomly.  It was a complete disaster.  I think maybe their grill and broiler went down right at noon. Not a good thing for a Greek fish house.  And the place was packed. $250 for 4 people, lunch, no booze.  That's just crazy.  I've been to ammos a few times and it was always fairly good.  Maybe just a bad day. Maybe new management. Whatever it was, I won't eat there again.

4.0,7/3/2011,"We went there around 8ish on a Saturday evening, and surprisingly it wasn't busy. Only a couple of tables with couples or small groups.Nice decoration that deviates from the folkloric norm. Also, it's very quiet which can be ideal for certain occasions. I suggest calling in advance because sometimes they host wedding parties and Greek nights that can be pretty loud.Let's start with the appetizer. We had zucchini fritters and grilled octopus. Both were excellent! The fritters had a nice blend of kefalograviera which gave them a nice creamy texture, while the octopus was tender and unbelievably tasty. The Greek salad was OK, and I should have opted for their oriental one that has nuts and berries. Their walnut and raisin bread, in addition to the olive one, was freshly baked and so yummy.For main course, we had the fagri with lemon roasted tomatoes and the Aegean pasta. They were fantastic! I felt I was eating them somewhere along the Greek coastline. It would have better if the pasta carried more of the ouzo aromas. Maybe in the future, they can introduce astakomakaronada (lobster pasta) that although a traditional dish, it is equally fine flavored and super tasty.The wine list is extensive and we were able to pick a very good one. The description of the wines though is a bit problematic, so you better be a bit cautious. The dessert was also very good. They didn't have the manouri cheesecake, so we had the walnut pie. It was flaky and not too sweet,  having the right amount of syrup and making it a nice accompany to the ice cream.

3.0,5/9/2011,"I had high hopes for Ammos. The reviews I had read indicated that it served sophisticated Greek food in an elegant atmosphere. It sounded like the perfect place to have dinner with friends I hadn't seen in several years so we booked a table for a Friday night in early May.Ammos was located right next to Grand Central Station on a side street. The décor featured a variety of textures (stone, wood, etc...) in shades of brown and beige. It was a beautiful night and the tall windows were open to let in a pleasant cool breeze. The menu looked interesting and listed a number of Greek specialities (moussaka, grilled shrimp, saganaki, keftedes, etc...). So far, so good.  HOWEVER. For some reason, Ammos decided to host a Greek wedding rehearsal dinner in half of the open plan main dining room that night and thus patrons like me could not escape the interminable slide show shown on an enormous screen which documented in excruciating detail the groom and bride to be's past life (including the obligatory naked in the bathtub photos). As if the loud chatter of Greek wedding guests seated right next to us was not sufficiently distracting, the wedding guests gleefully took their turns with the microphone to broadcast their, uh, ""salty stories"" about the bride and groom across the whole restaurant!  It was unbelievable to be paying $25 - $40 for an entrée and be forced into involuntary servitude at a stranger's Greek wedding. I finally had enough and went up to the Manager. I told him that it was completely unacceptable for other patrons to have to listen to speeches, much less see the endless photos of these random people up on their big screen, during dinner. The guy apologized and said that the speeches were only intended to last ""5 minutes"". To his credit, he soon took their microphone away and gave us a complimentary (and unasked for) platter of dessert. However the evening felt ruined and we paid our $120 per couple check and fled before the Greek dancing and plate throwing began.I would hope that the wedding rehearsal dinner was an anomaly and not indicative of what Ammos wants to be known for.

Food wise, they have all the Greek staples. My fav, spankopita, feta cheese with spinach wrapped in phillo dough. The dough is never too soft or too crisp, and the filling is the right balance of cheese vs spinach. I ended up with the grilled salmon, a healthy portion and quite filling. Since we ordered off the pre-theater menu it came with dessert, I opted for the honey semolina cake and my friend got the walnut cake.

The  decor is quite lovely and the waiters are friendly and professional. The crowd is a little stuffy (business people, a bit of an older crowd).But despite this being a seafood restaurant, I would not come here for seafood. The crabcakes tasted and smelled very fishy. I had the lamb shank which pulled apart from the bone so easily, and the hint of nutmeg was a wonderful touch. The others in my party had the greek salad, mousaka and sea bass; all which were tasty. However, my friend that had the shellfish linguine was very disappointed. Please understand that my foodie friend will eat almost anything. Rarely does she complain about food that even tastes bad. But when she let me try one of the mussels, I almost gagged. She barely touched her meal, nor did she complain about the dish. When ordering dessert (the Greek yogurt with fruits and honey was decadently yummy) the waiter brought over a complimentary bottle of wine.So, the seafood may not be great, and the other food is mediocre for the prices.

He actually told me to go in the closet and look myself because he was being overwhelmed by angry customers waiting for their coat. One guy said he waited half an hour for him to get his jacket. Either don't use coat check here, or don't come here at all. If you do come here, you can leave your coat in their booths. At least it won't be lost and you won't wait in line a total of 30 minute to give and get back your coat, at 3-5 bucks. Music was decent. And it wasn't too packed. Only a few good-looking girls. That may sound shallow, but we all get dolled up and go to the club to be seen. It's the one place where looks matter. To be honest, there were more good-looking guys than girls. I give the two stars for these reasons: I got on a list and didn't have to pay a cover. Only waited about 20 minutes to get in. Which is nothing compared to Hollywood BS.

Very good music by the DJ who played everything and bouncer were cool...Only thing that threw me off was that it was $15 to get in to the place when I was already on my friends guestlist but $15 compared to what it could of been $20, $25 or in some cases $40. So it wasn't that bad.Other than that a very nice spot to have a birthday outing!",2,0,0,Jay L.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",162,600,50
1.0,11/22/2010,"Poor! ""crispy calamari"" appetizer, as recommended by the completely indifferent and unattentive wait staff, came, no kidding, less than 2 minutes after we ordered.  Naturally, it was neither crispy nor hot/freshly prepared.  Meatballs with orzo were ""eh"" at best, very poorly/sloppily presented, like someone slapped a spoonful of orzo on the middle of 4 lame meatballs.  This was cafeteria food, tops.  Walnut cake at dessert was not bad, but could not make up for the sloppy and careless presentation and preparation of the room temperature food.  Lovely place, awful food experience.",1,1,0,dennis c.,"Queens, NY",0,12,0

2.0,10/26/2010,"I came here for lunch yesterday with my work colleagues.  In the city where there are many upscale and good Greek restaurants, this place ranks far below others in quality, though I can only speak from my lunch experience.  I had moussaka and my colleagues had salad.  Their version of moussaka was basically fatty ground meat on top of sliced potatoes and eggplants covered with rich bechamel sauce.  There was a pool of grease in the bottom of the bowl and I decided to stop eating after half way through.  The greens in my colleagues' salad were wilted and did not look at all appetizing.  During the meal, we saw a bird flying above us in the restaurant...  I will not go back.22 points on Zagat.",5,1,1,Akira O.,"New York, NY",74,401,73

3.0,9/5/2010,"After a happy hour outside at Beer Bar tuned sweltering hot, I wanted to go into the first restaurant in sight to sit down, in air conditioning, and eat something other than bar food before I passed out. Since Ammos was directly across the street, we said ""done!"" and went inside. The setting was quiet and elegant and a total relief - I felt like I had walked out of a frat house and into an upscale adult dinner party.They brought out complimentary olives, assorted bread, and a little cube of watermelon with feta cheese on top. But the overall dining experience was a tad mediocre given the expensive price tag. Our server was certainly polite and gracious enough, but we constantly had to flag him down to the point where we were asking bus boys for water, for a dessert menu, to take up our bill.  We ordered the octapodi appetizer - charcoal grilled mediterranean octopus, onions, capers, red wine vinaigrette - a little pricey at $19, but there was plenty to share. A little heavy on the salt. The best part of the meal was the main course. We each had the Htenia Risotto - the pan seared scallops, shaved asparagus in an english pea risotto with kefalograviera cheese. It was a pleasing texture and the scallops were seared to perfection.After some Pinot Noir, a disappointing dessert, and a coffee, I was a little taken back when I saw the final bill - until we walked back over to happy hour and learned my coworkers had racked up a $450 tab on cheap beers and bar food. I had spent more than I had anticipated on the evening, but at least I got a gourmet meal out of mine.",1,1,0,Cara L.,"Charleston, SC",19,79,0
5.0,8/5/2010,"Excellent restaurant! The atmosphere is really modern and pleasant. Unfortunately I was there on Greek night so the live band was kind of annoying especially considering it was nearly midnight when I ate there. I had the lamb ""chops"" (can't remember the name of the dish) appetizer and they were EXCELLENT. I also tried my friend's Chilean sea bass which was also excellent. The food and service were really top notch. My only gripe was the loud music but like I said that was only one night so I'm sure on all other nights it's a really pleasant and relaxing dinner.

For the first restaurant this time, I picked this Greek restaurant, Ammos Estiatorio.I gotta say, the ambiance of this place is great! Their spinach pie was a great appetizer, and I loved it! Meatballs with risotto wasn't that great though; Risotto was not well cooked. Greek yogurt was very different. nutty, fruity, sweet, and sour! can't tell if I liked it or not, but it was just different. Our waitstaff was kind, but my friends complained that she kept spilling wine while pouring. Another complaint was that the foods were not presentable, and uneven portion.

4.0,4/12/2010,"Ammos is a great Greek spot in midtown near Grand Central. There is a restaurant and bar portion. The girls and I come here on Saturdays for pregaming purposes when we don't really feel like going out to dinner. It's a really classy joint with a great bar.They have some delicious appetizers but we usually opt for the deliciously phenomenal cheese, bread, and olives that are complimentary. (Dirrrrttyy rich). Cocktails are pretty cheap (less than $8) too. Entrees are pretty pricey so we steer clear.The bartenders are so so friendly and super speedy. Angela is the best! She always gets sexy tips from us!The overall feel is so much more grown up than out other pre-game places. Its a great start to the night.

I'm not.  I enjoyed the appetizer, which was a row of raw fishies, and the cocktails, which were quite stiff, but, hey, it's all good. I didn't at all enjoy the risotto, which was doused with enough salt and cheese to warrant a small reservoir of aforementioned cocktails as chasers. The best thing Ammos had to offer was its ambiance - it's large and it's got these great high ceilings and big, dramatic windows.

3.0,7/14/2008,"Usually I'm not a first-time-visit reviewer. However, my experience today just left such an indelibly distinct impression on me that I had to share. Now, I recognize you're probably wondering ""how can it be such a distinct impression if all you're doing is giving it 3 -- by nature AVERAGE -- stars?"" Bear with me here...I'm of the opinion that, for the most part, like begets like. Geniality/cordiality  begets geniality/cordiality (unless you've watched ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" in which case all bets are off).  With that in mind, what the HELL is the problem with the waitstaff here?????? This place gets negative NEGATIVE stars based on the solo diner theory (which I postulated here yelp.com/biz/bus-stop-ca… and here yelp.com/biz/fetch-bar-a…). Of course, I did not live up to (down to?) their expectations and still left my 20+% tip (killing them with kindness??), but somehow I doubt that was even appreciated. I was seated right away without a reservation (+), but then I was left there (1) with the second place setting still at the table (--) and (2) waiting...waiting....WAITING for a menu, which the waiter might not even have brought over to me if I hadn't made SIGNIFICANT eye contact when he came to serve the table next to mine, upon which he said something like ""oh, I will get you a menu"" (--!!!).  Following that, I didn't have my water refilled, nobody checked up on me, and bread only came after my entree and ONLY after I asked whether the stew would come with bread (uh...because that kind of makes sense, right??). Finally, after the meal was over (during which time I SWEAR I've been friendly and smiley throughout -- because I just am a friendly and smiley person, you know, ESPECIALLY when I have just gotten out of work EARLY...which is UNHEARD OF), I handed over my credit card. He swiped it and brought the billfold and card back. And after I wrote in the tip (the...AHEM....20+% tip), he took it away. Took it away!! Isn't that rude? Aren't they just supposed to let you leave it on the table...linger over your wine or cheese or whatever it is that People Who Lunch do? Good grief.Thus, no matter HOW good the food was -- and the Mediterranean fish stew with shellfish, jumbo shrimp, and white fish was VERY good with fresh FRESH seafood that I, having just returned from California, would more than readily criticize here if it were not fresh -- I cannot in good conscience award any greater than three stars. And, to be honest, the three stars already feels pretty generous. In terms of atmosphere, upon sitting down, I liked the place with its light and airy feel with the glass-windowed kitchen and wood-and-white-and-tan color theme, but upon getting up, I could not WAIT to get the F outta there.I guess I could always go back to check on whether this was just a bad...BAD day for Ivan, but really....with so many food options out there (and classy/upscale joints just like this one), why bother?",7,7,5,Audrey J.,"Los Angeles, CA",605,618,78

Coffee, Dark Chocolate, & one other( i can't remember maybe a nut one, i'm not sure).
