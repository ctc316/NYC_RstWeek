4.0,2/15/2019,"This is a really good neighborhood restaurant with exceptionally good food.  I am in a wheelchair and they have a great lift to get into and out of the restaurant and they are happy to assist (not true of all accessible restaurants).  The restaurant is pretty, the tables spaced far apart for good conversation and the service is excellent.  The food is really quite good.  Been there twice.  Roman artichokes are excellent as is the vitello tonnato (actually one of the best in the city).  Risotto is excellent as well.  Pastas are perfect.  Desserts are excellent.  Dinner here is excellent and the prices are good, making for a very good value.It is a great addition to the midtown east food scene.",0,0,0,Paul G.,"New York, NY",204,145,0
5.0,1/28/2019,"Went here with my family for restaurant week and we were blown away. I have to say the items from the regular menu are a tad overpriced for what you get, but the price fixe is phenomenal. I'm not usually a fish person but this grilled sea bream was amazing. Plated well and seasoned beautifully. The service is great, and the waiters are very attentive. Hummus is served with the bread which was phenomenal. The chicken was moist and the red peppers and potatoes that came with it were also great. I would highly recommend going here for restaurant week.",1,0,0,Claira G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,9,4
3.0,1/25/2019,"Went here for NYC Restaurant Week, and I had to say I definitely expected more! The gnocchi appetizer was average as was the lasagne entree.

1.0,12/14/2018,"What a horrible experience! I ordered from this place through Uber eats, and they never delivered my food but reported it as delivered. I sent in three different complaint emails to Uber eats, and they never responded. I am obviously filing a credit card dispute. I realize this is a problem with Uber eats and not the restaurant, but then when I called the restaurant to let them know what happened, the guy hung up on me!

1.0,8/2/2018,"The food was decent BUT the service was a sheer atrocity!  We were here for a dinner around 8 and were mostly ignored despite the fact that the restaurant was only 35-40% full with plenty of servers.  The food itself was decent : solid but nothing that stood out.Food recap:1. Veal polpette: Edible but quite bland and the portion was literally tiny 3 bite-sized meatballs that were on the dry side.  The tomato base was watery and the accompanying greens were not even dressed.  Skip2.  Seared scallops over cauliflower, quinoa, and zucchini slaw: This was solid with firm, nicely seared scallops (3) over a creamy slaw.  The quinoa added a nice crunchy texture.3. Lamb shank: Not bad but definitely on the dry side and with no jus.  It is served over a potato puree with maybe 3 sauteed Brussels sprouts.  It was just edible. 4. Seared salmon: We asked for medium rare - the TINY piece of salmon came out very dry and well-done.  The sauteed cabbage was also not fully cooked.   5. Tiramisu: The balance of cream to cake was off - there was barely a hint of coffee flavoring as the cream was overwhelming.6. Bread: This was VERY dry and the accompanying dip was so bland that i would have literally preferred plain EVOO.Now on to the service.  It was awful if not non-existent.  Some major faux pas:1. We were served sparkling instead of still water and had to flag down 3 times to rectify the error.2. Water was NEVER refilled and we again had to flag down a server.3. Our appetizer plates were never replaced despite asking twice.4. Our food was served last - 3 parties that ordered well after we did received their entrees before we even had our appetizers served.5. We had to ask for the check 3 times - and then try to get the attention of the 2 servers who literally stared at us and refused to walk over.It was honestly one of the worst service experiences I have had on the UES.  Maybe they ONLY serve their regulars?  That is still no excuse.  Based on earlier reviews, it seems that this establishment's claim to fame is not good food BUT abysmally negligent and terrible service with a wonderful air of pompous ennui.",1,1,2,Danan R.,"New York, NY",924,1915,85

4.0,2/22/2018,"Ate here at the recommendation of The Pierre Hotel concierge.  It's a local for residents of the UpperEast Side and is small and cozy and clean and modern. Owner is sweet and on top of service. Staff well trained and attention to detail although at one point one of the gentleman used the crumb scraper?? And pushed them right on my pants and boots. I'm not sure how I feel about that. Had a fish special light tomato sauce with olives and carrots, was excellent healthy and light. Had shaved artichoke salad too. Exquisite. My husband had pasta with light cream truffle sauce and we both loved it. This with a bottle of Chianti and scrumptious crusty bread completed our meal. No room for dessert sadly. Less one star for no happy hour drinks at this location so cocktails before dinner limited. Also, outside patio charming but plain and needs something more. No view what so ever from patio so best to sit inside.  Decor is modern white table cloth with lots of orange leather and light wood for wine racks.",2,0,0,Amy Jo A.,"Davie, FL",22,861,1085

2.0,11/19/2016,"To be fair, the food was wonderful.  Otherwise, it would have been a single star.  We sat down and within two minutes, a couple two tables down from us was complaining about a bug in the wine.  They couldn't get a manager to come to the table to rectify the situation.  Fast forward to our meal...we ordered drinks and an appetizer, and the wife's drink had a bug in it as well.  We called for the server and asked for a manager.  No manager on property.  Followed up with a request for someone with a NYC Foodhandler's License.  A woman came to the table, but didn't present the license.  Her response was 'I'm sorry, but it happens'.  So the discussion with my wife was whether to leave and find another place, or stay and diligently examine our food before eating.  We decided to stay, and the food was really good.  The concerns:  a lack of management on property, the lack of a licensed NYC Foodhandler on property, and the unwillingness of the staff to truly fix the problem; hence this review.  I would highly recommend the food here, but the lack of ownership for their mistakes (and appropriate bill adjustments) will eliminate any chance of a return visit.",1,1,0,Joe B.,"Manhattan, NY",1,14,0

3.0,4/17/2016,"Never judge a book by its cover.  Altesi Ristorante on entering the door looks like a winner.  Nice atmosphere, white linens and well dressed staff with a fair number of diners throughout.My wife and I arrived with friends who live in the city and were greeted promptly.  We were offered bread, and our friends requested some olive oil with salt and pepper for the bread.  The oil was brought over in short order, but the salt and pepper well either they didn't understand the words, or just ignored the request.  Salt and pepper was sitting on the next table but they never brought it.  The other couple's wife eventually got up and got it herself.  Not a good start.I ordered Calamari and my wife got the endive salad.  The calamari was OK, but was a bit chewy.  I've had much better at half the price.  The salad came in a dressing bath and after one bite my wife asked for a replacement, which by the way was her original request of dressing on the side.  Knock #2 on the service with and a fair on the appetizers.Two of us got the Sole special, and the other two the Bronzino entree.  The sole was done very nice with a tangy carrot purée along with some perfectly done grilled vegetables.  No complaints here, it was excellent.  My wife and other friend got the Bronzino which they both said was very good and flavorful.  Kudos to the restaurant for taking the head off before serving.While dessert was offered we were too full to take advantage of it.At the price point that the restaurant is at I expect a lot more especially compared to similar venues in the neighborhood.  After opening the cover of this dining establishment I can say with confidence there are a lot more worthy choices.",0,1,0,Todd M.,"Canton, CT",1,63,6
3.0,4/17/2016,"We visited this restaurant on Friday evening with another couple we were visiting in New York.  On first blush we felt like we had walked into an upscale NYC Italian restaurant.  White linens on the tables, separate servers from order takers to water glass fillers etc.  Sadly the service was a huge disappointment.  We sat for several minutes before anyone came to our table.  A gentleman came and filled our water glasses and brought us each a roll.  The roll came with hummus with olive oil.  Our friend requested plain olive oil, salt and pepper.  The olive oil arrived without salt and pepper.  Our server came to take our appetizer order and again salt and pepper were requested.  The appetizers arrived and she again asked for salt and pepper.  After much frustration our friend got up and grabbed salt from another table with no pepper anywhere in sight!  The Calamari appetizer was tough and the batter chewy, not edible in my estimation.  The pear and endive salad was tasty once I sent it back and had it returned with my requested dressing on the side since it was swimming in a tangy citrus dressing.  The Branzino fish was delicious.  Perfectly cooked and nicely seasoned, a winner.  My husband and our friend had the sole special which sat on a tangy carrot puree and was served with mixed grilled vegetables, great meal.  We decided to pass on dessert and waited a very long time to get our bill.  We discovered that the bill was ready and we had to ask for it versus it simply being delivered once she saw we had completed our meal.  With so many great restaurant choices in NYC near Central Park East we'll pass on this restaurant in the future.",1,1,0,Lisa B.,"Canton, CT",136,91,80

The service was top notch, the food to die for, and the ambiance very relaxing. Handmade pasta that melts in your mouth and delicious wines to complement.

1.0,8/12/2015,"Altesi is wanna be 4 star restaurant, with a service of 2 star. We went there for restaurant week and after reaching there we realized that their menu was watered down from their actual menu if you go for 25$ lunch menu (water down means their regular menu pasta with no toppings, etc..). Food was still average and i would have given it 3 star if not for the very poor service. Its a white table cloth restaurant with a service of a diner or even worse. The staff was rude and arrogant, the put us in a very small dingy table and a waiter accidently kicked my chair twice and instead of apoligizing, asked me to sit move my chair a bit. They did not have napkins initially and we had to ask for it. The lady who takes your order was grumpy and rude with absolutely no smile.",1,1,0,Priyank M.,"Manhattan, NY",2,18,0

5.0,3/27/2015,"Went to this lovely Italian restaurant at this location in a townhouse, which New Yorkers may remember as the one-time Euro-club/bar Fredrick's (closed many years ago). This is an elegant, upper-end, but not stuffy, Italian restaurant with an extensive menu including the usual Italian favorites of fresh fish, chicken, veal, steak (as a special), all prepared per the creative menu or as you request. I love when a restaurant invites you to have the your order as YOU want it without making you feel bad for not wanting, say, capers. The manager (owner?) couldn't have been more welcoming and accommodating and the service was top notch.  The tables are sizable and well-spaced apart.  There is a bar up front but it is away from the dining tables and was pretty quiet anyway. There is also a courtyard in the back of the townhouse building which was not open tonight but looks like a lovely setting for an outdoor summer meal. By the way, this block happens to be perhaps the single most exclusive block of townhomes in Manhattan. Versace once lived in the one near the corner of Fifth Avenue and some of the country's wealthiest people have lived on the block. So take a stroll on both sides of the street between Fifth and Madison. The food was exceptional as one would expect but might not always receive at other restaurants.  The bread was particularly good and I was told it was chosen from Sullivan Street Bakery. The tomato purée they provided went perfectly with the bread as a smooth bruschetta-like combination.  The wine selection was excellent and not overpriced.  Desserts included three flavors of creme brûlée, a warm chocolate soufflé and blood orange sorbet, even in early spring. They also had ice cream, tiramisu and cookies.This is a romantic spot good for a date or special occasion, without feeling overly precious. Good for a business dinner too. On this Friday evening some were in jackets others just a sport shirt and nobody seemed impressed or bothered by either. Overall I was delighted to discover a neighborhood Italian on the Upper East side where I can go frequently and enjoy great food with excellent service and enough variety to not get tired of the same old thing.  Examine the menu online to make sure it is in your price range. If so, you won't be disappointed by the experience at this somewhat hidden gem.  (Lastly, the rest rooms were modern, clean and nice--hate when that is not the case)",2,1,0,Drew C.,"Manhattan, NY",1,27,7

1.0,9/19/2014,"I will preface this review by stating that my philosophy is that if I can't say anything good, say nothing at all.  But my first experience at this restaurant tonight was so distasteful on so many levels, that I am compelled to share it so that others don't suffer the same fate.  Altesi opened 4 months ago (around May, 2014) as an extremely upscale, expensive spot on the upper east side. We were six people, all local to the restaurant, all anxious to try the new ""in"" place. We were seated and shown the menu which seemed relatively expensive, but not unusual for Manhattan.  One appetizer, prosciutto and melon, came with the ingredients so thinly shaved that they were practically transparent and barely there ($21).  The Mista salad was a pile of dried lettuce leaves ($14), and The Buffalo Mozzarela and tomatoes consisted of a tablespoon of mozzarella and 3 shaved slices of tomatoes ($19).  For entrees, I ordered the veal cutlet Milanese which was no more than a scaloppini size piece of veal with the same sad salad on the side ($38).  Suffice it to say that the remainder of the entrees were equally unremarkable. The coup the grace was dessert:: none of them came together and after 10 minutes of waiting we called the owner over who explained that they were very busy.  Gelato was 2 small scoops in a JUICE  GLASS, no garnish, no chocolate drizzle, no biscotti... NADA.  The cappuccino was so weak it looked like tea.  The service was curt and disruptive, with the waiters reaching across the table and over our heads to serve and remove dishes.  When we complained to the owner he gave us a shrug.  You get nothing for a lot of $$$ and we couldn't wait to get out of there and will NEVER GO BACK!",7,1,0,Randi K.,"New York, NY",6,14,0
