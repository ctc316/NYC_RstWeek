3.0,3/31/2019,"Tarallucci E Vino is a great spot to have a early morning, low-key brunch. I enjoyed the eggs and polenta dish (polenta squares topped with poached eggs, mushrooms and parm), while my friend enjoyed her salmon and egg dish (salmon, kale, and poached eggs on toast).  The toast with butter and jam was also scrumptious.  We didn't try them, but the pastries looked excellent.  Sadly for me, they don't serve cold brew - and iced coffee is just not the same.",0,0,1,Jennifer S.,"New York, NY",16,692,0

I was in NYC for a work conference and my husband and I were exploring the nieghborhood when we found Tarallucci E Vino. As a birthday treat, my husband suggested that we eat here.The atmosphere is quiet with sensual yet relaxing music in the background. There is a U-shaped bar in the middle with small sit down tables surrounding it. The staff was subdued yet warm and friendly. The dim lights created a romantic feel for our dinner.I am currently pregnant so kept to water for my drink, but my husband ordered the Pink Pepper Italian Beer. He really enjoyed the flavor!! the wine list is extensive, which is really nice!To start we ordered the meatballs. They were perfectly cooked and served with plenty of marinara sauce. Perfect for dips your bread in. The order came with approximately four meatballs. We split an order of the lasagna, which was the perfect size for us to share. If you are hungry, this  better suited for one person. Overall, we had a wonderful time and I would high suggest stopping by!",0,0,0,Vanessa C.,"Atlanta, GA",116,102,58

5.0,1/28/2019,"This restaurant/wine bar is very low-key yet elegant and impeccably clean. The music selection is often sensual and relaxing. I always come here to meditate over a bowl of fresh pasta after my monthly facial at Savor Spa, which is right across the street. I dated an Italian (Torinese) for three years, and trust me, this is as authentic as it gets in Manhattan!  I am not sure if they make the spaghetti from scratch, but every time I finish my bowl I want to cry (and am one glass of wine away from ordering another bowl).

For happy hour 5-7 pm, you can order oysters for $1.50 each and spritzers and wines for $9 and below. We ordered 2 dozen oysters and they were deliciously fresh! Went really well with the white house wine.For main, my dad ordered the risotto and I ordered the spaghetti. I love ordering spaghetti at Italian restaurants as I find it the purest Italian dish to judge how well the food is prepared. It was scrumptious; had that bouncy quality that only homemade spaghetti can have. The risotto was rich and delicious too- came with butternut squash and sausage mixed within the creamy sauce.For dessert, we split the tiramisu (as we always do when eating Italian.) So gooood!

2.0,6/30/2018,"My girlfriend and I stopped by on a nice Friday summer evening and sat outside.  From the beginning, it was obvious that the waitstaff was aloof and seemingly untrained.  Our actual waitress didn't seem to care about our existence.  When our plates came, we both were surprised by the tiny portion sizes.  My girlfriend had the Octopus Gnocchi.  At $24, she expected more than a tiny plate of pasta.  I had the scallops which was worse - for $32 I was served four small scallops and five short stems of asparagus.  To be fair, everything was delicious.Tarallucci needs to train their staff better to warrant their high prices and small portion sizes.  At the end of our meal, our waitress brought us the dessert menus.  She then brought us the check without asking if we wanted dessert.We promptly settled our bill and picked up a sushi roll down the street since we both were still hungry.I will not be back to Tarallucci.",0,0,0,Jamie K.,"New York, NY",0,25,0
4.0,6/15/2018,"I had the chance to try this popular restaurants location in the Upper West Side on a breezy Thursday morning. I've been to their spot in NoMad for dinner, so I was curious to see what they'd be cooking up on their breakfast menu. Needless to say, it was just as good as my dinner experience! It definitely should be an option for anyone looking for a quaint & relaxing breakfast experience in the neighborhood.We arrived to the restaurant around 10 AM on a Thursday morning. We hadn't made a reservation, but it didn't seem like we needed to. There were a lot of table options both inside and outside at this time and they allowed us to pick where we wanted to sit.The space itself is really great! They have tables outside in a sectioned off area on their front sidewalk, as well as indoor seating. On this particularly nice day they had opened the windows which allowed a cool breeze to flow throughout the space. So nice!When it came time to order I went with the Ouva Al Tartufo ($15). Think of is as a well dressed breakfast sandwich with the addition of Truffle Aioli. So freaking good. I came in hungry and this definitely hit the spot. It also comes with a side of home fries, which honestly are just potato bits...The service here was great! The staff was attentive and gave us ample time to look over the menu. They were quick to fill our water glasses and happy to answer any questions we had about the menu.This restaurant is a great option for a low key breakfast in the UWS.

5.0,4/21/2018,"My bf and I were in the UWS looking for apartments, and decided that I wouldn't make it back to the east village alive without eating something first. This place looked good (read: had pasta) so we popped in for impromptu dinner and wine I a Wednesday evening. We were seated immediately by the window where I proceeded to spy on all the dogs walking by. I ordered the spaghetti and Pinot Grigio and the bear had the duck ragu dish and a Cabernet while sharing the broccolini side dish. The portions were perfect, the spaghetti was delicious in the way where the tomato sauce was not even remotely acidic but perfectly balanced between sweet and tangy. My bf didn't speak at all during the meal which I took to mean he enjoyed himself immensely. The broccolini was lightly and simply cooked so that it was crunchy and a great foil to the rich pasta. Between the food and the delicious wine, we were totally blissed out and wanted to move to the neighbourhood just to be closer to this spot. The environment was relaxed, cute and natural.

5.0,7/12/2017,"I have been going to Tarallucchi since it first opened on 18th street 16 years ago. It now covers a lot of ground in the city (literally) with 5 restaurants . On my way to an event at the Naumburg Bandshell last night was an excellent opportunity to stop at the UWS location for salumi e formaggi, which was amazing as usual. The outdoor seating here is more plentiful and better, but my regular haunt on 18th street has a far more inviting dining room. The menus are identical as far as can tell, except the additional lunch and dinner prefix at the Union Square location. The waiters at both places are super knowledgeable about the food and the wine list, which of course is 100% Italian and worth exploring. Our waiter was really nice and got us several wine samples.

The caprese and burrata salad was excellent. The bread selection was good, but a little hard (with no butter). Our waiter was friendly and efficient.

Morning service has been friendly, but on the other occasions, dismissive or disinterested comes to mind.Today, I ordered a pasta and waited about 25 minutes before interrupting the staff meeting taking place next to me at the bar. Not a real meeting, just servers and a possible manager having private conversation, seemingly unaware of my presence. When I finally asked about my order (no one asked me) the server asked the manager how long Gnocchi takes, he looked at me and said 10 minutes. When I said I had been there 25, he just turned and went back to his conversation with the other server.My order was never put in, my server had disappeared and the one left startedto put my order in, when I said 'No, thanks.' and walked out.

I eat carpaccio at other restaurants all the time, and almost always, I am satisfied. I never felt discusted by this dish before. So congratulations to the chef, you have made me experience a ""first""!After the terrible starter, I had the spaghetti with tomato and basil. And it was the worst spaghetti I have ever eaten in my life! There was no salt, like zero salt, and the spaghetti was basically ""swimming"" in excess tomato sauce!!! I don't understand why anyone would put so much tomato sauce, you don't have to be a master chef to see that it was too much, you can basically see that it was too much just by looking at it! But apparently, this chef doesn't really give a damn about it, so he/she just accepted to serve this ridiculous dish.It was so terrible, I couldn't even finish it, and I left the restaurant hungry.I strongly discourage you from coming here for food.

Everything as super fresh, service was friendly and very European (no rushing, ask for the check, etc.). Also, the space is clean  and cozy at the same time - clean lines, little shelves lined with small plants.The bread basket has three types of bread - rosemary focaccia, whole wheat and baguette, and is served with a small pot of oil and olive paste. Delish!Our brunch consisted of the Asparagi and poached eggs with pink peppercorn over potatoes. Amazing tasting, very filling, lovely flavors. The asparagus was cooked just right - still crisp but not stiff. The other dish was the soup and half panini. I'd never heard of Beet Soup but decided it was interesting enough to try. It was so delicious - it had the sweetness of beet but also tasted like fall due to a spicy edge and earthiness to it. I couldn't believe it was vegan! The half pannini was chicken, greens, and the olive pate. It was great, though the chicken was a little on the dry side. The sandwich seemed more like a whole versus a ""half."" Totally stuffed after.The OJ here is fresh squeezed and tastes like the very essence of an orange.$30 for two, no booze, tax included = a great deal.

But this actually worked out because I was able to have both breakfasted and pastries.We ordered a sugar donut, a cinnamon role, and cornetti.

So if you don't really like that flavor I would recommended this place. For breakfast we ordered french toast and vegetable frittata. Again the french toast had a zingy taste that some people don't like, but I don't really mind it. I though it was really good.

The flavors balanced nicely, the rosemary was not overpowering which it sometimes can be. It was a good sized sandwich for lunch. The bread was delicious, however it was alittle too crunchy for my taste - like cut the inside of your mouth crunchy Who knows, maybe I just have a weirdly sensitive mouth?

I ordered the butternut squash risotto, and I wish I hadn't. It came out a few minutes after I ordered it so I should have guessed, at literally the same time when I got the bread. The risotto was bland, and had 4 slices of the cheese placed on top of it. I attempted to stir it into the risotto thinking that it would melt, but no such luck.

2.0,4/11/2013,"Sorry to say, but this place was somewhat disappointing for two reasons:1) The wine -  Unsure of what to drink, our waiter very graciously let us sample a couple, neither of which did we like.  No big deal, we decided to pony up for an $18/glass barolo which we are certain to like.  I'm not sure how any Sommelier could have put this wine on their menu, let alone charge $18 for it -- it was so dull and underwhelming, it may as well have been a pinot noir (no offense to pinot noir).  Also, I don't know what the pricing formula is for charging by-the-glass, but after researching the wine on the internet, it seemed disproportionate.2) The food - I won't go as far to say it was bad, but there was really nothing special about it.  We ordered the spinach salad with raspberry dressing - the only thing raspberry about it was the garnish and it was so heavily salted that it was crunching in my teeth.  I'll give them the benefit of the doubt, that it could be a one-off issue, I've done that myself.  We also ordered mozarella di bufala that I was assured was very fresh but it was definitely some store-bought mozarella -- which is fine, I just found it to be disparate with an $18 Barolo.  I will credit them that the roasted veggies that came with it were very good.  This is kind of a small sample to judge the entire menu but we decided not to order anything else after being underwhelmed with our first two choices.  Yelp equates 2 stars with ""meh"" and that pretty much hit the nail on the head.",0,0,0,Lea L.,"New York, NY",0,2,0

I understand giving your clientele the time and space they would want to enjoy a leisurely meal but that does not mean you chat with the other servers and not pay attention to your tables as they try to flag you down. That being said, the food was delicious. We had glasses of the pinot, the risotto, and the insalata. The red was deep and round, while the risotto was a bit stiffer than is preferred but a lovely pumpkin infused dish nevertheless. The insalata was lightly dressed and a good portion.

4.0,4/19/2011,"This part of Columbus has seen some hard times.  Places opening and closing -- makes you feel like a restaurant war survivor, ignoring all the new recruits to avoid making friends with the doomed.   I was pretty sure I would ignore this place too, because it looked Upper East Sidey and snooty.  Like that place next door with the $20 ravioli.  Besides being new to the neighborhood, this one also has the gall to make it impossible to spell or remember their name.  ""That new wine bar, Tombe Douche E Vino?""  Plus, I prefer wine at home, and small plate craptacular establishments confuse and frighten my wallet.  I doubt I'll ever come here for dinner.  Strike three?Well, my girlfriend and I were in the mood for a new brunch place, and after looking at the menu, took a chance.  This stuff is delicious.  I give it four stars instead of five because we've only been there once for brunch (as I said, the Vino part might as well not exist for me), but my experience was worth mentioning.  The coffee/espresso drinks are great, as they should be at a Nouveau Italienne place, and the people eating pastries looked happy, as happy as the pastries looked delicious.  No problems at all with service (in fact they were very accommodating to our worried ""soft poached please for the love of god soft poached"" order). Poached eggs w/ porchetta and polenta:  the polenta was a creamy lake around an island of perfectly runny poached eggs and flavorful thinly sliced porchetta.  A masterpiece of rich, flavorful simplicity.The brioche french toast was a lovely sweet variation on the classic stuffed french toast brunch, and the light cheese stuffing in this case added good balance and a je ne sais quoi taste, a plus over the usual cream cheese.  Most restaurants in this neighborhood have $10 or so brunch dishes (not naming certain more expensive if still tasty brunch places on Amsterdam, and definitely naming the way-overhyped Good Enough to Eat), and this one beats them the same way Kefi does for dinner: with a higher quality-to-price ratio.  All that said, I can't add anything about the dinner and wine scene here.  DO remember Tagliamoochi next time you and your date don't feel like standing in line outside a crowded brunch restaurant.  If you live around here, wake up fifteen minutes earlier on a weekday and try it for a breakfast pastry and cappuccino (or just the pastry and coffee from Joe's).  That's my plan, anyway.",0,1,0,Michael T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,41,2
1.0,4/18/2011,"I have no idea why this place is so busy!  I went with a friend after work before heading to a show.  They let us taste a couple of wines before ordering so that went and they were very polite about that.  The wine we ordered was 18 a glass, but it was the only one I could actually drink.No one explained that these were small plates.  I ordered the leg of lamb only to find out that it was more of a ragu, and there wasn't much of it.  Certainly not enough for a meal and not worth the +20 I paid for it.  Really, over 20 dollars for a small plate of stringy lamb?   My friend had something with mushrooms, also a small plate much better in flavor...I can remember if it was a risotto or a ravioli.  Oh yeah, the food wasn't memorable.Anyway, still hungry we ordered 3 cheeses for $14.  When the order came no one bothered to tell us which was which, so we had to ask, not cool.  The cheese, while good, wasn't served with much.  At Wine and Roses you get more things with the cheese such as fruit.  This was pretty bare bones.The bill came to $154 before tip.  Mostly because of the wine, but still, We could have had a lovely dinner at any number of resturants on the UWS for that, and it would have been more enjoyable.  Will stick to Wine and Roses for the foreseeable future.",1,0,0,Heather H.,"New York, NY",8,48,5
4.0,4/15/2011,"Wine list is good, bartenders are knowledgeable.This place is actually a coffee, pastry, espresso shop by day and wine and cheese bar by night.  Ambiance is simple and modernThis is a good quiet spot to grab an afternoon coffee or glass of wine.",0,0,0,Courtney G.,"New York, NY",97,82,0
4.0,3/22/2011,"So glad I came back here in the evening to try out the wine list, remarkable! The list is of course very italian focused and not the usual names that you hear. We relied heavily on the bartender to give us recommendations and all of the picks were spot on. One of the wines was soo good that we spent all of the next day trying to find a place that sells it (Eataly)! Service here is top notch and very friendly. Although there are a few over the top selections, price is very fair. This is the best wine bar I have been to on the UWS thus far.It is a small space but it fits a good number of people. My only complaint about the space was that we got stuck in the back left corner at the bar, in between the restroom and in front of the coffee machine. Avoid this spot if you can. Will need to try the food for visit number three.",0,0,0,Nora Y.,"Manhattan, NY",14,66,0
2.0,3/16/2011,"I ordered the Mushroom Gnocchi and it was nothing short of awful - the gnocchi was poorly cooked, I'm fairly confident that the mushrooms were canned, and the cheap parmesan cheese didn't help the cause.  I flagged down the waitress and asked if I could change my order to the PLT (pancetta, lettuce, and tomato). She took away the gnocchi and quickly brought out the sandwich. I was a big fan of the idea behind the PLT, but it lacked flavor and there was only a small slice of pancetta between multiple tomatoes and lettuce leafs. The worst part is that they actually charged me for the gnocchi...what?! I was extremely offended by this considering they had only been open for a couple of weeks.Okay, now that that is out of the way.....lets talk gelato! Delicious!!!! My only complaint is that the website leads you to believe that there are over a dozen flavors, but fails to mention that they rotate flavors and only carry 3 at a time. We ordered the Mint Chocolate Chip but they were out of it so we opted for the Hazelnut. Bottom line: Skip the entrees, but if you are brunching on the UWS and find yourself with a post-Bloody Mary sweet tooth stop by for an espresso and gelato.",0,0,0,Brittany H.,"New York, NY",52,14,1
4.0,3/2/2011,"Stopped in for brunch and found it was a really solid place for the UWS. Light and airy space although a little on the small side (it's more of a cafe setup then a restaurant). They have a full menu and lots of vegetarian options. Coffee was delicious (bonussss points) even if they don't do free refills. Pastries were ridiculously good and baked on-site (more points!) Plates were smaller but the food was delicious and filling. Our one complaint? As more people started coming in the waiters started to panic and rush around. I mean, yes, we did laugh to see them flutter about, but it was really bizarre they couldn't maintain composure when more people walked in. ""Sacrebleu! They are storming the cafe gates!"" Next time maybe less caffeine for the waitstaff, yes?",1,3,0,Sarit W.,"New York, NY",25,52,7
3.0,2/28/2011,"small venue, cramped as all get up.  lots of small places and even more wine selection.  dark and loud with an interesting music selection.  some of the plates were DELICIOUS.  some of them were... not so much.  beef carpaccio? stay away.  the raw scallops? not worth it.  the roasted veggie with mozzarella dish? GET IT. we got about 6 plates with a bottle of wine for three people and the result was that we were about $150 short at the end of the night.  the doors open into the walls and in the summer i could totally see this place hopping. i'd come back for ONE glass with a few plates and then go get dinner elsewhere!",0,0,0,kathleen c.,"New York, NY",263,403,2
3.0,2/26/2011,"There is a surprisingly extensive brunch menu here, with a lot of poorly organized but thoroughly tempting dishes... panini, salads, pasta, frittatas, cheese (the restaurant is a wine bar at night), etc.  I got the mozzarella/tomato/basil panini, which came with a side salad and really filled me up.  It was melted perfectly.  My friend and I shared mint chocolate chip gelato for dessert... wonderful way to round out the meal!The main downfall for me?  No free refills on the coffee or iced tea.  However, I really appreciated that our waitress told me before serving it up and ringing it up.I would like to come here to explore it's wine bariness at some point as well... the wine list looked good!",0,0,0,Kirsten S.,"New York, NY",132,335,1
3.0,1/26/2011,"Tarallucci e Vino just opened up this restaurant and replaced the old Subway sandwich shop which I hear a lot of residents thought detracted from the neighborhood.I went with a couple of friends.  We started with some wine and some of the cheese and charcuterie.  We ordered 5 cheeses - you can order 1,2 or 5 on a plate, and a couple of meats.  They were nice but nothing blew me away. The duo of mortadella had fried meat pops (that's the only way I can describe it).  My friend joked that it tasted like fried spam on a stick.The waitress then showed us the menus again and mentioned the risotto entree which was confusing because the menu looked to be more tapas style.I asked her and she said the menu was in fact tapas style.  We asked for suggestions.  She recommended the risotto special made with red wine and pumpkin with an aged cheese on top.  She also recommended the polenta with duck sauce.  She said the duck sauce was their specialty and that it was the same as in their other locations.  Another dish we were going to order was out so we left it with these two.First the polenta.  The duck sauce was really nice.  the duck was tender and hot but unfortunately the polenta was unseasoned, thin and cold.  It lacked in taste and texture.Next was the risotto. Where do I begin.... the risotto was overworked and stiff.  Too stiff for a proper risotto.  It also came out in 2 minute which means it was sitting there on the stove and they didn't even take time to loosen it with some broth.  Had hey done that, it would have been hot  but it was served warm on a cold plate.  The cheese was also melted on top and not even incorporated into the risotto.  it was like a big slice of cheese that you had to cut with the spoon as you tried to serve the risotto.My friend had a white chocolate mouse that was more like a pudding with a lot of fruit on it.  I had a hot chocolate which was thick, rich and chocolaty but also just warm and not ""hot"".I always joke that there's 2 things many people want to try but don't know how it is supposed to be made - those are Risotto and gnocchi.  I think I'll now add polenta to that list.This restaurant is new and I think needs some time to get the kinks sorted out.  it may be worth another try in a month or two.",2,0,0,Fletcher C.,"NY, NY",8,41,0
