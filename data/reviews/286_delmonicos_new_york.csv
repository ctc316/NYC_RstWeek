4.0,4/24/2019,"Coming to New York you have to try a steakhouse like Delmonico's. The atmosphere is very catered towards business, upscaled atmosphere, which makes sense seeing that it's in the financial district. We ordered the 60 day marinated New York steak strip and the lamb ribs. The steak was absolutely amazing, it was cooked to perfection and the natural juices of the steak was so delicious that other sides or sauces were unnecessary. The staff came by frequently to refill our water and to change  our dishes, however I felt like there was a lack of friendliness.. overall, I enjoyed the food here. I would recommend it for anyone to come visit",0,0,0,Anabelle L.,"West Covina, CA",29,102,128
4.0,4/23/2019,"We came here for dinner on a Friday night for my husband's birthday. While the art work is beautiful, I felt like it was a bit stuffy.  I did like the history about the building. The oysters were fresh and delicious. The steak was good, but not great.  I felt the side dishes were just eh, nothing exciting. Our waiter was okay,  it super friendly and seemed annoyed with the six of us at certain times. Plenty of other steakhouses to go to in NYC.",0,0,0,Beth P.,"Bergen County, NJ",5,195,167
5.0,4/19/2019,"Yes,  this a place to have your NY strip steak! We had a big party of 10 ppl and the service totally made our dinner perfect. While everybody were gathering, we were waiting on the bar area, bartenders were really good, very fast and tasty cocktail! Once we were sat, the waiter worked very fast and efficient. He was at the table when we were in need of him without us asking. The service is top notch. All appetizers came out fast and tasty: foie gras was cooked to perfection and seafood was fresh! For the main course I got NY strip steak medium rare - 1000% recommend, such a tender piece!

My husband and I were on our honeymoon and it was our first time in New York. Had to come to this historical beauty. The food itself was ""heavenly"", as my husband put it, and David definitely made the whole experience that much better.

2.0,3/17/2019,"My law firm had a business meeting here. The atmosphere was elegant and the wine selection was excellent. Unfortunately the special was not. Most of my coworkers ordered a steak. However I and another attorney ordered the veal chop stuffed with lobster and wrapped in prosciutto. First it was  not a veal chop. Second the presentation was less than desirable. My coworker's came out drowning in sauce (almost a soup) and mine had barely any dressing the plate but the veal was drenched in it. The ""chop"" was cut in half (I'm assuming so they could stuff it easily). The sauce was over powering to the point you could not taste anything else. The veal looked more like a baked potato; not that you could tell or taste given the dressing. The worst, however, was how fatty the meat was. I've had  veal saltimbocca (a veal shank) with less fat than this veal ""chop"". Extremely disappointed to the point I could not eat it. $40 per plate and neither of us could eat it. I gave the restaurant 2 stars given the fact that the other attorneys who ordered steak enjoyed their dinner else I would have given it less.",0,0,0,Gerardino P.,"Sparta Township, NJ",26,2,0
5.0,3/14/2019,"In NYC for a few days on break with my girlfriend and decided to reserve a table for a nice Monday night supper.  Upon entering the restaurant between the columns, I was warmly greeted and immediately directed to the coat check.  The ambiance was that of a classic New York steakhouse and definitely was what you would expect from America's first restaurant.  It just felt like you were in a historically significant place.  I ordered the 45 day dry aged Ribeye and she ordered the Delmonico.  We also split a side of brussel sprouts.  The steaks were right up there with the best steaks I've ever had.  I will say, though, that I was expecting a more kind of funky, gamey taste with my ribeye, being that it was dry aged for so long.  This really wasn't the case, but nonetheless it was still a really great Ribeye.  I was also very impressed with the super juicy (wet aged) Delmonico and after trying it, would probably order it if I get the chance to come back.  The only issue I had with the entire meal was the bread that was served.  The little biscuits were pretty dry and really did nothing to enhance the meal.  Overall, though, Delmonico's was a real treat and a meal that I will not soon forget.  The quality of the food coupled with the historic nature of the restaurant make for a special experience.",0,0,0,Mitchell B.,"Mount Airy, NC",0,1,1

5.0,2/19/2019,"Have eaten many times, but this is my first review.Dinner was absolutely amazing. We were a party of four. We started with a seafood platter. It had clams, oysters, crab and lobster. Everything was cold and fresh. It was delicious.For main courses, one Delmonico's ribeye, one bone in ribeye and two orders of the Muscovy Duck. Sides were mashed potatoes, mixed vegetables and creamed spinach. The steaks were cooked to perfection; one medium rare and one black and blue. The creamed spinach was the best that I ever had at a steakhouse and the duck was sublime.

I am celiac, dairy free and pescatarian, so I'm a little bit of a pain.. but the waiter checked with the chef to see what he could make me that I would like and said he would use all separate clean pans. He made me salmon, which isn't on the menu, asparagus and roasted potatoes. Drinks were perfect as well, they definitely don't slack on the amount of alcohol in them.

4.0,2/15/2019,I came here in multiple occasions and other locations even the one in Las Vegas. My experience last time I went was not that great. We send back our steak twice. Twice ? Cmon.. that ruins our whole meal. We kept eating the side dishes and bread since they took very long and by the time the steak arrived we were not longer hungry and unhappy.

4.0,2/14/2019,"We decided to dine at historic Delmonico's for our annual Valentine's Day tradition... always the Saturday preceding or following the day Hallmark, Russell Stovers, and whomever makes those idiotic bears decided to commercialize our lives with frivolity.The architecture and atmosphere at Delmonico's is exactly what one would expect - a lot of character, dark wood, dim lighting, (old?) dudes, and drab paintings the size of a small dinosaur.We arrived fifteen minutes early for our 7 pm reservation and were seated immediately by our warm and smiling hostesses.  Shortly thereafter, we were greeted by an old school no-nonsense waiter and handed a tablet computer that served as their drinks menu (kind of odd, but whatever I guess).With vodka martini in hand and a bottle of red wine by our side, we ordered a dozen oysters (one order of east cost, one order of west coast).  These are absolutely delicious and are served alongside a medley of sauces and toppings.  The east coast oysters were meatier... the west, more sweet and flavorful.For mains, we went with the signature Delmonico Steak (the boneless Ribeye) and the Prime New York Strip.  Both served medium-rare.  The steaks were cooked to perfection and tasted absolutely divine.  For sides, we selected the House Cut French Fries and Roasted Brussels Sprouts.  Those French Fries were yum, but those Sprouts required some extra flavor and caramelization!We did have one unpleasant encounter at the bar upon leaving for the evening.  We wanted to tip the woman working coat check and asked the bartender to break a $20 bill.  He refused.  That's completely unacceptable, especially after spending good money on dinner!  Shame!  I complained to the hostess.  I don't think she really cared.  Oh well, we didn't let it spoil our fun!",2,2,0,Matt M.,"Manhattan, NY",35,79,200
3.0,2/13/2019,"street parking it was pretty easy to find parking after 9pmthis is an upscale steak house, they have a bar room area where there are also booths, the bar room is more casual for after work gatherings and light meals. the main room is the upscale area.  BTW, This is the oldest restaurant in the united states!!!Service is really l bad at first. The waiter had to be called for us to have a chance to order drinks..... after waiting 35 minutes for him to come on his own. Also he wanted us to order the meal all together, he was rushing through all the orders... I was not even done and he was walking away. It's almost like they treat you different during restaurant week. That is the worst thing you can do as the week is to lore people to come back and tone so far NOT GOOD. We also got to see waiters correcting the bussers in the middle of the floor, to me in this class of venue you do not call attention of other employees in front of the customers it is extremely unprofessional.after a while I think the waiter checked himself and got a little better and more polite.The restaurant week is a sham here, they uncharge a lot of the stuff on the restaurant week menu. What a disappointment, steakhouse, they clearly did not want to participate on the event in good spirit, it was very difficult to experience the place with good food as most of the iconic items were up-charged.APEROL- love this aperitif drink the serving here is pretty great.They do give out complementary bread for the table with plenty of butter for all in the table, so no fighting over one little plate of sugar. LOBSTER BISQUE- what an amazing soup, it has a hint of coconut cream I wanna say, but also resembles curry, idk what it was but it was pretty amazing, on the down side, there isn't that much actual lobster in it. SIRLOIN- came with a side of cauliflower and mash potatoes, it was pretty great. The stake came cooked as I asked the sides were also amazing tasting CRAB MAC AND CHEESE- amazed with the mac and cheese, the right amount of salt and the pasta was cooked perfectly, I never thought I would say this but the cheese crust was a bit too much but the sauce and the spices omg they know how to use seasoning here.Baked Alaska - they charged extra!!! But! Worth it!!!The banana flavor, the ice cream and the merengue omg!!! I am in love, this is definitely a MUST have in this placein the end we were happy, the food was good and the service got better. I did wish that we got a better beginning when we came in, only later we had a nice employee telling us the history of the place. they need to work a bit on the angle that this place has a lot of story and people want to know. it would have made my experience a lot more meaningful.",1,2,2,Erica F.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",634,586,4481

5.0,2/10/2019,"I'm giving this a 5 star rating if you come here because: 1) you're a tourist and you want to try an iconic NY steakhouse or 2) you have a corporate card. Otherwise, I would not recommend coming here. But if you're one of the two above, Delmonico's is pretty good. I ordered the tuna tartar app (which was small for $29, but really fresh fish and really good balance of flavors, especially love the thinly sliced pickled lotus root that adds a nice crunch!). For my entree, I ordered the dover sole. SO GOOD. THAT DOVER SOLE is one of the best I've ever had. The fish was perfectly cooked, not over, not under, just perfect and it makes a HUGE difference because I've been to a French restaurant that overcooked it and it became just a plain white fish dressed in lemon butter. The fish is so delicate and Delmonico's knows how to cook it. So if you've ever wanted to try Dover Sole that rivals with the best of the French restaurants in NYC, you can safely do it here. Overall, the meal was delicious and the service was attentive. I probably won't come again as I'm not a tourist and NYC has so many other restaurants to try that aren't costing you an arm and a leg. But great if you do come for one of the two above reasons :)",0,0,0,Stephanie H.,"New York, NY",142,342,798
4.0,2/9/2019,Had a business dinner here and was not disappointed. My client enjoyed his steak and escargot. I had the Delmonico steak and it was perfectly charred and seasoned. Paired all with an excellent Malbec. It's definitely old world charm at Delmonico's. It did tend to get loud as the night went on and as more people showed up for dinner - to the point that my party had problems hearing each other in conversation. Other than that we had an excellent time and the ferry back to NJ was just a couple blocks away!,0,0,0,Cruz D.,"Jersey City, NJ",2,50,121
4.0,2/9/2019,"Enjoyed a late lunch at Delmonico's while visiting New York. Had the American Wagyu Tartare, Delmonico Steak, King Crab Macaroni & Cheese, and the Classic Baked Alaska.QualityI walked into Delmonico's ravenous and so I ended up overdoing it. Even so, I am glad I got to try each of the dishes I did, sans the Classic Baked Alaska. My meal started with the delicious American Wagyu Tartare. Fresh and savory the meat was absolutely on point. It was served with a smoked onion crema, potato chips, and quail egg. A rich and decadent dish and one I would gladly order again. The Delmonico Steak was next out and it was tremendous. A boneless ribeye, the steak was extremely tender and cooked to perfection. I loved how the fat in the cut would just melt in your mouth. A steak worthy of sharing a name with the restaurant. The King Crab Macaroni & Cheese was solid as well. Huge chunks of crab made up some for a less than stellar cheese sauce. It was at this point I should have ended my meal, but in seeing the beautiful Classic Baked Alaska make its way past my table, I decided to go for it. All I can say is the banana gelato ruins it. It is so heavy and just completely overwhelms the dish. Very few things should ever use banana, and when they do it needs to be subtle, that was not the case here.QuantityI ordered far too much, but still managed to eat nearly everything. I believe I could have easily split my meal with someone else and have been just as happy with the results. The steaks are large enough to share and the sides are made for two.ValueIt is certainly expensive, but not outrageously so. Most of the steaks are in the $50 range and I was impressed with the size of the Delmonico Steak for the price. Walking into the restaurant you should immediately know this is going to cost a bit more than a standard steakhouse.AmbianceDelmonico's is located in the Financial District of Manhattan. A restaurant steeped in history as it was America's first fine dining restaurant, and its chefs developed dishes such as Eggs Benedict, Lobster Newburg, and Baked Alaska. As soon as you see the front entrance, you know you will be in for a treat. The restaurant is large and spacious, something you don't expect from a New York City restaurant. High ceilings with vintage chandeliers define the space. The molding is incredible as are the unique pieces of art that decorate the wall. It is a bright space and one with every table is perfectly arranged and set. I sat in the main dining room, but they also had a bar area downstairs as well as an additional room for private parties. A perfect mix of pop traditional music played during my meal. It is easy to see why this place has been able to stand the test of time.CrowdI came at an odd time, so the restaurant was relatively empty. I imagine if I was there a little later for dinner it would be packed. Its location near Wall Street also probably makes it a popular spot for a power lunch. I will say guests were more dressed down than I expected during the day, but I assume that changes in the evening.ServiceThe service was top of the line. From the moment I walked in, it was immediately clear that the customer experience is the most important element of the meal. I was greeted kindly by the hostess who then handed me off to my waiter. They like to use names, which is an appreciated touch. The pace of the food was perfect and the restaurant was pristine.ParkingI did not have a car and I was glad not to. It seemed like a very difficult area to find parking. I assume with enough circling you eventually either find a spot or give up and pay the high prices for a garage.ExtraDelmonico's was a great experience. The lovely restaurant has so much history and it was incredible to dine there. The service was exquisite and the food very good.

2.0,2/7/2019,"It literally breaks may heart to write this review and I have contemplated doing it for several days! I saw Delmonico's on the travel channel over 15 years ago and I have wanted to go there ever since. So when we booked our trip to NYC I made our reservations for Delmonico's. It happened to be restaurant week so it worked out well. For starters we were seated in the cellar which definitely made you feel like a second class citizen. Our waiter was great so this review does by no means reflect him or any of the wait staff. We ordered our appetizers which was lobster bisque and heritage pig Bolognese. My husband said the bisque was pretty good. My bolognese was Luke warm and just ok. While we were eating our appetizers we saw something drop from the ceiling which happened to be a cockroach. We waived down the waiter and he took away the bottle of wine that the roach was tap dancing on. The roach then fell on the floor and was smashed. This was the point of no return for me and honestly we should have just left. Our food came out it was cold and the manager came by to apologize. He took the charge of the upgraded desert off and paid for our drinks. Which included one glass of wine and a whiskey. Our upgraded desert was baked Alaska which is truly a beautiful dish that tastes kinda gross. The other deserts were good and the steak was tender but when you are watching the ceiling for more dripping cockabugs it kind of ruins the well over 100.00 meal for two. The manager kindly explained to me that it was NYC and buildings are old so bugs happen but, being a Floridian I am well aware of cockroaches and I know that they maybe in restaurants but they should NEVER be seen by the diners!

Staffs are very professional and courteous.Food is very good, tried the beet and pear with burrata cheese (it seemed it was house made). The cheese was amazing, very soft inside and round shaped outside, delicate light and so creamy. I'll definitely go back just for the cheese. Tried the miso bass, which was very good. Bass was with skin on and seared, very tender, topped with veggies, sitting on two sauces. Also, tried the bolgonese appetizer which was aldente and yummy, the short rib was also tender and amazing.

3.0,1/31/2019,"Delmonico's has a bar & grill seating area and their main dining room and this review is for the bar & grill, which is a little less fancier and price is more affordable. The main reason for the 3-star review is that the food quality is not consistent here. Most of their sandwiches are pretty good. I especially recommend the classic burger. The meat is fresh and cooked right. The short ribs also got pretty good feedbacks. However, their other dishes are always too salty.. When I had the Amish brick chicken, it tasted like salt was free and I was eating salt instead of chicken. This time around my friend ordered the shrimp and chorizo hash and her comment was it had too much salt as well. The one thing I would always go back for at Delmonico's is their dessert. Baked Alaska is always the table's favorite. It's not too sweet. My friend also thought very highly of their coconut creme brûlée.

The quality of food was inconsistent and varies by tables and customers!I had the 45 days dry aged steak and I had asked for medium. That's just how I prefer my steak, but what I received was rare. I called our server over and proceeded to cut it open to show her. The meat was burnt on the outside and the inside was still purple and blue! She then made a comment that ""that's how we do medium!"" ... I was baffled! The meat is still mooing at me. So she said do you want it to be cook some more. I said yes, after 5 minutes she brought it back p, my same cut and now it's over cooked but I had a meeting and had no time so I am not sending back again. For myself the $75 lunch is a treat but I rather spend that money somewhere else!After the disappointing entree I did ordered Baked Alaska for which they created, it was good and what earned them the 2 stars.For my team who had it on her bucket list, she gave it a meh and said maybe she will give them another shot::::",0,0,0,Jonathan B.,"Bensalem, PA",6,45,25

3.0,1/28/2019,"If I were rating the food alone, I'd give this a 5+ star review, but it's the service at Delmonico's that's really lacking. The initial check-in was fine, along with coat check. My server, on the other hand, was hard to find. After asking about water choices, and sharing the iPad with the drink list, he seemed to disappear for awhile. For the price tag, I had higher expectations and was anticipating more white glove service.   Now, for the food! The porterhouse steak for two was fantastic (with the au poivre sauce) and I'd definitely get the foie gras butter on the side (it's SO worth it), and we loved the whipped potatoes and crab mac-n-cheese. You also must order the baked Alaska dessert -- it's the main reason I chose to celebrate my other half's birthday here -- and it is well worth the calories.

From the customer service to substandard quality of food we will most definitely not be returning. First off, host was very rude when we tried to move our reservation back 1 hour from 6:30 to 7:30. We were told there was no way they could accommodate us. Yet when we arrived after being seated in the basement (also very depressing and not ideal), there was only one other table seated and it remained that way well past 7:30.Less the accommodating customer service aside, we were still willing to keep an open mind regarding the food. However, the appetizers served to me and my party at Delmonicos were some of the worst we have ever had at a ""high end"" steakhouse. Our Ossobuco tasted like a slim Jim quality of beef. Burrata was hard and anything but creamy and light. Not to mention our shrimp cocktail was served lukewarm and rather small compared to any other steakhouses we have dined at in NYC. Despite our inedible apps we were willing to see this meal through to the steak entree. Our steaks were disappointing as well. The beef was tough and not tender. We ordered 3 porterhouse for two, medium rare and we all felt like we were chewing on tough leather. Not thrown in the broiler with sizzling butter as served at Lugers, Mark Jospeh and Wolfgang's. Our food quality was not up to standard for what we paid for a steak dinner in the city. I would recommend if you want to splurge, do not go to Delmonicos.",0,0,0,Daniel A.,"Arlington, NY",142,19,4
4.0,1/26/2019,"For restaurant week 2019 I finally made it to Delmonico's for a solo dinner. I was about 15 minutes late but the staff still accommodated me, which was nice. There were two floors which calls for segregation from the restaurant week people and their high end regular clients. My waiter was awesome and knowledgeable about the menu items. I reviewed the menu for restaurant week and the appetizers were different variations of their regular menu appetizers. So I settled for the burrata with arugula, beets and poached pear, which was tasty with the Portuguese white wine. For the entree, I settled for the miso butternut squash glazed bass, which was part of their regular menu was beautifully presented. The skin was crispy, and the meat combined with the squash and the leeks plus the white wine was perfect, and I felt sad when I finished the plate. But, the highlight of my three course meal was the baked alaska, which I paid $8 more because it's their classic recipe. The dessert presentation was amazing, the walnut cake, banana gelato, and lemon meringue plus carmelization smokiness was to die for.

They seated us downstairs...along with any other African American folks that were in the establishment.  Whether intentional or not, management should think about how that can be perceived...service was slooooow although the ""basement"" was hardly halfway full.  When the waiter did finally approach us he started to explain the menu without greeting us, caught himself, said hello, and proceeded with the menu.  We paid the step up for a couple of the restaurant week menu items.  Bisque and rib eye were delicious but everything else including the short rib and the crab beignets (entirely too small of a serving considering the supplemental $12 that we paid) and all the dessert options were very forgettable.To top it off, when we were initially seated, the hostess was quick to tell my boyfriend to remove his hat.  Okay fine. But for most of my meal I had to look at a patrons DISGUSTING bare feet placed up in visible sight (please see attached picture).  ma'am...this is NOT your living room.  when I addressed it, the server hesitated to say something, and she happened to move them.  they sent us a complimentary dessert and what I thought was complimentary coffee, but they actually charged us for the coffee.  i will say that the manager seems like a nice man...but doesn't make up for the experience at DelmonicosNeedless to say I won't be returning.",2,2,2,Lauren F.,"Hempstead, NY",2,26,6

Cooked perfectly and without any frills, exactly what I'd expect from a traditional NY steakhouse. Macaroni was good but very rich. Martini with bleu cheese olives really brought it all together.

My friends also opted to share a glass of wine while I ordered my own glass. I couldn't decide between two different wines, so I asked our server for a taste of each before making a decision. He came by, poured both, and left. I strongly preferred one over the other, and I offered to let my friends try both wines as well.Server came back, glasses were empty. Before I could say anything, he said, aghast, ""You didn't mix the two wines in one glass did you??"" I was surprised by the question and, to be honest, insulted. Why in the world would I even ask to taste before deciding on a wine if I were to mix the two?? An incredibly rude question, in my opinion. Would I recommend this place? Likely not.

Once seated wait time increased and customer service decreased. It was evident that they were not understaffed, which would've justified the poor service by the server. I had to order my soda 3 times, and the server spent a whole lot longer serving other tables and making sure that they were having a good experience whilst completely neglecting us. Once the food arrived, one of my co-workers order was mixed up. 50/50 fault since the server didn't clarify at the time she placed her order. However, she got very confrontational to the point that the whole table was uncomfortable. This happened twice with two different orders. I ordered the Flatbreat and its easily one of the best FB I've had. I can't say the same for the rest of the table, who were not that impressed with their food.

For the main course, we had the Dover Sole and the   NY strip. The Dover sole is well worth the price - flaky, moist, and thoroughly de-boned.

2.0,12/11/2018,"Came here for a special anniversary- made 7:30 reservations for a Monday. We arrived about 7:15 and were seated at about 10 til 8 in their cellar area. The hostess stand didn't seem too organized, and I know others who arrived later, with later or same time reservations, were seated before us. That aside, when we got downstairs we were both rather shocked at how loud it was. I found myself having to ask our server to repeat himself several times throughout the night, and both of us eventually reached that ""let's not talk, we can't hear each other"" state. Not quiet doesn't bother us, but, as my partner mentioned, a subway station might be quieter. (It did seem quieter upstairs, it could have been the acoustics downstairs.) He enjoyed the extensive list of scotch and whiskey, I got the signature cocktail. It was good, headed by sweet vermouth. We decided to split the crispy oysters which I quite enjoyed, and both got the Delmonico steak, medium rare, with Brussels sprouts, potatoes and spinach to split. His steak came out very undercooked (cold red Center) and mine was a bit less done than the medium rare I ordered (lukewarm red Center) but I didn't say anything knowing I wasn't going to get through the 14 oz of meat, and this would fare better for rehearing later. The potatoes and spinach were good sides- the real let down was the Brussels sprouts. They were exactly what you remember hating as a kid- steamed (or allowed to sit in a warming tray so long they had steamed) and with that pungent bitter grossness that is unique to this veggie when poorly prepared. You couldn't stab them with a fork- they squished and became mush. Anyways, we let the waiter know and he took them off our check thankfully, but man they were memorably bad. There was also no note of the celebration, mentioned when we made the reservation.This would all be okay, but at a place where you're paying $100+ pp quite easily, I just expect more. Even the service was just average. The menu's first page mentioned bringing the restaurant back to the peak of culinary perfection after decades of neglect.

5.0,12/10/2018,"I was recently in NYC on a work trip and have been dying to check out Delmonico's for years. So two weeks ago I did just that. A colleague and I called to make a reservation for 7pm on a Monday and got one without much hassle. When we arrived we used coat check which was quick and painless and we were then shown to our table in the center of the dining room. The dining room is very regal and something out of a bygone era. There are huge paintings on the back wall, the flatware was embossed with Delmonico's logo, and everything was emblematic of a historic white table cloth restaurant. Immediately a waiter came over and asked what we wanted to drink. We flipped through their iPad with a vast amount of beers, wines, cocktails, etc. and settled on two glasses of red wine and tap water for the table. We quickly decided on each getting the ribeye and a side. I opted for my ribeye to come with blue cheese while my friend got his without any dressings. As for the side, I got the hashbrowns and my friend opted for the garlic butter mashed potatoes. After placing our order we surveyed the scene. As this restaurant is so close to Wall Street it was mostly filled with banker/hedge fund/lawyer types in their suits after a Monday making deals. I definitely felt a little underdressed in casual chinos and collared shirt but the restaurant didn't give any grief for that. When the food arrived maybe 20 minutes later my ribeye was perfectly cooked! I estimate the ribeye to have been about 14 ounces which was definitely quite a bit to eat. That said, it was one of the most flavorful steaks I have ever had and I finished it off entirely. The sides were excellent too. I loved the crunch on the hashbrowns and the mashed potatoes were incredibly rich and buttery. Definitely delicious. Overall this was one of the best steak dinners I have ever had. That ribeye was cooked to perfection and had so much flavor. Any steak I have going forward will face steep competition as the bar is now set really high. The wait staff were very attentive and friendly and made the experience memorable. All in all this $210 meal (for the both of us) was worth every penny, even if I blew through my per diem for the day while traveling for work haha. Will I go back?

""Lobster Newberg"", is another meal created here, and finally, next time you have ""Baked Alaska "", for desert think of Delmonico's because a chef at Delmonico's created this desert.  Sorry but I love this kind of stuff.When you sit down the table is set with Delmonico's monogrammed plates, but they're just for show, they are taken away after everyone settles in. That's  ok with me, I understand it.Ok the food.. Marina was our waitress and knew every meal on the menu like she just finished eating it. She even made suggestions on what not to eat. It's Delmonico's, so I had the Delmonico's Signature Steak and it was as good as I expected, tender and cooked perfectly. Oh, I started with their version of Frois Grais, which you must have when you go there.We had an assortment of sides for the table which were excellent. My favorite was the roasted Brussels Sprouts.Finally, finished with, that's right, Baked Alaska, which was so good, it was like having a cigarette after sex.  Just fabulous.Everyone else had different types of steak which they all raved about. One person had the lobster Newburg, which she went on and on about. Lastly, the bill. This is not you run of the mill steak house. This is New York City, as John Lennon once said, "" The center of the Universe"", and one of the most iconic restaurants in the world.

When you first walk in, you'll notice that old school classic NY steakhouse feel that adds to the charm and history of the restaurant. We were immediately sat, it didn't look particularly busy on this afternoon. We ordered the 45 day dry-aged prime ribeye steak, the Heritage Pig Bolognese and a side of Delmonico's potatoes. No drinks for us on particular day but the wine list was extensive and looked impressive. The whole drink menu was actually displayed on an iPad that the waiter hands to you which I thought was very cool. First, the 45 day dry-aged prime ribeye steak. JUST WOW. It might be the best steak I've had so far in this city. Cooked to a perfect medium-rare, the inside was succulently juicy while the outside had a nice charred crunch to it. You can really taste the dry-aged flavor. Some restaurants in the city will say their steak is dry-aged for X amount of days meanwhile having no dry-aged flavor but this steak, you can really tell by the flavor that it's real. Next, the Heritage Pig ""Bolognese"". WOW AGAIN. It's large rigatoni pasta with a Bolognese sauce made with pig cheeks. The pasta was made a perfect al dente, just how I like it. I'm a pasta fiend and this one flies straight to the top of my list for pasta dishes in the city. MUST TRY.Last we tried the Delmonico's potatoes. It was sort of a like hot potato salad with more of a consistency of gravy. Good but skippable. Probably better sides on the menu.Overall, amazing flavor experience at Delmonico's.

4.0,9/20/2018,Once the best steakhouse in the world. We began with lobster bisque then we each ordered the steak of choice. Two had filet mignon and I had the famous Delmonico steak au poive. The bisque sadly  was a great disappointment. We complained to each other as we were eating it but that was it. We didn't return it. Definitely the chef was off on that one.  Our steaks were delicious and the choices of sides were great. We didn't have dessert this time because the offering was not appealing as in the past. I was somewhat disappointed but I won't write them off.,0,0,0,Catherine N.,"Pearland, TX",515,36,23

We had Alex as our server and he is the reason that I am giving 5 stars rather than 4. The food was very good, but the experience Alex provided is what put it over the top.

It appeared as though we were being rushed. We ordered an appetizer for the table (burrata with watermelon salad), which was not bad. Two of my guest was really excited about trying the crab Mac and Cheese.  It did not live up to the excitement. The steaks overall were cooked correctly, BUT the waiter made a HUGE mistake (since he was not attentive) by adding the au poivre to my entire filet migon. I mean my meat was swimming in sauce.  I specially asked for it on the side so a coworker can try it.  If you know how to cook steak you don't need sauce. And the one thing you do not do is send it back.  Super disappointed!The establishment is nice, but that's about it.",0,0,0,Wendy B.,"Chicago, IL",68,8,2

I generally don't like blue cheese but they did a fantastic job of balancing out the pungency with the veggies. Loved it.A good steakhouse doesn't go wrong with steaks. On the rare side my steak was pink and juicy when you cut into it. The broccoli was brilliant. Nicely cooked but somehow had a semi crispy outside. The mashed potatoes weren't fancy like you get at some places but the comfort kind. Highly recommend getting a standard steak, veggies, and potatoes.The baked Alaska was good.

Their was 2 bartenders serving me for some odd reason. Well the manager didn't serve me she just wanted to confirm my order and take my card. I told the first server what i wanted to eat and after I told her the manager came to confirm my order and asked for my card after getting my order. She said ""it's busy tonight so I'm going to need your card"". Mind you it was not busy at the bar and it's still a abhorrent excuse because I'm staying at the bar.  At that moment i got a weird feeling in my stomach after I was asked for my card to eat at the bar. 3-5minutes later a Caucasian gentleman walks in and sit right next to me and makes a order. No collateral was asked from the gentleman and my blood started to boil. So after my appetizer i asked to pay my bill because i felt immensely uncomfortable and just disgusted after such foul treatment. The first bar tender that took my order who served my food offered me a free drink to stay after I explained to her what's goin on in my head right now because she knew it was wrong. Then she begged me not to leave for like 2-3minutes and to just eat the steak or have it to go. I felt so embarrassed  and confused like what did I do to be mistreated like this.

4.0,8/8/2018,"To start I would give this place a 4.5 and the only reason why it's docked anything is due to the affordability. Definitely not somewhere you just pop in to get a meal. My friends and I reserved a table for here for the restaurant week prix fixe dinner. Our reservation was at 5:30PM on a Friday night and it wasn't very crowded when we were seated.Located in the Financial District and titled the oldest restaurant in NYC , I was excited to see that iconic flat iron-esque building structure, but they were doing some construction or renovations so I only saw scrim covering the entire front entrance of the building. Anyway, it was still nice on the inside and such a pleasant escape from the summer heat and humidity. There was still a good enough selection on the restaurant week menu. I decided to get the naked ravioli as the appetizer, the sirloin for the entree and opted for the $6 supplement to get the baked alaska for dessert. My husband opted for the $15 supplement to get the Lobster Newberg for the appetizer. Seeing as how these two items debuted at Delmonico's we thought that there was no better time or place to try them. Before the meal even came out, we got a basket of bread and whipped (and PIPED!) butter. The flavor of the bread was really tasty and a little sweet, not very light, almost as if it was like a soda bread.The naked ravioli comes out with 2 pieces of ravioli in a mushroom lemon sauce with some peas, parm, and microgreens. I don't quite remember what it was filled with but it was cheesy. The skin was a little thick, but still pleasant. My husband got the Lobster Newberg and I got to try some and it was really delicious. The roasted sirloin was amazing, I think it's a 7 oz serving. It was really well seasoned and only cooked to one temperature, medium. I think the cook was closer to a medium rare, but I was not complaining at all, the cook was perfect. I tried a piece of my friend's filet mignon and I personally preferred the sirloin. If I can dare to say it, I think the sirloin was even softer than the filet and on top of that sirloin in general is a more flavorful cut of meat. I don't know if they mashed the fingerling potatoes, but the potatoes were amazingly smooth and buttery beyond belief. The broccoli wasn't bad either. The baked alaska was a true treat to look at. To be honest, as glad as I am to have tried it, I probably wouldn't get it from here again if I was given the chance. It was a bit underwhelming to me. It was a spiced walnut cake with banana gelato on top, covered in a meringue and toasted served with an apricot coulis. I think the texture of the cake was a little crumby and wasn't the most enjoyable to me. Since this was my first time trying Baked Alaska I cannot compare it with anything or have a standard for it. The amount of meringue was a little too much for me as well. I really did like having it with the apricot coulis though as it was a nice sharp contrast to the sweet and creamy flavor profiles. The service was very good and our waiter definitely knew what he was doing and knew how to work in that caliber of a restaurant, but it was a little intimidating. I am left handed so when I moved my spoon from the right side to the left side for dessert he very pointedly slid it over from the left side to the right side before putting my dessert down. I understand there are a lot of restaurant etiquette rules so as a diner who doesn't frequent very fancy restaurants it was a little intimidating and I felt a little out of my element. Our waiter did a very good job though.I'm glad we were able to try Delmonico's for restaurant week, and I'm glad that I'll be able to say I've dined here before and tried the Lobster Newberg and Baked Alaska.",4,4,3,Jane C.,"Manhattan, NY",301,91,127

5.0,8/7/2018,"I don't even know where to start, Delmonico's is AMAZING! As soon as I found out the dates for restaurant week I zoomed over to open table to lock down a reservation since Delmonico's always books up fast. I was here a couple weeks for dinner at 6:30 PM (it as busy but not crazy) and where do I begin...The soft romantic lighting gave it this classy yet sexy feel; I felt like I transported back in time to the 20s. The waiters dressed alike, they were kind, very formal and attentive. The high ceilings made me feel like I was in a grand hall... ok, ok, I'll get to the food now.The bf and I started off with the ""CRISPY OYSTER JIM BRADY"" ($22):Bacon Relish, and Ho - Jo Tartar Sauce. This was off the restaurant week menu and it was well worth it the crunch on the oyster was perfect, it tasted amazing. There were 5 or 6 I can't remember because they went so fast. We ordered the special feature restaurant week bottle of wine for $42 dollars it was a cab sav and it was excellent, went perfectly with the meal. We went on to order our apps; I got the seasonal summer soup, which was a cold avocado soup, it was very good, I just wish I got something it bit heartier since I really wasn't in the mood for a cold soup, either way, it was good. The bf got the ""Naked Ravioli"" which was sweet peas, wild mushrooms, preserved Meyer lemon and parmesan. I didn't even know what he got because it went so fast, he loved it. I had plate envy and I didn't even see it (lol). Now to the main event...dinner. I ordered the Petit Filet Mignon, which came with mash potatoes and seasonal veggies (broccoli) and the bf got Prime Delmonico Rib Eye ($20 Supplement) it came with the same sides I had. Let me tell you, we both cut into our steaks and ate the first piece and looked at each other and said WOW, I don't know if it happened exactly like that, but something to that effect. We were in awe! My Filet Mignon was like butter, it was smooth, rich, salted perfectly, medium-rare, and just a slice of heaven. The mash potatoes, well first off there was just not enough if I would have known how good they were I would have ordered a side! The broccoli was great too; they were baked and had a bit of crunch, I really enjoyed it since I'm a big baked broccoli fan! I, of course, had to try the Rib Eye and, damn it was good! Next time, because there will be one, I'm going to go for that since it was obvi a bigger piece of meat and just tasty as hell! The finale was the Classic Baked Alaska ($6 Supplement), which is Walnut Cake, Apricot Jam, Banana Gelato, and Meringue! WOW- it was like slicing into heaven, my spoon glided right through and it took me to the promise land. It was light, fluffy, sweet, and simple, yet delicious. The perfect way to end a perfect dinner.  I never gloated like this about any restaurant, it was such a great experience-from the attentive service to the atmosphere, everything exceeded my expectations.

Knowing that we were ordering off the restaurant week menu I half expected the steak servings to be as close to 3 ounces as they could reasonably put on a plate, but it looked like a solid 6-8 ounce cut. It was very good and perfectly cooked. It also came with mashed potatoes and broccoli. I got the ravioli to start with and while it was incredible, that serving size was much more in line with my expectations, as it was literally two pieces of ravioli- though very delicious pieces. Luckily, the steak size made up for it. The chocolate mousse cake was nothing particularly noteworthy but was good and the size was reasonable. The staff were all very nice, which I hadn't necessarily expected given that it's a very expensive restaurant and that we were there for restaurant week(meaning smaller bill and tip).

4.0,7/31/2018,"Decided to kickstart restaurant week with one of the oldest steakhouses in New York. We came for dinner as we wanted to try their filet mignon. We arrived a few minutes early before our 7pm reservation but had to wait a bit because a lot of other people also made reservations. Restaurant week brings everyone out! We got seated and got right to ordering! For an appetizer, I ordered the tomato salad. Salad was pretty salad, nothing too special but we didn't come for salad. We also had fries. They were fantastic, perfectly seasoned and just the right amount of crisp. For our entree, we both got the filet mignon, medium rare. It came out in a timely fashion for a restaurant that was pretty busy. As soon as it came out, we got to cutting. Steak was amazing. Perfectly medium rare with pink on the inside. The filet was so tender and easy to cut. The meat was very flavorful and did not require extra sauce. Each bite made me want more. I can see why this place has the reputation they do.For dessert, I got the chocolate mousse cake. It was good, not overly sweet and quite interesting as they seem to have some sort of water base, adding a crunchy texture to each bite of the cake.I want to add that our server and all the staff were very friendly and attentive. They always checked to make sure everything was ok for us and our glass were never empty for long.If price was holding you back from tying this wonderful establishment, consider it a steal now with a 3 course dinner for $42.

As we were working through our meal, the place started filling up. By the time we left, it was pretty full. We each had different salad for appetizers and got salmon and sirloin.

There weren't too many veggie options in the menu..yet they agreed to create an entree portion out of the veggie appetizer and we didn't even put efforts to explain it.Wine was priced reasonably-$42 for a bottle during lunch.

Some Parmesan or truffle oil would've saved it though. The onion rings were delicious! It was crispy and airy. We opted to get the blue cheese dressing on the side so we can dip it instead and we didn't want soggy onion rings. The charred corn and creamed spinach were sound choices. I definitely recommend getting them.I tried my brother's signature steak aka the ribeye... it was delicious! I might've liked his more than mine. My boyfriend and I shared the dry aged tomahawk. It was delicious but I think the signature steak was better bang for the buck. The drinks were a little bit overpriced but my mojito was perfect. It was just strong enough for me to taste the booze, but it was also minty, sweet and acidic. Overall, this isn't the best steakhouse in NYC.

3.0,6/8/2018,"To celebrate my sister's birthday, and continue a birthday tradition, it was time for some steak!For this birthday, she decided she wanted to visit the venerable Delmonico's.Decor is what you would expect from a restaurant touted to go back to 1837, with a dark interior befitting candle-light, oil paintings on the wall, dark wooden furniture, and white tablecloths.Our starter was DiPaolo's Burrata. The herb pesto and fresh Burrata made for a tasty herbaceous and rich combination. The only negative being the overly buttery garlic toast which was pretty greasy.For our entrees we both had scanned the menu the day before and she ordered the signature Delmonico steak, and I had my stomach set on the 45-day dry-aged Prime Ribeye.The restaurant's namesake steak (equivalent to a boneless ribeye) was delicious from what my sister proclaimed and bestowed with some pieces I also agreed.There was plenty of beef flavor despite being only wet-aged, a great distribution of tasty beef fat, and a nice crisp sear on the steakHowever, I was left a bit disappointed. It was a very good steak and cooked to my desired medium-rare, but concerning taste I was expecting the touted 45-day dry-aging to impart more flavor. I found the flavor and texture of my sister's signature Delmonico (wet-aged, Prime boneless Ribeye) steak better. It also helped that the Delmonico was cut visibly thicker than my steak. Delmonico's does not list sizes of their steak on their menu, so in my best estimation, I think my Ribeye was somewhere around 18oz - 20oz, with my sister's Delmonico weighing in around 22oz. - 24oz.We both found the crispy string of onions served on top of the steak pretty lifeless in flavor, and (in my opinion) actually detracted from the eye-appeal of the steak.For side dishes, we were deciding beforehand what to order and decided on the Roasted Cauliflower and the house-cut French Fries.Roasted Cauliflower was okay, with each floret being of good size and seasoned well. I enjoyed the little pickled raisins, but could not discern the listed Manchego cheese nor Truffle honey.The ho-hum sounding house-cut French Fries were delicious and even more welcome was the aioli dip served on the side. Fries were cut long & thick, crisp, and seasoned perfectly.The ailoi was creamy, but balanced well with a hit of either garlic and onion.NO birthday meal is complete without dessert, and at Delmonico's one has to try the famous Baked Alaska.We had pretty mild expectations for the Baked Alaska due to it's pretty mundane ingredients, but would up enjoying it immensely. The warm toasted and fluffy light meringue playing against the cool semi-solid ice cream provided a awesome contrast in texture. Especially tasty was the distinct flavor of the banana ice cream too!We added another dessert in Delmonico's Profiterole Donut.The near-black chocolate syrup poured on top was fabulously rich and dark chocolate tasting with just a mild sweetness...I would buy gallons of this black gold!Not to be overlooked were the caramelized Macadamia nuts garnished on top which were sweet and crunchy, pairing in texture to the softer components.Surprisingly, the decadent ingredients did not translate to an overly heavy dessert in my opinion. The Profiterole itself was very airy and the cream was very light.Finally, service was just okay, but not to my standards for a renowned restaurant in this price range.Some points contributing to my opinion:- Our waiter failed to ask us about refilling our drinks despite us finishing our drinks halfway into the meal.- In fact, I believe he only came by once to ask us how our dinner experience was going.- We waited nearly 10 minutes before finally having to gesture for the waiter to get the check.While Delmonico's is certainly worth a visit just to say you've eaten here, in my opinion, if you're weighing Delmonico's against other top NYC steakhouses, I would maybe look elsewhere.",7,3,4,Edward C.,"Matawan, NJ",163,350,1427

5.0,6/2/2018,"Wow. Haven't been here in about six years. All I remembered was the steak and ambience was so good. I came back here for a celebration with my girlfriend who has never been here before. Just looking at the menu she was happy. Let alone we were about to have steak. I love a good steakhouse like anyone but I prefer steakhouses with a history behind it and boy does this place have history. Being the FIRST yes first restaurant in the United States of America and also the first steakhouse in the country I already loved it. When I first came here I ordered the filet Mignon and it was delicious. We ordered the pan roasted scallops with figs and warm burrata. The pesto that came with the burrata was perfect and to die for so much so I asked my waiter David if there was a way I could purchase some ( unfortunately not for sale). But David did say next time the chef came out maybe he could tell us, which I thought was a nice gesture and did not expect the chef to come out just for pesto. I WAS WRONG. Executive Chef William Oliva came out just after our main course was brought out. He told us how to make the pesto and was very nice to meet. Very solid gentleman. He chatted with us for a little bit and of course had to get back to running his kitchen. But I was amazed I got to meet him. So this time we ordered the 28 day dry aged porterhouse which comes with the cuts of filet and sirloin. The dry aging made this steak that much more enjoyable. From cutting into the juicy tender meat I just had to barely press my knife into before the piece cut. Such a satisfying feeling. I must add I order my steak medium rare and the amount of flavor was amazing. To the waitstaff and David our waiter and him having the executive Chef come to our table for a pesto recipe. This experience takes the cake of any other steakhouse I've been too. I am definitely coming back here more often and highly recommend",0,0,0,Vinny M.,"Dyker Heights, Brooklyn, NY",1,10,23

Didn't need any sauces on it either. Just some salt and pepper. Woot woot! 5/5 on this steak $51 for this item. For the side, I ordered the king crab Mac and cheese!!! $20 for this. This was really good. I enjoyed eating this. 5/5!Wanna know the best part? My wife and I don't eat large portions so the server said he would cut up the steak so we could share. So freaking amazing.

3.0,4/2/2018,"Restaurant week review!We chose this spot for a few reasons: it was one of the places we were able to get a restaurant week reservation, it is famous/iconic (established in 1837 I believe), and because it was in a convenient enough location. Delmonico's seems to have gone through a couple changes over the years, so I can't say how closely it resembles that which it once was, but the theme that they go for now is old-timey American. They specialize in American classic dishes, though they are best known for steak.Since it was restaurant week, everyone's order was a flat $42 before tax and tip. There were a couple appetizers to choose from, but some of them required price markups if you wanted to get the full version (for instance, certain sizes/cuts of steak had an extra $20 associated with the cost). None of our party did this, so we mainly had to choose from three main dishes: chicken a la keene, mini filet mignon, and beef short ribs. I had found out beforehand that Delmonico's is allegedly where chicken a la keene was invented, so I knew before arriving what I was going to get. For my appetizer I got the lobster bisque (for some reason everyone else picked the risotto), and for my dessert I ordered the cheesecake.The lobster bisque tasted a little different from what I was used to, in that it lacked it's usual savory punch that I associate with lobster bisque. If anything, it was slightly on the bitter side. My chicken a la keene was a big surprise, as I had always thought it was supposed to be a kind of, heavy white cream kind of dish. Instead, there was hardly any cream sauce on my plate, and instead the chicken had been cooked with a much lighter sauce, accompanied with some vegetables. Underneath I was served some pasta, which had a slightly creamer sauce mixed it, but seemed to have been prepared separately from the chicken. Finally, my cheesecake was more on the creamier, liquidy side- not like those concrete blocks you get at juniors- and pretty enjoyable.Overall, I had a good experience here, but I'm not sure I'd make this a regular spot. Restaurant week is supposed to be something of a discount, and I can't picture myself paying even more money for food which was great, but a little uninspired. Perhaps that comes with the territory when you're a restaurant which has been around since 1837- you stick to the classics- but on my plate, it translated into something that I wasn't hugely excited about. Still the dining space is beautiful, and I could see myself coming back here for the ambiance. The bar is especially nice, and they play sports in there, so that's another thing to check out in the future.",6,3,4,Matt L.,"New York, NY",108,694,604

Yes it is pricey but its a classic Manhattan steak house... and the portions are huge. You can easily get two meals out of each (pro tip: heat the steak on your oven's ""warm"" setting and, while not as good as the day before when it was fresh, it still tastes pretty awesome and you can make use of steakhouse leftovers). We also ordered some classic cocktails (Old Fashioned, Manhattan) which are nothing original but were perfectly executed.We had the famed Baked Alaska. It may have been invented here but it has definitely been improved at other places (i.e. it was underwhelming for such a famous dish).

3.0,2/28/2018,"As what it is known for, Delmonico's steak is between good and great. At least, you would not be disappointed if you are looking for a good quality beef cooked in moderately gourmet style.I tried Delmonico Classic Bone In 45 Day Dry Aged Steak during NYC restaurant week and it was better than I expected. The steak was well seasoned and came out to be perfect medium rare as requested. It was worth the price regarding how most restaurants fail to even get the order right these days. Nothing so special about Maplebrook Farm Burrata. It was just regular salad. The presentation was great. I wish I had taken a picture of it.Let's talk about the desserts. Both Dark Chocolate Mousse Cake and New York Style Cheesecake are beyond great. They are one of the best desserts I had throughout my foodie journey. Mousse cake had that crunch layer at the top and it was delicately soft inside. Most importantly, it perfectly captured the correct sweetness required to not bore your palate and maintain consistency. I would say the cheesecake was amazing as well. What's so great about their desserts is that they are not too sweet and not too blend. There is one problem with this restaurant: their services. Staffs are not really motivated to work.

4.0,2/15/2018,"For fans of Speed and Matrix star Keanu Reeves's surprise cult action hit series ""John Wick,"" Delmonico's is definitely a curiosity. The assassins' hotel in Reeves's films was filmed here, though there are some misconceptions about what exactly. The INTERIOR scenes of the hotel were filmed in Demonico's (not a hotel, but a restaurant). And the EXTERNAL scenes were filmed at some other place. Why the confusion? Because Delmonico's building is a famous 'flat-iron shaped' exterior, and so is the other building. For those as confused as I was about John Wick filming locations, consult this useful website: legendarytrips.com/2014/…OK, moving on. You can probably get an impromptu seating pretty easily. We did, and I was wearing a Lakers hoodie and looking very unlike most of the FinanceBro clientele here. I had the risotto, liver, and the Delmonico's cut (rib eye), along with cheesecake. All of it was delicious. No 5 stars, though, because you can't truly be top tier if you don't serve prime rib, sorry. I understand why restaurants don't serve it: you have to cook it all day, and then you have to bank on enough customers who want it, else it's a waste.

Was really impressed by the history behind it and the fact that many of my favorite staple dishes were invented here. Unfortunately, my dining experience at Delmonico's was quite disappointing, especially taking the $300 bill into the account. We ordered Delmonico's signature steak, 28 days dry-aged steak, roasted asparagus, delmonico potatoes, oysters, fois-gras and baked Alaska for the dessert. Most of the food was pretty decent, except for asparagus which first of all was cut into pieces (I expected nice, green, lengthy asparagus shoots instead) and tasted nasty as if whoever made it, made it in the pan in which he cooked fish before. Yuck. The rest of our dinner was okay, nothing stellar. However, there were two other things I didn't like. First, the lighting (too dim for me) and the interior decor.

2.0,2/4/2018,"What a disappointment. I was so looking forward to my first Delmonico's experience. The food & wine were 5-star worthy but a shameful hospitality experience knocks my rating to a 2. I  wish I had just left and gone to Harry's. My friend and I were seated timely to our 9:15 reservations but at a table outside of the dining room - we were basically eating in the lobby. (say no to table 46)It would have seemed that 'good service' meant your waiter should stand 10 feet from your table and watch you as you discuss the menu. That, or the lobby is a good vantage point from which to observe tables actually IN the dining room. In any case, it was awkward feeling hovered over so closely. My chief complaint however was regarding Restaurant Week, but more so how it was handled. My fault for not FINDING all the facts or their rules, but their mobile website & RW menu had no mention of Saturday restrictions. Our waiter did helpfully suggest we speak with the manager about it. We accepted. After some side chatter among staff and seemingly some confusion, were visited by an assistant mgr, as the manager had ""stepped out"", who repeatedly informed us of their ""policies"" and if they ""made an exception for one we'd have to for all"" and how I ""should have gone to the official  Restaurant Week site"" - she offered no discernible regrets regarding missing information on their own website. Basically everything she said made me feel undervalued and uneducated - this is not how a manager should leave a customer feeling after an interaction; and with zero accommodations offered. I was mad. We should have left because of her. I regret that we stayed as I had definitely lost my zeal for this 'first-time experience'. My friend was sure they'd offer some gesture of hospitality during the meal or some surprise compensation in the check, if even a small one - but no.  Add to this that our waiter left mid-service, telling us his shift ended. From our lobby table we saw him dressed to leave but chatting with staff at the hostess podium. This is not the experience I would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. Delmonico's, you ought to be striving to offer impeccable hospitality in keeping with the merit of your rich history.

I am not certain how this place has so many awesome reviews based upon my most recent experience. It is very well possible that I personally expect a higher degree towards excellence if I am dining at an establishment well known over the years for top quality food service delivery. I was disappointed with my first and last visit to this restaurant. My main gripe with this place is the temperature of the food. If I order braised short ribs I expect the dish to come with a temperature rivaling hot or at least close to ""just coming out of the oven"". Unfortunately, it was not and neither were the rest of the dishes presented to our table of four. After a thoroughly disappointing meal for all of us we decided to order the absolute worst dessert in the history of desserts not to die for....The Baked Alaska. Wow! was it gross. The banana flavored cake with gritty hard frozen vanilla ice cream and the scorched fluff exterior made for a dessert not worth tasting. Power to all of the people that dine here for the status because that must be the only reason to frequent a dungeon like this. Shame on you Delmonico for ripping people off over 100 years. Everyone should do themselves a favor and if you go to the restaurant and do not like the food make sure to let the server know. It is apparent that no one in the kitchen either cares or is aware of the atrocities leaving the cooktop. Thumbs down all around!Meals: all of them are over priced but these are the main dishes we hadDelmonico Signature Steak-not warm but tender. Had better elsewhereDelmonico Potatoes-worth a try, but who comes to a steakhouse only for potatoes?Lamb chops-this is better at Texas de Brazil at any location you can find and it is endless when you go there. Can someone from Delmonico's go taste this item at a restaurant that knows how this should be done?Braised short rib-I had better during a demonstrative speech in college when someone brought to class in a bucket.

Take note the restaurant week menu has a lot of items that require a supplement. The baked alaska we got for incidence was $8 extra (but so worth it)! For starters he got the blue cheese salad and I got the crab cake. Both were solid and had a lot of flavor. For entrees he got the short rib and I got the fish of the day which was striped bass. He liked his and I liked mine but honestly I expected better (hence knocked off a star). Don't get me wrong it wasn't bad, just expected a lot better. Guess I should just stick to steak at a steak place lol! Now the best part- the dessert! Believe in the hype, the baked alaska is amazing. The right amount of warmth (for lack of better terms) and coolness. The right amount of banana flavor, meringue, and walnut cake as well. Tried some of his cheesecake too and it was good (didn't stand out but hey they're not known for their cheesecake). As mentioned, the one item we ordered off the regular menu was the lobster Mac and cheese and, well, no regrets on that. Though they could've added more lobster, the Mac and cheese was so unbelievably good I could care less about the scarcity of lobster.

4.0,11/26/2017,"Not sure where to start with this place.... I have only been 3 times in my lifetime & I have to say I have never been disappointed with the food and service. The place is pretty hoity toity (upscale); with that being said I didn't find it very memorable or enjoyable (more of a monotone vibe). I usually have the the signature Delmonico steak which is always amazing (and should be for the price), but if you prefer a leaner steak with less fat, then this is definitely not the steak for you.I recommend this place for a special dinner celebration as the food is excellent, but I don't feel it's a place to frequent for a couple of reasons: 1st: I don't think the menu EVER changes, 2nd: prices are not reasonable (the tab has always been over $200 for 2 people-hence why  I've only gone once a year over the past 3 years) and lastly.... not very memorable, the environment felt a little up tight.  The staff were very attentive, without much personality (I guess this is the tone all around).Bottom line, Delmonico's is truly an iconic & historic fixture of NYC so as a New Yorker you must try it at least once. Based on the food quality, I rate this place 4.5 stars. If I had to rate the environment & ambiance, I'd give it 3 stars (guess I'm not at that success point in life yet where everything has to be so serious & uptight).  It is a true classic upscale experience, but if you're looking for the latest & greatest go elsewhere.",0,0,0,Daisy M.,"Queens, NY",0,17,0

Bar/grill area was very crowded and two bartenders behind the bar were clearly overwhelmed. After waiting for solid 10 mins for the bartender fill drink tickets, my vodka soda came out with a very big dose of attitude from the bartender. When I asked to see the wine list for a glass (and Delmonico's doesn't have one online), bartender yelled at me for not having my full order ready. Then not to mention waiting additional 15 mins to close my tab. When seated I asked our waiter if they had a sommelier that night. He said no and tried to upsell wines that he actually was not very knowledgable about (I am a certified sommelier myself).

My fiancé had the 45 Day aged ribeye and I had the gold reserve filet mignon. For appetizers we had the oysters which were an amazing quality ( had an almost sweet aftertaste which complimented the overall flavor), and had the creamed spinach and king crab Mac and cheese as our appetizers. We asked our server for a wine that suited our taste preference and were extremely delighted when he got it right on the first try ! I was so surprised at his knowledge concerning this since most of the time we settle for whatever bottle of wine servers who have no idea what they're talking about give us (haha). The gold reserve filet mignon melted in my mouth like butter and the aged ribeye really makes a huge difference in comparison to traditional ribeyes as far as the juicy and tenderness of the meat!

That perhaps when it's ordered, they take it out of the freezer and let it sit out for 5-10 mins to let it soften - there's a layer of cake at the bottom. Plus apricot jam on the cake.

The main dining room was half empty on a Saturday night, and while you think that would make for a lucky coincidence and a quieter atmosphere, it was actually a little depressing. There were a lot of staff members standing around not doing much, so despite a dining area full of wait staff, the service was slow. The waiter assisting my partner and I said a few rude and dismissive words to us in response to a question we asked about the menu when we first arrived.

If your gonna pay top dollar in this neighborhood I recommend going to Mark Joseph's.,0,0,0,Phuong P.,"Pennsauken Township, NJ",28,124,0
5.0,9/6/2017,"I do not eat steak often, but when I have the opportunity to eat a steak. I want a good steak, my last trip to a local restaurant that many said was one of the best steak of their lives was a total disappointment. So when I was invited to go to Delmonico's, I was skeptical. I had been to Delmonico's a while ago on a Groupon and found it pretty good. Well the filet was cooked as I had specified and is ranked as one of the best steaks I have ever had. The broccoli and mashed potatoes superb, the broccoli dish was the best for me. The potatoes good not great but really good. We did not have appetizers, I did not want to spoil my taste buds for the red meat. Some have questioned the atmosphere as being a bit old. But my thought is some things should have an air of the old class. Somethings need to just be refined and good. The make a really good steak.",0,0,0,Mobea J.,"North Bergen, NJ",3,45,0

4.0,8/21/2017,"I've heard of Delmonico's but definitely have never even thought about trying it out because it's a bit expensive. So for an early Birthday dinner, I decided to bring my boyfriend here. (It was also the last day of Restaurant Week and I REALLY wanted to try some place worth it for the prefix price.) **Not 5 stars because drink service was slow.**I made reservations a week before for dinner at 6:45 p.m. on Friday, August 18th on OpenTable and had no problem at all. I had to change my reservation time around because my boyfriend was caught up at work so we ended up with a 7:45 pm at last minute.We got there at 7:20 and let the hostess up front know that we had a reservation but we're a bit early. She asked for my name, checked our umbrellas and reservation in, and was seated within 2 minutes. We got one of the three 2-person tables on the main dining area all the way in the back booth slot and it wasn't too crowded.As soon as we sat, a nice older waiter handed us menus and had our iced water filled. We both went with the Restaurant Week menu and my boyfriend ordered the Delmonico No. 1 cocktail. These cocktails were STRONG but my boyfriend loved it cause it was exactly what he needed after a long week of work.For appetizers I got the Lobster Newberg for a $15 supplement and he got the Baby Iceberg Wedge Salad. These came really quickly which surprised us because it was literally only within a couple of minutes of putting in our order with our waiter. My newberg was good and lobster was just exactly cooked. I usually like my lobster tail with a little bit of bite to it but it was a little more soft/tender/mushy than I'd like, which made me kept thinking if it was raw or a bad lobster...? Also, I generally just don't eat raw food so I wasn't into that texture at all. My boyfriend's salad was good but he said there was A LOT of blue cheese... maybe a little too much for his liking. My portion was good, there were some sliced veggies, 2 claws and one small lobster tail that's halved and his salad was a good appetizer size.For entrees I got the Petite Filet Mignon (only available during dinner) and he got the Delmonico Classic Steak ($18 supplement) and these were perfect. I asked for medium and he got medium rare, both were cooked to perfection. I was always skeptical about Restaurant Week menu items because although there's a supplement, I feel like I've read a lot of reviews where they say they skimp out on the portions but this was definitely not the case. My petite filet mignon was indeed petite, I wish there was a bit more but I finished everything on my plate, including the roasted fingerling potatoes and broccoli. His steak was definitely worth it. It was a good size steak, definitely an inch thick and even my boyfriend who usually eats a good amount of steak, said he was full from it.For dessert, I got the Classic Baked Alaska ($6 supplement) and he got the New York Cheesecake. I noted in our reservation online, that we were coming to celebrate his birthday and the not once did I mention it in person at the restaurant but the waiter lit a candle and had it in his cheesecake when it came out! He made a wish and it was extra special for him! The cheesecake was very soft and mousse-y, it was good but a bit warm? We wish it was actually cold. My baked alaska was delicious and a lot to eat! I couldn't finish it but the toasted marshmallow fluff and ice cream inside was delicious. Not a fan of the sour/tart syrup/sauce they had around the plate because it was VERY sour haha.Overall, it was a great experience, especially with the Restaurant Week menu, which is why I chose to come. The only thing that makes it one less star was the drink service was slow. My boyfriend got a total of 2 of their Delmonico No.1 but those took sometime to get to us... It wasn't until halfway into our entrees did the first drink finally come. The waitress was nice and did stop by after we ate our appetizer to let us know the drink was coming, which it wasn't for another 10-15 mins.Other than that, portions were good (see pictures) and the experience was nice. The prefix menu plus the 2 drinks came out to a total of about $173 with tax and with a 20% tip, it was just over $200. I tipped 20% because I actually really enjoyed their service, I've head bad stories with portion and attitude problems at other places when ordering from the RW menu, and it was definitely not an issue here.This meal was a bit expensive and not something we do on a weekly basis, but definitely nice for a special event for/during restaurant week.",2,2,0,Mindy L.,"Brooklyn, NY",114,10,31

We ordered a nice bottle of wine to go with our meal.For appetizers we both ordered the burrata, which was delicious. The melon, tomato and pickled onions all went great together.  After we were done with our appetizers and waiting for our steaks, they brought out a second set of burrata, which was confusing since we had already gotten it.For our main, we both ordered the petite filet, which was cooked very well and seasoned nicely.  We shared a side of mashed potatoes, which were very tasty.For dessert, the restaurant week didn't offer any gluten free options, so my boyfriend was able to get sorbet.I chose the cheesecake, which was very fluffy and tasted awesome.Overall, the restaurant week prices were good, and the portion sizes were enough for me.",2,1,1,Elyka A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",198,204,634

Was a bit tasteless. Then I got the filet minon which was very tough to cut through. Had some veins but since it was medium rare that made up for some of it quality. Finally I had to get their famous baked Alaska. It tasted foamy as it's all covered in whipped cream with some walnut cake and miscellaneous fruits inside. The flavor was interesting , the presentation was beautiful, however, the flavor and texture was a mix bag of mystery. I think it has too many different kinds of texture and flavor for a dessert and our team couldn't put out tongue on what's the most prominent taste of it.. overall, the three course meal was just mediocre ...but is def an experience!",2,0,0,Jay H.,"New York, NY",76,206,122

5.0,8/7/2017,"It's as good as it gets when it comes to classy and a throw back to a bygone era. I had the the Delmonico Double Cheese Burger with french fries and the 3 course restaurant week meal. We went to the bar and grill side, it was a last minute thought this past Friday night, 8/4. The burger was a home run, cooked the way they chose which is rare, and it was stacked with cheddar, onion, ranhoffer sauce and love!! Big and beautiful as a burger goes...They probably had the same meat purveyors since they had opened! The rest. week portion for the better half was a lobster newberg, a bit salty but still really good, followed by a petite filet mignon, and the dessert which made them even more famous was their Baked Alaska. You cannot get a Baked Alaska as good as you can at Delmonico's...That is a fact - if you want to try one, this is the place to do it.It is the true classic of American Steakhouses from a gilded era and still is the best, with a very attentive and knowledgable staff. 100% recommend it and if anyone is inviting me, I would always say a big yes!!!",0,1,1,Brian G.,"Brooklyn, NY",34,43,42
4.0,8/6/2017,"My son & I have been doing NYC Restaurant Week (Summer & Winter) for the last couple of years. We always have a great time. This year we chose Delmonico's. We were early for our 7pm reservation, but they were willing to seat us right away. However, the hostess led us down to the basement! When I asked why we were not being seated in the main dining room, she told me there were no tables available. I insisted that we wanted to be upstairs & said we'd wait. Back at the front desk, she told us to have a seat, it would be a while. She was back before we even sat down & led us the first table in the dining room, just inside of the reception area. My son, who is 21 years old, did not think it a big deal to be relegated to the basement but did note that the restaurant was basically empty. It really bothered me, being treated like we were unworthy!The food: My son ordered the naked ravioli, petite filet mignon & a glass of wine. He loved the ravioli & enjoyed the filet. He cleaned his plate, literally, with a piece of bread dipped in butter. I chose the burrata salad & Delmonico steak (+ $18.) My salad was good, though I thought it was a bit skimpy & not something I couldn't have pulled off myself. The Delmonico steak.... it was a very generous size & oh my, it was soooo good! Even with the boy's assistance, I took half of it home. Dessert: My son got the cheesecake, rather small & just ok. The baked Alaska (+ $6) was lovely (although they didn't flambé it) & delicious.Also, the waiter took a beautiful photo of the two of us.

4.0,8/6/2017,"We came here for summer Restaurant Week 2017, and it definitely did not disappoint. First off, the ambiance of this place is old world classic. The hostesses look very out of place in their belly-baring tops and miniskirts, but the waitstaff look clean and professional in white dress shirts and black vests.We were seated in the lower level, which was less opulent than the first floor dining room, but still beautiful and in keeping with the overall decor and theme of the restaurant.Service was really great except one waiter who was a little curt, but nothing glaring. Our main waiter was very friendly and professional.The RW menu is a bit limited, but there are options to upgrade to better dishes at a supplement charge. For starters, we had the naked ravioli (3 stars--2 tiny pieces of ravioli with an average ricotta filling but yummy mushroom sauce) and lobster Newberg ($15 supplement, 4 stars--super tender young lobster tail and claws in a to-die-for creamy sauce, but there was no caviar as listed on the menu). Entrees were the petit filet mignon (4 stars--tender, well-seasoned, and also came with a delicious steak sauce) and the classic steak ($18 supplement, 4 stars--also very tender and well-seasoned). And finally, our desserts were the baked Alaska ($6 supplement, 3 stars--the toasted merengue was nice, but the banana ice cream was too frozen and crystallized) and the chocolate mousse cake (4 stars--fluffy and very chocolatey). We also had a bottle of their special RW red wine ($38), which was great with all the red meat.Overall, great experience, great food!",2,0,1,Juliana T.,"Manhattan, NY",220,265,553
2.0,8/6/2017,"This review is based on a recent visit (August 2017) and not past experiences. My past Delmonico's experiences have been outstanding, but my most recent very disappointing. Arrived for lunch on time and had to wait a bit for our table, no big deal because the restaurant was clearly busy. I suspect business had to do with Restaurant Week promotion. We were seated in the room behind the bar. Our server, Marina, was cordial but midway through her greeting us the hostess interrupted to remind her to get the couple at another table to finish up. Marina took our orders but never asked if we wanted drinks other than water. I ordered a martini and placed my lunch order. In the interim, the hostess returned to the dining room to remind yet another server to move the patrons at his table along. All quite audible. My martini arrived and seconds behind it, the first course. At a restaurant of Delmonico's caliber you expect to have time to enjoy your drink before your food arrives. I was surprised at this But the reason was evident, the hostess was back again to keep serving staff on top of moving people out when they were finished -- back again and breathlessly audible. My wife and I finished our next two courses, all delicious. With the last spoonful of dessert the server brought our check. We were never asked if we'd like coffee or anything else. The Delmonico's experience should not be similar to what you encounter at the neighborhood dinner. I appreciate the fact that they were busy but that is no reason to be hurried through a meal or catch the near-hysterical vibe of a harried hostess. If I want a special lunch, with all that a remarkable meal should offer, I will go somewhere else. Sad.",0,0,0,Craig Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",49,17,3

That was not what I expected of a restaurant of this caliber and long years of experience.When seated, it seemed there was a confusion on who was going to be serving us, took a while for them to serve us bread and butter to start with. We opted for the restaurant week pre fix menu. Ordered the poke tuna and lobster for appetizers. Both were delicious (both had a surcharge on top of the pre fix $$). For entree we had the filet mignon and Delmonico steak. I really preferred the taste and tenderness of the filet mignon much more than the steak. The side of broccoli was a bit overdone for my taste. Ordered the baked Alaska and the chocolate mousse for dessert, really enjoyed the chocolate mousse cake. It was silky and rich.

I love a good med-rare steak and the potatoes served with it were excellent! Definitely worth the supplement charge to the RW menu.Desert: We shared a baked alaska (which they allegedly invented) and the chocolate cake. Both desserts were very good. I had never had baked alaska, it always struck me as an old person's dessert, but it was so delicious. It's a shame that they don't light it on fire like I've seen on cruise ships. However, i get it, that would be annoying to do on a nightly basis.The service was very friendly. We had this Russian/eastern Euro guy who was super nice.

The service was much more lax and it took them a good while to figure out I wanted the check. The nice sounding bartender seemed to offer someone a taste of a beer before buying which is nice. The burger with foie butter was excellent and quite rich. It was 32 including the foie but it was worth it.

You're treated like royalty by the incredible waitstaff--there are no assumptions about how much money you have and they treat you the same whether you have saved up all year for one dinner or have thousand dollar bills in your wallet, which really means a lot (and is more than I can say for other places!)The food is absolutely *spectacular.* I had the bone in-rib eye, and it was one of the best things I have ever eaten. Forget Peter Luger's, Delmonico's has the best steaks in NYC. They were cooked absolutely perfectly, and there is no need to cover them with sauce (though the Delmonico's steak sauce they serve on the side is very good!), they are perfect the way they come out. The mashed potatoes are also very good (and worth it), and my boyfriend swears that the $20 crab macaroni and cheese is spectacular (I don't eat crab and even I found it delicious!). He has had both the Delmonico's Steak and the lobster, and still raves about them.Definitely get a Baked Alaska; they were invented here and are also amazing!The service is something I cannot praise enough. Our waiter was incredibly attentive without bothering us; it was as if our wine glasses just magically refilled with the bottle, and we could have talked for hours without anyone bothering us, but if you were finished eating or needed something, it was like they could sense it! No waiting for the check, no trying to catch someone's eye, no waving anyone down. It was perfect.This is the best place in NYC for a special, romantic dinner.

3.0,6/12/2017,"KenScale: 7.5/10Not many restaurants can stake a claim that it has existed since the early part of 19th century. Delmonico's, which first opened in 1837 before going through different owners and locations, has been an iconic restaurant in New York's dining scene. Before Peter Luger and Wolfgang's of the world, it has stood out as one of the go-to steakhouses. When a friend of Jun visited recently, I suggested we try this place since it was closer to where we lived and I realized I had never thought to check it out before. So was the old-school classic as good as the other newer signature steakhouses in the city? I wish I could say yes because the way Delmonico's prepares steaks was somewhat off my personal preferences.Everyone has different expectations when it comes to a steak. Some, including someone famous (or infamous, I might say) at the top of the White House prefers a well-done steak with ketchup (!). For me, texture of a meat comes first and foremost (I really can't go a meat cooked more than medium, and medium rare is usually the way to go); the next most important factor is the seasoning. Depending on how much salt you put into a steak, it could make a very big difference in the texture. I often find, to my great frustration, that kitchens at steakhouses seem to think adding as much salt as you can as if your dining guests are all very low on sodium in their body is a good idea. Delmonico's was no exception in this regard. After some serviceable appetizers of shrimp cocktail and wedge salad, I was looking forward to the boneless rib eye that arrived in front of me. The meat which I ordered medium rare came out closer to medium (still the meat came out juicy and tender), but the biggest issue was the seasoning. I had to keep wondering why the kitchen needed to put this much salt. Usually I finish an entire steak by myself (and I came to the restaurant pretty hungry after a very light lunch), but I had to put down my fork and knife after two-thirds of the way. I also stole some pieces of filet mignon from Jun; her meat was a lot more moderate in seasoning (and I liked the texture of the meat slightly more than the rib eye), but it could still use a tad less salt. The sides that we had (spinach, macaroni and cheese and mushrooms) were mostly OK but not particularly memorable, either.Getting a reservation at Delmonico's was pretty manageable, although the classic dining room was quickly packed with people (a good mix of tourists and working crowd from FiDi area) during the course of our meal. There is a full bar with some potent cocktails and an extensive wine list to complement your meal. Sure, Delmonico's is an old-school classic that deserves recognition for setting the stone for storied history of New York City dining, but that doesn't mean that the food here is as good as you think it is or should be. Perhaps a reckoning that a steak doesn't have to put in a ton of seasoning would be a great start to bringing this place forward to the modern era of dining?",3,1,3,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738

She came along with her VP and National sales director. Now we did not know we were going to Delmonico, so I did state I was dressed rather casually as I was walking in. With that said I always wear a hat be it a flat cap, as on this day or Fedora. We were led to the table, and as I was in mid sentence, and even before I made the motion to sit down the hostess had the nerve to instruct me Infront of everyone to be sure to remove my hat at the table. I responded that I was raised properly, and had no intention of not doing it as I sat down, and that I didn't appreciate being told. Normally I check my hat but I was never offered that option. Even after being told she never offered to take my hat so I placed it under my chair which is far from appealing either. My table mates were astonished by her lack of tact, I was needlessly embarrassed for an infraction of manners I had no intention of doing in the first place.

3.0,5/24/2017,"I was really excited about going to Delmonico's and for the most part, the food did not disappoint. We started with two martinis, the lettuce wedge with blue cheese, and the dressed crab, all were delicious.  We had the tomahawk steak for two, $140, with onion rings, whipped potatoes and creamed spinach. The onion rings were okay, the steak was perfect as were the creamed spinach and whipped potatoes.  I had a great glass of Pinot with dinner followed by a shared blueberry pie and two cappuccinos. The pie was underwhelming but the cappuccinos were great. Total before tip was $330.  Now the disappointing part ... the service.  The wait staff was too busy chatting with each other to offer pepper for my salad even after repeatedly asking for help.  The hostess has way too much attitude. Overall it just felt sloppy and amateurish for a fine dining experience.  I would give them a 4 for the food but a 3 for the service is a stretch.   Overall a 3.  Glad we went but for the price there are many better options in Manhattan.",2,1,0,Mark W.,"San Francisco, CA",0,95,11

3.0,5/11/2017,"More like a 3.5 but rounded down to 3 because of the amateur mistakes Delmonico's is making.We came with a reservation late Friday evening.  While we were waiting for the party to arrive, we grabbed drinks at the bar, which was fun and bustling.Once the rest of our party arrived, we were seated immediately.  The restaurant has a very dimly lit ambience -- definitely very intimate and high class. Everything on the menu looked great.  Choosing between the lobster newberg and the filet, I ended up settling for the filet, since we were at a steakhouse of course.  My friends also for the filet and Delmonico steak.  We got the bearnaise sauce to share.  We split three sides: roasted vegetables, delmonico potatoes, and fries.  Our waiter was very open and transparent with us about the portion of the sauce and sides.Filet mignon - This was the best steak I've had in my life.  It was extremely tender and flavorful (don't let anyone tell you filet mignons are not!).  One qualm I did have with it, though, was that I ordered it medium-rare and got a something definitely very rare.  I read other reviews of their steaks being undercooked, so maybe overestimate how you would like your steak cooked? The filet also came with some leafy greens, which was nice with the heavy meal we were having.Delmonico steak - This steak was pretty disappointing.  I tried a bit from of my friends, but much preferred the filet mignon.  It was very fatty and sinewy--totally the opposite of my butter filet.  My friend actually ended up cutting away 1/4 of his steak because it was too gristle-y and fatty for him.  I guess if you like that stuff you should get the Delmonico steak, but if you like a very clean and tender steak, get the filet.Bearnaise sauce - very buttery, rich, and delicious.  The consistency was weird, though, in that it wasn't pourable and more like a spread (think mayonnaise..).  So I had to spread it onto my steak...Sides - We got 3 for 5 people, but probably could've gotten one more.  Delmonico potatoes were very tasty and I've had nothing like it before (mini potatoes baked in a cheesy cream sauce).  The roasted carrots also were very pretty as they were purple, red, and orange :)DESSERT - although we were full, we HAD to try baked Alaska, as it originated here.  It was AMAZING.  The outside meringue was super creamy, but also light.  The ice cream and cake provided a nice contrast too.  Definitely would get one of these if you're here.Service was bizarre.  In the middle of our meal, our waiter announced that his shift was over and the sommelier would be taking our table over.  Not a huge problem, but just bizarre.  Also one of the table runners tried our baked Alaska clearly before we were done.  Felt like we were being rushed.Overall the experience felt very classy, fancy, and historic, so I was pleased with the experience, just disappointed in the amateur mistakes like undercooking the steak and odd service.  Probably wouldn't come back because there are better steakhouses at better prices, but Delmonico's should be on the NYC bucket list for anyone who is excited about fine dining and historic food.",6,2,2,Michelle W.,"Santa Monica, CA",747,161,192

They were standing in front gossiping with one another and on their cell phones. They wanted to seat us at a table that was in the walkway of the waiters. We asked if we can be sat at a different table. They told us that they can't put us at a four person table (we had three people). I said that there are multiple tables open and there are two other four person tables that have two people sitting there. Finally they allowed us to switch to another table. Our waiter, Alexander, was amazing. He was very knowledgeable. His recommendations were spot on! The food was good as well. We ordered shrimp cocktail and a cocktail mix. The seafood did not seem very fresh. Maybe it wasn't the season but we've had better even recently. For dinner my fiancee had the signature delmonico's steak, I had the filet mignon, and his father had the new york strip. The steaks were very tasty. Their signature steak was clearly the best of the three. Very, very rich in flavor. The sides were amazing. The Delmonico's potatoes were delicious and the broccoli rabe mix was amazing.

5.0,4/19/2017,"This is history. Culinary history. The Lobster Newburg is better than I have had anywhere in Boston. It's a 2 pound lobster with just enough Newburg sauce. It's not swimming in sauce, because lobster is delightful on its own, why hide the flavor? It also comes with potatoes and spinach. A very filling meal. The greatest take-away is that the lobster was cooked perfectly. Even in Boston, I find it overcooked way too often, and it's tough. STEAK! I feel fortunate enough to have dined with people who share their food. Our table got the signature Delmonico steak, and the 45 day dry aged Delmonico steak. So we all got to realize perfection in tasting dry aged vs wet aged. They were both excellent. The wet aged is juicier, but my choice will always be the dry aged. I felt it had more meatiness and they do a perfect char around the entire steak that I have never seen. Not burnt, but a flavorful char. Once you get towards the bone, it's like beef bacon!! But, if you are on a date or a business meal, get the regular Delmonico steak. It will be great, boneless, and you won't have the urge to get all Fred Flintstone and pick up the bone and gnaw on it for all the deliciousness that it has to offer.Oh, and how can I forget? For appetizers, we got the Cheek and Bone and then we passed around the rather perfect Eggs Benedict. I keep using the word perfect here, but that's what these dishes were. THE EGGS BENEDICT WERE PERFECT with orange roe on top. The sauce, the egg yolks, the smoked meat, -it was everything I needed it to be! The Cheek and Bone was in itself a moment to remember. I cannot begin to tell you how much flavor was in the bone marrow and crispy bits. And how tender and tasty the cheek meat was. I always contend that facial meat is the most underutilized meat on any animal. So good!The Baked Alaska is devine. I understand the gelato in the Baked Alaska is made on the premises. We also had the blueberry pie à la mode. More of a tart with a struesel topping, but well accomplished. The winner on the dessert menu by far, hands down is the crème brulée. I am normally quite tired of crème brulée on every menu, HOWEVER, this isn't like any crème brulée I have ever had or made. It is closer to a Panna Cotta with the carmelized sugar on top. So creamy, so smooth, and it is served out of the dish. Again, reminds me of Panna Cotta, but much better with a couple other components to the dessert.This place is old school.

The oysters I'm a bit neutral with as they are not something I eat often, but they were good. I have no complaints about it. The tartar was absolutely amazing.

It was fairly packed but that caused no issues or delays in service. We got a brief history lesson and some minutiae details about Delmonico's. We ended our night with the Baked Alaska.

5.0,4/10/2017,"I'm surprised by the overall rating of this place.  My husband and I went all out having eaten at some pretty nice places with our two boys.  We ate here our last evening in NY and really enjoyed it.  The servers were all very attentive and the portions were very generous.  I had eaten seafood, lamb and chicken therefore having consumed most of the proteins out there (with the exception of red meat given the red meat guilt that I feel every time I eat it!) and decided to go with the chicken dish again.  YUMMY.  It was so incredibly tender despite it being both white AND dark meat.  The brussel sprouts was yummy with just the right amount of balsamic vinegar caramelized.  The asparagus and mushroom dish was also delicious too.  My husband ordered the filet and my boys both ordered the signature ribeye steaks.  All very good, according to them.  Besides the food and servers, however, what I really enjoyed was the history of the place.  We asked questions about the sitting presidents who had visited the place as well as the dishes that had originated in Delmonico's.  I really wish we had the room to eat the Baked Alaska especially knowing that it was created at this restaurant after the purchase of Alaska.  And I liked the feel of the people coming in to eat.  It wasn't the hipster NYC (dressed all in black) crowd.  It was business guys and families.  I'd be back again.  I hope that this place stays in business for a long time.",0,0,0,Shirley V.,"Yorba Linda, CA",1,149,0

We sat in a cute little corner booth in the back, which made for easy people watching. For an expensive place, the dress code gets pushed by some of its patrons - I saw one man wearing khaki shorts.We started with the special salad of the day, which was a caprese, probably one of the better ones we've had.

4.0,2/9/2017,"This is a review of Restaurant Week Dinner.When you think of real, classic restaurant of all time in the US, Delmonico's should come to your thoughts. It is THE first fine dining restaurant in the country, opened in 1837. This is where the Delmonico Steak, Eggs Benedict, Balked Alaska, Chicken A la Keene, and Lobster Newburg were created. Yes, they are the original of all originals!The main dining room was much larger than I expected, with antique style chandeliers, classic wall papers that extended from the front foyer, and large paining on the back wall. The painting depicted well-dressed patrons at a fancy restaurant,I assume it was a painting of Delcmonico's? It is the perfect painting to be in this room, it sort of creates a window into how this dining room used to look like, once upon a time. This room had nice lively energy, a bit noisy but matching the hustle of bustle of the city.Through the bar next to the main dining room was another dining room, smaller, more private and quiet. This is a much better setting for business dinner, date, or anyone who wants to have a little less noise. This dining room was a bit more dimmed with softer lights and candles at each table. Out of the Restaurant Week menu, we had Buffalo Mozzarella & Yellow Beefsteak Tomato, Lobster Bisque, Short Ribs, Petit Filet Mignon, Baked Alaska ($6 extra supplement), and Dark Chocolate Mousse Cake. The steak was really great, melt in my mouth great. Everything else were really tasty as well, no complaints at all. Our waitress, Marina was very nice, courteous and polite. She was very friendly only if the customers wanted her to be, and quiet when the customers wanted to dine in silence. Either way she always kept a smile on her face, and very efficient and professional with her work. We were well taken care of by Marina and by other staffs.

4.0,1/29/2017,"Every year around the holidays, a good friend of mine and business associate have made it a habit of ""celebrating"" the end of another year...in the black...Capitalism Rules, etc etc.It's always about good steak and good drinks. This time it was time to try (the original) Delmonico's at the southern tip on Manhattan. I say original because they also have a newer Delmonico's Kitchen Midtown near MSG.  So we grabbed our Red Cups of Scotch and jumped in an Uber.First off, I will NEVER give a steak house 5 Stars. My reasoning is that although you may have an amazing meal....it's still a beef focused menu. The kitchen's creativity is going to be clipped about how far they can go (as opposed to Cafe Matisse in Rutherford NJ  or a Viaggio in Wayne NJ)....I mean how many freakin times do I have to see creamed spinach, garlic mash, frizzled onions on menu?!?...Honestly, if you practice a bit with your grill or oven, and use a GOOD piece of (aged)  meat  from a good butcher or market, I'm sure you too can make a slab of heaven on a plate....That being said, I give Del's 4 stars for it's excellent food, excellent service and atmosphere, and it's contribution to the restaurant world. (and I love the history of this place!)Delmonico's is the first food establishment to actually be called a"" restaurant"".first to use table clothes....almost every U.S. president since Abe Lincoln(!) has eaten here.It's chefs have created the infamous ""Delmonico steak"" (a certain aged cut of ribeye) you see all over. They've created Eggs Benedict,  Lobster Newburg, Chicken A la Keene and the dessert Baked Alaska (more on that later)Of course it has a great selection of spirits and over 1,000 bottles of good wine.THE FOOD:started off with : The Cheek & Bone which is Snake River Farm Beef Cheek, Crispy Bone Marrow, Butternut Squash... Absolutely delicious. Bone marrow is an old European ""peasant"" dish as I like to call it.. HUGE flavor albeit a high fat content. This was good, although not a lot of marrow in the bone. The beef cheek was great.Dayboat Sea Scallops  with Cauliflower, Beets, Frog Hollow Farm Pears was prepared as good as scallops can get. The pears add a nice light sweetness that I've never really had with this bivalve.Entrees were the Delmonico Steak (when in Rome.....) topped with foie gras (oof and Bully for me) and a 28 day dry aged T-Bone steak Oscar (Oscar style being topped with a Tarragon Hollandaise sauce and asparagus. (yeah, we skipped lunch that day....lol)The steaks were excellent as is expected in an institution like this (and about 5 others in NYC)So what more can I say other than ""it is what it is"".......Only waste of time was the Crispy Ale-Battered Onion Rings with Buttermilk Blue Cheese Dressing....which reminded a lot like ""store bought (y'know perfectly round & ""bread-crumby"". The dressing was flat and had little flavor.. and at $19 for approx 10 onion rings....forget it !!Of course we had to push it and get dessert. I've always heard of Baked Alaska, but never tried it because I am not too fond of meringue. A dessert created in 1867 in celebration of the purchase of Alaska from Russia (isn't being a Foodie educational!)Their version of this dish is made of banana ice cream placed in a pie dish lined with slices of sponge cake,with a thin layer of apricot compote and topped with meringue. The entire dessert is then placed in an extremely hot oven for a brief time, long enough to firm and caramelize the meringue. The meringue is an effective thermal insulator, and the short cooking time prevents the heat from getting through to the ice cream and melting it. It's a blend of warm and cold with such various, delicious flavors. One of my most favorite desserts of all time. But be warned, most restaurants that make this dish change it around a bit.All in all a great meal. Delmonico's delivers what is expected. Treat yourself on a special occasion.

5.0,1/14/2017,"I cannot believe it has taken me this long to write this review. I came back in September for my mother's birthday and it left our whole party stunned. Delmonico's is one of the oldest restaurants in NYC and when you walk in you feel transported back into the early 1900s. You can feel the history there. As a steakhouse Delmonico's is one of my favorites. They are basic steakhouse no fancy extras. But they themselves are very fancy. For appetizers we had selections from the raw bar, tuna tartar and lobster bisque. All phenomenal!!For dinner we all ordered steaks and the few sauces that Delmonico's has which I sampled and were all amazing. For sides we had creamed spinach, French fries, and bacon. Yes, you read that correct, BACON. The best damn bacon I have ever had in my almost 27 years on this earth.Lastly for dessert, we had one of everything on the dessert menu. The famous baked Alaska I was not a fan of and neither was anyone in my party. However we did love the apple blueberry mini pie. If you go to Delmonico's after reading this review please please please get the bacon. You can thank me later.",3,1,1,Fina R.,"Ozone Park, Queens, NY",151,152,216

5.0,1/9/2017,"This place is a classic New York steak house. The decoration calls from an era that was before our time, but very interesting to sit and take in all the details of the restaurant. The staff was top notch. So professional and traditional in their white glove service. The steaks were absolutely to die for. They will definitely cook it the way that they see fit, so if you like yours cooked a little bit well done you might need to send it back to be cooked more even if you ask for it medium or medium/well. The prices are definitely for the rich or for special occasions only, but definitely well worth the experience.",1,1,1,Jo W.,"Ardsley, NY",1,297,35
5.0,1/4/2017,"We were invited out to dinner for New Years Eve with friends who had an Open Table gift card. They chose Delmonico's for dinner. I am not a steak eater I usually have a steak once or twice a year and usually at my favorite Tex-Mex joint that happens to make a really good steak. Until now. Let me tell you about our Delmonico's experience.I wasn't sure about Delmonico's after reading a lot of one and two star reviews on Yelp. I also read a lot of 4 and 5 star reviews. Well let me say Delmonico's is 5 star all the way. The evening started on a positive note when we found a parking spot directly across the street. Parking in Delmonico's area is not easy, we factored in time for parking and we arrived a half hour early for our reservation after we parked the car. The hostess at the front desk was very accommodating and our early arrival was not an issue. We were immediately seated after checking our coats.When you first sit down you are greeted with a very formal place setting that is removed as soon as you place your order. We think this may be the original dinnerware that they only use for this purpose. We ordered a bottle of wine some appetizers and our mains.The cheapest wine on the menu was amazingly good. My wife and I shared a Cesar salad. This is the first time I was served an authentic Cesar salad it had a poached egg on top and real anchovies, delicious. My friends wife had ordered a lobster bisque from the daily specials, I got a taste and it too was very good well seasoned with a nice lobster flavor.My wife and I ordered the NY strip, my friend's wife had the steak Delmonico and he had the double cut wild boar chop with spinach and roasted potatoes. For side dishes we ordered mashed potatoes and the bacon cranberry Brussels sprouts for the table.Like I originally stated I am not a steak eater but the NY strip I was served was probably the best piece of meat I have ever eaten. Cooked medium rare it was juicy and packed with flavor. My friend said his wild boar chops were very good and he liked the fact the the potatoes were under the spinach to stay warm. His wife's steak was proclaimed to be very good. We ended up taking a good portion of the steaks home with us.We were all stuffed from our dinner and we were debating getting dessert, but I had to try a baked Alaska so we ordered one for the table. It was oh my god amazing. Walnut Cake, Apricot Jam, Banana Gelato and Meringue equals one very tasty way to end your meal. I don't know how any one could eat it by themselves.All in all our Delmonico's experience was 5 star all the way. The staff was polite and attentive and seemed to anticipate what our table needed before we had to ask. Old school charm all the way. If I could afford it I'd eat there all the time.",6,0,1,Alan A.,"Queens, NY",136,344,2138
2.0,12/30/2016,Paid $65 for a steak that tastes like Outback Steakhouse. The waiter was not attentive to us as he was with the other tables. I may not look like I make a decent amount of money but I can assure you that I do and the way we were treated is not the way I would expect from an establishment like this.

2.0,12/30/2016,"GOOD CUISINE, BAD EXPERIENCE! I was a guest at your restaurant on this Christmas Eve with my boyfriend. I am not usually one to complain but I was very unhappy with my experience at Delmonicos on Christmas Eve and to be honest I don't know if I will return.  Please bare with while I explain my experience. I was so excited to dine at Delmonicos on Christmas Eve because my boyfriend insisted your restaurant was a must, from the food to the environment and decor. This was my first time dining here. So we made an 830 reservation and arrived on time. We were seated in the back room, which I was rather unhappy about, but considering it was the holidays I understood how busy you must have been. (I am a waitress myself, so I understand how stressful the restaurant business is during the holidays) So we sat down and began to read the menu. Our waiter was excellent however the people we were seated next to were over-the-top obnoxious. From the second my boyfriend and I sat down they would not stop talking to us, they keep caressing my boyfriend and my arms and the women at her table even attempted to touch my scallop appetizer. She was screaming and being belligerent because they were intoxicated. I like to drink as well, but I don't invade other people's personal space. My boyfriend and I tried to be as polite as possible considering it was Christmas Eve but the man at the table saw we were getting annoyed so I thought they would stop. They continued to annoy us and ultimately ruined our Christmas Eve dinner. The women went on and on and on about how you should have had mint jelly for her lamb chops. Then after her mint jelly scene, she takes out chewing Tobacco (aka, dip) and it goes flying into their table and my boyfriend and I's table. I was mortified. I asked the woman if she could please refrain from ""dipping"" in this elegant restaurant and she started to say how New Yorkers judge her for dipping. They informed us they were from Minnesota. I was not judging her, just embarrassed to be seated next to them. Everyone in the back room was staring at them and not a single worker approached them and asked them to please be respectful of others. The mother and son finally get up to leave and they stole the black pepper grinder from our table on the way out.I was expecting someone that worked at the restaurant to approach us and say something. Not a single thing was said, I thought we would be offered dessert or something for the inconvenience we experienced on the holiday.  Even the other patrons at the restaurant applauded when those obnoxious people left. This is was first experience at Delmonico's and to be honest I don't know if I will return. I really enjoyed the food but I do not want to be subjected to an environment where people can chew tobacco at the table and invade my personal space by touched me and my food.  I would have said something to management on Christmas Eve but to be honest I didn't want to ruin anyone else's holiday since my holiday was pretty much ruined. I wanted to bring this to your attention because it's not right for guests to spend $200+ on dinner and be harassed the whole meal.",1,0,0,Jamie C.,"Amityville, NY",0,13,0

The food is mediocre at best, however the environment and just being there is worth it. My filet mignon was okay but not like butter where I could cut right through the meat. The string beans were also slightly undercooked in my opinion. This is possibly attributable to large party size.Despite the above, the drinks were great and the staff was attentive! The place is definitely super cool inside so if you don't feel like spending money on steak at the very least have a drink at the bar (which gives you an excuse to look around).",3,1,1,Nicole A.,"White Plains, NY",222,258,244
3.0,12/3/2016,"Went here on a rainy Tuesday night in late November for a dinner and first impression was not great. Walked in and was asked if I had a reservation, said yes and gave my name then was ignored as a party came in about a minute after us. They were promptly escorted but I had to go back to the hostess and give my name again before being seated...This place is VERY old school--from the decor, the menu, and the guests--so bear that in mind if you are considering steakhouse options. Our table service, however, was impeccable, timely, and friendly. We began with cocktails and moved onto an amazing Argentinian wine which for me was the highlight of the night--the food, while good, left a lot to be desired given the pricing and reputation of this place. Some of our side dishes were bland and presentation could have been better but all around food was good.Would I come here again? Sure, if someone invites me and is paying but I think I'd rather try another steakhouse before coming back.  They have a bar tucked away behind the main dining room, which I'd try by myself as it seemed a bit more modern and inviting, so maybe another time!",3,0,0,Roxana F.,"New York, NY",69,214,23

4.0,11/17/2016,"A little bit of old world NY still lives here. This is one of the oldest, if not THE oldest steakhouse in NY.  The entrance harks back to another era and seems as if time stood still looking at this place from the outside.  Inside is nicely appointed and somewhat ornate.  All the staff were well trained and attentive.  I came here with some VIP clients on a weekday evening so expect to see a business crowd and a lot of suits mixed in since its not too far from Wall St.I ordered the Steak Delmonico, their signature steak which is their iteration of a boneless ribeye.  It was salty but not overly so which I thought was prepared well.  The marbled fat seemingly melted in your mouth and really stood out.  The atmosphere was reserved and upscale (or at least they try to portray it as such) which worked well because I was here for a business meeting.  If you have been to other steakhouses in NYC, I'm sure you are well aware that the noise levels are out of control in some places where you have to shout at each other to get a word in.   True, this place cannot compete with some of the better steakhouses such as Luger's, Benjamin's or Wolfgangs but I don't think you will have a bad time at this place depending on your goals here.  I liked it.  My clients liked it.  No complaints and I would gladly entertain here again.",1,2,0,Ray L.,"Manhattan, NY",59,103,82

4.0,9/28/2016,"Delmonico's is an institution in the financial district.  It has a beautiful old-world steakhouse vibe with it's lacquered woodwork and it's crisp white linens.  The entrance I came in takes you into the bar/cafe (which is suppose to be the cheaper section to eat in).  Bar is large and square shaped sitting in the middle of the room.  Past that are two separate dining rooms, one is about the same size as the room with the bar, and the other is a large dining room.  We ate at a table near the bar.We ordered calamari, chips with guacamole and an entree.  Appetizers were really tasty.  Calamari was cooked perfectly, seasoned nicely and had a nice chipotle mayo dipping sauce.  Chips and guac were what you would expect, good, but nothing spectacular.  For my lunch I had a burger which was delicious.  Cooked and seasoned to perfection I literally have no complaints on the food.  Service was great, exactly what you would expect for Delmonico's, the biggest issue I have is with the price.  Delmonico's is extremely expensive so I never go out of my way to go there, but they are catering to a specific audience and I understand that.  Only other complaint I have is that the menu is pretty dated.  We are living in the golden age of food so although customers expect the food to taste amazing (and it should for what they charge) we are also tired of seeing the same old menu and want new and exciting food to try.",2,0,0,Sara W.,"East Rutherford, NJ",89,222,272
2.0,9/14/2016,"I have a lot of up and down opinions on this place but unfortunately the downs won. In regards to the restaurant, it is quite large with a beautiful, old American steakhouse vibe in relation to the initial entrance of the restaurant. We were seated deeper into the restaurant, past the bar in what seemed to be annex from the main, slightly more plain compared to the initial look of the restaurant.We were a group of 5 and overall, the food was meh compared to other steakhouses I have tried. We started off with the bacon and although the portion size was adequate, the cuts given were a mismatch. I got a piece just of pure fat that never should have made it on the plate. Flavoring was there but became a let down with the overwhelming fat. Then the sides and main entrée came. We shared the asparagus, hash browns and mushrooms. Sides were good and enough to share between 5 people. They were on par with expectations so that was nice. For my main entrée, I shared the Porterhouse for two, asking for medium rare. We unfortunately got rare. Like super rare. I like bloody red meat but when I request for medium rare at a respected steakhouse, I want to see what I ordered. It was so rare I almost couldn't swallow but had to consider the amount of money I was shelling out. The filet was buttery and soft and the strip had good flavor. Unfortunately, the execution was not there and coupled with my bacon mishap, I was not pleased. Combine the bad service and the whole dinner experience became a flat two stars. Our service was so slow and we were constantly trying to flag them down to reorder wine bottles and request for more iced water. I almost wanted to just ask them to leave the pitcher of water at the rate we were getting refills. There was no attention paid to us and it took forever just to get their attention to ask for the check.  With the painstakingly poor service and food just being average (below average compared to other expensive steakhouses I have had), I was quite disappointed with this experience.",12,2,5,Michelle L.,"New York, NY",888,585,2091

However, as a party, we all loved it. Thick cut bacon. Can't go wrong. Delmonico steak - like mentioned above, my favorite rib eye I've had. The seasoning was not too strong but was nice and crispy. The size was good and I was stuffed at the end.Side dishes (broccoli rabe, mash potatoes, and king crab macaroni and cheese) - wasn't impressed. Just your basic steakhouse sides (even the king crab Mac and cheese). Cheesecake - absolutely delicious. I hesitated to order because I was so full from the steak but I did it anyways. I took it down in 4 bites and it wasn't small. Would recommend. I had a piece of the classic baked Alaska which supposedly originated at Delmonicos from what our waiter said. Very good.

I would give 4, if my vegetable that accompany the filet were more tasty. I guess I would expect more. The restaurant is an overall incredible experience. You feel you jump back in time, and the service was really nice, but super fast. As soon a I was putting down my fork they pick up plates, and made the all dinner a run. We had the three course menu, with choices of appetizers, main meal, and dessert. We drunk two bottles of the suggested red Montalcino wine, which was really good. On the the highlight of the dinner. My crab cake was delicious, as well as my filet mignon. I wasn't a big fun of the broccoli next to it, and the roasted potatoes were just 5 small pieces. As desert I got their famous chocolate mousse, which was tasty, but really heavy.

5.0,8/13/2016,"What an amazing experience! You truly see why this restaurant has stayed so popular for so long. We of course ordered the Delmonico's steak and it was cooked to perfection, our son does not even like steak and ate almost half of mine. The baked Alaska was impressive as well as everything else we ordered for dinner. It also has an extensive wine selection for any palate and budget. Our son wasn't too fond of the menu selection (most 8yo aren't fans of Lobster Newberg or Bacon & Octopus) so the General Manager Corrado  and our waiter Ego were so accommodating to his special order of cheese fries ;). We met another waiter, Johnny whose cousin Bruno (he used to work at Delmonico's but moved) and opened up a restaurant in Raleigh, Bruno's, where we live.

The appetizer was a lobster pasta dish followed by a petit fillet and wrapped up with the NY cheesecake.  The wine was a montalcino.   The pasta was tasty and had generous portions of lobster.  The steak was cooked perfectly with a little sauce but not overpowering along with broccoli and fingerling potatoes.  Good experience and good service.  Will be back.",1,0,0,Marios D.,"Manhattan, NY",196,509,822

However, I ordered the petit filet mignon option and was confused by the sides. The beautifully cooked rare steak was accompanied by a simple picnic potato salad and corn salsa. I guess this was intended to save them $ but I would never expect a steak, especially one at a traditional and sophisticated steakhouse, to be served that way. I enjoyed the lobster Newburgh carbonara best and the chocolate mousse dessert was just fine. I tried my friend's baked Alaska which was unpleasantly fragrant.

4.0,8/4/2016,"Went here with my mother and her co workers for dinner during restaurant week. With the mediocre reviews- I was a bit worried about dinner. I have always wanted to try Delmonicos though so figured Why NOT?As mostly everyone knows restaurant week in NYC offers specials at various restaurants in the city for a super affordable price. Lunch usually runs about 30 bucks and dinner somewhere around $42. This includes three course. When participating in restaurant week at a steakhouse you cannot go wrong! Delmonicos is a very pretty restaurant that is located down by Wall Street where much of the ""old school"" NYC architecture can be found. The receptionist at the front desk was super friendly. They sat us promptly at our reservation time. They have the main dining room of which we sat in but also a downstairs room and a bar area at the far right end of the first floor. The set up is very much of an old ballroom, regal, elegant and grand.For starters I had the lobster carbonara which was really good. Actual lobster chunks are always yummy (not that you should expect any less at a steakhouse ). For dinner I had the roasted filet mignon which I was intimidated about because of the ""roasted title"". Th waiter had stated there was no cooking temperature required. This made me a little nervous as I HATE dry steak and prefer it medium rare. Long and behold my first cut ensured the redness that I loved which made me super happy! The steak was delicious! The potatoes were cooked just right . For desert I had the chocolate mousse cake which was rich. We ordered a bottle of white wine of which was Savignon Blanc. Wish I remembered the brand because it was the smoothest I had in a longgg time. The wait staff was super friendly and attentive. Delmonico's was good not superb but definitely worth a visit. (this could be because of our limited menu options for restaurant week - not sure).",1,0,0,Tara S.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",65,308,271
4.0,8/4/2016,"I surprised my boyfriend with dinner at Delmonico's for his birthday. While he lived in the Delmonico's building for 2.5 years, we never ate there, so I figured it was time to give it a try.It delivered! We took advantaged of the Restaurant Week special. Both of us opted for the Delmonico Steak, though it came with a supplemental fee. It was well worth it! He ordered his rare and was impressed with the quality of meat and lack of blood on the plate. I'm a bit more finicky with meat, regardless of quality, and ordered mine medium (I typically order steak medium-well or even well done). It was delicious.  The steak was just perfectly pink in the middle. Both steaks came with the seasonal veggies - a bean/corn salad and maybe a potato salad? I didn't eat either of them - again, I'm a picky eater. My boyfriend was not terribly impressed with the sides either.I started with a cool take  on a caprese salad - heirloom tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella, and a pesto sauce. It paired nicely and was great to begin with. My boyfriend had a lobster bisque pasta that he described as mac-and-cheese with lobster in an attempt to get me to give it a taste - this means it was really good because he knows i love mac-and-cheese, but i'm not a fan of seafood, so I passed.We also both enjoyed the dark chocolate mousse cake for dessert. Topped with a raspberry, the mousse was light and sweet paired to the warm and rich cake it covered. The dark chocolate topping complemented the dessert perfectly. The dessert set atop seemingly a crisp wafer. The dessert melted in your mouth.We will definitely go back to celebrate again. Our bill came in around $150, which is pretty good for the typical prices. But this is definitely a special occasion restaurant for us.",0,0,0,Kati C.,"West Covina, CA",1,2,0
4.0,8/3/2016,"This is an older restaurant, and while it's not my style, I can very much appreciate that they keep an old time, elegant feel.  It's a darker restaurant, so not really enough lighting to take nice photos without flash, but certainly light enough so you're not feeling sleepy.  I also appreciate that it's not so fancy that you feel like you have to dress up hardcore.  Service.  This was unfortunately subpar considering the type of restaurant I [perhaps unfairly] assumed it to be.  I felt a little neglected... especially in the beginning.  It took a while for us to be acknowledged at certain points.  However, the food did come out in great timing and succession, which is always a plus.Ahhh the food!  So, I came here for restaurant week, but they still offered plenty of options for the restaurant week menu.Heirloom Tomato Salad :  I was very hesitant about trying this bc I really dislike tomatoes.  However!  I'm pleasantly surprised to say that it was absolutely delicious!  The tomatoes were nice and sweet, the composition was very light and refreshing - perfect to start off a heavier entree!Lobster Newberg Carbonara : This was a pretty good dish.  Also relatively delicate in flavor, and the lobster was cooked wonderfully! I will say though, the flavor very much reminded me of pho broth.  Not a bad thing, just unexpected hahaPetit Filet Mignon : Ordered medium rare, and medium rare it was! Perfectly cooked, wonderful sauce to accompany that was nice and sweet.  Great combo of sweet and savory.  Spot on ;) The summer salad and potatoes were also great!  Again, nice to have a more refreshing balance when eating steak.  Well done!Delmonico Classic Steak : Oh my geezus... as far as flavor goes, this is perhaps the best steak I've ever had.  My eyes actually watered after the first bite... My only tiff about this steak is that there were parts of it that were overcooked and a little more tough.  However, for the most part, it was medium rare as requested, and holy cow, were those parts heavenly.Baked Alaska : This reminded me of Thanksgiving/Christmas spices.  I wasn't a humongous fan of the dish as a whole, but I ended up eating all the left over meringue on the outside.  I'll probably have diabetes when I'm older, but the meringue was delicious O.oNew York Style Cheesecake : I really liked the flavor and texture of this dish.  It was less super sweet, and more 'savory' if you could say that about a cheesecake.  Could taste more of the cheese flavor than just a boat load of sugar.  Also, it was pretty mousse like; lighter than most cheesecakes I eat.  Super enjoyable, especially with the berry sauce that comes with it!Overall, the food is definitely a good enough reason for me to come back some day.  However, I'm really REALLY grateful that they participated in restaurant week because I'll definitely have to save this place for when I actually have a regular paycheck to live off of instead of student loans =P  If you don't mind the price tag or can manage to come during restaurant week, definitely try it out!",1,0,1,Amelia A.,"New York, NY",296,167,576

Honestly, I could have just eaten the whole thing and called it a day, but I'm glad I stayed for the rest.The caprese salad was made with pesto sauce and it was a really tasty twist on the classic. I had the salmon as a main dish which was cooked perfectly and was the perfect sized fillet.A few observations:The dessert left much to be desired. I had a chocolate moose cake which was very, very bitter with a strangely textured cake/brittle/I don't know what bottom. Everything else was so good that I was a bit disappointing that it would be the last thing I tasted for the evening.Also, the service was interesting. The waiter was a tad on the rude side. Nothing extraordinarily crazy or awful, but he was a bit snobbish. Also, the second we paid our check they asked us to leave because there were other people waiting for tables. Like literally the second after we paid. It was really unsettling.

Obviously the restaurant itself is beautiful with outstanding decorations, but I've got to say I've had better steak. I'm not sure if it was because it was restaurant week and maybe they're using lower quality meats, but the filet mignon was dry and not very tender (I did order medium rare and it looked medium rare, which confused me more).  Maybe I should've tried a different steak, but the others were a $15 supplemental charge, which negates the worth of restaurant week.  Also, the baked Alaska was not as phenomenal as expected; it was a bit heavy and very fragrant.

First opening a speakeasy, in 1933, after the repeal of Prohibition, he opened Oscar's Delmonico. Other Delmonicos have operated in the space from 1981 to 1992 and since 1998.As someone mentioned better than I can write they are probably, however, still preparing the steaks the same as they did for Theodore Roosevelt, Mark Twain, Arthur Sullivan, ""Diamond Jim"" Brady, Lillian Russell, usually in the company of Diamond Jim, Charles Dickens, Oscar Wilde, The Lumber Boys of Murray Hill, J.P. Morgan, James Gordon Bennett, Jr., Nikola Tesla -- Nikola Tesla?!?!? - and more. So, what...For me the lentil soup special and the double rib eye tomahawk (which was enough food for three people) were pretty amazing.

However, when visiting Delmonico's with the following in-mind: ""I am here for its rich history not for its great food."" All in all, the place has been around since 1827 and its patrons list includes some of the history's most prominent people. Is it the best steak in town?

For the main course I had the Delmonico steak. Heavenly bliss. This was one of the most amazing steaks I've had, ever. It was so good. And it was something like a 16 oz steak. I had to take my time to eat it all. It was a bit fatty, but there was enough meat on the steak that I cut off the fatty parts of it and still had plenty to fill me up. Didn't have room for dessert after that steak, but really didn't need it. The server was great too, a Croatian guy, super nice and very helpful on what to order.

This time, three of us split a special, a bone-in 60 day dry aged Waygu cut. Was it expensive? Absolutely but quite possibly the best steak I've had in my life. It was the best of both steak worlds: incredibly tender texture of soft on the inside, crispy on the edges, combined with mouth-watering flavor.

Which is a private dining room to accountLate is say at least 10-15 people comfortably. I have also been to functions here where the entire downstairs of the restaurant is rented which works well for 50-100 people I'd say.

How about being the first fine dining estaishment in the country ? Not enough ? Maybe the inventor of a LA carte in america. Thanks to this restaurant it's your choice what to get on your dish wheeler you go. The decor was quite lovely a little old and could maybe use a little touch up but then again this place has been around for decades so maybe keeping that old charm would be best for again place as important as this. It's a legend amongst steakhouses. The outside decor is just stunning. Beautiful and luxurious with the two front pillars sitting outside the building directly imported from the buried city of Pompeii itself. Dress professional for this spot. The filet mignon ordered was just juicy and tender quite stunning. One of the best filet mignon I have ever tasted. And the delmonico steak? They're the creators so what do you think ?

The place is steeped in history, being the first fine dining establishment in the States, and has invented many dishes, including Eggs Benedict, Lobster Newberg, and the Baked Alaska.Came here for the boyfriend's birthday. Just dinner for two. I ordered a Martini and was sad to discover that there was no Plymouth gin. Bummer, but not the end of the world. The bf had a glass of a lovely Bordeaux. For appetizers, we ordered the scallops and Lobster Newberg. Both were phenomenal and I would highly recommend these dishes. The scallops were fresh and sweet, and the lobster was rich and buttery. The bf got a Delmonico streak, while I ordered the chicken. I would normally make fun of someone like myself ordering poultry in a place known for steak. But, alas, I almost never eat red meat anymore. The chicken dish was described as containing chanterelles. When it arrived, the bird was topped with cremini aka button mushroom aka the common mushroom. The cheapest most boring mushroom. The cremini did not work with the ""Roasted Onions-Apple Soubise"" sauce that the chicken was resting on. The flavor of the apple would have worked with chanterelles, but cremini? Awful. Thankfully, I was full from the appetizers and was saving room for the Baked Alaska. The bf loved his steak. We also ordered the mashed potatoes and a special side of broccoli rabe. Both were nice. I tried a little tiny bite of the steak and enjoyed it.The Baked Alaska was great. They brought it out with a solitary candle and thankfully didn't sing birthday songs. The meringue is incredible and I would gladly eat it every day of my life. The banana sorbet was an unexpected but nice touch. Service was attentive and apt, apart from failing to notify me that there will be no chanterelles in my chicken dish.Overall, I'm not going to seek out another visit, but if somebody brings me there for a celebration or a work dinner, I would be okay with that.",1,0,1,Maria D.,"New York, NY",34,40,0

The steak was outstanding. Perfectly seared and made to perfection for medium. The sides were cauliflower and potatoes. They were well done but nothing which wowed me.

2.0,2/5/2016,"What a disappointing meal at Delmonico's!  I wasn't expecting this at all.  It was Restaurant Week and I was in New York's oldest restaurant for lunch.  The lunch started off fine with a very tasty iceberg wedge salad.  Little did I know this would be the highlight of the meal.  Perhaps I should have realized though when I asked for pepper for my salad and got a nano-second half-turn of the pepper mill that Delmonico's might not be the great restaurant experience I was thinking it would be. The rolls were chewy in a way that suggested they were not fresh or had been sitting out for quite a while.  Then came the classic Delmonico steak which I ordered medium well.   To me this was a piece of meat that never should have left the kitchen of a reputable restaurant.  It was small (at least in comparison to the tables right alongside me who had ordered the same thing) and it was fatty beyond being marbled ... very fatty - like maybe 20% of it.  And except for the outside, it was brilliant red on the inside - hardly medium well.  The very few vegetables accompanying had a very thick sauce that had kind of congealed and was not even hot.  I mentioned it to the waiter when one finally stopped by and he did admit that the steak was ""kind of"" on the red side.  Anyway, I just told him to box it and I'll take it with me and cook it later on which I did.  The desert was a very small cheesecake - supposedly New York style but noticeably very much lighter than other famous New York style cheesecakes.  The service of the busboys was excellent and water glasses were constantly kept filled and plates taken away when finished. Of course Delmonico's looks nice and there is a lot of history.  But a Restaurant Week lunch that costs a base price of 43 dollars not counting drinks, tax, and tip, one should expect more.  I am so often asked to recommend restaurants to people visiting New York City.  Sadly based on my experience, Delmonico's will not be one of them!",4,2,2,Jeff H.,"Margareten, Vienna, Austria",241,1104,7351
5.0,2/4/2016,"My co-worker and I went here for lunch during Restaurant Week Winter 2016. I have past this place several times and have heard great things about their food. I started with the Roasted Beet & Feta Heirloom Apples & Oranges, toasted farro. Sweetness from the apples and oranges, and a little salt from the feta made this starter SOOO tasty! My coworker started with the Rock Shrimp Risotto Cacio e pepe. Unlike me, she's a slow eater, but she took even more time with this dish. It was definitely a hit with her.We had the same entree: 18 Hour Orange Chili Glazed Short Rib Whipped Sweet Potatoes, Winter Greens. My coworker didn't enjoy the short ribs stating it was too stringy. (she left a good portion behind). Me, on the other hand, LOVED it. It was tender, juicy, and so flavorful. The hint of orange chili even in the mashed potatoes made this dish extra delicious! I took my time with this and enjoyed every. single. bite. Dessert: Dark  Chocolate Mousse Cake Hazelnut Praline Crunch. Decadent, rich, chocolaty, with some crunch. It didn't get any better than that. Overall: I will definitely go back for dinner.

3.0,2/3/2016,"**WINTER 2016 RESTAURANT WEEK REVIEW**I made a terrible, terrible mistake. Don't ask me why I did it because I'm not even sure I can explain it myself. I came to Delmonico's for restaurant week and I ordered...FISH. [DUN, DUN, DUN!] I just wasn't in the mood for steak that night so I veered off course. It was their fish of the day. I don't even remember what fish he said it was but it just tasted like a low grade salmon. As soon as it arrived, I knew I had made the wrong choice. The edges of the fish looked dry. But looks were deceiving. In a bad way. It tasted a lot drier than it looked. And the dish overall just did not look too pleasing. It came with herbed spaetzle, butternut squash (literally about 5 tiny cubes), wild mushrooms, and spinach. Everything almost looked like it was haphazardly thrown on top of the fish. The spaetzle was pretty good, I'll give them that. But the mushrooms were just way too salty and didn't seem to go well with the fish. Good thing my boyfriend made the right choice by ordering the Delmonico Classic Steak. It was cooked perfectly (medium-rare) so naturally, I just kept stealing bites of his food.But let's rewind a little, back to the appetizers. If I were rating the solely based on this, I probably would have given a 4. I order the rock shrimp risotto and it was excellent. It had the perfect amount of cheese and pepper in it. There wasn't a whole lot of shrimp in there but the portion overall was a good size - unlike most other restaurant week appetizers. He had Delmonico's blue crab cake, with thick-cut bacon and maple-mustard horseradish. The crab cake was great - didn't taste breadcrumby or frozen. The thick-cut bacon paired really well with it. It sounds like an odd combination but it wasn't. It was a match-made in heaven. Then again, let's be serious - anything paired with bacon is a match-made in heaven. The crab cake came on top of a salad so it gave the dish a good balance, and was nice and refreshing.And now let's fast forward to the dessert. I'm not really a huge fan of sweets so I can't say I loved either of what we ordered, which was the New York Style cheesecake and the baked Alaska. The cheesecake just tasted like any other cheesecake. Nothing special. The meringue of the baked Alaska was perfectly browned, so it had that nice charred taste, but not overly so. The cake was too sweet for me though.Service was prompt but our waiter did not look happy to be there. Either he hated his job, or he hated the fact that we only ordered off the restaurant week menu.Another thing worth mentioning is that they a restaurant week special for wine. It's $38/bottle (or $10/glass) and you have a choice between Delmonico's red or white (forgot exactly what they were). We went with the red and weren't disappointed with it.I don't know if I would dine here again, but it was a nice experience.Fun fact - Delmonico's is this year's oldest participating restaurant.

I had the pleasure to experience this gem during restaurant week which is a great way to get to as many NYC dining hotspots at a great price and then pick and choose your favorite to experiment further in dining. I went with my two girlfriends and had the pre fixed menu which was a great intro and each friend had a different order so we all got to try each other's plates! I had their wedge salad with just enough of each ingredient to make it fab! the filet mignon cooked medium rare with roasted cauliflower and for dessert NYC cheesecake When there someone at your table must get the baked Alaska can be a shareable dessert as it was created at delmonicos what's better than that!? Fluffy piped meringue torched to perfection with soft fluffy cake and ice cream hiding inside.

3.0,1/31/2016,"I'd like to begin by saying we went for restaurant week, Friday night. We had 9:30 reservations, but were down the street having a drink with friends and I called to see if they could push our reservation to 10pm. The woman who answered said no, the kitchen was closing at 10pm. I have no idea how accurate that is or if that makes sense for a restaurant of such a prestigious rep, but whatever. That pissed me off. Ambiance:What you'd expect. Gorgeous, charming and stunning decor. Dimly lit creates a perfect tone for any occasion. Food:Next, our meal. We ordered off the restaurant week prix fixe menu. I chose the rock shrimp risotto to start. Wonderful flavor, absolutely no shrimp. WOW what a disappointment to begin the meal. Orange chili short ribs were pretty amazing. Definitely saved face during this course. The baked Alaska dessert absolutely blew my mind. OMGGGGGGG was it good. Good isn't the right word. Soft heavenly pillows of meringue on top beautifully torched, cool banana ice cream in the center and walnut cake at the bottom. I would eat that dish every single day and still be in love. The chocolate mousse was quite an average chocolate mousse. Service:The waiter clearly realized that this young couple was here for the affordable restaurant week price and did not treat us with the same charm and hospitality as a larger table dropping big bucks next to us. I understand the game. The more money the table spends the bigger the tip, but our waiter was quiet, not paying attention to us when he spoke, he didn't even make eye contact. Very rude and I didn't appreciate the treatment. Severs should give each table the same courtesy and ""Delmonicos"" treatment no matter the check.

The salad had a wonderful layering of satisfying flavors. Tasted very fresh. The short rib melted in my mouth. It was so tender and the pureed sweet potatoes were a heavenly pairing. Lastly, the cheesecake was a perfect small portion (there's no way I could have handled a huge chunk after all I ate - this was an ideal size) and it was so creamy.

Also not good for larger groups because they are not good with food allergies. We had a gluten allergy in our group and we thought it was weird that they put flour in pretty much every side. They had tons of potato side dishes but all had gluten and they were never offered to be cooked without it. The only side that person was offered was asparagus. I think many other places are more accommodating and the steak is more flavorful at other places.

3.0,8/20/2015,"I'd been to Delmonico's Kitchen in Midtown before (worked in the same building) but never made it out to the historic original in FiDi. Well, estaurant Week provided the perfect excuse!Their RW was pretty ridiculous, and not in a good way. Nearly everything had a supplementary cost, and if you wanted to stick to the $38 dinner, you only had a handful of choices. That said, they had a lot of their standards on the list, so it was still a decent way to try the bucket list items.As an appetizer, we did the oysters, which were fine. We got the west coast selection, but they didn't bother letting us know where they were from. Red flag? Maybe. But they were fresh enough.For a starter, I had their famous lobster newberg (which was a $15 supplement). I have to say, it was a hefty portion of basically half a lobster. The sauce was creamy and rich, but sparse so it wasn't overly heavy. Definitely worth trying as a starter, but I don't know if I could handle a whole entree of it.For my main, I had the grilled filet mignon. It was okay, but I've had better cuts elsewhere (even in their Midtown location). No doubt they were saving some ""choice cuts"" for Restaurant Week. Either that, or it was just overrated.Also tried the Chicken a la Keene, which is another signature dish of theirs, and that was highly disappointing. The chicken was way overcooked and dry as all hell. Maybe a bad example because they're not used to cooking RW portions? Either that, or it just sucked.For dessert, I had the dark chocolate mousse cake, which had a nice salted caramel sauce. Thought it was fine, but nothing extraordinary.The baked Alaska, on the other hand, was both beautiful and so, so heavy. I get that baked Alaskas take some amount of work, but for a $6 supplement, they should've just made it smaller and more manageable. Two people could've shared it. Oh well, the walnut cake and banana gelato was tasty though.They also had a house Montepulciano D'Abruzzo (my favorite red wine), which was surprisingly good for just $35 a bottle during RW. Yum.One last thing - we had a reservation a few weeks in advance and were seated in the room downstairs (in the Dickens Alcove). I'm not saying they were seating all the minorities together, but... there were only two tables of white people downstairs (one of which was a large group), and upstairs was all white people. Maybe it's a dress code thing, or maybe it's because they didn't want RW-ers to take up valuable space upstairs, or maybe they just don't like people who book on Open Table. I don't know and I'll let you draw your own conclusions, but when they start surrounding your table with Asian tourists, you get the hint.",3,0,0,Kenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",884,3337,12015

1.0,8/13/2015,"BEAUTIFUL RESTAURANT!  But stay away during restaurant week.Upon checking in & glancing at the historic dining room, we were shuttled down to a musky, dank basement dining room where other restaurant week folks were.Table setting: Upon seating, Burgundy rimmed charger & wine glass laced with faint grease fingerprints.Menu: NOTE: Upcharge items NOT worth orderingAppetizer: Gulf Shrimp Risotto: 4 of us ordered this & presented with a consistently gooey, thick, microwaved warm glob of oatmeal consistency paste with one dull warm medium size shrimp. Very unappetizing presentation. Chef's Chilled Soup Presentation: gazpacho soup-tasted like tomatoes only & represented none of what this soup should have tasted like.Wedge Salad: not served ICE cold as it should be, other then that, its salad.Delmonico's Blue Crabcake -Supplement $12: Made with ingredients that never merged nor added to the flavor of this single bite size crabcake. Entrees: Grilled Filet Mignon w. Chef's Seasonal Vegetable Preparation: 6 of us ordered this. It was served on a small dollop of warm, dull, gooey pasted, mashed potato with 3-5 luke warm tasteless string beans. The meat was ok, not sizzling hot when served and 1/2 of us ate ONLY 1/2 the food. Overnight Barbecued Short Rib: It tasted like it was left out overnight, my 'NOT' picky eater friend was so turned off, he didn't finish this meal. Meat was dry and rubbery. The description in menu sounded better than what was actually served. CONCLUSION: everything was served with a dull glazing over the meal, like it sat around for a long time before being served. No entrees were served piping hot. Flies were circling our food.Dessert: Dark Chocolate Mousse Cake, salted caramel sauce: 3 ordered this & was eaten. Tiny teaspoon of sauce provided, nothing impressive to rave of.Classic Baked Alaska-supplement $6: NOT WORTH IT! This was HORRIBLE! 2 of us ordered this warm plastic-ky tasting, burned meringue which overwhelmed the small piece of room temperature walnut cake & iced banana gelato. The ingredient combination didn't merge well. We ate each item separately as each had a different texture & did not cut down smoothly with the fork. To their credit, the gelato was good, I rather it served alone. 2/3 of this was left on the plate, no one wanted to eat this.New York Style Cheesecake, Strawberry Compote: one ordered this. Unlike description, it tasted like sour blackberry topping with no complexity nor spice, cheesecake was nothing remarkable.Service: Nothing remarkable, the waiter gave us the bill BEFORE we asked & told us gratuities were already added, we never saw him again for any services afterwards. Overall: If restaurant week was meant to introduce restaurants in hopes of normal patronage, this one FAILED at its intent! For a grand, ""classy"" restaurant, food was sub-par & not even worth $38.  Flies were a big turnoff as they laced our entrees & desserts. The smell of the basement was ANOTHER turnoff.

2.0,8/11/2015,"In Restaurant Week, there are hits and there are misses. This one was definitely a miss. I went to the newer, modern Delmonico's Kitchen years ago and remembered it being pretty good, but I'd always wanted to try the original Delmonico's, which is iconic and historic and an integral part of NYC food/restaurant history. It's up there along with Grand Central Oyster Bar (which is definitely worth a visit). Unfortunately my experience was not just mediocre, it was actually kind of bad.The restaurant itself is beautiful, with a big formal dining room and huge chandeliers hanging from the ceiling. Unfortunately, we only managed to catch a glimpse of that lovely room before we were shuttled to the basement downstairs to dine in what appeared to be the ""minority section."" No joke, it was hard to miss the discrepancies between the clientele dining on the main floor versus the patrons in the basement. Look, I'm not making any accusations here, I'm just saying, it seemed a little suspect....For food, we all ordered various items off the RW menu. I went with the shrimp risotto, the Chicken A La Keene, and Baked Alaska. The shrimp risotto was mostly good, a nice flavor and good portion, but the rice was undercooked. As for the chicken, well, of course I'm the idiot who orders chicken at a steakhouse, but my whole reason for doing so was because this was supposed to be one of Delmonico's original creations, along with the Lobster Newberg and Baked Alaska. How often do you get to eat a piece of history?As such, this dish has had many years to get old and tired, and perhaps they should consider retiring it permanently. First of all, the dish looked like something you'd see in a cafeteria. Really unappealing. Second, the chicken was really dry and overcooked, and the noodles were almost flavorless. The dish desperately needed more pimentos and mushrooms, the only bright spots on this dish. I hate to be blunt, but forget fancy restaurant standards, this dish is kind of awful by any standards. On a happier note, I think the others in the group who ordered the Lobster Newberg and Filet Mignon were pretty happy with their dishes. The Baked Alaska had a nice photo-worthy presentation, with its round marshmallow fluff and burnt sugar peaks. The inside, consisting of banana gelato and walnut cake was pretty tasty, but too rich for me to finish.Second class citizen treatment, sub-par food, and inflated prices add up to a disappointing and unsatisfying dining experience.

The location is perfectly situated in the middle of the hustle and bustle of FiDi. Some people mistake it for the Flatiron Building (don't be one of those people). This was a favorite of Abraham Lincoln, so it's safe to say Delmonico's is a historic NYC staple.Service was phenomenal. The waiter was friendly and accommodating. He even added a candle to my sister's dessert since it was her birthday and didn't force the bill on us until we asked for it. The filet mignon was underwhelming and dry, which is why I deducted a star. However, the lobster newburg was delicious! There's a $25 supplemental charge to this dish, but Papa Sun insists on seafood at every meal. The lobster was so rich in flavor and the portion was huge. Probably even big enough for 2. I tried the chicken a la keene dish as well, which pretty much tasted exactly how you would expect a chicken and pasta dish to taste. My family also ordered the branzino, which was seared perfectly, but not something I would recommend at this steakhouse. For dessert, we had a few things to try, but the Baked Alaska was definitely the winner. It also makes for a pretty instagram photo.

4.0,8/4/2015,"** Restaurant Week Summer 2015 Review ** Delmonico's has been on my radar for a while now so when my mom mentioned she'd like to have dinner during Restaurant Week, I quickly made reservations. The restaurant has a lot of history - dating back to 1837. It's credited as the 1st American restaurant to allow its customers to order a la carte, instead of prix fixe. Delmonico's menu is pretty similar to other Restaurant Week menus - there are three options for appetizers, entrees, and desserts. There are three addition options for both appetizers and entrees with supplements. Both my sister and I opted for the Chef's Chilled Soup of the Day since it was so hot outside (boarding around 95 degrees). The soup of the day was a Butternut Squash with lobster chunks. It was so good - it wasn't very cold, which was nice. The butternut squash was strong and nutty, which mixed well with the lightly salted lobster. I think this was my favorite dish of the night.For our mains, both my sister and I had the 8-ounce Filet Mignon with chef's seasonal vegetables. The filet mignon is only available for the dinner menu for Restaurant Week. I'm a huge fan of filet mignon - it's probably my cut of choice because I don't like big, meaty steaks. The portion size is generous and cooked to my requested medium-rare. The sides were green beans and fingerling potatoes, which are two of my favorite steak sides. Both were very tasty. The combination of steak juices and the potato sauce made for a great dipping for my steak.My mom went with the Grilled Striped Bass with maitake mushrooms, sauce Americain, marble potatoes, and Maine lobster. The portion size was very generous and my mom couldn't even finish her dish. For dessert, we ordered one of each option. The Dark Chocolate Mousse was my favorite - there was a nice crunch at the bottom of the mousse. The dark chocolate was nice because it cut the sweetness of the mousse. The Baked Alaska was a bit underwhelming - I found it a bit too sweet. And I have a sweet tooth so if I think it's too sweet, that's saying something! It's also a huge portion so it's definitely sharable.Service was attentive throughout dinner and all our dishes came out very quickly. We barely waited 5 minutes between courses. I didn't particularly feel rushed but it did end up being a quick dinner. Delmonico's is a very classic and well-oiled steakhouse. I'd probably return again to try out their classic Delmonico's steak with sides (I spied them on the table next to us!).",0,0,0,Michelle T.,"New York, NY",367,1165,1125

The fact that you cannot accommodate your customers requests to order a burger in the main dining area and require them to move to the bar is completely  unacceptable. I do understand if there are two different menus, but when you have a group that  wants to order steaks, oysters and burgers there should be an exception. I looked forward to this dining experience and was appalled with the way the waiter treated my party.

I had the fries and honestly believe they were the best fries I've ever eaten. Since we were celebrating a birthday the waiters were so nice. They even put a candle in the Baked Alaska.

2.0,5/20/2015,"Such a disappointment at an expensive price. Came with a friend to enjoy a nice steak dinner. First issue was our food took 35 minutes to come out. It wouldn't have been an issue except the restaurant wasn't busy and we only ordered entrees. When I asked the waiter about the wait. He told us lobster takes longer than steak to cook. At that point I was scared because clearly that's preposterous and not accurate. My friend got the T-Bone and I got a special they had lobster and bone in ribeye. We both ordered our steaks medium rare. Imagine my surprise when both of our steaks came out wrong. Her steak was overcooked and mines was unevenly cooked. Parts was rare, parts was medium and parts was medium rare. My lobster was grossly overcooked. My dish was $85 for poorly executed disaster. My friend brought these issues to the waiters attention and he was combative. Telling her that's the way it comes. So lobster comes rubbery and steak comes chewy and barely edible. Unbelievable. Every time I attempted to cut my steak the whole table shook. That's how much effort and force it took. The best part about the meal was that it was well seasoned. We ended up throwing away half the meal. Overall bad food and service. I will NEVER Come here again. Waste of time and money. I've been to several other steakhouses with better food and service. A steak house that can't cook steak. Imagine that. The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 is because the wine was great (because they didn't have anything to do with making it) and the ambience was wonderful.",8,0,0,Akeema R.,"Manhattan, NY",62,38,118

The best steak I've had in my entire life. We finished with the baked Alaska which was originated there the waiter told us.

2.0,4/3/2015,"Delmonico's is a place I'd wanted to try for a long time.  I'm a history buff, and the thought that the first commercial a la carte restaurant in the US (owner/venue switches aside) is still open is pretty damned cool.  Place has a lousy reputation as a tourist trap, but even so this seemed worth a visit just to try the dishes they invented.  Delmonico's has been doing Restaurant Week for a few years now so I felt this was a safe way to try it out without breaking the bank.  We got put downstairs which didn't bother me at first, even though it seemed they were herding most of the Restaurant Week-folk down there.  Service was alright but kind of rude and forgetful (see below).  They didn't even bother asking us if we wanted drinks once we said we were getting the stupid special.  I grabbed a glass of their house red cabernet sauvignon, which was alright.  Food also came out real quick, and they seemed to be trying to rotate tables quickly.Bread basket was good as others noted, but it was really incredible; the salt on top of the butter was kind of nasty in my opinion.  The Lobster Newburg, which I had been looking forward to more than anything else, was completely disappointing.  The only good thing about it was that it included lobster.  Otherwise it was absolutely bland; I expected the cream sauce to be much richer.  The veggies added in didn't even help.  I could deal with the small portion, but at least execute it well (or just don't offer it).  I hope they had cut ingredients out of this.  My friend's wild boar cavatelli was better, but also lacked flavor.  My Delmonico steak was much better, even though it was clearly overdone from the requested medium rare.  That's a pet peeve of mine at most steak houses.  The steak also could've been trimmed more carefully, as there was one side that clearly had too much fat on it even for a ribeye.  The potatoes it came with were good.  My friend enjoyed her petit filet, but they had undercooked her steak to medium rare; in all likelihood the waiter screwed up because he wasn't paying attention.  For dessert I stayed away from the premium options and just grabbed a NY-style cheesecake.  The cheesecake itself was great, but it was placed on a cheap cracker rather than a true graham cracker crust for some reason.  My friend enjoyed her chocolate moose cake thing regardless.Color me unrealistic, but I was really excited to eat here and was a bit disappointed with my overall experience.  I can understand the food being a bit off because of the promotion, but the service too?  No excuse for that--especially when you're a steakhouse that can't get your steaks to the properly cooking level.  I might give this another shot if someone else is buying, but I would never come here on my own (which should have been their goal in doing this promotion in the first place).",7,1,2,Justin L.,"New York, NY",900,1005,34

The wedge salad was great small salty and vibrant the blue cheese was slightly pungent and made the salad. Next came the petit filet with fingerling potatos in cream sauce with a cab demi and charred cauliflower. This entire course was under salted but everything was delicious and I simply grabbed the salt on the table to remedy it. I'm a somewhat picky person the only way they could've improved it was more salt (personal taste) and served it on a warm plate as the cauliflower had gotten a bit lukewarm by the time I got to taste it. The chocolate mousse cake with cherry compote was yummy but I was a bit confused by the rice crisps in the base of it which were soggy (intentional?). Loved the fresh raspberry ontop of it (that was actually ripe!) We also got the baked Alaska I really liked the sour apricot puree but really cant help but want a burnt caramel drizzle ontop of this baked Alaska.

4.0,3/5/2015,"OH restaurant Week OH restaurant Week- To start I am not a big fan of restaurant week because I have been disappointed by it too many times in the past. This year, one of our coworker suggested that we try Delmonico for lunch, I am totally on board since 1. Delmonico has been on my bookmark for a while now, 2. Delmonico is a historic landmark I would love to see (especially the interior),  3. We work 3 minutes away from the restaurant,  4. It's restaurant week, $25 bucks is well worth the risk and 5. to celebrate a coworker's birthday!Parking: Avoid driving in during weekday morning/afternoon cause parking will prove to be impossible and even if you did find a spot, you'll pay a small fortune for parking. Your chances greatly increase during week nights and weekends. Our party of 3 got to the restaurant around 12:30pm and the place was pretty empty and we were seated right away. Decor and ambiance: first impression- WOW this place is gorgeous, every piece of furniture, decor speaks fine dining and comfort (also means that this is not a casual jean sneaker kind of place- dress to impress people)- from the pattern of the wallpaper,  heavy wooden chairs to the gold laced plates, mini table lamp, finely polished utensils (ones that you can check yourself like a mirror).  There's also a giant wooden glass shelf displaying the history of restaurant- how fascinating!Service: 1 reason why I'm not a fan of restaurant week is because of the service some waiters and waitresses tend to give during this time. They know you are paying less for a meal so therefore they feel that they can give you a little less service (if you know what I mean). I'm Happy to say I DO NOT FEEL THIS WAY AT DELMONICO-  We were served by an older gentleman, he was very pleasant and polite even after we order from the restaurant week menu! He came to check up on us and replenish our water throughout the meal.  Very professional! For the restaurant week menu, we all started with the Wild Boar Cavatelli. First thing that stood out was WOW this is a good size portion for an appetizer, in fact  we almost felt it was too much (but no one is complaining here since my coworkers and I cleared our plates)- the dish was just delicious, the cavatelli- al dente, chewy yet soft, the wild boar tasted great with a lot of flavor and sauce perfectly blends the meat and the carbs together and didn't overpower the dish. Excellent!For main course- two of us went for the 18 Hour Boneless Short Rib (Braised Red Cabbage, Horseradish, Whipped Potato, Wild Mushroom Bordelaise) and the other went for the Wild Striped Bass (Toasted Farro, Butternut Squash and wild mushroom) Again the portion on the Boneless Short Rib was very good! two good size pieces over a bed of cabbage and whipped potato, the taste was even better.  The Short Rib was melts in your mouth good and it had a good amount of fat/meat ratio so every bite was tender, juicy and flavorful.  The potato was on point, nice and fluffy and went perfectly with the red cabbage which was soft, with a hint of wine flavor.  The perfect bite was when you combine the three together, dip it in the bordelaise... just heavenly!!Finally for dessert- My coworker said she don't even need to look and went straight for Baked Alaska (Walnut Cake, Apricot Jam, Banana Gelato, Meringue), she said the Baked Alaska started at Delmonico and proceeded to give us a little background of this dessert, it was cool to learn that the dessert was created by Delmonico Chef Charles Ranhofer in 1876 to celebrate the US purchase of Alaska from Russia.  Just for that fact alone made this a MUST GET!!My other coworker and I went for the Chocolate Mousse Cake (Cherry Compote) and New York Style Cheesecake (Blood Orange, Caramel).The Famous Baked Alaska did NOT disappoint, it was a $6 supplement but well worth every penny.  It's a full size dessert and the presentation was just drop dead gorgeous! The meringue was perfectly browned and it created this meringue shell that's crunchy on the outside and soft/ chewy on the inside.  The meringue underneath the shell was soft and fluffy (like jet-puffed but 100x better) yet not overly sweet. But as you dig deeper into the meringue, you realize that was just icing on the cake (pun intended), hidden inside is the soft/ spongy walnut cake filled with small pieces of walnuts awaiting to be marinated by the banana gelato that sat on top.  The gelato had a strong banana flavor and was very rich and smooth. Talking about texture and flavor overload- this dessert is perfect for sharing and it's definitely a MUST GET!!Overall: What a great restaurant week experience we had at Delmonico!  Actually we were all so impressed by Delmonico that we are looking forward to their summer/fall restaurant week!

3.0,3/4/2015,"We came because of the NY Restaurant week and the $38 menu. Offers a great chance to sample these places without spending lots of money and if you like it, you go back for more. Good thing here was that the promotion menu is basically a smaller portion sized menu to their regular one. The wild boar ragu though was short on boar and big on the pasta. Very tasty though. The lobster my friend enjoyed very much (extra $15). We both had the filet mignon. I requested medium well; he requested medium rare. They came the same way prepared. Came with roasted cauliflower (which was basically one small floret!) and their signature potatoes (portion fit on a spoon). Despite the miserable portion size, was good. Dessert, I had the cheese cake. Clearly to save money it was made on one of the plain biscuits you buy in the store rather than a biscuit crumb base. The baked Alaska (+$5) at least was of quality. Banana gelato inside the Italian merengue. Well presented and garnished with some apricot sauce - my friend loved it. I would be inclined to try again in a special occasion but I honestly felt they were being cheap on some things that were not really expensive (cauliflower, potatoes, biscuit crumb base).

3.0,3/4/2015,"My boyfriend and I had wanted to try Delmonico's for some time. It is a famous restaurant where the Delmonico steak was first created - what's not to like? Apart from the normal price tag of all of the meals. Enter Restaurant Week: you can try a variety of foods, multiple courses, and not have to spend so much money.We both had the restaurant week wine (red, $10 per glass) and the wedge salad. Salad was tasty, very strong blue cheese. He had the petite filet mignon. We were a bit worried about it being ""petite"" - how large is that exactly? However it was a very good cut and size. He ordered it medium well, but it was definitely more medium rare. He enjoyed the taste and ate it as it was. For $18 you could up-charge to the Delmonico Classic Steak which I did. It was good, had a crispier outside and tender inside. Not very juicy, and a lot of fat like the cut normally has. Both of our meals came with a small amount of diced potatoes with a creamy sauce. That was excellent, and we shared an extra side of whipped potatoes which were also delicious. For dessert, he had the cheesecake and I had the chocolate mousse. Not sure if the servings for these were the ""normal"" size or special for restaurant week. It was a pretty small serving, but we were so stuffed at that point it ended up being the perfect amount.Overall I enjoyed my experience but don't feel like I need to go back. The classic Delmonico steak when ordering from the regular menu is about $51. Restaurant week dinners were $38, so with my up-charge my meal was $56. For three courses, I think it was worth that. If I was there for a regular meal, the Delmonico classic steak is NOT worth $51. I was not blown away by the taste of my steak either. I actually found the filet mignon better, and it also came with a small amount of gravy.Our waiter was nice-ish but also pretty snooty. Not sure if that was because we were there for Restaurant Week, or that is how he always is.A few other things: we were required to check our jackets, and we were also sat in a far area past the bar.

I liked this dish, good balance of doughy pasta and tender meat in a flavorful sauce. Entree: Petit filet mignon with potato and cauliflower. It satisfied my craving for a juicy, tender, tasty cut of meat. Not the biggest piece, but with an appetizer and dessert I was full.

As a die-hard chocolate lover, I felt that it certainly hit the spot.Atmosphere: I liked the old school feel, and the fact that it was spacious and had two floors. Wasn't loud or crowded, just comfortable.Service: Our waiter was attentive and waters were refilled promptly.

I work down in Fidi and am on a quest to visit all the old classics before I blow this popsicle stand so here was my chance. What I loved about the place was the atmosphere; serious old school, the service; very efficient and the vibe. What I was not so crazy about was the steak? Hey, it's a steakhouse, y'all need to bring it. We ordered:1. Ceasar salad which was excellent2. the wine list was your average fare, I went with a South African Cab as an ode to the bfriend3. french fries which were good - nothing extraordinary4. bone-in Porter House5. brussels sprouts - WAY too sweet to the point of inedible The steak was overcooked.

Last year we had an uncomfortable dinner experience with our waiter, but I'll give him a pass because he mentioned that had already had 250 different dining parties, so he was exhausted. But THIS year, we were attended to by one of the most pleasant waiters I have ever had at a restaurant. His name was ALEXANDER. He was polite and understanding, considering one member of our party was considerably late.

Such a beautiful place that has been around since 1837! And such good food and friendly service. I was almost expecting a snobbish attitude from the staff, but it was quite the opposite! If they were snobbish, they were good at faking!Onto the food.. I chose a Wild Boar Cavatelli for starters. Followed by a Classic Delmonico Steak (a juicy rib eye served medium) and then a Classic Baked Alaska for dessert! The Baked Alaska had walnut cake, apricot jam, banana gelato, and meringue. I have been looking to try one of these for years! And it was just amazing! My girlfriends and I shared desserts, so we also had the Chocolate Mousse and a NY Cheesecake slice. All three desserts were amazing. All of our dishes were amazing! I hope this restaurant survives for another 178 years! Annnd..

2.0,2/20/2015,"Came here for Restaurant Week, because I love historic, old school restaurants.  I use Restaurant Week to gauge whether or not a place is worthy of a non-restaurant week visit, because I feel if they're good then, they'll be extra special at full price.For a $15 supplement, the Lobster Newburg should have had caviar on it, as was advertised. It didn't.When I asked for a wine list, they offered a red or white Restaurant Week special, and that was it. Take it or leave it.  You'd think that at Restaurant Week prices, they'd want to make up for the loss of regular revenue by offering an entire wine list, which I assume they do have, but no.  We had the house red wine, and it was very good, but I couldn't help feeling the staff definitely had a ""Who cares, it's Restaurant Week"" attitude.  The waiter kind of slung my cutlery onto the table in a haphazard way.   I've been to other restaurants during Restaurant Week and this was the first where you could definitely tell you were having dinner at a discount (Le Cirque was a good contrast - you could have been spending $500 in there, and I don't think the service would have been different, they were very welcoming).My spouse had the petite filet and I had the boneless short ribs. The filet was cooked flawlessly and was very tasty (he gave me a bite).  The short ribs were very good.  We both had the chocolate mousse cake, which was also good.There was a downstairs area where we thought the bar was, but when we asked the  hostess if there was a bar down there, she just said no, it was closed for a private event.  It appears there is a bar next door that she could have mentioned, but she was too busy playing with her phone.The décor was really cool, like an antebellum brothel.  I kept expecting Belle Watling to poke her head around the corner.  This place needs a dress code, though, because the whole place was brought down by people in shabby jeans and trainers and Uggs.  An old school, classic restaurant needs an old-school dress code to go along with it. When I'm out somewhere that seems to cry out for a dress, I don't want to sit next to people who look like they should be buying toilet paper at Kmart instead of eating in a restaurant like Delmonico's.I can check this place off my list of historic places I want to try, but I don't think a repeat visit will happen.",3,1,1,Jamie C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",24,165,4

No. Go hang out there. I'll be at Delmonico's Next Door Grill with the heavy-set desk-jockeys, enjoying perfectly executed Dirty Martinis the way I like them; vodka, rocks, olives, in a rocks glass.

5.0,2/17/2015,Excellent service and very attentive. The burrata (about 2 tablespoons) sat ontop of a bed of quinoa and nuts/seeds with some apple slices and house cute pork belly (aka: bacon!!!) and woah! It was so tasty!!My sister got the wedge salad and that was refreshing and fully flavored. The blue cheese was fabulous!You know when you get a brilliant char on your thick cut steak with that wonderful fatty marbling that runs throughout .. OH! And when the fat around the steak is nice and crispy on the outside and soft and unctious on the inside. You know you shouldn't be savoring the fat as much as you are but you can't help but close your eyes when you take that perfect bite of meat and fat? Yeah. That is exactly what happened.Delmonico's did not disappoint me. They served me the best piece of steak I have had in a very long time. Even with the additional cost .. I recommend you splurge and get this. It's worth more than that extra $18 up charge.We ended our meal with the chocolate mousse with sour cherry compote and nyc cheese cake and a blood orange jelly. Both were mini but perfectly sized considering how full we were. I am so glad one of the yelpers in my town suggested Delmonico's and I went with it.

1.0,1/22/2015,"Delmonico where to start... I was really underwhelmed. We expected a lot more from the waiters, service, and the food at such a high dollar and well known restaurant. THE FOOD:Oysters were fine, not the best, not the worst I've had. We both had steaks, one filet and one age-bone in ribeye. The steaks were  cooked well but the cut of beef was average at best. Side note on my review:  I come from cattle country, so granted I may be a bit harsher critic than others, I know what a good steak should taste like. For a claimed ""40 day dry aged"" ribeye and ""30 day wet aged"" filet these were some very unflavorful cuts of meat. I suspect they don't age their own beef, as a high end restaurant should, they probably just buy it from a food vendor. The steaks were cooked properly, but for the price they are charging there is no excuse for this lack of taste.Sides were not great, I would not recommend the asparagus or mashed potatos that we tried, both were below par. THE SERVICE:They never came by to cheek on the meal or to offer us additional drinks until the very end of the meal. Very sub-par. For a $$$$ restaurant like this you should have at least two waiters, a lead and assistant checking on you, brushing crumbs off the table, folding your napkin when you leave your seat, and making sure your needs are met. Instead the waitors felt content to talk with each other off in the corner and came by at the end of every course to see how it was. 15 minutes after I get my steak, asking if it's cooked properly is unacceptable.  Letting us run out of bread unacceptable. Letting our drinks run out, unacceptable. Plus the other items I mentioned above.Secondly, they are known for their wine selection. However, I was in a craft beer and cocktail mood. I asked the server for the beer list, which he recited to me. They all were lake and burger beers, bud-light, coors, etc. Perfect for burgers, but embarrassing they didn't have a large selection of craft beers for a $250 meal. Asked him if he had any local beers, to which he replied blue moon. (Blue moon is made in Colorado, NOT New York). Then I asked for a moscow mule and if they had copper mugs. They did not have copper mugs, and he and his assistant did not know what a moscow mule even was. Poor training of the wait staff on drinks, and poor craft beer selection. Seems the staff were all there to collect a payday off the expensive food and lacked proper training.Delmonico I expected much more of you.",4,3,0,Keith W.,"Edmond, OK",2,26,6

4.0,1/10/2015,"An old friend and I were here last month. We both thought the food was excellent. This place hasn't really changed (in quality) for roughly 20 years since I first dined here. I had the Filet Mignon entree and she had the Scallops.  They were both extremely good. I'm not a big steak person...at all, but that steak was really good. I thought the mashed potatoes and veggies were extremely good too. They had the right amount of flavor to them...not too much and not too little. My friend insisted I try her scallops.  I am extremely picky about scallops, so I hesitated, but gave-in and had one.  It was really good. I might actually order that for my entree next time I come here. I know people complain about the portions they get for the price.  Honestly, portion size does not bother me at all. I am more about quality than quantity and I felt that the portion...again, in my opinion, was fine. Service was good, although there was  a slight delay in getting our drinks, but that was just a one time flaw. It was Christmas season and this place was really busy that night.  There were definitely a lot of parties/people when we were there, so we understood the slight delay in getting our drinks.

I don't think that is a reflection on the quality of the restaurant's source but more of what you get with a boneless rib eye. If I had to do it again, I would share a Porterhouse for 2 with my wife.

I went with the namesake Delmonico Cut and it was decadent. So buttery, so delicious and the bread basket was awesome! So, why 2 stars?Service lacked. At a place of this prestige and for how much our meal cost, I was really offset by the service. Drinks unattended at first, not quite formal service. Someone mentioned in a review that the waiters know they are going to get a payout anyway, so no need to try. I agree with that whole heartedly. The service brought this meal from 3 stars to 2. It was borderline.Everything else food wise was ridiculously overpriced for the quantity of food served and quality. The Caesar salad was overdressed and just ok, the burrata dish lacked burrata. The Delmonico potatoes (smothered in cheese) and the king crab mac & cheese were extremely unimpressive and super small! The bacon app was 2 smaller strips of bacon and 2 tomatoes. Eh, everything was completely unimpressive. I don't mind paying for small portions, but the food best be incredible.We dropped $600 on a few cocktails per person, steaks, a few sides, a few apps and a few desserts.

For the entree, my friend and I ordered both the Lobster's Newburg since Delmonico's pretty much invented this dish. It was absolutely delicious. Each portion had 4 half tails of lobster. It came with asparagus but this wonderful butter sauce that had the lobster flavor infused. The lobster was cooked perfectly and tender with some thick bite. The tail came easily out of its shell as well so you aren't tackling with it at this nice and fancy restaurant. Finally for dessert, I ordered the lemon cheesecake and this was a little disappointing. While the crust on a cheesecake can be very special (graham cracker, kind of falling apart and mixed in with the cheesecake), this cheesecake's crust is just a thin cookie that doesn't have any flavor and very hard to break since you want some crust in every bite.

Then again, that was all a long time ago and with completely different owners and management.Considering the price, I think this place has a little more hype than quality. It is however very well decorated in classic/European decor inside. It's also pretty large and has a full bar. Definitely worth a try, but not sure I want to come back.Food: Maybe the plates for restaurant week are smaller than usual, but I wasn't very satisfied with the portions. The food was good (not spectacular) but there was virtually no veggie options for that special menu :/All in all I am kind of happy I didn't have to pay full price for this and still I spent over $100 (2 $38 dinners, 1 drink, and tip).",0,1,0,Jorge O.,"México, D.F., Mexico",116,182,220
2.0,8/20/2014,"You'd think after 150+ years, a classic NYC institution such as Delmonico's would've perfected the art of restaurant dining, but unfortunately, our experience fell way short of expectations. First and foremost, I expected top-notch service from this pricey steakhouse, but our waiter was often slow on the uptake, not quite understanding what we were saying when we were trying to inform him of the Lower Manhattan Tuesdays promotion (10% off). In addition, he had no idea how to answer when my bf asked how his bacon would be served and was MIA when we tried to flag him down several times. Not quite the white glove service of lore, even with all the i-bankers dropping cash here.Secondly, the food was mostly disappointing. My steak aficionado bf put his ribeye ($58) at the very bottom of his steakhouse rankings and was appalled that his bacon side (at a whopping $18!!!) was simply one strip cut in two pieces. I was shocked also at how substandard their bread basket was. Although we received a variety of bread, most of the options tasted a bit stale and the breadsticks especially were extremely difficult to chew. How does one mess up bread especially at a supposed high-quality restaurant?? Luckily (and the only reason for the extra star), my acquerello risotto with ruby red shrimp ($28) was pretty decent, although nothing to write home about. They were nice enough to create an entree size portion for me although it's usually served as an appetizer at $19.For dessert, I had to try their renowned Baked Alaska ($12), which was a TERRIBLE disappointment. The meringue wasn't delicate and light and like many Yelpers stated before me, the whole thing was overly sweet. It simply tasted mass-produced.

5.0,8/20/2014,Came to Delmonicos as part of restaurant week. I had the wedge salad which was ok- can't really expect much from a standard salad. My boyfriend got the risotto which he loved. For entrées we both got the filets which we thought were cooked perfectly (rare & medium rare)- they were absolutely delicious. It was served on a bed of potatoes and green beans which was also very good. Got the chocolate cake for dessert which was more like a mousse with a thin layer of cake underneath- yummy but I'm not a big dessert person... We also got the baked Alaska and it was good- a very unique dessert (again I'm not a dessert person).I would totally go back for the steak it was fantastic!,1,0,0,Sabrina A.,"Seattle, WA",8,37,0

3.0,8/15/2014,"Restaurant week review : Entering the venue it would be nice to be greeted by a hostess. Granted it may have been busier than usual I believe service should still be up to standards.  Bread basket was average at best.  But wouldn't have asked for a second basket. Food wise:  appetizers of risotto and lobster was good, but lacked character, it didn't make you want to eat more of it. Entre date had filet mignon which was tender,  moist,  plain delicious, steak sauce on the side would have been better. I got the delmonicos steak, un impressed.  I wouldn't likely go back to have steak. But the baked Alaska saved the night. The light sugary study texture of the meringue, coupled with the moist walnut banana bread, coupled with a refreshing cold gelato ended the course well. The valrona chocolate cake was good, but couldn't compete with the baked alaska. Hopefully, a non restaurant week menu/ service can sway my opinion positively.",0,0,0,James L.,"Manhattan, NY",6,41,3

We didn't order any appetizers as we were meat focused, but when my steak did come out (Prime NY Strip) was cooked to medium perfection, topped with the single best onion ring I've had in my life.

Baked Alaska, Valhrona Chocolate Cake, Lemon Raspberry Cheesecake - by far the Baked Alaska was the most dynamic and interesting of the desserts - as i had never had it before it was a fun experience to see its presentation and take the first bite.

Would I go back: Yes for a nice meal with my parents or family Story: Came here for restaurant week with friends. I've been looking for a steakhouse to add to my list of recommendations as well as i've been waiting to try ""Americas First Restaurant"" and i must say I was impressed. At first we were sat at this back area of the restaurant which I was quite unhappy with when I asked to be moved to the main dining room the staff was very receptive to moving us and did so almost immediately. Throughout the meal the server was very attentive and made sure we had enough bread, checked in with us at multiple points that everything was to our liking. I have no complaints.

4.0,8/1/2014,"My coworkers and I recently came here for Restaurant Week since we wanted to feel fancy (aka drink wine during lunch).  We made our reservation for 1, showed up at 12:45, and were immediately seated (which was nice).  This place is HUGE!  Way bigger than it appears to be from the outside.  We were taken from one room to another to the bar area back into another dining room.  Our table was the perfect size for the 5 of us.  Our waiter was pleasant and quickly brought over the regular menu, as well as the RW menu.  We decided to split two bottles of wine since the RW pricing put it at $30 per bottle.  The wine was a dry red but very tasty and went well with our meal.  For our appetizers, 3 of us went with the wedge salad and 2 of us (including myself) went with the risotto.  The portion of risotto we were given was tiny but it was very well-made and the shrimp was fresh.  The real winner was the bread.  Every piece was warm and their butter was smooth like no other and topped with salt.  For our entree, 4 went with the filet mignon and I decided to be different and get the chicken a la keene.  4 of the 4 asked for their steak to be made rare or as pink as possible. The waiter said they couldn't do anything rarer than medium-well because the steaks are pre-made.  Wait, what?  Makes no sense to me seeing as this is a steakhouse, one with a great reputation, mind you.  He promised to do his best.  My chicken was a bit dry but still relatively flavorful.  The pasta it came with was AMAZING.  So buttery and tender.  I also enjoyed the peas but there were only about 5 of them, which was a bit disappointing.  One of my coworker's steaks came out medium rare, 2 came out medium, and 1 came out medium-well.  The medium-well did not look all that great and the waiter apologized.  The waiter must have picked up on how disappointed we were with the food so he offered us a free baked alaska along with our dessert orders, to make up for the mishap.For my dessert, I went with the raspberry cheesecake.  The cake itself was some of the best I've ever had but it was TINY.  Only one raspberry was put on top and some sort of lime puree was off to the side.  I also tasted the chocolate cake which tasted like chocolate mousse.  The basked alaska was far too sweet.  Even the waiter commented on how sweet it was when he noticed the 5 of us barely made a dent in it.  The meringue was sweet, the geltao was overpowering with banana flavor, and the walnut cake was just so-so.  Overall, the service here makes up for the food, hence me giving it 4 stars rather than 3.",3,0,1,Kristy R.,"New York, NY",421,1576,174

2.0,7/8/2014,"TL:DR Whatevs, it is what it is. Don't fret for missing out.  It's iight though.So the Delmonico's name has a long storied NYC history to it.  I'm not going to get into the details because if you want a history lesson on the restaurant you can copy/paste this lmgtfy.com/?q=Delmonico%….  It's history is probably the main reason Delmonico's carries any weight in the steak scene.  I'm going to come out in the open and say my rating came from not eating any steak here.  My friends and I came here for restaurant week.  I was glad they chose this place since I work around the corner (that's right I work on wall street! don't be too jelly I make more than you.  remember I still don't make more than you enough to not come here for restaurant week).  So out of all my friends I was the only idiot that ordered the chicken.  In my defense the chicken was one of their classic dishes called ""Classic Chicken Epicurean"" aka ""Chicken A La Keene"".  Also it was their only signature dish that did not require adding more money to the set charge of restaurant week.  With the additional charge I might as well have ordered the dish out right.  IT MADE NO SENSE! My economics training and search for market inefficiencies and arbitrage was going full tilt in searching for the better deal.  My calculations based completely on price and words on the menu led me to choose the chicken in a steak house.  I hate my logical brain sometimes.Since it was restaurant week, they cheapened the mains and replaced the foie gra in my chicken dish with herbed noodles.  The chicken was a bit dry even with the sauce.  Maybe I should've requested dark meat, I don't know.  I would've preferred a bucket of chicken from Popeyes...and dare I say it...from KFC (eww, Popeyes for life!)  All my friends were fine with their food, but look, this is Delmonico's.  With it's history it has some expectations to meet other than being a place finance people go for dinner.  If I wanted to do a thing like that, I would've gone to seamless and ate at my desk like how real people in finance eat dinner.  I want to give this place another shot, but I'm in NYC and there is a whole wide world of food out there.  Restaurants better impress on their first try.",3,5,1,Vincent C.,"New York, NY",79,76,135

3.0,6/30/2014,"Hmm ... I don't know about Delmonico's. Maybe it is because it was built up so much in my mind, but I was expecting 5 stars but instead, I got a better than average steakhouse experience.In the Financial District (about a $25 cab ride from Central Park), Delmonico's is one of the oldest restaurants in the United States. Granted what they don't tell you is that it did move locations and this wasn't always the original ... but still, there is history here.Inside you will find people in suits (a rarity it seems for restaurants these days) and most of the patrons are well heeled groups of people ... or balding older guys with younger trophy wives. The crowd is definately a masculine cigar and scotch type of crowd.The waitors are pretty cold to non-regular customers but do a good job ... there is no doubt about the fact these are professional waitors vs. someone just getting by waiting tables. My waitor flat out told me not to order a menu item and what I should order instead, which I absolutely love. Not every dish on a menu is amazing and having a waitor point that out is always something that makes me trust him.The prices here are high ... but the quality is pretty good. With the exception of the 'Iceberg Salad'. I felt cheated by this item ... it came as three little wedges of salad with almost no salad dressing. Just a few blue cheese crumbles and what appeared to be a pinch of BACON BITS!!! There was bearly any tomato ... it looked more like a garnish than a salad. I couldn't believe what a bad salad this was ... at $14 none the less!The poached chilled lobster at $22 is a whole split lobster, chilled with cocktail sauce. A good pick for a lobster lover. I was told to skip the Baked Oysters a la Jim Brady by the waitor.I had the Delmonico steak, which at first glance looked a little on the small side. Combined with a side (Delmonico Potatos ... a cheesy potato bake ... mediocre at best) it actually did end up filling me up. It had the best tasting salty crust ... cooked a bit longer than it should have for medium rare. (was light pinkish grey inside) Aside from the improper cooking ... the taste was great and I found myself scraping smaller bits of meat from the fatty parts of the steak. Probably the smallest steak cut I've had for over $50 but tasty, for sure!The Baked Alaska dessert was interesting looking. Most everyone at the tables around us was ordering this because it was invented at Delmonico's. I found it to be kind of blah and bland except for the too sweet apricot jam they drizzled next to it on the plate. It had a carrot cake type center and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. There were little spikes of merengue all over it that were browned/baked. If I ordered this again, I would ask they leave off the sickly sweet apricot sauce. However, I think this was a try it once type of thing because honestly, it was just sort of blah.Dinner for two came to almost $300 ... worth it to say I tried a classic, but I probably wouldn't go back. I thought it would be much bigger. It is fairly small inside and there seems to be a lot of wasted space. The establishment did not feel 'old' to me either ... it seemed kind of like a wedding hall or something ... the lights were dim but I didn't get that turn of the century vibe as much. Keene's has some of the worst tasting steaks in the city but the atmosphere seems like it come right out of Victorian England. Not so much with Delmonico's.Worth a try to cross off your must try restaurants ... a decent enough steakhouse for sure ... but I didn't feel the value was there for the money. Great tasting steak but the other dishes were too many misses vs. hits for me to go back and spend this type of money.Tip ... walk a block or two over and have a beer or after dinner drink on one of NYC's oldest streets, Stone Street. They have an outdoor Beirgarten and several interesting bars.",2,0,0,E T.,"West Hollywood, CA",34,520,191

However regardless of which part of the restaurant you eat, the service and food that you are going to enjoy will be amazing.So what should you get? First off, have some respect for yourself and order off the non-bar menu. Second, don't waste your time on sides. Creamed spinach was good, but didn't hit the spot. Delmonico's potatoes were enjoyable, but could be done without. The macaroni with crab is delicious, but it really didn't add anything to the dinner. Third, get the appetizers.

The restaurant is well-lit with mini table lamps & chandeliers. All lighting fixtures have the lamp covers which was super cute and tied very well with the historic art around the room. They have a super adorable faux fireplace in the main dinning room. There is a bar, which I didn't get to see, that is separated by a door. It's loud but not so loud where you can hear everyone's conversations. The ladies rest room is downstairs and you get to peek into the private party dinning room. All the wall paperin the restaurant is so cute and chic! I started with the house cured bacon and had a taste of both the main lobster chowder and long island duck ragu. The bacon was tender and juicy. They were not in slices but more like cutlets of meat. The ragu (pasta) was light and packed with shredded duck meat. the chowder was also light and refreshing. Great pick for lobster or chowder lovers! The filet minion was about 7-8 oz. Very tender and soft. The sides - cauliflower and potatoes are delicious. The sauce that the potatoes are served in is delicious! Don't be afraid to mix up the sauces together and dip your steak into it! And dessert was great! I had the cheesecake, light and not overly cheesey. The baked alaska was well presented. The banana gelato/ice cream inside of the baked alaska was yummy. I didn't like the chocolate mousse as much; I was hoping for a little more chocolate in the mousse. Nothing was super sweet and it was a great finish for dinner.

We ate here for restaurant reek Winter 2014.  We had the $38 per person three course meal.  The first course nearly everyone had was the wedge salad.  Nothing special here.  I had the lobster root vegetable chowder.  Not too impressive of a soup. Not sure what's good on the first course.  Possibly other reviewers could recommend a better first course.The second course two of us had was the petit filet mignon.  It's a rather small, tasty steak.  I'd recommend eating this if you're not too hungry but want a good quality steak. The filet comes with cauliflower and a great sauce. However, if you want a bigger steak then there is one available however you will need to pay $15 extra.  One member of a party opted for the larger steak which he noted was good too.  Finally, one member of our group opted for the Arctic Char which was also excellent.The final or dessert course everyone had was the Classic Baked Alaska (an additional $5 pp).  It's a spiky, cool looking ball of dessert with walnut cake, banana, gelato and meringue.  I'd certainly recommend this not just for taste but presentation.  The dessert though is rather large and could be shared by two people imo. In addition to the meal, we had the $30 restaurant week special of Cabaret Sauvingnon red wine.

A lot of things we take for granted in restaurants nowadays - printed menus, private dining rooms, and separate dining tables - all started at Delmonico's.On a cold Friday evening, three friends and I met up in the lobby of Delmonico's for dinner. As we were led to our table towards the back of the dining room, I couldn't help but stare in awe at my surroundings. The dining area itself is enormous, dotted by white-laced curtains around the perimeter of the room. High ceilings are accentuated by elongated, ornate lights that hang from them, and several paintings are featured across the walls as well. Glancing across the room, there seemed to be an endless landscape of tables and diners; the fact that this restaurant has managed to persevere for almost two centuries is nothing short of awe-inspiring.As we were participating in the Restaurant Week Dinner, we each made our own selections from the three course prix-fixe. Our waiter was very helpful, and was able to answer our questions and make recommendations with ease. As we settled into our seats for the night, water was poured into our glasses and we were presented with a generous bread basket. Sourdough slices, rolls dotted with poppy and sesame seeds, as well as ciabatta were available, which we all happily started on.At the suggestion of our waiter, I had gone with the lobster bisque for my first course. The bisque was delicious - smooth, rich, with the flavors of tomato and lobster accentuated by a subtle amount of seasoning. The several pieces of lobster that were served were fresh and although a tad overcooked, were still a delight to bite into. I would have preferred some type of garnish or green to the dish - mint, cilantro, even celery - to help balance out the richness, but it was a comforting soup to have on a winter night.For my entree, I was the only one at our table to select the short rib and, in hindsight, I believe I made the best choice. Two decadent pieces of braised short rib were placed on top of a potato and celery root puree, finished off with red cabbage and slices of mushroom. The short rib was delicious; soft, so that there was no need to use a knife to pry it apart and covered in a savory sauce. It was a treat when paired with the creamy puree, and the additional cabbage and mushrooms added both some texture and earthiness to the dish. While I can't speak for the filet mignon that the rest of my friends ordered (especially as I've never really been a steak person) they were elegantly presented and cooked to the temperatures requested.And finally, dessert. I had ordered the Chocolate Mousse Cake, unsure of what I would be receiving. The title is a little deceiving as I had been expecting more ""mousse"" and received, instead, more ""cake"". While it was perhaps a bit simple, it wasn't overly-sweet and overwhelmingly chocolate, which I appreciated. The star of the course was, however the Baked Alaska. As Delmonico's was the place where this dessert was actually created, the $5 supplement was more than reasonable. Ice cream is paired with sponge cake, encased in a shell of meringue, and then baked for a brief amount of time. The resulting creation is as perplexing as it is delightful; I couldn't help but take several spoonfuls of the slightly burnt exterior of meringue with a still-chilled interior of ice cream and soft sponge cake.At the end of the night, the four of us walked out with smiles, full stomachs, and prepared to take on the below-freezing temperatures. My recommendation? Delmonico's is certainly worth a visit, for its history, the quality of food served, and the service that it continues to deliver.",13,4,6,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827
5.0,2/23/2014,"I came here during restaurant week and was very happy with my visit.  I had the house cured bacon as my appetizer.  Succulent with a sweet glaze.  Even better with the orange slices an onions.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.My entree was the petit filet.  It was perfectly cooked, which was impressive enough in itself.  Often when I order my steak medium rare it is under cooked or over cooked.  Not the case here.  The steak's flavor wasn't exceptional on its own, but it was delicious with the sauce (something creamy that was also on the cauliflower).  I had cheesecake for dessert.  I tend to like dense rather than fluffy cheesecake, but this was good nonetheless.  The kumquat sauce was unique and tasty.I had a glass of cabernet with my meal.  I don't know what the name was, but it was the restaurant week selection, which the waiter just said was a California Cab.  Very good.The servers are very attentive.  One, Garry, was very friendly and conversational and made me feel very welcome and appreciated as a patron.",2,0,0,Candis D.,"Brooklyn, NY",63,251,77

It truly ruined the overall dining experience. The waiter could barely hear what I was saying, when I finally flagged him down.Food was served close to cold. Medium rare steak was interpreted as just simply over cooked. Bread basket consisted of stale baked goods.

There were maybe 10 people at the bar, place was not busy at all and she was running around, like she was swamped. I was a bartender for a long time, she was just a mess. She never made eye contact and it took forever to get her attention. She seemed so high stung and nervous it made me uncomfortable to even enjoy myself there and relax. She was eating behind the bar and drinking wine. Sorry, if you need to eat fine, but take a break and leave the bar, I don't need to see you shoving things in your mouth with your hands then handling my food. The only people she seemed to care about were the two alcoholics at the bar whom were gross and talking trash so loudly I had to move seats. She asked if I was ok when I moved and I said yea, it was just a little loud. Her response?? ""Well, it's a bar. Do you want a table?"" Umm no rude, I can handle a loud bar just not a drunk, whom you keep pouring more and more wine for, slurring at the top of his lungs about really disgusting stuff. Seriously, bad for business. The food was ok. Started with the hand rolled mozzarella sticks. They were too doughy. Then I had the cheesesteak. It was nothing to write home about. I came especially for it and I have no desire to get it again. The bread seemed stale, there wasn't enough onions and the meat didn't have enough cheese. Just an uneven ratio.

5.0,9/25/2013,"My husband has been here a couple times in the past & brought me here for my birthday. What a lovely treat! Delmonico's opened in 1827. History tells us that this is the first restaurant in the United States to introduce the use of a menu & white table linens. Very famous people like Mark Twain, JP Morgan and Charles Dickens have walked, sat & eaten here. It's nestled in the heart of Wall Street (right in the Financial District). The service is great, attentive, polite & friendly waiters. They serve food promptly & they wipe off every crumb that falls on the linen keeping our table clean & neat. Fresh ingredients, warm bread, and the 20 oz Delmonico steak is the bomb!!! We ordered it medium rare and it was juicy & tender! No need for steak sauce. We could hardly finish it. It had a lot of fat on it but you could trim it off. It's worth ingesting for the size & price. The decor is from a classy Victorian era. The paintings on each side of the wall represent the past generations that Delmonico's has served. The porcelain dishes, crystal wine glasses with the monogram ""D"" describes how simple yet elegant this place presents itself. There is a back room for bigger groups and a bar. We also ordered side dishes like the asparagus (was okay) and foraged mushrooms. When I asked why they called it ""foraged"", the waiter said ""I had to go to the forest to pick them up"". Funny I thought.  It was a combination of different mushrooms like chanterelle, oyster, shiitake, etc. The dish had a strong earthy taste but really good. Overall we spent about $200 without wine.

Shortly around 630PM the place really started filling up. Our waiter was absolutely professional and friendly and made us feel welcome. We started with the risotto which was a decent size portion and presented beautiful. The dish had very nice flavors and the risotto was tender and creamy the way it should be. We then had the filet mignon which I added a side of lobster macaroni & cheese. The filet was perfectly cooked, succulent and seasoned quite nicely. (Personally, I think the steak at Ruth Chris is better but that's because it came swimming in butter which I'm always a fan of.) The vegetables were well done and the mashed potatoes were superb. The lobster mac & cheese was not as cheesy as I would of preferred but there were chunks of lobster in it and it was creamy and fulfilling and had a great flavor. We finished with the chocolate cake which at that point we were stuffed but that as well was really lovely and a great way to finish the meal. Also had the wine (some variety of a white from S. Africa apparently) which was a-ok for the price. Total bill came to $124 which was about what I was expecting. I would totally recommend this for a nice dinner for business or the like.

I felt like I should be in an elegant gown not in my frilly little hippie summer dress, which put me out of place with all the other bankers that were there :) The service was fabulous and the staff was very attentive. I went with a friend for restaurant week and we both agreed that though the experience was 5 star, the food, unfortunately was not. I had the split pea soup, which was good but nothing spectacular. It was followed by their monkfish with endive salad and fingering potatoes. To be honest I thought the fish was kind of oily and the potatoes were basically swimming in oil. The endive salad...I had like one bite and left the rest. The dessert, Valhorna chocolate cake was delicious!! Perhaps I should have tried the steak, because the table next to us was filled with guys talking about how good the steak was. So if you like steak, apparently you must come here. My suggestion, come during restaurant week, that way you'll know if you like the food and can come back again.

Avocado gazpacho soup was fantastic combination which had a surprisingly strong kick.  Roasted filet mignon was not good.  Cannot order it medium rare (red center) and still be slow roasted--it was brown inside.  IMHO roasting a filet mignon is just a bad cooking method.  ["" Filet mignon is best cooked quickly with direct heat, such as grilling, pan-frying, or broiling.  Long, slow cooking -- or any kind of overcooking -- will dry out this cut, robbing not only its flavor but its tenderness, too.  Filet mignon showcases best at medium-rare to medium doneness. "" bhg.com/recipes/how-to/c… ] They did not pan sear it, and there was obviously no char characteristic of the other cooking styles.  Veggies were good, but any rub was unimpressive and did nothing to improve the meat.  For a $15 supplement (lunch for Restaurant Week  is $25, regular ala carte $48) , the Delmonico steak (20 oz boneless ribeye) was ordered rare.  It was done rare but again, no char, no high temperature heating on outside.  While the cut of filet  was fine, nice size, super tender,  the Delmonico was not so great.  Tender enough to cut with butter knife for the most part, but fair amount of gristle too.  I am not a meat connoisseur but it seemed to me I've had meat as good elsewhere.  Dessert was raspberry cheesecake which was OK, and chocolate cake.  Coffee was extra.  Service was too attentive and many pairs of eyes were upon us (and presumably others) every minute.  Décor is old school.  Some came in cutoff jeans though.  Bathroom clean and tidy.   Tab was under $100, steak was underwhelming",0,0,0,Chris L.,"New York, NY",5,117,27

It was a 10 oz, which is just way to big for me. For dessert we had a cheesecake that was pretty good too.

Thankfully the bachelor party was put in a separate room, where we were free to eat drink and be merry all by ourselves. I shared the Delmonico steak (for 2), and it was cooked perfectly. The sides are really well done too (spinach was awesome). I also like the bar downstairs, where you can get away and  get a couple drinks while you wait for dinner, or just go there to drink.

Our waiter encouraged us to take our time and was very helpful in recommending wines. Steak was phenomenal as could be expected. Although, not to sound snooty at all, but I have had better (though not much). However, I'd take the ambiance of Delmonico's over some of the few steakhouses that I do think produce better steaks, not to mention the other ones aren't even in NYC. Overall, it's a fantastic place to take a date if you have the bankroll. A large bankroll.

We both had a wedge salad and a filet and it was mediocre at best. For such a upscale restaurant we expected a lot more. We ordered a bottle of wine that we never had a chance to finish because we were rushed out of there so quickly. If it was up to them we would have finished all 3 courses in 20 min.

5.0,7/31/2013,"My boyfriend is subletting an apartment on the floors above Delmonico's restaurant. Everyday at 5pm, his apartment fills with the most wonderful smells of steak. It was only a matter of time before we caved and ate at both both the restaurant and bar. The restaurant is on par with the other high end steakhouses in NYC. What makes Delmonico's a better experience is that the restaurant has so much history.  You can't help but sit in the dining room and imagine what it must have been like at the height of NYC glamor.  The steak is a la carte. I ordered the filet mignon.  The have a variety of sides but are especially known for their different types of potatoes.  We chose the mashed and the Delmonico's (au gratin?) potatoes for the table.  The filet was like butter and well seasoned. We had hoped to order the Baked Alaska which they had apparently invented but there had been some freezer issue and all the Baked Alaska for the day had melted. Such a tragedy.  With the fine dining there was of course white glove waiter service.  They stuck a good balance of being available but not too forward.  They expect you to sit and have a leisurely meal.  The best keep secret of Delmonico's is the side bar. It has a separate entrance on Beaver Street.  The have ample seating and waiters for dining in.  They have a unique and less expensive bar menu.  We went to the bar after getting a tip to try their burger.  We followed this advice and got two cheddar burgers with fries for $17 each.  My boyfriend and I consider ourselves burger connoisseurs in the making both high end and low end. We unanimously agreed that this was the best burger we had eaten so far in our quest for burger expertise.  It literally tasted like you were eating a burger made of ground filet mignon.  The quality of the cheese and bun matched the meat.  The fries were hand cut and generously salted.    The entire plate was perfection and as a result left empty.  I don't think I will every be able to go back to eating burger of lesser quality.  I easily spend $10 fairly often for glorified fast food burgers and fries.  NEVER AGAIN.  I will always trade up for an extra $7.",3,0,0,Natalie E.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",5,63,1

I wasnt super impressed by the food. My filet mignon was kinda flat, not plump, but tasty. My mashed potatoes and veggies were like airplane/wedding food. Very thin, smooth potatoes and some carrots and green beans on the side. Meh. They guys got the ribeye ($15 extra) and it was good. (I finished his leftovers and it was a little fatty, but still tasty).

1.0,7/18/2013,"Our meal and our dining experience were totally ruined by one of your longer-term waiters.On 13 June 2013, we made an email reservation to dine at Delmonico's on 20 June for 7:00 PM at 56 Beaver St., NY. As this was our first time at Delmonicos, we asked the waiter to suggest a wine -- He refused. But his reply was, ""You have a wine list, choose for yourself"". Obviously, his reply did not sit very well with me. However, because I was entertaining my wife and a guest, I did not address the waiter's arrogance.   We then ordered appetizers. However it took forever to arrive since his main focus was on another table and completely ignoring us. When we ordered the main course, and the steak dinner arrived, one ""medium-well"" steaks was extremely rare and rubbery. So we asked the waiter to please provide my guest with the steak -- as ordered. But to our surprise, your waiter created such a loud spectacle that the rest of the restaurant patrons had no choice but to hear and stare at us. However, because it was supposed to be a special occasion for my wife and my guest, I kept my composure to not make more of a scene.While my guest waited for his proper dinner, (and as all good hosts do, both my wife and I waited for our guest's food to arrive). Needless to say, while waiting our guest's food, our own food got extremely cold. And when eventually, the waiter came back with my guest's steak, not only did it turn out to be the ""same"" steak that was rubbery and undercooked, but this time the steak was completely overcooked and char-burned at the bottom. Because I was hosting this dinner, I called for the manager to express our concerns. And while he listened deducted the price of the three steaks, his attitude was one of arrogance and indifference. It's as though he has been there far too long to provide good service. In fact, his demeanour expressed that he could care less about Delmonicos and the patrons experience. And if both waiter and manager were my employees (and I run a court building operation), they both would have been shown the door. In your handout it states that you are attempting to rebuild the Delmonico brand once again. And while this is laudable, you may want to make it a priority to instruct and educate both waiters and managers on proper customer service and etiquette. After all, is that not the reason that Delmonicos is in business, and the staff is there -- to provide professional service and give the patrons a good Delmonico experience ?  In fact, if you do not address this problem, Delmonicos will most certainly lose more patrons. We are from Toronto, Canada. And when my wife made this reservation, it was meant to be "" a particularly special celebration "" (because she has cancer). However, our Delmonico experience turned out to be a complete disaster. Not only was cutlery missing and we had to ask several times; not only was service absent and not there; not only were we neglected as patrons; not only was the food deficient; not only were we insulted when presented with the meal check, but more importantly, we were all embarrassed beyond what any words could ever express by your staff.  We set at table 22/1; our check number was 1698; the waiter I can only identify as tall, old with an accent and wearing his glasses on his forehead (Stipe G); and the manager .",12,0,0,Anne R.,"North York, Canada",0,3,0

Each bite of steak is so full of flavor and literally melts in your mouth. I always order medium rare and their steaks are always cooked to a perfect medium rare. I would recommend the signature Delmonico's Steak or the filet mignon. The steaks are so well-seasoned that there is no need to add extra salt or pepper. The steaks are perfect as plated. Aside from the steak, I would also recommend the creamed spinach and macaroni and cheese sides. The creamed spinach was deliciously creamy and flavorful and the macaroni and cheese was deliciously cheesy and creamy. The restaurant itself has a posh upper-scale look. When you walk in, you are surprised by how much space there is. The service is very attentive and the waiters are always making sure your glass is filled.

This was priced at 48 dollars. I've never had such a fatty, overpriced cut of meat at a place purporting to be a ""steakhouse."" Truly terrible. The side order of mushrooms were rubbery and overwhelmed by a seasoning that tasted like it been lifted from the Stoeffers stuffing mix.

The restaurant definitely had seen its days now it's more of the place for tourists or families who were celebrating a birthday especially in the evening. However it was a well-maintained old-school steak house. We received a very standard, slightly rushed service. The delmonico steak was better than the NY strip for sure. After having a 150 days aged steak the day before it was really unfair to compare. The steaks were nice cuts of meat and cooked perfectly. The wine list had an average selection. We had a few glasses of Cotes du Rhone which were ok.

So, I called down to the front desk for some recommendations. They told me to check out grubhub and even told me of a coupon online. How's that for awesome service at the Andaz?I got a burger and fries - I was starving and wanted something fast and something easy. I walked over to pick it up.

I know, sad story right?Luckily they participated in NYC's Restaurant Week and I made a reservation for 4 on a week night. I invited my cousin and her BF and a good friend.We decided to do the night right, and start at the bar. I had a Black Label on the rocks, and so did my cousin's BF, while my cousin had a glass of pinot noir. When we sat down, my friend ordered a bottle of the restaurant week Rex-Goliath cabernet sauvignon special.I ordered the lobster bisque, filet mignon and the mint chocolate cake for dessert. The lobster bisque didn't have as much cream as I expected, it had a very concentrated lobster flavor, yes, I approved. My cousin started with the scallops, and although they were well made, the portion was small for the value. My filet was cooked to order, I always prefer mine Medium, mMmmm. Whereas the guys decided to upgrade to the larger steak, and it turned out to be more than they needed.Now, I ordered the mint chocolate cake because I've been craving Girl Scout Thin Mints... they used yellow cake, and mint chocolate frosting... so although it was good, I feel it could've been better.Service-wise, the waiter was a bit pretentious, but I guess we were at a fancy restaurant?....nope, not a good excuse.

This groupon is the perfect opportunity for the steak lover in me to visit a proper steakhouse and the birthplace of baked alaska!"" then let me save you some time. It's not worth it. The seating at Delmonico's displayed a clear split: 4-dollar-sign-diners and groupon groupies, the choicest seating being reserved for the former. The wait staff are less than interested in you because they think their tip will be less, the seating leaves something to be desired, and the acoustics in the space create a nexus of conversational snippets that make it difficult to converse with your own dining companion.And really, the point of the entire evening, the steak, was a bit pedestrian. I've had better (and cheaper) steak in the Manhattan area and was frankly disappointed in the quality of the cut of meat and the medium preparation (I asked for medium-rare).I think the final straw was the baked alaska. It has bananas in it. The entire thing is permeated with the sickeningly sweet taste of ripe banana ester. For a banana lover, I am sure it is a dream. But there is no mention of its containing bananas on the menu, and I was appalled. I'm giving the place 2 stars because they did serve us edible food.

2.0,2/4/2013,"My second visit here and so disappointing. It's no wonder a place like this doesn't get any Michelin stars.I also was lured by the promise of the Restaurant Week special. All the best items on the menu have extra charges that add up. $20 here, $10 and $5 there, quickly pile on top of $38 ""special"". The worst thing is that the food was not that great and the service was simply horrible. Was it because of the restaurant week? Were we not good enough of the paying customers to be treated well? Was the cook on drugs throwing bad meals together?I paid $20 extra for the famous Lobster Newberg entree and they forgot to put caviar on top of it! Seriously? Caviar is one of the crown ingredients in this dish; how can you forget it? I was in shock and then I sat back for 5 minutes trying to catch the attention of our waiter who was too busy to look at us while my companion debated whether to start eating while I was also debating whether to start eating or try to find the waiter. Finally the guy showed up and took my plate back and brought it back with the caviar. OK..... I bit into the lobster tail and it was undercooked! It was raw in the middle! The waiter of course disappeared again and not once (!) came back to ask if our food was good. So I set that tail aside and ate the rest of the bland chewy dish with my mood completely ruined. After that little mattered. Not a good place to eat. Bad service, food is at best of uneven quality, ambiance is of old place where hippos come to die.

4.0,2/4/2013,"Taking full advantage of Restaurant Week, my darling and i went out for dinner at DelMonicos. The establishment was pretty busy at 530pm. We checked our coats and were seated in a nice corner booth. I really appreciated that they didnt seat someone directly on top of me until i was almost done with my meal- by then the restaurant had filled up significantly. Our server wasnt overly polite but he was very professional and I appreciated it. His service was impeccable. The Restaurant Week menu has a little bit of everything and most of the things that you really want to try come with an extra price tacked on. I ordered the lobster bisque, 8 oz filet mignon, and chocolate mousse cake. The lobster bisque had a small amount of lobster in it but packed a lot of flavor into a small bowl. The amount of soup i got was enough to give me a taste without stuffing me to the brim. Which is probably why my filet mignon only came with 3 green beans, a chopped fingerling potato and gravy. Not complaining, but it felt very ridiculous pining after three measly green beans. The chocolate mousse was very rich. I could only handle a few bites. Boyfriend started with Lobster Newberg (with a supplemental price), the short rib and celery root purree, and the cumquat cheesecake. The lobster newberg was amazing. Healthy portions of lobster meat in a creamy boozed up sauce. We both lapped up the sauce with bread and spoons. The short rib was a huge offering that I shared with him after my itty bitty steak was not enough. And the cheese cake was tasty and had a nice balance thanks to the cumquats. We ordered the special bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon. It went down nicely but gave us the worst heartburn ever later in the evening. Our total was $125.

By this time, I was so annoyed that I did not even want to complain due to their lackluster service up until this point.I simply didn't enjoy the baked alaska (you guessed it! extra $$ on top of the usual restaurant week menu).

2.0,1/22/2013,"what we ate: Restaurant week fixed menu selections of wedge salad, Delmonico steak (ribeye, $15 supplement), and chocolate mousse Upon entering delmonico's I have to say it is a very impressive and beautiful restaurant. Very old school, Victorian style which isn't really my taste, but was very pretty nonetheless. Unfortunately our friend who arrived first chose to sit in the grill area behind the bar which is a much more casual wooden area with little character. But that is her fault, not the restaurants. We proceeded with the RW menu which was available in both.Unfortunately I found the food to be very underwhelming. The wedge salad was one of the worst I have ever had. Poor quality lettuce some of which was shredded at the bottom of the bowl (reminded me of subway sandwich style lettuce, awful). Blue cheese dressing was not very flavorful and the salad had very little other accompaniments (sparse servings of bacon tomatoes and onion). I really didn't enjoy it at all. My steak came and was really well cooked (med rare +) and pretty tasty though I was constantly dragging my bites through juice on the plate to add flavor. I was also tempted to add salt and pepper but refrained. It was a large portion and I really enjoyed what I ate of it. I didn't care for the potatoes and veggies on the side which were covered in a cream sauce. The dessert was on par with the salad, not impressed at all. I was almost upset I didn't order the cheesecake until I saw it on a nearby table and it reminded me visually of a cheesecake square my office's cafeteria serves in their catering packages. My main issues were with presentation and taste. As I mentioned above their presentation sadly reminded me of cheap / fast food offerings and overall I was disappointed in the taste of 2/3 courses. the steak I had was good but no better than any other steakhouse. And when it comes to RW charging a supplement for a version of your signature item (i.e. a steak at a steakhouse) is just not ideal. Put an option in that works for you financially and the customers experience wise (petite portion, etc).

4.0,1/21/2013,"4 Stars (but really maybe 3.5, but they get the 1/2 star bump b/c it's a NYC original) So Restaurant Week - which sometimes can get pared down a bit.  Me and my buddy we both came here for RW and we ordered the classic steak - medium rare.  We split the Lobster Newberg and the scallops and we checked out the Baked Alaska and the chocolate cake thing.  So the things that cost a little extra, probably most worth the extra few bucks.  The steak being $15 extra to get it - gives you a steak probably around 18 ounces, with an amazing sear on the outside and a tender in the middle and cooked perfectly to give you a good steak.  But in my opinion and my buddy's opinion it was a little under seasoned.  The lobster newberg was buttery and flavorful, the brandy sauce was something unexpected and it stated very differently than we both anticipated.  It was really good, probably the highlight of the meal.  The scallops were 2 of them, one was seared perfectly the other was slightly over cooked and a bit chewy, but the sauces were flavorful and gave the scallops a little more depth.  The Baked Alaska - originated at Delmonico's, was a perfect example of food from a different age.  It was honestly very very good.  the cream was nice and sweet and bruled perfectly - strong flavor but not overpowering, the bananas, bread pudding like center was very distinct and added that ""woah...yum"" factor.  And it's evident that these were flavors from a different era and when juxtaposed with the rest of the meal it was a perfect marriage of flavors.  The restaurant itself is again an old school restaurant.  As much as i enjoyed myself (and i really did enjoy the restaurant) i felt a little out of place.  Shirt and slacks around power suits and power ties.  It's a classy feel that has an old school vibe.  Kinda like ""This is the Old Boy's Place"" and we want you to know that.  I felt like there should have been a cigar lounge and a whiskey bar next door with Humphry Bogart saying ""Play it once Sam, for old times sake""",4,2,2,Richard L.,"Queens, NY",842,735,14

I thought it was odd, but I waited for awhile. I asked again in about 10 minutes and was told that my boss's friend had called and she was running late. So, I waited another half hour, then another host finally agreed to seat me. As I was following him through the dining room, my boss jumped up from a table. She had been there the whole time!Now, a word about the hostess. She was wearing skin-tight stretch white jeggings, a top practically cut down to her belly button, and incredibly high hootchie-mama heels. To call her outfit inappropriate would be an understatement. Of course, the servers were falling over themselves to cluster around her any free moment they got. It would be easier to overlook her error about my party if she had presented herself more respectably and looked like she had something to do besides make the males drool.Then, the waiter was another story. I know New Yorkers like to cultivate a special brand of rudeness, but he was hostile. He flat out refused to check into a question that my colleague had for the kitchen. Then, I think he overheard us discussing his attitude, and he glared at me from across the dining room. Then he never came back; another server took over.We were not a difficult party. We are four well-educated professionals who were trying to have a nice meal. In a city with so many choices, you would think that this restaurant would try to provide a quality dining experience. Just because you've been around for a long time, doesn't mean that you can't fail.Finally, all I can say about the food was that it was fine. Not great, just okay.

I don't know how they could mess it up.  Apparently they had a holiday party which took up all of downstairs.  So we waited OVER an hour for our table.  We weren't the only ones waiting so long so the bar was overcrowded of people waiting for tables.  A pretty poor way to treat customer at a high end restaurant-The waiter seemed really rushed-Seating is packed a little too tight.  I felt like I was sitting on a nyc subwayTotal damage-Used a groupon deal I paid $100 to get a value $200 for two.  No attitude for groupon users.",0,0,0,Chi S.,"Bayside, NY",0,23,0

5.0,1/5/2013,"The best restaurant I have ever been to.Ok, so I've always wanted to go this place.  I have had a short list of famous NYC restaurants to try out that includes this place, Peter Lugers, Palms, etc.  So when a groupon came up for this place and I jumped on it.  Here we go:When we arrived, we were warmly greeted by the maitre d' and promptly seated by the hostess.  The waiter seemed pleasant at first, and seemed fine when I gave him the groupon certificate... He asked if I wanted something from the bar to drink, ""I replied no thank you, but my friend may want something when he comes from the bathroom"" and he just walked away as I was talking, obviously irritated that his gratuity was probably impacted by the groupon.  He walked up to other waiters and was complaining about groupons, saying something like ""I don't understand why we do this... we lose money..."" he did it away from our table, but I definitely noticed it.  Another waiter offered to take our table if he didn't want it, and he gave it up to him.  The new waiter comes by, was very pleasant, and explained us the menu.  The bread was nice and warm, and very tasty.Appetizers:I had the veal ragu which was good.  Not mind blowing but not bad.  My friend ordered the foie gras which I tried a bit of, bear in mind I've never eaten this before, nor did I ever think I would, but decided to try it just because it looked so good.  I could not believe how good it tasted.  I am hooked and still in awe of how good it tasted.Entrees:We both had the Delmonico Steak which is a boneless ribeye.  Ribeye is my cut of choice, but a big challenge I've discovered is that since I like it medium well, (I know that's sacreligious to a lot of people) most places cook it very poorly.  It is either too dry or burned on the outside.  This was perfectly cooked... and taste was amazing.  It came with crispy fried onions on the side which were tasty.  I let them absorb the steak juice because I wanted every drop of that delicious steak.  This steak was better than any restaurant  I have ever been to, including Peter Lugers or The Palm. Sides: We ordered creamed spinach and mashed potatoes, which were both delicious and perfectly prepared.  Dessert: Both of us had the famous baked alaska.  It was very good... I've had baked alaska many times, but it was nice to try it at the place where it was invented.  The ice cream inside was banana gelato, which I generally don't care for, but it was so good I wanted to finish it all up even though I was stuffed.  This is my new favorite restaurant.  Food was off the charts.  Menu price may seem a little high, but any other premium steakhouse is in the same dollar range.  I don't, and won't mind paying full menu if they really deliver on the food taste/quality like this place did.  I really feel like I've almost been  ""ripped off"" by other places after trying this restaurant.  The nerve of other places charging as much as here and not tasting half as good.  I'm already planning a trip back here, and I really hope it's as good the second time around.  Groupon got me in the door, and the food compels me to come back.  PS: I'm sure the waiter that gave our table up kicked himself after they saw how much we left.",0,0,0,Barry M.,"Seaford, NY",0,9,0

4.0,12/3/2012,"Our total experience at Delmonico's was positive. And the value of a Groupon cannot be disputed.The location and notoriety was our draw. Though, we've lived, worked and dined in NYC for 30 years, we'd never been.The presence and presentation is absolutely unique. We felt welcomed from the start. Waiter and all staff were amiable, polite and attentive.We were a party of three. All of us were unanimous in praise of every item we ordered and consumed. But wait...When we ordered dessert, we ordered the Hazlenut Praline ChocolateCake (misspelled on their menu!). When served, it was noticed that one of us did _not_ receive the Tahitian Vanilla Ice Cream (which was astounding). We asked our waiter and he confessed that ""Groupon"" customers do not get the ice cream... he ""made a mistake.""What else is eliminated for Groupon customers, I wondered?My findings on our experience:Shortcuts:* Bread - Reviews mention bread with butter and bacon. We saw no bacon, though bread was very good taste.* Caesar Salad - Only one anchovie. White anchovies are featured. That's right: ONE.* Chocolate Cake - Excluded the usual Tahitian Vanilla Ice Cream (as noted above)* Dessert - We were offered 3 choices: Apple Tart (not even on the regular menu); Ice Cream Sundae, and Chocolate Cake. The everyday menu offers 6.Repeat: Our experience was totally positive. In the end, we paid $248 for what would have been more than $350 for a party of three. And happy (?) to do so. Especially considering the lingering fallout from hurricane Sandy in that part of town (still, decimated and struggling). But, if you think you are getting the same thing on your plate as the Wall Street financier and client sitting next to you, wrong.Hence the 4-star rating versus 5.Above all else: All three of us ordered the Delmonico ribeye. All three agreed: Best steak ever eaten. Speaking for myself, not a single morsel remained on my plate. I've been to Luger, S&W, Morton.+P.S.

Then i got the shellfish for my app. Now for $29 i think it was small but because we were getting so much food it was the perfect amount. My boyfriend seemed to enjoy his squid ink risotto. Then the steak. I wasnt sure which steak I would enjoy the best so I got the filet mingnon and my bf got the delmonico. His was way more tasty so we swapped. It was one of the best steaks i have had. For sides we got the crab mac and cheese(AMAZING) and the hash browns which i think were to try and needed some thing. On to dessert. I have never had a baked alaska but was so excited to try it and it is now one of my new favorite desserts. The apple tart on the other hand is why i took off a star... that was just sad.

3.0,11/27/2012,"A few points of disclosure: we used a Groupon for 4-course dinner for 2 and it was a Monday.  This is important distinction to make that I felt influenced the evening.  With that, let's get into the review.Ambience was very nice.  The room was warm, crowd bustling, yet quiet enough for my friend and I to have a causal chat.  Seats were comfortable.  Maitre d' was accommodating when we arrived late (hate driving through downtown!), showed us the Delmonico's waiting room - aka bar.  Ordered two Makers old fashioned ... overly iced, overly priced (I get it...it's Wall Street area...but still).  But you're not here for that.  You're here for the food.Crab cake came out looking like the size of my italian friends' grandmother's Sunday meatballs.  This thing was the size of a softball, but did not lack in flavor.  Cutting in revealed chunks of delicious crab, satisfyingly crispy crunch, and a homemade slaw.  Veal ragu accompanied, and was ok.  Pasta was a bit over done for my liking, and felt it could've used a pinch more salt.  Very adequate portion sizes for two, considering what came next....Ordered up the delmonico and NY Strip steaks, medium rare, cooked perfectly.  Delmonico definitely had better flavor, but both were what you'd expect from a steakhouse.    Eyes might deceive you on size, but trust me: it's enough.  Sides: king crab mac and cheese and fries with spicy mayo.  Mac and cheese was an incredibly guilty self-indulgent dish in it's own right.  Big chunks of crab, though not entirely plentiful.  Great crispy top, pasta cooked just right, and delicious flavor.  Was just a tad dry for my liking, but nothing to write the accompaniment off completely.  Other side were fries with spicy mayo, sans spicy mayo since they ""ran out"".  Fries were fine: nothing to rave about.  I'm sure if it came with the condiments as listed, this portion would've been written about much differently.Finally, dessert was a cheesecake.  Crustless-bottom, though came with a few cracker/cookie side walls (couldn't place what it was).  Some indiscernable fruit and syrup drizzle across the top.  Taste was decent, but not impressive.  For me, I'd like a bit more texture, a bit more ""push back"" when my fork goes in for a bite.  If you like super whipped cheesecake, you'll probably enjoy this.  Ordered a coffee, which was poured lukewarm, and no skim milk - ""we ran out"".With all that said comes in the Groupon aspect.  I'd say most of the recent reviews here are probably fellow Grouponers trying to use their offer before it expires on the 30th.  I can easily say that the service was affected because we self-identified (as Groupon asks their users to do) at the beginning of the meal.  The table next to us sat down a good 20 minutes after us and had both bread and appetizers considerably sooner.  Our waiter was polite, but didn't convince us in feeling like we had 100% of attention or hospitality.  Not the end of the world, but I'd imagine that a steakhouse waiter would even know when they were low on sugar, let alone spicy mayo, which we mentioned specifically when ordering.  Then there was the coffee, the ""we ran out"" explanation, and again the sense that we weren't being treated as other diners.  And I might be overblowing this observation, considering that the place looked pretty busy on a Monday night.  But I can't help but feel that past let-downs from previous Grouponers had soured our waiter, which was a shame since the little things that are easy enough to deliver on is what really didn't make this experience entirely memorable.  Groupon asks that their user to tip on the value of the offer ($100), which we had EVERY INTENTION ON DOING, though isn't something they require.  When the bill comes and has an automatic 20% gratuity surcharge on it.  The evidence speaks for itself.  Verdict: food was good and recommended.  Service for the ""paying customers"", and whatever is left over for the Grouponers.",2,0,0,Wesley C.,"Westfield, NJ",77,18,0

Moreover, if you typically go to restaurants with small dining rooms (i do) be prepared to be shocked at the size, chaos and brightness of this dining room.Appetizers (tuna tartare and veal ragu) were both weak. Tuna didn't taste sushi grade and veal ragu was bland. Entrees (filet Mignon and Delmonico steak) were very good, although the filet mignon was overly salty. I particularly appreciated the char on the steaks. The wine was much better value than I expected. Deserts (apple tart and something that I can't remember) were very weak. Service was gruff, inefficient and disinterested. I can't say that I really cared about the gruffness and disinterest... what do you expect in such a huge restaurant that likely has very few regulars (at least on weekends). However, we waited over twenty minutes for our plates to be cleared and for our check. Ultimately, the experience wasn't that great, although it was interesting to check out a place I would have little interest in without a groupon.

The middle was pink and there was still a little tint of blood - perfect!The mushrooms and roasted brussel sprouts sides were pretty large and as usual, complimented the steak very well. The sides were not the best I've had but I think this was actually a good thing. Instead of detracting my attention away from the steak with fantastic sides, the mushrooms and brussel sprouts were simply complements to my meal instead of the main star. Round it out with some top quality Merlot and we were pretty content with life :)For dessert, we ordered the baked alaska and the chocolate cake. I've had better baked alaska but the chocolate cake was great! Decadent, dense but not heavy, and the wafer at the bottom gave it texture and was a nice surprise. I love the old school feel of the restaurant - the waiters and the decor fall right in line with romanticism of old wall street.

Sadly, dessert was limited by the recent hurricane, but the bread pudding and apple tart we got were still really tasty.  We were stuffed.Only downside to this place is that it's a tad pricey and the service is mediocre for a steakhouse.  Waters were luckily filled very quickly, but I felt like the waitstaff and host/hostess could have been friendlier.  Would I go back?  Probably, but I'd probably hit up Club A or Sparks before heading back here.",1,0,0,Naijia H.,"Manhattan, NY",20,90,0

2.0,11/9/2012,I was excited about dining here especially hearing good things about the restaurant. We went there for restaurant week and the service was revolving door. The interior isn't as nice as the exterior of the building. The Delmonico steak was good but not worth the extra money. Dessert was awful. I had the cheese cake and it was topped with some slimy green thing. I think it was some kind of gelatin but it was not complimentary. I don't understand why it's popular.

Fast forward to this past weekend where I met up with some friends for a steak dinner. All the food I ordered was quite excellent. The Caesar salad was fresh and made well. The king crab mac and cheese was exceptionally good although I doubt much bad could ever come from the combination of king crab legs and macaroni and cheese. My Delmonico steak however was where the meal really shone, cooked to a perfect medium rare and extremely tender and delicious. This steak certainly isn't a small portion and is by my estimation around a pound and a half. Delmonico's also earns points for its cool old school location and is a great spot to go if in the Wall Street area. Yes this is a pricey establishment and in my opinion still second fiddle to both Sparks and Luger's.

Delmonico's has a racist, discriminatory seating policy. We got there early (6:45) and the place was empty. Since most of the clientele are young White males with their blonde girlfriends and I am an old Jewish alter cocker and my wife Asian we were seated in an area where the couples were Blacks with Whites that was near the kitchen. All you could hear was the clang of silverware. Of course I asked for another table and we were seated in a small backroom with better chairs but not in the main dining room. When they tried to seat a older white couple there they declined and were told they could get a table for two in the main dining room in 10 minutes. The 21 Club has no such seating policy.

3.0,9/1/2012,"Total Restaurant Week Disappointment.An old world restaurant with good old fashioned service and good food (what I had of it), but pathetic Restaurant Week portions.  The only good part of the small portions of the appetizer and main course was that it left me room for the truly superb Baked Alaska ($5 supplement). If the purpose of Restaurant Week is to introduce people to new restaurants (this was my first time here), I felt I barely got a look inside. We sat down a nice table for four, even though there were only two of us, which is always nice.  What a lovely old world dining room with murals of old New York elegance on the wall.  Definitely a step back to a gilded age. We were given the Restaurant Week menu (dinner) and the waiter seemed in a bit of a hurry to take our order.  I asked how big the various steaks were and was told the sirloin was 10 oz. and the Delmonico (a rib eye for a $15 surcharge) was full size at 16 oz.We both decided to go with the Roasted Sirloin (as I prefer sirloin), medium rare, of course.  I chose the Diver Scallops for the appetizer and my friend went with the Wedge Salad. We were then brought a nice assortment of warm bread and rolls. Nice selection, but none were outstanding. The appetizers then came fairly quickly. The Diver Scallop (note the singular) was nice size and bursting with flavor.  Wonderful.  Unfortunately, just one.  It was more like an amuse bouche than an appetizer portion. Next came the main course soon after we finished our appetizers.  We were shocked.  The sirloin portion seemed like an appetizer.  Two pieces of sirloin over mashed potatoes with some pedestrian brown sauce on top of it.   The sirloin did seem to be medium rare.  The mashed potatoes were pretty good, but frankly, where was the beef?  Not much here.  Very disappointed.  If the steak were 10 oz., that must have included the weight with the mashed potatoes.  Well, right after we finished that, which did not take long as there were only a few bites, we were quickly delivered the dessert.  Well, at least here was something to sing about.  The Classic Baked Alaska was divine.  A thin mound of round walnut cake topped with banana gelato and coated with a mound of soft meringue.  If this were Dessert Week rather than Restaurant Week, Delmonico's would be a finalist.  My friend had the Summer Citrus Cheesecake (no surcharge), which I understand was good, but the portion was fairly small as was most of the rest of the meal.Throughout the meal my decaf coffee was constantly refilled, which always pleases me.  After dessert when I expected to be rushed out given the speed of the meal, we were able to comfortably linger and I was served more decaf.  In fact, we were not even given the check until we asked for it, which is the way it used to be and was a really nice touch.Still, unlike my Restaurant Week meal a few weeks ago at Capitol Grille, which was substantial and wonderful, this one was not very fulfilling or filling (other than the wonderful Baked Alaska).  In fact, I now so crave Capitol Grille that I may try to go there this last weekend of Restaurant Week.  I planned on going there again a week ago, but had to cancel and when I called to cancel the reservationist said that she was sure that the wonderful server I had had before, and that I requested again, would be disappointed I had to cancel.   If not, hope to go thee sometime soon.  Looking around the restaurant the regular portions looked large, but given that Delmonico's is somewhat out of my way, I just may not bother to stop in again to find out if they are worth the trip.",4,1,0,Randall S.,"Manhattan, NY",837,109,13
2.0,8/26/2012,"Went here for restaurant week with my boyfriend.  The place is grand, extravagant and makes you feel wonderful...when you walk in.  The hostess was very sweet. So we are seated and were not provided with the restaurant week menu.  Once we requested the restaurant week menu, the evening went downhill.  The waiter couldn't have been more rude and he couldn't wait to get rid of us. I had the Garganelli pasta, salmon and cheesecake.  My boyfriend had the scallop (yes they served him just 1), Delmonicos Classico and the chocolate cake.  After we ordered I went downstairs to the restroom.  Let's just say the staff is partial to men as is the restaurant overall. Ladies room is downstairs and was just awful looking, pepto color and reminiscent of my high school bathroom.  Men's room is upstairs and through French doors to the bar.  When I went to the bathroom they did not fold my napkin, when my boyfriend went, they did.  Food was mediocre even after paying extra for the Delmoico's Classico (additional $15).  Garrganelli pasta is an egg based noodle with ridges in a square shape and rolled up into a tube.  The pasta was overcooked, the sauce was too creamy and not a good flavor.  The salmon was served with chanterelle mushrooms, crab, and a butter sauce.  While the salmon was cooked to the proper temperature, the flavor was too charred and bitter.  I saw other reviewers who were served 2 scallops, my boyfriend was served one, but that one scallop was cooked perfectly.  The steak was grissley and he wishes that he ordered the filet (sorry babe).  The desserts were gross, cheesecake didn't taste like cheesecake at all and the sauce was like cinnamon syrup.  The chocolate cake tasted a lot like cough syrup.  When my boyfriend requested a second glass of wine they splashed wine all over the tablecloth because he couldn't be bothered with us and wanted to scurry away as fast as possible.I won't be coming back.  Thanks for wasting our money Delmonico's.  At least the company was good.  Also wine off the restaurant week menu was good.",2,0,0,LC D.,"New York, NY",5,58,9

The building itself looks prestigious, and upon entering, you feel like you're going somewhere high class...which I guess makes sense with all the Finance businessmen in the room. The decor was remnant of an Art museum, with multiple paintings on the wall. So when you see all this fancy stuff, you would think everything else would fall into place, but it doesn't.We waited about 10-15min to get our order taken, trying to get a waiter's attention to receive the pre fixe menu. *you have to request it or else you will only receive the regular menu. Sadly, most of the pre fixe menu items have an extra charge (about $10-15 on top of the pre fixe price), so our table stuck with the few items that were included on regular pre fixe haha. Scallops for appetizer - it was one big scallop, looked seared on top, but soft on the inside. I wasn't too fond of the accompanying taste.Filet Mignon for entree - Medium rare as requested, taste was as expected, but nothing extraordinary.Raspberry Chocolate Mousse cake for dessert - Raspberry was very sweet, mousse was fluffy, but it didn't look very complicated to make, so no reason to get excited.Overall, I felt the food could have tasted better for the price I was paying. And lastly, why this place gets two stars from me - the most important highlight of the night - I got BITTEN 5 times on my legs by MOSQUITOS!!! I think they were camping under the table cloth or something, because our entire table was getting itchy towards the end of dinner.

4.0,8/20/2012,"There is something oddly enticing about strolling into Delmonico's half an hour early for your 8 person reservation and being escorted past the old money furnishings into the backroom bar, where the bartender gives you a practically full glass of bourbon just to kill the bottle off. That copiously poured drink joins me for the rest of the evening, making sure to start the experience off rather dashingly. We were seated in the basement at one of two large chair-and-booth mixed tables for our meal with enough elbow space for twice the size of our party. Granted, this made conversation to the patrons on the other side quite difficult, but beggars can't be choosers my boy! Two bottles of Argentinean wine, featured that night, soon solved the problem of talking across the table anyways.Ahh, the revelry of the experience almost made me forget about the food. I went with the market gazpacho for my appetizer, a medium rare filet mignon for the main course, and finished the rounds with the summer citrus cheesecake. The gazpacho was uneven with lukewarm spoonfuls following cool ones, as if it was placed too close to a hot meal and never mixed. Fortunately the cheesecake was of the right temperature though it did not leave lasting impression, just neutral. On the other hand, the filet mignon proved itself the piece de resistance of the night. My knife cleaved the succulent meat like a chunky piece of warm butter before making my taste buds rejoice.Now, it must dutifully noted that Delmonico's is not just old money in aesthetics, but likewise authentic in service. The waiters hovered on the edge of rudeness that only work in an establishment of Delmonico's stature could breed, although, the boost in self-esteem that I received after manually counting out the money for our waiter because he could not figure it out himself, using a calculator no less, was worth it. Bottom line, Delmonico's is a perfect place to go during a couple of weeks a year that will allow you to safely breach the ""class warfare"" line, immerse yourself in the centuries-honed feeling of lush entitlement, and enjoy some great cuts of savory meat.",4,4,2,Rokas P.,"Alexandria, VA",40,10,0

2.0,8/10/2012,"DISAPPOINTING Service.  and *UPDATE*My philosophy on Restaurant Week is that restaurants are supposed to showcase their best...too provide a meal for those who usually cannot splurge, and to entice those who could become potential frequent clients/guests. Delmonico's and their staff really treated us like second-class citizens, from start to finish of the appalling meal.Upon arrival, we were told that we could sit downstairs or wait an unknown amount of time upstairs. Our first mistake was agreeing to sit in the very noisy lower-level. We were seated at a makeshift table directly in the doorway, next to the wine case. We were handed the menus and not even given a minute to look over before we were expected to order. We each ordered from Restaurant Week menu and their bottle of ""specialty"" wine for the week.Our appetizers arrived soon after, without a bread basket and before our bottle of wine. Bread basket arrived, still no wine. We asked. Still no wine. My boyfriend's appetizer was cleared, I asked for the wine so I could drink it with my appetizer. Just as I was about to get up to leave or find a manager, the wine arrived. I blame my boyfriend for not sending it back...it tasted like $20/4L box wine...and was unreasonably warm.Steaks arrived. My plate was hotter than anything on it. I've never sent anything back before, but I had to send this back..there was no reason for both meat and vegetables to be cold. After my boyfriend had half-way finished his ""signature steak"" that was more than half fat, my SAME steak returned a hot well-done, when I had originally ordered medium-rare. I was not happy and barely ate it., too frustrated to send it back again.Dessert service was just as disappointing. And at this point our own waiter hadn't even dropped it off, but someone who we hadn't seen before.  Sorry to write such a long entry, but I have never had such an awful experience at a restaurant, particularly one that is supposed to be so wonderful and famous.

3.0,8/9/2012,"We came here for Restaurant Week and I must say, Delmonico's, you really have a way of making cheap people feel cheap.My philosophy on restaurant week is that I'll only go to places that I'd never pay full price for. Given my phenomenal experiences eating steak in Argentina, and subsequent disappointment at the famous Peter Lugers, I've vowed never to pay premium for steak ever again.Restaurant week was my opportunity to sample what my roommate claims to be ""the best steak in NY"". So we gave it a shot.First of all, when we arrived for our reservation we were immediately ushered to the basement level, where we found 1) tourists in shorts and sneakers and 2) pimply pre-teen couples celebrating their one-month anniversary and hoping to get to third base after dessert.So who gets to sit upstairs? Why, the cigar-puffing, yacht-owning, scotch-drinking clientele that Delmonico's wouldn't be ashamed to have seen in their restaurant, of course.Most of our party ordered the scallops appetizer and the filet mignon. Both were ""good"" at best, but you could tell the filet mignon had been mass-prepared, not cooked to order. I asked for my steak medium-rare, and it was just slightly overcooked. Rookie mistake. The sauce was flavorful and the meat was tender, but the filet hardly retained any flavor on its own.To top it all off, our waiter was utterly incompetent. Obviously ticked that he got stuck on basement duty while his non-asshole coworkers were making great tips off the big boys upstairs, he was curt and rude.""I'm trying to decide between the cheesecake and the chocolate cake.

I tried to keep expectations low because other reviewers reported bad service during restaurant week, but this was not the case for us. We were a party of 5 and were seated promptly at 8pm, our reservation time. The bottle of wine for RW is $30, good value. We were seated in the baller upstairs seating area, which I was really happy about: dimmed lighting, monogrammed plates and wine glasses, all give a very plush feel. The service was a bit rushed but this is RW so that is to be expected. I did notice, as other reviewers have, that the bus staff were reaching across the table, across other diners' plates to fill water glasses etc. Food was delicious. Day boat scallops were cooked perfectly, lightly seared on outside, moist and meaty inside. The filet mignon was also cooked absolutely the way I love it -- medium rare, and was so amazingly flavorful without being overpowered by a rich sauce. We got an extra side of the mashed potatoes which were creamy and whipped-- some of the best mashed potatoes I've ever had! Desert was ok, it wasn't the best part of the meal (the steak was), but it was good. I got the citrus cheesecake and skipped the baked alaska.  While it looks pretty, the flavor does not appeal to me.

2.0,8/7/2012,"I have mixed feelings about this restaurant.  I went with a work colleague during our most recent trip to NYC, which happened to be during Restaurant Week.  One thing that I hate - HATE - about Restaurant Week is that some waiters seem to slack off on the customer service.  Do they think that, because we're in our mid-twenties and enjoying a pre-fixe dinner, that we won't tip appropriately, or at all?  If that is the case, then shame on you, Mr. Snooty Waiter.So, when we travel we have to document our expenses with receipts, which means that each of us needs our own check.  This was the first thing we asked for upon ordering.  Our response from the waiter? ""Separate checks? *eyeroll* Fine."" Seriously, dude?   RUDE.  Just rude.Then there's the food...I ordered the Lobster Newberg appetizer, the Filet Entree and Baked Alaska Dessert PLUS the Restaurant Week specialty cocktail, which I can't remember.The Lobster and Steak were great.  Perfectly portioned and cooked.  Great flavors and presentation.  I have no complaints there.The Baked Alaska had WAY too much meringue and was just...weird.  I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting, but that wasn't it.  There was banana gelato involved...I probably would have enjoyed it better with plain vanilla.  But at least I gave it a try.The drink tasted like cough syrup...actually...it was worse than cough syrup.  It was just bad.  Very, very bad.I don't know...I want to give it a higher rating because the food was good, but the service definitely left a bad taste in my mouth.",4,0,0,Danielle Y.,"Gaithersburg, MD",218,15,1
5.0,8/7/2012,"We went to celebrate my birthday amd were very pleased. Nice crowd for a Monday, but we got seated fast. We shared the pasta and lobster for the apps. Both were great. We both had the delmonacos steaks for dinner. Very tasty. Whatever dry rub they used charred well and made a great coating. Only complaint was that we both ordered medium and the bfs came out way redder then mine. Desert was baked alaska. Very tasty. The food was great, but we loved the atmosphere and service. It's very pretty and tasteful inside. The service was also good. The general manager hung out with us at the bar on his break and was kind enough to give us a round and show us the rooms we could use to book parties.

4.0,8/7/2012,"Came here for dinner during restaurant week and order off their restaurant week menu. I got the scallops, filet mignon, and cheese cake. The portions were on the smaller side but it was filling. They also offered upgrades for supplemental cost which is great option. A person in my party upgraded to their classic steak which came out amazing. Perfectly charred on the outside and medium rare on the inside on a high grade piece of meat.The food was well executed and i think it's representative of the food they normally serve unlike some other restaurant week menus. Definitely a great deal for restaurant week and overall a great spot for a great steak, definitely exceeded my expectations.",0,0,0,Quan T.,"Bronx, NY",0,3,0
5.0,8/6/2012,"This review is ONLY for the Bar and Grill - I have never eaten in the restaurant. I have to say the bar is one of the classiest in NYC and I've never gotten anything but superb service there. I have brought groups as large as 25 (during the early afternoon), and as small as two, and we have always been served with speed, courtesy and the kind of excellence you rarely encounter at a NYC bar these days, whether it was just the two of us or a huge group taking up the entire bar. Drink prices are about the same as any other NYC establishment - my perfectly-poured pint of Guinness was about $6. Bar food and snacks are a bit pricey, as you would expect from such a famous kitchen, but the guys told me their steaks were superb, the best they'd eaten (I have not actually eaten anything here, just had drinks). Another wonderful benefit of Delmonico's Bar is that it is blessedly quiet on Saturday evenings, as this is a slow night for the Financial District. They don't play loud music, occasionally there is sports on the flat-screen televisions, but never at an obnoxious volume. I consider this place a hidden gem - compared to the bars on nearby Stone Street or Fraunces Tavern, it has such an elegant, upscale vibe. I think people don't realize it is there or think it is another entrance to the very upscale and rather expensive dining room. Even during the weekdays, it's never crowded, and then only with affluent stockbrokers in suits who are a far cry from the noisy, obnoxious frat boys and bros you find at many other bars. They do play music during weeknights, although it's not at a very loud volume, but I still tend to avoid it during the week and patronize it on week-ends or before 8 p.m.,, as it's very hard to find a quiet bar at which you can talk to friends instead of shouting. I love this place - perfect bar for quiet conversation!",0,0,0,Rachel K.,"New York, NY",4,38,1
1.0,8/5/2012,"Steakhouse....in the city. Can be that badd, right?Food:Got the gazpacho for the first time, a light cold soup.... It was quite refreshing. As an entrée, I decided to go with the classic Delmonico steak. It was in between your typical good quality steak and the kind you get at Applebee's. So therefore, nothing amazing but definitely beats your TGIFriday, Outback and Applebee's. For dessert, I regretfully chose the cheesecakes. As a fan it cheesecake...it sucked!! Texture and flavor were way off.Service:They had a section in the lower level of their building so my group and I received a table once everyone got there. We ordered our drinks and food expecting some good service like in any other restaurant. Got our appetizers right away, so one star for them. Good for them... Unfortunately their service couldn't hold up. Basically everything went downhill from here, the service mixed up our orders, had to wait for 5 min to get a waiter to fix it, another 10 for them to get it right, waiter only asked half the table if everything was alright, waiter never came around again to check on us so I was not able to get my steak sauce till I finished half of my steak, and finally when asked to get the bill.... It took us two ties and 20 minutes till we finally got it ( because no waiters were around half the we're there.) -actually I see them behind the curtains in the kitchen eating the same cheesecake they serve to us....just scarfing them down.I could continue to go on about the ambience...but why bother. I would not recommend nor go to this place myself in the future.(the star applies only to their steak, like stood out and shined from everything else)",3,1,0,Richard K.,"New Hyde Park, NY",6,22,35

My sister ordered the watermelon gazpacho, salmon entree, and cheesecake. The chocolate cake was the right amount of sweet. The cheesecake had lime flavoring on top so it was tarty still tasty though. All the portions were small but tasty. We left the meal full but not stuffed. The atmosphere was definitely out of my league. The table next to us were talking about $14 million dollar houses, etc. Lots of finance people here for dinner. Also, definitely for the older crowd.

2.0,8/3/2012,"Really unimpressed with our meal last week.We went for Restaurant Week Summer 2012 and after paying $132 total, we were left wanting more. The diver scallops should have been better seasoned, the steaks were just fine (and their sides were unimaginative) and dessert, my FAVORITE part of a meal, was awful! The baked Alaska had far too much merengue and our citrus cheesecake was luke warm.The only good parts of our meal were the garganelli pasta and the restaurant week wine. My advice?

3.0,8/3/2012,"So I came here for Restaurant Week, and really, that should tell you everything you need to know. I read the reviews prior to going and wasn't expecting good service and there were no surprises. If I could I would rate this place 2 1/2 stars.They sat all the RW people in a separate room downstairs. The room was still very nice, but separating us from everyone else was low. No one ever checked on us after we received our dishes, we were never asked if we wanted anything else or how our food was. At one point my friend was scooping some creamed spinach onto my plate when the waiter brought his steak. My friends arm was blocking the space where his plate would go, and instead of saying excuse me, or waiting the 5 seconds for my friend to move his arm, the waiter TOSSED the plate over his arm and onto the table, spilling steak juice all over it, and abruptly walked away without a word. I've never seen such rude service from a waiter and there was absolutely no reason for it. Unbelievable. As for the food, I was underwhelmed. I ordered the lobster Newburg which was just alright. The lobster could have been more tender and the sauce itself didn't wow me in the flavor department. My friend ordered the scallops. They were actually a good size and very tender and delicious (he was generous enough to share with me), but there were only two. It was a comically small portion. The desserts were not good across the board. My first issue is that their online menu differs from their actual menu selections, and the hazelnut praline chocolate cake was replaced by a mouse-like chocolate raspberry and black currant concoction that most people at the table ordered but no one finished. They also left one person at our table without their dessert for a good 10 minutes till we flagged them down and reminded them. I got the baked Alaska and really, I wouldn't have served that to people in my home. This one I'm willing to chalk up to a lack of personal taste, however I can see all those ingredients and flavors working together wonderfully under different circumstances. I felt it was too sweet and when the flavors did break through the sugar they were contrasting rather than complimenting each other.  Apparently they invented this dessert, so I'll say they very may well know what they're doing- decide for yourself.The reason I'm giving them 3 stars and not 2 is for the entree, the real reason anyone goes to a steakhouse- the steak. The filet mignon specifically. It was cooked just right, melt in your mouth softl- but still not better than Peter Lugers. If we're going to compare, lets compare, because I can get a better steak with no attitude there. Ahem. Anyway, the potatoes that sat under the steak were fan-freakin-tastic. Maybe it seems silly to rave about potatoes but I'm doing it anyway. They were creamy and rich and gave me fleeting thoughts of buying the cookbook. Their creamed spinach was also delicious, and the portion was massive. We actually passed it around the table so everyone could have some and still ended up with leftovers. So here's my verdict: I'm never coming back. Not during restaurant week, not during any week. My money is as good as anyone else s, if you don't want me there I don't want to be there- and maybe if I'm that unwanted don't invite me in the first place. There are better steakhouses for my money and that's where I'll be.",4,0,1,Luci B.,"Queens, NY",149,1401,3214
4.0,8/1/2012,"What an awesome surprise! I had no idea this place existed. Shame on me! For an Upper West Side dweller, former Brooklynite, and native NJ gal, I never come to downtown, so I had no idea this landmark restaurant was here.It's an old-fashioned historic steakhouse restaurant that lives up to its great reputation. The service was great. The steak was great. The salmon I ordered was great. The flavors were all so unique and delicious. Nothing bland on anyone's plate.My only little complaint is that the steak my husband ordered medium rare was a little bit on the too raw side (which I love but my husband doesn't). Oh, and my salmon was a little too cooked (I was never asked how I wanted my salmon. A bit upsetting, since I like my salmon a certain way.)In the end, tourists and locals alike: eat here!

3.0,7/26/2012,"Delmonico's remains the best ribeye steak I have ever had. Their service, however, is a nearly appetite-ruining disaster. I've been to Delmonico's once before also during Restaurant Week. We went on a slow day and the service was decent, though nothing spectacular. The steak was huge. It filled up my plate and melted like butter when cut. It was immediately without a doubt, the best ribeye steak of my life. The second time we went, the service was horrible. It was one of the worst service experiences ever. We arrived at 7:05, was seated at 7:15, received our water and was left with the menu for twenty minutes. I want to know who in the world takes 20 minutes to order. Even Meg Ryan didn't take 20 minutes in When Harry Met Sally. So we ordered at 7:35, and at 8:00pm, they brought not our appetizers (finally!) but our steaks. Our shriveled and overdone steaks. I asked the server about our first course, and he took back the steaks and brought out our appetizers without so much as an apology. My scallops were the size of quarters. And having been sitting at the window for so long to be picked up, they were dry and lukewarm. There is just no standard for the quality of food anymore at Delmonico's, which is something that seems to happen to a lot of great restaurants after they earn the prestige and ratings. At 8:15pm, they brought our steaks--this is an hour after we were seated. Our steaks were the same ones as the steaks they tried to bring us before our appetizers. We hadn't touched them, but you could tell they were the same. We cut into the steaks and it was tough, hard to chew, harder to swallow, and had little taste. It was incredibly disappointing. By then, my anger had gotten the best of me. We were given poor service, had to wait an hour, I put up with a lukewarm shriveled appetizer, but my steak? Do not mess with my steak. I am not paying a $15 surcharge on my restaurant week bill so you can screw up my steak and not take any responsibility for it at all. I don't think so. We called our server over (who never once checked up on us to ask how was the food, the steak, the anything) and told him our steaks were overcooked. Probably because it was left to sit at the pickup window for an eternity while they were busy screwing up our dinner. He took the steaks back and had the kitchen prepare new steaks. I was stewing in my anger, just stewing. Just keep in mind that our waiter never once showed any attentiveness or responsibility for the restaurant's poor service. The kitchen is not to blame. The kitchen does not put out cold food and leave steaks to sit and dry out. Finally, our steaks arrived, this time they were bigger and looked more like the steaks I had the first time. We cut into our steaks and in the middle of my anger, I took a bite... and felt my anger slip from me like a guinea pig in a pet store. I tried to cling on, I really did, but the steak is just so damn good. When cooked right, Delmonico's Steak is still the best. It still melted in my mouth and had the great buttery and charred flavor I fell in love with. I just couldn't say no. When our server finally came to ask how things were, I mentioned that we waited an hour for our entrees, but couldn't bring myself up to rant the way I was so ready to mere minutes ago.So, yes. The signature steak is magical. It's just pure deliciousness on a plate. Don't even bother with side dishes, they'll just distract you (or try to, rather). The terrible service could ruin your meal and experience, but stick it out until the steak arrives. I didn't feel very generous in my tipping (we were told ""Don't worry, we'll take care of you,"" by a manager, which apparently means ""I'm going to walk away now and not come back."") The managers and waiters are not friendly or very good. Nor do they know the definition of customer service; there's a lot of work needed in that area, but not with the steaks.If it weren't for the noteworthy, blood-pressure raising poor service, the steak alone would earn them full marks.",0,0,0,Grace C.,"Manhattan, NY",3,12,7
4.0,7/26/2012,"Delmonico's is a classic, old-style NY steakhouse. My girlfriend and I went for her birthday dinner and to take advantage of the restaurant week pricing. The food was outstanding, especially the filet mignon, which was cooked at medium-rare perfectly. The portions were decent and filling, too.My only complaint is that the lighting on the lower level does not make for a romantic or ""upscale"" restaurant atmosphere. We were seated directly under a flickering fluorescent bulb that was annoying, but we eventually got used to it.If you plan to make reservations, ask to be seated upstairs for a more enjoyable environment.

2.0,7/26/2012,"I came here for restaurant week, and let me just say that it was severely disappointing. I was initially attracted to the diverse menu posted on nycgo.com. However, upon arrival, my party and I realized that some of the items were different (not in a good way); mostly, the dessert items on the menu at the restaurant were not as ""impressive"" as those listed online. Yet, we did not let that deter us from having a nice evening. I would rate this place 2.5 stars for the following reasons:1.  Portion sizes: Now I'm a realist, and I know when you're paying $35 for 3 courses at a steakhouse, don't expect huge portions. But these were ESPECIALLY small! My diver scallop appetizer consisted of two scallops the size of quarters, while my friend's wedge salad was 1/4 the size of a true wedge. When I went to Ruth's Chris in midtown for restaurant week last week, their portions were so large I had trouble finishing them. RC depicted an 8oz filet on their menu as well, just as Delmonico's did. However, I am pretty convinced Delmonico's filet was 5oz AT BEST, and barely an inch/inch and a half thick (in comparison to the true 8oz filet I got at RC that I could not even finish).2.  COLD STEAKS: ALL 3 OF OUR STEAKS CAME OUT COLD!! Firstly, I asked for mine ""pittsburgh,"" which means a charred outside with proper cooking on the inside, to which the waiter responded ""Mam, all of our steaks are pittsburghed."" Let me just say, that steak was NOT pittsburghed! When we requested our steaks sent back b/c they were cold, the waiter copped a slight attitude. Then our steaks came back HEATED UP! I'm sorry, but I don't care if you're paying $35/plate or $350/plate, you do NOT send back the same steaks (that had our previous cut marks in them) heated up!! YOU GET A NEW STEAK b/c it causes the steaks to be OVERCOOKED! I was heavily irritated at that. Plus, the meat itself wasn't anything special in the taste department.3.  Crappy dessert: not much to say here, except their dessert was disappointing. The ""chocolate cake"" I got was some sort of raspberry/chocolate mousse concoction, not a steakhouse chocolate cake. Additionally, my friend's cheesecake had some sort of disgusting green limey gel on top of it. It was just...not good.The reason for the .5 star upgrade in my 2.5 star review is because eventually the waiter seemed sincerely apologetic for our cold steaks. He informed the manager and we received a free bottle of wine and an extra Baked Alaska dessert. While that was handled well, I just cant give this restaurant 3 stars based on the quality of food and the overall experience.The decor was extremely nice and inviting, despite being a tad too loud (the place was packed at 6:30 on a Wednesday). Perhaps try going here on a non-restaurant week excursion for a better experience.",1,0,0,Nicole F.,"Houston, TX",1,13,1

We all had the watermellon gazpacho, which had ceviche tasting shrimp in it! The sirloin steak was amazing!!! Sliced and perfectly medium rare with a wine reduction sauce over this delicious cream of potatoes. I want more of it! Now! The dessert was great too. I had the lemon cheesecake, which was smooth and light - tasted like key lime pie! We also tried their baked alaska, which is one of their many signature dishes which they are famous for creating. (Home of the first eggs benedict)!

Our waiter never came over to ask us how our meal was once our entrée had been dropped.  Finally, our waiter decided to completely ignore our request on how to divide the check when we handed him 2 credit cards, and instead simply split the bill down the middle.Service that awful doesn't happen often, and I didn't expect it from Delmonico's.",2,0,0,Zachary B.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,4,0

We came here for dinner during restaurant week on a Thursday. We had a reservation for 8 but weren't seated until 8:15 or 8:20. The main dining hall looks like classic New York but we were seated downstairs where there is much less decoration and more noise. The waiters seemed a little harried but that was to be expected. For the appetizer, I had the gazpacho with shrimp. It tasted great with a surprise kick I appreciated. I followed that with the filet mignon which was served with fingerling potatoes in a cream sauce and green beans and carrots. The filet was cooked and seasoned well. I had the baked alaska for dessert. It was a $5 supplement but I couldn't pass it up! The banana gelato was very flavorful, so much so that some may not like it but I loved the combination of banana, almond, apricot and the creaminess of the meringue. We had a great deal for restaurant week so the little things can't dock too much from the overall.

5.0,7/20/2012,"Out of the office before 8pm for the first time in seven weeks, I felt so grateful to eat from a plate instead of a plastic takeout container.  Grabbing a few friends and an existing open table reservation, we presented ourselves in front of Delmonico's, ready to stuff our faces with steak.  With a beautiful, antique-like interior, Delmonico's was certainly impressive in regards to size and decor.  Our waiter briskly brought us to our already set table: a perfect round one for seven.  A gorgeous breadbasket was placed in front of us, and we were treated with real silver forks and knives--well so a friend claimed.All of us were college students or recent graduates, but we did not cease to spend.  Each person indulged in the restaurant week menu; personally, I started with the scallops, then the filet mignon and finally the baked Alaska.  The preparation of the scallops got applause from the entire table.  Though a scanty portion presented on a big plate, the scallops made up in texture what they lacked in size.  Wrapped around a tender center was a slightly chewy charred exterior, the scallops presented a complex mixture of textures that playfully danced around my excited tongue.  The slightly citrus sauce with the mushrooms plated across the plate, it was certainly exquisite.  The filet mignon was perfect.  Cooked medium well, something my dear mother would certainly disapprove of (what the heck are you doing eating raw meat?), the meat was braised on a flavorful (but not heavy) sauce and complemented by slow-roasted potatoes and a few decorative vegetables.  I tried my friend's roast chicken, and it was the most juicy, most tender chicken I had ever tasted, such a gem in itself.  Soon, dessert came by.  My long-waited baked Alaska--invented here--came perfectly browned in meringue.  Somehow, I don't understand how this meringue was made; there must be a lot more than simply egg whites and sugar and air as the meringue held up so well even as I smashed it unkindly with my hungry spoon.  Inside of the baked Alaska was walnut cake and banana gelato, both ordinary in taste, however unique the concept.Parting thought: A meal I'll always remember.  One of my restaurant week favorites.",0,0,0,Buggy Z.,"Cambridge, MA",242,307,748

2.0,6/22/2012,"My friend chose Delmonico's for our second place for restaurant week. I got so excited reading the reviews and dreamed about amazing mind blowing medium rare steak. They let me down though! I can't remember what I had for appetizer and dessert, but the filet mignon I ordered for the main course was... meh. It was cooked medium rare just the way I liked it, but it was so bland! I couldn't taste any flavor; was there any marination or seasoning? Salt?? The red wine was nice though.

5.0,6/17/2012,"This place was perfect in terms of flavor. My cousin got the filet, and I got the signature delmonico/boneless ribeye. Just the right amount of crisp and seasoning (salt and pepper - nothing fancy - they respect the meat), and just the right temperature when the plates arrived. The meat was well rested and cooked just right. The filet was ordered rare, and the ribeye was ordered medium. They were both delicious. The strip I had on my third visit was amazing as well. Cooked a little under from what I ordered, but I kinda knew it would come out like that so I went with it, and I enjoyed it.

3.0,4/23/2012,"A fairly solid experience on a quiet Monday night.  We started the night at the restaurant bar while we waited for my co-worker's girlfriend.  The bar was fairly quiet and our drinks were made fairly quickly.  They didn't make my drink exactly as I like it (Sapphire & Tonic with 3 olives), but I let it go and we chatted until our friend arrived.We all ordered appetizers and more drinks.  They goofed my drink again, but this time I had them fix it.  My wife got the special soup (New England clam chowder) which was OK.  I got the braised veal and scallops.  The veal was a bit chewy for my tastes, but the scallops were very well made.  I would definitely recommend this dish to scallop lovers.  My co-worker got the Ceaser salad and he said it was one of the best he has had.  His enthusiasm died down as he went along, but he definitely finished it on a positive note.  I ordered the rib-eye (""delmonico"") rare and it came out perfectly cooked.  The flavors were spot on and I didn't need to add any pepper, etc.  I would rank this steak above the delmonico at the Capital Grille and the Rib-eye at Edward's but below the prime meats at Quality Meats, DelFrisco's, etc.  I think the biggest letdown of the evening was the lobster newburg.  Both the ladies ordered the dish and I found it to be extremely lacking in flavor.  The sauce was boring and there was a slight fishy feeling to the dish.  I recommend sticking to the steak.  The sides were good.  The fries were tasty and the creamed spinach was creamy and tasty.  A little too creamy, even for creamed spinach, but not overwhelming.  The asparagus was mediocre and over priced.  I would recommend avoiding that one.Dessert was fine, not memorable.  Some confusion between our table and the staff led to us having 3 bowls of 3 different ice creams.  I shared a chocolate cake dish with my wife, and it left no lasting impressions.  The price is comparable to other NYC steakhouses, and if you have some absurd list like I do, definitely try this place; just don't put it at the top of your list.",1,0,1,Farhan A.,"Jersey City, NJ",63,7,0

Dinner started with a bread basket (olive, onion, wheat.) I believe the butter was sprinkled with sea salt.  We both ordered the sweet potato soup with crab.  Had nice large pieces of crab and was very rich.  Our main course was the t-bone special, lobster newburg, and a side of brussel sprouts.  When the entrees came out they had split the lobster onto two separate plates.  I never had lobster newburg before.  It was a nice dish, but I probably wouldn't get it again.  The steak was cooked to my liking (medium) and had a nice char and flavor.  I usually don't eat brussel sprouts, but these were actually really good.  We ended the meal with the baked Alaska and chocolate caramel brulee cake.  The baked Alaska was good, but the brulee cake was too sweet.  If you have a healthy appetite like we do, plan to drop at least $200.  All our food including my two glasses of champagne was about $230.  Worth it for a fancy date night out or spending time with friends or family.",2,1,1,Judy I.,"Jersey City, NJ",7,56,17
4.0,3/11/2012,"After debating over a million choices in restaurants for Restaurant Week, my friend and I decided on Delmonico's. We had heard of this old school steak house as being amazing. It is actually known for being the first restaurant in New York. Originally starting as a pastry shop, and eventually ballooning into a world renowned steak house. Located in the middle of the financial district and old Manhattan, you won't be surprised to see it filled with business men and financial guys out with clients. For restaurant week you can't go wrong by going to a steak place because at most other restaurants, steak dishes are always supplemental fees. At that point, what is the point of restaurant week if you have to pay extra for all the ""good"" dishes.I have to say that all in all the food was outstanding, even down to the bread basket at the start of the meal. It came out very soft and warm, straight from the oven. They were also willing to give us a new basket once ours became cold. Usually I try not to fill up on too much bread before the meal, and try to stick with one piece, but this bread was so good, that I had to have two! The butter was extremely creamy with sprinkles of brown sugar on top, which I would have never thought to put on butter, but what a great idea! It added some sweetness to the already carbo-loading damage I was doing to my body.For my starter, I chose the 1867 Classic Lobster Newberg, that was served in a Brandy, cream and caviar reduction. This starter had a supplemental fee of $10, but was well worth it. There was a very generous portion of lobster and it was extremely fresh and deliciously drizzled in the cream sauce. It was a party in my mouth! This was offered in an entree size also for the meal, but I decided I had to have steak for the meal and go for this for my appetizer. Surf and Turf!For dinner, I ordered the 8 oz. Filet Mignon. It was served with mixed vegetables and mashed potatoes. The steak was cooked to perfection and was just the right amount of steak. The vegetables were also very nicely seasoned. The steak was served on top of the mashed potatoes, which gave the mashed potatoes an amazing flavor because they soaked up all the juices from the steak.For dessert we ordered two desserts to share. We had the Classic Baked Alaska, which had a meringue coating with walnut cake and banana gelato on the inside. There was apricot jam on the outside of the dessert and some on the inside giving it a moist and fruity taste. The banana gelato had an intense banana flavor. I almost would have preferred another flavor of ice cream, perhaps something with chocolate, raspberries, or strawberries in it. Banana is something that not all customers like, so I thought it was weird that this was the flavor of ice cream they were serving. Our second dessert, the Tiramisu, was very delicious! I feel like its hard to serve a bad tiramisu. It had the intense espresso and chocolate flavor that I love in tiramisu. It was extremely moist and spongey like tiramisu should be! I liked that they served it with some caramel drizzle on the bottom of the plate for dipping :)",1,0,1,Carlen M.,"Manhattan, NY",370,97,473

2.0,2/17/2012,"I was there for a group dinner with a fixed menu, but really that shouldn't affect a good restaurant's quality of food. Started with a Caesar Salad, which was fine but perfectly forgettable. Then came the filet. It was one of the worst filets I've had. It was fatty . And not the good kind of fat that provides flavor -- the tough sort that you have to spit into your napkin. But that wasn't the worst part. The waiter didn't ask how well we wanted the steak cooked. And I like my steak medium rare, but they served what was basically a seared piece of raw meat. It was literally purple when you cut into it. So I had to send it back, as did others in the group.Finally the dessert I chose (which was the best option provided) was a sort of weird mocha cheesecake. This just doesn't work as a concept. The mocha overpowers the relatively subtle taste of a cheesecake, so it's like eating coffee ice cream. But the actual dessert itself was also meh for its own sake. It basically consisted of some weird mocha cream layer on top of a mediocre piece of cheesecake with a custard-like consistency. After living in NYC for 6 years and visiting countless great restaurants, my advice would be not to waste your time here. There is so much better. This place might have been great once, but it certainly isn't now. I gave it two stars instead of one generously, mostly based on the fact that it was part of a meal organized for a group in its private room -- but as I said at the onset that shouldn't affect the quality of a good restaurant's food.",1,0,0,Dan I.,"Burbank, CA",34,72,26
2.0,2/15/2012,"2 stars, because overall, I'd rank it slightly below the average nice NYC steakhouse.  The phrase Yelp assigns to the 2 star category is ""Meh. I've experienced better"" -- my thoughts exactly.Went here last night for Valentine's Day (our mistake -- we should've known it would be packed).  We were greeted promptly and I noticed how nice the ambience of the dining room was, with soft classical music and pretty decor, and looked forward to being seated.  Rather, we were shown to a table downstairs in an annex room that looks like it's used for private events, and unfortunately, it was the exact opposite of the main dining room - very loud, crowded, with ""adult alternative"" music blaring (seriously so loud) on the speakers, and with a small lamp on each table serving as the only decor.  Not what we were expecting.  After being seated and asking (and waiting a long time) for a wine list, our orders were finally taken.  We ordered our wine, apps, steaks, and dessert (because the day's dessert special required an advance order as it took 20 minutes to prepare).The appetizers came out promptly -- too promptly, in fact.  We were halfway finished with them before we finally received our wine.  We had tuna tartar and the iceberg salad, both of which were really quite good.  For our entree we ordered the porterhouse for two, with sides of creamed spinach, brussels sprouts, and mashed potatoes.  We waited....and waited....and waited....the table next to us, who ordered just moments before us, finally received their porterhouse for 2 so we assumed it wouldn't be much longer.  It was.  It took nearly 45 minutes total, and only appeared after we asked the waiter if it'd be much longer.  Because of the ridiculous wait, at least he was kind enough to offer glasses of wine on the house, which was nice.  Our steak was delicious, if not cooked perfectly -- we ordered medium rare and the strip was mostly medium rare but the filet side was easily medium with some parts bordering on medium well.  At that point we did not feel like waiting any longer so just ate it, and regardless of the temperature, it - and the sides - were really tasty.  The steak was flavorful and the sides were really yummy, especially the creamed spinach.  It's just a shame it took so long.We were looking forward to our dessert - chocolate souffle - which we'd ordered in advance as instructed by the menu.  Instead, we waited, again, for ages, for our waiter to realize we were finished eating.  He finally had our plates cleared and asked us if we'd like dessert -- clearly, he'd forgotten to order it.  We reminded him of our souffle order, and he apologized and promised it would be out in 10 minutes (despite the advised 20 minute cooking time).  Fifteen minutes later it appeared, and it was clear it could've used the full 20 minutes.  A souffle should be light and fluffy -- this was completely gooey, with very little, if any, cooked parts around the outside.  I absolutely love gooey chocolately desserts, but not when it's like eating raw batter with a spoon.  It was disappointing.And again - you guessed it - we waited....and waited....and waited before we could get the server's attention and ask him for our check (he was busy engaged in a conversation with a co-worker on the other side of the room with his back toward us).  It's a shame the service was bad and the ambience was terrible, because the appetizers, steaks, and sides were delicious.  There are better steakhouses in NYC in which to drop $250+.",1,0,0,Katie B.,"Southern Pines, NC",0,9,1

3.0,2/9/2012,"Came here yesterday with my girlfriend for Winter RW.  We've never been here before but I've been to other well known steakhouses.  When you walk in, the first thing you notice is that it has a very classy interior - perfect for a special ocassion.  For some reason, it reminded me of the 18/19th century with all it's furnishings.  We ordered:Appetizers - Diver Scallops with Braised vealand Lobster Newberg.Entrees - Braised Beef and Filet MignonDessert - Salted Caramel Chocolate Brownie Cake, and some Raspbery Cheesecake that was not on the original RW menu. 2 glasses of the RW week red wine.Both appetizers were delicious.  Scallops were cooked perfectly with a sweet potato puree and the veal was very tender.  The lobster was a great portion and it was tasty as well.Entrees were a different story.  The filet was a great size and it was tender and delicious.  It came with some vegtables and mashed potato.  The braised beef was not as tender as I imagined and it lacked flavor.  I was not impressed and regret ordering it.  The desserts were delicous, but nothing special.  Overall, it was a nice dinner but was not blown away.  Service at first started very slowly but then picked up.  We left full so that says that the portions were a good size for the average person.  I give it 3 stars because I was not blown away from the food.  Also, this is for RW only, not sure how it is for other days, but I don't see why it should be any different.  Other steakhouses have tastier dishes.  If anything, Delmonico's decor is beautiful and would give it 3.5 stars if I could.",0,0,0,Douglas K.,"Queens, NY",145,562,1
2.0,2/7/2012,"A group of four friends and I went here last Thursday for Restaurant Week.  I am giving Delmonico's two stars, one of which is my way of giving them the benefit of the doubt since it was Restaurant Week.  The experience I had there would have otherwise been worthy of only one star.We had made a reservation for five a week earlier for 7:15 on a Thursday night.  While one of our party members arrived about five minutes late and the traffic increased significantly between 7:15 and 7:30, there is no excuse for not getting seated until after 8:00 with a reservation.  Twice I asked when we could expect to be seated and both times I was told our table was being prepared as we spoke.  We were approached around 7:45 and asked to follow to our table for four, to which we responded that we were a group of five, just as our reservation stated, and ended up waiting nearly 20 minutes more.Once we were seated, without any apology for the delay, if our waited showed any acknowledgement toward our table, it was hard to tell.  Our party was pretty hungry by this point after waiting 45 minutes longer than we expected and we had all looked over the menu before, more or less deciding what we were going to eat, so having to wait an additional 15 minutes to order wasn't exactly ideal.  Considering how busy the restaurant was, I will say that once we had ordered, the time for the food to come out to the table was not too long.  By this point, after all the waiting, I had expected the food to take forever as well, so I guess that was some sort of silver lining to our dining experience.Again, I'll attribute part of this to the fact that it was Restaurant Week, but I was not impressed by the food at all.  Everything was good, but nothing really stood out or showed any real creativity.  I started with the diver scallops and braised veal, which was well-prepared but uninspired.  My thoughts were echoed by both the diners who also got the scallops as well as those who ordered the chowder as their appetizer.  For the entree, I ordered the filet, which came over whipped potatoes and an assortment of vegetables (i.e.; a few carrots and string beans).  The filet was just ok; by far the least flavor of the numerous higher-quality establishments at which I've ordered a filet.  It also seemed that there was no discernible difference between those of us that ordered medium rare and those that ordered medium.  The table also debated whether or not the potatoes were freshly-made or of the store-bought variety.  Finally, for dessert, the table split between the mousse cake and cheesecake.  Both were tasty, but again, lacked any sort of creativity behind them.Once we finished our meal, it took numerous efforts to get our waiter's attention to deliver the check.  Looking it over, we were mistakenly charged for a bottle of wine when only one person had a single glass.  No apology was offered - the waiter took our check without saying a word and returned the corrected bill.  I understand that the restaurant was extremely busy and perhaps understaffed by a waiter or two, but that is not an excuse for cold, unfriendly service.  In fact, this seemed to be a theme of all the staff with which we dealt.Perhaps these bad experiences were influenced by it being Restaurant Week, but for an establishment with a reputation like this, that cannot be used as an excuse.",0,0,0,Jonathan W.,"ASTORIA, NY",32,67,2

Most of the time I remember the ambiance of the restaurant(s) I try during Restaurant Week, but the meal itself doesn't leave a lasting memory.That changed with my visit to Delmonico's. I've never used the term ""melt in your mouth"" with meat before but their 24 Hour Braised Beef was truly ""melt in your mouth"" good. The only change I would have made to my meal is picking the ""Baked Alaska"" for desert - our waiter told us that the dessert originated there so take note. The service is seamless and no-nonsense. A very classy establishment that you can wear jeans to but may have wished you wore something a bit dressier when you get there and see your surroundings.Since my friend and I went there for lunch on MLK Jr. Day the place wasn't very full and allowed for easy wandering. They had older menus and articles on display on the right side about half way back near their ample supply of liquor. (The display fills in more of the details to what you can find about the restaurant's history on their website.) For instance, DYK: Delmonico's played host to a debate over whether baseball truly was ""All-American"" or merely a variation of an English game called ""Rounders""? Well, now you do. ;)It is definitely a stop worth making during Restaurant Week - or another week if your budget/schedule obliges.  I will certainly recommend it as a stop for visitors as well!On my way out the door I noticed the establishment year and Delmonico's will be celebrating 175 years this year - they are definitely doing something right!",0,0,0,Nora V.,"ASTORIA, NY",6,11,69

4.0,1/26/2012,"My boyfriend and I went to Delmonico's for Restaurant Week, on a Wednesday and placed OpenTable reservations for 7pm. We arrived 15 minutes early and, despite having a packed house, we were seated right away, without any hesitation.The decor/ambiance is what you'd expect from a very classic, old-time steak house. Cute and cozy. Hostess was a bit odd, but the waiter had a nice, classic, old-time demeanor to him. Very fitting to the rest of Delmonico's feel. Overall, service was VERY fast (perhaps a bit too fast - our appetizers came out before my boyfriend's first drink!). What I ordered:APPETIZER: Diver Scallops & Braised Veal with Sweet Potatoes - 5 stars! The scallops were great, but the veal was the real star of the dish. It literally melts in your mouth. I'd not even think it were possible to cook something to such perfection! Don't forget the sweet potatoes... These were quite heavenly, too.DINNER: Filet Mignon - awesome. Cooked to perfection (I ordered medium), and the steak sauce wasn't too overwhelming but added a great element to the dish. Again, the mashed potatoes were an amazing compliment to the dish. Whoever is back in that kitchen doing the potatoes really has perfected the art, to a tee!DESSERT: Salted Caramel & Chocolate Mousse Parfait Cake - a disappointment. My favorite combo is salty and sweet, and this one just missed the mark. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but the flavor was a bit off. Should have gone with the Baked Alaska, as many of you wrote!What my boyfriend ordered:APPETIZER: 1897 Classic Lobster Newberg - another 5 stars! Came out with one tail, cut in half, and two full claws. I almost had to restrain my boyfriend from ordered another half dozen dishes of this! The lobster was perfect and there's something quite magical about the sauce. The caviar adds a nice flavor/texture to the plate as well.DINNER: Classic Delmonico Steak - great and nothing to complain about here, but nothing to write home about either. Especially for a $15 supplement.DESSERT: Raspberry Cheesecake - top notch cheesecake for those of you who love this dessert! Can't go wrong with this, but again, should have tried the Baked Alaska.I had a glass of Terra Andina Reserva, a 2009 Chilean Cabernet that had just enough flavor, not too overwhelming and really complimented my entire dinner quite well. Went down very smooth. My boyfriend inexplicably ordered a margarita (don't ask) which was strong, but one of the best I've had in a while (and I'm a sucker for Mexican cuisine!).The reason for losing a star... As said, hostess was very odd and kind of brash. Despite the waiter being prompt and knowledgable, he didn't provide a wine/cocktail list and it took us two times to ask him for one before it was given to us. Post-appetizers, the bus boy had thought we were already finished with our entrées and, as a result, cleared away our dinner plates and bread with the basket half full. Though, they did not hesitate to give us a new one.Overall, I'd absolutely make a trip back here. Though coming during Restaurant Week with the $35/person price tag...

We were brought menus, but no wine menu, then after ten minutes, we were asked for our order. We explained that we wanted to order wine and relax first. We got a wine menu, and after the wine was poured, the server again asked for our order. It was 6:15, and I hadn't even tried the wine. The server explained that it was Winter Restaurant Week, and they had many reservations that evening, and it would be better if we ordered. He also told us that he didn't like Restaurant Week. To appease him, we said we'd order our appetizers, but he said he preferred to take our entire order. It went on like this throughout the evening. The low point was when the server argued with me after I asked him not to refill my wine glass. Only after we had ordered a second bottle of wine did his attitude change, and he cheerily told us to take as much time as we wanted.

Luckily I was able to snag a Friday night reservation with the help of Open Table.  Even though I called the restaurant and they told me they were booked for the night, I continuously refreshed my Open Table website and quickly snatched up a reservation (people cancel all the time so definitely try this!)   Anyway, on to the food:For the appetizer,  opted for the diver scallops and braised veal with the sweet potato puree-Delicious!  Definitely the star of the night!  It set the bar very high for the future courses.  It was so good, I scrapped the plate, yup! For dinner, I ordered the ""24hr Braised Beef"" which came with mashed potatoes and carrots.  Good, not great and fabulous like the scallops, but good.  I had to order more gravy because the meat was slightly dry...maybe they should change the name  to ""20hr Braised Beef"" for a more juicy cut-ha! I also tried my friend's filet mignon, which was good, but not the best filet I've ever had.For dessert, I tried the cheesecake and some sort of praline chocolate cake.  Both were quite tasty.  I'd opt for the chocolate cake because it's original and offers a variety of flavors in each layer.We also ordered a bottle of Malbec which was quite good and complemented the meat courses nicely.  All in All, I had a wonderful dining experience at Delmonico's.  In general, the food and the service were top notch!  I'd love to come back.",4,2,1,Alyssa M.,"Detroit, MI",288,227,22

The Shrimp with scallop appetizer had a little Cajun flavor which was really good. The Boar appetizer was pretty good but nothing special as it tasted like flavored beef. The Risotto appetizer was also good but nothing too special. But I do have to say that the bread and butter was delicious! The onion with sea salt bread was just amazing as it just melts in your mouth. Of all the meats I sampled, I enjoyed the Fillet Mignon and Strip the most. Cooked just perfectly with lots of juice. The sides were delicious! Top three would have to be the lobster mac and cheese, Delmonico's Classic Potatoes and cream spinach. Those are a must! Dessert was also really pretty. The Napoleon was my favorite as it was very fresh and crispy. It was not soggy or too sweet. The Passion Fruit Mousse was interesting though. It had a lemony ice cream mousse that took me by surprise.

Some of the wines cost more than my 1st car. The steaks were not terribly priced. It's about 50 bucks for their namesake ribeye. We went all out and got that and the Lobster Newberg. And for side: creamed spinach and mushrooms. At night during the week, it's pretty slow so we got excellent service. They are fast with your drinks and understand how to pace a meal appropriately. The steak was good. A bit too charred and fatty actually (and I like charred and  fatty), but it was still good. The Lobster Newberg was good, but honestly I think Lobster just tastes better boiled with drawn butter. The other thing is I really think that steak and lobster shouldn't be served together. It's like too decadent or something...and they compete for taste too much. Lobster is very delicate flavored and should be appreciated on its own. It was just hard to navigate the taste buds from one to the other without losing the previous enjoyment. And I also realize that we had control over that since we did the ordering...it's just an observation. It was my birthday and the wife called ahead. What came out last was a real good surprise. Baked Alaska. At this point, we were way too full to even appreciate how good it was (and it was amazing!). So, we did what damage we could and then paid the bill.Why 3 stars then? I really think there are better steaks in the city and more date-appropriate atmospheres. It was a little too stuffy (think old-boys club) and I am not a Wall St. type. So, it was good to experience once, but I wouldn't go back.",5,0,0,Charlie N.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",14,110,16

This resulted with the following order:Delmonico's SaladLobster NewburgBaked AlaskaThat salad was good, I'm not big on salad's, as a matter of fact they are my culinary arch nemesis, yet I found this one to be quite friendly.The Lobster Newburg was incredible. I ate every last bit and was fully prepared to lick my plate. I was, however, told that this was not proper etiquette, so I refrained.  The Baked Alaska was magnificent. Having never tried it before, I cannot compare it to another location, but this was memorable.

Also, it's very rare for one drink to even get me tipsy =) I ordered the filet mignon and Baked Alaska. I also had some kind of soup that was really intersting but I forgot what it was. The steak was cooked perfectly and so were the crunchy veggies it was served with. The dessert was pretty amazing, too. The banana ice cream and meringue were delish, but the walnut cake part could have been a bit more moist; I'm guessing they had to keep it cold so the ice cream didn't melt, though.

4.0,7/23/2011,"Delmonico's is a legendary name in the annals of NYC history. Dating back to 1827 when a cafe and pastry shop was opened by the Del-Monico brothers, there was a time when four restaurants carried the fabled Delmonico name. A quick romp through Delmonico's influence must include shout outs for lobster newburg, baked alaska, the delmonico steak and being one of the first restaurants (in the modern sense of the word) in NYC. (as opposed to tavern or inns where a menu was a foreign concept)Fast forward to the early 21st Century. Restaurant week, July. One of the hottest days of the year to date. Fortunately the experience of waiting for all of our party to arrive in non-air conditioning environs is not replicated when we are led to our large table in the lower lair. The blast of cold air is a relief and disquieted my belief that the restaurant tries in all areas of climate to replicate 19th century dining.The restaurant week menu contains several supplements that will quickly result in a price higher than $35. One could, in theory, sample every dish Delmonico's is known for: manhattan crab and corn chowder , lobster newberg + $20), delmonico classic steak ( + $15) and classic baked alaska ( + $5).The wait staff was quite accommodating for our friend who arrived late. Note that  you won't be seated until all of your party is present or you sacrifice one of your party members.Water and wine refills were abundant. I started with the wedge salad, a melange of candied walnuts, blue cheese, bacon and iceberg lettuce. I'm convinced the sole reason to eat iceberg lettuce is its role as the base for being smothered in blue cheese and bacon. I've had larger wedges but this was tasty enough for me to ignore the size. Up next was the 8 ounce filet mignon with a teeny-tiny serving of mashed potatoes, string beans and carrots. Exceptional quality, undoubtedly, but don't order if you are starving. If you are starving, do order the 20 ounce delmonico steak that will likely be enough for two servings and four people.The baked alaska was enough to make me want to move a few thousand miles to the great northern state, see Russia and shake hands with the Palins. Named in honor of the at the then time recent acquisition of the territory, baked alaska is the union of walnut cake, banana gelato and meringue with apricot jam on the side. The first three ingredients are baked just long enough to firm the meringue. The result is sheer decadence that is easy on the eyes and even easier on the taste buds.I gladly did my part to support historical food preservation by dining at Delmonico's. The Delmonico family has nothing to do with the current restaurant, of course, but their spirit lives on in this monument to their passion and creativity.",8,5,4,Tom K.,"Forest Hills, NY",337,820,47
3.0,7/21/2011,"Just went there last night for dinner for restaurant week and had a mixed experience. I think part of the reason is because I had high expectations for this steakhouse which claims to be one of the oldest in the NYC only to be disappointed by its marginally better than mediocre offering. I ordered the crab and corn chowder to start. It was satisfying but definitely not enough character to really stand out. There were meager hints of corn in the chowder but plentiful amounts of crab.I ordered the flat iron steak which I did thoroughly enjoy with its crispy fries seasoned with fleur de sel (or some other coarse sea salt variety). Rare and flavorful with crushed peppercorns. I had a taste of the filet mignon which unfortunately was disappointingly mediocre. Lack of flavor and seasoning, green beans a tad undercooked, expected more. I had the cheesecake and my boyfriend the chocolate cake. The cheesecake had a coarser/crumbly texture and wasn't rich or creamy. The molten chocolate cake lacked the richness of dark chocolate (even in the batter center).

We got there and I was ""informed"" that my reservation was for 7:30. Did I mention I double checked the confirmation before I left and it said 7:15? Anyways, it's restaurant week and I'm not going to stress about 15 extra minutes. Besides the initial snootiness of the hostess(es) they weren't too bad after that and we were seated very quickly. As with most NYC dining established we were seated on top of two other couples. The atmosphere is nice. I enjoyed the interior and felt that the atmosphere was the highlight of the meal. Waiter came and began rushing through the wines (it wasn't packed, surprisingly, so I wasn't sure why the rush). In the middle of reading the specials he decided to turn around and ask the table of 5 men behind him how they were doing. What. the heck. It wasn't a good way to start off the meal. The level of service continued at that level (1) for the rest of the meal. Down to the food...App's: I did the 10 dollar upgrade and got the lobster newburg...I wish I could get that money back. While the lobster was tender and well cooked the sauce and lobster had no flavor. It was disappointing to say the least. BF got the beet salad, it was fine.Entree's: While the filet mignon was the highlight of the meal, it's because it was the only thing that was slightly above mediocre. While it was cooked well, the actual flavor was lacking. The mashed potatoes underneath were also disappointing. BF got the flank steak (something like that). Once again, disappointing. Desserts: Once again upgraded to the baked alaska. It was certainly better than most of the meal. BF got the ""warm chocolate cake."" If it was actually warm it would have been tolerable. Maybe.I honestly don't even know why it deserves a 2 and not a 1 but I guess I'll stick to my original rating. Save your money. Way better meals to be had in the city.

I've had it before but never with this much flavor.  It was a walnut cake with banana gelato, meringue or course, and around the plate was apricots in a sauce that I believe had vanilla in it.  A wonderful mix of flavors and textures.  Highly recommended dessert!   The price as others have mentioned was expensive, but no more than I expected, and the quality of the food as well as the technique was worth the price in my opinion.",2,0,1,David S.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",439,258,302

5.0,5/16/2011,"My boyfriend and I went to Delmonico's for dinner on Saturday night and it was one of the best meals I've ever had.  The ambiance is wonderful, the food is delicious and the service is PHENOMENAL.  For apps, we had the Caesar Salad (served with a poached egg.  I'd never tried that before but I didn't want to be picky and I went with it - I really liked it) and the Crab Cake which was awesome.  For entrees we had the Chicken Ala Keene and Filet Mignon, which were both amazing.  But if you go to Delmonico's, you HAVE to try the King Crab Mac & Cheese.  Words won't even do it justice.  Just go there, order it, and thank me later.As much as we enjoyed the food, David was our server and he was really the highlight of our evening.  He was charming, attentive and basically everything you could ask for.  When he was opening the wine bottle, my boyfriend asked him if I could keep the cork - since I'm a sap and love collecting things from special occasions - and he said of course.  Then he said, ""...you collect corks?""  And I said, ""...yeah, it's a nostalgia thing!"" And he excused himself and came back with a beautiful container (used to hold a bottle of Poli Dal 1898 Grappapaioli) filled with old corks from the restaurant.  I was in complete shock.  It was such an amazing gesture and I was completely blown away by it.  And this was BEFORE we even ordered dinner.The one negative aspect of the dinner was that the couple next to us were complaining that they didn't have enough time between courses.   Yes, they wanted to wait longer for their food.  Even though they didn't say anything to anyone, they waited to the end of the meal to complain to both David and the manager.  And then, the woman started crying.  Yes, crying.  Because she didn't wait long enough between courses but never said anything.  She kept saying the ""food was wonderful"" through her tears but shut down every offer the restaurant made to make it up to her.  She ""hates"" after dinner drinks and she ""doesn't DO"" dessert.  My boyfriend and I were appalled, yet completely entertained, until we heard them argue over the tip.  They tipped David - awesome, super nice, gift-giving David - a mere 5% on a $500 tab.  That's just wrong.  She said she was going to ""report him"" and even though the manager seemed to be completely on the side of his staff we wanted to see if there was anything we could do to counter anything she could say. We just wanted to balance out anything she could say or do because our experience was nothing short of perfect. We asked and they said that she was nuts but as a thank you for our kindness, our dessert and after dinner drinks were on the house.  ...And they threw in about 20 more corks for the road :)",1,1,1,Gillian P.,"New York, NY",8,19,0

""Last time I went, I was the only female in the place.""""Apparently, Keen's is where, in the old days, men took their mistresses. Delmonico's is where men took their wives.""

4.0,3/19/2011,"Short version: Amazing food 5/5. Try the gnocchi side and chocolate-orange bread pudding dessert. The Chicken a la Keene, Delmonico Steak and Red Snapper were all great. Good service 3.5-4/5 , but not up to the level some/most would expect at that level of a restaurant. Great history and atmosphere 5/5.The only reason it's not 5/5 is the service could have been better.Maybe it was because the three of us were younger (twenties) and he was old-guard, but there were a few things. At the beginning we ordered wine, and he hovered and kinda pushed us to order then; however, he wasn't around for a while when we needed him once we were finally ready to order. He forgot a side that was definitely ordered - but it came out very quickly after we asked about it and (re)ordered it. He didn't really have a good, warm personality that makes some waiters really good. And he didn't know about their coffee and didn't even find out for us (which was apparently the best coffee a long-time starbucks employee has ever had). I thought some of the issues I saw on yelp about the service may have been because of restaurant week influx, but instead am thinking that it may be more of a server-to-server thing.The food was nothing short of fantastic. Everything that came out tasted great. For sides, I highly recommend the gnocchi - seasoned perfectly, firm but still tender. Amazing. The crab mac and cheese was also great, but not quite as good. Creamy, cheesy. Comfort food at its best made better by adding crab.The Chicken a la Keene was much different than the Chicken a la King I know of and that it gave rise to, but was delicious nevertheless. It's a classic; and definitely interesting to see where one of my favorite dishes came from. The Angry Red Snapper was cooked perfectly and the bean and chorizo ""salad"" it was served on paired so well with the flavor profile. The Delmonico Steak was seasoned and cooked to perfection; and it was very generously portioned, even more so than their other dishes, which is great at a place like that.Despite my despise of bananas, the Baked Alaska - while I was disappointed that it did not come out flaming - was one of the most interesting and unique things I've tasted. And the Dark Chocolate Blood Orange Bread Pudding is one of the best things I've ever eaten period. Covered in fantastic chocolate ganache; pudding had that great spongy texture and had the perfect hint of blood orange flavor. It even has little chocolate crunches (which we termed grenades of deliciousness) mixed in for a great texture addition. So I very highly recommend the pudding as well.7 things came out. I think it's rare that the three of us would have all loved to eat the entirety of all seven plates. And I think that says a lot about the food. It's survived for so long for a reason. All of it was really rich; the flavors were developed really well. Lived up to my high expectations; and dare I say it was even better than expected.The atmosphere is nice - we were in one of the downstairs rooms because of a party upstairs, which was smaller so a bit more intimate. Not overly busy which I kind of expected because of the birthday party on a Saturday night, which was a plus. It's classy and historic, but in a very good way (very cool history by the way). The building is amazing, and while so far downtown, made a nice little get-away from home near Columbia. All in all, yeah the price is high, but the food and experience were definitely worth it, even if it means putting up with service a little less than one would expect from a place of it's standard.",1,1,1,Drew T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,14,0

Lobster Newberg, was delicious--gracious tail and chunks of succulent flesh, lightly dripped with pink creamy sauce, all delightfully invited themselves into my mouth. But I tried similar dish somewhere before.Mushroom Risotto was quite average, with hints of truffle oil.The filet was good but too small of a portion.Great news was that we had some room for desert.Absolutely mandatory selection of your desert must, and again must be Baked Alaska. This is quite an extraordinary desert that I never quite experienced before. Ice cream mixed with whipping cream,apricot and some nuts, rolled into this snowball of sweetness, frozen and then baked for a minute just to crisp the top.

4.0,2/21/2011,"This is supposed to be the oldest fine dining restaurant in America! So I managed to arrange a dinner with some friends on a friday night after months of wanting to go there. I entered early and was greeted by a not so friendly hostess who made me feel like I shouldn't have come in! Btw, the restaurant was pretty dead - being a friday evening around 6pm (no minus points here). Just to cut the tension I asked for the bar and was steered in that direction. Two glass doors open to a lower level which has its own access from the other street. Now it's starting to look a bit friendlier! Bars are friendly places, like a mini Disneyland... Anyhow, thank God for that, I felt like I entered another world and not the snobby dining area. I had some wine at the bar and chatted with the bar tenders who are quite friendly. So ultimately we decided to get a table in the bar room which was a unanimous decision by all. Our waiter was friendly and suggested a few things on the menu. We had the shrimp and chorizo hash which was quite nice, and a Mayan prawn dish which was really tasty because of the sauce.We already knew about the steak - we got the ""John Krupa"" which is the 3 lb bone in ribeye. One of the guys like it medium well so we gave him the outside parts - ordered medium. I would have liked it to have been a bit drier on the plate - the steak itself was pretty good. Quick note, my friend said, it's not like Del Friscos! Then I had to explain that they have a different rub and probably cook it at a higher temperature. Ok, so no issues there, a straight forward ribeye with a medium flavor and decent texture. I cant say that I didn't like it, and I can't say that OMG it's the best steak ever! (why do I keep going back to DF in all my reviews??)Since it was my friend's bday we got a chocolate cake to share - very nice!So all in all it's a nice place if you're downtown and it's the closest steak house in your area. I probably wouldn't venture down all the way unless I was called in by the mayor.It's that point of the review again...The Good- Nice bar room- Friendly staff - in the bar room because they're probably drinking too- Old world charm- Good deals on Savored- Lots of bars in the areaThe Bad- The hostess at the door - maybe she had a bad week- Far from the center of the Universe - Times SquareThe Ugly- The mean hostess at the door who made me feel unwelcome!!!If you're a steak fan - I would say, go try it out for yourself!",1,1,0,Sabin C.,"Scarsdale, NY",93,326,547

The place itself looks high-end for pete's sake, why is the wait staff so inattentive and seem unattached??? I really wanted to like this place, but sadly, after the appetizer, I just gave up trying.  The whole time, I felt like somebody stabbed me with a fork.The food itself was not bad. But the service dragged the whole experience so far down that the food couldn't possibly make up for it. After being rushed throughout the whole meal, they made us wait for the check for 20 minutes.

4.0,2/15/2011,"Came here for 2011 Restaurant Week with my roommate. We have a friend who works there so we visited him during the lunch hour and had the most fantastic time. My roommate had..- The Delmonico Salad - candied walnuts, beets, argula, other stuff. It was on okay salad. She seemed to enjoy it.- Mushroom Risotto - she said it was the best she ever had. I had a taste and it was so rich and creamy and delicious; it was a really good risotto.- Baked Alaska ($5 supp.) - Delmonico claims to have invented this dessert so it was fitting that one of us get. Having only had cruise ship baked alaska experiences before today, this was a great surprise. The meringue on the outside was so thick and luscious. The banana ice cream with the cake/biscuit at the bottom with creme anglais and apriot sauce. It was honestly such a unique and tasty dessert.I had...- Seafood Chowder - it was a tomato based soup with little bits of seafood in it. It was pretty good and had a good base but I wouldn't have considered it a chowder. - Delmonico Steak ($15 supp.) - All the posts had said that this steak was really good and basically a must have at this restaurant (even better that the fillet mignon in a lot of reviews). It was good but not great in my opinion but I am not a big meat eater and the sheer size of the steak as it came out of the kitchen (20 oz.) I almost died. I would've been much happier with the braised short ribs that was less meat (and didnt need a large supp.) but that was my mistake and I shouldve known that I wouldn't have properly enjoyed a steak. I felt like I was getting a jaw workout chewing it. Left about 5 oz of it on my plate when they took it away. Steaks are a man's food and I just can't keep up.- Chocolate Hazelnut Cake - The cake had good dark chocolate flavors and the passion fruit sauce around the plate as a good compliment but by far my favorite thing about this dessert (and I dont like desserts normally) was the texture it had. The slight crunch from the hazelnuts MADE this cake for me. Though there were little things about the menu that I wasn't completely happy with, everything had great flavor and it was all delicious.

4.0,2/12/2011,"I still agree with everything in my last review and ate the same meal again several times since then.My issue is, places like Delmonicos - a high class establishment with expensive prices and upscale clientele needs to be more aware of their diners. Maybe even make rules about cell phones in their restaurants. The girls at the table next to us were constantly texting on their phones. Ok fine. Then one phone started this high pitched ""BEEP, BEEP, BEEP"" every time she got a text. It wasn't once, twice or even three times. It was about fifteen or so times. The waiter was actually at the table two times when it happened and I was sitting there giving her a nasty look waiting for him to ask to silence her phone. To be honest I could care less what you are doing at your table but come on! Then her and her friend proceeded to take a photo with a bright flash every single time a dish came out of the kitchen. So annoying!I heard them talking about how they were from Boston. Please leave the rudeness in your own City! I regret now not saying anything, my boyfriend told me to bite my tongue.

4.0,2/9/2011,"I first came here mid-January.  It was my gentleman friend's choice of venue for his birthday dinner spectacular, and so I escorted him to Delmonico's with both excitement and trepidation in my heart.  Never having been to a true steakhouse before, I wasn't sure what to expect.The space is absolutely gorgeous, and we both felt upon entering that we had entered another time and place, seperate from the outside world.  Always a good start to a meal.  I'd fortuitously received a 30% coupon for Delmonico's just after we decided that this was the spot for the birthday dinner, and had entered that information into the notes section of my Opentable reservation when I made it.As we entered, the hostess inquired for our names, directed us to coat check, and seated us immediately at a lovely corner table where we could sit adjacent to one another and view the entire restaurant.  Our waiter was a true gentleman and attended to us as soon as we were seated.  We were brought a delicious bread basket of warm mini breads with good quality (but cold, why cold?) butter.For appetizers we ordered the Caesar Salad and the Scallops with braised veal and onion marmelade.  I'd skip the Caesar; it was solid but old school and basic, and I think I just wanted it to be the glorious Marlow & Sons version instead of what it was.  The scallops, however, were fantastic.  Cooked perfectly, generously portioned, and the delicately caramelized flavor of the scallops themselves when combined with the deep savory veal and rich sweetness of the onion marmelade was a match made in heaven; my favorite flavor profile.For entrees I got the Lobster Newberg and my gentleman friend got the Delmonico's signature steak, and we also ordered a side of gratin asparagus.The Lobster Newberg was a giant plate of two (counter 'em, TWO) full lobsters, semi-shelled for easy extraction, with some grilled veggies on the side and red sauce all over the entire thing, as well as a tiny dollop of caviar on top of one of the tails.  Now, I love lobster, and this caused my eyes to pop out of my head upon first sight.  However, everything was a bit cold and I found that although it was good of course (lobster couldn't be anything else), the sauce really didn't add anything for me; I'd probably have been happier to just be served plain lobster, pipiing hot, with some butter and lemon.The Delmonico's steak, on the other hand, was CRAZY.  Like I said, I'd never been to a steakhouse before.  I'd never ordered a big juicy charred steak at a restaurant before.  It was a truly heavenly, a perfectly cooked, gigantic, crunchy and black on the outside, butter and soff on the inside, beautiful hunk of meat.  Love at first bite.Our side of asparagus was entirely superfluous, and it turned out that their version of ""gratin"" was plain grilled asparagus with a dollop of ricotta and a parmesan cracker on the side.  We had no room for dessert, and leftovers of all our entrees which we took home and enjoyed just as much the second time around the next day.Now, we enjoyed ourselves so much that we then came back 2 weeks later for restaurant week and were able to order almost identically, except that we got the lobster as an app. (better as an app. in my opinion, and this time served good and hot) along with the scallops.  Our entrees were the Delmonico's steak and the braised beef; both great.  And for dessert I had the chocolate hazelnut cake and my gentleman had the apple tart; both were so good that whichever one was in our mouths at any given time was pronounced the better one.I'd come back anytime my bank account could handle the hit, or even just for coffee and dessert!",2,0,0,sarah d.,"Brooklyn, NY",62,79,2

No one spoke to us the entire meal, never asked us how our food was or whether we needed another drink (we had planned on drinking a lot with our steaks, but they never offered to get us another drink, so we never got past the first one) Then they brought us our check (again, without asking if we wanted anything else) before we even got our dessert. After the 10 min it took to flag someone down out of the nearly empty restaurant with plenty of unoccupied waitstaff, they apologized and then brought us our dessert, without taking the check away, and without asking us if we needed anything else. Finally, at the very end they asked if we would like a complimentary drink for the mistake. At this point, we just wanted to leave so we said no. As for the food, the appetizers were pretty average overall (some kind of chowder that was pretty bland and watery and the scallops which were good).  The steaks were delicious and cooked well. The desserts were good but kind of unmemorable (as I can't remember them right now...).I enjoyed the atmosphere/ambiance of the restaurant, but the food wasn't good enough to make it worth the trip downtown/the crappy service.

5.0,1/31/2011,"Oh, my, god!Those were the words that literally came out of my mouth after I sunk my teeth into the best tasting piece of meat I've ever had in life. Let that statement sink in for a minute...  The 20 oz ribeye was nothing short of divine. If I find out tomorrow an asteroid is on its way to destroy earth.... well I now know what my last meal will be. Came here for restaurant week and had the seared scallops with braised veal, ribeye with potatoes and veggies (+15 supplement, its TOTALLY worth it), and the apple tart for dessert.Scallops were extremely delicious, seared perfectly and not overcooked, veal was great too. The only thing was the portion was quite small. I'm not a stranger to fine dining portions and realize it was an appetizer, but still.. it was comically small. At least what was there was very delicious.Ribeye was easily the star of the show and I couldn't down all 20 oz of it. It was one of the softest piece of meat I've ever had and was extremely flavorful. Outside had a nice crisp and it melted in your mouth. The potatoes, green beans, and carrots that came with it were also really delicious. Veggies were crisp and potatoes were nicely seasoned and flavorful.Apple tart was good but not mind blowing. My friend had the chocolate tart which was definitely better.Service was good and extremely efficient.

2.0,1/31/2011,"i came here for restaurant week & was EXTREMELY disappointed, particularly w/ the service! =Tthe food was fair. i ordered the wild mushroom risotto, filet mignon & apple tart. the risotto was pretty good. they went skimpy on the portion of the filet mignon they served my friend & i. we looked over to the table next to ours & realized that their steaks were larger in size. uhm, uncool??? the apple tart was pretty decent, although i wish they had warmed it up.decor was very old fashion. i did like the architecture of the restaurant.sad to say that even though the food was just OKAY, their service was NOT top notch at all. after our main courses were set in front of us, the waiter left to attend to other matters. then 5 mins later, i realized i wanted some ground pepper on my steak so i was trying to wave a waiter down. mind you, there was a group of them about 7 ft away from our table. however, none of them looked over & were preoccupied w/ other tasks. then they dispersed. fine, i can understand that. HOWEVER, i tried grabbing the attention of some of the waiters & busboys by saying, ""excuse me"" in a polite normal voice. i did this for about 5 mins. another group of waiters formed at the same spot 7 ft away from out table. i tried one more time by saying ""excuse me, could a waiter please help us?"" now here's the part that pissed me off - they turned around, SAW me & then looked the OTHER way. excuse me?!?! so i said even louder, ""apparently, NO ONE's listening to me."" well, i definitely caught the attention of the surrounding customers but boy, was i IRRITATED. what kind of customer service is that?! if i wasn't there w a group of friends, i would've walked out.dear delmonico's, if you're willing to participate in restaurant week, please do not hinder your service. i was greatly disappointed & no matter how good your baked alaska is, i won't be coming back. thanks. - the undersigned",5,0,0,Olivia S.,"New York, NY",656,607,1036

2.0,1/21/2011,"This restaurant introduced me to the three O's and no that's not a good thing... The three O's are officially dedicated to Delmonico's because it is: Overpriced, Overrated, and had Octaves that I shouldn't have been exposed to after 9 pm in a ""fine dining establishment"".Allow me to explain... Overpriced: I don't appreciate being lied to by the waiter about the water bottling system which I now like to call the ""Brita scam"". Apparently this is taking the high-end restaurants seeking better profit margins by storm. Sorry, but I'm not a big fan of paying for overpriced filtered water. Please feel free to reference yelp.ca/biz/blowfish-res… for more about my stance on this. I know ""Green"" is great and in fashion right now but not when I'm charged $8 for a bottle of glorified ""laboratory grade"" tap water. Your water tastes more like what I'd expect LAVATORY grade to taste like. And yes, I'm noticing the difference which is why I googled your brand of water from my smart phone while dining in your restaurant in the first place. I uploaded a pic for reference. Same logo, it's the same brand so I'm not mistaken... don't let this blonde hair fool you Mr. Waiter-man. Delmonico's uses Vero Water yet you claimed that the water is shipped in intact bottles and is not filtered at their restaurant. Looking at verowater.com will show otherwise. Minus one star for bold-face lying to me.Overrated: The food was not as great as the reputation would lead you to believe it would be and neither was the service. The bread came out cold. ""Can we please have it heated?"" we asked the server and so started the major attitude coming from him. It seemed we irritated him even more that we asked what the Delmonico's style potatoes were. It doesn't say on the menu and I'm sure as hell not psychic so didn't think asking this would be out of line. I think it just annoyed him to do his job. After the snippity waiter explained the dish, I ended up ordering the Delmonico style potatoes since surely their one of their signature dishes would be great, right? Not so much. The shrooms with pearl onions ended up being bland. The iceberg wedge salad was a tiny portion. I've noticed that when a restaurant skimps on a salad, they will skimp on everything else. Delmonico's wedge salad used cheap produce, poor quality bacon bits, and had very little dressing/blue cheese crumbles on it. My filet mignon steak was the only saving grace of this meal but I still asked for steak sauce which is never a good sign and couldn't be a bigger insult to the chef. And quite like their signature potato dish, their steak sauce sucks! It's sweet like BBQ sauce. I wished for A-1 to save me from this mediocre excuse for a meal. I don't imagine they sell much of this Delmonico's brand steak sauce but they are peddling it in the front of the restaurant. If I were them, I'd be embarrassed to put my name on that label. Octaves I shouldn't have been exposed to: When I'm paying $200 for a meal, I insist that it shouldn't sound like they are slaughtering Flipper in the dining area. Unfortunately, a couple of tables of Wall Street yuppies decided to bring along their poorly behaved, screaming brats to this ""fine establishment"" and let them run wild throughout the restaurant like banshees. If you can afford to eat here, then do the rest of us who are trying to enjoy our meal here a favor and get a babysitter please. My eardrums haven't taken such bad abuse since being Rickrolled into watching that Fred video on YouTube way back when. youtube.com/FredThis restaurant is skating (on thin ice in my opinion) on it's location, history, and reputation which is why it is deserving of a two star ""Meh. I've had better."" experience. And may I add that I've had way better for a lot cheaper. Two stars is being pretty charitable though. Because of all of the above, I've vowed to never return. There are other steakhouses in the area that run circles around this place! Way better service, food, atmosphere, etc, etc, minus the stuffiness factor that seemed very prevalent here.

The minute I stepped inside, I could tell this was a high class place. Apparently it also has its share of history too, as it was the birthplace of baked Alaska (paging Sarah Palin) and Eggs Benedict... what the what? How awesome is that? My tastings from the RW menu:Grilled asparagus and frizee salad with tangerine and grapefruit and poached egg - fresh and light, summery. I'm not usually a big fan of frizee since it's usually too bitter, but the bitterness was balanced well by the sweetness of the tangerine and surprisingly, the grapefruit (I'm also not a grapefruit fan by any means). Filet mignon - tender, moist, and lying on a delicious bed of creamy potatoes. The vegetable accompaniment was a nice gesture to stave off the guilt of eating my month's worth of animal fat content in one sitting.Chocolate peanut butter mousse - every dieter's worst nightmare: an irresistable combination of chocolate and peanut butter, and no rationalization for why you should be eating this in the first place except for the fact that it tastes damn good.Service was excellent, even though it was clear that we were here for RW, which was considerably cheaper than what the meal would have been if we had ordered from the regular menu.

The decor was great and the environment was pretty casual, romantic and relaxing so that was cool.  As for the food, it was good but nothing extraordinary in my opinion. I ordered the Chicken A La Keene and my bf ordered Filet Mignon which he asked for it to be cooked Medium and it came back Rare!!! He isn't the type to complain so he decided to keep it but I was a little upset at the waiter's lack of listening skills. Speaking of the waiter, he was a completely rude (I would call him something else but this may not get posted ). I do not remember his name but he was tall, slim, brown hair, and had an accent (he stands out compared to the other waiters who all seem to be short in stature). The waiter that we had was so impersonable and acted like he didn't care to serve us. He definitely had an attitude the whole night as if we were wasting his time. In addition to bringing out the wrong order to my bf, he also decided to add pepper to my bf's steak after my bf clearly and loudly said ""no thank you"". Now that wasn't even the breaking point...the breaking point was when I asked for the check at the end of the (average) meal. Our meal, which also included wine and a side order, was rather inexpensive...$139. After he swipped my credit card, he brought back the receipt which showed $383 !!! (Seriously, Is this guy from another planet???) I asked him why the huge variance and he didn't even apologize but with an attitude, he took the check back and re-swipped for the correct amount of $139. I understand that it could have been an accident but an apology would have been appropriate. Instead he looked at us as if were crazy for questioning his decision to charge us for more than what we ate!! I also spoke to the House Manager at the end of the night and he was slightly sarcastic and didn't seem to care about our experience. Honestly, I do not intend on going back to Delmonico's. I rather go somewhere where the staff is a little friendlier and more down to earth. My money is just as good as the next person's so I dont deserve to be treated like I'm carrying pennies in my pocket.  Seriously, I was not impressed....and I had a much better experience at Angelo and Maxie's...Don't waste your time... that's my opinion...",2,0,0,sarah s.,"Manhattan, NY",8,22,1

To be honest, I've never been impressed with midtown and downtown steakhouses - the food isn't very good and it is very much a ""boys club.""  Delmonico's is no exception in the atmosphere department.  It was extremely evident that this is where the movers and shakers of Wall Street closed deals.  It was also evident that those times are long gone; the markets unraveled, and our team was seated in a mostly-vacant restaurant.  Even more ironic, the team dined at Delmonico's the same week the Wall Street sequel came out.As an appetizer, I ordered the scallops in sweet corn pudding.  The scallops were juicy and not gritty.  As a main course, I ordered the angry red snapper.  Not sure what makes snapper so angry - credit default swaps perhaps?  (Bad joke, sorry!)  It was a large portion, albeit a bit salty, and the spaghetti squash that came as a side was super-buttery.  For dessert, I ordered the baked alaska, one of Delmonico's signature dishes.  Although the contrast in temperatures was not pronounced, I enjoyed the contrast in textures (whipped, porous, creamy, and spongy) and consistencies (light and airy, heavy and rich).In summary, Delmonicos was surprisingly good for a steakhouse; exceeding my fairly low expectations.",11,10,11,Dana F.,"Queens, NY",665,925,146

3.0,8/25/2010,"After my cousin's quaint wedding ceremony at the Bronx Zoo, we discovered ourselves at the front of Delmonico's for their reception. Not knowing really what to expect, other than the obvious fact steak may indeed be served, we ventured in.There's a main floor and a lower private room in the basement of the restaurant. Our wedding party was in the latter. I immediately noticed the beautiful decor- some sort of restoration must have been done. I felt like we had walked right back into the early 1900s. Beautiful molding, dim lighting, carpeted walls, elegant furniture. There were approximately 11 tables downstairs, with a little over a hundred people.Our menu had several choices. For appetizers, we could choose their special garden salad, blue crab cake, or scallops. For the main course, there was the option of Lobster Newburg, NY Strip Steak, or Halibut. And for dessert, there was simply their Frozen Raspberry Souffle.The blue crab cake was large in portion on a bed of light greens. It was crispy on the exterior, and purely crab meat. I'm not particularly a huge fan of crab cakes in general, but this one was fine- nothing too spectacular. The scallops were lightly seared, and served on a cream-corn-bacon-chowder-like concoction. What a unique and delicious way to serve scallops! Not too rich or overbearing- the scallops were fresh and perfectly done. The NY Strip was simply seasoned with salt, with a great crust on the outside- beautifully medium rare & juicy in the middle. Garlic butter mashed potatoes and green beans & carrots were served as its sides. The Lobster Newburg was a feast for the eyes. Beautifully colored with oranges and reds and creams. It came with 4 meaty claws & 2 lobster tails split in half in a cream-based sauce. The meat was sweet and juicy. However, the sauce was a bit too wine-y for me. There were also some potatoes in the sauce as well which was a nice complement to the lobster.My relatives told me the halibut was so-so, nothing too memorable.We finished the meal with their frozen raspberry souffle. This concoction was just a mess in my mind. The presentation was gorgeous, but it was the only savory part of the dessert. The raspberries were EXTREMELY tart, nearing the border of sour. There was a butter-y cookie as the top, and a cream which was half-frozen, half melted was used as the base of the dessert. I was so confused because the flavors and textures really didn't work well together. I have no idea who created it, but I wouldn't serve it if I was in charge.Overall, not a bad experience. But, then again, I have no idea the prices, if the food is actually what they serve to their normal customers, or if their servers are always as attentive and helpful as they were for my cousin's wedding.",2,1,1,Tiff C.,"Long Beach, CA",30,86,1

4.0,8/18/2010,"Came here for a work dinner and it just so happen to be restaurant week in the big apple. Friendly staff, courteous waiter, and nice ambiance. Had their grilled asparagus salad as an appetizer. Really scrumptious and crunchy cabbage with slice asparagus in every bite. There was also a poached egg in it. Not too much egg though, which worked out wonderfully. It has a lemon flavor as well. Very light and summery salad. Delicious!The lobster newburg was the main course and it was cooked to perfection. Every piece has been delicately taken out of its shell for you and simmered with their creamy and savory sauce. I have to admit, it was a bit too creamy for me, but it's okay. I just scraped the sauce off and it was just fine. Baked Alaska- Very interesting history to this dessert. It was named in honor of Alaska (when we stole it from the natives basically) and it is baked in a really hot oven, though it is ice cream. Had a bite, and gave the rest to my coworkers. I don't think I am a huge fan of ice-cream. Forgive me.",0,0,0,Jen L.,"Los Angeles, CA",63,200,0

It's rare that I eat red meat, but yes, I did have steak two days in a row, but it was damn delicious. Restaurant Week is a great idea for lunch, not only because it's cheaper, but because it's more of a treat. How often do you eat a 3-course lunch? Most of us all ordered the same items - Snap Pea and Corn Soup with Crab, Steak Frites and Chocolate Peanut Butter Mouse. The one thing I will say is that their version of medium rare is my version of the cow is still mooing. I did have to send it back, but the service was polite and returned my steak cooked perfectly.

Delmonico's has its fame but located in FiDi makes it unattractive to me. I saw it on Restaurant Week list and decided what the heck. I need to try the place out to judge myself. We arrived there and the host was very friendly. I actually fell in love with the decor and old world feel immediately once I walked in. The food was excellent. Their Restaurant Week menu was strong with many steak options including a 16 oz steak, fillet Mignon, steak frites, etc. We tried the Steak frites and Delmonico Steak and they are seasoned well and tender. The seared scallops are paired with creamy corn stew and they are excellent. My boyfriend's chilled minty soup was different but good. Desserts were all good.

2.0,7/26/2010,"Like many reviewers here, I went to Delmonico's this past Friday night (7/23, 7:30 reservation) with 3 other people for Restaurant Week (seated at 7:45 since the others were late).  At first, the staff was very attentive, but everything went downhill as soon as we said we were ordering off the ResWeek menu.  The nicest thing I can say is that the staff became apathetic.  The appetizer, we all ordered the scallops, came out rather quickly. The dish was very good, with the scallops perfectly cooked. For entrees, 2 people ordered the filet, my gf ordered the ribeye ($15 upcharge), and I ordered the steak frites.  Between the apps and the entrees, there was at least an hour wait in between, if not longer. The waiter only came by to check on us once even though he was just standing to one side. When the steaks finally came out, they were pretty good especially my gf's ribeye. Of course, the ResWeek steaks weren't full-sized as the others already mentioned. Finally, we get to dessert.  I had a baked Alaska for the first time, it was good but nothing special.  My gf had the lemon tart and my two friends the chocolate.  Again, all good but nothing earth-shattering.  We also ordered coffee, etc. which didn't come out until we were already halfway through our desserts. Overall, I think Delmonico's management can do better in training their staff.  As others have said, isn't the whole point ResWeek to introduce the restaurant to people who otherwise bypass it?  Why discourage that by having staff who tone down service if you are ordering from the ResWeek menu?  While the food was good, the weak service gave us a bad first impression, and there won't be a second one.",1,0,0,G P.,"Bayonne, NJ",16,29,1
2.0,7/23/2010,"Delmonico's is very rich in tradition.  It's been around as a steak place since 1837, and has been serving food since 1827. They even have their own Wiki site (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De…). I went here last night with for RW dinner with friends.  I expected it to possibly contend to become my favorite NYC steakhouse (I currently do not have one as I've been disappointed by every place I have been to).  It's the curse of having had wagyu and Kobe steaks many times in Japan.I upgraded my dinner (extra $15) by opting for the 20oz Delmonico Steak (rib eye).  The salt & pepper flavoring was fine, but the steak itself was unimpressive.  The fringes where there was fat was good, but the interior was tougher than desired and wasn't delicious.  I order my steaks medium rare (and at times black & blue).   For an extra $10, I opted for their famous Lobster Newberg.  it was a smaller sized lobster, two claws and the tail split in half.  The claws were decent, but the tail (as with most tails) was rubbery.  The famous Newberg sauce didn't really add much to the dish.  I was happy with my two claws though. And for an extra $5, I selected the  Baked Alaska dessert.  It wasn't what a Baked Alaska should have been and had banana cream inside.  The outside didn't have rockets but had thorns making it resemble a Christmas ornament or a spaceship, depending on you opinion.  In other words, it looked more like modern art than something you would want to eat.  After a few bites, I didn't want anything to do with it. I wanted to like Delmonico's, but just could not.  The wait staff wasn't attentive.  Though our real was really quick.  I appreciate that for lunches, but not for dinners.  It felt like we were being hurried out.  Delmonico's gotta make their money you know!

4.0,7/21/2010,"My  friends and I came here for lunch during restaurant week (winter 2010).The appetizer TORCHIO PASTA with roasted wild mushrooms, pancetta and black pepper. Let me just say... I WISH THIS WAS THE ENTREE. It's SO good. De-freaking-licious. If I had known I would of ordered this for the appetizer, the entree, and the dessert. This one is a MUST TRY. I'm glad I came here for lunch because if it was dinner I would of ordered the Scallops and Bacon and then I would not have been able to taste this deliciousness.For the entree, I ordered the Classic Chicken A la Keene served over buttered noodles which was a big downgrade from the wonderful appetizer. : ( The buttered noodles were extremely bland... I've never had buttered noodles so maybe they are suppose to be that way? The chicken had some flavor but I guess it was just not my cup of tea. It was an okay dish but I would not recommend it.For the dessert I had the Delmonico's Chocolate Mousse which was eh. My friend came here for dinner during restaurant week and said the dessert was better then so maybe... it was just this slice. It didn't taste fresh to me so I only had a few bites.Also for dessert, their signature Baked Alaska dish! The French chef at Delmonico's created this new cake to celebrate the United States purchase of Alaska from the Russians. Anyway, it's made of banana ice cream placed in a pie dish lined with almond cake and topped with meringue. I was really full and only tried a tiny bite and remember it being okay (I'm not a banana fan =\), definitely an interesting dish though.I will come back. TORCHIO PASTA.

1.0,7/21/2010,"Us: about 20 young professionals, well mannered and well dressed.Them: Delmonico's, and a waiter who I shall refer to as the Sneaky Bastard from now on (SB for short)Case: RW week... the group was split into 2 tables. And SB was our main waiter.. taking our orders, and getting our bills.I had great expectation for this place because I've came here a few times before both for RW and non-RW dinners. But earlier this week when we visited here it was a complete nightmare... for all of us. First of all the food was a HUGE let down... the Delmonico's steak, as I remembered, should be a big, succulent, tender piece of meat cooked to perfection. But instead for everyone that ordered the steak.. it was dry, over cooked, rubbery, and the sides were a joke.. few pieces of fries! Nothing, absolutely nothing stood out. No one really liked their food. It was just that bad.Now, in terms of service, this is where shit hit the fan. While most of the waiters were nice and patient. SB was a complete JERK throughout our meal. Now, I'm not a customer easily taking offense, I have served people and is usually quite understanding and don't mind a slow service. But because Yelp is a place where people share their opinions and reviews so other user can be warned about what to expect. I feel like its my duty to explain why I call this wait the Sneaky Bastard.First the sneaky part. For the drinks we had at the bar, he tried to add the drink bill to the checks on BOTH tables. It wasn't a mistake because we CLEARLY told him which check to add the drink bill. Secondly, when we placed our food order some of us weren't looking at the menu and asked what he recommend for dessert. Everything he recommends were OFF the RW menu even though we clearly all wanted RW menu items. Now I shall explain the bastard part of him. So during the course of our dinner, he persistently came over and asked us if we wanted to drink, even after we told him we had enough. over and over again. And when the check came, this is how the conversation went down.Us: could you please give us separate checks?SB: No, I'm sorry I can't do that.Us: ...Why not? the 2 girls that left early had their separate checks..SB: (louder) No, I can't do separate checks.Us: Why? the other waiter did it just 30mins ago.SB: (now literally shouting over our entire table) NO I can't do that!! ITS TOO MUCH HASSLE FOR ME. (angrily walked off)damn.. dude... if you don't like what you do 1. get a different job that don't require you to SERVE customers that have different needs2. skip your shift altogether for RW and just come back and wait regular tables if you are going to be such a douchebag towards RW customers.3. remember you are a WAITER, you SERVE people, people dont SERVE you. dont like it? quit your job!I understand during RW waiters dont get tipped as much as they use to. But smart waiters understand excellent service will propel customers to return which will potentially gain you more customers. Thats the whole idea of RW. Do I mind spending $500 on Per Se? absolutely not. Do I mind spending $500 on a restaurant that I've never been to and don't know what to expect at all? you bet i do! RW gives me the opportunity to experience a portion of the restaurant on a budget, and if I like it, you can be sure I will return for regular menu. For a restaurant like Delmonico's you would at least expect a certain level of professionalism that embraces the idea of RW.

4.0,7/19/2010,"Delmonico's is truly a NYC treasure and not just for it's historic value but for it's food. To date Delmonio's is the 2nd oldest restaurant in New York (1st being the River Cafe which opened in 1794). in 1827 Swiss immigrants, Giovanni and Pietro Delmonico originally opened a pastry shop on William St about a block away from it's current location on Beaver Street. They soon started serving more than desserts and in 1830 Delmonico's was officially a restaurant and by 1837 they opened their famed location on Beaver Street making it the city's first fine dining experience. Delmonico's claims to have been the first restaurant in the country to offer a printed menu for its diners as well as the inventors of some classic dishes such as baked Alaska, lobster Newberg, and eggs Benedict. Though the restaurant hasn't been operating within the Delmonico family since the early 1900's you wouldn't know that by anything you'll experience here. Having previously been to another historic NYC steakhouse (Peter Lugar's est.1887) and been completely underwhelmed by the food and ambiance I didn't know what to think going to Delmonico's. Happily, I was very impressed with Delmonico's. First of all I love the downtown area, the streets are smaller and have no order to them and it feels much more historic, like North Boston. The restaurant is in a beautiful building in 5-way intersection. Once inside the restaurant I was even more impressed with their gorgeous interior. An interior that didn't feel too old, too pretentious, too modern, too classy, or too casual. It was the perfect classy and comfortable atmosphere split between two floors and a number of rooms which kept everything from feeling too big or cavernous. The waiters, all in tuxes, did a good job of keeping the food coming and the drinks filled without feeling rushed. Our waiter's personality wasn't the warmest by any means but he seemed like an Eastern European which is a common trait in those cultures so I won't hold it against him. The prices are pretty high here but I wouldn't exactly call them overpriced for the quality of the food and the experience is worth the splurge. As a side note they do operate a 2nd business with a separate entrance on the side of the building which is more of a classy bar and grill. This is where you can get their famed eggs Benedict and some more affordable dishes such as a burger or steak frites. I came here during restaurant week so I was able to get a 3 course dinner for $35 (tax, tip, and drinks obviously not included). The meal started with a warm bread basket of very tasty seasoned rolls and butter. I order a beer ($7) which was brought to me in a bottle with a glass very similar to a wine glass. I started my meal with the scallop and corn appetizer. I was actually quite disappointed with this as I was served a single scallop that had been cut in half. I think this portion size was unacceptably low even for a nice restaurant and if I had to be served a single scallop that last thing I would want them to do to it would be to cut it in half for presentation purposes. Still the dish was cooked and presented nicely. My date had gotten the lobster Newberg (a $10 supplement) which was their famous creation but in 1/2 size portion (which is actually 1/2 a lobster). This was quite tasty and the sauce was very nice, my only complaint however is that the dish was described as coming with a caviar garnish (something my date was eager to try for the first time) and there was no caviar to be found on the dish. We both got the filet mignon for an entree and a chocolate peanut butter mouse for dessert. The filet mignon was served with mixed vegetables which consisted of carrots (both the regular and the white variety) as well as string beans. The vegetables were perfectly cooked and seasoned (though I could have stood for a few more pieces). The filet was also cooked perfectly and was the best steak I have ever had. It wasn't fatty or overly seasoned and didn't need any sauce whatsoever. Though the portion was small, it wasn't too small by any means, I found the portion to be just right. I'm sad to say that even though I found the steak to be the best I've had my date said hers wasn't impressive and when I gave her a bite of mine she told me that hers wasn't as tender. The mouse for dessert was also pretty small but it was so rich that the small portion seems just right (though I definitely wouldn't have complained if the piece had been bigger). The mouse was smooth with the perfect blend of chocolate and peanut butter flavor without either being overwhelming. Overall though my service didn't come with the biggest smile and the portion sizes left me a little underwhelmed, the ambiance and food was definitely something to write home about, as is the amazing history of the place. I'll definitely be back next restaurant week, if not sooner.",3,4,4,Matt E.,"Brooklyn, NY",785,2205,1856

Most kitchens in the area are pretty much closed by this time. Delmonico was nice enough to welcome us and so we pretty much had the whole restaurants to ourselves. I thought it was extremely nice of them to do us this favor. We also asked for rush service --whatever you got just bring it out. Don't care about any particular order. Our waiter jumped to his  feet and we had our appetizers immediately in a heartbeat. I had a party of 3, so we had soup, salad, and mozzarella sticks. They called it fried cheese. My favorite was my friend's ""fried cheese."" Soup was good, had a a lot of substance in my seafood chowder. Before even finishing my soup, the entree came right away. Everyone ordered flank steak. Asked for medium rare, but it was a bit on the pink side. Disregarded it since it was good. My friend didn't like her well done because it wasn't well done enough for her. For desserts, we all had the tiramisu. My friend offered me his, and so  I gave mine to my boss. Very rich and creamy tiramisu. Had to bag the rest of my seafood chowder home. It was still good after I took it home. Also came with complimentary coffee or tea. Gave my tea to my coworker. He didn't like it. I guess he isn't much a tea person. Overall, it was the service that I deem the place excellent. The food was okay, but because we had such special treatment, this place truly deserves 4 stars.

My roommate and I shared the the double porterhouse ($90), the twice fried french fries ($8), and the broccoli rabe and artichoke ($12) with 2 glasses of merlot. Because we liked our steaks cooked differently, our waiter suggested having the porterhouse cooked to a medium on the edges and medium rare in the middle, which was perfect! The fries were deliciously crisp and salty with just the right amount of potato, but the broccoli/artichoke was just okay and probably not worth the price.The atmosphere was a little pretentious for my taste (looks like a classy library or museum with dark drapery and fancy lighting), and we were conspicously underdressed since most of the diners were on business dinners in full on suits, but the steak was great.

1.0,4/2/2010,"My boyfriend and I ventured down through the financial district to Delmonico's for Restaurant Week in January 2010, and let me tell you, it almost felt as if we were being penalized to have attended for restaurant week and not to dine off the regular menu. Our reservation was set for 9, but we were kept waiting for about another half hour. When we were finally seated, we were led all the way into the corner of the main dining room upstairs, sandwiched between a cart full of plates, menus, and utensils, the private dining room door, and a cracked-open window. I barely had enough room to pull my seat out enough to sit down on it, and the waiters constantly reached over and behind me to retrieve items from the cart. I wonder why they even placed a table in such a horrid location, more so I wonder why we were seated in that location when I noticed there were two other tables for two open in more comfortable locations. We were so secluded from the rest of the dining area that not a single waiter tended to us for about another 30 minutes. In fact, no waiter tended to us at all, we had to ASK a waiter passing by to GIVE US MENUS. We waited a half an hour to be handed menus. Can you believe that? At a dining establishment that claims to be one of the finest steakhouses in new york, that kind of service is just appalling. The waiter who served us seemed to have a lot of tables he was tending to and so he was very snarky, cold, and unfriendly. I often caught him expressing his discontent at his heavy load by cursing under his breath in between serving tables. That was unprofessional, to say the least. He barely came to check up on us in between courses, but that's understandable considering he had many to run between.The food, however, was fantastic. Although the portions were surprisingly small (even for restaurant week), the flavor, seasoning, and temperature of all dishes were great. I don't remember the appetizers exactly but my boyfriend and I both had the filet mignon and the idiazabel cheesecake for dessert - I am a cheesecake fanatic and this is undoubtedly the best cheesecake I have tasted in my life, so far at least.To be quite frank, my boyfriend and I were looking to have a nice, fancy dinner where we both dress up and feel like royalty; we're both college students and restaurant week seemed like the perfect opportunity to do just that, but this place just made us feel like outsiders and discriminated against. This is definitely one of those snooty elitist establishments where you have to be snooty and elitist in order to be treated well. If it weren't for the food quality and the to-die-for cheesecake, I would have easily just rounded down my overall rating to 2 stars. In terms of service, I expect infinitely better from a ""fine dining establisment"" such as Delmonico's.Edit -- 04/04/10 -- Screw it. I'm downgrading them to one star. I just told my roommate about my dining experience here and remain absolutely infuriated at the unprofessional and unorganized demeanor of the staff here. The food can't quite make up for it, it really can't. If the place that I am paying to serve me food is going to treat me like crap, I'd rather vomit the food I ate back onto my place and eat elsewhere.

5.0,3/4/2010,"Delmonico's is legendary, and it lived up to the legend. Established in 1827, Delmonico's is the oldest restaurant in the United States. So, as a NYC history buff and a man that appreciates a fine steak, this was an amazing experience. Just to give you some quick culinary history... you can thank Delmonico's head chef in the 1860's Charles Ranhofer for creating Chicken A La Keen, Lobster Neuberg, Baked Alaska and my personal brunch fav, eggs benedict. The ambiance is what you'd expect from an established steakhouse in the financial district: wood paneling, ornate details and rich drapery. I went with some colleges from we and we started off with cocktails (They make a decent Manhattan), then jumped into our main course. If you go to Delmonico's you have to get their signature dish, perfected over the last 150 years... the Delmonico's steak! It's a healthy cut of Meyer's All Natural Angus Boneless Rib eye. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Prepared medium rare (is there any other way to prepare a steak) it's tender and juicy, with enough fat to offer some real flavor. It's served with some flied onions. We shared 3 family style sides for 5 people, which was plenty given the size of the steak. For desert we sampled the baked Alaska and the peanut butter chocolate mousse cake, both were great... but I don't thinks you can go wrong with their desert menu, everything looked amazing. Overall, I had a fantastic experience at Delmonico's! It ranks third in my list of favorite steak houses (behind Old Homestead and Peter Luger's). Due to the amazing steak and the historical allure, Delmonico's is a must for any New Yorker.",4,0,3,Kyle W.,"New York, NY",1028,20,1

4.0,2/18/2010,"It is places like Delmonico's that make me LOVE restaurant week. :) I am going to say that I wanted to give it 3 stars (for reasons you will see below) but then realized that the restaurant week price and the quality of most of the food, not to mention that if I had been able to order from the full menu it probably would have been 5 stars compelled me to average to 4. First off, BE-you-tiful! What a gorgeous place to dine and despite how bustling it is, you never feel as if it is loud or overwhelming. The servers, all men, were friendly and prompt, and I was able to overlook the bright red tights the hostess was wearing. The food: No non-pork/shellfish appetizer options? Are you kidding me? And the only one that they can make kosher is the iceberg salad?? Now, let me be clear that if I have my way, I NEVER order a salad for restaurant week. Come on.... salads are never anything special. But, I have to say that despite my ""feel sorrier for me"" attitude about having to order a salad appetizer, it was actually quite good and something I would have again. The fillet mignon was divine. But, the ""brussel sprouts"" that were served to accompany it were really one HALF of a brussel sprout cut in half. Wow.... I am a huge brussel sprout fan and just wasn't expecting the non-meat portion of the meal to be o lacking. Finally.... The Baked Alaska. They are famous for this dish. Supposedly it was created there. I had never had one. It made me want to cry how good it was. The Baked Alaska was enough to make my entire meal and ensure that I will return to Delmonico's.

3.0,2/16/2010,"I came here for Restaurant Week on February 1st. I ordered the Corn, Crab And Chorizo Chowder for my appetizer, Filet Mignon for my entree, and Idiazabal Cheesecake for dessert. The chowder was incredibly tasty. However, its texture was too smooth for my liking. I was expecting to find chunks of corn, crab, and chorizo as indicated by its name, but most of the soup was just a light, creamy consistency. Also, it wasn't served hot. My date and I waited a bit too long for our filet mignons. The couple seated next to us arrived about 15 minutes later than we did, but got their entrees before us, and we had all ordered the same thing! In any case, I ordered my meat at a medium temperature, and now I know I should have gone for medium-rare. My boyfriend got his cooked rare and the meat was very soft and juicy. Mine was less so, but it was still delicious. There were also some parts of the meat that were too crusted over, but for RW prices, it was good enough for me. I would NOT go to this restaurant and pay full price for its filet mignon. My dessert was good cheesecake, nothing special. I couldn't finish it because I was too full from the other two courses. My boyfriend ordered the famous Baked Alaska (an additional $5). Neither of us had ever tasted this dessert so we didn't know what to expect, but we were very pleased. I can't rate the Baked Alaska because I have no other point of reference. Overall, it was a good dining experience. I wish I could give this place a 3.5 instead of a 3.

Also, I was starving since my appetizer was about 3 bites of pasta.  Too bad, because it was delicious, bathed in a light cream sauce with mushrooms and pancetta.  The cheesecake dessert was creamy and tangy, with a sweet blackberry sauce.  The service was very good; we received all of our courses promptly, and the waiter was sure to check in and make sure we didn't need anything.  I would not come back here and pay full price ($44 for filet)  if this is what I'm going to get...Chez Meredith is a fraction of the price and I hear the chef knows how to get a nice salt crust on a piece of filet...",1,2,1,Meredith F.,"Jamaica, NY",99,372,4
2.0,2/4/2010,"I went last night and I don't even know why this place is considered a steakhouse.  I had to wait about 15 mins before I got seated, which was understandable because they were very busy.  The restaurant was packed and there wasn't much room to move around.  Now for the food:1st course - Both me and my gf had the scallops and bacon.  Excellent choice and I really like it!!!!2nd course - I had the filet mignon and my gf had the chicken.  My gf said the chicken wasn't anything special and the noodles that it comes with wasn't so good either.  She wasn't satisfied with her meal.  I got my filet mignon and I thought it was a joke.  They said it's like a 10 ounce steak but when it comes out, it's like 5 ounces.  It was so small I finished it in less than 5 mins. (and I was eating slowly).  I realized I should have opted for the 20oz Delmonico steak (for $15 more).  I ordered the filet mignon medium and it was so dry and didn't have much taste to it.  I wasn't satisfied at all, I've experienced other steakhouses such as peter lugar, uncle jack, ben and jack's, and bobby vans and they all have better steak and huge portions. 3rd course - I had the cheesecake and it was nothing special, tasted like one from costco.  My gf had the baked alaska ($5 more) and I felt it was good in the beginning but at the end she felt that it was too creamy.  It was just an ok dessert because it was a little more unique but nothing to brag about.In conclusion, I feel that restaurant week at Delmonico is not worth it.  I paid about $100 in the end after tax, tip etc and the service wasn't good either.  Way too overcrowded.  The only deal you get out of restaurant week is the dessert probably at Delmonico's.  I would choose a different restaurant that have pre-fixe prices of over $50 regularly on their menu (such as One if by land, two if by sea) or any steakhouse that have better ratings and real steaks.  Hope this helps people.",0,0,1,Asian G.,"New York, NY",22,2,0
2.0,2/3/2010,"**Review from Restaurant Week Menu**Look, I know that restaurant week has a cheaper menu than your normal menu, but does that make it OK to serve me mediocre food? Could I afford to pay full price - sure - but it's restaurant week and you can try two restaurants for the price of one, so why the hell wouldn't I? The food on the prix fixe menu was obviously sitting out on a counter in the kitchen waiting for the wide-eyed restaurant week-ers to place their order. To start, my wife ordered the Torchio Pasta which was bland. I had the scallops with pork belly bacon - which was actually pretty tasty and might be the only reason I rated this place as two stars. For our main course my wife had the filet - which though big in size, was petite in flavor. I had the braised beef, which must have been braised with a heat lamp as it was very, very dry. For dessert we had the chocolate mousse and cheesecake. The mousse wasn't terrible, and the cheesecake wasn't the mousse.I worked in the restaurant business for a long time at a lot of different restaurants - I know it sucks to not make as much money on specials as you do on full price items.

3.0,1/31/2010,"Having newly moved to NY, I was excited to find out NYers had what San Franciscans call Dine About Town (Restaurant Week).  I opted for Delmonico's because the great sounding options they were offering for dinner.  We had 8 PM reservations along with the 6 couples of the same reservation.  We checked in and within 10 mins were seated to a table.  Then after only minutes of being seated our waiter hands us menus and we were served bread and butter. Unfortunately, things went down hill from here for my boyfriend.  He and I obviously noticed it was a full house and our waiter was one busy man, but this is a fine dining restaurant and even if it's Restaurant Week, we didn't need to be sitting there for a solid 25 minutes before given any attention.  Worst off, when we finally did get our waiter he rejects my request for a drinks menu.  There were the white and red wine option for Restaurant Week items, but I was hoping for glass of Cabernet with my entree.  Instead the waiter states there's a full bar and I had my  choice of ""whatever I like"".  Hello? No wine list to offer us at a steakhouse?!?!??? How ridiculous!For food, my boyfriend went with the scallop with bacon, filet mignon and cheesecake.  I ordered the mushroom pasta, braised boneless short ribs and Baked Alaska.  This was one roller coaster of a meal for the two of us.  His appetizer of one scallop and 2 pieces of bacon were divine.  Small to say the least, but tasted amazing.  My mushroom pasta was a good portion and was rich.  These items were an absolutely fantastic start!  Then our entrees come out to one very disappointed man and a delighted lady.  His filet was terrible!  Every bite tasted like cheap meat with a very livery aftertaste.  Mind you he ordered it cooked to medium rare, but it clearly came out medium.  Poor him!! This was supposed to wow him, but left him quite unsatisfied.  On the other hand, my braised beef was out of this world!  The meat melted in your mouth and the potatoes were airy goodness.  Onto the dessert: his cheesecake was petite and average at best, but my Baked Alaska was everything I imagined and more!In conclusion, if you want a great meal at $35, go with what I ordered.  If you want to disappoint yourself silly, go with what my boyfriend ordered.  I will admit, it was a good introduction to Restaurant Week and Delmonico's.  I'm totally willing to check this place out again for their regular menu.",0,1,1,Lisa R.,"Denver, CO",259,1003,60
4.0,1/30/2010,"I've always wanted to try Delmonico's, but didn't have the chance to until last night.  I didn't have any expectations until I arrived at the restaurant and read that the place has been around since the 1820s, and was where Chicken a la King (the name evolved from Chicken ala Keene), Baked Alaska, and the Delmonico steak (obviously) originated from.  The restaurant has an elegant feel, although it was slightly on the gothic side in my opinion (I sometimes felt as if I were dining inside a theme-park version of a haunted house).  Definitely a ""good ol' boys"" type place, and I'm sure scores of deals were struck inside those walls.  For the most part, everyone seemed to be in dressier attire, though not to the nines.  We were seated on time and in the center of the main dining room, where I could people watch and admire the artwork decorating the walls.The 3 of us ordered from the Restaurant Week menu and everything was shared.  I think it was the first time I actually walked away from a RW meal feeling FULL.  (What a novel idea!  Actually feeding your patrons!)  The scallops and bacon appetizer was a bit misleading, since ""scallops"" implies more than one and what came out was a single scallop atop a piece of pork belly.  No matter, it was heaven.  My chorizo chowder wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything mind blowing.  The torchio pasta was alright, but I thought it was missing something, as it was a little bland.  Now for the entrees.  My friend had the Chicken ala Keene, and while on its own it would be a pretty tasty dish, it was no match compared to our steak.  I ordered the filet cooked medium and quite honestly, it was the most tender piece of meat I have ever had, and I've had A LOT of steak.  It was like cutting into butter, and my friend didn't have an issue with cutting into a piece that I shared with him with a butter knife.  The potatoes that it was served with also had a very good flavor.  However, filet mignon, in general, is not as flavorful as other cuts of meat.  That being said, if you don't mind paying a little extra, go with the 20 oz. Delmonico steak.  The char was perfect and the flavor was sublime.  For dessert, skip the apple tart and cheesecake, and share the baked alaska.  You won't finish it on your own, trust me.I was pleasantly surprised by the speed at which our food was served, and the service overall at Delmonico's deserves an A+, from the hostesses to bartenders to the waiters.  We never had to ask for our water to be refilled.  In fact, my water glass never went empty.  If I had to complain about something, though, it would be about the time someone came to collect my plate and accidentally bumped into my chair with such force that it almost hurt.  He apologized of course.I'll definitely be back soon to sample the regular menu.  By the way, they've extended their Restaurant Week menu to 2/26.",1,0,0,McGibblets C.,"New York, NY",28,25,1

Despite it not being my first choice, it was a really nice cut of meat - tender and juicy and neither too small or too big.  The description indicated that it came with a side of brussel sprouts and my sprout loving friend was sorely disappointed when the ""side"" consisted of half of a single brussel sprout.  But the potato hash was yummy.  Saving the best for last - we split the chocolote mousse and the Baked Alaska for dessert.  I always say that I'd rather have three cocktail hours at a party than a dessert table but when I say the Baked Alaska was heavenly, I'm not kidding.  Almost orgasmic.  I wouldn't say that I would choose to go to Delmonicos again before trying out other steak houses in NYC but I was happy with my choice and if I wind up there again, I won't pout.",0,0,0,Meri S.,"New York, NY",50,137,0
3.0,1/29/2010,"With a number of steakhouses participating in restaurant week, it was difficult to narrow down which one has the best values. I decided on Delmonico's due to its long history and beautiful setting.The restaurant was bustling on a Tuesday evening, which surprised me (the area is usually so quiet at night), but we were seated promptly. We were situated at the edge of the room, so didn't get to appreciate the art and decor as much as some other reviewers did.All the food was solid. The sea scallop in the scallop appetizer was ever so slightly overcooked, but the delicious pork belly made up for that small mistake. The petite filet was cooked perfectly at a medium rare as requested, and very tender. The accompanying potato and vegetables were a fine contrast to the meat.My dining companion got the pasta appetizer, which was rich and reminiscent of a fine mac and cheese, and was studded liberally with pancetta. He also got the supplemental 16oz ribeye, which was a full-bodied, well flavored piece of meat. For dessert, we had the chocolate mousse (which he inhaled), and the supplemental baked alaska. Perhaps I am jaded, but the famed dessert didn't seem so special in this day and age. I found the banana flavor to be a little too strong, and none of the elements melded together for me.Overall, service was polite but detached. We didn't feel rushed, but were not comfortable enough to linger either. One small detail that I found odd at a restaurant like this: the bread service came out with cold, hardened foil-wrapped butter packets. I would probably not return to Delmonico's outside of a business-expense environment, but it was enjoyable to get a peek into one of the dwindling 'good ol boys' establishments in the city.",0,0,0,B Y.,"New York, NY",33,130,0

With my mom coming into town, I decided to make us a reservation for two.A crowd had formed around the entranceway when we stepped in, but even with all of the people, the I was drawn into the romantic, old time luxury of the upstairs dining room. The candelabra chandeliers, the large paintings, the white linen - every inch of the place was absorbing.After a half-hour wait, we were seated along the back wall, which gave a perfect view of the entire dining room. Clientele was a wide range, probably because of RW. You had men in suit jackets and dress shirts, some women in dresses, other women in jeans and sneakers. OpenTable, I believe, lists Delmonico's as having a casual dress code. But given the atmosphere, I'd suggest business casual at least.My choices for the Restaurant Week menu were the corn & chorizo chowder, the filet mignon, and the Baked Alaska. (Had to go with the latter after reading all the Yelp reviews!)The filet was just as good as I hoped it would be. Cut easily, smooth, great flavor, with a sauce that added just enough seasoning. There was a potato hash underneath that was delicious as well. I was full from the first two courses but had to finish all of it, yum yum.And the Baked Alaska lived up to the billing. The presentation was beautiful, and the dessert itself was so rich and creamy and...gah, I wish I had more of it now. It was wonderful.Service was curt but never rushed or dragged out the meal.It's nice when a place you've wanted to sample for awhile lives up to the reputation.

After years of wanting to give Restaurant Week a go, this is the first time that I've actually gone out for it. The more popular Japanese Fusion restaurants such as Morimoto and Nobu were my first choice but unfortunately they were only participating for lunch. Thus I moved on and eventually decided on having steak. When I came across Delmonico's, something inside told me to stop and take a look at them on Yelp. They seemed to have some pretty solid 5 and 4 star reviews and I noticed their normal menu item were quite pricey. This meant that eating here for Restaurant Week would be a bargain.We each ordered from the Restaurant Week menu which included an appetizer, an entrée and a dessert. For the appetizers we ordered 3 of the Corn, Crab And Chorizo Chowder, a Torchio Pasta and the Scallops And Bacon. The soup was filled with whole pieces of crab and corn and had a hint of spiciness which I really enjoyed. I'm not too sure about the chorizo but I'm sure it was in there somewhere. The Torchio Pasta came with a creamy sauce the most delicious roasted mushrooms ever. The Scallop and Bacon entrée came with a big scallop on top of a slightly grilled slab of bacon. It was fatty and delicious. For our entrees, my father and I both ordered the Filet Mignon grilled to medium and rare respectively. When our steaks came out they were actually medium and rare which I found quite amazing since usually when I eat out for steak it always arrives a level higher than what I ordered. My sister had the Angry Salmon which was good, despite my not being too crazy about salmon in general. My brother ordered the Braised Beef Short Ribs which were good but no match for my steak. My mother had the Classic Chicken Ala Keene which was a small roasted chicken quarter over buttered noodles. I wasn't too crazy about the noodles but that chicken almost made me decide to cram the whole thing in my mouth and suck on it, bone and all. Then I realized people would probably stare at me and the waiter staff might spit in my food. For dessert, we ordered 2 of the Idiazabal Cheesecake, an Apple Tart, the Chocolate Mousse and we added an extra $5 for the Baked Alaska which was Banana Ice Cream over a slice of Pound Cake and smothered in Whipped Cream and then torched. The result is a banana-y, crispy, creamy plate of yum! I think it's pretty obvious which one was my favorite.The service at Delmonico's is top notch. The waiters here provide the service and attention common in a snooty French restaurant but are still down to earth and friendly at the same time. At one point after our entrees arrived, my sister and I were taking pictures of our food when a waiter spotted us and decided to give us his pointers on getting a great looking picture. He even took a picture of my Filet Mignon for us to prove his skills. My glass of water was near empty and an empty plate never sat in front of me for more than a minute. I hope I don't get too used to the level of service I get from Delmonico's; otherwise I might get used to it and wind up being disappointed elsewhere.I am so thoroughly satisfied with my visit to Delmonico's tonight. The service and food was top notch. My parents, being the old-school Asians they are, kept complaining at first that portions are fancy American restaurants are so tiny and you'll never be full. They claimed that we'll just pay $35 a person and still be hungry. By the end of the meal, everyone was so stuffed that being the budget conscious New Yorker I am, I ended up stuffing the left over dessert down my already completely filled hatch. If they weren't so high end and expensive I would love to visit again; but since at normal prices a single entrée costs more than my appetizer, entrée and dessert tonight, I highly doubt that it is going to happen.",6,2,3,P C.,"Brooklyn, NY",235,206,145

Therein is my bias. I hate steak houses. I like meat---don't get me wrong, but I just despise the expected lack of creativity that comes with their cuisine. Had I known this in advance, I would have chosen Peter Luger's or something for that sort of fare.Anyway. Food was good. No complaints. The place reeked of faded classic glory. Once was cool, now was limping and riding on it's old reputation, like most geriatric classic restaurants are.Steak was delicious. Vegetables were not overcooked. Dessert was alright. Service was fine.  If the food was excellent, I would be able to tell you what I ordered exactly. But it was not. There was an annoying party of about 14 behind me that added a bit of a sports-bar like vibe to the otherwise quiet place. That was annoying. You do not find much of that sort of thing at newer upscale establishments I find, especially when they are not steakhouses.If you want a good steak, simple cuisine, and a presumably quiet atmosphere in the morgue-like silence of the financial district at night---go there.Naw, not for me again.

All delicious.The decor felt old-world, or at least Mad Men as another reviewer put it. The silverware and knives were good quality. The only complaint I have is that we could hear some loud and rude comments made at a table near us filled with douchy guys, and the staff should have interrupted them.I'm well aware that the current restaurant isn't the original, and that some of their claims aren't exactly true, but that doesn't detract from the fact that it's still a great restaurant with good food and a good atmosphere.

5.0,9/7/2009,"So I'm usually pretty skeptical of restaurant week.  Because the restaurant week menus are usually a less-expensive, less-delicious subset of restaurants' regular menus.Enter Delmonico's.  $35 got me lobster bisque, filet mignon, and a choice of 4 desserts.  I looked at the restaurant week menus of several other Manhattan steakhouses and Delmonico's was the only one that included high quality steak.How was it?  Incredible.  The lobster bisque was great.  The filet mignon was tender and moist (and served atop some really delicious mashed potatoes).  And the dessert (I ordered a berry yogurt treat) was tasty, capping off a truly wonderful meal.  And did I mention I only spent $35?  I know restaurant week is now over, but I loved my meal so much that I can say with confidence that I would gladly pay full price next time (which is about double what the restaurant week menu costs).Also, the service was excellent and the table was nice (the restaurant was not packed at 9 PM on a Friday night, and the tables were sufficiently far apart to create a very intimate vibe).  Not noisy at all.  Very romantic - definitely recommended for dates.Basically, Delmonico's is fabulous and I highly recommend it to anyone, restaurant week or not.",1,1,2,Pam C.,"Chicago, IL",39,241,1

The filets were well, filets can't go wrong there. I was surprised by the portions. Normally, during restaurant week I expect them to downsize the portions. Our waiter was really nice and attentive.

My girlfriend orders the iceberg lettuce. It is loaded with raw onions, which might be my personal preference, but disgusting in a salad. Also, the bleu cheese is just dressing that you can get for buffalo wings, while I would expect delicious crumbled bleu cheese.The bread that they give is ridiculously stale and cold. I'm surprised they would serve that.The entire table ordered the filet mignon. It really does melt in your mouth. They do know how to cook a steak.

I tried the medium that my grandmother go and it is a huge disappointment.For dessert, the yogurt with berry compote again has temperature problems.

His rare was more medium-rare and my ""extra rare"" was about medium-rare as well.  Being a steakhouse, I thought they'd atleast get that right, but no such luck.The desserts were a major disappointment as well.  The chocolate cake my boyfriend ate was almost inedible.. like a dried out hostess cake, although the hostess cake would have been better.  The dessert I ordered was a poor excuse for a panna cotta, more like a McDonalds yogurt parfait in fancy stemware.Hopefully this was an off-night for Delmonico's in terms of food and service because I expected much more from them.  I'm glad I tried them out during restaurant week for $35 + wine, but I wouldn't go back.  As for the service?  Definitely lacking in that department as well.  Go for the history and decor, not for the food.",1,0,0,Robyn N.,"Santa Monica, CA",39,39,10

And even though $24.07 is about 3x what I normally pay for lunch, I figured it was a good opportunity to try one of those New York classics. And I'll gladly hop on board for any social activity my co-workers are down for. It's quite rare to tear those bankers away from their spreadsheets long enough for any meaningful quality time. When we walked in and were instructed to check our coats, I knew what I was in for. At noon the place was empty and they whisked us downstairs and sat us between the kitchen and the men's room. Naturally, it started to smell after a bit and when one colleague complained, the staff proceeded to empty half a can of Glade aerosol spray into the room. Nothing kills taste buds like a mouthful of Lilies of the Valley.I can't deny it though -- the food was very good (even if the portion sizes looked too small to satiate even a toddler). I had the scallop and potato soup (loved it!), the braised beef, and the chocolate/hazelnut cake. And the service was excellent. But most importantly, a good time was had by all.

3.0,1/22/2009,"***3.5 stars*** Ok, I know this is a steakhouse, but I don't eat beef. But I did have the Restaurant Prix Fixe lunch menu, which has many other options that didn't include beef, so I was happy. The beet and goat cheese salad was simple and tasty. Garnished with a side of micro-green arugula, the salad was a perfect combination of flavors and texture and the dressing didn't compete with either the beet or cheese. Loved it. The stuffed sole, on the other hand, was another story. I really liked the parsnip (or was it celery root) puree, but the actual fish was a little on the bland side and a little dry. Not a fan of the fish, but it was either that or chicken. Maybe I should have had the chicken. There was also a braised beef option. The dessert, well lets just say it - it was fantastic. You have the option of a chocolate hazelnut mousse or a poached pear in port. Both desserts are divine. If I could eat three of those poached pears instead of my entire meal, I would be happy. The service was a little on the slow side, and I understand that this is a place that encourages you to take your time. However, lunch service should be a little speedier than dinner service, especially if you are offering a restaurant week menu. I mention the latter because it encourages people who don't normally dine at Delmonicos to try it out, and they aren't the CEO's. I.e., I need to be back to my desk within my lunch hour.

The filet mignon was 3 sets of yummy and the sides that were chosen (some potato dish, spinach and mushrooms) were also wonderfully delightful.The added bonus is to be eating at a place with such history...opened since 1846 (I think) and the creator of many notable dishes like the Baked Alaska and eggs Benedict.

Delish!!! It was the perfect consistancy of creamy and smooth....like a well aged cognac....For desert I ordered a sampler mix for my clients and I and ended up in desert Heaven!!! They made a crepe for us, which was basically crispy crepe surrounding a chocolate carmel icercream concoction that sounds weird but tastes utterly divine, and a ricotta cream cheesecake which was light and amazing fluffy for a cheesecake, a godiva chocolate devils cake...super chocolately so not really my thing but still utterly Yum!!!I would def recomment Del monicos for a nice client dinner or a fancy 1st date...not really a casual place, Most wall streeters frequent this place....",0,0,0,Renee M.,"New York, NY",128,343,25

Didn't see any gristle at all, and the meat just melts in your mouth. I'm not a big chocolate fan, but the chocolate desert my friends had were really good.I had the vanilla version, which in my opinion was a little eggy, and the cinnamon wasn't that subtle. All in all, I would go there again, but restaurant week offers a great deal. People seemed to dress up a bit more here, so if you're a little insecure, then I encourage it, though they didn't not NOT seat anyone wearing jeans (jeans are acceptable too).Opentable.com made ""making reservations"" very easy.",1,0,1,A H.,"Manhattan, NY",61,208,426
1.0,5/19/2008,"If only yelp would let me give negative stars, this place would rate a negative 5 stars from me. Delmonico's only success was winning my #1 worst dining experience ever in my life. Hands down. An expensive mistake.I don't know why I had such a atypical experience from the other diners at Delmonico's. Maybe I caught them on a bad night, or maybe it's because they treat out of towners differently. Either way or for whatever reason it was I get the sense that fame induced cockiness has gotten to it's head for this so-called ""institution"".  To name all the culinary and dining experience injustices would take the next week to type, so here is just a quick run down:- Being seated nearly an hour after our reserved time. - Proceeded to sit at empty table with absolutely NOTHING (bread, menu, plates, silverware..etc) for another 30 minutes. - Nonexistant service. The only person that came by the table on a regular bases was the water boy. Even when we finally did get some service the waiters seem like they can't get away fast enough. They literally ran away 3 words into a sentence. The specials of the day were spat out in incomprehensible gibberish and we can never once finish talking before a waiter actually runs away.    - The 20-40 minute wait between ANYTHING. This was a major killer. After sitting down, wait. Get water, wait. Ordering drinks, wait. Get the menu, wait. Order appetizers, wait wait wait. Appetizers arrive, appetizers long finished, wait some more before someone takes our entree orders. Then, waited for another 40+ minutes for our steak to arrive. - The whole meal probably lasted something like 4 hours.- Appetizers all tasted in the range of Bleh to Ugh! Lobster bisque, cold and had the appearance like the cream is starting to separate.- Salad had a puke-ish looking & tasting dressing.- Tuna carpaccio, stale. Yes, stale. Very questionable.  - After waiting for literally hours the Double Porterhouse ($79, pre-tax) finally arrives. Precut, juiceless, and COLD. Cold like it's been sitting outside on a winter's day cold. - I have tasted better sides from TGIFridays on a late Wednesday night. And this is coming from a famished me. Usually by this point I would have no second thoughts about throwing the plate across the dining room and demand to talk to a manager. But when the steak finally arrived we've been there for so long and we were So hungry. We really just wanted the horrible night to end so we can get the fock out of there. My birthday was already beyond ruined and we didn't have any more intentions of staying there. Besides, at the rate things were going it's gonna be more long waits for some service and eventually get to talk to the manger. It just all wasn't worth it. The boyfriend and I decided that we were going to salvage my birthday celebration somewhere else. My boyfriend being the nice guy that he is, still tipped a full 20% on top of the $$$$ bill.

1.0,2/27/2008,"So terribly disappointing! We'd heard so much about Delmonico's and were so looking forward to a special night out and it was just a big fat -- and EXPENSIVE -- disappointment.  Pros: Lovely old-European-world interior, with warm red and wood-toned accents and huge murals and high ceilings, etc., etc. The waiters had snazzy matching outfits and side-parted salt-and-pepper hairdos. The garlic and chive potato puree was pretty good. The complementary bread basket and the mini-dessert platter were divine.  Cons: Our entrees were just not good. I had the lobster and for the first time ever had it presented with the carved-out head propped up on the plate, with its little beseeching dead eyes staring accusingly up at me. I'm an already guilt-ridden omnivore and was just grossed out instantly. I made the hubs remove it (and wasn't so grossed out that it prevented me from actually eating). The lobster meat and its brandy cream sauce were just okay, nothing special at all -- worse yet, it had a vague fishy smell. It was a little better when eaten with the toast that came with it, but we expected MUCH more for one of the priciest dishes on the menu! The hubs had the ahi tuna, which was encrusted with a nearly inedible pepper coating. I took a bite and started coughing. He tends to react strongly to spice -- he, er, sweats. And he was leaking copious buckets while trying to eat this tuna. He scraped off as much of the coating as possible, and the inner parts of the tuna were quite good, but the peppery haze lingered with him (and ON him until he showered that night!). He'd actually had the tuna before once as carry-out and raved about it then, which made it that much more of a letdown.Worse yet, the waiter never came by once to check on how we liked the food, or ask why the hubs was mopping his face with a napkin, or even refill our water glasses. I had the distinct impression that he snubbed us for other older, more important-looking Wall Street wheeler-and-dealer types.I wavered between bestowing one or two stars and ultimately decided on one -- considering Delmonico's rep and price point, for both entrees to be so disappointing is inexcusable.",4,0,2,Malini B.,"New York, NY",2,37,0

5.0,2/13/2008,"Beautiful, old-world atmosphere with gracious, high calibre service. I love places like this which make me feel as if I'm stepping into another world - both in time and place - it's thrilling and luxurious.I came here during a promotional FiDi restaurant week with a friend, so we had only 3 choices for each of the 3 courses, and we ended up each choosing the same items - Buffalo Mozzarella and Roasted Tomato Salad (Balsamic Glaze, Roasted Pepper, Extra Virgin Olive Oil), Filet Mignon w/ caramelized onions over mashed potatoes, and the inaccurately named Apple Crisp.All portions were moderately sized, and so we left completely full but not unpleasantly so.  I wouldn't have called the appetizer a 'salad' - more a cheese plate, the bufala accented by delicious olive oil, ribbons of roasted peppers and tomatoes, and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar. Simply lovely.The steak was excellent, cooked just to our specifications, tender, flavourful, and completely free of gristle and rubbery fat. The caramelized onion sauce accompanied the steaks well, as did the buttery, melt-in-your-mouth mashed potatoes. Delmonico's has an excellent wine list including one of my all-time favourite Italian reds, so we had a bottle of that and this only added to the our lip-smacking.We wouldn't have needed dessert but it was of course included, and we aren't girls to turn down dessert. The apple crisp, however, was not  a crisp - it was a tart more in the style of a French patisserie, with slices of peeled apple artfully arranged in shell of flaky phyllo pastry, lightly glazed with a dollop of fresh whip cream on top. Tasty! I think considering the rich steaks, it worked better as a dessert for us than a true crisp would have, but beware that the menu descriptions here are not so accurate.5 stars for food, service, wine list, and atmosphere.

4.0,2/7/2008,"You'll have to forgive me for committing the ultimate Yelp faux pas by yelping a restaurant based on an experience with Restaurant Week, but hey, I've got a budget here and felt that I owed myself the opportunity to check out this institution while I had the chance.  I did a lunch here with a friend last Friday and definitely enjoyed it.Arriving at noon, I was surprised how quiet it was, but by our main course, the entire main dining room was full. The red-rimmed plates, wood walls and finely dressed staff scream old-school New York (which to them must be a compliment), but the clientele seemed to be more local workers having an unusual weekday lunch out than the power Wall St. regulars. Maybe it was that they steer clear of the RW crowd, but it could have also been that the stock market's been sinking like a 5 gram lure of late. I'm happy to have had the experience, but won't be running back in a hurry. Since we ordered off the Restaurant Week menu, our service was adequate, but could have been friendlier. I started with Potato Leek soup which was delicious, but slightly under flavored and had salmon for my main that was equally delicious and high quality, yet  somewhat bland.

4.0,1/28/2008,"Came here during restaurant week when I came to visit in January 2008. I definitely encourage visiting during restaurant week to take advantage of the great deals (especially when you're the one buying). The place has a place in American history, which you can definitely can feel from the heavy hand in wooden and 19th century Americana decor. You can almost imagine J.P. Morgan sitting in one of the dining tables, drinking cognac. Decor aside, the food was good but probably not the best steak I ever had (currently, that award goes to Boboquivari's in SF). The salad was good but not memorable and the filet mignon was cooked perfectly at medium rare. Dessert was chocolate lava cakes, which of course I cannot resist (do all steakhouses serve chocolate souffle or lava cakes?.. I think I see a trend...).

We're not sure whether that means it's been in continuous operation the longest or what, but the space has history, for sure.It's definitely a special occasion restaurant, with the prices to show for it. But for the experience and the quality of the food, it's worth it. C. got the salmon and the mushroom side. The salmon was good -- not great -- and the assortment of mushrooms was quite impressive. We're jazzed to have leftovers. I ordered the ""classic"" Delmonico's steak, which might have been the best steak I've ever had. The baked potato I got on the side was a sad second to this amazing piece of meat. Wow. The kind of meat you have to close your eyes to chew. Amazing.We also got dessert: the molten chocolate cake. It was also quite good, especially with a cappuccino to seal the meal. A solid ending.I didn't get a chance to look around the restaurant too much, but the decor is sumptious. Heavy. Warm. With classic paintings of society types adorning the walls. We're not sure whether the fixtures are original to the restaurant -- when the space was redone, how much was kept? How much is new? -- but it's nice to eat at a place with ""show plates.""One disappointment. The restrooms are off a bar adjacent to the restaurant. The bar has a separate entrance and doesn't possess the weight or charm of the dining room's decor. Feels like a different place entirely, and I get the sense that it gets a different clientele.
