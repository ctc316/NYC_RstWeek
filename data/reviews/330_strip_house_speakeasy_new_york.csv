Not only did the staff provide remarkable service as always, and not only was the food amazing as always, but as a symbol of appreciation for bringing Halloween to the restaurant, we were treated to dish after dish which we didn't order, and delicious champagne to end the evening.

4.0,9/10/2018,Pricey steakhouse but it has a nice old school charm. It's a bit cramped inside with your neighboring tables but that is new york for you. Very dark ambiance so it's a place to wow a client but i would say necessarily a date since its cramped.The go to dish here is the bone in strip or the aged bone in rib eye. Wonderful tender flavor with a nice pepper and salt crust. The oyster appetizers were also great 6 east/ 6 west. Wonderful of the sea flavor. I'd forgo the sides as none of them stood out and you can save a few bucks. The dessert of the night had to be the layer chocolate cake. Large portion which was enough to serve 4. Had to take it home as there were leftovers. It's a pricey place but the steak was spot on.,3,1,3,Kevin C.,"New York, NY",1570,775,1785
5.0,8/12/2018,One of the best steakhouses I've been to. The ambience is out of this world. The service was awesome. The dry aged filet I ordered was outstanding. Served with roasted garlic for the steak and it was mouthwatering. All of the steaks get the roasted garlic. The sides were all fantastic.

4.0,2/7/2018,"Went here with a friend to check out this place for restaurant week.After perusing the menu, I decided to go with the onion soup, the strip steak, and the vanilla pear cake.The onion soup wasn't your conventional French onion soup option as it came in a bowl with a mini grilled gruyere cheese sandwich on the side for dipping. This seemingly simple dish actually was quite tasty and definitely was a hearty opening to the meal.For the main course, I opted for the strip steak (we were at a steak house after all). The strip steak was good--not outstanding though and the portion size was a bit small. The potatoes and Brussels sprouts were also decent, but nothing to write home about.I finished the meal with the vanilla pear cake with pumpkin ice cream. I am not sure if I really understood the pairing, but the pumpkin ice cream was absolutely delicious! The cake was decent as well, but definitely got outshone by the ice cream. I also had a bite of my friend's banana bread pudding, which was also very tasty.Overall, this place serves up some great food at a decent price for restaurant week. Not sure I would order the steak again with the +10 supplement on the Restaurant Week menu, but everything else was very good.",3,0,1,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",746,1843,225
2.0,2/1/2018,"Didn't enjoy our Restaurant Week dinner. The choices were unusual and not satisfying. Kale and Brussel sprout salad with a runny poached egg on top?? Just plain weird. We paid the $10 supplement for the steak option but the portion was quite small. More than a small tablespoon of mashed potatoes seemed warranted.Despite the food, the service was great.

3.0,1/8/2018,"I had been to Strip House a couple times but this was my first time at their Speakeasy location. Their Speakeasy is much smaller but decor and ambiance are the same as next door. I would recommend their Speakeasy if you're looking for something more casual. Food was really good and was consistent with my previous meals at Strip House. We really enjoyed the bone-in New York strip and dry-aged rib eye. As for sides, the crispy goose fat potatoes were good but the charred broccoli was a bit odd since it was drenched with the miso butter. I would give 4 stars but we had a bad experience with the service.

1.0,12/22/2017,"They seated us at a two top along a wall with a bench next to a party of roughly 15, 25 year old guys. Unfortunately, 15 became 20+ people, and they kept trying to cram bodies into the small, overcrowded space. At one point, my Wife was literally being squashed by a guy who was on the bench but nowhere near the table (since it was too small). Every time he got up (often), his ass would graze our table, drinks etc.  The restaurant decided to ignore the problem until I forced them to move our table. At that point they were nice and bought me a drink and offered free dessert, but the meal was ruined. We had a $140 bottle of wine, apps, two steaks - about $400 total - all a waste. The food is admittedly great. But we couldn't get cocktails because ""the bartender was backed up.""  Our apps came out with 3 mins of ordering and our steaks within 15 mins. Food arrived before wine. The bus boys spent the entire night focusing on the frat party next to us - so I ate most of my meal with no water, no cocktail and no wine. Awful experience and terrible management. I appreciate the effort once I forced them to do something, but the fact that they were going to look the other way is unacceptable. They should never have let the frat boys simply pack in more and more bodies. As for the guys? Learn how to behave in public. You are too old to act like that.  I get that you all work for I-banks (per your duffels) and its bonus season - been there, done that - but start acting your age.",1,0,0,Patrick H.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,2,0

5.0,5/4/2017,My husband and I came here for date night and we had no regrets. We both got the Dry-Aged New York Strip. He got a side of fries. I got a side of creamed spinach. The order of fries is massive. He managed to eat the steak but couldn't put a dent in the fries. I ate half my steak but couldn't get enough of the creamed spinach. That is not to say the steak wasn't delicious. It was a great steak but the portions are quite large and I cannot eat an entire 14 oz steak in one sitting.I didn't think there was any room for dessert but my husband wanted to try the cheesecake. The slice was enormous! We couldn't even finish it between the two of us. We tried to because it was so good.The service was top notch. Our waitress/hostess was very friendly and accommodating. The servers were all on top of things. Our water glasses were never empty. It's very pricey but most great steakhouses are.

Surprisingly good was the Poutine Fries, took me back to the ones I had in Canada. The burger called the Big Stinky was on point, I got it medium well, that cheese tasted good on it, but the egg was a good addition to it. Tasted so good when I took that first bite.

4.0,4/26/2015,Loved this place. It's very elegant and an enjoyable atmosphere. It is very pricey so if your not able to enjoy that then don't go there. We ordered the fresh mozzarella which was absolutely delicious. It's not on the menu so make sure to ask about it. We also had an order of scallops appetizer which was delicious. That's also not in the menu so make sure to ask about that as well. It came with beets and a fruity sauce which was great. As our main portion we got the 8oz filet mignon which was great. MAKE SURE TO ORDER THE SIDE OF CREAMED SPINACH! That was delicious. We also got the salmon which was okay. I wasn't the greatest fan however the quinoa that came with it was amazing!

1.0,6/12/2014,"Two of the guys in our party had positive experiences at The Strip House so we were all very excited for a great steak dinner at the Strip House Next Door.Our excitement died immediately upon walking inside the Strip House Next Door.First, the only other patrons in the restaurant were wearing New York Rangers jerseys. This isn't anything against the Rangers, but I don't think ""smart casual"" should include sports jerseys when you are about to drop $150/pp.Now honestly, the sports jerseys isn't a big deal, but what was a big deal is that while still visually processing the sports jerseys, my brain started screaming at me and forcing my attention to the smell reaching my nose.Many Yelp reviews try to use humor or exaggeration, but I say this in the most literal sense: the restaurant absolutely reeked like an industrial strength cherry urinal cake. Any normal steakhouse whets your appetite with the smell of bacon and cooked ribeye, but with every breathe we all were gagging on the scent of cherry Robitussin a$$hole. Nevertheless, we still sat down and ordered drinks thinking that like all smells, we will become accustomed to it and won't smell it anymore. About 15 minutes later, our waiter brought us out an amuse-bouche. Now, taste is largely based upon smell. When we tried to eat the amuse-bouche, all we could taste was cherry a$$hole.Looking to rectify the situation, we went upstairs to ask the maitre 'd if there was an open table at The Strip House. My personable and happy-go-lucky friend Benji B. explained the situation, but the maitre 'd rudely retorted that it doesn't smell and he didn't want to hear the complaint again and that there was no room upstairs. I'll tell ya this - every employee in there knows it smells like cherry a$$hole because it really was THAT bad.Fortunately, a member of our party mentioned that Gotham Bar and Grill was right across the street. I ran over there, explained our situation to their very nice matre 'd over and she immediately was able to prepare us a table for 6. We had a fantastic meal at Gotham with great service, well-dressed patrons, but clearing our noses of urinal cake was the best treat of all.

4.0,2/5/2014,"I've dined here several times now and I have to say I enjoy the more ""casual"" aspects of the dining experience but could do with a little better service to match it's Strip House name.  We've been seated on the high tops, at the bar, near the bar... the story is always the same:  Cramped space.  Just enough table room.  Cold by the door (in cold weather, steer CLEAR of sitting near the door, that velvet sheet is NOT enough to protect you!).  Close enough to servers to hear the ins and outs of service.  Let me explain what I mean by the last comment... when I sit at a table and can literally eavesdrop all night on the restaurant innerworkings and waiters saying things like ""Table XX said they didn't ask for bottled water so comp it.  Table YY needs more bread.  Table ZZ wants more butter"" that probably means that the waiters should keep their voices down or at least make the innerworkings of the operation a tad more quiet.  I also didn't appreciate on my last visit when I was seated near the TV and a waiter who was on duty kept staring at the Knicks game and fist pumping discreetly as I tried to get his attention for a refill on water.  Maybe I'm wrong but I feel if I'm spending over $100+pp on a meal, I should expect better service... am I wrong?Anyway - food wise, the food is great.  I particularly recommend sharing the Porterhouse for 2 and getting it with sides of mushroom and creamed spinach.  Absolutely out of this world.  The food is absolutely worth the price and I honestly prefer this more casual dining experience to upstairs.  Drinks are also great.  The bartenders know their stuff.  Recommend it!",4,0,0,Diane C.,"Hoboken, NJ",244,531,7

4.0,3/31/2012,"I'm a big fan of Strip House and always recommend it to individuals as a good place to go for a steak that doesn't have as much of a business crowd or old boy's club atmosphere to it so when I found out they opened a grill next door with burgers I had to stop by to check it out. They have the full Strip House menu available as well as a few additions. We tried the littlenecks, roasted bacon, short rib burger, the bacon & cheddar burger,  goose fat potatoes, sauteed wild mushrooms, and sauteed green beans. The burgers were the only new items we were trying and while they were good, I didn't particularly find that they stand out from the crowd of premium burger places I can spend my money at. While they were cooked perfectly, the meat itself wasn't particularly flavorful. My suggestion to them would be to season the meat a little more and to use the roasted bacon on their bacon & cheddar burger. That would definitely set it apart from others even if they have to price it higher.  The atmosphere for the venue is great though. It's small and cozy and definitely fits for when you just want to stop by and grab a drink/steak with no fuss. Great if you are solo and also a small group. Overall a solid addition and I can see why they expanded to that space. I would go back to grab a rib-eye anytime.",1,0,0,K S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,17,0
