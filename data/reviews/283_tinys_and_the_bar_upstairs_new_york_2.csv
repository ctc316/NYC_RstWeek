I've called numerous times, sent numerous emails and no one has gotten back to me. It's completely unacceptable.  I will never again book a client event at Tiny's due to their absurd cancellation policy and horrible customer service.

5.0,4/5/2019,Tiny's was amazing.  The food was incredible as was the service.  The venue is a delightful building from 1810.  I met the general Manager Mac who was a really great guy.  I highly recommend trying the duck and the steak for mains and getting the house made tater tots.,0,0,0,Andrew S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0
1.0,3/30/2019,Boo. In from out of town and researched brunch spots and this place for good reviews. The place itself is cool w tiny cozy interior. Drinks were tasty. Brunch food was extremely underwhelming. Maybe we made bad choices ordering but I make a much tastier omelette at home. This one was so flavorless it was sad brunch times. Tater tots wanted to be good but they too had a bland taste. Anyways. For 100 dollars for two people to eat brunch def won't be returning.,0,0,0,Catherine h.,"Richmond, VA",0,36,0
3.0,3/29/2019,"Came here for dinner last night with three friends and we made a reservation. The food and drinks were amazing (a little overpriced but very good) and the atmosphere was as cozy as promised. My one complaint was the staff working last night. We ordered drinks and apps and immediately I felt like they were trying to kick us out the door the second that we said that we wouldn't be ordering mains, but keep in mind we got pricey drinks and 3 different appetizers. The waitress asked us ""what do you want after your appetizers?"" But I feel like the question should have been ""would you like anything else?"" She immediately came off snobby. The staff was so rushy that they started to take away dishes when we weren't done, and even when we were going to pay, 3/4 of our credit cards were with the bill because we just got it and they almost took it away! It was rediculous! This dinner was to catch up with old friends and I felt a very nasty vibe from the staff.",0,0,0,Jaclyn M.,"New York, NY",1,3,0
4.0,3/22/2019,I didn't give five stars because I just don't usually buy they probably deserved it. The place is close and warm and reminds you of an old world pub that you normally wouldn't  be in but you're glad that you are. It's like that favorite Hemingway looking briefcase you carry that's a little warn around the edges but fits you so well you can't bare to be without it.I ordered a goat cheese salad with added salmon and a rye Old Fashioned for lunch. Don't judge!!! Sounds simple enough right? I read something once that stuck with me. The hardest things to do in cooking are usually the simplest and have the least ingredients. There's no room for error. Everything was crisp and fresh and when I finished there wasn't a pool of dressing in the bottom of my bowl. Dressing was seasoned perfectly. Not too salty and not too bitter. It hit the Goldilocks zone. Just right. Salmon was the same or better. The flesh was pink and moist (yes I know people hate that word and I don't care) and the skin was crisp like a cracker. Again...flawless. Nice flake and wonderful mouth texture. The meal came with two beautiful multi grain toast slices. I bake sourdough and can tell it had good crumb and good crust. The flavor profile was subtle but distinct. I spread the goat cheese across it and again...spectacular. What can I say about a properly made Old Fashioned? If the first sip sends tendrils of euphoria inside your skull to massage your brain then it's a proper drink. This one...two...were like master class masseuse. Well balanced. Big cubes and not too many. No ridiculous 8 ball of sugar at the bottom because they use a simple syrup made from demerara sugar. If I'm not mistaken demerara sugar has a higher molasses content and gives a really nice undertone of sweetness without banging you over the head. I still want to taste the booze. In short...get there if you can. You won't be disappointed.,0,0,0,Peter D.,"Pelham, NY",35,37,14

I think it had some sort of berry reduction. My friend got the scallops, they were good but super rich! Great portion sizes, definitely worth it.

When I wrote a review of my near death experience, at Tiny's, due to a sesame allergy, not imagining that a meatball dish would have sesame seeds, it was before the full blown after effects of the meatballs kicked in. These meatballs will make your breath so horrific and repulsive that you will have to hide until they are out of your system. It is worse than a skunk's odor! Aside from that, at the time, I couldn't bring myself to admit that I saw the bartender, of the downstairs bar, smell the concoction that he made, that was for patrons, and then take a few tastes! Tiny's is a cute place, with a step back in time atmosphere, and I'm glad that so many people must be so inebriated to not notice the things I did, but a place with a TripAdvisor Certificate of Excellence should be better in their cleanliness, customer service, and respect for the customer.",0,0,0,April S.,"New York, NY",17,54,6

First of all Tiny's is yes, somewhat small but it has a very chill, welcoming vibe that I absolutely love. Everyone that works here is extremely nice, pleasant and accommodating. Cocktails are $16 a piece but I usually order wine here. There was a white wine special by the glass for $13 that my friend and I enjoyed. As far as the food goes, it is fantastic. Being someone who despises kale, I actually am obsessed with their Kale Salad. It is covered in a sharp Gouda  and filled with all sorts of goodness. I couldn't have been happier to see that this salad was offered on their Restaurant Week menu as an appetizer (I usually get this as my main course). In addition to the salad, which was full size by the way, I had the Pepper Crusted Hangar Steak which was incredible. Perfectly cooked and seasoned medium rare steak with crispy potatoes and some cool, creamy onion confit. Perfect mix of flavors and consistencies. My friend ordered the Salmon and said that it perfectly cooked - a very healthy option as it comes with tons of veggies and no carbs.I don't eat dessert but my friend had the Kit Kat which she said was great. Lastly, I almost forgot about this - Tiny's serves warm, soft, gooey rolls with a honey butter - it is divine and not overly heavy.

The loaded egg sandwich is indeed loaded, and the bread is somehow perfectly thick and buttery. Also, the hash browns / fries on the side were incredibly good.

5.0,7/20/2018,!!! Obsessed. The decor is reminds me of a bar in London. Drinks were $16 but SPECTACULAR. I'd recommend the mango Linda or the fire and ice!

1.0,7/5/2018,I came here for lunch with a friend and was very disappointed with the service and food.  After being seated we ordered our food within 5 minutes or so.  I ordered the chicken sandwich with fries and my friend ordered the chicken-kale salad.  I thought both things were priced too high (around $18) but figured the food would be worth it.  We went for lunch so I also figured the food would come out quickly.  I was wrong on both accounts.  After waiting 30 minutes (an entire lunch break for some) I politely asked that the food be made to go.  When I finally got back to my desk at work I was extremely disspointed with my order.  The sandwich was very meager and not worth $18.00 at all.  Our total bill for the two orders and a coffee and soda was around $50. I won't be returning.,0,0,0,Enrique G.,"New York, NY",0,5,1

They were so bad we decide to just get outta there - sad about this bc it's walking distance from our apt.

I told my wife we should go to Tiny's since I had heard good reviews from friends.  Although Odeon is up the block (and is a favorite of my wife from her NYC days), we decided to try something different. Oh what a mistake... We should've stuck with our original plans.  Tiny's is way over priced for what it is... I know they're located in Tribeca but they shouldn't be able to charge the prices they do for not so good food.  There's nothing extraordinary about this place, other than the decor and location.  I wish I could tell you that my wife and i's wait of over 40 minutes (with a not too packed restaurant) was worth the wait, but I can't.  The food was just okay.  I had 2 eggs over easy, Apple chicken sausage & toast for $25 bucks... And my wife had a $21 burger.  Since we waited over 40 minutes for the meal, they comp us the price of the burger, but it still didn't allay the sting.  My wife and I are foodies so we don't mind paying for good food, but this is just okay food, nothing to write Yelp about.  If you're looking for a place keep walking for something more fitting of your hard earned cash.",0,0,0,Saulo S.,"Jersey City, NJ",13,5,1

I live in the neighborhood and have been to this place many times and mostly had great experiences. The last time I came there was a really long wait for the food and the chicken in the kale salad was really rubbery, but the waitress comped our drinks without us asking due to issues with the new chef. I came back tonight with a friend and got the kale salad again; however, after a few bites I bit into something really hard. I thought it was a raw vegetable, but when I took it out of my mouth it was an inch long piece of white plastic. I told the waiter and asked for a new salad and if he could tell the chef and see what it was since I an pregnant and concerned about what I just put in my mouth. He came back two minutes later with a ""new""? salad and didnt even apologize or follow up with the chef. He also didnt comp the salad or even a drink or side. We asked to speak to the manager after paying our bill and the manager John only said ""I apologize and will look into it."" Very poor customer service and unsanitary.

2.0,4/25/2018,Fairly disappointing from the moment I walked in.  I was meeting a friend and when I arrived first and sat down the two glasses on the table were dirty and one was filled with a quarter of water.  I reached to grab a glass from a table next to ours and that glass was dirty as well.  Not a good first impression.  The waiter seemed overwhelmed as he was manning many tables.  Felt bad for the guy.  While he was nice he wasn't super attentive.  I don't necessarily blame him but rather mgmt for not allocating the correct # of staff for that shift.  The food itself was decent.  Nothing to write home about.  For reference we were there for dinner.  I had the steak and my friend had the burger.  If I had to go back I'd likely just get a drink.,0,0,0,Andrew F.,"New York, NY",3,200,0

Specialty drinks were pricey ($16) at lounge level but weren't anything special.The highlight was tater tots, which is on the salty side. They did balance well with the drunken donuts as appetizers. The rest of the entrees were more ordinary. Things seemed to look better in the pictures than they tasted.

I could substitute gluten-free bread on the egg sandwich, pushing the price to $23 (side note: I'm not paying $23 for an egg sandwich). The server suggested either the omelette or salad when I inquired about gluten free options, as a lot of things that seemed like they would be gluten-free (or have a gluten-free option) were not (huevos rancheros, a quinoa dish).

We came in for a quiet late lunch and it wasn't crowded, yet somehow took at least 40 minutes to get our salad and sandwich. No apology or acknowledgement of the wait, and no one checked on us at all except to bring the bill. I was pretty pissed off but didn't feel it was worth complaining so we left about a 16% tip, very uncharacteristic ally, and left. A waitress (not ours) ran out after us and was incredulously asking if there was something wrong with the service. Given the opportunity, I explained the reasons that we were unsatisfied. She then demanded to know why we left ZERO tip. I had to go back into the restaurant and make her count our money again because apparently the people who work here would rather humiliate a customer than use basic math.

The matzoh ball soup is nice, it has stuff and isn't just broth, and it's big enough that it can be split, which they'll do for you. The coconut shrimp was good, more of a spice flavor than coconut, nice and crispy, but I thought scandalously small for the price. The kale salad is good. The chicken was solid, as was the salmon. They don't give you a hard time about substituting or taking out sides. The drinks are innovative and good. The service is friendly and attentive but definitely not rushed or smothering, from the stand up front to the servers. It gets quite loud, so probably not ideal for conversation among a larger group.

First off, you'd think that for a Thursday night that it would have been packed in that tiny little bar, but there were still a couple of empty tables upstairs. We got two drinks: Tiny's Dark and Stormy ($16) & Tiny's Toddy ($16). They were both very carefully and beautifully made! I couldn't believe the amount of delicious fresh ginger in our Dark and Stormy and couldn't be more pleased! It was very good. Tiny's Toddy was warm and perfect for the snowy weather and the little cloves placed in each of the diamonds of the lemon was the nicest touch!

2.0,2/27/2018,"We have been going here for a couple of years, and lately brunch has been a disappointment. Not from a food standpoint, but from a service and atmosphere standpoint. We love the biscuits and the superfood pancake. But we had reservations, the place was half empty, yet the hostess tried seating us right next to another table with people...when there were empty tables just next to the area. We had to request to have a different table. And space is tight in that place, so it's understandable to want some breathing room if possible, and given we had reservations. Then the hostess tried to take away food that we were still working on, with out asking. As for the atmosphere, it's out of the restaurant's control, but I wish that people would stop bringing their young children to a bar for brunch. Twice we have encountered loud toddlers, and I just feel that if parents want to bring their kids to brunch, then do everyone a favor, and bring them to a kid appropriate establishment.

The staff here is nice and attentive. However, we waited a VERY long time for our two dishes: the loaded egg sandwich and the eggs Benedict.  How long does it take to make a sandwich?  It was packed when we arrived but by the time we ordered half the second floor cleared out already. We waited at least 35 minutes for our dishes... I also did not like sitting next to the cashier where it happen to be the dirty dishes area so they would bang the dishes a lot and it was incredibly loud. The food itself was okay. I liked the loaded egg sandwich with arugula pesto, cheese, eggs, tomato and avocado but it could use a little more flavor. The eggs benedict was your typical brunch dish except that the poached egg was boiled and not poached at all.

4.0,2/7/2018,"Tiny's is one of my favorite spots in Tribeca. We go here often during lunch since it's fairly quick and less packed than after work. You'll immediately notice the cute, pink building that Tiny's in (check their website for a preview). The ambiance here is great. I always prefer to be seated upstairs by the window since the lighting is better, but downstairs in the back is also romantic in the evenings. Note though, that if you are seated upstairs in the winter, it's very cold. The heat and circulation could be worked on at Tiny's, but don't let it deter you from the food. In terms of the food, I've tried almost the entire lunch menu. Definitely start with the meatballs - it's by far my favorite appetizer.  You can't go wrong with the burrata or the chili, but don't forget the meatballs. They're paired with some grilled bread (incredible) and topped off with a little cheese. It's the perfect appetizer. Entrees - the superfood pancake is one of the most popular. I personally am not a huge fan, but instead veer towards ordering the burger, chicken paillard club, steak salad, or pork sandwich. The best entree is the quinoa crisp, which has chorizo and chili aioli.

The duck was good, but the quinoa that accompanied it was completely tasteless. Three different glasses of wine were entirely bland, without character or flavor.

The bathroom was also broken, so we had to leave the restaurant and go to another restaurant to use the restroom. They ran out of clean mugs, so they gave us paper cups to drink our French press. To make up for it, they said the coffee was complimentary. That was very generous of them. However, we didn't realize that it was complimentary only for the first French press. So we ended up having to pay for our second one. The food, however, was fantastic. We ordered the burrata and kale salad to start. Entrees ordered were superfood pancake, eggs Benedict with smoked salmon, and huevos rancheros. Burrata was a staple. The burrata came on top of a thin layer of arugula salad topped with figs and balsamic type of sauce. It was a very pleasant combinations. Kale salad was good, but I think my friend hyped it up too much. Also I'm biased since I'm not usually a fan of kale. The superfood pancake was literally AMAZING. I am still thinking about it. I was afraid it would taste gross since it's made out of greens instead of fluffy flour, but it was surprisingly delicious! I can't wait to go back just for this dish. The eggs Benedict, a very safe choice, was also very good and a little unique from other basic places. I would also recommend this as a safe option.  Huevos rancheros weren't my favorite. I thought it was like any Mexican style breakfast dish you can get anywhere and didn't seem special. Overall, I was disappointed at the service, but the food was very good so I will probably return.

There was even a real fireplace, perfect cozy atmosphere. We came here for a friends birthday and here's what we got. We ordered the kale salad and the burrata to share. For entrees, me and one friend got the New York Benedict, while my other two friends got the superfood pancake and the hangover rancheros. Let's start with the appetizers. The kale salad I must say was the best kale salad I've ever had. There was a lot of ingredients in there, apples, celery, carrots, parm, etc but it all taste so good together. Huge portion too, perfect for sharing. The highlight of the brunch (which my friends also agreed) was the burrata. If you're a cheese lover, please don't skip out on this. For entrees, I really enjoyed my Benedict. It was with smoked salmon and the sauce they paired it with really brings out all the mouth watering flavors. The poached eggs was still runny and perfect. Next time if I were to come back though, I want to get the superfood pancake which my friend got. I took a bite of her dish and it was amazing. Taste healthy but yet so much flavor in every bite. Might not be a pretty instagramable dish but you're not gonna regret eating it. For dessert/cake, we got the donuts and they waitress put a candle on it for my friends birthday which was very nice. But the donuts I must say are terrible! Don't know whether it came from a box or just a few days old, it does not taste fresh and not really worth $9 at all. Overall food was amazing here, my girls all loved it. But service here is quite slow, have to ask for everything. Literally everything. They would bring out coffee pot but no cups. They would bring out the desert but no plates or utensils. Ask for a lid, never came back. Service can definitely be improved here.",2,2,1,Meiki W.,"New York, NY",283,139,266

5.0,1/5/2018,"Tiny's left a BIG impression on me. Ok, now that you're laughing, you understand the warm feeling that I felt when I was at Tiny's, more specifically, in the ""upstairs"". My sister had been talking about this spot ever since she moved into the city and finally, one day I met her there for brunch. One of my favorite things about Tiny's is the atmosphere. The tables are close without being crowded and the fireplace makes the space very homey and inviting. The food was very good. I ordered the burger which is completely unlike me as I typically lean more towards the ""Br"" part of ""Brunch"" but I am happy that I did. The burger was wonderfully cooked and had great flavor. The potatoes it was served with were fried to perfection with the perfect amount of crunch.We ordered a french press for the table and the coffee was good. What? a french press? I thought they only served espresso based drinks!? That's what we (mostly my sister) thought too! Make sure to be specific in your order because if you ask for ""coffee"" you are likely to receive an Americano.I will definitely be back in the future.

4.0,12/18/2017,"Great place for a cozy brunch!My friend made a reservation for the 4 of us through opentable, super simple, and we were lucky enough to snag a corner table right next to the cracklin' fireplace! It gets quite busy on the weekends during brunch time, so I would highly suggest making a reso. Cute little place, but it's pretty dark in there, kinda wish there was more lighting/natural light.Service wasn't the greatest when we were there (a bit slow and he didn't hear some of our orders), but we weren't really in a rush so I didn't mind it as much. Prices aren't the cheapest, but hey, it's NYC! Everything on their menu looks really good and healthy, so I would say any choice is a safe choice. I ended up going with the below:SUPERFOOD PANCAKE (Broccoli, Kale, Ginger, Arugula, Sunflower Seeds, Poached Eggs) $17Doesn't have the best sounding name, but it's actually a super great tasting dish. It's not a sweet/savory dish but just some sort of flour batter with all the veggies mixed in with two glorious, super well-made poached eggs on top. There is also a super generous arugula salad on the side that covers most of the pancake, so beware, there is actually a very large portion under there haha I almost had a hard time finishing it! I would say this is a super healthy and balanced meal (can't even tell it has that many veggies inside if you're the type that hates veggies), great option for brunch.TATER TOTS $9I saw people rave about these in reviews and wanted to try them...not sure I would repeat order these. They are really fluffly on the inside and slightly bigger than regular tater tots, but i didn't think it was crispy enough on the outside!My friends ordered the egg bowl and hangover rancheros, both looked pretty good though portion looked a bit smaller.I should probably head on over and try their food/drinks out at night sometime!",1,0,1,Patricia C.,"Manhattan, NY",135,275,1463

Food arrived, 3 of us ordered the waffles, 2 of us did not have bananas on them (it is listed as waffles with bananas, so not something to be overlooked). My adult son ordered $9 tater tots. They were cold I was able to summon our server after a while, they did provide bananas and a new order of tots. They were much better warm.

It was yummy but left us full so we only ordered a starter salad next. The beet salad wasnt that good. Nothing special about it.

When you first walk in, it seems a bit small and pokey, but towards the back of the restaurant there's a more open room, complete with fireplace. Upstairs there's an incredibly cool bar with more restaurant seating! As I say, this place is very rustic, dimly lit and a little rough around the edges in places - but it's meant to be like that! The atmosphere was great and had a very intimate vibe - would be a great spot for a date!Foodwise, we shared the Burrata, Mussels and Meatballs for appetizers between 4. These were all delicious in their own right and the portion sizes were pretty big. My favorite had to be the Mussels, they came in a saffron broth that was unlike anything I'd ever had before. Seriously tasty stuff.For mains I had the pepper crusted steak. Not too much to mess up or get right - it was a decent steak, but nothing I'd shout about. My dining compadres got the Hudson Duck, which looked delicious, although I didn't taste it.Drinks wise, this place has an eclectic mix of cocktails.

Our server was attentive and was well accommodating considering we were 10 girls who all want different things. We had a  Pre-fixed Brunch Menu where we had a few dishes we shared at the table. For the actual main dish we were able to choose from a few options. I ordered The Egg Bowl. It had whole grains, vegetables, yogurt, and a poached egg on top. It really was heavenly and the best salad I had eaten in a long time. As shared dishes at the table we had: homemade scones with jams and butter, a gigantic fruit bowl, and a yogurt parfait which had lemon curd and homemade granola on top.

No one came to check on us, to refill the water, to take another drink order, to clear our plates, offer dessert, or bring the check.  After sitting around for a while I finally went to the bar and asked the bartender if he could get someone to get us our check. We ended up going for dessert elsewhere. The meal and drinks were good, but the service was pretty abysmal - at that price point or any other.

Good thing it wasn't too packed for Sunday brunch because the tables are quite close to each other.  The food was a bit on the expensive side and their menu is very weak with descriptions. I didn't know that they were giving me a side for the main. And then I ordered another side and it was way too much of the exact same food... that I did not really like. I usually only drink fresh squeezed OJ however I couldn't tell if it was or not. Loaded Egg Sandwich ($15)- 4/5 This was yummy. The bread was a little hard to cut and was messy when I tried to just pick it up and eat it. I was a fan of all the ingredients in this! However this comes with a side was tater tots, which I did not know and did not like. Dulce De Leche Waffles ($15)- 4/5 This was quite loaded with fruits- berries and banana. Overall it was sweet because of the caramel and flambeed bananas. Probably a little too sweet for my liking especially in the morning (I'm more of a salty kinda person). Tater Tots ($8)- 2/5 I was so excited about seeing tater tots on the menu but it made me so sad that it was the exact same thing as the side I got on my main which I was unaware that I was even getting. These were way too mushy and not your typical tater tots. They're filled with cheddar & chives which sounds exciting but I prefer the real stuff.Orange Juice ($5)- For $5 I'm going to just assume it's fresh squeezed but I'm not too sure although but they did have a slice of orange to top it off. There's no ice but still pretty chill so I liked that. But it was so sweet and sour.",11,7,10,Jessica D.,"Brooklyn, NY",512,436,1192

Today though, was another story, three work friends and I were sitting in the corner when we heard who I assume is the manager (8/30 at around 2:30pm) speaking to a kitchen staff member through the 'kitchen window' so rudely and condescendingly we all just sat in silence trying to decide if we should interject. We didn't knowing that someone who speaks this way to others would surely only make things worse for the victim later on. I think the manager must not have known we were there, but that's not really the point. Communication like that is completely reprehensible and certainly not constructive for any team.

All of which the kitchen prepared to our liking, and the cadence to which the food was brought out nicely followed the flow of our dinner. They even delivered complimentary desserts to celebrate the holiday such as a homemade kit kat, baked Alaska, and a strawberry shortcake--they vanished within seconds! Also none of the food felt particularly heavy, which always indicates fresh cooking and quality ingredients.  The vintage yet repurposed ambiance made for a unique escape from the modern downtown.

I was told 8 people and over have to email for a ""large group reservation"". We came for Saturday brunch at 12:30pm. Our table wasn't ready when we got there so we ended up waiting about 15 min at the bar upstairs. We were able to order coffees while waiting. We were also able to get seated without our entire party arriving as a couple joined much later just for a drink. Our waiter was friendly and quick. The menu is great and has lots of yummy options that have plenty of healthy spins. I got one of the less healthy options- the breakfast sandwich with eggs, avocado, pesto, and tomato. So yummy!! Large portion ($16) and comes with crispy cubed tater tots. My friends ordered the quinoa crisp and the superfood pancake which were also tasty. They ran out of soy milk, and later they also ran out of skim milk. Only had whole milk, which would be my major critique. It was 12:30- too soon to run out of basic milk options to go with our coffee! Additionally, they serve stump town cold brew which is super tasty but $6 each. No free refills so I ended up spending $12 on two glasses of iced coffee...Overall very cute, yummy, decently priced (besides the coffee), and good service.

There was just one bartender working and although he was fast and proficient, it could take awhile to get a drink (particularly because they have a great mixed drink menu).I started with the Dark and Stormy which has rum and ginger beer.  It was really good.  For food I ordered the meatballs and brussel sprouts.  The meatballs were really good.  They came with a side of toasted bread which was a nice complement.  The melted mozzarella  cheese on top really helped make the dish.  The brussel sprouts were also really good, with a generous amount of bacon.I finished with a ten year old port that was good.  Overall, Tiny's is a nice, small place with tasty food.",1,0,1,Edward S.,"Seattle, WA",66,560,725

In typical NYC style, tight quarters when it comes to seating.  But it was nice to get to know our neighbors a bit.  The atmosphere is charming, and the details are spot on.  We came for brunch on a Sunday around 1:30p.  Lucky for us, we were given a table within 10 minutes of arriving even on a pretty crowded day. If you're on a diet, I wouldn't recommend stopping by only to be tempted by their hearty, no consideration for carbs dishes.  While the kale salad came highly recommended, we indulged in the Rise & Shine and Loaded Egg Sandwich, with virgin Basil Lemonades. The egg sandwich was all mine, and came with a side of delicious hash browns - though not marked on the menu.  The hash browns were a more gourmet spin on the original - included chives and lots of potato.  The sandwich was a solid good - the bread was a bit too oily and buttery, and there wasn't a great deal of flavor.  I ordered it because it had all of my favorite things - scrambled eggs, cheddar, pesto and AVOCADO.  The cheddar definitely made this sandwich. I stole part of the boyfriend's biscuit, and applied the most delicious sweet butter.  Also stole some grits and phenomenal bacon. All in all a great experience.  Will definitely return for cocktails.",1,0,1,Collette S.,"Boston, MA",216,258,169

Downstairs seems to be the way to go if you don't love shouting over music and the roar of 100 people. Upstairs was reminiscent of an attic that someone decided to convert into a bar. Drinks weren't anything to write home about - I had a fancified margarita that had WAY too much table salt on the rim (think it's called Servando's Big Day Out) and then a vodka soda pineapple.Would maybe try downstairs next time, but I'm not rushing to come back any time soon.",0,0,0,Yuting Z.,"Manhattan, NY",435,332,543

This is one of the coziest bars/restaurants I've ever been to- with its wood-burning fireplace, small rooms, rustic decor and mood lighting- it's like your in a cozy old house. I had the duck hunters brunch- a beet and duck hash with an egg and horseradish gremolata. I felt the beet flavor was overpowering and there was nothing strong to counteract it, and it felt a little too healthy for what I was looking for. I also had a side of tater tots- these were wonderful. Very soft and on the inside, flavorful and had a nice tangy/savory/sweet sauce on the side.

That said, I thought they were delicious.We sat at the bar upstairs; it's SMALL. We got there before the happy hour rush, though, so snagged two seats at the bar. Bartender Zach was awesome. We immediately ordered a bottle of prosecco. After we killed that, I ordered the Servando's Big Night Out from the cocktail menu. It was similar to a margarita, but way better.From the food menu, we started with the burrata. It was incredible--gooey cheese on top of proscuitto served with a rosemary pear sauce and crostini. Seriously, some of the best burrata I've had in a while. My friend ordered the hanger steak, which was excellent. I ordered the scallops, which were cooked perfectly and complemented uniquely with blackberries and shallots. I also ordered a side of brussels sprouts. Hard to go wrong with those, and they did not fail me!Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is simply because it's really expensive. Our bill ended up being close to $200.

2.0,11/19/2016,"Tiny's applies to the size of the restaurant as well as the size of the portions here. The portions are considerably small compared to the prices, which are pretty high, even for Tribeca. Considering that it's not a ""fancy"" restaurant or an especially nice setting, I think the fact that the entrees are around $30 a bit reaching. Outside of the portions being small, the food was pretty underwhelming. Most things we tried - including pasta, seafood and poultry were on the bland side. Nothing wowed. I was also excited about trying the cocktails here, given they have such a fun cocktail menu, but they were also only okay. Cannot compare to the quality at an actual cocktail bar. As the name suggests, the place is quite small. Not uncomfortable, but a tight fit. I think it's a better atmosphere for dates since it's definitely intimate. Didn't work as well for a family dinner.

When the scallop dish came, it was a huger portion than I expected and not much of a salad, but how would I know? I ate it anyway. After eating, I realized I did not need the appetizer since my scallop dish was so big. When the bill came, i realized the only dish that says ""scallop"" was charged twice the amount on the menu ($36). I asked the waitress and she said that since every else had entrees, she figured I'd get it too since the scallop salad was really small. I know what I pointed out, said clearly, and ordered. That was horrible for her to assume that I wanted a dinner option? She doesn't know what I was feeling then, I'd never think I'd have to put in a order and let them know how I was feeling as well. As a matter of fact, the scallop dinner option was NOT even on the menu. She did not even consult with me that she put in a dinner option when I wanted the salad. Now it made sense why the portion was bigger than I expected and then I'd also have to pay extra for a potato side I didn't even finish.

Effectively stealing from customers. Mind you this was at 4pm in the afternoon, after two drinks each, not a wild Saturday night...so I'm not sure how he thought we wouldn't notice.

The place was small (look at the name!) but it was comfortable and ""cozy"".  What's good:The burger and egg sandwich. All the flavors for the burger worked together really well and it tasted good. The beef was cooked to perfect medium rare, almost like it was seared. Would definitely order again. The egg sandwich was serviced with good portions of fresh avocado and well buttered multi grain bread! Skip: Basil Lemonade. It was from a can and not fresh. We came around 2pm on a Sunday, made reservations for 4 but there was no wait and plenty of seats.

We were seated by a hostess who was obviously miserable and it went downhill from there. We were never served, not even noticed. While we were waiting to receive a greeting we got to overhear a waiter reprimanded for wearing a towel- do not discipline your waiters in front of guests... Instead... Serve them.

3.0,8/3/2016,"So, here's the deal with Tiny's: brunch sucks. The only good brunch option is the pancakes. Dinner is far more solid, but you'll want to stick to the basics -- kale salad and the meatballs. And if they have burrata it's usually pretty solid. Their wine selection and cocktails are good but the kicker of the whole place is the gd PRICING. I am more than down for a bougey, expensive night out. But Tiny's is WILDLY overpriced for what it is. Also it's really loud so try to go at off times. And I've been told there's hot pro hockey players that hang there -- however, have yet to have seen one.",0,0,0,Izzy L.,"New York, NY",0,3,0
2.0,8/3/2016,"I got the kale pancake for lunch. It came with poached eggs, which I asked for on the side. I was envisioning the pancake to be a real breakfast/brunch-y pancake but it was not to be. It was more like an Asian style pancake with mostly veggies and not as much batter. It was good but it just wasn't what I was expecting and I wish the menu described the dish better or that the server had. The two stars primarily comes from that it seemed super pricey for what it was. It was $16 without tax or tip, which for a relatively light dish, is rather expensive. My friend got the burger which was apparently really good. But then again, he seems to be a regular so no surprises there.",0,0,1,Mindy J.,"Jersey City, NJ",33,189,9

I couldn't really pick from the brunch list, so i got a stone cut oak bark ($10) from the starter section, it was basically yogurt, granola, dried fruits and dates, and honey. I like it, it was above averageMy friend got the buttermilk pancakes ($14) it smells so GOODDDD, the smell almost last for the entire meal lol  the blueberry jam on top of the pancake was phenomenal.

It had about 4 stools. It wasn't too busy yet because it was only 5:45 but felt a little snug at the tiny bar. We just ordered drinks and both had the Rose - which was really good! The bartender also came and topped off our glasses with the end of the bottle - a gesture I appreciate!It's getting 4 instead of 5 stars because the employees kept coming to the bar, going between my friend and I to pass back and forth things.

It was for a corporate sponsored meeting in the cozy room all the way upstairs, with Zach bartending. I appreciated his recommendations -- I substituted Gin in the ""West 12th"" cocktail & it was well worth it. Good job, Zach!! Dinner was a well rounded fresh appetizer sampler (kale salad, burrata, beet salad) &  our choice of entree: I picked the butternut squash ravioli. After dinner, my anxiousness took over & we headed out JUST AS we realized dessert was being served. MAJOR FOMO   -- we stopped Mike, a server?, in the stairwell (only his second day there, #GodBless) & tried to convince him to bring down some dessert for us. He was a bit of a skeptic, being his second day on the job && all, so we won't be too harsh on him, but he introduced us to Frank -(cutie Frank with the stylish glasses), who was SO accommodating & TOTALLY understood that we were in dessert purgatory. Frank brought us over to Kyle, another bartender who was just as nice && we went from dessert purgatory to the ninth circle of dessert hell. We sampled 3 satisfying desserts -- the flan, the chocolate Kit Kat, and the bread pudding. Zomg.

We started at 8pm with cocktails, did a seated dinner around 9 and then finished with cocktails again. All in, we had the room for ~4-5 hours. The event was exceptional on every level:1. Everything was prepared well when my guests got there (before I did of course since I was bringing my wife a bit later). The room was beautifully arranged with two long wood tables replete with candles for a perfect cozy/winter vibe. Frank and Maya did a great job.2. The room was staffed with a bartender and a server so we were always well taken care of. Drink service was as you'd expect at a creative NYC cocktail bar, as opposed to at a restaurant with a liquor license.3. Menus were printed in advance. Apps were family style (wow, the meatballs!) and dinner was a choice of steak, chicken, salmon or ravioli. Tiny's served up choices off their main menu, so you know what you're getting is what they serve their walk-in guests as opposed to a dumbed-down version of the menu with cheaper preparation. Dessert was family-style.4. Even though we only had the room till 12, they let us stay till 1.I researched a bunch of venues for this event (il Buco, Tribeca Grill, Momofuku, Palma, Lure, Bacaro, Bar Bolud, Lafayette, Maysville, Market Table, Barbuto, Bar Bolonat, Quality Meats, ABC Kitchen, etc. etc.). I'm sure all would have been great. But for 15-25 people, you simply can't beat Tiny's 3rd floor. The ambiance, price service and quality were all top notch.

Why, you might ask?  I think it's because it's pretty hidden, almost like a speakeasy. The signage is pretty small, and if you don't know where you're going, you could easily walk right past it.The interior is warm, cozy, and friendly with down-to-earth staff.  These are people I could see at my place for a game night, having a great time!My Harvest Bowl was a healthy mix of seeds, arugula, farro, cabbage, beets, and a citrus dressing. Though it was on the Starter menu, it was sizable enough for breakfast, and I couldn't even finish it.I also especially liked their coffee.

4.0,11/12/2015,"Located in the Tribeca area on the westside, Tiny's is just that, Tiny but it packs a pretty solid punch.  If you are looking to make reservations here, you can only do it 30 days in advance.  Since the place is dimly lit and small, as soon as you walk in you get a sort of cozy feel, which to me was a little 'odd' since the place has brick backdrop with shiny metallic objects scattered throughout.We were seated in the upstairs portion of the restaurant where the bar is located.  The bar seemed to fill up quickly around 8ish. There are about 10-12 tables upstairs in a tight space.  If you want to have a really personal conversation, this is probably not the place for you as the table next to you is within inches of you.  There was no one sitting next to us during dinner, but it did seem loud at times.  I did not mind the level of noise as it was not overly disruptive.  Dinner was really good.  We ordered the duck and the scallops as entrees, along with oysters on the half shell and meatballs for appetizers.  The duck was cooked extremely well and the scallops were too.  Decent size portions that left me full upon leaving.  They have a decent wine list by the bottle and by the glass.  Prices were not overly outrageous.  Wines vary by style, varietal and region of the world.  They covered all the basics and had some interesting eclectic wines.  I liked the variety and prices on this wine list.The service was fast, efficient, friendly and knowledgable.  No complaints whatsoever.So many choices in NYC for eating that I want to try, but would never turn down a chance to come back here.  I would even enjoy hanging out in the small bar area upstairs.  If you are in Tribeca, give it a shot.",3,0,4,Steven M.,"Mars, PA",90,254,754

We had reservations at 8.15 and were promptly seated. The space is ""cozy"" so the name is apropos, but the ambience is warm and inviting.  We happened to strike up a conversation with Paul,  who was in a fantastic costume and came to realize he was the executive chef. I appreciated him taking the time to speak with us. Food: we shared the kale salad, (which was a huge portion), and really tasty. I had the meatballs and the charred broccoli. The meatballs were moist, flavorful and perfectly cooked. Broccoli was equally delicious. My friend had the salmon entree which she also enjoyed. Service was excellent throughout. Paul very nicely comped our salad, which was an unexpected but very welcome surprise. I think we bonded over our costumes  ;-) Thanks Paul! Then the salad took a while to arrive due to a mix up in the kitchen, so Paul then very generously offered us a complimentary glass of wine.

3.0,10/3/2015,"Four stars for atmosphere, three stars for food. We had happy hour drinks and dined at Tiny's on a Friday evening. Service started out nice, but I think she became annoyed by our group throughout the evening, don't know why. Do make a reservation, we did and were promptly seated.Decor is rustic, dark, and a mix of shiny metallics against a brick background. The dining space downstairs is a bit more cramped than I would've liked and has only a few tables. And if the annoying couple at the table next to you is making out, well, then you're forced to watch it or stare at the ceiling. The artichoke hearts in my dish were tough and inedible, the fish was good but really bland, it could've used some salt, seasoning or sauce to add flavor. The meatball appetizer was my favorite. The burrata app was ok, the kale salad was good. The farmer's tan cocktail was watered down and not good. The bottle of pinot noir we ordered was just ok, not worth the $60+ we paid for it. Tiny's makes a good effort for food, but falls just a tiny bit short (sorry, had to pun). If you're not terribly hungry or don't expect amazing food, then I'd say give Tiny's a try for a drink with friends or a date.

5.0,8/30/2015,"Sunday brunch here... is a fantastic idea! Words of wisdom - make reservations and get there early for outdoor seating. I had the Rise and Shine. And I highly recommend it.  Eggs over easy, savory grits with purple corn specks, thick bacon, and a biscuit. Would have it everyday! The biscuit was crumbly, not your average super fatty, moist biscuit but honestly delicious. The eggs and thick bacon were perfectly done. Grits that were gorgeously colored and equally complimented by their texture. Homemade hot sauce on the side. Sooooo satisfying! Note, it was not belt unbuckling, but a perfect portion. For those who are used to a huge huge American breakfast, where you stuff yourself silly, you may be left wanting more. I wanted more - but more like brunching on it again the next day kind of more! My friend got the Root and Grains: quinoa and sunchokes and poached eggs. Healthy, right! It was delicious if you want a filling salad.  In addition to the long list of alcoholic drinks, they have coffee, of course. We got ice coffee, what you'd expect. What was tempting was the french press coffee. $5 with one, $10 for two. Maybe I'll try it next time. The waitress was peppy, plenty of happy to erase any particularly trying, early morning.

We ordered everything to share - Burrata, meatballs, papperdelle, tater tots, and vanilla flan. Everything was mediocre, in my opinion. The meatballs were what I was looking forward to, but it was kind of disappointing. It lacked flavor and was a bit dry. The Burrata was only OK as well - I've had better.

But what was worse was our waitress. She was more interested in acting like ""besties"" with us than actually doing her job- which is to check on everyone once they've been served and make sure everyone is happy. My entree (I think it was shrimp) was bland and terrible. I didn't eat ANY of it. Worse still was that the birthday girl hated hers too- she got the farro ""risotto""- it was tough and flavorless. But sadly our waitress was so inattentive she had no clue and couldn't be pinned down for help.After we'd had our food for a good 15-20 minutes, the waitress saddled up the b-day girl's husband who was sitting on the outer edge of our table. She chatted with him about HIS entree only. He got the chicken which came with lots of nice veggies and was pretty good. Eventually the busser came to clear and I had to tell him to tell our waitress to take my entree off of the bill. (He had obviously not been trained to notice when a customer's plate has been essentially untouched). Then, when the waitress came over (though not immediately- and not to see if there had been a problem, mind you) she said to me-almost as if in passing-that she had ""heard"" I didn't like my entree and that I should have told her when she came to check on us!! My thoughts, ""Well, actually you came to our table after we'd had our food for about 15 minutes and spoke only to my friend's husband. You never checked up on us at all."" Grrrrrrr.

I'm a fan of ambiance as much as the next gal, but this was overkill.One bathroom! You'll be waiting if this place is at all busy.This place is TINY, but so charming.

5.0,4/6/2015,"5 stars for their brunch! I've been to their brunch about 4 times now and I have never been disappointed. Reservations are easy to make and when we walked in without a reservation once, we were still able to be seated right away around 11am. I went back yesterday for my usual brunch order but the menu had changed, so I guess the menu is either seasonal or it gets updated frequently. I had the baked french toast which was delicious (a tad too heavy on the sweet side for the first meal of the day, but if you're craving something sweet, it will definitely hit the spot). My boyfriend had the biscuits and gravy, which was surprisingly delicious and addictive considering it's not a traditional southern comfort food restaurant. I love that they serve coffee in individual french press, although it is slightly pricey (I think $5 for a 2-cup individual press). The ambiance is great - very rustic and intimate setting in the back. Perfect for a date or small groups. I would definitely come back here for any occasion. Service was quick and waiters were very pleasant. But that could also be due to the fact that there are usually only 1-3 other tables occupied when we go at around 11am. The place seems to start filling up quickly around 12pm. Lastly, I have to mention their potatoes. Seriously. I know it sounds silly but whoever is cooking up the potatoes in the back for brunch deserves a special compliment. They used to have ""crispy potatoes"" which was basically the perfect hash, but it looks like it has been replaced by ""tater tots"" which were probably one of the BEST tater tots I've ever had. We got it on the side and I ended up reaching for that more than my french toast.",0,0,0,Christine J.,"New York, NY",0,16,0

We sat upstairs and it was perfectService: 3/5 - coffees went missing, orders had to be pushed when we could find our waitressFood: 4/5 - we had the brunch prix fixe option and everything was deliciousPastry board: delicious scones and breads with an apple spreadStone cut oat bark: incredible balance of crunch, sweetness, yet light and fluffy, highly recommendedFruit bowl: meh. handful of overripe berries that belonged more to a pancake batter, over a bed of melons and pineappleBurger: on paper, it look like a wonderful idea, but the taste was OK, none of the flavors shined (aioli could have used more kick or something to brighten it, the pickles were very dull for examples). That said, the tater tots were amazingRoots & grains: yum! perfect balance with the sunchokes, red quinoa and egg, it was a feel good / taste good rainbow in a foggy morning. Cocktails: 5/5 - get the off menu bloody mary, with real horseradish, spicy. Comes with fun garnish (cheese, pickle, salami, olive).  The king henrik was also perfectly balanced (and fairly sizeable)Price: $49 for prix fixe brunch was steep (no drinks included), but it was a perfect space for a group and we had definitely too much food.

For me, the bloody mary was way too spicy, and for someone else the bloody mary was way too salty, so I can't say I got to enjoy the drinks as much as I had hoped. The food was good, but I would only go back for the grits. Being accustomed to southern grits, I love a well-made order of grits. They were not your usual grits because they had some sort of flavoring that just made it a million times better than I expected.

We ordered the kale salad, chicken liver pate and the stuffed pork chop. Each dish was decent but nothing spectacular. I was especially disappointed in the pork chop. Typically when you say ""stuffed"" there is generally an abundance of stuffing inside the pork. The little bit of stuffing that was there had little to no flavor and did nothing for the over cooked and way too thick pork chop.If it wouldn't have been for the great service and their always delicious bourbon ale, this would have been a pretty lousy experience.Stick to brunch and hanging out in the cozy bar upstairs.",0,0,0,Taryn M.,"Houston, TX",23,9,1

3.0,1/31/2015,"This place was recommended by my foodie friends so I was looking forward to it.  They rave about the kale salad so I ordered it as my main.  Kale with toasted walnuts, apples, carrots, shredded gouda with maple-mustard vinaigrette and it was delicious!  Probably one of the best kale salads I have tried.The reason why I only gave this 3 stars is because the service was not at par with the food quality.  My friend is a vegetarian so when she ordered her sides, she asked whether they were made with butter or olive oil --- and if they were made with butter, can the chef use olive oil instead.  Our orders came and the person who took our orders had not come back on my friend's query.  He was very busy with other tables that it was difficult to get his attention.  Then he came to us and just said the the sides are on their way.  So my friend did not have her food all at the same time.Then when we called his attention again to ask for the dessert menu, and they gave us the bill.  Did they want us out?  He did apologize though.For dessert, we ordered the chocolate mousse which was just ok. The place is really tiny and feels cramped.  We were seated upstairs by the corner and it was extremely cold.  Sure it was 5degrees outside but the place lacked heating.Since I loved the kale salad but was not so keen on the place, I went back the next day and ordered the salad to go.",0,0,0,MJ B.,"Hoboken, NJ",1,160,2

Tiny's of course was more pleasant than eternally wading knee-deep through snow-like material in the dark, to find at the end of the path one single small burning candle. Don't get me wrong there are other flames burning in Tribeca but Tiny's with its attentive and smiling service, elegant food and intimate dining experience, and everything-old-but-restored appeal had me eager to go back after a lunch that felt like dinner. And so, I couldn't wait to go back for lunch again and went back a third time for an impromptu dinner. I had the duck duo, maybe a special, with duck breast and confit. It was spectacularly tender, sweet and so much complex flavor. I would not hesitate to order the duck breast entree, when I go back again. Too bad the cocktails were just ok. I remember having a dark and stormy and a smoke and mirrors at the bar upstairs, and was slightly impressed by them, but my friend was not impressed at all by The West Twelfth or a diablo-like cocktail that our otherwise amazing server suggested.

The ambiance of the place is as awesome as the drinks... and we loved the cocktails. Seeing as it was our first time, we asked the server a few questions about the menu. We decided to split the Burrata - what a great choice! I wish we would've taken pictures - but we devoured it pretty quickly. We were undecided on our entrees, I ended up going with the pork chop and my girlfriend had the filet mignon and a side of broccoli.  Our waiter, Mike, did a great job explaining that the pork chop's serving was substantially larger than the filet. The porkchop has a delicious mustard sauce.My girlfriend considers herself a mini-expert on flan. This flan tasted a bit like creme brulee - once again, amazing... albeit tiny. The service was exceptional. Mike catered to all of our questions, was not pushy, and available when we needed him. He made our night on the town more exceptional.

Some people may say it's on the small side, I think it's cozy.  And folks, they called the place ""Tiny's"", you kinda lose the right to complain the size - they're being pretty straight forward.  I've been downstairs in the back (fireplace!) and upstairs past the bar - it's all good.  The building was built in the early 1800's and a lot of it has been kept original.  I thought at some point Lundqvist was a partial owner, not sure if that is still the case.Never had a bad meal here.  The menu has changed since I've last been here, but I see those scallops are still there (magical), as are the meatballs with garlic toast.  I don't recall if the lamb was a menu item at the time, or a special, but that too was pretty spectacular.  The wine list always does the trick, and they have a very cool cocktail list.  Even the beer selection is pretty epic.The service has always been spot on for us, whether busy or on the lighter side.  We even received great service when we didn't even eat here.  We made a lunch reservation for four, but we were limited to about just over an hour.  The table that had our name on it was wrapping up (or so we thought), so we hung out by the bar.  Unfortunately that table would not leave.  And I'm cool with that if you're having cocktails so the restaurants meter keeps running, but these three folks were drinking water.  And they kept getting refills.  Well we couldn't wait any longer so we had to split, but the waitress was so apologetic about it - wish I took her name down.  I don't know how people can sit there, drinking water, when people are waiting for tables.I'm going to make a reservation for 12/13/14, so I can enjoy a great meal and then I'll update this review.",0,0,0,John M.,"Wantagh, NY",1,257,5

Hints of bacon/pork, sweet apple type flavor, and it all went so nicely with the green beans and mushrooms. The actual meat was so tender and has many great textures in one bite! The skin had a bit of a crisp, the meat was a cross between duck, pork, and steak all in one (maybe it's just me but it tasted like that!) this isn't your average Chinatown duck on rice for sure, but be aware it's not that Chinatown duck price either!If you order the Duck Duo, get the bread for the table and dip your bread in the sauce, so many yums.If you're looking for a more quiet dining experience, maybe ask to be seated downstairs. The bar is upstairs so even though I thought downstairs would be loud from the street sounds, the bar was much louder.I would like to visit Tiny's sometime again in the future to try the hanger steak or starters, but it is on the expensive side of casual restaurants, I've had similar tastes and atmospheres at places just as good.Lastly, I loved the menu design!

The vegetables that came on the side were oily and grossly overcooked. I was just dying for a lemon wedge to squeeze over the whole dish and bring it to life.Basically same goes for scallops. The dishes needed salt and acid, and definitely less oil. Especially considering it's not that inexpensive... Nothing was downright bad but I would say it just needed a lot more flavor.Would probably go to Sushi of Gari across the street instead next time.",1,0,0,Jane P.,"Chelsea, Manhattan, NY",82,69,7

The hostess initially took us upstairs and was going to sit us next to four screaming children, but instead politely took us back downstairs to a much quieter area - awesome! Music was complementary to the experience as opposed to too loud to talk over. Very cute decor.The food was fantastic. We had the smoked salmon appetizer which is more of a spread but totally addicting. Mains were steak, scallops, and summer pasta - all fantastic and cooked perfectly. The tres leches cake was a little on the dry side but the flavor was still good. Spicy margarita was superb as well. Overall I'd definitely recommend.",0,0,1,Sarah R.,"Brooklyn, NY",17,18,0

2.0,6/1/2014,"Came for dinner this Saturday night. Great atmosphere. The problem was the service which was terrible. We got seated in a very dark area, which we generally dont mind, but we had to use our mobiles to make out the menu. After this test, we ordered the Hanger Steak, only to find out that they were out of steaks... We went for the lamb instead and received two small, over-priced chops of lamb, that was in a state of barely being warm. Warmth seems to be a problem, since after tasting the red wine, which was served too chilly, the reply was they could heat it up for us???? The final drop was when we asked to tune down the music a little, cause we where a bit alienated since we could barely see what we where eating, not hear what we where speaking and drinking cold red wine to try to overcome this Saturday night situation, the tab was presented without a single comment....

It's okay, they made it up with the service. Also, the wooden menus were super adorbs!KALE SALAD--HUGE bowl of salad. You can probably SHARE it among 3-4 ppl as a LIGHT appetizer like we did. The CHOICE and FRESHNESS of the INGREDIENTS really MADE THIS DISH. You can taste it in every bite. I wish we mixed it in the beginning because I would've wanted more gouda towards the end. EGGS BENEDICT--everything about their benedict was SUB-PAR for me. They TRIED but they DIDN'T TRY HARD ENOUGH. The braised HAM LACKED FLAVOR and was a bit DRY. The EGGS were TOO COOKED and not as runny as I would have liked them. The ham and eggs was like eating the bland with the bland. This is sad but I had to ""GARNISH"" with a bit of KETCHUP. OK, HOW SAD WAS THAT STATEMENT. The crispy POTATOES were indeed crispy and cooked perfectly but they lacked SALT. IS THERE NO SALT AT TINY'S? There was also a side of ARUGULA SALAD dressed with a very tart-almost lemony vinaigrette. Didn't care for that at all. BUTTERMILK PANCAKES--the pancakes were AWESOME! Semi-LIGHT and FLUFFY, I did my best to eat slow and savor each bite. I definitely was NOT A FAN of the GUAVA CREAM CHEESE FRITTERS, though.

For the scrambled eggs, It says it comes with ham but it's really shredded pork that was flavorful and tender; a really great dish. We ended up splitting the pancakes for dessert and they were phenomenal. The cream on top was so rich there was no need for syrup.

4.0,4/22/2014,"Tiny's is a restaurant with an interesting story--and that's half the battle.  The other half is the actual experience itself.  The ambiance of the space/furniture itself is great at night.  You get a mixture of candlelit coziness, grit from the age of the venue and the antiques that fill it, and casualness brought to light by a young, hip staff.  The service was pretty excellent.  I was over an hour late to my reservation due to the Tribeca Film Festival, and they still allowed us to walk in and sit down for an hour and a half in between two other parties.  Food and drinks held up, too.  We had a carafe of draft wine, which ended up being 700ml (maybe 750), which made the price actually sensible.  And it was perfectly chilled and delicious.  The duck pastrami and the hangar steak were standouts.  That blue cheese butter on the hangar was out of control.  And the potatoes that came with the steak reminded me of Las Ramblas' perfectly cooked papas rellenas.  Little crispy cubes of goodness.The scallops were probably the most underwhelming--and, consequently, overpriced--dish.  The scallops themselves were sparse (five lil guys in total).  One of them was unevenly seared.  And it came with nothing in the way of sides other than a strip of pork belly (which was perfectly charred) and a tiny bundle of Chinese broccoli rabe, which, for me, doesn't deserve to pull in $29 a plate. Overall, it was a great experience that yields another trip back, should I find myself in Tribeca looking for a similar evening.",0,0,0,Wes F.,"New York, NY",29,121,40

5.0,4/10/2014,"Tiny's is a place that I like to go to when I'm having a catch up dinner with a friend or three. To start with, the building itself is a quaint old colonial building with some serious 18th century cachet. The trade off is that space and seating are at a premium. So I wouldn't bring more than 4 people at a time; 2 people is ideal whether you're friends or on a date. The atmosphere is dark and inviting without being somber or claustrophobic.As for the food, I've never been disappointed here. The kale salad is a must-have every time I go and I strongly recommend the meatballs as well. The menu has a relatively limited selection but everything is top notch, whether it's the duck, the hangar steak, or the hake. Furthermore, the service is excellent, attentive and accommodating.Overall, I have no problems recommending Tiny's because, much like its neighbor down the street, Landmarc, it's a wonderful, reasonably priced, and cozy place that can quickly make its way into your short list of go-to dining spots.",0,0,0,Robert S.,"New York, NY",71,112,2

With its brick walls and fireplace, it really has a cozy ambiance that was just right for the night.Frank Sinatra was on in the background just a liiiitle too loud since my dad is in denial about his deafness ;)As for the eats: We got the kale salad to start. It was a kale salad. We also got really warm and soft bread and butter. Yums.For entree, I got the hake and my dad got the duck. The hake was really good. It is a white fish that is slightly denser than cod and it came in a nice sauce with brussel sprouts. My dad's duck was smoky and divine. Me likey.For dessert, we shared the chocolate mousse. Not my fav, but they only had three dessert options. I could definitely see us returning if they switch up their menu a bit for the spring.",0,1,1,Nikki A.,"New York, NY",267,500,31
4.0,4/7/2014,"Have been here a few times for lunch. The inside decor is pretty rustic and the outside looks like a small pink house juxtaposed in the New York City building layout.  Tiny's definitely has a homey ambiance, and it's definitely a comfortable place for a meal. Maybe not the best for large groups, but definitely good for dates and casual small groups.More recently, I tried their burger. The burger meat was actually cooked just right and delicious, but I don't think it was packed in enough to because the burger patty fell apart within the bun, which I found odd. The dry-aged beef didn't really make it more flavorful, and I still found it a little lacking. The pulled pork sandwich is delicious though, and probably more worth your time. The pork isn't too minced and still has a bit of texture, which most pulled pork sandwiches don't have. The Old Bay fries had a good flavor, but a bit too potato-y for my tastes. Again I like smaller, crispier fries, so take that criticism as you will. Service is very quick and attentive, and while the waiters aren't the most lively, they definitely get the job done. We were once able to get in and out of the restaurant in about 30 minutes. Blinding speed.My only qualm is the price. The prices aren't absolutely terrible, but for example, $18 for an average, small(er) burger and small portion of fries is a few dollars too many, in my opinion. But, given that the quality is good, it's definitely worth it if you can expense it (only saying that because we're in Tribeca. Heh.)I have yet to have a happy hour here, and I kinda want to see what ""The Bar Upstairs"" is all about. I'll have to put that on my to-do list for this year.

Last night we mixed it up and got the risotto which was delicious but left me wanting something else (although I think this of all risotto dishes that are served by themselves). We also got the special mussels which were described to be in a white wine sauce - although this was partially true the waiter did not mention that it also contained copious amounts of fennel.

We sat in the back by the fireplace, which was incredible. The back room is TINY, maybe room for 20 people max. The service was great. We started with the creamed corn chowder and the market salad and then moved on to the brisket and pork sandwiches. All 4 were incredible. Fresh tasting, full of flavor. For pork and brisket surprisingly not heavy, which is a nice touch when you have to return to a hot office! We finished up with a coffee and sat for a bit undisturbed.

However, I immediately forgot about my disappointment when I had a bite of their french toast. It's probably one of the best french toasts I've ever had. I don't usually eat sweets for breakfast, but the waiters description was too interesting to pass up. It's warm chocolate cinnamon swirls, toasted, topped with burrata cheese and a peach compote. It blew my mind. The kale salad was also good. They eggs benedict was interesting since it had pulled pork, but it wasn't as good as the other dishes. The biscuit was okay, but quite expensive for little mounds of buttered dough.

5.0,10/21/2013,"We live in Dallas and visited NYC for the Food Network weekend food and wine event.  So suffice it to say that we were sampling recipes from some of the most talented and recognized chefs in the U.S. all weekend long  During our last night in town we asked the concierge to recommend a restaurant.  He told us emphatically that Tiny's shouldn't be missed and that we would love the restaurant.  So we headed down West Broadway from the Soho Grand and after a 15 minute or so walk arrived at our destination.  The outside of Tiny's is rustic.  You may not believe it's the restaurant we're talking about - suspend judgment and step inside, you won't be disappointed.  We were greeted by a serious, well mannered young man who took our names and showed us to a wonderfully cozy table in the corner by a small fireplace.  The decor is historic, well worn and interesting?  it is quite dark so if you think you need a small flashlight to read a menu bring one. We ordered the salmon terrine and Kale salad for starters. The salmon terrine was by far the best smoked salmon dish we've ever had in a restaurant.  The side of pickled onions, fresh dill and paper thin toasted bagel slices were exquisite.  We noticed that a nearby waiter described the terrine as something you would put on a bagel.  This is far from accurate so don't let a less than enthusiastic endorsement from the staff dissuade you from ordering this dish.  Do pile on the dill and pickled onions - the acidity and crunch are a perfect compliment to the silkiness and, depth of favors of the terrine.  The kale salad was quite large and is suitable for sharing.  Best kale salad in NYC of the weekend and we averaged two a day between Thursday and Saturday at a variety of restaurants.  We ordered the lamb shank, sirloin steak, braised red cabbage and a bottle of wine for dinner.  The waiter was very knowledgable and recommended a fantastic wine at a reasonable rate.  The steak and lamb were well seasoned and delicious but we have to say the stars of the meal were the vegetables. They were not just sides, but well thought out, well prepared accompaniments to the main courses.  Bravo chef!  We wish we had the recipe for the broccoli!  We were celebrating a birthday and ordered two desserts, the chocolate fudge and the strawberries in cream.  These desserts were the right size, small, and incredibly well prepared.  The strawberries were fresh and were infused with herbs.  The fudge cake came with a pistachio sauce that cut the sweetness of the cake nicely.  Thank you to the chef and our waiter.  It was a magical evening.",0,0,0,Laura C.,"Frisco, TX",0,9,3

The meatball appetizer was decent but the scallops dish and the veggie lasagna were flavorless. The menu was limited, kind of all over the place, and uninspired. The servers were nice enough but were dressed in jeans and sneakers which was kind of awkward and did not match the décor/atmosphere. They also marked up the glasses of wine way too much. They charged $12-14 per glass, for bottles that cost $7-8 (I know my wine). I understand all restaurants mark up wine, but this was above and beyond for cheap bottles.

Maybe that's by design, too, because it really didn't taste that good.  The atmosphere borders on annoying - cramped and dark with uncomfortable seating.  I have no idea how this place stays open.  We won't be back.",0,0,0,M B.,"Delray Beach, FL",0,7,0

5.0,5/16/2013,"Thanks Yelp for helping me find yet another lovely dining experience in Manhattan. Tiny's was everything I was looking for. Authentic charming and delicious. I'll say this place is true to its name and every little nook and cranny requires negotiation so...maybe not the best choice for backpackers ;)We had a corner seat adjacent to the front window which were fully open allowing us to enjoy an al fresco-esque experience which I think was the perfect balance as it was a lovely night. The service was prompt and attentive but certainly not rushed. We shared a beet salad which was creamier than I'd had in the past and less ""earthy"" but certainly delicious. Personally I like to really taste the beets but I am not complaining it was a lovely appetizer and I'd order it again. We also had a Burrata cheese appetizer that had a MAGNIFICENT date honey gaze and pistachos. WTF this thing was fantastic and in all honesty belonged on the dessert menu. Holy Shmoly was it good. If you visit Tiny's please do yourself the favor of enjoying this dish. We wound up splitting an entree - hanger steak. Yummy hearty and cooked to perfection. The side crunchy potatoes were a bit too heavy for my taste. Next time there I think I'll try the Hake and keep it lighter. Between the creaminess of the  beet salad, the burrata, and the richness of the entree I'd say the menu is a bit heavier but again no complaining this was a lovely dinner. Perfectly romantic and charming for a date. Has a very local feeling to it which is hard to find and goes so far in Manhattan.

To make matters worse we were seated upstairs next to a large party of 20-something women celebrating a birthday or something and they were really loud and disruptive, constantly toasting and shouting.  The service staff did little to discourage them even though other patrons' dinners  were visibly disrupted by them. The food was pretty good although the menu was rather limited. I wasn't impressed with the wine menu, but they seem to be more concerned with specialty cocktails. The poor bartender was so overwhelmed with mixing concoctions for the dining room and bar that it took me nearly 15 mins to get a glass of wine at the bar while waiting to be seated. Bottom line: they should expand the menu because they seem to have a chef that can cook, revisit the wine list and take out some tables to make a little room.  Also, staff should try to keep the decibel levels down and they just might bring in more than 20-something's looking to get plastered after work.",0,0,0,Rose C.,"Manhattan, NY",9,2,0

2.0,12/6/2012,"This may have been an off day, or perhaps we arrived at the wrong time (no for sure we did), but the experience was very weird.  We asked for a table for two and the hostess handed us menus, but did not tell us to follow her or where to sit.  Then as we waited by the door, she rudely and brusquely asked us if we wanted to sit down.  (Of course we did, but we didn't think we should seat ourselves!).  She kept looking at us like we were idiots.   Then when I asked for a wine list, she gave me the folder with the drinks, but the wine list happened not to be in it.  It was missing from mine: I didn't know that it was missing -- how would I, so when I asked for the wine list again, she huffed and looked at me like I was an idiot again -- pointing to the thing in my hand and then walked away.  But it wasn't there?!  How odd.  She was somewhat contrite when I finally explained that it was missing, but why did I have to? If the food was really great, this rude treatment may have been worth experiencing.  Maybe?  But it wasn't.  The kale salad, despite the exuberant pitch, wasn't any better than any other kale salad.  What?  Because there are apples in it?  I didn't get it.  The califlower was doused in oilThe soup was excellent, for sure.  Take out worthy, maybe?  Too many good places in NY to bother.  I've had dinner here before, too.  It was better but not much.  Everyone wants this place to be good, the owners should try and make it so.",1,0,1,Thomas C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,11,0

The restaurant is no bigger than it appears from outside, but immediately upon entry, the creaking, old, wooden floors, dim candlelight, and wonderfully friendly staff embrace you with a warm, cozy vibe  There are dining tables on the first and second floors.  The bar is upstairs (that makes me smile), which is where we sat.  We ordered drinks and shared a plate of french fries, which were delicious, hot and perfectly crisp.  Obvious from the tables around us, Tiny's is quite popular among the locals.  The menu is small, but appropriate to the quaint atmosphere.  Tiny's was a wonderful, unexpected discovery, and we will return soon!",5,1,4,Jenna L.,"New York, NY",50,101,4

We were seated in the back of the downstairs at a lovely corner banquette table. Perfect for the 5 of us. Everyone ordered the beet salad, except me. Absolutely have the kale salad. It is a meal on to itself. And ever so tasty. 3 of 5 ordered the Hake, which was so delicious, but a bit small - although plenty of food (Americans are so into this UBer sized portions). Our pescatarian ordered the scallops, which wasn't truly only fish...they had some pulled pork thrown in. It was delicious, but not to someone who doesn't eat meat. I ordered the vegetarian ravioli.

2.0,10/10/2012,I will start by saying that this was our third attempt trying to eat at Tiny's. I will be upfront and say the 2-star rating was because of the service as most of the food was really amazing. Here are my issues with the service and how we were treated.When ordering wine the waiter had no idea about the wine menu and the bottles that weren't available on the menu.When the meatball advertiser was delivered to the table that plopped it down on top of someones place setting even though we were obviously sharing.We asked to use the table next to us since 3 of us were crammed in a small table. They muffled they weren't sure and never came back to say yes or no. No one ever sat next to us.The waiter hardly came over to make sure everything is ok.The expensive bottle of wine had a lot of sediment so we asked to be decanted. No decanter available and no real apology about the bottle. The steak was delivered cold and when we mentioned it was cold the bus boy argued that it just came out of the kitchen. He took it away and returned what seemed like 90-seconds later without apologizing or asking if it was better.As I said most of the food was really delicious but for the expensive food we expected a little more on the customer service side. We invited the manager over to discuss some of the above and to say he was remotely interested would be a stretch. I am sad to see a restaurant treat diners with such disrespect.,1,0,0,StJohn D.,"Brooklyn, NY",37,6,0

What do you really need to look into? Then it took another server about 10 minutes to even greet us. It's just one of those places where the servers (all models on the side) aren't there because they want to be. It kind of had that Brooklyn feel of ""we don't care, you're here"". Oh well.

4.0,8/30/2012,"Dim lighted, cozy and small place on the West Broadway in Tribeca. Since I really didn't want to go into any fancy atmosphere place or any crowded place, I thought this place was perfect.I had no idea how their food was going to be, but I got lucky.A friend and I started with fried oysters and Spinach and smoked ricotta dip. The 3 fried oysters were actually huge. I thought they just put a lot of flower on a tiny oyster, but I was wrong. The oyster itself was huge. I even had to cut the oyster to third to eat. They were tasty and rich. The dip was also very good. It was light, and went well with all the vegetables. Very healthy.We shared the main dish - Pork Chop. It is not mentioned on the menu, but it's spicy. The pork was thick, and moistured perfectly. The side veges: potatoes and mushrooms were sauteed pretty well.The dessert was the only downside. We had peach with ice cream. The peach was baked for some reasons. It was unnecessary.My only wish was if the service was better. I requested the 2nd floor first, but the music was so loud that I asked if we could go back to the 1st floor. The host was obviously annoyed by that. The 1st floor was much quieter and I liked it, but they eventually turned the music louder, which was too loud for dinner.It was also hard to get a waitress. She was not really friendly. When she came by to check the order, we ordered the appetizer first, and told here give us some minutes to decide the main, her answer was ""Oh, we take all the orders at one time."" Why don't you just say ""Sure, take your time. I'll come back.""? Dining is an experience to enjoy food, service, time, company and everything. This place can be so much better.

Then again struggling to get check or dessert menu. She walked by us several times not even looking or paying attention. Asking if we needed refills of drinks or something else. I was upset.

It's painted with a red pink tone, which really lets it stand out charmingly between the 2 buildings. Already, it looks welcoming, and intimate. As soon as you step in, it is very dimly lit, candles everywhere, small, and cozy. The staff is all very friendly and upbeat. We got seated towards the back, next to the fireplace which was a nice surprise.  What small restaurant has a fireplace? The inside is very rustic, old, but sets a nice tone, especially with the size of the restaurant. Has a nice charm to it, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to go on a nice little date. All in all, it's a cute place! Secondly. The food. I was with a group of 3 and we each got an appetizer and an entree. I got the Burrata, and the cheese was delicious. The Kale salad was HUGE and it was a very generous portion for an appetizer! And finally, the Meatballs and Garlic toast. These were... amazing. Soft meatballs smothered with tomato sauce and mozarella cheese. There were... 4-5 of them? I know all three of us were eyeing those mother effers. I swear I wanted to order another one just for myself. I got the grilled hanger steak, my girlfriend got the grilled duck breast, and my brother got the Pan roasted hake. What I loved about the dishes is that you really have to take a piece of everything on the plate, and eat it together in one bite to really appreciate the flavor of the dish. For example, You can just eat a piece of the hake.. you have to cut a bite of the hake, and a piece of the lentis, and eat it together to really get the flavors to compliment eachother. We got the chocolate pretzel tart for dessert, and some other cheesecake.. which I dont seem to remember. BUT. The chocolate pretzel tart was gooooddd. I Was afraid it would be way too sweet and rich, but it was perfect. Had a nice fudge texture to it, and the pretzel tart was a nice crispy compliment.If you want a cozy, cute, intimate, rustic place with great food, and friendly service, this is your place.",3,1,0,Kevin N.,"San Ramon, CA",126,56,8

The staff is incredibly friendly and down to earth.  The bartender poured wine for my girlfriend and father with a heavy hand, and their beer listed included selections from around the country.  He overheard that it was my birthday and gave us a free round.Overall, the place is perfect for first dates where you don't want to be distracted, and the bar is great for those times where you're close by and looking for a place to grab a drink.  If you're looking for a loud and crazy spot, then don't look here.Side note:  I dropped a star for the $$$$.  Get ready to spend here, but if you're looking to impress it is well worth it.",1,0,1,Nick F.,"Hoboken, NJ",1,3,0

My best friend was coming into town so I didn't want to chance no getting a table.When we arrived, Tiny's as it may be, was not full. We were seated at a two top with a folding chair shoved in against the wall to make it a three top. It was not ideal, to say the least, but I didn't want to start dinner off with an argument. Besides, I am stuck on a special diet for the time being and wasn't going to be able to order a regular entree, so I'd rather not have anyone pissed that they gave us a bigger table and we didn't eat enough.We had two entrees, a bottle of wine and a cocktail to start. When our waitress took our order she expressed her displeasure at my not eating. (Trust me, I would have loved to.) We did not see her again until she trust down dessert menus. Other folks, pleasantly, ran the food to the table. To be fair, we were so close to the kitchen the chef could have just handed it to me. But it's ""Tiny"", right? We ordered more cocktails and dessert. The drinks came, and when dessert was place on the table, so was our check. I was really surprised by that, but the waitress wasn't going to be winning Miss Congeniality, so it seemed like par for the course.We paid the bill right away, and sat eating and drinking. In fact, I had my drink in my hand when the waitress returned and announced that we had over-stayed our reservation and that we needed to leave. I have worked in the restaurant industry for a very long time, and NEVER heard or seen anything so incredibly rude. Even if you need the table, do you really handle it that way? We were obviously quite upset, and the manager must have been summoned by someone else on staff as he appeared and tried to sort things out.

So Tiny's definitely delivers on the dim-lit, brick-lined, vintage poster feel. The only downside in terms of ambiance was the music - too loud, we had to shout to be heard; while that's fine in a bar it's not ideal for a restaurant (especially not the cute date type place). Food wasn't mind-blowing: kale salad I could've done myself, the hake was nice and tender but not very flavorful, and the watery lentils around it just enhanced that feeling.

I guess over time this place has grown on me. Wonderfully cute, unpretentious, and very laid back. Love the rustic interior, the antiques, and the good ol' flag carried over from Beatrice Inn.

4.0,1/25/2012,"I went in for lunch around noon during the week, which was perfect because the small space filled up quickly after that. The hostess was very friendly and accommodating. I sat in the back, which had a very French feel (much different than the front) near a lovely working fireplace. Very nice ambiance. It took a while for the waiter to show up. When he did he was friendly enough. I ordered the sweet potato apple soup which was wonderful. Good size and very flavorful. The small chunks of apple were an unexpected surprise. I then had to wait a while for the waiter to come back (he had taken my menu after I only ordered a soup) to order my lunch. I ordered the Kale salad, which came out quickly and was a good size. This salad was THE BEST salad I have ever had. Perfect. You have to try it, even if you think you don't like kale. The ingredients (kale, fresh apple, walnuts, Gouda and this perfect dressing) were so harmonious. I was able to take half home and eat it again, which was great for the price. Overall, I had a great experience and would go back. However, and no offense to my server who is in no way the worst I've experienced, the service could be  better. It was average. I've worked in the industry for a long time, and really value a good server (I don't require a hipster-y, model type to be impressed with a place).

4.0,1/16/2012,"I live a block away from Tinys and every time my BF and I have walked by around dinner time it looked packed and cramped. We decided to finally give it a try for a late dinner after a movie and I am SO glad that we did!! I am in love. The ambiance is adorable- perfect place to go on a date or to catch up with a couple friends. We sat in the dining room downstairs near the back which I would recommend, the tables in front are kind of on top of each other.  Its definitely ""tiny"" and very quaint but they do a good job with the lighting and decor to make it feel intimate and cozy.  The drink menu is pricey ($13) and the drinks come in the smallest little glasses I have ever seen! If you are a sipper of booze and can make a thimble of alcohol last you more than 15 mins then by all means order them, but for me they went down way too fast.  That said, the three sips of cucumber vodka soda lime concoction I had were delish. I will stick with wine next time- they have a nice selection.  For appetizers we had the sweet potato and apple soup - YUM. It was chunky and rich with a drizzle of maple cream and croutons- perfect for a cold winter evening. For dinner I had the Kale salad and my BF had the scallops with a side of beets. The Kale salad was AMAZing.  I want to eat it every day. It was a hearty portion- plenty for an entree and definitely filling. It came in a large bowl and was tossed with walnuts, apples, and chedder cheese. mmmm. The scallops were a nice portion as well and perfectly cooked. The beets were just eh, tasted like they came out of a can.  We didn't try dessert this time but the selection was very tempting....the girls next to us were oohing and aahing over their selection- think they got the chocolate pretzel tart. Prices were fine, living in TriBeca I don't expect a bargain anywhere so it was pretty reasonable. $100ish with tip for 2 drinks each, apps, and entrees.Love love love this place and cant wait to try it out for brunch and check out the bar upstairs!",2,0,1,Rachael M.,"Niantic, East Lyme, CT",4,18,0

3.0,1/3/2012,"Summary: Exceptional decor and show-stopping dessert don't quite make up for the solid but hit-or-miss food.When Americans get wistful and say to each other ""we should go to Paris!"" this sort of restaurant is exactly what they are envisioning. The building is a small, 200 (exactly) year-old townhouse in Tribeca and you can tell that it is landmarked just by the appearance of the bricks on the outside. There is seating in front, back, and upstairs. We went for lunch and sat in the back which is a softly lit, small space with 6 tables centered around a roaring fireplace, which the waiter stoked regularly. It is decked out in antiquey looking details - iron light fixture, original brick, walls covered in tin and canvas and wood. Very peaceful.The place was empty when we arrived, and service was as attentive as is logistically possible - they would refill our water glasses after we took half a sip. The waiter was so outrageously, cartoonishly hipster we almost thought he might be acting. Every time he came over it was as if he had forgotten where he was and then had a moment of ""oh, hey, I guess i'm your waiter. that's chill. the burrata is awesome. I just had some, like, a minute ago.""I had a grilled chicken sandwich with fried avocado and spicy mayo. The chicken was a touch dry. The mayo was rich and intensely flavorful. The fried avocado is a neat idea but the avocado kind of solidified and lost that special creaminess. My girlfriend had the smoked ham sandwich. She enjoyed it, although the combination of the heavy, rich smoky flavor and the thick melted cheddar was a little too dense for me. Both came with home-made potato chips which were crisp but undersalted, dry and flavorless. We had a side of caramelized cauliflower with raisins and almonds which didn't taste caramelized, instead tasted almost pickled. We weren't expecting it to be cold and neither of us cared for it.We were full but ordered desert anyway because we were seated next to HENRIK LUNDQVIST and his family (he's a co-owner), and we wanted more time to gaze at his beautifully sculpted, angelic Swedish face. We had the orange gingerbread cake which was unexpectedly wonderful. The cake was warm, moist, with a perfectly crisped top. It came with a fantastic orange sauce and spiced cream with bits of candied ginger in it. We're big dessert people, and this was truly mind-numbingly good.Overall an extremely pleasant place for lunch, especially with the fire going on a cold day, but would be much improved by a more consistent and inventive menu.",4,6,7,Matthew D.,"Manhattan, NY",19,15,0

I'm not much into mixed drinks, but I started off with the Dark and Stormy, and my beau asked for whatever sweetest drink the bar could concoct (ending up with a pomegranate concoction called the Brazillian Wax) and both were made to perfection. I don't remember what our friend had, but she ended up ordering more of what I had (the dark and stormy), iand it was all we both had the rest of the night.My boyfriend has a gluten allergy, and we started off with the waiter informing us of everything that was either already gluten free or could be made so and double checking on the ones he wasn't 100% sure of. Quick to get back to us on all of our questions! The beau ordered the duck, and our friend and I ordered the chicken, all of which were cooked to exquisite perfection! I loved the duck so much, however, I ended up demanding we return the following week so I could have it all to myself!In all, we had a fabulous time, and I'd rate the duck up there with my other favorite in NYC, Blue Hill. It's pricey, and you HAVE to make a reservation for dinner or you won't get in (we have no troubles walking in for an early brunch, however). That night, we had possibly the best waiter in the house, but we've had a mix of service otherwise: from good to mediocre. The hostess (owner?) recognized us by our third visit and even listened to our thoughts on the food and drinks, both complements and critiques (I ended up prefering the 'gluten free' version of the duck!), and reading the reviews on this site, it looks like they read and improve upon these as well, because we've yet to have even a mediocre experience here.

They were so good though.  When we finally decided to leave it was packed and hot as hell in there.  We closed our tab and we discovered a perk to an understaffed bar.  We got charged for basically 3 drinks when we had six.  My friend and I had an awesome night there.  Gets a little too crowded so go early and get your seat and guard it with your life because seating is few and far between.  Not quite sure its worth a trip to Tribecca just for this place but like I said I had an awesome time.  So if I get another invite I'll be going :)",2,2,2,Melissa G.,"Manhattan, NY",7,99,0

After we ordered our food a waiter came over and told us that he was going to be our waiter for the rest of your stay. I kindly asked him the name of the vineyard and and he looked it up and showed me the bottle. I went there around lunch time and the only menu they were serving was a bar menu with 5 items on it. I ordered the crab dip with ritz crackers and celery and my boyfriend had the beet and goat cheese salad. The food was not bad, however, the portion size was a joke. For the price, the salads portion was ok, however, mine was extremely small. They filled a dipping size ramekin with crab dip and it only came with 4 pieces of celery and 6 ritz crackers.

3.0,5/18/2011,"I visited Tiny's this past Monday. Obviously the place is quite small. There are 2 seating areas downstairs separated by the bar. A staircase leads upstairs to a 3rd seating area. We made a reservation and requested an upstairs table. We were offered a menu which described 5 appetizers & 5 entrees. They also had a reasonably priced & well selected wine list. Our guest, Marco DiGiulio, ordered our wine. Moments later he was presented with a wine by the same vineyard, but not on the list...at all. He mentioned this to the waitress & suggested she tell the manager as the wine we shared was more expensive than the one on the list.We were a foursome so had good opportunity to give Tiny's brief menu a good test. My son ordered a whitefish rillette with everything bagel chips, my wife had a salad with fennel, apple, and sugar roasted walnuts with a lemon vinagrette, I had the pekeytoe crab dip (also served in a small ramekin) with Ritz crackers and our friend started with a small plate of meatballs in sauce featuring Di Paolo's mozzarella. I felt the meatballs were dry but the fresh chunky tomato sauce was quite good. My wife reported her salad to be REALLY good. My son's rillette (also served in a small ramekin) was smokey and delicious and the bagel chips were too few but complimented the dish nicely. I enjoyed the crab dip & would order it again.About midway through our appetizers Tiny's staff decided to turn on the music. This was unfortunate as it drowned out the voices of our tiny group around our tiny table. I made my first request to the waitress that they turn down the music a bit so we could continue having our conversation. No results though.Our entrees were delivered. I made the same request about the music & she made some ridiculous statement along the lines of ""I guess they're in a meeting upstairs and can't get to it right now."" Huh? I guess the customers don't come first at Tiny's? In any case, our entrees arrived amid the din. Our pleasant conversation overwhelmed by the music once and for all. Two of us ordered the lamb with mashed potatoes & brocollini & the other 2 of us ordered the skirt steak accompanied by sauteed Swiss chard and cubed ""crunchy"" potatoes. My wife described the skirt steak as a bit tough but with good flavor. She mentioned that her ""favorite part of the dish was the potatoes."" The portions were dramatically different as the lamb folk were given two 1"" medallions while the steak eaters were given more than twice that amount. Suffice it to say, Marco & I enjoyed our lamb but we sure could have used just one more slice for the $25 charge for this particular entree. The skirt steak was $23 per plate.We each ordered desserts to finish...I'm hazy on the details now, but essentially they were a tres leches parfait,  kumquat brulee, and a circle of malted meringues atop panna cotta. We each enjoyed these offerings very much.I would have enjoyed the visit far more if the music had been at a more reasonable level and sympathized with the other diners attempting to speak to one another. I believe the portions for the entrees were disproportionate as were the prices on some of the items (whitefish rillette & lamb specifically.) Dinner for the 4 of us was $226 before tip and only $33 of that was the wine. Tiny's space is small but their bill became quite large for their simple fare. I think I'd rather dine at ""Forgione's"" for that amount in the future...",2,2,3,Tom F.,"New York, NY",66,45,105

5.0,5/2/2011,"I had lunch at Tinys on 3 days ago and I must say I was very impressed. We had a sampling of food including the turkey chili, the burger topped with a fried egg and pickled beets, and the sweet potato and maple soup. We had some sides, cocktails, and dessert as well. Everything I was served was delicious and very high quality. I will definitely be returning to Tiny's in the near future, and I recommend everyone to go. I can't wait to go back and have dinner!",0,0,0,V L.,"Staten Island, NY",1,10,1
4.0,4/20/2011,"Happened to stroll in there for lunch on their first day of business after reading an article about it. The place has a cool vibe. It does have that ""Peels"" feel about it with the whitewashed exposed brick. I got to sit upstairs and it is very good for a quiet lunch away from the office. The food was fantastic. I had the antipasto salad which was delicious and big enough to share. The cocktails were a plus! Very friendly waitstaff. I am very pleased to have this place in the neighborhood. I would strongly suggest checking it out before it gets too popular. This place will fill up fast!! Nailed it.",0,0,0,Lauren F.,"Manhattan, NY",16,5,2
4.0,4/19/2011,"I just had lunch on day two of Tiny's nascent life... and it promises to be a lovely addition to the neighborhood. This two-level restaurant/bar exudes charm and has (for now) a small menu of ""American"" classics: cheeseburger, BLT, soups, salads, and various veggies... I had a Cobb Salad (much better than others in the neighborhood, for sure), and the plates coming out to the other tables looked delicious (especially the burger). The place is tiny, and feels like a cousin of Freemans or Peels in decor. It could become dangerously cramped, but is perfect on a mellow afternoon.Right now, they're only open for lunch... they will open for dinner in early May, and then introduce a brunch menu (yay! an alternative to Bubby's or Kitchenette!). I will be back, especially to try that burger...",1,0,0,Harry H.,"Dusseldorf, Germany",35,46,5
