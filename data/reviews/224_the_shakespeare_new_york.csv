5.0,4/25/2019,"RSecond time here but now I brought my wife with me. We traveled into the city for some shopping and dinner and we were very pleased at our experience at The Shakespeare.  I previously had lunch here but now my wife was with me for dinner.   We were greeted by friendly people that seemed happy to see us and happy to help us.  We started in the upstairs bar called ""Raines Law Room"" and it was absolutely beautiful with an ""old world"" taste.  The list of specialty drinks was long and I finally picked a drink called the ""Wildest Redhead"".  (My wife is a redhead.)  Its base was scotch but the honey and other ingredients made it perfect.  After finishing our cocktails we went downstairs and enjoyed our scrumptious dinner.     I was very pleased to see Alex as he had served me on my last visit.  With his help, we choose a few of their appetizers that we never see at other  restaurants because of their ""English"" nature.  Again I had the Scotch Egg and my wife loved it.  You must try it!     While my wife was amazed how good her specialty hamburger was,  I went with the Bangers & Mash. (Alex's recommendation.)  It was three exquisite Myers of Keswick sausages over mash potatoes with a light onion gravy.  No it's not what I usually order but my server,  Alex, was spot on, again.      Definitely try this place for lunch or dinner.  I'm very happy I returned here.

5.0,4/20/2019,"Midtown is a weird place to get a drink. It's hard to find a chill bar with good music and great service (Sebastian is the best!) but The Shakespeare has you covered. Stop in for a beer or cocktail and some great pub food. It's a good crowd, lively but not rowdy. And the music selection is excellent. Also, sorry I dropped that wine glass the weekend before last - Bart, thank you for cleaning the mess up!",0,0,0,K D.,"Manhattan, NY",1,12,5
4.0,4/19/2019,"Stopped in here for a drink with a friend after work. Already packed when we got here, but still found some room in the back of the bar section to post up with a few drinks. Its set up as an English style pub with a sitting room for those eating and the regular bar for drinking. Cool decor for a midtown east bar.The food looked good, but it was too busy for us to grab a spot where we could eat, so we did a liquid dinner. Loved the selection of beer. I had two of the London's Pride, which I haven't seen elsewhere in a while. Took a while to grab a beer with so many of the after work crowd, but I didn't really expect anything different from midtown. Looking forward to coming back.",0,0,0,Daniel M.,"Manhattan, NY",241,43,33
3.0,4/10/2019,"The Shakespeare is, appropriately, very English. Came here for a work lunch, and despite the fact that this restaurant is basically in a basement, I was pleasantly surprised by how much light the dining room got. We ordered the pickled veggies (if you like pickled anything, you will like this), the popover (tasted like air, do not recommend), and the chicken liver pate to start. The pate was surprisingly massive, which I didn't expect for the price, and very good, albeit rich. Recommended if you're in a big group (we had 10 people) and everyone wants a taste! Otherwise, that app is going to put you to bed. This restaurant doesn't seem like it would have too much in the way of lighter options, but surprisingly they have a whole vegan menu? I was trying to keep it healthy, so I ordered the artichoke and avocado salad and added salmon. The tomato confit and lemony dressing were really flavorful and tangy, which I liked! And the salmon was cooked well. That said, the salad was pretty tiny compared to everything my coworkers ordered (shockingly, no one else wanted anything off the vegan menu), and I ended up eating all of my neighbor's leftover fries. Would definitely come back here again for a work lunch or happy hour drink, though.",1,0,0,Vickie W.,"New York, NY",32,153,300
3.0,3/20/2019,"Very English-atmospheric pub in a hotel basement a couple blocks from the Morgan Library, so convenient for lunch when I was spending the day there.  There's only one (bottled) English cider on the drinks menu (though there are plenty of American ones), and when you order it they'll come back later and ask if you didn't mean the lager from the same brand instead.Among the appetizers, Scotch egg.  This was good; sausage tasty though not particularly thick, and the egg yolk is not quite hard boiled, which I really liked.Had a Cobb salad, not particularly notable except that, by doubling the price, I was able to have salmon added, which came in a large but very tender chunk on top, which was possible to break up and mix with the greens.",2,0,0,David B.,"Sunnyvale, CA",31,706,0
2.0,3/6/2019,"Stayed for about 45 min on a Friday night. Very crowded in the bar area, where it had a frat-house vibe. Some tvs were on, but it was so crowded you wouldn't be able to see it. NOT a diverse crowd; all the usual suspects you'd expect a frat-house kind of bar. I decided to leave early because it would've been impossible to get a drink, find a place to stand, and hear myself think. I also would've stuck out because, like I said, it's not a diverse crowd -- not only in the patrons but also the people that work there.",0,0,0,Lore A.,"New York, NY",0,42,6
3.0,2/24/2019,"My friend and I were trying to get into a speakeasy upstairs, but had to wait. So we went downstairs to this place. It was a Friday night so maybe I am being unreasonable, but it was so crowded and the crowd there were either gorgeous men in their pataguccis or weirdos. Maybe I would have given an extra star IF some handsome dude complimented my own patagucci, but nope. It was too crowded just to sneeze. Keep your sneezes to yourself and pray you don't die. I stood by the bar and this girl to the right kept bumping into me and rubbing up against me. Seriously, I do not like getting touched like that for long periods of time unless they are buying me a drink and is tall/handsome/male. Obviously I was in a prissy mood (tax accountant here. I get a pass). Then there was this guy that was talking to his friend right behind me and he was just yelling. I tried so hard, as my brain cells are dying from the drinks I was having, to concentrate and talk to my friend, but it was to the point I was had it and just told the guy to back up or shut up. Sorry...not sorry. Just when you think things can't get anymore strange, a perfectly normal guy was wrestling with a not-so-normal looking guy. Looked like the guy was getting his little guy examined. Saved by the bell, I got a text from the speakeasy and just needed to close out my tab and leave IF they ever came back to me. I didn't mean to be assumptive, but just assumed that the one bartender was hispanic so I decided to use my grienga Spanish to get his attention and it worked. I got my bill, paid, chugged my drink, and dipped. I do not think this is the kind of place I'd go to catch up with a friend... Where art thou! (Sorry.. I had to)",1,1,0,Alice R.,"Manhattan, NY",10,111,4
2.0,2/22/2019,"Met a friend here for drinks on Thursday night . Honestly drinks are okay, but the bartender was very rude and had an attitude. He just seemed very unhappy  as if he hated hi job. When we first walked in, he tried to make us go upstairs and then locked the door at 11p, way before last call and gave people mean looks all night. I'm here to have a good time not pay money to get dirty looks from the bartender. We were staying at a hotel near this place.  I can't say I recommend this place",0,0,0,jackie w.,"Denver, CO",347,109,168
2.0,2/17/2019,"I come to this place all the time but this last time was a disaster. I was there on Valentine's day with a friend, the place wasn't as busy as usual. Our table was wobbly so we asked for something to keep it in place, we didn't get that, had to hold the table with our feet so our drinks wouldn't spill. We asked for all food to be served at once. We were served our meals one after the other, the triple cooked fries were disgusting. As a former londoner I know chunky chips, those are not it! They were greasy, and so undercooked i couldn't cut through them with a knife. Just serve french fries if you can't cook potatoes! I said they were undercooked and would like an alternative since it wasn't the first time but I was refused an alternative. Considering the price we paid for everything and the fact that i usually go there at least 3 times a week, i expected better treatment and to be allowed to order another item. They have waffle fries, mash potatoes.. i would've given anything a try to not break my teeth on raw potato",0,0,0,Anne-Laure P.,"Manhattan, NY",39,3,0
2.0,2/9/2019,"Came here for dinner... it may be a good place to go for drinks, but not for food IMO. Ordered the fish and chips. First of all, it's a fairly small amount of food. The solitary fish was relatively small. Taste was ok, but I think the batter to fish ratio was so high. Fries were good. Ordered the sticky date toffee pudding for dinner which was terrible. It was not sweet at all. And had no date flavor. Easily the worst I've ever had (including compared to ones that I've bought from the supermarket). Service was poor. I don't think anyone smiled. And they continuously kept returning and asking if we were ready for them to collect our plates (while one of the people were still eating)... the restaurant was empty btw. Won't return.",3,1,2,Angelo B.,"Westfield, NJ",206,710,700
1.0,1/18/2019,"I hosted a 60 person private event for clients at The William. Afterward, we were told we could head down into the pub to continue our evening. I cannot begin to express how rude the staff at this space were. The one bartender viscously verbally attacked a coworker of mine for asking her for WATER and proceeded to make a scene in front of my clients about it. Moments later, another client of mine had a drink accidentally spilled, and when she approached the bar for napkins this same bartender threw napkins at her. Unbelievable mistreatment of guests and a total embarrassment, especially considering we spent over $7,000 for a two hour private event. Upon e mailing the event planner we worked with to organize the event, they certainly had enough time to charge my credit card the remaining $4,500 balance for the event, but have yet to address the issue. Do yourself a favor and never host clients at this place, or go there in general, unless you enjoy being berated by their insanely unprofessional staff.",1,0,0,Noël R.,"New York, NY",0,5,0

2.0,12/28/2018,"Hate to say it as I used to really like this place, but it has gone down hill in a big way.  We went for the Boxing Day meal this year and it was pretty bad.  My husband had cooked better potatoes & carrots for Christmas, the chicken was super fatty, and even though the waitress specifically said that the gravy was served on the side, the whole plate was doused in it.  We don't mind spending a lot for good food, but this was nothing of the sort.",0,0,0,T K.,"New York, NY",13,110,0

3.0,12/14/2018,"First of all its very British. Quietly refined and tasteful and you know what they used to say about the food in London. There's a lovely bar downstairs with lots of great draft choices and an inviting, wonderful ambience. Same holds true upstairs for food. I'd been here and had a burger (thumbs up) a while back and needed a good spot for business lunch where I could actually hear and not feel pummeled. Food is not memorable but it's ok. I had the lunch prix special of trout and a veg soup that was unmemorable but the trout was delicious. Lunch partner had salmon (big thumbs up) and salad to start. It's conveniently located in midtown on E 39th Street off Madison.

5.0,12/2/2018,"I went here for thanksgiving lunch 2018 after the Thanksgiving Day Parade. The decor is a very well maintained, Colonial sitting room style with an intimate bar setup in the back of the lobby. It was quiet, warm, with lots of old world charm. The food itself was quite good. For $65, we had a prix fixe menu with starter of ravioli in pea soup with goat cheese and bacon, main course was a plate of dark, white turkey, with wonderful sausage stuffing, sweet potatoes, cornbread, and other trimmings that were well done. Dessert was a pumpkin pie slice with homemade whipped cream.  (good, but pumpkin pie was served cold, wouldve been better warmed up). A side note- the mayo was a great homemade aioli type. AMAZING. Overall 4 for the food + 1 for wow factor = 5 stars.",1,0,0,Alvin Y.,"Rockville, MD",163,44,98
5.0,11/18/2018,"We loved the uniqueness of the space and the fascinating decoration! It was a little confusing at first because it appears that the bar downstairs is called The Shakespeare (it seemed to have a rustic pub vibe) but the restaurant upstairs is called something different, even though our reservations were for the restaurant. The atmosphere was intimate and the lighting was a perfect balance of bright enough to see your food but dark enough for a cute date night.I was really pleased with the range of vegan options, especially since The Shakespeare specializes in elevated British pub food. I had the vegan shepherd's pie, which was filled with a flavorful and slightly spicy combination of potatos and lentils. It was super filling, if a little on the drier side. Service was great and we were really pleased with the meal!",1,0,0,Tina G.,"New York, NY",28,14,1
5.0,11/14/2018,"One of the best hidden gems in the city! There are two beautiful lounges with wonderful music and ambience. Downstairs is a full English pub and a secret room like the speakeasy of the 20's. The coolest place I've encountered. The drinks are high-end and they don't skimp on the alcohol. We went late so we weren't able to taste the food, but you can believe I will be going back, especially because they have vegan options. One of the owners, Ron, was amazing as well.  He really made sure we were taken care of.  If you're looking for a fantastic spot to relax, enjoy great drinks and atmosphere, head to the Shakespeare.",0,0,0,Kim A.,"Prosper, TX",2,13,2
1.0,11/13/2018,"This is more about the attitude of the place than food or service per se, but I feel the need to write it ... a few weeks back I had my reservation for 6ppl canceled by the restaurant last minute (due to an issue in 1 room & needing to accommodate a private party - which was booked after my reservation), putting me in a bind to find a decent spot for dinner - long story short they said if I come again they'll make it up to me (gift card was mentioned but nothing concrete) ... fast fwd to last Friday ... I called to confirm that Jeff/Geoff the manager remembered me & was told ""yes - and he'll 'take care of you'""Turns out we have much different ideas as to what that means ... after ordering a decent amount of food - Jeff comes over with an appetizer on the house ... we'd already doubled up on apps, but this is a good start, I thought.That was it. Nothing else.I might seem deluded/ungrateful cos technically they didn't owe me anything - even tho they created a lot of hassle by canceling my original reservation, but he should've told me to go f myself rather than this. This was like tipping your super $5 for the year. Despite ordering plenty of food & drink, a club soda was even charged full (in most NYC bars/restaurants if you're ordering plenty then a club soda from the soda gun isn't charged).The food wasn't even as good as I'd remembered from my previous visit.Not that Shakespeare care, but plenty of other places to dine out for better prices, better food & better attitude from the management.

1.0,11/3/2018,Normally I love this place but I made a reservation on opentable app and when I showed up I was told I don't know why they let you make a reservation the dining room is full. We were taken down to the pub and shown a table on top of another party. Then another couple came in behind us and the hostess helped them and left us. They did not try and accommodate us very much.

1.0,11/2/2018,"The Stealers is more like it. I came here to grab a late lunch with a friend on a day where it was supposed to rain. Thank god it stopped raining after I finished eating. When I first into the restaurant, I was greeted by staff and one of them offered to take my umbrella for me. I didn't think anything of it. I had my food and drinks with my date and when we were leaving I asked for my umbrella back. They didn't know where it was and it went missing. I was on a date and didn't want to make a scene so I left. (this was a $40 umbrella) A few days later I called the restaurant and asked to speak with a manager over the phone. The person that I was transferred to was named Jeff. He said he would get back to me but never did. Very bitter about this and probably not coming back.Food: 3/5 at most.

1.0,10/30/2018,"New to the area, walking around a few nights ago and wandered in for a drink with my husband and a friend. My husband and I each had a beer. Before we left we decided to each have a shot of tequila to warm up. The bill had me floored. We paid $32 for 2 shots of tequila, and it wasn't some excellent bottle that would be worth that. It was Casamigos. A $40 bottle at the liquor store, $23 online, not to mention they are a bar therefore get wholesale prices. How in the hell does a bar justify charging a person a quarter of the price of a fifth for an ounce of liquor? Also, the tunes they had on were totally not cohesive with the atmosphere. Why does a dark, classy-tone bar have sugary sweet pop music blaring so loud you can't hear your conversation?I had every intention of visiting again, what with their ""super secret speakeasy lounge"", but after paying almost $50 for a tab of two beers and two shots of basic tequila, I think I may pass.",0,2,0,Kaile D.,"Bronx, NY",3,36,15

The vegan corn soup was perhaps the most flavorful vegan soup I've had. Wonderfully imaginative menu -- good for the traditionalist, the gourmet, and the vegan. And fairly priced for the quality. Definitely two thumbs up. But there are some idiosyncrasies: you need to order bread separately. And if you want it with butter, remember to ask for that too.

4.0,8/9/2018,"Note: this is a review for the patio Upstairs at the Shakespeare, not the bar downstairs.While a bit hard to find the actual restaurant (the William is also home to the bar downstairs, as well as Raine's Law Room), we finally managed to find the patio outside after asking for some help. Glad we did! This place had a cozy small rooftop and the food was well done. We ordered the ginger old fashioneds to start which were good, but a little on the sweet side. The cheese board was tasty but the biscuits that they were served with were a bit crumbly and hard to spread cheese on. For mains we got the burger and fish and chips. The burger was nothing extraordinary but was well cooked to order. The fish and chips were the real home run - delightfully crispy batter on the outside but tender, soft fish on the inside. The only con was that the piece was a bit on the small side for a dinner portion.

As the bartender handed them their drinks the duo even tried to help by saying what drinks we wanted. When my friend verified the drinks we wanted the bartender snottily shot back she would not look at him and only me in the eyes. I then tried to order drinks and she walked away.  As the male clientele poured in the bartender only served them, she came to our area twice and i reminded her we were still waiting, and mentioned we had been here before everyone else in the bar, but she would not take our order.

On a cold blustery Saturday night in March, I did.  Dark and lovely is how I would describe the place.  There were a fair amount of people crowding around the bar so my boyfriend and I decided to grab a table in the dining area-which I highly suggest if you want to hear what your drinking/dining companion is saying. Decided on their specialty-Hot Mulled Wine.  It was just what I needed to warm me up and it was also very delicious.  I skimmed over the food menu which looked very enticing-had a lot of British classics, however, the kitchen was closed so we didn't order anything.  Definitely give the Shakespeare a try, I'm glad I did",1,1,0,Samantha B.,"Cleveland, OH",127,165,187

3.0,1/26/2018,"I had heard so much praise for the food at The Shakespeare, but I only wound up making it there for drinks so far.  The basement space was hard to find (enter through the hotel's main entrance) and resembled a true British pub in its decor, but lost the European feel in its vibe, in my opinion.  The bar service was slow; the beer list was mainstream and disappointing; etc.  My friend and I grabbed seats at the bar and ordered glasses of Mulled Wine.  The rich red nectar had been seasoned with traditional accompaniments, like cinnamon, but had a bit of a smoky undertone, as if it had been burned when they were heating it.  The drink was fine, but certainly not the best mulled wine I have had.Since I was only there for drinks, I rounded up to 3 stars; I need to return to The Shakespeare for the food and to sit in either the quaint, Victorian dining room or their seasonal patio.  The actual bar area was nothing special, and the lame beer list made that side less compelling.",5,0,1,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640
1.0,1/8/2018,"Being two Brits in New York, we were truly excited to get a booking at The Shakespeare for Christmas Eve dinner. We arrived and were shown to a table in the dining room, which was fairly busy but not packed. It took a while to get service but we ordered a couple of pints and two roast dinners, one vegetarian. Our sever returned to say they'd run out of nut roast but had a lentil cake substitute so with no other choice we said yes.The food arrived well before our drinks and was, quite frankly, inedible. It takes a lot for me to complain but I did so immediately: the roast beef was cold, the potatoes were barely warm and hard, and the Yorkshire pudding was so overcooked you could break a tooth on it. It was obvious that the whole meal was frozen food reheated. Our server, who seemed to be the manager for the night, apologized and re-ordered my dinner. My wife's plate was at least warm but the lentil cake was heavily curried, which is just weird for a roast dinner, and was also overcooked. At this point another table, also English, were complaining about their food and I learned there was another complaint before we arrived who had compared the restaurant to Fawlty Towers - very apt except it wasn't funny in any way, shape, or form.The chef came out  far too quickly with another (reheated) plate of food which was awful but at least hot and the Yorkshire pud was softer. Chef is probably an overstatement in this case, especially as he was unprofessional enough to say that the server hadn't told the kitchen there were any issues until my complaint so they couldn't rectify things. I was starving so ate about half my meal. I was offered a free beer, asked for a Speckled Hen and was served a Boddingtons: not exactly a great effort from an English ""pub"".It took a very long time for our server to return when we had finished and when he did he blamed the kitchen staff and said he was doing his best. I think the other guests may have left without paying as their bill didn't materialize.All-in-all this was one of the worst dining experiences of my 49 years on this planet. I've always said it's hard to find a bad meal in New York as the competition is high and it has an excellent service culture. Shakespeare's Tavern is an exception to that rule: awful food; terrible service.No wonder so many Americans still think English food is bland and rubbish - they get that impression from places like this.

Nice start.They had a good happy hour, but the food was way overpriced for a place with a tavern feel. This isn't fine dining, guys. Why the hell are there $25+ entrees?And THEN - after ordering another round and some extra bread (I ordered the ricotta appetizer to snack on, which was a generous heap with one piece of bread. ONE!) our server disappeared. We asked for another round and some addition bread. Ten minutes later, our drinks finally came out, but not a scrap of bread. And then, just like that, he was really gone. Like... shift was over, left the restaurant, GONE. And didn't ask the new guy to cover his tables, so this poor dude's just doing his sidework, oblivious to how royally pissed the remaining tables are. And here I am, with 75% of this appetizer and no way of eating it.I finally asked the new server if there was bread coming. He was super apologetic and put a new order in. And then we waited... Again. It took OVER TWENTY MINUTES and I got a plate of bread on par with Wonder Bread.What the actually F.I get that it's ""just toast,"" but it's JUST TOAST. It's not rocket science!!!And then again, couldn't get our server.

I would like to give their cocktails a ""3"" but think they still deserve credit because British pubs are not cocktail bars. But guys, if you're interested in upping your game, bring those cocktails up a notch! The mint mule was decent, but really just an alright Moscow Mule with a mint garnish. The Pomtini (wait why is there a pomtini on the menu here?), in my opinion, had a cough syrup after-taste. The Bee's Knees was good, but lacked a little depth--- maybe it needed more honey? But, really, if you're going to a British pub, don't expect the cocktails to rock your socks. Shame on me for not ordering pints. I digress... The great bits: fish and chips= yummmmm. For snacks around the bar, I loved the ricotta toasts and avocado toasts (salmon toasts were just OK). The bar has an old-timey, but updated decor, and is great for a happy hour with close friends- as you can actually hear each other talk with the acoustics. Speaking of acoustics- a band played live last night (very much contemporary jazz, not British in the least ha) and they killed it.

My ladies just enjoyed the feeling it had due to bringing them back to #WheninLondon by pressing the tiny button hidden behind the velvety sofa..But something that really discourage me was the attention given to me by supposedly the manager.. Let me detailed on that.. Well after a few cocktails later I was embracing great convos w/ my gals and the rest of the patrons and had left a gift that was given to me by my adorbs friend. I realized once I headed to my place that I left it dangling on one of the hooks corner end of the bar.. Well called at 6:30am and spoke to Chris( left msg re: this), then later around 8:30am decided to call again spoke to Gianna ( very amicable and cordial lady), 2 hrs passed didn't get no call back like I left msg and number to see if they found it, In my head I tend to say 3rd time is a charm, let's see if I'm lucky and they found present, to my luck had the ""Supposedly Manage"" will repress the name because once I feel that someone doesn't make the effort to help, doesn't stay in my head to process, she clearly Stated that she closed that evening and didn't see a thing...

For all of yelp to see - below is our exchange:Manager 4 hours agoBlock & Report Owner Hello Joan,I wanted to apologize for the confusion with your recent meal. The Christmas Fare was being offered but only to tables that had reserved in advance. The reason being, we only purchased the items for that menu for the reserved tables. I do understand your frustration as this was not explained to you! I am glad your previous experiences with us had left you feeling like a VIP and we do strive to make that the feeling whenever someone is dining with us. Should you wish to book with us again, please make sure to let us know which room you would prefer to be in and we will happily ensure that you are seated there. We do have the same menu for both upstairs and downstairs. Again, my apologies and I do hope you give us another chance.Best,Heather CarterAGM Joan H. New York, NY 23 minutes agoHeather, I did make a reservation and chose to come here explicitly for the Christmas menu.  Also the staff was completely clueless when I asked about it, and insisted there was only one menu.  Of course I was baffled when they gave a neighboring table the special menu later.  I really think you should better investigate what happened and work to improve the training of your staff. Heather C. Manager 10 minutes agoBlock & Report Owner Again Joan, I am sorry. In order to have ordered the Christmas fare, you would have needed to make note of it when making your reservation. I apologize that it wasn't more clear in the wording on our website and flyers. The staff would have thought there was only one menu because the other reservations that had booked the Christmas fare were set up as a prix fixe and those have special menus; regardless of which prix fixe it is. I will make sure that in coming years we are far more clear about the holiday menus. Joan H. New York, NY 6 minutes agoAs I said - you really ought to investigate the facts more thoroughly first.  Your answer seems completely disingenuous since that was the answer your staff should have had when I asked about it - instead they acted like it did not exist.  Second - the table next to me, from my recollection, seemed to be a walk-in that did not pre-contemplate the Christmas menu - I remembered them all thinking whether or not they wanted to participate in the Christmas menu. You just telling me things that don't comport with the facts is just like you saying I'm lying or making something up.  Why don't you just take my review seriously and go back to checking on the training of your staff to avoid future poor reviews from others? Further - it's true that I booked on opentable - so if it should have been noted there, then you should have had opentable indicate that.  Finally, don't prepare menus that cannot be adjusted to accommodate - it's just not wise.wise. Heather C. Manager A moment agoBlock & Report Owner Joan,I am taking you seriously but I am afraid that no matter what I say, I am not going to be able to make things better for you. I have tried to explain the situation and I will certainly do my very best to ensure this does not happen again. Joan H. New York, NY A moment agoNo, I realize you cannot turn back time - but for you to just repeat to me what makes zero logic with respect to the facts I gave shows you did nothing to properly investigate what happened.  Instead you insisted on your version of the facts (alternative facts!) and dismissed my experience.  I suggest you take reviews seriously and consider what the customer says, and go back to investigate and correct/improve wherever you can. And thank you, but I really do not intend to come back to patronize the Shakespeare again, and if others suggest to come here for a meal in the future I will insist against it.  I would say that is in response to the way you treated me - not the one off at the restaurant.",7,2,0,Joan H.,"New York, NY",213,485,3

4.0,12/8/2016,"The Bangers & Mash: A+The onion gravy is fantastic. The ratio of bangers to mash is perfect. And you all know I love a good banger in the mouth. The Scotch Egg: A-It's actually the best Scotch Egg I can remember eating. The only reason for the slight demotion is because we asked for another one, and it never showed up (we rectified this on our second visit by starting with four). My Blood Type: A+Clearly an indication of what an exceptional guy I am. I only hope that sharing this knowledge doesn't come back to haunt me when one of you uses me as a blood bag after the apocalypse that is now inevitable since Donald Trump's election.*The Service: B-One evening our French waiter was unfailingly accommodating as he brought us all the British food, and all the alcohol. The only knock is that whole Scotch Egg thing. He may have just decided that I didn't any more food, and he was right. Unfortunately, on a subsequent evening, our American waiter was just slow with everything, undoubtedly costing himself a solid percentage of tip as we would've drank a lot more if he was on top of it.The Beer Selection: A-It isn't huge, but there's a solid variety of bottles and drafts happening, and it's helpfully divided into lights, mediums, and darks.The Shakespeare Burger & The Soup du Jour (that's the soup of the day): AI only had a bite of each, but both were everything I could've wanted.The Mushrooms & The Beef Carpaccio & The Bone Marrow: IncompleteI don't really like giving out grades below a B, so I'm going to leave these as in progress. They were the only things I didn't like about the menu.** None of them were particularly memorable, and the carpaccio was supposedly served with Yorkshire Pudding, which may or may not be my favorite thing in existence...this was a weak rendition, and it made me sad. All in all though, The Shakespeare is a classy choice for a gathering of gentlemen, and they will let you stay and drink long after closing because they are quite hospitable people. If you eat a scotch egg and the bangers and mash, and wash it down with a lot of good bourbon and beer, you will be happy.____________*I think I'm kidding here. **They do need to rethink their ""Toasts"" section of the menu, actually. A scotch egg is not a toast. And if it was all toasts, you don't need to say ""Pumpkin on Toast."" It's implied.",22,19,16,Peter D.,"Brooklyn, NY",4675,3021,10459

Nothing exceptional but they were all fine. For dinner I had the chicken tikka and the wife had the tea brined chicken. The tikka was a little different than you'd find in an Indian restaurant, with raisins and almonds, but I really enjoyed it. The wife's dish, however, was awful. It was a flavorless, flaccid piece of lukewarm meat. Perhaps this is how it's supposed to be. Perhaps this is the pinnacle of fine British cuisine and our unsophisticated palates failed us. But with no waitress to be found we just decided to push it aside rather than risk salmonella poisoning.

4.0,11/16/2016,"Had dinner here on a Friday night. Overall I loved it - the ambience and decor made it feel very European which I loved. All our servers were super welcoming and nice and also made a great drink suggestion when I had trouble picking a cocktail. We had a different server for drinks (a very nice young lady) and then another server for our entrees/dessert (a very nice, tall young man - who was kind enough to let me ask him some questions about French when I noticed he had a French accent. I am a huuuuuuuge Francophile and always trying to learn what I can about all things French. Thank you sir for allowing me to pick your brain, even if it was only to ask where the bathroom was haha!).Friend and I both had the Fish & Chips and split the Chocolate Tart (she had just a tiny spoonful, which left more for me - wheee!). All the food and drinks were delicious.The entree was a bit on the smaller side but the quality was excellent.The Shakespeare is in the William Hotel (hotel has black awning leading upstairs to a brownstone building) and also next to a parking garage.There's 3 ways to get inside: (1) If you only want to go to the bar part for drinks & bar food: From E39th Street, go to the separate entrance on the lower level - to the right of the William Hotel (there should be signage saying ""The Shakespeare""). When you walk in, there's a small pub-style dining room on the left, a staircase w/heavy velvet curtains leading upstairs in the middle, a pub to the right, with a small couch/loveseat by the main door. Pub was very crowded around 5:30pm on a Friday.(2a) If you would like to dine in/sit down meal - Option 1: From E39th Street, go up the stairs to the William Hotel. Hostess should be right by the door. She will guide you to the main dining room for the Shakespeare, which is down the hall past the front desk (Note: The room to your left when you walk into the main entrance to the William Hotel, I think is for the Raines Law Room - which I think is another lounge/restaurant within the hotel).(2b) If you would like to dine in/sit down meal - Option 2: From E39th Street, go to The Shakespeare's separate entrance on the lower level. Go up the velvet curtained-staircase in the middle of the room. At top of stairs, go right. This leads to the William Hotel. You should see the Front Desk to your right. Continue right and you'll see the hostess station by the main door to the hotel.A few other things:- Bathroom: Is to the left and then behind the Front Desk of the hotel. Ladies' room had 2 stalls. If you see yourself out of toilet paper, look for the dark container behind the wastebasket and there should be a few extra rolls in there.- I think Open Table reservations are only for the dining room/s.- I suggest making reservations for dinner since it started to fill up around 6pm on a Friday. Another man and a separate group of people walked in after me with no reservations and they had to wait.- Main dining room had a large table in the middle, smaller tables/booths all around. Room is cozy but might be hard to get around those seated at the main large table in the middle.- They have a coat check, by the hotel's front desk.",6,1,1,Christie S.,"ASTORIA, NY",29,211,83

So let's get started.It is a GORGEOUS basement pub that, if you didn't know you were in NYC, could almost whisk you away to a quaint Cotswold countryside pub.  I absolutely loved the look.I was on standby for work so could not partake in the many MANY British beers on Tap; From Boddingtons to Old Speckled Hen, there was so much to choose from!I had an unsweet iced tea, a Scotch Egg, and the Salmon burger.  The Scotch egg was fantastic as was the Salmon Burger(mainly for the sauce that was on it).  The waffle chips were over salted and almost stale tasting.The lady behind the bar was nice, she really was. It's just that I went my entire meal without any Iced Tea. I had spent the day walking and drank through two heavily iced small glasses. She had run out of anymore and had set to making some. However, I just never got anything until after the meal was finished.  Maybe she was waiting for it to brew? I have no idea. I just have a bit of a pet peeve about having an empty glass while eating; she could have offered water? She also had a long conversation with a few workmates about work(normal stuff - hours worked, who's not pulling their weight, yada yada).

I booked their private dining room, ""The Peacock Room"" (upstairs, adjacent to the main dining room) to run a focus group luncheon for my company. The space was a perfect combination of excellent food, exceptional service and a lively atmosphere that was still quiet and private enough to meet our needs (a necessity as we were recording our luncheon session).All of the spaces at the William are beautiful and interesting - The Peacock Room made a particularly good impression on our guests! The wood paneling, large fireplace and actual stuffed peacock made it feel like we were in another era, not just a private room. The food was exceptional as well - the scotch egg has been one of my favorites and time after time it doesn't disappoint! The Salmon dishes were a favorite at the table as well as the tomato tart that was on special - I do hope to see that item on the menu again soon.I was very happy with the staff at all stops along the way. Beginning with the kind wait staff and hostess upon our first visit when we were scoping the place out. They introduced us to Sarah who manages the events during our visit; she took time out of her day to show us around just after our lunch and was very easy to work with as we coordinated the main event through phone and email over the following weeks.

We got the Snug room, which is a unique and intimate space, albeit lacking oxygen.Ordered the bangers and mash, because it's the kind of ridiculous food name you hear in passing that makes you go, huh wtf is that?And it's basically just 3 sausages served on top of mashed potatoes under a small pool of onion gravy. It was interesting, but this kind of food really doesn't speak to my favorite palette at all. I imagine if I grew up with a predominately meat and potato diet instead of a rice and spice diet, I'd dig it.I'm happy to come back for drinks, because it really is a nice environment, especially for the area, but I'll probably skip the food menu.",0,0,0,Shibi M.,"Manhattan, NY",308,297,177

5.0,7/12/2016,"Plenty of seating both indoor and outdoor. Romantic, social, casual - all themes present here. FYI Cocktails are NOT the same with the Raines Law Room, but it is still good, though limited. I helped myself to an old-fashioned. The Mint Mule was ok, but had this syrupy aftertaste that didn't sit very well with me. However, I'd say save your appetite for drinks for Raines Law Room next door. Had to get the Chicken Liver and Fois gras parfait (which is also served at Raines). Even someone who dislikes pate can't say no to this delicious delicacy. One thing I wished they would do is give additional brioche toasts that accompanies the dish. There's so much liver and not enough toast!The brussel sprouts were different from any brussel sprouts I've had. I'm used to crispy and cheesy ones. These were more soft, as they had been cooked in tomato sauce. Different but still delicious. However, I do still prefer the crispy texture versions. What makes this place stand out beyond all restaurants I've been to was the amazing team led by Tibo. The service was really top notch, starting from the hostess who greeted us at the door and escorted us to the table, to the servers, bartenders, and of course the amazing manager, Tibo. They pour their hearts into the dishes that they serve. Everyone kept checking in on us, including the hostess, making sure we were having a great time, and we were! We were able to try the scottish trout, a favorite of Tibo's, which came paired with his favorite white wine. Now I do have to disclose that this, the wine, and few desserts were given as a service. Everything was delicious including the fish and chips, the tandoori chicken salad's meat was on point - very tender and juicy. Scottish Salmon Gravlax was also good, a tad salty, but flavorful. It's a very light dish, so don't order if you're hungry. My favorite part of the night was the desserts. OMG. The banana toffee trifle was heavenly! But the manager had us try the chocolate tart and ice cream, and the chocolate mousse.. If you had to pick 2 desserts, I highly recommend the chocolate tart and the trifle. (Anyone else think about Rachel Gellar attempting to make her ""meat"" trifle from Friends?). You can also have your dessert served at Raines (albeit on a separate check of course). If you are interested in Raines Law Room, I would highly recommend visiting following your meal. It was too late for me to make a reservation online, but when I first walked into the lobby, I spoke to the hostess if there was any space available, and he said that there were. He told me I could give him a 30 min heads up before dinner ended so he could set aside a table for our group. I'm telling you, I haven't been to many places in NYC, but this is one of my favorite places to go and I am planning on bringing any visitors who come to this place!

4.0,6/12/2016,"This pub is a hidden gem in midtown. My husband and I were meeting three friends for brunch - all English majors - to celebrate William Shakespeare's 400th birthday. It's located at the bottom of a boutique townhouse hotel called ""The William"" (the former Williams Club) so  it's easy to miss. Don't. The atmosphere is traditional wood with a rustic feel. The room to the left has a pool table and a few tables. To the right and a few steps down is an informal long bar also with small tables dotted about the room with a few big screen TV's. There's a unique ""private room"" sectioned off at the end of the bar for a quieter spot in the corner. Without hesitation the five of us grabbed it. When you want service you tap a small sliding door and the bartender is on the other side ready to take your order. (Anyone remember the show ""Laugh In""?) The food was surprisingly good, with a majority of the selections being traditional English fare. Fish & chips, bangers and mash, scotch eggs (no one ordered), black pudding, crumpets, ginger beer, English ketchup... along with some standard brunch selections. My mushroom and goat cheese omelette with a mixed green salad (I was the only non-English major) was perfectly done and delicious. As was everything else served. One person felt the fish was a bit heavy on the batter but the chips were a hit.Even the bathroom's wallpaper mirrored the English featuring stamps with Monarch's on them. We took a tour of the hotel upstairs and were surprised by the clever and tasteful renovation. Completed 3 years ago it's a boutique feel set in an old townhouse yet the two themes blend. Some classic club feel (persian rugs, upholstered furniture, very early 1900's) mixed with modern colors and textures. A nice change from the typical - and now predictable - hip chains. The hotel apparently prides itself on convenient elongated stays (some rooms have working kitchenettes) and the prices seemed reasonable (they vary according to the calendar). If you're visiting NYC you can't beat the location, just 3 blocks from Grand Central and located off Madison. It's also within walking distance to Broadway without living among the horrendously noisy Times Square crowds. We decided it would be our NYC meeting place.

The bartender was kind enough to lead us upstairs to the host stand, where we were quickly seated in the back of the building.The restaurant is nicely decorated and gives off a good impression of fanciness. Our table was elegantly set beneath a large chandelier. The wine list offered a good number of choices (we opted for the Prosecco) and our waiter was attentive and unobtrusive, popping up conveniently whenever we needed him to fill a glass or take an order. I had the fish and chips, a favorite of mine. The fish, a large portion of cod fried perfectly, was presented in a wooden block, and the long, thick cut chips were served in a can. The serving size suited my appetite, with enough of the fries to share. My companions similarly enjoyed their food (the avocado toast, the tandoori chicken salad, and the salmon burger).

The following was ordered:Potted crab salad with toast -- Crab salad was creamy and tasted really fresh. Cute presentation! Scottish salmon gravlax -- Very delicious. The combination of the paper thin radish, cucumber, and sorrel will bring me back. Organic scottish salmon burger -- This will bring me back again and again. This is one very delicious salmon burger and I am normally not a fan of these. I found the patty to be very juicy and flavorful. The play of flavors from the red pepper relish and the chancellor sauce had my taste buds singing. This was absolutely amazing. Would highly, highly recommend this. This comes with a side of thinly sliced potato fries; I did not like this too much. I found it too greasy. Banoffee Trifle -- For a dessert, I felt pretty healthy eating this!! Just the right amount of sweetness to satisfy your taste buds. The bottom is a base of graham cracker crumbs topped with caramelized bananas, topped with freshly whipped cream and bits of toffee. I totally recommend this!! Overall, I loved the food, thought the service was great until crowds started flowing in and enjoyed the calm atmosphere.

Luckily, yelp has a search app for just this, so long story short, this seemed to be the best rated place in midtown.The location is kind of innocuous, and it's very easy to miss since the sign is very small. Actually, the sign is tiny, and you're more likely to spot the image of shakespeare's head than you are the actual words on the sign... but just keep looking around and you'll find it.The place has an intimate vibe, and is dimly lit, but not so dimly as to detract from the experience. They have a bunch of good drink options, but when I went I got the apple cider. It didn't taste alcoholic at all, but it was still great.As for the food here, there are a lot of authentic options, but I went for the bangers and mash.

The ""no-frills"" space may make more sense for what seems to be a good beer and wine happy hour (which is why I preemptively give 3 stars instead of 2), but for an early dinner priced the same as much more enticing spots around the city, this will not be a place I will go out of my way to find again.The bored waiter confused more than clarified about daily specials and drink options and although the $19 bangers and mash were satisfying enough, they came out as lukewarm as the service, and what was initially a promising dive into a surprising, comforting find in midtown, turned into a below average dinner in a dusty, Shakespeare themed basement.",2,0,0,Marshall F.,"New York, NY",0,8,0

3.0,1/15/2016,"I had such a weird experience here. Most of it came from the waiter. I forget the gentleman's name, but he was peaks and valleys. The way he described their daily appetizer with charred greens and delicate egg yolk was superb. Totally sold us on the dish, which turned out to be mediocre. Great salesman! But then throughout the course of the meal he dropped plates on three separate occasions. You'd think that part of the job description of waiter has to be ""able to carry plates and not drop them all the time"" but maybe it's not. Maybe the most important thing is to upsell. I don't know.Some of the food was great. Loved their take on a Scotch Egg. But the Shephard's Pie was one-note and pretty weak. They had a good beer selection, a nice atmosphere considering the neighborhood and a bar scene that went from lively to dead in an hour.If they could take the bad parts and make them good, this place would be a gem.

Pictures of Sir Shakespeare are scattered throughout the walls, and the setup of the dining tables are in such a way that it feels like an intimate space (great for dates!). Aside from quite a varied beer selection, they have wine and several 3 choices of cider including one on tap which is more than usual. Food here is great. I had the Scottish Egg which is like a thin fried meatball with a whole soft boiled egg inside it and it was SOOOO flavorful and well seasoned. I also loved the fish and chips. The batter they use for the fried fish is  super thin and light and crispy. The French fries are very thick cut and I found them to be a little on the dry side but between the drinks and dipping sauce it was fine.

4.0,12/17/2015,"Found this place through Yelp as we were desperately trying to escape the hordes of Santas at SantaCon last weekend. It is adorably perfect and really brings to mind a proper British pub. They have wonderful standard British fare including a full English breakfast, Irish porridge, Scotch eggs, crumpets, golden syrup. It's quaint and cozy, perfect for a winter morning or evening and reasonably priced with perfect portion sizes (not too big, not too small).Half of our table ordered the chive scramble with smoked trout and a crumpet and not a crumb was wasted. Everyone was so pleased. My MIL ordered the fish and chips (because duh) and it looked spectacular. She was thrilled and I hear the fish was fried to perfection. The chips were enormous and just a bit soft in the center. A real treat. The Scotch egg is enormous, though perhaps not big enough for a meal on its own. It was beautifully crisped on the outside and the center of the egg was still a tad runny.

4.0,11/7/2015,"Paid a trip to Manhattan for the first time in many years to see a show. Researched a number of high-end pubs and settled for ""The Shakespeare."" Located at the corner of 39th and Madison Avenue. Look for the sign with Will's face. Several other reviewers were correct in saying that it's underneath the hotel. Beautiful looking pub, and a lot smaller than I thought. Arrived at Happy Hour, and I'm glad I did. Ended up paying $30 for 3 rounds. We ordered the last round several minutes after Happy Hour ended, but he gave us the discount anyway. The main reason I visited The Shakespeare was for the cask conditioned ale. This is the way they make beer in England--naturally fermented, low-carbonation, and at a slightly warmer temperature than typical keg beer. I tried their ""Shakespeare Ale,"" which I assume is their house style. Man, it was delicious. Wish I had the bladder for more.We also decided to have dinner, which is why my review is notch down. We arrive 8 minutes before dinner; the hostess wouldn't seat us before hand. I don't see why they couldn't seat us and start us off with drinks, but whatever, that's their policy. When we were finally seated, the dining area was small and very cozy. Immediately, when my wife sat down on the bench which connected to several other tables, we were told not to leave our coats and bags next to us in case someone else sits there. Considering the fact that they have no coat service and the place is so tiny, it's next to impossible to find a space for your personal belongings. Besides, if someone needed to sit there, we would have gladly moved our stuff aside. After reading some reviews about drink prices, we made sure to ask our waiter if we could get Happy Hour prices at the table. Apparently not. No big deal, we simply walked up to the bar and got our half-priced drinks. But I find it petty that we couldn't get a discount, especially when we were buying 50 dollars worth of food. My Salmon burger was tasty. I was hoping for those thick-cut fries on the side, but instead I got chips (literally, potato chips) that were way too salty. Wife ordered a salad and a potato leeks soup. Good food, but way overpriced. We finished off with sticky toffee pudding, which for me was underwhelming.Overall, a good experience. The main reason I went was for the beer, and again it did not disappoint. But I certainly didn't enjoy the uptight atmosphere. Having been to London, I know that your average pub is a casual, laid back experience. The Shakespeare gives me the impression of being an upscale Manhattan bar/restaurant disguised as a British pub.My suggestion to management is to keep that casualness and stop trying to be so dictatorial in the dining area.",1,0,0,Joe D.,"East Brunswick, NJ",6,98,7

4.0,10/16/2015,"I really like The Shakespeare. Beer selection is good. They pour Old Speckled Hen and it tastes wonderful, and they have a selection of other English/Scottish/Irish ales, as well as a rotating selection on cask. They have a nice happy hour, even on Saturdays. I've only been to this place on Saturdays, and apparently they aren't very busy on Saturdays, as they usually get the after-work crowd. So maybe happy hour on the weekdays gets packed, but the weekends are actually pretty relaxed. I've never had a problem getting a seat. Their happy hour beers are all $5 a pint, which is a good price - esp. when you can get a beer that usually runs for $10 at the happy hour price. I guess they have some food on happy hour, too, but i'm not sure. Their Burger goes for $18, which is a little steep, but the fries that it comes with are amazing. These really fat, crispy fries. I honestly was a little bit underwhelmed by the burger, but the fries make up for it. A little gripe - they served the burger on this cutting board, not on a plate, and the food was basically falling off the edge of the thing. I had to put napkins under the board to catch falling fries/onions/whatever. They stack the fries high in this pyramid shape, so they're just teetering Jenga-style all ready to fall onto the bar. Kind of annoying - get larger cutting boards or switch to plates.Service can be a little lame - it seems to be mostly kids in their early 20's that do a better job of chatting with each other than checking up on their customers. I often have to wave someone down to get another beer, or whatever. On the flipside of that it's a good place to chat with your friend and feel like you have your privacy, since the bartenders rarely pay any notice to you. Another thing - two times I've had to remind bartenders that it was happy hour after they printed out my check using non happy-hour prices. I think they just honestly forget that it's happy hour when putting in the beers - maybe it has something to do with the setup of their computer systems. Anyway it's kind of annoying to have to say ""uh, it was happy hour, remember, I'm a cheap bastard.""Still give this place four stars, though, because I like the atmosphere and the beers are great. I haven't had a cocktail or any food other than the burger, but I've heard the fish and chips are great.

I started with the scotch egg. It was meant to come with slaw and tartar sauce. Instead it came with just small serving of mustard! The egg itself was hard, the meat over seasoned and the breadcrumbs slightly burnt. It was edible but not a typical British scotch egg, and in my opinion not worth $10!Next I had the brunch toad in the hole (I was hungry!!). This was an epic fail! I had three small bites of a very odd tasting sausage. The batter was soggy and stuck to the pan they served it in. The gravy was definitely not caramelised onion flavour. Again, edible but not worth $14 by any means. I had such high hopes that this would become my go to 'home away from home', but I don't think I'll be returning.

More than 10 minutes to even get a waiter and water.  Ordered a bottle of wine that took so long that we decided to order by the glass instead, which produced the bottle. Took more than an hour to get our entrees and mine was cold- cold fish and chips! Actually, only the fish was cold.  Waiter told us several times that a manager was coming to talk to us, but she appeared only with the bill and said tonight doesn't reflect our usual service and handed me the full bill. No discount for the inedible fish, no discount for the hour spent waiting for dinner,no offer to buy our wine or an offer for desert. Just an admission it was a bad night and the full bill.  My companions said their food was good (salmon burger and hamburger). I think the fish might have been good if it wasn't so cold.  Hopefully it was a bad night. They did say it was super busy, but half the tables were empty.  Beware.

I expected the fish to be crunchier. But I have this thing where I have to eat my fries first. So by the time I got to the fish it was much cooler. But still delicious. Though everything was fried it didn't feel heavy. My sister enjoyed her meal. I really love the service we received. That was five stars alone. Amy was a nice waitress. And Michael was the icing on the cake. He made sure we were enjoying ourself. Wished me happy 21st birthday ;). To top it off he has them bring the table a little tray of dessert.

4.0,7/23/2015,"The Shakespeare is located in the William Hotel. It's not actually inside, but more like downstairs. There's a ramp you take next door and that's where the pub is semi-hidden. The dining room looks like you could be in Shakespeare's home. There's a fireplace, pictures frames all over the walls, and just that general old-timey British home feel. (Not that I actually know for a fact what that looks like, but it's just how I would imagine it to be).To start, we had the grilled cheese as an appetizer. Though super greasy, it was really good. But then again, that's probably why it was so good. It had cheddar, stilton, and jalapeno. If you don't eat spicy foods, don't let the jalapenos deter you. There's only a little bit in there and it's just a very small kick. They also cut the crust off, which my 8-year-old self would have loved. But today, I wouldn't have minded them keeping the crust on.For my entree, I went with the quintessential British pub food - fish and chips. They serve it on a piece of parchment paper on top of a wooden cutting board. I didn't understand the parchment paper because after you put lemon on the fish, the paper gets wet. Then, the paper gets soggy. Therefore, I had some pieces of paper stuck to my fish, which I probably ate. Oh well.My boyfriend had the hanger steak and chips (with watercress salad, shallot, béarnaise). The béarnaise was way too rich for my taste. That also might be because I don't like anything that's super buttery. The steak was perfect. He ordered it rare, but it wasn't black and blue like how other restaurants interpret that word. The beef wasn't chewy at all, like I was almost expecting it to be. He also had the cocktails - Juliet's Pimm (Pimm's, Chambord, homemade lemonade), and the Julius Caesar's Old Fashioned (Elijah Craig 12yr., simple Syrup, orange bitters). Juliet's Pimm tasted like cough syrup.

Pretty punch hypnotized with Bourbon, mint iced tea and floral cucumber and sweet Pimm's and Chambord with tangy sweet lemonade quenched thirst. The creamy rosemary and herb-laced pot of homemade ricotta swimming with olive oil and aged balsamic was absolutely delicious spreading across the warm bread.

5.0,5/4/2015,"The first time I came to The Shakespeare was with a strange and dreary man whose name abbreviates to JS. I followed him here a day after I threw his relic of a cell phone across my bedroom, thereby shattering its screen and forever severing JS's link to the distant past. Luckily for JS, I owned the same cell phone in a past life, which, at the time, I thought to be a telling sign of our unique bond because we were the only people idiotic enough to buy it (it was $600 in 2011 which, adjusted for inflation, is $700,000,000 more than I would pay for it today).Anyway, we walked up to the inconspicuous entrance at around 4:30PM and JS, who suffers from every form of anxiety, needed to make sure that it was sufficiently vacant for us to sit down and pretend to enjoy each other's company while he assembled his new (my old) cellphone with stone-age tools. With the gait of a toddler who grew to be six feet tall overnight, he awkwardly came down the ramp to look inside a dark window and although I don't think he saw anything inside, he decided that this was a decent enough place for us not to make eye contact or speak until we (I) were (was) drunk enough. JS struggled to open the cellphone with his unwieldy fingers while I stared at the television and watched NASCAR.Shakespeare's has decent appetizers and strange cocktails. As I looked at the menu for my appetizer of choice, JS recommended I try the ""ssscotcchhh egg"" with the inflection of the entire cast of The Birdcage speaking in unison. I refused and ordered the oversized calamari instead (which was crispy and not rubbery), but I tried the Scotch egg and it was good from what I remember before I blacked out.I drank a blue cocktail which I didn't enjoy as much as my go-to choice of a bathtub gin martini, but I have bad tastes and nothing I write in this review should be trusted.The place eventually filled up and people were standing around like fools trying to shout over each other (it was Friday evening). JS was shocked about the influx of people because the last time he was there it was perfectly quiet on a Sunday at 2pm. I came to this place once after with a classmate and ate his grilled cheese, which I believe to be the best item on the appetizer menu. The chicken liver and foie gras parfait was a Bed Bath and Beyond glass candle filled with pâté, covered with what I thought was actual candle wax but what later melted into a puddle of grease on my cutting-board serving tray. The music was a selection of exclusively English artists, which was a nice touch because it took me a few songs to verify this observation to be true and kept my mind occupied.I recommend this place to anyone who is unfortunate enough to drink in Murray Hill but astute enough to avoid the overly crowded mediocrity of the neighboring bars. I would come back here a third, fourth, and fifth time for the grilled cheese. This is a good place to talk shit about your date to your date or to your classmate about other classmates.

I decided to try one of the evening's pie specials. Several were offered, I asked my waitress which she'd recommend, so I went with the chicken korma and whipped mashed potatoes. I also got the poached pear and Stilton appetizer and a cider. The selection at the bar was solid.The appetizer was very tasty and blended sweet and salty. It was a bit messy with the crunchy bruschetta and crumbly cheese, but with a drizzle of balsamic and a nice presentation, it made for a good starter. The pie was exceptional. Sealed cozily into a fantastic pastry crust that was both flavorful and had a good texture, each piece of chicken was well-seasoned but not spicy with light curry flavor and spice. Very generously stuffed with juicy white meat chicken, the pie's best friend were the creamy and buttery-tasting fluffy mashed potatoes.

5.0,1/29/2015,"I've come here a couple times for drinks as a good friend lives a block away but finally got a chance to sit down for dinner a couple nights ago. The Shakespeare is located underneath the William Hotel and the interior design of the bar has always reminded me of a cozy (british) grandma's house, even though I don't have much personal experience with that.There's a pretty great beer selection and I think every time I've come I've tried something new and enjoyed it. When I came for dinner I opted to try one of their cocktails and the Hot Toddy was just was I was looking for. My friend and I ended up ordering the fried calamari rings, bangers and mash, and the grilled sea bream all to split - some tough choices were made as everything on the menu sounded so delicious!! The food came out very quickly and we ravishly dug in as everything looked & smelled fantastic. The fried calamari wasn't the typical small pieces of fried squid-looking pieces, instead it was 5 HUGE calamari rings. They came with marinara and a sort of mustard/mayo looking sauce and were fried to perfection. Definitely a nice surprise to a usually typically ""safe"" choice for an appetizer.Now, I've never had bangers and mash before but after this meal I realized I should really be eating it more. It came with 3 juicy & seasoned sausages over mashed potatoes and gravy and (though I don't have much experience with this dish for comparison), was probably the best sausage + mashed potatoes I've ever had. When my friend suggested the sea bream dish I was a little skeptical as I prefer to have my whole fish cooked Asian (Szechuan yum) style but was not disappointed when the dish came. There were a couple pieces of grapecruit, watercress, fennel, and some other random veggie dressings atop the fish and everything complimented each others' flavors deliciously. We pretty much devoured the entire fish including whatever meat we could get from the tail / head!As I had never had any experience with ""authentic"" british pub food before, I was super impressed with everything and how different it was to any other style of food I've had.

3.0,1/25/2015,"My coworkers come here for happy hours quite often. Everything I've had has been on the corporate dime so I can't say anything with regards to pricing because I've never looked or asked for a menu.I usually get a mixture of higher end beers or standard cocktails like a rum and coke. Overall the drinks are what you expect from a higher class bar and nothing to write home about. Also, on Friday evenings, this place is always jam packed, making it pretty difficult to get the bartender's attention. This has actually been a bigger problem than I thought, even though I thought I was used to busy bartenders from my college days. I've managed to mitigate this problem by waving my credit card in their face to attract their attention. To my amusement, this method works every single time. This, in combination with the dark decor, makes getting drinks a bit of a hassle. I get that I usually go during peak time, but still.During happy hours we usually get a bunch of appetizers to share. My favorites are the cheese sticks and the giant catamari rings. Actually, I think I like all the appetizers they have. (Maybe it's because I never have to pay for them haha). The only time I wasn't satisfied was when they had some bread that was a bit too hard. Other than that, the finger foods are really good, and not too messy either.

It was a busy place with a nice decor. It felt like an 18th century Scottish pub but I have never been to Scotland especially 200 hundred years ago so don't count on my words. All of my knowledge about Scotland is from Braveheart and Starz network series 'Outlander' which is by the way, an awesome show and I highly recommend to watch it (flight of ideas). Bridget was awesome although she does not keep a diary hahaha (lame, I know). First two drinks were from the cocktail menu and were pretty good (one was Romeo and I forgot the name of other). I asked her to do something different and she made a German chocolate martini which was out of this world. I highly recommend it to be included in the menu. I did not try food but most people around me loved it. Noise level was pretty low and music was not very loud.

We were greeted by the server who reminded us that brunch was being served, but the burger was still on the menu. (no fish and chips.) However, the options looked good and the prices were lower (fish and chips=$23). The special board in the entrance hall had some nice looking pies w/ mash and french onion soup. Upon ordering, we asked for the soup. However, that sign hadn't been updated. (I belive there was another soup, but it wasn't what we were seeking.) Our friends ordered the fish cakes, the Full English Breakfast, and the corned beef and hash. My wife and I decided to split the English Breakfast. My summary of the food is that it tastes good, but is in very small portions. The fish cake is just one, small, circular cake. The English breakfast was commically small per item. Portions you might expect at Eleven Madison Park, for example. (The corned beef seemed like a reasonable portion.) I also noticed that there was no blood pudding included on our plate of English breakfast, which was included on the menu. I inquired about it and was told they were out. We were given double of something else, but it doesn't seem like they were going to tell us. (I did note that another server was telling people about that when they ordered the English breakfast.) Lastly, the service was not good. Our water remained empty twice over (I had to request refills) and our server, while friendly, seemed overwhelmed, never checking on us during the course of the meal.  Fortunately, another server came to assist the room as we were finishing up our meails.

But I was still glad I ordered them because the few pieces of pork belly don't come with anything on the side. I think if they tweak these minor details it could potentially be 5-star worthy. I've done a better job cooking at home as far as that was concerned. My friend ordered the burger and fries and seemed to enjoy it.

(for the bar, really?) and ""we can't seat you in the dining area until your entire party is here"" and ""you can't sit in the dining area and just order drinks"". Their house red wine is terrible (and cost $14, seriously?) but their cocktails are alright. The house made ricotta is pretty good, as is the scotch egg.There are way better bars around.",0,0,0,Jill S.,"New York, NY",16,421,0

I had the rosemary lamb pie and it was good but to be honest it was all potatoes and dough very little lamb and honestly I didn't taste the rosemary at all.  The pie crust was the best part of the pie but with all that potato it was overkill.  Though I didn't try them, burgers are about $18 at lunch and fish and chips were like $22.  That's high even in NYC.So food fine, check.  Cost  high, right, check.  The reason I won't be back was the chairs believe it or not.  I had to sit on a backless stool which every table has in addition to a built in booth style bench (with a back) but my wife gets that and yours probably does too.  So I had to sit uncomfortably through lunch choking down way too much starch and then paying $40 for lunch where we only drank water.So as they say in pubs across the pond - no thank you, this is not my cup of tea.",1,0,0,Jeff W.,"Williston Park, NY",0,66,1

They were salty to the point that I had to stop eating them because I genuinely felt nauseous. This never happens to me. I barely ever complain about food. If I don't like it, I generally comment ""Meh"". I will say, in retrospect, this may have been a mistake and I probably should have asked the waiter for a different set of fries, that weren't so darn salty. But hindsight is 20/20.

4.0,7/3/2014,"My friends and I came to the Shakespeare for dinner before we were off to the theatre, and we had an overall good time. It's an intimate English-style basement pub meant for sports gatherings and booze, with gorgeous exposed wooden beams and wallpaper.We made it just before the full dinner menu was available, so we snacked on drinks and the spiced nuts until 5:30. (Strangely, we were told that the sandwich of the day wasn't available until dinner, even though it was on the bar menu...) They have a bevy of booze on hand, though I stuck with a regular ginger beer which was thoroughly refreshing.For dinner, I went with the bangers and mash, which were very well done if a tad on the salty side. My bf's steak came cooked as he requested, and his fries were thick and starchy with the perfect amount of crisp on the outside. They even brought malt vinegar without asking -- amazing.The downside to the Shakespeare is the service -- though friendly, our waiter's attention was primarily focused on the ladies at the next table, then a new group of ladies came in... you get the gist. I get that it's a low-key place and this sort of behaviour happens, but mildly frustrating when all we want is a fresh set of drinks and/or the check.",2,0,1,Nicole L.,"Brooklyn, NY",102,554,5
4.0,6/30/2014,"Shakespeare, downstairs from the restaurant ""William"" (yes, I saw what you did there.  You're very clever.  Now settle down, the adults are talking) is an excellent choice for everything from a simple drink to full on pub gluttony.The atmosphere is slightly more than cozy.  Okay, so the bar is a little on the small side.  But it doesn't feel tight.  There is also a second room, but it is not always open.  It seems to be primarily for parties. The staff are very friendly, knowledgeable of the menu, and eager to create a good dining experience.The drink list is, admittedly, not extensive; but still ample enough to make all but the most ardent booze snob feel welcome. Pours are not stingy, and the mixed drinks are balanced and well prepared.The food at Shakespeare is excellent. Of particular note are the appetisers.  The homemade ricotta is light and refreshing, the warm mushroom salad is earthy and meaty, and the chicken liver and foie gras pate is rich and creamy.  The pickled pears with stilton are delectable.  They look like sushi, and while obviously not tasting like sushi, still evoke the balanced flavour and nuance of classic Japanese cooking.Among entrees, the bangers and mash are savoury and very filling, while the steak and kidney pie is simply a pinnacle of comfort and happiness.All the dishes were well executed, cleanly plated, and gone very quickly.The reasons Shakespeare misses the 5th star is for 1. the noise level in the small bar.  The music through the speakers, or alternately the sound from the TV over the bar, is blaring in the small space, forcing guests to yell at each other simply to be heard; and 2. low stools in lieu of actual seats at the few tables in the bar.  Not being able to sit back definitely makes for a rather difficult time having a relaxed meal.Regardless, Shakespeare is a real gem for the post-working day tonic or a hearty meal.",2,0,0,Adam G.,"Patterson, NY",27,116,2

4.0,6/11/2014,"Right below the William is the first floor pub, the Shakespeare (oh you!). Approaching this place from the west makes it infinitely easier to find, or so says my ADD friend with a directional handicap. Some have described this as a proper English pub. Having no idea what this means, I'll say it looks pretty much exactly like every other pub in the city but it has a cozier and slightly darker decor. The bartenders are extremely friendly, distinctly non-English fellas who will respond with a certain inflection in their voices making you know when you've ordered a good dish. ""May I have the salt cod mash and the fish & chips?""  ""You CERtainly CAN"" responds the bartender like your choices were serendipitous, the very two dishes his soulmate would've chosen. And the food was f**king good. That fish was crisped real nice, avoiding that ever so prevalent pitfall of being over greased and soggy. Chips were on the better side of average but it takes a special man to make a special chip. Can't fault them for that effort. But that salt cod mash. Sorry, I meant DAT SALT COD MASH with DAT BREAD. As George Takei would say... ""Oh my!""  My friend's cocktail was good. I can't recall which but I'm going to put it out there that they're probably all good as long as you pick one that fits your palate. I, myself, am a scotch man so I picked a peaty Laphroaig. Warning: ask the price of the top shelf stuff before you order. Luckily I had the sense to ask for the cost of a glass of Macallan 18 before ordering. It's $60 a glass which is beyond ridiculous. Compare this to Johnny Walker Blue which has a similar bottle cost of $200 but can be had generally for $40 a glass. Also overpriced but not to such an extent.

As for the burger, it also appeared to be a bit too filled with lettuce and onions. But that also seem to be a surprise as they both added the perfect amount of crunch.

The restaurant truly embodies the laid-back, conversation-centered culture that is the British pub. Tables of all sizes encourage couples who want a night away from friends without the stuckup ""date night"" feel, large groups of friends, and double dating. The wood walls smell of oak, like a Vermont cabin.I don't like the warm cask ale, but watching my boyfriend revel in it was endearing, and worth including in this review. No disappointment in English-styled beer selection: Old Specked Hen, Boddington's, Well's, Young's, etc. The bartender was in fact British, which made it all the better! Beers run you ehhhh $8-$10/pint.The ideal scenario would be: dinner at the Peacock (2 floors above the Shakespeare); casual debauchery at the Shakespeare; sleep at the William (boutique hotel above the Shakespeare). Add this to my Bucket List.",2,0,2,Jessica D.,"Columbus, OH",212,195,82
5.0,4/7/2014,"Thanks, fellow Yelpers, for leading us to this wonderful establishment!  The service here was friendly, helpful and attentive.  The wine selection was very limited though - they offered one Chardonnay, one Pinot Grigio, one Cab, one Pinot Noir, etc.  I guess this makes it easier to choose a wine - just pick a grape!  But if you want hard liquor, beer or mixed drinks, they can make it.  For starters, we ordered the house made ricotta.  So good, especially on warm, lightly toasted sour dough bread.  Also had the mixed green salad with lemon viniagrette - bright dressing over mesclun-like greens.  For entrees, I had fish and chips and hubby had bangers and mash.  Best fish and chips I've ever had outside of London.  Fish was very fresh and moist.  Don't know how we did it but we found room for dessert, the sticky toffee banana and date bread pudding and apple/pear crumble.  Thank you, Sarah, our sweet, pretty server, for making the bread pudding suggestion!  We can't wait to go back.",1,0,0,Aly Y.,"Morristown, NJ",12,268,12
5.0,4/2/2014,"The Shakespeare was such a happy discovery one night with my friend. It's tucked away and took us some walking around to find, but once we did we were thrilled.My friend immediately decided on the Pimm's cup; I should have followed suit, but ordered something with gin in it and hated it (not their fault, my fault for not realizing I just don't like gin that much). I asked our waitress if she could switch my drink to what my friend was having and she very happily came back with a Pimm's cup. I ordered 2 more after that, and loved eating the cucumber garnish.Around 10:45 we got hungry for some food, and ordered fries and the house made ricotta. Whoa. How is it that I need to come all the way to NY (I live in LA) to go to some sleepy little street to find this pub to have the most amazing fries in the world. Seriously, amazing. I also started stealing my friend's house made ricotta as dip for my fries, and it was a match made in heaven.The Shakespeare is a gem!",2,1,1,Emily F.,"Los Angeles, CA",90,116,9
5.0,3/31/2014,"I'm so happy I found this place! I was craving fish & chips after a dance rehearsal and typed ""fish & chips"" into yelp... so unassuming, I was worried it would be a little too high end but after peeking in the window it looked so warm, cozy, intimate, the lighting was perfect-- I walked in and the hostess was so sweet and accommodating. I had dinner by myself at a bar table watching the Devils game.... the level of the music was perfect too btw...The beer selection was intimidating.. I didn't even know where to begin.. I ended up choosing a Scottish beer called Belhaven Lager, it was delicious! Initially I was going to order the fish & chips since that's what I came there for, but immediately upon looking at the menu I saw a fried fish sandwich in some kind of buttery roll or something I forget exactly, but I went with it--- I was sooo glad I did! You guys this sandwich was incredible! I was going to stay and have another beer and was sooo tempted to try the deviled eggs I had seen on the menu... the table next to me ordered them and they looked so good. My phone was dead so I decided I should probably just go home... I'll definitely go back there  ASAP and will tell everyone I know!

5.0,3/18/2014,"The Shakespeare is the most amazing place I've ever encountered, aside from it's location. Murray Hill, ugh. Near Grand Central Station, double ugh. One pro is that it's on a sleepy street underneath The William, it's easy to miss and therefore empty past 9PM on a Friday night. Definitely a local spot and I'm insanely jealous of anyone who lives in the neighborhood. The kitchen closes at 11PM. With that being said, the food and drink are legit.I had the House Made Ricotta [$9] with olive oil and balsamic. It's served with crusty sourdough bread. It was kind of like a religious experience, submerging the bread in the soft and fluffy ricotta. I could eat it endlessly. Of course the bread/ricotta was used to wash down about three Pimm's Cups [$13] which is seriously garnished with a salad [2 slices of cucumber and a basil leaf]. It was amazing. My friend had the triple cooked thick cut fries [$8]. They were THICK and delicious, especially when dipped in the ricotta. I would love to come back here for a full dinner.",3,2,3,Felisa F.,"Brooklyn, NY",52,198,192
5.0,3/18/2014,"As a British expat, this is the closest I've ever come to a pub actually feeling like home. Wonderful atmosphere, cosy authentic decor, lovely attentive staff. I had the burger and it is AMAZING and HUGE and cooked perfectly to order. The chips (fries) are also fabulous, and taste the most similar to proper British chip shop chips I've had in the USA. I'll be back to try everything on the menu. My only complaint is the incessant bagpipe music that was playing, but that might have been just for Paddy's day (I hope so).",2,0,0,Hannah B.,"Brooklyn, NY",27,34,16
2.0,3/1/2014,"I really love the bar, beer selection and service.  The food on the other hand was subpar.  I ordered the Crab on toast which was said to be lump crab and cheese on toast but received toast with this thin spread for 10 bucks.  Now I don't mind spending a few bucks for good food but if this toast had any taste of crab or had at least some evidence of lump crab, I wouldn't mind.   I also had the fish and chips which it was a nice size piece of fish but it was a bit greasy.  It was served on a wood platter on top of paper which was sopping in oil (I've been to London and alway received a nice crispy fish there).  I gave this only two stars since it's very pricey and the food is subpar.",1,0,0,Paul h.,"Port Washington, NY",0,34,0

He said the Fish and Chips was the best in the Universe   I can't speak to the Universe but they were the best I have tasted. Crispy and Melt in your mouth good. Jane got the Hamburger, the best I have ever tasted (it looked so good I had to ask for a sample).The burger was very different in composition, taste and texture and it was HUGE! See the description on the menu photo. Pumpkin on toast with cheese was beautiful and very tasty.  Apple crumb with sour cream ice cream was excellent.  You have to taste that sour cream ice cream!!Pricey .....Gigantic Burger, Fries and Apple crumble.....smallish portions of fish and sour cream ice cream.  Murphy beer was an awesome sub for Guinness.I would go again and again but have to save a little spare change before I can go back.  One appetizer, Two meals, Three Murphy's, one dessert and tip was a little over $160.00.  Well worth the money.  We were full and satisfied.",1,1,1,Patrick H.,"New Haven, CT",0,13,9

The scotch egg was really delicious.  The bangers and mash was good; not the best I've ever had but definitely decent. I tried some of the shepards pie. I thought it was fantastic.  I was torn with the fruit crumble. The sour cream ice cream was great and the fruit was good but I didn't care for the crumble topping. The crumble wasn't bad but it wasn't good either.  I had a great time. The service was great in both the bar and the dining room area.

4.0,1/29/2014,"I've lived in New York all my life and I can honestly say this is the best burger I have ever had. It's huge and heavy, so be prepared. It has all of the best things on it though- a super thing pickle, super thin onion, brioche bun - the whole thing. The fries that come with it are big steak fries that are perfectly cooked and come in your own little bucket. OH and not to mention the apps. The crab on toast was heav(anl)y. The ricotta toast was to die for. The ricotta comes served in a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil and balsamic. Incredible. The beer selection is huge - something for everyone and every meal. The atmosphere was just casual enough for an upscale pub. It's a great place for a date, a group of friends, or even to sit at the bar and have some solo pub fair. As the place just opened, I can only imagine everything getting even better. You're going to want to check out the upstairs library/lounge upstairs for a drink or two before sitting down, so make sure you plan to spend some time at this great spot.",0,0,0,Emily D.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0
4.0,1/26/2014,"Charming atmosphere. Very dark by the bar, steampunk chic. The nearly secret entrance makes everyone feel like an insider. Love the industrial age and cottage style antique collectibles on the walls.Huge beer selection. I had cider on tap and shared the cheese platter. Three kinds of cheeses, a cube of guava paste, small pot of honey and a small post of chutney, wish there were a few more crackers, the excellent crackers on the platter were 2 kinds of oatcakes, and a nutty crisp bread but only 2 of each (total of 6).Will go back for a fish and chips meal soon.

5.0,1/18/2014,"Had an exceptional meal here last night. Although I was disappointed to discover that Old Speckled Hen on cask was sold out, I did get to sample the Old Crafty Hen as well as the Brooklyn IPA cask. The food offering was exceptional and really made this pub in particular stand out:The Scotch egg was served warm, made with a pork belly sausage. The egg was not overcooked, and stayed together. I was also very pleased with the mustard served alongside, although Colemans is also available. The Welsh rarebit was very good, although I've had more flavorful versions- this was a nice addition to our meal.I was also pleased with the Haslet, although suggest that it be accompanied with Colemans rather than the chutney. The celeraic slaw was both inventive and delicious.Finally: the Shepard's pie with lamb was packed with flavor: well seasoned and tender bits of lamb with a lush gravy.I absolutely love the fact that Malden salt is available for use on the table.",1,0,0,Pat T.,"堅尼地城, Hong Kong",64,195,35

I have not been let down once! This place is a great top pick for any time of the day. Breakfast is suppose to be starting soon hopefully. I got a sneak peak for a while and it was amazing!I've had the burger three times already. I am normally a Five Guys type of burger guy, while my wife is the In-n-Out burger type. This one gives both a run for their money.I am not a huge fish n chips type of guy, but once again this is something you should try. it's absolutely delicious.I've tried so many different things at this point, its hard to say what to choose first. So just go and explore the menu. You won't be disappointed..Finally, with The Peacock opening in the lobby of The William Hotel as well, this place has this ultra swanky vibe that permeates throughout the entire hotel.

4.0,12/28/2013,"A new addition to the places offering cask ale in this part of midtown.   This one looks pretty exciting.  It has three handpumps although, having been open only one week, only one cask ale was available.  That was billed as Brooklyn seasonal with no more details but my guess is that it was either a Brooklyn Bitter or ESB, beers which appear on cask around the city now and then.   Anyway it was a delicious beer leading with malt.   The cask serving was also just right in terms of natural carbonation, smoothness and coolness.  The other two casks are supposed to be Speckled Hen (I can do without that) and the Jones Wood IPA that is made by the excellent Wandering Star brewery in MA (named 'cos this place or the brewery must have a connection to Jones Wood Foundry in the UES I suppose).  If they get to 3 cask beers that would be great and beat all but dba Brooklyn in availability.  The cask beers are served in proper sized pints.  The bar bites looked very inviting - all very English which is great.  Have to come back for that.  The place is very attractive as well.So, I was keen enough to indeed come back a few days later and try some of the bar food.   It was all excellent.  I have been salivating about the Lincolnshire haslet ever since - a sort of pork pate served with toasts and various chutneys in a very ample portion.   Very English and great to be able to wash this down with good cask ale.",0,0,0,Richard S.,"Manhattan, NY",3,40,0
4.0,12/27/2013,"This lonely block of East 39th Street needed a restaurant.  Yes, there's the uber-busy Park Avenue Tavern on the corner.  There's also a tamale lady who sells breakfast in front of the Mexican Consulate, and a daytime food truck or two.  Thankfully, the seedy Verona Deli on the corner of Madison recently closed.  So it was wonderful to see the brownstone that used to house the NYC clubhouse for Williams College lease its basement level for use as a restaurant and bar, The Shakespeare. We visited toward the tail end of The Shakespeare's first week, so management probably didn't have a good baseline from which to gauge how much food to order.  So no demerits for being out of both seafood options -- fish & chips and a crab entree -- when we visited at 10:30 p.m. on the Thursday after Christmas. The kitchen graciously substituted a fish sandwich from the lunch menu.  The breaded & fried flounder was fresh, and the bun and sauces were perfect.  The sandwich came with freshly made potato chips. It was pricey, at $17, but we have no complaints about the food. The room is loud.  Even with the volume muted on the wide-screen TVs displaying football, the din of diner banter above the bar's energetic music was really loud.  So this may not be the best spot for those seeking quiet conversation.  The staff is very nice.  From the greeter to the servers to the bartenders, care has been taken by the veteran restauranteur owners to hire a competent staff.  We had one miscommunication ordering a martini and it was promptly fixed without making us feel like toads. Welcome to the neighborhood, The Shakespeare.  Looking forward to sampling more of your writing, er, food and drink.",2,0,1,Dave A.,"Queens, NY",39,54,75
