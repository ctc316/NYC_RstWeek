4.0,4/14/2019,"Came here for lunch per a recommendation of a friend.The lunch specials are pretty solid! I ordered the linguine with garlic and breadcrumbs. I enjoy really simple pastas, so if that's your kinda thing - I recommend it!My boyfriend ordered the squid ink campanelle. He enjoyed his, but it was a little too creamy for me. Again, depends on your palette. If you like creamy pastas, that might the one for you. :) I do think there are other spots that are probably tastier, but for the lunch special offerings, I give this 4 stars.",2,0,0,Belyn L.,"San Francisco, CA",785,42,211

My lovely mother & I split an arugula salad, spicy shrimp pasta, & steak entree (and obviously a couple bottles of wine).

Tried the frose, which was okay. Prices are definitely on the higher end and the portions are small as others have mentioned. Also they don't give out bread and olive oil which I find to be weird.

1.0,3/21/2019,"One of the worst dining experiences in recent memory! Arrived at 6:50p for a table of 2 - the place was mostly empty and we were seated quickly upstairs. After waiting 15 minutes, we finally got water. Another 30 minutes, and the waitress (Tricia) finally got our order. I saw that the other tables were being serviced regularly and immediately. A couple that sat down maybe 20 minutes after we had arrived had already received their appetizers and placed their order. We got our appetizer and realized we were the only table that didn't get bread for the table. I had to flag down several servers to ask for bread. Almost an hour into the dining experience and we had no one asking or checking on us. Finally at 7:50pm I flagged down the waitress (who was visibly ignoring us), and asked her where our main courses were as we had been waiting for an hour. She remarked that she was waiting for us to finish our appetizers before bringing our food !!??? I said we've been done for awhile. She never stopped by and asked if we were working on it etc. After another 30 min, we finally got our main courses. The food was mediocre at best and not worth the hassle of the night. We quickly got our bill and left immediately - food unfinished. A terrible experience for what we were hoping would be a nice weeknight date.

The atmosphere and service is great, very cozy with lots of candles. I got the special cacio e Pepe with kale and it was pretty bland, not as creamy as I expected as well as the kale was very salty.

4.0,3/9/2019,"I came here for the  first time in a while.I already knew here is nice interior decor and tasty and good service.Therefore I brought my client for dinner  at 6:30 PMIt was quiet and less people ( absolutely comfy)Nobody bring menu nor attention for a while( maybe it just opened and bit hectic ?)Meanwhile, a guy looks like a manager brought  menu and explained  special menu of the day "" Veal bolognese  white sauce pasta "" 1 st waiter came to take an orderAnd he suggested  sone veggies and meat, also he gave us some idea to order. Then we order Brussels sprout and Meat ball as starter. Both was really good!We were still thinking about main meal and see how much room left with our stomach ..So we decided one pasta for share. 2nd waiter come ( different from 1 st waiter) Finally took out order ""today's special pasta"" $24When the pasta  came , it looked  bit meat sauce ( not white sauce) but  lots of cheese on it, I wasn't sure yet.After while , we realized it was  totally different from the special menu that we were explained..I try to ask them but I couldn't do that since my client already started eating and I didn't want to get in trouble and her to be worried.  I was wondering if I misunderstood his explanation of the menu,  but the special pasta  would be same as $24. Or so. After all, we figure out The pasta was "" lobster tomato sauce $33 on the bill Huge difference  from "" veal white sauce $24 I claimed  the guy ( manager ?) who explain today's special to wrong order, even though  we completely finished eating . But , We thought today's special was  $24  but they charge us $33 for it! That doesn't make sense to me. Besides  the waiter who took our order didn't know exactly Today's special, neither confirmed with us.I guess he just brought most expensive pasta aka ""special pasta"" The manager apologized us the confusion and could weave $10 from the bill.

4.0,3/8/2019,"Went to this place with my sister and friend. The food was good but expensive with somewhat small portions for how much they cost. We started with the meatballs appetizer - those were excellent. They have an excellent red sauce recipe. I got the house-made pasta special for my entree- it was just okay.  Their pesto sauce was  bland and over compensated by Parmesan cheese, however the house made pasta had a perfect texture so it saved the dish.

However, it's like the safety restaurant of the area: this is where you go when the other restaurants are busy. The food is tasty, but the price doesn't match the value.

5.0,2/18/2019,"I knew I wanted squid ink pasta and that NYC would be the perfect place to find it.  I sought out a place that was near Union Square, open late, and had a decently-priced menu.  I walked in on Sunday night expecting not much of a crowd, but this placed was packed to the gills.  I opted for bar seating, and asked for a wine recommendation with my cauliflower appetizer and squid ink Campanelle crab pasta.  The white wine (unsure of the varietal) was a great pick by the bartender.  The cauliflower and pasta both had cream sauces, which was a miss on my end--I should have opted for a lighter app or pasta.  I was also surprised to see a squid ink pasta dressed w/cream sauce, but I figured I would try something new.  The cauliflower was cacio pepe style with the perfect amount of onion, and the squid ink pasta was perfectly al dente.  Great texture, though they could have been a little more generous on the crab meat.  What made the pasta for me though was the slivers of habanero pepper, which added a subtle bite to an otherwise understated dish.  Despite the heaviness of the dishes, I absolutely loved the vibe of Bar Primi.  It was diverse, full of couples, single people, wingmen looking out for each other, and single women reveling in their single lady-hood.  The scene is great w/o being pretentious, and I'd be confident returning by myself to enjoy a glass of wine on a very busy night.  Stars for being open late.",0,0,0,Crystal C.,"San Francisco, CA",44,162,44

4.0,2/16/2019,"Went here on a Friday with an early reservation at 6:30. The service was friendly and fast. The inside was very cute, rustic with hanging lights. The seating was intimate, I'm glad I was not on a first day since we were sitting in a corner table basically on top of each other in the upstairs section. Highly recommend you start with the burrata and the stuffed meatballs, the portions are small so we were glad we ordered two items for two people to share. The focaccia bread that came with burrata was amazing! I asked for more focaccia to soak up the remainder of the burrata and peppers and the waiter gladly and quickly brought me some more about two minutes after I asked. My boyfriend loved the Italian Old Fashioned cocktail. We both cleaned our entree pasta dishes - I don't think you can go wrong with any pasta dish. The portion looked small, but I walked out of their incredibly full. The pasta was al dente and not overly salty. Unfortunately we were too full to order dessert.

I love Locanda Verde and I know chef Andrew Carmellini will create a most casual restaurant with amazing pasta. I see on the restaurant week menu an offering for paccheri with white veal bolognese and piava. Heck, I don't know what piava is but I'm down if its from Chef Carmellini.I see the restaurant week lunch special has spaghetti with white veal bolognese?? (Don't forget the piava) Not a problem, I want to try the white veal bolognese, something different. The wine is substantial, I ordered a nice Italian red wine to get the dining started. I ordered the calamari fritti with spicy peppers. The peppers were amazing. The calamari was good, it wasn't tough but the coating looked dark. I still knocked it out.My pasta comes to me and man does it look good. My first bite? Creamy and dreamy. White veal bolognese, I'm tasting a lot of cream sauce, the freshly made pasta makes this dish wonderful. Where's the piava?! I wanted to ask for red pepper flakes but I didn't want to create a faux pas my first time dining here. I would have loved to try the paccheri with regular red bolognese.

I don't know about y'all but how do you guys eat a $21.75 pasta and think that's OK? Y'all are bougie up in here. While I agree the kale, pancetta, poached egg and pasta had a great flavor balance it just wasn't worth the deep price. Is it filling? HELL yeah!And for you kale haters, it's actually pretty good in here. It adds that vegetable balance to this super decadent bowl of cream, cheese and fat. So would I recommend?

For an italian restaurant, they don't even give out bread baskets? Ok...nevermind, we order rice balls. The rice balls were probably my favorite part of the meal. Fried to perfection, crisp, and served with yummy sauce - all a win.Next up, my friend and I chose to split two pastas - spaghetti carbonara & lamb ragu. This is where I started to question the meal. The carbonara was OK but really just typical, nothing too special about it. The lamb ragu was good but the lamb was worked into the sauce, there weren't even chunks of lamb!3 stars for ambiance, good wine, and good rice balls.

1.0,10/28/2018,Went here on a Sunday night with a group to celebrate a special birthday and had a very unpleasant and unnecessarily long dining experience. It was a larger group (10) which I guess was confusing because our wait staff messed everything we ordered up repeatedly. It took them 4 trips to the table to get the correct food on the table because they sent all the wrong dishes and the runners didn't know what they had in their hands. Then because we were repeatedly sent the wrong food our bill had to be redone several times as well. We had a vegan and someone with a dairy allergy at the table and both of them had entrees with cheese placed in front of them multiple times. One of my vegetarian friends was assured she received the correct entree but it ended up having meat in it. I do feel slightly bad giving this place a bad review because the food is amazing and at the end the main woman serving us was trying her best but the experiences soured what should've been a very celebratory meal and made it a 3+ hour long affair on a Sunday night when we all had work the next day.

1.0,9/25/2018,"Probably one of the biggest disappointments and rip offs I've purchased on grub hub. The picture I attached is YOUR version of lamb bucatini amatriciana. First, there was NO lamb in that ragu sauce; only flakes here and there (notice this sauce looks like a pomodoro than a hearty lamb ragu) Secondly, you overcooked the pasta which in Bucatini is terrible as the noodles get slimy and because they are large hollow noodles, the texture is nauseating.

3.0,9/14/2018,"Best thing about this was getting seated and served quickly. We had gone to a gallery opening two doors over and had 40 mins to eat and dash, and this trendy stalwart did not disappoint. It did however fall short in delivering something memorable for the hefty price tag. The Brussels sprouts were done well - perfectly charred and softened w just enough olive oil - but the rigatoni was very ordinary and carried an overload of cheese and cream. In general, did not live up to the hype.",0,0,0,Angel C.,"London, United Kingdom",263,630,2

5.0,8/24/2018,this place was easy to get a reservation at on a thursday night just because the place is big. there's outdoor seating and 2 levels of indoor seating based on what you're going for. read a lot of reviews about bad service but our waiter was lovely and i never had a half-empty water glass. the food was very good and the portion sizes didn't make me feel uncomfortably full. will definitely be back!,1,0,1,Jennifer T.,"Short Hills, NJ",295,165,17

3.0,8/17/2018,"This place was... fine. Overall thought it was way too overpriced for the quality of food. Think this is just another trendy establishment but overall nothing that excited me or stood out to me (other than the absurdly high prices). Four of us came with a reservation on a weeknight and were able to be seated right away though the service was a little slow throughout the night. We ordered the burrata and stuffed meatballs as apps, and all of us got a different pasta: spinach fusilli, orecchiette, fiore di carciofi, and the squid ink campanelle. The squid ink for sure stole the night - it was delightful and just the right amount of salty. I thought the burrata was a little small and way too covered in peppers. The stuffed meatballs were pretty good too, though nothing about it stood out to me. I didn't love the spinach fusilli or the orecchiette -- again, theme of the night seems to be ""it was fine"" so they weren't bad dishes but again probably not worth the high price tag for a normal pasta dish. I didn't try the fiore di cariofi because I'm not a huge fan of artichoke but my friends enjoyed it though they said it also seemed too small of a portion.  My friends were actually still pretty hungry after and we decided to get ice cream somewhere else, but that was pretty telling to me considering how much our total bill came out to be.

The ambiance in the restaurant is really nice and is great for dates or a nice dinner with friends. I personally was not a huge fan of the food though. I ordered the linguini (~$17), which was basically just a garlic pasta with breadcrumbs. For what it was, I thought that it was a little overpriced and tasted very average. There was just a lot of butter/oil at the bottom of my dish and I got bored with the dish mid way, which never happens when I eat pasta!!! The portions also weren't very large.

The servers were kind and attentive, but let us take our time with our meal. The atmosphere was bright and open, but cozy. It was busy, but not packed so our group had plenty of room to spread out.We all ordered our own entrees including the almond granola, funghi scramble, breakfast spaghetti, and penne. Each entree was enough food for one hungry person. While I'm typically a breakfast person at brunch, the pastas were the winners here. The breakfast spaghetti had the breakfast tastes of pancetta and egg on top of a delicious pasta. The penne was just a really well done pasta! I think that would be my dish of choice if I were to return.Overall, Bar Primi is a great place for a brunch reservation, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there.",0,0,0,Emitom H.,"Dallas, TX",89,146,61

It tasted like a mix of frozen red and white boxed wine. I went with 3 people and none of us could finish and we are by no means wine snobs. When we clearly weren't drinking the frose at the bar they didn't check in and let us tab out with nearly full glasses.

It was good but given the price point, it would have been to have the glass filled at least half way. We ordered stuffed meatballs and burrata cremosa. They were both very good especially the stuffed meatballs, the burrata was good, it had a little too much pepper in my opinion. As for the entrees we ordered the linguine, orecchiette, and the fiore di carciofi. All three pasta dishes were fantastic however the portion size is smaller than other Italian restaurants near by. We ordered extra focaccia and bread with olive oil, the bread was dry and hard but ok after dipping it into the left over sauces in the pasta dishes. We ended with the tiramisu, it was ok way too strong for me and its my go to dessert everywhere.

We noticed that the table next to us received bread but we were not served that which is weird considering we got meatballs. The food arrived within 6 minutes of ordering and everything was piping hot. Once we finished (less than 20 minutes) our server came over another 2 times within 10 minutes to get us to order more. We finally decided to share a spaghetti dish as we already had 3 apps + drinks and the dishes looked big. When we ordered the dish our server said ""really? That's it?"" We said yes.

The mozzarella was good but the portion was small-stuffed meatballs: these were great and the sauce was amazing-fiore di carciofi: I didn't love this dish but my husband loved it. It's a small portion so you may want to get an appetizer if you just plan on ordering this-squid ink pasta: this was our least favorite dish. The crab just made the dish taste very fishy.

1.0,4/11/2018,"This place charges you 16.50 for orecchiette with broccoli and sausage (for the price and a Michelin mention one can be forgiven for expecting cime di rapa), but then it comes swimming in about 100ml of oil (see pictures)! This is unacceptable, but we were so hungry we ate it. The campanelle nere with a cheesy yet hot-peppery crab-sauce for 20 dollars were equally disappointing, especially as they rested on a bed of aforementioned cheese (?) sauce (see pictures). I'm not necessarily a purist about mixing fish with cheese, but this just didn't work and the excessive buildup of sauce was frankly off-putting. The best was the glass of Lugana, probably because it definitely didn't come from their kitchen.

The rice balls usually come out as 3 pieces, but the waiter asked us if we wanted to add an additional piece so everyone in our party could have one. Both appetizers were amazing and I would go back to Bar Primi just for those appetizers. For the main, I got the bucatini, which was a dish of tube-like spaghetti noodles with lamb and tomato sauce. The noodles were pretty fun to eat, but the sauce was way too salty. I was sick with a cold at the time so my tastebuds were a little dulled, but all I could taste was the saltiness.

The restaurant was dimly lit with a city-cozy ambiance- perfect for enjoying a bottle of wine (and then some). Service was nice and food was amazing. Who doesn't love bowls of noodles? To finish it all off, we had a super fun desert- some type of big ice cream sundae with Nutella (3 spoons please!!). Bar Primi was recommended to me by a friend who is local to the area.

SO delicious and perfectly cooked. Just a warning that the Squid Ink Campanelle is a little spicy, but still amazing. For an appetizer, we tried the popular Ricotta Crostino; I would only recommend this if you love ricotta, otherwise it was too rich and heavy.

3.0,1/17/2018,"I've both ordered from Bar Primi online and visited the restaurant in person, which had a nice trendy ambiance to it. On a Thursday night, there were a lot of young adults and groups of friends, which had a fun atmosphere to it. The pasta dishes are pretty good, but I found them to be a bit overvalued for the price point. I've tried a variety of Bar Primi's pasta dishes, including the garlic linguine, spaghetti pomodoro, spaghetti and clams, and the squid ink campanelle. I found that while all of the dishes are decently good, they lacked the body of flavor that I would expect from Italian dishes, especially for something so rich as pasta. I'm not sure if it's anything about the pasta noodles themselves or the sauces, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend this restaurant for food. Overall, the pasta dishes are okay, but nothing spectacular. I will probably opt out of ordering from here again due to the quality of other Italian restaurants in the city; however, Bar Primi was a fun place to visit and grab drinks. Perhaps I'll come here for happy hour vs for dinner if I come again? More of a trendy hot spot vs foodie hot spot.",0,0,0,Jane R.,"Boston, MA",538,51,36
3.0,1/16/2018,"This place is very cute and in a nice area. I came once in the summer for froze' and sat outside which was lovely. Today, however, the rude hostesses were the most memorable thing about the evening. I arrived 15 minutes early for my 6:30 reservation to a next-to-empty restaurant. They said they could seat me ""in a couple minutes"" and to wait by the bar. My biggest pet peeve at any restaurant is when you are standing in front of someone and clearly looking at them, and they pretend you are not there. When my 6:30 reservation time rolled around, I relocated to stand in front of the hostess desk, where they proceeded to act like I didn't exist for another 5 minutes, in addition to the previous 15 of them acting like they couldn't see me, until I finally asked if I could please be seated. The waitress was incredibly rude and made it seem like a huge inconvenience that I wanted to be seated before my friend arrived. I told her if there was an issue about a full party not being here, she could have told me before I stood around for 20 minutes and I would have done something else with that time. I saw the manager notice me standing around that whole time and he never said anything or asked if he could help either - again, ignoring someone staring right at you and lowering the bar for customer service everywhere. The food was decent, but not good enough to cancel out the rudeness of the staff. Rice balls and Brussels sprouts were the standout - don't order the cauliflower.",1,0,0,Jamie S.,"New York, NY",0,40,0
2.0,1/14/2018,"I came to Bar Primi with 3 friends for brunch on a Saturday afternoon. All in all, I had an okay time and the food was good, but there were a few things that irked me the wrong way. I made a reservation on OpenTable and they sat us 15 minutes past our quote time (which usually isn't that bad for a NYC restaurant), but when I saw multiple vacant tables around the restaurant, it kinda bugged me. We sat down and ordered our drinks & food at the same time. My 2 friends and I ordered the Diamante ($14), and my other friend ordered the Bloody Mary ($14). For food, our dishes included the breakfast spaghetti ($19), linguine ($13), and rigatoni alla Norma ($17.50). Annoyingly enough, our food came out within minutes, before our drinks did. We mentioned to our server that we didn't even have our drinks, but we had hot food in front of us. Our server, Frank, didn't seem phased by it. I wanted to chat and catch-up with friends, but our food was rushed out to us and it tasted that way. We felt super rushed. It was honestly the quickest brunch ever.For the taste, my linguine was too garlicky and watery. I tried the other two dishes and I enjoyed them better. I would recommend the breakfast spaghetti. The rigatoni was good, but there was barely any eggplant in it. Also, since our meal was so fast we were thinking of getting a dessert. But, our waiter just dropped the check off without asking if we were done with our meal or if we wanted anything else. It was quite rude. I feel like they just wanted us out of there to sit the next table down. For the price of the food and the service we received, I do not think it is worth returning.

The waiter got in a dispute with the people next to use because they decided they weren't going to eat food and just grab a drink instead and forced them to close their tab and move to the bar.

3.0,11/14/2017,"Bar Primi is overall a popular restaurant but not a very renowned brunch spot. We made a reservation for Saturday brunch, but it seems like any walk-in would've worked just fine. Didn't take long for a waiter to wander toward our table and take our order.The food was decent, but for the price Bar Primi offers a pretty standard (or average) brunch experience. We were placed next to a large communal table which was apparently hosting a fraternity reunion, and the entire time we had to attempt to ignore the noise. The waiter took orders from them much more frequently -- which is understandable because they all ordered bottomless mimosa while we had tap water -- but ultimately it doesn't feel good to be left out. Food took a while too, but I'm glad it was hot and fresh at least.Because this is a pasta place we opted to what they did best (spaghetti) and the baked egg. They were pretty solid! Their pasta was tingly and soaked in a dish my chef friend couldn't figure out what it was made off, and the baked egg was pretty generous with cheese. But then again, with a tiramisu in the end, the total rounded up close to 50 dollars, which is really not cool considering it's supposed to be a light brunch.The fact that there's little wait is a nice plus. I can see this being a backup option if we had no luck lining up for other spots around -- and have some extra cash to spare.",0,0,0,Wayne C.,"New York, NY",165,84,61

1.0,10/30/2017,"First they tried to seat my group of five in a table clearly meant for 4 (3 were supposed to squish in at the booth), with the middle plate over two separate, uneven tables. After asking for a different table, we waited 15 minutes for them to reset. Our waitress was extremely soft-spoken, to the point that only one person at our table could hear her because she was speaking directly in my friend's ear, who then had to relay all information to the rest of the table. It was very loud in the restaurant, but still. Also, it was a humid evening - there was a/c on, but you could barely feel it with their huge windows and doors wide open. I am usually cold, but was sweating throughout the entire dinner. An additional service issue: when our waitress asked for our orders, we were only ready for drinks and appetizers. She said she would come back for the rest. We couldn't get her attention until well after we had finished the appetizers, so we had to wait a very long time for our entrees, and consequently to get out of that sweat box where we could barely hear one another.

I had the beet salad with a pistachio pesto and ricotta. SUBLIME. I also had the stuffed meatballs (there was not that much cheese inside) in a delightful, low oil red sauce. Flavorful. The men next to us both ordered pasta. The spinach fusili with sage looked and smelled heavenly (I don't do veal, but if you do, it's a huge portion for 22 dollars). The bucatini his friend ordered looked equally good. I wanted to try every single pasta on the menu. Squid ink with crab and a crema of some sort. Now that I know where it is, I will definitely go back for the squid ink.

Not terrible but when are meatballs ever terrible.  They just were a little too hard and dry and the small amount of cheese inside didn't really makeup for that.  They do come in a very nice tomato sauce however.  The tiramisu was a great way to end the meal.  We sat downstairs which is fine but upstairs looks much nicer.  This area of the Bowery seems conducive these days to obnoxious crowds and corporate impersonality but Bar Primi seems to do a fine job pushing against that tide.,1,1,1,Leonard F.,"Queens, NY",17,195,0
4.0,7/24/2017,"Hit this place up for lunch thanks to restaurant week, and left wanting more. The place was cute, but empty for lunch time. Ordered the calamari fritti, garganelli, and gelato as my three courses. The calamari was spectacular and the sauce it came with was great! The main dish was a little disappointing, as it was very reminiscent of an upscale beefaroni. The portion was huge, so I was glad I was able to take some home with me. The gelato was pistachio flavored, and it was superb. Along side dinner, I had the frosè, which was very refreshing! All and all a good meal worth the restaurant week lunch price, I just wish the pasta dish was a little bit better.",0,0,0,Kasia K.,"Queens, NY",280,10,9
5.0,7/21/2017,"Bar Primi- Worth the hype? Yes.The bar was set very high for my trip to Bar Primi, as the restaurant has consistently topped every ""must go-to restaurant list"". Finally, a reservation opened up and it was my turn to be wined and dined by Bar Primi. The décor was of simple contemporary Italian style. The menu consisted of only a few items making my selection easy. The internet brought me to Primi for pasta and 'frose' and that is what I ordered. The 'frose' was not anything special, just frozen wine- but, so adorable and impossible NOT to take a picture. Why endure the painful wait for a Bar Primi reservation - THE PASTA.Having personally lived in Florence, Italy for a brief period of time- I put Primi on the map of highest quality Italian pasta dishes out there. The sauces, textures and presentations were off the charts. I was VERY upset when I finished my plate. I WILL be coming back and bringing my family.

We opted to sit outside since it was a nice day, but beware because there are a lot of flies. My friend and I both got the frosé. Literally tastes like frozen rosé, but I expected it to be sweeter. At $14 a glass, it was a good try, but not something I would order again. None of the appetizers looked that appealing, so we skipped to the pastas. I got the spaghetti with clams, which had a bit of a spice to it (?) but nonetheless it was good, though the clams were tiny. My friend got the linguine, which was also good, filled with butter and very garlic-y. Overall, a solid pasta spot that isn't too expensive.

4.0,7/14/2017,"Honestly, I'm shocked at how this restaurant only has 3.5 stars. I have to look back at the low ratings to see why. I went earlier this week with a group of girlfriends and LOVED everything we ordered. We started with the ricotta crostino with truffle honey and hazelnuts, the brussels sprouts with pepperoni (sounds kind of weird but the pepperoni was crispy!) and the tomato rice balls. The rice balls were probably my least favorite out of the three, but still delicious. GET THE CROSTINO. You'll thank me later. Another table had a really good looking salad, but my group was not into it. For my entree, I had the rigatoni carbonara...I've never ordered this before, usually just eat off of my friends plates because I try to be healthy, but when I asked the waitress what to order (I was stuck between three things), she said this was her favorite dish. She was right. IT WAS AMAZING. I wish I had it right now as I write this review at 10AM. Sadly, we didn't have room for dessert, but I need to go back for the nutella sundae. The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because I found it to be a bit overpriced. But, it's good for special occasions!",1,0,0,Danielle P.,"Yorkville, Manhattan, NY",1,11,0

My friend opted for the spaghetti & clams $23.00. The linguine was pretty good. They didn't offer cheese for our pastas, but it would've been better with cheese. The spaghetti with clams was a little spicy, which surprised us. There was a decent amount of clams in the dish, but again, would've been a bit better with cheese. We also ordered 2 cups of frosé ($14 a glass). A little on the pricer side but worth it for the experience.

Also requested an outdoor seating in the opentable request but had to wait at the bar until a table was available. I was skeptical of the frosè but it actually was my favorite part of the meal.  I was expecting it to be sweeter than I like but it actually has a very nice flavor with a dry finish. Their regular rosè from Sicily was also very nice as well.Bread and olive oil were both very good (a good sign in my book!) I had the breakfast spaghetti which, while beautiful to look at, was good but not amazing. I think Bar Pitti wins the pasta game for sure over this place, even cost wise. Service was average.

4.0,6/18/2017,"I've said it once & I'll say it again - I have low expectations for Italian food.  I'll go out for pasta, be brutally disappointed, and be annoyed at myself for thinking that I would be happy with anyone's sauce other than my grandma's / mom's.  Usually, when I go out for Italian, I'll stick to non-red sauces to help lessen the eventual, inevitable regret.For this reason, amongst a couple others, it took me a while to get to Bar Primi, where many of the dishes on the menu that appealed to me were tomato-based.   I made reservations on a Saturday night for brunch the following Sunday afternoon, at the request of a friend.  We arrived promptly at 1PM for our reservation.  The restaurant is pretty and bright inside and there is a cute little outdoor area (right on the street, though).  The hosts were super accommodating and sat us inside, upstairs, in a booth by the window.  The servers were great - very attentive.  We ordered a prosciutto scone to start and then broke the cardinal rule of dining out in NYC by ordering the same main course - the pomodoro baked eggs.The prosciutto scone was a nice starter, but the highlight of the dish was the butter served on the side.  It was a flavored butter with flakey sea salt on top.  The friend I was eating with held the butter while they cleared the plate so that the busser wouldn't take it away from us.  Yes, that good.  The pomodoro baked eggs - O.  M.  G.  Over medium eggs served with mozzarella, toasted bread, and a chunky, sweet tomato sauce that my mom would be proud of.  They are lucky I didn't eat the ceramic dish it was served on.  There was not one bite left on this plate when I was done with it.  The tomato sauce was the star of the dish; insanely fresh, perfectly sweet.  Cannot stop thinking about this.Total bill came to just over $40.  0 regrets.  Only 4 stars because I don't think that I can, in good faith, judge a restaurant entirely based on one dish and 1/8 of a scone, but I will definitely be back in eager anticipation of adding that final star.  Thanks, Bar Primi, for changing brunch for me forever- this is my favorite egg dish I've eaten in NYC to date.",3,0,2,Jenn P.,"Manhattan, NY",285,134,933
4.0,6/17/2017,"I was excited to try Bar Primi for a fun dinner out with my best friend, and for the most part I was not disappointed. Like every other twentysomething woman there, we both got the frose cocktail, and it was great! Because it's a frozen slushy, it seems like it would be really sweet, but it's actually not. It was refreshing and still strong enough, but the strawberry is a fun addition, and I'd definitely get it again. It was exactly the right drink to sip on a summer night, seated outside as we were!For an appetizer, we shared the stuffed meatballs. I'd say that's a misnomer: though they are filled with fontina, there's no more than a dime sized sphere of cheese inside, and the rest of the meatball was sort of dry. They were still tasty though.After much debate, I got the paccheri, which is like a wide, smooth rigatoni, with vodka sauce, eggplant, and provolone. My friend got the linguine with garlic, which is one of the dishes they're known for (and was the other pasta I was choosing between)! Both were excellent. The paccheri was similar to a pasta alla norma, and with the creamy tomato sauce, melted cheese, and eggplant, it was hearty and satisfying, and shredded basil was a delicious, fragrant addition. I might have preferred it with fresh mozzarella, but nonetheless, it was great. The garlic and bread crumb linguine my friend got was also tasty: simple, but done very well. If I go back, I'd get that one, just for some variety!The portions are a bit small but still plenty of food--just don't come here expecting a huge bowl of pasta you'll have trouble finishing.We then shared the Nutella sundae, which was good, but really not worth $12.

The frośe were good, we each had two glasses and we have to say it did us well. We both agreed we shall be back on a hot summer day to enjoy a few more.

Our favorite reorders are the Lamb Bucatini (so rich in the meaty lamb flavor with perfect al dente pasta everytime) the Fiore di Carciofi (which is by far the most interesting pasta dish I've ever had, almost an open ravioli swirled around itself and doused in a tasty can't get enough of it sauce) and the best dish I've had in recent memory, the Squid Ink Campanelle (velvety black squid ink noodles and this delicious cream sauce that while being so flavorful still remains light, fresh crab and a couple slices of pepper to top it all of with spice)We've also had the cavetelli and the stuffed meatballs, which are equally delicious, we just haven't been  back since our last meal to reorder them. We also never miss out on the cocktails, I love their sangria and my boyfriend always starts with the Paloma #7.I just can NOT sing their praises enough.

4.0,3/13/2017,"Bar Primi is one of my favorite places to get pasta- I often order delivery through Postmates/ Caviar as well! My most recent visit was on March 11th. I had a reservation at 9:30 pm but unfortunately, the restaurant was really backed up I ended up getting seated at 10:15. I was upset, but the hostess was not rude about this at all. One of the bartenders gave my party a free shot as well while we were waiting at the bar. What made up for all this experience was the manager. I unfortunately did not get her name but she was the most accommodating and friendly manager I have ever encountered at any restaurants. There are a lot of managers at restaurants who are rude and don't belong in the hospitality industry, but she was truly understanding and even sent over an entire bottle of wine. If not for her, I would have left Bar Primi very upset, as I was done eating dinner close to 11:30 pm when my reservation was for 9:30 pm.

I had the garlic linguine for my main which was good but a little bland, I enjoyed my boyfriends spaghetti more.

Our waiter was super nice, and helped us navigate the menu to make the most out of our experience. As for the food:Ricotta Crostino- Must get. The house made ricotta just melts, and the truffle honey and hazelnuts add a sweetness that really compliments the cheese.Burrata Cremosa- Was good, but the highlight was the roasted red and yellow peppers. The savory peppers and salty bread served with it was cut nicely with the burrata.Bucatini- As most reviews say- delicious.Special of the night was grilled octopus- I don't know how it's supposed to taste since it was the first time I tried octopus, but it was definitely grilled to perfection.",0,0,0,Angela G.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",0,8,0

2.0,2/21/2017,"Bar Primi has been on my list for quite some time.  I have frequented all of andrew Carmellini's restaurants and the food is always great. Plus the restaurant is always having food bloggers post their meals on Instagram. They had a great brunch menu with lots of different options. I had the meatball polenta with over easy eggs. It was delicious. Not life changing but delicious. So why I am giving the restaurant 2 stars:- a friend in our party also ordered the meatballs. Same exact order but it showed up 10 minutes after mine. Did not make any sense. Also meant that the rest of our party's food had cooled down- service prior to the bill was fine. Not amazing but not bad. It took a major turn downhill when she came over at some point and flipped the bill over so we wld know once again that the bill was there. We settled up when I finished my coffee. It went downhill when the hostess or manager come over to the table to tell us she needed the table. I know this happens but (a) was not apologetic about it, (b) she didn't tell us she needed the table when we were seated (c) we had not even been at the restaurant for 90 minutes after ordering a bottle of wine, brunch entrees and then a coffee (rather than dessert). Rude rude rude. What was worst was that there were so many empty seats at the big communal table, lots of bar stools and no one was being seated upstairs. There are so many solid Italian restaurants in the city. And in the case of Bar Primi, there are so many a block away incl Gemma, Il Buco etc Sometimes the only reason to choose one over the other is because service makes you feel  appreciated. Definitely not how one felt at Bar Primi. Bar Primi needs to get their front of their house sorted. I certainly will not be going back.",0,0,0,Carol L.,"New York, NY",0,19,0
4.0,2/20/2017,"My friends and I came here for my birthday dinner on a Sunday night. We had a 730pm reservation but experienced about a 25 minute wait time. We were able to grab seats at the bar until our table was ready. Once our table was ready someone came to get us and showed us upstairs. The restaurant has a nice intimate vibe, and is great for a group or just a party of two. Our server came over and offered us flat or sparkling water and gave us menus. The menu selection isn't huge, but does have great selections in the appetizer and pasta department. We all ordered a round of drinks, I tried both of of the frose's but I have to say the winter frose was better. The regular frose tasted kind of sour, it was definitely not me or my friends preference. As appetizers we tried the rice balls which sat ontop of a pesto sauce, the stuffed meat balls, and the prosciutto with buffalo mozzarella. I didn't have the prosciutto but everything else was amazing. The pesto sauce that came with the rice balls was SO good, I could of ate a plate of pasta bathed in that pesto sauce. As entrees I got the cavatelli bolonese which was recommended by the server. Two of my friends got the short rib ravioli, another two got the squid ink campanelle and another got the NY strip steak. My meal (cavatelli) and my friends NY strip was delicious. I was so torn between getting the short rib ravioli and the cavatelli but I'm definitely happy I got the cavatelli, because it was so much better than the ravioli. The squid ink campanelle was really not good in my opinion, and not worth the price. After dinner they gave us a menu of desserts and after dinner drinks. They did come over with a cannoli panna cotta and begin to sing happy birthday but than walked away in the middle of it, which was a bit awkward. Overall the experience was good, our server was very attentive, and  the food was good. I'm happy I finally experienced Bar Primi and I'll definitely come back, maybe for brunch the next time.",5,2,4,Jessica R.,"Brooklyn, NY",169,216,594

3.0,2/8/2017,"We came because they stay open till 11pm and we once again waited way too long to make dinner plans. Our waitress was the highlight of our meal. She was so friendly and pleasant, and gave mouthwatering descriptions of the food that really helped us learn a little more about what we were ordering. They were also very nice about us lingering as the last table and did not ask us to leave until we were absolutely done. The food itself didn't really do it for us though. The tomato arancini is served in a pesto sauce and despite having pesto, tomatoes and rice could have used something else.They weren't bad, just sort of one note. My favorite item of the night was crispy fried pink shrimp in a Fra Diavolo sauce. The shrimp were super tender and the sauce was delicious with just a little hint of spice- you'll definitely need extra! The short rib ravioli comes in a vodka sauce that is very watered down. The Bucatini in a lamb sauce suffered the same problem- in both dishes the sauce wasn't sticking to the pasta. More sauce may have helped, but I think both could have been thickened up considerably. The flavors of the ravioli were also so gentle and mild...for a dish with such a rich ingredient list I expected something richer, heavier, heartier, more flavorful. They played hiphop throughout the meal...I don't understand who goes to an Italian dinner expecting to hear Biggie, but maybe I'm just the odd one out. In the end I don't think this place is for me but the service was absolutely impeccable,",3,3,1,Luci B.,"Queens, NY",149,1401,3214

We started with the meatballs that had a bacon undertone which were amazing. Then we had the garganelli and breakfast pasta. No complaints aside from portions.  On the other hand (likely because our server Mike? was awesome) our glasses were always full - we were even talked into just getting a bottle of rosé.

3.0,2/3/2017,"This place was on my bucket list for a while because of some friends' recommendations so I came with my girlfriend when we were in the area.First and foremost, I believe that the food deserved at least 4 stars. I ordered the Squid Ink Campanelle which was excellent. The pasta had a nice al dente bite to it while the garlic crema provided a wonderful creaminess to it. However, I felt that their Linguine was by far the better dish. The garlic, crushed red pepper, oil, and parsley was absolutely amazing while the breadcrumbs gave a nice texture to the dish. The pasta also had a nice bite to it and was not too oily.Unfortunately, while this is a rare occurrence for me, I took off an additional star because of the service. While the waitress herself was kind, the frequency in which she came by our table was awfully low. Purely based on my suspicions, I felt that she immediately became disinterested in our table when we said we did not want to order any drinks. Note that we arrived around 4-5 PM and were probably one of the few tables without a drink in hand, marking us a low priority table.Anyways, aside from the service, the food was absolutely wonderful.

5.0,1/31/2017,"In our NY experience we were told about this Italian spot we ""had to try."" The way they spoke about this place was a""MUST try"" on our visit to the Big Apple. I am always a little apprehensive when places are talked up because I don't want to be disappointed and go back to the referral with the bad news. Thankfully, this place did not disappoint.We walked in from the cold ny temperatures with tons of layers & dead phones. Immediately we were sat and asked about charges, immediately the hostess accommodated. We were greeted shortly thereafter by our waitress which offered water and some time to look over the menu. Not being exactly sure what we were in the mood we were seeking suggestions. Anays, (the manager I believe) came over and explained Bar Primi popular items as well as what would pair best with what we are drinking. I loved that. We started with the Stuffed Meatballs, Sicilian Tomato Rice Balls in Basil Pesto as well as the the Fiore di Carciofi (as suggested to try something out of our comfort zone). Boy was I glad we did. The meatballs were in a tasty marinera but these were more for my daughter at the table. You can't go wrong with meatballs for a kid. I was worried about the rice balls but the pairing with basil pesto made these just perfect..if i could spread the basil pesto on anything I would. The Fiore de Carciofi was in a light sauce that just made it mouthwatering, not thinking I would like it I kind of nibbled at first but ended up eating most of it on my own..I can be greedy like that when I like something a lot. I opted for the Cavetelli & my friend stuck with the Spaghetti & Meatballs. We were not disappointed. I shared mine with my five-year-old which was more than enough for us two. When a child that is 5 eats up something without complaining & then compliments it, you know it's good. My friend ate up all the spaghetti & meatballs and commented on how tasty the sauce was and succulent the meatballs were. I was having a red wine that was suggested and my friend sipped on a white. I wish I could remember the name because I absolutely loved it. We couldn't leave without desert so we ordered the traditional Tiramisu. I try tiramisu everywhere & this was honestly like a piece of heaven. It was light and fluffy..all I have to say is if you make your way to Bar Primi do not leave without ordering the tiramisu, even if it is to go..you won't regret it. All I have to say is thank you for making this dining experience a great one! It was my birthday weekend and I enjoyed every minute of this dinner :) the service was amazing.

After much hype and an even longer wait, we were finally able to try out this charming pasta shop. The restaurant's popular frosé drink provided a tasty backdrop to our evening while we excitedly crowded over our menus. The Sicilian tomato rice balls with pesto sauce, the starter, was a compact portion of delicious arancini that only furthered our anticipation for the restaurant's signature dishes - the primi piatti.Fiore di carciofi, one of Bar Primi's most highly regarded pastas, came served with prosciutto and pecorino cheese and was without doubt superb in its fine, rich taste. However the portion was so unsatisfyingly small (something rather uncommon for a restaurant that deems itself a ""true"" Italian establishment) that I couldn't help but feel cheated out of my experience.

Our server had many recommendations and was very attentive. We had the melted mozzarella appetizer and it was super flavorful and cheesy and delicious, came with the most delicious crusty bread. As the main we I had the pasta carbonara which was the most delicious I have had. The pasta was perfect cooked and it had lots of (bacon, it wasn't quite bacon but don't remember what it was called) but it was perfectly salty and swiney. It also had an ingredient i never had in a carbonara before, cabbage! And it was perfect! It added crunchiness and a nice flavor to the dish.

2.0,11/27/2016,"Long story short: the food is quite good, the place is very cute, but the service is horrific.Went there last night with a few friends - we were there within 5 min of our 9pm reservation. The hostesses asked us to wait by the bar for our table to be ready - but there was no room at the bar to wait without being bumped and jostled by other patrons/servers. We moved back to the entrance and were kept waiting for over 30 minutes. The hostesses appeared annoyed with us for standing there but there was literally nowhere else for us to go.When we were finally seated, the service was incredibly slow. By 10pm we had still not even ordered our appetizers. My friend and I had the linguine entree, which was really amazing. I also really enjoyed the fall frose.  It's really sad that the service was so bad, because at this point I can't justify going back no matter how good the food was.

I could have had that as dessert in the same meal and been really happy! I ordered the cavatelli and loved it. It was a good amount of food for one and it was layered with flavor.

We had a prime seat next to the window - I can definitely see how this is the spot during summer when there's outdoor seating.Frose was not too sweet and was stronger than I expected. My friend's Chardonnay almost knocked her out. Food-wise, I had some sort of butternut squash pasta which in hindsight, I should have just chosen one of the classics. I wasn't terribly hungry which is why I skipped the starters, and if I knew the frose was going to be that strong, I would've went all out.Tiramisu was so bomb. My friend is getting married in two weeks and she still couldn't put her fork down. It's kind of scene-y with a lot of friend dates or attractive couples, and it gets LOUD at around 8-ish.

Not too sweet just the perfect balance of citrus and bitterness of the blood orange and the cappeletti. For just $14 a pop you MIGHT be getting a higher end liquor but in the end it is not worth the price, frozen drinks are mostly just ice and if anything these should be no more than $9.Great service, the girls behind the bar made sure our glasses of water was always full and that if we needed anything to let them know and we had small talk with them as well. You hardly get that nowadays; a lot of bartenders just get your order and go on to the next customer or just completely ignore you and stay on their phones.

We waited 30 mins and nobody came to take our order. I had to go find someone inside to come out and help us. We had 4 or so different people help us throughout our meal and were given 0 names or introductions. Not even sure who our actual server was. Never had specials read if there were any. Food took forever. Lady at the table to our right never got her coffee and had to have it taken off the bill. If I were the owner or manager of this establishment this would be unacceptable.

Had to try the Frosé because I had seen it on social media so much. It's okay... I prefer regular rosé better haha. It does taste like rosé but is kind of weird because it's not as sweet as you would expect from a frozen slushie looking thing. For an appetizer we shared the kale salad. It was great. Then my sister and I shared two pastas- the rigatoni with bacon and corn and the fiore di carciofi with prosciutto. Both were great but we preferred the rigatoni. Highly recommend everyone try!!! Portions are decent but not large. Therefore can seem a bit pricey but not outrageous. We weren't completely full, so we ordered a cheese course for dessert. Two cheeses- pecorino and Le tur - for $14. Pecorino was okay, Le tur was a really great soft cheese. We also wanted some prosciutto but didn't want to pay the full $20 appetizer price, so we asked for half the portion for half the price and got it, which was very nice. We definitely got enough prosciutto. Finally, we also shared a bottle of white wine. Can't remember which one but we wanted something like a Sauvignon blanc. It was great. Really unique and memorable compared to what I've ever tasted before. Overall our bill came out to over $100pp for shared salad, entree, wine, Frosé, cheese and prosciutto.

The pancakes were one of the best I had in the city (!!!) and the baked eggs were cooked to perfection. We were licking the plates by the end. Also, if you are a carb lover and an egg lover, AND a bacon lover--you're in for a treat, they have this thing called breakfast spaghetti with all three (pancetta isn't bacon, but you know. even better) and it is as delicious as the afternoon siesta it'll give you for the rest of the afternoon.

It's a pretty drink, a very instagrammable, let me show my friends & the world this drink - but that's all it is. It's frozen wine, topped with a strawberry. For $14, I thought it was a total rip off because the drink was served in a small wine glass and doesn't liquid expand when frozen?? I guess I should have expected as much as this place is $$$ on Yelp. Aside from price and size, the drink is OK. It's a sweet, cold treat for summer.For food we ordered the san daniele prosciutto served with summer melon, which was soo good. I love procsciutto with melon - awesome choice for appetizer if you're with friends. As entrees we tried the lamb bucatini, squid ink campanelle, and something else but I already forgot.

Since Bar Primi started the Frose craze on social media my friends and I decided we had to try. While many bars and restaurants  have Frose in NYC, I had watched a video on how Bar Primi makes its Frose - with no extra sugar added. I liked this because many restaurants that serve frozen drinks pack on the calories and douse their drinks with sugar - however Bar Primi does nothing of the sort. Our Froses were authentic and not too sweet - exceeding expectations. Bar Primi is well known, and that's why I was surprised at how slow the service was - and the reason for my three stars. I would have loved to give more, but just cannot without how slow the service became as the night progressed.While the food was decent (we decided to order despite really only coming in for the Frose) once it became crowded, our waitress ignored us. We had to ask for a second round of drinks three times, and our check twice. It was worth it for the Instagram picture (as my friend said), but otherwise with how slow it was, I don't know if I would return.",1,0,0,Colleen N.,"New York, NY",2,129,39

1.0,8/12/2016,"I went here on a Friday afternoon (2:30ish), and to my surprise the place was packed. My friend and I left our name and number with the hostess. And was told the wait would be 45 mins. My friend and I went to wait at the bar which was 3 rows deep of people. Waited 15 mins for the for a seat to open up, then waited another 15 mins for the bartender acknowledge us. The bartender was obviously flustered and, one guy for 30 ppl waiting for drinks is not cool, they need to invest in setting up two bartenders at this place. We ordered the Frozé, which is only one third of a class filled. It was ok, I wouldn't say it's worth the wait... We waiting again for the bartender to come by for way too long, we wanted to order a dessert. I grew frustrated and went to the hostess and said why haven't they called us for a table yet since many tables have opened up. She said ""oh, I saw you got a seat at the bar so I didn't call you"" -_- I told her we want a table to eat dessert and we are getting horrible service at the bar, she said ""I'm so sorry about the service, but I can't sit you at a table if you are only eating dessert."" (Wtf??) I'm like fine can I get a menu then... I went back to the bar we ordered the gelato that was good, nothing special. Then left. In a nut shell, horrible service.

3.0,8/10/2016,"My time here was just okay. There really isn't anything that is too spectacular about Bar Primi's brunch menu. I came on an early Saturday afternoon around 2 pm. My reservation was set for 1:30 pm, and I was running late. Even though I showed up late, they still were able to accommodate me and my two girlfriends. I asked to be seated outside, and without hesitation, the sweet and friendly hostess grabbed her menus and led us to the outdoor dining area which is located right on the corner of Bowery and 1st. But we came for one thing, and one thing only...  F R O S E ! !AMBIANCE: I didn't get to spend too much time indoors, but the dining area has bit of a modern but rustic aesthetic to it. We sat outside since it was warm and sunny and everyone just happens to love the smell of carbon monoxide and rambling tourist. The small garden that encompasses guests make a pretty scene as your sipping your mimosa.DRINKS: Okay as I mentioned previously, we came just for the Frose, a new craze that happened to hit BuzzFeed and soon enough all of our FaceBook timelines. The moment I seen the slushy alcoholic potion being poured into a champagne glass, I was sold! Most of the drinks are NYC priced ($14 and up). The Frose was okay, it made a cute Boomerang video post for Instagram, but there wasn't anything too special about it. After round one, we ended up switching the champs for spirits and opted for the Diamonte which was composed of vodka, Prosecco, passion fruit, and lemon. This drink was amazing!FOOD: The food selection was not too bad, but it's definitely not too friendly for my fellow vegans and vegetarians. I had the Ricotta Pancakes and ended up sending them back because they had eggs in them (I was taking the dairy, but eggs...no). So I ended up getting the linguine instead with garlic cloves. It was okay, but nothing special about it and could have easily been made at home. One of my girlfriends had the Pomodoro Baked Eggs and said it was delicious and the other had the Sandwich consisting of roast beef, Italian peppers, and provolone. Her sandwich had a whole lot of beef, but enjoyed it for the most part (Shout out to Bar Primi for not skimping on the meat).SERVICE: Service was great, the staff was fast, patient and super sweet. I am a bit critical of customer service in every industry so believe me when I say the staff should not be a problem if you decided to munch here. They had no problem switching out my meals when I asked, and did so with a smile.OVERALL: I would have to head to Bar Primi for lunch and dinner to change my mind about the food, but it's definitely a cute trendy spot that you should visit just to cross off your list and say you had Frose at least once in your life.",3,0,0,Brittany W.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,4,0

2.0,8/7/2016,"The frosé was good. It was not too sweet, not too tart & I definitely could feel the high alcohol content in it.Now, I can recognize that one is supposed to fill a glass of wine about less than halfway, as proper serving instructions might dictate. However, frosé is not regular wine (and even if it was, it's probably made of very cheap rose). It's a frozen drink, closer to a margarita. So paying $14 for half a glass of what is essentially a wine margarita seems pretty crazy. Still, it's a summer trend so I get it.  But let's talk about the menu...The menu is unnecessarily pretentious. As such, I expected the quality of the meal to be on the refined side. Bottom line, their food is way too mediocre to justify their high prices. I love Italian food and I will shell out money for a fancy meal. But if you're looking for refined Italian food, this place is not it. Furthermore, their service was a mess. We arrived on time for a reservation and they made us wait for a table-- even though the restaurant was half empty at the time. Later, it seemed like there were four hostesses just standing around the front the restaurant while customers were just beginning to collect in noisy groups.Basically, I was not impressed with Bar Primi.

3.0,8/7/2016,"We came on a Saturday afternoon to try the newly infamous frosé. Unfortunately when we arrived (around 4), we were told they were unable to serve us because they were closing until 5:30. Which meant they couldn't even serve us a drink. Under normal circumstances this would be understandable, however I had specifically checked the hours before we made the trek all the way there... Which did not state this afternoon closure. We ended up making a 5:30 reservation... When we came back around 5:25 to check in, they clearly didn't have their shit together. Employees were racing around, and we were told that they couldn't seat us until the time of our reservation, which was 4 minutes away. So we waited. And waited. And waited. People were coming in and basing seated. They kept telling us or table wasn't ready yet.... Meanwhile we were a table of 2, and there were multiple empty tables for 2 available. We were finally seated at 5:50. Unacceptable since we had a 5:30 reservation.We should have known what the service would be like from that initial experience. It was awful. Not going to go into a ton of detail, but basically we had to keep asking for service. Food was alright, wasn't bad... But there are many other better Italian places in the city. The frosé was good, but probably not worth the experience we had. We probably won't be back.",0,0,0,Jennifer H.,"New York, NY",53,60,16
4.0,8/5/2016,"My husband and I had just viewed an exhibition at the International Center of Photography, recently moved to the Bowery from midtown, and wanted to eat brunch nearby.  I'd been wanting to try Bar Primi since we're big fans of Carmellini's Locanda Verde, plus we both dislike breakfast only brunch places and try to select places that serve both breakfast and lunch items, so we booked a table there.  We were exceedingly pleased with Bar Primi.We were offered an outdoor table, but it was too hot and muggy, so we were escorted to a comfy banquette on the second floor.  Service, from our initial greeting to farewell, was welcoming, attentive and congenial.  Both floors were attractively decorated in an airy modern Italian trattoria style.If we'd realized how huge the antipasti were we would have ordered only 1 but we shared both the ricotta bruschetta with honey, hazelnuts and herbs, and the San Daniele prosciutto with bufala mozzarella. Both were divine!  The ricotta was piled so high on the toasted bread I could barely get my mouth around it.We had to try a pasta, and we've always enjoyed rigatoni alla norma since enjoying many fine examples of that dish during our travels around Sicily.   I also was attracted to the roast beef sandwich with peppers and melted provolone so we ended up splitting both of those.  The eggplant in the pasta was tender and tasty, the sauce was delicious and the pasta was perfectly al dente.  The combination of flavors in the sandwich was delectable, though if forced to choose one dish, it would be the pasta.There's a good selection of wines by the glass and the waiter recommended the Aglianico, which I thoroughly enjoyed with all of the above.  We couldn't even say the word dessert after stuffing ourselves with all of that food, but next time we may order less so we can see how they do with the sweet stuff.  We definitely have to go back for dinner.",1,0,0,Barbara M.,"New York, NY",8,87,0

4.0,8/4/2016,"Summer 2016 marks the summer of frosé (frozen rosé). Bar Primi is GENIUS for coming up with something so simple yet creative. It's done a lot for raising awareness of the restaurant and its brand. We came here for happy hour on a Wednesday after work with a group of girlfriends. Beware - they don't seat you until your whole party arrives. The bar was PACKED so plan accordingly for everyone to be there at the same time. The tables were emptier than I thought, but it started getting really busy around 6-7ish. To be honest, Bar Primi was never really on our radar until it introduced this fun summer cocktail. The frosé did not disappoint! It's refreshing but stronger than you would think - you can really taste the vermouth.We also shared the caprese as an appetizer. It was light and I liked that it had watermelon and other veggies to go with it. Their menu seemed great, so I'm sad we didn't get to try their other items but we all had dinner plans elsewhere.Overall, the bar is on the pricier side (especially for hh because they don't have specials) but I loved the atmosphere and the food/drinks are solid.

The initial waiter was nice but could barely hear him and he would also rarely come to our table when more people got seated upstairs. The food was good for the price, but we did expect better service. Eventually our final waiter was very amicable and sweet and also nice when it came to sing Happy Birthday to my sister.

2.0,7/30/2016,"We came for restaurant week last night. Great food overshadowed by inexplicably bad service. It took over ten minutes after we sat down before our server came over to tell us that she would be with us soon. After ordering a bottle of wine, she brought the wrong bottle over twice. She opened the second one before we noticed it too was wrong. The manager was helpful and did the right thing by swapping it out for what we ordered. I ordered off of the regular menu, and my fiancée ordered off of the restaurant week menu. When the check came, we were charged for my fiancées restaurant week meal plus each of the individual dishes. I told the server, and even after bringing it to her attention, the check was wrong when she brought it back again. The constant issues throughout dinner really put a damper on a nice date out with my fiancée. It's a real shame, because I really wanted to like this place. I enjoyed going to Peels and was looking forward to trying Bar Primi. The pasta was excellent, which is why it's two stars instead of one. However, I would expect much better service for a restaurant like this. All of the issues were pretty basic things that the restaurant should have under control by now.

5.0,7/16/2016,"I originally wanted to come here 2 years ago for Valentine's Day but due to the cold of February, we went somewhere closer. I finally came here yesterday for a family dinner and by the end of it was quite happy with the whole meal.We started with two orders of the Burrata and the Rice balls. The Mozzarella was served with sweet peppers on top, along side a pair of very crunch grilled bread. Although I enjoyed the Burrata, the rice balls were what surprised me the most. I've always been a little obsessed with rice balls, whether they're Japanese or Italian, but these rice balls were quite beautifully scrumptious on the outside and warm and soft in the inside. The tomatoes with the rice made the center taste rich and creamy, which went well with the fried crusty outside layer. To top it all off it was served on top a pond of basil pesto which gave it a slight kick to it. Perhaps my favourite dish of the whole meal.For my entree, I had the Squid Ink Campanelle. It was served with crab, some garlic and Fresno chilies, all of which complimented each other to make a dish that wasn't just a plate of pasta. The Fresno brought out a mild spicy flavor with the simple, delicious taste of the Campanelle. The soft flesh of the crab worked well with the firmer Campanelle and was very difficult to stop eating.I enjoyed my experience at Bar Primi. Moderately priced for the taste and an appropriate list of wines to go with. My only criticism was perhaps the sound level in the restaurant. The music was already at a good level upon arrival but was brought up louder after a few minutes.In conclusion, however, I will definitely recommend Bar Primi for affordable, slightly more modern, Italian cuisine.

5.0,7/11/2016,"When I travel, I always like to check out as many local places to eat that I can. I've found that when I ask for recommendations from the concierge at the hotel, I'm usually getting a recommendation for a place when they get a commission or some form of incentive, so the food may or may not be good. Using the web is usually my fallback, but when I'm lucky enough to have friends who live in a city where I'm visiting, I'll always go with their recommendations, and haven't been let down yet.Day 2 of my weekend trip to NY included dinner at Bar Primi. Sitting on the corner, Bar Primi is one of those places where you'll fit in if you're dressed up, in shorts, or wearing a flannel shirt and jeans (like the servers). Dimly lit with candles through the place, you quickly forget how close you're sitting to the people next to you as you settle in for good conversation and great food. We started with a series of appetizers: stuffed meatballs, sicilian tomato rice balls with a basil pesto, and prosciutto with summer melon. The meatballs and rice balls came three to an order for the three of us, so there was no fighting over the last one, although we were all trying to get the last little bit of basil pesto sauce from the tomato rice balls. The prosciutto came in a little bigger portion and we actually had a little trouble finishing it, not wanting to be too full when our meals arrived. For the main course, I went with the squid ink campanelle that came with crab, garlic crema and fresno. A little heat from the peppers gave it a nice flavor without being too overpowering, and I still would have considered the dish very mild and okay for those not into a lot of heat. The pasta was a beautiful black that tasted absolutely amazing. I was full but kept forcing more and more of it in, not wanting to waste any of it. I finally admitted defeat, and one of my friends happily dove in and made sure it found a good home in his stomach.Another friend got the bucatini with lamb amatriciana which looked pretty good as well. I'm not Italian and would just embarrass myself trying to eat a long pasta in public (especially next to him.. who had it down like a rockstar), so I tried a bit of the lamb and skipped the pasta. Again, delicious.Chefs Andrew Carmellini and Salvatore Lamboglia know what they're doing in the kitchen, and I'll be thinking about my meal here for some time to come.

Tasted awful and if you don't have Pepsi or Diet Coke, just say it.  I'd go back in a second and give it a hugs thumbs up, great food, very comfortable and the vibe is so warm and cool and pleasing.",0,0,1,Joe F.,"Tenafly, NJ",60,223,53
5.0,6/1/2016,"I'm pretty sure this tops the list as one of my favorite meals in Manhattan to date, thank you bar primi for a fabulous birthday dinner!I came here last Thursday with my boyfriend, my cousin has been telling me I NEED to go so I thought this was the perfect occasion to indulge. We arrived and were seated after just a few minutes at a cozy booth upstairs - I just love the ambiance of this place and the fact that the tables aren't on top of one another...there is actually some breathing room *gasp*! We had 3 different wines, all were delicious and recommended by our waiter. I also had the diamanté passion fruit cocktail which was perfection, just the right amount of sweet and tangy! For apps we shared the burrata with eggplant caponata, the arancini, and the ricotta crostini with walnuts &...TRUFFLE. HONEY. Dear lord I could bathe in that stuff, and am clearly dreaming of my next encounter with it!! The burrata and arancini were delicious as well and we cleaned our plates (but we licked our fingers after the truffle honey...no shame). For dinner I had the fiore di carciofi and my boyfriend had the garganelli. Mine was very rich and just the perfect amount. His was decidedly larger and also fabulous, probably the best carbonara-style pasta dish I've had...and I've had alllllll the pasta. Somehow we managed to order the affogato for dessert, don't ask me how we managed to stuff another thing inside but we did and I don't regret a thing. Everything was beyond expectations!Overall our service was good, I think they make it a point to leave you along and let you enjoy your meal. It was a slower meal, but at no point did I feel like we were forgotten. The one time we needed our waiter but couldn't find him, that exact moment a manager came over to say he stepped out for a minute and asked if there was anything we needed - I mean that's wonderful! We enjoyed every moment and will surely be back, I'd love to try lunch/brunch on the weekend!",1,0,0,Shaina F.,"New York, NY",75,281,371

3.0,3/13/2016,"Concept:Cute but busy Italian restaurant with a selection of items meant to be shared or enjoyed individually. Good spot for group dinners and one-on-one occasions.Food: Stuffed Meatballs - felt it was a standard meatball. It lacked on the ""stuffed"" to where I couldn't tell what it should've been stuffed with. Fine for a sharable appetizer, but nothing special.Broccoli - great appetizer! The bombs calabrese sauce gave it a nice, subtle spicy flavor. If you're seeking a veggie dish to offset the carb overload about to take place, run with this one.Linguine - incredibly intense on the garlic flavor;  it's basically a bowl of pasta and a thousand cloves of garlic.Squid Ink Campanelle - i love squid ink pasta, but this didn't do it for me. it came across as another bowl of pasta without anything distinct. Bucatini - the pasta noodle's texture was great. The lamb protein makes this more satisfying and well-rounded than the other pasta dishes. Only complaint is the small portion size. Think it's sharable with only two people.Ambience:Busy, can get fairly loud at times, but I don't feel like you're shouting to be heard. Romantic? Can be, but without the fanciness being overdone. Lighting is dim, so there's your mood setting.Service:Top notch. We had a last minute adjustment to the size of our party after we were seated, and they managed to move us to a table to accommodate despite being an incredibly busy Friday evening. Water glass was kept full the entire time to where I felt so bad making the guys come by every 5 minutes. Managers on duty were also incredibly hospitable. Overall:I want to like this place more. The service is awesome. The atmosphere is conducive to whatever occasion you want it to be.

3.0,2/24/2016,"Cozy little spot on the corner of 2nd and Bowery - there is both seating and a bar downstairs, as well as additional seating upstairs. Service is helpful and accommodating. Was a bit disappointed by the food! I love Andrew Carmellini's other restaurants, The Dutch and Lafayette, so was sort of surprised I didn't also LOVE Bar Primi the same way. To start, the four of us shared tomato basil rice balls (which were warm on the outside but cold on the inside...) and the brussels sprouts with pepperoni, which may have been the best thing we ate all night. I got the fiore de carciofi, a tiny portion of tender pasta wrapped around an artichoke filling and topped with pancetta and pecorino. It was delicious, but my entire portion was about 6 bites total. I also sampled the orchiette, which was way too salty, and this is coming from a girl who loves salt. The garganelli was quite good, as was the squid ink campanelle, although both were also very salty. I'm torn, because I loved the space and loved the idea of all the dishes - maybe this was an off night.

On Tuesday we called, no luck BUT the host did recommend we keep calling back because a lot of people cancel in the days leading up. Called back on Wednesday, there was a spot at 9:30 and we took it just to get our foot in the door. Thursday, called again and was able to change it to 8:15.

All the wines were Italian so I asked for a recommendation for a Sauvignon Blanc type of wine and she quickly offered 3 options. My friend and I went with the Verdiccho, which was perfect.  My choices for the 3 courses: Truffle Arancini, Fusilli and Gelato del Giorno (Hazelnut) I LOVED the arancini. Perfectly crisp on the outside, creamy and cheesy on the inside. Yum, yum. Would definitely come back for this. I was kind of disappointed that were wasn't a pasta with red sauce as an option because I prefer it to white/no sauce but I went with the fusili. After the first bite, I was instantly reminded of a chicken noodle soup. It was homey and rich but ultimately, not my cup of tea. The hazelnut gelato was exactly as you would expect an just tasted like pure hazelnuts. Also not my cup of tea, but since I don't like chocolate it was really my only choice.

4.0,1/24/2016,"Came to Bar Primi with a few friends for Restaurant Week. I'd heard the hype about this restaurant and thus came in with lofty expectations. We came on a Friday night with a reservation for 9:00. My party was 10 minutes late but came within the confines of the reservation window. That said, the restaurant kept us waiting for 20 or so minutes while our ""reserved"" table was being emptied. Upon being seated we promptly decided on the restaurant week options. We also ordered a bottle of wine to accompany our meal. The wine selections were diverse and overall spectacular. The one complaint I'd have is the serving staff's lack knowledge over the proper wine pairings. Without said recommendation, my party and I were left to navigate the wine list on our own. The food overall was excellent. The pasta, true to the restaurants reputation, was excellent and perfectly cooked. We chose all three of the restaurant entrees offered on their restaurant week menu and were impressed by all of them. The veal genovese (my choice) was a delicious, broth-y fusili packed with juicy morsels of ground veal. The roast chicken, per my friend, was moist and packed with flavor. My favorite part of that dish were the mushrooms, delicately sautéed with a satisfying meaty bite. The vegetarian pasta was also great. We each ended our meal with the milk chocolate panna cotta. A deliciously creamy dessert brought a smile to each of our faces. Overall, I'd break down the experience as follows:Ambiance: GreatFood: ExcellentWine: ExcellentService: Okay. Like others have said, this was easily the weakest part of the overall experience. My party and felt that we were not properly taken care of.

We got the stuffed meatballs to start - 5 stars the cheese inside was delicious and the meatballs had great flavor. We split the Fusilli with veal and the squid ink campanelle.

5.0,12/14/2015,"Pretty shocked this place isn't at least four stars. I had the absolute best experience there last week with some colleagues and cannot wait to go back. First thing's first - the space is super cute. Not stuffy, but cozy yet trendy. We had no clue what to order so the waiter suggested a tasting menu - sold! For five people they brought out three different apps (two orders of each) and three pastas (also two orders of each), same goes for dessert. For the apps - the ricotta bruschetta was good - the pieces are large, the ricotta is tasty. My only critique is that there was a bit too much honey for my liking. We also got the kale salad which was delicious, although the only thing I wasn't SO hot on were the eggs inside, but it didn't turn me off that much. We also got the burrata which was INSANE. That combined with EVOO and red peppers. SO GOOD. Now the pasta. The pasta was outrageous. Where do I begin? The  bolognese I think was my fave. I'm particular with my bolognese and this knocked it out of the park. No terrible celery shctick, just straight, yummy meat. I want it right now. My second favorite was spaghetti and clams. I didn't even eat the clams but the sauce itself was the perfect mix of garlic-y and salty. I can't even describe how good it was. The pumpkin ravioli was my least favorite. Don't love mixing salty with sweet with my pastas. Dessert - I'm not a dessert person but the hazelnut ice cream was a standout. All in all, a HUGE winner in my book!",2,1,1,Ali C.,"New York, NY",94,424,2

He even added his magic ice cube that he made of maple syrup, berries, and many other delicious things in it! Yummy!  The drink then changed flavors while it was melting, delicious!  The only thing was for me, it takes me some time to drink an old fashion so by the end, the ice cube had melted too much and the drink got too sweet.  I think maybe this magic ice cube is for people who drink fast (or normally since I am just a slower drinker).  Or maybe if he had some smaller mini cubes where I could just put one small cube?! Who knows. But the food was delicious as well!",0,0,0,Survi K.,"New York, NY",17,16,0
4.0,12/10/2015,"Bar Primi is a self-proclaimed Pasta Shop located in the heart of the still-trendy Bowery. With a warm and inviting glow, and a hint of garlic in the air, this restaurant beckons to all in the mood for some high end (but affordable) comfort food. There is a main dining and bar area on the ground floor, with a larger seating area up one flight of stairs. If you have time before your reservation, grab a drink from the attractive bartender, especially one of the recommended cocktails. A slave to tradition, I ordered my usual glass of prosecco, which was cool and crisp. Our party was seated on the second floor at a long table in the back, which was separated from the other tables by some simple shelving that made the area seem a bit more private, while also keeping the entire room quite open. Being a large group, we were able to experience the Chef's Menu which featured four appetizers, four pastas, and two desserts, all of which were complemented by some red and white wine. To begin the meal, we had the Calamari Friti, which was just a tad salty, but still quite delicious. I will admit that I passed on the Kale Insalata, since greens are not my favorite, but the table seemed to enjoy the salad, especially the cheese topping. And the highlights for me were the Sicilian Tomato Rice Balls and the Stuffed Meatballs, which were both just amazing. I don't know what was inside the meatballs to make them so tasty, but the secret ingredients really make them unique. I especially loved being able to taste four of the pastas instead of just one entrée. We tried the Spaghetti Pomodoro, Linguine with garlic and breadcrumbs, Orecchiette with salsiccia, and the season Garganelli ragu alla Bolognese. All the pastas were perfectly cooked, and served very simply to enhance each flavor. My favorite was actually the Linguine with garlic and breadcrumbs, which was served in a light sauce. I may have polished off that bowl while a few others weren't looking. The meal ended with some traditional Italian Tiramisu and a more surprising choice with Hazelnut Gelato. Overall, the meal was quite lovely, due to the delicious food and also my dining companions. The one major downside is that I lost my voice a little the next day, since the restaurant was a bit loud and we had to speak up to be heard across our long table. Still, I'll be back for those Stuffed Meatballs and Linguine very soon.",9,1,3,Krista J.,"Brooklyn, NY",749,1181,35

Got the appetizer meatballs (to DIE for) and fried mozzarella (unlike ANYTHING you have had before)on his recommendation. The gravy was spectacular for both and the hard Italian bread to mop it up is just another reason why NYC is the greatest restaurant town in the USA.

4.0,10/19/2015,"Funny...I had a musician friend who lived on the second floor of this building in the 1980s-90s, because it was cheap, although the location, on the Bowery, was kind of scary. He had to move out when the building was sold, and now it's an upscale Italian eatery, with lovely flowers hanging outside. Whoever expected that the Bowery would become a place that people WANT to go?We were a party of four, about 4:00 on a Sunday afternoon. After checking out 3 places that were either line-out-the-door (Katz's) or finished serving lunch for the day, we came in here mainly just because they were open and had a table. It takes nerve to open an Italian restaurant in a neighborhood where there are so many, but Bar Primi may be able to hold its own. Our waitress was as nice as can be, and we really liked the salads, which are big enough for two. I had the ""Bensonhurst"" sandwich, like an Italian sub, but on a round roll. It could have used some hot peppers, but it was still very tasty. The spaghetti and clams has spicy Italian sausage in it, yum. The prices are on the high side, but so is the quality of the ingredients, and I'm sure a lot of your dinner check goes toward Bar Primi paying rent in this newly-hot neighborhood.

Place was really cute, and actually not super crowded - we were able to get seated right away even though we were a little behind schedule.We ordered appetizers for the table to share:Stuffed meatballs in sugo $13.25This was pretty delicious! Anything stuffed with cheese is good...haha :)Sicilian tomato rice balls basil pesto $9.50UHM, AMAZING! You cannot leave this place without ordering this dish. It's such a light arancini ball that you could probably eat 10 of these yourself. It also comes with this creamy basil pesto sauce under it. YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMM.burrata cremosa brooklyn tomatoes, basil, watermelon $16.00I think this was just okay - can skip. Again, like my other reviews say, please go to Riverpark for the best burrata in the world haha.Now onto the main courses; there were 5 of us so we all got different ones to share:orecchiette salsiccia, broccoli rabe, peperoncino $20.50All of the pastas here taste home-made and fresh, but I thought this dish overall tasted just like any other regular orecchiette dish at any other italian restaurant...no new flavors/textures, etc. But again, a very solid pasta (super safe though!).spaghetti & clams 'nduja, sugo, parsley $22.00I think this was my fam's favorite - I like spaghettis that are light and not dredged in tomato sauce. Lots of clams too!fiore di carciofi pancetta, pecorino $21.00A pretty presentation (looks like a flower on the plate) but the smallest portion for sure. This was off their seasonal menu...tasted very onion-y. Not sure I would order this again.spinach cavatelli white bolognese, piave $21.00This was the pasta I picked - also off the seasonal menu, I loved how the spinach pasta was a pretty green color, kinda looked like string beans haha. Other than it being slightly too salty, the texture of the pasta and piave flavor was fantastic.carbonara pastaWe also got a carbonara rigatoni pasta (not sure exactly what it's called since I don't see it on the menu online) - this was delicious too...creamy, but not heavy.Of course we ended the meal with the often raved about tiramisu and cheesecake. Both were outstanding - tiramisu is soaked pretty well and has a super strong coffee flavor :).Split among the 4 of us, we each paid about $90 (including a few cocktails).

I have still yet to actually speak to a manager, as every time I call the manager is ""not in"" or ""in a meeting"".  The manager also has all of my contact information, so could've reached out to me directly even if he really wasn't in, or in a meeting.  I asked to receive proof that my card was refunded, and was never sent this.

1.0,8/13/2015,"I came here with 2 friends for a restaurant week dinner and early birthday celebration. I chose this restaurant because of its reputation and positive reviews. We arrived early, at around 6:30 pm on a Monday evening, and had a round of drinks at the bar. The restaurant was nearly empty but the ambiance was lovely and the bartender was friendly. The evening went downhill after we were seated upstairs for our 7 pm reservation. When our waitress (who our receipts indicate was named Danielle) came over to take our order, my friend politely asked if it was possible to get the puttanesca sauce without olives. Our waitress made a face, frowned, and disapprovingly said she would ask the chef. We thought maybe she was just having a bad day, or maybe she just had a frigid personality, but then she proceeded to ignore us throughout the rest of our meal, despite the upstairs area being nearly empty for at least the first half of our meal. Mid-way through dinner she cleared my friend's empty wine glass without asking her if she wanted another. My other friend ordered a dirty martini, which took forever to arrive, but when it did there was no olive juice; when we FINALLY got our waitress' attention and asked her if she wouldn't mind fixing the drink, since they aren't cheap, she just walked away without apologizing and returned 10 minutes later with a small glass of olive juice and again said nothing. The icing on the cake was when the 3 desserts arrived, with the birthday candle in the wrong dessert, and our waitress coldly dropped it on the table, in front of my friend, without looking at us or saying Happy Birthday and just walked away. I'm a native New Yorker so I feel like I've grown fairly accustomed to bad service, in fact one of my favorite Italian restaurants is actually notorious for kicking you out once you're done eating since they get so busy, but you can't help but love them anyways. There was nothing to love about Bar Primi. My two girl friends who just moved to NYC, who are the nicest girls you've ever met from the Midwest, were so offended and distracted by our waitress' attitude which even I found to be unforgivably appalling.

She was extremely rude and when I simply asked for another martini, she took 30 min to bring one out and this is after I politely asked to follow up on my order. It was not the right kind of drink and when I said something, she stared me down for an awkward amount of time, so much making me feel uncomfortable, and said sure and walked away. I have never felt so uncomfortable by a waitress in my life. This was one of the many encounters that we experienced with this waitress and my friend talked in the restroom to another table who was complaining of the same thing.

4.0,8/3/2015,"KenScale: 8.0/10It's been a while since my last visit to Bar Primi, a casual pasta-centric restaurant from chef Andrew Carmellini. I've always been a fan of soulful pasta dishes at chef Carmellini's restaurants and enjoyed Bar Primi's straightforward yet hearty dishes as well. I revisited on a recent Friday dinner, and had another satisfying experience.For the starters, I went with eggplant caponata bruschetta and calamari fritti that came with spicy aioli. Both dishes were delicious and weren't overly salty to my liking. I could probably eat the bruschetta every day for lunch, and calamari was above average, with fresh seafood that was fried in right degree. For the pastas, I went with linguine with 4 cloves of garlic and breadcrumbs and spinach cavatelli that came with white Bolognese. Neither dishes would wow you in plating/display, but I loved the rustic touch of both dishes. Linguine was more or less cooked perfect al dente, and spinach cavatelli had the rich Bolognese sauce that was addictive. I probably had a bit too much of both dishes and was stuffed even before the dessert, but there was no denying that I couldn't stop digging them. For dessert, simple tiramisu was moist and smooth for a delightful bite to end the meal.The restaurant's scene was still vibrant, with a large group of young people looking to get their pasta fill before starting a night out on Friday. It was a bit too much loud at times, so perhaps an outdoor seating in the summer might be a better choice. Bar Primi still delivers as a no-nonsense casual Italian joint that showcases chef Carmellini's simple yet elegant approach to Italian dishes.",3,1,0,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738
4.0,7/27/2015,"came here on a pretty busy monday evening. the service started off as just so-so. our server seemed to have better places to be (or so the impression she gave). for appetizers, we ordered the ricotta and fig crostini (this is delicious. the creaminess of the ricotta with the sweetness of the figs, a great combination. delicately balanced and the fig does not overpower the subtle flavor of the ricotta) and the rice balls (another hit. i like the savory tomato-based rice and the pesto sauce it comes with. i could pop 100 of these). then we waited.... and waited..... and waited.thirty five minutes, no attention from the server and no pastas! the manager suddenly came by and told us that the time the pasta was taking was unacceptable and comped all three of our entrees. i really appreciated that because he did not need to do that, but i'm glad they seemed to value our time and patience.Immediately after this, our three dishes arrived. 1. linguini with garlic and breadcrumbs. GREAT garlic flavor. solid choice for vegetarians (and nonvegetarians!!) if you're on a first date, i'd advise skipping it because you may have garlic breath for the next few hours2. spaghetti vongole - another great dish. we ordered it without the pork (didn't miss it.) pasta was not overly al-dente, nice seafood flavor from the clams3. squid ink campanelli - my favorite pasta. spicy heat from the chilies partially subdued by he cream sauce. sweet pieces of crab (and they don't skimp on this either).this place was so good that i came back two days later and tried the stuffed meatballs, rice balls (Again! and even BETTER this time), veal milanese special (if you're here on a wednesday make sure someone at your table gets this because it's delicious. thinly pounded and perfectly seasoned), and the spinach cavatelli (pretty good, but mediocre compared to the other pastas i've tried).",2,0,2,Sylvia B.,"Manhattan, NY",161,315,831

For a pasta lover, this restaurant is a serious dream come true...there are hardly any other entrees on the menu!For appetizers, don't miss the ricotta, honey and fig on toast. This was such a perfect bite - the ricotta was so smooth and runny it almost seemed puréed. The figs were perfectly ripe and the honey was just slightly sweet. Plus herbs were sprinkled on top...amazing! The calamari appetizer was nice, as well, served with blistered shishito and red peppers.All three of us stuck to the traditional pasta section rather than the seasonals. My favorite of the three we tried was the paccheri (type of noodle) in a vodka sauce (sugo rosa) with shrimp. The noodle shape is unusual and very delicious. We also had the spaghetti pomodoro and the garlic linguine. All three dishes were perfectly al dente and breadcrumbs on top added a nice crunch.Also - greatest tiramisu ever (so smooth and silky and just the right amount of alcohol) so don't pass on dessert and their digestif menu was superb.

2.0,6/18/2015,"I was here recently with a large group. I had communicated with the manager about our reservation and was told there would be a prix fixe menu for a group of our size, determined the day of our reservation. I let the restaurant know of several allergies a member of our party had so everyone would be able to enjoy dinner, a couple weeks in advance of our reservation.When we got there, the waitress acknowledged the allergies and said everything would be allergen free, but for the rest of the meal she seemed annoyed and was inattentive. Waiters brought out the food but would never announce what it was. We were also not given a written menu. This seems like bad practice in general, but especially when someone in the party has allergies (for example, there was a pesto and it was not clear that it was nut-free until we tracked down our waitress and asked). Then a main dish was brought out that did contain nuts - this was announced and we were told it would be the only dish that our friend couldn't have. Two minutes later, another main dish was brought out that ALSO contained nuts. The waitress blamed this on the kitchen ""reading the ticket wrong."" My friend asked for a version of the dish that she could have, and they obliged, but this situation was annoying and dangerous. They also didn't bring out serving utensils for ANYTHING - we eventually had to ask for them to avoid cross contamination.I expected the manager, or anyone really, to come and apologize, but no one came. I went downstairs and spoke with the manager, who said she wished I had told her about the situation sooner (I told her as soon as I realized no one was coming to acknowledge the mistakes). She was vaguely apologetic, but did not seem to understand the seriousness of the restaurant's mistakes. At the end of the meal they provided us with a complimentary after-dinner drink, but this felt like a small gesture given how rudely we were treated by the waitress, and by how nonchalant the employees were about the whole situation.Long story short - we enjoyed most of the food, but be extremely careful going here if you have allergies.

We had burrata (get it), kale salad (eh), rice balls (pretty good) and meatballs (yes!) to start. This was then followed by four pastas: orecchiette bolognase (decent), carbonara (obviously good), ricotta ravioli (yes!), and classic spaghetti (great). Dessert was by far the show stopper with a homemade tiramisu which was insanely delicious. It was served with two types of ice cream: vanilla and hazelnut. With dinner, we had 2 bottles of wine for $50/bottle. All wines on the menu are roughly between $50-$100 or so. Final cost: $100/person...how on earth does that make sense?

We started with the broccoli rabe with feta. It was good - a little bitter, as broccoli rabe usually is, but also had a nice spice to it and the feta complimented everything well. After that we got two pastas - the linguine & the spinach cavatelli. The linguini was good - lots of garlic and oil with a little spice. They say there are breadcrumbs but I don't remember tasting any crunch to the dish. Whenever I get a simple pasta dish I always compare it to the incredible spaghetti dish at L'artusi. Nothing compares to that so I guess it's tough to be so satisfied with other dishes when I have something that amazing to compare it to. As for the spinach cavatelli, it was good as well. Nothing here wow'ed me but everything was tasty. The cavatelli had a white creamy meat sauce. Following the pastas, we had the tiramisu.

5.0,3/24/2015,"I felt compelled to write a review of Bar Primi, solely because of all of the 'iffy' reviews on here and I felt as though they deserved more than that. I had heard some great things about this restaurant through the grape vine, and being a bit of a foodie, I had seen a number of photos of their food on instagram.. and they looked good! Before booking my dinner reservation Sunday night for a friend and I to go to dinner Monday evening (yes, I was able to get a reservation the day before), I had read a number of reviews regarding their small portions, rushed service, etc. so I was a bit nervous taking a friend from out of town there for her one meal in NYC, but wanted to give it a shot...I could not be more glad that I did. Granted, it was a Monday at 8pm, but the place was not overcrowded in the least bit and we got seated right away. My friend and I sat between others, but did not feel cramped at all. Our waitress gave us our menus and ample time to look over them, while chatting (and guilty: we were certainly doing more chatting than looking at our menu's at first). She was attentive, but not pushy in asking for our drink order, making sure we were satisfied and asking us if we had questions with the menu. Being that it was our first time there, she was very helpful in assisting is in ordering the proper amount and was honest about the amount of food in appetizer orders, and pasta. Being a smaller restaurant, I could tell that the ambiance could get noisy quickly, however it was not last night when we were there. We ordered the fontina stuffed meatballs and ricotta bruschetta as starters - both delicious. The ricotta bruschetta was so different than anything I had ever had before, but in the best way. The meatballs were also delicious, so much so that my friend said that she was surprised they didn't have a spaghetti and meatballs type meal on the menu! For dinner I ordered the Bucatini (lamb amatriciano) and my friend ordered the linguine with garlic, breadcrumbs. From a first glance, the portion did look on the ""smaller"" side for an Italian restaurant, but once I began to eat, I thought it was a perfect size for actually being able to finish my meal. I personally think that most people these days are accustomed to having too much food at restaurants and are disappointed when there is nothing left to take home.. hence saying that their portions are small, but I did not think so at all. Considering I did share two appetizers with my friend first, I could not have been more satisfied with the amount of pasta. It was thick and had a good amount of sauce and lamb. My friend loved hers as well and from the two forkfuls I tried, I thought it was delicious. I little too garlicy for my personal taste, but that's why there's chocolate and vanilla. Even though we were stuffed, we saw another table order the tiramisu for dessert and decided that we had to try it as well. This was an excellent decision. Despite the fact that we were both too stuffed to finish this creamy rich dessert (which actually game in an incredibly large portion size, for a tiramisu), it was one of the sweetest most delicious desserts I've tasted in a while. We certainly dined and took our time throughout the dinner and did not feel rushed at all. I thought all of the food was well worth the price (on the less expensive side for an Italian restaurant in NYC) and absolutely delicious. Perhaps we had these experiences because we went on a week night, but I would 100% recommend this restaurant to others and will be back again.",0,0,0,Carly L.,"New York, NY",724,15,0

But our server seemed disinterested and unfriendly, which was off-putting. We actually decided to get coffee and dessert elsewhere because we didn't want to be around her anymore.

3.0,3/14/2015,"Try Bar Primi, says everyone.  All the cool kids are doing it.  It's impossible to get a reservation since they started accepting them.All of these factors compelled me to go the way of the masses and give this golden child of the NYC food scene a shot.  I'm glad that I did, if anything to have crossed it off my list, but I won't be returning any time soon.  It's just more trouble than it's worth.Don't get me wrong -- Bar Primi is a good restaurant.  The food is tasty, though not necessarily special.  But by and large, the portions are miniscule, and the menu is not well planned.  Four appetizers and four pastas for a table for four should yield a satisfying meal.  Place that order at Bar Primi, and you'll all leave hungry.  The food is not so unbelievably good that expending the energy required to get a table here is worthwhile.  No dish is bad, but no dish is memorable, either. There are so many wonderful Italian restaurants, most of which serve the bigger dishes of the same quality as Bar Primi for the same price, but without all of the fuss.  Don't waste your time with Bar Primi.  You'll be glad you listened.",1,2,0,Noah X.,"New York, NY",0,27,0
3.0,3/12/2015,"I absolutely love this restaurant.  The food and ambiance is amazing.  That being said, I never write any reviews but felt like I had to because I noticed something that has become a pattern here. I had a decent size sip of wine left and a waiter walked by and took it without asking if I was done.  I called after her but she kept walking.  I was obviously annoyed and told my waiter what happened.  He ended up topping off my new glass. Another time I was here, they were pushing us to order even when we said we needed a minute.  They rushed us though our appetizer and through the rest of the meal.  The same went for tonight.  We finished our dinner but were using the bread sticks to sop up the last of our pasta sauce and literally 5 different people came by within 30 seconds of each other to grab our plates.  One grabbed my plate and started walking away and then asked if I was finished.  I said no.  Like I said, I love this place but they give me anxiety with their incessant need to pick up your plate while you are still chewing your last bite.Let us enjoy our food while we are enjoying the ambiance!  Who wants to be rushed through dinner?",0,1,0,Alison H.,"New York, NY",10,4,0
3.0,3/9/2015,"A couple of friends and I decided to try out this place during restaurant week.  Unfortunately nothing on the restaurant week menu looked appetizing so we just ended up ordering entrees from the main menu.  Two of us ordered the short rib raviolini which practically melted in our mouth but it was overpriced.  I think we both got like 8 tiny pieces each and were still pretty hungry after dinner.  Also, I'm not exactly sure why it was served in salty water?  It would've made more sense to serve it in creamy sauce or something along those lines so it would better fill up the stomach.  Overall, the atmosphere of the restaurant was nice and the service was good.  It would be a good place to go for a romantic dinner for two since the restaurant was warmly lit by candles but not for a friend's night out.",1,0,0,Mei W.,"San Francisco, CA",56,42,119

Restaurant Week is the chance for restaurants to impress people so they come back for MORE. Not turn them off. Normally I go in with low expectations but after being pleasantly surprised at the last couple of Restaurant Week dinners I've attended and after hearing such amazing things about this place, my expectations were fairly high. The grilled octopus was rubbery and hardly edible. The veal ravioli was the best thing by far and was delicious I will admit (I would hope so too as pasta is supposed to be their forte). The chocolate hazelnut torta was dry and tasted like they picked it up at the Food Emporium. I don't know if they're using a reverse marketing ploy so I come back and try other things because i KNOW this can't be their usual standard as it's so popular. Even the great service and cute surroundings can't make up for it.

The fiore di carciofi (artichoke stuffed pasta) is not something I would usually order but it was unique, as well as delicious. I would also put their broccoli rabe app/salad in the same category. Order it, because you won't have it prepared that way somewhere else.Some things to avoid: I didn't love my pasta, red wine lumache, and I didn't think the calamari fritti was anything special.

However, once we ordered our drinks, my friend's wine didn't come out for like 20 minutes even though all the other drinks came out.The cappuccino was amazing. I would highly recommend it. I had the egg crostino, which was amazing. It was essentially a soft scramble with crab on toasted bread with an arugula salad. It was perfect. The 3 of us shared the french toast for dessert. I loved the french toast itself, but found the apples that it came with a bit too tart. We were asked at least twice whether we were finished when we clearly were not, and there wasn't a line of people waiting - there were empty tables. So we found that odd.

The food was pretty good, although my short rib ravioli came not in a sauce but in a weird clear broth that I just didn't understand. And I saw on here that for someone else, it was served in a red sauce! I'm jealous I didn't get to experience that. Maybe it's a seasonal thing?Also, they rushed us through service incredibly fast.

After 45 minutes we checked in and she said it would be at least another hour and a half, which was reasonable.

She told us ""They went through dinner very quickly and are almost finished, as soon as they leave that table is yours. I would say about 20 minutes."" We were very happy and decided to wait, and as soon as the table got us we walked over to the host stand only to watch her seat a different couple at that table. A second hostess came over and pointed out a table of people finishing their dinner, and told us that table would be ours as soon as they left. When I told her the other hostess had said that about the previous table, she dismissed it and said there must have been a miscommunication. So after being lied to twice and dismissed we decided to leave. The final straw was seeing two more people join the couple that had sat at the table we were promised, after being told explicitly that they will not seat incomplete parties.

MUST-HAVES: Octopus (starter), Fiore (seasonal menu)!COCKTAILS: yelp.com/biz_photos/bar-…* Lambrusco Sangria ($40 pitcher) - 4 starsRefreshing, in a heavy red wine, yet still smooth & is sweet. Everyone gets a glass pre-filled with sliced oranges, & the staff was really on top of refilling our glasses all night from our pitcher.DINNER MENU: yelp.com/biz_photos/bar-…ANTIPASTI* Stuffed meatballs (in sugo, $12 for three) - 4 starspic: yelp.com/biz_photos/bar-…cross-section: yelp.com/biz_photos/bar-…Soft crumbly meat, filled with melty cheese, surrounded by fresh tangy tomato sauce. No complaints here! They can adjust this dish to be 4 or 5 meatballs as well for easier sharing.PICCOLINI* Octopus alla griglia (patate, red hots, oregeno ($16) - 4.5 starspic: yelp.com/biz_photos/bar-…I always order octopus when I see it on a menu, & I've had the gamut in terms of quality. This was definitely one of the best I've had: simple, one single tentacle. You have a variety of cuts this way, from the hearty meaty stuff at the thicker side to the crisper more textured meats at the other end. Garnished with a few simple flavors, this octopus was incredibly tender & I was blown away.TRADITIONAL* Bucatini (lamb amatriciano, $18) - 3.5 starspic: yelp.com/biz_photos/bar-…Very al dente on the pasta, a thick spaghetti. This was good but it really could've used more sauce, & definitely a lot more meat! What I did try was tasty.* Pumpkin agnolotti (mostardo fruit, amaretti, $17) - 3 starspic: yelp.com/biz_photos/bar-…The sweetness of the pumpkin filling was definitely enhanced by the mustard fruit, a sweet sauce over the pasta. The texture of the agnolotti was pretty soft. This fulfilled my pumpkin craving, but I wished there was more variety in the flavors of this dish. SEASONAL* Cavatelli (salsiccia, red grapes, pepperoncino, sage, $18) - 3.5 starspic: yelp.com/biz_photos/bar-…The largest serving of the pastas we got, & the most hearty/filling. I liked the thick swirly pieces of pasta, which were just the right al dente texture. The sauce was subtle & done well, but the grapes were a little out of place; they didn't add much. * Fiore de carciofi (smoked bacon, pecorino, $19) - 4 starspic: yelp.com/biz_photos/bar-…I was most impressed by the dish. It's definitely the heaviest, as the pasta has a filling & is doused in a buttery the sauce, but we all loved the intensity of flavors in this one.DOLCE: yelp.com/biz_photos/bar-…* Warm Chocolate Hazelnut Torta ($9) - 4 starspic: yelp.com/biz_photos/bar-…Nice! The crunch from the hazelnuts was fantastic, texture a little hard, but flavor was great especially with the intense dark chocolate syrup & whipped cream.* Tiramisu ($9) - 3.5 starspic: yelp.com/biz_photos/bar-…I have to qualify my review by saying I'm just not really a tiramisu person. I thought this was fine, a little on the soggy/too-soft side. Whipped cream was melted, no fluff/structure, almost liquid in texture. Not really impressive.",1,1,1,Ziyan C.,"San Francisco, CA",83,2073,9557

We went early on a Friday night and did get seated right away, but that is where the good service side of things ended. Our waitress exhibited little charm, which I can forgive, but what really got to me was how rushed we felt through the whole meal. I've worked a long week, we're enjoying our Friday eating out, and it feels like we're in a fast food restaurant. Everything was rushed...the ordering, the food pacing, and the dessert offer and check delivery. (This coming for a pair that are super fast eaters!) And yes, I was offered a second glass of wine, but it totally felt like the up-sell it was. Overall, there was no sense that we were meant to feel comfortable. (Two days earlier I had an amazing meal and comfortable service at Hearth!)The food, conversely, was really pretty good. We had the rice ball appetizer, my husband yummed all the way through his roast beef sandwich, and i enjoyed the octopus and kale caesar. (but $14 for a really small salad huh?) I would consider going back if it wasn't for the crappy service.  Not sure what's up with this location.

We had the beet salad, the four garlic linguini, and the potatoes. All were delicious, though the linguini entree size was just too small -- it's not an expensive set of ingredients that go into that dish (though crazy tasty), so it would have been nice to have at least 5 more forkfuls of pasta.

Then, the pièce de résistance, lobster oreganata which was their Friday special. We got the last order too. And OH DEAR GOD was is delicious.

We started with the rice balls and stuffed meatballs. Each were very flavorful with the right crispy outer soft inner texture. For entrees we had the rigatoni with corn and pancetta and the fiore di carciofi with smoked bacon and pecorino. Both were delicious and had a great combo of flavors. I loved how the fiore was presented. It was just enough food to satisfy and not stuff. And, of course, the tiramisu. You can't really go wrong with tiramisu but what made me giddy was the sheer size of it! My only issue were the thin breadsticks and the bread.

2.0,10/13/2014,"To be honest, this place has more vibe and ambiance than food that excites. My friend was visiting out of town and mentioned this was a new and hot place to try, so we walked in and got spots at the bar. We went for the kale salad, with Parmesan, crumbled egg and a light dressing. That was refreshing. Next came peach and ricotta crostini, on the smaller side but a bite full of flavor. I was most underwhelmed by the finish - the farm fresh Mac & cheese, which I expected to be packed with flavor and cheesy goodness, on the first night of fall. However, it was a little too light - where I didn't even notice the cream or cheese and needed hot sauce to add flavor. Plus, at the end of it, the check didn't do justice to how much we even ate.

2.0,9/29/2014,"Had an very underwhelming meal and incredibly frustrating service at this place last Tuesday night. The server was not well informed and avoided the table, and the food was mediocre, with all three pastas clumsily overcooked. And despite a relatively vibey room, my view was watching the floor manager stand on the landing of the stairs chatting away on his phone for 10 minutes, while I poured my friends wine. I'm gobsmacked that Pete Wells gave it 2 stars in the NY Times.Simply put, this place lacks the soul of Locanda Verde and certainly has none of the finesse in the kitchen. It's an approachable outpost for the Yelp crowd and those who follow ""celebrity"" chefs.

The decor at Bar Primi is really nice - you feel like you're no longer in  NYC with the spacious feeling, rustic fixtures, and farm-like decor. We were provided a long oval table for 12 and had great service throughout the night. Food-wise, I love love loved the Meatballs (so good), Bucatini Lamb Amatriciana, and Cavatelli Salsiccia. While the dessert menu may appear paltry with just a few options, we went for all of them and even I was impressed by all three - Gelato, Frog hollow peaches, and Tiramisu.

The primi was actually the weakest part of the meal- the orecchiette with red sauce was very good, but my spinach cavatelli with veal was kind of a light colored, bland waste of calories. Maybe we ordered the wrong things? Would've much rather filled up on the antipasti (meatballs and eggplant bruschetta) and dessert (you MUST get the tiramisu). I could've eaten a bowl of the red sauce served with the meatballs. And a whole serving of tiramisu to myself... oh wait, I did. I liked the glass of rosé (the only one by the glass on the menu at the time).  The atmosphere is cute and trendy.

2.0,9/20/2014,"I was excited to try this place, Andrew Carminelli has some great spots, it's a restaurant dedicated to pastas and all things Italian -- how could we go wrong here? We went on a Friday night, expecting to wait at least an hour given it's popularity and it being a Friday night. As expected, the hostess told us the wait was ""a little under an hour"" for two people. No problem, we snagged a seat at the bar and had a glass of wine or two. An hour went by, I checked with the hostess, we were 3rd in line to get a table. Another half hour went by, no table. Another half hour went by, the hostess was just barely apologetic and suggested we go back to the bar for a free round of drinks or an arancini. Well, there were absolutely no seats at the bar, she tried to get rid of us by telling us to go upstairs to the 5 person bar, which did not have seats either.Over two hours later, we were finally seated. Those free drinks and arancini NEVER came -- the offer was taken away. Our waiter was mediocre. He never brought us our grissini and tried to hand us a dessert menu before our full entrees arrived. While the food was good, it wasn't outrageous and did not make up for the poor service.When we left, the hostess simply thanked us for our patience. Really? I've been to a lot of restaurants and understand there is an expectation of waiting when a restaurant doesn't take reservations, but when you tell us one hour, TWO hours is absolutely unacceptable. Had we known it would be two hours, we would have gone elsewhere.

We were pretty turned off by the experience but my table mates and I agreed the way a situation like this is handled says a lot about a restaurant.  The staff went about the night as if nothing had happened.  No apology, nothing taken off the bill, and nothing sent over and comped from the bill.After living in the city for a while I've come to realize this is an unfortunate situation that is unavoidable.  Restaurant owners/managers MUST realize the same.  Ignoring it and US is completely unacceptable and wrong way to handle it.  We said something to our waitress who sent over the manager.  He gave us his cards and said he really hopes we come back....not likely.",0,0,0,Maggie C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0

They don't take reservations on open table, but we came around 6pm from work on a week night and were one of the first patrons. The meatballs are a must! You can tell the sauce and meatballs are made with love. Not too sour sauce so you know it's been stewing for a minute, great flavor in the tender meatballs oozing with yumminess including cheese! Seriously, I would have been satisfied with another order with pasta. Amazing dish. And.... Ask for bread--- their bread is freakin amazing and perfect to slop every last drop of tomato sauce! I got the spaghetti and clams. Dish is spot on with al dente noodles, bread crumbs on top that blend seamlessly with the flavorful sauce and just the right amount of clams. This dish was perfection. The hub got the cavatelli with sausage. It was a great dish but a little on the sweet side with the grapes in the dish. It is a good balance to the sage and heat from the sausage but just not used to the sweetness if this dish. Our tiramisu was intense! It is covered in a massive amount of cocoa and the lady fingers are basically black from being totally drenched in espresso.

There aren't many Diageo brands at this bar (moment of opportunity!), so we got the Lambrusco (a lovely Italian wine) Sangria. For our starters, we got the prosciutto with melon, ricotta bruschetta, stuffed meatballs and mussels calabrese.

I loved ALL of them! The Fiore was very unique - it is a rolled pasta presented like a spiral. I've never had this pasta type and loved it!To fuel us for the rest of the evening, I got some caffeine!

2.0,8/26/2014,"Despite my love of Andrew Carmellini, I was extremely disappointed with Bar Primi.  The corner restaurant was charming enough in its décor and atmosphere, but the food and service were less than mediocre.  Perhaps this was why we were able to secure an outdoor table for two on a Thursday evening at 7:00 pm...Long, crispy, yet tasteless breadsticks were brought to our table, which I nibbled on while drinking my Follow The Sun cocktail.  This concoction of vodka, Cocchi Americano, lemon, and Pickett's ginger beer syrup tasted like a citrusy kitchen dish soap.  We started our meal with the Ricotta Bruschetta.  The crusty bread was pretty bland, and the ricotta was completely flavorless and in need of salt.  Only the crunchy bites that had been kissed by a drizzling of Sardinian honey warranted any praise.  The Stuffed Meatball appetizer was infused with a minimal amount of cheese, but the chunky tomato sauce was fine.  Being a casual Italian café, we thought it would make the most sense to share a few pasta dishes, but they were all miserably overcooked and far from al dente.  The Paccheri ribbons were in a briny and fishy sauce infused with shrimp, Cubanelle peppers, and Gaeta Olives.  The Campanelle, which I had been most looking forward to, was entirely tasteless despite the inclusion of Jersey corn, maitake mushrooms, and shallots.  The best of the bunch was actually the Orecchiette, but simply due to the inclusion of spicy and smoky sausage and broccoli rabe.  There were chickpeas somewhere in there as well, but they were not memorable.Our service was just eh, and the runners had no idea where to set down each dish, when to remove empty plates, and so on.  While I will continue to frequent Chef Carmellini's other spots, I have no interest in revisiting Bar Primi, a fact that is sad but true.",2,0,0,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640

2.0,6/16/2014,"It saddens me to say that I am fairly disappointed by my 1st dining experience @ Bar Primi this past Saturday night, which will result in my last. I was bummed Peels closed their doors after what appeared to be a successful run at restaurant-ing but figured whomever bought out its space would take good care of Peels' former clientele ... I was wrong. We should have known better when we walked in & the hostess said she could seat us right away @ a communal table. Sharing is caring so I didn't mind sitting amongst strangers; what I did mind was the freezing AC unit directly above the communal table, the pushy service & lack of tact from our waitress, the measly breadsticks offered instead of bread & the over priced, underwhelming Italian food. That about sums it up. Lets start with the excessive & strong blowing of the AC unit right above my head. Within minutes, I was frozen. The waitress said the restaurant could not control the strength of the AC so we really had no choice. Even the leaves of plants on the table were blowing. Brrr...Our waitress Jenny K. was suuuuuper pushy & tried up-selling our order to the max. Insisting that the pasta portions were small & that for 2 girls, we should order 3 pasta dishes at minimum plus appetizers. We stuck with our gut & ordered 1 appetizer (meatballs) & 2 pasta dishes. Jenny then asked yet again if we wanted to order a 3rd pasta dish. Why would you ask that?! We ordered an appetizer dish for a reason. The breadsticks were rather insulting - served dry with no butter or dipping sauces .. A bit of a stingy gesture. I would have rather had nothing than plain breadsticks. Why not offer bread & butter like nearly every other decent Italian restaurant?? Additionally, Jenny decided to take our breadsticks away for no reason after we had eaten about half of them way before we even had gotten our appetizer - why!! No warning, just took them away. The meatballs were on the small side but they were very tasty. Came with 3 for $12 & were stuffed w/ soft cheese on the inside. Recommended dish. The pasta dishes were a bit underwhelming & over priced for the portion size. The spaghetti pomodoro ($14) was a VERY SMALL plate of pasta ... it was good but nothing spectacular. Also came out cold & at least 5 minutes before our second pasta dish came out - good thing we were sharing or else one of us would have been starving. We also ordered the spaghetti clams casino ($19) - tasty dish but on the saltier side and only a handful of clams. My friend had about 1/3 of her wine glass still full when Jenny also assumed she wanted another glass. Again, pushy. We were contemplating ordering a dessert but could not find Jenny for a long time. We had noticed the group of 5 at the end of communal table complaining to the manager about the service (they also had Jenny) off what seamed to be a 10 minute complaint. Jenny was still out of sight... After the manager finished speaking with the other group, he proceeded to take Jenny to the back - but still visible to everyone! - and discuss with her the complaints of the guests. Talk about awkward?! So awkward. They were practically arguing in the back. Still, no one came to check on us. My water glass was empty at this point & I was annoyed. Then Jenny came back to that large group & apologized to them, but the group still decided to stay & drink more wine, since the manager just refilled each of their glasses to compensate for their complaints. So awkward. She came to see if we wanted dessert but at this point her voice was quiet and we could just tell she was checked out for the night. We asked for the bill since none of the desserts looked too appealing and she didnt take the time to explain them to us. Such a shame... We were craving sweets but left unsatisfied.  Alas, after writing out this long rant, I am confident I won't be back.

3.0,6/11/2014,"I agree with some of the reviews below.  Overpriced and small portions.  The upstairs is cute and has a nice mood, however the food is nothing to rave about.  I ordered the Bronzino which was delicious, however my girlfriends were not thrilled of their meals.",1,0,0,Amanda F.,"Nassau, NY",89,27,1

2.0,6/8/2014,"4 stars for the food, minus 2 stars for poor value and overall stingy vibe of the restaurant. My wife and I ate at Bar Primi on Saturday night. Walked in at 7:30 no problems getting a table. Service was good - lots of staff. First warning that something might be off was when we asked the waiter which pastas he would recommend and he mentioned several times that the portions were very small. At least he told us - so we ordered 3 pastas to share for the two of us. First off we were served 3 thin pencil sized breadsticks which tasted fine but kind of stingy and they should be serving bread. We ordered the burrata bruschetta appetizer - which to be fair the server again warned us was tiny as we ordered it - and was a tasty bite.  That said the price of this appetizer should really be $6 or less - as a comparison it was smaller than half the size you would see at inoteca or dell'anima. For pasta we ordered the cavatelli, the bucatini, and the pappardelle. We liked them in about that order. The cavatelli especially was very good and unique.  That said, the pastas should either be priced around $11-12 as is, or double the portion size. Even with 3 pastas we were not really full.  (We are both normal/thin people)Also, there were no paper towels in the bathroom, just an air blow dryer - again contributing to the stingy vibe of the restaurant. Another funny thing, after we finished dinner we went down the street to dbgb for drinks and dessert and noticed the couple from the table next to us at bar primi enjoying a second dinner at dbgb, so they must have left hungry, too.",3,3,1,Smitty J.,"Greenwich Village, Manhattan, NY",1,1,0
3.0,6/7/2014,Rip. Off.I live in New York and understand things are expensive AND I don't mind spending money in a great meal. This was insulting. Two tiny pieces of bruschetta for $9. Primi plates that don't satisfy so you need to order more. The orchiette with broccoli rabe and pea with farro salad were delicious but didn't make up for the average nature of everything else. The octopus pasta had 3 tiny pieces of protein. And those breadsticks were insulting.,2,2,1,erin b.,"San Francisco, CA",22,8,4
4.0,6/3/2014,"The upstairs layout is more comfortable then Peels which it replaces . The staff was very friendly and helpful . My one complaint was that there was no meat or fish options for a main course . Trying to go light on carbs . But the chef is known for pasta soo... We enjoyed everything but nothing stood  ; the stuffed meatball starter , The pasta with artichokes and can't remember my friends pasta . The strawberry dessert was a nice surprise . Very light and refreshing for summer . It was tart ( which I love ) interesting crispy bits , meringue ?  The most memorable dish of the evening . A hit for us both .  Unfortunately, My friend was still hungry since the pasta  main dishes were small . I must admit I ended getting a snack later too. I have been generous with the stars  because it  has been open less then a week I the stars. We expect it will improve. I've enjoyed locande verde and his other restaurants and hope it will catch up .",1,0,1,Lynn F.,"Manhattan, NY",7,98,44
4.0,5/23/2014,"Good riddance to the subpar Peels, and welcome to the new spot in its place, the excellent Bar Primi.Just like the other hot spots from Andrew Carmellini such as The Dutch, Locanda Verde and Lafayette, the food here is delicious:- BreadsticksThis is my one major complaint here - instead of starting you off with some bread, they bring you a few breadsticks, which while quite tasty, are no substitute, especially in an Italian joint that's heavy on the pasta.- Eggplant Bruschetta ($8)Longing for some bread, we decided to try this, which was a pretty tasty, heavy bite. There were two pieces of crust bread loaded with a ton of oily, delicious eggplant.- Stuffed Meatballs ($12 for 3)This is the must order appetizer - 3 piping hot, firm delicious meatballs stuffed with cheese. Yes, the perfectly snappy, dense balls are also stuffed with cheese. Delicious.- Linguini ($14)With breadcrumbs and ""4 cloves of garlic"", this is perfect for a married couple, but maybe not if you are on a date. If you like garlic, this is a must. The linguini is perfectly al dente and so delicious with the big chunks of garlic swimming in the oily bottom. This was probably the best of the pastas we tried.- Bucatini ($18)With veal amatriciana, this is another delicious choice, and probably a bit more interesting than the regular Spaghetti Pomodoro. It's a bit thicker than a spaghetti, and is also nice and chewy and hearty, just like the Linguini.- Orecchiette ($16)One of the best combos, this was a great rendition of the typical dish with sausage and broccoli rabe. As a slight spin here, there were chickpeas as well, which added even more flavor and a nice pop to the dish.- The Sandwich ($14)The lone sandwich on the menu, hence named ""The Sandwich"", this was a delicious little roast beef sandwich with provolone, peppers and arugula. The bun is so squishy and soft, and is the perfect vehicle for the equally soft and delicious rare roast beef. This is a definite must to go with your pastas.- Tiramisu ($7)Wow, this was easily one of the best slices of Tiramisu I've ever had. So smooth with a great, deep coffee flavor. You must make sure to end the meal with this.Service was perfect throughout. It's a beautiful spot, with two packed floors. All of the food was quite tasty, but nothing was really a major standout, like some of the famous dishes at his other spots (e.g. Fried Chicken at The Dutch, Sheep's Milk Ricotta at Locanda Verde, etc.). This is definitely on its way to becoming another hit for Carmellini, and a popular neighborhood spot in no time.",19,8,12,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1694,69834
