1.0,4/30/2019,"Absolutely superb.  Walked in at 8:30 am and was quickly seated.   Restaurant around half full.  At 8:40 a waiter came by to pour lukewarm water and ask what I wanted.  I ordered and he took my coffee cup.  I mentioned I would like coffee, and a sparkling water.  At 8:50 I looked over and he was being dressed down by another table.  My coffee and sparkling water were still missing.   I left.  As I was leaving, nobody said anything. I highly, highly recommend this magnificent restaurant. I would imagine other diners do as well.",0,0,0,Moses H.,"Chicago, IL",0,28,2
1.0,4/11/2019,"This experience honestly just blew my mind. We had a dinner party of four and ordered quite a bit of food. We enjoyed the dishes we ordered but in general were pretty underwhelmed with the service. We could only order when we flagged down our waiter, an older Asian gentleman; we could only get our dishes after flagging him down to remind him we ordered and were patiently waiting for our food; we could only order more after being pressing, which seemed to upset our waiter. But were we not there to eat?It was overall something we were willing to overlook. The issue lies at the end of the night. Finally things at the restaurant were turning down for the night as only a few parties remained. We figured it was the perfect time to order one last round of drinks and go home - and we checked for common courtesy, they were still open for a little under an hour and were serving all drinks. Our waiter said he would let the closing staff know as he was leaving. We waited for 20 minutes and our waiter was clearly now gone. The only remaining staff were mingling with one another, so we attempted getting the attention of a staff member, most diverting their eyes as they had no interest other than going home. Finally, we got a young man's attention and he said he would notify another worker. He spoke to a young woman who looked thoroughly confused and thus continued organizing tables. At this point it had been over half an hour, the restaurant was close to closing, so we ultimately realized we must have been ignored and wanted to leave. A short, pale woman with long brown hair in a ponytail and black glasses stormed up and asked if we were leaving without our drinks. We tried explaining how our efforts to get someone's attention received no fruitful response and ultimately wanted to go home. She kept forcefully asking, ""So you don't want the drinks?! Do you know how long it takes to make an espresso?!"" Honey, not 40 minutes. She threw her hands up and stormed off. I've never met someone more unpleasant in my whole life. I never even want to step foot in this establishment again. After all we ordered, this is how they treat customers? Even if we ordered one item, they should have apologized for their negligence. Is that type of woman the kind you want representing your establishment? Naples 45, please let me know. I'm letting you know how horrible she treats others.",0,1,0,Isabella S.,"New York, NY",0,4,0

4.0,1/19/2019,"The location is great for lunch near the office since it's right near Grand Central on Park Ave. We ordered the large margherita pizza and it was absolutely delicious.

4.0,1/19/2019,"Still serving up a decent pie after all of these years!! As a convenient cavernous meeting place in the heart of mid-town, Naples 45 still delivers on giving its patrons a place to fill up on drinks and food before our commute home (for us bridge/tunnel folk) I like the doughy texture of their pizza but i wish they would acknowledge requests for a ""well done"" pie -- Anyway, if you are in a pinch and are trying to organize a large group, Naples is a good place to try...",4,1,1,Thomas M.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",126,111,67
3.0,1/16/2019,"I entered this restaurant for the first time for an early appointment.  The restaurant which has a fairly large dining room with a fairly large bar area was practically empty. The restaurant had a cafeteria layout with a Italian Mediterranean flare. We sat by the street window to entertain ourselves with the street walkers while discussing a sensitive business subject. I can only comment slightly on the food since I only indulge in a small bite with coffee.  But within thirty minutes of our arrival, it seemed the place did not have a table available.  Definitely hot spot for lunch in the area.

4.0,1/6/2019,"This was at once one of the weirdest dining experiences I have had and also best management experiences I have had. Naples has a huge dining area and is good to bring work groups to as we had. We were a table of eight on a fairly quite day at the restaurant. We were immediately concerned with our waiters behavior as it took an unprecedented amount of time to get our drinks. Finally after one of the peoples drinks-- a flight of beer-- did not arrive after 25 min we asked another waiter. At this time our waiter arrived with the flight and dropped it on the girl and me as I was sitting next to her. The glass shattered and beer spilt all over us. Once we got the attention of the manager they moved our whole party, gave us a new amazing and attentive waiter and ended up comping our whole meal which was above and beyond. I was impressed by how management handled the situation. The menu here is a bit pricey for what it is but this is true with many places in this area catering the bankers in midtown. They have a good drink selection and service is fast so it is a good week day lunch spot.",0,0,0,Davis T.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",215,82,26
3.0,12/17/2018,"If you're in GC and need a place to go for a meal but don't want to leave the building, I would recommend this place. But otherwise I would recommend walking around and finding other options in the neighborhood. The place is large and bustling, which can make it a bit too loud at times. But the service is generally good. UPDATE: pizza oven is back and the pizza is pretty solid- I would recommend the margherita piccante pizza. It has a nice kick which made it unique. We also got the chicken salad, which was just OK. It was a bit bland, so I wouldn't recommend it.Overall, I'll probably find myself back here at some point given my proximity but it will be because I'm too lazy to find another place.

3.0,12/13/2018,"Have attended a number of holiday parties here over the years. I always enjoy the food selection and the atmosphere. I was disappointed by this year's dessert selection and their not being any coffee or tea served with it. A friend of mine asked a waiter if she could have some coffee and she was told to ""go to Starbucks"" I thought that was very rude and uncalled for. In past years a coffee station was set up, so not sure what happened this year. For dessert itself, cookies and brownies were served.

I hope they fix it soon because I'd like to try their pizza. I came here for lunch because it's so close to the office. Although, I couldn't get their pizza I got their penne with roma tomatoes, garlic, burrata, and basil. I thought the pasta was solid but I was kind of hoping for more burrata. I liked that they gave you bread and olive oil on the side so I could dip my bread in the sauce. Also, I kind of wish on the menu it said cherry Roma tomatoes and not just Roma tomatoes.

2.0,9/17/2018,"I didn't think I'd ever come back to this place for lunch but unfortunately my fellow diner apparently really likes this place. Even though I wasn't paying for it, I was still a little salty at the prices of these pizzas.Two small, flavorless pizzas for about $20 each. One with prosciutto and arugula and one with artichoke, ham, eggplant, and mushroom. So sad, so blah. At least the crust held up and wasn't soggy. You'd think the salty meats would flavor the pizzas. Nooooo. I would have preferred Dominos to get my salt and flavor overload.We also got the three cheese starter of various mozzerellas and burratas on cracker like thin ciabatta. The starter bread this time were bread sticks. Service was sweet, pretty on point. They have free margherita pizza for happy hour everyday.

4.0,7/29/2018,"I went to Naples 45 for lunch on Friday. We didn't have a reservation, but we were seated right away (we went around 12:30). We were immediately brought bread. The bread was not the best I have ever had. It wasn't warm and was a little too chewy. There was also oil on the table (which I will say, was very good quality). We ordered a few appetizers (burrata, trio of mozzarella, and chicken salad). The burrata was pretty good, nothing special. The trio was an interesting concept and was fresh and delicious. The chicken salad was HUGE. It was crisp, tangy, and very good! I would recommend this salad.We then ordered two large pizzas (the spicy one and the one with the ham and artichokes). BE WARNED. These pizzas are HUGE! One could easily feed four people. Both were delicious. The crust was crisp and chewy and just perfect! The toppings were plentiful. The spicy pizza was particularly delicious! It had just the right amount of spice! Overall, I would absolutely recommend this place for a quick and simple meal.

The staff was very friendly and helpful.We had:- Risotto Balls - average- Veal Meatballs - bland- Calamari - tasty- Mozzarella​ Caprese - average- Pene Caprese - this pasta was supposed to have burrata - there was hardly any.

4.0,6/25/2018,"Came here for lunch. No reservations but found seating outside no problem. They seat before the whole party is there, which is flexible and helpful. Standard midtown fare. Slightly overpriced in comparison to other parts of the city, but it makes sense given the clients (tourists and hungry workers during lunch hour). Food is good, but not exceptional. Service is what's expected: helpful but somewhat curt and a little rushed. It makes sense again given the clientele. We ordered salad and pizza, red and white wine.

4.0,4/16/2018,"We had lunch here, and each ordered pizza. I will say I didn't realize there was a walk-up to go counter for the more typical slice. But the sit down restaurant was great, and the pizza was reminiscent of what you'd get in Italy. We each ordered different pizzas, so had the pepperoni and Quattro formaggi between us. They were both very good, though I am not a fan of the flavor or Gorgonzola (which was on the formaggi pizza). It was also pretty quick in and out.It is quite loud inside the restaurant so not conducive to having a conversation.

3.0,3/15/2018,I have come here several times in the past and the place is always crowded (mostly likely due to the location). Naples has a standard fare of Italian food and the pizza is pretty good.

Never should someone want to throw away the crust rather than eat it, but that's exactly what happens when I buy a Naples slice.If Naples wonders why they aren't swarmed with people despite their perfect location and cheap price, this reason is numero uno.

It's described as ""Sicilian tuna, tomato, olive, fennel, avocado, escarole, lemon citronette.""  Sounded good to me, but what I got was a pile of lettuce, about two tablespoons of tuna, a tiny dice of tomato, no avocado and a very oily dressing with barely any lemon.  Let me repeat...$21. My friend's salad look similar but we wanted to catch up and didn't discuss our respective entrees.  Our bill came to $45 before tip for two piles of lettuce...no drinks, only water.  Terribly disappointing.  Definitely not worth it.

Yes, it isn't an everyday dining Location as the prices are a bit higher but completely understandable. I was in and out in 35 minutes. I timed it. I went to another ""fast casual"" restaurant recently in the area and it was awful. It took over an hour for a salad, I could never find my waiter and we never received any water. It was rough. I think Naples understands the working grind and the need to keep moving. For that, I say thank you.

As someone who frequently eats fish and gets fish portioned at fish markets, the salmon served was not a standard serving size, I'd say it was only half the size of the normal serving of salmon, and was essentially flavorless although cooked well.

I complained to the waitress and she offered to bring us a new one but we declined, but thinking instead maybe she would take a percent of $$ off the bill, but that DIDN'T happen.  The other food was coming out one by one with minutes in between each dish and not at the same time. I myself ordered the meatball dish - they were cold and I also found part of an egg shell in one of the meatballs.  I also ordered the POLLO Chop salad that was $21 SO NOT WORTH THAT! The grilled chicken that was supposed to be on there, was tiny diced pieces of meat, there were no apples and no avocado in the salad.  REALLY awful salad for $21, I could go to my regular salad place and get unlimited toppings for $8.  My friend ordered the chicken parm with spaghetti that ended up being $30.  There was barely any spaghetti and his meat was cold.After we finally got our food, no one ever came to refill our drink or ask how we are doing.  Then, when the bill finally came I was hoping to see that the waitress would have taken a little  off our bill, at least for our BURNT pizza, but no she didn't.  Our meal came to 35$ a person (no alcohol purchased only iced tea THAT WAS $5 a piece!) and this place is so not worth that for the dishes they presented to us.I have been here before and was really hoping service had improved but clearly it hasn't.  I don't recommend you going unless you want to pay a lot of money for horrible service and awful food.",3,0,0,Jenny W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0

The soda didn't show up, the calamari didn't show up, my pizza arrived after 15min and the salad arrived after another 10-15min.  When asked about the appetizer, the waitress forgot to order it.  So, for a salad, small pizza and a soda, the bill came to $42, without tip.However, if you have time to kill and it's a beautiful day, sitting outside is pretty nice (if you don't mind the construction noise and heavy traffic flowing by a few feet away).  If the service and timing of the food were better from the start or even after 10min, my review might be a little more favorable, but when you're there during lunch with other people...it's annoying and the high pricetag doesn't help.So if you have $700-$800 burning a hole in your pocket, fly to Napoli and grab a few slices to go.",0,0,0,Rock G.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,33,13

A lunch entree range from $20-30 and a coke was $4.50. I wasn't too hungry so I just ordered some small plates. The mushroom polenta came out white with a few sad slices of mushrooms on top. I've never seen white polenta so I was pretty confused. It tasted more like grits, since it wasn't creamy or rich at all. My other dish was the Parmigiana which was supposed to be baked eggplant with tomato sauce. There was barely any eggplant, just the breading. The tomato sauce tasted like it came out of a can and the cheese wasn't even all the way melted. My lunch consisting of 2 small plates came out to be $20 with tax and tip.

4.0,12/26/2015,"There's no denying the food is better than average here. Meanwhile, there's little to no value. Unfortunately, the prices aren't worth the quality and experience. Sure, it's obvious why the prices are inflated: you're feet from Grand Central, it's a large, open restaurant - in Midtown - and with so many office buildings nearby and businesses picking up the tab it's no surprise why everything is drastically overpriced. If that's the case, why did I give it 4-stars? Because it should be. The food is better than average. But, when it costs me $34 (with tip) for a small plate of average pasta and tap water, that's a bit too much. And, $15 or more for a small starter salad? Yikes. On the other hand, if you aren't on a budget, you'll likely enjoy the atmosphere and the food. Naples is a fun, hip, crowded place to eat lunch or dinner that's popular with local business folks, who aren't concerned about price.

It took a while for our waitress to come over to get our drink order, so we immediately ordered the Mista salad and a large pepperoni pizza to share between two people. I was disappointed with both items. The mista salad was not worth anywhere near the $18 is cost-it was truly just greens with two tiny grape tomatoes thrown on top. As for the pizza, it was all bread. There were very few slices of pepperoni and they used sauce and cheese sparingly.

The mushrooms are not canned, the basil is fresh, the cheese melty and dense, and their tomato sauce is legit. I would up my stars if they would reheat slices more before serving them, but the slices are decently tasty regardless of temperature.

I came here in a late 3pm lunch and the restaurant was mostly empty. Its quite nice to see the restaurant is quite big in a such busy location right inside the GCT building.Service was decent for the fact that it was during slow time of the day. We had a salad to share plus a pasta dish and of course the sausage pizza. Salad and pasta I really didn't think much of them for the prices we paid. The pizza though was quite delicious especially the sausage. People might find the sauce and cheese lacking in taste but I personally kind of like this kind of pizza where it wasn't overwhelmingly covered in tomato sauce.Overall I think its a decent restaurant for some place so close to Grand Central. If you're stopping by the train station I think this could be an option if you fan of authentic pizzas. Prices were reflective of their large floor area though as I would imagine quite an upkeep to have such a large restaurant right in such a high traffic area.",3,0,1,Michael C.,"Queens, NY",188,456,2010
4.0,12/7/2014,"I happened to be staying at lower mid town (The Lexington Hotel just to be accurate) and I was craving for some Italian food. I remembered this place by just passing by walking around so we decided to go there. Honestly, this is my new discovery in Mid town (sorry Harry Cipriani, but you will have some competence for my business now). This place, for some strange reason is marketed as a Pizza restaurant more than an Italian. I think guys you are miss representing yourselves by saying you are a pizzeria. Here is my explanation why.First of all, the place is amazingly and impeccable set up. Is in one of the most famous buildings in Manhattan, no to mention, right a couple of steps from Grand Central Station. In short, the location is PHENOMENAL. The set up is up to what you will expect on a place in that area and the food is up to the game as well.Let's start with my experience there. It was kind of late for dinner (around 9PM.... yes, yes... I know... in NYC that's normal time for dinner, but guys I live in Texas, got the point? Thanks... let's proceed now). We were offered some bottled still water (sorry for those New Yorkers but I still consider tap water in New York, stinky and undrinkable). It happened to be an Italian brand (Panna to be accurate). They started with the right foot there. An Italian place, serving Italian water. After that, I checked the menu out and I considered it kind of standard for an Italian Restaurant but they do offer some specials. My wife ordered a mixed greens salad and I ordered some pasta-faggioli soup as appetizer. Our 4 y/o niece, went directly to her pepperoni pizza. Once the appetizers came, I have to say, the portions were very generous (compared to what they serve in other places in the area). The salad was very good, although the vinaigrette dressing was kind of 'weak'. One thing about the salad. If you are not fond of the taste of sour green leaves (like radicchio or arugula) do not order this salad or you will be very disappointed on the taste (what happened to my wife, indeed). The pasta-faggioli bowl was decently sized and it tasted very good. The way my grandma used to do it (well, pretty much... but it reminded me my grandma's version of this soup). About the pizza, I have to say, it is the typical Napolitano style. Thin dough and generous amount of mozzarella di buffala. On top they added a very good and well balanced pepperoni. Our niece was not able to finish the entire pizza so I took advantage and eat a couple of slices myself. Up to here everything was going on wheels.Now we have the entrees. My wife ordered some Lasagna della mama (that in   my fathers language means, Lasagna the way mom's way) and I ordered one of the the dinner specials, which happened to tagialini with chicken carbonara sauce. Trust me, the taglialini were absolutely amazing. The carbonara was a little bit on the spicy side, but the texture (carbonara has to have some crumby texture due to the egg used to make it) and taste was very impressive. It had an addition of asparagus to it, which made the taste a little bit off a regular carbonara, but honestly I really liked it. My wife did not like the lasagna at all. I have to say, I did not even try it so I cannot say if it was good or not. Just take my wife's word for it and I moved on. She ordered the same special I have but she asked for the chef not to use that many spices (basically she wanted the same thing but a little bit 'unseasoned', compared to the one I was served). The chef executed it perfectly. It was the exact same thing but without the crushed pepper kick (to be honest, I liked it more with the kick than without it, but it was equally good).We ended our meal with some raspberry sorbet (very ""italian style sorbet"" indeed) and espressos. I was kind of surprised the bar did not have any Strega Liquor (google it guys, don't make me explain it here, please) but they did have a very good grappa instead.Overall, a fantastic Italian experience, although the prices are a little bit on the  expensive side, but taking in consideration, they are in one of the most iconic buildings in Manhattan and in a great location, I will say the prices is about right. I have to deduct one star from the 5 due to the fact, they have the same issue  most restaurants in New York happen to have, the service. They are not very consistent. Our waitress forgot a couple of things we ordered but she promptly fixed the issue once we prompted her. You may guess, the place was really busy and she was running from place a to place b all night... well, not even close. A couple of tables in one side of the dinning room, a couple of other tables right next to us (with a different waitress working them), and some other ones close to the bar. I think you get the point, hence the 4 stars. In conclusion, if I am in Manhattan, I have a new 'must go' place. For the rest, order a good bottle of wine, some pasta (stay away from pizzas) and enjoy the ride.",0,0,0,Rudy J. T.,"Coppell, TX",1,47,0
2.0,11/15/2014,"My wife and I went to Naples for dinner last night. Overall, we had an average meal experience at best. We had made reservations, but when we got there the place was mostly empty.. just a few people around the bar, which is probably expected since this is an after work spot.We were seated at a large booth and decided what to order fairly quickly. Then began our eternal wait for service. There were a bunch of servers walking around, setting tables, chit chatting, and generally doing things not involving waiting tables but showed no sign of coming to our table.We made eye contact with several waiters & waitresses, hoping that our hopeful stares will elicit some sort of pitiful response. After waiting for what seemed like an eternity, our waiter appeared. We ordered everything at once, since we weren't sure when we might be blessed by our server's appearance again. We ordered meatballs and a small margarita pizza. Before we could acknowledge the fact that our food was here and ask for parmesan cheese and crushed peppers, our server disappeared again to attend to the empty table setting crisis that clearly needed to be immediately addressed. We eventually got the attention of another equally ""busy"" server who was taking a leisurely stroll around the restaurant.  She was nice enough to bring us some parmesan and peppers. Our server noticed this and rushed to ask us if we needed anything - too late! The parmesan and peppers arrived in small plates without anything to serve them with.. too much to expect?Anyways, the meatballs were pretty decent and the margarita pizza we ordered was quite tasty. The service, however, left a LOT to be desired. Luckily there are several alternatives for pizza in the area. The food here is not bad, but I was extremely disappointed with the quality of service.Check it out, if you must.

I've only tried the sausage, and Barese. A large pizza is good for about 4-5 people so if it's just a couple of people try to buy a personal size for each person. Dessert here is pretty good too. Tiramisu is not strong enough for me but it's still yummy and the cheesecake is even better! The bar has limited drinks with no happy hour yet the bar area can get very crowded after 5pm.

They are also loud and un-scenic. Really, you may as well be sitting at a table on a median on the Jersey Turnpike at rush hour. (To be fair, I have not eaten/drank inside the restaurant so this part of the review is for the outdoor patio area only.)Second, most things on the menu are overpriced.

I imagine during a regular workday, this place is packed with commuters looking for food or drinks before heading to the train. The restaurant is very large (as is the bar) so I would image they could accommodate this crowd quite well.Prices were a little steep, but nothing that shocked me considering the location. We weren't starving, so we each ordered some small plates - starting with a burrata, prosciutto and olive appetizer. Cheese was good - the other items (olives, mushrooms, peppers) looked like they came right from a grocery store salad bar.I ordered a potato and cheese torte - it was the perfect portion, but a little under seasoned. My mom had pasta fagiole soup and my sister had chicken Milanese topped with arugula salad. No complaints from either.If in a rush - I might go here again.

I met with my friends after work on Friday night and had a reservation. We were seated in a round table for 4 that was placed right in front of the pizza oven where all of the pizza entrees are bussed out to tables. Because of that my chair was slammed into by servers ALL night long, with NO apology or suggestion as to where I could move my seat to avoid this. Also they were holding the pizza's over my friend and my head every 5 minutes when another pizza was ready to go out. Our server did not write down our order and 15 minutes after we placed our pizza order, she came back to our table to check the order-- aka she had not yet plugged it into the computer for the chef to begin preparing it. When we finally did get our pizza, no dinner plates were given to us so we had to eat off our small bread plates (and the pizza slices were obviously larger than these plates) and it took another 15 minutes to get my servers attention and ask for dinner/pizza plates and she did not apologize for the inconvenience. Also, apart from the service-- while we were ordering our dinner and speaking with our waitress, someone who seemed to be the manager walked behind our waitress and smacked her on her behind WHILE SHE WAS TALKING TO US. This was so inappropriate and really showed the character of the management/ entire restaurant. I will NOT be eating here again.

2.0,11/16/2013,"The acoustics of this restaurant are so terrible that I cannot give it more than 2 stars. It is piercingly loud at lunch and dinner times. If you're sitting across from someone, you have to shout for them to hear you, which only exacerbates the problem of it being too loud in there to begin with. If you're at a table of three or more, good luck trying to have a conversation. You will find yourself straining to hear and desperately trying to become a lip reader. If you're not there for any conversation, and your ears are hearty, I recommend Naples 45 for the convenient grand central location and the good selection of pizza and salads.

It's certainly the best pizza in the area but nothing I'd go out of my way to try.

When it finally came, it looked like she grabbed random pieces from other people's leftovers.  A huge difference from when I've been here before.Just because we don't order bottled water and drinks and a crap load of food for two people - doesn't make us any less of a customer than other people.  The service was extremely rude in that sense, especially since the prices aren't low here.  The food is decent though - no serious complaints here.  We definitely ended up with a bad server - first time this happened in my multiple times here.  The bathroom smells and they try to cover it with a perfume smell which makes it worse.  The stalls look like they came out of a run down mall.  Not what you would expect from the atmosphere and prices of this place.",1,0,0,KL C.,"New York, NY",2,34,19

Uh no.  But it was good pizza and not expensive so I'll probably go back if I need another pizza fix and I'm in the area.I also ordered a glass of wine and the pour was SO small that I thought the server was giving me a taste before she filled my glass.  I am in no means an alcoholic but for $11 a glass, I basically got a splash of wine that was gone in about 2 sips.

The pizzas are of the thin crust variety..and they are sureeee thin. They had nice chars too. Both pizzas were fantastic. The barese was a bit messy because the middle of the pizza was a bit soggy since there was so many toppings that made the slice fall, but the sausage was flavorful, and you can really taste the fennel. It is def a hearty pizza. The prosciutto tastes healthier, but probably its just as unhealthy as the barese since prosciutto is pretty salty and fatty and parmesan isn't that healthy either.Overall, the pizzas were yummy and were of the perfect size.

The crusty bread looked as though it would be terrific but its blandness disappointed.  The service was friendly, warm and efficient, though. On the wall over the bar at this upscale mediocre restaurant, were several quotes in Neapolitan inflected Italian.  I'll paraphrase: ""I'll dance to the tune of he who pays me."" and ""France or Spain (where I will emigrate to), doesn't matter as long as I can eat there.""Odd and ironic in a restaurant with the price structure of this.  Somehow I can't imagine that any Neapolitan who might have uttered these words would be caught dead in ""Naples 45,"" which, by the way, looks to be a rip-off of (OK, homage to) Norman Lewis's superb ""Naples '44.""  Read the book.",0,0,0,Stuart S.,"Toledo, OH",0,6,0

After our original plan was foiled we stepped into nearby Naples 45 in the interest of time. A mix of shoppers, desperate housewives and office folk crowded the room that stretched back further than was obvious from the outside. This in my world is a fancy place for lunch in terms of cost. 10' pizzas are all around $17 and drinks are usual city (over)prices. The decor here was trying to be something Italian but we didn't quite understand the aesthetic. Even though the lunch rush was busy, the place is well staffed with many minorities bussing plates about. I partook of my share in a $37 large neopolitan square pepperoni pizza. Food arrived quickly but the waiter failed to remove the croutons from my colleague's Caesar salad after being notified of his gluten allergy. The pizza was good but worthy only of half It's cost. Although a decent thin crust with nice dough, there was too much of it. The cheese was equal to a dollar slice and for a fancy pizza I would expect a more exotic alternative to little pepperoni slices (i.e. parma ham or prosciutto - but perhaps this is a European's take on gourmet pizza?).

4.0,6/6/2010,"Naples is pretty close to my workplace, so on occasion I will be designated as the pickup person for a few pies for the group. There's always a lunchtime crowd during the weekdays, but if you pick up the phone and call ahead, it doesn't take too long for them (about 20 minutes or so) to bake a whole pie. First, I'm a fan of the rectangular-shaped pie - it's very big, and you definitely get your $20 worth for the pie. They are also very good with the cheese, which definitely tastes fresher than it does at most other places. I'm a huge fan of the crust as well - it's thin on the bottom (not as thin as I've had elsewhere, but thinner than your average slice), and thicker and the ends. I guess it's not a true 'thin crust' in that sense, but it makes it easier to get a grip on the slice.So why not 5 stars? You do not get your money's worth in toppings on the pizza. The toppings are always spread unevenly across the pizza, so even if you get something like a classic margherita pizza, you'll only have a few pieces of basil, and they will only be on a couple slices of pizza. I love my pepperoni on my pizza, but you get small, round pieces that come on maybe half the pie. A slice of pizza with 1 small piece of pepperoni != pepperoni pizza!

If I go to a Journey concert, I want to see Steve Perry, not some second-rate stand-in. And if I go to a place that calls itself Naples 45 - it better be on 45th Street and it better be reminiscent of Naples.Naples 45 is inside the MetLife building and the exterior is inviting but screams suburban shopping mall. Unless you're catching a train out of town or snapping photos of all the big buildings, why else would you be in this part of town? And as I discovered the other night, Naples 45 is not a destination place.The establishment is much bigger than it needs to be and gives off a strange combination of faux high class luxuriousness and local friendly sports bar. It looked like the bar could have been a hot happy hour spot, but I think the restaurant is past its prime because there were only a few people enjoying drinks.The service was reminiscent of a corporate mid-level chain (it is part of the Patina Restaurant Group). The server robotically recited his lines and suggested what he had to suggest to complete the 16th step of service or whatever. And no, if we wanted a salad to start with, we would have ordered one.The pizza itself is just alright. The margherita pizza had too much cheese and not a whole lot of flavor. I found the mozzarella to be rather salty and very overwhelming. The sauce was hidden underneath the cheese but damned if I could taste it. I had no problems with the crust. It was well-cooked and crispy, but also was missing an important element: flavor.We also had the prosciutto pizza with mozzarella, arugula, and parmesan cheese. The ingredients all seemed fresh, but again the problem was the lack of any real interesting or lively tastes. The pizza is about as inspired as the nutritional label of a can of tomato sauce.As for it being authentically from Naples, I guess I can't make a fair assessment, having never been to Naples. But in my recent adventures, I've learned a lot of what constitutes a Neapolitan pizza. And this is not it. They may use all the right ingredients and even cook in a wood oven, but something is missing here. There is too much cheese, not enough olive oil, and the tomato sauce is spotty and flavorless.

4.0,4/13/2009,"Noted by many as being the cathedral of traditional Neapolitan Style Pizza, the grandeur bestowed upon the offerings at Naples 45 is sought after by most pizza affectionates in the city of New York.  Despite the parity between ""New York Style"" vs. ""Neapolitan Style"", the age old traditional of preserving the essence of a foods' origin must be observed with candor.  Given this notion, a patronage to the highly renowned Naples 45 was conducted.The Atmosphere:  ""Atrium"" and ""Cafeteria"" are two terms often labeled to the dining establishment at Naples 45.  The edifice, which houses over 300 patrons, act more as a dining concourse rather than a fine dining establishment.  The Blue and White rectangular tiled ceilings produced another mundane and overzealous perk of the establishment.  During daylight, the vibrant atmosphere is observed through the various corporate patrons at this establishment.  The vivid decibels of conversation are driven by the lively colors of the establishment.  Sadly, during evening dining where candlelight is the mainstay, the color scheme produces a sharp contrast of what the restaurant is to offer.  The subtle and romantic candlelight is starkly contrasted by the bright vibrant colors of the establishment.  Nevertheless, Naples 45 does produce a platonic ambiance between patron and atmosphere.  It's widely accepted that the pizza here is the rave, not the outlandish décor.The Food:Piccoli Piatti (1) - Arancini:  The application starts with a Saffron Risotto Cake that's filled with Low Moisture Fresh Mozzarella and Minced Pork and Beef mixture.  The application is then coated with a mild Italian seasoned bread crumb exterior and deep fried.  At first taste, the Arancini (in conjunction with the tomato sauce) produces a subtle balance of flavors between all elements of the composition.  The texture of the Arborio rice risotto was an exception complement to the meat ragu.  The taste of the ingredients was lively as the subtle creaminess of the risotto provide a nice contrast to the saltiness of the meat ragu.Piccoli Piatti (2) - Calamari: Lightly battered and deep fried squid is served with a sprinkling of diced parsley and side of zesty tomato sauce.  The blunt textural contrast between the lightly fried outer exterior compared to the inner base of the Calamari is extraordinary.  The flavors of the seasoning were mild, with a light detection of salt, which greatly aides the smooth juicy texture of the calamari.  The mildly spicy tomato sauce accompanying the dish provided the proper tartness to bring out the flavors of the Calamari.Pizza...Pizza (1): Margherita DOC: The representation of a well executed Neapolitan style pizza is observed through this variation.  A thinly kneaded round piece of Italian flour dough is topped with San Marzano Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella Cheese, and Fresh Basil.  The application is finished with a drizzle of Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  At first arrival, the aromatics of the application were the first to be noted.  A heavy vapor of earthiness from the fresh basil works in affiliation with the mildly sweet San Marzano tomato sauce.  At first bite, the lightly delicate and savory flavors of the Margherita DOC are released in balance.  The perfectly charred smokiness of the Neapolitan Pizza is affirmed by the velvety texture of the Fresh Mozzarella.  The taste of the pizza is subtle but provides the tradition of Naples in the application.  The lightly sweet San Marzano tomatoes are balanced by the sweet fresh mozzarella and basil used in the application.  All of the flavors are further enhanced by the richness and flavor of the Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  Patrons will find that despite lacking the robust nature of traditional New York Style Pizza, the subtle and delicate nature of traditional Neapolitan Style pizza will wow even the most loyal of patrons.Pizza (2): Proscuitto:  Similar to the Margherita DOC, minus the San Marzano Tomato Sauce, the application includes Proscuitto, Arugula, Fresh Tomato, Fresh Mozzarella, and Parmesan Cheese. At first bite, the tonic elements of the application help to bring out the balanced saltiness of the Proscuitto.  During consumption it becomes stern that the application is meant to reveal the subtle and restorative flavors of a traditional Neapolitan style pizza.  All of the elements ranging from the Arugula and Fresh Mozzarella produces a vibrant feeling of revitalization of the taste buds.Notes on Naples 45:1) Tables are abundant, although reservations are a +2) Price Range: Inexpensive ($$), but the Piccoli Piatti are highly recommended3) Drink specials are available with an emphasis on discounts on bottles of wine.4) Enjoy!  The pizza at Naples 45 is meant to be savored, not devoured.",10,5,8,C M.,"New York, NY",266,454,791

I know people rave about the pizza which I thought was OK.  I actually thought there appetizers and mains were good.The fried calamari was excellent. I think my co-workers ordered every app on menu and from what I could remember, it was all good (too much red wine).My main dish was a rib eye steak and excellent.They got some of my co-workers orders wrong (although my co-workers can be really difficult) and were very quick to make ammends.

3.0,10/15/2008,"There is something to be said about the charms of a single proprietor or family owned restaurant. Such a restaurant has both character and personality, which are attributes missing from a corporate owned establishment, like Naples 45.Part of the Patina Group that additionally owns Brasserie, Brasserie 8 1/2, etc. the ""Ristorante e Pizzeria"" is centrally located next to Grand Central Station. The main dining room has a seating capacity of 200, while the patio can seat another 100 people! If only Di Fara, Totonno's (Coney Island) and Artichoke could utilize the three (word burning) brick ovens at Naples 45, a lot of arguments and debates could end right there and then! Though not about character, tradition, and personality... even though the ovens are named individually: Etna, Stromboli, and Vesuvius.Which is not to say that Naples 45 isn't bustling, or rather, erupting around lunch time. There is significant foot traffic not just from Grand Central but also from a plethora of corporate office buildings nearby. Naples 45 has also developed a reputation as one of the city's premier pizza places, certified ""DOC"" by Vera Pizza Napoletana. The certification is a reflection of the fact that The Ten Commandments of VPN with respect to pizza making have been adhered to. woodfiredpizza.org/recip…    Though, I am skeptical of the benefit of certification from an organization, that doesn't have brand recognition. To me the only thing that really matters is how delicious the pizza tastes. I've tried the Margherita DOC, which had a chewy and nicely charred crust. It wasn't burnt, there were a few black spots on the edges and underneath the pizza, but the crust wasn't puffy for me to really love it. Strangely, the 10 inch ($16) pizza was cut in 4 unmanageable sizes, and like UPN, one had to use a knife to make the sizes less than a mouthful. Despite the similarities to Una Pizza Napoletana (sticklers for tradition), this pizza was a better balance for flavors and neither the cheese (Fior di Latte mozzarella) nor bread (made using Caputo flour) dominated the taste. However, the tomato sauce didn't wow me despite the use of the San Marzano tomatoes. I didn't think the sweetness or tanginess came through.Service was efficient, and prompt. It was a well managed operation. That's one advantage of a corporate operation: it's always efficient and better organized than the competition. The routines were apparent (greet the customer, check in, ask about the food, come back for the water, present bill efficiently), and executed efficiently. Strangely with the emphasis on Naples tradition, modern management made it more like the Swiss (efficient being the oft used word in this review) than Italian, and reminded me of one of my favorite moments in cinema (from the Third Man), ""In Italy, for 30 years under the Borgias, they had warfare, terror, murder, bloodshed--they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland, they had brotherly love; they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.""

4.0,6/3/2008,"Call me crazy but even as a New Yorker I am a firm believer that thin crust pizza is inferior in comparison to Sicilian.  Much of this is because I grew up on homemade crusty, crunchy imported provolone smothered pizza. I could eat it whereever, whenever, and not a single thin crust NYC pizza can compare (hold on just a moment, I will be eating my words, quite literally).So the day my boss asked me to order 5 pizzas from Naples 45 I begrugingly did so.  We ordered 2 Margherita (plain), 1 Ortolano (veggie), 1 Pepperoni, and 1 Piccante (chicken sausage).He urged me to try some and because my silly self forgot my packed lunch in my fridge at home and didn't really care to spend the extra cash on another one, I went for it.It is pretty damn good, all in all.  The little old man who delivers is so sweet and soft spoken.  I'd like to think whomever made the pizzas has the same demeanor.  Now--the food-- the sauce was slightly salty, slightly sweet and not pasty (ie: yucky) at all.  The crust, though ridiuclously thin (I hate folding my pizza when I eat it; I want an ample mouthful of bread with my toppings) was well seasoned and flavorful.  The toppings (I had the Ortolano,) are fresh and you can tell they are with each bite.  I ate my in a lady like manner (read: inhaled it). and would very much enjoy ordering from Naples 45 again.
