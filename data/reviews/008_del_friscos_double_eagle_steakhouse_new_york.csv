4.0,4/30/2019,"Made reservations for 7:30pm and got right in. Service was perfect. Loudest restaurant I've ever been in though. It was crazy.   Lobster bisque for a starter. Delicious but a bit of a spice kick to it. I got the filet mignon. It was perfect. So tender, perfect outer crust and cooked just the way I like it. The butter on top added that extra flavor and creaminess to it. The hubs got the wagyu beef sampler plate. He said it was probably the best steak he's ever eaten. The different salts on top were amazing. We got the lobster Mac and cheese to share and I was underwhelmed. I wish we had tried something different because I didn't care for the after taste of the Mac and cheese. We were too full to try any dessert.",0,0,0,Erin J.,"North Salt Lake, Salt Lake City, UT",55,316,633
3.0,4/25/2019,"Very large restaurant and definitely on the nicer side. I was a huge fan of the lobster bisque -- it had actual chunks of lobster meat and the soup was great. I also really liked the Cobb salad because their basil dressing was really good. We ordered a few sides for the table: lobster mac and cheese, lobster mashed potatoes, truffle cauliflower, and fries. All were tasty but nothing extraordinary. There is also complimentary bread but I wasn't a huge fan of it because it's basically a sesame bun and wasn't my cup of tea. If you're looking for a nicer place to grab a meal, you can try this spot out.",0,0,0,Lillian B.,"San Francisco, CA",215,253,94
2.0,4/21/2019,"The food here is good, but the lack of stars is because of everything else. They cram tables together so close on the main floor that the backs of your chairs are basically on top of another table. We had a child sitting at the table behind us who was running around screaming like a maniac, hitting into my chair non stop, and the staff seemed to do nothing to stop the kid from being a nuisance or tripping hazard while he lay on the floor in the pathway of waiters.It was also SO loud that it was nearly impossible to hear the people at our 5 person table without screaming. They need to lower the music and put some noise dampening material around because it wasn't pleasant to scream while eating a $900 meal. Overall, to spend so much, I expect to have basic hospitality and comfort be much better than this.",0,0,0,Jackie B.,"New York, NY",97,149,5

3.0,4/13/2019,"Del Frisco's is our go to steakhouse in NYC. However our experience last night was very disappointing. This was for my wife's birthday and the service was not to the standard I'm used to. Giving the wrong steaks to the wrong people, under- cooked vegetables and steaks. After asking for the right temperature steaks for my daughters, they arrived  after nearly everyone was finishing their meal. After dropping $400 this is unacceptable. Quality Meats here we come!",0,0,0,Michael S.,"New City, NY",39,3,0
4.0,4/11/2019,Went there for lunch for lobster rolls . Very delicious - if coleslaw were added that would really make it perfect. The Malbec (by the glass) was very good. Crab cake appetizer had nice lumpy crabmeat pieces but $25 for one little ball ? Service was excellent as usual . The warm loaf of bread is too soft . Very sweet of them to throw in birthday dessert. Coffee was very good .,0,0,0,Cher W.,"Merrick, NY",19,169,73
5.0,4/8/2019,"I had done some extensive research for a good steakhouse to visit during my trip to NYC, and I came across Del Frisco's and its good reviews. So I decided to book a reservation for my Husband's and I anniversary dinner. And I'm so glad I did!We made reservations for 7pm a Wednesday night, and were seated within minutes. We were promptly served water, and our waiter came by to greet himself and ask if we would like to see the wine menu. There is an extensive wine selection, so finding something will not be a problem. My  husband and I chose a bottle of champagne.  Instead of having an ice bucket with the bottle at our table (limited space did not allow this), our waiter would take the bottle back to keep it chilled and would refill our glasses. A nice warm loaf of bread and butter was brought out to our table, and my goodness, was it delicious! Definitely hard to stop eating it!Our waiter did a fine job explaining the menu and answering all questions we had. Both hubby and I decided on the 8oz filet mignon, cooked medium. One cool feature is that the filets are served on these very hot plates, so if you find that that you need to have your steak a little more cooked, you can just cut down the middle and face it down for about 10 seconds. And you have the perfect steak without having to send it back! I also had the crab cake, and everything was amazingly delicious!Since we were there for our anniversary dinner, a dessert plate with a butter cake and dark chocolate cake was brought out. The dark chocolate cake was really good, but that butter cake was just out of this world! No shame to say that we ate that huge thing!Overall, we was very happy with my visit, that we came back for a second time during our stay in NYC!  Once again, our expectations were met! I highly recommend Del Frisco's!",1,1,0,Heather R.,"San Jose, CA",78,135,299
4.0,4/8/2019,If your a steak lover I think this is the place for you! This was 2nd time eating here.  This time my boyfriend & I went with the Tomahawk medium temp.  So knowing that this cut of meat does have fat on it we weren't expecting just how much. My boyfriend brought to the attention of the fatty steak & I have to say they did everything possible to correct the problem. Btw we also had the potato au-gratin & mushrooms!

4.0,4/8/2019,"With soaring ceilings and windows, Del Frisco's Double Eagle has a classic steakhouse feel with warm, dark woods and white table linens.Clientele are mostly in business casual or suits and the restaurant was packed with the after work crowd.Great, friendly service.  Our server, Chris, was very knowledgeable about the menu.  Loved his excitement about the crab cakes and claimed he's been ruined forever for all others, haha.Had to try it with that kind of recommendation... and it was quite good, a 4 oz lump crab cake with bell peppers, onion and Cajun creole sauce.The VIP was a fabulous cocktail recommendation.  Housemade Hawaiian pineapple infused rum made it taste like sweet pineapple juice with a smooth liquor finish.  Dangerous!Meats were done well here.  They accentuated the natural tase of the meats, from the thick cut bacon to the Australian A3 Wagyu bone-in ribeye. Our order came overcooked the first time, so we let them know and sent it back.  The server and manager were great with the feedback and rushed our order by ""borrowing"" from another table, lol.  That steak was wonderfully flavorful.For sides, the creamed corn was a twist on Mexican style corn with shishito peppers. It was creamy without a heavy dairy taste.  The brussel sprouts had a good char and paired well with the smokey, peppered, thick-cut bacon.The manager comped dessert for the steak mishap and as a belated birthday wish for my brother.We ordered the butter cake, which had caramel sauce, whipped cream and ice cream.Lastly, we had the chocolate hazelnut crunch bar.  Dense with crispy elements, it wasn't sweet and had good cacao flavor and texture.Overall, a really good dining experience, particularly with great staff.",1,0,0,Maisie K.,"Beaverton, OR",14,24,65

He catered to us constantly and gave excellent advice when we were having trouble deciding what we wanted to order. We ordered both west coast and east coast oysters (east coast are better!) and of course baked clams. Only thing is that I'm not a huge meat eater and I asked for my steak well-done. (Don't judge- just not huge into meat.) It came out closer to medium but I didn't want to be the only one sending my steak back so I ate it and it was amazing but I still would have preferred well-done. In general, the place is amazing.

4.0,2/28/2019,"I visited Del Frisco with a group of friends for an after work get together.  Despite being a Monday night, the restaurant was crowded and bustling, filled with mostly corporate types.  It was swank but down to earth, with huge windows, cathedral ceiling, soft, but not overly dark lighting, white tablecloths, and dark wood and gold accents throughout. The wine list reads like a phonebook, and was a bit overwhelming, but offered an extensive variety of wines at a range of price points.  We started with the crab cakes, which had huge chunks of fresh crab.   The steak was a bit salty, and I wasn't hugely impressed with their interpretation of medium rare.  We had a few sides for the table, which the server portioned out for us, which were generally quite good. I'd read rave reviews about the lemon cake online, but upon tasting it can't understand what the fuss is about.  The butter cake, on the other hand, was out of this world.The bill for 4 people, 2 appetizers, 3 sides, 3 steaks, land, 2 desserts, and 2 bottles of wine came out to about $175 each.  All in all, I'd consider Del Fresco's to be a solid New York steakhouse.  Not exceptional, but solid.",0,0,0,Emily J.,"New York, NY",23,168,192

Our group tried the creamed spinach, Au Gratin potatoes as well as French Fries. I preferred the Au Gratin of the three sides.

4.0,2/18/2019,"I love steak, and for each birthday I go to different restaurant that where the main seller is their steak. This year, I went to Del Frisco, and boy did I make the right choice.I came here with my BBF right when they opened. Seating was a bit slow, but I am sure it was because they were doing last minute prep. The concierge who sat us down was courteous. Our attendant, Justin, was personable and funny. He recommended the curd bacon and crab cake, which we got in addition to the wagyu long bone steak and the lobster mac. Everything we got was delicious and the crab cake was like 90% real crab. We also ordered a drink each, the blood orange manhattan and the habanero margarita. The manhattan was so-so and my friend's margarita was good but not spicy like she had hoped. After our meal we ordered dessert - lemon cake and cheesecake with butterscotch, which another person, Curtis (not sure of his position), took care of. The lemon cake was huge but I left was not sour enough. None of us was able to finished, so they backed it for us. Justin had also offered to back the bone of the steak, which I regret not taking up the offer. I should have gnawed on it at home in peace. Felix, the floor manager, made his round at the end of the meal to make sure the customers was happy with the meal. Overall, delicious meal and the restaurant was beautiful. We both felt it was a classy place, but also we felt relaxed and did not have to keep up pretense. Will definitely come back again.

My boyfriend and I were THRILLED with our seats as mentioned above. The only downside was the actual table. Not quite sure what it was... but the table top was extremely loose and wobbly. We had to be conscious throughout the entire meal fearing it would flip over (lol). Our waiter wasn't able to fix the problem so we managed. Food was good, but what you'd expect at any other steakhouse. Worth a try if you can get reservations or walk-in, but nothing crazy... it was solid.",0,0,1,Jennifer L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",4,41,77

I've lost confidence in yelp after my experience at Del Friscos last night. I went alone, I sat at the bar, bar was filthy, server was cool though.. but I asked him to please wipe down my area.. what the heck man. This should've been my sign to get out of there. I ordered oysters, Caesar salad, bone in strip, and creamer spinachOysters and steak were 3 out of 5. Oysters were the best part of the meal. A big part of the steak had chewy tissue and the flavor was beyond mediocre Worst part of the meal was salad and creamed spinach. The creamed spinach had so much cheesy cream and salt that it felt like I was eating spinach artichoke dip with a fork. The first bite of the Caesar was incredible.. but there was unfortunately so much dressing I couldn't finish the last half of the salad because it was getting me sick before the steak came. I didn't complain, I wasn't trying to be a hero and didn't need more food. Overall the place is probably more of a 3.5-4 star restaurant on yelp. Especially for steakhouse connoisseurs.

The lobster bisque was delicious. A little spicy and super creamy. I upgraded to an 8 ounce filet mignon and my first upgraded to a 45 day aged ribeye. Both were delicious especially with the king crab butter. The steak was so juicy and melts in the mouth. This is by far the best steak I've ever had.

4.0,2/4/2019,"Restaurant Week Review January 21-Feburary 8, 2019TLDR: Excellent place for restaurant week- beautiful setting, friendly staff, solid food, and affordable prices. Atmosphere: Came here on Friday for lunch looking to try this steak house at an affordable price. Immediately found an open seat at the bar without any wait. The place is well light (not like those old school dim steak houses), and has amazing floor to ceiling windows with a view of Radio City Music Hall. Service: All the wait staff were extremely friendly, courteous, and helpful!  Food: I ordered the 6oz filet and Caesar salad.  The filet came with a side of mashed potatoes- and overall it was great- filet was slightly on the cold side but the staff, without hesitation, would have taken it back. They truly want you to have a great dining experience. Price: Excellent price for service and food you get. Would definitely happily eat here again. Tip: For bar seating it is first come, first serve. High tops are also up for grabs. If the downstairs bar is full also check the upstairs bar.

Not only is that not the case here, but the waiter was completely snooty with no reason for being so cuz this place was blah.First of all, the only thing veg that was listed on the menu is the tomatoes and burrata salad. Being starving, I asked the waiter about it because I'm a little shocked at a tomato salad being served mid winter when good tomatoes are non existent. The waiters response was ""so you think a restaurant this nice would have bad tomatoes?"" My response was, you can't get good tomatoes in dead of winter. He said ""let me bring it anyway""... I was right, crap ass tomatoes, totally flavorless, ate anyway because was starving to death.Then I asked about veg entree, he said they could either do Caesar salad (ummm, any nice restaurant knows a real Caesar isn't veg which IMO isn't a meal anyway) and pasta primavera... to which I wanted to tell him ""any nice restaurant would do something more interesting than pasta primavera"" but I didn't, just thought it instead.

After some research, I chose to come here and I can say wholeheartedly that I do not regret it one bit! We were seated at a beautiful corner table upstairs that had an intimate feel and a good city view. The food is delicious here! I had a filet mignon trio (that changes every six months but was incredible at the moment). The table ordered the lobster mashed potatoes, lobster Mac and cheese, cauliflower with Brie and truffle oil, and potatoes au gratin for shared sides. Everyone was satisfied with their different steaks (and two friends got the octopus and the crab cakes respectively and also loved it). The drinks were also delicious. I couldn't even choose a drink and our waiter Chris, being excellent at his job, was able to recommend the perfect one (The VIP is simple yet delicious). After the meal, he asked if we were celebrating anything and I stated it was my birthday so he brought out a great combo of Butter Cake with butter pecan ice cream and Chocolate Soufflé with raspberry sauce and vanilla ice cream. The soufflé was light and not overly sweet. The butter cake, while being quite sweet, had the perfect crunch outside and soft inside with the perfect flavor for its namesake.

There are no words to justify how great the steaks were. They serve quality steaks that are seasoned well and made to perfection. You have to come and try it for yourselves to understand. Service was impeccable, but would not expect any less from an upscale restaurant. The ambiance is upscale and classy. Like most old fashion steakhouses, it is adorned with wooden charm but still posh and somewhat feels modern. It has very high ceilings and big glass windows that runs from the ceiling to the floor. The large windows allow for great views of the busy city streets. Despite being a large restaurant with many tables, it does not feel cramped or feel drowned by the noise level. I really liked that the restaurant is still well lit at night time. Perhaps, it is due to the bright city lights coming from outside as well as the non- overly dimmed lights inside the restaurant. Sometimes, it is nice to able to see the menu, food, and your dining partner(s) while eating. It also makes it a little more photo friendly.

All the staff were attentive but not intrusive.  Angelo  was our waiter and did a great job explaining the specials and menu. His description of how the meat was cooked led me to order my filet med- well and it was perfect. My husband ordered his ribeye rare but warm and it was exactly as he liked.  We both started with a cup of the lobster bisque and it was wonderful.  Several tender bits of lobster in a velvety smooth soup.  I was so happy that the soup came out piping hot - often restaurants serve bisque on the cool side so it doesn't curdle.  Next came the steaks. Just wow!  I ordered mine with the crab truffle butte and it was so flavorful and tender.   Husbands rib eye was topped Oscar style and he said it was excellent.   I had wanted to try the butter cake that I read so much about but didn't think I had enough room.  Our waiter came by to congratulate us on our anniversary and deliver a lovely signed card.   He offered to bring the dessert to us as a gift from the restaurant so we thought ok - just a bite or two.  Wrong.  He delivers this magnificent dessert sampler with the chocolate soufflé, ice cream and the legendary butter cake.  It was outstanding.  Like really one of those desserts you remember.  Warm and buttery with a cookie like crust but tender shortbread type cake inside.  Amazing!It was a perfect anniversary lunch at a wonderful restaurant with excellent service and food!",4,0,0,Vanessa S.,"Mechanicsburg, PA",4,27,16

Everything was delicious. The steaks were filled with flavor and were very juicy. The dessert is a MUST!! The ambiance is also very classy and nice. There's glass windows around the restaurant looking out with a nice view. The only reason I took a star away was because the first time my steak came out it was way too undercooked so I told the waiter to have them cook it a little more but not too much. When he brought it back it was more cooked than I would like it but the juiciness made up for the way it was prepared.

5.0,1/9/2019,"I have been told by many New Yorker's that Del Frisco's is their favorite steak house in NYC. After our glorious meal here, I can see why. Everything was on point, from the delicious food to the impeccable service. I surprised my fiance with an anniversary lunch at Del Frisco's. I had been craving steak for awhile and decided this was the perfect opportunity to treat ourselves. The lunch prices are not much cheaper than the dinner prices -- while they have a lunch menu their full dinner menu is also available at lunchtime. Honestly though, it's worth every penny. We started off with the crab cake -- it was flavorful and was a thick patty full of crab meat (rather than bread crumbs). We also enjoyed our cocktails - the classic Manhattan for my fiance and the VIP for me (a refreshing combination of clementine vodka with pineapple juice). Then came the glorious steaks. With steak, I think it's so important to make sure that it is cooked to your desired liking. As soon as the plates are put down on the table, they will ask you to cut into it to make sure it's right, which ours was. My fiance fully enjoyed his bone in rib-eye. I had the strip steak - it was perfectly flavored and a juicy medium rare. As for sides, would highly recommend the mashed potatoes! Even though we were stuffed, we couldn't stop ourselves from fully enjoying our anniversary dessert. The butter cake is out of this world - especially with butter pecan ice cream. The chocolate lava cake was  melt in your mouth good. Will need to come back to Del Frisco's for every anniversary!",4,1,1,Jess W.,"Manhattan, NY",242,347,279

5.0,1/7/2019,"Made reservations to stop in before seeing the ""Dark Prince of Comedy"" Anthony Jeselnik @ Town Hall.  Party of 8, sat upstairs after grabbing a round of wine and margaritas downstairs.  My first impression, the place is immaculate, the view, the cable railings for the banisters and the handrails for the stairs.  The wine list is expansive but we settled on some very good Del Frisco brand red.  The elder at our table was the only one who had a wealth of ordering experience here so we let him do the honors.  6 Crab cakes and 4 orders of pre-split crab leg/knuckles were phenomenal for appetizers.  Then came the steaks, 4 bone-in ribeyes, 2 double eagle ribeyes, two petite filets, and a few salads.  All were as good as they get & left nothing to be desired.  Finally, as our table was long on food/drink yet short on time before our show, we did a few lemon cakes for dessert.  What a great meal.  One of my good buddies visited a week later and sat with his S/O next to John Cena.  A great place that's worth the money. My final takeaway was the moniker emblazoned at the top of the downstairs bar ""Respect all men but fear no man."" A profound statement from an equally profound NYC establishment.

Consist theme for all steakhouse restaurants are mostly seafood based appetizers which I find to be biased for non seafood eaters. I had the pan roasted chicken and my wife had the chillean sea bass which she liked but wish the fish was more roasted or darker; it's a flounder kind of fish very white in the middle. I have no major complaints about this establishment make sure you bring you wallet it's a steak house near Rockefeller center enough said. Dress code should be formal although I did see some individuals wearing some non-formal attire. Lobster Mac and Cheese ""delicious"" chocolate souffle cake also very delicious.

We ate in a large party upstairs in the back room and had a street view. It was really special. I had the wedge salad which was much bigger than expected. My boyfriend got the Caesar salad and it was much smaller, so I definitely recommend the wedge salad (I was nice enough to share). We had a few sides I really loved the lobster Mac and cheese, the mashed potatoes and the Brussels sprouts. But of course this is a steakhouse and so we most looked forward to the steak. The steak is big! We shared a bone in prime ribeye and it was cooked absolutely to perfection, it was seasoned just the right amount, so juicy... literally melted in my mouth. I think at first glance the size scared me so I was so glad we shared one that way we could also have some of the sides. The service was superb and the VIP cocktail was refreshing and sweet.

Which came with the Cajun-Lobster Cream Sauce, that paired well with the cakes. Also there were only about two pieces of shells inside, if your like me, this matters !! With that I had the phenomenal lobster Mac and cheese ($18.50) It was a rich white creamy cheese lightly topped with crispy bread crumbs. The flavors were incredible. Also ordered some sides the were the creamed corn that incorporated blistered shishito peppers inside of it and also the sautéed wild mushrooms and pearl onions. Great texture and flavors here. I have no clue how they were made but I kid you not these tasted almost like steak. (I don't eat meat). Drinks - Patron Margarita's topped with Grand Mariner and a salted rim ( can't go wrong ) these libations were overflowing with tons of alcohol ok.

Unfortunately the tables were way too close together and I could barely get up without knocking against the chair behind me.We tried a few dishes including the seared hudson valley foie gras, lobster bisque, del's salad, del's jumbo lump crab cakes, and the 16 oz. 45-day dry-aged ribeye with a side of onion rings. Unfortunately, the foie gras was rubbery was the del's salad was really boring. Out of ALL of those dishes the only one that was decent was the ribeye (thank god, this is a steakhouse after all).

I'm sure you came into NYC with your family, saw the tree and had a meal here back in the day. Bully for you!This review is for the Steak aficionado. Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse is not for steak aficionados. I mean, they can charge the same premium price. However, when I'm given a Rib Eye with no marbling and yet fatty, its so not worth my visit.My wife and I walk into a dark, crowded restaurant. I made this reservations at least two months ago. We were shown upstairs, waaaaaay in the back. Our small, two top table doesn't have room for all our plates. The wack ass chairs are old and wobbly. I'm already feeling off on this place. Our waiter comes over , I asked him about a few of the different cocktails. My wife asks him about the creamed spinach. She asked if the creamed spinach can be prepared without egg? He said, no but you won't event notice the egg. We switch it up to a side of mushrooms. He leaves and I said, he's a great waiter. My wife said, what?! I won't even notice the egg in the creamed spinach? Who the heck makes eggs with creamed spinach in the first place? I now hate this guy as well! Total jerk bag, that proves they made a big pot of creamed spinach and they just shlog it out to their patrons. Everyone is raving about the bread. OMG! And soooo good! The bread is something I'd get at my local supermarket, just a large seeded Italian bread with whipped butter. It may be made on premise but its not what I had a BLT Steak. Just an average Italian Bread.I ordered the peppery steakhouse bacon. It was good, the waiter sliced and served it to each of us. No complaints. We also ordered a Caesar salad to share between us. First off, we have the bread plates to use for the shared salad as well as the bacon appetizer. Like I said, everything is off and the salad is just dumb. Coated romaine lettuce coated with Caesar dressing. A few croutons tossed in, dumb....... My steak and the side of mushrooms comes to the small, rickety table. I gave back the bread to make room. The mushrooms were good. The expensive ribeye was just ok, it wasn't what I expected. The reputation for Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse with me has flown the coop.

1.0,11/12/2018,"Probably the worst lunch I had in New York. It blows when expectations are so high, especially knowing the price you are going to pay, but this place was awful. The best thing we had during lunch, was the wine but the cockiness of the waiter neutralized the whole experience again.To be honest, I'm not a fan of American Steakhouses. They are overpriced for something you can do at home. Bit from time to time, they attract me and I fall for it. I think after this experience, it will take a while again before you see me back in a steakhouse.We entered the restaurant at 3:30 pm so it wasn't that packed. We were leaded to a table with one chair, apparently the staff promised a chair to a very friendly women, who stated that the chair was hers. They had to fetch a chair from the other side of the restaurant, while it was almost empty. We requested a table because the lady made us very uncomfortable already.When seated, our waiter started off pretty good but unfortunately during the course of the lunch, it lost a lot of stars. We ordered two cocktails which didn't arrive until we ordered everything else, 15 minutes later. To start, we had the shrimp cocktail. Although the shrimp were good, 1) I don't like them with the sauce already 2) the sauce was overpowering the taste of the shrimp because they were bathing in it 3) for $24 per portion (we ordered two), you would expect a little presentation instead of 12 shrimp on a white plate. At least ice and a lemon as is the TGI Friday standard. Wet naps would be an automatic requirement too for a place like this.For the steak we went all out and order 3 sides (Del's Uptown Potatoes, asparagus and sprouts) we went for the dry aged rib eye ($72) with crab truffle butter. The best part of all of that was the potatoes. The steak to me didn't had a lot of flavor. Because the waiter's attitude, I didn't want to say anything a out the steak because he contested the fact that sent the sprouts back because they were black and burned. The asparagus didn't even come at first. The waiter contested the fact that the sprouts were burned an kept on about that is the way they ""charred"" but eventually took them off and brought us the asparagus. I love sprouts and eat them a lot but these were awful.For $500 for two people, I expect a lot more. Both my companion and I travel to New York a lot and had better experiences for a lot cheaper.",4,2,2,Tim K.,"Charleston, SC",581,438,712

I felt that this restaurant was very crowded and lacked the ambiance of a steakhouse I enjoy when experiencing a fine dining meal. For appetizers, we had the tuna tartare, lobster bisque, lump of crabmeat and shrimp cocktail which was excellent.

The ambiance is beautiful and the very high ceilings and location views have a very NYC vibe. The service is very attentive but not overbearing. The staff works hard and every thing seems to flow well. The food as expected is very pricey. The meal began with some boring bread that I decided to skip. The crabcake is light and refreshing. Lots of crab not too much filler. Everything I had was delicious with the exception of the octopus appetizer that sadly tasted like processed/canned meat and was very reminiscent of spam. I mentioned that I didn't love it and it was immediately taken away. The signature VIP drink with pineapple and vodka was very light and described by the waiter as smooth. It's almost like juice. The steak was cooked to perfection and the lobster mac and cheese , and creamed spinach was the perfect side dish. Even the veggies were nicely done. Everything here is just a tad salty and is perhaps their main seasoning. They certainly  pay attention to details. I saw the staff polishing each glass for a long time.

I then got the filet mignon, which was perfectly cooked at medium and it had a good crust on it. It was also very tender. The mashed potatoes that I got to go with it was also really good.

4.0,11/4/2018,"Del Friscos's is a very good but unspectacular steakhouse. Service is friendly, but very inattentive and slow. The old fashioned 46 was good but just a little too sweet for my taste. I also didn't get any of the Earl Grey tea flavor. The appetizers we got were the foie gras and and wagyu carpaccio. The foie gras was good, but very basic. The buttered and fried (toasted?) bread added a bit of nice texture but not much else. The wagyu carpaccio was salty with a nice brine from the capers and some freshness from the argula. Both appetizers were good, but neither were good enough to order again. The highlights included the dry aged prime strip and dry aged prime lamb. The lamb was flavorful and superbly tender. It was perfectly cooked and sliced well. I'd definitely recommend this dish. The prime strip was really well done as well. The steak was perfect medium rare throughout. I would've liked just a little more of a crust, but still, a really good steak.

Would definitely recommend asking for a table upstairs when you dine there. It's tight upstairs (to be fair it's tight downstairs too) but for us was worth the space for the quiet. We started with heirloom tomatoes and burrata and it was AMAZING. We split filet medallions and brussel sprouts. Meat was prepared perfectly!  It was the perfect amount for the two of us to share so that we could have room for the lemon cake. Let me just say....I would have eaten this if I had just had a 32 ounce steak. To miss out on the cake would have been heartbreaking. It was the best lemon cake I had ever had.

3.0,10/22/2018,"Before coming here, and cheating on my usual steak house, I thought I was going to a upscale steakhouse in midtown, but walking in & seeing customers in sneakers, baggy jeans, and baseball caps on, pretty much didn't sit well for me, the crowd here is either ghetto, or people in suits, there is no middle, I really wish they were more particular when it comes to a dress code here. Besides that the restaurant is huge, has two floors, lots of tables, but very close together. Huge window with nice views, service was awesome! Wish I could remember my waiters name, but he was great, and extremely patient considering we were waiting for two more people to arrive. I do like that they have a nice cocktails menu also. My husband has the VIP and enjoyed it very much. They claim to have the best crab cake...so we decided to order two of them and the bacon for appetizers. The crab cake definitely isn't the best, I've had better, it did have a fishy taste to it, it could have been the lobster sauce on top. I didn't bother to try the bacon because everyone at the table said it was spicy, as you know from other reviews I try to stay away from spicy food. For dinner I ordered the dry rub New York strip, the menu has either ""regular"" or ""dry rub"" the dry is very expensive $75 for the strip, but since I'm at a steakhouse, I'm not going to order the regular steak. For sides we have the lobster macaroni & cheese, creamed spinach, and truffle potato, all was very good! The steak was cooked perfect, they did ask if I wanted a side sauce, which was truffle butter, it definitely enhanced the steak. The entire bill was over $700 for four people, just to give you an idea of what to expect. Would I go back? Most likely not, it's not my crowd, it's not intimate, it's not cozy, it's very loud, I will stick to my Old Homestead where I know all the waiters, and I can get a fantastic dinner for half the price!",13,9,10,Casey R.,"Brooklyn, NY",3164,580,1748

We went On a Friday night and traffic/no parking is to be expected. With reservations, the restaurant was very accommodating. The area we were placed in however was a tight squeeze. Even the waiters had a hard time walking around. The view of Fox News building and the news banner circulating latest news was nice to read while looking out the window but forget about backing your seat up, one inch and no one can pass. With a party of 10 we had two attentive servers. They were great! One was great with children and we had 4, this isn't expected in high end fast pace restaurants in the city so we enjoyed his patience. The food on the other end was mediocre. I ordered the sea bass, served with lobster fried rice and black bean garlic sauce. The rice and sauce great, fish not so much. On the table was bone in  ribeye and without. Steaks were great. And the crab cake is one of the best I ever had ! Cream spinach, which is one of my fav sides with steak was nothing special. Actually I didn't like it. The lobster mash was mediocre. The lobster tail had no flavor. My drink (patron Margarita) was ..... bland. For a steak house overall I wasn't pleased with the food.

3.0,10/14/2018,"Del Friscos was recommended to me by numerous family members. We were able to get a reservation on a Saturday at 9:30pm. As the hostess brought us up the stairs and down hallways to our table it became progressively louder. The room she brought us in to seat us had many tables but two large 8 tops. The patrons at one of the tables were so so so loud. Yelling, toasting, they were having a great time. My husband and I could hardly hear our server. We ordered grilled octopus- very good and huge portion (if you are hungry this is a great app) followed by lobster bisque and steaks with sides. We ordered a bottle of 2004"" Montepulciano di Nobile"" by an unknown winery. My husband and I had just returned from our honeymoon in Italy and stayed at Montepulciano. We learned of what goes into a ""di nobile"" wine and that 2004 was a very good year.  So although we didn't know the vintner we felt like we had enough background to pick a good wine. It was an obscure wine and the server had to bring the book to us to double check our selection-which was appreciated. The first thing was our soup was brought out (to share) but with one spoon. Server was super busy to ask for another so we shared our spoon and soup. The appetizer came after. We still didn't have wine. We finished the app and the server rushed over with the bottle. She showed us the label which had the correct winery and year but the type of wine wasn't immediately clear on the label. After we started drinking it we realized it was a simple table wine from Montalcino (correct winery and year- we think it was listed in the wrong section of wine list). We were a little bummed thinking we selected a nice Nobile and got a red blend. The server was so busy so we didn't bother her with this. I think she got the right wine it's just the restaurant described it wrong in the wine list-however I think it's nice to have the wine open for a bit before food is served and we got the bottle just before the entree. The entrees were large and cooked as ordered- husband got dry rubbed ribeye and enjoyed it and I got filet minion which was very good. We couldn't finish our wine bc we got it later in the meal but the server heard we just got back from our honeymoon and gave us Prosecco which was thoughtful-she was great.

Firstly, our server was very inattentive. We had to grab his attention on several occasions because he barely checked up on us. He messed up my drink order and also couldn't remember who ordered what. My $20 drink ended up being really basic and way too sweet.Another server came to bring us the complimentary bread (which was the best part of this place honestly, it was warm and whipped butter  yum) but he plopped the bread smack in the center of our table which was stacked with the menus they hadn't bothered to take away. Why couldn't he just take out menus away? We had to balance them off to the side of our table and serve ourselves. After they took the bread away a different server took out a little knife to clear the crumbs and for all of a second we were impressed, until he did a single swipe of the table clearing maybe 10% of the crumbs and just waltzed away. Talk about half-assed. Finally we come to the food. The $125 longbone steak was salty af. My friends steaks were similarly way too salty and I didn't taste anything else but salt because it was overpowering.

Throw in the lobster Mac and cheese, mashed potato's, and asparagus and you have an amazing meal. Also had the Blood orange Manhattan which was great outside the weird glass it came in. The only negative was the ""VIP"" drink. My co-worker ordered it and it was not good but I warned him since he ordered an $18 drink that has Sevdka vodka as the main ingredient!",0,0,0,Sean C.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",5,60,3

5.0,9/22/2018,"Wow, I wanted to give my mother a great NYC steakhouse experience for her birthday & Del Frisco's sure did deliver. Easily the best steak we've ever had and I've tried many steakhouses in the city.For starters, we arrived about 15 minutes late for our reservation and the hostess had us seated immediately which was great. Our server was amazing and was attentive to our needs. We had a nice seat by the window and the crowd wasn't too loud. The restaurant has a beautiful ambiance and the bathroom was very clean which was nice.Now for the food, we started with the jumbo crab cake and the grilled octopus. Then we both ordered the Bone In Ribeye and I had mine topped with truffle butter. It was otherworldly. My mother had the same without the truffle butter and she agreed. It's truly seasoned and cooked to perfection. Our sides were the Lobster Mac and Cheese as well as the Potato Au Gratin. Both were really good and complimented the steak very well.As I stated, I was there to celebrate her birthday so while I was looking for a dessert to get, the server comes out with the trio dessert sampler. I thought it was so sweet AND it was complimentary! So nice of them. Definitely would recommend this place for a special occasion or even if you just want a great steak but be ready to spend a pretty penny. It amounted to around $350 with tip.

We were seated and given a Happy Anniversary card that was signed by the staff, I thought that was a very nice touch that not all restaurants do. Unfortunately I can't remember our waiters name, but he was very friendly and made our dinner experience perfect. We started off with crab cakes and a glass of Rosé champagne. We shared the filet mignon, chateau mashed potatoes and lobster mac and cheese with a second glass of Rosé champagne. One word, AMAZING!! Everything was so delicious and although we shared our food we still had leftovers! Our waiter also gifted us our dessert and was very patient with me when I asked to retake our picture until it was perfect! The only suggestion I would give, is to have the drink menu online.

3.0,9/18/2018,"It was very hard for me to rate this place.  Partly because I'm not a steak eater, and it is a steak house.  My cousin had her birthday dinner here. I do like how the restaurant looks. Our waiter was also really pleasant. However, the food took a really long time.  Like I said, I'm not a steak eater.  So I went with the chicken. Figured it's chicken, what can go wrong ? The chicken was maybe about the size of your hand, if not smaller (definitely not bigger). It came with kernels of corn, kind of like canned corn? A handful of corn around the chicken in some sort of sauce, with a few half pieces of fingerling potatoes. . The chicken was soooooo dry and flavorless. I don't think I've ever had chicken that bad before. I ate half of it and gave the other half to someone. It was about 42 dollars. Absolutely NOT worth it. I can't even stress how DRYYYYYY it was.  My cousin (the birthday girl) ordered a porterhouse steak and enjoyed it. It was a lot of us so the bill was close to 1,000 dollars.  The waiter was very personable, and the establishment was nice, however I wouldn't go back. Definitely don't think the flavor of the food or portions were worth the price.",1,0,0,Mala H.,"WOODHAVEN, NY",0,54,44
5.0,9/17/2018,"Whew Chile,This food was sooo delicious. I know I haven't left a review for my fellow yelpers in quite some time but if you ever hit a rough patch know that this steakhouse will motivate you to get back on and write! To begin, the atmosphere is breathtaking and the floor to ceiling windows and dim lighting will set the mood for any occasion. My girlfriend treated me to dinner here for my birthday and I must say that I'm considering this to be a tradition. So before I get to all of the wonderful parts of this dinner, I will say there were quite some surprises that you should be mindful of,1. THE FOOD IS NOT THAT HUGE. This was my first NYC steakhouse experience and I can say that I expected the steak to be unbearably large but it was not. To be honest, the longbone was just enough for my girlfriend and I to share so I'd strongly advise that groups of 3 or more order more than one steak to satisfy everyone.2. THEY DO NOT PACK LEFTOVERS TO GO UNLESS YOU ASK. This was a shocker because my onion rings and bread were super delicious, and me being a snack lover, I always love my leftovers an hour later. I did have my dessert to go so just ask away!Now..... To the amazing and beyond!1. The Steak: Cooked medium well, it was perfectly cooked! The steak itself was seasoned nicely and was super tender. I did wish they carried their own steak sauce but it is not a must because the steak is juicy!2. The Crabcake: Woah! This was everything I've ever dreamed it to be. Flavorful and full of crab meat! My girlfriend and I decided to share but please, please, please order your own. It it wayyyyyyy to good to share, sorry babe.3. The Lobster Mac and Cheese: Just amazing. I could eat this all day, night, morning, in hiding, whenever and wherever. This was so delicious. I do wish there were more lobster but maybe next time AND THERE WILL BE A NEXT TIME.4.The Onion Rings: HUGE, like the word. You only need one order of this but don't overlook this option. It is so worth being on the table.5. The N.V. Rum Punch: Strong enough to punch you in the face. GET IT!6. The Service: Attentive, consistent and honest. Our server made us feel like we were at her home. She told us about her favorite dishes and made sure to follow up on each of ours. Another gentleman even stopped by our table to make sure we were having the best experience possible. 10+ stars for service, seriously!7. The Dessert: Complimentary, if it's your birthday AND THEY BRING A CANDLE! I was so excited for this. They brought out my chocolate souffle and a butter cake. My favorite was the chocolate but both were pretty nice endings to the meal, not too sweet and not without flavor, just right!Go to Del Frisco's and eat the whole damn place! Everything is delicious and you wont regret it!",1,1,2,Cassandra H.,"Brooklyn, NY",21,124,80

It was very sandy.  Don't know why there is sand on octopus but they were very nice about it.  Our server, Jose, was very attentive and friendly.  Entrees; 2 bone in strip steak. Both cooked to perfection.  Filet medallions cooked to perfection.  Dry aged lamb chop, it arrived as a triple cut porterhouse lamb chop, sliced of the bone on a sizzling hot plate.  It was great that it was presliced for me but it cook to medium well on the plate.  I wanted med rare.  I was disappointed and told the server I couldn't eat it over cooked.  He was kind and took it away to have it redone. The manager came over to apologize and said he will make it right and took it off the bill.  Very nice and professional.  I ate the sides while I waited for a new chop.  Had coffee and dessert. Cappochino was cold but delicious ily coffee.

5.0,9/10/2018,"Last night in NYC and decided to splurge on drinks and an appetizer.  I had their grapefruit and habanero margarita.  After a couple of sips, the waiter checked to see how our drinks were; my friend had a glass of white wine, which she said was was very good.  When he asked about my marg, I said I was surprised that it didn't have more of a kick to it.  He said they had toned it down so it wasn't overly spicy and offered to bring some habanero syrup that they had made; the additional syrup made it perfect--for me!We also had their crab cake which was quite good and it had very little filler; mostly just nice big chunks of crab.  We also shared grilled peach salad; kind of like a caprese salad; but with grilled peaches instead of tomatoes and with some mint and prosciutto.  When our waiter asked about our menu choices; we both said that the crab was very good; but the peaches in the peach salad just didn't have much taste.  We said we were from Colorado, that it's the height of peach season which are much more flavorful.  He said he would mention it to the chef; we said it wasn't necessary, and that we were just making an observation.Much to our surprise, when he brought us out check; the grilled peach salad was NOT included!Amazing customer service, great waiter, great ambiance plus great drinks and food--can't get better than that!  Thanks for a wonderful last night in NYC!",0,0,0,Pat E.,"Fort Collins, CO",8,2,0

3.0,9/8/2018,"For the price, this was really just okay. I knew we'd end up spending a lot, but nothing I had justified the prices in my opinion. Granted I didn't get steak because I don't actually really like steak that much, but my fiance did and asserts that it was mediocre.I had the jumbo crab cakes and the lobster mac. The lobster mac was good, but the crab cakes were kind of flavorless. I know this sounds like a somewhat humorous complaint, but they almost had too much crab meat in them? And by that I mean the crab meat to breading/sauce/things that taste like non-crab ratio was highly in favor of just... crab.

The proportions were perfect and the tuna very fresh. Crab cake is another one of my go to's. Del's jumbo lump crab cake was the best I've ever had. So much crab meat, very little filler. I shared an entrée, the bone-in filet (juicy & flavorful with no sauce needed) and sides of sautéed wild mushrooms and brussel sprouts. Both complimented the steak well.

3.0,8/16/2018,"I had been to Del Frisco's a few years ago and had an overall wonderful experience - however, on visiting again recently it did not live to its previously high standards.The restaurant itself is sprawling - I think there are three levels, and they have additional rooms off to the sides as well. Everything is done up in warm oak and leather, and gives off a vibe that is elegant and modern at the same time. A plus is since its so big and spacious, it does not feel stuffy or too formal. Securing a reservation for eight on a Saturday night was surprisingly easy, though we were a bit disappointed to be seated in a small room off to the side and not in the main dining space.Food was good - we got a bunch of appetizers but the standout was the thick cut bacon, which was deliciously sweet and spicy. I got the porterhouse done medium which was a great cut of meat and cooked exactly as I wanted. Others on the table got the filet medallions, the lump crab cake and the ribeye and everyone was quite pleased with their meals. Our server was the friendly fast-talking type, and probably one of the biggest hustlers Ive seen in a while. He made sure to push a lot of things we would not have considered otherwise. By the end of the night we found we had ordered way too many sides and sauces, all of which racked up the bill and went largely uneaten. He also asked if we were celebrating a special occasion (we were - an engagement party for our friends) and we let him know, but then he did not acknowledge the fact when they arrived. Also avoid the special cocktail - our server made it sound like the elixir of the gods but in the end it was just vodka with a hint of pineapple flavor.About average for a chain steakhouse and sure to get footfall given its location, but you're probably better off visiting one of the classic New York spots instead.",0,0,0,Melville G.,"New York, NY",124,361,697

5.0,8/11/2018,"I was surprised to find this place was *not* bookmarked on my hit list for NY restaurants.  I don't know how we overlooked it on all our trips to NY over the years.  It's really hard to miss, just a short walk from Times Square.  Big, tall glass windows, pretty grand and impressive feel when you walk in - a place that you would want to bring your guests from out of town.After watching a Broadway show, we walked a couple blocks to get a late night dinner.  Here's what we had:First, the appetizer bread was a stand-out - fantastic - house made, served warm, with sesame seeds and room temperature butter.  Wow, doesn't get better than that.PINEAPPLE COCKTAIL (4/5)  Their signature cocktail, recommended by the waiter.  I trusted him and I didn't regret it.  Would order again.MOSCOW MULE (4/5)  I make the best mules at home, but this one was pretty good.  Passed the test.BONE-IN PORTERHOUSE (5/5)  It was an impressive steak that we shared between the two of us.  Good quality piece of meat.  No picture unfortunately, but it looked pretty bomb sitting all juicy on the plate.LOBSTER MAC (3/5)  Lobster Macs are a waste of time in my humble opinion but I usually get strong-armed by my daughter who *has* to order this dish everywhere we go.  Nobody ever seems to do it justice.  Always too salty, over-sauced or something!  This one was decent though.  It's just not my thing, so order up if it's your thing and see what you think.CRAB CAKE (5/5)  Pretty amazeballs.  Not a lot of filler on this one, straight lump crab meat nicely seasoned with a little sauce on the plate.  What's not to love? Enjoyable.  Would order again.KING CRAB (5/5)  You have the choice of having this served warm or cold.  I prefer mine cold.  It came with three dipping sauces which was nice.  I could have eaten a bucket of these, but one plate was a nice start.  :)LEMON CAKE (4/5)  I saw this cake float across the restaurant several times on the way to tables of customers sitting around us.  Definitely eye-catching, nice-looking cake.  You see it and you instantly want it.  Kudos to the baker, nicely done and presented.  One of their top sellers and I understand why.BUTTER CAKE A LA MODE (5/5)  When we were deliberating over which *ONE* dessert we were going to order, the waiter couldn't decide which was better - the Lemon Cake or the Butter Cake.  So we ordered both and that made the waiter happy because he wanted to hear our opinion of which *we* thought was better.  He said he would wait anxiously for our report and after he served them, he kept impatiently checking back to see if we had a winner, and we kept telling him to give us more time to completely experience the two cakes and properly think it through.  It was kind of funny. For us, the winner was the Butter Cake by a hair.  That ice cream put it over the top.  Our waiter went MIA for a good while, but we'll give him a pass.  Maybe he had an issue going on in the back.This is a classy joint - both in terms of atmosphere and food.  I like it a lot.  It's a place I would go for parties and special occasions and for everything else in between.  Next trip to NY, we'll go again for sure.",10,4,7,Darien R.,"Milpitas, CA",777,739,468
5.0,8/11/2018,"What a place, in terms of service, quality of food and decor Del Frisco's deserves all 5 stars. The decor at Del Frisco's is fabulous and you get a nice view of the city through the tall glass windows. Perfect place to celebrate a special occasion.Service here was excellent, as expected from an upscale steak house. Our waiter gave us plenty of time to decide on the dishes we wanted. She was also very knowledgable on the different types of steaks and very detailed in describing the different levels of tenderness and flavors we would be get from each steak. It all started with a complimentary sesame seeded bread with butter. Then went on to our soup of choice which was the lobster bisque that was full of flavor with a very unique taste, it also had nice chunks of lobster which was an added bonus. For my main dish I went for the bone in prime ribeye steak which was phenomenal. I ordered the steak med-well topped with a piece of lobster and truffle butter which was very flavorful and seriously delicious. The server has you cut into the steak before leaving the table to ensure it is cooked to your liking. For sides we went for the lobster mac & cheese and the creamed corn, which were both out of this world. The mac & cheese was filled with a decent amount of lobster, too.Overall this place allows it's food to speak for itself.

Dirty martini and a simple bud light (came in a nice glass). For apps we ordered the tuna tartare- amazing as usual, blue cheese wedge salad very good! I got the bone in rib eye (highly recommend) medium rare. It came a bit to rare for me (my own fault) and joe salvo showed me how to cook it up a bit on the plate! Great trick! Like he said always better to have it under cooked than over cooked and it was quite delicious medium rare. With the main course I got a glass of Pinot noir that was delicious.

Good thing the waitress asked if our steak temps were right because the $55 ribeye that was ordered medium was brought out well-done.  She brought another one pretty quickly so no harm done.  But seriously how do you screw that up.  Overall fine I guess.  Steaks were good but not spectacular.  Nothing I can't do at home.Very extensive wine list if you like paying 500% markups.",0,0,0,Joe B.,"Cokato, MN",0,67,15

Our group tried to change our reservations to 12:30 instead of 12 and they told us they were all booked so be sure to make reservations! Even though we made reservations, we waited a good 10-15 minutes because they had to set up our table. For 26 dollars, there are literally no complaints about this place. Our waiter was so nice and funny. Also, Del Frisco's is probably the only restaurant that's participating in restaurant week that offers 3 courses (dessert included) without additional charge. What a deal!I opted for the lobster bisque, filet mignon (6 oz) w/ mashed potatoes, and cheesecake (strawberry) for dessert. The whole table got the alaskan king crab truffle butter to share.Lobster Bisque - This was actually really good. I wasn't expecting to like it since my first experience with lobster bisque at another steakhouse wasn't too good. There were a good amount of lobster chunks in it. I found a lobster shell in mine (and so did my friend) which was disappointing but I really can not complain for $26. Filet Mignon - These were a bit small but again, can't complain for the price. I got medium rare but it was more like medium raw. My whole table was literally like ""um flora.. did you ask for raw?"" LOL. They have you cut into the steak when they serve it to you to see if you need it cooked more but they left before I could say anything so I just let it go. It was still good regardless. My friend who also ordered medium rare had her steak way more cooked than mine. Mashed potatoes - These were the best mashed potatoes i've had. When I saw the butter on top of it, I was a little taken back by it but it was so good! Cheesecake (strawberry) - Graham cracker crust w/ cheesecake on the bottom and whipped cream on top. The strawberry aspect was just the jam to make the dish look pretty. I packed my cheesecake to go. It was too filling for me. Alaskan King Crab Truffle Butter - I highly recommend getting this. You can dip anything in this, though I used it for my steak. It is SO good. A little pricy as it is 15 dollars for a small portion but it is so worth it.

Let me just say, the Old Fashioned 46 at the upstairs bar was one of the best OF's I've ever had. Alexis the bartender was super sweet and as a former bartender, I can say she is a total certified bada** and was running that joint! There were idiots repeatedly standing in front of the wait station and blocking the path to restroom, with employees trying to get through constantly saying ""excuse me"".  I was struck at how polite they all were (when I wanted to kill people for being so stupid over and over)... it's common sense people. Don't block the service areas.We had the lobster Mac and cheese (omg) and an 8oz filet that was cooked to perfection. I will have dreams about that Mac and cheese. For real, a must have.

On Monday while dining , there was a minor discrepancy with my meal, none of which turned me off because the service was so amazing, however at the end, the food I intended to take home as leftovers was inadvertently thrown away. I wasn't the least bit upset, to be honest there wasn't much left , but I was in a rush to get back to my office. Upon hearing this , the manager immediately rushed over with Paul, and invited me back for lunch on them. I told them it was really unnecessary but they insisted. Today I went back, I was immediately greeted by Paul, who promptly placed my order (which he of course has memorized). My salmon came out a little under cooked based on my liking, they quickly rectified this and also offered me free dessert, which was so kind considering lunch was already on the house. I am so thrilled with the service I received at Del Frisco's and I will continue to be a loyal patron.

4.0,8/1/2018,"Haven't been here in a while and noticed a few changes in food preparation. I used to be obsessed with the crab cake here; always in top five crab cakes ever-now I've noticed that they skimp on the cajun cream sauce. This time there was very little sauce, making the crab cake taste somewhat dry. The thick cut bacon was still as good as before.While the 32 oz. long bone ribeye was perfect and cooked to the desired temperature, (it better be at $125) the 16 oz. Prime ribeye was served raw. They ask you to cut it before you eat it (I have never seen that happen at a steakhouse before). I was stunned. They took it back and returned the same cut open steak. It was now overcooked. SMH. Here's where I wanted to give 3 stars.The sides of lobster Mac & cheese and off menu lobster mashed potatoes (Mastro's are a thousand times better) were okay. Don't order any of the side sauces unless you're getting one of the filet mignons. It will be completely wasteful and unnecessary: the steaks are already heavily seasoned.As far as drinks are concerned, stick with wine or straight booze as the cocktails (the specialty martinis) are weak and fruity.

One of the few if not only steakhouse in NYC that offers the full 3 course menu for restaurant week ($26 pre tax and tip) without the optional dessert charge. Their service is great. We did have to wait 10-15 minutes into our reservation time for them to set up the table for us, but the hostesses were quick to get us settled in and our waiter was an amusing and friendly guy. Their complementary bread is really light and buttery, crusted in sesame seeds. No shame double dipping it in your lobster bisque!The selection I chose from their restaurant week menu are:- Lobster Bisque - there were pretty big chunks of lobster meat in the soup, which was very creamy and flavorful.- 6oz Filet Mignon (comes with a side of non substitutable mashed potatoes and butter) - the mashed potatoes were rich and buttery, perfect to complement your steak. I ordered my steak medium rare, it was perfectly cooked, a bit on the medium side. Very well seasoned!- Alaskan King Crab Truffle Butter ($15) - highly recommended sauce for your steak! It's very fragrant and comes with chunks of crab meat. Honestly I would use that sauce for everything and anything if I could! The bread would be wonderful dipped into the butter as well.- Strawberry Cheesecake - not overly dense at all.

3.0,7/28/2018,"RW Review. For the value you can't beat it, so many restaurants are only serving 2 courses for lunch. Del Frisco's serves 3 and it's worth every penny considering I've been and paid almost $200 for 2 of us to dine. This visit was $52.00 plus tax and gratuity for the 2 of us. The food:  Excellent. Regular sized portions for lunch. We decided to get different options to share and so glad we did. Highly recommend everything we had (please see the pictures). I'd give the food 4 stars. We also had the lobster bisque. Lukewarm but good. The ambiance: Friday afternoon before the lunch rush so not bad. We counted 9 times that someone came to our table to check on us including the waiter and I'm guessing what were managers. We also had 2 different waiters. Not sure why the change of shift. A little to invasive so not the place where you would come on a date. This would get 1 star. It was overkill. We couldn't enjoy our meal. My concern with the visit were the hostesses (5) when we entered. We were rushed to the bar and given an option of the high bar tables and told we couldn't sit in the dining room. Please see the pictures to show there were maybe 5 people there. When asked we were told there were 400 people with reservations. About 10 minutes later one of the hostesses came over and reluctantly offered a table and mentioned the reservation had been cancelled; same 5 people were in the dining room. About 45 mins into our meal the dining room started to fill but by no means were there 400 people as there were tons of open tables.

I ordered the Heirloom Tomato Salad and the Filet Mignon and each dish was inexplicably delicious and took me on a trip each bite.

4.0,7/27/2018,"My girlfriend and I came in today for restaurant week. You get 2 courses for $26 each. What a deal right? Everyone should go and have a steak here if youre around Time Square and are walking because you spend an hour looking for a decent parking garage. Anyway, I'm a plain guy and I had a water and so did my girl. We noticed everyone else getting bread to start but we didn't? Interesting, because I'm the youngest customer in your restaurant you don't serve me the correct way you treat every other person who walks in? I thought this was unfair and uncalled for. It probably wasn't on purpose, but the place was empty, so there isn't an excuse for not serving customers properly. We had the Caesar Salad and the Lobster Bisque. The funniest part of this meal was the starter. The salad had these long pieces of uncut lettuce. When I saw the plate, I felt like I was an animal in the jungle eating huge leaves and tall grass. Cheese and long, uncut pieces of lettuce... Is this how you serve a salad? I had to cut my lettuce with a fork and knife. Who even uses a knife when they eat salad?The Bisque was light and creamy. As you ate the Bisque there was a slight kick to it. I've never had a spicy Lobster Bisque soup, have you? I didn't think it was as creamy as it should have been, which took away from the flavor. Unfortunately, there was only four pieces of lobster. You would think there would be more considering it is ""Lobster"" Bisque soup.For the entree, I had the Ribeye (16 oz). It was cooked perfectly. I actually liked it more than Wolfgang's. This is the 3rd steakhouse I've been to in NYC and its hard to impress me when it comes to steakhouses. It was a little fatty but that's a Ribeye. It cut like butter, and tasted even better. There was a nice, dark pink color to it. The seasoning made it all even better. I was going to ask what they put on it but after I finished, I didn't care anymore. My girlfriend ordered the Filet Mignon (8 oz). She likes her meat more well done, but I told Cody, our waiter to make it Medium. When she cut into the filet, there was a scary, raw color to it. Our waiter then took her fork and knife and started cutting her meat for her? He told us the plates were so hot and are meant to cook the steak and her plate did cook the meat the way she wanted it. It was very good and juicy and not well done the way she likes most of her meat cooked. The desserts we ordered were the Cheesecake and the Belgian Chocolate Mousse. The Cheesecake was nice and rich! But there wasn't much flavor going on with it. It tasted filling and bland. Maybe I should've eaten the strawberries and jam with it? But I don't like jam. It was okay, but I've had better and can make better. The chocolate mousse was great! It was light and tasted like peanut butter. I'm not sure where that taste comes into play, but I enjoyed it more than the cheesecake. I don't regret getting what I got. We tried almost everything on the menu and I love treating my pallet with new flavors. To wrap up my review, I would like to thank Del Frisco's for the meal they provided. You can spend around $90-$100 if you upgrade your entree during restaurant week, but it's well worth it. A word of advice when you make reservations, make sure to specify and choose upstairs. We sat in the back, on the main floor by these escalators. I would've rather sat by the kitchen, so I didn't have to see people underdressed and people walking by me every few minutes or listen to the escalator while I was trying to speak. Lastly, this is an older steakhouse. I am always the youngest person wherever I go in New York, whether it's Carmines or Wolfgang's. All I ask for, is to be treated like anyone else. I would definitely return here in the future.",0,1,0,Joe B.,"Lebanon, NJ",208,26,60

The service was spectacular and very attentive. They have an awesome wine menu. My only negative experience is that for the prices are a bit high for what they have to offer. If you're going to drop about $130 per person, you don't want rolled silverware.

They made sure we were well attended to and that glasses were always full.  They brought me a couple different types of red to taste, so I could choose the right one to go with my steak.The food:  Excellent.  We had the crab cake with lobster cream sauce to start.  Then I had the 8oz. filet medium rare, which was cooked perfectly.  When we arrived, they mentioned they were out of all the dry-rubbed steaks at the bottom of the menu, which was slightly disappointing, except that I've never been here before, so it's hard to know what I'm missing out out.  Especially since the seasoning on the regular filet was so good and just enough.  We also had the lobster mac and cheese, which was delicious and included large chunks of lobster.  The cheesecake for dessert was also nice.I had been wanting to come here for a while and I was not disappointed.  Still one of the best classic steakhouses in NYC.",0,0,1,Lauren S.,"Brooklyn, NY",304,133,219

When we arrived we were seated immediately. I really was amazed by the ambiance!  We were greeted at our table by Peter our attentive waiter. He was such a delight. He checked on us and make sure we were enjoying our meals or if we needed refills on drinks. We ordered crab cakes, 2 orders of rib eye steaks with mash potatoes, Lobster Mac and cheese and creamed spinach. We ordered apple martinis and a martini that peter our waiter recommended to us...  the drinks were delicious... Everything was excellent... well except for the lobster Mac. I wasn't disappointed because I've been to many restaurants and the Mac and cheese was underwhelming. Ok so back to the lobster Mac and cheese at Del Frisco's.. I'm a southern gal so Mac and cheese is one dish that you have to take you time with and it has to be baked and seasoned well. I didn't get that with this lobster Mac. I wouldn't order it again.

3.0,7/17/2018,"Went for dinner with four other people. They have a magnificent ambiance. Attentive, courteous and charming wait staff. Locally sourced, fresh food. The portion sizes are as if you are Jack when he reaches the top of the beanstalk and is in the land of the giants. So don't be surprised that onion rings are $14 because they are enough for 3 people to make a meal out of!Some may say the spices used to crust the steak are too much and for salt sensitive folks and those looking to save on the bill I suggest ordering fish dishes. I ordered the scallops and some shrimp and they were plentiful, fresh and delicious. Although the crab cake was a bit small it was very good. Drinks: The specials are not anything to rave about unless you are having some kind of martini/cosmo (order the Espresso Martini). The plain drinks such as whiskey neat, wine, champagne, etc...are in order. Dessert: Flourless chocolate cake is normal sized but DEADLY. It is densely packed with rich gorgeous chocolate encased in fluffy but crisp on top perfection of a crust. Lemon Cake: GIANT. if you are not into sweets much then this is the dessert for you. It is pleasant but tame as far as sugar and lemon flavor goes. Which is not a bad thing at all, many in my party LOVED it. Personally, I brush my teeth with cotton candy toothpaste and alas I was craving something a bit sweeter.Butter Cake: If you haven't been to St. Louis you won't know the reference. It's Ooey Gooey butter cake's ""Big Mommas House"" I mean it's warm, big and crispy on the outside, airy but dense on the inside. It's buttery, it's caramel and then it's cool butter pecan ice cream drippin wet dream all in your mouth! Although, if you don't like sweet it will kill you. The food was excellent and worth every penny IF it was $100-$150 per person. But it was more like $200 per person. If you only order an entree and a drink or two/budget well you can scrape by with $100 per person but that is the minimum. As I said food was good but in a way it's less about the actual value of the food and more about the entire luxury experience.

The steaks are obviously the main event and we each had an 8 oz filet - my husband had it Oscar topped and my daughter and I shared a blue cheese topped one.  Both were cooked to perfection, fork tender and wonderfully seasoned.  If you are looking for the perfect steakhouse, this one won't disappoint.  And if you love a bone-in ribeye, theirs is a 22 oz. stunner.",0,0,0,H A.,"Hilton Head Island, SC",7,23,11

It's so tasty! All of the sides are also incredible, I love the mac and cheese and creamed spinach. They have off-menu specials too, and the ones that I've tried have been just as delicious.I ALWAYS finish my meal with their 6 layer lemon cake! The flavor and texture are just indescribable...

2.0,7/1/2018,"Terrible place to splurge. I made reservations for 8, (dad's birthday) and sure we were seated on time, but it was packed and an uncomfortable wait.The waiters was super unattentive. It took a quite a while to flag down someone to refill my glass of water,  to order, to get the check etc. The Del's salad looked like it came from Costco, but the dressing made up for it.. The carb cake... Was a pile of crab meat,  hardly something you can share. The charred octopus was pretty good. When my family received our steaks, I received mine overdone. They immediately took it back for a change. It took probably 20 mins for them to get me the medium rare steak I asked for. Which was mediocre...As everyone was being served sides, the server promised she would get me a side plate so I would be able to start on sides while everyone digs into their steak. But she never came back with that... so I used the leftover onion rings dish once my family was done with it. While waiting i tried my mom's steak, ( 22 oz  porterhouse) but it was too chewy to swallow in many places. We shared sides, they were also mediocre. We had lobster Mac and cheese, which just tasted just like regular Mac and cheese... Why put lobster in the name ? Oh wait... of course, obviously to charge more.We had the celebration dessert which was nice. We needed a family picture, and of course waving down an employee was impossible again. We finally got the manager to do it for us. We shared the desserts which they gave us small plates. my plate had some leftover greens on it... Took a few mins to wave down our waiter to change it.

I'm a big fan of fried calamari and when it arrived I didn't except it to have seasonings and seeds on it. Best calamari ever! It was sweet and had a little spicy kick (that could've also been from the other dish that had pepper on it. Waitress was nice and very detailed with explaining the menu. Overall this place was good.

Wine list and scotch list were both extensive so we were both happy! Lobster bisque was brilliant. Both chose 8oz filets, kind of our signature test dish for a first time at new restaurant. Hers was Oscar style, mine with Gorgonzola. Both were impeccable. Tender and the taste was delicious. We also had the lobster Mac and cheese. Plenty to share. Amazing. For dessert we had the Butter Cake with Carmel topping. Too full to eat it, so agreed to just one bite. After one bite, appetite amazingly returned and finished it off.

1.0,5/23/2018,"This review is directed to the restaurant management. I had a reservation for seven and was told when I checked in that a round was waiting for us.  We were brought up the stairs to the table and then were told to wait a few minutes as it wasn't set. After waiting for 10 minutes, we were told that a larger party was being sat there and we were moved to a four-top against the wall and rail in the corner. For our party, this wasn't enough space and completely uncomfortable. I told the hostess I wasn't happy and she said that would be relayed. No manager made any effort to come by and at least apologize for the mishap. And even more amazing, I checked the original round table later and it appeared that a party our same size was seated there.  This is usually my go-to restaurant to entertain clients at.

It was great they included a free celebration birthday dessert for us in the end. It's huge. Overall, you can't go wrong coming to this fantastic NYC location to celebrate any special occasion.

The food did come out staggered (we came in with a group of nine), and it took a while for us to receive our entrees and sides. We did wait quite a bit for the appetizers. Our friends ordered the aged steak which was amazing. Our server was great tho, I liked her. I ordered fillet and it was actually pretty dry (ordered it medium well), which was very disappointing. I also felt that it wasn't seasoned well and slightly burnt. For a nice steakhouse, definitely the worse fillet I've had unfortunately. It was sad because I was very excited and my expectations were not met. I do remember thinking the steak house at home is much better than this place, which I did not expect at all. I would come again, but I would never order the fillet.Update: the server offered complimentary dessert due to the food coming out late which was nice.

Yes it's expensive, but the location is beautiful (we sat on the second floor), the customer service is excellent and the food is hands down worth every penny and the best in its category (and I've tried steak all over nyc). The bill for the 2 of us including 2 rib eye steaks and 2 sides plus the truffle butter, came up to about $170 or so if I remember correctly. The most important aspect of this place is that the waiters treat you like celebrities, even if it's clear you wouldn't be able to afford the menu on a regular basis.

Probably not that healthy of a salad overall but I could see why people would prefer it. The salmon with crab hash was more enjoyable but overall quite salty. Our table also got the thick cut bacon (from the dinner menu), crab cake, lobster mac and cheese, and asparagus with roasted almonds for starters/sides.

Rachel (Rae) was our waitress and she was wonderful. She was incredibly well versed in the menu, didn't try to up-sell us for the sake of up-selling us, and she gathered an understanding of what we liked in order to make suggestions for us. She was honest with us and we never felt like she was reading off of a script. She gave a true, genuine, personal, real experience that we didn't expect.

3.0,4/1/2018,"The steak and sides were all very good. The specialty martinis were yummy as well and our waiter was always there when we needed him. I now have two negative comments...1) I agree with another reviewer who commented on what the female waitstaff have to wear.  I wanted to throw my coat over one of the women I felt so uncomfortable for her. A MICRO mini and fishnets? Just no.  It isn't a gentlemen's club and women and kids dine here, too. It frankly depressed me. We haven't come a long way, baby. 2) My friend ordered one of the specials. Now, I know it's rare that one is told the price of the specials, BUT if the special ordered (granted, Kobe beef--but not a large portion) is over DOUBLE the price of the average entree, I feel a heads up is in order.  Yes, $158 for her entree, with no warning and just sticker shock when the bill came.",0,0,0,Kathleen S.,"New York, NY",27,419,65
2.0,4/1/2018,"Sorry but if you're a steakhouse and my steak is almost inedible, 2 stars is the best I can give you.      I took my daughter here for a special ""we're in New York"" meal.  We both love steak, and this place had good reviews, so we decided to try it.  I regret spending one of our precious meals in New York on this.   It started out okay.  The service was good.  Our waiter brought bread and butter to our table.  The bread was still warm, but that was about all that could be said for it.  It had sesame seeds on it, but that didn't disguise the fact that the bread itself was flavorless.  It's a steakhouse, so I get the fact that people don't want adventurous flavors, but white bread can still have flavor.  I've been to many restaurants that have white bread with flavor.  This one is not on that list.    We got appetizers.  My daughter got the shrimp and liked it, though one of the sauces was a bit spicy for her.  I got the foie gras and loved it.  The toast was perfectly toasted, the foie was perfectly cooked with a lovely sear, and the sauce left me wanting more.  The crispy onion bits added flavor as well.  The fact that this dish was so good, was the reason that this isn't a 1 or 0 star review.  The portion size was also extremely generous.  I only wished that there was even more sauce.       I had also ordered a Mojito. (I know, it's not in anymore, but I like what I like!). I didn't like this.  It seemed like no one had muddled the drink.  I could see the mint and the lime, I just couldn't taste them.   I tried my best with my straw, repeatedly.  I never got flavor.  The drink had a huge alcoholic punch.  It seemed like the bartender was trying to give ""value"" by being generous with the alcohol rather than trying to balance flavors perfectly.  If what you want is a lot of alcohol, and you don't care what it tastes like, this is the spot for you.  If you want a well balanced drink, don't go here, or you'll end up leaving more than half of it sitting there, as I did.  The water was good though, better than that drink.    Then the meal.  My daughter got filet mignon, medium rare, and was very happy with it.  We also got the creamed corn, and enjoyed it.  I however got the ribeye, which wasn't so great.  I don't know if they were trying to hide meat that was just about to go bad, or what, but mine was severely over seasoned.  I tried scraping the seasoning off with my knife.  It wasn't able to do enough.  I ended up eating less than half, with repeated efforts to make it truly edible.    We didn't get dessert.  I no longer trusted this restaurant to bring anything I'd enjoy.   So in summary, this is a steakhouse, where I had to try to fix my cocktail and my steak to turn them into something I'd tolerate if not enjoy.

5.0,3/28/2018,"There is no question as to why this restaurant is pushing nearly 5 stars... after my visit, makes complete sense. Massive location, there seems to be an endless amount of tables, a decent sized bar but even more-so a beautiful interior. Initially we were seated in an extremely cramped section, like could barely pull the chair out from the table to sit down cramped. I honestly looked at the hostess like she was crazy for even trying to sit us there and even crazier for the fact we had to ask to be sat somewhere else as if she couldn't see that table was a huge nope.  We got lucky and since it wasn't fully packed (though still very busy) a window table, with plenty of space. Definitely upscale! I started with a glass of the Plum Rosè. Came with an edible flower garnish, beautiful and tasted even better than it looked. One of my favorite cocktails I have ever had. For our appetizers we started with the shrimp trio, a crab cake to share and the burrata. Everything was delicious, seriously not a single complaint. For dinner we ordered the filet medallions which I believe was a special. The plate came with three filet medallions perfectly sized each topped with a different ""sauce"". One had a truffle gorgonzola, another just truffle butter and in the middle, a lobster blend. I will say if I were to really nit pick the lobster blend was a bit over-salted. But the truffle gorgonzola, literally I died. First of all, truffles...amazing. Add that to filet and gorgonzola.....

3.0,3/25/2018,"Came here for my Husbands birthday, our reservations were for 8pm and we got there an hour early and they still accommodated us early for a busy Saturday night. They had a birthday card on the table that was signed by the staff which was nice and for dessert they have us a complementary dessert which others have wrote about, it was a nice personal touch. We had the charred octopus which was really tender and nicely grilled. It came with the Gigante bean salad that was kind of a weird pairing, because it didn't taste like anything special, just tomatoes and some undercooked beans. The octopus itself though was really nice. For the steaks we had the porterhouse and the 45 day dry aged rib eye. We usually share a porter House when we go out but it was kind of small for sharing. All their steaks are not dry aged, this is one that wasn't, so maybe it didn't have that bold beefy buttery flavor of a dry aged steak so we weren't expecting it to taste like one that was dry aged, but what was disappointing about this steak was that it was waaaaay over-salted. We took a few bites and said oh that's salty and couldn't really taste the steak bc it was over seasoned, but it just got worse the more you ate it so you really couldn't enjoy it and taste the actual flavor of the steak. Service was great but she never asked how our steaks were, you know the  usual ""how's everything?"" So we didn't get a chance to mention it. The rib eye was great, super buttery and tender and seasoned just right, so I was happy with that.  We also got the Del's uptown potatoes those were bomb, and the Brussels sprouts were ok, nothing to write home about.

Not sure how that's different that calling it ""getting closer to the expiration date"" but whatever. On top of those, they also do have a dry-aged wagyu steak as well.

Maybe it was just an off moment?It's incredible how this place manages to serve all of its guests...it's absolutely massive. Walking through upstairs, once you think the place has ended there are several more rooms.Maybe the high volume is why I felt the following: the food, while delicious, gave me the impression that it had been under a heat lamp, even if for a very short while. Or if not, just sitting for a little longer than it should have. It's hard to describe but it came through in the texture and even the appearance. Flavors were pretty amazing however, especially the crab cake app and Del's Uptown Potato side. The actual steaks (filet trio) were delicious and cooked to temperature, but I think Kean's steaks are far superior. Frisco's probably has better ""accoutrement,"" to speak like an obnoxious Yelp reviewer. Sides were a 5, but the main event just didn't live up to the hype.Service was on point.

4.0,3/20/2018,"The restaurant is huge! I really liked how grand the restaurant felt, it was a large space with great decor. This place felt like it was a fancier and sleeker version of a steakhouse since most people were dressed up, even the hostesses and the waiters were pretty snazzy. Our waiter was really friendly and offered up some great suggestions regarding our meal. Overall, I thought it was a solid steakhouse but I did wish I went with the dry aged option since the regular prime steaks felt like it was missing something. Even for a steakhouse I felt like it was more expensive than it should have been, I was kinda surprised how expensive some of the items were. Lastly, if you let the waitstaff know, they give you a small dessert combo for your bday.The food:Del's Jumbo Lump Crab Cake- Cajun-Lobster cream sauce. I thought the crab cake was good, it had a ton of crab in it and I thought the flavor was great but I thought it was pretty expensive and the portion was pretty small. I thought the sauce it came with was good, it kinda tasted like a lobster bisque. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Thick-Cut Nueske's Bacon Au Poivre- Bourbon Molasses glaze. I always order thick cut bacon at any steakhouse I go to but I thought the version here was just OK. I thought the bacon being spicy was kinda weird, I didn't think the spicy element and pork belly went well together. I also thought the execution on the pork was so so, the bacon wasn't as tender and it kinda had a burnt taste to it. yelp.com/user_local_phot…22oz Bone-In Prime Strip- This was easily the favorite amongst the three steaks I tried that night. In general, I always order any steak on the bone and I usually order a NY strip, both were great decisions for this cut. The strip was so incredibly juicy and and I really liked the outside char. The flavor was great and the steak was nice and tender. I would recommend this. yelp.com/user_local_phot…8oz Filet Mignon- The filet was my second favorite, I really enjoyed how juicy and tender the filet was.22oz Bone-In Prime Ribeye- I feel ribeyes are kind of a hit or miss steak and the one here was a miss for me. I did appreciate how juicy the steak was but I felt the ribeye was a bit grainy and was not as sexy and smooth as I was expecting. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Uptown Del's Potato- Melted Fontina, chives & shaved truffle. I thought this side was awesome! I really enjoyed the flavor, the cheese was so perfectly chewy and the truffle oil and truffle pieces were amazing! I highly recommend. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Thick-Cut Onion Rings- Yes, they are massive but the rings were just OK. The flavor on it was fine, but the rings came off oily. I also didn't care for the batter, the batter was so damn thick, it kinda felt like a corn dog but on an onion. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Creamed Spinach- Smoked bacon, egg, mushroom & aged Sharp Cheddar cheese sauce. I always get creamed spinach at any steakhouse but this was probably the worse one I ever had. It was so freakin bad that I only had two bites. The side had no flavor, and it kinda tasted like a cream soup that they happen to throw in boiled spinach. This is a hard no for me. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Lemon Cake- Six layers, lemon buttercream icing & lemon glaze. The flavor on this was OK, it just reminded me of something you get from Entenmann's. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Birthday Combo- Chocolate Souffle and Butter Cake. The chocolate  souffle was kinda a standard souffle, it was missing that hot oozing sexy factor. The butter cake was good with the butter pecan ice cream and enjoyed the crunch from the cake but I felt this dessert was came off too sweet. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Honig- This wine was a suggestion from the waiter and my group really liked it, it was a Cabernet Sovereign and it went great with the steak but it was $90.",16,11,11,Ben L.,"Queens, NY",978,1001,2785

Ordered us the Double Eagles for the table and we were warned that it would take 50 minutes to make because of the one broiler they have so we had plenty of appetizers prior to. Oysters - not meaty at all which was a bit of a disappointment.

Cocktails for the table - Not too much of a heavy pour, drinks were just about on point.Double Eagles - very underwhelming. Our steaks were a little overcooked which affected it quite a bit, but the steak was just very salty on the seasoning. Paired it with some sauces but it just didn't really make up for it. Desserts - the one thing to order is the lemon cake. Super large slice and there is so much flavor - probably my the favorite item on the menu.

2.0,3/14/2018,"Man was this place disappointing. Although rainy and cold, it was a special night and we booked our table for two at 5:15, a week in advance. My first impression was not good. It was way too crowded, so the resto should expand. So imagine my surprise when, after a 20 minute wait, we were seated at a table for four, right next to an empty, intimate table for two at a window. That should've been our table?! It seemed obvious to me that either someone had been paid off to reserve that table for another couple because they didn't show up for a good fifteen/twenty minutes or one of the two lucky patrons sitting there was in the restaurant business. Definitely irked me and should've been reflected in the tip but we're nice people. And so were the servers and bus boys. The level of service is 4.5 star worthy. The only misstep was not checking in with us till after we finished our food. The VIP cocktail is great but too pricey, which is one of the things that makes this resto seem more like a tourist trap to me than anything else. The other is it seems to have the Midtown cheese factor, especially since the food is not the best.My bf ordered the filet medallions well done. I thought that it was a mistake to order filet well done but that's what he wanted. Overcooked meat that he referenced was like eating a rodent afterwards. I told him I would've sent it back to the kitchen. I ordered the chilean sea bass when I should've ordered the salmon. Another mistake. The texture of the fish was odd and I didn't care for the sauce it came with.The appetizers were terrific though. Trio of Shrimp cocktail and the crab cakes were divine.

4.0,3/11/2018,"Del Frisco earned my respect for its 45 day dry age steak. But my overall rating was brought down by the mushroom side dish, which was unexpectedly salty. To me, it is uncommon to have mushrooms mixed in sauce instead of garlic butter at steakhouses - which actually was worth an applause for the boldness. Our server was nice, but perhaps due to the mushrooms coming out late already, he did not get the chance to ask us how it tasted so we also never mentioned to him that day. Other than that, everything at dinner went smoothly. I love the two rib eye we had, both 45 day dry aged and signature. The chocolate cake was also delicious with chocolate lava in the middle melting out as we cut through the cake. Vanilla ice cream paired on the side (instead of on top) was also a smart choice as it prevents the ice cream from melting as fast.I can also appreciate the general manager walking around tables and introducing himself, it was a kind gesture.",1,0,0,Sabrina Y.,"Manhattan, NY",811,79,166

Don't get me wrong, the steak, array of desserts & cocktail menu are up to par with other well known steak houses throughout the city. Dining service has been slow a couple of times but understandable with the amount of people having dinner.My real 'beef' with Del Friscos occurred last Thursday when I met a girlfriend for drinks. I frequent there after work & was sitting at the upstairs bar & we were chatting with 2 men. A pretentious man (douchebag!) said how I was leaning into his chair while trying to take a photo of my girlfriend. I apologized but noticed his side & rather large frame was actually protruding into my seat. From there, he went on & insinuated my girlfriend & I were escorts with the two men we were chatting with. Although Del Friscos is a known meeting spot for businessmen meeting with escorts & call girls, I was completely offended. Just leaving work & dressed in conservative attire, that comment was completely uncalled for. I was infuriated & responded with ""Well maybe you are with one now since you know so much about them"". I guess he couldn't handle the heat & called the manager up which tapped my shoulder & asked me & my friend to drink at the bar downstairs because of the ""comment"" I made. He didn't ask me what had happened or acknowledge what the man had said to me. We declined the drinks & thought it was a tacky move - offer the girls a FREE drink downstairs & they'll be happy. Sorry, no! Because the man didn't like my response & went to complain first he gets the say?!! Very disappointing experience. Working Manhattan women beware! Mastro's has better steak & ambiance in my opinion if ones seeking a good steakhouse.",8,3,1,Melissa F.,"Ardsley, NY",0,3,0
4.0,3/6/2018,"Visited this restaurant during a trip to New York with my boyfriend, and the service, food, and atmosphere were all top notch! We were seated by the window and had a magnificent view of New York City. To start, we ordered the Jumbo Lump Crab Cake, and immediately were blown away by the freshness and amount of crab we got in the cake! The lobster cream sauce was delicious, and the cake was entirely made of crab (no fillers!). For our entree, we ordered the Wagyu Tomahawk Chop to share, along with lobster mac n cheese and creamed spinach on the side. We ordered the steak medium rare, but received a steak on the rarer side, and our server kindly offered to have it redone for us. The second wagyu chop we received was perfectly cooked and seasoned, and we ate every last bit of it! The creamed spinach was delicious as well, and had me yearning for the recipe they used. Last but not least, lobster mac and cheese was perfectly cheesy and just a classic to have with any steak meal. For dessert, we ordered the creme brulee and cherry sorbet. Let me tell you: I personally have never liked creme brulees until I had a bite of this one. It was perfectly creamy and rich, but not too sweet or dense. The flavor was to die for and it surprisingly paired well with our light and refreshing cherry sorbet.Overall, we had a lovely dinner and will definitely return the next time we're in New York!",0,0,0,Sunny S.,"Cupertino, CA",0,2,5

5.0,3/2/2018,"I've visited this location in celebration of New Years 2018, where my bf and I each purchased their four course prix fixe menu. I started with their jumbo lump crab cake, while my bf had their tuna tartare. The crab cake was more crab than cake which I really appreciated, but the tuna tartare really blew me away! The flavors of the sweet soy ponzu sauce with the avocado and fresh tuna was absolutely delicious and the wonton crisps were perfectly crunchy!I then ordered the prime ribeye medium rare with a side order of creamed corn, while my bf had the prime ribeye rare with creamed spinach...we also order a side of their famous lobster mac and cheese. The corn was nicely spiced because of the crushed up shishito peppers, the bacon and aged cheddar made the spinach perfectly creamy, and the lobster Mac had a good amount of lobster in it, but i think they could've included more. After stuffing our faces and still have A LOT more food left, we couldn't choose which side was our favorite because they were all amazingly delicious and super filling! Would definitely recommend those three sides for any first timers, or returners, at Del Frisco's Finally the dessert arrived, and we both could only take a few bites of the butter cake and cheesecake we decided to order. I wasn't really a fan of the butter cake, as I thought it was too sweet. But the portion was huge and could definitely feed 2-3 people. The cheesecake was also generously cut but tasted like every other cheesecake I've had in NYC.All in all it was a great experience but I wish I took more pictures of the food instead of stuffing my face so quickly",2,0,1,Kimberly G.,"East Williamsburg, NY",119,7,3

4.0,2/19/2018,"As a devout nonconformist (and avid carnivore), I booked a reservation at Del Frisco's on Saturday 2/17 at 7 pm in honor of St. Valentine.We decided to give Del Frisco's a second chance after a Customer Service representative reached out and personally invited us back to the restaurant.  While our dining experience wasn't perfect, we were happy to spend our special occasion at this famous steakhouse.We arrived promptly at 7 pm and were greeted by a sea of guests waiting for their table in the reception area.  Our hostess informed us that they were running ~15-20 minutes behind schedule due to the high volume of diners.  Unfortunately, we were not offered a seat at the bar given that bar space was lacking... so we waited by the staircase adjacent to the hostess stand.  We were eventually seated at 7:35 on the second floor in an intimate dining alcove due south of the bar area sans alcoholic beverage #fail.  However, I must say that the views were simply amazing!We kicked off the evening with two vodka martini's while perusing the food and wine menus.For an appetizer, we shared the Charred Octopus.  Omg delicious!  The Octopus was seasoned and cooked perfectly... tender with an incredible mouthfeel.  After whetting our appetite a bit, we ordered a bottle of red for the table and asked our waiter Kenny to pour it into a wine decanter.  Nice touch.For mains, we ordered the Prime Strip and Prime Ribeye (we're creatures of habit afterall!).  For sides, we went with the Thick-cut Onion Rings and Uptown Del's Potato.  The steaks were well-seasoned and flavorful, cooked to our desired temperature state.  The onion rings... wow... biggest pile of onion rings I've ever seen in my life!  (and pretty tasty too).  One minor quibble on the potatoes - they weren't heated evenly.  The top was piping hot, the middle lukewarm, and the bottom cool.  Oh well.For dessert, we shared the lemon cake.  Light and fluffy.  Definitely hit the spot.All-in, our much improved culinary experience made up for our front of the house experience.  Our waiter Kenny was friendly and attentive.  At no point did we feel rushed.  We spent 2.5 hours at Del Frisco's.",2,0,1,Matt M.,"Manhattan, NY",35,79,200

4.0,2/18/2018,"On Friday February, 17 my wife made reservations for us to go to this steakhouse. I'm a lover of steakhouses. It's very difficult for them to mess it up because the steak are cooked medium rare and some salt and pepper is all you need. So my critique will mostly concentrate on the decor and ambiance and staff. Let's start with entering the restaurant. The hostess was very professional and quite clear we would wait about 30 minutes with the reservation. I liked that she turned away walk-in patrons because they did tell my wife a week earlier that only reservation would be admitted. After waiting, a waiter approached and took us to our seat. As soon as we sat, the manager approached and apologized for making us wait and gave us free cocktails. Try the vip pineappletini (my wife loved it). We had two appetizers, the fried octopus and the tuna tartare. They gave us a large portion on the octopus with a small arugula salad and fava beans. The fava bean tomato sauce was average. The octopus would plain. No sauce, no lemon! . I asked for some balsamic vinegar and it greatly increase the dish. I would have dribbled some aged balsamic on the octopus like Patricia's in the Bronx does. My wife and I loved the tartare. It was light and delicate to my palate. It was served with avocado and a sweet sauce. I highly recommend this appetizer. (btw the waitress was excellent). She knew the menu and recommendations were spot on. I ate a stripped steak and my wife had the salmon. The salmon was served with mash potato with crab. She loved the salmon but not the mash. The sides were very good. One side is for two people. I had sautéed mushroom with caramelized onions. It was delicious. I ended the meal with a cappuccino. Not recommended. Not very good. Overall,  I give this restaurant a 4 but would only go once a every two years for a romantic dinner. It cost approximately $125 per person. Won't take kids. The decor was average and found the portraits on the wall were out of place. A bunch of women naked posing on fur rugs. It's a steak house, not a brothel.",0,0,0,Frank M.,"Brooklyn, NY",135,49,37

It is dead center of midtown on a weekend so maybe that was foolish. I can't review the food because we had to leave to make it to a show by 8. To their credit, when we told them we needed to go, the server apologized profusely and said she could rush the order. The only other thing I want to mention is the ambiance. Compared to some other places I have been in the city, this place did not have a fine dining feel. It was very loud (there is a massive amount of tables), loud music is playing, it was fairly bright, there was no coat check, and the server was practically yelling at us to tell the specials. If you are looking for a romantic or special dinner, I think you are better off elsewhere. I made a note in the reso about what we were celebrating and there was no mention by the server or hosts.

Nothing special.  There was more soup than lobster in it.  I got the filet mignon offered in the entree.  You can upgrade the size of your steak, with not much more money.  Be aware that they cook steaks here a little different so ask your server how your meat will be cooked according to your taste.  I usually order Medium, but the middle was a bit rarer than I thought, BUT server did warn me beforehand.  With that said, the steak was cooked well and tasted good.  However, outside of steak was a bit too salty! That was a bit surprising, but not so salty that I didn't finish it. Desert was good too.  I got the chocolate mousse-good and my gf got a Huge cheesecake.  Cheesecake was good.  My gf got the caesar salad btw and was disappointing.  Lettuce was So subpar= almost dead leaf (for a high end/expensive restaurant).  Go for restaurant week as this restaurant is catered for the business crowd= $$$.",0,0,0,Rasha J.,"Manhattan, NY",43,72,174

5.0,2/6/2018,"A very nice place. Let's start off with they had our reservation and no waiting. We were seated right away with a nice view. Del Frisco is spacious so no one was on top of each other and me and my other was able to have a conversation. The bread was delicious crispy in the outside and soft on inside and hot. The butter was nice and fluffy. We ordered the oysters on half shell and king crab legs for appetizer, the wagyu tomahawk chops and Brussels sprout for dinner and chocolate soufflé cake, espresso double shot and tea.  The oyster and crab legs was fresh. The first problem was the wagyu tomahawk chop was crispy outside (nice) but when you cut into it there was way too much fat. We told the waiter (I think his name was Joel) he brought over one of the manager who saw how fat it was and offered another steak but by then we were a little turn off so they told us it would not be charge. We felt bad and wasn't trying not to pay so we decided to order a dessert. Problem number two was the dessert came and no espresso or tea till after the dessert was done. We found the dessert dry like it had been sitting a while because the molten chocolate had already dried into the cake and wasn't flowing any chocolate from the middle. But Joel was nice enough to get the dessert, espresso and tea taken off also. So not the best on the food this time but the service was great and really nice of them to take off the bill everything that was not great. The bill came to about $135 and we gave Joel a $65 tip for trying. We definitely will be back to try something else and hopefully it will be better and get to pay the entire bill. Thank DelFriscos for the great service and see you again soon.",0,0,0,Judy W.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,11,22

5.0,2/5/2018,"This is a steakhouse i have been wanting to try for a long time and i finally got the opportunity to dine here.  With reservations our party of 3 was seated promptly on a Friday night which for the most part was not crowded at all as i was expecting. The place is actually quite large. We got a table on the ground floor.When i go to steakhouses i normally just go for the steaks so we decided to skip on appetizers and just go for the entree and sides. We ordered the 32oz. Wagyu tomahawk steak (enough for 2 people) and the 16oz. 45 day dry aged prime ribeye. I am very particular when it comes to the temperature of my steak. Both were steaks were cooked to absolute perfection (medium rare). Our waitress also asked if we would be sharing which we were and they had both steaks sliced for us (highly recommended). The seasoning i thought was perfect for my taste. Both Steaks were so tender and juicy. It was hard to imagine the wagyu was not even dry aged for how tender it was. We also ordered 3 sides (Lobster mac & cheese, Brussels sprouts and Onion Rings). Nothing majorly special about any of these but they were all good. For Dessert we tried what they are apparently known for which was the lemon cake. It was a huge slice of cake which was also enough for 3 people to share. I didn't see anything special here. Maybe a little disappointed being its their signature dessert. Just tasted like a regular cake i can get anywhere else.Service was excellent. Our waitress was always back to see how we were doing and if we needed anything. She also made sure we understood how the meat would come out being cooked to our requested temperature which i thought was nice since not all people eat steaks as much as i do and might not know.A couple things regarding drinks. They don't have any beers on tap, only bottled. They do have a decent selection of whiskey's.Overall experience was fantastic. The location was screaming tourist trap but it was surprisingly good. I will definitely go back when i have that craving for steak again. This one makes my list of one of the best steakhouses in NYC.",1,0,1,Johnny T.,"Bronx, NY",0,11,0

The porter house was cooked medium as we requested, but the prime rib was not. So we asked the runner to bring it back to the kitchen.

The steak my dad had was marinated and tasted not adfresh as it could had been. The soup I had was close to diner quality and my fish was cooked slightly on the drier side.

5.0,1/30/2018,"I came here after a birthday dinner.  The plan was to sit at the bar, have a couple drinks, and eat dessert.  The previous week 3 people in my party of 8 had visited here for dinner and raved so much about the dessert, that we ditched out of our Michelin rated dinner to come here to wash down a delicious, albeit rich meal.We ordered 5 butter cakes, 1 lemon cake, and 1 banana bread pudding.  I ordered the bread pudding, and I can only describe it as follows:Imagine tasting something that caused such an explosion of taste in your mouth that your brain couldn't decipher it....that there were no words to describe the feeling of euphoria, like your soul left your body and went to the happiest place you had ever known, that you wanted to meet the pastry chef and immediately vow to leave everything that meant anything to you to follow him/her as an unpaid apprentice, that tears welled up in the corners of your eyes because for what seems like the first time in your existence; you now understand the potential of food to transform the senses.....Aaaah, I might be a little dramatic, but indeed this was by far one of the best bread puddings I have ever eaten.The Butter cake was delicious too, but too sweet for my tastes.  Although, I took some home, and it tasted so much better a day later after it had been sitting in the refrigerator.Unfortunately the lemon cake was left virtually uneaten.  Though it was quite moist, and the flavor seemed to be all there, the butter was rancid and gave the cake quite an off-putting taste. It was a shame because it was my brother's birthday, and the lemon cake was what he wanted.  However, the restaurant did remove it from our bill.",0,0,0,Kia T.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,6,8

The 6 oz filet Mignon was good but it had too much seasoning which made it a bit salty. The salmon was excellent. The wagyu beef French dip with French fries was not bad.

5.0,1/29/2018,"Despite working in finance in Midtown, I've managed to avoid making any steakhouse trips in New York. However, with Restaurant Week upon us, my coworkers wanted to do a lunch out, and once the votes were in for Del Frisco's I accepted my fate.We made a reservation for a party of 8 at 1 pm a couple days out. When we arrived with fewer than that, we were told no problem, though it did take about 10 minutes to get seated. The place is huge and was overrun with people. There are dramatic views from the balcony and main floor. Unfortunately, we ended up being seated in a backroom, but would imagine this is not typical at normal hours.The RW menu is a $29 pre fixe with appetizers (two salads and a soup), mains (steak, chicken, and fish), and dessert (mousse or cheesecake). I opted for the lobster bisque, filet mignon, and chocolate mousse.The lobster bisque was super rich and creamy. It's a small bowl but they were generous with the lobster chunks. Unexpectedly filling.The filet mignon was great. The medium rare was a little rare for our group's taste, but the texture was so tender and the flavor was great. Very little excess fat. Mashed potato accompaniment was good. Not the most impressive plate you've seen, but satisfying. It was only a 6 oz and I had the option to upsize but it ended up being more than enough.Finally, the chocolate mousse was fine, but not a must-get, especially since I was bursting at that point. Coworkers enjoyed their cheesecakes.It ended up being a little under $40 with tax and tip. Do note that they normally have a lunch special with an appetizer and entree that looked like quite a good deal.Our server did a great job. She told us as we were leaving that Restaurant Week triples their lunch volume. Kudos to handling a stressful situation gracefully.

2.0,1/21/2018,"I have always loved Del Frisco's. It has been my favorite steakhouse for years. So when i was planning my husband's birthday weekend, this restaurant was a natural choice. Our reservations were for 8:30 PM. We got there a bit early, 8:15, which would have been fine if it wasn't for the overly crowded entry way and an impossible to get to bar and check-in desk. Once we got to the checkin desk (10 mins later,) we were told they were running 25 mins behind on their reservations and we would be seated at 8:55 PM. I was irritated as this was NOT a way I wanted to celebrate. We had plans to meet up with friends around 10 PM. Even with this minor delay, we were still on time but now dinner wasn't going to be relaxing. At 8:57 PM I checked in with the hostess on our table. Her response was ""we are still seating 8 PM reservations!) She stayed that now they were running an hour behind and it would be another 30 mins, at least but she can't tel me for sure. I was dumbfounded, to say the least. At that point, it was too late to go else where. We were stuck! I was furious! My husband's birthday was ruined by staff that doesn't know how to manage reservations. I spoke to the manager (I believe Gerard, but I could be wrong) and he said it is because reservations came in late, and it caused all other delays. He was sorry. He was very apologetic and sincere but it didn't ease my anger from a well-know and pricey restaurant carrying on like that. The hostesses seemed indifferent and annoyed. We were finally seated around 9:35 PM. Waiter (Brian) was fantastic and the food was great, as per usual. But every bite was bitter due to the hour long wait, despite having reservations. In the end, we had two drinks comped off of our bill, which I found to be a pity throw to comp 2 $17 drinks off of a $250 bill, considering I already spent $80 at the bar due to the long wait. Our plans with our friends got pushed back since we only get out at 11. And 3 of the Friends had to leave and missed my husband's birthday. This isn't a quick-bite joint. This is a classy and well know restaurant that should take reservation times seriously. If they were running behind, why not call and let us know?! They had my number. Or when there was an additional delay, why not send a hostess to let everyone know and respect everyone's time?! Maybe give out drink vouchers or something, so while you wait, you can at least have a comp drink. They did none of that, which is what truly made me so mad. I get it!

If you're not careful, you'll miss your name.  It's a two story restaurant... with bars on each floor.... surprised that they don't have a better system to alert people that their table is ready (like a buzzing machine or texting system....).... so hostesses have to walk up the flights for each name.... unless they are lucky and the party is hovering.... Entrance is crowded (and happens to be directly in front of the hostess stand).  Looks like a fire hazard with all of the people standing by the revolving door - making it impossible to get in.  And dangerous.Couldn't really enjoy my food because well...

Our group of four had an 8:30pm reservation as we had a 10:30pm show to attend. The entrance and lobby were seriously crowded when we arrived and we had to wait in this for 30 minutes and weren't seated until almost 9pm, making our time for dinner now very limited. Due to this, we didn't have time to relax over appetizers but had to go straight into entree's.  We explained the situation to the manager and asked that he help expedite now that we were running late. Well, our steaks finally arrived after 50 minutes, making us seriously late for the show by now. We had to rush our food and even have one of the group leave early to pickup our show tickets and save our seats.  In summary, expensive but decent food, ruined by greedy and/or shoddy management who had clearly over committed their wait staff and their kitchen. Needless to say, I won't be going back to Del Frisco's.",0,0,0,Richard B.,"Bentonville, AR",37,4,0

The accruements were lacking unfortunately.The Foie Gras was thick and fatty, but nothing really stood out.The charred octopus was excellent. Great bite, but not chewy at all. The charcoal really comes through. And lastly the bacon was, well, bacon. Nothing special, but still good.I had the 45-day dry aged ribeye as my main dish. Medium-rare. I most likely could have done better by ordering it medium, but I like my food as rare as possible. Very, very flavorful.

Shrimp cocktail was just put on plate with sauce poured on top. The presentation was horrible. Our steaks came out 2 of 3 were cooked correctly the third was over done and then they brought new one out and a few pieces were to rare so instead of taking back to kitchen he told us plate was hot enough to let it cook on plate. Our side dishes came out about 5 min after steak so we had to begin eating without sides. They also never offered steak sauce, or ground pepper. We also watched them serve all tables at round us the sides on each persons plate   Ours they just put on table  the dessert was probably the better part of meal.

We were seated on the second floor towards the back which was a blessing in disguise as it was a quieter area and more intimate. To start, I ordered the thick-cut bacon (beware, the peppers that garnish the dish are VERY spicy.. I learned the hard way) and the shrimp cocktail. The shrimp were nice and large and the bacon reminded me of a nice piece of smoked ham. For the entree my mom and I shared the porterhouse for two, medium-well with black & white truffle butter. I've never willingly slathered so much butter on my food in my life! The steak was cooked perfectly and oh-so-tender.. best steak I've had in my life thus far! For sides we had gotten the lobster mac and the asparagus. I definitely ordered with my eyes because we couldn't finish everything.

There is a yummy sauce with them though. The steak is seasoned with salt, pepper, and butter. I'm a southern belle so I enjoy the taste of rare occasion for perfectly-balanced, seasoned beef. .

2.0,11/17/2017,"I will preface this by saying the food is amazing as usual. The service is where things fell short during my visit for dinner on Monday night. The server that waited on me and my fiance was lovely. The things I will mention were not at all her fault because I think they are more of a general service thing.1. We had a reservation yet somehow we got a table that was separated from everyone else by a column and a partial wall. So you can't see where your server is if you need them and they can't see you unless they circled the column and squeezed past the partial wall.2. My fiance ordered the mashed potatoes. They came with a piece of the aluminium that was used to cook the potatoes still inside. When he took a bite out of the potatoes, he felt some pain because he has metal fillings in some teeth. Initially he thought something was wrong with his teeth until he fished out a piece of aluminium. He left it on the edge of the serving dish & pointed it out to the server who apologized. However we still ended having to pay for this dish which should have been comped honestly. We didn't really eat past that & took our food to go because his mouth still hurt and I was over the whole experience.3. We were already in this weird corner and the other servers actually made a long table behind us and a group of 12 or so guys came and were seated there. My fiance was able to get out of his seat fine however I was not because again weird little corner & 12 other people and a giant table all next to the balcony edge. 4. Another server actually brought a 2nd order of mac and cheese to our table and we told her right away that it is not ours which they took away. We still got charged for this though and had to point it out in order for it to be changed. This was supposed to be my birthday dinner and a great experience which it was not. If anything, it ruined the rest of the night. Love the food. Just dont know if I will be coming back ever.",1,0,0,Amela C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,12,12

I coordinated the dinner with their group sales manager and she upgraded us for free to their downstairs private room rather than have a large table in the regular dining room. I pre-set the menu to help make dinner selections faster and even pre-set, each diner had a lot of options to chose from for their entrees. I selected to have the cheesecake and mousse as the two dessert options and must say the cheesecake was delicious and quite large! I had to bring mine home. Overall, the presentation of our dinner was fabulous and the service was also wonderful. If you are in a group setting over 15 people, I would highly recommend reserving a private room downstairs. The upstairs bar and the main dining room were extremely crowded and I am sure it would have been hard to hold a conversation with the noise level.

3.0,11/14/2017,"I was unimpressed. Overpriced steakhouse marketed as an upscale restaurant that felt like a standard restaurant. Food wise: I got to sample the steak which was good but not so good as to merit the price. The drinks were unimpressive as were the appetizers and main. I ordered the seared seabass and artichoke side and pomegranate martini. The seabass was not that tasty, definitely not $40+ worth. The martini was overly sweet and simplistic. Decor and ambiance wise: We went on a Saturday night and it felt crowded and loud. It's clearly a very popular restaurant and attracts a wide array of people. It felt like the restaurant everyone goes to when they want a ""fancy"" meal. Despite being an upscale restaurant, supposedly, it did not feel that way in several respects. Our waiter was friendly, but her loud and overly animated demeanor was a little disruptive during the meal and didn't match the ambiance I expected.

From there we went right to the main courses.  I ordered the Petite Filet with Béarnaise sauce. It was exactly what you would expect. My daughter ordered the Pan-Roasted Natural Chicken, delicious. She also ordered the Classic Caesar Salad. She enjoyed it but would have preferred more Parmesan Cheese. My son ordered the Sesame Seared Tuna which he thought was great.  We order 3 sides; the Grilled Asparagus, Spaghetti Squash Gratin and Cauliflower and Brie au Gratin.  They all were wonderful.  Then we had dessert and coffee. We ordered the Lemon Cake and the Cheesecake with Butterscotch Sauce.  The Lemon Cake came out with a lit candle and a card signed by the staff.  The Lemon Cake was definitely worth the wait.  From now on, we are going to celebrate every birthday at Del Friscos with Lemon Cake. The staff was very attentive.  I was very pleased with our whole experience.  I will definitely return. The only negative I have is with the bill.   I paid cash and put in extra money for change for the tip.  The waitress shorted me 25 dollars and removed the bill. I was confused! The tip would have been twice that. So what am I supposed to do? I asked her for the bill, which she found and then gave me 15 dollars back.

We walked in and sat at the bar as we thought we would only get a quick drink and a bathroom break. But we ended up getting one of our best experiences of our entire 3-day vacation here. While the wife was freshening up, I ordered the lamb sliders and casually mentioned to the bartender, Briana, that I would wait to order my wine until my wife got back because it was our anniversary and I wanted to see if she wanted champagne or wine. A bit of an overshare moment on my behalf, some may say, but the bartender heard me and sprung into action. She started us off with a couple glasses of complimentary champagne, which made me want to stay and at least have dessert too. The lamb sliders were delicious - we paired it with a Chianti, and I thought it was great.I asked Briana which dessert she thought I shouldn't leave without tasting - the butter cake was her immediate and adamant response, so we ordered it. She brought it out to us on a platter with a candle and a ""happy anniversary"" AND a lava cake. It was just the best service we had our entire trip and it made us feel incredibly happy and welcome.It's truly an amazing feeling when you go to a place and leave feeling like celebrities because of the attentiveness and caliber of service received. As anyone reading through reviews probably already knows, the place is pretty expensive, but you're not only paying for food, you're getting top-notch customer service that will make you want to come back whether the food was great or not.

4.0,10/19/2017,"My mother has been making a big deal since she saw this lemon cake on Fox News. I love lemon - lemonade, lemon meringue pie, a squeeze of lemon on asparagus - you get the point, so it made perfect sense that we go get this cake she heard had such great reviews. Del Frisco's is a very nice steakhouse so we used my birthday as a special event to make a reservation. We met my brother for a birthday dinner and, from the start, it went incredibly smooth. We were led to our table immediately and there was a birthday card from the staff already waiting for me. That detail itself was just so personal and special. I think that really set the tone for the dinner.I did notice, to my surprise, there was a dichotomy of those dressed up and those who weren't. I'm not sure if Del Frisco's has a proper dress code or it is just unspoken that people typically dress up to go to such a restaurant. It was just interesting to see men in suits on one side of me and, on the other, a couple wearing jeans and hoodies. I found that very surprising but I suppose that customers are customers regardless of what they wear.Our meal was started with my brother ordering an Old Fashioned and complimentary bread. The bread was fine but the whipped butter was so smooth that it just glided onto the bread. We were so hungry, we ate the entire small loaf. The three of us ordered quite a meal - as my mother described. I wish we could've ordered appetizers but there were only two that we could've ordered because we don't eat pork or shellfish. First, the Caesar salad. The salad arrived with full leaves, which looked beautiful, but it was a little difficult to cut them because the salad was falling off of my plate. I felt that there were a few too few croutons and they really were stingy about the parmesan cheese. Anyone who orders a Caesar salad is not ordering it for the lettuce, I'll tell you that. Perhaps I could've asked for more cheese and croutons but I didn't want to make a fuss. The dressing itself was definitely homemade. I could taste the anchovy and the lemon but I wished it was a bit creamier. It wasn't necessarily thin but it could've coated the salad better.The Sesame Seared Tuna looked absolutely beautiful. The tuna looked like a little pink cake. It was served with Soy Ginger Glaze and Wasabi Cream. My brother didn't leave anything left on the plate so I imagine it was delicious. My mother ordered the Petite Filet with Béarnaise sauce. It was ordered ""medium"" and there was the perfect amount of pink inside. The steak itself, which I swiped, was absolutely juicy and I definitely could've eaten the whole thing myself. The Béarnaise is a sauce made of clarified butter and egg yolks, so it was obviously, very, very creamy. I could taste a little acidity from either vinegar or lemon (perhaps both). The Pan-Roasted Chicken was beautifully cooked. Every detail of it - the mushrooms, corn and fingerling potatoes were fresh and the roasted chicken jus made the dish. I'd definitely order it again.Along with our entrée, we ordered three sides - The Grilled Asparagus, Spaghetti Squash Gratin as well as the Cauliflower and Brie au Gratin. The Asparagus is served with Romesco, which is one of my favorite sauces. It was so rich, creamy and absolutely delicious. Romesco is a Spanish sauce of roasted red peppers and almonds with tomato and bread pureed together. The Spaghetti Squash Gratin had Parmesan Cream & Roasted Pistachio. Those are three of my favorite ingredients, so I adored it. I could've eaten it all by myself. The Cauliflower and Brie au Gratin was definitely the most popular of the sides. It was so creamy and the cauliflower was in big florets. We debated ordering another to take home but ended up choosing against it.Everything on the dessert menu sounded great and we debated whether or not to order more than one thing. We got three coffees and, of course, we ordered the lemon cake. It was a large slice with six layers, with Lemon Buttercream Icing and Lemon Glaze. This is definitely the cake to get if you love lemon as much as I do. It is sweet but not too much. It was brought out with a lit candle for me, which I thought was another really sweet touch. Mom decided to get the Cheesecake with the Butterscotch sauce. None of us had even considered Butterscotch sauce! I'm not typically a Cheesecake fan but this was the creamiest Cheesecake I've ever had with a pecan crust and a pool of delicious sauce. The only downside to the Cheesecake was that it didn't feel like there was enough sauce! It would've been my preference to have the sauce poured onto the Cheesecake itself, but it didn't stop me from grabbing spoonfuls of it to pour all over. The pecan crust didn't do anything for me but the pecans served with the sauce were great. I'm definitely a Cheesecake convert, at least, at Del Frisco's.I definitely think we'll be returning for Mom's birthday next month! And we'll probably order more of the desserts then.",1,0,1,Amy S.,"Manhattan, NY",144,141,2

I think the definite highlight was the prize. 3 course lunch for $29 is fantastic, although it's mostly due to restaurant week. I checked the menu and a 8oz filet mignon is normally $42! The dessert was great as well. I had the banana pudding soufflé. Rich banana flavor the it was extremely fluffy. The waiters were extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Some restaurants usually turn a cold shoulder when they learn you're here for restaurant week but not this place! Our waiter was attentive and always refilled our cup whenever it was more than half empty. Constantly cleared the bread crumbs off our table.

Over rated if you ask me.  Service was OK.  Got there around 5:30 as a walk in.  Didn't take long to seat us but felt like we were rushed to have the table turned quickly.  Will not return.  Not a fan of this place.  Much better places to spend my $.",0,0,0,Bryce M.,"Los Gatos, CA",0,14,0

I think that was the best salmon I've ever tried! But anyways $46 or $47 (I don't really remember) is too expensive for a small peace of fish!) Sowhat my friend said about the steak is that the steak was well done, while he asked it to be medium. But he loved a side which was a mashed potatoes. And another friend was really enjoying the dessert. She couldn't eat it all, so I joined her( ahah) and I really enjoyed too! It was soooo good! And let's talk a bit about a service.

Four bartenders in there  20 to low 30's working  the service was terrible and slow. Dirty glasses everywhere, never wiping up when someone left. I sat there for 10 mins before a bartender ask ""anything else"" like I had been there for an hour.  Left the previous plate and glass and went about do I don't know.  Food came out in a timely matter except the ribeye came it raw. Cold tuff center, I ordered med rare. Sent it back, the replacement was cooked right but was tuff and basically flavorless except for the pepper. Lettuce wedge was fantastic.   Overall if you want flashy atmosphere  and so so food an bad service it will work for you.  Not even close to a full service steakhouse around the US.

Would not recommend.Also worth noting that as soon as they saw yelp they took my uncooked steak away so I couldn't post photos. Additionally, I had flown out from the west coast for a wedding, and the manager had the audacity to ask me to give it another try next time. Next time? You're a steakhouse charging $200/meal with tip, taxes and drinks. You don't get a second chance. You're supposed to not fuck yo. If I wanted to try two or three times to get the right steak I woulda just gone to outback.

We ordered truffle butter it was an additional charge but totally worth it combined with the steak was delicious! We ordered a baked potato as a side it was pretty big, definitely enough for two and it tasted soo good.Dessert: BUTTERCAKE! You have to have to try their buttercake.

It was iceberg lettuce...looked like someone headed over to Albertsons and got salad in a bag.  Horrendous for an upscale restaurant.   We started with the crab cake appetizer. Crab cake being singular....one crab cake  for 25 bucks....and it wasn't very good.  I got the bone in filet and part of it was well done and the other half very rare.   My wife got the rib eye which she thought was too salty.  They did give us a free anniversary dessert which was very nice and our waitress was very friendly if not overly attentive.   Overall I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.

Delicious but also not as heavy as their lobster mac&cheese, especially when you're going for a huge steak. They also have a really big wine list with bottles going anywhere from $50-$1000+.We both decided to get the bone-in rib eye steak because we like a cut that's fatty, as these cuts tend to be juicier. We got it cooked medium and were asked to cut into the steak to check the temperature. So nice!The steaks are so amazing, cooked only with sat and pepper. They are so juicy that they don't even need any steak sauce. That's how you know it's good!!We were also given a slice of lemon meringue cake on the house because it was our anniversary.

5.0,8/22/2017,"This place is simply amazing. As an upscale steak house it does not disappoint in service or taste. Even though I did not have an alcoholic beverage, I saw many people order martinis which looked pretty nice. The bread always came out warm and the server was constantly attentive to our needs (and we're a pretty needy bunch). We had the oysters, escargot, shripm cocktail, and crab cakes for our appetizers and they certainly did NOT disappoint. If you did not tell me I was eating escargot, I would have thought they were just really good mushrooms because it did not taste like snail at all (in a good way). I don't think their crab cake was traditionally pan-fried, which made it all the better. Hands down the best crab cake I've had in my life. The only downside was all of our steaks were the wrong temperature. We were a party of 7, and might have confused the server a bit, but what could have gone wrong that 7 pieces of steak were all mixed up in temperature? The staff fixed this issue right away though and we all received the right meats with additional complimentary desserts for the trouble. Nonetheless, the seasoning on the steak was spectacular. I recommend getting the truffle butter which tastes good on pretty much everything. The sides were to die for as well. The onion rings are huge and great for the picture, but were a little soggy after sitting out for a while.If you can drop by Del Frisco's anytime, I would highly suggest doing so!",6,0,1,Amber C.,"Flushing, NY",360,159,737
5.0,8/22/2017,Best dinner of my life. I was expecting a really nice upscale dinner that was going to drain my pockets and what i got blew my expectations out of the water. Our server Kerry blew me away with her knowledge and suggestions. I thought this would be a one time affair but i will 100% be returning.

2.0,8/21/2017,"First off, the food was good (other than my charred steak that was supposed to be medium rare). But the service sucked. I'm not even a snob about service when I go out. I just want a good experience and mutual respect. I am picky as hell when it comes to the food though, LOVE a great steak and easily know more about steak than 90% of people. I was treated like I was overly picky and didn't know anything about steak which was just a small part of the experience, but terribly disappointing. Having zero dry aged steaks on menu makes me think they prefer an uneducated diner who just comes for the polished utensils and fancy environment.Sorry people, it's a long one. Story is below but here are the cliff notes:- brought friends from LA to NY- my off menu prime dry aged ribeye was ordered medium rare and came out clearly over cooked. How TF does a high end Steakhouse do this to one of their most expensive off menu items? You're a STEAKHOUSE and I order a PRIME DRYAGED RIBEYE- waiter misunderstood the server and brought it out even more burnt. Took him a while to figure it out and was absolutely not appropriately apologetic for the situation. Maybe he was embarrassed, but he didn't handle it correctly. - correct (correct enough) steak came out around 10 minutes later but waiter was unfriendly and borderline rude for the remainder of our dinner- no management came to apologize. No discount or removal of the steak was offered.- I spent a little over $500 for a terrible experience.I will never be back. There are too many epic steakhouses in NY to risk another terrible experience at Del Friscos. I hope this review deters even just a few. Look into Keens, Ruth's Chris or Peter Luger.Full version below:Clarification: Waiter and server were two different people.My wife and I brought another couple who are really good friends of ours to NY as a wedding gift. This was one of our many foodie stops.Service was good until my steak came out. I thought all or most of Del Friscos steaks were prime, dry-aged. They're not. In fact dry aged steaks are an off menu item that you have to ask for and I found that out by talking to our waiter. I ended up ordering the off menu prime dry-aged ribeye, medium rare for something like $132. Side note, I've dined at a lot of high end steakhouses and this was priced much too high for the mid-high-end steakhouse Del Friscos is. But I never come to a steakhouse for a wet aged steak so I happily agreed, expecting an amazing steak and experience. My steak came or and was noticeably overcooked. The server asked me what I had ordered, I said medium rare, he said oh that's definitely not medium rare and asked everyone else to cut theirs to see if maybe the plates were mixed on accident. No one else had my steak so he apologized and said they would prepare another immediately. It was a bummer and seems like a terrible (and embarrassing) mistake for a high-end STEAKHOUSE to make with an expensive off menu steak but we had sides that I could start on so everyone else could eat and I didn't make a big deal about it.The steak came back out a few minutes later, charred, carried by our waiter this time. Our waiter loudly and without notice placed it on the table and asked if it was fine. I looked at him confused and told him it was overcooked from the start and I wanted a medium rare steak. He looked annoyed for a few seconds but I could see him starting to realize that there was some sort of major miscommunication going on between the server, waiter and chef. He left with the steak and said he would get it figured out. At this point I started to go from quietly annoyed to politely angry and dramatically disappointed.He returned a minute later with a very short, empty apology and said a new steak was being prepared. Everyone was half way through their steak when the server brought out my fresh ribeye. Clearly rare, which wasn't a big issue. Medium rare is my favorite but I can definitely enjoy a rare steak and didn't want to wait any longer so I told him it was fine. I felt like he did it on purpose to be sure that I wouldn't think it was over done again. Which was childish because the first steak was simply over cooked. The server agreed. I wasn't just being picky. Cook the steak right! You shouldn't need to aim for undercooked to be safe. Just cook the steak right!After this our waiter didn't stop by for 10-15 minutes. He returned to ask us if we wanted our check, didn't offer desert.He didn't offer any other apology about the mistakes. Didn't offer to remove it from the check. Zero remedy. I paid a little over $500 for 4 people to have a disappointing experience at Del Friscos in NYC. Bummer, but we left and made the best of the night. I will absolutely not be back there are too many great steak houses in NY to risk a similar experience.",2,1,0,Angel T.,"Corona, CA",7,38,2

We talked about steak, wet vs dry, and how we personally didn't care much for our experience at Peter Luger. She told us how she believes in customer service in addition to good food, and she absolutely delivered! She's incredibly knowledgeable about food, very fun yet professional, and she brought us dessert to celebrate my research. The food was excellent and the service was even better.

5.0,8/16/2017,"Now I am not going to lie, this is the first steak house that I have ever been to. I ordered the Bone-In Prime Ribeye 22 oz. with Baked Potato on the side. Shh don't tell anyone but... omg... The food was AMAZING and the wait staff was even better. Sadly, I forget our servers name but she was awesome. They were very accommodating first of all I had a very long day with my car in the shop and I got there an HOUR late. When the rest of my party asked if they could reschedule to a later time on a FRIDAY so that I can be there when the time came to order they had NO problems AND might I add the place was packed. I can definitely appreciate that. Now about this Ribeye, between you and me this was my last meal before I decided to go vegan (I hate my life I hate my life) and I have been fantasizing about it since last Friday. I ordered it medium well and it came to the table a little pinker than I liked, I asked if they could put it on the fire for a few more minutes which they did and when it came back I died. I mean I literally died for about .005 of a second. By FAR the best steak that I have ever eaten... Now to be fair the baked potato that I had with it was also very good and you also have to keep in mind this is not a cheap place meal including tax and tip was well of $100 but you know the adage you get what you pay for? Well yea... I got what I paid for AND more.  For desert I had a Lemon Cake at the suggestion of my server that I cannot even explain adiquately how much I loved. I am salivating just thinking about it.

5.0,8/15/2017,"The five stars is for the restaurant week menu. Noticed this restaurant is one of the highest rating steak house in the city... and they offered restaurant week menu?!

It's a steak house and i don't need to try their chicken or salmon) and banana bread pudding as dessert. (I did order strawberry cheesecake but The bread pudding is much better in my opinion) Generous portion and attention to temperature of the meat. (Wait staff asked us to cut into meat to check temperature before he walked away) and good selection of wine. Bonus point, we made a 1145am reservation for lunch and got a really nice table looking out Sixth avenue. I also saw someone ordered tuna tartare and bone in filet that looks really good.

3.0,8/13/2017,"The Good Our waiter Jose was great. Friendly, funny, informative, around when we needed him and scarce when we just wanted to eat. The support staff were great too, and our water glasses were kept filled all night long. Our steaks were good, particularly the filet trio in the truffle butter sauce - yum! The king crab gnocchi...my goodness, this was my favorite thing of the night. There were a couple nice chunks of crab in there, and I just loved the texture of the gnocchi. Mmm.The BadStrawberry cheesecake: bad. The texture of it is straight cream cheese... Like the way you'd imagine a bit slab of cream cheese would be on a crust. Lol. The texture is that of a no bake cheesecake and the strawberry sauce was weak. We did eat most of it tho, so it wasn't inedible...just not that good.The UglyThe lobster Mac and cheese overall was not good...but the top crust was burnt pretty badly, and that burnt taste permeated the entire dish. They comped it though, so not a huge issue. That was really much appreciated.Would I return here? Possibly, if we had some out of town visitors who wanted to try the place specifically. I myself probably wouldn't on my own, bc although there were some good dishes, the entire meal didn't blow me out of the water enough that I'd pay the high prices to eat an overall okay meal.",0,0,0,Rose L.,"Queens, NY",80,139,168

Let's start with appetizers shall we. We had the crab cake. This was definitely the true definition of a crab cake. Loaded with soft, succulent crab meat my only issue with it was that it wasn't bigger because I wanted more of it. For the main course I had the 8 oz filet mignon (medium well) with a side of creamed spinach. Yummm. The side is big enough for 2 people maybe even 3 so keep that in mind when ordering sides. Our waiter was very attentive and wanted to ensure that our steaks were cooked to our liking so he waited until we each cut into our filets to make sure we were satisfied. 5 star service in my book. We also had a side of lobster mac and cheese. It was good as well. Everyone was satisfied with their food. We had a glass of Malbec that didn't disappoint as well.

Top notch service and top notch food.To give you an idea, wines range anywhere from $100 to $7000 a bottle. But again, its all worth it.I started out with crabcakes that may have been the best I have ever had. Someone at the table asked to split oysters, so of course I said yes. I was rewarded with very clean tasting oysters. You can taste the freshness. I can say the same for the mozzarella in the appetizer salad as well.These things were almost pure crab. For dinner I decided to go for the three filet mignons; one with foi gras, another with a crab topping, and a third with a mushroom reduction. All of the steaks were cooked to perfection. My personal favorite was the filet topped with crab, but honestly all three were fantastic.The sides are served family style. We ordered the creamed spinach with bacon, sweet potato, and onion ring, all of which were very good. I do not know what kind of batter they used for the rings, but i want more of it.The desserts were enormous!

5.0,8/10/2017,"I don't think I can say that Del Frisco's is the best steakhouse in New York City. I do not even think Del Frisco's themselves can make that bold statement. However, In a city with such historical quality restaurants DF is able to noticeably stand out and it's no mystery why once you've came here. Half the experience of any restaurant is the setting, decor, servers, etc the other obviously being the food. DF is able sweep you off your feet, this marvelous Goliath of a restaurant is situated right in the heart of Manhattan. The inside matches the outside, two large floors covered in a sea of tables and happy patrons. This may be the most beautifully laid out restaurant you will ever attend. On to the good stuff. This passed Friday we attended DF for restaurant week. I chose the mixed greens, 8 oz filet, and cheesecake. Additionally, we ordered the infamous onion rings. The salad, so simple yet so perfect. It's as easy to mess a salad up as it is to make it absolutely perfect. Refreshing balsamic dressing, with freshly made croutons made this salad top shelf. Next, I ordered my filet Medium+, it was cooked absolutely perfect. Every bite as tender as the bite before. The onion rings accompanying my filet, sized like donuts you would see at Dunkin, each crispy and covered in a smooth crunchy dough. Finally, the cheesecake, so rich and creamy every bite was pure bliss. For the value ($29) I would come here everyday. Unfortunately, this lunch would probably run you around 60 on a regular day.

From the gorgeous venue to the solid food and top notch service, it was all on point.I would highly recommend trying the bacon app here. It was cooked perfect with a bit of a peppercorn crust (as most of the steaks were cooked as well). The Tuna Tartar was also delicious. For dinner, I tried a bone in filet which was good. But I actually enjoyed the 16oz strip off the menu better. And that is not a cut I normally would go for. The guys that went with the famous Wagyu ribeye had nothing but high praise for their cuts. Was told it was the best ribeye that both of them had ever eaten. The sides we had were all perfect. We left nothing behind. Lobster mac, King Crab Gnocchi, Shaved Brussels Sprouts, Potatos Au Gratin, Cauliflower Au Grotin, Maque Choux Corn.Drinks were excellent as well but be prepared for upwards of $20 a cocktail. Dessert was to die for. They took very good care of the birthday boy. We tried alittle of the two desserts they brought him and one of the two was insane.

I am sure glad I did! The VIP (Vodka Infused Pinapple) martini was perfect! The crab cake sitting on Lobster sauce was delicious! No fillers, just crab and seasoning with a cream sauce that I wanted to scrape off the plate. My Lamb chops were​ also delicious and perfectly cooked. My experience with the side dishes speaks well to the service here. I initially got the trio sampler of sides, with Cauliflower Au gratin, mashed potatoes, and brussel sprouts (definitely enough for two people btw). The mashed potatoes were good, but the cauliflower came out cold, and the brussel sprouts were meh. My waiter , who frequently checked on me, brought a new bowl of Cauliflower bubbling in Brie.

It came with the snails on top of bread and covered with an amazing creamy sauce.  My wife who typically doesn't like escargot or cream sauces actually liked it! + lobster mac and cheese = nice large chunks of lobster+ potatoes au gratin = cheesy and packed with flavor+ wagyu tomahawk = sooooooooo tasty. We shared this and it was perfectly done. Nice and juicy, with just the perfect amount of salt. It was almost to beautiful to eat ... almostWe'll definitely be back again!",4,1,3,David L.,"Plano, TX",141,221,579
2.0,7/23/2017,"Experience at Del Frisco's- I had a reservation so I was seating promptly. I noticed right away that the environment was very loud. - The drink menu was not on the table when we arrived. Only the menu, which has a cocktail menu. - I had the porter house steak and it was extremely average. Something I could have grilled in my backyard. - The side of spinach with bacon did not taste good. - The escargot was not traditional. They put it on bread with a heavy sauce. All you could taste was the sauce, not the escargot. That was disappointing. -  The person who served our steaks did not tell us the plates were hot when he put them down and my father burnt his fingers.

5.0,7/22/2017,"This is my favorite steakhouse in NY. You may recognize it from taxi video ads, but don't let that detract you from coming. You simply can't beat the combination of excellent food, service, and ambiance here. FOOD: The steaks are flavored and salted perfectly, cooked to perfection. I regularly eat at Wolfgangs, and Striphouse, but that's only because I couldn't get a reservation here. Del Frisco's steaks are just better. SERVICE: The very first time I came, I thought I spotted doughnuts being brought to a table nearby (they were in fact very large onion rings), and inquired with the waiter, Eamon. I must have looked disappointed that they didn't have doughnuts, but lo and behold, a few minutes later, he appeared with doughnuts he'd run out and bought himself from a place nearby. I was stunned. This is just one example of how above and beyond the service is here.AMBIANCE: While other steakhouses in the city have a claustrophobic vibe, here the ceilings are high, with full windows looking out at 6th from a distance.",1,0,0,Az K.,"New York, NY",346,26,17

I do find it interesting that there are only 2 bathroom stalls on the upper level for so many diners. Anyway for appetizers we shared a couple of things. thick cut bacon, delicious! crab cake appetizer - also delicious.  lobster mac n cheese - this was extremely heavy and if youre lucky may have scooped up some lobster chunks. but being so heavy, you will definitely want to share this with a few people. brussel sprouts - left much to be desired, it was diced up and mixed in with some other cuts of veggies, lacked flavor over all. for the entree i shared the bass fried rice, along with beef short ribs. The bass was nicely cooked and flakey, although not much flavor and the fried rice was not so great. and was on the saltier side. beef short ribs were nice and tender but also lacked a punch. we were just way too full to even get dessert. overall a great meal for a group - and service was attentive but not overbearing. the busboy did drip ice water into one of the wine glasses, almost as if he was careless and really didnt care that he was. other than that, i had a great experience",0,0,0,Sasha C.,"New York, NY",6,939,497

I was initially leery in that this is a chain and despite rave reviews in other cities have passed on the opportunity to dine for that reason. Midtown Manhattan has a slew of great steakhouse chains, but decided to come here and see what I may have been missing. Service etc excellent as expected, drinks etc, good and if course as per usual everything in the city tends to be higher priced, the norm not the exception in NY. The beef! If I had the talent to write a poem about the rib eye, I would do so. What an exceptionally rich, buttery flavor from the fat alone. One of the most ridiculously well marbled steaks I have seen and had the pleasure to eat. Absolutely melt in the mouth rich flavor. We did of course have the sides- potato etc. Will pass on a review of these as they were also well prepared, presented and executed. Well made sides do not make a steakhouse unless your a vegetarian.

4.0,7/10/2017,"After going back and forth about going back to Peter Luger or trying this new place, we decided to stay closer to our hotel and try a new steakhouse. After looking through all the mixed reviews saying PL was better,this place was better, etc...we decided to try ourselves. First off this place is huge; 2 stories and it was not packed when we went on a Sunday evening, maybe because our reservations were a bit later at 8:30pm. We would have had dinner earlier but wanted to do all the sightseeing beforehand. Upon entering the restaurant, the decor was nice and people were friendly. After pondering what to order, we decided to share the massive 32 oz Wagyu tomahawk. Pricier but actually a good deal considering it's 32 oz. My mouth was watering thinking about it but unfortunately our dreams were cut short when the waiter came back and said he put he order in too late and someone else took the last piece! I was super disappointed and nothing at that point sounded good enough, especially when we were looking forward to it. Then the waiter tries to sell us on other cuts saying they could make it as big by combining a New York with a filet etc but we made it clear it wasn't about the quantity of meat but the quality we were looking for. I don't care if you can make 2 other cuts of meat the same ounces, why would it matter. Anyway, decided to go for the porterhouse which was definitely enough for 2 people to share. They ask if you want it cut for you and I remember the last time in NY it seemed better and a NY thing so we opted in. We ordered medium rare and the steak came out on sizzling super hot plate and our plates were also piping hot. The steak came out the right in terms of expecting medium rare. As for the flavor, it was decent, not too salty BUT if I had to rank my top 4 steakhouses, it would not make the list. (For reference my top steak places are: Peter Luger, Mastro's, Delmonico's, Flemings. Yes I said Flemings.) Anyway while the steak at Del Frisco's was cooked right and was decent tasting, it wasn't memorable. Every steak place I mentioned time earlier, I've been impressed and really look forward to as it was an experience. This one, I felt like the texture and taste were just alright. While it was good, given other reviews I read and the price, I kind of expected it to be in my top steak places. All the reviews were comparing to Peter Luger but I honestly don't it compares. The bread they give to all tables isn't all that great. Basically a large hamburger bun with sesame seeds on top and creamed butter to spread. For the appetizer we had the crab cake. It seemed expensive but I've also never been somewhere where they have no breading and it was just all crab molded together into a little cake. For the sides, we ordered asparagus which was nice and light with toasted sliced almonds on top. Also had the lobster mac and cheese which is pretty cheesy and heavy but they do give large chunks of lobster.",4,3,2,Melissa L.,"Silicon Valley, CA",204,414,915
1.0,7/10/2017,"Food was not impressive. I expected soo much more. The crab cakes sucked (a bit too much filler)...the steak was nothing to rave about. Our waiter was also not the friendliest - he was quick to answer questions like we were a hassle. He took forever to check on us...he would be gone for 20 minutes at a time. (The restaurant was NOT super busy.) Usually waiters will at least peek at your table to see if all is OK. There was no peeking. The food took almost 40 minutes to come out - no joke.

2.0,7/6/2017,"I really don't see the hype with this place.  I've eaten at a lot of Steakhouses in the city and the rest of the country and it's safe to say this was my least favorite.  Our 20-something waiter was extremely condescending when it came to ordering the wine and it was a classic example of... if you're not ordering a 250 dollar bottle of wine you're chopped liver (we ordered two bottles too so it wasn't as if we ordered four waters).  I was here on a double date and all four of us were in agreement with regards to the service.  There were definitely other tables popping bottles either on the corporate card or adding to their mounting credit card debt and they most likely would disagree with my views on the service.As for the food, I had the filet mignon and we all shared standard sides (potatoes, asparagus etc).  All of the food tasted like an entire shaker of salt was dumped on each plate.  It seems based on other reviews our group is the minority when it comes to our view on Del Frisco's.  Perhaps it was an off night but given this is NYC and options are endless, I will not be giving them a second chance to find out.",0,1,0,E B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,7,0

When we did order,  he was still short with us but asked us if we wanted bread. The bread never came and when I asked about it he said there wasn't any left. Um ok? Our meals came out relatively fast and I ordered medium steak tips which came out so over seasoned and well done I could barely eat it. My boyfriends steak was cooked ok but it had so much salt that I couldn't even eat some of it.

We were able to make reservations quite easily for calling in only one day before. Service was accommodating and friendly.  Food was mediocre. What's sad is that the side dishes stole the show for us when it really should have been the steaks. My boyfriend and I both asked for our steaks to be medium rare, but when it was presented to us, it was still raw in the middle. It was more rare than it was medium rare, so we had to send it back to cook a bit more. When it came back, it hit the point of no return. It was then medium well instead of what we orginially asked for... Bummer... My favorite dish that we ordered was actually the king crab gnocchi. It was so creamy and rich and the gnocchi was soft and melted in your mouth. I wish it had more king crab in it though. The creamed spinach was also pretty good.

She knew the menu really well. *please note, that this review will be on the food and experience ... not the price ... because frankly, everything here is SO expensive*For the appetizer, we got their special crab cake. Yes, it's more crab than cake, so delicious. For the entrees, we got the 8 ounce filet mignon, bone-in filet mignon, and then bone-in ribeye. I got the ribeye because it was the most popular, and I always felt like the ribeye had the most flavor. However, the filet mignons were delicious and had great flavor. It's so hard to choose, but I'd recommend the bone-in filet mignon because you can't get that as flavorful at really any other steakhouse. Tbh, I chose the ribeye that time because my eyes were won over by the 22 ounces. I think I like my steak medium rare, but I ordered medium this time. Tip: you can always order medium rare and ask them to cook it more as you get to the center and it's too red. The two side dishes that we got were the lobster Mac and Cheese and the king crab gnocchi. Both were heavenly and complemented steak well. (I wonder if I can come back and just order the sides on its own!) I didn't eat much bread (which is a surprise) but the bite that I did have proved that I didn't want to waste my time on it. Don't even touch it! I also had a glass of wine, and let's just say, you know it's quality wine when you taste it.

My wife got the special, a trio filet. It was 3 3 oz pieces of filet w/a different topping on each. She loved it.I would recommend this place to anyone in the area looking for a nice dinner.Also the atmosphere said dressy.

My steak has nice gristle but our sides were overly salted (Brussels sprouts) and the cauli gratin was bland with no gratin crust. Service from some, while good at some points, let a little to be desired. I gave 3 stars for the beauty of the space.

5.0,6/10/2017,"This is a quintessential New York dining experience and a fabulous steakhouse.  The space is traditional steakhouse, but with two story windows on three sides showcasing a panoramic view Of the city and Radio City Music Hall across the street.  They are famous for their prime, cut to order, steaks, with good reason.  They have an amazing wine list.  Our server was terrific and we followed her lead.  She informed us Del Frico's is known for its crab cake and burrata and heirloom tomato salad with reduced balsamic, so we shared those to start.  Both were simply excellent.  Jackie was happy when the cheese with the salad wasn't too soft, which is a texture issue for her.  But it was just fine.  We split the bone in rib eye, with a side of seared fois gras, and both had baked potatoes.  The steak was perfectly cooked, sliced table side and served on uber hot plates which helped the medium rare cook more towards Jackie's preference.They were nicely seasoned and delicious.  The foes gras was succulent.  The potatoes were just fine.  Since we shared everything, once Jackie heard they were famous for their lemon cake with 7 layers, she had to have it.  She was speechless with how much she loved it.  It was very moist and a wonderful way of ending a bucket list dining experience.",2,0,1,Steven G.,"Long Beach, CA",68,225,98

We were surprised they could accommodate 5 people in such short notice. We also got a Hess Cabernet which is excellent. It is good and of excellent value.

4.0,6/9/2017,"We had dinner for four before the theater on Tuesday night. Our reservation was for 5PM but we arrived about 20 minutes early and were seated right away. Service was excellent! Our waiter was attentive and friendly and explained the specials and gave his suggestions. Drinks were very good- loved my Blackberry Martini. As an appetizer we had the shrimp cocktail and crab cake. Both were excellent and well prepared. I ordered the Sea Bass, which was delicious, my husband had the filet special ( 3 small filets with a different sauce on each) which he asked for rare and received exactly perfectly. My son in law had a 12 ounce filet, also cooked perfectly. The only glitch was my daughter's salmon. The first try arrived so dry she could not eat it. It was immediately taken away and a new one ordered. The new one arrived and it was not cooked. She then sent that one back and decided not to have anything else. The manager and our waiter both apologized profusely and offered her whatever she wanted, but she decided she was no longer hungry. They removed it from the bill and our waiter brought us dessert, a delicious order of butter cake, on the house.All in all, I would return to the restaurant, based on the service and the majority of the food.

5.0,6/6/2017,"Best steakhouse experience of my life. From start to finish. I have been to ""high class"" steakhouses at least 20ish times in my life by now. Best waiter I have ever had. I feel bad that I can't remember his name, but it is his fault for bringing a steady stream of VIP's coming.  Thick Bacon - Very great cut, tender and sweet with that kick of savory I love and some roasted peppers on top to add some spice. One order is enough for 4 people to have about a 3 inch section, which was plenty to get the full experience. Three Filet Plate - This was the smartest decision I have ever made. First off 3 filets perfectly cooked at medium rare. I could just end there. But each one came with a sauce on the side that you could put on at your leisure. I don't remember the names of any of them, but each one tasted awesome, and I ended up just dipping my fork in them and licking them. Mac N Cheese - Heavenly. So ooey and gooey with great flavor in every bite, and the noodles perfectly cooked.  Desserts - We had the customary famous lemon cake which was rich as always and a perfect end to the meal, and the butter cake. When our waiter mentioned butter cake I thought... hmm I bet it isn't better than mastro's. 5 seconds later he said, and if you have been to mastro's it is basically the same cake because we stole their pastry chef. To which I responded... ""Well, I never have to go to mastro's again."" The butter cake was moist and tasty... and best of all both were free, because our waiter was the best. THE VERDICT:After our experience I told the couple we were with this would become our end of trip tradition for all our visits to NY. They hadn't had great experiences with other steakhouses before but they had their minds blown with DFs. They might be chasing the dragon from now on because, as I said it was also my best experience ever thanks to our amazing waiter.

2.0,5/18/2017,"My friend has been raving about Del Frisco's for a while, so when my company decided to have our client dinner here, I was ecstatic! Unfortunately, from start to finish, the dinner was quite a disaster. We had reservations and once our full party of ten arrived we were seated at one of the round tables upstairs alongside the balcony. The walkways in the restaurant are very narrow and those in our party sitting on the outer edge of the table kept on getting bumped as waiters and other patrons were walking through. When we expressed this to the manager, he offered to move us to an adjacent table; however, that table was even smaller. In the end, he offered us a long, rectangular table downstairs. To get there, they had us grab our drinks from the table and carry them down the stairs. It was quite a ridiculous sight as the ten of us were each carrying two drinks, one in each hand, and trailing one after the other down the stairs. To make matters worse, they stopped us on the stairs and asked us to stand off to the side as they set up the table. The third table was located in a small alcove in the back of the restaurant. There was already another large party sitting in that space. To make room for us, they put together two four-tops parallel to the other large party. The walkway in between our two tables was even narrower than the one upstairs. Our waitress, who was 7-months pregnant, could not fit through the walkway. The person sitting in the seat most adjacent to the other table kept on having to stand up to let her through. To remedy this, management pulled another four-top and attached it to the other two. With this layout, the seating arrangement became three people on one side sharing the two four-tops closest to the back, one person at the head, and then six people spread out across three four-tops, with the last two people seated on the same side with no one across from them. The sole purpose of this arrangement was to let the waitress and busboys through and even then the walkway was still tight. We had placed our orders while we were still seated upstairs. Because we were relocated, our orders were all messed up. When they brought out our steaks, they had to shout down the table asking who had ordered which steak. The awkward shuffle getting to the meal definitely tainted the meal itself. I ordered the prime ribeye medium and it came out medium well. They had to take it back to re-fire. The second steak they brought out was very rare and at that point I just accepted it. The steak itself wasn't particularly noteworthy. The sides were slightly better. I enjoyed the cauliflower and brie au gratin, spinach supreme, and asparagus with roasted almonds. The rest were average.Perhaps my expectations were too high? However, for a restaurant of such caliber and price point, one should expect impeccable service. I do give them credit for trying to accommodate and making the most of it, but it was obvious that everyone, on both sides - our party and our waitress/busboys, felt uncomfortable. I didn't see the check at the end of the meal so I'm not sure if we were comped for our experience. A manager also never came to formally speak to us about the whole ordeal. Because of all this, I would not choose to come back.Tl;dr: Awkward experience for what was supposed to be a nice business dinner. Food didn't make up for the experience. Won't be coming back.",5,0,0,Jillian L.,"New York, NY",408,323,132

He is amazing with attention to detail and should be recognized by sr. mgmt as such. Our bartender Larry (or Jeff, depending on the day) is always amazing as well. The blonde woman at the host stand always seats us immediately no matter our reservation time when the table is ready, and we can rely on real reservation times vs waiting forever for a reserved table like other restaurants. We love the food, we usually lean towards the ribeye or porterhouse but the filet trio isn't bad and thank god they always have  great king crab legs to eat on the side any time. Good sommeliers that suggested incredible wines for us in the past always. Anytime we request ""a good table"" we get a great one. Seriously, whenever the server Chris passes us by when we are not in his section, he ensures no matter who it is we are well taken care of. That is awesome hospitality: remembering past tables when you're passing by. Pretty solid! Steak is always great. I recommend the ribeye, however the ""filet trio"" special isn't bad for someone who requires sauce for their cuts of beef. It tastes good, but for the price do your mouth a favor and savor the delight and amazement of the ribeye or the porterhouse, or bone in strip which was incredible.

5.0,5/8/2017,"Oh, where to begin...I have to say this was one of the best meals I have ever had. The food was perfect. The service was perfect. There was literally zero room for improvement. I had to read through some of the bad reviews to figure out what on earth anyone could say negatively about this place. Based on these, I would give a few pointers for an amazing experience at this and similar restaurants. First, don't go if you can't order what you want. I read a lot of ""for the price,"" which to me says that they ordered something Del Frisco's doesn't specialize in and then expected it to be spectacular. Skip the appetizer and dessert, get a cheaper glass of wine or go one of a million less expensive but delicious places in NY that you can enjoy the full experience. But don't go to a restaurant like this and try to order items that aren't their best and then expect their best. The reason our experience was perfect was because we let our server guide as on what to order. Sarah (who is amazing, by the way) suggested the bone in filet, sold me on the crab and truffle butter, recommended the crab cake and a few other items and our meal was exactly what we expected. Second, if you're not a high-end steak eater, pay close attention to the temperature descriptions the server gives when you order. A lot of people commented on steaks being undercooked, but in my experience, that is just people who don't understand that four-inch thick steak at medium-rare in a high-end restaurant has a significant, red center that is not fully hot in the middle. Especially when ordering a filet, it's not a bad idea to go up a temperature if you're not used to that thick of a steak. Anyway, that's my soapbox. If you go with the right expectations and just enjoy the ride, this place is pretty much perfect.",4,1,0,Melissa R.,"Tempe, AZ",11,9,1

When you order your steaks they allow you to cut into it and make sure it's cooked just right. It actually wasn't - and we sent both back for a little extra cooking and char. They came back much better. I had the filet and my husband had the rib eye. My husband thought his was great. He was happy. It wasn't the most amazing steak he ever had but it was very good. My filet was also good but not the most tender I've ever had. I had higher hopes for a prime filet. I've had steaks I could cut with a butter knife they're so tender but this filet wasn't as tender as I would have hoped. The side dishes we ordered weren't memorable. Over all - it was a lovely dining experience. Of course it was very expensive as to be expected with a high end steakhouse in NYC. Perfect for special occasions! I would go back but I still want to find the perfect filet someplace else my next NYC trip.",1,0,0,Lauren P.,"Delray Beach, FL",76,176,169
5.0,5/7/2017,"Me and my family came here on 4/22 for my dad's 60th birthday. The starters (crab cakes, wedge salad - mmm that bacon and blue cheese! - and bacon au poivre) were delicious, and mains were just fantastic! One of the best steaks I've ever had, the bone-in ribeye, was just salt and pepper and butter, and it was more than enough. Excellent ratio of salt and sweet and fat. I don't think around the table there was any meat left on any bones. And the sides both on and off the menu, were scrumptious. And I'd be very happy to live on that Signature Drink and that lemon cake presented to my dad. And a special thanks to our waiter that evening, Alex, who was just so sweet and so charming, and was so good with guiding us to the right good and drinks to try. Staff was swift and attentive, and even though we were seated up a prime table and hung out a little longer than usual, we never felt like they were eager for us to leave. (If I have any qualms, it's that the restrooms were on the second floor. A few drinks, and those stairs are a little tough to maneuver! The other is dress code. I saw it was smart casual, but was then told there was no dress code. Thankfully most dressed nicely, but the party next to us was in Rangers jerseys and sweatpants. Would a polo of clean button-down kill ya?)Those little things aside, thank you to the  staff for making the evening run so smoothly and deliciously, and to Alex for being just so great to us that evening!!",0,0,0,Dan R.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",0,4,2

Not only was the food incredible, but the service met the standard expected of a restaurant like this. I say this particularly due to how they ""corrected"" a mistake that was made. The sides came out much much later than the mains, which was clearly a mistake. In turn all of our sides (4) were comped and they brought out 4 free deserts which were absolutely stunning. The food was superb and they paired a perfect wine for us. Above all, I appreciated how they professionally handled the sides situation.

We planned to have dinner at this place before we went to go see a broadway play. We were running late to dinner because we were stuck in traffic coming from Long Island. We called the restaurant and told them we might be late. They told us it was not a problem they have a 15minute grace period. I'm like great! We told them we might pass that grace period also. They noted it down that we are running late. We got to the restaurant at 5:50 pm way passed the grace period. The restaurant was so understanding and they sat us immediately. We were great for that. We started off with the oyster for the table. The oysters were fresh and were gone before I could even take a picture of them. My wife ordered the crab cake entree. They are served with two crab cakes and with an amazing tasting orange sauce. It's the second time she ordered the crab cakes and probably will order it a third time when we go again!I ordered the Porter house steak. This steak is one of the best steaks I ever had.

The meat tasted like freezer burn.  It was so disappointing.  When I spoke with one of my business partners, she told me she had a similar experience.  I wish I knew that before hand. Third, the price point for food and drinks is obnoxiously high.  Definitely  not even close to worth it.   Finally, I was with others who also ordered rib eye, and others order filet.  Not one person enjoyed their meat, not one.",4,1,2,Robert S.,"Livingston, NJ",16,364,0

I was so excited because of the reviews so I made a reservation two weeks prior for Saturday (04-15) at 8pm and I noted on the reservations that I was celebrating my anniversary. When we arrived at about 7:55pm, our table was not ready until about 8:20pm. The host was very nice and apologetic. We sat on the top and our table was near the cigar lounge which didn't really give us a view but that was okay. We we're also located right next two big table tops that we're filled by young men so you can imagine how loud and obnoxious they were. I wasn't so bothered by that though. What I was bothered about was, we saw our waiter TWICE. Once when he grabbed our order and gave us the delicious bread and butter. And to bring my husband his cocktail. Our food was brought out by the bus boys and we we're not asked how we we're doing or if we needed anything else. I will say, the ribeye was delicious (it literally melted in your mouth) and the crab cake itself was good but I personally didn't like the lobster sauce under it. The bus boys were very accommodating on refiling our water and taking our empty dishes away. But shortly after, we were not asked if we wanted/needed anything else and all we received was the bill by another waiter. We we're so full we didn't want desert anyways but I thought they would at least acknowledge it was our anniversary.

3.0,4/6/2017,"Not a bad steakhouse prior to enjoying any show. My bar is pretty set high by this little place in Brooklyn so it's tough to go beyond one of the best steaks I've had in life.But I will say this I've been to Del Frisco thrice - two in NYC and the one in Houston.All three times my mind was halfway blown. Now ambience, drinks, wine list - perfect, nothing short of what you would expect from a major steakhouse in a bustling city.So the steak. Well, let's make like a Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever rash and work our way from outside to in. The sides - creamed spinach, mushrooms and onions and the potatoes au gratin - superb! The sides and dessert were phenomenal. The mushrooms and onion sautee was fantastic, with the right seasoning and cook. The potatoes were delish and accompanied literally everything. I love spinach so they could literally spit in it and I wouldn't have a bad thing to say. The cuts.I've tried three cuts at each Del Frisco visit. I don't think location should matter nor does it in this scenario but I have to say I was quite disappointed for such a well known, reputable steakhouse with decent prices. Let's start with the best steak I have had at a Del Frisco establishment - the Wagyu Tomahawk cut. This was delicious. Perfectly cooked, the right amount of moo and blood, and the overall cut was just phenomenal. This is one of the best non Peter Luger steaks I have had and is easily my favorite (well, tied with the Prime Porterhouse at Keens). So this was memorable and I would recommend getting this cut if you can.The other cuts I have had were the bone in Filet - which was cooked well, but the cut just didn't do it for me. I get mine medium rare and it just still felt chewy. The final cut I had was the Prime Ribeye and this was fairly decent. Cooked to perfection, decent cut, but still didn't have that melt in your mouth sensation upon first bite and swallow that other places and cuts have done for me.Definitely worth checking out but I don't know if busy nights or weekends affect the assembly line of steaks at the NYC location whereby metaphorical steak ""lemons"" are handed out.Expected more, that's all I am saying. Overall, not bad for a date night or intro for someone who wants to try steak in NYC or other places.",2,0,1,Abhishek P.,"San Diego, CA",8,84,2

3.0,4/5/2017,"Let me start by saying two appetizers on the menu enticed me more than the steak here, and so I ordered two appetizers; the king crab gnocchi and the lobster mac and cheese, for my main course, and the escargot for my appetizer. The first thing I tried was the complimentary bread, it was very good! Both the gnocchi and the macaroni came with a generous helping of lobster/crab mixed in which was great, but the overall dishes themselves fell through for me. I found them rather bland and whatever sauces/cheeses they used didn't really compliment the dishes nor did they serve to add any flavor or depth. The escargot on the other hand was delicious, by far the best I've ever had. Warm burgundy snails atop toasted baguettes soaked in garlic basil butter accompanied by diced tomatoes and prosciutto. Delicious, as well as the perfect portion size, with just enough of the burgundy topped toasted baguettes to soak up the last of the garlic basil butter at the bottom of the bowl. I also had the chance to sample the onion rings as two lofty towers constructed of the tasty treats ended up on our table at some point during the meal. I'm not sure if someone ordered them or if they came on the house but however it happened there they were, a complete surprise, much like a marriage proposal but greater because these rings could be eaten. Lastly dessert, and again I couldn't decide and so I wound up ordering both the banana bread pudding and the butter cake. I spent the whole time panicking,trying to pick which one I liked best as they both diminished in size(Sharing is caring but it's not necessarily ideal when it comes to dessert) therefore, I didn't really get to enjoy these desserts as much as I'd have liked to. Not the restaurants fault and in no way will this effect my rating, I just can't really comment on the desserts in detail here accurately. Without detail, what I will say is that both desserts were very sweet. Despite my love for the escargot and the rings, I am giving Del Frisco 3 stars. Half the food I loved and the other half I didn't, and latter were the appetizers I was depending on to make up my main meal.",0,0,0,Adam B.,"West Windsor Township, NJ",16,37,412

Hands down she's a five solid stars, I'd request to be in her section at future visits.The food...4.5/5- crab cake, OK it is a pricey cake, but this thing is 95% crab with just 5% of other stuff. It is incredibly good like you're just getting good quality crab. I wish they gave a little more of the sauce that accompanies the dish.3/5- Porterhouse steak, The meet was pretty good, we were aiming for a more medium with a touch of medium well but it came out more medium well. I enjoyed having the sizzling plates that cook the steak a bit more but nothing about the steak really stood out compared to their competitors. It was just a good steak.2/5- gratin potatoes this tasted like boiled potatoes which you use for potato salad thrown in with some creamy binder substance and then topped with cheddar cheese. Honestly it tasted like one of those Wendy's stuffed baked potatoes. We gave it to the homeless guy who was panhandling outside the door, he didn't seem too excited and quickly put it down next to the rest of the leftovers other patrons had given him. Nb he wants change not food.2/5 bread- it's just blah in the water that is served with it is pretty low quality2/5- Soft drinks are so packed with ice it's about 15% drink so the glass needs refilling after 3 sips lol. 4/5- the butter cake. Read the other reviewsI give my waitress, Liz, a solid five stars. But the overall food, waits from reservation time, area for waiting a two-three.

When we pointed this out to him, he looked at us flatly - did not seem surprised at all, never apologized once, and gave a very odd excuse for the mix-up.

4.0,3/20/2017,"No reservation on a Sunday night, but didn't have much trouble snagging a table for 4 parents eager for a night out. Starters - crab cake, slab bacon, tuna tartare, wagyu beef carpaccio. Crab cake gets lots of accolades, but I don't think a crab cake should win any awards for simply being good crab without a lot of filler. I'm not a tartare fan but my companions enjoyed it. Carpaccio was my favorite starter, bacon a close second. Props to the wonderful sommelier, Josh, on his great recommendation of the 2014 Adaptation Cabernet. If you like wine, don't simply rely on your Vivino app. Take the time to have a nice conversation with the sommelier. Two filets and two rib eyes, creamed spinach, mashed potatoes, lobster Mac and cheese, baked potato (when you dine with 3 Irish people, there will always be a healthy spud selection) made up dinner. Everyone was very happy with their medium steak cooks (the plates are super hot, so if you feel like your cook is a little under, use the plate to finish it off). All the sides were standard steakhouse fare and very satisfying. For dessert we enjoyed the creme brûlée and butter cake. In an overall satisfying dinner, the butter cake was outstanding. I want it for dessert every day. Obviously expensive, but a reliable steakhouse that might not change your life forever, but will never disappoint.",1,0,0,Cydnee R.,"New York, NY",104,41,10

3.0,3/9/2017,"Frisco's, as I refer to it as, was this years choice for my family birthday dinner. We had a 6:30 reservation, but I changed it to 5:30 to get the 1,000 Open Table points, but I'm glad I did, because this place gets packed, and packed in a hurry. Once my complete party arrived, we were seated immediately and taken to the second level. A server came over quickly, actually too quickly, I didn't even get to push my chair in before he was there. Anyhow, as I was tucking myself in and reading a work e-mail, the server was conversing with my aunt, and that's when things turned a little sour for her. I wasn't paying attention, but she later informs me, that the waiter proceeded to tell her the cost of items without being prompted for said information. She felt offended, as if she lacked the funds necessary to eat here. I took it with a grain of salt, but she did mention it again during the course of the evening, and I felt bad because while I wouldn't have taken it poorly, she did.After that whole scenario, we ordered the following items: Pan Chicken, Calamari, Mashed Potatoes, Lobster Mac and Cheese, Filet (12oz), Calamari, and two other items for some reason I cannot recall. I had the filet which was over cooked, the Mac was ok, but nothing over the top. The same can be said for the mashed potatoes, I will say the portions are very large for the sides and don't make the mistake of ordering multiples if you're not a large group.As it was my birthday the waiter comp'd the strawberry cheesecake and one of signature drinks. I requested a second drink, but the manager misunderstood and thought I said no. He said the drink would be free for the confusion, which was nice. Ultimately, after the check was paid, it became awkward because while we didn't feel rushed, I noticed staffers standing very close by so they could immediately the clean the table and get ready for the next group; its basically run like an assembly line. Frisco's is impressive; huge windows with views of Avenue of the Americas, nice bar on the ground level and overall nice décor. However, while truly impressive, certain aspects of the night ultimately subtracted from what should have been a great experience. The food was average, but the prices were above average. There were simply too many tables jammed into the otherwise attractive space; and it became extremely loud--you basically have to yell, hunchor even lean over to speak at your own table.

2.0,3/4/2017,"YOU HAD ONE JOB! Cook the steak correctly. They did not do that. We ordered the 24 ounce porterhouse medium rare. I don't see what could be clearer or easier for a steakhouse to prepare. Surely a steakhouse that actually cares about its customers would get that right, wouldn't they? And know when they are sending something out that doesn't match up? Which would indicate that a steakhouse that sends out a steak it knows it cooked way, way wrong either a) doesn't care about its customers or, b) is just hoping you're too stupid to know any better or they can just take your money and get away with it. Our porterhouse -- that's $63, by the way -- arrived medium-well in the dead center, and i'm being kind by granting them that level of doneness. In fact, the tail end of the strip-side of the porterhouse was well done -- the last 2-3 inches of it were cooked entirely through and gray.  So of course you have a choice: eat it, because you're starving, and deal with the fact that you dropped $400 for a night based around a steak you could have done better yourself at home for $15; or send it back and have an uncomfortable 20+ minutes while your companions wait, their food growing cold and everyone feeling like the night's kinda ruined. Not to mention: they sent this out to us. So, see above, they either didn't care that we'd feel this way, or they were hoping we were too stupid to know the difference. So we ate it. $400 for a night based around a steak an average beginner cook could have done better for around 1/20th the cost. Sorry guys, i won't be back. I recommend others look elsewhere.

After we were finished our meal and paid the bill, it began to rain heavily. Kenny tracked us down as we were leaving the restaurant and ask if we had brought an umbrella with us. We did not, at which point Kenny presented us with a complimentary umbrella. He truly went above and beyond. And we would definitely go back for another visit.  Kenny's extra effort cancelled out the fact that the filet was over done. In fact, the filet was still delicious.

I had to steal from my gfs plate as she has a trio of three 4oz steaks which I thought was very creative. It was definitely good steak, you won't be disappointed.

It was a busy night. Okay. Water glass eventually had nothing but ice left. Server and staff walked around back and forth. My husband drank the ice and our server did manage to glance over.... but did nothing. Still no water. I see her at the table next to us so I purposely poured some of my water into his glass. Nope. Never got that water refill.On the bright side, food wasn't disappointing at all. Ordered the crab cake- large chunks of delicious crab. Steak was ginormous and super super juicy.

It is pineapple-y without being too sweet, and it went down easy. Two thumbs up for the signature cocktail.We were shown to our table through the crowded dining room (9pm reservation on a Friday) and seated. The hostess and waitstaff were professional and engaging. I ordered the NY strip steak, and my husband ordered the porterhouse rare. The waiter went on to explain that there are three different types of ""rare"" they do there, which was a fun learning tidbit, and my husband opted for the ""hot plate rare."" We ordered the mushrooms and onions side as well as the Brie cauliflower. The food came in a reasonable amount of time and it was supreme, as advertised. The steaks were top notch, and the waiter waited to confirm that they were cooked as you want before leaving (he had us cut into them to confirm). The sides were delicious. I had enough leftover to take home for lunch, and they packed that up for me.For dessert we got the crime brûlée, which we insisted the waiter taste with us (he obliged), and I had a glass of port.

I found that to be a very unique thing to have. They do coat check. My girlfriend made reservations so we didn't have to wait too long.(5mins tops)We were seated upstairs near the window so we had a great view. We came for restaurant week. Our server Diane was amazing. She was super friendly, helpful, and had a keen eye. The food: we both got the lobster bisque, I had the filet mignon while she had the salmon, and we decided to get one of each cheesecake.First and foremost, the bread was legendary. Honestly the best complimentary bread I have ever had. I wasn't too fond of the sesame seeds but that bread was to die for. It was warm and extremely fluffy. It was like I was eating a cloud. And the butter was very light.It was my first time eating lobster bisque so I wasn't too sure what it was suppose to taste like as well as if it was a high quality bisque. The first few sips were okay but the soup grows on you. Was definitely worth the upgrade. Very creamy and rich but not overpowering. A few lobster pieces in there as well.The mignon was cooked perfectly. They ask you to cut it in half to see if it's just right for you so they could make adjustments if needed. It came with mashed potatoes. Delicious as well. The steak was seasoned well. No complaints.The salmon also came with potatoes. There wasn't anything too special about the salmon. It had a nice sear on but as for flavor, nothing special. It might have been because our salmon was slightly cold when we got it but we didn't want to say anything because it wasn't a big deal. Save room for dessert because these cheesecakes were bomb.com.net.org.edu.gov. The strawberry cheesecake was whipped a little more than the pecan. So it tasted like two completely different desserts. For the crust they use toasted nuts which definitely changed the flavor once you reach the end. Both cheesecakes were very light and delicious. We will definitely be coming back.

3.0,2/17/2017,"This review is for the restaurant week deal Feb 2017.Started with bread and butter. It was the fluffiest loaf of bread I have every seen. It was delicious. Lobster bisque: 5/5This lobster bisque was a little spicy and definitely not what I expected. It was delicious, though. Very unique and different, which is good. Filet Mignon 8 oz(med-rare) with potatoes: 3.5/5The plate came out on a nearly cold plate and he had us cut it to make sure it was medium rare. Good piece of meat, though I didn't taste any special seasoning. It was good with some salt. I feel like I paid exclusively for the meat, and this STEAK HOUSE heated it up and served it on a plate to me. Didn't really do anything special to it. Potatoes were nicely seasoned if not a obviously buttery. Went well paired together. Salmon filet with potatoes: 2/5It looked gorgeous with an orange sauce, but frankly neither the salmon nor the sauce had any special taste to it. It was kind of bland. Had to spice it up with some salt, and I usually don't season my food. The salmon was also pretty cold. Overall unappealing. The buttery potatoes helped make up for it. It was unfortunately disappointing. Pecan butterscotch cheesecake: 10/5This (and the bread) was our favorite part of the meal, probably. This cheesecake was huge and more than enough for two people. Beautifully plated, wonderfully crafted. The cheesecake was full of flavor. There were toasted nuts on the edge, and the butterscotch caramel was so delicious. I plan on going back just for this slice of cheesecake at some point.Strawberry cheesecake: 3/5While the pecan cheesecake tasted like there were 20 different flavors in it, this one tasted 70% of whipped cream. It probably would have been amazing if we didn't have the other to compare. However, we took it home and pulled it from the fridge two days later, and the whipped cream taste subsided and it tasted way better.Service: 5/5Our waitress Diane was the best. She always filled our waters, checked if we wanted more bread, scraped the crumbs off our tables, and most importantly, she caught that my boyfriend was left handed and set his plates and utensils accordingly. He was really blown away this - he said usually no one ever catches that. She is very attentive and very cheerful. Definitely a professional.Overall 3.5 rating: low rating for its star dishes, but the little things made the experience better than it could have been. Hoping it was an off day for them.",0,1,0,Wei Teresa C.,"New York, NY",92,117,214

Enjoyed sitting up stairs but as we were leaving the bar looked lively and ladies, it was packed with men!Started with the tomato and burrata salad and the beef carpaccio . Yum! So good!Then we tried a special with 3 petite fillets with different toppings, lobster sauce, black truffle and gorgonzola. Had Brussels sprouts with the fillets. Holy cow this was good! Steak cook to order and all toppings were good enough to dip you fresh hot bread in! Had a Willamette Valley Pinot Noir. Loved it.   Dessert was bread pudding with caramel sauce.

2.0,2/15/2017,"Expectations coming here was high and fricos didn't live up to its hype... at least for me. Our server left our wine list and dinner menus on the table until our steaks came out and thats when i asked him to take it. Steak was burnt and I'm sure it is because we came in on a later reservation (11:15pm) and cooks wanted to leave. And since we were hungry we ate it. Also our heirloom tomato was mushy and the icing on the cake is the waiter dropped off my check right after giving us our dessert. Restaurant inside looks beautiful but the hype is NOT real. Better off trying another steakhouse with so many options in NYC. I wanted to give this 3 stars but being a ""double eagle"" steakhouse this experience was below average.",1,0,0,Andrea T.,"Boca Raton, FL",16,146,76
4.0,2/14/2017,"Steak was cooked great and you can tell they knew what they were doing. We ordered the strip and the filet. Both were tender but my fiancee said it was not the best filet she has had. The strip had the right amount of fat and meat. However, the sides were underwhelming. The potato gratin was the most average i have had in a long time. The caesar salad did not have much flavor and just tasted like lettuce. It was bad. Best side was the lobster mac and cheese. It was creamy and i couldnt stop eating it.  The bread that came at the beginning of the meal was also quality. Also the dessert was the highlight of the meal. The pound cake with butter pecan ice cream and caramel sauce. It was legit.I had to give it food stars based on the fact it was overpriced and some items food were not spectacular. The decor is cool and place is neat but the overall quality of the meal did not justify the cost.  You come here expecting top of the line food and some things just fell flat.  This should be a 3.5 star place. I will say the service was 5 stars. Best service you will get in the city. Waitress was fantastic. There are other steakhouses in the city. We will probably try somewhere else before coming back.",2,1,2,Nicholas G.,"Hoboken, NJ",4372,1076,2695
4.0,2/13/2017,"I came here on a Saturday, the weekend before Valentine's day and that was a big mistake. My boyfriend made reservations 3 weeks ago for 8:30pm and we waited an hour to get seated. It is a disappointment that such an upscale steakhouse would overbook reservations and let it impact customer's satisfaction. The entire waiting area and entrance was packed with patrons waiting to be seated and those picking up their coat at the coat check. Once we were seated, the service was quick. We both had a sense of what we want to order, using our wait time to browse the menu online. I wanted bone in ribeye and he wanted the wagyu tomahawk. I warned my boyfriend 32oz is huge but he claims he's soo hungry he can eat his order and finish mine as well. Let's just say he was quiet at the end of our meal when we had to wrap our leftovers to go. We started with 2 glasses of red wine, the Del frisco's house wine ($18) and one recommended by our waiter that's more top notch than the house wine ($20). I would recommend the top notch one as it's smoother and only $2 difference. We also got a crab cake to share and it was delicious! As many said, it's all crab meat and hardly any fillers and tasted very fresh. Since we're both getting a decent sized steak, we ordered only one side, lobster mac and cheese. I am glad we didn't order more starters and sides because we were both so stuffed. My bone in rib eye was cooked the way I wanted, medium rare. It was super flavorful, maybe even borderline salty for my sensitive palate. My boyfriend's wagyu tomahawk was not as flavorful as mine, but the meat was more tender and juicy. I like both our dish so it really depends on your preference. On to the lobster mac and cheese, it was really good and cheesyyy although I wish there were more pieces of lobsters. We ended the night with creme brulee which was not bad. Perhaps it's because I was stuffed but it tasted pretty standard. Overall, I wish my first experience here wasn't close to Valentine's day because the long wait took away what could've been a 5 star rating. The food is delicious and worthy the visit, but the long wait ruined the dining experience.",1,1,1,Julie C.,"Brooklyn, NY",198,104,241

The steaks are the best in the area (and I eat at a lot of steak houses because my husband loves steak) and their wine list is amazing. The staff is all as professional as they come. My personal fave is their Brie cauliflower.  No idea how they do it but I have tried to make it at home and it isn't even close. My husband loved their creamed spinach!

(they ask you to cut it to inspect right away) I also loved the pepper seasoning (which brought out flavor but did not overpower). It was perfection. 6 oz was also more than enough. The chocolate mousse was very good, and I can taste European chocolate but I thought it was quite a heavy way to end the meal (despite the fact that it was a mousse). I think thats the only thing I can nitpick: the mousse was not whipped enough/too heavy.

Finally a hostess comes back and seats us in the back corner with the worst lighting you'll ever see. Crab cakes were cold but lots of crab (30 dollars) Bone in filet was good, however their medium rare is more like rare. Cold in the center and too rare for my liking. I expect red and warm throughout and felt like I was eating a cold cow. The cut was good though. Plates were very hot which means they warm them on their plates. I've sat upstairs before and I've had much more attentive service and much better food. Mashed potatoes were good, cold in the center again. King crab gnocchi was ok, little too fishy for my liking but the only warm thing.Cheesecake was ok, I'm used to better presentation and larger slices from them but I think the bottom dwellers get the worst of the worst for the same price, if not less. No free cake or drink like I usually get when coming here with my family on a bday. Just very odd to see how the bottom tables are treated here.

We were placed in a ""private"" area which was closed off by a wall. This is a huge restaurant and the ambiance is loud. We showed up for a late reservation around 8 or 9 o'clock and the place was packed. It is dark and fancy. They have a coat check and be sure to dress to impress. Most diners seemed to be traveling business people or people taking clients out for dinner. There are many tables for dining on the main level. We were directed up a long staircase to where our private room was. There is also dining space up here for those not dining in a large group. We were served a signature drink, or maybe everyone gets this upon arrival, that was some sort of pineapple shot/cocktail. It was the bomb. Others asked for more of this drink throughout the night. We had our choice of red wine that was left on the table for us and were served all kinds of appetizers. The appetizers are what did me in. They kept bringing around these shrimp that they served from one white plate to the one in front of you as you requested. The same applied to the bread, it was brought out by servers who placed it on the plate for you. By the time the steak came, I was stuffed. WARNING! The plate is hot. I heard the message and didn't make the mistake of grabbing it. The steak is huge and phenomenal. I could not finish it due to overeating on all the pre-course items that were brought our way. Sides of potatoes and other items are brought to the table where you can dollop them on to your plate.

My husband had the Boneless 16oz Prime Rib eye Medium rare which was cooked perfect. Flavors were also excellent. But my 22oz steak with bone-in was a little smaller than my husbands 16oz steak which was disappointing because we also payed more for it. I mean it didn't had that much meat that we expected to be.

5.0,1/6/2017,"Del Friscos is by far my favorite steakhouse anywhere in the country, it may be because I popped my ""Fine Steakhouse"" cherry at the Del Friscos in Las Vegas, but Ive never been disappointed with any aspect of their restaurants. Don't waste your time going to Peter Lugers, totally overrated and horrible service. FOOD: 5/5Bone in Filet- They only use the best of the best for their cuts of beef. Cooked perfectly medium rare, juices were flowing and flavor was excellent. Potatoes Au Gratin- So potatoe-y and so cheesy. Exceptional flavors Lobster mac n cheese- They don't go all cheap on your with the chunks of lobster. There is a reason they call it lobster mac n cheese and not Mac n Cheese with lobster. Huge chunks of buttery lobster and perfectly cooked and seasoned Mac n Cheese. Love it. Creme Brulee- Good hell, I love their CB. Great texture and the right amount of sugar brulee on top. IN CONCLUSION-Yes you can go to some of the more historic steak houses in NYC or you can go to a modern one and have better food and service. Here is a little secret. If your hipster friends won't think you are cool for going to a modern steakhouse, Just check-in on Yelp at the older steak houses and your friends will still think you are super hip.",0,0,0,Aaron S.,"Rexburg, ID",94,198,126

I couldn't stand to think my food would get cold as i eat, so i asked to move and they magically found a table upstairs. The hostesses were very sweet and kind, i would see their lowet butts if they bent down, but im not complaining. My waiter was ehh, somewhat knowledgeable, talked to us like we never had been to a steakhouse,but eventually caught on that we knew more then them. Once even changing our plates. But leaving the dirty plate on the table, i wasnt thrilled with the service this time.Appetizers: stick with the bacon, and tuna tartar, and crab cakes, AMAZING and worth it. Onion rings are for looks, greasy and big. Escargot was bland, and the shrimp remoulade was shrimp cocktail with a fancy dijon,Not worth it. Maybe should of tried the marinated shrimp instead.Steaks: I had the trio and was disappointed when the steaks arrived and watched 6 other people plates look amazing, dont get it. It was a 3 filets with toppings each of one had truffle sauce, a lobster topping, and a blue cheese. All of these toppings could of been asked for on the side,smh... others ordered the bone in filet, bone in rib eye, prime ribeye, and my hubby got the wagyu tomahawk chop. NO complaints the steak hasn't changed, just the sides. Remember u can order the blue cheese, truffle butter on the side. Everyone's steak was perfectly cooked.Sides: mashed potatoes very good. Asparagus tasted burnt. Lobster mac very good, but skimpy on the lobster and drowned in butter, not like previous visits. Mushrooms were amazing.

It wins on appearance though, that's for certain.They lost me on their sides.  Mashed potatoes, shaved sprouts, and lobster mac & cheese were all mediocre.  Gigantic onion rings though.Their Old Fashioned wasn't very good either, bartender didnt take the time to muddle the orange and cherry, just tossed it into the glass.  Too much club soda, it's not supposed to be a mixed drink.Service was excellent.

4.0,12/2/2016,"Del Frisco's is a solid choice among NY steakhouses.  Centrally located near Rockefeller Center, the restaurant presents a visually appealing interior and, frequently, visually stunning staff members.  The restaurant caters to a well-heeled, business expense account crowd -- and prices are accordingly significant.    A steakhouse must rise and fall on the quality of the steak, and on this measure Del Frisco is a 4-star steak joint.  I still believe it is a step behind Peter Lugars and Keens, but it is absolutely in that next tier.  Del Frisco does not have a ""house steak,"" so I gravitate to the Porter House.  It comes out well-charged and extremely flavorful. Apps are good with particular focus on shell-fish (crab claws and lobster bisque are strong).  Servers are exceptionally knowledgeable and friendly, though they tend to put a hard sell on high-ticket items.  The wine list is fantastically deep but the mark-up is steep and value bottles are rare. The mark-up is higher than NYC average.",0,0,0,Brooke Y.,"Bedford, NY",6,164,5

We had a party of 8 and ordered two of each which was enough to have a good taste before our meals . The steaks were cooked to perfection and the sides were creamed spinach , cauliflower au gratin which was amazing . Along with lobster Mac n cheese and onion rings.

5.0,11/23/2016,"When it comes to New York the choices of ""great"" steakhouses are plentiful and for an out of towner like myself, where time and money are precious decisions like this are crucial.I wish I had some cool culinary reason for choosing Del Friscos, but I am just going to be real I figured if it was good enough to mentioned in ""Law Abiding Citizen"" I figured it was good enough for me. I will just say that If I was in jail and I requested my last meal it would more than likely come from here.There is only so much I can say about steak that hasn't been said a million time over. We know the steak is gonna be good. This is what they do. We know the quality of beef is going to top notch and Del Friscos didn't fail to disappoint on either. (note: I had the filet topped with king crab and truffle butter...dont think I really have to explain much further)So, let me back up a bit before the main dish and start with something every carnivore must try if you happen to walk into this place. The Thick Cut Bacon Au Poivre. I am a southern boy, Tennessee born and raised. There are things in life such as country breakfast nestled in the smoky mountains of Tennessee that you just cannot replicate.

3.0,11/18/2016,"Some nights ago my best friend and myself decided to visit this steakhouse after being recommended by some colleagues in the hospitality industry. We were excited and had high expectations but the experience ended in dissapontment.Our server Amber was very friendly and attentive. I ordered a bottle of red wine from Spain (my expertise) and was brought another one since they ran out of the one I requested. The wine wasn't bad but it was a lower end from the one I was expecting.We ordered shrimp cocktail as appetizer and it was delicious and almost half way through the bottle of wine we finally managed to get water at the table. Then we ordered our main courses. I requested the bone in ribeye steak and my friend had the waygu kobe strip. The ribeye was absolutely delicious, tender and flawlessly cooked. As I'm enjoying my steak I looked at my friend's sad face when she told me her kobe strip was COLD. We couldn't believe it! My friend let the server know about the issue and the staff rushed to get us a hot plate that ended up over cooking the steak right before our eyes. My friend didn't want to finish her steak but both of us being in the hospitality industry we hate to send dishes back so I ate my steak and hers. At the end of our dinner I talked to the manager and let him know we weren't angry but very dissapointed. To add to our dissapointment, the management made no attempt to make our experience a bit better.In the end, the overall experience was not worth the money. At this level of dinning you would expect everything to be perfect and although things can happen (understandably), one thing after another had us dissatisfied.

5.0,11/15/2016,"This restaurant has definitely spoiled me. I don't normally eat steak as its quite pricey but when I feel like it I would only come back here. I always recommend my overseas visitors to come here now if they want to have amazing steak. The staff at this restaurant was professional and attentive. For example, they heat up your plates before serving the steaks, so it helps the steaks stay juicey and not get cold as quickly.  I came here twice with family and friends and shared steaks so I've had the chance to try the Prime Ribeye, Prime Strip, and Prime Porterhouse. In my opinion, the prime ribeye was the best. It's also the most fatty out of the three cuts and each bite melted in my mouth. I've tried really expensive steaks at home in the past and nothing compares to this in terms of price and taste. I can see how it could be on the heavier side if you're eating the steak by yourself though, so if you want something equally as tasty but less fatty, then go for the prime strip. The porterhouse is good but it wasn't as fatty or flavorful as the other two cuts. I've also tried the Double Cut Lamb Chops. These were great even though I don't usually like the taste of lamb. However, I find that their medium rare was more on the rare side, So I would recommend getting medium.There's a good selection of sides to go with the steaks. I can never have steak without the sides. I'm usually more excited about the sides than the steak itself. The onion ring tower seems to be pretty popular. I've tried the Spinach Supreme (creamed spinach), French Fries, Maque Choux Corn and Shaved Brussels Sprouts. They're all delicious though I find the shaved brussels sprouts to be a bit salty. If you get the french fries, ask for the avocado ranch dip (it's not on the menu). It was amazing with the fries.In terms of dessert, we tried the six layer lemon cake. It's huge so I would recommend sharing especially since the steak is filling. The cake is spongey and the lemon jam was nice. It was nice item to end the night with. Overall, the restaurant ambiance, service and food were impeccable, which made for a classy and enjoyable evening. It's totally worth your money.

3.0,11/7/2016,"Came here for dinner last Wednesday night - ordered the 32 oz Wagyu Tomahawk Chop, 16 oz Prime Ribeye, Lobster Macaroni and Cheese, Chateau Mashed Potatoes, Spinach Supreme (creamed spinach), and their signature lemon cake.The steaks were cooked perfectly - medium-rare.  Delicious, although the pepper seasoning/rub was a tad overdone on both.  The cuts had an ideal amount of fat on them as well.  The Wagyu Tomahawk is adequate for two; I shared that with my boyfriend while my dad ordered his own ribeye.Lobster Macaroni and Cheese was rich with generously large lobster pieces.  Skip the mashed potatoes, they were oversalted and overpowered the meal.  There really was nothing ""supreme"" about their version of creamed spinach, either, besides the fact that it was ""supremely"" bland.My dad and boyfriend didn't care much for the cake (said it was too sweet), but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The icing itself was undeniably sugary, but the cake itself was not and offset it well!  It wasn't overly moist nor dry and was a sizeable portion for all three of us to share.Despite being seated upstairs, tucked away in a booth, which was very preferable, the noise level made it impossible for us to easily hold a conversation (and we're all quite loud people.)  The sound wasn't well absorbed, even with the carpeted floors, probably because of the large picture windows.  I thought the views were just fine, but my dad didn't think they were anything special.The service left a lot to be desired.  The booth beside us had a vivacious, friendly waiter who gave enthusiastic introductions to the menu and recommendations, while our waiter was stern and virtually taciturn.  Very terse and stolid.  Perhaps he was having a bad day, but it was definitely palpable and dampened our initially content moods.  You'd think his no-nonsense demeanor would yield meticulous, flawless service, but he haphazardly cleaned the breadcrumbs after our meal and was rather cavalier about everything in general.I did appreciate how they took notice of my OpenTable reservation comments, where I mentioned it was my dad's welcome home and boyfriend's birthday.  Our server did manage a smile when he brought dessert over and was kind enough to return with a candle when I mentioned again it was my boyfriend's birthday.A strange thing was that they wrapped all of the leftovers in aluminum foil, including the creamed spinach. They quite literally scooped it into a sheet of foil, crumpled it up, put it in a paper box, and sealed with an embossed Del Frisco's sticker.  Definitely expected nicer doggy bags from an establishment like theirs, but at least it was odd enough to be funny.I may return another time to try the ""city's best crabcakes"" as overheard by the server I wish I had, but then again, nothing is begging me to return to this place.  Keen's Steakhouse in Herald Square still has my heart; much more relaxed ambiance, without any sacrifice in food or service.",2,1,2,Tiffany W.,"Da’an District, Taiwan",324,18,28

It was a lot of food for me but that's probably also because we ordered a few sides.The tuna tartare was great - the fish tasted fresh and there was this refreshing lime flavor to it. The wonton crisps were a nice accompaniment. For a side, we ordered the lobster mac and cheese. It was just alright. There wasn't a lot of lobster in it and the the mac and cheese overall was just alright. Not worth the $20, IMO. We passed on their extensive wine list and opted for some martinis instead. It's as pricey as you'd expect it ($16+) but they were very expertly made and tasted exactly the way their drinks list described it.For dessert, the three of us shared a slice of their lemon cake and it was more than enough. It was probably at least two times the size of a regularly-sized slice of cake. The lemon icing was too sweet for me but the cake itself was amazing. And that's saying a lot because I'm not normally a dessert person.I'd definitely come back to try some of their other cuts - but I'll probably wait for a special occasion.",3,1,1,Mel T.,"New York, NY",444,1319,3268

For appetizer we got crab cake (it was seasoned well, but a bit smaller than I expected), for entree I got the 8 oz filet mignon (perfectly medium rare, although I can think it can use a bit more salt and pepper seasoning), and for dessert I got the butterscotch cheesecake (very generous portion, cheesecake was moist and creaming, not overly sweet). My coworker ordered the banana bread pudding, I had a taste, and I think it's superior than the cheesecake! Overall I was happy with the meal and the service. Probably won't go out of my way to come here for a meal but was not disappoint at it either. P.s.

Burrata was good, but a few too many tomatoes for my preference.

It is 32 oz. In the future I recommend splitting it and ordering some extra food as pickings. It is only the steak they dry age there and boy is it good. Sides: We had the mashed potatoes (heavenly) and the Crab Gnocchi. I have no idea what they put in the Gnocchi sauce (some kind of garlic cream) but it is addicting.Desserts: Lemon cake was outrageous, huge moist and full of lemon flavor. The Butter cake was so good and sweet. Again : Portions are large!

Although this was not a restaurant I wanted to visit, I was excited to eat here because they have numerous good reviews. For my entree I ordered the braised short ribs that came with a side of the chateau mashed potatoes. The ribs came out COLD, I was so shocked because this restaurant looked so put together and they serve me cold food. That definitely turned me off but the server was really nice and took care of it right away when I told him about my dish. When I finally got a chance to taste my food, I was not really feeling it.

4.0,9/26/2016,"Had an early dinner at Del Frisco's.  This is an upscale steakhouse that caters to the dealmakers and businessmen alike who are carnivores.  The wine list is extensive but also very expensive.  Martini's are $20 but you get a huge pour. I ate at the bar.  The services was very good.I started with lump crabmeat appetizer that was ALL crab.  Delicious!  Then onto the porterhouse steak. It was cooked perfectly and the portion was big enough to easily feed two people. The only reason I didn't give Del Frisco's a 5 star rating is that they have now increased the pricing of the side dishes, which are no longer large portions, to over $15 to $17.  Spinach side for $15 - really!  Pricing (excluding a bottle of wine) will easily run over $100 a person.  So, if money is no object, and you want to impress a client or colleague Del Frisco's is your place.",0,0,0,Ralph A.,"San Diego, CA",46,51,1

Both dishes very savory. My husband really enjoyed his steak. Curtis asked to cut the Steak to see if it was done the way my husband liked. My husband thought that was really nice. He was pleased. My Short Rib came with Mashed potatoes and veggies. It was just so delicious! As we waited to order dessert. We noticed one of the staff members with a piece of cheesecake walking towards a table.

Below is a detailed description of our experience (if you wish to know more). We first sat down and was immediately served bread and water (and the bread was soft and light). I'm sad to have forgotten the name of our server, but he was very knowledgable of the entire menu. He told us the popular items and also his personal favorites. We started with crab cakes, burrata salad, and a BLT wedge salad, which were all delicious. Afterwards they cleaned our table and reset it and served is our entrees. We had sea bass with a bed of crab rice, bone in 16oz steak fillet with a side of melted butter with shaved truffle sauce, and a 12oz filet mignon. We were impressed that they came with our steaks and asked us to cut into them while they were still there to make sure they were cooked to our liking, and of course they were perfect.

5.0,8/29/2016,"Let me start with Happy Birthday to me so hubby took me to Del Frisco's to celebrate the Bone Tomahawk! Of course when you go to a steakhouse like this you will be assigned to a different staff in each department. The greeting department does pretty good hiring pretty girls with nice black dresses to greet all the steak eaters. Btw are those little black dresses by Coco Chanel? Neat! The H20 department has some great staff. Justin got you covered. Flat or sparkling or tab? Your choice! The wait department sent us an intelligent woman named Morgan. She's sharp like a steak knife (in a good way). Almost like she could read your mind. She's happy and friendly. Curtis the manager enjoys serving  and speaking with customers. The runner (didn't get the name) makes sure customers don't try to play with fire. The plate is super hot so be careful! I got the impression that everyone enjoys what they do here. Great team effort. Del Frisco's, I don't always give compliments...but when I do, I prefer in writing. Here comes the food talk. We ordered the famous Tomahawk, brussel sprouts, mushroom, Del salad and escargot. We enjoyed the starters Del Salad better than escargot. Not a big fan of escargot in creamy sauce. I like the French style escargot. We tried the brussel sprouts but thought it was salty. So please take note if you don't like too salty you can ask to reduce the salt for this one. Hubby likes salt and if he thought it was salty then for me would be double salty. When we mentioned to the manager, he recommended some great mashed potatoes. That was delicious. The mushrooms plate was well done. I always enjoy medium dried shiitake mushrooms and they did it well the way I expected it. The Tomahawk? Forget about it! Unfortunately I can't forget. I tried a piece  but I could tell you something you probably already know that it's juicy and tasty. I'm not a big fan of red meat but I sampled it so I could talk about it. There's a leftover of everything. Lemon cake is worth a try although the cut is huge, try to eat it for 7 days. Glad we didn't over eat everything. I'm happy to suggest this steakhouse if your trip brings you to NYC. We're here so definitely will be back. Thanks for your great service and the food.

5.0,8/28/2016,"This is one of the best experiences I have had in a restaurant. Went there my last day visiting NYC, kind of as a send off. Made reservations a couple weeks in advance because someone recommended this place for steaks. With the reservation waited maybe ten minutes before we were seated. The place is incredibly busy on a Saturday night. We went for a nice romantic evening and we got just that. The first impression is this place is very loud and not very personal, but then they walked us past all the madness. They put us in the wine cellar area which is very quiet and cozy. They take you down an escalator to get to this area.The service was really good. The girl that served us was very professional and accommodating. We were tended to in an appropriate manner; not overly attended but also not neglected. At one point in the evening they brought out an extra table for another party. The guy seemed like a real loud mouth and was very rude. She was very accommodating to him given the circumstances. I can't forget to mention that couple was already mid meal when they were moved to our location so I can only assume that he did not like where he was sitting and they moved him to a location of his liking.The food was excellent. I loved everything that we ordered. Started with the waygu beef starter and as my lady says ""that was bomb."" I got the on the bone filet mignon and my girlfriend got the regular filet mignon. They come out and make sure the meat is cooked to your liking which was a nice touch. Added a side of truffle butter ($8 but worth every penny). The sides were the asparagus and the potatoes au gratin (cheesy potatoes). It was all excellent. We finished the night off with the salted caramel dessert.

2.0,8/20/2016,"I can understand the appeal of this establishment -- the location, the grandeur, and the fancy-looking menu. But perhaps I expected too much based on the Yelp reviews. I'm not even trying to sound snobby, but aside from the service and the crab cake, everything else was mediocre and, unpleasant if taken the price into account. Running a restaurant in prime location is understandably expensive (but it's a chain?!), but to me personally it was not worth the compromise. It may be, for certain occasions, but I think I'll stick to good old Peter Luger's for special steak outings. Or smaller and quieter establishments -- not in the heart of midtown despite the Yelp rating, I learned my lesson -- for fancier nights out. The positives. The service was mostly friendly and attentive... though I have to admit, maybe a little too aggressive at times, like when the staff pressured us to order more appetizer than we wanted to. The crab cake was quite impressive -- there was actually a lot of real crab meat, unlike most other places. Had the price made more sense, I would have bumped it up to three stars just for this.The steak. We had the porterhouse and the rib eye, fyi. The staff warned us that they heavily season and butter their steaks -- and asked if we'd not want it seasoned. I figured I'd let them do things as they think best. But they really meant it when they said ""heavily season."" The steak was way, way too salty. It drowned out the flavor of the meat. Otherwise it was okay. A little dry and lukewarm and totally not up to the hype.The side dishes. The broccoli rabe and king crab gnocchi were way overpriced for the mediocre taste and portions. Also, the complementary bread was indistinguishable from a roll sold at a supermarket. The overall vibe was confusing, too. It seemed to try to make itself look like an upscale restaurant (the prices and grandeur of the interior) but everything else was too poorly presented. The music was too gaudy/loud, the details too lacking, the staff too aggressive, the food too... okay. It would make more sense if a local casual bar or diner was like this and charged a fraction of the price. I really wanted to give it three stars, but I'd rather give an honest opinion. It probably won't hurt since most people apparently think of it very highly.",4,1,1,Ga Young L.,"Cambridge, MA",18,37,153
4.0,8/17/2016,"3.5 stars. Why can't I give half stars? It was nice. The crab cakes were solid. Bacon, too hammy but thickly sliced and the escargot was bland. The steaks were up to snuff. To be honest, after alternating bites of prime rib (most popular wet-aged steak) and tomahawk (only dry aged) I can make out a subtle difference. One has more depth while the other one is flat.... But the fat made up for it. Kinda, sorta worth the $30 difference. Maybe not since I had trouble distinguishing, I could've made it up. Sides were delish... Isn't that the weird thing about steakhouses? They spare no expenses with their sides! I guess they were only mushrooms and onion rings that someone ought to make them well for $20 a pop.The waitress was so appeasing, it was not disingenuous. Ok... A tad. My old-fashioned was strong and generous. No one liked the complimentary lemon layered cake that I thought was the best thing I had all night. So I took it home and ate it the next 3 nights. I had high expectations going in to a touted, pricey steakhouse. I had been eating well lately at innovative, flavor profile conscious joints. This was not that. Old school, decor felt like we were eating in an airport, not at all intimate and noisy. At least it was dark- but not the candlelit kind. I've eaten in enough steakhouses outside of NYC to know this fits somewhere in the middle, all things considered. The steak itself edges most out by competition but still doesn't ""wow"" me.

Crab claws, king crab legs and shrimp. All very good. And then there are the impeccably prepared steaks. With just a slight char and the inside cooked to perfection. Sides were fine too - mushrooms/onions and lobster mac and cheese were pretty good but potato au gratin was just ok.  Was too full for dessert but we enjoyed several good wines there. The server was very personable, which made us feel right at home. And the sommelier provided some useful tips in a jovial manner.

We ordered 1 pomegranate martini, 1 crab cake, and thick cut bacon from the starter menu. The best damn crab cake you will ever have and for $25 it had better been. Entree, prime short rib, bone out rib eye, king crab gnocchi, and lobster Mac. Everything was beyond amazing except the lobster Mac. The Mac had the perfect consistency and texture, it was just very skim on the main attraction (lobster) for the price I expected lobster Mac n cheese not Mac n cheese with a few sprinkles of lobster. The manager came over and immediately changed out the dish. So instead we had the shaved Brussels sprouts. Too full for desert and with food left over to go, I would say you get a good portion of food. VERY PRICEY RESTAURANT $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ with just the one drink, two appetizers, two entrees and two sides the bill came out to $204.69. Once you add a 20% tip you've spent 250.00 on a meal for two.

The staff at Del Frisco's made you feel like you had a whole team of people looking after you. It was amazing!  Our waitress was great and gave up numerous recommendations. After placing our order she checked on us several times to insure that we were ok and to see if we needed anything. When our steaks came out (15-20 minutes later), the servers requested that we cut our steaks in half to insure that the steaks were cooked properly and to our satisfaction.

3.0,7/31/2016,Very nice restaurant in a perfect location. This place is really big and the atmosphere is great. Service is outstanding with a very friendly and knowledgeable staff. I was a little disappointed though. For appetizers we had the bacon and it was caramelized with tiny slices of jalapeño pepper. It was ok but the added spices took away that raw taste of the tick bacon --- didn't like it. The steak is prime meat no doubt. I ate their number 1 cut; the File mignon on the bone. A gorgeous piece of meat indeed but for my personal taste it needed more seasoning and that savory taste --- no juices at all.

By 4pm there were a few more tables and by time I left the bar looked packed. Anyway, I ordered a ""prime"" strip steak which was the worst steak I have ever had! It had an entire outline of fat around my steak and hardly any steak! I was very disappointed by this and the overall preparation of the meat itself since it was not very flavorful. My sides were okay, I wish I tried something different that the spinach but I enjoyed the cauliflower and Brie.  The crab cake to start was one of the best I've ever had since it came in a lobster sauce!

4.0,7/9/2016,We went here for lunch after a nice stroll at Central Park. I have heard of this restaurant from friends and wanted to try it. Its a big restaurant meant for the corporate crowd around Rockefeller Plaza and also tourists. It wasn't so busy that day so service was great. Our waitress was very attentive and guided us through the menu. We ordered their specialties for appetizer. Crab cakes and Heirloom tomatoes with burrata cheese and balsamic vinaigrette. Both were superb. Crab cakes almost all meat and hardly any breading w/c is good. The salad was my favorite. That burrata cheese and tomatoes  was just amazing. For the Entree since its a steakhouse my husband ordered Filet Mignon on-the-bone with cauliflower gratin and I ordered grilled jumbo prawns with crab fried rice and sautéed spinach. The steak was very tender and well cooked but unfortunately the prawns were over cooked a little bit. It was a little bit tough and the cauliflower gratin is a little bit too rich for me. It was really smothered with cream. The crab fried rice was also disappointing. I didn't really taste any crab in it.

4.0,6/29/2016,"Big fancy steakhouse in the heart of midtown! I was debating between this and a few other steakhouses as a place to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. I ended up choosing this based on a friend's positive recommendation.The restaurant definitely has an upscale field to it. From the high ceilings to the numerous diners in business suits, it makes a statement. My boyfriend and I, both 24, were probably the youngest diners by quite a few years.We got a VIP cocktail to share ($18) and the waitress let us split it between two glasses. Then she came back with two pretty much full-sized cocktails and said, ""the bartender accidentally poured too much!"" with a wink. Lucky for us, the cocktail was really good and super pineapple-y.For our appetizer we had the crab cake - sooo good. At $24, it was definitely pricey for the portion but it lives up to its reputation as the best crab cake in New York. Big chunks of meat, super flavorful, super tender.Then, I had the filet medallions and my boyfriend had the bone in rib eye. I really enjoyed mine. It came with 3 small pieces of super soft and pleasantly chewy filet mignon, as well as mashed potatoes and string beans. The ribeye also had a great flavor, but was a bit over cooked. The waiter had told us ""medium"" has pink in the middle, but ours was pretty cooked through, except for some parts near the bone (those were mouthwatering-ly good though, especially with the fat ugh so amazing). If only the whole thing could've been done like that. The waitress also told us about sauces that the meat came with, and each unfortunately comes with an extra charge. We didn't end up getting any, and were also wondering why they didn't list them on their menu, which would have been way more efficient than listening to (and forgetting) all the options. Brussels sprouts were not great. Tasted rather burnt and dried out.At the end, we decided to skip on dessert. However, the waitress came out with a huge slice of their lemon cake and told us it was on the house! She even came back with a candle after I told her it happened to be my boyfriend's birthday. Overall it was a great experience dining at Del Frisco's. I wouldn't give it a perfect rating though, mainly due to the fact that the steaks weren't that mind blowing, though they came with a hefty (i mean HEFTY) price tag.

4.0,6/29/2016,"First things first, the food here is AMAZING. The Wagyu Tomahawk Chop is a must have! The meat was so tender and juice, defiantly a good cut of steak. Supposably this steak portion is meant for one person, but I think this 32 ounces cut of steak is big enough to share. Especially if you order sides! I recommend the Lobster Macaroni & Cheese and the Cauliflower & Brie Au Gratin. I don't think I've ever had cauliflower that tasted that good. Also, if you like pineapples, I definitely recommend their signature VIP cocktail. It's made from vodka infused fresh pineapples! However, the services from the wait staff defiantly has room for improvement. (Hence, the missing star) I sat close to the walkway and every time a waiter or waitress walked by me, my chair got bumped. For the amount I paid for dinner, I want to be comfortable and enjoy my experience. Not being constantly bumped every time someone walked behind me and not once did someone say sorry or excuse me. It got to the point, I had to ask for our table to be moved. After that, I felt like my party wasn't given the same attention as those around us. It's a shame because A.)

The room was a good size for a group of 15-20 people. It was also nice and quiet, away from the hustle and bustle of the main dining floor. We ordered a bunch of different starters, side dishes, and dessert to share. Everything we tried was delicious. Most of our dinner conversation revolved around how impressed we were with each dish. My favorite starters/side dishes were the lobster mac and cheese and crab cakes. For the main course, I ordered the bone-in filet. Del Frisco's also has a secret menu, which a lot of my team ordered from. It was so good, I couldn't stop thinking about it for days. Del Frisco's also has a secret menu, which a lot of my team ordered from. I tried a bite of a coworker's secret menu item - it was so juicy and the sauce it came was amazing. I don't remember what it was called, but it came with three smaller pieces of steak, each topped with a different sauce. My favorite desserts were the butter cake and lemon doberge cake. The service was great throughout. Our servers were friendly and attentive, and seemed to give their honest opinions when we asked for recommendations about the food and drinks. I actually loved Del Frisco's so much that I took my boyfriend here for Christmas. Initially, I had thought about taking him to try a steakhouse that neither of us had been to before. However, I had such a great first experience here that I just had to come back. I made reservations through Del Frisco's website, and requested for a table that was upstairs and in a quiet area. We were seated on the second floor, in a quiet section right next to the window - it was the perfect setting for a romantic dinner. I already knew what we were going to get for our appetizer and dessert - lobster mac and cheese and the butter cake. I had been dreaming about those two for months, ever since my team dinner. For the main course, our server suggested trying the wagyu longbone for two. I can't even begin to describe how delicious it was. The meat was juicy and had the perfect amount of flavor. We also had the pineapple martini, which was sweet and fruity, just the way I like it. The mac and cheese did not disappoint; it was every bit as delicious as I remembered. The butter cake seemed sweeter to me than the first time I had it, but I'm still glad we ordered it.Overall, I thought the prices reflected the quality of the food.

You feel like you are outside even though you're inside. The second floor has a balcony feel where you overlook the downstairs area and where you can look out onto the streets of New York. The food is absolutely incredible. We all ordered different things and loved every bite. For appetizers, try the bacon. For a side dish, we shared the crab gnocchi and lobster macaroni. Of the two delicious options, the gnocchi was my favorite. For an entree, every single thing is delicious. I had the fish over crab fried rice, and it was to die for. For dessert, we all loved the butter pecan pound cake with butter pecan ice cream and caramel. It truly was one of the best desserts I've ever had. Our experience here was so memorable mainly because we had such a great waiter. I want to give a shoutout to Robert for being the best waiter we all had ever met. He was so polite and engaging without being over the top, and he went out of his way to make our celebration memorable. He was happy to give suggestions but was very polite and not pushy in the process. He also learned all of our names and was very attentive. At one point, I accidentally dropped my napkin when I got up to use the restroom. I hadn't even noticed I'd dropped it, but he had. He brought a new one just in case I wanted it. Also, he removed the labels off of the wine bottles we had enjoyed throughout our evening and put them in a card so we could take them home as a keepsake to remember the evening. Overall, if your budget will allow it, this is where you want to go. It truly is a dining experience.",3,0,0,Kim O.,"Morongo Valley, CA",66,145,99

5.0,6/5/2016,"Top notch. The crab cake did not disappoint, it was legitimately one of the better crab cakes I have ever had. For the mains my wife had the trio, I had the bone in rib eye and we had the chateau potatoes and broccoli on the side. I had to send my first steak back because the first cut revealed it to be over cooked - I asked for medium rare and it was a pink medium but it literally took two minutes for them to bring me a replacement (sorry to whoever they diverted that from!) . The second steak was closer to rare but was absolute perfection. Great crust, wonderful marbling. I am glad I didn't just settle for the first one. My wife loved the filet trio and I tried a bite of the garlic butter and lobster filets and they were both excellent. Sides were nothing extraordinary but I really enjoyed the chateau potatoes and they were a great compliment to the saltiness on the steak. I really can't stress enough how perfect that ribeye was.

3.0,5/28/2016,"Came here on a Saturday night and sat on their patio. Ordered the VIP cocktail. Vodka infused with pineapple. This drink is dangerous!!  So smooth and all vodka. For an app we got the crab cake one of the best I've had. Mostly all high quality crab no bread crumbs served on top of a red saffron sauce that was amazing. Main course was one of their most popular dishes bone in filet. I was unfortunately let down. Ordered it medium and it was dry a little tough and not well crusted or seasoned. It was also very fatty around the bone.  Not was you want to see or eat if you're a filet mignon girl.  You obviously prefer the leanest of the lean so there's a conflict of interest here.  I would not recommend this cut to someone who is looking for a lean cut.  Also ordered the lobster Mac n' cheese. This was ok. Tasted more like a cream sauce than cheese. Had high hopes for this place. Service was great though. Fast, efficient, friendly, water glass was always full kind of service.

You can't go wrong.I got the bone-in rib eye and it was pretty good, though not as tender as I had hoped. It was actually quite sinuous and a little tough.

5.0,5/16/2016,"I have to say out of all the steak houses I have been to this one takes the cake, and then some! I noticed Del Friscos when I was at Walt Whitman mall. They are building one were the (i)legal seafood used to be. So upon go ogling the place, at this time I never heard of them. I see the ""double eagle"" on 6th Ave with almost 5 stars and on the border of 1700 reviews. To top it off a couple of friends, Dava, & Marianne gave this location great reviews. So here we are Del Friscos double eagle steakhouse. The inside has the ""wow"" factor! There are three floors, the main floor, the second floor which has a nice view, and then there is the lower level. We sat on the main floor. By the way then trance is off of 49th just in case. They also have outside seating, which you might get attacked by the wildlife, me, I'd rather my wildlife on a plate LoL! So after being seated in a nice comfy booth, we were greeted by our friendly and helpful server Sarah. For an appetizer she highly recommend the crab cakes, how can you go wrong right? As far as the meals, we again asked for recommendations, and what her favorites were. She raved over the bone-in filet which starts @ 16oz, and goes up, her next favorite was the lobster tails. They start out huge! 16oz, and they are $6 per pound. And finally a restaurant that serves pure melted butter! What really grinds my gears is all these other restaurants that serve butter mixed with oil?! Since when did that become good?! Ok enough about that LoL. As far as sides, they are served family size. We were told to go with the mushrooms with the pearl onions, and the cauliflower and brie au gratin. As soon as the crab cake came I knew this was THE one. Yes like Neo in the matrix. Crab, glorious sweet, yummy crab. If you do not get this you are crazy! There are only TRACES of breading, it is ALL crab! Soooo good! As we are anticipating our main meals the waitress brings us butter for the lobster in these cute silver dishes being warmed by candle. Then, the moment of truth, the entrées arrive! The steak arrived looking great, and cooked perfectly. As far as the lobster tail, they actually carve it out of the shell for you! The Lobster was awesome! Fresh and tender. Not like most places that over or under cook it. And as for the sides, OMG both to die for! The mushrooms had a nice sweet flavor thanks to the pearl onions. The cauliflower & brie au gratin was great and not too over powering with cheese, it also had a nice hint of truffle oil!So you would think we would be full, but not when it comes to dessert! Our waitress Sarah had not been wrong about ANYTHING when it came to what she liked. So we rolled the dice again as if we were in Vegas again! She recommends a lemon layer cake. I'm like, really?! The portion is almost the size of a normal cake, so definitely share. Again, she nailed this one out of the park!Needless to say I will be back sooner then later, and yes we will be asking for Sarah as well.

5.0,4/22/2016,"Update: what follows is a review of an experience that was less than ideal. However Del Frisco's  management was quick in responding to the incident, and offered us a complimentary dinner at the time of our choosing. The response was quick, courteous, and much appreciated. Thus the changing of the rating of this review from 1 to 5 stars.After enjoying Del Friscos for several special occasions in the past, I will not be returning anytime in the near future. To celebrate our Anniversary, I and my spouse arrived at the time of our reservation, but were asked to wait ten minutes for a table, one that, when we were escorted over, was squarely against a wall in a section that had been so overcrowded by the addition of extra chairs at the adjacent tables, so much so that we had to ask other patrons to move so we could get by.Upon sitting, we contemplated leaving because of the lackluster and cramped location and the table of five men next to us in T-Shirts and jeans who were noticeably drunk. We should have. The next hour we were treated to these patrons mooning one another, yelling, cursing, all while being served round after round by a waitress hopeful for a large tip, even after the manager came over to give them their check and encouraged them to leave. Instead of leaving, several more of their friends arrived, further adding to the cramped melee at a table meant for four, now serving seven.We were also privy to wait staff squabbles as they castigated the bussing staff because, ""I had to serve water and bread to my own tables, this is unacceptable."" Couldn't they have taken up their arguments elsewhere? Meanwhile our waitress was flustered and unfocused as all of her energy and attention was taken up by the obnoxious table.Every other time we've been to Del Frisco's the manager has stopped by to ask how things are were, what the occasion was, how we were enjoying our evening, etc. This time he was conspicuously absent from checking in with any patron in this corner of the restaurant.  Clearly he knew we were not satisfied but did not want to handle the situation professionally. I wouldn't have been as upset if this occurred at a Chili's, or Red Lobster, but when paying several hundred dollars per person, one expects a modicum of polite service and an attempt at creating an atmosphere of civility instead of that of a frat house.To top off this experience, both my spouse and I got home to realize we both were experiencing a pretty terrible case of food poisoning.

4.0,4/16/2016,"Finally came here after much discussion. Very cooperate feeling steakhouse. Grand ceilings, dark wood columns and trims. Truly an open space feeling with two floors of seating space. We made reservations and upon arrival were seating immediately. I really like it when a steakhouse has female waitresses and Del Frisco's hires female waitresses. Our waitress was very informative and patient with our ordering. They have an extensive wine book that required some time to sort through and she walked us through it. She allowed us to have some tastings and we ultimately picked a bottle that she suggested. For food we ordered the following:Apps: 10oz bacon and crab cake The bacon was thick cut and topped with red chili's - amazing. I would definitely order this is you typically order sliced bacon at other steakhouses because the thickness of the bacon is a real game changer. The sauce they marinate it in is also very tasty. The chili's give it a real kick but not too spicy where its intolerable. Entree: Wagyu tomahawk chop and bone in prime rib eye; both cooked medium rare. FANTASTIC. This is the only steakhouse where the steak comes out piping hot - LIKE PIPING FREAKING HOT. Yet still cooked to the perfect temperature. Dessert: Banana bread pudding with vanilla ice cream - very good but also very filling and enough to share for two. Side note: Our wine was decanted and while she was topping my glass off she accidentally spilled it all over and immediately apologized (probably said sorry 5x). She even had our table linen changed and brought us all new silverware and plates. I was a little upset at the fact our wine was spilled because it was so expensive. However, she was nice enough to comp our dessert so that made up for it. Our bill came up to about $405 for two people. This steakhouse is one of the more expensive ones in the NYC.

I had reservations and was seated immediately! My waiter was Amon and he was amazing! Very informative, knew the menu and was entertaining! I had the lamb chops, crab cake and lobster Mac and cheese!The lamb was seasoned perfectly, no sauce needed! The crab cake was excellent and was pure crab, no bread crumbs! I didn't care for the lobster Mac and cheese much! It didn't have much flavor!Overall, I would def come again when I'm here to visit and would recommend it to everyone I know!",1,1,1,April D.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,95,68
3.0,4/8/2016,An impressive looking restaurant that is very lively and bustling with lots of suits.  Great first impressions.  The crab cake appetizer was good and the ribeye was cooked to order but I did not find it very flavorful. The staff was always on the move but the service was spotty. They get great reviews but I wasn't feeling it.  It's not a bad place but there are others that are better.  Perhaps I went on an off day so I may revisit to see what i missed.,0,0,0,Ray L.,"Manhattan, NY",1,47,0

She did an amazing job of selling the menu. Drinks, salads, apps & featured steaks. Liz was engaged with us & had fun talking to our table. I like when there is some personal interaction & not just a transaction. I can go to McDonald's for that.Whitehall Lane wine, caprese & a caesar salad, lobster mac & cheese, asparagus, lamb & a bone in rib eye!  Are you kidding me!  It can't get better.

3.0,4/3/2016,"This was disappointing. The restaurant itself is very nice. We came for my birthday before a Broadway show.it was just me and my husband. The waiter was less than charming or welcoming. Kind of pompous and seemed to care more about the large table of men seated by us. I felt like we were treated like annoying tourists. We come to this city all the time. Sure we might have been over dressed, but it was my birthday I wanted to dress up and go somewhere nice. Not be treated like I was an over eager tourist. I wouldn't go back, even for a casual meal. We ordered the 12 oz filet and lobster and split both with the Brussel sprouts. Honestly, I've had much better of both at the capital grill and other places. It wasn't bad, but it definitely wasn't the best. Overall I just wasn't that impressed. The chocolate mousse was pretty delicious though!",0,0,0,Kelly B.,"Grove City, PA",218,11,2

We had a private room for a big group downstairs that was very enjoyable.The bartender recommended the house special pineapple infused vodka to start. It was delicious, special, and possibly too strong for a work dinner. We also started with the crab cake and spicy jambalaya calamari.The crab cake was delectable. The calamari was a unique dish that had a spicy yet tropical twist.My main was a filet mignon that melted in my mouth. Our group shared sides for Maque Choux Corn, Asapargus, Gnocchi, Potatoes Au Gratin, and Spinach Supreme (creamed Spinach).

It was delicious and devoured within two minutes.  We ordered the Prime Rib Eye medium.  My boyfriend prefers medium well, so the server Dave (I think) suggested these really hot plates and my boyfriend was able to sear his steak to his liking.  The steak was PERFECT!!! We didn't talk to each other for awhile because we were slowly enjoying each bite.  We ordered another crab cake with our entree because it was just that great.  For sides we had sauteed spinach which was great and lobster mac and cheese (I'll get back to that).For dessert we tried the butter cake (I'll get back to that).Ok, so the reason I didn't give five stars.  I have frequented the Del Frisco's in DC.  I have been craving Del Frisco's but haven't been back down, so I decided to chose the one in my backyard.  Well...the Del Frisco's in DC definitely spoiled me with their lobster mac and butter cake and Del Frisco's NY just didn't match up.  In DC, there is a piece of lobster in almost every bite, NY had good flavor, but maybe three pieces (if that) in the entire dish.  Then there was the butter cake.  In DC, it was hot, soft, with the right amount of crunch and so moist in the middle.  NY...not so much.  It was warm and dry.  The waiter asked me how it was since he saw I didn't eat much, I told him, and he immediately took it off the bill.  He was great!",0,0,0,Erica M.,"Jamaica, NY",3,16,0

3.0,3/13/2016,I would give it half if could. My boyfriend wanted to take me to a good steakhouse so we decided to come here after our Broadway show. The place was very elegant with tons of people eating. The ambience was classy and cool. There were two floors with big glass windows overlooking nyc streets and Rockefeller center. That defiantly made the restaurant that much more enjoyable to eat.  They sat us upstairs within 15 mins. Which I think is very reasonable with no reservations. After being seated the waitress automatically took our order giving us some suggestions and specials of the day. We wanted a savory steak so she suggested the rib eye over the porter house.  We didn't want to overfill ourselves so we ordered the Rib Eye to share ( medium rare of course) along with a blue cheese wedge salad and lobster Mac and cheese. We each ordered a glass of red wine one Pinot noir from Oregon and one glass fromSpain. We requested the food to come all together because we prefer to have the salad with our steak. The food came rather quickly but minus the salad.We requested the salad again and as the waiter was coming back the salad fell . It's ok things happen but hurry up and bring the salad! steak is getting cold. That took about 5-7 mins to come. . I must say the lobster MacAnd cheese was the best thing ever but the steak was not.  I was expecting this juicy savory tender steak but when you compare to Peter Lugar there is no chance.The steak was too salty for my taste and a little bit on the dry side.

From check in to leaving was amazing and efficient.  As other people have written, ask for the upstairs.  It's a more intimate setting. My mother in law has trouble with stairs, so the staff took her up by elevator after walking through the kitchen (to an ovation by the kitchen staff).The food was very good.  Steaks were prepared perfectly and the side dishes were great.  I enjoyed the Del's salad.  Their signature lemon cake was enthusiastically attacked by everyone at our table.  Heard that the VIP cocktail was very enjoyable.Atmosphere is dark and classy.  Once by the lobby you no longer feel crowded.  But it is pretty noisy- perhaps the only drawback, but not worth losing a star over.  If you're visiting the City and looking for that special, albeit expensive dining experience, I highly recommend Del Frisco's and WILLIAM!",0,0,0,Robert G.,"Sudbury, MA",0,20,0

The place is huge and you will seldom dine in what must be one the most expensive spaces ever. On the other hand it has a fat dose of restaurant food chain jargon coming at you. Everything is ""our signature /copyright /patented"" this and that. The up selling never stops and they will suggest that you should definitely think about adding king crab or truffle butter or fois or all three what the hell. They are all like 20 per and will send your already expensive steak through the roof.  I think at the prices they are charging it would be better to not feel like a fancy chain restaurant. I have to say the food was all pretty good not great. The steak was not in my opinion worth the price. I had the big bone in rib eye med rare, wasn't wowed. Tuna tartare app was ok. The king crab gnocchi side was definitely my favorite.  They have all the wine, cocktails and booze you could ever want but the old fashioned ""their patented recipe ""was pretty bad and stupidly overpriced.

We were greeted with a ""Happy Anniversary"" and the pleasant smile that we have grown to expect from Del Frisco's.    Our table was probably one of the best in the house with a fantastic view. That was a wonderful little plus to up the experience level. Our service started off with attention to detail that lasted through to the end of the meal. We where provided with a Sommelier to walk us through the immense wine list. He even provided some tastes of wines that seemed to match our tastes. In the end, as good as he was, we still chose cocktails. I chose the Del Manhattan and my wife chose and extra dirty martini and later a Amaretto  Sour. I have to say, the drinks were good but oh so very strong. They hit hard right from the first sips and carried through to the end of the meal. My one drink was enough for me for the rest of the night.    Our server, Dominic, was fantastic and extremely attentive. He was knowledgeable and friendly. He set the mood for the night and ensured we had the time of our lives. We both had the tomato and onion salad which was delicious.    We went into dinner with a pretty good idea about what we wanted for dinner and he recommended items in such a way that we were almost drooling by the time he was done and decided to give his suggestions a try. I ended up with the bone-in ribeye and my wife had the bone-in filet. Both of which were absolutely amazing. They melted in your mouth and had perfect flavor and temperature throughout. Dominic recommended the new Brussel sprouts dish and Chateau Potatoes which were also different from the sides were originally planned on ordering. Both sides were wonderful though the Brussel sprouts were overwhelmed by a heavy dose of citrus.    The experience, from start to finish, aided a lot by our excellent server Dominic was wonderful. Thank you Del Frisco's for giving us one more amazing experience and keeping Del Frisco's on the top of our list of favorite places to eat.",1,0,0,Jonathan W.,"Cheyenne, WY",83,180,57
2.0,2/27/2016,"The restaurant ambience was great! Had a private party of 27 and expected more in regards to service with the extremely high prices for a private room. I was enjoyed my prime strip steak however a number of people in my party had to send their food back a few times. I heard the sea bass was good, the prime ribeye was just okay, the filet mignon and lamb chops was just okay. The crab cake & Del Salad were amazing. The shrimp cocktail platter was okay. The dessert choices were bread pudding & chocolate mousse cake. The cake was not good. I took a lemon cake slice to go & it was good. I give the restaurant 1 star for ambience & 1 star for effort.

Only thing better than the food was (maybe) the service.  Kathleen, our waitress, was as sincerely engaging as any staff member I've ever encountered in a restaurant, without sacrificing service.  And when we talked about skiing she mentioned it to Shawn, the manager, who then came over to our table and talked to us about all sorts of things for at least 15 minutes.  The sides were served with the main courses by additional wait staff who made us feel like we were the only people in the place - a remarkable accomplishment for a restaurant that is, in a word, huge.  Expensive but worth every cent.  Still #1.",0,0,0,Thomas H.,"Bronxville, NY",0,10,0

I would definitely recommend this area for one on one time as well as a nice view of the different types of wines they have. Food as always was on point. Steak medium rare with crab cakes and lobster Mac and cheese. My wife had a trio steak with different type of sauces on it. (Don't recall what it's called but also very good. It's small portion but flavorful if you like that kind of stuff. Just ask the server what it is.) Our server Chris was great. Very welcoming and funny. He was funny and chatted with us enough but not where he was overbearing. The only complaint I did have was that the table they sat us at was shaky. If I was cutting my steak or anything the table would move around. However, for this I wouldn't put down the five star rating.

The crab cake is out of this world, lobster Mac and Cheese couldn't be better, steaks: phenomenal and cooked to perfection and who can resist that strawberry cheesecake?!Waiters: very personable, witty and ensure you are enjoying every bite of your food. They let you enjoy every course and digest. But they are also very mindful of your time and make sure if you are seeing a show or have a time restraint you are out on time. Restaurant: very very clean and well put together. The views of Manhattan are breath taking, it's very modern and romantic. The hostesses at the front desk were very nice despite the madness going on around them. They were also dressed very well and tastefully. They should come up with some sort of beeper to let you know your table is ready rather than have the hostesses run around the restaurant screaming your name out. Just a thought.  Here's where it gets ugly: THE BARTENDERSIt's impossible to get a drink at the bar let alone see one of the women working behind the counter crack a smile. They refuse to make eye contact with you, literally it took us 20 min to get a refill. They were just so so rude and it put a real damper on the beginning of our evening.

4.0,2/3/2016,"The VIP cocktail was delicious but the ingredients were nothing extraordinary.  Pineapple juice and vodka.  The pear cocktail was tasty at the first sip but started to give me the impression of dishwashing soap.  It's just not for everyone's taste.Had the crab cake as an appetizer and it was delicious!  Every bite was crab meat!  The outside was a little crunchy too which added a nice texture.  The only issue is the serving size.  Wished it was more than an ice cream scoop.Ordered a medium cooked porterhouse steak and wow.  It was cooked to perfection.  Tender and juicy.  The only thing I don't like is how much salt they used for the seasoning.  However, if you pair it with wine, you really won't notice it.  I still prefer my steak a little less salty though. The lobster Mac n cheese side was also tasty but there were only a few pieces of lobster meat.  I would've believed it was some other Mac n cheese.  The cream spinach and mushroom side were both on point.Creme brûlée dessert was cold.  Did not expect that.  The top is usually hot if not warm.  Wouldn't order this again.The service was great.  Our server Liz was very enthusiastic about the food and she made sure we had a good time!",2,0,1,Tammy L.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",33,92,49
4.0,2/3/2016,"Beautiful place, floor to ceiling windows overlooking the bustling city, absolutely breathtaking at night. Old architecture, cathedral ceilings. 2 floors,very dim lighting (it was a little hard for me to see the writing on the  wine label when the waitress brought it out). Moderate to loud noise level and it was packed on a Friday night. The hostesses weren't as friendly as I would've liked. But our server (Kelly), the bussers and runners more than made up for it. Kelly also gave some great recommendations. Thanks!VIP cocktail was good. But $18 bucks for a svedka based drink isn't worth it. I can make a batch at home for that price. We had a bottle of rosé and a bottle of chianti both delicious. They had an extensive wine list (more like a bible). Crab cake was good. I liked that it was baked and not fried. Not to mention full of lump crab meat and not filler like most places. $20 for one but it was a good size and tasty. I was disappointed in the lobster bisque. The broth wasn't buttery and lacked lobster flavor not to mention there was only a little claw piece of lobster meat in the bowl. It was a well made soup  just not what I was looking for definitely save your $18. Crispy oysters were devine. Nice crisp outside, well seasoned and the oyster literally melted in your mouth. Would definitely order again. The tarter and cocktail sauces that accompanied was yummy as well. We both ordered the off menu bone in ribeye medium rare. Both steaks came out at the correct requested temperature and were absolutely delicious. Well seasoned, tender with a nice sear. I couldn't finish it and I ate the rest the next day, still great!For sides we got asparagus, lobster Mac and king crab gnocchi. Asparagus was good. The almonds added a nice touch. Lobster Mac was wonderful, ton of lobster, creamy and cheesy. Gnocchi was remarkable , pillowy soft, full of crab and creamy. We brought half of each of them home and they ate very well the next day. For dessert we got the butter cake. One word phenomenal. Nutty, buttery, caramel and toffee flavors. Ice cream that came with it was good but not needed. Cake was sweet but after a steak dinner a perfect ending. Overall my bff and I were very satisfied with the meal.

1.0,2/2/2016,"No no no. This is not a steakhouse, it's a fancy chain restaurant. Yes the decor is beautiful and grand but the food was absolutely terrible. The maitre D, a heavy set guy was also an absolute dick. When we arrived there was broken glass on the floor next the reservation podium. As the place was jam packed and dark it wasn't easy for some patrons to know of this. He then screams at the hostess to ""BLOCK THE AREA!"" which she apparently was already doing. One patron who walked in makes his way to the podium and he literally starts screaming at the guy then proceeds to lecture him on why he just yelled at him; pompous prick. Listen Mr Matire D, you are in the hospitality business, please learn to be hospitable or change your job because you sir are being a cock, a big mean cock. Our reservation was at 8:45pm, we weren't seated until 9:10pm. Not the worst and would have been a small price to pay if the food was good. Sadly our meal was so flat that I wondered if this was even the same restaurant I've been waiting to come to for years. First lets get into the drinks. This is supposed to be a steakhouse and like all fine Manhattan steakhouses I expect an experienced bartender at the bar. While the drinks were huge and very strong they were basically the quality you'd get at a 24 hour diner. My Hendricks martini was literally all liquor in a glass. While my friends old fashioned was nothing more than whiskey, ice cubes with and a cherry. It was disgusting. I know you're busy but for 19 dollars a pop please put some effing effort into it. Drinks were terrible but we brushed it off anticipating the steak. I even remember telling my friend wait till you try this ""Wagyu"" steak. I was almost positive it'd be great. Our waiter came by explained the specials and we order:Shrimp Cocktail - not crunchy, moist nor succulent. Dry and almost clay like in consistency. Served in a most disgusting way with cocktail sauce already slopped all over it. Crab Cake - tasted like packaged freezer lump crab formed into a crab cake. For the cost this tiny crab cake was so depressing and not the freshest.Oysters on half shell - while fresh they were so tiny and small. Note this is a top dollar ""steakhouse"" charging top dollar prices for dinky ass oysters. The size of the oysters were pathetic. Creamed spinach - okay, typical steakhouse side. Sauteed mushrooms - pretty good, no complaints.We ordered the long bone ""Wagyu"" ribeye and the regular bone in ribeye which is off menu. Immediately this prompted the waiter to be a bit apprehensive. Especially when I said, I want to taste the difference between the steaks. When the steaks arrived, right away I knew something was wrong. Both steaks were not crusty and looked almost grayish brown. Signs of the temperature not being hot enough at the broiler. We both cut into our steaks straight through and the meat is stringy not clean as you would on an aged steak. This was NOT an aged steak. An aged steak is when the collagen that holds the protein fibers have been broken down due to: AGING. Hence when you cut the steak its silky and smooth. As you can see in my photos the fibers are clearly intact and stringy when I cut the steak against the grain. I felt conned. Out of the two rib eyes we ordered other than the long ass bone; both tasted EXACTLY the same. This is not an aged steak nor Wagyu for that matter; its a lie. Our waiter comes by and asks us how our meal is going to which I express my concerns. His explanation was that he doesn't eat the steaks here so he doesn't know. Then the manager comes by and asks us what the problem was. I voiced to him that the consistency of the steak was not of an aged steak. To which he tells me their steaks are not dry aged but rather wet aged. Even with a wet aged steak the collagen that encases the beef fibers break down with, so I don't know what he's yammering about. I know this because I wet age steaks myself at home. I then explain to him that I deliberately ordered the 2 ribeyes, one long bone ""wagyu"" and one regular to taste the difference. I told him there was absolutely no difference except the bone. He then tells me this is ""American Wagyu"". To which I ask, well since I'm paying nearly double the price for this steak vs that one, shouldn't there be a difference besides the size of the bone? Why do they taste exactly the same? To which he tries to justify by saying they're the same cut of meat so that they will taste the same. This ""Wagyu"" steak is as Wagyu as a Kobe hot dog or Kobe burger, has Kobe beef in it.They did sent us a complimentary dessert and 2 glasses of port which was nice but felt more of a ""please don't tell"" gesture.Going to Del Frisco's is for the crowd monkeys not the food. Its a tourist trap, filled with schmoozers galore and people trying to expense their corporate credit cards. This isn't a NY steakhouse, its for those who think Red Lobster is a fancy seafood joint.

There was a grand staircase by where we sat which added to the beauty of the place. It was pretty packed which is always a great sign. Our server was an absolute pleasure, so friendly, explained everything on the menu and gladly gave her recommendations. We ordered the pineapple drink which they have on the bar in this cute yet fancy display with slices of pineapples. For our appetizer we had the Shrimp Remoulade. The shrimp were very big, fresh and the sauce was such a palate pleaser!! I had the 16 oz porterhouse and my fiance had the Wagyu long bone steak (the most expensive steak in the house) we ordered them medium rare and they came out cooked to perfection. For our sides, I had the King Crab Gnocci and he the Lobster mac. It was a tough decision to pick a side because they all sounded delicious but we loved our choices. Him being in the food industry it is very hard to impress him when it comes to steak. He was blown away and said it was the most delicious steak he'd ever had. I tried his steak and it was out of this world mine was pretty delicious as well. We ordered the lemon cake which I saw on the reviews as being really good. And it was!!! It was such a large piece. The portions are very generous and we had to bag the rest of our dinners. Between us we had 5 drinks and with dinner it all came to about $400. You got what you paid for here and It was worth every cent. I absolutely recommend this restaurant. Cant wait to come back!!",0,0,0,Miss Foodie M.,"New York, NY",0,199,19
5.0,1/22/2016,"Yes it's a chain.  And yes I'm giving 5 stars for a chain.  But I love this place!   I've come here for years.  Started as business lunches.   While I've had steaks here on occasion my fav meal here is the tuna app and a peice of lemon cake.   The lemon cake is a meal on its own.  And then another the next day.  Huge slice.  But this place knows how to do it.  Reservations are honored on time.  Large parties are well managed.  Menus can be specialized.  Wines picked in advance.  They just operate like the customer is king.  Which is bound to get great results.  So go for the bar, which is hopping pretty much every day or night, go for a lunch with a friend, have a business meal here or get a private table.  You won't be disappointed.  You will however be poorer.  So try to do it on an expense account.   2075 by Yelp count",23,8,17,Maria B.,"Buffalo, NY",4839,3367,3423

Customer service was through the roof ! We were well taken care of. I had the Prime strip and he had the Prime ribeye. The plates come extra hot, and they warn you to be careful, they also ask for you to make a center cut to see if the steak is cooked to your liking. The prime strip was juicy and tasted amazing. But when I tastes my boyfriend's prime ribeye, I went to another planet! It was too excellent for words. We couldn't even talk it was just breathtakingly good! The lobster Mac and cheese was great as well. They also gave a huge slice of cake for his birthday and it was absolutely free. I throughly enjoyed the dinner there. It was well worth it.

Attentive, friendly, and explained every special along with some great suggestions. He was spot on for the recommendation of the crab cake and filet trio that one of my friends had. Can't go wrong with the crab cake which had plenty of crab and light on the breading. I also had the porterhouse which was tender and delicious. They cooked it perfectly. Dry aged and full of flavor. Also had the onion rings which was breaded and fried up perfectly.

Came here for a work trip dinner on a Tuesday night, and although we had reservations, we had to wait an extra 30 minutes (enough time to buy a drink at the bar, which is, of course, their intent ;))Our table ordered the Crab Cakes and Asian inspired Calamari. Hands down, the best crab cake I've ever had in my life. 95% crab with the most amazing aioli of some sort. The calamari was a bit of a curve ball only because I didn't expect it to be Asian style since this is the epitome of an American steakhouse. It was fried to perfection, however too sweet for my taste. I had the Prime Strip, rare plus. Can't say it was the best steak I've ever had but it was good. Sides were the Lobster Mac and Cheese and Creamed Spinach which were also good, but not amazing.But let me tell you what was amazing. Jet, our server, was amazing.

The Rib Eye was the best seasoned steak I have ever tasted.. delicious.. Our sides were broccoli, which was good.. very garlicky, but still good nonetheless. The other side was the only disappointment. The Spinach Supreme tasted a lot like frozen spinach in heavy cream.  However the Banana Bread Pudding for dessert made up for it. Woah! We are not dessert people, but wanted to try it. It was a-mazing! I will say the absolute favorite part of the evening was our server, Liz. What a doll!

Neither did they come by to ask if we wanted another drink, or more water.... `  I actually went to the bar twice to ask about the status of our food.  When it FINALLY arrived the $89 lobster tail was a mealy, odd, texture, and had to be sent back. The steaks were very good, but no better than any other expensive NYC steakhouse. This place is highly over-rated and over-priced.  And the service is poor.

It was raining/hailing outside so we imagined a lot of people would be scooting into the restaurant to get out of it but luckily, we were able to find two seats at the end of the lower level bar. A perfect spot. The atmosphere is wonderful, lively and classy. Once we were seated, we were warmly greeted by the bar staff. Our bartender, Julie, was friendly and personable. Indecisive about what I/we wanted, she made me their Signature VIP cocktail made with Svedka Clementine Vodka infused with fresh Hawaiian pineapple. A simple and sweet concoction! She helped the rest of my party pick a wine based on asking what types of wines they likes and served a tasting of two different ones before making a choice. For dessert, we chose the warm banana bread pudding to split. Milky and sweet, it was a delightful dessert, laced with caramel sauce. After dining here, we made our way checking out the Rockefeller Christmas tree which was a short walk away. All in all, we had a great time here; lots of laughs, great service and food & drink!

Del Frisco's was absolutely amazing and will be the BEST steak you'll ever have. Hands down.  Aside from the steaks, we had the following:Crab Cake - crab cake. Cake. Only one. It was super yummy and ALL crab, unlike other crab cakes that typically have a breadcrumb-like filler. Soooo yummy!! Our waitress said its the best in NYC, I'm sure she's right.Lobster Bisque - meh. Take it or leave it. It was decent, but I've definitely had better. It's made with a Cajun twist and is slightly spicy instead of buttery. For $18, just save your money. Wedge Salad - I hate blue cheese and I loved this salad AND the blue cheese crumbles! Definitely try it! Spinach Supreme - absolutely delicious! it's rich, creamy, and with bits of bacon in it. Chateau Potatoes - very smooth and creamy mashed potatoes with an abundance of peppery goodness and green onions. VIP - Clementine vodka that has soaked up the pineappley goodness of a fresh pineapple for 2 weeks. It was absolutely amazing and I wish I could have another right now! Pretty steep at $18, but it's worth trying at least one. Ribeyes - I opted for boneless and my husband ordered bone in. They came out cooked perfectly and with the most amazing flavor we have ever experienced! They were juicy, tender, and packed with flavor. We didn't have to add a thing! And if it says anything, we ate our leftover for breakfast the next morning without reheating it and it was still enjoyable! No longer amazing, but still delicious! It's a pricey place.

When we got in, the bar and restaurant was very crowded. Our table was next to the bar, and we had people within bent-armed distance from us. I was listening in to the three working professional women have a deep conversation right next to my ear.I was deciding between the ribeye and the $64 bone in prime strip. Went with the prime strip and thought it was perfect. As my waiter put it, the filet is tender, the ribeye is fattier, and the prime strip is what would happen if they had a baby.My wife was a bit disappointed with her sea bass, but that's what you get when you don't eat steak! Our incredibly expensive $15 sides of mashed potatoes and spinach were good ($15 means it's made of gold). I got a $17 Old Fashioned, which started off extra bitter but the bottom of the drink was good. My wife got a red wine (forgot which) and was dry and pretty good.Service was good, even for it being a mad house in there. Oh I forgot about the football sized bread for the table.

2.0,12/13/2015,"Wish I had positives to comment about..... I really do. The double eagle is in a nice area by Rock/Radio City but that was the only highlight to this dining experience.Once a quarter- my guy friends and I leave the ladies for the evening (the girls do a girls night out) and we select a tier 1 steakhouse to feast at on a Friday evening. This was our worst experience by far. We felt like tourists.  7/11 steaks were not cooked correctly and this was a direct result of misinformation from our waitress. She claimed that the kitchen prepared steaks about 1/2 stage off cooler of your typical steakhouses. So a medium -rare became a medium to compensate for any potential undercooked occurrences. Nevertheless- I've never seen a ""medium"" steak with no color and complete grey once the initial cut was made. Please note the the waitress and manager needed to comp two steaks. The potential to ask for more was present but it was an uncomfortable situation. The manager came out with a led flashlight and was embarrassed after new steaks came out overcooked-once again. It was sad. Lastly, its not exactly an inexpensive mid tier steakhouse based on menu pricing. With a $1300 bill you would simply expect.....better.Summary: Poor advice from the waitress . There is no way I would return regardless of a complimentary meal.Enjoy feeling like a tourist if you decide to venture here. Try Porterhouse in Time Warner or Wolfgang's- you won't have to read a similar rant if you choice those.

1.0,12/11/2015,"Worst food ever!!! After long research for a good steak house in the city I found this place and decided to give it a try due to all the good reviews and being a big foodie I love trying new places, especially steak houses since my friend and I love steak!! But this place by far was the worst steak experience we have had!! I ordered the prime rib eye and my friend ordered the prime strip and we split the mashed potatoes.  If you like your steak extremely greasy, tasting like a lump of salt and not tasting like steak and your mashed potatoes tasting only like pepper then sure go for it. But if you really want a good steak then you should PASS on this place!! Even after both of us sent our orders back and having them replaced it was literally even worse the second time around! How do you mess up steak at a steak house? The only things that were good here were the shrimp cocktail appetizer and the bread they give you on the table, other than that it was awful! We left starving since we couldn't even eat our meals even after getting them replaced and wasted over an hour in this place! Also for the overly priced food here you would think that it would have at least been edible but it was not and I have no problem splurging on good food, but for what we paid it was not worth it one bit!",1,0,0,Ashley 9.,"Bryant Pattengill West, MI",0,21,1

We go for the best steak and fresh fish. I usually have a dinner salad, salmon, asparagus, and always had the cheesecake for desert. It's fun to try different deserts. Everyone else has steak. They are not disappointed. We love the potatoes and especially the macaroni and cheese. The bread is so delicious too! I could fill up on that alone. The atmosphere is upscale without being overly gaudy. Service is professional, employees knowledgeable, and service prompt. Everything is clean and neat.  The window views create a spacious and airy feeling. I have friends that work at businesses in the vicinity. I am aware of one that is having their holiday party here for the second year in a row. This is a great place for office celebrations and holiday parties. I've only had one bad experience. I made my reservation using Open Table. When we arrived one Christmas Eve I was told they were not open at the time I reserved. We had other plans and could not wait.  We had to make other arrangements rather quickly. I've learned from that unpleasant experience to call the restaurant directly to make reservations.

We were seated all the way in the back which is a little bit of a harrowing experience because it is super packed and tight in there. The hostess was absolutely wonderful..... My elderly mom needed to use the restroom which is on the second floor..... She escorted us through the kitchen to a special private elevator. Everyone in the kitchen greeted us while we navigated through the tight quarters. Great hospitality.

5.0,12/6/2015,Amazing steakhouse. Make reservations because they are incredibly popular and in a very busy location near Radio City. From the moment we arrived every detail was excellent. Our waitress was great and so was everyone assisting with clearing plates and filling water glasses. The food was delicious. I really don't think you can choose a bad dish. Get the king crab gnocchi for a side and the corn! We were never at any point rushed which was really great considering how busy they were. My only complaint is the noise. It was very hard to have a conversation. Just to note if you going during the week expect a business crowd. On weekends it's more of a mix. We brought our kids and we had no issues. There is no kids menu but ask and you can get fries and burgers. Very pricey but worth at least one visit.,9,4,6,Jennifer D.,"Marlboro Township, NJ",2364,913,3929

We ordered the house special, bone in filet 16 Oz and bone in ribeye 22 Oz. Note: order a slightly higher temp because they are on the rarer side if that bothers you.

5.0,12/2/2015,"We started with a crab cake. It was perfect light breading mixed in with lumps of delicious flavorful crab. For our entree I had the trio of filet mignon medallions topped. Two were topped with truffle butter and the third was topped with perfectly cooked lobster and hollandaise sauce. The third was supposed to be a cheese topping but I don't mix well with cheese so the substitution was made. We ordered onion rings with avocado ranch as our side dish and they were huge, fried to perfection and paired perfectly with the avocado ranch. We had the 7 layer lemon cake for dessert which was phenomenal, the tangy and sweet were balanced perfectly for a sweet ending to an amazing dinner. The coffee that went with dessert was full bodied but not bitter.Service: Our waitress was engaging and interested while not being overbearing. She waited for us to finish our food before swooping in and was more than happy to add to the conversation when we asked her about new shows and places to go afterwards. The manager found out we were celebrating and stopped by, chatted with us about local attractions and left his card should we return.Seating: We sat in a big soft booth which was nestled in the back so to us the restaurant seemed quieter but with the large windows we still had a great view. The only TVs were at the bar.Reservations need to be made weeks in advance as they fill up quite quickly. Also set aside some time, the food is amazing and they will treat you wonderfully as well as give you time to eat at your own pace.

5.0,12/1/2015,"This is definitely a legit steak house that perhaps gets overlooked compared to other places in NYC (Kean's, Minetta Tavern, Peter Luger).

5.0,11/30/2015,"I had the pleasure of attending a birthday dinner for a family friend and my husband one Saturday evening in late November.  We were seated on the 2nd floor to the right of the stairs in the corner by a column that was facing the front door.  The view of Radio City Music Hall and the white lights on their trees outside was the perfect ambiance to set the tone for our dinner experience.  The outside walls were all glass so our view was completely unobstructed.  To begin, I tried the Caesar Salad and sampled my husband's Crab Cake.  The Caesar Salad was good but our friend's Blue Cheese Wedge salad looked so amazing that I'll definitely try it next time.  The Crab Cake was phenomenal and the Cajun Lobster sauce had a pleasantly surprising kick to it that we loved.  I ordered the Prime Ribeye Steak and it arrived to the table perfectly cooked, seasoned, juicy and every bite melted in my mouth.  My husband had the Filet Mignon Trio as did 2 of our friends.  A trio of Trios!  Two of the three trios, he said, were amazing and the 3rd one that was plain was really good but too plain after enjoying the other 2 varieties.  Our server was a doll and she recommended the Robert Foley Cabernet to compliment our steaks.  It was the best Cabernet I ever had.  Our sides came out right after the steaks hit the table and the servers plated them for us as part of the World Class Service they feature at Del Frisco's.  I'm going to describe all of the sides because they were top notch and worthy of being mentioned.  Whatever they sauteed the Mushrooms in made them so flavorful and beefy that I covered my already amazing steak with them because they complimented the meat perfectly.  The broccoli was our token ""healthy veggie side"" and I kid you not, it was really tasty.  It had a Parmesan cheese flavor that complimented the broccoli so well that it was actually enjoyable getting my greens down with this meal.  The Chateau Potatoes had this rich and creamy sauce that we all loved.  The star of their side dishes was their Sweet Potato Casserole.  Just wow!  It could have been dessert with it's Brown Sugar Pecan Crumble on top.  It was so good that I would have licked the serving bowl clean if I were home.  This food was so good that I didn't need to add anything to my steak or sides.  No table salt or pepper was needed at all.  We didn't need sauce or anything else.  The food came out perfect and flavorful with the right amount of salt or sauce for every single bite.Since we were celebrating 2 birthdays they brought out a slice of their famous 7 layer lemon cake.  It was so good.  We ordered the chocolate souffle cake for the chocolate lovers at our table.  It arrived with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  I thought the 7 layer lemon cake was amazing enough that I almost skipped the chocolate souffle.  Thank goodness I tasted it.  This is the most decadent chocolate dessert ever!  It's like this amazing chocolate lava and the ice cream that it is served with it pairs well with the decadent chocolate dessert.  I was floored.  Our first visit to Del Frisco's was an overall great experience.  It is pricey but it was worth every penny and I'd pay it again with a smile as I rub my full and content belly.  My only criticism is that every decent meal we had for days after leaving Del Frisco's tasted like garbage in comparison.",0,1,0,Gina G.,"Piscataway, NJ",2,25,21

Then they were gone, and I mean really gone.  Took 10 mins to find our waiter to ask where were the chives for the $10 baked potato.  The coup de grace came when service staff removed plates.  They managed to stack all of my eating utensils on my plate, then when removing the plate managed to drop all the greasy knives and forks down the front of my sweater, with no apology.  All this for a tab that ran $800 for 6 people.  Never again for me.  Good food deserves an appropriate atmosphere.We've been to NY a lot, and there are MANY better places than this in this price range.  If you want a relaxing dinner, with good conversation and attentive service, go somewhere else.  If you want a good steak with the ambience of the New York Stock Exchange Trading floor on a bad day, then you have found your spot.",3,1,0,William F.,"Atlanta, GA",0,13,0
1.0,11/28/2015,"I've been to Del Frisco's a number of times. I've enjoyed it every time except my most recent visit. But since that's my last experience there and indicative to the current quality of the restaurant, that is was I'm rating it based on. It also overshadows the good experiences and I won't be returning because of it.During my last visit a few things contributed to my awful experience, but my main issue was with the steak itself. Every time I go there I order my steak medium-well. I would say for someone who really enjoys steaks I am very lenient on how it is cooked. I rarely complain. But when my steak came out, it seemed a little undercooked but I didn't say anything because I figured that it was just a little bit undercooked which I didn't really mind since medium-well is already pretty nicely cooked. However, when I got to the center of the steak, it wasn't merely undercooked, but it was pretty much raw. It was cold, and not cooked at all. I couldn't eat it, and neither could my friend who I ended up giving it to who orders his steaks rare.Beyond the awful steak I received, the service was also bad. I expect at a restaurant the caliber of Del Frisco's that my glass of water wouldn't frequently be empty. But this specific dinner, it was. Everyone at my table constantly had empty glasses of water. We actually had to ask the waiter for more water. I'd be OK with that at a cheap chain restaurant, but from my experiences, even at those types of places they are good at keeping the water glasses filled. I was shocked when we pretty much had to beg for tap water refills at Del Frisco's.Though I really used to like this place, I won't be going back unfortunately. I don't really understand how they messed up my steak that badly and there also seemed to be a lapse in the service so between those two factors I'll be looking for a new go-to steak place.",2,0,0,David F.,"New York, NY",1,7,4

Our sides were the lobster Mac and broccoli. The dishes arrived on hot plates both steaks medium rare+. From the first bite I realized this may be the best steak I have ever enjoyed and by the third I was convinced. Trying the tenderloin from my wife's plate proved just as exceptional. Broccoli is broccoli and was as expected but the lobster Mac well that could have been the main course anywhere else, don't miss out. Ok, the steaks were exceptional the wine choice phenomenal and the staff and service unbelievable!!! Not just our waiter but at least three other staff made sure or dinning experience was wonderful. And here is where another piece of the story unfolds. I mentioned Michael from the Essex House made our reservations but we were surprised he also provided us a  celebratory  dessert. We chose the lemon cake and it too makes its place welcome along with the meal, very tart, light and sweet.

This place has 2 floors and a private dining area in the wine cellar.  We were seated upstairs which was quite nice. They have a wide selection of wines. The food was phenomenal! For the table we shared 4 orders of the crab cakes. It was delicious. All crab meat no fillers.  Now for our entrees, majority of us ordered the porterhouse and the ribeye. I have to admit, it was probably the best steak I've ever had. When our steaks arrived they asked us to cut down the middle to make sure our steak was cooked to our liking. Some even helped cut the steak for you. I thought the ribeye was much more flavorful than the porterhouse. It was seasoned perfectly to my liking. We also ordered sides of asparagus, mushrooms, and potatoes to share. The servers were all so nice and pleasant. Exceptional service here!

3.0,10/26/2015,"We went here on Saturday night for my birthday and it was just OK.  I was really looking forward to it because I love a good steakhouse and this place has great reviews.  Unfortunately, the quality of the food just didn't live up to the hype.  We started with a round of cocktails which were both pretty bad.  My wife ordered a dirty martini and I ordered the Del's Manhattan.  The martini was a little too dirty with more olive juice than anything else.  The Del's Manhattan was a complete letdown.  The menu said it came with Luxardo cherries.  That was definitely not the case.  Mine came with a maraschino cherry.  This is akin to substituting a hamburger patty for a filet mignon and hoping nobody notices.  For dinner we both ordered steak.  I got the bone in filet which was awesome.  My wife ordered the trio of filet.  One came with gorgonzola sauce, one with truffle sauce and one with lobster sauce.  The sauces were all amazing but the quality of each of those filets was not great. We found gristle in two of the three filets.  For sides we got brie cauliflower and roasted mushrooms.  Both dishes were just OK.  The cauliflower was a little runny.  It would have been better if it was thickened.Outside of the food, the service was amazing!  Very attentive and professional.  Overall the place was a mixed bag.  If you go avoid the cocktails and the filet trio.  Definitely go with the traditional cuts of meat and enjoy their expansive wine list.",1,0,0,Justin S.,"Jersey City, NJ",20,44,17
1.0,10/24/2015,"Everything tasted like it was trying too hard and the service felt like it wasn't trying at all. Very disappointed! There was literally nothing that was even pleasant from the moment we walked in.

After 40 mins we were finally seated at a table that might as well have been in the middle of the aisle. Our waiter was condescending from the second he walked over. We were optimistic and hoping that the food would make it all worth it... But again.. Disappointed. We ordered 2 appetizers, 2 meals, and two sides. Nothing was even mediocre. We both left our makeshift table feeling bloated, greasy and disrespected. I guess from this experience we have learned to stick with the classics (Ruth's Chris, capital grille, s&w, mortons etc) that have always cared about quality food AND service.

The only other downside was the Del's salad which I thought was weak except for the especially savory bacon that garnished the salad. Our waiter, Scott A. Was friendly , helpful, and professional. Bread served before dinner was soft and delicious . Our cocktails and wine were great. Shared a 22 oz rib eye steak that they sliced in the kitchen.

One repetitive observation from my last two visits is that the waiters in charge of our tables had some serious attitude issues and an air of arrogance. I come quite often with foreign dignitaries that have a language barrier and their waiters are simply rude and impatient. On my last visit, we asked the waiter to take a picture and handed him two phones. his response: ""we have reached the era of evolution where you can send pictures to each other, you know!"". On my previous visit, my guest asked the waiter about the daily specials, and his response was : ""I already mentioned them, next time listen carefully""... and then proceeded by repeating the specials.

I was so stuffed after the escargo appetizer (which did not come in their shells, but instead draped over crusty bread), I could only manage to eat two of my steaks. To be frank, I wish I had ordered a regular steak menu item, because I found the steaks to be overly seasoned. I guess I prefer steaks with as little ""dressing"" as possible.Now, as for the potato au gratin side, it was the best potato au gratin I have ever eaten in my time on planet earth.

I was so envious that I didn't order for myself. I ordered the filet mignon . It was nothing spectacular like the T-bone. I wish it had been more juicy. We ordered the lobster mac and cheese with sweet potatoes for sides. I never had lobster mac and cheese before and let me tell you it was so mouth watering. Just typing about it now makes me want to go and get some more. We also had their specialty pineapple drink where they marinate their own pineapples. You can see the big glass jars by the bar. However I was a bit disappointed with the taste. It wasn't sour or sweet it was like having pineapple water. I expected more for $18 a glass.

2.0,9/4/2015,"I went to Del Frisco's for lunch on Thursday with a business colleague and a visiting associate. The colleague ordered the Crab Cake appetizer and Salad with shrimp, instead of chicken, as a substitution. The associate ordered a bowl of the Wild Mushroom Soup and the Steakhouse salad. I ordered the Ahi Tuna Tartare appetizer and Prime Shaved Steak Sandwich. My shaved steak sandwich was truly just okay, though not very inspiring. I didn't register any complaints. The real problem was with my colleague who was not happy with the quality of the tomatoes in the salad (they were pretty bad). She made the server aware. The server let the chef know. The chef had the server return with a plate of cut tomatoes.  We at the table considered this to be a very unprofessional approach to the problem. The tomatoes were not dressed or seasoned (although they tasted MUCH better than what was in the salad). Since we were not likely to toss the salad and dress it or season it ourselves at the table, the likely remedy would have been to return with a completely new salad. (Side note: the server was very personable and we liked her, but she also should have had the training or an ability to realize that this was not the best way to handle the issue.) Agreed that people go there for the steak, but that doesn't mean the rest of the menu items should be just passable or, in the case of this item, sub-standard. Regardless, this meal overall was a fail.",0,0,0,Venu M.,"Tenafly, NJ",0,2,0

The hostess and female waitresses were dressed like (I don't know how to put it nice) but as if they were going clubbing at a cheap club. Very odd for such an expensive eatery. I ordered a filet mignon which is only steak I eat and our meals arrived and I took one bite and it was NOT filet. Our waiter debated us and basically told me it was my fault, I ordered a sirloin and that's what he brought me. Completely inexcusable, he essentially was calling me a liar. They brought me the filet I ordered and I ate separately from husband and had to eat our sides cold which ruined the meal.

3.0,8/5/2015,"Great location and full of suits. What do you expect? It's in the heart of midtown and right by the subway stations. The crowd here is either business or tourist basically but always packed. It's strange how NY steakhouses like this gets noticed and encouraged by patrons over and over again. Trust me, the quality is not that special and you are simply paying for the ambiance and the hype.There's a small bar area downstairs to the left and more dining area upstairs with even a private room if you need to be exclusive.  I like the fact that their steak is decently sized and at least 1 inch thick. In Asia, the meat is never this thick so most tourists will love and appreciate this type of cut. We did order the prime strip 10 oz and lamb chops with caesar salad, lobster bisque and wedge salad for starters; added grilled asparagus and potatoes au gratin.When the wedge salad came out, I should've have remembered to ask for dressing on the side. Yes it was heavily poured all over the salad. That was my mistake. Medium rare steak looked more like medium well but we decided to go ahead since we were all very tired. Asaparagus was under cooked and choppy like bamboo sticks.I only frequent this location once a year on business dinner because it is definitely not worth the trip.  Although our waitress was semi-friendly and a bit pushy, I understand that it is not easy working at this type of non-stop restaurants.  Am I getting old and not liking the NYC vibe anymore?

For dessert we decided to go with the butter cake with caramel sauce--warm, moist, and gooey goodness! Our waiter was also very friendly and knowledgeable. However, during the middle to the end of our dinner, I don't know what happened and he seemed to get caught up talking to other tables and didn't really return to check up on us or fill up on our drinks, which I think is a basic thing to do for customers. Also the place itself is EXTREMELY LOUD--to the point where you can't hear who you are talking to beside you.

5.0,7/28/2015,"My new favorite steakhouse! I LOVE LOVE LOVED my experience here. Everything from the slightly warmed bread with whipped butter that taste a little sweet, to the lobster mac and cheese has me already wishing I could return. The FOOD:I came here for lunch. Ordered a ribeye (medium), lobster mac and cheese, and brussel sprouts as the sides. Everything (I mean EVERYTHING) about this meal was delicious. The meat was seasoned and cooked perfectly. And what they did to this mac and cheese was SINFUL. I am a tough critic when it comes to mac. And this wasn't prepared how I normally do it, but the cheeses they used and the way they backed this mac was a perfect complement to the steak. My only critique is that there was hardly any lobster in the lobster mac, so the upcharge seems a little silly, so I'd prob try to order the regular mac and cheese, cuz the little lobster bits sprinkled in don't justify the upcharge. This would be my only critique. The brussel sprouts had lardons, garlic, and maybe onions and were sautéed. Delicious!We didn't get a chance to try dessert because time was running a little late. Would definitely need to return to sample some other things on their menu. Service was great. They forgot the brussel sprouts side and it took them a while to bring them out, but the food was so great I don't even know if it really took them a while to bring them out or if I was just being a fat ass!The décor is sophisticated, but as expected for this part of town and for this class of restaurant.

As for steaks, I ordered the bone-in ribeye per recommendations from our waiter, Brian, and my boyfriend had the filet mignon. Neither was the best steak I ever had. In fact, the filet mignon left a strange metallic taste in my mouth and the ribeye was drowning in oil. Anyway, what I found interesting is that when they bring out the steaks, they actually have you cut into it to see if it's cooked to your liking. Service was excellent. Brian was informative, professional, and polite. Also, when I ordered their off-menu Lemon Doberge Cake, I was pleasantly surprised to see it came with a candle and an edible happy birthday sign!

It's usually very busy in there for dinner time, I would definitely make reservations.",2,1,2,Dava P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",109,136,79
5.0,7/4/2015,"I work down the street so I've been hearing rave reviews for years. A friend was visiting from out of town and it was too last-minute to get a reservation from Peter Luger's so I thought this would be less hassle to try. The sesame bread was just the right saltiness, the crab cake was actually all crab instead of mostly breading like other places and our server was very patient with recommending a good cut for my friend. We settled on a filet trio and the porterhouse but given the nature of the porterhouse, the filet wasn't as rare as the strip. I complained it was a little dry and they gave me a supplementary rare filet so both parts could be cooked to the temperature I liked. The second filet they gave me was perfect, worlds apart from the one on my porterhouse. That said, I should just probably order everything rare to begin with, instead of medium-rare for cases such as this. Our waiter was excellent, attentive, knows a lot about meat, refills water promptly and how can you say anything bad about anyone who gives you extra steak? He was really patient! The creamed spinach had bacon in it and was really creamy, probably my second favorite part of the meal. The bacon was good but Luger's is better. We skipped the dessert because I wanted to introduce my friend to Magnolia's bread pudding across the street but I would highly recommend this place and hope to come back soon!",1,0,0,Angela C.,"New York, NY",63,23,0
5.0,7/3/2015,"It was my and my wife's first trip to NYC and we spent our last night at Del Frisco's for dinner.  Beautiful location and an easy walk from the W hotel which is where we stayed.  They told us 9:45 pm would be available over the phone but sat us right away when we got there at 9:30 pm which we appreciated.  My wife and I shared the sea bass which melted in our mouths and the filet which was extremely tender, juicy and paired well with the truffle butter sauce.  Amazing taste and quality!  The best part about our experience at Del Frisco's though was our server.  We had the privilege to have Chris wait on us and he was the best waiter that I have ever had at any restaurant.  I have ate at fancy smancy restaurants and steakhouses like Morton's, Fleming's, and Ruth's Chris, and they are all just filled with awkward dudes that talk like robots about the menu.  Instead Chris was very knowledgeable about the food and wine list, managed our expectations as far as the timing of the food, and made sure that he catered to any of our needs for our last meal in this great city.  He even cut the steak in half for us and served the sides to our individual plates as we were basically sharing everything.  I failed to let the restaurant know ahead of time that it was our 1 year wedding anniversary too, but Chris asked us if we were dining with them for any particular occasion and brought us dessert of our choice when he found out it was our anni.  Thanks brotha, the wife has a huge sweet tooth.  I'm sure he does very well on tips alone but I hope this restaurant takes care you because your work is A+.  I don't usually type reviews to this extent but I work in customer service too and it sucks when high quality work goes unacknowledged.   Thanks again, we will definitely come back here on our next visit to the NYC.",0,0,0,Jamie M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,0

5.0,6/15/2015,"After years of trekking to various notable steak houses in NYC and after finally dining at Peter Loser's last month. I can say without any doubt that this is the BEST steakhouse in NYC! There is almost nothing wrong with this place. First of all it's not impossible to get a reservation. Early dinners are usually always available and if you book a week ahead of time you should be good for any dining times. Probably because this place is massive!Let's start with bread, as bread is something that should be AWESOME at a steakhouse because it really sets the tone for your meal and this place has GREAT bread! It's a fluffy light loaf with sesame fresh out of the oven and oooo so delicious.For apps, you GOTTA get the crab cake! They ain't kidding when they say it's awesome, cause it is. All crab, very little sucky breading = great crab cake. Oh! order extra bread so you can dip it in the crab cake sauce.This is one of the few steakhouse places that offer Wagyu and it's not cheap. But you an usually get one to share between 2 people or you can be like me and just order it for yourself :-) It is really melt in your mouth delicious and sooooo flavorful. The filet mignon is also TOP NOTCH suuuuuper tender!!for dessert try their lemon cake!!I also really love this place because of how nice the staff is and they will do anything to make sure you like your steak. Last time I was there my steak was overcooked and kinda tough. I usually will suck it up but my friend make me say something to the waitress who tried to justify it and said it was because different cuts of meat have different tenderness levels and didn't seem very happy about me bringing it up to her. But she got the manager anyway and he was the best.The manager took one look at my steak and said it did look overcooked and right away asked the kitchen to prepare another one for me. The new steak came out very quickly and he stayed until I took a bite and was completely satisfied, now that's good service.So in conclusion if you want the best steak in NYC come here!",6,4,2,Michael C.,"ELMHURST, NY",265,42,63

They definitely accommodate to you. Our waiter was great, he gave us our stuff and gave us great recommendations for appetizers like their crab cakes and 3 sauced shrimp cocktails and sides with our steak like sweet mashed potatoes, broccoli, and creamed spinach. He always explained to us what each thing was. The crab cakes was not my favorite but the 3 sauced shrimp cocktail was so tasty, different sauces other than your usual shrimp cocktail sauce and how they were yummy.

5.0,6/7/2015,"Del Frisco's despite being a chain restaurant, seems to be the place to go for power lunches and business dinners and a seen to be seen kind of place. Which is kind of odd with all the great restaurants in Manhattan. Don't let the chain status fool you, I've had two of the best meals here.We wondered in here after a late showing of ""Fish in the Dark"" and was starving and this was one of the closest places to the Cort Theatre, so we pressed our luck to see if we could find something.  Even though it was late, there was still a jammed packed wait at the hostess stand. We were very fortunate to grab a high top in the bar area.Our table overlooked the restaurant and had a great view of Avenue of the Americas, the restaurant was packed and everyone was dressed to impress.The space is beautiful high ceilings, rich dark wood, ornated iron stair cases to the marble floors. It really set the stage for an intimate dinner.Our server was quick polite and made great recommendations. I've had the bone in filet here one other occasion, it was delicious, it's not on the menu, but you can request it, which I highly recommend. The menu is quite extensive and sure to offer something for everyone! I really had my eye on the oysters on the half shell, seared tuna and steak tartare but being preggo, this is a big no no, which was a HUGE bummer!  However tonight being so late, I couldn't stomach anything very large. I ordered the crab cake appetizer, which was the perfect size for one person- nice jumbo lump crab meat and a remoulade sauce that had just the perfect amount of heat.  The chateau potatoes was more than enough for 4 people, and pure buttery goodness!  My husband had the burger and really enjoyed it- the fries were delicious! He had some great cocktails. The manager made his rounds and stopped by our table to ask about our night and meal. They really make you feel welcomed here.There was a large private space in the back, which looked like a large bridal party were having a rehearsal dinner, it was right near us and we couldn't hear a peep out of them, even though I could see through the glass partition that they were having a rip roaring time.The people watching was fascinating!  As the night wore on, there were intoxicated ladies in heels and it was not pretty!  You learn a lot of things waiting in line for the rest room!

Next I had the 8oz medium rare Filet Mignon (pretty red in the middle but I loved it) with a lobster sauce that had chunks of lobster in it! As a side we had the lobster mac and cheese which was one of the better ones I have tasted and we ended with the banana bread pudding. We were so full but we ate everything.

My bf didn't want to do anything about it, but I felt tricked into a $70 steak! Now, had the steak been great, it would be one thing, but it was tough and chewy.

I also got it with an order of onion rings. It was a huge order of onion rings as a side which were perfectly crisp and with not too much batter. Unfortunately, I didn't have any room for dessert.

The steakhouse chain is my absolute favorite restaurant for a celebratory meal.  The restaurant was completely full on a Wednesday night.  The seating area looked very crowded as the tables were tightly arranged next to each other to maximize diners. Since it was so late, we skipped appetizers and got salads and steaks.  The NYC menu is a bit more limited that what I'm used to in Boston.  The burrata salad was their special of the night so I went with that.  It was awesome.  The burrata was creamy and the fresh tomato balanced the dish well.My fellow dining mate next to me went with the Del's salad with bacon.For dinner, the popular choice seemed to be Filet Mignon.  I went with the special bone in rib eye topped with crab meat.  It was soooo amazing! I love the marbled ribeye.  At 16 oz, I could not finish it.What a fantastic meal!I used my rewards card to earn points from the meal and I already have a $200.00 dining credit to use towards my next meal.

My daughter was early so she checked in and was told by the hostess that they didn't find reservation in my name- so I got a little annoyed but when we all got there, the hostess said they had my reservation under a different name? Whatever...Anyway, we were seated upstairs, corner table for 4. The place was very loud which was expected. It was packed for a Monday night too. Our server was awesome. He was attentive, polite, professional, helpful, patient, engaging and funny. I wish I remembered his  name, He was really nice.Now to the food- We ordered Shrimp Remoulad and Shrimp cocktail- it was ok.We also had the Porterhouse steak, Bone in prime strip and Fillet Mignon in Medium and honestly, I've had better. The steak wasn't very hot- I thought it would sizzle with the 400 degrees plate and it wasn't all that.. I tasted the Porterhouse- my husband had, and that was pretty good.We had the Caulifower Au Gratin- pretty good, Spinach Supreme- very good and of course the Lobster Mac. n Cheese- we ordered 2 of those. That was really delicious. Then they brought out a huge Lemon cake with a Happy Birthday and a candle- that was sweet and made our experience special.",1,0,0,Anne Marie V.,"New York, NY",0,14,0

We dined here on a Sunday evening with a reservation and were sat immediately. Our waitress was very attentive, enthusiastic and knowledgeable in regards to the menu. She explained everything on the menu quickly and in great detail.FOOD: Amazing. I ordered the 16 oz. bone-in filet mignon and my better half ordered three, 4 oz. petite filets all of which were topped with different flavors (Truffle, Lobster and Gorgonzola). The cuts were incredible, the flavor was incredible, everything about it was incredible. The sides are served family style, so we ordered the chateau potatoes. Best mash potatoes I've ever had the pleasure of eating.PRICE: The dinner for two came out to $210.. I've been to many $150+ steak dinners and I've never left more satisfied. Definitely worth it for the quality of food and service you're receiving.ATMOSPHERE: The atmosphere at the NYC location is amazing. Very upscale, very high windows allow in awesome views and great natural light.FINAL WORDS: I can't wait to return to this location next time I'm in the city but in the meantime, I will be a frequent diner at the Palm Beach location.",0,0,0,Darryn D.,"Jupiter, FL",2,25,10

I was aware it was ""pricey"" but when you are looking for high end food paired with great service and the required outstanding wine list, you shouldn't expect to pay outback prices. I had ask for a ""special"" table and was not disappointed. Our server J.P greeted us almost immediately and was attentive and engaging. He asked about our drink preferences and I immediately asked for the wine list. After asking about our wine tastes, he offered us a couple recommendations. He quickly realized we knew our way around a wine list and asked if 1 of the Sommeliers on staff could come and make a recommendation. I actually met 2 of them and settled on Faith Fulginiti's suggestion of the 2011 Gamble blend which was mostly cab. An outstanding choice. Note that we finished that and then ordered the 2011 Frank Family cab which half of that went home with us!The appetizers of crab cakes as well as cheese and tomato set the tone nicely for the perfectly done 12 oz filet mignon, the assistant general manager came over to offer congratulations on our 38th anniversary and the regional manager for the Del Frisco's group (Scott Gould) asked me to contact him is we ever visited the Del Frisco's Boston. so my summary is that we received fabulous food in a great setting and were treated as though we were royalty from the first call to make the reservation and right through as we left!.

4.0,4/26/2015,"Where to start when discussing Del Frisco's? Be prepared to spend money. This place is pricey. It is a great place to introduce fine dining to those who have never experienced it or are nervous about the unknown. Del Frisco's has a more casual atmosphere compared to typical fine dining locations. I consider it business casual, but I have seen guests wear slightly less formal wear. The wait staff are very knowledgable and care about their profession. I sadly forget one servers name, but he was great at making my dad feel comfortable (he has anxiety). The server also whistled ""Happy Birthday"" after taping a candle onto my dad's Birthday Cocktail. The VIPs are the infamous drink of this fine establishment. They are 20 dollars a pop, but I still get them (they are quite strong though, and it doesn't take many, I assure you).Anyway, onto the food: it is all pretty spot on. I had the scallops and they had a lovely sear and well as bacon with expertly rendered fat. Even the Veggies taste great. The sweet potatoes should not even be served at dinner, they are so sweet they feel like dessert, they are so good (and I don't like sweet potatoes). The crab Gnocchi was also to die for. Whenever you order a steak, you are asked to cut through the middle to inspect it for the correct doneness. I think it shows integrity and confidence that Del Frisco's has with its chefs.This is a great place, but definitely as a treat.",0,0,0,Ollie O.,"New York, NY",2,50,2

The only steak house I regularly go to is Maestro's.  I arrived early and went to the bar.  The bar was a little busy but it was not quite prime time. I got there at 6:30.  I waited at the bar for over 30 minutes to get a drink.  I stood there and tried to get one of the 4 bartenders attention.  They never looked my way or made eye contact with me.  While this would not be an immediate concern of mine, I watched as businessman after businessman stood to the left or right of me and got served immediately.  After some time the women sitting at the bar in front of me noticed and said to me ""have you not been taken care of yet?""  I said no and they proceeded to try and get one of the bartenders attention.  Still no one came by me. It was not until I finally went and asked for a manager. The manager's assistant came over with me to the bar and  they finally came over.   It took me over 40 minutes to order a martini.  I was told that the drink would be complimentary and she went to speak to someone about it but never came back. I paid 20 dollars for the drink.  I have heard of these establishments ignoring women or not getting the same service but I have never experienced this first hand.  I suspect there was sexism and racism at work here.We then got seated for dinner.

To be fair my dinner companion had a delicious filet and the sides were very good, but the ribeye on the bone was unacceptable. The manager was very accommodating the first time I got a bad cut if meat, but I was ignored the second time when I was chewing the meat and spitting it out in the plate because it was too tough to swallow.

They won't seat you until all your party is present. There is a lot of people there for cocktails so intermittently it is really a crowded area to wait for your friends to arrive, to get to the restaurants (upstairs, small bathrooms). Three of our party shared a 32 ounce steak and it was cooked exactly as they specified. The waiter was very helpful in explaining the options and they were very accommodating in splitting among the three people. The side dishes are pricey but are large and expected to be served family style. We also split 3 appetizers-crab cakes which were really good-lots of crab meat and tasty. The bread served was two loaves but no knife to cut it-would have been nice to have had a bread knife provided. The two of us that had the bacon-wrapped scallops really liked them.  Desserts were quite good. The only thing that would have been nice is a larger restroom that is easier to access.

3.0,4/17/2015,"I'm not speaking for the food as I have never eaten here before but did have an experience while trying to send dessert and a champagne toast over to friends that got engaged and were celebrating at the establishment. I called assuming it wouldn't be a problem since I have done this many times prior (at other restaurants) and was shocked to find out I had to fax over a credit card authorization form rather than just give my credit card info over the phone. I even agreed to email. But who in this day and age, faxes? Especially at 10pm. Once I saw they were not able to make exceptions, I hung up very disappointed. After thinking more about it..I decided to call back to try to get this policy explained further. I was happy to get Daniella who was extremely gracious and warm. She was very understanding and was making it her mission to help me. She spoke with the manager who decided to make an exception and let me email rather than fax, the credit card info. My point is, unless you're requiring every person to show a photo ID while settling the check, this policy makes NO SENSE. Someone could have a stolen credit card they are using right in the restaurant and it would go unnoticed. Yet, the person who is trying to send a congratulations dessert and toast has to jump through a bunch of hoops. From what I hear, this isn't the first complaint they've had regarding this issue. I was lucky enough to have the rule bent but for me, but I'm sorry to those who have missed out on such occasions because of this pointless policy. I hope in the age of aps, texting and emailing, they update their rule book and make it easier for paying customers instead of turning them away. I'm sure the food is great but having this experience just trying to buy a dessert and drink, I would be hesitant to dine there. **With that being said, I give Daniella 10 stars!!!

While they had nothing to offer for kids they were happy to adjust their lobster mac and cheese to a plain mac and cheese.The crab cakes were very tasty as an appetizer.For Entrees(Main courses) we had the special bone-in ribeye, a fillet bone-in steak, and a 16oz Australian lobster tail.All were very tasty, and the ribeye was one of the better Ive had. Although I would typically have steak medium-rare, but the server said that was on the more rare side so I had it medium, which was then too cooked for my liking, more a med-well.Sides were fine, everything was on the pricey side once you add a bottle of wine, around $600 for 4 adults not drinking much, and a child, but hey its NYC.Overall, pretty good but no where near my favorite Vic and Anthonys in Las Vegas.",0,0,0,Andrew B.,"Valley Glen, CA",7,54,72

4.0,3/25/2015,Del friscos is a great restaurant. The service is amazing -someone always around. The appitizers and sides are great usually go with king crab gnocchi or lobster Mac and cheese. I have been here numerous times and I feel more recently they have been seasoning the steaks too much. Usually get the bone in rib eye or the double eagle -if I'm feeling really hungry I'll have the long bone. Desserts -the lemon cake is the best I have ever had. I always like the food at friscos but I feel the steaks have been off lately.  I'll be back soon for a client lunch,0,0,0,John S.,"New York, NY",18,39,19
5.0,3/23/2015,"My husband and I ate there Sunday evening (March 22, 2015) and it was as great as what the reviews are.  The crab cake is a must to have - it is so delicious and it's not like any other crab cake I've ever had!  We also got the broccoli and au gratin potatoes and our waiter (Daniel) gave us a side of the corn for free for some reason.  Daniel, our waiter was amazing.  He was prompt to serve us, friendly, funny and took time to talk to us even though he was busy.  The food is amazing and it is the best steaks we have ever had.  The broccoli and au gratin potatoes were amazing as well.  We also had the bone in ribeye and a medallion trio with different toppings.  The meat was excellent and prepared just the way we ordered it.  We also had another server that took our drink order at our table; her name was Ashley.  She was also an amazing server/waitress.  She was very friendly, informational, and took time to talk to us as well.  Both servers were excellent and we couldn't have asked for better service than what they provided us.  They went above and beyond what you usually get for service at an upscale restaurant.  I can definitely tell you for the service and the food it's definitely worth the money to eat hear.  We will definitely be back when we come back to NYC!!!  Thank you again for making our dining experience the best every Daniel and Ashley!",0,0,0,Caryn A.,"Kapolei, HI",11,5,7
4.0,3/23/2015,"My husband and I went to NY for the weekend and wanted a special night out on the town!  After checking out all the options we were both really looking forward to Del Frisco's and when I called on Tuesday the woman was extremely friendly and able to offer us a 9:15 reservation for Saturday night.When we arrived, they were packed so we were told it would be a little longer of a wait so we headed over to the bar to grab a drink and were THRILLED when two seats opened up (as we normally prefer sitting at the bar).  The VIP martinis were delicious-- they don't taste overly strong but definitely pack a punch! We split the crab cake to start which as all reviews said was to die for. Yes you only get one but it's rich and filling!  We both had the bone in filet (not listed on the menu) which were delicious. Easily the best steak I've ever had and cooked to perfection. For sides we decided to splurge and ordered the lobster mac and cheese and the king crab gnocchi. The lobster mac and cheese was amazing! The gnoochi was good but if you're picking one pasta dish, definitely go with the mac and cheese!The food was perfect and the staff were very friendly HOWEVER, I have to deduct a star as the service was extremely slow (especially for sitting at the bar).  The food came out quick however we sat for a good half hour (with empty drink glasses) before having to flag down the bartender to put in our food order (who then sent over another bartender). People behind me were being served while I sat with an empty drink. Granted it was a busy Saturday night but I felt there was definitely adequate staffing and we were just left unacknowledged for long chunks of time.   Like I said the food was DELICIOUS and if you go on a weekend night I'd stress waiting for your table and not eating at the bar. I'm giving 4 stars because the food was oh so good and this location has a great ambiance however due to the service I wouldn't rush back which is disappointing.",0,0,0,Rachel K.,"Boston, MA",2,43,1
3.0,3/22/2015,"(3.5 Is more accurate)I came here with two friends and we were seated promptly and our server was amazing. I'm giving this restaurant a 3.5 because some of ours dishes were amazing and others were just a let down. We started with the crab cake, marinated shrimp and lobster bisque. The soup and crab cake were phenomenal but the marinated shrimp was....no words can describe the disappointment. For our main dishes, my two friends ordered the flavorful bone-in ribeye and they loved it. I ordered the trio steak option (three pieces of steak with different sauces). While the steak doused with truffle butter was phenomenal (I ate all of it and crave more till this day) the other two options (one was some lobster cheese concoction and the other was horrible I don't even remember) were salty and poorly done. I know this might seem very harsh but If I'm paying around 70-80 dollars for a dish I expect to want to finish the dish. Our desserts were all pitiful. It was really sad because the server really hyped it up but it all seemed very overpriced for what they were....(My chocolate soufflé cake was more like a lava cake from dominoes) I do say all of this having had fantastic steak in Sydney and a few places in Asia (Mainly Japan mmm) so I might just have really high expectations. But I do think that if you want more bang for your buck (meaning you want to really enjoy the food), you will have to skip dessert and stick with a few solid options.",3,0,0,Jerry L.,"Sydney, Australia",18,142,89

He also gave us a free cheatu potato and cauliflower and brie au-gratin because of the steak and because we hadn't ordered enough potatoes for the table. Awesome, just awesome service. The sides were tasty and fresh out of the oven. My friends also got the filet mignon trio and really enjoyed the truffle butter one. One friend got the bone-in filet mignon medium rare but it didn't turn out so well because it was cooked medium in some spots. I think this was more due to the steak/bone and less to how they were cooking. Lastly, we saw Mary j blige and our waiter was Nathan Green from House of Cards.

4.0,3/19/2015,"4.5 stars...Del Frisco's has been the one restaurant on my culinary wish-list the longest. This past Christmas my girlfriend treated us to a meal here so luckily I was off the hook for the bill. As expected the restaurant is absolutely gorgeous and quite spacious. The amazingly large windows overlooking the entire block of 6th ave between 48-49th were impressive though I wish there was something more picturesque to look at than street level in midtown. The one thing that surprised me was just how many people (most likely tourists) were in here in their scrubby t-shirts and midwest daddy jeans. I'm aware you're on vacation but if you're going to NYC's highest rated steakhouse and are going to drop some serious money on a meal and be served by gentlemen in tuxedos, perhaps leave the dirty sneakers at the hotel.The service we got was top notch and the food was very good as well. For the table we were brought a warm large sesame seed roll and soft butter. No bread knife though so this was a bit of a mess. For a appetizer we split the crab cake. It wasn't your traditional fried crab cake though, more like a tight pile of fresh crab meat with a bit of filler to keep it together and an aioli sauce of sort sort. As it turns out Del Frisco's is even more of a destination for wine snobs than it is for steak lovers. The wine list was 42 pages deep. Want a $5,595 bottle of wine? They have that. Not prestigious enough? Impress your friends by getting them each a $2,790 shot (2 oz) of Remy Martin Louis XIII ""Rare Cask"" Cognac. We did manage to get a semi-reasonable bottle of wine for around $40. Moving on to the rest of the meal. We both ordered the filet mignon and split a side of brocolli and lobster mac and cheese. What I found strange is the way they describe the level of done-ness is a bit different here. They described a medium steak as having a dark red center and pink edges (what I would normally associate with a medium rare). I ordered by description a medium well steak (something I've never done), and in reality it was a bit of a middle ground between what a medium and medium well would normally be. It was delicious and almost perfect but I should have probably just gone with my gut and stuck to medium. Maybe it was the atmosphere, the prestigue of the Del Frisco's name, or the prices, but I was expecting a steak like nothing I've had before. That was not the case, turns out they're not using magic cows here. It was a delicious steak but I wouldn't say it was any better than what I've had at a place like DeStefano's in Brooklyn. The brocolli was steamed and cooked perfectly with a garlic sauce. The mac and cheese was perfectly cheesy and the lobster was great but I could have used a bit more of it in there. The surprising stars of the evening were actually a complimentary small glass of their VIP drink and the banana bread pudding. The VIP (Vodka In Pineapple) is created by pouring Stoli clementine vodka in huge glass jars filled with pineapple, letting it marinate for a couple weeks, and then using that liquid as well as pressing all the liquid out of the pineapples. There is no other ingredients, it doesn't taste strong or too sugary, it was perfect. The banana bread pudding with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce was also perfect. It wasn't too sweet or not sweet enough, the portion was great to share after a big meal. Another pleasant experience is when the manager of the restaurant came over to us between courses to ask how everything was and get to know us for a minute and find out what brought us there. It was a great touch of personal service that I haven't actually experienced before. Lastly before leaving they had a giant jar of jelly beans, an unusual but plesant little touch that did not go unnoticed. I would definitely love to come back here for a special occassion and would recommend Del Frisco's to anyone willing to pick up the tab. Expect a reasonable meal for two to be around $250-300 (ours was $273).",1,0,1,Matt E.,"Brooklyn, NY",785,2205,1856
5.0,3/18/2015,"I came here for date night with my boyfriend last Friday night and let me tell you, there are not enough stars in Yelp to give this place. First, in my OpenTable reservation, I requested a table with a view and we were obliged with a table that had a very cute view of Radio City Music Hall. Our server, Sam, was a delight to speak with, was very attentive and made great recommendations. We started with the crab cake to share. As someone who is not the biggest fan of crab cakes, this was superb. Sam said it was the best in NYC and I absolutely believe him. The cake was comprised of huge chunks of crab and was served with a to die for Cajun sauce. For our entrees, we both had a cowboy cut rib eye steak cooked medium rare. At this point, I become speechless. Hands down, BEST steak I've ever had. The sear on the outside was perfect, the juiciness and flavor of the steak out of this world.... This is where I have to stop because I really don't know how else to describe it. Just GO GET IT. We ended our dinner with the creme brulee and two espressos. It was the perfect punctuation to our dinner. One last thing that absolutely puts Del Frisco's as the most impressive steakhouse that I've ever been to is that today I received a handwritten card from Sam, thanking us for dining there. He even remembered that I was running the NYC half marathon that Sunday and wished me the best. I'm sure all it takes is a couple notes to remember things like that, but the time and detail that goes into making someone feel appreciated days after dining there is something I have never before experienced at a restaurant. They have my business. If you are looking for a lovely steakhouse experience in the city, go to Del Frisco's. You will not be disappointed.",1,0,1,Luana B.,"South San Francisco, CA",172,16,0
4.0,3/17/2015,"(I have to preface this by saying I had dinner here with employees of the restaurant so my experience was not typical and is probably biased)This place is gorgeous and HUGE!  I don't often eat at fancy places because I much prefer hole in the wall type establishments, but I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here the other night.  We were a group of five and had a family style dinner.  Everything was so good and I'm glad I was with people who were familiar with the place to help me navigate.We started with cocktails.  I had the blackberry bourbon cocktail which was delicious yet dangerous.  It seriously goes down like juice, so beware.  Two of my friends split a VIP which probably would have been a better idea as their standard size cocktails are pretty big.For starters we shared the crab cocktail, tomato burrata and the calamari.  I wasn't able to eat the calamari due to my stomach's aversion to all things gluten, but the burrata and the crab cocktail were both DELICIOUS.  Everything was very fresh and the lump crab meat was to die for.For the main meal, we had the bone-in ribeye, veal chop, filet trio, broccoli and cauliflower.  Again, everything was fresh and delicious.  The steaks were cooked to perfection and very well seasoned.  The only thing that was a bit off putting to me was the lobster cheese sauce on one of the filets.  The cheese was bright orange and just seems out of place on the dish.  It still tasted great mind you, but it was definitely a little reminiscent of kraft mac and cheese.  The veggies were cooked well.  Tasty and crunchy as veggies should be.  I'm definitely not a fan of overcooked vegetables.Dessert was the praline sundae, butter cake and creme brulee.  To be honest, I wasn't completely blown away by the desserts.  Everything was fine (obviously I didn't try the butter cake), but I've had better creme brulee (Park Ave Tavern people).Service was good, but it always helps when you have an in.  We had an endless parade of employees coming over to say hi which always makes me feel like  VIP.  All in all, it was a great experience.  Can't say that I'll be here again as it's slightly out of my price range.  OK, REALLY out of my price range, but the food and the ambience are great, so if you can afford it, definitely check it out.",1,0,0,Laura M.,"ASTORIA, NY",284,107,84

The food is the best part.  The last time I was here we came for my sisters birthday (group of 4) and we ordered the raw bar platter for 4 and it was absolutely delicious. The lobster, shrimp, crab cakes, oysters.. they were all very good and cooked well.  For dinner we each ordered something different but i went for my favorite cut... the 24 oz rib eye (medium).  It was tender and juicy with the right amount of fat, it practically just melts in your mouth.  For the sides we all picked one ..the lobster mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, sauteed mushrooms and the onion rings.  All were delicious but my favorite was the mac and cheese (super crispy on top).  All this was downed with a glass of beaurdox red wine (can't remember the name) and the others had their cocktails. For dessert we were just going to order the banana bread pudding and split it but the waiter come out also with a huge slice of lemon cake (their famous for this) and both were delicious.  The slice of cake was extremely soft and the lemon vanilla icing was memorable.  I will be coming back soon.. maybe this weekend :-)",1,0,0,Dan B.,"Manhattan, NY",619,475,311

It was delicious and succulent and more than enough for the two of us, however, I suspect that I would have enjoyed a less fatty steak. If your choice cut is longbone I suspect this will not be a problem. Finally, the creme brûlée dessert was quite good but nothing out of this world.

We also ordered potato au gratin which was really yummy & I would recommendDessert: We ordered coffee which was Lavazza, 6-layered lemon cake, strawberry cheesecake & creme brulee. None of the desserts stood out but it wasn't bad either.Service: This was where another star was lost for me. Personally I would love to rate it 1star due to this event BUT i dont think people should rate restaurants according to their personal peeves & should be rated fairly. This is what had happened. One of the servers brought out hot plates for us and told us that it was hot few time, which is understandable since the plates come out of the oven BUT what was not acceptable was that after he said that, he asked if we spoke & understood english. This took me back a bit because I have never been asked this at a restaurant.  Hmmmm...when someone asks that, it rubs me the wrong way & same with rest of the group. I understand that we look asian BUT we had to make the reservation somehow right? I understand that alot of tourist come through NYC BUT to assume that we didn't speak english because we looked asian just didn't settle well with me. I see other Caucasian people around & they could be European but I dont see the server asking them if they understood English.

5.0,2/22/2015,"Damn good filet mignon to go along with a wonderful sazerac cocktail. Classy boisterous joint to feed your inner carnivore.Definitely a touch of fancy bulked up on testosterone in midtown that attracts a mix of tourists and locals alike. Even an occasional celebrity. Large sprawling restaurant with plenty of seating, thick dark woods, marble floors and stairs, high ceilings, and a huge bar anchoring this spot. Even on the rainy midweek late night that a friend brought me here the joint was jumping and amped up. Many people were still in business suits dining away on plates of meat while closing that deal or meeting up with their mistresses. A lively manly man scene, buy sexy enough to draw in plenty of ladies too.We sat at the bar area and received terrific service. I like to sit at the bar areas in places like this as you can get a real feel for the joint and chat with those around us, along with the bartenders. Be friendly. Get to know the bartenders and managers, and you might get something in return for treating them good. They are real people too and appreciate the gesture.Oh, my filet was cooked just as I ordered. Medium rare with a pink middle. Asparagus side was perfect. Warm bread to start. Molten chocolate cake for dessert. All washed down with an expertly made sazerac cocktail. Delicious. As this was a last minute suggestion to go here the choice could not have been better that night. Can be pretty pricey as you can figure, but worth it to go here and be treated right.

We had to wait another 30+ minutes to get seated.I must say that the service here is top notch. The servers are dashingly charming with their well-rehearsed jokes and one-liners. Gives you the perfect sense of eating cow meat in Manhattan.Speaking of the Manhattan, I had two of these here on the rocks. Their Manhattans weren't anything to call home for, and perhaps I'll try them without the ice next time. We also ordered bread, which never came. Some rolls arrived with an apology and a promise for bread later, but again, no bread. Big bummer.My date and I shared the vegetables of the day, which were broccoli goodness. We each had a filet mignon, medium rare. The steak was good, but I'm unsure it was the best I've ever had. Behind us someone got proposed to. She said yes, thankfully. (This is that kind of place. Some people think it's a real big deal. Maybe it's just that I love pizza more than steak WHO KNOWS?)If you like steak, you'll probably give Del Frisco's a shot.

5.0,2/17/2015,"This has been added to my steakhouse favorites.  I love Peter Luger & Ben & Jacks but Del Frisco's is different.  Those steaks are aged and have a flavor on it's own but Del Frisco's has a wonderful seasoning on it's steaks.  It is expensive but they all are.1. the lobster mac & cheese was tasty but the lobster was not too abundant.  2. the creamed spinach is delicious simply because they added bacon to it.  Everything tastes yummy with bacon.  3. the crab cake (no s at the end).  It is one crab cake but it's a really good crab cake with a yummy sauce.  It's fresh and all crab meat. 4.  potatoes au gratin has a nice amount of cheese giving it a really nice flavor. 5. the cauliflower au gratin - man that was really good. 6. their drinks are strong (how I like them) but you should stick with the signature drinks 7.  the caprese salad - the mozzarella tasted fresh and had lots of flavor.  Tasted like it was made with a different milk then cows.  It was very good and I get this dish everywhere I see it.  8. the creme brulee cake with a scoop of ice cream on top just melts in your mouth.  It's a small yellow cake with a crisp top as with creme brulee.  9. NOW the steak - I always get the bone-in rib-eye.  Phew that's a good steak!!!!  It's not in the class of Peter Luger or Ben & Jacks.  Again, those are aged and the flavor comes from that.  This steak in Del Frisco's is just seasoned perfectly.  It's juicy and cuts like butter.  I have been to many other steakhouses that I would never go back too.  I have 3 top favorites and this is one of them.  Can't wait to go back again!!!!!Lastly, the service is right on point for the money you spend.  Anything you want, they will get it, fix it or correct it and they are attentive and helpful.",0,0,0,Nicole S.,"Brooklyn, NY",90,176,12

He recommended dishes and even though we were if-y on them we tried them and of course he was right! The crab cake was great as well as the tomato Mozzarella salad. We then went on to have the bone in ribeye and the tasting of the fillet with the mashed potatoes and broccoli. All were cooked to perfection.

The ambience of this place is very classy and elegant! We started the night with their complimentary bread and butter (the butter was delicious)! For appetizer my husband and I shared the Cajun baked Crab Cake (popular menu item and recommended by our waiter). Let me just say, that $24 was well spent on this small item! Pure lumps of crab meat accompanied by the delicious creamy Cajun sauce! Wow this was delicious!!! For entree, my husband and I shared the most popular steak on the menu: 32oz WAGYU Longbone! WAGYU literally means ""Japanese Cow"" and it's superb marbling, high quality demands for the high price. My jaw almost dropped when it came out, by seeing its size (pictured do not do justice)! The server was kind enough to cut it in half for us. First bite, OMG! This is soft, juicy and packed with flavor! I loved ever bite of it! Only complain is that, I was expecting the meat to melt like butter in my mouth, and it was almost close enough to that texture! Nevertheless, it was well worth it! My husband and I also shared their lobster mac and cheese. Very creamy and delicious, but could have added more lobster meat to it. We also had a glass of the Reserved Cab Red Wine, which parked perfectly with the steak. Dessert: our waiter surprised us with a Strawberry/ Pecan Cheesecake with a edible Happy Birthday Sign on it on the house! It was so sweet of him! And super delicious!

5.0,1/10/2015,"Late Review -I made a reservation for a Christmas Eve dinner with my boyfriend, who was visiting NYC from Seattle.  In my efforts to get him to move to New York, I try to impress him with as much as I can while he comes to visit, and am very picky/considerate when choosing restaurants.  I am glad I chose Del Frisco's!  I had a knee surgery done the day before and could not walk fast enough for us to make it to the restaurant on time for our reservation at 6:00.  I called to let them know and they were more than happy to hold the table and accommodate me.We had the Lobster Mac&Cheese, Crab cake, Alaskan King Crab Legs, and Dry aged ribeye.  My boyfriend usually does not like any pink in his meat (although he usually half-forcefully orders steaks to be done 'medium' as a compromise) - but the medium steak was cooked so perfectly that he did not have any problems eating pink meat! King crab legs were phenomenal.  The VIP cocktail was the perfect blend between pineapple juice and alcohol. Our server was great at giving us suggestions.

3.0,1/7/2015,"Went here with friends who came to visit and had a show nearby. Never tried it so said- why not. Food is great if you're looking for heavy and hearty- which I'm guessing you are if you're going to a steakhouse! you walk out feeling 10 pounds heavier, but....Mac and cheese is awesome, crab cake too, and the mashed potatoes = yum. They offer a pretty good $50 prefix special (salmon of filet tips) that includes mashed potatoes and a desert (get the cheesecake....it's AMAZING!) I got the salmon and it was good. One person's steak was majorly undercooked. She's pregnant and when mentioned the food server seemed to push her on just cutting it open and turning it upside down to cook more on her plate. My friend is pregnant and can't eat bloody meat!! So said no- take it back to the kitchen. The server did, but only after making the whole situation uncomfortable for us all.  They offer not one grass-fed meat option which just doesn't seem right at the price points. The main reason for 3 stars is the service. I know it's tourist central and so they're busy, but I expect more from a high-priced, supposedly higher-end place. A couple times we sat with empty, dirty dishes or glasses after a staffer had come to our table. We had a dirty utensil and then someone found something floating in their water. I ordered a glass of wine and the server who brought it out announced it as something other than the glass I ordered. When I corrected her asking if it was in fact what I ordered, she didn't know, left to ask someone and then came back to confirm it was and she was initially wrong. Not the end of the world, but not really good. Server did offer up a free desert because our troubles (even though we didn't ask for any freebies and did not complain to a manger). In retrospect, seems they should've offered a discount or drinks ...since the 4 of us already had each ordered a desert!Expected more and feel should've received more...but alas, I guess that's what you get at a place like this that will always have heavy traffic coming through it's doors.",0,0,0,Jean I.,"Manhattan, NY",134,37,40

While the steak is mouth-watering to even think about, do not skimp on the sides. We loved all the sides we got (I believe we tried most of them since we had a fairly large party) and if we had not ordered them, our entire experience would have been compromised. They have a special pineapple-infused drink that I would highly recommend as well, but that might because I have incredible sweet tooth and love of cocktails.

They fixed it without any complaint, unlike many other places. The service was also very good; you'll never have to wait long should something be needed.Aside from the steaks, do try the lobster mac and cheese side and the crab cakes appetizer!My major complaint is a personal one. The restaurant was super-noisy! Much more than a restaurant of this caliber should be. Some say that this just adds to the atmosphere of being there.

4.0,1/4/2015,"As a Texan I have an obscene addiction to quality steak. Being that Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse is within the vicinity of my office, it is a natural progression of life that I would visit here often during weekdays.Every other week or so I find myself stealing a lunch away from the desk with my PIC*. We head here for a fun conversation with our bartenders (Kevin and Larry) while indulging in some delicious filet mignon bites cooked rare on top of a bed of hot 'n buttered mash potatoes. On the pretty non-existent occasion we do not order red meat, the buffalo shrimp and the burrata are excellent choices.Sometimes with our visits there's alcohol involved (i.e. the signature house VIP cocktail made with pineapple infused vodka). Sometimes it's dessert instead. It just depends on what kind of day we're having. I always sit at the bar downstairs if I can because it is the best place to people watch especially at lunch time. There are so many B list celebs and news anchors that come through that door it's not even funny. I usually don't recognize any of them because I'm NY celebrity impaired but my friend always does. If you are joining the party after work I suggest you get there pronto as in before 5:15pm. The downstairs bar fills up quickly and it becomes impossible to stand anywhere near it as it fills up with suits and their dates for the evening. Still for meat and for people watching, this midtown restaurant with it's humongous floor-to-second-story windows truly is one of my favorite spots.*PIC = Partner In Crime",13,8,8,Leslie D.,"New York, NY",1565,656,1217

Before I even knew it, the glass was refilled. I don't think I have ever had service this snappy before. I knew I was going to be in for a good night. Our service was Elaine BTW and she was fabulous. I did get that vibe about ordering more food, but not too bad at all.Here is what we ordered and my review because I tasted them all LOL:Appz werecrab cake: excellent, best ever. Very tender meat. How do they do it?lobster bisque: YUMMY! We all liked it and dipped our bread in it too!Sides wereFrench Fries: not on the menu but my daughter wanted it so we got it. Good.Chateau Potatoes: like mashed potatoes. Not bad, not earth shattering either.Creamed spinach: very very good! creamy and delicious. Well seasoned.lobster mac and cheese: very good. Honestly I think mine is better LOLEntrees:ribeye steak: VERY GOOD! Got it medium rare. Nicely charred on the outside and warm red in the middle. Only minus is that they put too much pepper. But it did taste very good!shrimp scampi: Very delicious and creamy. It was a nice take. Only negative was that the shrimp (5 of them) were a tad overcooked.Sesame crusted tuna: my wife ordered it medium rare and it was not as good as she liked. In hindsight, we should have ordered it rare. They didn't give enough of the wasabi sauce so we had to ask for some but no big deal.Pan roasted chicken breast: My nephew had this and he really liked it. I also tried a drumstick and it was very good. Not dry! They had a nice sauce on it.Elaine asked us about d-e-s-s-e-r-t and I said n-o-. No room lol.A few more things:1) This is dressy but I doubt they are going to turn you away because you came in jeans like I did.2) Menu and bathroom (no changing room) not very kid friendly but we got it to work okay!3) I asked about the lobster tails and they start with a 16 oz for $95. YIKES. No we did not get that Im sorry to say lol4) For those complaining about the overpriced wagyu longbone, just don't get it. Sounds like a tourist trap to me.5) We did get a glass of Del Frisco cabernet and it was $17. 6) They had a big free jar of jelly bellies at the entry.

4.0,12/30/2014,"I recently ate at Del Frisco's with my husband after hearing about its great reviews.  It was what I expected--a high quality steakhouse that is easily comparable with a Morton's, Michael Jordan's, etc.  The decor, menu options, and general vibe was predictable, but we enjoyed our experience.The hostesses were pleasant, though the young woman working at the ""coat check"" wasn't very friendly.  I brought our coats over, and clearly had interrupted her reading time, which certainly didn't bother me, although she could have smiled.  Being one of the first faces we saw, and someone that worked in the ""front of the house"", you'd think she'd be a bit more personable.  The rest of the staff, however, were very accommodating, and friendly.  Our server had a great personality and was very attentive.The bread is a simple, sesame variety--- nothing special.  But then again, people don't come to this restaurant for its bread.The cocktail list wasn't extensive (the wine choices are copious, though)-- I decided on the ""VIP"" cocktail-- $18 was overpriced in my opinion, but infused vodkas aren't found at a lot of restaurants, so it was a nice treat.We had the shrimp cocktail for an appetizer-- 6 shrimp for $24--- pretty standard and reasonable.  The shrimp weren't enormous, but they were a decent size, and clearly were good quality.  The cocktail sauce wasn't great-- had a very ""ketchup-y"" flavor to it-- more horseradish is needed, and some lemon on the side would have enhanced the shrimp's flavor too.  The 12 oz. filet was excellent-- very juicy, flavorful, and cooked perfectly.  We added the ""Oscar"" style accompaniment, but for an extra $15, it wasn't worth it.  The crab and asparagus was barely detectable-- it was a skimpy portion.The bacon-wrapped scallops were good, but weren't excellent.  The bacon was overcooked, and I couldn't help but wonder if the meal had sat under a heat lamp for a short period of time as the sauce on the scallops had a bit of a ""skin"".  Miniature versions of this dish (that I've had as an app at countless weddings) has been more flavorful--the scallops needed more seasoning or sauce-- something.  There was a paltry amount of cous cous, and the dish, as a whole, lacked a wow factor.  Nothing about it was very savory.  Just a simple dish.  Scallops and bacon can nearly melt in your mouth if seasoned and ""dressed"" right.Our side dish came out very late, but it wasn't a big deal, and our server and one of the managers was very apologetic, and it was comped off the bill.  Once the creamed spinach arrived, it was enjoyable, though even a little more cream would have enhanced it.We tried the lemon cake which was a special-- it was wonderful.  It was moist, buttery, and had the right amount of lemon without being tart; the frosting was delicious, as well.  I might recommend a raspberry coulis sauce to go with it just to add a little something extra to further enhance the lemon flavor.  Though excellent, it needed something else-- it was just a big piece of cake with no garnish, or extra side to it.I would probably return, as there were some interesting sides that I'd like to try-- king crab gnocchi, lobster mac and cheese, etc.",0,0,0,Maria T.,"Middletown, CT",0,6,0

There was so much crab meat. I would recommend splitting this with another person, to eat the whole thing by myself would be too much.Bone In Rib Eye - we ordered the medium rare and they gave us something that was more rare than medium rare....and it was actually preferable! I would recommend getting it closer to rare (now that I know).  The steak was indeed so flavorful and melts in your mouth - no doubt about that.  Being that this is my first full steak (I didn't eat beef for a long time), I would say it is hard to top.  Noteworthy sides:Cauliflower - mmmm truffleMushrooms - just nice to go with steak.Skippable Sides:Lobster mac and cheese - tasted so bland to meAsparagus - also bland and boringService was great... nothing else makes you feel like kings and queens when you have 5 people serving you sides from all different directions and cutting the steak for you.  They were extremely accommodating and attentive.And of course, it was to be expected that the server had every single wine memorized in their encyclopedia thick wine menu.  Also, complimentary dessert for our birthday girl was much appreciated!HOWEVER.  For such a well-established restaurant, I expected more.  They got our orders wrong - my friend's steak was medium when he asked for medium rare.  They switched our medium rare with another friend's rare. They also incorrectly charged my other friend an absurd amount for a drink ($48).  These things just rub me off the wrong way when you are paying an arm and a leg for dinner.  I'm sure it was just a fluke, but it is hard for me to look past it.ALSO we waited about half an hour past our reservation.  it is a busy season, but still.  If I were to take a client here, I would be furious.All in all, I think I would take someone back here for a special occasion.

Basically just two huge strips of bacon on top of iceberg lettuce.

5.0,12/16/2014,"We went last night for an early-ish dinner before we went to the Radio City Christmas show.  Reservations at 6, walked in and seated right away.  Service - Our waiter was very nice, knowledgeable and attentive.  We've been to plenty of restaurants that have amazing food but poor service - this was not one of them.  Despite the restaurant being completely packed, we never felt rushed to finish up.  Our waiter came by numerous times throughout dinner just to refill our glasses and when I went to the restroom, I returned to a neatly folded napkin.  5 star service for sure.Food - We ordered a crab cake and ceaser salad to start.  The crab cake was so good and probably the best crab cake we've ever had.  The salad was good, nothing outstanding.  For dinner, I ordered the bacon wrapped sea scallops..soooo good.  My husband had the chefs special filets.  It was three 4oz filets with foie gras on one, a mushroom and red wine reduction on another, and crab and asparagus béarnaise on the last.  I'm not a big steak eater, especially filet mignon but these were amazing..I couldn't stop eating his!  We also ordered the corn (for him), lobster mac and cheese (for us, amazing), and the daily vegetable (broccoli for me).  Would definitely get the Mac and cheese again..maybe try some other sides next time.  Dessert was a banana bread pudding..more like a cake than pudding but very good.  I'm a skeptic when it comes to restaurants. We've been to so many places in the city that are supposed to be amazing, and we left feeling ""eh"".  This is definitely not one of those places.  Very pleased and we will be back!",1,0,1,Alexandra Z.,"Pelham Manor, NY",21,17,6
5.0,12/15/2014,"First, the customer service was spectacular. The staff works like a well oiled machine! Everything we ordered was incredibly delicious. None in ribeye, fantastically juicy, succulent and tender. Sweet potato mash, just the right amount of sweet and nice texture. The crab cakes were that of legend. I have sought out the best crab cakes in Baltimore so my standards are high. These were seasoned perfectly, no filler, with a lobster hollandaise sauce that was the perfect complement. Cheesecake can vary in texture, density and crust. I was reluctant to order one that i didn't trust. The server (whom suggested everything we ordered) assured that the use of whipped cream instead of sour cream gave their cheesecake a wonderfully creamy fluff. She was right again. Crab cakes, ribeye, sweet potatoes, cheesecake were all perfectly executed",2,0,1,Rebecca S.,"Detroit, MI",156,2,23

4.0,12/8/2014,"Fancy - Check, Great Service - Check, Expensive - Check, but most importantly Great Steak? Check! Having been here awhile ago, wondered how it blew past me to have never reviewed the restaurant. I came here for an early dinner on a weekday and it was nearly empty inside, completely understandable. There were a few tables here and there taken, but most of the patrons were outside shopping. The restaurant is absolutely up-scale classy, but more in a classical way and not of the sleek, modern way that you see of many of the posh, trendy restaurants today. In retrospect, it's sort of in-between when it came to the décor. It wasn't of the modern design, but at the same time it wasn't completely old-school. It is also a very large restaurant with 2 floors and magnificent floor to ceiling windows that span from the ground to the 2nd floor, which gives every customer a view of what's going on outside no matter where they sit.As for what my tablemate and I ordered, it was pretty typical of what we normally order when we are at a steakhouse, and you can even say the traditional sides:Sauteed Mushrooms - This side was pretty good, but I wasn't the biggest fan of it. They sautéed whole baby bella mushrooms and it came out pretty flavorful, unfortunately I wasn't a huge fan of the type of mushrooms themselves. I preferred that they either chop the mushrooms into pieces or have used different mushrooms instead.Spinach Supreme - Delicious! It came out piping hot, but it was perfectly mixed between the spinach and the cream! It was exactly the way I love my creamed spinach.Filet Mignon - Excellent! Cooked almost to perfection at the temperature I requested, medium rare. Not many complaints here. The cut of steak was very juicy and easy to cut into. There was one small observation I had and that was that the plate seemed so plain. It was a small cut of steak on a white plate and nothing else to decorate the plate. Don't get me wrong, the steak was excellent and my small comment has nothing to do with the flavoring. It's just that when I pay so much for a piece of steak at such a fancy restaurant, I expected a bit more ""pizzazz"" on the plate to liven it up. The steak seemed almost boring.One final comment I have is about the service. As expected, the service was superb. Our waiter came by to check up on us at the perfect times, but at the same time not intruding on our dinner.",3,1,0,Chris E.,"Brooklyn, NY",530,1118,9624

5.0,12/3/2014,"Del Frisco's exceeds expectations from start to finish.  I made my reservation through OpenTable for Sunday night (1000 points! Check out the times on OT).The hostess was friendly and smiling when we arrived.  We probably waited about 2 minutes before someone came to seat us.  I brought my own cupcakes for the birthday dinner as a surprise and the hostess kindly took it for me. She let me know she would give it to our server and that they also offer a complimentary slice of cake for birthdays. As much as I wanted it, we already had the cupcakes lol. Can't be too much of a fat kid if I am already going to indulge in other things at Del Frisco.We were seated at a nice, big booth for the two of us.. overlooking 6th Avenue and the beautiful, Christmas decorations.  The view itself was amazing.  The booth was comfortable and we were seated in front of the wine cellar.  It was quite a sight.Our server was knowledgeable and told us the specials in a clear & concise voice.  We started with the Caesar salad and crab cake.  The caesar is fresh and the dressing, garlicky and flavorful.  The crab cake is a must have when you are at Del Frisco's!  Lump crab meat paired with a delicious lobster, cajun sauce.  Just the right amount to satisfy you, yet leave you with enough room for your steak.I had the 12 oz. filet cooked medium rare.  It was a little rare for me, but the hot plate helped to cook it a little more.  The salt, pepper, & butter was enough to season the steak and bring out it's natural flavors.  It was tender and just melt in your mouth.  The size was a little large for me, I only ate half.. but who doesn't love leftovers?  My date's ribeye was delicious and much more flavorful than mine due to the marbling of his cut.We shared the potatoes au gratin and fresh veggie of the day - broccoli with garlic & oil. Delicious! I wanted to keep eating, but I had to save room for dessert.Yeah it's pricey, but you really get what you pay for.  For the quality of the food and the phenomenal service, Del Frisco's is definitely a place you want to splurge on.  Needless to say, my birthday boy really enjoyed his birthday dinner at his favorite restaurant in the city.",4,0,2,Mindy T.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",495,715,657

2.0,11/28/2014,"So, I went to a Broadway play with the Mrs and decided to book Del Friscos for a late dinner. After conferring with the receptionist  for date and time, I also added that it was my wife's birthday. Upon entering the nostalgic looking building, the inside opened up to a termites wet dream, wood everywhere. What you would expect from a New York Steakhouse. The hostess then seated us and asked if it was a special occasion to which I said yes, my wifes birthday. The ambiance was very nice but a tad noisy. We settled into our seats and ordered the VIP drink for her and a bourbon for me. We also had a sparkling bottle of water with lime. Our waited then briskly gave us the specials in the best monotone voice imaginable. After placing our appetizer order of Crab Cake  and raw oysters the bread finally arrived. The crab cake was well built and tasted very fresh, the oysters were also good but only came (6) to an order. Now onto the main course. We both had Filet Mignon with cream spinach and lobster Mac and cheese. Both steaks were ordered med. When they arrived, our server asked us to cut them open in his presence to check the center....  Yes, I had to cut my steak open at a supposedly  renowned NYC steak house. Out of all the places we travels and all the steaks I have ate, this was a first.. made it feel that they didn't trust the cook. Well the center of mine was alright (no where near perfect) but my wifes was charred and clearly over cooked. We didn't send it back due to the old school mentality of they will just get pissed and mess with the food. Well, at least we got the steak because the sides did not come out for another 20 minutes. The waiter was non existent at this point which really set me off. When the sides finally came, I decided to complain because after all, I had my food already...  Well all he did was apologize. By this time my wifes steak was completely overcooked due to the extremely hot plate it was served on.  The steak itself was alright, not the best I ever had or maybe this place just rubbed me the wrong way so I wasn't going to be happy either way. I then noticed that the glass of water that my wife was drinking was empty and no one had taken the time to fill her glass up. This really pissed me off even more, I'm not made on money so, when I go out and have to spend these exuberant prices for everyday items, I expect a better service, more attention to detail. It just so happens that after the steak dinner, the waiter showed up with a dessert menu. we ordered and waited.... and waited.... and waited... and waited all the while watching people around us get their dessert with a mix of birthday candles for diners. My wife was laughing saying they were taking long because they were setting up her candles.. I laughed too.. well we were both wrong, out came the cake.. no candles, no care in the world.. At least she laughed and said it was alight but wanted to get out of this Cheescake factory steak house!Overall, the experience was touristy and expensive for poor service.  The bill was over $300.00 w/o tip.. well, I gave 20 as a tip and shed my normal 20%.

She will be remembered as one of my favorite servers that I've ever had, because she reminded me of myself when I was a server! She was attentive, witty, sweet and when she asked if we were celebrating anything and learned it was our first anniversary, she brought us a nice little treat :). I loved her!We started with the lobster bisque and the fried oysters; both were amazing. The soup was impeccably seasoned and the the oysters were the same, somehow still light even though they were fried. I also have to say the bread was light and delicious and the butter was oh so deliciously whipped!  Soooo light and fluffy. Krista did a really good job of giving us a red wine suggestion after we told her the type of red we liked; we had a bottle of En Route, 2012 vintage.  Delish!We shared a 32oz Waygu for dinner, with a side of the lobster Mac and cheese. Thanks to Krista for explaining how the chef prepares medium vs. medium-rare, we ordered it medium and it was PERFECT.  The crust on the outside of the steak was perfectly seasoned and crispy, an the tenderness of the meat was unparalleled. Lastly, Krista had mentioned a lemon cake for dessert, which was off-menu. We had her bring that and we're not disappointed. The cake has just the right amount of lemon flavor and was so buttery and delicious.

I don't think I've ever met such a server like him.  He got us complimentary glasses of champagne and even offered to chill my martini because it was sitting out too long (when really, it was just freaking gross).I reviewed the menu before our actual dinner, so we knew what we wanted.  We started off with their infamous crab cake and shrimp cocktail, which were huge pieces of fresh jumbo ones.  My bf remembered one of my favorite vineyards was Stag's Leap and ordered a bottle of their red to share together.  So good!For the entree, I got the 12 oz. filet mignon thinking I could finish it.  Fat chance!  The steak was literally heaven where it literally melted in your mouth requiring little to no chewing.  One of, if not, the best steaks I've ever eaten.  We also shared sauteed mushrooms and creamed spinach and decide to forgo the lobster mac & cheese fearing it'd be too heavy on our stomachs.Our server took his awesomeness to a new level by giving us a slice of their signature lemon cake on the house (but he was pressuring us to get it over all the other desserts as well, raving about how good it was).  The service here really was top notch though.  From waiting for us to approve our steaks the minute they bring it out to constantly accommodating our needs...I was really tempted to ask them if they were willing to hand feed me.I'd come back on an emptier stomach in due time, so I could actually try the lobster mac & cheese without the food coma.",4,1,2,Caroline K.,"Queens, NY",328,444,37

The apps/sides/whatever they were somewhat confusing given the format in which they appeared on the menu, but our waiter was happy and able to easily explain each of them. And all were delicious my personal favorites were the lobster and mac, the potatoes, and the cheesy cauliflower. I could've had the entire mac and cheese to myself but since I was with coworkers/people I like I was content with sharing. The entree, my filet, was absolutely amazing. Coked perfectly to order and consistently hot throughout our large meal. Speaking of meal size did I mention the portions? They were HUGE. Like Timberlake and Fallon in the iPhone commercials huge. Very satisfying. In sum, will definitely be back soon. If my wallet/waistline let me, that is.",1,0,1,Galen R.,"Manhattan, NY",435,148,194

3.0,11/2/2014,"This place is mostly hype and location. It's very hard to judge service here. On one hand, the staff disappears for long periods of time -- I can understand that it gets busy, but other places get busy too and they tend with a much more timely system. On the other hand, the staff is really nice -- friendly and sweet -- which is why I gave 3 stars, instead of 2. The food? Salt, salt, salt. Steaks were salty and the lobster mac and cheese was very dry. I like this place, I would cheer for its success, but the food here is not that good. In fact, it is far from any top notch steak.  If I want top notch steak, I would recommend going to Japan premium meat in east village and cook it myself. I am a huge steak fan and choose japanese meat over all the rest. This is definately far from par.Last, the music? This music is annoying, feels like I'm in some old gangster movie, too much Fred astair frank sinatra over here, and it is god awful loud and dark. The best thing about this place is that it is filled and there is a crowd scene. The staff is nice, could be nice to have them around longer I might have wanted something and decided to cut it short. Waiting for the check at the end kind of kills any moment lol.I will probably come back again on some random day, no plans for some time.P.s. the crab cakes were not as good as they used to be.",4,1,0,Michael L.,"New York, NY",88,125,666

It was so tender yet so full of crab-by taste. I could hardly resist taking bites after bites.For the main course, I ordered the medium rare rib eye with fois gras, paired with broccoli, Mac and cheese, cream spinach, etc. I had to say, this place is one of the few steakhouses in US that actually knows what ""medium-rare"" truly meant - the meat was just a bit bloody in the core which added a wealth of tender deliciousness to the taste bud; it was so complete with juiciness and meaty moisture that no sauce would have any role.

I have no object to quality of foods and services, but if  you are looking for some place where you can have an intimate family dinner, try another place.

1.0,9/9/2014,"This review is purely based on the service experience and not the food, which was good.I had lunch at Del Frisco's around 1pm today and needed to write this review while fresh on my mind.  It was a complete embarrassment for me to bring my two business guests from Japan to this restaurant.  We did not have a reservation and didn't have time to wait for seats, so we were told that we could go upstairs and use a cocktail table (with full menu service).  The cocktail table was made for two people, so the hostess upstairs said we also had the option to sit at the bar, which we did.  This is where everything service-wise went downhill.Service Issue #1There was a napkin spread out on the counter, with the menu on top.  I took the menu and proceeded to put the napkin on my lap.  The bartender asked me curtly if I had taken the white napkin and put it on my lap.  I said yes, to which he tap-tap-tapped the counter and said no, that's for the counter, put it back.  I was like, ""Really?  Are you joking?"".  He said, ""No, the black napkin is for your lap"".He took the white napkin back, returned it to its ""proper"" place on the counter, took my menu (before I was done) and then walked away.Service Issue #2We were a party of 3.  The bartender took my first guest's order, my order, and then walked away to wait on one of the cocktail tables.  He came back to the bar, got a pepper grinder, returned to the cocktail table.  Then he came back to the bar and walked passed us.  I thought maybe he forgot to take the order.  So I asked him, and he gives a condescending smile and says, ""Uh, one moment please"".  He walks away again and then finally comes back to take my second guest's order.Service Issue #3At the end of our meal, when we wanted to ask for the check, the bartender disappeared for almost 10 minutes - nowhere in sight.  There wasn't anyone behind the bar and no other servers nearby.  Finally, another server came behind the bar to get some supplies, but she didn't acknowledge us to see if we needed anything.  So I just grabbed her attention to ask if she could get the bartender that was helping us or if she could help us.  She said sure, but not before finishing up and talking with another server who the 1st server then sent over to help us instead.  I do not think for an establishment of this style/location/price-point that it should be unusual to expect that there are servers keeping an eye open for the needs of customers.So, although the food is good, I unfortunately will not ever bring a guest back to this establishment.",13,0,0,T Y.,"Forest Hills, NY",11,11,13

For sides, I got the lobster mac & cheese topped with truffle oil (yummy but I think stole too much precious tummy room from the steak) and creamed spinach.

I have tried many other steak houses in the city with wishful hopes that my boyfriend would get over his obsession with Del Friscos, but I never win. We have dined at places like Strip House and American Cut, the service may be top notch, but the steaks do not compare. This weekends visit really won me over, my 8oz fillet was so mouth watering... I think I could have ate 2. Over the weekend visit I also discovered 2 gems at this place.... The Del Friscos VIP Martini...and garlic and oil sautéed string beans (not on the menu). Both...to die for. I had 3 or 4 martinis and they are dangerous, sweet with no liquor taste. I requested the string beans because I was craving them, and although they weren't on the menu, our waitress made them happen. Skipped out on dessert this visit but I suggest the warm chocolate cake.

We got a table near the back after about 40 mins.  Our server was great!! She  was knowledgable about the menu and had a great sense of humour, she made sure to check on us regularly. The food was delicious and the portion sizes were OBSCENE! The ""side"" of onion rings could have been an entire meal.

5.0,8/13/2014,"A quintessential NYC steakhouse experience. It's has the makings of a classic old-school steakhouse: prime cuts of meat served on sizzling platters, buttery guilty sides, a wine list for days, and impeccable waiting service. Then it takes it up a notch with new touches to breathe some air into the typical ""steakhouse,"" with a less stuffy atmosphere and a few specials that keep things interesting. Del Frisco's is located inside an imposing building in the theatre district, making it perfect for a pretheatre dinner. The interior is furbished with dark+ rich wood, crisp white tablecloths, and is bustling with well-dressed people (as always, highly recommend making a reservation). While being led to your table by the maitre'd, take in the gorgeous and airy 2-level space and the sounds of happy dining and wining. The extensive wine list is impressive, so thank god the waiters are thoroughly trained to make recommendations. Keep in mind, the portions are HUGE, so promise to not judge if you leave with a food baby. Obviously, you have to order steak (personal preference is porterhouse). Start with crab cakes or other classics, and definitely order sides to share -- here's where some of the nontypical options pop up like lobster mac & cheese and cauliflower brie gratin. The prices are on par with other classy steakhouses, so expect to spend around $60-80 pp before drinks. If you are looking for a steakhouse with top-notch food + friendly and competent staff + an overall fun time, you can't go wrong with Del Frisco's.",2,2,2,Lillian Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",461,285,1300

Two days later we had a similar experience when we stopped by Del Frisco Grill for lunch.  Very unwelcoming hostesses, moved us to the outdoor patio (hot) with plenty of open seating inside the restaurant.  As expected, the food and waitress were both excellent.  Not sure I'll be back to either business as we felted somewhat discriminated against being a family with young adults.  BTW - this is not my first visit to Del Frisco's or Del Frisco's Grill, as I attend business dinners and lunches at both business's in Houston and Dallas.",0,0,0,Mike B.,"Cypress, TX",0,6,0

5.0,8/5/2014,"This restaurant is definitely deserving of 5 stars!! The experience was perfect in every way!We arrived late on a Saturday night without a reservation (party of 4) but were seated in 30-40 mins - right around the quoted time, and were able to grab a spot at the bar to get a drink while we were waiting. Drinks were expensive, but typical of the ambiance/quality/environment you expect. The restaurant itself is HUGE!!!! Absolutely massive! There is a large outdoor patio with umbrellas for shade. The first floor of the interior hosts the main bar and a large part of the dining room. Upstairs (there is also an elevator) is another, smaller bar, the bathrooms, and another large dining area. The dining area of the first floor wraps around the kitchen/restaurant interior and that combined with accent walls and good layout means that you do not feel the size of the space or cramped considering how many people are actually there.There were a lot of large tables so I assume they are adept at handling groups/large parties. Even though we were seated between several large tables (~10 people) we could hear ourselves talk and were not hard of hearing.Our server (I'm so sorry I forgot your name!! Female, dark hair, grew up Ohio/Florida (if you see this hopefully you know who you are!)) Was AMAZING. She was perfect! She new the menu like the back of her hand, gave recommendations that were spot on, and was friendly and chatted with us while telling us about the menu. Absolutely perfect service! So nice and friendly and everything she suggested was just great! I honestly don't think it would be possible to do a better job!As for the food....WOW! I shared one of the specials (three 4oz cuts each with a different sauce), my boyfriend got the special bone-in fillet, and his dad got the rib eye. He said it was one of the better ribeyes he has ever had and he is from KC where they know their meat! He said it was not fatty and just delicious! We absolutely stuffed ourselves. The sides (sweet potatoes & potatoes au gratin) were absolutely delicious also - we could not move we were so full afterwards.I cannot recommend this restaurant more! Clean, polished, attractive atmosphere, pleasant and experienced staff, amazing food - all right by Times Square. The ceilings are HUGE and the walls are floor-to-ceiling windows for a large part so you can see everything outside and let in the light. The menu consists of nearly solely fish and steak except for one chicken option or sticking to salads and soup. It is jot for the vegetarian!! Meat lovers only to appreciate the cuisine here.

No steak sauce, just the taste of well cooked beef meat.- House wine is excellent. Don't have to splurge on ______ (insert your fav wine here).- The desserts are kinda meh... but I won't take a star off.

3.0,8/2/2014,"Del Frisco's is a very solid and consistent steakhouse that just falls slightly short having to be compared to so many others in New York.  I always enjoyed my meals here, and have no true complaints about any dishes I've ever had, just that nothing stands out as absolutely amazing.  The space is absolutely beautiful, with its tall, modern all-glass wall exterior, combined with an interior with a grant staircase that leads up to a mezzanine level, and pillars and buttresses spanning this very high-ceiling level.  The last time here I ordered the 32oz Wagyu Longbone Ribeye medium-rare.  It lived up to its name, being a very long cut that was approximately 1-inch in depth cooked. It was a very good cut of meat that had well-marbled fat distributed very evenly among the steak, chunky deposits that you often find in ribeye, and was very tender.  A possible slight negative was that they may have been a little bit heavy-handed on the seasoning.  However, their standard rib eye, which is comparable in price to other New York steakhouses is sub par in my opinion.  The meaty lump crab cakes here are a well-known part of the menu.  The crab meat is good, does not stand out in terms of flavor or texture, but the cajun lobster sauce served with it is delicious.  The sides were very standard for a steakhouse, with none of the three we ordered (cream spinach, lobster mac'n cheese, and brie cauliflower) particularly standing out.  The spinach was a little too fibrous and chewy.  The lobster mac didn't capture the lobster flavor in the mac'n cheese, it tasted like two distinct dishes just put together.  The cauliflower was my favorite of the three.  One thing that absolutely blew me away however, was the dessert.  There was an off-menu 6-layer lemon cake that was super moist, super tasty, and had that perfect balance of tartness and sweetness in the icing.  I do hope this delectable dessert is here the next time I visit Del Frisco's.",3,0,1,Dennis L.,"New York, NY",76,196,1

5.0,7/22/2014,"First, a few things you need to fit in here: 1) Monocle2) Moustache with curled tips3) Old timey top hat optional Del Frisco's exists in the exclusive band of brothers synonymous with marvelous New York steak-making. However, while similar, Del Frisco's offers a unique brand of meat-nificence distinct from its brothers, Peter Luger and Wolfgang. First, you don't feel like you're eating in Gepetto's cottage (see, Peter Lugers) and second, you don't feel like you're eating steak on the 6 train during rush hour (see, Wolfgangs). The quality and delectability of beef at DF's is comparable to the other two, but what you get at Del Frisco's is rich mahogany and open spaces. Indeed, you'll feel quite debonair as you consume the animal or sea critter of your whimsy. Yes, you'll look around at the floor to ceiling windows and ornate chandelier and think, ""I am mother fu**ing Jay Gatsby."" I've had the pleasure of several visits.

5.0,7/21/2014,"I thought I would review Del Frisco's again since I was just there this past weekend. I went with my family on a Friday night and the restaurant was packed. We had an early seating since this was the only time available before 9 and we got a booth on the first floor which we requested. Unfortunately, we sat next to the steps so there was a lot of hustle and bustle, but at the same time we got to see everyone's dish which was fun! The service was good and the atmosphere is what you would expect from a steakhouse like this, high-end, a little loud and professional. Now on to the important part, the food/drink. I started off with a Blackberry Bourbon Cocktail which was delicious, not worth $17, but it's a good drink that I am glad I tried. We had no other specialty cocktails, but the wine and beer selections are quite extensive and will fulfill most needs I believe. The food was wonderful. We got the crab cake, the blue cheese wedge salad and the tuna tartar. My favorite was the wedge salad, however I would order any of the starters again. If I were to try something new I would get the shrimp, looked good. The main courses consisted of steak all around. One Filet, two Rib eye and one Filet trio (not on the menu). I loved the Rib eye and I think it is the best bang for your buck. You get a lot of meat and in my opinion it is the most flavorful, but many prefer the filet since it practically melts in your mouth. I highly recommend the trio if you haven't tried it, pricey but worth getting at least once. For our sides we got french fries (not on the menu),  Crab Gnocchi and Cream of Spinach. The Gnocchi and Spinach are delicious and my two favorite sides, the fries are good but I would recommend getting a different side since there are so many good options. We followed our dinner with dessert, possibly the best part. We got three and shared them. We got the banana bread pudding, the chocolate souffle and the Lemon Cake. The Lemon Cake is a must! No questions asked. The bread pudding and souffle were great too and I would recommend both. The souffle is dense and the pudding isn't too heavy but so moist which is amazing. You must get dessert and if you can't have it right after dinner then get the Lemon Cake to go and have it later or the next morning, it keeps amazingly well. Overall, the meal was fantastic and I highly recommend it to everyone/anyone! This restaurant is good for specific occasions too because it caters to all events and make it feel like a special night for all involved. There are only a couple downsides or recommendations for the restaurants. First of all, it's expensive, but if you are going you probably know this. Take advantage of the night and don't skip out on something you want just because it costs a few extra. My recommendation for the restaurant is to make everything that is available for the customer to order known. The waiter said the specials and a few dishes not listed on the menu, but we ordered fries and sauces (Au Poivre and Bernaise) that were not mentioned. I think the menu should be expanded to include everything available or have the waiter mention everything available. This restaurant is amazing, one of my favorites and my past visit reaffirmed this!",3,0,1,George S.,"San Francisco, CA",24,67,48

But it was pretty funny that just as he commented on the apparent decline, a herd of people straight off Jersey Shore, wearing skintight Forever 21 dresses stumbled loudly in and started fist pumping.  Really.Still, the food was insanely good.  I had the filet mignon and it was the best steak I've ever eaten.  We also ordered an off-the-menu piece of bacon to start.  It's basically just a slab of thick and crispy meat that you nom on until your other meat arrives.  The cheesy cauliflower was also fabulous.  The wine menu is legit like Faulnker-length, so if you're into that, like Snobby McSnoberson above, you will be happy.To finish, we had some cheesecake and slipped right into a food coma.  This place is crazy expensive tho, so I recommend finding a cute, non-snobby boy or your company to take you.",4,5,0,Erin E.,"Boston, MA",335,264,9
5.0,7/5/2014,"Let's start by saying that this steakhouse deserves 10 stars. So me and my significant other make it a point to do steakhouses at least 3x a year..... our birthdays and anniversary. Today is his birthday and boy am I glad I surprised him w/ this steakhouse. We had a reservation for 4:30pm... I though it was too early but it was either that time or 9:30pm... which is too late for steak. Upon our arrival we were told they were setting up our table and 5 minute later we were seated. We were the 1st guest on the second floor. There is another bar on the second floor and the restroom are there as well. We had a very spacious and comfortable booth seat, which could seat 4 or 5 people but it was just us 2. Our server was Dominic and he was extremely knowledgeable about the meat cuts, friendly and very attentive. Actually EVERYONE was very attentive and made our experience GREAT!!!Appetizer:Shrimp Cocktail & Tuna Tartar: both were very, very good.Drinks:The VIP & Blackberry Ginger cocktail: we had 2 rounds and wish we could keep going but at $17 a pop we gots to chill, lol. Entree: our MEAT was cooked to PERFECTION: medium!!!!12oz Filet Mignon and baked potato: the boyfriends reports that ""it was FUCKING DELICIOUS""Rib-eye and sweet mashed potatoes (which is not on the menu): is like an orgasm in your mouth. I was unable to finish my steak but guess who's having steak and eggs tomorrow, oh yeah!!!Dessert:Lemon cake for me and Praline Parfait for the birthday. My cake was HUGE no seriously HUGE. Having some for breakfast Monday morning w/ coffee as suggested by one of the servers. As for the Parfait...the boyfriend reports that it was: DECADENT!!!! For those that don't know him, he never uses this word to describe food... so I know it was DELICIOUS!!!!The steakhouse is fancy but you can wear jeans and a nice top and call it a day. Be prepared to spend $$$ but it is well worth it. This restaurant is a staple. Oh I did so good with this choice. The pictures say it all!!!",3,0,1,Liliana R.,"Bronx, NY",48,130,225

To that, I say NAY tis free and is topped with seeds. Eat up. They'll bring you more. Can you get a third round?What we ate:- Bread- Greens with fried pig bits- Hot plate of steak (we did not eat the plate but the steak was soft at its core with a crisp coat)- Fish (the kind that swam up the stream to mate pre-death)- Mac 'n' cheese with red shelled fish. HOLY SHIT it was good.- More greens but these were round - Fried rings the size of Mars (they bring them stacked on top to wow and scare you, can you feel your heart stop? But do not fear, forge on with your fork (or hands))- A cake of cheese- Booze and cream A paid man (or chick) lurks in the bath to give you what you want (a mint).One week goes by.

5.0,7/2/2014,"Another leg of our Promax conference/eat & drink NY tour... We enjoyed an ultra-fancy private lunch (in the wine cellar, no less) here which was quite an experience. While the wine cellar felt isolated and a little dark during lunch, we were in the freakin' wine cellar that required an escalator ride to get to. Lunch started with a salad that included a delicious bright green dressing and entire strips of crispy fried bacon carefully laid on the top. Del Frisco ain't messing around with the toppings here.I choose the seared Ahi tuna steak for my main, which was perfectly cooked (which was barely cooked at all), with a biting wasabi sauce on top. I probably should have tried the steak, being at a famous steakhouse, but this strategy allowed me to eat more of the wonderful sides, which were served family-style. And they kept coming. And coming. Lobster mac and cheese. Creamy mashed potatoes. Potatoes au gratin. Sautéed fresh veggies. Some corn confetti veggie yum-ness. Leaving room for dessert was a sick joke.Until we ordered giant ""oh I can't eat that, oh actually I'll take the entire slice that's as big as my head down in like 3 minutes"" NY style strawberry cheesecake.Roll me out in a cart and call it a day.

I got the prime porterhouse 24 oz and it was the epitome of perfection - perfectly cooked, seasoned well, and it melted in my mouth. The crab cake was also great and the sides are very filling (we got the lobster mac n' cheese and I believe chateau potatoes).The service was also great and our waitress was very friendly. The only downside was the fact that there was a bachelor dinner party right near us and the men were really fucking annoying! So I'd advise management to adjust seating if there are annoying parties going on.

Then, the huge windows look out over the Radio City Music Hall. The food is equally awesome. The Filet Mignon is mouthwatering. My other favorites are the Crab Cake (humongous), the Cauliflower & Brie Au Gratin, the Lobster Bisque, and the Maque Choux Corn. Finally, if that wasn't enough, the service is excellent in every sense. The restaurant clearly prides itself on providing the highest level of customer service.

Medium rare.  Nothing else.  He paired me up with a fantastic glass of red wine, I didn't ask what it was but it was outstanding.  Then the steak came.  Perfection.  Seasoned perfectly, cooked perfectly.  I savored every single bite.

5.0,6/25/2014,"I'm always on the search for the BEST steak, but for some reason it's hard to come by. However, this is the best steakhouse I've ever had in NY and the second best steakhouse I've ever been too. Coming here for birthdays has been a regular thing now, I come at least twice a year. There's nothing I dislike about this place. But, some dishes I do highly recommend:Appetizer:- Crab Cake (packed with crab meat, definitely don't skim out on you!)- Shrimp Cocktail (soo good! And the shrimps are huge!)- Calamari (your usual app, nothing crazy)Entree:- Filet Mignon (this is personally my favorite cut of the meat)- Prime Ribeye (if you're looking for a steak with A LOT of flavor, this is the cut of meat you're looking for)So we all know it, we can to Del Frisco's primarily for the STEAK! The steak is super tender and moist, with every bite ... It just melts in your mouth! (Writing this, is making my mouth water). I personally can never finish the steak, well cause I don't have a huge stomach but I'm one to ""eat with my eyes"", so I usually bring my steak home and whip it up in an omelette the next day! Not as moist as the day of, but damn the flavor sure is still there! To top of your steak you absolutely need to order some side dishes, even if you can't finish everything. Trust me you won't regret it! Side Dishes:- Lobster Mac n' Cheese (need a say more? Seafood added to your typical comfort food! Just delicious!!)- Spinach (I'm one that always needs some greens in my meals, super delicious as well! Just FYI it's not sautéed it's creamy!)Desserts:- Bread Pudding (I'm not a fan of bread pudding but my significant other loves it, I did give it a try, and it was surprisingly yummy! If you're a banana lover, definitely give this a try!)- Chocolate Cake (I just love the idea of warm chocolate cake with ice cream together (yummy), therefore I'm a bit bias on this one)I couldn't recall the cocktails I had, all I can recall was, I had a drink with bourbon in it, sounded delicious! But, I disliked it only because I'm not a bourbon girl. However, you can never go wrong with pairing your red meat with a nice glass of red wine! Just simply a marriage of flavors dancing in your mouth!And if your wondering about the atmosphere and service: great for small and big parties, your waiter is always attentive and ready to serve you!

5.0,6/20/2014,"One of the top 5 meals I've ever had. And it wasn't even my birthday. Came here for my roommate's birthday and some friends, for the third installment of our Ron Swanson series. I set up everything through Open Table and we got seated upstairs, near the window, which had a really nice view. The overall atmosphere is very lively, and we were glad that we were placed at a table that was a little less loud. My friends thought I had planned the table placement, but I'll never tell. Anyways, we started off with some drinks, and our server was very chatty and great with recommendations. I went with a Lagavulin, neat, just like Ron Swanson would. Delicious and smokey, and just the right start to our meal.My friends and I each ordered our own steaks and I ordered the sides for the table. We got the mushrooms, potatoes au gratin, creamed spinach, cauliflower, and skillet potatoes. It was crazy because a flock of waitresses came out with the sides and distributed them to our plates for us. My favorite sides were the cauliflower and the spinach. Cauliflower was roasted perfectly and the spinach wasn't too mushy and actually had some texture with all of that cream. All the sides were great, except I probably wouldn't order the skillet potatoes again, because it was like ordering homemade potato chips, which were good, but not $14 good. That being said, out of all of the steakhouses I've been to in New York, the sides at Del Frisco's, as a whole, are probably the best I've ever had. I ordered the prime porterhouse, which was prepared at just the right temperature, and well-seasoned. I tried my friend's ribeye as well, which was delicious, but a bit on the fatty side. But yeah, the steak was great, as expected, and everyone was too happy to talk for awhile. Our waiter kept checking in on us and told us stories about NFL Draft prospects coming in that day (the day before the NFL Draft) and being too scared to order nice things. Those kids. They'll learn soon enough.The waiter caught wind that it was my roommate's birthday and surprised us with a complimentary wedge of lemon cake, which was enormous and delicious. The cake itself was moist, and the frosting had a bit of tang and wasn't too overwhelming. We had to loosen a few belt buckles, but we didn't feel disgusting afterwards, which was great.

5.0,6/18/2014,"To close out an amazing first anniversary with my husband, we decided to end our night with dinner at Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House as they were the sponsor of his little league team in Texas. We booked the reservation while at Chicago and on the eve of the Tony's awards, we were still able to be seated (in probably the best seat in the house!). We walked into the restaurant and were amazed by the grandiosity of the place. Dark, mahogany wood adorned the bar, the booths, the chairs; two story glass windows opened the room up to the outside activity, and everyone seemed so happy to see you. While waiting for our table, I tried the margarita martini by suggestion of the bartender and it was delicious. I could have stayed at the bar drinking those all night and would have been perfectly content. Our table was upstairs so we walked up the grand staircase and into the dark, intimate seating area. There was a bar with a TV playing the Spurs game and another had the Tony's on. From our corner seat against the railing we had a view of the Fox ticker, Simon and Schuster across the street, Radio City music hall and a bird's eye view of the patron's dishes below. Our table was quiet and our servers, attentive. Our waitress throughout the evening really impressed us with her knowledge of the extensive wine list. We picked one we thought we'd like and she found us a better, even more moderately priced, wine (Amapola Creek). I had to have the prime rib, though very tough to make up my mind with so many amazing beef dishes available, which we pared with the chateau potatoes. The combination of the medium rare, juicy prime rib with the soft, warm potatoes practically numbed all of my senses. Next time I would like to try the mac and cheese. For dessert they surprised us with a cheesecake that came decorated with a ""happy anniversary"" edible banner written in beautiful script as well as a lemon cake with candles in it. Overall, my husband and I had a magical evening that was made absolutely perfect by the quality, care and attention provided by Del Frisco's. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone for any occasion: business meeting, celebration, date night.

5.0,6/17/2014,"I've dined here twice and both times were pretty good.  I highly suggest not planning much afterwards because the steak can very likely put you in a food coma.  I suggest sharing a Wagyu Longbone 32 oz. for 2 or 3 people depending on your hunger level.  It's $95 but in my opinion way better than the other steaks.  The medium rare is really red and rare.  I think I'll go back and order my steak medium next time around.  The sauteed mushroom sides are delicious along with the maque choux corn.  Last time, 5 of us shared 3 sides and 2 Wagyu Longbones, which was the perfect amount of food.  Also, the bread doesn't look all that great but it's in fact warm and yummy so beware of the carb filler in the beginning!  Two thumbs up!",2,1,2,Vicky C.,"Manhattan, NY",208,160,0

Nothing compares to the spicy, creamy goodness of those crab cakes. The steaks are top notch. Seriously, they are cooked to perfection. The sides are incredible. The best ones are definitely Superior Spinach and Lobster Mac n' Cheese. For dessert, you gotta stick to the lemon cake. It has the sweetest icing you'll ever taste. Not sure who makes it for them, but I want their recipe. Above everything else, Del Frisco's is right across the street from Rockefeller Center, overlooking Radio City, 30 Rock and Fox News. You can't get a better view than that. Del Frisco's is definitely on the expensive end (oh my god yes), but it is worth every penny.",0,0,0,Anthony I.,"New Rochelle, NY",244,163,0

3.0,5/13/2014,"This is my wife's first time in NY and we really wanted to go to Peter Luger's, but couldn't get a reservation, not even for lunch.  Del Frisco's had great reviews so why not.  The location was easy to find located in a major office tower and the place is huge.  This is clearly a wall street hangout from the looks of things.  We were seated on the second floor with a view out the large glass walls onto the street.  The two couples sitting adjacent to us were very noisy and obnoxious - think they were inflicted with some form of functional Turrets syndrome.  Almost had to walk over and ask them to keep the cussing down because we were getting so turned off.   Fortunately, they were finishing up and left just when I thought I couldn't stand it any longer.  The menu was pretty typical of a high end steak house.  We started with a dozen oysters and  foie gras, which they were kind enough to prepare off the menu for us to start, followed by a blue cheese wedge salad, and shared a Wagyu long bone in ribeye, finishing with a banana bread pudding.   I ordered a glass of white wine to start, which the waiter unfortunately forgot.  I was already through the appetizers and almost finished my salad when it arrived.  He was apologetic and I noticed the wine was generously poured with like gesture.  Our waiter was very polite but a bit unpolished.  I asked how thick the ribeye was cut and he didn't know, guessing it was 3/4"".  He made me question that my 32 ounce steak, being only 3/4"" thick, might look like a big pan cake.  I also asked how many days they age their meat, and if it is dry or wet aged - he didn't know the answer to that either.  He did go through the effort to get the answers to my questions before finalizing my order.  Turns out they cut the long bone in ribeye 1 1/2"" thick and is wet aged at least 15 days.  I preferred dry aged beef, but was fine with it.The oysters arrived and they were good, not great.  I would have expected them to be a bit more fresh and robust.  They were far from bad, just not great, and they didn't come with enough lemons so I had to go with the champagne vinegar for the last couple.  We love foie gras and never miss a chance to indulge, but unfortunately this is definitely not their specialty.  At first it appeared to be a generous portion on six half pieces of toasts, but turns out they were cut so thin they were seared all the way through.  It was painful to see foie prepared in such fashion,  The salad was good albeit the blue cheese dressing was a bit too sweet for my taste.  My wife who prefers sweet loved it.  By now, we were anxiously waiting for the meat.  It arrived impressive as a long bone in ribeye should, and was carved for us at the table.  I must say that I was not overwhelmed, but not disappointed.  The meat was tender but not so tender as I would expect of Wagyu, but again the waiter didn't actually know where the Wagyu came from.  It was also not executed that well.  It looked and tasted under seared, leaving the crust absent of the crispy sweetness of the caramelized fat.  It tasted like an abundance of  butter was used, which I think is unnecessary when a steak is properly grilled.   It was good not great.  The button mushrooms were ok.  I usually like my mushrooms seared in butter, with just a touch of salt and pepper.  I'm not sure what they used, but it made the mushrooms a bit on the sweet side, not really to our liking.  Infact, my wife wanted to send it back.  I really didn't care as my expectations already came way down.  The lobster mac and cheese was also underwhelming being too salty for my taste.  In the end, the banana bread pudding was very good and left me quite happy and full.  The bill was 300.00 exactly including tip, which is pretty typical for these places.  Next time I will pay better attention and make sure I reserve well in advance at Peter Luger's.",0,1,0,Johnny R.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,44,11

My husband has been to Del Frisco's 3 times & myself once before & thoroughly enjoyed it so we decided to have dinner there again. Made reservations for a Tuesday evening (7:30) & was able to be seated early. Started with a cocktail. I tried The VIP drink. A blend of sweet vodka & pineapple. Yummy!  My husband, the Pomegranate martini. For dinner, he had the bone in rib eye & thought it was very good. Cooked  as he requested (medium rare). I had one of the specials, the filet mignon trio. Each had its own special topping, a buttery bleu cheese, a crab meat with a creamy bearnaise & lastly my favorite, a melt in your mouth port foie gras butter. Heaven! For our sides, a baked potato for my husband & to share, a most delectable Cauliflower & Brie au gratin. To top it off, their house wine. A definite recommend as well. We had such a wonderful dinner, but unfortunately we had no room for dessert. So, even though our dinner was fantastic, it was made even nicer by our waitress Rebekah & restaurant manager Scott. Rebekah was attentive, making sure we were enjoying our meal without us feeling as if she was hovering. And restaurant manager Scott even came up to us to check on how we were doing that evening. And to top that off, when we got home from vacation, a handwritten thank you card was waiting for us in the mail from Rebekah, thanking us for our visit. Now realize, you will spend a pretty penny eating at Del Frisco's, but it's well worth it. If it's your first time in NYC or a local & haven't yet tried Del Frisco's, you really need to. Make that reservation, even ask for Rebekah if you can & go enjoy a wonderful meal!  For goodness sake, go treat yourself to a wonderful dinner. You won't regret it.

Nonetheless, they were able to squeeze us in at 8:45PM.The restaurant has an upscale feel with beautiful interior and artwork on walls. There are 2 floors, both has it's own bar. Restrooms are upstairs only.We shared a ribeye medium rare, sea bass, and sauteed mushrooms. The ribeye was excellent! Cooked perfectly medium on the outside and pink all the way through. Each bite was juicy and tender.The sea bass was a bit of a let down. This was recommended by a friend who had dined here several months ago. The fish was overcooked.The tiny chunks of pineapple and black bean sauce help finish the fish. The mushrooms were nothing spectacular and on the salty side. I had a glass of Sauvignon Blanc from Napa that was wonderful and went really well with my fish.

We had a party of ten and were seated in the wine cellar room so we had more space and a quieter area which we greatly appreciated. We started with the burrata and tomato salad, creamy and delicious - highly recommend! We also had the crab cakes which had large lump crab meat and a delicious sauce. For the main course we had the special Rib Eye which was so flavorful and cooked to perfection. We had a few porter house steaks which were all cooked perfectly and had a wonderful salty crust. In terms of steak houses the porterhouse comes in at second to Peter Luger (this is a huge compliment!). For sides we had the lobster mac and cheese, potato gratin, onion rings, and creamed spinach. I recommend the onion rings and creamed spinach. While the Mac and Cheese and Potatoes were both good, it was a bit heavy with the meal. To top off the evening our server Chris was beyond wonderful.

2.0,4/30/2014,"I write this review with great sadness, as I expected so much better from critically acclaimed Del Frisco's. To start with the positives: the ambiance is pretty, the views are nice and the reservations we made didn't take long to be honored. Also, the pear martini I had was delicious and one of my favorite's. Now with the bad: Del Frisco's tries hard but just isn't worth the very hefty price tag. The service we had was HORRIBLE. We were sat (party of 8) in a tiny corner upstairs in a small room, and the waitress barely stopped by twice throughout the entire night. She was not friendly, nor attentive. Really a shame. The food was OK - just Ok - and I'm really not very hard to please. I had the ahi tuna which was rare (as it should be) but was served with a wasabi sauce that was just not tasty. I've literally had better rare tuna in a local sushi spot. My boyfriend tried the bacon wrapped scallops which were edible but nothing short of average. The rest of my party seemed to enjoy their side dishes more than the entries (the potato au gratin would be the only dish to really write home about) and the lobster mac and cheese was not great. Overall - there is really NOTHING to write home about here, and I say this with complete certainty. Although it's a landmark and has several loyal customers, this steakhouse is nothing special, not in it's quality of food or service.

3.0,4/29/2014,"This is NYC, we have plenty of amazing steakhouses. I have eaten here twice and it just doesn't deliver to expectations. Food: Bone in rib-eye was cooked perfectly (Rare-warm) but was seasoned like I was at some sort of Cajun chophouse. My favorite thing was the calamari, done with a chili sauce and banana peppers it is truly an app that belongs on every table. And while the calamari was truly phenomenal, if that is my favorite thing about your steakhouse...Service: It was good but only about half of us drink wine and apparently the waiter was ready to play sommelier because of that? He did a good job/showed knowledge and care but I am paying top prices, I expect a sommelier at the table..even if my father only wants to order ""the house red"" (true story). It was not my ""party"" or I would have made an issue..instead I came to Yelp about it. Atmosphere: Very nice, fine dining with a casual feel which is nice because food should be fun not stuffy.

3.0,4/28/2014,"Overrated. There are plenty of great steak houses in NYC; this one is only so-so. The bread for the table is nothing to rave about. When dining, the bread is like the overture, and is always a good way to understand what you're in for. This was nothing inspiring, and in fact, disappointing, which properly foreshadowed the rest of my meal. I am in NYC not Iowa; the bread at my table should be fantastic, especially at these prices.A few giveaways as to what was really going on in the kitchen was the addition of bacon to their creamed spinach and the amount if cheese in their potatoes Lyonnaise. Chefs without skill use things like bacon and ridiculous amounts of cheese to distract you from their subpar dishes. This is the same strategy employed by the chain restaurants. The problem is that most average diners don't understand what these two sides should actually taste like in their purest form. Excellent food is about balance, not overkill. And bacon does notable everything better. The real issue with this is the cost relative to the food. Unless someone else is paying for this, I would not go out of my way to eat here again. Much of the rave reviews are from people who, I believe, do not eat in many upscale steak houses. My two favorite steak houses are Peter Lugar's in Brooklyn and Barkley Prime in Philly.

He was craving Lobster Bisque, which I never craved until I had one at Del Frisco's. So. Good. Such a great balance of creamy, not too liquid-y or solid, with enough spice for a bit of a kick and light tomato flavor. I was a little confused by the giant croutons, like do I just gobble one down in a single bite like an animal, or do I try to break it and inevitably splash myself with soup, I don't know.So, a delicious crab cake (recommend!) and a round of oysters later, I was getting full. Shared one of the large steak specials with my boyfriend, and was stuffed a minute later. The steak was great!! It's the cowboy cut, or something along those lines. The steak flavor was very pronounced with minimal amounts of oil and spice on top. I'm eating the leftovers now and it's just as good.The server knew his stuff, an attentive and accommodating guy. Everything was well timed, not rushed. Cocktails were on the strong side, I thought, so why not. We were seated right away, which was nice as the hall was quickly packed! Had some business people really close to our table, so I felt like I was a part of their meeting, but no biggie. It would probably help to make the border between the downstairs bar and small dining area have a round top to deter people from putting down their drinks and facing the nearby table, because I could hear the men's conversations (they were not that interesting) better than my own date.Otherwise, the space was spacious, with very high ceilings and classic architecture, gorgeous city views.

5.0,4/20/2014,"Dining at Del Frisco's is not only having dinner, its having a fine dining experience. I read the reviews on Yelp prior to making my selection just to take a look at some of the reviews from the locals and travelers and taking a look at some of the pictures the've posted. I was thoroughly impressed. I made my reservations via Yelp through open table at 10:15pm. Del Frisco's is located in the theatre district about one block from Radio City music hall. The restaurant has two dinning floors. We arrived at about 10:05 and were seated about 10 minutes later. There waiting area was quite nice. A leather sofa that was beyond comfortable. The hostess came to are area and escorted us to our table. As we entered the second floor, the entire area faces Radio City music hall, a beautiful and colorful view. There is something about dining up high next to the window overlooking the city and the streets, people watching, the view of a New York City landmark it makes it a much more memorable experience . Our server was very kind, curtious and attentive to our needs the entire time, he knew the entire menu and recommend great dishes and pairings that would suit our needs. We were given a soft loaf of sesame bread with whipped butter. I ordered the Lobster Bisque, the misses and I wanted to share something filling and tasteful because she gets full fast. She also ordered a Pineapple Martini, according to her it was the best she ever had. The lobster bisque came in a stainless steel pot which was still steaming. The aroma, the smell made me grab the soup spoon before the pot was put down. The flavor and the taste of this bisque was second to none. My 29 years on this earth. Simply the best I've had. Rich flavor, you can taste the Lobster and Species on each spoonful. In addition, there were small chunks of lobster in the bisque. Simply orgasmic!!! The misses had a small filet I on the other hand was feeling hungry and went with a 14oz Veal Chop..  Both made medium. We also ordered Lobster Mack and Cheese to pair with our meal. The plates came steaming hot. Sizzling to be exact, Looking at the sheer size of my chop I was caught off guard. Very Very thick, They also left the bone which gave it great plate appeal. The veal was magnanimous, simply put. The taste leaves you salivating for another bite. Very tender and flavorful meat and just about no fat. Needless to say I downed the plate. In addition, the Lobster Mac and Cheese was superb as well. Great thick cheesy flavor with  chucks or lobster and broth inside that give it a rich, yet not overpowering flavor. I tried a piece of the misses filet and the flavor of the meat was just delicious and mouth watering. We capped the night with doppio expresso's and called it a day. My any means this is not a cheap meal. Easy over $200 for the both of us. However, I can tell you it was well worth it. It's not often we indulge ourselves with these types of luxuries. I can tell you if your in the city and want to break the wallet open for a amazing dining experience that you will remember for a long time.

5.0,4/20/2014,"Wow, after getting lost in the sprawling underground mall next to the Rockefeller center subway station, this place rocked! This was probably one of my favorite meals in NYC, ever.We had a party of 11 and I thought the circular table made it a lot more social. The waitress was not only nice but also very well versed about their menu and made sure that you understood exactly what you were ordering. I tried the following:1) Crabcake- $23 appetizer, split with my brother. Tasted great,but a bit pricey for a single crabcake, even by New York Standards.2) Hot tea- okay, threw this on here. My throat was bothering me a bit.. Standard..3) The VIP- a tasty vodka/pineapple concoction that apparently (i dozed off during the explanation) was sitting together for a while to make it just right. $17 and I thought it was worth it, had quite the kick!4) Filet Mignon Special- $61, for 3 different filet's with different sauces on top, 4 oz each.  DELICIOUS. You must try a steak here before you die.5) Sides- (family style) sweet potato casserole + spinach. No complaints here, portion size was just fine, as we split a couple of them.6) Chocolate Souffle- $16, this was probably my most pleasant surprise of the evening. The texture was soft, and with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top, the perfect end to a 2.5 hour eating experience.Overall: Highly recommended, but don't expect to spend less than $100 if you are going to eat a fair amount.

5.0,4/20/2014,"Came here for my brothers 40th bday and would rate this as perhaps the best steakhouse I have ever been too. Our 11 person group was seated pretty promptly, in a spacious main room with a circular table (much easier ot talk with everyone when its round). I started off with 1 crabcake (split with my brotheR), for $23 dollars wasnt the biggest but even half of it tasted just right with a great yellow sauce. The signature VIP cocktail was a great selection for me, it was a great blend  Svedka Clementine Vodka infused with fresh Hawaiian pineapple. For the main course I got a special 3 medallion filet mignon, each with a different sauce. The mushroom sauce was my favorite of the 3 choices! They also served family style sides, and the sweet potato casserole and spinach/bacon mix were amazing. For desert I had a chocolate souffle that quite simply ""hit the spot"" after an already well put together meal.The service was great, as our chatty waitress didn't miss a beat bringing out the food or making some great suggestions to the table. You can't skirt the fact that this is a pricey spot ($60 dollar entree) but you know what your gonna get here for the money, and its a great dining experience.

5.0,4/16/2014,"Del Frisco's has an upscale location very close to Times Square. It is in the shadows of the GE and Newscorp (Fox News) buildings. It is actually right next to Fox News Network and you can see their ""news"" ticker scrolling around their building from your table. If that is a good thing or not, you can decide. I've dined at Del Frisco's multiple times on the business account. This is the first time I've gone here on my own dime. That should tell you how much I like it.  I wanted to impress my partner after a show we attended on Broadway. We had 9:30 reservations and we had to wait about 10 minutes at the bar. I ordered a Cosmo at the bar and it was nearly $30 (Manhattan prices!). The bottom line is the food and service is excellent. The bread they serve is freshly baked and as fresh as could be. The New York strip was probably the best I've ever eaten. They seem to push the crab cakes a lot, but I have only tried the appetizer size. I am from Annapolis so I doubt other's could match our crab cakes!The wine list is the most extensive menu I've ever seen. It is overwhelming to me, but if you're into wines, this is absolutely the place for you!  I'll go back again one day, but hopefully when someone else is helping me pay.",0,1,0,Gary H.,"Annapolis, MD",753,324,1412

My girlfriend had the Filet Trio (which varies in preparation day-to-day, but is always a solid choice) and I had the Prime Strip. Both were cooked perfectly, and paired well with the Cabernet we were drinking. Then, after the main course, the waiter brought us the seven-layer lemon cake on the house -  an ideal end to the meal.

It's a 100% lemon layer cake with five very thin layers of lemon cream filing in between the lemon cake. Lemon frosting on the top and side. It is very moist, but surprisingly light. You can kind of just keep eating it and eating it. It is sweet, but the sweetest part is the frosting, so if I want it to be less sweet, avoid that (which is very easy to do). If frosting is removed, it's a great balance between tart and sweet.I will say that if you dislike lemon, you probably won't like this cake. If you are neutral towards, like, or love lemon, you will probably love this cake. It's not served with any sauces or whipped cream.It is particularly fantastic if eaten with a side of berries (strawberries go the best).Also, I'm not sure why it's not listed on their dessert menu.

5.0,2/9/2014,"This is not an inexpensive restaurant.  The food is ala carte, so be prepared to pay for everything.   But you will NOT be disappointed with either the food or the servers.  I came in alone, on my trip for Super Bowl XLVIII.   It was very late (12:30 a.m.), the hostess said they were full but I could sit at the bar to eat, which I did.  You need to be seated by 12:45 a.m. to get food from the kitchen.  First, the decor.  Terrific.  They spent some big money on the interior tenant improvements.  The railing going to the upper dining area was made of what appears to be real, old bridge cable.  All the metal work was fine and expensive.  Same for all the natural wood work, which included columns going all the way up to the ceiling and across the ceiling (which appeared to be about 20 feet high).  Dark wood, maybe Walnut.  It was dark in there, so I am not sure.   Wood everywhere.  A very warm atmosphere due to all that wood. My server was a bartender named Eric.  Larry also served me near the end of my stay.  Both were fantastic.  Very friendly, talkative, but not to the point of interfering with their other duties to other customers.    I would come back to this place just to get one of these guys to serve me.  No bull, they were that good.  ( I did not drink any alcohol, just Club Soda, so no, I was not intoxicated!)I ordered the NY Prime steak, a 16 ounce NY Strip.   Too much steak for me, but NY Strip is my favorite cut.  I had to leave a bit on the plate.  What a shame, because it was one of the best steaks I have ever tasted.  Cooked a little on the rare side for a ""medium rare"", but that is how they cook it here.  So if you don't want it to look raw, tell them when you order your steak.  First they brought out bread.  Looked pretty mundane, a large white oval shaped loaf with sesame seeds on top, like a big hamburger bun.  ""Ho hum"", I thought.  Until I ate some of it.  Wow, that bread is like nothing I have eaten.   Soft, and very tasty.  Usually I don't comment on the bread. I ordered a salad, it was a spinach salad, the name I don't recall, but it was great.  I also ordered a half dozen oysters on the half shell (oysters were from NY), and they were very, very fresh (I know my oysters, I eat a lot of them, mostly raw).   Even the croutons on the salad had a terrific texture and flavor I will never forget!  I have never commented on croutons on a salad until now.  There is another Del Frisco's in Manhattan.  It does not, however, serve food as late as the Double Eagle Steak House.",9,3,3,Mike P.,"Auburn, WA",0,22,4
4.0,2/8/2014,"Visited yesterday and seated at a table for 12 for a late Friday luncheon. Appetizers shared included the Crab Cakes which - again - were excellent.The Chilled Crab Claws which - again - were a disappointment. The Jumbo Shrimp (?) Cocktail worked - the sauce very flavorful.What was different with this visit was the 12oz  Filet Mignon. Requested Medium / Medium Rare -  the cut was perfect. The knife was barely needed as the meat couldn't be more tender. What an improvement. Sides included broccoli (very tasty), lobster macaroni & cheese (better than prior visit), chateau potatoes and onions which were very good as well. Desserts included a boring lemon cake, and an uninspired cheesecake.Unlike our prior visit service was professional, courteous and entertaining. The head waitress perfectly explained the specials. Very animated - she almost appeared to walk out of a Pixar movie with her delivery.Of Note: Table seating makes a difference when visiting Del Frisco's. Our visit in November resulted in an upstairs table in the back away from the gleaming 6th Avenue views. A bit cramped to say the least. Yesterday's downstairs central seating was perfect. Facing the floor to ceiling windows - a bright perfect backdrop to a fine meal. The bar area continues to be electric.",0,0,0,R. K.,"Valhalla, NY",14,484,1

Had to wait over an hour for my food. When I asked them about it, they said they were waiting to tell us until they had  a confirmed answer, but there were problems in the kitchen. I was a bit annoyed that they had to wait to tell us that when they told the table next to us. And they could've just brought our table some bread or appetizers and said that they were sorry for the delay. And then we saw a table next to us that came after us get their food... Asked them about our food again and ended up getting our food 30 mins after. Told them we never received our sides, and the server didn't even say he was going to go check on it and instead ran away and then came back with our sides, 10 mins later. Confused why he couldn't just say I'll go check on it... The staff could tell we were annoyed and provided us free drinks and dessert, which was nice.Overall food was yummy and worth waiting for, but the way they handled the situation wasn't so great.

We had reservations at 6:15 pm, checked in at 6:07 pm, and was seated at least 30 minutes after our reservation time. If we have reservations and our entire party is present, we shouldn't have to wait that long to get seated.  Besides that, our waiter (Liz -- ask for her, she's great! lots of great energy and attentive w/o being overbearing.), the view, and most importantly the food was AMAZING! We opted not to get appetizers, but we started off with drinks (1 gin martini, 1 pomegranate martini, and 2 Glenlivet 15). The martini's were perfect, the way drinks should be made. Perfectly mixed. We sat in a booth right by the stairs on the 6th avenue side. We were seated away from the very tall windows, but I think it made it better.

Everything!Bacon-Wrapped Sea Scallops - Super tender and tasty, but a bit salty for my taste. It tasted so good I didn't bother sending it back. If you eat the spinach, couscous, and the scallops together, the taste is much more balanced. **They might have slightly different definitions of what rare, medium-rare, medium, medium-well, and well done are compared to what you may be used to. They will describe it and will be cooked exactly how they describe it!Prime Strip 16 oz. - So much flavor, so perfectly cooked. Even the little bit of fat that is left on the edges are cooked to a point where it nicely melts in your mouth (and I'm not the type of person who typically likes to eat the fatty parts of steak)Filet Mignon 12 oz. - Super tender, tasty, and lean. It's not as flavorful as the strip, but that's what is expected for this cut of meat. That's all you really need to know.Fresh Vegetable (Broccoli - I think it changes depending on what's in season - don't take my word for it though) - It's simple, it tastes good, but a bit ridiculous for $16. If you want just fresh vegetables, that is what you'll get, but I would suggest you getting something else... that takes more effort to make that makes the money more worth it.Lobster Macaroni & Cheese - Good mac&cheese. It's the good stuff, not the bright orange, fake cheese stuff, obviously. The only negative thing I would say about this is that there wasn't much lobster in it.Lemon Cake - Just get it. The flavors are very balanced. Not too lemony, not too sweet, very moist... just delicious. I love lemon cakes and my boyfriend doesn't really care for lemon or cakes. He devoured this cake.

We shared a crab cake for appetizer since we never had one before and it was highly recommended by our waiter.  I don't even like seafood like that and that crab cake made me a fan!  It was the most delicious crab cake ever and the sauce that it came with was so tasty.  For our meal I ordered the filet mignon medium well along with the potatoes au gratin and he ordered the tomahawk steak with sweet potato casserole.  Just thinking about our dinner is making my mouth water.  As the waiter brought out our steaks he asked us to cut it in half to make sure that it was cooked to our liking and we wanted it cooked a little more so they brought it back to the kitchen and cooked it a little longer.  In the meantime, our waiter served us our sides while we waited and they were just so yummy.  The sweet potato casserole was the best I ever had!! They brought back our steaks and with the first bite a tear came to my eye because I just had a bite of the best steak of my life!  This is hands down the best steakhouse we have EVER been to in our 30 years of life!  The prices were a bit expensive but I honestly didn't even care because it was worth every penny.  Everyone needs to experience a restaurant like this at least once in their lives.  If it sounds like the night couldn't get any better... it does!  After we ate dinner and packed a doggy bag to go, the waiter brought out a huge slice of lemon cake for dessert and it came with a candle for his birthday.  This was a perfect way to end the night and OH..MY..GOODNESS.. this was the best piece of lemon cake I EVER had!!  When I took the first bite, all I could say was damn..damn..DAMN!!!!  This place could do no wrong in my eyes.  It was a wonderful experience and I recommend this place to anyone who loves food and fine dining.  I look forward to the next time I can go back!  Thank you Del Frisco's for making that night one we will remember forever!",0,0,0,Orreyo B.,"North Brunswick Township, NJ",1,14,3

5.0,12/28/2013,"Great service. You can tell that the staff is very well trained. Our waitress was knowledgeable about the menu and was able to recite an extensive offering of specials without a stutter. Moreover, she and the bus staff were very attentive. There were always staff members circulating, so it was easy to have my glass refilled or a grievance addressed.For appetizer, we shared the crab cake, tuna tartar, and steak tartar. The crab cake was the most expensive and the most delicious one I've ever had. It was placed on a light and delicate sauce which added a hint of creaminess to the dish yet permitted the crab meat to stand out. The tuna tartar was as good as I've had. It was topped with a tasty and fresh herb which complimented the fish well; it was also served with toast topped with blended olives as well as a thin pepper slice. The steak tartar was an unordinary dish. It had a texture of a pate and was glazed by a mustard sauce. Of the appetizers I tried, I recommend them in the order: crab cake, tuna tartar, and steak tartar.For dinner, I was recommended the Prime Porterhouse. It was outstanding. It was perfectly cooked to a medium rare. That exterior was well seasoned and had a very appeasing char. I'm at a loss for words to describe how well the fat was join to the meat. Despite my inability to appropriately describe this great cut, I can assure you that this resulted in a tender and marvelously soft piece of meat. The porterhouse must have been broiled or quickly refinished in it's fat dripping, oil, or butter to yield such soft bites. We also split the Lobster Macaroni and Cheese, but it did not set of my taste buds to the same degree to which the porterhouse did. Again my diction is at a shortfall, but the steak aroused a sense of fatty that was delicious yet not greasy or overwhelming. If you appreciate steaks, then I think you'll be more than content with Del Frisco's Prime Porterhouse cooked to medium rare.",0,0,0,Joseph T.,"Merrick, NY",98,1667,40

The wine list is monsterous in size and the selections were impressive, though the pairings recommended by the resident sommelier were subpar. The appetizers were of high caliber. Do try the crab cake. However, the filet mignon was a failure. An order of a medium yielded a tasteless overdone piece of meat. To add to their accumulating shortfalls, the tables were too narrowly spaced - my experience was just a numbing barrage of jolts to my chair.

5.0,12/17/2013,"YUM. Service here is top notch for real. I think if I asked, they would have hand fed me...although pretty sure my BF's boss would think I was a weirdo.We started with 3 portion size shellfish plateaus. It came with oysters, shrimp cocktail, crab legs and stone crabs. The stone crabs were SO meaty. I only had one leg and I think it had as much crab as the crab cake. Speaking of the crab cake...this is not a cake but a pile of crab meat...just how I like my crab cakes. It literally has a bit of filling to keep it from falling apart.To eat, I had the 8oz filet medium rare. The crust was salty and the meat just melted in my mouth - very little chewing required. We also had the mashed potatoes, lobster mac and cheese, creamed spinach, steamed broccoli and baked potato as sides. The creamed spinach and mashed potatoes were my favorite! The spinach has bits of bacon in it and the mash had sprigs of green onions. Everything was so great together!To finish, I had the lemon layer cake that was a special of the day. The icing on the outside was slightly too sweet for me but the filling between the layers of cake with the moist cake was TDF. If you are a lemon person, def get this dessert, it will not disappoint! Easily one of my favorite meals in the city! Word of warning, it does get INCREDIBLY packed so I would suggest making a reservation on the early side.P.S. we also had a corner window seat and the view of the holiday decorations and lights on 6th definitely elevated my dining experience!P.P.S. only blocks away from the xmas tree in Rockefeller center!",2,0,0,Diana S.,"Manhattan, NY",290,448,282

They seated us in a quiet area in the back corner of the 2nd fl next to the window facing Ave of Americas, which allowed us to not worry about filtering our conversations while also not having to strain to hear one another as the rest of restaurant itself was packed and the volume level was fairly high.The food was too notch, crab cakes, shrimp 3-ways, and tomato & onion for starters. For our entrees we all went for the bone-in ribeye special which was perfect along with chateau potatoes, asparagus, lobster mac & cheese and (my fav) Maque Choux Corn for sides. I honestly can't remember the wine that we had but it was a solid, bold red. After all of that we were pretty much stuffed but I managed to make room for a creme brûlée and a latter for dessert.

You're gonna spend money here. Like $60-$100 per person, and that's still sans tip.I've also had the salmon. Sadly, it's not as consistently good as the steak. Sometimes, it's cooked perfectly, sometimes, it's been overcooked. It's tricky to cook salmon, and if it is overcooked by mere seconds, it's garbage.Try the lemon cake for dessert. It's a layered cake, smothered with buttery goodness in between. The cheesecake is also one of the best I've tasted in New York. Not sure if it's made in house or bought elsewhere, but it competes with Junior's in terms of awesomeness.This place is quiet just after the lunch hours, and insanely busy after work. The ambiance is cool, dark and lively. A lot of investment bankers take their clients here to wine and dine them, so a lot of men in suits after working hours.It's also a great place to go to pre and post theatre, as it is a block away from the theatre district.

I had the scallops (without the bacon, I'm a pescetarian), and at $40 for the plate, I was seriously unimpressed. Don't get me wrong, they were cooked to perfection. Fully cooked, but cut like butter. And the accompanying spinach and couscous was the right idea. But oh my goodness, my mouth still hurts from the salt. They must have been covered in salt crystals before searing, because while I didn't see any salt, that's all I tasted. And the sauce on the plate - I couldn't even remember what it was supposed to be, because it only tasted like salt. I hoped to have some side vegetables to offset the salt burning my mouth, but lo! The asparagus were coated in more salt! Food does not need epic proportions of salt to taste good. In fact, food tends to taste incredible when left to its own devices and cooked well. Other issues from tonight included an awkward table near the kitchen which had waiters walking by me a little too closely all evening; red wine bottles dripping all over the table on being poured; extremely slow service until someone got wind that we were sitting with a VIP; and a tiny ladies room in which no less than ten people were patiently waiting for their turn.

While I really liked the food, I didn't really enjoy other aspects of the place: staff, atmosphere, price, etc.  The staff seem to be less polished.  They do not have the look or the service mentality that you would expect from $100pp type of place.  But they do get their job done.    The atmosphere is very business like.  I wouldn't go here for a special dinner.  It is not romantic.  The place is huge and tons of business people are standing, drinking and chatting at the bar.  It gets loud and you have to speak louder.  Also due to the size and layout, there are patrons, servers, hosts, and other people constantly walking by your table.  If you want some peaceful dinner, request the back sections of the dining rooms.     Yes it is pricey.  I wouldn't mind the price as the food is good but you pay extra for the whole experience which I didn't feel like this place offered.No doubt it's a great place for business lunches and dinners.  Go if your boss is paying for the meal.",0,0,0,Cooper Y.,"Morristown, NJ",8,142,92

5.0,9/11/2013,"Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse can put one damn satisfying piece of meat on your plate, and that's really all you need to know.The steakhouses in NYC (at least the ones that dare to publicize that they're an actual steak house) all do a pretty good job with the steaks. Sure, some are cooked imperfectly and some are over-seasoned, but they all deliver great dining experiences. Del Frisco might just sit a tad above the rest nonetheless.Whether it's the bone-in rib-eye, the regular rib-eye, the filet mignon or the strip steak, you'll find that the meat is cooked very much to your liking, and seasoned just right. The juices ooze into your mouth with every bite, and I would give anything if I could come here with the appetite I had in my teens. The sides are very good as well, and I'll specifically call out the cauliflower & brie au gratin dish. It serves as a great balance to the steak. Lamb at steakhouses generally won't be as good as what you might get at, say, an Italian or French specialty restaurant, so don't worry about missing out on the lamb at Del Frisco. Go for that magnificent cow, and nothing else. Well, maybe that lemon cake too if they have it.Lastly, try the cocktails. Even if the steak is debatable among steak enthusiasts in NYC, I can say with confidence that their cocktails are the best of any steakhouse in the city. Ever follow a bite of juicy rib-eye with a sip of Manhattan Dry? If not, I am so excited for you to do that for the first time.",4,0,0,Pat P.,"St John's Wood, London, United Kingdom",174,338,0

5.0,9/8/2013,"This place is in the corner of several different high-end steak houses and seafood restaurants by the Rockefeller Center.I started off with the crab cakes special appetizer ($22), which were cooked to perfection and the sauce drizzled around it was supremely good! I had only ever tried crab cakes from the Chesapeake which are hard to beat, but these tasted fresh and tender.For the entree, I had to try their Filet Mignon, 8 ounce steak ($43, $49 for 12 oz.) - this was delicious. I had mine cooked well done, it was pink enough for it to not be dry but cooked just how I like it. Full of flavor and just enough juice. It came in two pieces, and I assume that is because it is cooked easier that way for it to be thoroughly well done.Their cocktail and bar menu are also worth trying. I ordered the ""A Breath of Fresh Pear"" ($18), consisting of Grey Goose Le Poire Vodka, Cointreau, white cranberry juice and fresh lime juice, definitely a winner. I have also had their ""Old Fashioned"" ($17) which is made of Knob Creek Bourbon, muddled cherry, orange and sugar & bitters and it was also pretty good and quite strong!Their wine selection is extensive and impressive with wines from all over the world. To accompany my steak I ordered the Pinot Noir PPP wine ($15/glass) and that sat very nicely with the steak.For dessert I had their creme brulee made with Belgian white chocolate and cinnamon with a raspberry on top, flamed nicely.Overall, I would absolutely recommend this place for anyone looking for a lovely steak house in NYC to try. The ambiance is very lovely, beautiful staircases leading to additional seating upstairs. It is beautifully decorated, very classic and sophisticated interior decor with dim lighting and not too noisy. There are ceiling to floor glass windows that overlook the theater districts, beautiful views of the lights and activity. The waiters and bartenders are all super knowledgeable and enthusiastic with recommendations and suggestions.

Suits and ties all over the place but thats New York for ya I guess. They sat us in the back room away from all the commotion which I first thought was based on our attire but then later appreciated the gesture to let us eat in a quiet environment. Our waitress knew her stuff. From a list of daily specials to restaurant favorites, she had it all down. She was also from San Jose which gives her her an extra point in my book. The entire staff was on point with their responsibilities, a very underrated part of the restaurant business nowadays. The three of us ordered the crab cake in cajun sauce, Longhorn Ribeye, lobster mac and cheese, and garlic broccoli. Everything was AMAZING. The crab cake is not the normal battered type you get but actually FULL of crab meat. Dipped in the sauce.. oh man it was game over. Every bite was just wow, simply wow. The broccoli was nothing special and would be the only thing I would substitute if I were to go back again. The lobster mac and cheese was cooked to perfection. Light crispy cheese layer on top of the delicious lobster mac and cheese totally hit the spot. Finally, the ribeye. We ordered it medium rare and it was cooked closer to medium but perfect in my book. Ribeye being my favorite cut, this was like tasting heaven in my mouth. Juicy and full of flavor. Not the best steak Ive ever had but the overall dining experience and great food deserves a solid 4.5-5 stars.Oh the only thing I MIGHT complain about is the bread.

First off the waitress we had was exceptional and went out her way to making our anniversary dinner something to remember by starting us off with champagne on the house. She also went out of her way to list several areas we should consider checking out during our stay at New York. The food here was phenomenal. My wife and I decided to share the Wagyu Longbone, which is pricey, but well worth it. The steak was cooked to perfection. You would think there was more than just salt, pepper and butter as part of the seasoning of the steak based on the way it tasted. Along with our steak we also placed an order for the Lobster Macaroni & Cheese which my wife and I always have been big fans of. We couldn't have picked such a better tasting side dish to have with our steak. The Lobster Macaroni & Cheese was excellent tasting. We didn't want to leave New York without tasting a New York cheesecake so I we placed an order for the Strawberry cheesecake as part of our desert and we both agreed we have never tasted a better cheesecake in our lifetime.

This is your typical business lunch venue, and it becomes pretty packed, especially being around Midtown, so definitely come early!Good thing this meal wasn't coming out of my wallet because the group I was with picked that day to dine like kings and queens (including ordering a ribeye to go to bring back to a co-worker who couldn't make it to the lunch). I got the filet mignon sampler, which included three 4-oz filet medallions each paired with different sauces. While the meats themselves were super moist and cooked to medium rare perfection, the sauces didn't stand out (and hence why I can't list them out because I forgot what they were...) although I do remember one of them being foie gras.

Knowing it was our first time dinning there, he took the time to explain and give us a background on some of the dishes. He also made some excellent recommendations that we ended up loving.We started with their ""famous"" crab cakes. After one bite, I was able to understand the hype behind them. They were amazing. Lightly breaded and served atop a delicious lobster sauce.Following the crab cakes we each enjoyed an entree. I had the salmon, and my friend had the 8 oz filet mignon. The salmon was excellent.

3.0,8/3/2013,"When I go to a steakhouse I go for steak, after all, isn't that what it is all about.  I had heard many good things about Del Frisco's from all over, just as in many of the Yelp reviews.  Here is the rub though on the steak...wet aging and no char makes for a gummy soft steak.  I personally prefer a crusty char on my steak and a deeper flavor brought on with only dry aging.  Many with a less refined appreciation for steak will likely find the wet aged prime meat to their liking, but for the steak connoisseur I would suggest looking elsewhere and check the steak aging and cooking reviews before heading out.  Atmosphere is a bit noisy and a bit touristy of a crowd given the location.  The service staff I will say was impeccable.  Onion tower was fun.",1,0,0,Andrew W.,"New York, NY",4,65,0

5.0,7/28/2013,"Phenomenal steak house.  I believe it's rated No.5 on the top 12 NY steak houses by Zagat.  It's also a very well presented modern steak house.  They have a coat check so be sure to check your coat and tip the girl working it. There is a bar upstairs, which is where the bathrooms are located.  Ask about their specials which are not on the menu. I had the porterhouse and it was by far the best I've ever had...and I've traveled everywhere. I also ordered the onion rings which I had no idea that they would be a TOWER of the biggest onion rings ever.  So if you do order them, order them as an appetizer.  This place will not run you cheap...so be prepared to spend at least $80 and that's without ordering drinks and a tip. But if your company is paying for it....go all out. The dress code here is casual.  I mean look presentable walking in but it's not a coat and tie place. You'll see everyone from the typical tourist family to the business men of NYC.  The staff is very friendly and VERY professional.  They are courteous to everyone. Del Frisco's may look like a ultra modern and upscale steak house (which it is) but do not be afraid to take your entire family there. You will not be treated any different from the high paying customer.  FIVE STARS for sure.",1,0,0,Patrick B.,"Baltimore, MD",48,218,609

5.0,7/21/2013,"Fabulous execution in an exciting, entirely American atmosphere where people have fun.Extensive wines. Had a 2005 Moffett Cab from Napa and didn't really disappoint.Apps:1. Low carb but high butter crab cakes were everything they should have been. Lobster sauce underpinning the cake was like the glue to replace the gluten. So much crab!2. Caesar salad was very normal. 3. Shrimp remoulade (3 kinds, the garlic oil was the most delicious)Mains:4. Prime Ribeye (indeed very tender and feels lean) 5. Prime Fillet Mignon (a beautifully tender cut perfectly medium rare. Seriously perfect)6. Sea Bass with heirloom tomatoes and watermelon with arugula (my aunt said the excess vinegar in the watermelon made them taste spicy--a bit too acidic. The fish was a little bit too done but had some nice sugar on it--probably not a good call to order fish at a steakhouse)Sides:7. Creamed Spinach (whelp! so good but so artery clogging, overkill?)8. Cauliflower au brie gratin (perhaps the best side?--so creamy that your other sides should be grilled or fresh probably. If you do pasta, red sauce instead of cheesy/creamy would do you well)9.

Once you get to the heavy hitters (Peter Lugers, Bobby Vans, Ruths Chris,etc etc) youre really splitting hairs in terms of quality cut,etc. But I have been here three times and it neverrr has been anything short of perfect.What to get: Appetizer: flourless crab cake (EPIC; its just crab meat held together with an ounce of breading in a bowl of lobster bisque -- a must have!)Entree: they have pretty much every cut (the filet, strip, porter, etc etc) - over the years my palettes changed with steaks and I realized if you want the most flavorful chop you want the bone in ribeye (medium rare of course).  I feel like every high end steakhouse has great dry aged cuts but the way del friscos prepares it, its what makes it so amazing -- almost a millimeter thick crust of pepper and a little kosher salt. - its honestly life changing lolSide dishes : Creamed spinach (4 parts cream/butter and 1 part spinach --  and im sold!), lobster mac and cheese ( a nice sharp cheddar and good chunks of lobster meat)Again to reiterate, best steakhouse ever (in my humble opinion)..... excellent/attentive service (well of course you're paying top dollar for it) btw you'll be paying about a 100/person, but my goodness its worth it.",1,0,0,Stanley S.,"Floral Park, NY",2,12,0

3.0,7/2/2013,"I really wish I could give this place a bit of a higher rating, especially since my friends loved this place. I came here for a friend's birthday dinner. We were just a small party of 4 and got seated at the booth, which was awesome. The service was also really good, no complaints there.Compared to other steakhouses that I've been to, I just can't give a higher rating due to the food.Giving credit where it's due however, the crab cakes were phenomenal. Our waiter said that if we didn't like it, he'd pay for the crab cakes....well...we liked it. It was stellar. The shanghai style calamari was good too - the sauce had a nice asian zest to it and was tangy. Cream of spinach was also great here. We devoured that side dish. The bread was also bomb. It was nice and fluffy on the inside.Now onto the stuff that I didn't like. I decided to be adventurous and got the foie gras sampler which was 3 4oz pieces of filet minon, each with a different topping. Toppings were oscar style (except with hollaindaise instead of bernaise), foie gras, and mushroom with red wine reduction (believe the mushroom was shiitake). So I asked for it medium rare and unfortunately the middle piece of my steak trio (the one I decided to cut first to check) was not medium rare. In hindsight I should have cut one of the other pieces to compare because the other two were medium rare, but I think I'm not crazy when I say that I didn't want the heat to be released from the other two pieces should they have been medium rare. The waiter did keep asking me if I was okay with the piece which I appreciated. So cooking consistency aside, I dug in to the mushroom topping filet. The sauce was a bit too salty and combined with the mushrooms masked the flavor of the steak a bit more than I would have liked. Similarly with the oscar style steak, the hollaindaise was a bit overpowering. The foie gras piece was perfect and what I would have liked to have eaten for all three pieces if I could go back in time.As for the sides, I am a huge fan of onion rings but was a bit dissapointed at the ones we got. I think it could use a bit more seasoning because I felt like I was eating fried batter and onion. Cream of corn was pretty decent.Lastly, and this is a bit nitpicky, but the manhattan that I got was not as strong as they make it at other places (like the bar in the four seasons in midtown). My other friends agreed.I guess this place is good for corporate outings as they are known for in the area, but if you want a nice steak dinner with friends, there are better locations in my opinon such as lugers, club a, prime, etc.",0,0,0,Harry L.,"Theater District, Manhattan, NY",291,132,96

5.0,7/1/2013,"I came here with my co workers during lunch time. We made reservations for 12:30 PM. It was very upscale as you would expect being in mid-town Manhattan around major tourist and business areas such as Radio City Music Hall and News Corp Building just to name a few. Service: The waitress was very friendly and offered great recommendations. She also gave a little background on a few dishes and very personable. It was nice to have a conversation with the waitress for once. They went above and beyond in my opinion, they were very attentive to our needs and tried to make sure we were able to make it back to work without having to stay too long. Since we had multiple sides, they got a team of waiters and waitress to serve all of us individually so we don't have to waste time passing around each sides (We had a party of 9).Food: I had the crab cake as an appetizer and it was amazing. This place is not one of those places where they serve the crab cake with a lot of breaded stuffing. This was legit packed with crab meat and the plate contained spicy mayo type of sauce to have a kick with your crab cake. I ordered the boned ribeye steak special of the day after the waitress recommended to me. It was a huge steak! I believe it was 18 or 19 oz. I can't believe I finished it, my co workers were shocked too. The sides we ordered are: Creamy Spinach cheese (with bacon bits in it), Lobster Marconi and cheese, corn and bacon bits, sweet potatoes, and some other side I forgot what was the name.Dessert: My co workers got the lemon cake (They are most famous for this). The portion is huge! One slice can probably be shared amongst 3 to 4 people easily. My other co worker ordered the chocolate mouse sorbet or some sorts. She said it is delicious but can't finish because it was too much.Price: I'm going to be honest, this place will cost you an arm and a leg. I suggest this place for like special occasions or one time thing and not an everyday lunch spot. I was lucky that it was a counseling team celebration thing and my firm paid for it.

They really are deliciously meaty, and I love that they are so light due to being baked rather than fried. And that sesame semolina bread to dip in the sauce. So good!Everyone's steak was cooked exactly to order. This time I went with a porterhouse. Beautiful marbleized fat, with just the right amount of salt and pepper in the crust.  In addition, I finished off my wife's bone-in filet, and that last few bites along the bone--so much added flavor!I'd really love to know how they get the brown sugar in the mashed sweet potatoes to have that wonderful texture. I imagine them coating each order with a layer of brown sugar and either finishing it in the broiler or with some kind of blow torch then mixing it in before serving. It's just heavenly. Once again, the service was friendly, attentive and spot on. I even had a nice conversation with Peter, my waiter from my prior visit, who recognized me and couldn't have been any friendlier. The meal was paced a little bit slowly, as one of our dining partners requested.  No aspect was rushed. Water and wine glasses were refilled promptly, and no one waited long for a fresh cocktail. They attempted to give us 2 crummy tables, but we weren't having it.  We only waited a few minutes before a nicer spot opened up. I'm not sure why they even have tables in the lower back (closet) where they attempted to seat us. That area would be best served for a private business conference...but I digress...They have their act together. All aspects of food, and service are spot on.

5.0,5/21/2013,"Man! All I have to say about Del Frisco's is that it is hands-down one of the best steak houses I've ever been to. Everything is delicious, but my personal preferences are the Prime Porter House with a side of Lobster Mac & Cheese and Spinach Supreme. Top it all off with a Macallan 12/18 and you're good to go. The ambiance and vibe is wonderful -- a very contemporary look with large windows and a great view right in the heart of Midtown NYC. I also like how it's more lively compared to the typical stodgy, quiet-ish setting at other steak houses. I'm originally from the Bay Area where Alexander's Steakhouse was my personal favorite but I think Del Frisco's is slowly taking over :) Overall, a great place to bring friends, family, and colleagues.

So much to the point that I know that wherever he picks, I know that I have to spend $$$ wherever we go. Not that I'm a cheap ass, but I don't really eat $100 meals often.But, I will say that the double eagle cut was a big enough portion for me and my boyfriend. I was super full off of just a half of it. The sides are amazing as well. They're served a la carte, so its best to share them with everyone. There was about 3 of us and we all shared the lobster mac and cheese as well as the creamed spinach that had bacon in it that everyone here raves about. I will say that the food just melted in your mouth type good. I would say the steak was on par with my kobe beef experience in Osaka, Japan. Yep. I said it.The desert was just as amazing and big. We all shared the chocolate 6 layer cake special they had and it was more than enough for all of us. I will say that this place is a good special occasion once and a while type place, but don't expect to spend anything under $100 here if you want to actually feel ful.

5.0,5/17/2013,"One of the best steaks I've ever eaten!Overall, this was a hell of an experience.  We all went with the bone-in ribeye (off the menu $65). Sides were creamed spinach with bacon, and au gratin potatoes.  Some oyster to start.  And for finishers, the molten chocolate cake, with vanilla ice cream and raspberry puree, the 7 layer chocolate cake, and an ice cream sunday, (also off menu, but Spencer was able to have one put together. The Steak... bone in ribeye, mid rare, it had the tenderness of a filet with the marbleization and good fat content of a a rib eye.  One of the best cuts of meat I have ever had the pleasure of eating.  I would say I have had none better, some equally good or at least on par, but none better.  For example, Sparks NY strip, equally good, but a different beast altogether. Atmosphere, much better than your typical steak house.,Service, unparalleled.  Spencer was awesome.  when it came time to clear the table after the main course, 6 servers showed up and cleared  and crumbed it in no time. We were on the fence about the molten cake and the 7 layer, we went with the molten, our waiter brought out the 7 layer anyway, on the house, bc he knew we were torn between the two, and wanted us to be able to try em both...  Everything about this place was on point, and the difference really is in the details.Cons, it is probably the priciest of all the top notch places in the city, i.e, Lugers, Sparks, Keens, Wolfgangs, Strip House, in no particular order.",0,0,0,Bryan F.,"Brooklyn, NY",80,172,70

So, why the 4 stars you might ask? Well...The appetizers. Wham-Effing-O. We went with the calamari - Shanghai style. While there was nothing Shanghai about it, the spicy sauce along with the fried jalapenos just blew me away. Full of flavors. We also ordered raw Oysters (even though I am allergic), and it was fresh as it can be. * a bit overpriced* side dishes: skip the broccoli and mushroom - $18 each? cmon. * drinks.

I loved all the sides, but could do without the gnocchi. It just wasn't amazing to me. Somehow we found room for dessert. He had the bread pudding and I had the creme brulee. The creme brulee was amazing. It was so good that i literally ate as much as I could, without exploding. The boyfriend and I rolled out the door, but left feeling so full that we could barely make it home. So maybe we both didn't have to order a desert, but it was so good, we really couldn't say no.

So damn good!  Well there were definitely several industry no no's that this server acted on through out the night but this isnt a negative review.  In fact, on my way out after paying the bill, I thought to myself that I wouldn't be able to sleep without just letting a manager know.  So I did just that as a heads in case other fine diners might fall victim of this server's poor service or discrimination... And wow - the attention I got.  I guess this is as good as it gets as far as hospitality goes because Chriss the manager really took care of things.  Extremely apologetic and discounted my check at a very generous amount.  He provided me his contact info assuring that I will be treated well on my next visit.  He's sure to see me back very soon!!!  A+++ to a kick ass manager and knowing exactly what to do at the right time.

4.0,3/21/2013,"Came here on a Friday night.  The place was packed but it is huge.  We were seated right away and there was free coat check in.  Right off the bat you can tell this place is for bankers and the like.  The interior is probably the best I've seen for a steakhouse so far.  The ceilings are very high and there is a second floor with private party rooms.  The walls are all glass which gives a nice view and a upscale feel.  We also had great seats right between the bar and dining area.Our waiter was really nice and attentive.  I forgot the name of the glass of champagne I ordered but it tasted great.  I usually get the slab bacon when I'm at a steakhouse but Del Frisco's does not have it on their menu which is kind of cool because it shows they are not copycats.  So I skipped the appetizers because every other appetizer on the menu is expensive and ordered a 32 oz. Wagyu ""long bone"" to share with my date which cost $94.  It was cooked perfectly medium rare and they also ask you if it was cooked the way you wanted which really deserves some credit because most places will not care and try to ignore the fact they over/under cooked your expensive steak.  It was flavorful and juicy but definitely did not taste like Wagyu and the regular ribeye would of probably tasted the same at a much lower price.  I take the blame for it though because it was my fault for ordering something I know that would not taste like the real thing.  I'm pretty sure if I ordered a different cut, I would definitely be satisfied.  I also ordered the Spinach Supreme which is basically creamed spinach with bacon bits and Potato Au Gratin which is mashed potatoes.  The sides are a lot more expensive than other steakhouses which I would have no problem with if they were worth the extra cost but they weren't.  The spinach started off great but got sickening fast because it was to heavy on the cream and not minced enough and the mashed potatoes were just regular, nothing special.  For desert we ordered the Lava Cake with a scoop of ice cream.  The cake was fresh and hot so the warmth of the cake with ice cream together was one of the best bites of desert I've had.  In all, its a great place that treats and serves every customer the same which is very rare for steakhouse in Midtown.  The steaks are definitely on par with the best in NYC and worth the money your willing to shell out.  I would definitely come back.",0,0,0,Phuong P.,"Pennsauken Township, NJ",28,124,0

I had a bone in filet mignon and it was far and away the best steak I have ever ever had. My daughter also had filet mignon (medium rare or ""bloody"" as she like to call it).....best ever. And what was truly amazing was that the service matched the quality of the food.

5.0,3/15/2013,"Since we couldn't get into Peter Luger's early Sunday night, this was our second choice for steak. At first, upon hearing about it, I thought it would be a very fancy, stuffy place.  Well, it is still fancy, but in a more laid back way.  Upon entering the restaurant, you are greeted by the hostess and got our coats checked for free.  With a reservation, we didn't have to wait at all for our table.  I loved the staircase that led to the second floor.  However, upon seating at the table, which was a 5-person oddly-shaped booth and it was just only two of us, we felt like it was too awkward for us to sit.  No problem, the waiter talked to the hostess and got another table for us promptly.  From our new table, we had a much better view and can see the Radio City neon sign.After we got seated at the new table, menus were presented to us.  I really need to see their wine storage some day because that wine list was a tome.  After looking at the wine list for a while, we finally settled on a 2006 shiraz from Australia for $85 a bottle.  The wine came as a twist-off, so at first we were skeptical.  At first sip, the wine was neither bold nor flavorful, but as we let it breathe, it turned out to be quite spectacular.  Knowing we were going to be gorging on a slab of meat in the near future, we opted out of appetizers.  The free bread was good but nothing special. We ordered Del's salad with blue cheese dressing.  Truly, the dressing was out of this world.  It was creamy yet not too thick, the blue cheese not overwhelming.  For the main course, we decided to split a double eagle 26oz strip medium rare, and we were not disappointed.   It was perfectly medium-rare pink, with the crusty bits adding a lot of flavor to the steak.  Tried the steak with the shiraz wine, and I was in heaven.  As for the side, we got the au gratin potatoes.  It was pretty good, but not as spectacular as the steak.  To end the meal, we ordered the lemon cake.  It was pretty good, but again nothing mind-blowing.All in all, the meal came out to about $250 with tax and tip.  Was it worth it? Most definitely.  I have no qualms to recommend this place to those looking for a good steakhouse in NYC.",0,1,0,Kris J.,"Millbrae, CA",2,13,1

I had the bone in filet mignon which was one of the specials.It was very good. I did order it medium rare so my only compaint would be that it came out rare. The edges were medium rare but the center and anywhere near the bone was completely uncooked.... flat out raw.  It still tasted great but I am not a big fan of completely uncooked meat.

Everything else is mediocre.We also had the chance to take advantage of the bar our last visit and it was a good time. Bar staff and attendants were friendly and attentive.

3.0,1/29/2013,"- The crab cakes are the best thing on the menu.- The steak is fine. Just fine. The wagyu ""longbone"" is also fine. Bringing out a big bone is flashy, but doesn't actually enhance the taste. I'd go with the prime strip, although the seasoning overpowers the quality of the meat.- The ambiance is loud, ostentatious, and obnoxious - if you've ever wanted to crash a holiday party for, I don't know, junior bankers at Citi - congratulations, you've found your in.- The tuna tartare is great.- The chateau potatoes are legitimately awful. Take Miss Vickies (which are great of their own accord...), add wet, poorly-grilled onions and what I think was cheese, and enjoy questioning whether or not you actually meant to order what you ordered.- The lobster mac n cheese is delicious, because it's lobster mac n cheese, and it is actually effectively impossible to ruin lobster mac n cheese unless the lobster is, in fact, a live pigeon.- The creme brulee is fine.- The chocolate souffle cake is from Chili's. This is not an insult. It's very rich, it's pretty generic, and it's a solid choice.If you want a better steak, go to Peter Luger, Saxon + Parole, Blue Ribbon, or even STK (West Village) or Abe and Arthur's.If you want better ambiance, bring earplugs, sunglasses, and some kind of chemical compound that can be applied topically over your nostrils to combat Davidoff's Cool Water.",0,3,0,Holden B.,"Atlanta, GA",5,29,0

After waiting another 10minutes in the bar area, she grabbed us and seated us abruptly. Our waitress was amazing. Very friendly and outgoing. We started with the crab cake appetizer which was incredible! My girlfriend ordered the scallops with lobster mac and cheese for a side. Her entree came with just 6 scallops drizzled with some balsamic. No rice nothing. For 50 plus dollars I'd expect a little more than just that. However, she did enjoy them. I ordered the 100.00 wagyu long bone steak with onion rings. The onion rings were okay they give you a ton but nothing to dip them in. The steak came out very dark and the plate was scorching hot. My steak continued to cook on the scorching hot plate which made me medium rare steak more of a medium. The rub on the steak itself was very very salty. If I'm going to pay 100.00 for a steak it better be damn good and cooked to perfection. Sadly, it wasn't even close. Luckily, since it was such a good cut of meat, it was still tender and flavorful but very very salty. After being disappointed with both our entrees we decided to skip dessert.

We made reservations for 9 pm on Saturday night and the place was packed! It was really loud and the staff was constantly hustling and bustling which is usually a complaint by reviewers...but isn't that what NYC is known for? I love busy atmospheres so I actually enjoyed it. We were seated right away and even though we dinned for a while, we never felt rushed. We got excellent recommendations by our waitress and we ended up ordering the crab cake appetizer which was to die for. One of my friend's got the Prime Strip which he says was good, but not great. I had a taste of my friend's filet mignon which was delicious. Super tender and yummy. I was not in the mood for steak (yeah I know it was a steak house, but it was just one of those nights so don't judge me) and I ended up ordering the Shrimp Scampi which was very light but super flavorful. The sides were fabulous. We got the Potato Au Gratin and the Lobster Mac n' Cheese and I loved both of them especially the Mac n' Cheese! Finally we ended with a Creme Brulee which was decent.I really enjoyed my time at Del Frisco's despite the Hurricane. Their food is flavorful, the location is great, the ambiance is fun and the service is amazing. The reason why they don't get a 5 star is because I have high high standards for steak and even though the few bites I had were good, they weren't excellent.",1,0,0,Rola R.,"East Village, Manhattan, NY",42,100,10
5.0,1/13/2013,"Del Frisco's gave me a ""best of both worlds"" feeling. The restaurant itself is very classy and upscale, yet serves classic comfort food done very well. I was so impressed with the atmosphere, service, and of course the food.The dining rooms and bar were just lovely. It was packed, as it always seems to be, yet it had the feeling of being very spacious.The view of the neon signs from Radio City Music Hall was very New York. It was upscale yet relaxing at the same time.The service was perfect. Not perfect in that they are so involved and falling all over your every whim, but perfect in that they had no trouble communicating the menu in a friendly, down-to-earth way, yet never skipping a beat. The timing was perfect, and the recommendations were spot on.Now, the food. We started with the tuna tartare and crab cakes. Both were amazing. I can see why these crab cakes are so popular, perfect size and texture. For my entree I had the soy seared tuna, which is quite possibly the best piece of tuna I've had while living in NYC. But honestly, the sides were the star of the meal. Our group shared: the onion rings (amazing!), the smashed & sweet potatoes (if you must choose one, go for the sweet, amazing!), the creamed spinach (better than Benjamin's), and the lobster mac and cheese (my favorite). Each one was special with their own unique flavors. I would get the mac and cheese again and again. We finished the meal with the souffle cake a la mode, and the layered lemon cake. Both were so good, but after all of that food, I only took a tiny bite of each. All I can remember is how bright and fresh the lemon flavor was in the lemon cake. Will likely get it again.This has been quite possibly one of my finest dining experience in New York, and I can't wait to go back.",0,0,2,Abby S.,"Brooklyn, NY",20,66,0
4.0,1/10/2013,"Service is impeccable here, although I was a little disappointed the waitress checked my ID for a drink, said Happy Birthday and didn't put a candle on any of the 4 desserts we ordered.  I did however, sign up for the rewards card and they sent me an ecard saying they would offer a complimentary dessert if I mentioned it when making a reservation.  The rewards program is awesome, get $25 for every $350 spent.  I already have $75 waiting to be used!  I would say everything is delicious, just be ready to wait if you have a large group and most of you ordered steaks, we sat there for 20 minutes after finishing our appetizers.  The seafood plateau is $55 an order which comes with one claw, one shrimp, one lobster tail,  one crab leg, and 2 oysters.  A bit expensive, but the quality was very good.  I also like how when you share a steak, they give you an empty hot plate covered in butter and parsley, now that's classy!",0,0,0,Sarah L.,"Manhattan, NY",31,68,43
5.0,1/10/2013,"I came here to celebrate a special occasion and oh my god did they make me feel like a Queen. We got seated at probably one of the best seats in the house. The seat overlooked the front of the building. It was beautiful and almost impossible to focus on my date considering the outstanding view. We ordered some drinks - i got the ever so famous VIP - Delicious if you like fruity drinks and my date ordered his favorite scotch (which they had - Bonus POINTS) For appetizers, we got some recommendations from friends to indulge in the crab cake along with my personal choice - the tuna tar tar which I am a sucker for. Let me tell you - the Crab Cake is absolutely Scrumptious! Tender, moist, flavorful and amazing. If you don't like crab, get it because you will find a new love for it. The Tuna tar tar was delicious as well - they added some desirable spices to up the flavor to fabulous. Appetizers - A+Entree - I got the Filet Mignon and my date ordered the Rib Eye. Both were tender, moist and cooked to perfection. They had us take the first cut to ensure that it was cooked to our desire and it definitely was. I was ecstatic and eager to eat the whole plate. As for the sides we got potatoes and creamed spinach both went perfectly with our steak and tasted amazing. My taste buds were floating on cloud n9ne from the heavenly food that Del Friscos had served. Entrees - A+As a gracious way to help celebrate our special occasion, Del Frisco's gave us a dessert free of charge. It was a fresh out of the oven moist, decadent chocolate cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Again my taste buds were floating amongst the clouds with the spectacular dessert that was given to us. Dessert - A+Absolutely outstanding service, gracious staff, and perfect food. If you are willing to spend the extra dollar (as it is quite pricey) it'll be worth every single penny. My date and I try to go to different places to celebrate this special occasion, but there is a very high chance we will be returning to Del Frisco's once again. They left us with an amazing taste in our mouth and an eager to return experience.Del Friscos - A++",3,0,2,Julia L.,"New York, NY",314,315,19

I do have to say that I was so impressed with how hard the restaurant worked to apologize to me for my bad lunch experience - the level of customer service that Scott and his team offered me was above and beyond and I am so appreciative.  That alone would have brought me back to this restaurant, but I'm glad the food will too.  Thanks!",1,0,1,Kate W.,"Oakland, CA",121,17,3

4.0,12/8/2012,"Popped in for a business dinner recently, and thoroughly enjoyed my experience. Del Frisco's is certainly a hot spot for the corporate culture with expense accounts. There are a lot of business men sitting around tables drinking expensive whiskey and cracking jokes about work. It is very crowded, loud, and not the place you'd want to take a date. Our waitress was very sweet, but annoyingly bubbly. No one is THAT happy. I appreciate real people, and I find that behavior to be somewhat irritating. She was a good waitress though, I won't take that away from her, but she needs to take it down a couple of notches.The crab cakes were delicious, so was the lobster mac and cheese (I mean, how could you go wrong with that?!). I had the Filet Mignon sampler, which was 3 cuts of meat with different sauces. The types of sauces escape me at the moment, but they were all very tasty. My steaks were cooked to perfection. The cauliflower did not do it for me at all. In fact, it was downright gross. I finished up my meal with a glass of Single Barrel Jack Daniels, and a white chocolate Creme Brulee.   In short, I wouldn't recommend going to this place during happy hour, it is unbearably crowded and loud. As for price, it is just like any other NYC high-end steakhouse - EXPENSIVE! Dinner for two will run you about $300-350 depending on whether you drink or not.

3.0,11/16/2012,"Had the opportunity to try Del Frisco's without having to look at the bill due to a vendor seminar. It was quite challenging finding the place due to poor outside signage. Think I looked into the glass a few times and couldnt quite figure out if it was the right place. Ended up going into Chipotle and feeling sheepish asking about a fancy steakhouse at a casual fast food chain restaurant. Eventually, Rockefeller center security set me straight.The service was a bit lacking, that is for sure. Had to ask twice before getting a water refill and I was never asked if I wanted coffee with my desert. Must say though, the place did look nice inside. I was also quite happy there was cell service in the basement rooms.Now on to the food...Del's Salad: Lettuce, tomato, bacon, croutons, etc. Found the croutons to be quite hard and had to jab it with a knife and literally pry it in half. Also, they put way too much dressing atop the salad, literally sinking all of it. Not a bit fan. The bread served with the salad was decent, but with 8 people at the table it only took 2 or 3 of us to wipe it out. Unfortunately, going back to the lack of service, the bread was not replenished.Filet Mignon: Very tasty and one of the better ones I have had. However, the presentation and accompaniments were quite poor. I think the presentation of the Salmon Fillet, Sesame Seared Tuna, and Roasted Chicken Breast were much much better. I found myself looking at my colleagues plates and wishing my choice was not so poor. I would have expected for a steak house something else on my plate than a hung of beef. Maybe some pepper gravy, fancy onion rings, etc. Broccoli and chateau potatoes were served 'family style'. Oddly, they left extra potatoes on the table but not broccoli. Once again, comes down to service I think.Cheesecake with Strawberries: Probably one of the better and bigger slices of chessecake I have ever had. Dont even want to know the amount of calories. Would have been great with a coffee or even an irish coffee. No one came around my table to ask though.In summary, very nice location and decor with really great tasting red meat.

The service was stellar and atmosphere is fun, energetic and the views are amazing. The experience in that regard is top notch.However; I feel appetizers and sides are just as important to a steakhouse than the actual steak itself. To me, they make or break places. It almost sets the tone.We started with the Thai calamari and it was good, but for the price and the amount of ""rings"" provided it failed to thoroughly impress.The sides were atrocious. King Crab gnocchi was just one big gooey mound of cheese, gummy gnocchi and maybe Prince not king crab chunks.The au gratin potatoes were possibly the worst I've had in my entire life. Then there was the lobster mac and cheese. Wasn't bad, but it smelled like feet and that is because they put a gallon of Parmesan Romano on it. As of right now this place was basically doing a typical A-Rod night, 0-4.The steaks weren't bad, but they were a little bland for me. I prefer them medium but a few people at our tables had to return their steaks for being undercooked. Apparently this happens a lot here.Many people will shun those who use steak sauce but this steak needed it. Again, it wasn't a bad steak but it didn't pack that punch.

5.0,10/12/2012,"Del Frisco's was amazing to say the least. Best steak house I have ever eaten at. The hostesses and waiters are all extremely friendly and willing to answer any questions you may have. We started off with the crab cake. To..Die...For. An absolute MUST GET! We went here for my girlfriends birthday before we went to see Jersey Boys on 52nd Street. I had a special that was three small steaks with three different toppings on each, also another amazing dish. On the side I got the Lobster gnocchi, which was outstanding. She got the pre-theater special which is an 8 oz steak, A salad with an amazing avocado dressing, a side dish, and a desert, which she got the cheesecake. The VIP drink was perfect, not too strong, but very tasty. The food was cooked perfectly, and exactly the way we ordered it, Medium rare, the way they're supposed to be eaten! The Waiter TJ was extremely helpful, he always walked by the table to make sure everything was perfect. He actually cares about his job unlike some other places where they just come to make money and don't care about you or the food. He actually took the time to sit down and get to know us and we chatted for a good 10 minutes about ourselves and the city and what not. It was actually nice to have someone come over and talk like that. The Executive Chef Elvis Inniss was extremely nice as well. I used to work in a restaurant and I always enjoyed people calling me out to the dining room to express how great the food was. He came out and talked to us about how much he cares about his food and then gave us his business card. Even the dining room assistants where nice, usually at most restaurants they just come after you have already gotten up and left. Here they come and remove any empty glasses and offer to fill them, take any empty dishes or silverware off the table if you are not using them so they do not get in the way, they also kindly fold your napkins if you get up and use the rest room etc. Very nice to see this as well. In conclusion, I can not wait to go back! I have already recommended this restaurant to numerous friends and family.

1.0,10/4/2012,"I was really curious about this place, and even though I am not a steakhouse person, their extensive fish and seafood items made me look forward to my dinner there.I had the Shellfish Plateau for appetizer, which includes chilled Alaskan king crab legs, iced jumbo shrimp, fresh oysters on the half shell and chilled crab claws. At $55 I would have expected parts of my lobster to not be still frozen solid, and the oysters just so-so.  For my entree I've had the pan-roasted sea bass and shared an order of the crab gnocchi with the table. Both were terribly disappointing. Now, I am a Pescatarian, so all I eat is seafood. I have had all types of fish, prepared in every way possible, but this fish by far was the worst I have ever had the misfortune to. The fish was soaked in butter, and after about 3 bites of it I just wanted to gag. The crab gnocchi had hardly any crab in it.  I couldn't wait for them to finally clear the table, and take the block of buttery fish-brick away from me. I should also mention that our waitress seemed to have some mental and/or psychological issues. She was bubbly in the ""you've gotta be high"" way, and even excused herself at one point because she wanted to go brush her teeth. (Why tell us about it you ask? Right.) For dessert I had the chocolate mousse. It was just okay, and at THAT still the best part of the meal. I tried their ""Professional martini"", which is just a straight martini with blue cheese stuffed olives. The drink was messy. Blue cheese all over the olives, instead it being stuffed inside. Some of the blue cheese even smeared on my glass. Not very elegant. Or ""Professional"".I can't think of one single thing they got right for us that evening. Nothing but negative memories. Should have gone next door to Oceana, which never disappoints. I will not be returning, nor will I recommend Del Frisco's to anyone.",2,2,0,Héloïse M.,"Manhattan, NY",2,34,0
4.0,10/4/2012,"BE PREPARED TO ENTER FOOD COMA HEAVENThis place is freaking amazing. I don't even know where to start. OH WAIT - YES I DO. AMBIENCE: From the second you walk in, everyone treats you like a king. Service is top notch - one of the best in new york. The servers go out of their way to see that your food is prepared just as you asked. This last time, my steak was slightly overcooked (i only eat steak medium rare - the only way God intended steak to be made). I actually felt like the server felt awful. She took it back without me even asking, she just saw the look on my face that i wasn't completely satisfied. AND THEN she brought out THREE (not just ONE) - THREE - desserts to make up for it. For my graduation dinner, the server overheard us talking that my sister had also just graduated, and she brought out free desserts for both of us! Yay for yummy sweety deliciousness! This is definitely a power lunch spot. Tables of men in business suits. However, for petite women like me (with appetites like mine) - have no fear. The food will more than make up for that.... STEAK: One of the best steaks I've had in the city. And i'm from texas - so I know steak! Very tender, juicy, full of flavor goodness. Slightly seasoned with pepper but not too much that it overcomes the taste of the steak. My usual go to is the 16 oz ribeye. The ribeye is pretty fatty, but that's just the way i like it! SIDES: (1) The onion rings - omg the onion rings. Big, fat cuts of onion, deep fried in buttery batter. I cannot get enough. (2) The last time I went, they had brussel sprouts sauteed with carmelized onions and bits of bacon! BACON PEOPLE! I really only like my brussel sprouts roasted or fried (i.e. as unhealthy as possible) but these were pretty darn good. ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THEY TASTED LIKE BACON. (3) I have also had their mashed sweet potatoes. I'm not typically a huge fan of mashed sweet potatoes because i think they tend to be too sweet, but these were creamy, heavenly perfect. DESSERTS: (1) Six Layer Lemon Cake - huge slice of moist, yellow lemon cake. Mmmm - i like that it's not too lemony. (2) Chocolate souffle with ice cream - the chocolate cake was pretty good when combined with the ice cream, but i didn't really like it that much on its own. It was maybe a little too rich for my taste. (3) Butterscotch cheesecake -  mmmm so creamy, it kind of looks like a huge slice of whipped cream. Taste it with the butterscotch and it is one of the best desserts you'll ever have. well, there goes my diet for the rest of the week....",0,2,0,Van-Ann B.,"TriBeCa, Manhattan, NY",120,107,12

5.0,10/3/2012,"We were having a terrible day and just wanted STEAK. Well, we ordered much more than steak.We had two VIPs-- which stands for vodka-infused pineapple, apparently-- to drink. One on the rocks, one straight up. Both were delicious and like nothing I've had before. (Side note: I'm pretty sure it's easy enough to make at home, but I haven't tried... yet.)To eat, we had some west coast oysters to start, which were properly shucked and tasted very fresh. We also had the lobster mac and cheese that contained huge chunks of lobster, and that made my tummy very happy. And the steak. Filet mignon served on a piping hot plate (reminded me of Ruth's Chris)-- nothing to complain about there. We were asked to cut open our steaks to peek if they were perfect, and they were. Bonus points for making sure our food was exactly the way we wanted it. Oh, and we ordered a side of veggies to pretend like we were being healthy or something. We ate every bite of our food. I'm pretty sure I wanted to lick the plate, but that's generally frowned upon in public.Our server was amazing (Angie? her name is on a card somewhere in the apartment). She was super attentive and fun to talk to. It was a not-so-busy Monday night (most of the people there were enjoying happy hour at the bar), and we were having a pretty early dinner, so even more reason to pay extremely close attention to the few patrons you do have. And she nailed it. She also gets a handful of gold stars because she hand-wrote and snail-mailed a personalized thank you card to us; it mentioned something we talked about at dinner. I don't know if that's something all the servers do, but in any case, I don't think I've ever experienced that kind of service.Food was great, service was amazing, so yeah, I would return in a heartbeat.",2,0,0,Amanda L.,"Denver, CO",127,296,0

Since we are such a large group they had 2 waiters for our table. I was one of few who could speak english and I basically took the responsibility to order for half of the table. They were very patient and understanding. The wine list was very comprehensive, as expected. The waitress took some time to give me recommendations according to my price range.I ordered: Crab cakes and Tuna Tartar as appetizers to start. Crab cakes were small, but rich and tasty. The Tuna Tartar has a spicy flavor which I loved. For entrees, I got the scallops and it was so filling. For sides, I ordered creamy spinach, crab gnocchi, cauliflowers, lobster mac & cheese. My favorite is the gnocchi, sauteed mushrooms and cauliflowers. Sooooooo delicious. For desserts, we got fresh berries, warm chocolate cake and cheesecake. I'm not too impressed by them but could be because I was so stuffed by then. The bill came out to be around $70-100 each.

We were seated downstairs in a small enclosed dining room, which was quieter and more intimate than the outside/main dining area, but also seemed a little cut off from the rest of the restaurant. Not my cup of tea that night as I wanted to do more people watching and it made me feel a little claustrophobic.We ordered the crab cake appetizer, which came with one crab cake for ~$28. It was good, but not amazing or unique. We also ordered a special bone-in steak they were offering that day (forget what cut), which we requested to come out red to pinkish. It came out overcooked, almost well done. The very inner parts of the steak that were not overcooked were good. The side dishes we got were very yummy (lobster mac & cheese and sweet potato casserole).The service was ok, but I would expect more from a $$$$$ restaurant.

However, I have tried pretty much everything on the menu and here are my faves:We will start with the food. Reasonable ""business lunch"" - a three course meal for about $32. IMO - best filet mignon in NYC. They season the hell out of there steaks (~$40) which i really like so there is no need for hollandaise, steak sauce, bearnaise, etc. For appetizer - go with the crab cake if you like seafood. Its more like a lump of crab with the most amazing sauce (pink/orange cream sauce). Coconut jumbo shrimp is delicious as well. They also have great sides such as the sweet mash potatoes with tons of butter and brown sugar on top.... and also the hash browns are great and the broccoli.Vodka drinks are always strong but pricey as its a classy place. Go with the VIP (vodka infused pineapple) if you are looking for something thats strong and taste great with dinner. Tons of business people here but you get some young people as well.

We ordered some apps and sides to share, half the table ordered steaks,( this is a steakhouse after all :) One person in our group ordered the lamb, and a couple others sea food. Starting with the Apps &  Sides - The more memorable ones were 1) Crab cake. YUMMY!! large lumps of crab meat with very little filler, fresh and delicious. 2) the calamari - it's done ""Shanghai style"" with a sweet and sour sauce with a small kick of heat, a little too saucy for me, but everyone else enjoyed it. 3)Fresh Mozzarella - this was served with tomatoes, very fresh and creamy, delicious! 4) Lobster Mac & Cheese - very lobstery, creamy and exactly what you expect lobster mac & cheese to be. 5) Crab gnocchi - this was a special for the night and SO good, I totally wanted to order another one... but I didn't want my first impression to be Gena Fatty... so I resisted.Entrees - the steaks were cooked to our specifications, they ask you to cut straight down the middle to check for doneness and it was perfect, the seasoning was pretty heavy on the steaks, and i didn't feel like i needed any sauce. To be fair, their dry aged steaks were pretty tasty but I personally like the Peter Luger steaks better.

3.0,8/6/2012,"I can't bring myself to give Del Frisco's 4/5 stars. I personally didn't find them to be all as amazing as others claim them to be. The noise level at this place was ridiculous, probably likely due to the high ceilings and the openness of the dining area. My filet mignon was cooked to perfection but it was insanely salty and i mean INSANELY. Every bite of steak was accompanied with a punch to the taste buds of saltiness to the point where it was really all you tasted. A mashed potatoes side is not an option here which makes me sad. What steak restaurant does not offer mashed potatoes?! it goes hand-in-hand with steak. O the horror! I opted for the potatoes au gratin as a substitute and what a poor substitute that was... Now i've never had potatoes au gratin before but this strange concoction is virtually inedible. Really quite gross actually. The reason why I give them a 3 is because the steak would've been good if they had eased off the salt a little. You can sense that there was something definitely good underneath all that. You get a 3.5 if yelp offered that option.",1,1,0,helen c.,"Manhattan, NY",2,11,0

I could never forget the very first time I went. The waiter very sensibly asked if my party had a show to catch before taking our order - which we did. Not only were they accommodating to our schedule, but they handled the time constraint very pleasantly and professionally.In terms of food, the lump crab cake with cajun lobster sauce is a MUST!!

4.0,7/7/2012,Came here for a joint birthday and absolutely loved it.  My bone in rib eye was cooked perfectly and had so much flavor!  My boyfriend loved his double eagle steak.  It was huge!  The side dishes that our party of 15 loved are:- creamed spinach - so creamy!- lobster mac and cheese - delicious and cheesyThe Potatoes and Onions was our least favorite side dish (just nothing special about it).Shoe string fries were good but fries are fries and with limited stomach space it isn't a must have in my book.Favorite appetizers:- crab cake - 1 crab cake with great sauce- Crispy Shanghai Calamari - flavor was greatThe chilled shrimp cocktail was okay but nothing special.For dessert our server set down a ginormous slice of lemon cake.  I'm a huge chocolate fanatic and lemon is not anywhere on the list of flavors i'd normally order as a dessert item but let me tell you....this lemon cake is every bit as amazing as all the yelpers claim it is.  Our party had also ordered a bread pudding and we passed these two desserts around our table.  The bread pudding was forgettable but the lemon cake was such a huge hit that people kept asking to have more of it despite us all being ridiculously full.  I will definitely be back.,1,0,1,Kate K.,"Queens, NY",27,131,15
3.0,7/4/2012,"This meal cost a fortune, which was expected though. I had a filet, ordered it medium, which the server said would be medium rare. It came out well done. There was only the slightest pink in the center. I really don't know what to attribute that to. When the food was brought out, the server asked me to cut into the filet to make sure it was cooked, and it was; but I didn't realize until far into it just how well done it was.My wife liked her salmon, so that's a plus. I have to say that the staff was fantastic, so that's another plus. Our waitress was extremely friendly and the bartender greeted us with a pineapple infused martini upon our entrance. The quality of the food can't be beat but here's the problem: This place was described to my wife and I as the premier steakhouse in NYC. The concierge at the hotel and the bartender at our hotel both raved about it. We have been to high end steakhouses throughout the U.S. and so I think our expectations were so high, that we were bound to be disappointed.

5.0,6/17/2012,"Ever since I became obsessed with NYC steakhouses back in 2000, I have heard overwhelmingly great things about Del Frisco's ""Double Eagle"" Steakhouse. I finally nailed down a time to go with a group of old friends and coworkers when one was back in town from California. A nice 25 second stroll from my office took me to one of the best steakhouses in the city. A second trip to this joint in December of 2012 solidified Del Frisco's place in my top five. New info added on that trip is in italics. Flavor: 10I ordered the ribeye that they had on special; a 22oz bone-in cut of heaven. It had a nice seasoned crust, the kind of marbled fat that just melts away and gets really soft, and it was perfectly cooked. It could have rested another two minutes, but that didn't alter juice or flavor qualities. My friend ordered the filet. I had a bite of that, and it was delicious and well seasoned too. Del Frisco's certainly lived up to the hype for me in terms of flavor. On a second trip with a couple of buddies from Junior High, High School and beyond, I ordered the house special: the double eagle bone-in strip. It, too was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious.  Choice of Cuts & Quality Available: 10Everything on the menu is prime quality. They only have the four basic cuts (filet, ribeye, porterhouse and strip), but they offer several varieties of each, like the 38oz longbone American ""wagyu"" ribeye and some specials (see below). This makes up for the initial point I was going to take for not having anything outside the basics. Del Frisco's shows that when you do the basics the right way, nothing else is needed. Portion Size & Plating: 8The filet comes in two flavors: vaginal (8oz) and quasi-manly (12oz). They also have 16oz strips and ribeyes (boneless) - a bit on the small side but not horrific. They also offer a signature bone-in ""double eagle"" strip at 26oz, as well as a 24oz porterhouse, and a special bone-in filet at 16oz. The relatively smaller sizes make it easy for the eye to wander to the 38oz ""wagyu"" ribeye at 2x the price, or the specials at 1.5x the price. Well worth the up-charge, in my opinion. The plating is super-basic. But for real men with balls swinging between their legs, plating isn't really something you go yammering to your friends about anyway. Price: 8In my opinion the price was a bit on the hefty side for the size of the cuts, but relatively on par with other NYC steakhouses of even footing. What they lack in size is made up for in taste, so you kinda even out on price value. The filets are $40 and $47, ribeye $46, and strip $48. The porterhouse comes in at $58, and the wagyu at $92. The specials ran in the mid $60 range. The signature crab cake comes in at a pricey, but worthy, $21 (crab cake went up $1 since last visit, but I guess that's just standard inflation). My martini at the bar was $18.50 (an incredible $20 when you leave a tip). The total bill for two appetizers, three beers, a vodka tonic, two steaks, two sides and a dessert was about $300 (tax and tip included). On my second trip, I took a photo of the elusive Mr. William Price, that way you scumbags can see just exactly what everything cost:  Bar: 9The main bar is really beautiful. Del Frisco's has a wide open floor plan with a nice wrap-around bar internally positioned alongside the high windows in the corner of the restaurant. There is also a nice sized second bar on the second floor with a couple of flat panel TVs for sports. The martini could have used a little less vermouth, and was a bit pricey, but overall the bar experience was great. This is definitely an after work spot worth checking out after a hard day at the office, even if you don't eat the meat. On my second trip, the martinis were made much nicer, our incredible waiter Tim introduced me to one of the most delicious, peaty scotches I have ever tasted (Ardbeg Corryvreckan), and we also ordered a wine from the extensive wine list. I also took note of an interesting passage featured above the bar: DO RIGHT AND FEAR NO MAN. The quote, as far as I can tell, dates back to a 15th century proverb out of England, and then later common in 18th century Scotland. Specials and Other Meats: 10Aside from the ""wagyu"" ribeye, the other carcasses were on the order of lamb chops, veal porterhouse, pork porterhouse and roasted chicken. That covers the whole basic range. Those are all standard menu items, so it is a good selection for people who don't feel like being a man. On special there was the 22oz bone-in ribeye, which I had ($65). There was also the conundrum 16oz bone-in filet ($68) and trio of filets (also somewhere in the low to mid $60s range). They also had some seasonal shellfish special appetizers too. Apps, Sides & Desserts: 10I had been told - no ORDERED - by a friend to get the crab cake, so I did. It was a succulent 4oz ball with mostly lump crab meat and a bit of breadcrumb for texture. (REVIEW CUT FOR LENGTH)",4,3,4,JohnnyPrimeC. C.,"Manhattan, NY",199,213,4300

He gave very good suggestions as to which dishes and came to check on us frequently. He noticed that we came to celebrate my graduation and comp'd us a delicious chocolate dessert. We got the crab cakes, bone in rib eye, creamed spinach, and filet mignon. Everything was sooo delicious and the bone in rib eye was extremely tender. We only ordered 2 steaks between the 3 of us so the waiter split the dishes 3 way for us. The crab cakes -crave worthy. You can actually taste the crab pieces. The crab cake was moderately sized but so flavorful and totally worth the $22.The service was impeccable, food delicious and location is great.

I feel richer just breathing in the air from this place. My family started with the calamari which had a tangy/asian fusion twist to it. Absolutely delicious. For the main course, I got a prime ribeye. It was soft, fatty, and tender, but a little too well done. I asked for a medium but it came out more of a medium well. It was yummy but a bit large (16 oz), I couldn't finish it. My family ordered prime strip, filet mignon, and lamb chops which were all cooked perfectly. For sides, we got potatoes chateau, spinach supreme, and onion rings. The sides went perfectly with my steak and they're family style so it was easy to share and filling. Our waitress, Elizabeth, also gave us a complimentary dessert which was off was the hooooookkkk. I can honestly say I had a great meal from the appetizers to the dessert.

We started with Beef Tartare, Raw Oyster, Crab cake and their tomato with mozzarella cheese. They were all amazing, I did enjoy the salad and the beef tartare very much.We then all ordered steak as our main dish. I got the 16oz Ribeye which gave me a mouth full of meat heaven. My friend ordered the 26oz Strip steak and I still don't know how he finished all that amount of meat by himself. The steak was juicy & very tender.

5.0,4/30/2012,"I'm still dreaming about the trio of filet that I had.  They were so good.  I miss them dearly. (sniffle, sniffle).This is a steakhouse that will leave you with a lasting impression.  I took my guy here for his birthday.  For some reason I thought that it would be much more intimate than it was.  We had reservations for 6 pm on  Thursday and the place was bustling.  I asked for a seat upstairs, but they couldn't accommodate me, so we were seated on the lower level next to a window.  Our waiter Todd was excellent.  Onto the food:We demolished the little loaf of bread that they bring to the table.  ""No Todd, we don't want another.  Thanks anyway.""  I think my boyfriend tried to stab me after I said that.  Of course we had the crab cake to start.  Now, sometimes I think that Yelpers tend to exaggerate the quality of certain menu items, but they hit it dead on the nose on this one.  I wish I had 15 more of those babies, but they run $22 per and unfortunately me no gots an expense account.For the main, we ordered 2 of the specials @ about $60 and $68 respectively.  My trio of filet was...wait...I just blacked out thinking about them.  They were three of the tastiest steaks that I have ever had.  About 3 oz. each, seasoned perfectly.  I ate every last bite, even though they were a little overcooked (I ordered medium, they were more like medium-well).  I don't remember the exact steak that my guy got, but he insists that it was the best steak he's ever had.  The sides my guy chose (it was his Bday after all) were the lobster mac & cheese and the potatoes au gratin.  I thought the mac & cheese was okay.  It was a little garlicky for my taste.  I didn't dare try the au gratin.  Man, that thing was covered...nay slathered in cheese.  It looked like an express ticket to Clogged Arteryville.  My guy loved it though.  To drink I started with their special, the VIP.  Pineapple and vodka.  It was meh.  Nothing terrible, but nothing exciting either.  My second drink had blackberries, ginger, and bourbon.  That was a better drink. All in all you go to a steakhouse for steak.  I can forgive the so-so sides and weak 1st drink because the steaks were that good.  The service is also absolutely amazing.  We don't usually order dessert, so after the meal was over, we asked for the check.  However, I noted on my reservation (OpenTable) that we were celebrating a birthday.  Todd comped us a slice of the most delicious strawberry cheesecake I've ever tasted in my life.  Cheers to Todd!Total amount spent on 3 drinks, 1 app, 2 mains, and 2 sides (after tax and 20% tip) was $301.  Yes, yes I know.  Feel free to email me ""Girlfriend of the Year"" awards.",1,1,0,Chandy S.,"Manhattan, NY",15,82,3

It is even more rare to have your expectations exceeded, but...that is exactly what Del Frisco's did! First and foremost, the staff is friendly and thoughtful. I mean, every last one of them. From the receptionist to the coat check girl. Our waiter Aaron was super friendly and helpful with his suggestions. I asked his opinion on the sides and requested a warm & spicy red wine after my meal and his choices were right on the spot.The restaurant manager, Shawn, introduced himself and made sure we were being served properly and that we enjoyed our food. He gave us his business card and told us to call him anytime if we had any complaints or needed help in the future. Aaron and Shawn even brought out two birthday desserts for us (a huge slice of 7 layer lemon creme cake and Banana Bread Pudding with Vanilla Ice cream and whipped cream!) after our meal was finished!Appetizer: The legendary Crab Cake is everything you've heard about and more! My girlfriend absolutely LOVED it. I was looking forward to this and man did they deliver. Entree #1 - 16 oz Prime Rib Eye Steak Medium Rare. I've never been to Peter Luger's, but...I can't imagine anything being better than what I consumed at Del Frisco's. It was juicy and tender and my knife went through it like butter. Every slice was heaven. Entree #2 - Shrimp Scampi w/Linguine. My girlfriend ordered this entree and the shrimp was marinated and seasoned to perfection all the way down to the shell. I tried just one off of her plate because after eating my steak I was stuffed.Sides: Asparagus & Chateau Potatoes. The Asparagus was sauteed perfectly and since I wanted Potatoes with my steak but couldn't really deal with cheese, Aaron suggested the Chateau Potatoes instead of the skillet potatoes & onions or the Au Gratin. Excellent choice, Aaron!Bread for the table - Soft & warm and the whipped butter was perfectTwo glasses of Riesling to start things off was more perfection.This was the best dining experience I've had in NYC and I've lived here all of my life. Oh, one more thing...a lot of people complain about the noise in some of their reviews. That is because they were sitting downstairs in the most crowded part of the restaurant. We were seated upstairs and even though you could tell by the background sound there were a lot of people in the restaurant we could speak to each other comfortably.

We started with a seafood appetizer and a crab cake (there were three of us) and the seafood was a combination of raw oysters, shrimp, crab legs and possibly something else. It was about as fresh as you can get, and was perfect for three people. We then split the 32 oz Wagu steak, which was orgasmic. It was so perfect, only have had steaks of that quality at places like Peter Luger. Ordered two sides with it, can't say we had room for dessert but they looked incredible. Great cappuccino too. The crowd was definitely very businessy, majority were men in business suits and everyone very mature and refined looking. Very nice group of people to be dining with. The service was extraordinary. They made you feel very welcome and special and gave you the attention and politeness as if you were the only ones there.

4.0,4/24/2012,"Every year, I take my bf out after I get my bonus at work. He likes steak, so we've been making the rounds around the city. I heard great things about DF from my friend who's been to their Boston outpost and said it's the best steak he's ever had. I'll break this review down by category:Ambience: 5 stars. The place is airy, with tall vault-like ceilings, staircases with dark wood, beautiful floors and furniture, and staff dressed in tuxes. The bathroom is up the stairs, so even if you're on the first floor you get to go up the stairs and enjoy the view from the floor to ceiling windows. The view of a big plaza and Radio City adds to the grandeur.Value: 4 stars. Yes, it's an expensive restaurant, but you're paying for so much more than the food. Our meal for 2 was attended by about 6 or 7 people: 1 to seat you, 1 to take your drink order, 1 to take your food order, 2 to bring the food, 1 guy to put freshly ground pepper on your salad, another to get the crumbs off your table with one of those L-shaped metal thingies. Well, you get the point: it's a big operation. A tip: if you go before 6:30 on a weeknight, you can order from the pre-theater menu. It's $50 for a salad, steak/fish, sides, and dessert. Probably $100 value when you add all those things up.Service: World-class. The waiters, hosts, etc were all very charming, polite, and well-trained. Exactly what I would expect from this kind of place.Food: I thought the food was just ok. I realize they're serving hundreds of people at one time, and it's hard to run such an operation without skimping on quality, but everything seemed to have an excess of butter and salt, which in my opinion is cheating. Some details:--Salad: the lettuce didn't seem very fresh, and the tomatoes were flavorless and tasted refrigerated. The avocado ranch dressing was yummy...I even got chunks of avocado. --Salmon filet: grilled perfectly, but again, too salty/buttered for my liking--Broccoli was way too salty, and cooked less than I like (more like al dente)--Mashed potatoes were really rich/heavy...typical of steak houses. A bit generous on the heavy cream--Chocolate mousse: really good! Very rich and chocolatey...I could only have a few bites. Comes with strawberries and whipped cream on top.Conclusion: A good place if you want to come for the experience of eating rich food in a classy setting.",0,0,0,Larisa T.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",16,197,0

If anybody can relate, seeing stuff like that make me freak out.

I'm a good daughter, right? Figured the man raised me so the least I could do was a drop a few on his day of birth. We arrived a little early and they were happy to accomodate us. Initial impressions of the place were that it was grand and spacious. They do not skimp on spacing out the tables which allows you to have some privacy unlike other NYC restaurants where you are on top of each other. Space is a luxury and Del Frisco's understands this and delivers. Noted and appreciated.We each got the specials. 24 oz steak for my dad, medium (just a bit of pink). Three 4 oz filet mignon pieces with different sauces for me, blue cheese, crab, and mushroom (my fave). Side of asparagus and some bread. Voila, a lovely meal! Our server was a sweetheart and had asked if it was a special occassion (um did we look out of place or normal question?). After we decided to split a gi-nourmous slice of lemon cake, she slyly mentioned that it was on the house! Bill was hefty, but worth it for special occassions.

They have the whole package, great steaks, excellent service, and an impressive ambiance. I returned to Del Frisco's after being invited back by a couple of managers because my last experience in the Beginning of February was a poor one. Del Frisco' really stands behind their name and they strive to make sure each diner has a top notch experience. This time on my return back I was not disappointed. The steaks were excellent!! All were perfectly seasoned, cooked to perfection and very tasty. I ordered the double eagle strip, their signature cut, which is double the thickness of your average strip, on the bone and just enough marbling for that extra bite of flavor. Plus, the manager of the NYC restaurant stopped by a FEW times to check on us, which was very nice and much appreciated. He even sent over a few sides on the house which scored extra brownie points with my parents and my wife. Getting back to the restaurant, the service was on point, they didn't miss a beat and when it came to desert I was blown away by the Lemon Cake. You definitely have to get that.

4.0,3/9/2012,"It's not everyday I'm asked to a steakhouse, but this was a special occasion for a special birthday.  We arrived a few minutes early, and not everyone in the party had arrived yet.  The hostesses were very friendly and accommodating and asked that we just let them know when everyone arrived.  Meanwhile we muscled up to the bar, and ordered a couple of drinks.  I got a hoegarden, and the birthday girl ordered a VIP, thx to the bartenders friendly recommendation.  Sweet & strong!  The bar is an L shaped one, with lots of open space.  YOu can't not be on view in this resto, in every way a place to people watch and be seen.  Great big glass windows in front look out onto the fountains and sixth avenue, midtown.Shortly after the rest of our party arrived, all smiles & merriment, and we all said our hellos.  Then the hostess quickly brought us upstairs, to a nice table with a fantastic view.  Large round table is nice because everyone can make eye contact with everyone else.  The birthday girl was her typical lovely shy self, secretly lavishing the attention that we were all giving her.The waiters at this place are all very on top of their game, quick to offer a refill, or attend to any needs you might have.  Everyone gets treated like a king or queen.  Nice.  Most folks ordered steaks in various states of uncooked-ness, meanwhile I ordered the red snapper, and dug into the bread in the meantime.  We all had plenty of time to order more drinks, and the waitress was quick to offer us *cheaper* upselling options.  LOL.  I enjoyed that whole conversation.  Almost as quickly as we ordered, it seemed not ten minutes went by and our food was coming out.  All smiles again, a swat team of waiters and busboys converged on our table, to lay out all the dishes, knives, or anything else we might require.Now everyone went to town, digging and cutting, chewing and chatting.  There seemed to be smiles all around so many happy diners! As we lingered over the last morsels, almost as soon as the thought entered my head that I was wondering, where is that swarm wait staff now?  Suddenly as if out of nowhere they were everywhere, clearing off each of our plates almost as quickly as they served them.  Not a fork dropped, not a food morsel left behind.  Service!Nice evening above 14th street was had by all!",1,1,2,Sean S.,"Manhattan, NY",757,1661,36

It was crazy to me and my coworkers that this restaurant was super busy on a Monday nite and we were seated on the second d floor with such a pretty view . finally we came down to desserts so we couldn't pick just one we had the 11 layer chocolate cake  which was Enormous but as a chocolate lover i was in fat girl heaven lol . we also had strawberry cheesecake and the lemon sponge cake they also were very tasty but hands down the chocolate was just amazing . i would say its a bit expensive i would keep this is like a special event type of place such as a birthday or anniversary  because you wont regret  . the staff and everyone here were super friendly . cant wait to try them in Las Vegas i hope i have the same great experience there too .,3,3,2,Patricia R.,"Tampa, FL",93,197,61

4.0,3/5/2012,"Met a friend here who's an NYC local. He proclaimed this place as the best steak in the city, so naturally I was curious. We started with the calamari as well as a crab cake for each of us. The calamari had a sweet Asian style sauce drizzled over it with a nice crunch from the breading. The crab cakes, however, were the star of the night, definitely one of the best if not the best crab cake I've ever had. It was just about all crab, and the subtle seasoning was perfect so that I could get maximum crab flavor. For the main course I went with the bone-in filet medium rare. The cut of meat was superior, though the steak came back more rare than medium rare. We also had the creamed spinach which was also excellent (anything with bacon is pretty much a sure hit in my book). I was also impressed with their wine list. Since my friend didn't drink any wine, I ordered a 375ml Brunello which went nicely with my steak. This place is definitely pricey, but well worth it in my opinion.

(Read reviews that the view upstairs was superb!) And, they seated us upstairs with a view -- huzzah!The more closer we got to the date, the more people wanted to come. I had called in to ask if they can squeeze in an extra person and they did without any problems. I didn't have the heart to ask for two more extra seats...because I felt as if it was kinda tacky on my part.I memorized the dinner menu before the actual dinner date. I knew what side dishes and appetizers to get and whatnot...only to find out that the portions were large and none of my friends wanted what I wanted. I think they ordered the lobster mac & cheese and some potatoes. I couldn't really taste the mac & cheese because I was afraid I might have to run to the bathroom shortly after. (dammit for being lactose intolerant!) Ordered a bottle of Moscato (so heavenly!)...drank it between two other people.For an entree, I got the salmon. I couldn't really taste that either because I was already drinking so much (damn you, nerves!), so I had Sean finish my plate. He said he liked it better than his sea bass. Our waitress, Kathleen (?) was so nice and pretty...kept filling up the bread and butter after a bunch of us dived into it like hawks.Them bringing out the lemon and chocolate cakes were nice, but I thought it was kinda unnecessary. $23 for 2 layered slices of cakes?!

Even for a special occasion, it's very over-priced, but I did walk out happy and thinking more about the delicious meal I had just enjoyed than the bill, so that's good.

My wifes crab cake was awesome and so was the calamari apps. If the strip had some more flavor meal would have been great. Wife had the stone crabs which she loved.

Now I'm not a wine drinker at all but I wanted to try my hand at it this night so I could get the whole NY Steakhouse experience.  She was great in understanding this and allowed me to sample several, and I mean SEVERAL, red wines.  I could've just done that and been happy with what would've been equivalent to a complimentary glass of wine.  I was however able to find one to my liking and went with it.  As for the food?  Well let me say that all the previous reviews about the food is pretty much on point.First to arrive was a Crab Cake and a simple Mozzarella Caprese salad.  Both items were great but that crab cake??  WOW, it was amazing!  You definitely will want to order this as a single and keep it for yourself, it's just that good.  My wife decided to order from the Specials Menu although I'm quite sure that no matter which steak we chose, it would've been great either way.  She opted for the 16 oz. bone-in filet medium which was about 12 oz of meat and 4 oz of bone. I had the 16 oz. aged bone in rib eye which had so much flavor it was to die for.  Absolutely the best steak I've ever eaten. Normally I order my steaks medium well but this time I opted for medium and I definitely will keep it that way. Also ordered the side sampler which gave us lobster mac n cheese, king crab gnocchi and Chateau potatoes.. All of these were superb tasting.. Didn't have to add one thing of salt or pepper to either of them as they were seasoned perfectly. Finally we didn't want to leave without at least trying one of the desserts. Everything else had been so great we had to try the Banana Bread Pudding.  Yet again, another winner!!  All in all it was a great time, lots of laughs, plenty of great service and we can't wait to return.  You definitely want to give this place a shot if you're in the area.

I am not one to just drop that much money on a steak even if I have $150.00 in my pocket.  -Del Frisco's though is really cool for the atmosphere.  Back in 2006 or 2007, I saw Plaxico Burress here, I guess having a business meeting some members of the Giants and a NBC sports reporter there too.  That was pretty cool to actually see him there, yes I am a NAME dropper in some of my reviews.  I see alot of celebs around NYC, some more important at least to me to mention or talk to than others.  In this area of manhattan alone after work, I would see at least once a week, would see 1 or 2 famous people entering the main building right next to this steakhouse.",5,2,4,Jordan W.,"Bronx, NY",1532,1252,4031

In any case, it actually surprises me that Del Frisco's, a national chain, happens to be favorite steakhouse in NYC. Now, don't judge my palette as I am actually quite picky, but objectively speaking, it's just damn good. And I have been to numerous other steakhouses, such as Striphouse, WolfGang, Capital Grille, Ben & Jacks and numerous others. Haven't been to Peter Luger's, Sparks or BLT Prime yet though.I love the warm, steamy bread that they bring out in the beginning. Additionally, their crab cake appetizer is damn delectable, and that's coming from a Marylander. What separates them from other steaks must be the wet-aging process (as opposed to dry-aging) and just the right combination of broiler heat and proximity. Their au jus sauce is also simple and really brings out the taste/flavor of the meat. Though sometimes I will have it with a bearnaise sauce on the side for added calories and tang. I really like the ribeyes and filets. I miss their ""carpetbagger steak"" - it was simply their smaller cut of ribeye. One can also just get the filet tips for a very cheap $12.

4.0,1/7/2012,"My bosses have been telling me how much they love Del Frisco's so I made my husband take me here for our anniversary. It was January First so a lot of people were celebrating their new year and such. We got a reservation at 5:45PM and considered ourselves lucky. We were seated down and greeted by friendly waiter. The price here is pretty high, probably higher than Peter Lugers and Wolfgang, which are my favorite still in the city. We decided to start with their famous crab cake and share a Waygu Longbone for two with a side of their meshed walnut sweet potato. So we waited for a good while and the crab cake never came but steak came first! We were disappointed because we are paying a good deal here and they couldnt even figure out the order? So they apologized and went to rush our crab cake. Then, our waiter came back and didn't apologize. We were a little confused. He acted like he was covering up the fact the crab cake came at the right time. Nonetheless, the crab cake is definitely one of the best in the city. It is big and has tons of crab meat and the cream sauce is delicious. The waygu steak is outstanding. The outer crust is crispy and a litlle charred and there is plenty of fat in this big chunk of meat. The meshed sweet potato is definitely the best we have ever had. The crispy walnut crust on top of sweet mesh is like heaven! But did I forget to mention one of the waiters were trying to deliver a wrong entree again? Anyway, so we decided to get their Lemon Cake to end our big feast. It came in humongous size! We barely had half. The lemon icing was really good and the cake was sweet and moist.

4.0,1/4/2012,"Del Frisco's is a top-line steakhouse.  Whether it differentiates itself significantly from the best-of-the-best to merit a spot really comes down to hair-splitting.  The decor easily tops Luger's (as do most mediocre eateries), but doesn't pass Delmonico's.  The service is professional, without being aloof.  Food-wise, expect outstanding steaks and sides and the prices they command.  Don't, however, expect much innovation or creativity on the menu.  As spectacular as the Del Frisco dining experience may be, it isn't the best steakhouse in Midtown (try Keen's).  The Del Frisco's crowd has always struck me as being one of corporate expense account diners, rather than friends and lovers.  There is a certain antiseptic quality in the air of this chain restaurant location, and while faint, it tends to surface in food, setting and service whenever warmth or a personal touch would be most welcomed.  Make no mistake, Del Frisco's is a great expense account venue.  The clients who I've brought here, without exception, raved about the place.  It would not, however, be among my first choices for a gathering of friends or family.",12,11,12,Steve G.,"Union, NJ",681,831,0

4.0,1/3/2012,"Wife and I had dinner there on New Years Day. We had made reservations in mid-October in anticipation of our trip to NYC for the New Year celebration. Our reservation was honored and we were shown our table on the second level that looked out onto the Radio City plaza. The lights in the trees and the grand decorations in the plaza made for simply memorable setting. Our waitress, Sara, was prompt and helpful with the menu. I wish we had been more hungry or had come with more people so we could have sampled more dishes. We started by splitting a single crab cake appetizer, which was the perfect portion for what was coming later in the meal. The crab cake was just crab with little if any filler. I don't know how they stay together coming out of the pan. I ordered the 16 oz. prime strip and my wife ordered the prime fillet three ways - 12 oz. total. The sides were creamed spinach with bacon in it and sauteed mushrooms. The meat was cooked to perfection. One word of warning is that the service plates are lava hot! We both commented on the amount of salt used in seasoning the meat, but it didn't detract from the meal. Both sides were excellent, as well. I can't say that this is the best steak I have ever had, but it certainly is in the top three.  We had a delightful time!In other reviews, I read that this place is a bit dressy, so I wore a sports coat, slacks and a tie.

You'll get a serving of mashed potatoes with some steak on the side, I'll be sure to take a picture next time I go.It's a perfect lunch serving, I'd say you get at least 6 cubes of steak but eaten with the mashed potatoes it just works. It'll set you back $12 but the steak is perfectly cooked, the mashed potatoes are creamy and buttery and it's a nice sit down joint if you have about an hour of time. I'll have to try an actual steak sometime, but I don't see myself coming here too much unless it's for a business dinner/lunch. The place is a bit stuffy, it's definitely for bankers and lawyers and power couples, etc. During lunch time you'll see a lot of folks that are clearly indifferent to an hour lunch and $50 tab as well as bored housewives who are perfectly manicured and will come for a salad. (which is probably like $15 at least) The place does get very busy especially during lunch, it's never crowded or frantic but the tables will fill up and the bartenders will start to run around since they handle everything from making drinks, to serving the bar, to taking phone orders, and ringing up take out orders etc. The bartenders are always nice though and the place is staffed by some of the most attractive women I've seen in all of New York. Definitely a great spot to take a client! Perhaps not so much for a date... gentlemen you've been warned. Although to be honest, I'm not sure why you would want to take a women here.

Despite a) being a non-steak eater and b) having the typical New Yorker bias again chain restaurants, I'm a fan. I'm easily here 4-5 times annually and have also dined at the Houston location. The good: Ambiance in this former bank building  is great, although very loud. It's definitely a boys' club type setting, so if your ladyfriend is a carnivore, try STK or BLT instead. Great business dinner venue whether you're cutting a deal or celebrating the last one. Food is great. Everyone I've seen order the bone-in ribeye or fillet leaves happy. As a fish eater, I can vouch for the sesame crusted tuna, the salmon (great greek sauce) and the scallops. They usually have a fish special (eg, swordfish) to mix it up. Sides are the standard fare. Portions are humongous, so I've never made it to dessert. The ehhhhh: Service is good, but *sometimes* (read: depends on server) can be a little rushed and/or pushy when it comes to upcharges. You don't necessarily need it all lathered in truffle oil or a 75-pound lobster cut up for the table. Otherwise, very professional and versed in the menu. The ugly: My single biggest pet-peeve with the DF franchise regards wine mark-ups. Those in the know will believe me when I say a standard wine mark-up is 2X list price. DF is at 3X almost across the board, and was also the case in Houston.  I've never been there EXCEPT on an expense account, but I find this annoying.

4.0,11/25/2011,"My monthly brodate took three-fourths of Team Top Gun (Maverick, Iceman, Merlin) to Del Frisco's. Every New Yorker has seen the Del Frisco's commercial from sitting in the back of a taxi cub, inebriated or not. You know the ad, it's the one where the manager goes ""Welcome to Del Frisco's"" and the scene pans into a wild, rambunctious crowd of financiers handling their wine glasses dexterously as they chitchat about the Euro debt crisis and whatever hot current event might be on their minds.   To be honest, whenever I see a restaurant shamelessly plug their establishment, I think overrated, otherwise, why would they even need to use ads? Anyway, that isn't the case with Del Frisco's. Our dinner was great, but there were definitely some kinks that had to be worked out.The waitress was extremely nice and patient, going through all the specials and explaining some of the more ambiguous dishes. We ended up ordering the crab cakes and calamari Shanghai style for appetizers, Filet 12oz, Prime Strip 16oz and Prime Rib 16oz for entree and spinach and onion rings for sides. We also ordered a 2008 vintage Cali Pinot.First, our appetizers came out, which was a bit confusing since wine is usually the first thing served. Anyway, the calamari was better than the crab cakes, which I believe are overrated. The calamari were flash fried then stir fried with a teriyaki glaze, bean sprouts and cilantro. A nice change of pace from the calamari at other steakhouses. I found the crab cake to be meaty but lacking in flavor.Our wine finally arrives and it's the wrong vintage. We received the 2009 instead. With a shake of his head, Kazansky graciously accepted the wine. I think we had good cause to send it back, but the waitress had been very courteous and apologetic to this point. Our entrees came out and they were gorgeous cuts of meat. Iceman's filet mignon was the best of the bunch - tender, moist and thick. I had no complaints about my prime rib either and Merlin's strip was cooked to specifications - black and blue like nothing you could find at Outback. We also ordered two sauces - one mushroom based wine reduction and another foie gras butter. Both sauces were unnecessary and our steak could have done fine without. The foie gras butter was really just sliced foie gras with maybe a butter glaze. Nothing amazing.The sides were above average. The aptly-named spinach supreme was creamed spinach with bacon bits, an easy way to improve any dish. The onion rings were stacked like a jenga game, lightly salted and crisp to the bite. However, it was served without any condiments, so naturally, I asked innocently, ""What do people usually get with this?""The waitress responded, ""Ketchup."" Thanks, Sherlock. I was hoping for something more exciting, like HONEY MUSTARD. My friends definitely got a quick laugh out of that obvious question.Anyway, the dinner was filling (we didn't finish everything) and we had a great time. I oscillated between a 3-star and a 5-star review. On one hand, the steak was amazing, some of the best cuts I've had in NYC. However, the mess-up with the wine and the overrated sides and sauces dinged the restaurant. In the end, I went with 4-stars because of the quality of the food and the amicable floor manager came by to chitchat with us, which is always a plus to have a personal conversation with a manager when the restaurant is packed.",1,1,1,Larry L.,"New York, NY",357,187,103

First time was in 2009 on our 3rd dating anniversary and this time we were on our honeymoon. This place has NEVER dissapointed. Yes you may rack up a sizable bill in the course of your dining, but every taste and flavor is worth it. During our recent visit we were waited on by Ben, who was awesomeness personified. He made sure our every desire was met and hooked us up with comped champagne and dessert cocktails to celebrate our marriage.     I had the seafood soup as an app (delish), while my husband had the ""turtle"" (really steak, not turtle) soup which was very flavorful. For our entrees I ordered the melt in your mouth, perfectly cooked rib eye that I still think of to this day (it's been almost 3 weeks lol) and the hubs had the trio filet which are a bit on the smaller side and come with various sauce toppings. His was tasty, but if I had to choose, I'd definitely stick to a big juicy rib eye or new york. Our sides, creamed spinach and lobster mac and cheese were great accompaniments, although the mac was a bit  salty.  And all washed down with good bottle of Robert Foley red wine...   All in all, it was another great meal and we can't wait to go back.

Been here several times and I am a steak buff who can honestly say this is the best steak I have ever tasted. Ever.This is an account of my latest venture there.We start off with the regular appetizers:1) Crab claws were delicious and pre-cracked for our convenience. 2) Crab cakes are perhaps the most delicious appetizer there is. Filling, only three to a plate though. I think the sauce is what makes them so appetizing.3) Oysters on the half shell: Perfect. Just perfect. Served with three sauces and cute bottle of Tabasco the size of your fingernail.By this point me and my party of three were feeling very stuffed and worried about whether we'd be able to finish the steaks we'd ordered. No worries there.My New York strip -ordered medium rare- was obviously marinated to perfection, and then grilled to my exact specifications. Each mouthful was a tender, chewy delight. Little to no fat on it. I'm not a huge wine buff but we each had a glass of house red and enjoyed it very much. For sides we had the roasted potatoes and onions and onion rings, but we couldn't finish very much of either.We couldn't have any dessert but we ordered two of their seven-layer lemon cake slices and those were divine the next day. Creamy and lemony without being overpowering.Service was impeccable and always with a smile. Waitstaff were well-dressed, witty without being presumptuous and did not lead us astray with their suggestions.My only complaint (and it isn't enough of a complaint to warrant dropping a star) was the wait at the door. We had a reservation for 9pm and ended up getting to our table at just past 9:20. The lady at the front was also not very understanding about it. However, after a meal like that I can barely remember what she looked like much less what she said.If I were told I could eat exclusively from one restaurant until my (admittedly probably imminent) death, it would be Del Frisco's.",0,0,0,Ahmed K.,"Washington, DC",40,6,0

There was no bacon in the creamed spinach and the Lobster Mac & Cheese lacked flavor. Maybe some truffle oil would help. Wait staff was attentive. After spending $300 for two, I expect spectacular for such a well known restaurant. Best ribeye for me so far is Keene's in NY, Capital Grill in Providence and Miami, and Morton's in Stamford, CT.

To make this easier I've listed my dislikes below:1. For a 4 star restaurant you get 1 star service. I have to say nothing is special about. You order and they slam the food on the table. I've gotten better service at Outback.2. Food - a salt party. For every steak they must use a pound of salt and their cuts aren't really that great. About 15%-25% of fat on a 16 ounce ribeye that costs     56 dollars.3. Seating - 11 dudes jammed in a table fit for 8. I played footsy with the guys next me.4. Crowd - 35 and older. I'm surprised the salt hasn't given them heart attacks.5. Drinks - example: lemon drop martini - sky vodka with whatever mix. 16 dollars. Seriously Sky Vodka?!?!? A bottle doesn't even cost that much in a liquor store! Btw I had one anyway and it sucked. At least put some ketel one.11 steaks, 18 stone crab claws, 24 oysters, 5 crab cakes, 2 bottles of wine and 8 sides = $2,900.00 with tipIf you want to blow some money on a very unimpressive restaurant where you probably regret it later this place is for you.

On a Wednesday night, this place is jam-packed - so I would definitely recommend making a reservation if you want to come here just for kicks, and maybe dress more in a smart casual fashion (this was a power business crowd here this evening). The waiting staff was helpful in making sure all of us got served despite having a large party, and they were pretty knowledgeable about the items on the menu as well. One thing to note about the atmosphere here is that it is very loud - the person across from me at our wide table would have to yell to make sure any of us heard what he was saying.As for the food - some things were done very excellently, while others could've been better. The bread served at the table is wonderful - very light, freshly baked, and it tastes divine with butter...very easy to fill up on it. The seafood appetizers were a mixed bag, unfortunately - while the crab cakes were very delicious, the oysters were so-so, and the tuna tartare was definitely below average...the fresh didn't taste fresh or well put-together at all. The main course made up for it, though...the 12-ounce filet was delicious and well cooked with plenty of natural flavor. I got the bernaise sauce but hardly used it because the steak was so well-prepared. The side dishes were decent - the potato au gratin was cheesy but not overly so; same with the creamed spinach. Dessert was a bit overpriced, but the souffle cake was tasty - it didn't have as much hot, gooey chocolate inside as I like, but it was still pretty good. The 6-layer chocolate and lemon cakes were pretty good as well (I took a bite from others), but the slices are gigantic...so be aware before selecting it off the menu.All in all, it was a good experience that I'd come back for. If you want a drink, try their VIP (vodka-infused pineapple)...I'm not much of a mixed-drink person nowadays, but this was extremely well-done; the aged pineapple covers up the burn of the vodka. Wines are overpriced, but that's why I usually don't go for bottles on my own.

A secret item a la In N' Out animal fries) is also incredible- the cake is moist and is topped with a sweet and tangy cream cheesey frosting.  If you want to avoid dropping mad cash, come during lunch and order the business lunch- a 3 course prix fixe that includes a salad/soup, choice of steak or salmon (6 oz filet mignon if you order the steak- just the right size in my opinion) with a very generous portion of deliciously buttery, herby mashed potatoes, and a choice of dessert (cheesecake or chocolate mousse).",2,0,0,Jen H.,"Mountain View, CA",106,366,2997

Went on a Saturday night, definitely a touristy spot since it's near Rockefeller Center but had reservations so we got the perfect table upstairs. Ambiance, friendly-attentive staff, everything was great.Appetizer: Crabcake IS A MUST. It melts in your mouth.  Not your typical type of crabcake since there's hardly any breadcrumbs and more crabmeat. First bummed about the size of the crabcake but it definitely is the right portion since you have your entrees.Caesar Salad - delicious!Entrees: 8oz Filet Mignon MELTED in my mouth. Ribeye was the juiciest thing I've ever tasted. The meats here are so flavorful and what stands out about Del Friscos.Sides: Lobster Mac & Cheese IS A MUST and Supreme Creamed Spinach which had bacon bits.  I wasn't too fond of the bacon bits but it did give the creamed spinach the perfect amount of flavor.I had the pineapple infused (VIP) martini and that was spectacular although a bit pricey for a $16 drink.All in all, great experience.

I took 2 of my BFFs here and we had a great meal. For TEN YEARS I've been gushing about how amazing the food was, dreaming of the day I'd be willing to hack off an arm and leg for a meal there.Last week, for my birthday, my wife made that dream come true (the meal part, not the paying with body parts part).We had reservations, but since there was a tiny wait, we started off with cocktails at the bar - 2 Hudson Whisky & ginger ales. They came out to $48 - pretty pricey all things considered. The bartender initially thought my wife said HENNESSEY, but then she nodded when she repeated the order the second time so we figured she understood HUDSON - based on the price, probably not. Whatever she put in the drink, it was damn smooth.We were called to our table not long after, so we sat and nibbled on the fluffy sesame bread, checking out all the corpopimps charming their clients and mistresses/loverboys into submission with meats. Our appetizer choice was the crab cake - absolutely nothing but crab, and so delicious. For our entrees, we shared a rib-eye and the mashed potatoes. The fatty slab was perfection on a plate. Soft, juicy and so perfectly meaty. It was so much meat we could barely make a dent in the potatoes, which were so creamy and flavorful.Dessert - lemon cake. Dense like a pound cake, it melts-in-your-mouth and is perfectly lemony without tasting bitter or eggy (commonplace with lemon curds).

We got crab cakes for an appetizer and asparagus as a side. The crab cakes were good and it came with a tasty sauce, but it's a tiny app that is probably meant for 1. I loved my entree but we both felt like the steaks were a little bit on the saltier side. I tried a piece of the double eagle strip but after eating filet mignon, there isn't much of a comparison in the tenderness. The asparagus was really not good at all. They looked dry and limp. Definitely not worth the price. I would think steakhouses could use the beefier type of asparagus instead of the cheap thin ones that cost like $2.99. I ordered the VIP which is a house infused pineapple with citrus vodka. It was really good but not as strong as I would expect from a $16 martini. Overall, it was a really nice experience.

4.0,6/17/2011,"Based on the food alone, Del Frisco's was top notch. I had the 12 oz fillet and while I know fillet Mignon isn't the best cut of beef on their menu I do have to say it was extremely tender and well seasoned. I order my steaks medium rare and occasionally a medium rare steak can be a little tough to chew due to the fact that it isn't cooked all the way through but this fillet was like butter, excellent. Normally I have to add a lot of salt to my steaks to bring them up to my preferred salt level but this was seasoned with basic salt and pepper perfectly, no extra seasoning needed. I accompanied my steak with an order of the asparagus which was equally tasty and cooked to a nice crisp al dente.The restaurant itself is a large beautifully decorated establishment that echos classiness with rich woods, dim lighting, and classical steakhouse attired staff. My only gripes and this is purely my own opinion is that everything is served a la carte which by most classical steakhouse standards is the norm. However, in my own personal opinion if I'm paying $50 for a piece of meat, should I really have to throw another $10 for some asparagus? I know that's the way it goes at places like Ruths Chris, Morton's, and Smith and Wollensky but its just my own opinion.Other than that, great place to go in a large party or with a date, food is excellent, atmosphere is welcoming, and service is friendly.

2.0,5/31/2011,"Came here on a Saturday evening, 8pm reservation for a party of 8.  About 8:45, the hostess brings us up the winding staircase and proceeds to sit us at a table that accommodates no more than 6 people.   After a nice lengthy chat with the manager, we finally get moved to an appropriate table.We order a bottle of the Rafanelli Zinfandel, which was $95 (certainly not cheap) and then are told that the only bottle in our price range was a $110 bottle.  We asked for 4 glasses and then the server proceeded to bring us 2 bottles, just in case we wanted another.  I really don't like the hard sell on the wine, especially since the 4 wine drinkers didn't know if they wanted more than 1 bottle.  When the check came, we were charged $110 for the wine - in my past experiences, I have never been charged at the higher price, when the lower priced bottle is unavailable.As for the good, I am watching calories, so I didn't order anything too exotic - tomato and onion salad, filet and steamed broccoli - the steak was well seasoned and cooked nicely.  The appetizer was nothing memorable and the steamed broccoli was a little under, but you can't expect much from steamed broccoli.  I took a small taste of the creamed spinach with pancetta - and it was incredible.  My wife raved about the onion rings.Be prepared to spend a lot of money here.  One bottle of wine and about 6 mixed drinks were ordered at the table of 8 people and the price tag was $250 per couple.  They upsold side dishes, bringing multiple orders to the table without us asking for them, which increased the bill quickly.  Most of the sides were barely touched since there was so much food.  IMO, on the weekends, this place is a tourist trap.  Although the food was tasty and our server was polite, the upselling of the side orders and the seating fiasco left a sour taste in my mouth.  There are too many other good steakhouses in the City.  $125/person for steak and a cocktail is on the high end, even by New York standards.",2,0,0,Lee M.,"New York, NY",48,270,5

We go big here or we don't go at all. Onwards....We came here for yet another Steak Night with the Ol69Er Steak Club. For the most part everything was excellent and well put. The Appetizers were of particular merit. Having the great Crab cakes and giant crab legs, both fresh. And the beauty of a tomato mozz salad, indeed quite good. The steaks cooked properly and served in a manner appropriate for the price. Even the service speaks volumes and the bread insane super duper good. a 5 star experience. All around. The kind of experience you would expect at a 5 star steakhouse..... So, why not 5 stars ????Well The seasoning on my steak seemed a bit off.... That is to say, not enough salt to crust and char. So my fillet was a little limp. Now normally I would just laugh this off and happily eat. But after being to all the great steakhouses around NYC I can safely say. A misstep on any steak at a steakhouse anywhere in the city of NYC is a major faux pas and thus is a major negative no matter how good or bad all the other aspects are. So this is not my favorite steakhouse in the city. I will stick with Peter Lugers OR Ruth Chris. Cool waitress' though........Peace in the middle east.",2,3,1,justin p.,"Jersey City, NJ",74,247,11

It was delicious. I had four of them during the night, but with the ludicrous amounts of food, I was never intoxicated.The crab cakes are outstanding. The sauce is delicious.

The onion rings were humongous.I had a bone-in rib eye that was perfectly cooked. Mashed potatoes were very good too.The chocolate cake was good, but the lemon cake was really amazing. I would never think to choose it over chocolate, but a definite must try.The staff was very accommodating, helpful, and friendly. I thought it was funny that the bathroom had black fixtures.

The leftover steak was still good 2 days later...lol.3) Creamed spinach - I normally don't like creamed spinach, but this was not bad so I assume it must be awesome for everyone else.4) Potatoes au gratin - nothing overly special, though not bad.  Probably a little too heavy in addition to trying to finish my entire steak.5) Lobster mac & cheese - YUMM...'nuff said.My sister had a filet, which was cooked perfectly, but I thought my ribeye was more flavorful.  My friend had the NY strip, which he thought was excellent.We had a great pinot noir that was recommended by the sommelier, and it just topped the meal off perfectly.Extra points for great service and also for our waitress for bringing my sister a complimentary dessert (we had the 6-layer chocolate cake topped with a candle).  The cake slice was so huge that all 4 of us had plenty and still couldn't finish it (and it was delicious).Def be prepared to splurge (and overeat), but it's totally worth it.  It's unfortunate for all the steakhouses from now on will only be compared to this one...hope I won't be too disappointed.",0,1,0,Tricia R.,"Ballwin, MO",41,231,0

I asked that it come seared on the outside and raw in the middle, which the waiter said was optimal since the tuna was sushi-grade.  It did not come as I requested; rather, it was overcooked for one thing, and did not taste of sushi quality in the least.Everything comes a la carte, so we ordered four sides amongst ourselves:  broccoli (boring), spinach (didn't try it, but the others said it was too buttery), homemade potato chips (really boring) and mashed potatoes (totally boring).  (Do you see a trend here?)Hey, come on Del Frisco's, stop playing it safe and start adding some spice to the food!  This shouldn't be where you take your grandma on her day out from the retirement village.  At this rate, though, that's about the only occasion on which I would return.My recommendation:  go across the street to City Lobster, which might not be as fancy, but you pay less and get better tasting seafood.",0,0,0,Suzanne L.,"New York, NY",9,61,0

4.0,3/28/2011,"I went to Del Frisco's on a co-workers recommendation to have a nice steak dinner with the family. Being that I work in midtown this was a logical selection as far as location goes. The place in itself is very open and has a very nice decor. The only downside is that it gets too loud and most of the time you cannot hear anything people at your table are saying. As far as food goes it was excellent. For appetizers the crab cakes, and the seafood platter were really good, especially considering that this is a steakhouse and not a seafood place. For the entree I ordered the Filet Mignon on the bone, yes on the bone. I had never heard of sth like that before so I went with it. I was very satisfied. The meat was cooked to perfection. It was a perfect pink medium rare and it just melted in the mouth. Very little seasoning so as to not overpower the taste of the meat. The bone also gave it a lot of flavor. My father ordered the Filet Mignon medallions in three different types of sauces and he was very satisfied.The sides however were nothing special or memorable. The creamy spinach was ok, and the mashed potatoes were kinda flavorless. But the taste of the meat just made me not really care about the sides. I was also very happy with the service. our waiter was very attentive and very professional. Definitely one of the best waiting services in a steakhouse. The only downside to the place is that it is very pricey $$$$. I will definitely go back whenever I have $800 to spend on a dinner for 4 again. :) Personally the Filet Mignon at Del Frisco is the best piece of meat I have had in a steakhouse. Definitely better than Ruth Chris', which incidentally I had been just a week before going to Del Frisco's.

The seafood platter, and the stone crab claws were clean, and tasty. Both the porterhouse for two and the filet mignon were perfectly cooked. The porterhouse was buttery and full of flavor, and the filet mignon was delicate and tender. The sesame crusted tuna was also another big hit, I think its the best version of the dish I've had. So why am I giving this 3-stars, an ""a-OK"" as dedicated by yelp? First of all, this is a very tight spaced restaurant. It's rowdy, tight, noisy, and felt disorganized the whole time we were there. Second, there were so many corporate suits dining here that we felt our table was the only one dining on personal expense, while everyone else in the restaurant had their corporate Amex card ready for swipe.

Have you seen my friends?"", not the way I want to celebrate Daylight Savings.Once upstairs, we were seated at this ridiculously large oval table and I immediately hated the seating. I was raised by a brood of Italians and I want to seat with elbows touching and where I can actually see the person across from me. Our waitress was a dead ringer for a young Judy Garland and when asked by my friend, she uttered the classic   'I am a Model/Actress.. whatever"" line that you so often hear in NY and LA. loved it. She was very attentive and clearly enjoyed being flirted with by my friend.At this point I decided this was going to be a night that I would have all of my favorites the god-like Hendricks Martini (now rockin' number 3), Asparagus, Oysters, some sort of yummy potato dish and a Porterhouse T-Bone (medium rare only!!). Luckily there were a couple of us that wanted Oysters so we got both the West Coast and East Coast ones. I devoured the West Coast ones, so yummy! Sorry East Coast you have lame polluted Oysters. Next Asparagus, Ugh!, people who run Restaurants, Can you please ONLY grill them! These were undercooked and clearly made in Microwave blech! This dish was clearly not worth the smelly pee at 3:00 am (I mean 4:00 am!!). On to the main course, Meat. The Steak I had was probably the best I've had in several years, I mean melt in your mouth perfection, cooked exactly medium rare with the right amount of juicy seasoning. This saved my night! Of course to finish the night I decided to break my only 3 martini rule and have a 4th, bad idea!. It was made with too much Vermouth and not Dry like I like it, so I figured it was Gods way of punishing me by having a 4th. Overall the place was fun and had an interesting vibe but definitely not worth the mortgage you need to pay for this dinner (obviously the Steak was the exception!).",0,1,0,Tom P.,"New York, NY",30,8,0

5.0,3/8/2011,"I have to say I liked this place alot.The waiter was very friendly, and very helpful.I had heard the crabcake was very good, so I tried it, and can confirm, that yes, it is deserving of its reputation.I had 2 bacon strips, not realizing how big they actually were, and was pleasantly surprised by their size, in quality, I would rate them as being just as good as Peter Lugers, and they may even have an edge, since they are bigger.The steak, was fantastic, nice, meaty, and juicy, and made exactly the way I wanted it, medium rare. The mashed potatoes (or their version of it), was also much better then I had expected.This is definitely what a high end, top notch steak house should be.Note: This is a money crowd, and when I say money, I mean, CEO's, bankers, and the like, if you have some kind of insecurity or feelings of inferiority or envy/jealousy issues, then, avoid this place, you won't be able to enjoy your meal and keep in mind, that the prices are reflective of the quality and the clientele of this establishment.",0,0,0,Sonny M.,"Brooklyn, NY",202,27,0
3.0,3/7/2011,"Del Frisco's is a loud and obnoxious steakhouse in mid-town New York. The service is brash and everything felt extremely rushed. The food quality is A-OK. We ordered a rib eye and fillet mignon and both were cooked to perfection. The quality of the beef was excellent, although they did not have a peppercorn steak perfected. When I asked about a peppercorn steak (flambe if you will), they responded with a plain, ordinary peppercorn sauce (scoop it on style).The starter consisted of the ever so popular crab cake. The crab cake was not amazing, but I have to say quite different than what you would find in San Fran or Baltimore. The difference was that the sauce had a spicy tang to it, making it fun and interesting.The sides consisted of broccoli (good and properly cooked), creamed spinach (with bacon) and a mashed potato.The wine list looked solid and we ordered a bottle from the Russian River Valley (California). It went perfectly with the meal.For dessert, we ordered the chocolate cake and the cheesecake. Both were solid and A-OK.Overall, good food and horrible service/ambiance.Good luck in mid-town NYC!",0,1,0,John I.,"Toronto, Canada",10,576,2
5.0,3/4/2011,"For my 400th review I need to write about one of my classic favs. Del Frisco's and Peter Luger's are tied as my top steakhouses. Del Frisco is located in proximity t many other steakhouses but it is by far one of the best. Try to get a booth upstairs, it's a lot more cozy. They have an awesome wine selection. The last time I was here I went with one of my besties. We had a delicious pinot nior. Of course I started with the crabcake. Del Frisco's crabcake is one of my all time favorite crabcakes. It's super well seasoned and not as breadcrumby as many other ones are. Omg I dream about those crabcakes. They are the best. My friend had the rib eye while I ordered one of the special cuts of the day, a bone in filet mignon which was red to the edge perfectly medium rare. It was so awesome I almost finished all of it. The creamed spinach with bacon and mac and cheese are also phenomenal fatty sides to get. This time I was too full for dessert but I did manage to stop and it get banana pudding from Magnolia to eat the next day.",8,2,6,Sascha M.,"New York, NY",593,822,7

4.0,2/21/2011,"For my birthday last month, my loving sister decided to take me to Del Frisco's for dinner with my girlfriend Judy L., my sister's boyfriend Allen W. and my brother Jason C. in tow. Weather wise it was quite awful as I was getting pelleted with balls of hail from the walk from the train station. We just happened to be out during one of the many freakish NYC snowstorms of 2011.When I finally found the entrance, I was immediately transported to a completely different atmosphere. It seemed as though the dirty, snow ridden streets of New York City I was just walking through were miles away. The atmosphere inside of Del Frisco's was warm and inviting. The dim, but not to the point of romantic, lighting and the wafting scents of steak made me feel right at home.We ordered our drinks; Ginger Ale all around and a glass of Chardonnay for my sister's boyfriend. They then brought a basket of breads and butter before taking our orders. The bread was exactly how I like it, crusty on the outside and soft on the inside. One thing I did notice that somewhat bothered me was when they cleared the bread for our appetizers, they used the ""scraper tool"" to pick up all the bread crumbs on the table. They did this in all around the table but for some reason left my mess in front of me. I sat that wondering what I should do. Would it be ill-mannered to brush it off the table with my hand? Would it be awkward to accidentally place my hand on it and end up with crumbs all over myself? I eventually just end up brushing it off and looking around all suspicious and whatnot. For our appetizers, we had the much raved about Crab Cakes, a Classic Caesar Salad Salad for Allen, and a Tuna Tartare for my girlfriend. The Crab Cakes were definitely amazing. Each bite made me want to just scrape the entire crab cake off the edge of the plate and down the hatch. I split half my Crab Cake (I was very sad to see it go) with my girlfriend and got half of her Tuna Tartare. Definitely not an even tradeoff. While the tuna was fresh and well dressed, as was the olive oil soaked-toasty bread that it was served on, the flavors just didn't seem to mesh well. The taste of the olive oil was very overpowering. The tuna alone was great. The bread alone was great. I just didn't like them together.Move on to the main course. We all ordered the large (I think 40oz) Porterhouse Steak that was not listed on the menu. This steak was huge! We also ordered sides, which were family style. For our sides we had the Spinach Supreme (creamed spinach with bacon) and the Onion Rings. Starting off with the sides, the Spinach Supreme is just that, supreme. I've really only had creamed spinach before from Peter Luger's but this one was just that much better. It was quite possibly the addition of the bacon. Let's face it, bacon make's everything better. As for the onion rings, I'll have to pass on these. I'm not a big fan of these in the first place. All they are is a deep fried, heavily breaded slice of onion. The steaks were a bit odd. I ordered mine rare while everyone else had theirs medium rare and medium. The weird thing was that my steak weren't nearly as bloody as the others. Everyone's plate eventually was covered in bloody, beefy juices while mine stayed relatively clean. These steaks, oh man these steaks.. if I could only eat one thing for the rest of my life this would definitely make it onto the top 5 choices. The steaks were perfectly seasoned. There was a crust of salt and black pepper on the outside and juicy beefy taste on the inside. Each piece that hit my tongue was more perfect then the piece before it. After reading some reviews, I realize that some people were quite against the crust of herbs and spices while others raved about it. It seems this is a hit or miss situation but I will have to side with the ravers.In conclusion, I loved Del Frisco's. The food was superb. Some shined more then others but the steak alone definitely made up the slack for anything I didn't like. My only frustration with this fine establishment came at the end of the meal, which I must admit was partially my own fault. I had only eaten half my steak as I had stupidly filled up on bread, appetizers, and sides. A waitress came by and asked if she could take my plate. I figured that it might be common sense that with half a steak on my plate, I'd like to pack it to go. Up went my plate, up went everyone else's plates, and down they went on top of my plate. That steak went right to the garbage. I suppose at a place where a meal per person can average $100 or more, people don't often save their leftovers.Overall RatingsCrab Cakes: 10/10Tuna Tartare: 7/10Spinach Supreme: 8/10Onion Rings: 4/1040oz Porterhouse Steak: 15/10-  1/2 star for throwing out my steak!

5.0,2/20/2011,"Del Frisco's is one of my favorite restaurants in Manhattan.  It is definitely my favorite steakhouse.  The food, ambience, service and wine selection are all top notch.  The porterhouse steak medium rare, potatoes au gratin and a bottle of a red bordeaux (or 2) make the perfect meal.On one occasion, my best friend and I were considering the crab cakes for an appetizer.  Since he was originally from Maryland, he said that he doesn't usually order crab cakes out of the state of Maryland.  The server proceeded to explain how the crab cakes were prepared and the size of the crab meat in each, but we decided not to order it.  During our meal, the server brought out an order of the crab cakes for us to sample on the house.  I had to say, the crab cakes were outstanding!  My buddy agreed as well.  These crab cakes really kicked ass!I have dined at Bobby Vans, Sparks, Peter Lugers, Mortons, Ruth's Chris and Smith & Wollensky, but they do not compare.   I highly recommend Del Frisco's Steakhouse over the others.",0,0,0,John K.,"Manhattan, NY",4,10,35

4.0,2/14/2011,"Came here twice in the last month, both times for dinner. I've got to say that the experience was not as consistent for dinner as it was for my business lunches.Pre-Fixe Pre-Theatre Dinner:First of all - there is a GREAT pre-theatre dinner deal that is not advertised, but available. For $50 (not including tax or tip), you get a salad, an entree plus two sides and a dessert.  Let me just say that they do not skimp on the quantity of the food. However, the deal only applies if you have reservations for, or are going to be seated for dinner between 4 to 6pm - being seated a bit after 6 is fine (I think I was about 10 mins late for my 6 pm reservation)Hubby and I ordered one pre-theatre dinner (to share) and a separate crab cake appetizer (they have awesome crab cakes here, even if it does cost $20).The house salad was very fresh with a great balance of lettuce to tomatoes, etc. They also have this Goddess Avocado sauce, which was very good.  I believe a Caesar salad and iceburg salad were also available options.The entree was an 8 oz. filet mignon. I was actually a bit disappointed here. The meat, sadly, had a bit of a liver taste to it (which is usually caused by an improper drainage of blood from the butchering process). It wasn't super heavy, and the meat wasn't too grainy, but it wasn't the amazing experience I had come to expect and associate with Del Frisco's. Also, the steak was COVERED in pepper. I understand and usually enjoy the idea of a lightly salted and peppered steak (lightly being the key word), but the amount of pepper was slightly over the line of comfortable for my tastes. I would have said something when I ordered if I had known just how much pepper there would be, but I had gotten steaks here many times before and the added pepper had never been strong enough for me to notice it. Since we were headed to see Wicked right after wards and of course, my husband loves pouring the pepper onto his steak, I didn't make an issue with the staff (but kept a mental note to ask for less or no peppering of any future steaks). The salmon and something else was available as an alternative option to dinner.The side options included mashed potatoes, fried potatoes, baked potatoes, seasonal veggies, and some other stuff. We went w/ the mashed potatoes and seasonal veggies. The mashed was good, but nothing spectacular, but the seasonal veggies (tomatoes, zucchini, squash, etc) were really yummy. They cooked the veggies perfectly so that they still maintained a good bit of crush, without being too raw or too mushy in the middle. The dessert is awesome... We got the caramel cheesecake, and it's cold set, and absolutely melt in your mouth delicious! It's hard to explain just what made it so amazing, but all I can say is that hubby and I were both stuffed, but we finished off that cheesecake and licked the plate clean (with our forks).Second Dinner (different night):So, hubby and I came here about 2 or 3 weeks after our theatre dinner at the invitation of a friend. We decided to share the double eagle cut of ribeye/strip (whichever one it's suppose to be). This time, I was smart and asked for no pepper. Sadly, due to a mis-communication with the kitchen (our waiter was very apologetic), it was once again, heavily peppered... our friend had already gotten her filet mignon (which she very much enjoyed), but hubby and I had to wait about 20 minutes for them to make us a new steak (which they promptly did, and the manager stopped by to apologize). Our sides were creamed spinach, potatoes au gratin, and onion rings. I thought the onion rings were awesome. The potatoes were well mixed and balanced with the different cheeses, and the creamed spinach was a bit bland.  However, upon delivering our replacement steak (one not covered in pepper), the manager was nice enough to bring out a fresh (and warm) side of spinach and potatoes au gratin. This batch of creamed spinach was seasoned so much better and had a great taste. Ordered the special dessert of 6 layers of chocolate cake w/ chocolate ganache and chocolate truffle icing, etc. Sounded amazing... but the actual cake was only OK. I asked for a side of whipped cream (which helped smooth the cake out), but it wasn't anything to jump up and down for.At least they offered and took the price of the dessert off the bill (as an apology for the mix-up with the steak). I will give the servers and managers there props for handing the situation in a professional manner (they were apologetic, offered to fix the problem immediately, and did so quickly and efficiently). There was no back-talk, excuses, explanations, or rolling of the eyes (unlike that one time at Capital Grille when they had to take my steak back twice because it kept bleeding when it wasn't suppose to). Still a great place to eat, but for me, consistency is key when giving a 5 star rating, and while I would have let the events during one evening slide, two in a row is just not quite good enoug",5,1,3,Nicole L.,"Philadelphia, PA",263,513,33

It truly is the most delicious steak I have eaten.  And they only season it with salt and pepper, but it is the most outstanding cut of beef I have every tried.  I have been here many times and I enjoy all their cuts, but the longbone is the best by far.If you aren't interested in spending $89.95 on a steak they also have an outstanding bone-in ribeye.As usual, with these places all meals are ala carte so go for the potatoes au gratin, you won't regret it.  Sides here are large enough to feed two people. If you are looking for another side the Mac & Cheese is pretty good too. Above all the service is out of this world. They really know how to treat you well. They know how to run a steak house.And finally the most extensive and comprehensive wine list ever. The list goes on for pages!

Mashed potatoes, crabcakes, macaroni and cheese, steak (juicy, flavorful, fresh), drinks - all scream EFFORT! There was no best part of the meal. It was an all around taste explosion.

Food: Waiters put too much emphasis on the 'great seafood' and crab cakes. They are very good but that's is not why you go there for, so skip it! Steaks: I love the bone-in rib eye, it melts in your mouth and that is not a metaphor. Side: any of the greens, french fries, and the mac & cheese, so good with steak (kind of wrong too). Drinks: If you want a good bottle for reasonable price, order the Reserve de la Contesse Lalande. Great value for price and pairs very nicely with the steaks. They also have interesting options in the 1.5L section of Bordeaux's. Ambiance: Upscale steakhouse ambiance but with a nice modern touch. Not as heavy old fashioned as S&W. I like it, I like the massive spiral staircase. Service: A little pushy... push to order appetizers (useless when your steak is 16 oz) and they will say the portions are for one person but just take 3 steaks for 4 ppl and you will still not finish your plate.

I actually wanted her to stop working to come hang out with us their and then after wards that's how cool she was.Upon arriving on the massive and opulent beast that is Del Frisco we were taken care of by Felix (great great guy) and another gorgeous blonde hostess at the front didn't get her name, and immediately shown to our window seating. Amanda came over took her time and spoke to us and explained everything perfectly and within the blink of an eye i had my food, a glass of pinot grigio, pieces of bread, and a bottle of voss water in front of me before i knew it.  TALK ABOUT WHAT CUSTOMER GRADE A SERVICE SHOULD BE LIKE!!! Then withing a few short minutes my Filet Mignon came out as well as my friends dishes and our sides were right there as well. My meal was the filet mignon and the sides that my friends had chosen were the spinach supreme and mac and cheese. I normally don't like mac and cheese and spinach but godddddammmnn it was sooo sooo sooo soo good. The spinach supreme was suggest by AMANDA, so why on god's green earth did i not listen to her when she suggested get the NY Strip Steak! Well at least my friend Dave listened to her and got it, and i got my Filet Mignon on. Let me just say the Filet Mignon did the job, it was cooked medium rare and the gentleman who brought it out made sure that it was to our specifications and even asked to please cut it , in front of him to make sure, awesome customer service!BUT I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO AMANDA AND GOTTEN THE NY STRIP Steak, my friend Dave cut a few pieces and let me say THAT IS THE BEST STEAK I'VE EVER HAD hands down, i am a steak carnivore man and IT'S THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST (Nicki Minaj voice) Amanda came back and talked to us for a little bit, cracked some funny jokes and legit they were funny i did Lol, then we talked sports and that was just awesome.THEN AMANDA drops the bombshell on us, she brings out the dessert menu and asked if we liked Lemon? I said eh, yeah i like it but i wasn't sure about lemon sorbet cake or is it just lemon cake? well lemon sorbet cake sounds better to me so i'll say that! She goes just trust me try it (its off menu, but she will make sure you know) OK I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE MY FIRST BITE INTO THIS CAKE, I THINK IT WAS LIKE making love and i was in ecstasy.

3.0,1/21/2011,"I went to Del Friscos this week for my boyfriend's birthday. I've heard great things about this place and was excited to go and try it. When we walked into the restaurant, it was packed and noisy. I think a company party was going on in the bar area. People have told me about the noisy atmosphere but it really was pretty noisy. After a few minutes after checking in, we got seated in a booth area upstairs, which had the view of Radio City, which I requested beforehand and it was really nice. Our waiter was very energetic and happy, which made the ordering experience enjoyable. We ordered the crab cakes and the shrimp with 3 different dipping sauces, both which were really good. However, I must admit the shrimp cocktail at Luger's was better than the shrimp here. As for the entrees, my boyfriend got the ribeye and I ordered the scallops, which was recommended by our waiter. I should have ordered the ribeye but I figured since my boyfriend is ordering the ribeye, I should get something else. Wrong.. well at least dont order the scallops. I should have gotten a ribeye because it really is amazing and the scallops were not (they were big in size though.) The ribeye was really soft and juicy. The best steak I've had thus far (the only big steakhouse I've been to is Lugers though.) As for the sides, we ordered the chateau potatoes and the king crab gnochi. The potatoes were great and had a spicy kick to them but I didn't really like the king crab gnochi. They were too doughy for me and barely any king crab pieces. At the end, the waiter bought one a complimentary lemon cake for my boyfriend for his birthday, which I thought was pretty nice. The bill came out to be $250 including tip. It was a good experience to come try it but I think for the amount of money paid, it wasn't all worth it. I really enjoyed the ribeye but their menu is pretty overpriced in my opinion.

I eat out at Lugers, Sparks, QM and many of manhattans best steakhouses on a weekly basis. This Del Frisco dinner was my best dinner of 2010.

She might sell but wasn't qualified to discuss).  I asked a few basic questions on a Napa wine they were trying to sub for a Chimney Rock and were quickly babbling nonsense.  When you have a list like they have and at prices DF charges you need a little more knowledge.  The good news we tasted the wine and hated it, $275 a bottle and we sent it back they did not flinch which is the way it should be.  DF also saw the error of their ways with our wine support and put in a true sommelier to help us.SERVICE - is good but a bit pushy.  On more than one occasion we had to get the waitress to back off.  It aint Denny's!",0,0,0,Des D.,"Corte Madera, CA",91,388,0

They even sent me a little thank you note a couple of weeks later. My steak had a bit too much pepper added. But it was well prepared. The clientele seem to be composed of business people getting off work (for drink or dinner), and tourists. I can't really put my finger on it, but the place just has a sort of stiff, impersonal, corporate feel to it. Friendly in the way the Stepford wives were (the original, not the bad remake). It's not a destination restaurant. And there are plenty of other steakhouses nearby that are within walking distance of your Broadway play. And the other places have more of a warm/ New York/ steakhouse feel.

4.0,1/12/2011,"Every year when my family visits NYC, we go to a nice Steakhouse- this year we chose Del Frisco's based on a recommendation from a fellow South Carolinian who had been. It was a good pick. I made the reservation on OpenTable.com, and noted that we had a time restriction as we were going to see a Broadway Play after wards. When we arrived at the restaurant our table was ready, and the hostess was very friendly. Upon being seated our server was with us right away, again noting that they were aware we only had so much time. We appreciated the staff, helping us get in and out with out making us feel rushed. Food- the standouts 1. Crab cake- You only get one, but the members of my party said it was GREAT. Large lumps of crab meat, with a perfect compliment of fillers. 2. The Bone In Filet- This was a special that they had, and 12 oz of perfection is the only way to describe it. The extra fat and bone in the steak gave it exceptional flavor. It is worth the price ($67) 3. The Mac and Cheese- We ordered this partially based on a review that I read here on yelp. the guy was right- it was deeeeelicious. Food- the losers 1.The only real loser in our meal was the Au Gratin Potatoes, they were really lacking in flavor. Skip them and get the Mac and Cheese. 2. The Lemon Cake- this is Del Frisco's dessert Specialty- and we all felt it could have been better. Mostly it was inconsistent. My first bite was dry. My second bit was better and more moist, perhaps a bite with frosting? the cream cheese frosting was more of a glaze, and we were just let down. We still made a considerable dent in it. Everything Else- We all had the Filet, I personally split one with another member of my party- they were cooked to perfection, but I will note that someone in the kitchen has a heavy hand with the pepper shaker. No extra charge for the split. They have a great wine list, and of course a full bar. The place was hopping when we arrived early (5:45), and was really in full swing by the time we left at 7:30. They do have a coat check, and yes there are jelly beans by the front door. The view from the restaurant is great, and it adds to the overall ambiance.",0,0,0,Ann Marie D.,"Augusta, GA",100,615,1101

5.0,11/29/2010,"It begins. You walk into the first floor of the McGraw Hill building in Midtown and you are immediately ensconced in excess.  Excessive space, oversized windows, effusive and abnormally attractive greeters and servers-the sort of thing that Tom Wolfe wrote about in The Bonfire of the Vanities-no luxury is spared, no detail left unattended, from the vat of pineapples soaking in vodka that is used to make their signature drink, to the little tête-à-tête that occurs between the patrons and the floor managers when they meet. A sly smile, a knowing glance, a little ""right this way Sir, yes Sir, the world is your oyster.""  To be fabulously wealthy and indispensably important, if only for a moment, how much is that worth? Of course, the experience would fall woefully short if the actual meal wasn't absolutely superb, fortunately, it was.  Upon our entire parties arrival, we were immediately whisked to a table upstairs, as I requested.  Within moments, our server, Frank, came with fresh baked bread, water and drink orders.  Unlike some other New York steakhouses there were no sneers when we ordered ice water instead of the 15 dollar a bottle Italian mineral water that these restaurants like to peddle on the unwary.  I mean really, the whole thing is a bit déclassé, peddling mineral water like some kind of a low rent bodega, but I digress.  Menus were passed out and recommendations were made, but no pressure was applied to us to order their high margin items or to speed it up-""take your time Sir, we are only here to serve."" Next, the wine list, it deserves a paragraph of its own, thick and heavy, a leather-bound tome to oenophilia.  A vast collection of bold California Cabernet Sauvignon and French Bordeaux nicely complemented by equivalent caliber whites and pinot noirs, a bit intimidating, so I advise having an idea of what you want before you walk in the door.  Of course, you could always beckon their on-staff sommelier who would be glad to make a recommendation-""right this way Sir . . ."" I made my wine order, a 2007 Lewis Cellar, Alec's Blend, an opulent red that I like to drink at home and a bargain at $150 in a restaurant of this caliber.  Frank quickly fetched our bottle and presented it to me with just the right amount of pomp and circumstance, not grandiloquent or overly bombastic, just right, as if to say: ""of course the bottle isn't corked, but you'll be the judge of that Sir.""  The wine was very good and a value at that price, I couldn't wait to savor the flavor of the red wine in perfect harmony with my rare steak, the anticipation was thrilling. Next, the appetizers, we ordered two of their famous crab cakes in Cajun lobster sauce and a tomato and mozzarella salad drizzled with white truffle oil.  The crab cakes are simply beyond description, absolutely perfect, and as bonus you can sop up the left over lobster sauce with your fresh baked bread.  The tomato and mozzarella salad was above average and a nice addition to the beginning of the meal, although it certainly isn't indispensable.  The manager recognized me from previous visits and comped us a fried oyster appetizer that came with two dipping sauces. This was nice, as I got to try something quite good that I would never have ordered on my own. Then we ordered our steaks and sides: Chris and I ordered the 26 ounce bone-in Cowboy Rib-eye, mine rare and his medium rare, John ordered the New York Strip, medium rare.  For sides, we chose the crabmeat gnocchi, onion rings and sautéed broccoli.  In between the bon vivant and wine sipping the time simply flew, before I knew it the steaks were brought to the table in all of their majesty.  Still sizzling on the plate, perfectly spiced with just the right amount of butter glaze it stood before me, a frisson before I made my first cut-""yes that's right Sir, check to see if it's cooked correctly and of course we'll bring you another if it isn't perfect""-but it was.  That first bite, heavenly, next, a sip of wine, a gustatory explosion.   The sides were simply decadent; gnocchi was stuffed with crab and smothered in exotic cheese.  The onion rings looked like an Ethiopian's Hula Hoop, big, thick, savory and delicious.  The broccoli was serviceable and operated more to assuage our guilt than to add to the meal. Finally, dessert, we ordered a bottle of delicious California desert wine, the butterscotch cheesecake and the warm chocolate cake with ice cream.  All were enormous; each of them was enough for three people to share and their size was only matched by their flavor.  The cheesecake was light and fluffy, the chocolate cake, rich and salacious, the perfect end to the perfect meal.",3,3,4,Anthony H.,"Manhattan, NY",6,5,0

4.0,11/27/2010,"My husband and I had dinner here before attending a Broadway show. He bought me the show tickets for my birthday, so I said that I'd treat us to a nice dinner in return. I suggested Del Frisco's because of Yelp reviews and because of recommendations from a local message board that I frequent. We arrived earlier than our reservation time but we were seated right away. The restaurant is lovely and it's a stone's throw from Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall. I'm sure it makes a lot of money off of tourists, but it didn't have a touristy vibe to it like a lot of Times Square restaurants have. The very nice waitress promptly took our drink orders ... they don't offer draft beer, and my husband can be picky about beer since he only drinks craft brews (i.e., no Budweiser or Corona or anything like that), but he got a Sierra Nevada and enjoyed it. I just asked for pinot grigio, because I don't know my wines from my elbow so that's all I drink, but it looked like they had a big wine selection.She then recited their specials for us, and she highly recommended the crab cake appetizer. My message board friends highly recommended it as well, so we knew going in that we'd probably order it. We also got a basket of tasty, fresh bread with a small ramekin of soft butter. The message board friends also suggested that we ask for the pre-theater prix fixe menu (there's a time limit, so this only works if you are eating before maybe 6 or 7 p.m.). There was no mention of this prix fixe on the standard menu or in the waitress's opening statements, but she quickly and cheerfully got us that menu when I asked about it. So, be aware that you need to specifically ask for it. The prix fixe menu consists of a house salad with choice of dressing; a filet mignon (eight ounces, I think?) cooked to order and paired with mashed potatoes and fresh vegetables, or a salmon filet; and a choice of either strawberry or butterscotch cheesecake, or chocolate mousse, for dessert. We each ordered the filet mignon, plus one crab cake for an appetizer. The salads came out quickly. I opted for the avocado ranch dressing and it was great, and my husband said his honey mustard dressing was tasty as well. The crab cake was wonderful ... not like those cheap crab cakes where all you can taste is breadcrumbs and filler. It was paired with some kind of a lobster sauce, I think the waitress said. I'm not a seafood fan but I happily ate my half of this yummy crab cake. We both got the filet mignon and we were very pleased. The meat was tender and juicy, and the waiter who brought it to us asked us to slice it to check on its level of doneness so that we could send it back if we wished, but it was cooked perfectly. We both added a little salt and pepper for additional flavor. It came with a HUGE serving of mashed potatoes that neither of us could finish. Another waiter came around with a plate of the vegetables and spooned it onto our plates, then left the plate behind for us. For dessert, we got one order of the mousse, which was served in a large wine goblet and was topped with fresh whipped cream and raspberries; and a gigantic slice of cheesecake garnished with fresh strawberries. Husband got coffee and I ordered a hot tea, and the waitress came back with a box of teabags that I could choose from. Both desserts were delicious, and we were stuffed to the gills when the meal was over. The service was fantastic - everyone was very nice, our water glasses were constantly full, and someone came to the table to ask us how we were doing every once in a while. The food was cooked well and it was tasty. The crowd was O.K. ... a lot of business people stopping by for a post-work dinner or drink (this was a Wednesday night). There were a lot of families with small children (tourists, maybe? Since we were right by Rockefeller Center and the tree was already up and the Radio City Christmas Show was playing that night), but they all seemed very well-behaved and nobody bothered us. Bring some singles for the bathroom, since there's an attendant. Our final bill (appetizer, prix fixe, coffee/tea, and one alcoholic drink apiece) was about $200. Too expensive for anything aside from a celebratory/special meal, but it was worth it for our special night out. I'd definitely recommend this restaurant to others, and I'd be glad to go back myself in the future for another special event!",3,1,1,M B.,"Newark, NJ",3,193,0

Food always matches my mood. So the food was supposed to be crappy since I was miserable. However, this was the only exception, and the steak made it all better. My filet mignon was cooked perfectly and my boyfriend's ribeye was cooked exactly how he likes it. He is picky about his steak and has sent back steaks in other restaurants. It didn't need any steak sauce. It was simply divine. The fight was forgotten. All was forgiven. This was a magical steak indeed. The crab cakes are good to start off with.

We each had large ambitions and  needed incentive so we booked Peter Luger's for four. Arriving at Peter Luger's we were informed we did not have a reservation and there are no walk ins available. Pissed off and hungry for steak, we went uptown to Del Frisco's.  Del Frisco's left us enthralled. They may not be famous for their dry aged steak but they certainly know how to treat their meat. I got to share a dozen oysters, crab cakes, and wagyu rib eye on the bone. I would not get their oysters again (Pearl's is better) but their wagyu beef was delicious. The bone infuses marrow juices into the already marbled beef, so succulent and salty. I don't think I can look at steak in the same way. We also each had a pineapple infused martini. Sounded nicer than it tasted. Seriously- if I could come here once a month, all I would eat is their Wagyu ribeye.

The place has attitude... its huge... high ceilings, lots of rooms, giant windows, leather seating, seems like it goes on forever.I took away a star because I made reservations 3 weeks in advance and we waited 45 minutes for our table. I also watched a ton of people just walk in, who obviously knew the host and/or managers and be seated right away. Obviously if you know people you get in. We were told ""5"" more minutes twice and proceeded to wait 25 more minutes. Really annoying.Filet was the best I had in Manhattan. My boyfriend got the Filet sampler (3 different pieces with 3 different sauces) and he licked the plate clean. We tried the crabcake because of all the rave. It was outstanding. The vodka 7ups were strong and pretty big. It was worth it because they were like $15 each.It was my boyfriend's birthday, the waiter asked when we sat if it was a special occasion.

Therefore, I was looking forward to dining at Del Frisco's recommended by a friend and looking on yelp.... You would expect to get high quality dining if youre dropping few hundreds for dinner! I truly felt it was overpriced w quality that was not meeting the standard... I truly was disappointed one after the other. Although Vanessa our server was quite charming she lacked experience of a true $$$$ restaurant and purely all the attentiveness really ends up not to matter if the food they serve is not too great! I saw so many reviews to try the Crabcake but it was a-ok. Shrimp cocktail- was overcooked and bit rubbery. Rare sesame crusted tuna was ok ( horseradish mayo good)but I've had same quality for Half the price. The best part was the bottle of Riesling which was one of the more lower priced under $80 which i went against the  wine connoisseur - she kept gearing me towards the  $$$$ bottles. I'm sure those are great but the one i had ended up w was quite delightful as well. Chocolate soufflé was pretty good but no WOW factor!  I'm very disappointed w my complete experience and can't believe the food did not meet my expectations. There are thousands of other steakhouses I rather dine and skip on this exact chain restaurant that it is. Atleast I tried it once and don't plan on going back.  The only thing nice about the place was the large high ceiling, space, staircase running up to the 2nd floor, bar area, and the large bowl of jellybeans on your way out!

Ok let's cut to the chase here. Thankfully, I went and it was being paid for by an expense account because it's pretty pricey, but well worth it. To start off with we had three grab legs, and the shrimp cocktail that was presented with three different dipping sauces. The shrimp was good, but the crab legs were enormous! Very meaty, and moist. I also had a salad wedge before the main course. For the main course I had a 12oz Fillet Mignon which was to die for. Cooked perfectly and seasoned with a nice pepper and garlic rub. This phenomenal cut of beef was washed down with a bottle of a nice Pinot Noir from New Zealand which was very moderately priced, but had a great taste.

My buddy had the VIP and let me just say it was weak and fruity it was like some Newb concoction sorority girls would make- pineapple juice and Vodka? Cmon. He and I hated it. His fault I suppose.  I had the Sazerac (first american cocktail to be created I learned), which was strong and very good.  I usually get Hendricks and tonic, but this might be my new go to drink. I strongly recommend it! If someone actually has it based on me, then writing for yelp makes it all worth it. As we had our drinks our table was ready, but the hostess held it while she waited for us. Great service.The food. This place is a well known chain with about 300+ reviews good reviews. What more could I add since I went there based on the reviews here.But I'll note that I had AJ Maxwells as well (one block over) and their porterhouse was alot bigger and tastier as I remember.  I had the porter medium, and my bud the DoubleEagle Strip steak. The Strip steak was alot better than my Porter, but the Strip has more marbling and flavor naturally. I stole half of his. My fault I suppose.And about this crab cake everyone raves about- I had it based on the reviews-even crab cake at lobster is great at about half the price.  So I dont get the big deal; especially when the cake is the size of a tennis ball and is $15. It was good, but save your money and belly space for the beef.So the food, place, service is all good- but it aint the best. I'll choose the more traditional steakhouses next time.  But this place has a location and flashy vibe thats hard to beat.

4.0,9/12/2010,"The inside of this place was beautiful, not that I expected any less in a restaurant where everyone was dressed up. My friends insisted the crab cake was amazing, so we ordered a couple of those. Now I know everyone loves the crab cakes (yelp.com/biz_photos/b8a-…) here, and it was certainly filled with crab--just not much of the ""cake"" part. The lobster sauce it came in was mouth-watering though. I kept dipping my bread in the leftover sauce until they took the plates away. Sorry for the blurry pictures.. I did not want to keep taking pictures in there...I am not crazy about steaks unless they are cooked amazinglyyyyy well--- and the the two steaks we ordered --- 2 of bone-in ribeye, and 3 filet mignons with different sauces-- were delicious.  Both of them were not on the menu. The ribeye (yelp.com/biz_photos/b8a-…) was tender and heavily seasoned with salt and pepper, but a bit dry. It was delicious, but did not steal my heart. On the other hand, I really loved the  4 oz. filet mignon steaks (yelp.com/biz_photos/b8a-…) with the different sauces. Each piece was succulent and flavorful. The three sauces were bernaise sauce with crab meat, shiitake mushroom, and foie gras butter. The shiitake mushroom sauce was a bit sweet, but all three sauces were wonderful. We had sides of asparagus, broccoli, mushrooms, and sweet potatoes. The sweet potatoes were reaaaally sweet, but all the sides were cooked well. I could have done without sides.Halfway through my dinner, I started to feel full... I could feel the steak sitting in my stomach, but given my dedication to food, I trudged on. Of course we ordered dessert! The huge 6-layer lemon cake is their special. The cake was very moist and the buttercream icing is lemony, but not overly so. The filling was rather nondescript. I liked it, but I didn't love it. We also ordered the chocolate soufflé and the chocolate mousse. The chocolate soufflé was warm, moist and rich. The chocolate mousse was definitely one of the better ones I've had. I've had too many ""chocolate mousse"" desserts that were plastic-y and horrible, but that is not the case here. The chocolate mousse is definitely chocolate-y and light. The service was definitely top notch. Definitely the kind of service I would expect in this kind of place.

It seems that we came at their busier time (6:30pm); the bar was fully packed and the hostesses were yelling peoples name to be seated. We gladly had reservations and didn't have to wait longer that five minutes; I was relieved. Service was friendly even though there was a bit of miscommunication; I give them pluses for dealing with such a busy venue and still show some genuine smile here and there. Food wise, I can't really say much for the Steaks due that I didn't have any; but my party seemed to really enjoy their options. I had the Salmon which was cooked just the way I wanted. Size here does matter, every dish could be share, specially the side orders which are quite good. I love their cocktails; I had many margaritas in the city and I can attest that this one is pretty good.

I would say its up to par as the bone in filet mignon. It had a decent amount of fat on the outside to lick in the juices of the perfectly cooked meat. The grilled asparagus, creamed spinach, and sauteed mushrooms were awesome. The cauliflower was okay too.The 2nd night i tried the bone-in ribeye, their signature cut. I also got that medium rare. For apps, we got a trio of shrimp with different sauces, we got some east coast/west coast oysters, and some crab cake for the table. THe star of the appetizers were the crabcakes. It was not bready, and the crab was very lumpy. They added some veggies to add some crunch to the dish. It tasted fresh, and it was great. The trio of shrimp came with 3 sauces, all were good. The oysters were solid but nothing spectacular. The bone-in ribeye was cooked medium rare, but more medium than my 2 previous steaks. The steak is very fatty, so avoid it if you dont like the fat. I thought the steak was flavorful and great but I still prefer the filet and strip over the rib-eye here. I had the asparagus and creamed spinach again, both were solid.

This was the greatest piece of steak I've ever had, and I've had it all over the world... well at least all over the city.It's a cavernous venue with 30+ foot ceilings. I believe there was an ""upper deck"" but we were seated on the main floor, staring out of the floor to ceiling glass walls looking out into 6th ave in midtown. We saw a lot of business dinners of the Wall Street variety here. Fitting because the bill is of the expense account variety as well.

I've been to nearly all other steak houses in the city and I still have Del Frisco's as the benchmark. It was cooked to perfection, juicy, and very tasty.

Sides ordered were macn'cheese and fresh veggies.  The mac 'n cheese (given I'm a complete and die hard mac'n cheese fan) was not good.  It had too much cheddar cheese; not enough of the other cheese blends and since the cheddar was so over powering, it was too salty.  The veggies were simple, nothing special...not impressed.   Now our entrees- my husband's ahi was OK....nothing spectacular.  My rib eye was very good, mine was probably the best out of all our entrees and my mother's pork porterhouse was dry.  For dessert, we ordered their 7-layer(?) lemon cake- ehh...nothing to even worth mentioning any further.  Their coffee....again, ehh...make better brew at home.   Basically after our Broadway Show, this wasn't what I was expecting for a great ending to a great show.  The dinner was at best 3 stars and the service, around 3.5....Maybe I'm being a steak-house snob, but this place did not impress.  Next time I'll have to second guess some of my fellow yelper's reviews...as this time, it did not meet the high expectations I had.",6,3,3,Angie I.,"Danville, CA",59,172,27

I learned about their $20 crab cakes via Yelp, so our table got 2 -- hubby & I shared 1. I love any & all sauces/gravys and this one was one of the best. I should've ordered one for myself, but the 5th guy was our friends' friend we just met a few moments ago, so I had to act civil...but I still soaked up all of the sauce with the mediocre bread. The only reason it's not THE best crab cake is because there's no deep frying bread crumb crust action?! (And I'm known for peeling & eating only the fried BATTER off calimaris & onion rings, leaving the octopus & onion to be disposed of.) But the crab cake was still darn delicious considering it was ""healthier.""Speaking of onion rings, one thing we regreted not trying were DF's onion rings. As I just mentioned, I'm not a fan of onion rings, but I wanted to try those because the table next to us ordered 2 and they came out in like mountains! HUGE! All we had for sides were mushrooms and mixed vegetables, which I didn't touch but everyone else finished them. Oh and our friends also got 2 turtle soups as appetizers which they loved (since they had it at Del Friscos in Houston, Tx before.)Now to the good part: Hubby & I shared their special Bone-In Wagyu (Kobe) 32 oz for $100. I loved it, especially the char crust. Our couple-friends shared the Bone-In Ribeye, and their friend had the Porterhouse, which they all also tore up.

3.0,7/12/2010,"""WOULD YOU LIKE FRESH PEPPER?!! Said from a young Adam Sandler holding a manual pepper grinder. This is how I describe the flavor of Del Frisco's from the SNL skits -  Look it up on YouTube. There is black pepper spice on the steaks of course, and also on the sides that we ordered on the giant onion rings, creamed spinach, and scalloped potatoes.Thank God for no pepper on the chocolate soufflé! As my girlfriend said, the dessert is the best part of the dinner. This was no little souffle, order it - it is overdose for the chocolate addict. I regret not taking a photo of it, as I was busy eating it. My girlfriend and I were seated right by the window. We had a wonderful view of sixth avenue. However, she and I were treated to the dancing of the window shades. Every half hour (this is not normal), these window shades that come from ceiling that cover the long and large windows. Mind you, when this happen for the first time, we were like how nice - to create a night ambiance when the sun is clearly shining outside at 7pm. It became so annoying that the window shades went up and down like about 5 times during our meal.I got the Filet Mignon. I like it but not as much as my g-friend's rib eye! That's the steak I would tell you to order. Once you get the steak, the waiter will ask you to cut your steak in the middle and a flashlight pops out to see if you like the color of your steak.  This is the first time, I experience the flashlight moment. I find it a bit out of the ordinary and they do it because you are sitting in the dark under the shield of the window shades. As for the peppery sides, they were so-so. The onion rings are more for show and can be worn as bangles on your wrists. Remember to end the meal with the chocolate souffle. This restaurant has an elegant ambiance so it is great to for celebrations. We celebrated my new job and my friend is preggers with a boy! Great bar scene for the nine to fivers.

Got one crab cake for $20, I don't care how good crab is $20 for a tablespoon size crab cake is too much. Steak was average very dry hard to eat. Onion rings great presentation large plate massive onion rings, but, again, very hard to eat breading falls apart and the onions themselves are a little too thick.

I'm taking my review down a star, not because of the steaks (which were splendid) because of just how poor the service has gotten since our last visit.Our original waiter who took the order disappeared. The waitress who took over was beyond incompetent and annoying. She kept interrupting us as we were eating to ask if ""everything was fine"". One or two times I can understand, but she came by no less than 7 times to ask. At first,  I thought she was concerned about the food quality. But as time went on, I realized she simply wanted us to wrap it up and free up the table. It was pushy, rude and obnoxious. It wasn't like we were there for 3 hours either. Our meal lasted about an hour, maybe.Note to Del Frisco's management; please stop your waitstaff from a) interrupting meals every 2 seconds to ask if things are OK, and b) rushing people out to free up tables.

Even though there were plenty of places I wanted to try, money was apparently no object. All right with me!When I took a look at the menu and saw that all items were a la carte, and the steaks were priced as high as $89 each, I was very hopeful that I was about to embark on a Fine Dining experience. Though, as mentioned before, the servers do like to go into grand detail about the specials and the fact that anybody who walks through their doors *must* try X, Y, and Z. As if you're not getting the full Del Frisco's experience by daring to order something other than what she's indicated as the best.We did our thing and each ordered a petite filet, then ordered asparagus, onion rings, and potates gratin to share. (That was a mistake. We barely put a dent in the sides, delicious as they were.) The steaks arrived perfectly cooked and delicate, moist, and quite delicious. One of the best of my life, and I come from the midwest where steers have their own lanes on the road.The butter sauce (cognac) was a fine accompaniment (though at $10 for a melted bowl of butter with a shot, I should have knocked it back before I left).The place was packed for a Monday night, and at two stories of spaciousness, that's saying a lot. Looks like an after-work hang for the local biz crowd. Very upscale steakhouse in vibe and clientele.Overall, a decadent dining experience that I'd save for a special day.

The bartender who brought it out to me explained that I had to keep this HUGE box level until I got it home, and seeing as how they didn't have a bag to help me carry the ginormous box, I had to balance it on my arms.  This on top of the purse and shoulder bags I was also carrying.  Did I mention I had to get to Port Authority and then catch a bus.  Yup.  Let me tell you how much fun THAT was. By the time I got home, the cake looked terrible.  The icing had gotten stuck to the sides of the box as the cake has of course slid all over the ridiculously oversized box it came in.

Three of us found ourselves at this fabulous midtown restaurant on a Monday evening and were ready to do some serious chowing down. I have been doing a pretty good job of sticking to my diet so I didn't feel too guilty about enjoying a hearty steak dinner. This beautiful, huge, bi-level restaurant was jam-packed on a Monday night with a lot of groups of businessmen, a few families and even fewer couples. Our party was seated at a nice table overlooking the bustling bar on the first level. After our lovely server rattled off the specials, we placed our order. We started off with cocktails and two dozen delicious oysters. For an entree my friends shared the 22 oz. ribeye cooked medium well and I had the 16 oz ribeye since I like my meat a little more red. We shared a succulent lobster tail and a side of the yummy sweet potato casserole and nicely seasoned asparagus. The only problem I had was that DelFriscos medium well is more like a Chicago medium and their medium is more like rare. After eating a few bites I asked them to cook it a bit more.

5.0,4/20/2010,"Ah, the Man Mecca that is Del Friscos!This is my favorite steakhouse in the city.  Granted, Sparks or Luger's may indeed have better tasting steaks, if only slightly, but nothing presents the full package like Del Frisco's.  The martinis are large and tasty. The bar staff are knowledgeable and friendly.  Always start here.  It's a great introduction to the dining experience and it affords you the necessary time and vantage point to take in the beautiful setting, the grand windows and attractive company.When you get seated, order the crab cakes, tuna tartar and anything else on the appetizer list that takes your fancy.  You won't be sorry.Peruse the wine list and take ample time to consider your carnivore pleasing steak options.  You don't necessarily need it; anything will be great, it just allows you to work up the proper amount of excitement to maximize your enjoyment of the massive amount of wonderful food coming your way.NB: they have an excellent Caesar salad which is a good option to share if you're with the better half.  Clearly these have no place in a man's menu otherwise.If you order steak any more done than med rare (rare warm is my policy) or go to steakhouses for the fish, you are beyond saving so please ignore any advice here ( most of the better places will actively not accept responsibility for steaks ordered well done). Everyone else I highly recommend the bone in rib-eye or porterhouse.  The filet is one of the better cuts in the city but obviously a less flavorful though more tender cut wherever you get it.A note on the pricing. Of course cost is always a factor to most of us when going out. That said, you know what you are getting in to when going out in NYC so don't let it ruin a fantastic experience.  Also, I wish reviewers on yelp would qualify terms like ""crazy expensive"".  Just like Milos, you would think from reading reviews that Del Friscos is a Per Se level blow to the wallet.  Not so. Even with $100 bottle of wine and 3 ppl you won't get past $400. By no means exorbitant.  Also, as other reviewers have said if you request a wine they are out of, they often recommend a similar bottle (usually more expensive) and offer it to you at the price of the original bottle.One last thing, some of us have to wear ties to work. Would I choose to wear a tie for 50+ hrs a week if I didn't have to? Probably not.  Just because people wear suits you know we're not all tools.  I promise I won't yell about my last ""huge deal"" or inform you that I am ""crushing it"" if you happen to be sat next to me next time here.

Came here with the boyfriend and another couple while visiting New York. It was the Saturday night before Christmas in 2009 and a blizzard was coming. But that didn't stop anybody from coming. It was packed. Definitely make reservations. Our waiter was very nice and gave us suggestions for some wines which although the place seems to be high class, there were some bottles that were not too expensive (which allowed us youngins to order a bottle to enjoy with our meal). We ordered the crab cakes cause we heard it was a must. It was so good and the sauce was amazing. Our waiter noticed the boyfriend basically licking the sauce off the plate that he was even nice enough to bring us more sauce for bread dipping. We also ordered the sauteed mushrooms which was delicious! We ordered the special three filet mignons  which had different flavors for each and was amazing. And we topped it off with a yummy piece of cheesecake. So glad we came here!",0,0,0,Trang V.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,46,0

4.0,3/3/2010,"With ceilings as high as the prices, Del Frisco's is a great spot for an outing that your company pays for.I was the fortunate recipient of one such outing recently and observed how much I'd be spending on a lunch if it were out of my pocket.But it was on someone else's tab so I examined my pocket , removed the dust and wheat penny and proceeded to order the rib eye.And that ceiling is very high, almost cathedral like. The church of carnivores was fully in session as I awaited my rib eye. A distraction known as a crab cake appetizer entertained me briefly while I continued my pilgrimage.The crab cake was large enough for two to comfortably share and three to fight over. Top quality chunks of crab made this a tasty start to the lunch.The arrival of the ribeye was reason to celebrate. Our waiter instructed us to slice through the middle of our respective slabs of beef to verify that it was cooked to our liking. Mine was cooked as I expect medium to be, neither red nor burnt so I gripped my knife, readied my fork and took a bite.Excellent. Now for another bite. Just as good. Do I even bother with the side of scalloped potatoes? Well, it is taking up real estate on the plate so let's give it a try. Not bad either, useful for pausing from the meat feast.Bite followed bite and I thought I was well on the road to total ribeye nirvana...until I encountered some gristle. Ok, I can deal with a little bit of gristle. This was hardly a show stopper as I resumed the act of devouring.Dessert was a bread pudding doused in Jack Daniel's. Ke$sha may brush her teeth with a bottle of jack but I recommend she try this instead.I've had bread pudding in the southern states of Louisiana, South Carolina and Georgia. This sample of bread pudding was quite good for a Yankee state. Del Frisco's has a large bar area that's also worth a visit. I had a rather strong martini there on a previous occasion and you can also order from the kitchen. Bottled beers are available but cocktails are their specialty. Be warned that after work crowds will buzz to a thronging mass so finding space my be tough.

2.0,2/15/2010,"My wife and I had a tremendous Valentines Day experience at Del Friscos in Orlando a number of years ago.  It was probably one of the top five best meals of our lives.  So for sentimental reasons and over our friends urgings to try Wolfgangs, we did Del Friscos in NYC this past weekend.Just like the Del Friscos in Orlando, the place was bustling - so much so that we ended up sitting at a table partly in a aisle near the bar in both cases.  That is where the similarities ended.  The NYC location's dining room was amazing.  Soaring windows, beautiful woodwork, elaborate staircases.  It was a sight to behold.  Whereas the Orlando was small, dark and cramped.  By the end of the meal, I was longing for the more modest Orlando venue...The waiter was well intentioned, sharp and somewhat knowledgeable, but being a professional waiter clearly was not on his list of priorities.  I'm not sure if he was still smarting from being turned down for his latest role on Broadway, but his head was not in the game.  The timing of the meal was horrible.  Our apps came out before the Somalie even made it to our table with the rather expensive bottle of wine (a 2004 Rubicon meritage that BTW was marked as a 2005 on the wine list) we had ordered when we first sat down.  Then there were long droughts between appetizers and main course and we almost gave up on desert after waiting so long for our coffees (which of course we ordered at the same time).As for the quality of the food, I would wager that our waiter's singing skills were closer to world class than our food was.  The ""famous"" bread was bland and mushy.  The tomato and mozzarella appetizer tasted like McDonalds quality tomatoes with wishbone Italian dressing.  Our steaks, the recommended bone-in filets, were adequate, although mine was originally undercooked.  Again, the would-be Tony Award Winning server was off on his timing getting the re-cooked slab of meat back out after my wife was almost done with hers.  The sides were forgettable at best.  Our asparagus was undercooked and beyond bland.  The au-gratin potatoes tasted out-of-the-box fresh with a blob of cheese on top.Dessert was not worth the wait.  The special warm bread pudding a-la-mode was so cool that it couldn't melt the ice cream.  And again the dish was as bland as tofu.  Coffee was decent - hey, I guess that was the highlight of the meal!  At least they saved the best for last...We did manage to have a great time in spite of the service and food, however that was largely due to my wife's sparkling personality, which is not on the menu.",0,0,0,Vince V.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1,8,0

They were medium rare and cooked to perfection. For lunch, the salmon filet is a great choice, and the couple of martini's I've had there have been nice as well.For dates/dinners, they have a nice wine selection which is to be expected.

The service was outstanding as it always is. We started with the calamari and three orders of crab cakes. The calamari has an asian flair to it with bean sprouts, peanuts and a spicy sauce. I was excited toe finally try the famous crab cakes and they did not disappoint. They had all crab no filler and huge chunks with a complimentary lobster cream sauce. Both were delicious starters to whet our appetities.Among the mains were 3 porterhouses, 2 bone-in ribeyes, double eagle NY strip, and filet mignon. I was a little bummed that they no longer offer a Double Porterhouse, so I settled on the 24 one. It was very good, if a little tad overcooked for me (requested bloody rare of course). Still Del Frisco's delivers a very good steak. However, I enjoyed the 32 oz kobe long bone I had last time more. Everyone else really loved their steaks too.The sides were had that shined were the sweet potato casserole, mac and cheese, and onion rings. All delicious. Creamed spinach was nothing special and neither were the chateau potatoes, albeit fair enough. The maque chaux corn was also pretty tasty with bit of bacon contained in it.For dessert we had a nice spread of butterscotch cheesecake (creamy and rich), strawberry romanoff (delicious but a little too much grand marnier in the bottom), chocolate mousse (great silky light goodness), creme brulee (had a small bite cuz Im not crazy for it but ok), and their signature lemon cake which is truly amazing.We left satisfied and full.

I would come here again, I'm giving this place a SOLID 3 it is good, but needs to be taken back a peg or two in it's rating, they have room for improvement.  This is pretty good and not outrageously expensive.",0,0,0,FatmanStan F.,"Chicago, IL",200,118,105

2.0,1/2/2010,"If you like going to places where you can't hear yourself talk but you could hear the jabroni in the next table bragging about his big deal, expensive watch, or his new blah blah blah car, this is the place for you! We went here with 7 people and it was difficult to hear anyone or carry any kind of conversation without yelling at each other. After waiting 45 minutes beyond our reservation time, we were scurried to our tables as the wait staff came barreling down the narrow aisle with plates of hot food. It was a crazy scene. We ordered the seafood tower ( I think it was $60 a person). Oh but wait, they ran out of seafood, so instead of king crabs, crab claws, lobster and oysters, we got crab cakes, oysters, and shrimp cocktail. It was a disappointing tower for sure. I thought the crab cakes tasted a little funny and apparently, my body agreed. More on that a little later. For dinner we had Australian lobster. For $80 a pop, I am expecting it to be fresh and sweet. Having had Australian lobster before, this was by no means fresh. Just Eh. The steaks and sides were good, but nothing to write home about and so not worth the $50-$80 price tag. The best part about my entire meal was that late that evening, I got violently ill. I mean on the floor in the bathroom. Maybe it was the crab cakes??? I normally would not attribute my sudden illness to a restaurant that I dined at the night before, but when I came into work (late) the next day, I shared my story with my fellow diners and they all had the SAME experience. So perhaps it was a fluke that 4 of the 7 people in our party got sick, but I know one thing is for sure, I will not be going back here. Even if I didn't get sick, I would not have given this place more than 3 stars. Like other reviewers, I just found this place to be overpriced mediocrity.",3,2,0,Casmine L.,"Boston, MA",1,28,0

Soup: Had the seafood soup, what a waste of money, it was this teeny cup of soup for 10 bucks.  I didnt see any seafood in my soup!3.  Entree: Had the ribeye, the meat was cooked well but it was sooooo salty and peppery.  I could deal with the pepper, but the meat was so salty that i found myself tryign to scrape off the seasoning.  It really did ruin the meat.  When you come to a steakhouse, a great piece of meat can stand on its own, it doesnt need tons of seasoning!4. Sides: Had the mashed potatoes and asparagus.  Your run of the mill nothing extraordinary5.  Dessert: chocolate mousse and chocolate souffle:  The mousse was nice and light.  Didnt care for the souffle as much.  6. Service: Now usually i dont care about service, but the waiter was awful.  I do not like to be touched when i am eating, the upselling of items was absurd, we were already ordering tons of stuff, stop trying to force items  At a supposedly nice place like Del Frisco I would not expect this degree of upselling and pushy service!I think I'll give other steakhouses in NY a try before returning to this one.",0,0,0,CE C.,"New York, NY",3,323,0

Don't get me wrong, they were good with a lot of crab meat...but I've had better when I lived in the Boston as well as DC. I went for the bone in rib eye, which was also good....not hands down amazing. I got it medium rare, but the meat somehow ended up quite tough and slightly more medium than medium rare. Actually, my friend's filet mignon was a lot better than the rib eye. I would recommend going that route if anything. I would've rather gone to S&W or Quality Meats...As for sides, the onion rings were quite good, as were the mushrooms. I think I ate more sides than my steak. Service was good, and there is plenty of seating (since there's an upstairs as well). I was able to make a reservation day-of.Overall, I suppose I would rate Del Frisco's at a 3.5.

It was seasoned perfectly (salt and pepper is all you need for a fillet).  For sides we shared the baked sweet potato which was more like dessert (very good).  We also had the asparagus which was ok (nothing special).  For dessert we had their chocolate cake which was ok but their lemon cake was outstanding. I was thoroughly impressed with the quality of this cake.  you definitely need to share it with at least 4 people.  I think if you want to leave full you can share a side dish between 2 people.

The ribeyes have just the right amount of fat on them for a very juicy and flavorful experience. The porterhouse is overly satisfying as well...as said before, you really can't go wrong with any of the steaks here! For the apps...go with the crab cakes.

The sides are all very good to great.   (though the potatoes au gratin can be a bit too cheesy, and the amount of mushrooms you get for a side is a little lacking compared to price) The standout is definitely the Creamed Spinach.  Steaks are all great.  I used to be a porterhouse guy, and this place definitely serves a great one.  But i had the filet mignon here on the 4 or 5th time visit... and i can't go back to porterhouse steaks here anymore.  The rib eye and the porterhouse are both very good.  But damn... that filet is good.if you can't tell.. i really like this place.  if i have a special event to celebrate.. i save up and get ready to go here!",0,0,0,Steven Y.,"Bayside, NY",6,32,0

3.0,6/12/2009,"A room full of suits =  ""Power dinners.""  I was happy not to blend in.I gave this restaurant three stars because you need to take a loan out to have dinner here.  I don't think there was a single entree that was under $35, and that is ala carte (meaning you have to purchase your sides separately).  6 oysters, which were not nearly as good as buttermilk channel's were, were $17, almost 3 bucks an oyster.The steaks were good; I wouldn't say amazing, but good.  The sides were a little uninspired--the potatoes au gratin was a cheesy mess, the asparagus cooked well but lacking enough seasoning.The service, however, was excellent.  It was the kind of service in which you feel like they are reading your mind.  I hadn't had the wine list in my hand for 3 seconds before a roving sommelier was tableside asking if she could assist me.  Plates were cleared promptly but never prematurely; the table was crumbed approximately 5 times, and wonderfully so.  I used to wait tables and I wielded my crumber like an monkey wrench.  These guy's whisked our table clean in one fluid motion.  The waittress was knowledgeable and even passionate about what she served.Service is usually something you complain about, or ignore if it is good.  But this service was exceptional.The wine list is good, if riddled with astronomically expensive bottles.Maybe I was simply out of my league (thanks for paying, Dave!) but I feel like, in a recession (or any other time for that matter), it is always good to have delicious food/wine options on your menu that won't make the diner's rent check bounce.

5.0,6/2/2009,"My journey for my favorite steakhouse stops here.  I must have eaten here 3-4 times.  This steak snob must have his steaks 'rare-plus', a term an Austin waitress at Sullivan's properly schooled me on.  I have traveled high and low for the perfect steaks and Del Frisco's won me over; more than once.  These guys are on top of their steaks and no bragging right will win me over less' they really pay careful attention to the timing of their steaks grilled.I mean, when we 'rare-plus' carnivores begin to 'instruct' our waiters/waitresses just how we crave for our steaks to be done, it can be quite a mouthful.  At Del Frisco, the waiter/waitress simply replies by asking 'rare-warm or rare-cool'?....now that's a homerun.I had nearly all versions of their steaks.  The bone-in rib eye and porterhouses are still my faves.  Sometimes, I'd ask the bone-in rib eye to be cooked with a cajun spice.  yummy.For me, the spices on the steak is not my primary judgement of great meat, it's the temperature.  It happens that the seasoning used here are very very tastey without being overboard and complicated as other steakhouses made it to be.  And you certainly do not need a sauce to make up for the lack of juices in the steak either.....oh, let's not forget their onion rings.  If I can't have the steaks here, I'd get the Onion Rings for sure.  They are large Onions with a nicely salted batter that is not greasy.Be prepared to spend a pretty penny.  I make it a trip to visit often but at over $200 per person each visit, it's not for everyone.",2,0,1,Will L.,"Park City, UT",0,19,0
4.0,5/23/2009,"I'm amending my original review that I gave just a few weeks ago, because after sending my same comments to del Frisco's through their website, I feel like they're taking great efforts to rectify my bad experience.The GM, Scott Gould, of the New York restaurant called me twice the day after he received my comments, and then e-mailed me the next day when I hadn't responded.  I was out of town, so I had no idea they were trying to contact me.When we finally connected, he apologized profusely for the bad experience and offered to send me a gift certificate in the hopes that I'll return and dine with them again.  I actually told him it was unnecessary and the fact that the GM was calling to apologize for the situation was really enough for me.  And it was. But he insisted anyhow.In my book, customer service goes a long way, and restaurants like Del Frisco's are supposed to be like the Neiman Marcuses of restauranting.   The responsiveness of their New York GM put them back in my book of exceptional dining experiences.  I hope to give them 5-stars after my next visit, because they really are that good of a restaurant.------------------------------------------------------It hurts me to give del Frisco's just 3 stars right now, because I've always enjoyed it when visiting the City.  But after this last visit, I'm completely annoyed.  The food was superb as always, but that was it.  They deserve 4.5-stars for their food, but 2 stars for their service this time.The good:This time, I ordered the crab cake special for apps and my friend and I shared their special domestic Kobe longbone steak.  We finished up with their Lemon Cake.  Everything was superb.The bad:When a waitress recommends you a special that's as unusual as ""domestic Kobe longbone steak"" at $94, and you ask her simple questions about the steak like ""What's special about the steak?"" and she says, ""I don't know, but it comes on a really long bone,"" you really should just get up and leave.  We didn't because, we at least had the assurance of del Frisco's quality.  And we actually ordered it, because I was taking my friend out for his birthday and first real visit to New York.Also, we made reservations for 8:30pm and weren't seated until around 9:15pm. The surly---albeit, over-stressed---host almost sat a couple of businessmen ahead of us before I finally walked up with my ""I've had it!"" look.  The point of taking a reservation is to HOLD the reservation as Jerry Seinfeld says.For a $250 meal for two people, the pacing was horrible!  Obviously because we were seated so late, the waitress rushed us through our entire meal.  We finished it in about 1 hour.  Let me just say, you don't spend $250 to eat in an hour like you're at Olive Garden.  You spend that kind of money to enjoy your company and have time to savor great food.  The only reason why I didn't complain was because I didn't want to ruin my friend's birthday.  But I was so embarrassed because I had raved to him about how much I loved the restaurant.I might go back there again one day even though it's been an old haunt for me, but that won't be for a very long time.  I think it's time for me to try out some other great steakhouses in the city.",1,0,1,Toonces ..,"Austin, TX",27,154,13

The staff was very accomodating including Rachel, one of our waitresses. I think the steaks were great, the 16oz ribeye was awesome.

I really enjoyed the side dishes of macaroni and cheese, mushrooms, and mashed sweet potatoes. Warning: This is not the place for the faint hearted appetites!!! Wine list was impeccable!!! I loved that the waitress was on it...she knew specials, our glasses never went empty, and we didn't have to ask for a damn thang!!! Now that's service!!!

4.0,1/24/2009,"Located in the middle of midtown Manhattan (49th & Avenue of the America's) Del Frisco's Steakhouse does its job well, but without any *particular* distinction.  Still, it was good enough that we ate there twice while we were in the city, so by no means did it disappoint in any way.  Steakhouse can be a little predictable and since they are usually somewhat ner the top of the food chain (pun intended) price-wise, it would be nice if there was a little suprise here or there in the menu offerings or preparation.  The food was very good, the atmosphere is charning, the wait staff attentive.  I am just not sure if it's worth the approximately $250 you'll spend to have dinner for two (with a reasonable, by no means spectacular, bottle of wine).  But then again, all of NYC is expensive, and at least here you can, predictable, count on a good meal.",1,0,2,Adrienne A.,"Washington, DC",1220,265,48

The waiter is genuinely nice and above all attentive. We started off with oysters on the half shell, had half a dozen and they were splendid. GF got the seafood soup and I got the Beef Tomato and Onion salad. Both were very very good. The tomatoes in my salad were wow, I mean you dont usually notice the tomatoes as anything special but the great texture, juiciness and flavor had me very impressed.I ordered the ribeye and the gf ordered the strip. Both were made to perfection, usually I like my steak more medium rare than anything else but my GF's medium strip steak was absofrigginlutely melt in your mouth salivating!

5.0,1/19/2009,"As a steak lover, I am always ready to experience a new place to have a fantastic steak. My last visit to New York had me dining at Del Frisco's. Located in the middle of midtown Manhattan, at 49th and Avenue of the America's, Del Frisco's is a wonderful place to eat.With the publishing elite in and around the buildings that surround the restaurant, Del Frisco's is never not busy. A word of advice is to make a reservation before venturing to the restaurant for dinner.That is how well known this restaurant is.Now for the bad part. I happened to take my own advice and made a reservation, but lo and behold, I still had to wait to be seated! It took the restaurant an additional 20 minutes to seat me, AFTER I had already arrived! Why would anyone make a reservation if the bloody restaurant doesn't honour their own reservation time?The manager saw how long I had been waiting and kindly sought out a table for me very quickly. A little too late in my book. Del Frisco's needs to get better with their reservation system. This is clearly bad service and guest management.Anyhow, after being seated, my waitstaff was kind and very knowledgeable about everything on the menu. The wine list was fantastic and complemented the food perfectly. Once my steak arrived, it was cooked as desired and my dessert was heavenly, as true New York cheesecake is!I highly recommend Del Frisco's if you are ever in Manhattan.

For appetizers, we had the crab cakes.  I have to say, these are hands down the best crab cakes in the city. They have a side of spicy sauce to dip it into. It's great. Definitely small for the price, but it's worth it. For the main course, I had the filet mignon (medium rare). While it was amazing, I would request less pepper next time I go. It's a little much and probably would be tastier without.  My boyfriend had the ribeye, which was cooked perfectly medium rare. Flawless. He had less pepper on his -- seasoned perfectly. With that, we had creamed spinach and mashed potatoes.  Spinach was delectable. It couldn't have been any better.  So tasty! Great steakhouse... takes reservations (which you should make, even though it's one of the biggest steakhouses in the city.)  It gets packed during the weekend.. so it's a little difficult to hear if you're at a big table.

Tough id you are looking for a cozy, intimate dinner, but if you are out with the boys, or entertaining, this is the place!The apps are great, but I had the steak tare tar and it was phenomenal. cut into chunks (like tuna tare tar) rather than chopped, it provides an excellent texture as well as flavor. We also had the shrimp cocktail, and this is the only reason I did not give it 5 stars... it was over done and rubbery. We told our waitress, and it was comped (along with the desert).The steak is sublime! Perfectly cooked, and tremendously flavorful! A large, but not overwhelming filet, wit just the right amount of seasoning and marbling. The sides were great. Creamed spinach, home fries, and asparagus. All perfect.The wine list and somelier were great, with both arriving to ask if we had any questions. Great wine, not too expensive, and since it was older, decanted and poured at our table without our asking.Overall, a top notch experience! Would I recommend it? Hell Yeah! Would I go again?

At least the bacon was good.  Dinner was served @ 7:30 and we were being shoved out of the door by 8:05- huh?

4.0,11/30/2008,"Del Frisco's - as grandiose as a steak house can be. Located in the heart of midtown, 49th & 6th ave, this place makes the carnivore lover leave totally satiated.  A gigantic tri-level space with 40 ft ceilings lends air to the crowds at the upstairs and main level bar.  We arrived for our 8:30 reservation on time, checked our coats and lead to our table promptly.  The gracious hostess guided us up the colossal staircase to our spaciously comfortable booth table which somehow was surprisingly quiet considering the boisterousness of the whole place.  There were many large table parties, seeming like after work business-type dinners with predictable men in suits.  The wine list was the bible of wine lists ranging from about $50-2000 depending on what magnum you preferred. Bundled in a napkin & accompanied by a ramekin of whipped butter, a warm mini loaf of perfectly crusted bread welcomed our order to come.  I think toasty bread and easily spreadable butter is always a good clue to how the rest of the meal will be. If care is not given to the first impression, it usually leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  After we were done with our bread our server asked if we would like more & crumbed our table.  We ordered a seafood platter for two which consisted of 4 chilled jumbo shrimp, 4 stone crab claws, 4 oysters and 2 king crab legs - $54 per person.  The crab claws were the largest ones i have ever seen and the platter itself was huge enough to have at least double the amount of food that was on it.  We were happy with our chilled seafood but really how wrong can a chilled seafood platter go?   After that our meat moment, medium porterhouse with a side of baked cauliflower with brie.  The server, along with a food runner, presented our steak on a scorchingly hot plate.  No garnish here, it's all about the beef.  Our server asked us to cut the steak open to make sure it was to our liking.  A perfect medium it was.  Our waitress served our cauliflower onto our plates, mom-style. (Note all of their side dishes are served family style so the sides are extra large, made for at least two to share but also racking up the price the more sides you get)  Our cut of beef was excellent, seasoned and cooked to perfection.  The cauliflower was decadent, rich, and tasty.  Even though we were busting at the seams we had to have a bite of dessert to finish it off.  We ordered the bread pudding which was served on a plate like a large brick.  It was good but not as good as grandmas.  Overall, I think Del Frisco's is a great place for a hearty, no frills, good service, close to theatre, meat lovin' dinner. It is pricey, but that is to be expected from a steak mansion.  The space is very large, not much romance, but healthy portions of good quality food and comfortable dining tables.",1,0,1,Becky M.,"New York, NY",101,76,10

We had been strolling NYC all day, we stopped to look at the menu and after we found out what time the placed closed, it was a winner. This place has great food, but it has even better service. We found ourselves sitting in a little romantic area upstairs, complete with mood lighting and soft music. I was feeling under the weather and once we had placed our order, I felt like staying to eat was not an option. After the manager came to make sure everything was ok (service, food), they kindly packed up our meal to go and my wonderful BF carried it back to our hotel room, which was luckily within walking distance. He loved his steak-it literally melted in our mouths. The broccoli was great too, not too greasy and not too garlicy. After I felt better, I enjoyed my Filet Mignon a tad bit on the cooler side, but it was still fantastic. Sad to say they did forget our mashed potatoes but  they were not really missed.The best part was the surprise my BF had ordered for me- cake for dessert! It was a yellow lemon cake with white lemon frosting. It was really soft and spongy and the frosting was just right, not too sweet.

4.0,10/26/2008,"So when you're in New York you have to eventually meander your way into a great steakhouse that has enough amplitude that you can brag about it to both those local and those visiting. And in this city, there is PLENTY of places that fit the bill. However on this particular night, I was bellied up with a buddy of mine in Time Warner at a place called the Stone Rose enjoying a little Irish Whiskey on the rocks (killer Scotch, whiskey, bourbon, Irish whiskey, etc. selection and a hell of a view of Central Park from the lounge.) I ended up in a good conversation with a few local folks who began talking about the ups and downs of all the steakhouses in NYC. Several were mentioned from Quality Meats, BLT Steak, Peter Luger's as well as Del Frisco's.Ultimately, as we wandered out into the night I found myself walking down Broadway, heading towards W. 49th and figured...what the hell, make a quick right turn and I'll be at Del Frisco's. So it was. Walking in, it didn't feel too much different than any of the other great steakhouses I've been into throughout the nation. The view with ceiling to floor windows overlooking The Avenue of the Americas was nice and it had that moody, dark, cherry wood, ""steakhouse-a-la-carte,"" feel going. Seated upstairs, it was comfortable and we were treated well from hostess, and server to bus staff and the Manager who still managed to drop by and ask how everything was going (genuinely) despite the fact that Charles Barkley had made his way in to eat two tables behind us.Back to the food.The menu, built on prime beef and the to-be-expected a-la-carte style was an impressive spread of filet mignons, ribeyes, strips, porterhouses, lamb, osso buco and a seafood menu that was as impressive as the rest of the entree selections. Check out the menu here for greater detail: (delfriscos.com/newyork/m…) First our navigation: we opted to start with a crab cake in a lobster cajun sauce, moved to one 8 oz. filet and a Prime Ribeye both done medium rare (pink top to bottom), added a basic baked potato side and a side of the mac 'n' cheese and ended with a slice (the size of Rhode Island) of their butterscotch pecan cheesecake.Now the mind-dump: First, I know if you're working with a piece of amazing prime beef, and you can sear it at thousands of degrees at the correct amount of time, it really comes down to basic seasonings, a use of butter or oil and the ""eye"" of the chef. Well, I'm big on folks who're able to create beauty out of such simplicity. And, Del Frisco's certainly beats the pants off of Gallagher's, Morton's, Ruth Chris' and many others I've had in my day, in just that kind of way. Simple. Well-seasoned. Perfectly prepared. Nothing more needed but a knife and a fork. And everything else: the starter of fresh lumb dungeness crab cakes sitting in a subtle lobster cajun sauce (one of the best I've ever had), the basic baked potato with fresh chives and a perfect amount of butter and the mac 'n' cheese melting with smooth cheese and perfect al dente macaroni elbows is to die for. Oh, and not that I needed it as I was already trying to order either a cot and pillow combo or wheelbarrow, along came a slice (BIG SLICE) of Butterscotch Pecan Cheesecake. Light and creamy heaven sitting in a rich velvety butterscotch pecan ""pool of love."" Whew. Can anyone say ""digestif?""Obviously having only navigated this tiny portion of their menu, I can't with a good conscience proclaim this to be one of the BEST steakhouses ever. But I'd be willing to throw down the 5-star without hesitation if the rest of their food holds up to the quality I experienced this time around. And, I will certainly be back to test the oso bucco, the stone crab claws (seasonal) and the scallops.

4.0,10/6/2008,"So we had a department dinner and stayed at one of the basement rooms which held about 20 people and had the glass walls overlooking their extensive wine cellar. Located in our corporate head building in midtown, it's easy to access (right across from Radio City Music Hall). People say the crab cakes are great, I tried it and it was good but too small (about 2 tablespoons big) and they don't shred the meat too fine which is good, the shrimp cocktail comes with 3 different sauces, of course I had all since it was free!!! The creamed spinach was good, the waiter informed me that there were some small bits of bacon so of course it was good! Onion rings were huge and sort of fell apart when you tried to eat it (melt in your mouth, not in your hands deal), they have several fish entrees on the menu and I chose Salmon which was a good choice, came with a nice sauce and it was a good portion. I'm not going to mention the meat selection because the other reviews can speak for it.The desserts they serve are huge! I tried their vanilla ice cream with strawberries and other ""stuff"" on it, I can't describe it because I was almost past out from being full when the server was explaining everything and I was nodding in agreement while holding on to my c-worker's chair to keep my balance. Downside are their glasses, since they wipe their glasses dry, some have the lint from the cotton towels. So check your glass because if they used a towel that's been out a little too long, you might have it so just ask for a new one.Overall, I recommend it to anyone who wants to treat their girl out for a special occasion, it's a little tight on the main floor, but try to reserve and ask for a special location even if it's for a few days ahead so you don't deal with the people passing back and forth.",3,2,2,Edward I.,"Jersey City, NJ",67,541,11

Moreover, the salt crust was way overboard.  I understand seasoning the meat, but every time I had a bite of crust, I had to drink a ton of water and came home and ended up drinking water all night.

I did however like his smugness when he asked, like he KNEW they would be cooked perfectly.  They were.  The taste of the rib eye was great, however the salt crust was overdone and far too many huge solid chunks of fat for my taste, even for a rib eye (yes, that's where the flavor comes from but too much of a good thing, as they say).  The creamed spinach side was terrific.  Oh, leave room for the mammoth sized desserts.  The cost was pricey for the experience.  I'd go back and give them another try.",0,0,0,Manny R.,"Long Island City, Queens, NY",2,54,0

It all went downhill after I order the asparagus bisque and discovered a piece of crab in it that was not listed on the menu! Now before you go thinking I'm just another whiny Yelper I have to qualify by saying that I'm allergic to seafood, and when I asked the waiter to exchange it for salad he rolled his eyes. After that we had some sort of unspoken beef where we exchanged blows in the form of him putting 3 tablespoons of pepper on my salad and me throwing the crab I spit into my napkin on to the floor.

Nevertheless, the first half of my steak was probably in the top 3 of places I've been to.  The chateau potatoes were good with lots of crispy cheese on top. The creamed corn was decent but not spectacular. Their wine list was the longest I have ever seen, I think it was like 8-10 huge pages, the size of a regular menu.

5.0,2/22/2008,"My favorite steakhouse in Manhattan.....or anywhere, period.  First of all, dress well, it really is a ""business networking"" type place.  I've been to the one in Fort Worth, Texas.....but for some reason, always preferred a place called Taste of Texas in Houston.  Probably because it was more casual.......Then, went to the Del Frisco's in Manhattan, and I became a believer.  The bar is a great place to get started, while waiting for a table.  I must say, my friend worked out a tour of the restaurant while we waited....and it was impressive, the private rooms are very much where you want to have a business meeting......one of them is completely surrounded by the wine cellar (one of the wine cellars).  They no longer use the cigar room for what it was meant to.....but it is still there, and it is awesome.  Incredibly detailed wood work, the rail on the staircase is made of twisted steel cables.  And although it's not a very intimate setting, there is definitely a buzz running through the restaurant.  The staff is great, they knew the menu well.  There is also no need to look for them since they are always around when you want them to be.  There is wine, and plenty of it..... from the house selections to the ""holly grail"" of wine, they have more than most would ever imagine.  If you are willing to pay, they will probably have it.  There is always the house wines if you want to take it easy on the wallet, and they are also good selections. The steaks are cooked to perfection, and the side dishes will match them quite nicely.  Some of the side dishes might even surprise you.... I thought, there was no way I would try mac and cheese at a place like this with a prime piece of steak, but after the endorsement of the waitress........I went for it, and it was excellent.  Some people here have also mentioned the crab cakes, and for good reason, they are very, very good.  They also had a Cajun corn that was perfect to go with the rest of my own little private feast.  For desert, the chocolate mouse and I believe it was a raspberry sauce.........wow......awesome........Enjoy the experience, and you'll be back......",0,0,0,Ricardo S.,"Stewartsville, NJ",0,43,3

Back in the day, I used to work across the street.  I also had a boss who loved steak and loved spending money.  Put the two together, and that meant weekly (at least) trips to Del Frisco.  Every single time, my steak (usually the filet mignon) was to-die-for.  Never overcooked, never undercooked, always melt-in-your-mouth good.  And the sides are just phenomenal.  My favorites are the mashed potatoes and asparagus.  Both a must-do.  I've never been a fan of lobster, but somehow at Del Frisco, I am. I also love Del Frisco because their bar is just so entertaining.  Worth a trip even if you don't plan on dining.  Oh, and the service is impeccable.  We used to spend so much money there that they'd actually send us gift baskets at our office.  This may be above and beyond, but I trust that even non-regulars will fall in love with their service (and their hot hot hot servers).",2,0,1,Parisa S.,"New York, NY",251,537,7

Now I only order medium rare steaks at ""questionable"" joints.More recently, I was there with some colleagues when we discovered the Morrell wine bar was closed for a private party. This place works very well as a backup wine bar in midtown. The wine list is, of course, pretty extensive, and you can have tasty apps (and full service?) in the bar area. Again, the service was very friendly. I""m guessing this only works on slower nights.

Really good steaks, in fact. Or so I thought. Until coming here, I was firmly under the impression that the only thing that separates me from Peter Luger's was the willingness to go down to the supermarket and spend a little more for Prime beef, and a whole lot of bullshit new york steakhouse attitude. So, I reasoned, why go drop my hard earned money at one of these joints?  I sneered at our waiter as he took our orders, moaned at the 38 dollar ribeye and gasped at the 10 dollar creamed spinach. Ten bucks for creamed spinach? Gimme a break. I grumpily gulped at my Dewar's on the rocks. Then the appetizers came. oysters, crab cakes and tuna tartar. Damn, those are some good crab cakes. Yum, oysters! Wow, now that's some fresh tuna! My mind was already changing, but when my steak arrived and I bit into the first perfectly crispy, saltypeppery juicy bite, all my anti-steakhouse prejudices flew out the window. This beef is not just prime beef I could pick up at food emporium, this is beefy, wholesome, midwestern beef. The sear on the outside was perfect, miles away from the clumsy sear on my pan-fried steaks. A perfect amount of coarse ground pepper and salt coated the outside, every surface was seared equally, and the steak had been trimmed to include an ideal (for me) 5mm or so of fat around the edge of the steak.I usually order steak medium-rare, but after the server notified another one of our group that ""medium"" would mean ""pink throughout, red in the center"", I went medium, and it was exactly as he said. The 10 dollar sides? Creamed spinach was awesome, with tasty bits of bacon throughout. Mac and Cheese was awesome, baked and crispy.

I mean if I were to get a heart attack eating the ribeye I think I'd die a very happy woman. (ok, I'm just being dramamama)This place is HUGE, with an enormous wine cellar at the basement.  I like dining at the basement because it is a cozier scene and much better for conversation.  We usually start off with the triple giant shrimp cocktail - with remoulade, cocktail and olive oil (?) dip.  Then on to the crab cakes (real lumps of crab meat with just the right amount of spice).  Leave a LOT of room for the beef, and try different cuts if there are more of you.  The Kobe ribeye is not on the menu, and they don't have it everyday so you should call ahead in advance.  Order it just for the sake of trying it.  It is the most marbled, buttery, melt-in-your-mouth piece of beef  I have ever had.  Medium rare, perfectly seasoned, perfectly grilled and no gravy to cloud the taste.  Their filet mignon is also great for people who love leaner cuts (try it rare with a warm center, you can literally run your fork through the meat) and their veal is excellent as well.  Can you tell I like beef? For the sides I love their lobster mash potatoes and sauteed mushrooms.  We usually order some greens to make ourselves feel better, but in the end it'll just be left on the side.  The onion rings are not memorable although they tend to recommend it, I wouldn't fill my stomach with that.  Everyone I had gone with has never finished their food, so we always get the meat to go (which become excellent toppings on Shin-Ramen the next day).  For desserts we go for their 7-layer lemon cake.  Something about the tang that cleans your palate after the sinful meal.  My only complaint is that they don't offer thick slabs of canadian bacon as appetizers (like Marc Joseph or Blair Perrone).  That would've made the menu perfect!",0,1,0,Jess G.,"New York, NY",1,3,0

4.0,9/11/2007,"Everything is bigger in Texas and that extends to their steakhouse outposts in Manhattan.It's fair to say that this is probably one of the largest steakhouses in the city.  The massive main floor has a very open seating plan that, in conjunction with the 30 foot ceiling gives a sense of openness that makes for a very nice lunch setting.  Then there is a second floor available for even more potential heart attack victims.  And a cellar level (where I presume the bodies of victims from upstairs are hidden to avoid liability).  The midtown location is nice and Del Friscos caters to a largely well heeled crowd; proles need not apply.The 12oz fillet mignon will set you back $45.  You should bear this in mind when ordering because that's just the meat; other side orders come at an additional premium.  Hoping to balance the weight of my steak order with something on the lighter side, I ordered a house salad.  That comes with a couple strips of bacon spread across it though; oh well, at least it tasted great.  The spinach supreme is an excellent side; while some tread lightly when it comes to ordering spinach in any cooked form, no such fears should exist here.  The flavor is nicely balanced between the cheeses, seasonings, and spinach, and is more akin to a spinach artichoke dip, except that it isn't a dip at all.The meat at any steakhouse deserves some special attention.  My fillet was an excellent cut; very thick and perfectly cooked.  The steaks are somewhat more rare than you might be accustomed to.  I happen to like my meat on the more rare side of medium-rare, so this is perfect for me.  But if you're the misguided sort who prefers to err on the side of charcoal, you may want to bump your cooking style up one notch when ordering.  The wait staff will have you cut into the meat to check it out though, so if you do end up a little more rare than you like, they can take it back and heat it through a little more.I was impressed with the steak overall; nicely seasoned with cracked pepper and seared to produce a good crust on the outside, but still nice and pink through the middle.  Nicely pronounced flavor, tender throughout, and very satisfying.The service was excellent as well and overall I was favorably impressed.  Midtown steak options are many; Del Frisco's is very much a solid contender among them.",4,0,3,Andrew M.,"New York, NY",2,19,0

My biggest gripe is that i got a horrible cut of ribeye steak. I've bought better steaks at Safeway for less than $10. There was almost more gristle than meat on my plate and I had a tough time cutting through some sections of my steak. That said, it seems that I was the luck one at our table and that most people steaks looked pretty good. However, at the prices they charge, there shouldn't be any bad cuts of meat. By the way, the bar is great for after work drinks - though you're bound to be surrounded by suits - and the wine list is awesome too.",0,0,1,Aden Z.,"San Francisco, CA",63,33,0

Cooked unevenly throughout. A forgettable steak. Also, why did the server use MY utensils to cut the steak in half to share with my friend? Bring your own damnit.Side dishes - Sauteed mushrooms, creamed spinach, and sweet potato pie. Sauteed mushrooms were really good. I found myself munching on the most of these. I would recommend the sweet potato pie as well. However I didn't find the creamed spinach especially tasty. It wasn't as creamy as I would like, I found there was a bit too much texture than expected. Flavor was average as well.Lemon cake - Delicious. Definitely made up for a lackluster steak.Wine - 2002 Chateau D'Issan, Margaux, satisfactory wine, bottom of the glass got extremely gritty.Service - Average overall. Our waitress was very helpful and accommodating, but the other waitresses, sommelier, and bus boys at the table next to us did not pass by my chair without kicking it throughout the duration of my meal. This really got on my nerves. Also, our sommelier took about 20 minutes to come to our table after she was called.

5.0,8/7/2007,our experience at Del Frisco's was amazing from start to finish.We arrived on a Friday night without a reservation and settled in at the bar for drinks while we waited for a table.  the bartenders were friendly (and gorgeous!) and gave us suggestions on what to order.the decor and ambiance here is amazing - dark mahogany wood work and floor to ceiling windows looking out on rockafeller center.the service was outstanding.  our waiter was on top of everything. the food was absolutely to die for.  I'll dream about it. we started with the crab cake and shrimp cocktail appetizers.  so fresh and succulent.  GET the remoulade sauce with the shrimp cocktail.I went against the better judgement of our bartender who told me to get a steak and went with the crab stuffed halibut.  it was good - but not great.  a little dry for me.but my husband's bone in rib eye?  oh.my.God.  spectactular!this is definitely a place for steak lovers.  not too many seafood entrees on the menu.  I will definitely come back during my next visit to New York.,0,0,0,Kara H.,"Chicago, IL",11,96,0

4.0,7/30/2007,"The restaurant is gorgeous. High-rise ceiling to floor windows, mahogany furnishings, white linen tables. The second floor overlooks the first. My bf and I were running late but we were seated right away when we finally arrived, on a friday evening and at a requested (booth) table.The bread was sooo soft and warm, great starter to mellow us out. For close to $20 the crab cake was the highlight of the evening. So succulent I was savoring it with smaller bites in order to enjoy it longer. The mac 'n cheese was goood, crispy on top and oozing in the middle. The garlic sauteed mushroom was great, rich in flavor. Del Frisco's offers a HUGE wine list. We had cocktails instead, which was tastefully strong.Now, the STEAKS. I converted my bf into becoming a Rib-Eye lover he usually orders the Filet Mignon/Porterhouse. We both had the rib-eye, mine MR his MW. After a couple of bites I was waiting to be hit with a euphoria of mouth-watering-melt-in-your-mouth-damn-this-is-a-good-piece-of-steak feeling. Unfortunately it didn't happen, towards the center I got tired of chewing it. It was boring and tastless. Eventhough, it had good marbling and was tender I didn't finish it. I switched to the tasty mushroom side and ordered another crab cake (soo freakin' good). We skipped dessert and opted for more drinks.The waitress and server were great, very professional.

The only food item I would probably not order again were the onion rings...they looked a lot better than they were...I think they needed to be cooked more so they'd be a bit crispier. The bar is a huge corporate suit-scene on weeknights. If you want to hit the bar before dinner for a drink when you're out...either go after 8 pm for a late dinner or stick to the weekend.

(On a tangent, the waitress asked me to cut open my steak in order to check that it was cooked to my liking.  This has never happened to me before. Is it common? Who knows? But I found it kind of a nice touch.).  Del Frisco's was a fun atmosphere with a lot of good food and a good time.  It was definitely way overpriced so I cannot give it 5 stars.  While I think it was one of the best steaks I have ever had, to spend like $15 bucks on a small ""family""-style side of creamed spinach just seems unnecessary.  I would recommend this place for a testosterone-filled business lunch and if you have an expense account and want your company to pay for a REALLY good steak.",1,1,1,Lawrence B.,"New York, NY",1,26,0

2.0,6/1/2007,"By the reviews on Yelp, I guess people go to a place once, are either impressed by the setting or not, and judge based on that.  To me, it's about food and service, and in this case Del Frisco's (nicknamed El Fiasco's) is far outcompeted by my Mom and not a few McDonold's I've been to.First, yes, the place is gorgeous.  I've been to only three or four other restaurants worldwide, that could compete--and two of those are the Harvard Clubs in Boston and New York.  They get five stars for being the kind of place a businessman can feel like a CEO kickin around with his CEO millionaire friends (which is why the bar is more crowded than the tables, because taking people out for drinks is relatively cheap)--or one of us expense account fed people who is lucky enough to eat where he otherwise wouldn't go except on a special occassion.OK, that's out of the way, let's move on to food.Anything meat will be absolutely encrusted with spices.  This is 'fancy' perhaps but not good (not good tasting, not good cooking).  And for the $30 or more you spent on that, it will not include any kind of side dish.You can order a side dish or three. Perhaps you'd like a $10 cereal bowl full of plain mashed potatos, or $15 for the same amount of asparagas.  But whatever you do, don't comment to the wait staff that you less than loved what was served because then the following might happen to you as well.My lunch appointment ordered crab cakes--in addition to several other pricey appetisers and side dishes--and didn't eat more than a bit of them.  When the waitress came my friend (from Ghana) said she just didn't like them.  Well, darn it, the waitress runs off and reports this to her superiors and some blonde hostess who acts like your first grade teacher sidles up to us to not only get further feedback on the dish my friend simply didn't like, but decides to start serving us our food and get chatty!I tried to convey to her that the point of going there was business, not pleasure.  We weren't on a date (we were actually dealing with issues of Terrorism, matters of business) and, well, it's kind of hard to talk death and destruction with some hostess hovering over you, refusing to leave you alone.  Finally she left though, once we complimented something--anything! just get the frick away from me lady--but I can't say I would have rated the place any better if she hadn't bugged us.Even overpricing aside, the food just was plain and the service average--yet the bill was $189 for two people, for lunch.  I've spent more on business lunches, but I've never gotten less for it.",2,1,1,John T.,"Astoria, NY",22,37,2

5.0,3/7/2007,"It's a bit sacreligious to pick a chain as your favorite steakhouse (especially in a city with so many phenomenal choices), but whatever.  The food here is top of the line.  All of the steaks (especially the filet) are perfection.  The sides are delivered in heaping portions, and the appetizers -- most notably the crab cake, their signature -- are wonderful.  The service here is interesting.  You are guaranteed to be served by someone who is either: (a) very knowledgable about the food and wine selections, or (b) smoking hot (occasionally you'll get both; kudos to you, friend).  Service can be on the slow side.  This is not going to be a 45-minute lunch, and you are wasting a great experience if you try to rush in and rush out.  Avoid Thursday nights, as it can get uncomfortably packed.     The atmosphere is pure Wall Street.  This is not a quaint steakhouse from yesteryear; there is a Bloomberg terminal near the bar on the second floor (no joke), and it sometimes feels like you need a J.D. or an MBA (not to mention a healthy dose of business-jerk) to even make a reservation.  If that's your thing, you'll be in heaven here.  Impress clients, enjoy a bachelor party, or just run up an expense account.  On that note -- this is not a place for the frugal-minded.  Del Frisco's is very, very expensive, across the board.  If  you need to worry about t he cost, don't even think about dining here (for lunch, dinner, or even the pre-theater).  On someone else's dime, though (or if you are just plain loaded), have at it.  This is a phenomenal dining experience.",1,0,1,Brian G.,"Westwood, NJ",4,33,0
3.0,2/22/2007,One of the worst dinner experiences at this place. My wife and I had an early reservation for 5:00. We arrived at 5:00 and we're seated quickly. Not many customers there at this time. After 20 minutes not even 1 server came by. What sucks is that there were at least 5 servers bullshitting and laughing by the bar. We didn't even have any water or bread at our table. I had to ask a hostess who was walking by for help. Finally a server arrived. We were so fed up we did not even want to listen to the specials. As far as the food goes it's pretty good. The salads are rather large and have these BIG croutons with 2 crispy strips of bacon that are so damn hard to cut. The avocado ranch is probably one of the best dressings I've had. The filet mignon I had was cooked just right. Had cheesecake for dessert and it was ok. Can't beat Juniors though.What sucks is that when people started getting seated the server helped them right away.

3.0,2/8/2007,"What I look for in a steakhouse. 1) Awe inspiring pieces of beef that make every other flank or filet that I've ever gazed upon, look meager and pathetic in comparison. This is a STEAKhouse after all. Their specialty should be superior to anything else. In this regard Del Frisco's is up there. Their filet mignon was excellent and it was some of the better steak I've ever had. It is an art form to get a steak right, and clearly they have the right people for the job.2) I equate steakhouses with expensive, so I'm cool with the price. However, I expect to have the rest of the meal at least be at an average if not above average level, compared to restaurants in the rest of NY. This is where they first disappointed. The string beans, the mashed potatoes, and the other sides were just painfully ordinary. Only TGIF could have made a worse display of how not to do sides. Maybe in the middle of Oklahoma they ignore presentation and creativity, but in NY, at these kind of prices, I expect more. Lots more.3) A staff that is all over the table, conscious that their clientele are executives with egos that need little men running around doing their bidding. Check. This sounds sarcastic, but I was quite satisfied with the service. Well done.4) A drink menu to properly accompany the orgasmic steak. They had a quite decent wine list and their drink list was very good with a various fruit brandies that were excellent (and very expensive). 5) Deserts that are light and balance off the heavy flavors that have been consumed up to that point. The deserts are sub par. Often large and you feel like you've been beaten with a large blunt lemon or chocolate flavored club. Skip to the fresher, fruitier options is my recommendation. As far as the atmosphere. Well it's very corporate and grandiose. The ceilings make you feel fairly small even for a tall guy like myself, and in general everything feels very far away. Tough to describe, but there is absolutely nothing intimate about the place. Maybe works for some, but not my style.

5.0,2/7/2007,"our group of eight came here on a wednesday night last summer for dinner. the place was very loud, and the first floor bar sort of overflows into the dining area. i think that the second floor is better if you prefer a quieter environment for dinner. our waitress brought us loaves of warm & soft bread that we tore apart with our hands. we all ordered steaks --- most of us got the ribeye, cooked medium rare. when we got our steaks, there was a collective sigh of appreciation as we all took our first bites. their steaks are well-seasoned, verging on salty. i believe that they might be cooked in butter (because it tasted like it) though i can't be sure. regardless, the ribeye was perfectly marbled and came framed by a nice layer of fat. i also had half of the strip steak - it was less tender and a little more dry, but it was also slightly more flavourful. i couldn't decide which was better. for sides, we opted to split 2 orders of mac n' cheese (a daily special that they have everyday), spinach, sauted mushrooms, and potatoes au gratin. the mac n' cheese was very good --- baked, so it came with a nice crispy cheese crust. the other sides were nothing to write home about, though there were no complaints either. most of the table was too stuffed for dessert, but a few of my friends decided to get the flourless chocolate cake a la mode while my friend & i split the six-layer lemon cake (supposedly a special). our lemon cake looked pretty lacklustre when it came cold & unadorned, but it tasted really good. it was enveloped in a smooth layer of sugary icing, and there were alternating layers of spongy airy lemony cake and lemon filling. the bill came to roughly $65pp, including desserts (but no alcohol), which is about normal for good steakhouses in new york. i've been to morton's, peter luger's, sparks, smith & wollensky, uncle jack's, & palm, but i think that del frisco's steak tops them all.",4,0,3,Sonia C.,"Jupiter, FL",408,864,61
