4.0,2/23/2019,"Overall, we had a great dining experience because of the service and upscale ambiance.  Love the decor, as it is part of the St. Regis and has majestic chandeliers hanging from the ceiling.  For starters, ordered the risotto, which felt really decadent and came out with edible gold foil.  It was amazing!  Was not as happy with my miso salmon dish, which was okay at best and wasn't well flavored.  Dessert was great and very well presented - I got the pear panacotta and the chocolate mousse cake.",0,0,0,Sabrina S.,"New York, NY",146,54,0
5.0,2/20/2019,"Chris and I stayed four days at The St. Regis Hotel on vacation.We dined multiple times here for breakfast and dinner.I truly believe that service and experience are a two way street and I make it a point to be kind and gracious to staff at high end hotels.  My brother works for a hotel as a chef and I worked two jobs for ten years in restaurants and hospitality.  I know hard working people when I seen them and I can say that the staff at this hotel works hard to please.The restaurant staff was attentive and friendly on all visits. I love tipping and recognizing great service.  It's nice to build rapport with staff during a visit.The ""Dali"" high tea named after Salvador Dali was incredible!  It's priced at $85 per person.  The sandwiches, scones and desserts were of the highest quality.  This is the upgraded tea service and we highly recommend it. Chris ordered a smoked black tea called Du Tigre and it was like nothing we had ever tasted. Unique and delicious. I ordered the Tropical Garden tea and it was spectacular. Chris and I have enjoyed the ""American Breakfast "" every day of our stay.  The eggs, potatoes, breads, fruits, coffee and juice have been consistently outstanding and generous in portion size.We dined here for dinner as well and it was amazing!Tonight we ordered the champagne risotto with lobster. It was plenty to feed two people and the presentation was amazing with real gold leaf accents in the risotto and perfectly cooked lobster. Absolutely delicious!!!  It was served with a generous bread basket. We also ordered specialty cocktails. Our server Riswad has been taking care of us during our stay and made sure we had a memorable meal. Although we were quite full, Riswad brought out complimentary chocolate mousse cups which were a perfect small dessert.  Such a nice touch!!Dining here is pricey but we felt it was worth every penny and truly memorable!We recommend Astor Court!!",2,0,0,Philip M.,"Atlanta, GA",27,191,421

2.0,2/9/2019,"This rating is for service only!Went during restaurant week 2019 for lunch with 4 co-workers for a change of pace. We put in a reservation through open table the week before and arrived on time and seated after 5 min right near the entrance, and I'm not sure if that was why the waiters kept on overlooking us but we did not get water or bread for 30min! We made eye contact and called politely to waiters throughout this time, which produced a 'be with you in a minute' and one strange garbled grunt the other.After sitting for 30 minutes we were poured water by the nervously shaking (I assume he was new and still learning how to pour?) waiter who ignored us when asked if we could order. The bread that was provided at the same time was cold and hard. By this time we had collectively agreed that even if they did manage to take our orders within the hour we would be spectacularly late for work and decided to leave. The hostess was kind enough to ask if we wanted to talk to the manager as we left but overall we felt very unwelcome and forgotten in the time there. Maybe worth a try if you have nothing better to do with your day!The cherry on top was that the woman who arrived after us was seated right next to our table & served and taken care of right away. Makes me wonder if it was because she was old and we were in our 30s? (The overall crowd at the time was 50+ including our waiter)",2,0,0,Spidereats Y.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,3,0
1.0,2/7/2019,Service was not the best. We came for restaurant week. The food itself was subpar. Considering the price one would imagine the food to have more flavor. In particular the fillet with brussel sprouts and potatoes. Severe lack of seasoning. We were seated a little before 5 pm and did not leave until well after 6:30. Only because the service was so slow. We waited 20 mins for our server to take away our entree plates and it wasn't even him that noticed we were done. It was another server. Although he walked past us several times and even took away the plates from the guests at the table behind us. Will not be coming back.,0,0,0,Samantha R.,"Santa Ana, CA",4,1,0
1.0,2/4/2019,"I really wanted to like this place but unfortunately there were more than a few misses throughout our evening. At first walk in , everything seemed very pleasant as we walked through the gorgeous St Regis hotel. I picked out one of their specialty cocktails which was amazing and shared the venison pate with my friend . We both absolutely loved the pate and the warm and perfectly crunchy bread basket .  So why the 1 star you ask ? Well it was all downhill from there. We ordered both the signature champagne risotto and the crab ravioli with caviar. The risotto was awful. No delicate saffron flavor , no delicate flavor at all. instead just a taste of too much Parmesan in every bite. My friend thought the crab ravioli smelled a bit off but we ate it anyway. I thoroughly regret that as I've had a stomach ache all day. My poor friend had diarrhea. I wouldn't have been that upset if I had eaten at a TGI Friday's, but at the St Regis you expect a bit more than to pay 240 dollars for a stomach ache.

4.0,1/23/2019,Went here for restaurant week; jan 2019. We were seated right away and was approached with water upon sitting. They space everything out nicely and you never feel rushed. Everything was great. The tuna poke bowl was tasty and fresh. The crab raviolis were good. They gave you a ton of extra crab lumps mixed in the dish.

5.0,1/22/2019,"This is for the restaurant week winter 2019!In a nutshell: Food was amazing, service was good, place and ambience very classy.Ok let's start from when I walked in. We were seated right away at a beautiful window seat. Chairs are really semi plush sofa chairs. Chandeliers all around! Bread was warm and nice flavors.My poke was pretty great. The fresh tuna with avocados and seaweed coming beautifully with the spicy mayo.The champagne risotto was a tad bland. But gold flakes were a beautiful touch.My pulled crab ravioli was surprisingly packed with crab meat. They were so generous with the portion. Beautiful creamy sauce (sorry I'm butchering the fancy names here) that went beautifully with the risotto. The poached egg with (salty) caviar was a brilliant and classy touch.Steak was rightly done and Brussels sprouts and potatoes were perfect. Would expect nothing less from a nice place like this.Dessert was disappointing- it was panna cotta with a pear jelly on top garnished with pear slices (soaked in something), chocolate ice cream, and some crumble, oh and the star of the bowl- meringue. EVERY element is beautiful (jelly really was lost in that mess; and I could do without the crumble) but the ice cream and meringue was lovely. I never got the very thin layer of panna cotta that was lost under all these extravaganza. I'm sure the chef thought about this dessert a lot but the individual elements did not seem to compliment each other. Kudos to the thought though :) and beautiful representation. I need that meringue recipe!!",5,1,1,Dolonchapa C.,"New York, NY",166,279,869
1.0,1/2/2019,"This place is atrocious. Please avoid at all cost. We were staying at st. Regis just before New Year. The service at this place is very lackluster. The server didn't  bring our coffee, forgot to put in the order of the parfait we ordered and on top of that never came back to check on us once. Not even one time! We had to flag him down for water refill. I do see the serve check on the table next to us who are older white folks multiple times. I guess u have to look certain way to get a decent service there then. The bald head server is the worst. For having such overpriced food there for breakfast, the service is definitely not up to par. I'd give a zero star if I could. Unless if you are looking to spend $150 for breakfast and have bad taste in your mouth after, this place isn't for you.",0,0,0,Zach L.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,6,8

1.0,12/22/2018,"0 stars! Why doesn't Yelp give me an option to put 0 stars? This place is atrocious. I cannot believe something attached to the St. Regis could be so terrible. The restaurant (really just an open dining area attached to the St. Regis) serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The atmosphere gives off a luxurious vibe (obviously since it's attached to a 5-Star hotel). That's about all the Astor Court has going for it, an illusion of grander. The food and service are worse than just about any restaurant I have ever been to. The food is overpriced, boring, tasteless, and just bad. To add to the misery, the service is terrible. Service is slow, confused, and just not on it. I give no leeway for food quality or service when it's this expensive. The only reason I came here was because I had free breakfast (please avoid this place like the plague if you don't have free breakfast, it's stupid overpriced) and because I had to burn the $50 credit on a daily basis. There is nothing good to say about this restaurant. Everything is bad.

I called ahead and spoke to Craig the host who was very accommodating in my request for a reservation! We were running a little late, so I called him back and he was happy to push back our reservation. He'd secured us a sweet table with a couch and sat us side by side for a more intimate dining experience. Sayyid (sp?) was our server, who could not have been more delightful or attentive. The atmosphere was grand and definitely fancy. The drink menu was great; always nice to see Blanton's on the menu. However, I was a little disappointed with our desserts. We got the cheesecake and the cranberry/apple cobbler. They were small in size and honestly not that flavorful. However, they did put a candle in the cobbler for my friend's birthday which was much appreciated. I'd be interested to see if other food here was better than the desserts.

3.0,12/9/2018,"After a day of enjoying New York in all its holiday splendor, my boyfriend and I were extremely excited for the restorative effects that afternoon tea provides. Alas, the tea was disappointing. While the environs are gorgeous and the host was extremely gracious, the general service for such an illustrious address was lackluster at best. The server was pleasant and graciously accommodated a food allergy, however he never checked up on us and had to flagged down and asked to refill waters (and once flagged down, it seemed rather an imposition upon him). We also never were offered additional hot water for our tea pots. The pastries were refrigerated and has obviously been plated many hours prior to service. Fine. But like with good cheese, please remove from the refrigerator prior to serving for at least a few minutes to take the stiff chill off of your overly sweet pastries. The pastries were uninspired, overly sweet and misguided; the financier suffered from a surfeit of butter and hazelnut combined with ice cold temperature and the barest whisper of gold flake on top in an all too transparent attempt to justify the $65 dollar price tag. Prompt service is only rendered at the end of the meal when the waiter - heretofore a denizen of the back of the house - arrived eagerly with the check. However, he then did not materialize to take the check and the host ended up saving the day.One of us had fond memories of the tea service from a decade past.  For the other, it was something new.  In the end, we both agreed: Lady Astor would be aghast at the perversion of her name and legacy - another sad chapter in Marriott's gradual monopolization of the great hotels of the world.",3,0,0,Caroline H.,"Alexandria, VA",16,25,6

The dinning room was still packed this late in the afternoon. The ceiling was very pretty but the seating was a little crammed. We were very close to the next table, but I guess that's expected for New York. Due to a lot of patrons, our server was pretty busy and therefore we didn't get served right away.We wanted to try the Lady Astor's Tea and Caroline's Tea but the later was sold out, sad. So obviously we had to go with two sets of the Lady Astor's Tea. I personally don't love macaroons so I also asked for a replacement dessert. Our server was nice enough to still bring all the macaroons and two little sugar desserts for me. The set came with typical scones, assorted pastries, and sandwiches. Pros:You do get individual tea pots which is nice.

4.0,10/29/2018,"I was staying at the St. Regis for the weekend and while I was waiting for my room to be prepared I had lunch in the Astor Court. My review of the St. Regis will be a whole separate issue but Jessie from Astor Court saved them a star. Jessie deserves 5 stars all the way. Jessie was such an amazing server, so sweet and kind with great recommendations on what to eat. She was not pushy and let me take my time at the restaurant. I came back with my mom the next day and she treated us like queens with mimosas and she remembered my some of my favorites from the previous day and brought them over. Jessie certainly enhanced my stay at the St. Regis and meal at Astor court.The first meal I ordered the soup of the day which was a cauliflower bisque and the kale, tomato and burrata salad. The cauliflower soup was excellent, extremely creamy without having any added cream. The salad was very over dressed in my opinion and the tomatoes were quite mushy. It wasn't what I expected and it was just okay for the price. When we returned we ordered a seasonal fruit plate, custom omelette and the seasonal white truffle egg linguine. Jessie also brought us a dessert plate with mini cakes and some cookies! My mom really enjoyed her chicken & asparagus omelette and I thought it looked good. My pasta was good but not as amazing as I would expect for a $50 dish. There was a ton of white truffle in it but it didn't have as much creaminess as I would have liked.

Immediately after recovering the next day, I sent the restaurant a note to prevent others from getting ill. It took over a week to reach a ""live person,"" who referred me to others.Over a period of 3 weeks, I spent over 2 hours trying to connect with 6 different employees, all of whom were unresponsive and unconcerned (including 2 managers, 2 men in the Security Department, and a Mariott Customer Service representative).  So I cannot recommend this restaurant, nor the staff who were cavalier about wasting my time, as well as preventing other diners from getting ill.

5.0,5/9/2018,"Really enjoyed my time at the St. Regis!! We made a reservation for tea time at the St. Regis after showing up at the Palm Court Plaza tea room, only to be told that the room was reserved for the weekend for an event. We were really disappointed, and willy nilly called around - thankfully, Astor Place at the St. Regis was one of the closer ones and the first we called. We were able to get a reservation easily, and only an hour before their tea service started! We drifted around the stores on Fifth Ave, and ended up getting there ~15 minutes later than our res (so 3:15PM instead of our 3PM reservation). They still honored our reservation, and sat us down. Service was a little slow at the beginning (we didn't get menus or water for probably 15 minutes, and waiters were scarce too). We were just taking pictures and enjoying the live harpist that was playing modern tunes on her harp. It was magical. We knew what set we were ordering (the New York one, $65 pp) and were able to order quickly. After we ordered, the service became a lot faster which was nice. The tea itself was really good, we got the earl grey and a floral, fruity jasmine tea that were both delightful. The little tea sandwiches at the beginning were so good! I was impressed, and they were so cute. The tower of desserts were cute too, very rich and sweet but we were so full by then that it was hard to finish. The clotted cream here is delicious, as is the lemon spread. We ended up taking some of the scones home! Overall, we loved our experience namely due to the harpist (she was so good, I couldn't stop watching her play the whole time we were there). The hotel is beautiful, it wasn't crowded, and it felt really intimate. Would definitely come back, especially on the harpist days!",2,0,1,Carol L.,"New York, NY",769,437,1507
2.0,5/8/2018,"Yesterday, I treated a dear friend to high tea at the St. Regis. We live on separate coasts and only get together once or twice a year, so I was hoping to really deliver since it was my ""turn"" to plan the day. Part of my plan for the day was an epic tea service. The St. Regis offers two, delightfully-overpriced tea services--Lady Astor's Tea and Caroline's Tea--and rather than share a single service, I elected to splurge and order BOTH tea services. I was happy to indulge in the experience, having enjoyed high tea services everywhere from The Savoy Hotel London to The BonBonerie in Cincinnati, Ohio (a rare and surprising treat if you get the right server!). Given the hefty price tag that came along with ordering two, separate tea services, I was ready to be wowed! What I was, however, was confused and disappointed. Our server brought a single, tiered tea service to the table, said, ""enjoy"" and walked away. I was confused to see a single tea service when I'd clearly ordered two, and my friend and I elected not to touch anything until we could get the server's attention for clarification. In the meanwhile, we used the menu to review what was in front of us on the tea service, and we easily deduced both that there was a combination of tea menu items on the single tier, but there were a number of missing items. I was truly confused, because I'd ordered two, separate tea services, and expected to receive two, separate (and completed) tiers of food. Even my stunned friend said, ""That is NOT $150 worth of food.""Our server eventually made his way back to our table, I inquired about the single tier, and it wasn't until I really pressed for an explanation that he (finally) explained that portions of both teas WERE on the same tier, and that there WERE, indeed, items missing. It made absolutely no sense to me that we weren't informed of this when he first put the service on the table, AND that we were essentially waiting for the rest of our service items to come out. Moreover, it appeared as if we were getting a single tea service with a few additional items on a side plate rather than two separate services. There just happened to be a table near us with 4 people sharing a single tea service, and I could not help but notice we had the same amount of food. I was truly confused. Why didn't we just get the two (and complete), separate services like I'd ordered to eliminate confusion and avoid the appearance of impropriety?In the end, it was a day out with my girl and I didn't want to ruin the vibe. I smiled and said thanks when a side plate of missing items didn't arrive until we'd almost finished eating. And I said nothing when our server accidentally delivered our leftovers to a different table where I watched a surprised patron accept my food and put it into his own takeaway bag (the server realized his error as he approached our table WITH THE BILL but WITHOUT my food and had to go back to retrieve leftovers that I no longer wanted, quite frankly). I even tipped...but poorly.In all fairness, some of the treats were very tasty, we got some great photos, and the musical selections from the harpist were hilarious/impressive. If those were the things I'd paid for, I would have been more than satisfied with the experience. I paid for high tea, however, and for the amount of food that was actually present, the way it was ultimately presented, and the service, I can honestly say I was underwhelmed.If it's ambiance you're looking for, a lot of these reviewers are right, this place offers endless photo ops of old-world glamour. If, however, you're looking for a decadent, high tea experience that's well worth the money you pay, I would recommend going somewhere else.",3,0,1,Holly M.,"Cincinnati, OH",5,34,3
4.0,4/27/2018,"A great place if you want to splurge a little for a nice elegant setting and great food! We started off with a dozen oysters that were brought out all together. The waiter, however, did not tell us what types of oysters they were which is peculiar since most restaurants do. I ordered the salmon (cooked medium)  with truffle butter and it did not disappoint. There was a large chunk of truffle butter on top of the hot salmon so I only cut a little and spread it across the salmon so the salmon wouldn't get too buttery. It was so soft and just melts in your mouth! We also ordered panna cotta & creme brûlée for dessert. The panna cotta was creamy with hints of lemon. Nothing too special about the panna cotta however. The creme brûlée was topped with a Madeline cookie that had hints of lemon to it. It paired well with the creme brûlée that had a thick layer of seared sugar that added a great crunch to the dish in general.

1.0,12/22/2017,"What to say: a disappointment. The personnel is unfriendly and definitely not meeting my expectations of a high-end luxury hotel of this calibre. In fact, I would have been shocked even in a not so highly rated hotel restaurant than the restaurant of a St. Regis. First, the receptionist (a lady with ginger curly hair) of the Astor Court was arrogant and treated us like we were disturbing her. Just to be clear, we were properly dressed and such a treatment is inappropriate and not acceptable. Second, the service itself was also sub-prime. The only person who was friendly was the guy who, after we had finished for more than 30 minutes, took the empty plates. After that, we were ignored again until we asked the lovely curly haired receptionist for the check, and, after waiting for another 10 minutes, we had to ask the lovely receptionist again, who then blamed the service personnel, instead of responding friendly, apologising for the delays. Bottom line, four stars each for the food and the interior, which were good, zero stars for the price performance, minus 5 stars for the customer experience, equals one well deserved star. Someone should give the personnel (and the receptionist in particular) a training in guest service and maybe also tell them that the guests are the purpose why THEY are there, and not the other way around.

1.0,12/8/2017,"We had a reservation for breakfast that we made weeks prior. As we arrived, the hostess in the front with ginger hair asked if we were hotel guests. We said we were not and she took us around to the back of the dining hall where it was dark and empty. If the other, brunette hostess had not moved us, we would have left. She sat us at a table for four even though we were two. We would have been happy if she moved us to a table for two but I think she was making up for the other hostess' mistake. There were 5 or so two top tables open in the main dining area that were available and we were sat in the back. It didn't make sense and we felt like were treated like riff raff. Finally we sat and were greeted by our waiter Tony. I asked what kind of toast they had and he asked me if that was all I was going to eat before he told me. What? Lol kind of backhanded. I understand it's a nice restaurant, we were sat by the hostess at a 4 top and we are only two, but I am not just going to eat toast for breakfast. We are here to eat and spend money. I don't think he thought about what he asked before he did. I ordered the blueberry pancakes and he ordered an omelette. I was content with my pancakes but he couldn't finish his omelette. The veggies were barely cooked and the mushrooms were a slimy consistency. For such a nice place, it's also disappointing they didn't have the food to match.My bf had written we were here for our anniversary breakfast. Our waiter Tony dropped off a dessert that said congratulations. When he dropped it he said, ""I don't know what you're celebrating, but congratulations."" Wouldn't you find out from the hostess what the reservation says?? He was polite when he said it and when he dropped the check off, but it was an odd experience. At first we felt he was annoyed by us then he was kinder at the end of our service. I am not judgmental and I do give people the benefit of the doubt. I especially have empathy and mindfulness when it comes to food service, as I have worked in it for 9 years. But today was extremely disappointing to say the least. I hate when we are unable to leave a generous tip because working in service is hard work. But today the tip reflected the service we received.",2,0,1,Neva A.,"Garden Grove, CA",121,55,21

2.0,11/14/2017,"This was a very disappointing experience. If you plan to stay at the St. Regis, also plan to take your meals elsewhere, outside the hotel. Brunch was once one of the things the hotel excelled at.   That's also to be expected at one of the great Manhattan hotels. I'd been there a number of times -starting with my parents, thirty years ago as a kid; and perhaps the last time was 10 years ago. So, when seeking out a place to honor my friend's birthday, with a foursome of her boyfriend and my wife, this seemed like an ideal Sunday event. But it wasn't. Service, food, and cost (for what it was) were as poor as we could get.To begin with, let me remark that no breads were brought to the table. You have to pay for it, separately -but that's not immediately obvious, and requires you wait for the menus (which took 10 minutes). Then coffee was served in a pot, but relatively weak with no more taste than Dunkin' Donuts. I ordered an eggs dish, which came..cool. Who here likes cold eggs -could I have a show of hands, please? The other elements of the dish -sausage, etc. were very usual, I had asked for bread, which, when it finally arrived, was halfway through the band was just a bit of toasted bread. The fresh orange juice was quite good. But at $16 for a medium sized glass, it really did not improve my spirits at the event. The cost for the four of us was, with tax and tip, over $200.00. I expected that, but I had also expected better cuisine and service.

As the restaurant attached to a 5 star hotel you would expect the dining area and menu to be 5 star as well. It certainly didn't disappoint, especially when I saw the menu and noticed the Titanic Omelette (An omelette that costs the small price of $125 with lobster and caviar)Out of the gate the service was great. Our server's name was Ridwan and he was very accommodating in providing his advice, suggestions, and just being hospitable. The items that we got along with their ratings are:Eggs Benedict - 9 out of 10. The Hollandaise sauce was the best I've had. It had a somewhat lemony taste that mixed perfectly with the runny egg and smoked salmon. I would order this dish from here every time.Flax Seed Pancakes with Blueberry - 8 out of 10. These were good. Not great but good. They had the right amount of fluffiness to make sure they were filling.Cheese and Charcuterie Board - 8 out of 10. The fruit was delicious along with the honey comb that comes with it. The cheese were your standard cheeses that come with restaurant grade boards. I would have liked more exotic selections for the cheeses for the being there but it wasn't disappointing.Omelette customized with grilled chicken, mushrooms, and feta - 9 out of 10. This was almost perfect. The grilled chicken came in chunks and was extremely satisfying. I felt the way the egg was cooked was textbook. It was slightly above medium so there was a creamy texture but wasn't as if it was over-easy. Although quite expensive, the meal was great.

The tea components are sorely lacking.  Scones are small and bland, but some would say scones are bland all the time,  The sandwiches were good but not out of the ordinary as was the little quiche. Sandwiches were a smoked salmon spread, cucumber and cream cheese, crab salad (mostly bread with a little of the crab) and egg salad. Nothing imaginative in the recipes for these. The sweets were mixed.  The French macaroon was quite good, as was the lemon tart with meringue topping. But the small slice of some sort of cake with gold flakes on top was not good and certainly not worth the calories for me to finish. The chocolate mousse was ok but again, nothing to write home about.  The tea I chose was fine. And all this for $65 plus tax.

2.0,1/1/2017,Service was awful and the food tremendously overpriced. Ambience and harpist were only positives. When we arrived around 3 we were only given a menu for high tea. We asked our server for a lunch menu (web site says they serve lunch until 5pm) but were told they only have high tea and bar service menu. I looked on the site again then went back to the hostess who apologized and gave us a brunch menu. It was very bizarre and think the server just wanted us to order the pricey high tea at $65pp. We also had to ask for water (We waited with empty water glasses for over 10 min.) Brunch was pricey (i paid $15 for a glass of OJ - but at least it was freshly squeezed). Food was okay but nothing special for the price you pay.

No more waiters with white gloves, no more all-you-can-eat pastries. I was there this week. There were only two waiters for the entire room and they looked tired and annoyed. The room is now packed with square tables only few inches apart.

Nothing wrong in principle, but the for $55+tax+tip, I expect table linens and not the same service of a guy who comes just for a $5 espresso.

3.0,2/24/2014,"We were disappointed with our afternoon tea on Presidents Day, 2014. After having tea at the St. Regis a number of times, we found our experience this day just ok for the following reasons.Our table was never wiped down from the previous diner, had crumbs all over and wasn't set up. No table cloth, no liner, nothing. The waiter put our silverware down on the dirty table, thus making us pick up our silver and wiping it down from germs. I did appreciate the black napkin for lint reasons though. Our Champagne came which was delightful and we asked for iced water. Instead came our sandwiches, which were hard and not attractively presented. We asked for water again, and our tea came. My husband had to get up and go to another unset table to get sugar for his tea. When the treats came, it was on a grimy tower, not the regular silver, and basically had nothing but left over petit fours from Valentines Day.The clotted cream was attractively presented and tasted fresh. The scones tasted like they were sitting in a warming drawer for a while. We waved down an employee and asked for more hot water. Our waiter was pleasant, but must of had a station somewhere else as well as he wasn't readily available. The manager did stop by and ask how everything was, so surely he must of seen that out table had never been set up. We felt like we were getting the leftovers from Valentines Day and the St. Regis was simply taking shortcuts.
