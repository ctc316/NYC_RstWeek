2.0,4/25/2019,"I find Nobu Downtown SO overrated! We came with much expectation. And  it is noisy, the service lacks of attention, we had reservations for 9pm and when we arrived they told us that our table wasn't ready, what?? We waited for 20 more minutes. Unbelievable . The food is ok but nothing is outstanding, we had a very nice white wine though.Just go to the many sushi places New York has that are much better!Encontré a Nobu Downtown MUY sobrevalorado. Veníamos con mucha expectativa y es ruidoso, el servicio no es para nada atento, teníamos reserva para las 9pm y cuando llegamos nos dijeron que nuestra mesa no estaba lista, que?? Esperamos 20 minutos más.Increíble. La comida estuvo bien pero nada que destacar, si tomamos un muy rico vino blanco.Vayan a cualquiera de los sushi de Nueva York que son mucho mejores!",1,0,1,Marian M.,"Vicente López, Argentina",29,266,961

5.0,4/4/2019,"The food is great. Our table was downstairs but I would have loved to sit upstairs despite the crowd. Upstairs had great lighting. Downstairs is more for a date night. We were seated right away and was greeted by Michael our waiter for the evening. Michael started us off with the drink menu and recommended the grapefruit martini. Then we ordered our appetizers...we ordered ceviche, rock shrimp and two hand rolls to start. Our entrees were chicken and salmon teriyaki. Our drinks came out first with the spicy edamame. The drinks were AMAZING! You didn't taste the alcohol but it did hit you and only after one drink. Then we got the ceviche...it was put together well. No piece was too big or too small. I wish the octopus wasn't to chewy when eating it. The hand rolls were good...the rock shrimp we asked for the creamy aioli on the side that was amazing! Then we got our entrees both salmon and chicken were perfect. It wasn't drenched in teriyaki sauce like some places do. After that they cleared off our table and asked if we wanted a dessert menu. We did...it took awhile for us to get a dessert menu but I think that was because it was very busy. We ordered gelato to split. The matcha gelato was great! Overall, this place is great for a nice date night because the pace was slow...it was not too loud where you weren't able to converse. And, you were evenly spread out from people. But, it does get busy after 7:00 pm.",0,0,0,Stephanie F.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,27,83
4.0,3/31/2019,"Came here for restaurant week lunch with my boyfriend. We both ordered the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalepeno to start. I ordered the Rock Shrimp Tempura as my second course, and he opted for the Black Cod and Eggplant miso. The Yellowtail Sashimi was fresh and the dressing it came it was light and flavorful. The Rock Shrimp Tempura was delicious - the sauce was creamy with a kick. I highly recommend it. My boyfriend really enjoyed his second course as well. The meal overall was light and could be slightly more filling but it was overall very good. Ambiance was very pleasant with high ceilings and columns, plenty of windows, and a large bar in the center.  Make a reservation!",0,0,0,Maya E.,"Manhattan, NY",306,140,96
3.0,3/30/2019,"Honestly was not impressed, and left brunch hungry. I came here for my birthday because of their reputation. I ordered the Nobu cup sushi, Nobu fish and chips and the Soba cha granola with pear sorbet off of the brunch menu. The portion sizes are laughable. Since it was my birthday, my friends were being nice but I could see the disappointment on their faces when their meals came out. No really seemed to enjoy it. The service was terrible--waiters were inattentive, the bartender was rude and up-charged us (they refunded + recharged us after we caught the mistake), and we came during a shift change and were completely forgotten.

5.0,3/30/2019,"Nobu's Downtown restaurant exceeded my expectations and went above and beyond to ensure that my family and I had a joyous birthday dinner. The restaurant gave us a comfortable corner table and our waiter was an absolute delight. He gave helpful recommendations for what to order and was attentive to our dietary preferences. We ordered the black miso cod (imperative!), seafood ceviche, the miso bamboo special, salmon teriyaki, wagyu gyoza and spicy tuna roll. The standouts were definitely the black miso cod and the salmon teriyaki. For dessert, we ordered the calpico carrot cake and the staff wrote Happy Birthday on the plate. The carrot cake was out of this world! The dining experience was truly impeccable.",0,0,0,Jessica Y.,"Philadelphia, PA",243,197,3043
3.0,3/30/2019,"So I had a really bad experience at Nobu Miami. I'll spare you the details, but being charged for extra bottles of wine, manger was rude to us, it was my birthday dinner, etc. so another manager reached out and invited me back to Nobu, and because I live in Manhattan I came to this location. Bad decision, at least the food in Miami was IMPECCABLE. The food in At the DTW location was weak. Lacking flavor, excitement, etc. I'm so shocked at Nobu honestly and the inconsistency across the different locations. The restaurant itself was beautiful, service was fine, but the meal itself was sooo boring, lack luster, and not an experience. We started with the Brussels sprouts, rock shrimp, baby artichoke salad and the squid pasta, and the dishes were fine, but that's literally it, they were just fine.",0,0,0,Chanelle H.,"New York, NY",24,69,70

2.0,3/16/2019,"I am a generous reviewer, often giving love to anywhere that gives me a decent meal. That being said, Nobu seriously let me down. This was my first time to New York and my friends and I decided to treat ourselves to a nice meal while we were here. We chose Nobu solely off of reputation. I ordered the teriyaki salmon and rock shrimp for dinner. So what went wrong?The service was f***ing terrible. Our server could not have cared less about us. We all ordered Prosecco and he brought us tequila cocktails. He then proceeded to mess our orders up. My colleagues sushi came out 30 minutes before me and my other friends entree. The food took over an hour to reach our table.What's saving this review from being a 1 star is the fact that the food was actually good. Aside from that, nothing good came from this.For $100, Nobu should do a better damn job.",2,0,0,Maxwell M.,"Columbus, OH",165,12,3
5.0,3/13/2019,"I think I've just eaten the best sushi dish of my life. Absolutely obsessed with the Bluefin Tuna Sashimi with Hearts of Palm. Wow.Visited here around 5pm and sat in the lounge/sushi bar area. Really relaxed vibe.I've been to Nobu Downtown before, but this time I was with a friend who really knew the menu and the best things to order. We got the crispy rice with spicy tuna, bluefin tuna with hearts of palm, creamy rock shrimp, cauliflower, and bigeeye tuna tataki with mushroom. All really lovely dishes that compliment eachother well. (We are big tuna people if you can't tell :)) Would definitely recommend for some delicious sushi in the financial district!",1,1,1,Monique S.,"New York, NY",14,39,167
5.0,2/23/2019,"Went here for restaurant week and thoroughly enjoyed my time. They were offering a 2 course lunch menu, and a specialty mocktail/wine/cocktail list in addition to their regular menu. I had the blackberry tea/lemonade for my mocktail ($8), the tuna sashimi salad as my first course, and their signature black cod with eggplant as my second course. The servings may appear ""small"" as some reviews highlighted, but I was extreme full during by the middle of my second course (I actually didn't finish my meal). Both courses were tasty. The salad could've done with a little less black pepper (it tasted like peppercorns and tuna such on a bed of lettuce). The cod was immaculate. It was cooked to the perfect texture and was drizzled with a flavorful balsamic reduction. The eggplant was also cooked very well, and provided a nice consistency to the meal. The mocktail blackberry lemonade tea was by far my favorite. It tasted fresh, and not overly sweet. The ambiance was nice, inviting, upscale. I sat at the bar, which was nice. I was able to view the entrance, upstairs dining area, and the chefs as they were preparing meals. I really enjoyed my experience and would return again.",2,0,1,Donielle M.,"Manhattan, NY",128,45,58
1.0,2/22/2019,"I normally don't write reviews, but the experience I had at Nobu Downtown this afternoon was incredibly concerning as I found a fairly large piece of GLASS in my cocktail. This is unacceptable in any situation - whether it be at Nobu or a dive bar. The whole situation was extremely embarrassing for me as I was there on a work lunch (and the last thing I wanted to do was complain in front of my colleagues and cause a commotion). The staff was very apologetic and concerned, which I appreciated. They confirmed the glass came from a broken wine glass stem that somehow ended up in my drink. Luckily I'm fine, I just hope action has been taken to ensure this doesn't happen to anyone else moving forward - so unsafe. All ice should be replaced after a glass is broken behind the bar. Unfortunately, I doubt that I will be dining at Nobu again any time soon after finding GLASS in my $18 cocktail.",0,0,0,Cate D.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",0,1,0

5.0,2/16/2019,I don't know why it has 3.5 stars. The entrance to this Nobu restaurant is on Broadway side. The gps don't actually specify this. This Nobu is 2X bigger then the one in Hollywood on La cienega blvd. Theirs a lot of waiters here maybe it's training day. Food is so good. For some reason all Nobu has the same high grade quality of food. I've been to the Nobu in La and now here in NYC. When you come in I don't know if upstairs is part of Nobu but if it is it makes this Nobu the biggest I've ever seen. Amazing place to bring a business meeting. This is a very romantic place to bring some one important in your life. The price is very high but it's all worth it. Yellow fish tail is one of my favorite dish besides the wagu tacos. I'm not a big fan on the wagu but when you eat it in a taco form it's just amazing.,1,0,0,T L.,"Bellflower, CA",76,41,96

Everything they brought out was SOOOOO GOOD! There was an roll with Fluke that was not on the menu, but suggested by our waiter. I say get it. I can't remember the name of it, but, just ask for the roll that has Fluke. I'll attach a picture for you to see.All the Sashimi was just encredible and melted in my mouth of yummy goodness.I will be back and back for more.

5.0,2/9/2019,"I came here with some coworkers for restaurant week lunch this past week and really had a great time. Everything I got was absolutely delicious and even though the portions looked small I was actually stuffed by the end. To start I got the yellow fish with jalapenos. The chef recommended eating each piece with a piece of cilantro that was on the plate. This tasted amazing! The fish was so fresh and tasty, combined with the slight kick from the jalapeno as well as the cilantro and lemon juice it was sitting in it made for the perfect bite. Only wish there were more pieces on the plate! For the main I got the black cod and eggplant miso, served with a side of rice. This was delicious! The fish was cooked perfectly and I loved the flavor of the sauce and the eggplant. I really enjoyed soaking up the rest of the sauce with some rice. Overall, I really great lunch! Everything was very tasty and flavorful! I'll definitely be back next restaurant week!",4,0,1,Alina V.,"New York, NY",257,274,682
4.0,2/7/2019,"Girlfriend and I came here for lunch during restaurant week on a Monday.  Upon walking in we were greeted and asked if we wanted our coats hung up.  We were seated shortest after and had to wait a little while before the server arrived with the menus.  We ordered the sliced yellowtail with jalapeño appetizer and black cod entree (in addition we also got a tuna roll because we were curious about the sushi quality too).  The yellowtail was good but a very small portion.  Nothing to get crazy about.  The sushi came out and was below average.  Hard to believe Nobu is (or was?) at some point famous for sushi.  We've been to top sushi restaurants in NYC and they were all light years better in quality.  Now for the cod - The cod was so redeeming it saved the day.  We both agreed that it was so perfectly cooked and flavored that it erased any issues with the service, yellowtail appetizer, or very mediocre sushi.  It was that good.  Way to go cod, would come back again just for that.  4 stars only because the cod was so good, otherwise it this review would be a 3.",1,0,0,Garrett D.,"Jersey City, NJ",3,66,5

5.0,2/7/2019,"I had to head up to New York recently and realized I would be at lunchtime close by Nobu Downtown.  By now anyone interested in Asian food knows of the celebrity Japanese chef Nobu Matsuhisa and his namesake restaurants.  I wondered how lately the food at Nobu has been holding up - especially with so many other top chefs joining the Asian and Asian fusion scene.  Well judging by the meal I was served, I would say it is holding up more than quite good!  I began with a perfect tuna sashimi in Matsuhisa sauce.  The quality of the sashimi was outstanding.  But the best was yet to come as the entrée.  That was Nobu's signature dish - his legendary black cod.  Seriously this is one of the tastiest fish creations I have ever eaten.  Also to be noted - Bryan (or Brian) the bartender was very friendly and attentive.  And of course the décor of Nobu is really grand to say the least.  What is not to like?",10,6,8,Jeff H.,"Margareten, Vienna, Austria",241,1104,7351

3.0,2/5/2019,"***NYC WINTER RESTAURANT WEEK 2019 LUNCH REVIEW***They weren't accepting reservations for lunch, probably because it was at the bar/lounge area only. But our party of four walked in at around noon, and were seated immediately. The seating was a tad uncomfortable for a meal. The space seemed to be more like a grab a quick drink and leave type of space, so something to keep in mind.For $26, you will get an appetizer and an entree. For the appetizer, I went with the Nobu Cup Sushi, which is three little tea cups of sushi rice, each topped with salmon, tuna, or chef's choice (it happened to be fluke that day). The fish was fine but it wasn't anything amazing. I wasn't a huge fan of the rice under the fluke. I'm not sure what seasoning they used for that one but it tasted like a shiso leaf, which I'm not a fan of. For the entree, I had the Arctic Char with Jalapeno Dressing. The jalapeno dressing was probably the best part. Although it was spicy at all, it still had a great fresh flavor to it. The Arctic char was a bit overcooked. The portions are small (as expected) but it was surprisingly filling.For drinks, we ordered some mocktails. I had some kind of blackberry tea, which I really enjoyed. It was pretty expensive though - at $8 a pop, especially since it contains no alcohol. I'm glad I got to try Nobu but I don't think the quality is worth the price point - with or without Restaurant Week. I guess you're really coming here for the brand/image and not for the actual food.",6,0,4,Mel T.,"New York, NY",444,1319,3268

3.0,1/28/2019,"I really like the idea of Restaurant Week. It gives you a chance to try out those high-end restaurants you've been eyeing without having to sell your liver on the black market. I appreciate that! So when a coworker asked if I wanted to try Nobu for lunch, I was pretty much in.For the Restaurant Week lunch, you can sit at the lounge upstairs or bar area, away from all of the people who are spending loads of $$$ downstairs. Either way, the upstairs area is gorgeous and the ambiance really elevates the whole experience.Our service was superb. We walked in without a reservation and were seated immediately. Bryan did a great job at accommodating our dishes for food allergies too. He really knew the menu. If I could give 5 stars for service alone, I would.Where it gets tricky is the actual food, which I personally do not believe is worth the hefty price tag, even with the Restaurant Week special going on. For $26, you get an app and a second course. I went with the Nobu cup for my app (aka 3 pieces of sushi - salmon, tuna, and chef's choice which was fluke with some type of spicy powder on top). The tuna and salmon were delicious and great cuts of fish but SUPER tiny, layered on top of a mound of rice in a cup. The rice itself must have been seasoned with something because it had a very interesting flavor to it. Not bad, not amazing, just... interesting. The fluke was totally overpowered by the powder they put on top.The second course, Arctic Char with Jalapeño, wasn't much better tbh. The salmon was definitely precooked and then reheated because it was overdone and borderline cold. Flavor-wise, not terrible, but definitely not something I'd crave or order again. My coworker tried the rock shrimp and said it also had the same odd taste from the powder on the fluke. She wasn't crazy about it and I don't blame her.The mocktails were actually the best thing I tasted there, which sounds funny but very true. The Wild Orchid was artfully crafted and the muddled blackberries were the perfect touch. Pretty (and) perfect, if you ask me.Wouldn't necessarily say I had the most amazing meal here, but if you're looking to taste some bites without breaking the bank, RW might be the way to go.",9,8,9,Cristina G.,"Brooklyn, NY",239,409,960

I also love the rock shrimp which is cooked perfectly as well. I was pleasantly surprised when I tried the baby corn for the first time. It was baby corn served with large corn kernels in a truffle honey and curry salt drizzle which was to die for. The sushi is also so yummy and fresh I highly recommend the spicy scallops roll.

After some initial stumbling upon arrival and being seated, which is unusual, we settled-in for a night of dining.  The head waiter was excellent and described all the specials while taking our drink order.  We instantly ordered one of the special toro appetizers while we perused the menu.We decided on the Omakase menu and after the appetizer, we enjoyed seven more courses and dessert.  As you might imagine, no human being can consume the Omakase menu in under two hours.  In fact, it took three-and-a-half hours, so I still don't know whey they called me the day before to ensure I understood I would be dismissed from my table at their whim.Stars of the show were the Black Cod and the Wagyu Beef.  The tartar  and caviar course was served with the toro too cold, so its flavor was stunted, but it wasn't bad.  The caviar won the spotlight.  The oysters were small, but tasty.  All-in-all, it was another superb meal at Nobu.If you have a lot of time and a big appetite, definitely consider the top tier Omakase menu.Can't wait for my next Nobu meal!",1,0,0,Dick M.,"Brooklyn, NY",153,129,1

What used to be an elegant simple contemporary dining room was replaced by a large nightclub like setting along with top 40 dance music playing. The biggest disappointment was the food. Signature dishes that I was familiar with tasted overwhelmingly like the salt, soy sauce and garlic that smothered all dishes. Don't come here is you are expecting the original Nobu.

I opted for the Lunch special (Sushi + Sashimi) during a business meeting and I honestly felt the sushi was not up to par with the Nobu experience I have gotten to known from other locations. The sushi although not bad, was lacking the wow factor. Especially for the premium charged on top.

Service here is good and our waitress did a good job2. We wanted something different to try so perhaps what we ordered wasn't what they were know for but here goes:A). Spicy seafood soup : good although sadly the gf  felt there was msg in the soup? Really? @ nobu?B). Spicy salmon handroll : unremarkable but It was rolled so loosely that to by the second bite all of the ingredients were squirting out the end :-( c'mon guys : tighten that rollC). Wagu beef : cut too thick and was way to oily versus our most recent A5 wagu experience in Phoenix of all places. Even the slices were sticking together when we were taking pieces individually???? Really? Can't cut these pieces properly? And I'm still scratching my head over the fact that you're paying $40 an ounce with a 4 ounce minimum and they serve the wagu with fried onions???? Wtf?D). Our server recommended a off the menu fish dish which honestly was so unremarkable I can't even recall by looking at the picture what kind of fish it was.

2.0,10/22/2018,"I was skeptical about coming to this restaurant because I've been to the one in Malibu, and didn't think it was that great - especially with not many vegetarian options. But since my friends insisted we went anyway. I was, yet again, not impressed. We were seated right away which was great but it took a long time to place our orders and then everything was brought out one item at a time. We were told this ahead of time but since our party all eats very differently (for example me being the vegetarian of the group), we did request some items to come out as our entrees all together. They did not honor this request and therefore we all got brought our food at different times with long waits in between. The food was also pretty mediocre. The crispy spicy tuna rolls that my friend ordered were not even put together appropriately. The salad I ordered was literally just spinach leaves with a tiny bit of dressing. The vegetarian roll was the only one on the menu I could order and it was not very good and was so large that it fell all apart when eating it. Overall, I just would not recommend this restaurant. Very over-priced, which in my opinion would have been fine if we had had a good experience but it wasn't worth it.

The warm mushroom salad was outrageous as well as the eggplant miso. I don't usually think of dessert at an Asian restaurant but get dessert here. It's worth it!

3.0,9/18/2018,"As others have noted, the food here is... fine... It's mostly unobjectionable, but not something a seasoned NYC diner with limited time and stomach capacity would go out of her way for. - The ceviche was fair, a bit unidimensionally acidic, with some of the fish pieces over ""cooked"" and rubbery. The quality was about on par with versions that I (and other competent home cooks) prepare at home. A dining companion's mushroom soup included a broad assortment of mushrooms and a surprise kicker: wee slivers of orange. - The neta for the sushi assortment was so-so, similar in quality to the Kanoyama set meals you get in the plebeian dining room (not at the back sushi counter). The shari was not good, made with long grain rice, shaped too forcefully and overly compressed. Rice granules were hard, prepared in a way that may have been proper for short grain rice, but which resulted in unpleasantly hard long-grain rice. I won't get too deeply into the weeds with descriptions of the individual fish, but will note that the cooked shrimp used for one piece was extremely tough and overcooked, the anago was overly fatty and over-sauced. I know this restaurant isn't known for sushi and I ought to tamp down on my sushi snobbery -- but at this price point and pedigree, Nobu could do slightly better than it does. - Miso cod, the restaurant's claim to fame, was pleasantly silky and nicely prepared. - I'm not at all a dessert person, but the whisky cappuccino dessert was well made and well conceived, a highlight of the meal. The chocolate financiers with matcha ice cream were reportedly stellar as well. Everyone knows you don't come here for the food, though, really; you come for the atmosphere. The grand ceilings and immense columns, the wide expanses of space and the chandeliers upstairs are reminiscent of Eleven Madison Park pre-renovation. The hushed upstairs bar room is a pleasant setting for a business lunch (I envision out-of-town-visitors who have less exposure to Japanese or Peruvian cuisine) and supposedly a good place to rock out after work. Our server and runners were all quite nice, but I should note several service fails: - We were not offered the lunch set menu, but had to ask for it. - At our table and others where one diner finished before others, her plate was whisked away first. This rushes other dining companions to finish. I would expect an upscale restaurant in NYC to know better than to allow this. - We were presented with a check in the middle of our dessert course before we had asked for it.

2.0,8/15/2018,"First, I must say that I'm giving Nobu Downtown 2 stars because of the awful service provided by the hostess on the first and second floor. The cocktails and dishes we enjoyed there deserve 5 stars but the terrible customer service completely ruined my experience there.I made a reservation there for 2 people and specified  (it wasn't required) that I was going there specifically for the Omakase, which was a fixed menu for a combination of cocktails and dishes.When I was accommodated at a table with my friend we received a complete different menu for the Omakase, which did not include cocktails and was $25 more expensive than the menu advertised at the website. The waiter treated us very poorly, making us wait more than 15 minutes to give us the option of having the Omakase advertised on their website. It may sound like we were acting cheap but the cocktail Omakase was $105 per person + tips + tax, which isn't that cheap. We just wanted to enjoy the menu we saw advertised but that was denied to us at first. According to the waiters, the Cocktail Omakase was only available upstairs at the bar, which would be completely okay with us, but that option was never mentioned.To complete the terrible experience we had there, the hostess, who made the mistake, rolled her eyes on our way outside. Even thought the food was incredible I will never step in that place again. I was never so mistreated at a restaurant  and I really hope the management of Nobu invest some time on improving their customer service. I'm including pictures of the 5 course Omakase menu we had at Nobu Downtown. However, I would really recommend you to go to a better place if you're looking for a nice dinner experience. I have been to many restaurants at the same price range that offered way better service and had dishes at the same or higher quality level.",2,0,0,Isabela F.,"New York, NY",37,12,29
3.0,8/14/2018,"The first thing I'll note is that the seating arrangement is entirely weird and awkward. I wanted to take my girlfriend somewhere nice for dinner and decided on Nobu. Upon deciding, I called to make reservations, which were easy to make considering I called only a couple of hours prior to going. As soon as you arrive they treat you like a special guest, which is nice, but once I was seated I was thrown off. They sat my girlfriend & I in a round table that is used to sit 5+ people, and we had to sit across from each other. Besides the seating, the food was above average (I had the Toban steak), but the tuna (Bigeye Tuna Cut) was exceptional. The service was completely subpar, and when I dropped my tip on the table (While still seated) the server picked it up without asking, and counted the money in front of me (which is the main reason I will not return to this establishment), after counting the money I tipped him (which was more than 18%), he very rudely asked if the service was OK. It made for a very awkward setting as he seemed disappointed with the amount. All in all, I would not recommend bring a significant other to this establishment, unless you have money to throw around and/or eat out every night and can afford this, you can find me at any other given million restaurants in the greater New York City area.",0,0,0,Lawrence W.,"Miami, FL",0,3,2
4.0,8/12/2018,"Made a reservation for restaurant week in the lounge area for a Friday at 2:00pm. I'm very happy I made this reservation well in advanced because when I later checked for a friend, they were complete booked for all of their lunches until August 19th which is when restaurant week ends. I was told by management when I confirmed the reservation that restaurant week lunch stopped promptly at 2:15pm. The server reminded us as well, however, our food entrees took over 20 minutes to come, so we were left wondering why the management and service were so adamant about the restaurant week ending at 2:15 when our entrees took such a long time to come out. Makes sense that Nobu is known for their excellent food and not as excellent service. Onto the food. Since we were a group of 4 we got to taste the entire restaurant week menu except for the cauliflower steak. For appetizers we had the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño, tuna sashimi salad with matsuhisa dressing, salmon Poke donburi, and the green salad and baby corn with spicy lemon dressing. My top two favorites were the tuna sashimi and the salmon poke. For entrees we had the umami Arctic char, softshell crab tempura with soba jalapeño, black cod and eggplant miso, and the kinoko kamameshi with skirt steak. Everything was fresh, delicious, and flavorful. We also order cocktails and they were incredibly light and refreshing. Restaurant week at Nobu is definitely worth it. I'll definitely be back at this location for dinner. 4 stars for the food!",0,0,0,Lais S.,"Astoria, NY",7,44,135

3.0,8/7/2018,"So I would rate Nobu about 3.5 stars, and I'm not entirely sure whether 3 or 4 is more appropriate.  In the end I reluctantly settled on 3 stars.Based only on the quality of the food, they're definitely a 4-star place.  The food was tasty and well made.  My group ordered a fair number of items, and most were quite good.  The yellowtail sashimi in particular was very good.  The cod was very good.  Some of the salads like the kelp salad and the sashimi salad were very enjoyable.  The squid noodles and the make-your-own-handrolls were just ok, wouldn't order a second time.The larger issue with Nobu is that for the price they charge, the quality isn't really up to code.  Our dinner, without filling us, ran about 100 per person.  That's fine, but a price tag that high increases expectations - you need to *really* shine to be worthy of that.  Just having pretty good food isn't enough.  And in the end, nothing at Nobu really wowed me or knocked me off my feet.  The dishes were mostly just 'pretty good' with only 1-2 being really good and 1-2 being ok-ish.  The portions were also very small and despite splitting 8 dishes among four people, we left still being a little hungryThere are a lot of other restaurants I choose in the 100-per-person price range before I would choose Nobu.  If that's your budget, look somewhere else.  It's somewhat harsh to score Nobu a 3, but I don't really think they did anything to deserve a 4, given what we paid.",0,0,0,Danny O.,"Manhattan, NY",12,139,0

I still felt like I got a pretty good deal given the restaurant week menu, but portions were also T I N Y. I got the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno, and while the sauce was great, the jalapeno was definitely overpowering. The black code and miso eggplant entree I got was really good, but the portion size was about half a fist?? Not sure if the actual non-restaurant week entrees are bigger, because if not, then I don't think it's worth.

5.0,7/28/2018,"Celebrated my bday in New York so after researching dinner options I  chose Nobu based on their menu and their aesthetic. Let me just say I was not let down, I loved the place, the service and the food, mainly the food it was delicious! I made a reservation for 2 at 6:00 pm. We were seated right away near the bar area, pronely the waiter served water and gave us a few recommendations.  So we proceeded to order two drinks, El Jefe and a Grapefruit Martini we only had those two and trust you wish the were bottomless because they tasted amazing. We decide to share plates so we order Shishito peppers, Cauliflower with jalapeño sauce and the Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño (yes we like spicy), everything was on point! I love Shishito peppers and I have tried them in several places even abroad, this though were the best ever, so good we ordered another round.  Another cool thing is that when I made the reservation I put bday, so they brought a set of tiny desserts with candles which tasted awesome, and I got to blow candles for free! Furthermore, the service was good, really quickly, one down thing is that we didn't have one waiter it was several of them coming to check in, so we were not sure who to approach when we needed something. Other than that no complains.   Last but not least, the atmosphere is great, people are well dressed very conservative crowd (at least in the bar area).  The decoration at the bar was impressive and the high ceilings  always make everything a bit better.  One down thing is that their restrooms are only in the bottom floor which is not a big deal but still you have to go through the whole crowd.  If I'm ever in NYC I would deft stop there for Shishito peppers and to try something else from their interesting menu.",3,0,2,Katherine D.,"Cincinnati, OH",80,96,295
4.0,7/27/2018,"Come through the grandeur glass foyer as you enter an indoor strip mall, butchering the potential charm of the previous bank. Walk past the literal chase bank inception, and through the banal doors of Nobu Downtown. Sit either in the upstairs and counter-intuitively nicer bar room, or the main dining room resembling any other Nobu. The individuality of the bar area is the main factor of what sets this Nobu apart. Out of every Nobu,  this is respectively the least touristy of the bunch. However, it's still overrun with Asians, though this is new york, after all.Take your seats and prepare yourself for the orgy of plates coming your way. Then, expect to eat at McDonald's for the next decade of your pathetic life to make back the absurd amount of money you just spent on a meal. And in that year you can spend your free time envying the locals who can justify spending 6,000+ on a meal, but those people don't use yelp.Admire this Nobu's clear distinction and uniqueness from the rest, with the exact same menu for a solid thirty-one years, spread to twenty-two locations.

Even though they were busy, the hostesses made it a point to sit us promptly. The service was brilliant, our waiter was fantastic and explained everything beautifully. The food runners were trained so well- once they served us the food they explained the ingredients and made sure to point out how to eat the tastings. The food was amazing.

This is an always for me.And lastly the King Crab Tempura. Flavor pieces of King Crab meat lightly fried in breading.

There's nothing that I really need to say about this chain of restaurants other than:- the first place that I ever tried sushi was at Nobu in the Bahamas so Nobu has a little special place in my heart- the service was ALWAYS be shitty as that is what comes with the label of being a trendy restaurantI love their spicy garlic dish with prawns which is super healthy as it's just prawns with veggies and this amazing garlic sauce. It is a must-order and I feel like no one knows about it. Shh, now you do!I also love their rolls. Honestly, restaurants like this you don't get sushi by the piece but the rolls are quite solid and VERY cheap for an establishment like Nobu. This is a very safe bet! They are out of this world.The drinks are always on point as well and my favorite is the lychee martini!Again, there's nothing that I can really say other than this place is in an area where there are no trendy restaurants and makes it work in a beautifully redone place with awesome food.

2.0,6/18/2018,"Years ago I took my then-girlfriend to Nobu at its original location on Hudson Street. For the price we paid, I wasn't impressed by just about anything. They did a terrible job at space management, cramming as many people into a tiny space as possible to the point where you had to scream to hear the person across the table from you. The service was spotty--when the servers realized I wasn't going to order hundreds of dollars of food, they brushed us off. The portions were miniscule, so much so that after our date, we had to go to a pizza place across the street to fill up.Sadly, most of what I remember that was bad about the restaurant seems to have gotten worse. The space issues are a little better in its new location in the AT&T Building, but the food is still overpriced and underwhelming. Their prices are as big as their plates are little. Their signature dish was the miso-glazed black cod. I remember having that years ago and being blown away, so much so that it became an obsession of mine to try to make it at home. If you Google it, you'll find a bunch of recipes online that let you replicate it pretty closely-. In fact, over time I grew to enjoy my home-cooked version more than the restaurant version (which over the years seems to have evolved into a pale comparison of what it was). And all this at a whole lot less than $40 for three bites.With about 40 other restaurants in other tourist-heavy locations, it seems that Nobu has embraced its standing as a tourist trap. It's a bit sad that a restaurant of this caliber has been turned into little more than a glorified Hard Rock Cafe or Planet Hollywood, but I guess that was the natural result of the Hollywood partnership.

3.0,5/22/2018,Came here past weekend for brunch with a couple of people. It was around 2 PM at the time so the place was pretty empty. The location is very nice and kept clean.As for the food we opted for the lunch price fixe menu. I got the tuna sashimi salad while they got the poke tacos. The tuna was fresh and not chewy at all. I also tried one of the poke tacos. They were pretty small but delicious. For entrees they got the black cod which was pretty good. I tried it and it was perfectly seasoned and flaky but not overly cooked. I opted for the steak and rice. That tasted good too but it was nothing overly amazing. If I had to choose again I would go with the cod. As for dessert the carrot cake is a must. It was just added to the menu and I could see why. I usually don't like desserts because they're usually too sweet but the cake tasted perfect. Now for the negatives:When I was eating the steak I found a hair in it. However the staff was really apologetic about it and replaced my meal and even comped it. I thought that situation was handled very well.Another con was that service was kind of slow. It took us a long time from our 2nd course to get our dessert. The waiter even brought our check to us mistakenly thinking we had already gotten our dessert. They are however very friendly.Overall I'm not sure how I feel about the place. The food was good but sometimes the service was lacking.

2.0,5/17/2018,"This was my 56th birthday today and my wife took me, a trained chef to my first Nobu experience. We were sat in a dark corner with plants and rocks behind us. As I ate, I was fed on by mosquitos and gnats. I was surprised by the first sign of itch in the middle of my super small big eye tuna taco, by the time time the rock shrimp got there, It was full blown scratching on the entire left side of me, welts abounded and I hurriedly sucked down my Martini as my wife flailed at the gnats. Then we finally saw the culprit. Buzz, buzz. Never again‼ fix the problem in this great space!

2.0,5/17/2018,"A great disappointment overall. My friends and I (total of 4 people) came here to celebrate my birthday. We ordered the tacos, salmon teriyaki, chicken teriyaki, wagyu gyoza, and a wagyu tataki. We had to send back the chicken teriyaki to have it redo because it was too dry the first round. Even when they came back, the chicken was still dry but we didn't bother. The mini tacos was the best in our opinion. The wagyu tatayaki was nothing impressive. If this was at any other 3 stars restaurant then it's understandable but this is Nobu so I was expecting so much more. You're definitely paying for the experience, not the food.

Our waitress June was attentive and seems to really figure out what we like and gave expert recommendation - even not allowing us to over order! The Tuna Sashimi salad was exceptional and while not an obvious choice was outstanding. The tacos are good but small so order a few. The spicy edamame has a perfect sauce and just a slight kick. We tried the shishito peppers with miso which is different and quite good. For our main entrees we had the special soft shell crabs, attic char, black code (both the classic with miso sauce and butter lettuce) and an assortment of rolls.

1.0,4/12/2018,"The purpose of the following is to not rate Nobu as a whole but it is to rate my experience and what I witnessed. Tuesday April 10th, I went to the sushi bar at Nobu. I ordered and this Asian American man made my Sushi rolls. Thankfully he made them and not the other man accompanying him making the sushi. I was horrified at the other man making sushi next to him. What first made me watch the guy, was that when he knelt down to take a drink from his personal plastic thermos (the refillable one you take to the gym or everywhere with you throughout the day).It was a red flag for me because when he touched his plastic thermos he did it with his dirty fishy gloves and then went back to making sushi with the same gloves. Then I thought... that's his personal water bottle and I'm sure it's not wiped down before placing it under the bar. Whatever is on his bottle is now on his gloves and vis versa. I'm thinking of cross contamination on so many levels at this point but no, it gets worse. The orders that were coming in, he was touching the thermal paper with fish-blood gloves. He then dipped it into a container of water and stuck the orders to the top of the glass refrigeration station encapsulating the fish supply at the bar. He then went back to making sushi with the same gloves. ‍  My thought was,""If he's doing that now, that means he's been dipping his receipts with fishy gloves into that same container of water all night."" But wait, there's more.....About 5-6 mins later I then noticed both thumbs of his gloves completely break apart as he's making rolls and with bare thumbs and sweaty hands, continuing making sushi!!!! I know what your hands get like when they sweat in latex gloves.... if anyone doesn't know what it's like, it's like your hands after you've been in hot yoga for an hour on an elliptical. It gets funky in there and then this guy touches raw food!? Omg...  He kept making sushi without replacing his gloves. After continuing to make sushi with half bare hands and cross contaminating receipts, his water bottle and the damn food he was making, I decided to notify someone. I told my waitress to tell this guy to replace his gloves and that it was f***ing disgusting what he was doing.The guy replaced his gloves but not before dipping his hands into some sort of powder. I am unsure if it was flour, baby powder or talcum powder but whatever type of powder, it tells me that he had probably done this before he put on the original gloves that had deteriorated. This means customers were not only getting cross-contamination from fish but residue of some hand sweat slurry of powder and whatever else he had on his hands as he made their food.The only reason why I would go back is to order a glass of whiskey so I can throw it onto his hands so I know they're somewhat sterile. This man needs to be reprimanded and go though remediation.",12,9,0,Ryan B.,"Washington, DC",1,20,11

The desert was nothing like what I imagined. It's a baked goods and it's a little dry. My colleagues got the other option with fresh berry and pudding (?)

Next we ordered about 5 rolls, all different varieties. We each tried different cocktails.  The grapefruit one was my favorite.  The only disappointing thing about this experience was that there was no dress code enforced.  Most people get dressed up for a nice night out, and Nobu was allowing some guys to enter in hoodies and zip-ups.  They looked awful and they should have refused them at the door.  Also, the DJ was wearing a wrinkled white long sleeved t-shirt and a knit winter hat while playing.  He looked out of place.  I don't think it's right for them to allow patrons and even their own DJ to be in the restaurant looking like bums, especially on a Saturday evening.",0,0,0,J K.,"New York, NY",4,164,95

5.0,2/12/2018,"Came here recently on a Thursday night for dinner. As expected, nothing gets much better than Nobu. I normally go to Nobu57, but Nobu Downtown wins out of the two.Ordered a bunch so let's start: lobster ceviche, creamy spicy crab, rock shrimp, matsuhisa shrimp & caviar, crispy rice with spicy tuna, spicy uni shooter, baby artichoke salad(to feel healthy), wagyu gyoza, short rib and lobster tacos, and sushi rolls... sushi from Nobu should be for anyone's first visit -- crispy rice and sushi rolls. Nobu makes their rolls so basic yet they're the best rolls you'll ever have... the quality of the fish is unprecedented.The rock shrimp is a standard at any Japanese/Sushi restaurant, they out-do themselves through the presentation. The chili-garlic sauce/olive oil are perfectly done. The crispy rice is something you cannot replicate at home, it is served at the perfect temperature and everything on the plate complement each other perfectly. The baby artichoke salad is the best/most underrated starter on the menu, for sure. It's refreshing, not that filling, but enough for you to get exactly what you want out of a first/second course. The tacos are the best things on the menu but I recommend them to be ordered last, the taste is slightly overwhelming that you don't want to mix it with the other plates in front of you. The taste is super rich.For drinks, the grapefruit martini looks great but tastes better.

I'm sorry it's restaurant week, lunch time, and in the bar and lounge, but wooden disposable chopsticks? Like the ones I get from Chinese takeout? Albeit, nicer Chinese takeout, but still.Appetizers: The ""chef's selection sushi"" was two imitation crab California rolls, salmon, tuna, and halibut/fluke nigiris (3). It was so subpar in both flavor and quality. The ceviche.. I felt nothing. It tasted like nothing. Did you forget the lemon/lime?Mains: The rock tempura shrimp, tasted like a different take on almond shrimp, the batter was nice and light, the sauce a tad too tart though. Maybe they took the extra lemon from the ceviche. I mostly liked it, I'll give it to them. The cod was also good, very well done.Dessert: ""Chocolate financiers,"" oh my good, sounds so fancy. I pierced my spoon into it, and it required some muscle. Uh oh. It was hilariously terrible. Brownie bites from Costco taste better. Dry, lacking in chocolate. To say it tasted like a chocolate muffin, it still would've failed by the criteria.

A friend and I made reservations for lunch and were floored with their amazing service, ambiance, presentation of food, and of course the food itself! For $29 (lunch), the quality and portions of food really blew my mind. For appetizers we ordered the tuna sashimi salad, and the chefs selection sushi. The tuna from the salad was lightly seared and so extremely fresh and tender it practically melted in our mouths. The sushi came with one piece of salmon sushi, one piece of tuna sushi, and one piece of yellowtail paired with two pieces of a California roll. The fish was oh so fresh and delectable with a hint of sweetness and no overwhelming taste of the ocean. For our entrées, we ordered the black cod miso and grilled steak anticucho. The black cod miso was everything I have ever wanted in a piece of fish. Cooked to perfection, ever so juicy and tender, and somehow the taste of the fish wasn't overpowered by sauces. The steak was cooked to perfection with a delectable sauce that has a slight kick to it. Both came with a bowl of rice.Dessert was amazing as well! Their berries and cream dessert had sweet cream panna cotta (light and fragrant but not too sweet), topped with a tangy yet sweetberry sauce of sorts, with a sesame crumble and some fruit.

5.0,1/4/2018,"We had a great dining experience at Nobu.  I hadn't yet been to the new Nobu in the city and we came here for an early dinner on New Years Eve.  The restaurant is in a beautiful building, the bar area is gorgeous, with its high ceilings, and the main dining area downstairs has great decoration.Throughout our meal our service was great and attentive - more on that later.  We each ordered a cocktail to start (the diamante I ordered was quite good), and then we ordered a bottle of unfiltered sake with our meal.They had a special Omakase menu on the night of New Year's Eve, but we thought we'd get better value and selection if we just ordered a la carte, and I'm glad we did because I would've been sad to have ordered differently.We ordered the following:Toro Tartare with Caviar.  This was delicious.  I'm not sure if it justifies the price tag, but I'd probably order it again because I enjoyed it so much.  Note that this was not normally gluten free, and so we asked our server to put the sauce on the side and just bring out tamari on the side for my boyfriend.  We saw when this dish was ready, and there were 2 or 3 different people who looked at it over and over to make sure it was right.  At one point, our server went to bring it out, and then took it back again in the back.  I really thought this was great attention to making sure there was no gluten on the dish.  They ended up putting the sauce on the side so I had to put it on my portion on my own plate and my boyfriend got his tamari that he used. Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna.  This was unlike normal crispy rices that I'ever ordered because it was make your own.  They give you small cubes of rice that you then dip into the soy sauce and top with the spicy tuna.  Again, this was a small portion, but it was so tasty that I didn't care.  This wasn't gluten free.My boyfriend ordered the octopus since he couldn't have the crispy rice spicy tuna dish. I had a bite and thought it was cooked very well. It didn't have the slimy skin outer layer that octopus sometimes has when it's not prepared properly.Miso Cod.  Wow this was incredible.  The sauce is just amazing, the pickled ginger palate cleanser was great. And, the fish was cooked to perfection, even the skin.  This was naturally gluten free.Chilean Sea Bas.  Although cooked very well, I don't love cilantro (I don't hate it), and this had cilantro on it so it wasn't my favorite.  My boyfriend ate more of this one (which was also naturally gluten free) and I ate more of the Miso Cod.We ordered 2 cut rolls and then when we were done we ordered 2 more because we were still hungry.  The toro cut roll and the salmon cut roll (we ordered the salmon twice) were delicious. I didn't love the yellow tail jalapeño cut roll - note that the yellow tail roll comes with a sauce that contains gluten on it, and the server remembered to put it on the side since we didn't know.  I didn't particularly enjoy the sauce.Overall, for the amount of food and drinks we got, I wasn't shocked by the price, but it is definitely high.  I thought everything we ordered was delicious and the service was great, so I will definitely be returning.",5,1,1,Elyka A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",198,204,634
5.0,12/27/2017,"the prices are outrageous. this was my nyc holiday treat. the margarita with orange is really good, as is the crispy rice. the two standouts are the customer service- which is impeccable- and the black miso cod. the greeters upstairs had our table ready early, and alerted the team downstairs that we were on our way down. the aesthetics are also amazing, with the vaulted ceilings. worth a splurge",0,0,1,Taylor P.,"Manhattan, NY",385,247,426
3.0,12/27/2017,"My family is obsessed with miso black cod and we order it everywhere we go--Shanghai, Japan, Hawaii--if it's on the menu, we're getting it. We were excited to try Nobu's famous take on it. We thought it was good/okay (we personally like a little bit more caramelization on the fish) but it was definitely not the best and it was much more expensive. However, if this is your first experience with miso black cod, you're sure to love it because miso black cod is life! Aside from the cod, we thought the food was very average and mostly you were paying for the swankiness-factor.- Rock Shrimp Tempura with Creamy Spicy or Ponzu ($27): The texture was great but the ponzu was very heavy-handed.- Chirashi ($40): This was exceedingly average. The only pieces on the chirashi that stood out were the clam and the Japanese pickles. Everything else did not help justify the $40 price tag.- Power Bento ($65): My parents both ordered this bento and I got to try almost all the components. The waitress had confirmed for us prior to ordering that the portions were smaller versions of their menu counterparts. Thoughts on the components of the bento: - Yellowtail Jalapeno: Like the rock shrimp, the yellowtail jalapeno was also very heavy on the citrus to the point where I couldn't taste the yellowtail. - Assorted Sushi: The 3 pieces of nigiri were the saddest part of this bento and on par with drugstore sushi--dull, flavorless fish atop cold rice. + King Crab Amazu: Good flavor and texture--I would reorder this.+ Tenderloin Anticucho: Tender and had a little kick to it--I wouldn't reorder though just based on personal preference.- Black Cod Miso: The little piece included in the bento was not cooked as well as the full portion.",3,0,0,Debra L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",469,189,683

The place seemed less crowded when we arrived. We checked our coats and headed downstairs. We started with drinks while perusing the menu. My friends got some Grapefruit Martini and Winter Mule. I opted for a big bottle of Koshihikari Echigo Beer (half a liter for $14). As for appetizers, we ordered Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeño, Bigeye & Bluefin Toro Tartar with Caviar and Seafood Cerviche (I know, I know). Everything was great and up to my friend's liking so far. So we continued with our Assorted Sashimi and à la carte Sashimi. The one that stood out the most was the Bluefin Toro which was very tender. Well, it was $16 apiece. After 26 pieces of Sashimi, we were still hungry and decided to order 8 more pieces plus one roll of Toro Rossa (sushi wrapped in daikon sheets). It was an amazing dinner so far. The sea urchins were so great as they melted in your mouth!We ended our dinner with Pineapple Coconut Cake and Matcha Milk Whiskey. I wasn't stuffed. I really do want to complement our waitress for a great, probably one of the best service. Phew, we didn't break our bank account.

2.0,12/10/2017,"Been to the uptown location, food was never the best per price but I know it is also to pay for the 'Nobu' name. If you want a pure(er) sushi experience, I recommend Omakase house by Tatsu, even Yasuda, or Shuko if you have the bucks (love them all).Back to the downtown location, the Oysters and the grilled bass were very good as usual, but the reason for the very low score is due to the terrible sushi we have received for the night.It was for a company dinner and we were the first table for the night. (Group of 14). The sushi rice was cold and extremely sticky, and flavorless. For a ~6 dollar piece, it was insulting to receive a sushi that tasted like I would have gotten from a supermarket packaged a day before.I do not understand how we were one of the first table to be served for the night and how the fish was so lackluster and the rice did not have a hint of warmness to them.If you want sushi, do not come here.

This new location has much better ambiance then the previous downtown location and as always, the dishes are always well prepared and always taste exceptional. Heaven for your taste buds. The only problem that I have with NOBU in NYC locations is that at the end of your amazing dinning experience, the waiter comes over with the small credit card machine and you have to pay and tip in front of them while they are hovering over you. I find that rude. I always tip generously unless special circumstances call for something lower than 22%.

Each time I go I must have the spicy tuna crispy rice, which is served as crispy rice pops with spicy tuna on the side for dipping. It's very delicious and my favorite thing on the menu! I just wish the portion was a bit larger. The rock shrimp is also really delicious and great for sharing. For my main dish I always order the black miso cod, which is probably one of the best pieces of cod I've had. It's a bit pricey though and probably not worth the expense, but I do enjoy treating myself once in awhile.

If sitting upstairs, you could grab a booth and yes,dear New Yorker, who's always exposed to people, you could have a peaceful private time. Food is delicious. I recommend to try everything on the menu. Ok, I know, you expected some clarity on the food choices reading such a long review, so here you go(and enjoy!): shishito peppers is a great starter, yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño, crispy rice cubs with spicy yellowtail, ofcourse, everyone's favorite, black cod with miso(if you in a mood for tapas, get an appetizer size), rock shrimp tempura(I am not a fan of a fried stuff, but these... Omg! Omg! Omg!), grilled octopus with sour salsa, little kebabs of literally anything taste great, nobu tacos(must, must, must!) and mixed vegetables in garlic sauce are delish.Sushi are fresh, but average. California roll is satisfactory. I'd do blue ribbon for sushi instead.Drinks!!! Just go for it! Pina martini with pineapple is my personal favorite. Sweet, fruity, blissful.. Overall, Nobu is a place with great food, that's reasonably priced. Fish is the freshest and that's what you go there for, paying the price. Ambiance is pleasant. Service is good. That's roughly one out of 5 places where I enjoyed drinks so much.If you are not ready to pay $150+ for dinner for two(without alcohol), they also have 3-course lunch at the bar for $35(11:30am to 5pm), that includes loved by everyone black cod miso(actually, the only really good cod miso I've had in my life).

But the overall experience just couldn't be 5 star. A friend and I came here to celebrate my birthday. We ordered an assortment of plates to share, including tartare, vegetable tempura and the miso cod, then each got sushi for ourselves. A few minor things at first, like, it took awhile (long after we had our drinks) to get water, then when that ran out it was the only water we got until we were served the check. Then dishes started arriving, but, not always the ones we ordered or to our table. We got offered a few dishes we didn't order, and had to grab a few we did from someone who was misdirected. The pacing was really off as well. Some dishes they really rushed us through, trying to take away multiple times while we were still eating, while others we waited for the next course for a decent amount of time. It just wasn't the level of service I'd been expecting given the caliber of the nobu name. At dessert, the waitress really couldn't recommend anything or give praises to any specific dish. Really? I mean, yeah, in that case I'll pass on your $20 caramel brownie. We ended up finishing our drinks and getting dessert elsewhere. Though we made note of the occasion when making the reservation, no measures were taken to acknowledge it throughout the evening. Food, once again, was AMAZING.

Ordered the rockshrimp buns and trio of taco, Rockshrimp was nicely battered, sweet, salty and savory; kind of reminiscent of the mayo shrimp at Chinese restaurants. The bun was sweet and chewy. The tacos were delish! Chicken, veggie and short rib. All super flavorful and nicely seasoned. For dinner we had the omakase. My favorites include the sushi, unagi & rice, oysters, and the dessert. The sushi was so fresh! The rice was soft, chewy and not too acidic like some other places. The unagi was fatty and so friggen good. I want a full serving of that everyday. The three kumamoto oysters each had different sauce on top, each very distinguishable and delish. Loving that Japanese peach to cleanse your palate after the oysters. The dessert was so complex flavor-wise and also had a great combination of textures from the custard, sorbet, petals, and chocolate cookie crumble. I LOVED it!! In addition, that pastry chef has major skills to have that kind of calligraphy on the plate using chocolate. Drinks: so good!!!!!! The coconut sake refresca and grapefuit martini were divine!!!!!!! So worth it. You don't even taste the alcohol which is dangerous. Haha. Service: Wonderful. What else would you expect from this kind of place??

1.0,9/20/2017,"My friend and I arrived at this restaurant. The restaurant was completely empty with maybe two other tables seated with customers. We sat down and ordered our food. I am a vegetarian so I ordered a side dish while my friend ordered the deluxe bento box. My friend also ordered the tiny tacos as an appetizer. The waitress brought out to tiny tacos within 20 minutes of ordering. After 30+ minutes (more so 45 minutes), the waitress brought out my friend's deluxe bento box and decided to inform me then that, unfortunately, the restaurant is out of the cauliflower side dish. Her reasoning was that she was just informed by the chef about this. However, first of all, I understand the concept of ""don't shoot the messenger"" but this is all after having been served with the tiny taco appetizer and after the chef took his/her sweet time preparing the deluxe bento box. Can any decent human being, who is aware of the fact that Nobu Downtown is an upscale Japanese restaurant, think this was at all reasonable? There was ample amount of time and opportunity to inform me that the restaurant was out of a small side dish. The waitress asked me to order something else on the menu which she assured will be prepared immediately. When she brought out the mushroom side dish, my friend was done with his bento box (it was LARGE) and it actually came out 20 minutes later. By this time, not only have I wasted my lunch hour, I am leaving with an empty stomach. They insisted on packaging the mushroom side-dish as ""complimentary"". How is this complimentary when an upscale restaurant fails to promptly inform a customer they ran out of food, and inconsiderately wasted my hour. I would understand if the restaurant had been busy with too many customers to attend to. But that was not the case. There is nothing complimentary about this at all.

What we ordered: For appetizers: - Assorted sushi  - Of all of the appetizer choices, this is the best option!  This comes with salmon, tuna and Hamachi nigiri and two pieces of CA roll.  My eating partner said the fish was soft and tasted fresh. - Sashimi Salad with Tuna Tataki - small salad with 3 pieces of beautiful tuna tataki pieces, while the tuna was expertly cooked, with a light coating and the tuna was not overcooked, the overall salad felt a little disappointing - I had appetizer envy! For main entrée: - Miso black cod - This is one of Nobu's signature dishes and a must eat!  I love everything about this dish:  from the sweet marin and savory miso & sake marinade, the decadent, buttery and thick flakes of fish and the broiled crispy skin.  It has been a couple of years since I have been to Nobu, but this time they offered a bowl of white rice with the miso black cod!  While this may not seem important, I see this as a HUGE addition to their menu; I never understood why they didn't have rice on their menu. For dessert: Yogurt Panna Cotta - this dessert is my eating partner's favorite and she said she was highly impressed with the smoothness and creaminess of this version!  The panna cotta was topped with fresh berries, crunchy bits and a non-too-sweet syrup.

4.0,8/21/2017,"You don't visit Nobu solely for the sushi. Pros:(1) excellent service, although it is to be expected for the price range of Nobu. Nevertheless, it is refreshing to have every single staff stop and greet you as you are being seated. My glass was always full, and my waiter was always nearby. (2) gorgeous decor. Tastefully designed, modern, and lively. The upbeat lounge music, in addition to the lighting, makes nobu a fun place to dine with a group. (3) delicious baby spinach salad with truffle oil. Highly recommendedCons:(1) small portions. Don't expect to walk-away stuffed. (2) for the price, the sashimi plate was rather bland. Specifically, the presentation of the plate, or the lack thereof, was on par with most all-you-can-eat sushi buffets. Unfortunately, the lackluster presentation snaps you out of the the nobu experience that the restaurant so carefully crafted, even if only momentarily.",0,0,0,Luke Z.,"Denver, CO",200,19,10

Then, tuna tartar over crispy rice (do it yourself super yum)  spicy edamame, a couple of rolls yellowtail and tuna rolls, miso cod, Brussel sprouts, all good. My only negative is the portions are tiny so you need to order a lot. The service was not great and it was not packed. We had to ask for water several times and it took about 10 minutes for a server to greet us when we had been seated. The bus boy was good about clearing our table but the people kept walking around with our dishes asking every table if thats what they ordered. At an upscale place like this its unprofessional to be asking around if thats what we ordered. The food was spaced out ok but we got our edamame after some of our apps.

Refer the attached pics for every dish listed here.New style sashimi: Thin slices of sashimi, beautifully presented, best we have had in New York.Crab meat tempura: One of the most expensive dishes on the menu, but totally worth it. It's a must-try! Mixed seafood ceviche: Was surprised to see a peruvian dish on a Japanese menu.  So wasn't sure if it would be any good. Risked it anyway and we were glad we did.Black cod with miso:  Chef Nobu's signature dish. We HAD to order this, going by every review we read. It was indeed one of the best dishes on the menu. Spicy tuna and salmon sushi rolls:  This place is listed among best Japanese restaurants in NYC for a reason. The sushi rolls didn't disappoint either.Matcha tiramisu with pineapple ginger sorbet:  Lip-smackingly delicious!  Get this!The server was kind enough to help me surprise my husband  with a birthday candle on the dessert.

Since I was with a coworker and we each ordered different items I was able to sample twice the selection. The miso cod that the restaurant is so famous for does not let you down - it is baked tenderly with a sweet miso taste. Portion size was not that big but I wonder if the non restaurant week dinner portion is larger. See photos attached for reference. The atmosphere of the restaurant is elegant with high ceilings and spacious with an open view of the sushi chefs surrounding the bar. This venue would serve as a great option for business meals. This particular nobu location opened it not too long ago and is centrally located in the financial district very close to many subway lines.

4.0,8/3/2017,"Restaurant week means getting an ordinarily overpriced meal for cheap. So of course when the restaurant list came out, I immediately made a reservation for Nobu. I came here for lunch on Monday with two friends. We were seated in the Lounge area (the dining room doesn't have a restaurant week menu so make sure you book in the right place). I had the Sashimi Salad with Tuna Tataki, Black Cod Miso, and Yogurt Panna Cotta. The sashimi salad was tasty. I could've done with a little less dressing, but the tuna was on point. I loved the Black Cod Miso! The flavors are so perfect and they put just the right amount of delicate sauce over it. And the panna cotta, such great texture. The crumbles mixed with the smooth yogurt, such a great mix.Service was nice, but a bit slow. They didn't do a good job of coordinating when everyone's food came out so we had to wait for each other (totally fine except you try staring at the Black Cod Miso for five minutes without touching it). When we left, they gave us each a little box with two treats, what a nice touch. I struggled with deciding whether Nobu deserves three or four stars. I think if we had paid full price for our meal, it would be a three, but with the restaurant week deal, four stars it is.

They also don't understand the Japanese beers they are serving and are quick to tell you the wine list and the sake list instead. You get very little food and you will leave hungry because the servings are very small and expensive. Keep in mind, this is a chain so you can't expect high quality food coming from the kitchen. It's very much American with a dash of Japanese to make you think you are getting Japanese food.

For the tacos, it comes with one beef, one veggie, and one tuna (uncooked). They are tiny and you can finish it in one bite.

The miso flavoring was full engaged within the cod leaving each bite delectable with a side of eggplant also in the miso sauce. The yogurt with panna cotta was just enough sweet as it was texture to complete a satisfying meal for around $35 bucks (including tax and tip).The overall ambiance was beautiful. The upstairs with its high ceiling and columns and overhead art and downstairs with its exquisitely design overhang  creates a very romantic vibe.

We decided to just walk in since it's so close to our apartment hoping for to get a spot at the bar. Surprisingly it was pretty empty with lots of room. They must be losing a lot of guests by turning them away on online reservations. As for the meal, it was great as usual. We ordered a double order of the yellowtail and jalepano sashimi which never disappoints. The mushroom soup was very light with good flavor. The short rib and salsa was very tasty and super tender. It comes as individual pieces and keep in mind they are not a large portion. The black cod butter lettuce are a must order. The fried rice cakes and spicy tuna was ok- the rice cakes were a little chewy for my taste but my boyfriend liked it. I also order a side order of the mixed vegetables in a spicy garlic sauce which had a nice variety of veggies. Service was wonderful.

I always avoided Nobu during NYC Restaurant Week, only because a lot of peers have told me it's a waste of a 'discounted' dinner in terms of portion-size, but I do have to say I felt prestigious walking through the door. I went to Nobu Next Door, which is juuuust slightly more casual than its counterpart. We got the Black Miso Cod, Sushi platter, and the available desserts on the prix-fixe menu. The miso cod was divine and soaked in the most balanced sauce concoction I've ever tasted in a fish dish, but so small that I devoured it in 3 bites (practically could've chomped it whole). Sushi was good, but nothing stellar as it compared to other quality Japanese restaurants that serve fresh sashimi and appropriately seasoned sushi rice.I would only come to Nobu for the experience, or bragging rights of visiting the arguably most known and respected Japanese restaurant in the city. Other than that, you will leave incredibly hungry, having to buy a whole second dinner to fill your unsatisfied stomach or penniless from spending $$$ trying to fill yourself up.

I've been to Nobu 57, the original Matsuhisa, and I do not need the menu to order.  I've eaten the spicy creamy crab, the rock shrimp tempura with either ponzu or spicy creamy sauce, the sashimi salad, the black cod miso, the steak on the rock, everything.  It was always a treat, always a pleasure, always an event to go to Nobu.  I was in NYC this week and had heard they were moving, and by chance my friend (who will remain nameless to protect the innocent ) and I went to go see the new spot, and crush a few staples such as the Jalapeño Yellowtail, a Squid ""pasta"", a truffle oil salad, and a ton of sushi.  Say what you will, those dishes that he created are awesome. First off, the new place is in the lobby and basement of an old school building way downtown, on sort of a no man's land block, a super crappy block right by Century 21, Trinity Church, and Ground Zero/World Trade. Horrible downgrade in neighborhood. They basically went from the nicest neighborhood in Manhattan to the worst  block in a touristy, Wall Streetish area. Sucks. We entered, after a bit of confusion, since there's no front door. You enter the building like you are going to see a dentist in the building. The front of the house hostesses and manager were there as usual, all business,  dressed nicely, pretty, all business and pretty nice. I peeked downstairs, it looked legit, but I mostly hate eating in basements, sorry. You can go eat in the basement then finish you're homework. I prefer rooms with windows. Now let me just tell you, if you haven't eaten in the lobby of a building before, it's fucking strange.  It didn't feel like a permanent restaurant, in fact it felt like we were at what I imagine a cocktail hour for Kaiser Permanente's Christmas Party would be like.  Weird experience for certain.  This night was special though, from what I could tell it was Russian hooker night ( as opposed to just Hooker Night).  Everyone female there was striking, 5'9-5'11  and dressed in Louboutin's or Jimmy Choo's, skin tight jeans or leather catsuits and 1/2 shirts that exposed their perfect abs. The guys they were with were 5'4-5'8 with Moncler jackets. Everyone had heavy accents from what I could tell, it reminded me of the lobby bar at the Hotel d'Paris in Monte Carlo before heading to JimmyZ's (if you know what I mean, wink wink). Oh, almost forgot, the kicker is that none of the above could use chopsticks. Our waitress was pretty good, although it seemed like she could have used a little help.  The food was awesome as always; the food at Nobu is rarely a problem, but as they have expanded for over close to 20 years, they somehow have become a status symbol for cheeseballs and guidos, and their new digs in The Financial District give off that Drakkar Noir' esque smell.",1,13,0,Craig S.,"Los Angeles, CA",272,116,92

Service was outstanding, sit at bar :) spicy edamame, spinach truffle oil salad and ask for the custom Chad roll - yellowtail, jalapeño, avocado, crunch, creamy spicy sauce, cilantro, sesame soy paper.  CHAD at the bar was very very service friendly! And it was BEYOND DELICIOUS!! I cannot recommend enough!!!!!!!",1,0,0,Christy D.,"East Greenwich, RI",0,1,0
1.0,4/30/2017,"Here's the thing.  I've been to quite a few Nobu locations (Nobu 57, Miami, Malibu, London, and the former downtown location in Tribeca), all of which have fit the bill as being some of the most prestigious Japanese dining spots in the world.  The menu (largely a Japan meets South America fusion) is consistently acclaimed as some of the best in class across locations, with a lively and hip atmosphere, beautiful decor, and world class service.The new downtown location (which opened just a few weeks ago) meets all of these standards, with a notable exception being the level of service.  When I mention that the service was subpar, I should clarify that it was really, really abysmal.  I will also point out that I am the type of person that, when given a martini or two, will generally brush off a few lapses in service (even at high end establishments like Nobu).For context, we had an early dinner reservation for six on a Thursday night.  It took 10-15 minutes to get the first round of drinks to the table, but whatever.  The ordering process went smooth and the presentation of the first few rounds of food was stellar.  That said, by mid-dinner it was as if they brought in the incoming freshman squad to staff the restaurant.  The next round of drinks took 20-30 minutes even after we pointed it out to the staff.  They then brought out three rounds of the Black Cod with Miso (a $40 item), and then claimed we ordered all three after we pointed out that we obviously did not (yes, the Cod is one of the best items on the menu, but no one seriously orders three of them).  They then brought two of the three back out and set them back on the table, much to our bewilderment.  At this point, we're still waiting for drinks.  Finally, the boat we ordered for six people (which generally consists of a large assortment of sushi and sashimi pieces) came out, consisting exclusively of only 2-3 types of sushi rolls, yet enough to feed 13 very large human beings. After it was sent back after a bit of an argument, the staff brought the same exact boat back and set it on the table yet again.  A few tries later, we finally got it right, but at that point the damage was done.  We also had some friends dining separately that night who pointed out similar experiences.  All in all, a beautiful location, the very best of the best menu, all with a level of service that makes you want to never go back.  Maybe it was just some new location wrinkles that will soon be ironed out, but if that's the case, they have some work to do. Unfortunately, this was by far one of my top five worst dining experiences in New York City.",13,4,0,Matt K.,"New York, NY",262,93,22

Loved my experience here! Highly recommend the crunchy rice and spicy salmon 'cold' dish and the cappuccino/whiskey dessert.",0,0,0,Shaylah R.,"New York, NY",0,4,0
3.0,4/25/2017,"Love the look and atmosphere of the place. The staff was nice, but things moved really slow. Waited almost 15 minutes after being seated and given a drink menu before I had to flag someone down to ask who my waiter was. Food was good, no complaints there.",0,0,1,Blake H.,"Ormond Beach, FL",0,8,0
5.0,4/23/2017,"This marks the 8th Nobu location we have been to. Beautiful space and service was completely on point. Sad to see the TriBeCa location close, but the relocation to FiDi could not have been executed better. The accessibly to enjoy a pre dinner drink was a nice touch.As with all other Nobu locations, a consistent set of menu options made the order process seamless. They also have a menu page dedicated to downtown NYC.Crowd pleasers include: rock shrimp, miso cod, crispy rice with spicy tuna and of course various sushi options.Look forward to dining again.",1,0,0,Brandon G.,"Manhattan, NY",98,114,80

4.0,4/18/2017,"So after years of going to the TriBeCa location we were informed they went to Fidi.  Food and drinks are still good but that's probably because we had 3, 1.8liters of devil's killer sake.  Either way I'm having a good time",0,2,0,Law W.,"New York, NY",7,12,0
1.0,4/17/2017,"Had a reservation at Nobu this past Friday. We were really excited to try out the new location. We arrived about an hour early. Planned to grab drinks at the bar before dinner. There were no seats at the bar but the host was able to seat us at a high top table in the lounge area, which was fine. We were promptly greeted by a server who brought water and a drink menu... and then we were never acknowledged again. Made eye contact with our server several times and attempted to flag him down as well but were ignored. For as many employees as they had working that night, this is unacceptable. They were not too busy to take our drink order. We ended up foregoing our reservation altogether and walked out. Extremely disappointed and unprofessional for such a ""nice"", ""prestigious"" and VERY expensive restaurant. Never had bad service at Nobu 57. Took our business elsewhere and had a fantastic dinner. We will never be back.",6,2,1,Anna M.,"New York, NY",37,17,1
1.0,4/8/2017,"I stopped in to this Nobu for a friend's birthday. I placed my food order about an hour ago.  Everyone has gotten their food except for me (and we all ordered at the same time).  When I asked the waiter about this, he said that everyone was having appetizers and that's why I hadn't gotten my food. Well, here we are.  Everyone now has their entree - and I have yet to receive mine.  The manager just came over to talk (1 hour and 15 min later) to me and still no food... Could be opening jitterbugs, but unacceptable either way.Update: Thought the nightmare was over - and now there's a hair in my friend's food.   And still no food for me. Drink is watered down at this point. Very disappointed.",6,6,0,Patricia H.,"Hartsdale, NY",4,119,3
