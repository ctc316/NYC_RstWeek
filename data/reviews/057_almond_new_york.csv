2.0,4/29/2019,Once again Almond proves to be a huge disapointment.  The food (though the descriptions sound enticing) is unremarkable and at some times unidentifiable.  I was halfway through my plate when a waiter came and started to lift it from the table....at the same time asking me if I was done.  The bread was dried out and minimal.  The prices are exagerated for the quality and quantity of food served.  We brought an out-of-town visitor here for dinner and ended up having sincere regrets about our choice.,0,0,0,Jane R.,"Manhattan, NY",4,6,0
4.0,4/23/2019,Great restaurant that can accommodate large crowd of 13 including kids in the city where it was difficult to find reservations. The salmon eggs Benedict was fresh and free mimosa if you check in yelp. The duck hash was flavorful and the bacon was hearty. Chorizo omelette wasn't as hearty as the croque Monsieur. All in all good solid choice.,0,0,0,Tanya N.,"Eastside, Las Vegas, NV",0,48,60
5.0,4/21/2019,"Wow! Don't know why this got some bad reviews. Service was great, brunch excellent. Fried Chicken and Waffles, luscious Eggs Benedict with Smoked Salmon, killer Mac & Cheese with Prosciutto and Truffles, stupendous home fries. Mammoth portions (took half to go). Got out of here less than $40 per person with cocktails. As a native Manhattanite who is often disappointed by lackluster, overpriced meals, I have to say: this is my new go-to eatery!",0,0,0,Robert R.,"New York, NY",0,2,0
5.0,4/15/2019,"A truly exceptional dining experience! The staff are friendly, well-informed, and attentive. The food was delicious, exquisitely prepared, and thoughtfully presented. This is the best farm-to-table restaurant I've been to in years -- perhaps because they were doing this before it was a ""thing!""",0,0,0,Brian C.,"Cambridge, MA",574,52,1187
1.0,4/1/2019,"This place is pretty bogus. It's super expensive and the food isn't very good. The buffalo cauliflower was yummy but 6 pieces isn't worth the $20 it cost. We got here just in time to order happy hour margaritas and it was by far the worst margarita I ever had. It tasted like dirty water. At the end we get our bill and the margarita was $15 when it should have been $8. The waiter said it's because we aren't at the bar, even though the sign was directly above our table. We paid $30 for two small cups of mostly iced toilet water. Thank goodness we had a gift card.",0,0,0,Beth Ann B.,"Coram, NY",184,8,4
4.0,3/31/2019,"Good spot for brunch. Ordered the fried chicken and waffles ($23) which was extremely good, perfectly fried chicken. It came with a Tabasco syrup which added on to the flavor even more. The bill was also not pricy, which makes it even more enjoyable. I recommend!",0,0,0,Matteo G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",190,135,154
3.0,3/29/2019,"Um okay. I paid way too much for a pinot grigio that tasted just like my friend's chardonnay. We actually ended up switching. Our first round of drinks must have been leftovers from the night before. The second round was better. I ordered the rosemary flatbread. The dough was bland. The cookies leave a bit to be desired, but the cream into which you dunk them is great. The atmosphere is nice and the staff is generally friendly.",0,0,0,Jamie A.,"Colonie, NY",0,11,0
1.0,3/28/2019,"Beware celiacs!! They put flour in EVERYTHING including in the deep fryer (who DOES this?) for their home fries, so you get home fries AND flour. No warnings, but you will know it soon after your meal.

3.0,3/24/2019,"Oof, this was a letdown. Started with the Tropical Cup cocktail, then shared:+ Small mussels+ L'italien fries+ Agnolotti+ Meat & cheese board + Sticky toffee pudding Everything was just...fine. The meat and cheese board was heavy on the meats, with a combo of liver toasts and (mostly) hard cheeses, none of which I really loved. Mussels were yummy but could have been served hotter. The pasta and fries were tasty but not memorable. Dessert was good. Nothing too inspired happening here so I probably won't be back.",0,0,0,Gab G.,"New York, NY",208,1651,5011

5.0,3/17/2019,I'll start off by saying that the food here is great as well as the service.  All 7 of us enjoyed everything we got.  However we went on a Saturday night and the other people eating dinner were very odd.  What I mean by this is that literally every table was extra touchy feeling or having inappropriate conversations and loud.  We even asked a waiter at one point if this was some sort of event going she told us Friday night is gay night and Saturday is usually all sorts of eclectic people.  We were told later on by someone at a near by bar that usually Almond is known for that sort of stuff.  Otherwise we enjoyed our meals and people watching lol,0,0,0,N C.,"Franklin Square, NY",0,14,1
4.0,3/16/2019,Enjoyed a late lunch here on a Saturday.  Food was great but very slow and inattentive service. We did the price fixe $29 lunch. I checked in on Yelp and asked for the free glass of champagne but it never came. Started with a delicious broccoli soup and my hubby had the brussel sprouts. Fish tacos and chicken paillard for main course. This took more than 30 min to come as it seems waiter forgot to put our order in! The lemon tart was delicious for dessert as was the toffee cake ( which was also forgotten by our waiter). Great food if you can tolerate the poor service,0,0,0,Swarna M.,"Truckee, CA",0,70,3
4.0,3/9/2019,"Vibe is great! We had the cheese plate and mansour fries for starters, both of which were great. My friend and I shared the ribeye for two - was wayy to buttery and had too much rosemary flavor, so much that it overwhelmed everything else. My colleague had the lamb shank, which could be cooked better - very tender on some sides, but too chewy on the exterior. Giving four stars because of the apps and the killer dessert (you have to get the sticky toffee date pudding - going back just for this).",0,0,0,Aneesh K.,"New York, NY",452,1,1

5.0,2/24/2019,"I visited Almond with a few friends on Saturday and LOVED it - The restaurant is so chic & the wait-staff was amazing, along with the food! The price tag is a bit hefty, but the dining experience is worth it.We made reservations beforehand and no trouble getting a table - We were seated immediately. We ordered a few glasses of wine & picked a few entrees off the menu. I got the Saturday special (which was supposed to be Rack if Lamb), but instead we were informed of a slight menu change; lamb shank with some fresh homemade gnocchi. I decided to give it a try and I was happy I did - The meat was so tender and melted off the bone, and the gnocchi were delicious. Other dishes that were ordered were the sea scallops & roasted duck, roast chicken, and skirt steak. We also ordered the le grande Mac & cheese to share, which was the right choice - So creamy & truffley, definitely fed my soul!The meal was great, but my friend's steak was a bit tough, so she told the waiter. He quickly brought us out 3 desserts on the house to compensate! The sticky coffee date cake was my favorite. He also brought out a piece of the lemon tart and the chocolate pot de creme. All the desserts were sweet & hit the spot. We really appreciated Almond's generosity and care for their guests! I will definitely be back!",2,0,1,Laurel F.,"New York, NY",360,272,596
3.0,2/19/2019,"The overall ambience of this restaurant is beautiful. I really respect their farm to table approach. I ordered the price fix and was not very impressed. Their iced coffee was very weak. Also, our waiter was very nice but I asked another waiter for a spoon and he seemed very upset that I asked him- which I found odd. I ordered the broccoli soup and it was quite grainy. The chicken was good but honestly unimpressive - the taste reminded me of a grilled chicken snack wrap from McDonald's. My coworker ordered a ravioli that was spectacular and our buffalo cauliflower was sooo good I couldn't believe how delicious it was. Overall I have mixed feelings about this restaurant.",2,1,0,Stephanie J.,"New York, NY",223,79,194
1.0,2/14/2019,"Was so, so, so, so, SO beyond disappointed tonight. Came for Valentine's Day with really high hopes. We were so excited. The restaurant ultimately fell short and I highly doubt I'll be back. For starters, and the biggest problem, was that our server was AWFUL. Had no answers to any of our questions (was it his first day????? On Valentine's Day at dinner???????), such as, what's in the small seafood platter, how is the lamb cooked, what's a dry white wine you recommend? I mean, this guy had NO CLUE. ABOUT ANYTHING. He said every white wine on the menu was dry. I mean, what?!? He was also very inattentive, more concerned about a female couple leaving hand in hand than answering my questions, and never followed up, not even once after the appetizer or entrees were served (to, you know, ask how things are.....)...... I had to flag him down and ask for a bowl for our seafood shells from this huge seafood appetizer platter -- isn't it obvious that should be provided? It was overflowing with shells by the time we were done, really could've used two honestly. Would've never been acceptable or possible to put all of that on our appetizer plates. THEN, what I really wanted was partially sold out. They sold out of scallops. On Valentine's Day. By 9 PM. Affected both our appetizer and my entree. Whoever is planning your food inventory needs realty check. Seriously. You knew exactly how many reservations you had prior to the 14th. Come on. So, had to settle for something else, after being told I couldn't have an entree off the Prix Fixe menu (to sub for the scallops being sold out) and my food was really decent at best. Decent might be an over statement. I really could've made better pasta at home. Dry, bland, no sauce, horrible meat addition. I could go on and on about why it was so meh it hurts. My date had steak which had great flavor but in my opinion was cold???? This place is expensive. Our meal was well over $200. For the price, it should have been way more impressive than it was. Oh, and one of two bathrooms was out of order tonight!!!! I mean?!?!?! Striked out in almost every way on one of the biggest dining evenings of the year. Sorely disappointed and unless something majorly changes, this will be my last visit.",0,0,0,Anna M.,"New York, NY",37,17,1

5.0,2/8/2019,I love coming here after work. The staff really make a local feel at home in a neighborhood known for its pretentiousness. Always sit at the bar and always enjoy the company of all the bartenders. ALL the staff make this place a hidden gem in a city full of duds. Food is always consistent and the menu is friendly to all eaters. Daily specials keep it interesting and wine list is very diverse albeit basic but again; friendly to all palates!

2.0,1/27/2019,"I've been a long time Almond patron, but after my visit today, I'll think twice before going again.  i made a reservation for brunch with friends I haven't seen in a long time.  we like to eat at places with good food and pleasant ambience, and Almond meets those criteria.  i was excited to share one of my favorite lunch brunch places with them, and always had an enjoyable experience.well, today my friend ordered the nicoise salad, which boasted swordfish rather than tuna, but was an acceptable choice.  what arrived was a salad with a skinny, fishy smelling filet of trout.  we asked about the swordfish, and were causally informed, oh, we don't have any.  the order taker did not notify that the kitchen was depleted of swordfish, nor did he inform that a substitute would be made.    we asked if any other fresh fish was available to substitute, since swordfish wasn't available, and the trout wasn't appetizing, and they said, yes, we have salmon.  ok, bring us a piece of salmon.  what arrived after 10 minutes was lox, smoked salmon, not fresh fish.  they accommodated my request for poached eggs atop spinach on a muffin.  my requested crispy, well done fries, were oily and flaccid.  the wait staff is pleasant,  though clueless, ignorant, and unfamiliar with the menu.   and they don't seem to give a shit about how their customers feel about it.  you had a good run Almond.  but, you're chopped from my brunch menu.",0,1,0,Lori K.,"New York, NY",97,10,3

3.0,1/5/2019,Great ambience but food is average. It's in the neighborhood so I have often stopped by for a drink and really enjoyed my self as it's a nice large space with a cool vibe.

4.0,1/3/2019,"When you eat here, you're paying for the space and service. Prices are almost as high as you'd pay at a place like Gramercy Tavern, but the food is just good - not exceptional. We really enjoyed some dishes, like the chicken, the kale side, and the toffee cake dessert. However, the cod was overcooked. Nothing was especially unique or original. I'll go back if it's convenient to eat in the neighborhood, because I enjoyed the space, low noise level, and attentive (but not overwhelming) service.",2,0,0,Karen W.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,47,12
5.0,12/24/2018,"I've been to Almond many times... it was first introduced to me by my darling friend Ivan. Because the ""Mac & Cheese"" is so freaking fantastic! Since then, my long affair with Almond included... dinner with my old boss, lunch with my work bestie, dinner with childhood friends and now, lunch spot with my colleagues.  I feel like Almond is a safe bet but also brings the next level of food fan fare.  Their menu is somewhat seasonal, so they do have new dishes to try but they also have staples... like the Mac & Cheese side + the chicken liver + escargot! When in season - octopus salad! Service is always warm & welcoming. Huge bar area (happy hours are great here!) and it's very lively!

4.0,12/11/2018,"Very cool and trendy happening restaurant and they are truly trying their best or at least our waitress Ellen was. She is new and was so extraordinarily patient with my gluten and cheese intolerance issues. The chefs TOTALLY screwed up by putting bread into my order of black mussels and I didn't notice it until I ate about 12 mussels. I'm starting to feel really sick but it's not Ellen's fault although she probably should have sent the manager. Instead she brought me another order after 20 minutes is sweating it out and they were great and so was the gluten bread free broth. In retrospect and now that I'm itchy and my tummy hurts, she SHOULD have called the manager over or at least alerted her boss. This is serious!! One star off for miscommunication!!! Kids and bf hadLobster spaghetti Chicken which looked goodScallops and duck which was supposedly amazingI also had scallop and octopus  crudo which was very fresh and delicious. Gluten sucks and not in a good way!!!The manager just wrote and said ""sorry about the bread thing.

2.0,12/9/2018,"I was very disappointed with this place. My food (agnolotti) was cold when it arrived to my table and I hate to send food back but it wasn't even luke warm. So I sat and watched my friend eat her steaming chicken while I waited for my food to be reheated in the microwave...which is exactly what they did. The food was mediocre. We ordered the cocktail shrimp, flatbread, roasted chicken, and side of gnocchi. Overall the service was terrible. I used to work in restaurants for many years so I know what to expect. They brought out apps to the table and never brought app plates. They never cleared the apps and brought our entrees which there was no room for on the table. They did give us a free round of drinks after I sent my food back  which was nice but this place left a bad taste in my mouth. The front and back of the house both need an overhaul.

Service was efficient and friendly. We started with some escargots, which was tasty but not quite as buttery as I'd like. The duck confit taquitos were delicious, crunchy, lots of texture.Unfortunately the mains weren't really up to par - the dry aged NY strip was supposedly aged, but I don't taste the difference. It also had a lot of fat and gristle and the temperature was more medium than med-rare.

Brussels sprouts two ways has both baked 'croutons' and dressed shredded leaves, act like resin which rebinds our kinship. Sorry too much.

Food wise - the scones / bread they bring for the table is delicious, my husband LOVES the duck hash here and the fries are pretty top notch.

I got the Mac n cheese (more like penne and cheese) and the roasted cauliflower. Both were good but not anything ridiculous.- oysters and mussels: this was good (according to my friends).

4.0,10/29/2018,"Almond threw me for a surprise. Was looking for a mid-day cocktail with a girlfriend and we found this place on Yelp!The Check-in for a free glass of champagne with any meal was such a nice additive, very gracious of the business and actually made us stay longer for lunch (we wanted to start out with wine and we ended lunch with the free bubbly)!First of all, I'm obsessed with the salads here! They are packed with flavor and the dressings are exquisitely thought out. I came here with my girlfriend who is a vegetarian & she had no problem picking multiple things on the menu for lunch! :-)  So many options and I'm sure even a vegan would be satisfied eating @ Almond as well. What stood out:1.  Arugula and Beet salad- perfectly dressed, beets were cut into matchsticks and were raw which gave a delightful crunch! The goat cheese gave a nice tang and smoothness that was perfect to pair with the peppery arugula. 2.  Brussels sprout Caesar- this featured the vegetable both cooked (roasted so the edges got crispy) and raw. Wonderful portion to share for two of us. 3. Charcuterie Board- $17.95 worth of meats and cheeses. We chose 4 cheeses, honey, figs and the blue cheese definitely stole the show. Also, great bread! It was toasted perfectly. Not too much, not to little. Great with their high quality olive oil for dipping :-)And most importantly, service was on point! We sat outside because it was a gorgeous day. I've come here twice since and have never sat inside, but the decor looks really cute and hip so in the colder months I will definitely come sit inside for dinner.

3.0,10/24/2018,"I made a reservation here for a late Sunday brunch, party of three. We arrived a little early and were seated right away. After receiving a basket filled with homemade biscuits -- which were warm, crispy and flaky -- we ordered. On this trip, we opted for three dishes: the Almond Hash, the turkey burger and the fried chicken and waffles. The Almond Hash, a hearty combination of potatoes, duck confit and a poached egg, was very good, although the sauce could have used a little more punch (maybe some spice or citrus) to cut through the heaviness of the dish. The turkey burger was the favorite of the table, a juicy and flavorful patty with some tasty fries on the side. Would definitely recommend, even for white meat skeptics. As for the chicken and waffles, while the chicken was well-seasoned, it could have been crunchier, as could the rather soggy waffles. Overall a decent, but not outstanding meal.Our waiter was honestly a little rude. Although the restaurant was busy, he didn't seem overburdened or in a rush. When we did interact, he was apathetic and not very friendly. We did, however, get our food and bill in a timely fashion. The hostess at the door, on the other hand, was pleasant and super friendly. All in all a solid, but not particularly memorable dining experience in the Flatiron District, although I would try Almond again for dinner. If you want a really stellar brunch (and are willing to spend a little more), head further east and try Park Avenue Fall/Winter/Spring/Summer.

I had high expectation for this place based on the reviews, but I was thoroughly disappointed. I got the hangar steak au poivre and my sister got the Mac and cheese. Steak smelled/tasted funky and was not cooked the way I had requested. The meat was not tender and definitely not worth close to $30. The Mac and cheese was ok the first couple of bites, but we just couldn't eat much more because it was salty and just too heavy - portion was huge!

There was a long wait between clearing the first course and serving the second, and then our waiter was abducted by aliens. While we waited for our dishes to be cleared and dessert menus to be handed out, he was apparently being used by little green men to see how human digestive systems function.

2.0,5/30/2018,"Been here quite a few times over the years, mainly for events, and always thought the food to be unmemorable but inoffensive. Will only speak to my latest experience in this review.The Good: The small portion mussels were actually quite a lot - great deal! It came with tasty garlic bread (plus they ""pre-soak"" a piece of bread in the flavorful broth). I also tried the scallop crudo which was very fresh. The wine was a generous pour.The Meh: The fries they are supposedly known for ... very average despite the various nice sounding toppings. Probably the blandest truffle Parmesan fries I've ever had. I'm also not partial to largely cut fries that retain the potato skin (but without flavoring said skin).The Bad: The cocktail I got was sickenly sweet, despite my specifically requesting they cut the sugar/sweetness, or tell me if they can't so I can order something else. The service was slow and beyond annoying - the server, who was a bit stuck up, incessantly demanded to know which dish we wanted out as an appetizer. However, I will say we perhaps just got hit with a dud with that one, as there were other servers around who were very pleasant and helpful.The Ugly: Mosquitoes! The restaurant opens up to the outside when weather allows, which creates a nice ambiance. However, in the warm days of NYC, that also means the mosquitoes get a buffet of patrons, even if they are seated well inside away from the open screens. They really should take some preemptive measures there IMO.Overall, probably not a place to which I'd return of my own volition.",1,0,0,Melissa M.,"New York, NY",39,198,50

In my opinion the server should have told us refills are not complimentary.  Then again, we barely saw the server during the course of our meal.  My comment to my wife was that the server seemed to lose interest in us.  The rest of the serving staff was fine.",3,0,3,Lenny K.,"Edison, NJ",303,768,394

They have delicious barrel aged cocktails and a few nicely crated ones on their menu, and the food is simply delicious. The abodo pork chop is tender and flavorful, all the different croques gratins are lustfuly intriguing and the buffalo cauliflower appetizer is one of the best ever. Dessert wise, the date cake is a must.

5.0,2/8/2018,I always love having dinner at Almond when I'm in town and this time was no exception. It was Restaurant Week in NYC so I partook in the pre fixe meal that had 3 courses. Brussels Sprouts for the first course - like a Caesar salad. Delicious! My main was the Adobo Pork Chip. Perfectly cooked with wheat berries and corn nuts! Delicious and great flavors! And dessert - chocolate pot de creme. Yummy!! They have a good wine list and beer selection also.,2,0,1,Renee W.,"Littleton, CO",177,668,23

4.0,2/2/2018,"I went to Almond for restaurant week after researching restaurants in the area. I'm so glad this is the restaurant I decided on! I got the brussels sprouts hot and cold, striped bass, and banana bread pudding. The brussels sprouts were amazing, probably my favorite part of the meal. My dining companion had the buffalo cauliflower, which was also good. The cauliflower was cooked perfectly. The bass had a nice combination of flavors. I almost always order the fish at a restaurant, and I was impressed with how this was prepared. The dessert was ok. Not the star of the evening, but good enough to be eaten.The service was good. Our waiter was kind, enthusiastic, and attentive. The ambiance was comparable to other places in the area. Maybe a little loud, but at least they tried to deaden the echoes with acoustic tiles on the ceiling. I would definitely recommend coming here!

Based on previous reviews we ordered the brussel sprouts chef salad and lemon ricotta pancakes. The brussels lacked distinct or bold flavor and the pancakes were pretty standard with a bit of lemon spread and a few pomegranate seeds. Both were ok, but nothing to be overly excited about.

This dish was so amazing that I'm already planning to try to replicate it at home. For my second course, I had a lovely dish of bass served with kohlrabi and bok Choy with a miso sauce.

It took a significant amount of time to receive our drinks, or to even flag down our waiter. Also, after we did finally receive our drinks, the waitress who brought it out spilled it all over the table (and me). After doing so, she apologized and wiped the table; however, she did not offer to top off my glass, which was really surprising and left a bitter taste in my mouth. Moreover, we asked 3 different people if we could get some biscuits with butter, which they only brought 40-45 mins into our meal... aka 3 mins before we received our food.

Pretty tiny amount of curd and blueberries for the dry stack of pancakes. I called for more lemon curd so that the pancakes could be edible. There's definitely a whole lot more for meat eaters. Even the bloody mary was sour and just, not good.

She proceeded to tell us our table was at 11am - luckily we had our opentable confirmation and we're able to get seated in the empty restaurant. Service was friendly and food for the most part was good. I will mention that the steak that we ordered was probably one of the most poorly cooked pieces of meat I've ever gotten anywhere.

1.0,9/15/2017,"I'm having a very difficult time reconciling all the good reviews for the experience I had.  I was actually warned before going to this place that the service was going to be poor, and the food was going to be mediocre for French cuisine.  I had been to this restaurant before, but only had appetizers and wine.  I should have listened...Here was my experience..1. We get seated outside, and it literally took a HALF HOUR (after we flagged down the waiter) to even order a drink.2. People who got seated after us already had their meals before we even got to order our food.  The waiter even came around to ask the other tables how their meals were, skipped OVER our table even though I started talking to the waiter after making eye contact right in front of me (in which he ignored me), and finally we were able to order.3. I ordered the ""special"" for Friday night, which was shrimp scampi, and my friend ordered an appetizer.  I was told the special was $31, when I got the bill, it was $32 (not a big deal, but STILL).  4. When food came out, mine was served first, and I had to wait to eat as my friend (who ordered a simple appetizer) had to wait another 8 minutes before hers came out.  This clearly should have been served at the same time and my food got cold.5. For a $32 (!!!!) entree, it was disgusting and almost criminal to charge.  No flavor, the shrimp (only like 5 of them) had a funky after-taste like it had been defrosted and was not fresh.  There was absolutely NO garlic flavor and barely salty (meanwhile, my friend's dish was incredibly salty).  The broccoli in the dish was disintegrated into mush.  The actual flavor reminded me of the smell of cardboard.  So odd.6.  The waiter never came around to even ask us how our meals were, and didn't offer more bread.7.  The outdoor patio area that we were seated at had wooden planks that were loose, so whenever someone walked across the planks near our table, our whole table shook and actually dipped sideways -- this would happen approximately every 15-30 seconds. (Get that fixed!)I'm sorry -- but this experience was uncalled for and extremely disappointing, given the location and how much they had the audacity to charge.  This place can have so much potential with its level of charm and appeal -- which is why I picked it for a reunion with an old friend -- but the service and food experience did not meet even basic expectations.",2,0,0,Brooke J.,"Stamford, CT",195,3,0

Wait staff were very attentive and food was served rather quickly! I felt their menu was a bit limited, but when Chicken Pillard is on a menu I am always a fan! Boy was it delicious. While Chicken Pillard is available on the pre fixed lunch special (select entrees and an appetizer are sold for $24), I opted for it al a carte. It was delicious and a generous portion. My meal came with 2 chicken breasts that were pounded thin and topped with arugula and avocado. I asked for no cheese and dressing on the side. I honestly didn't even need the dressing since there was a garlic and red pepper sauce light glazed on the plate. Bread served to start was delicious and freshly baked.

1.0,6/3/2017,Another typical overpriced uninspired restaurant in NYC. Ordered at 8pm and didn't get our entrees until 9:30. They did not even apologize or offer to do anything for us until I complained. Then the manager gave a very unheartfelt apology and said sometimes these things happen. Well the restaurant wasn't that full and each entree was well over $30 so these things should NOT happen. Don't bother!!,1,0,0,Tina D.,"Mamaroneck, NY",0,23,0

We came sort of early, around 7pm, so the place wasn't packed. The waiter was okay; he took our order, refilled our water, and checked in on us once, so nothing to write home about. The food was really good. My date ordered the truffle mac 'n cheese, which he loved. I had the steak frites, which was really good.

We casually walked in for a happy hour at 4 while passing by the neighborhood (since our baby was sleeping in the stroller, it was going to be a real quick visit for one drink and oysters). But only after we were seated, they told us that the happy hour was for the bar so we had to move. The restaurant was empty. It was still fine - we know a lot of restaurant do limit their happy hr to the bar -although it didn't say anything on the sign at the entrance. After we ordered, suddenly someone came over and asked us to have a table instead since the bar will be soon crowded????! He was not our server so I assume he was a manager or something but when we told him we were here because of happy hour, he said ""I will let you have happy hour at the table for this time"" seriously??? If we hadn't started our drinks we could have walked out. He was seriously rude and the place was still empty until we were leaving. Never coming back.

3.0,4/23/2017,"It is a decent spot for French food but nothing special. The restaurant is beautiful. It is spacious in the back and a good place for my friends and I to catch up and talk business. In my opinion, it is a better place to meet up than to eat. It is known for its brunch but I went for dinner on a weekday. For appetizers, we ordered the flatbread and meatballs with ravioli. I really like the flatbread. The bread was solid and topped with pancetta [Italian bacon], brussel sprouts, cheese, lettuce, and a fried egg. I did not like the meatballs at all. They were dry and not very flavorful. The ravioli was decent. For my entree, I ordered the tile fish. It was covered in chowder and included clams, potatoes, and beets. The tile fish was a good portion. It was not the best fish I have ever eaten but solid. I really liked the clams with the dish. On the other hand, I thought the chowder was very average. It tasted like chowder out of a can. Overall, I enjoyed my dish and ate all of it but was not blown away. The one thing that I thought was awesome was the side of brussel sprouts I ordered. It was loaded with bacon and caramelized walnuts. The brussel sprouts had a nice char to them. The bacon complements them very well. I absolutely loved the caramelized walnuts.

4.0,3/31/2017,"One day, when I'm in my forties, or perhaps sooner, I will come to the realization that my life is half over. There will be a moment where I am no longer looking forward to my future, but back on my past. This is what initially brought me to Almond, as the nut itself is the epitome of a mid-life crisis. And while I am not in the midst of said crisis at the moment, I entered Almond to see what life had in store for me. One of my favorite aspects of the menu is the fact that the daily specials are listed at the top, ordered by the day of the week. At first, I was flabbergasted by this. How dare this establishment tell me what ""special"" is? But after my furor subsided, I began to read these items. For Thursday, the special was poussin, which I later learned, after eating it, is a baby chicken. Good. There are far too many adult chickens being eaten. I was very happy to be saving these adult chickens. In an industry such as mine, I try to do everything I can to be humane. Including, as it were, eating chicken toddlers. And then it hit me: I remembered why I chose Almond: one day I will be looking back instead of forward. For this restaurant, it can remind me, even for a moment, that today is not that day.

We initially sat inside but the AC was way too strong so we opted to transfer outside and our waiter was very accommodating. 2-. Almond is perhaps one of the few restaurants that provides patrons with delicious and fluffy mini biscuits, apple jam and butter.3.- The brunch menu is very diverse. We opted for the two tamales with one egg, eggs Benedict with chicken sausage and the huevos rancheros. They were all exquisite and nicely presented. The eggs were cooked to perfection, the chicken sausage was crispy but tender inside with a nice kick without being so spicy. The huevos rancheros were also excellent. The portions are enough to satisfy your appetite. The waiter constantly returned to refill water, to bring more biscuits and just to check on us.Overall wonderful brunch experience.

3.0,6/24/2016,"I came here for brunch on an Saturday using Opentable to make reservations. Overall - Place is your typical brunch spot with overpriced food and drinks but decent food. Environment - Saturday brunch was busy. Patio was open. Place was bustling. Didn't seem to be too long of a line for those without reservations. I overheard something around the tune of 10-15 minutes which is pretty good on an Saturday brunch during the summer. Place overall look clean and had nice decor around that gave it a home like feel. Service - We were immediately greeted by the host when we walked in and checked me in. However - they would not let us sit without all of the party here so I had to wait for my party of 4 to arrive before I could be seated. The waiters and runners were all very busy so I had trouble waiving down my waiter and getting our waters refilled and our orders placed. They were courteous and apologized for the delay in their service as it was peak time. Food - Food was mehhhhh at best. Typical brunch food. We ordered the following:1. Another Kind of Eggs Benedict - Essentially eggs benedict with an small piece of salmon on top. Eggs were perfectly poached but the salmon portion was small. It was nicely topped off with some capers(I think) and came with sauce. Sauce tasted fresh and like in-house. Sounds like a glowing review for this right? Here comes the down parts - the english muffin and potatoes it came with were downright dissapointing. English muffin was not toasted and tasted as if they were old bread. Potatoes were way too seasoned. Ask for it to be lightly seasoned. - Recommendation: Meh - up to you2. House Made Brioche French Toast - This was on point. French Toast was made right. Did an really good job with this one. Topped off with some fresh fruit. - Recommended3. Salad Nicoise - This was not an good salad, mainly because of the trout it came with. Salad tasted fine itself and the vinagrette was good but the trout just downright sucked. It tasted like it came out of the frozen aisle and they pan seared it. Just bad. - Not recommended4. Buttermilk Waffle - Just No. Tasted like the waffle you get from hotel. Don't know how to elaborate anymore. Just no - Not recommended.5. Bonus - They give you free biscuits with an homemade jam and some butter. These were on point. Absolutely on point - I wish I could have asked for some to take home. Just on point. Kind of weird for it to come midway through our meal though. Price - Overpriced for the quality and quantity of what you get. Eggs benedict was 18 bucks and wasn't filling. French toast was 15 bucks for 3 slices. Hard to justify 5 bucks a pop. Waffle was also 15. Just not worth it. Salad Nicoise was 18.",3,1,0,Kevin H.,"Washington, DC",285,163,338

I noticed at the end of the meal and immediately approached the maitre d'who acknowledged the spill and said at the very least the restaurant would pay to have my bag to be cleaned (Although I knew it would not work, because the bag is vegetable tanned leather which immediately soaks up liquids, especially red wine). Needless to say, after several calls with the owner, he decided not to help or compensate me in any way. Moreover, he raised his voice several times, was accusatory, ill mannered, condescending and completely unprofessional. Perhaps if he had been nice, understanding and/or apologetic and still didn't compensate me, I wouldn't have been nearly as upset. It was a shame to be treated so terribly.

Overall, the meal was perfect. We shared a brussels sprout salad as an appetizer and it was fantastic. I had the duck and potato hash and my daughter had eggs benedict our way -which is eggs benny with salmon. We ate it all and enjoyed it immensely. The only reason to hold back on the 5th star was that I think the food lacked flavor. I had to use a lot of salt to taste my duck and potato hash. Also, I think it should have had more duck - there were just a few bits of it. In spite of this, I highly recommend the hash!!

Here's why.My review a few weeks ago lauded the food but was down on the service, which I felt prioritized two parties there one night at the expense of somebody else. The owner got in touch with me right away and apologized.If you're a regular of MC3, you know I'm all about looking out for the consumer (see my review of United Airlines), and this gesture meant a lot to me. It also allowed me to stop being all neurotic and stressed about the service and to focus solely on the food.My friend Paul and I had the following items: cheese plate, le grand Mac N Cheese (an entree, but we had it as an appetizer), braised beef, oysters (east and west), mussels, duck, scallops (sashimi), and some creamy desert thing with strawberries, plus sorbets.All of it was YUM, but my personal favorites were the braised beef and the Mac N Cheese. Paul kept saying: ""This is soooo good"" to the Mac N Cheese like 10 times. I said: ""Is something wrong with this guy's brain?!""He's an odd guy, but I think the taste overwhelmed him and he went even more bonkers for the hour!

Describe what you even remotely are interested in having, and he knows where to direct you.  With a warm personality willing to chat, he doesn't hover and disrupt as some bartenders/mixologists tend to do.  Following drinks, I moved to a table in the dining room where I was being taken care of a kind, soft spoken server, Paige.  She led me through the menu with ease.  I got the tomatoes and bacon croque. What a dish!!! So tasty and filling. No need for a side or even an app. Just go for it! It WILL satisfy.  All in all...a SUPERB night.

3.0,4/11/2016,"Been here three times.  First brunch, second lunch, and third dinner.  Brunch on weekend was good, met expectations, atmosphere was lively - almond hash sounded special on the menu with duck confit and duck cracklins with poached egg, but wasn't really all that exciting on a plate or the palette.Lunch on weekday was quiet, and food wasn't as good.  Had a turkey burger with sriracha mayo, cheddar, and avocado - which, again, sounds exciting on paper but was just too salty on the palette, the even saltier fries made it worse.  Friend had cavatelli with veal and pork sausage, which oddly, was bland and didn't have enough flavor.  Cavatelli of course, is also not easy to plate well and make pleasing to the eye, since it takes a lot of skill to make maggot looking pasta look presentable - but no effort made on this part.Finally, dinner - started out great, 3 ppl shared an almond petit - which is a 2 level seafood tower, 5 of everything in the seafood section.  Not the best tower ever, but great nonetheless. the whiskey drink i had, hot tin roof, was also pretty good - good mix and use of both citrus and espresso.  But then, after the seafood app, we waited nearly an hour for the entrees.  No one to check up on us, no one to pour water, thank goodness the conversation was good.  It was busy and lively, sure, but nearly an hour wait between app and entree?  They lost a solid star for that.Anyway, not a bad choice for the neighborhood, worth a visit if there's no wait, brunch is better than other meals...but at that price there are better options in Flatiron/Gramercy/Chelsea area.",2,0,0,Reggie L.,"Jersey City, NJ",95,33,9

For my entree, I had the cedar plank mackerel.  The fish was hiding, out of sight.  Harder than finding the black and blue colors of that infamous, friendship-ruining dress.  Even after looking at my photo, I'm still searching for Nemo.  For a ~$30 price tag, I wanted a substantial piece of fish.  The one they gave me was so small, it was akin to the size of the marinated, refrigerated ones you'd find in Mitsuwa Marketplace.  After giving it more thought, I realized that those go for less than $10 for the same size(& comparably delicious).  What a hefty mark-up.  The fish was, in the very least, marinated and cooked well.  I thought it was a nice piece of protein. However, the accompanying bits of pickled carrots were uncalled for.  The salad wasn't enough to fill me up either.  Still, there was more of it than my mackerel.  The fries were OK; they came in 3 different styles: American, Quebecian(Quebecoise), and Italian.  We had the Italian version which was fries with sprinkled parmesan cheese on top.  If not for the garlic aioli we asked for separately, these fries would have been even less spectacular.Too expensive and not enough substance for my taste.",3,4,2,Jenn F.,"Brooklyn, NY",767,372,2548

I always try to avoid it as I do my homework thru yelp and reading up on the restaurant. At times, you are not immune. This was one of those moments. The restaurant was pretty packed when me and my guests arrived. It's important to make a reservations if you are planning to dine here as there weren't many open seats. We were quickly seated and given the menu. As all quality restaurants in Flatiron, you are expected to spend some $$$. The price is forgone conclusion but you expect a very good meal. Our waitress was a bit jittery as she struggled to explain some of the items on the menu. It might be   that she was busy with other tables or just simply having a bad moment. After hearing the recommendations, I decided to order the pork chop with potato wedge and cabbage. The food was well plated. After I took the first bite, the moment hits. The pork chop was dry and was over seasoned- too much pepper, salt, and sauce. Once the seasoning is off, the meal is wrecked- it's one thing to be under seasoned and then you can add some salt and pepper. If it's over, there's not much you can do.

Service was slow!  And no recompense for a drink dropped all down my shirt and pants. One person in the party really had a hankering for the duck confit which was not on our fixed menu and the waiter said he couldn't do anything, not even additive.

4.0,2/7/2016,"We came here for dinner and it was great.  I started with the rosemary flat bread which was served hot and delicious.  Their menu is most seafood and meat so not the best place to bring a group of vegetarians.  They offer ""Meatless Mondays"" with a few vegetarian options but I still would not highly recommend this place for vegetarians.  One friend had the scallops which she enjoyed.  The entree macaroni and cheese is not vegetarian since it has prosciutto in it.  One friend had that and she loved it.  For my main course I ordered both the side of macaroni and cheese which is vegetarian and the chive gnocchi, both were excellent.For dessert I got the gelato trio.  That night they were serving chocolate, cinnamon sugar, and passion fruit.  The fruit one was too tart, but I loved the others.  The restaurant is huge for Manhattan and there looked like it could accommodate some private events of varying sizes.I had half of the mac and cheese wrapped to go and I was given a ticket with a number on it. I'm not sure if I was supposed to bring that with me to pick up the food when I left but I ended up not receiving my to-go bag.  We did linger for some time after we finished so I'm not sure why I did not receive it but I ended up forgetting about it.  I will be back to try brunch.",2,0,0,Nicole C.,"Manhattan, NY",109,121,477

They have a long bar and the bartender tried really hard to sell us on some Two Forks beer from Long Island - gave us a try after changing out the keg. Moved over to a table - they have some outdoor and indoor seating. Couches up front for those waiting or just lounging with a drink. Very low-key in general, but noisy.Bread was rock-hard, even with butter and olive oil. House-cured meats, small appetizers good to share (escargot with bread & garlic & olive oil was delicious, the lamb meatballs was 4 small meatballs... not so exciting). Had the flank steak with Bordelaise sauce - a pretty good combo with the steak done ok in the center, the end pieces were like rubber, though - overcooked well past medium rare. Ditto with the strip for my friends at the table. Fries were good.Waiter took the order and disappeared for a while, dinner came, and he reappeared for drinks once to be refilled, otherwise the other staff came by to clean the table.Overall, didn't live up to the hype.

2.0,1/2/2016,"My review is solely for their New Years Eve party. The price was right and the location was great. Even the music was great. First the service. While some went over the top to be courteous, some were down right snooty and rude. My 22 year old daughter forgot her purse and failed to take an ID with her. So she ordered a merlot and they did not serve her. We were ok with it because we understand their liability if she were under 21. We did not argue one bit. More like I put it back on her for not bringing ID. But then the rumblings and the comments from the bartenders and staff started. Loudly they proclaimed that ""that group is trying to get alcohol for kids!"" First we had a family of 6. 2 of which were under 21 and did not attempt nor wish to purchase alcohol. But it continued throughout the night. And at midnight we were not given champagne like all patrons. We were all given cider. I am well beyond 21 as were 3 others in our party. 3 of which had ID with them. The food was ok. Some good some not. Salad was weird. Lobster undercooked. The scallops were delicious. But again it was $150 for full meal and dancing on New Year's Eve so it was appropriately priced for what we had.  Still the treatment was so humiliating and continuous that we were not enjoying ourselves. Then the music came.DJ was fantastic and had the crowd dancing nonstop. Until 1:15 am... Yes I say this sarcastically. We were all again made aware that we needed to leave and end the party while it was at its most fun. Lights on. Shoving check in my face. And frustrated waitstaff that let everyone know they wanted to leave. Ok so maybe don't have a New Year's Eve party! So would I do it again? No. Did I have fun? Yes. Would I go back to Almond? No. Sorry but I do enjoy food and I'm sure theirs is good on a regular basis, but I can get good food with much better service and not be treated poorly at many many other locations in New York.",0,0,0,E M.,"Montebello, CA",0,72,26

I ""sampled"" my wife's fries which were sufficiently crispy.there's a lot of great options on the menu, with something for everyone. kudos to having a brunch menu that has a plethora of options beyond the standards.a great bar menu and fair pricing tops it all off. the rustic decor is kinda funky, but the place is large and you don't really notice it that much.",5,2,4,Mike B.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",187,1514,175

4.0,12/13/2015,"I wanted to try this place for brunch for over a year now, so I am glad I finally made it! Next time I want to try their dinner and seafood selection. SETTING: Spacious venue with a romantic feel. Although I thought it was a little weird having dimmed lights for brunch, for the holiday season, it was complemented well with the Christmas spirit. They placed lights around the room, wreath along the walls and ornaments hanging from the ceiling. The restaurant was a bit loud so don't expect a peaceful brunch. I did admire the Christmas music that made the experience calm and relaxing.FOOD:1) Biscuits: (Complementary)-Bite size, SO CUTE! -Although they were bite side, they were still fluffy on the inside with a crispy crunch on the outside and best of all, they were warm.-It came with a creamy butter that was very light and an apple sauce like spread to die for.2) Almond hash:-Duck confit, hash with poached eggs, you can't go wrong! Surprisingly it had quite a bit of duck in it!-After seeing the pictures, I was a little nervous because I thought it was a small meal, by was I wrong. It was huge! I could only each half of it especially after asking for seconds on the delicious biscuits.-The down fall was that the duck was a little over cooked, it was a little dry. I think it had a lot to do with the fact that it was shredded rather than actual pieces. Also, the hash was a little bland, but the flavor of the duck helped give it flavor. I suggest added a little of the green sauce they have on the table to give it a little spicy kick and flavor.  3) Chorizo omelette:-This dish was a little smaller than expected. For an omelette, I was expecting something massive that at least took up half of the plate. -The flavor was smoky, which I thought was an interesting taste and the eggs were pretty thick.SERVICE:-VERY SLOW......-We waited a long time just to get out order taken and about 20 min after we asked for togo boxes to actually get out bill. -I did notice that our waiter seemed possibly sick? or not energized, possibly overwhelmed?, but if it was because she was sick then I understand....hopefully I will have a better experience next time...",2,0,1,Kristina L.,"New York, NY",1009,520,1384

It came in a hot dish it must've been cooked in and on the top it was crispy cheese. So delicious! My one friend had the special of the night, which was shrimp scampi and then my other friend and I had the flatiron steak. It was excellent and I loved the way the steak was cooked. I forgot which sauce I ordered, but I ordered it on the side and didn't even end up using it. Instead of the fries they were able to substitute a little side salad, which was pretty good as well. I noticed the table over from us had the side of brussel sprouts they looked so good. I'll have to get them next time. The restaurant was really cute and loved the lighting/ambiance. The one thing is that the restaurant must've been at least 100 degrees. My friends and I were so uncomfortable the entire meal. It was so hot that it was difficult to enjoy our food.

2.0,7/29/2015,"Myself and my 2 coworkers went to Almond for a business lunch. We were promptly seated and the hostess/manager was very friendly in helping us find an outlet for our laptops. We then were greeted by the waiter, who was pleasant. We choose items from the Prix Fixe menu. We got our salads and drinks fairly quickly but the main course literally took AN HOUR. Not only did it take an hour, but my salmon and my coworker's lamb burger were undercooked (mine was somewhat edible but hers was bloody!) and my salmon was cold and not tasty. This is absolutely unacceptable and I'm sure what happened is the waiter forgot to put in our order. We didn't get any kind of apology/acknowledgement that it took a while for our food to come out either. For a Tuesday afternoon at 2:30pm when there are very few people in the restaurant and we ordered off of the prix fixe menu which should in theory be streamlined and come out quickly, this is very difficult for me to overlook. It was very kind of them to allow us to stay in the restaurant for a couple of hours after eating to work, however the experience around the food was not great.

3.0,7/19/2015,"There were 10 of us for brunch on this particularly hot day in the middle of July. The hostess seated us quickly and before the full lot of us had arrived. The mix of people, music, and atmosphere at this restaurant is interesting at best, and somewhat boring at worst. From screaming kids, to young professionals, and families, this restaurant hardly screams exclusivity.With all that said, the food was good, not amazing or earth shattering, but good. It's expensive for what it is, a comfortable place to have brunch. Their menu is at least extensive. I had a good to great plate of heav. Rancheros, and I sampled my the duck confit (good but dry), the pastrami and eggs (the pastrami was good), and the macaroni and cheese (excellent truffle flavor).The serving sizes were standard for this type of fare, meaning it's hardly large or hearty.

We made a reservation and even though the place was fairly empty at 8:30 at night, we were given a mediocre table right by the waiters stand (not that this helped us with our service).  We ordered two glasses of wine, and when they brought the wine, they had messed up my glass of red and when I noted this, they were angry with me and made me feel like I should take what was brought (I didn't). During our meal, they turned up the music.  Everyone in the restaurant at the time looked up and grimaced. Even the servers! We could barely communicate! Having not been there before, I asked them about their menu and what was their speciality.  The guy really had nothing to say.  So when I asked about their french fries (which appeared per the menu to be a ""specialty"" he glossed over them and I barely understood more than what the menu told me, which was nothing).  We finally ordered and while the salad we ordered came out quickly, we ended up waiting over 45 minutes for our meal.  In fact, a waitress, who was not our waitress came over and said, ""you guys look hungry..."" so we asked her to check on our food and she agreed to do so.  When the food finally did come, it was mediocre.  For a streak that was cooked medium rare, I was surprised by how burned the outside was.  I ended up not eating much of it and the french friends that came with it were the bottom of the barrel of fries (all end pieces).  When asked how our dinner was (finally), and I replied with fine, the waiter just looked at me and then walked away.  I'm truly surprised this place is in business.",0,0,0,Shelly K.,"Boulder, CO",0,24,0

4.0,5/27/2015,"I was here this past Sunday for an early birthday brunch for my dad. There were four of us all together, him, my brother, my husband and me. We were seated next to a table of chatty Cathy's and the contrast was tremendous. At 11:30am it would have been blissfully quiet for a Sunday (thank you Memorial Day weekend) but the girls next to us kept screaming with laughter and speaking at the tops of their breathless lungs. Meanwhile, I was desperately trying to keep conversations going at my table by shouting but my dad, brother and husband were all so quiet and awkward that you would have thought I'd put them all in time-out.ANYWAY. aside from that weirdness, the brunch was fantastic. Spacious and open, many tables, and a room filled with light from the open French doors, the lovely overhead lamps and the framed mirrors on the walls. The service was cordial, if a bit on the cool side - I'm guessing that our waitress was neither pleased to be working on Memorial Day weekend nor thrilled by the cacophony at the next table. As far as beverages we all stuck to coffee (on our best behavior in front of Dad), and it was really good coffee! The menu was great, I was really torn between some awesome-sounding asparagus and eggs dish that's not on their website and the eggs florentine. Ultimately the latter won out because I just really really like Hollandaise sauce. I ended up very pleased with my choice because the sauce was great (so few places do it well), the eggs were perfectly poached, and the spinach was perfectly seasoned. I mean perfect, I didn't need to add any salt at all, which is rare for me.My dieting dad was pleased with his braised kale omelette. my brother loved the mac and cheese but it was too much for him to finish, and my other half was mostly pleased with his food except that he felt the yolks were too runny. But he likes his yolks solid, which I consider blasphemy, so I'm not taking his criticism seriously.Unfortunately the Yelp check-in deal of ""Chef's snack"" or ""sweet treat"" was not available with brunch, but I want to come back anyway.

Every time he walked away, we feared he wouldn't come back.The appetizers were pretty and just large enough to share. The smoked bluefish was salty with a barrage of textures, tasty. Cheese Fries Quebecoise was a messy slew of French fries, addicting and briny, but not amazing.And then we waited. Our glasses emptied and we waited. Finally, after 40 minutes our gorgeous entrees arrived. The almost tender short rib was accompanied by too few gnocchi and a bed of greens. Eight ravioli filled with grainy fava beans and mealy cheese were drenched with an unpleasant discordant mint sauce. Thursday's shrimp scampi special was colorful, refreshing and mildly satiating. The delicate crab and uni butter pasta was lacking all flavor except the occasional prick of chili flakes and the crunch of white flowers.Despite the stunning presentation of each dish, the luxury of the ingredients and the over zealous use of edible flowers, the food was a let down.

OK, they were busy, so maybe that explains the temperature of the meal, but the eggs around the skimpy stuffing were obviously not fresh or real.

3.0,3/4/2015,"We had Valentine's Day here and while our waiter was a delight and the food was pretty good, I have to say, our interaction with the hostess Jessie ensured none of us will ever return to Almond. She was curt, rude and completely non-responsive when we asked to be moved tables (we were the *first* party to be seated and they put us at a small 4-top in the middle of the room, next to the waiter's water station). We had made the reservation in January. This woman literally pretended that she didn't hear us and walked away and then avoided eye contact for the entire dinner whenever she would walk past us--AWKWARD! Of course, booths and quieter tables in quieter corners of the room remained unfilled even after we left. I would have asked to speak with the manager, but our friends felt embarrassed how they were treated, so I promised to drop it.

We made reservations and thank god we did the place was packed!  We ordered a couple of cocktails to enjoy with our meals. One of which was the Spiced Cranberry Sangria which was not very good in my opinion, it was overly spiced, not sweet at all and you couldn't even taste the cranberry. After taking a drink the waiter noticed my wince and asked if everything was ok, after telling him i didnt care for the drink he offered to change it for another one free of charge which was very very nice of him. On to the food.When we were seated at our table we were brought complementary mini biscuits, butter and an apple spread which was very yummy. I could not stop eating them. for the main course we shared an order of the Almond Hash, Croque Madame and a side of the house cured bacon.The Almond Hash was my favorite! It eggs were perfect and there was a very generous amount of duck in the Hash. The dish was pretty rich so im glade we decided to split it, i do not know if i would have been able to finish the whole thing by myself. The Croque Madame was very delicious and my SO loved it the presentation was especially beautiful! The portion was also perfect.The side of bacon was the only odd dish of the day... My SO and I both tasted it and agreed that the bacon, didnt taste like bacon but more like friend chicken fingers. Dont get me wrong im a fan of chicken fingers as much as the next guy but i wanted my bacon to taste like bacon. Aside from that the bacon was cooked well done, not charred but not fatty either.

3.0,1/2/2015,"So I took a group of friends here for NYE dinner and can't honestly say that I enjoyed the experience. I picked it because my old firm threw a small party here a few years ago and I remember the food being quite delicious and the venue being spacious. Well the space hasn't changed, but the food sure as hell has. The 11 of us ordered an assortment of dishes, ranging from the the lamb to cavatelli, and steak and char. Everything looked pretty average, but let me just touch on the dishes that I sampled/consumed. My lamb was absolutely disgusting. In all 25 years of my life, this was hands down the worst lamb I have ever had. I didn't even know you could do lamb this wrong. It was dry, tasteless, tough, and slightly cold. I honestly was at a loss of words when the waiter came by to check on my food and how we were doing. Everyone else had managed to consume most if not all of their food except me. ME. I'm the dude who usually wraps up first and then some. I can honestly count on my two hands how many times I've left leftovers on my dish at a restaurant. In this instance, about 2/3 of the lamb was still left. The waiter was definitely concerned so he brought it back and after the chef did confirm that it was awful, decided to wipe it off our bill. This was great. You did good, waiter-with-the-dapper-haircut. You did good. That said, everything else was pretty awful too. The cavatelli was clumpy. Clumpy. And it tasted just as awful as it looked. The mac n cheese, which I had specifically ordered as a side precisely because it tasted so good 3 years ago, also fell flat. The best part of this meal was the group that I was with and the fact that we were able to order two nice bottles of champagne at the end.

Nine of the ten dishes were brought out and we sat staring at our meals for another ten minutes before the final dish was brought out.

5.0,12/13/2014,"Such a change from my last review huh? I'm very thankful that i got yo try almond for dinner. The service was friendly and thoughtful, i appreciated the kindness of staff along with their ability to squeeze in a reservation for me on a Saturday night. My water was filled, my food was great and nothing was rushed.I started out at the bar with their rye and flower cocktail. It's slightly sweet but not overly, you get some if the rye, a touch of lemon and wash of honey. It's well balanced and really a pretty drink.  My friend had a beer (not much else you can say about a beer). We then had a half dozen oysters to share. I believe that if an oyster is fresh and clean, there is no need for condiments. So thankful, i didn't need to use them. However, they put in the cutest little Tabasco sauce bottle! (Yes, i took a picture of it).When we headed to dinner, we received a complimentary crostini. I forgot what kind it was, but my guess is hummus since i tasted tahini. For appetizers we ordered the roasted while cauliflower (my friend's choice) and the shortrib. Both had amazing flavors. The tangy sweet balsamic reduction I the cauliflower was surprisingly good, although the cauliflower was a touch soft. The shortrib app's gnocchi was fluffy and melt in your mouth! I wish they threw in a few more. Again great seasoning and sauce, but the short rib itself was a bit dry. Both appetizers had fantastic elements to them. For entree, i ordered the Saturday special, which is the bouillabaise (sp might be off). This dish really sealed the 5 star. It is very hard to not overcook seafood. Especially seafood sitting in broth. The cod, mussels, shrimp, clams, and scallops were perfectly cooked. The broth was flavorful and even the herbed bread had a beautiful char. I swear I'm not brown nosing. My friends had the hanger steak with fries, which i didn't try but it was cooked perfectly based on appearance.For dessert we had the date cake with ice cream. This was amazing. The vanilla ice cream was not overly sweet, but very creamy. It's a smallscoop so it's really just enough to complement the cake. The cake alone was moist, slightly crumbly and not too sweet. It had walnuts i believe, bits of date and a nice brown sugar flavor. I'm glad i had dinner here and i appreciate the service and execution. Thanks!",2,0,1,Doris C.,"New York, NY",149,263,1355

Definitely fills up, so make sure to get your reservation on. Started with the short ribs, which were TO DIE FOR. Like fall of the bones, moan to the point you make people around you uncomfortable good. Also got the flatbread, which had hummus, garlic, broccoli, and pecorino - not as good as I though...too earthy. For my main course I opted for the butternut squash ravioli in a savory sauce, which was also moan-worthy. Prices were really up there - $28 for 5 ravioli is a little nuts to me - but since I didn't pay for it, I'm not taking points off for that one. If I were to go back with my own paltry dinner budget, I'd double down on the wine (reasonable per bottle price), and get a helping of short ribs and mac and cheese, and be the happiest girl with clogged arteries in that joint.

4.0,10/21/2014,My co-worker took me and my girlfriend here for a our birthday lunch. What a great Choice! I absolutely loved it. We arrived around noon for lunch and the place was not packed which was great. We were sitted right away and waiter came right away as well. Waiter was very nice and told us about the menu and recommended a Pumpkin Beer which was delicious. For Appetizer we order the shrimp cocktail and the mac and cheese. Delicious!!!! Set the bar up for me and excited for the entree. I chose the Roast chicken which I loved. This came with potatoes and spinach and the combination was just perfect with the chicken. I was very impressed with the resturant and the service. My co-worker mentioned that it is very cool to go for dinner and when you go towards the back you can even enjoy the Billards.

3.0,8/10/2014,"Almond, a French/American bistro, is a really good spot for brunch.  I'm a big fan of cheese and the Croque Monsieur delivered.   It's essentially a fancy French name for a baked ham and gruyere cheese sandwich that is smothered with a delicious cheese sauce.  It has all the qualities I like - a toasted, cheesy, buttery sandwich.  However, the $17 price tag for a ham and cheese sandwich is a bit pretentious.  For that price, the cheese and ham better be artisanal, organic, and from grass feed, free range animals. Almond gets bonus point for being kid friendly and offering baby food on the menu.  First time I've seen that.  Their complimentary bread basket included these bite size buttery biscuits.  My toddler gobbled these up. The baby food options included pureed banana mixed with yogurt or scrambled eggs with bits of bacon. Both $3.  Even though my toddler only had a bite or two of the eggs, it was actually a nice side to my sandwich.   Also what's great is that the restaurant is loud, so the sound of crying babies is drowned out.  The service was standard and because the restaurant is fairly large they had availability for walk-ins, on a busy Sunday.",2,1,1,Marilen R.,"Nutley, NJ",307,342,297
3.0,8/9/2014,"I came here a few months ago with several friends and had a delicious meal from the lunch menu.  My husband and I ate here on a date day for brunch, and my experience this time did not equal that of my first time.  I guess nothing ever compares to the first.I had the caramelized onion and bone marrow sandwich, thinking that I would get....drum roll please.....caramelized onion and bone marrow.  But this ""a l'Oignon"" was two enormous pieces of bread with a thick, thick slab of ham and melted cheese.  I thought there was a mistake, so I asked the waitress about my dish, and she gave me that ""Isn't it obvious?"" look and fliply said, ""It's spread on top of the bread.""  Yes, I saw that there was a substance with a buttery consistency spread on top of the bread but seriously?  If the menu highlights the ""bone marrow"" as the dish, should it not be the star of the show?  And with NO mention of the fact that this was a glorified ham and cheese sandwich?  Lord Almighty.  Let's give this chef a reality check here.  If you wanted to charge me 17 bucks for a friggin ham and cheese sandwich, at least inform me that I am paying for a ham and cheese sandwich.  But all in all, since I do like a ham and cheese sandwich and since I did not have breakfast earlier, I ate it, figuring, ""Ok, buyer beware.""  My hubby ate the Antony's Grandma's Oaxacan Tamales, and HIS dish was what it said it would be.  There was a beautiful poached egg with hollandaise sauce, and the dish was pretty with red and green. He was a happier camper.  So all in all, Almond.  It's fine.  I will return to Almond because the food is well-made with great ingredients, but I have learned my lesson.  My next waitress will undergo the Spanish Inquisition before I make my menu choices.  And for any of you who loves a good bone marrow, do not choose the ""a l-Oignon"", because you will not get your precious bone marrow from this dish.",1,0,0,Alice P.,"Staten Island, NY",14,39,1

4.0,7/3/2014,"This place is FANTASTIC. Seriously, I loved everything about it.  For some reason, this reminds me a bit of The Smith- just to give you an idea of what it's like ambiance-wise.  PROS:1. GREAT and really unique cocktails (I had pomegranate & ginger- so good)2. The space is big and the perfect mix of modern, laid-back, yet semi-upscale3. They play great music- most is really fun (like anything from 90's to Earth, Wind, & Fire)4. They have round tables- this place is perfect for a birthday dinner!5. Food comes really quickly- servers don't hover to take it away and let you take your time6. The food is just plain good- try their cheese fries. You won't regret it. CONS:1. It's just a little expensive- you can do a dinner for under $20 if you order the right things, but just plan accordingly otherwise! 2. It may have been a little understaffed, but it's a holiday weekend, so I'll give them that.I highly recommend this place!",4,0,1,Elise G.,"Austin, TX",78,96,61

We left then after walking around decided to call and just see if maybe there was a table there. Hostess said a guest hadn't arrived and they only had 2 mins left so if we came back now, probably could get a table. Ran back, only to discover the guests had been at the bar the whole time and apparently the hostess knew about it... very strange. Anyways then was quoted another 20-25 min wait time... ending up waiting an additional 45 mins for a table, an hour in all. Was really disappointed and just totally killed our mood for the whole evening. If there's no table, just say so!  Expressed our concerns politely to the manager who didn't really seemed concerned about rectifying the situation.

2.0,5/17/2014,"We had some friends come to town for a conference that they were attending near Union Square, and the Edible Institute had suggested Almond as a restaurant that conference attendees should check out. We made the mistake of taking the Edible Institute's recommendation, instead of doing our own research. This place is mediocre and overpriced (appetizers are ~$10-$20; entrees are ~$25-$40).As a foursome, we ordered:- The wedge salad- The thick-cut bacon appetizer- The marinated octopus- The duck entree- The pork milanese- A side of brussel sprouts- The chocolate pot de creme for dessertTaking them one at a time: the wedge salad was just some iceberg lettuce with a too-thick cream sauce. I still can't believe that thick-cut bacon could be so tasteless and bland. The marinated octopus was by far the best dish that we ordered. The duck entree was totally mediocre--neither well-cooked nor particularly well-flavored. The brussel sprouts were roasted with bacon and (I think) honey, so it would have been hard to mess them up too badly. The chocolate in the dessert was pretty good, but the cream on top was disgusting.Do yourself a favor and DON'T go here. I live in Park Slope and, at the risk of sounding like a self-righteous Brooklynite, this is the kind of pretentiously-fancy, ridiculously-overpriced crap that makes it hard to venture to Manhattan for a sit-down dinner.

The service was great and the waitress was very attentive. We ordered the following: - Marinated Octopus- Steamed Artichoke with three sauces- Flatiron steak with mashed potatoes (instead of fries-trying to be healthy!)- Mac and Cheese with Prosciutto and truffle- S'mores Sundae The octopus was so flavorful and went really well with the toast that it came with. I never get to eat artichoke so it was really enjoyable to dip in the different sauces. These two apps were a perfect light start to our meal since we were about to indulge in pasta and steak! We also sampled some lox over toast and I have to say- the lox was not salty at all which was amazing! I feel that often lox is too salty. Steak was tasty and I enjoyed the bordelaise sauce. The mac and cheese was rich and delicious. The s'mores sundae was the cherry on top. I believe it came with a marshmallow ice cream which was unique and delish.

4.0,5/3/2014,"This review is specific to appetizers and salads since my boyfriend and I kept things on the lighter side for dinner (happens once in a blue moon!). We started off with the artichoke appetizer and it was awesome!  Fun to eat! It comes with 3 sauces, two of which were perfect but I wasn't into the salsa verde-didn't mesh well with artichoke. For the 'main course' I had the egg and asparagus salad and I enjoyed it. It's not a typical salad with a bed of lettuce, but the server gave me a heads up. It was slightly saucy but overall liked the crunch of asparagus paired with the soft shiitake and fried egg. I'd order it again! My boyfriend got the wedge salad which he liked but thought the 5 small slivers of sopresseta were an odd addition (not value add). We shared the Brussel sprouts for a side. Not the best I've had, pretty average, but it is a big serving for a side dish!I'm looking forward to coming back here for the seafood (their speciality)!

We also split a mac and cheese as a table--it had nice taste, but the pasta a bit too overcooked and could have used a bit more prosciutto.The ambiance was nice, but the service was a bit lacking (although friendly), perhaps due to the business of the whole place.

3.0,4/8/2014,"Very beautiful, spacious location with such a friendly staff. This is a place to impress and we indeed enjoyed the laid back atmosphere... But then we noticed that it was probably a bit too laid back.The place includes a bollards table at the very back of the restaurant across the room from the main bar. So if you came for a drink and a game with pals in a posh place... you will have to walk between people eating at tables to get a drink at the bar.The music is low, the lighting is perfect. This place has so much going for it. They offer a great place to enjoy an amazing dinner. Their menu is not huge but offers some variety. One burger plate, two steak plates, some pasta and vegetables and even pork belly. The prices are on the higher end, between $24-$40. The drinks were also pretty expensive ($13 per margarita is not that bad) but then with tip (if you tip like me, you'll end up paying $15 per drink). The cocktails served here are also unique. We tried a few of those... But again though the price was good, it probably was not worth the value. We were 5 people and our bill was very close to $300 (without tip).So yeah, while I was very impressed, I probably would not come back and here is why...1. I had a reservation for 7:45pm, and it turns out that we waited for about 30-40 min for our dinner to reach our table. The first round of drinks we ordered took well over 20 minutes to arrive to the table, so when we ordered our second round I asked (in the most polite way with a smile) if they could try to make sure we get them with our food considering the first round took so long. The answer was they were understaffed, though the restaurant was clearly not overbooked, possibly 10 tables total had costumers.2. The food was amazing... For the most part, the Mac and cheese was not amazing. The pasta is a pretty small portion, the pork belly was squishy and looked sort of grey-brown instead if the expected red crispy style. The flavor was good, but most of the pork belly I got was fat... like most all of it. I was looking forward to the top crunchy skin and there was none, it was a mushy mess of flabby pork skin that I was just not willing to chew on. The side was very tasty and tasted like apples. The best plate we all had, funny enough was the brussel sprouts. They we'd super delicious and I want to eat those again as a main course next time! 3. They were so slow to serve us. Sadly, as mentioned, had it not been for such a great group I was there with, I would have rated this place far less. While my reservation was for 7:45pm we finally paid our check at around 10:30pm. This is definitely not because we wanted to. The wait for food was huge and the wait for a server to come pick up empty plates and bring the check also was pretty big. Again, no one likes servers that come to your table every 3 minutes, but every half hour also tips the scale to the wrong side.4. If you will serve a hamburger at your restaurant, make it amazing. nothing special for this $24 burger. You could at least use a different type of bread, something that looks like it is not something you can easily cook from home.Besides the things mentioned above, this is definitely a first date type spot.

3.0,3/23/2014,"I visited this restaurant with a big group for dinner, after making a reservation, which was very easy to do.  Maybe that should have tipped me off.  The restaurant was a wide open space with a cool bistro feel.  We ordered cocktails and then starters which both took some time to come.  The starters were the best part of the meal though, as we had ordered the Mussels, Brussel Sprouts, and Braised Short Ribs. All of which were good, I wish the rest of the meal had followed suit. The wait for our entrees was staggering, at almost an hour between the two courses.  The waiter was nice and profusely apologizing, but I would have preferred an ETA rather than another apology or maybe a Comped drink, since we kept ordering them.  Even though the drinks were taking longer than usual to arrive as well.  Once our main dishes had arrived, we all ate hungrily, glad to see food again.  While the dishes were fine, they surely didn't make up for the wait and left a lot to be desired.  Unlike with the starters, our plates weren't licked clean.  We arranged to have one of the desserts sent to the table for my friend's birthday.  But we were a little shocked when the waiter admonished us for not having started to sing.  I guess we were tired by that point and were used to someone starting the sing-a-long.  The dessert also did not arrive with a spoon, so we had to wait for the server to bring one.  At that point he came back and almost begrudgingly recited the dessert menu by memory, before saying ""would you like to see a dessert menu?"". I thought it was customary to bring the dessert menu and then ask what the guests wanted.  We didn't order dessert and I think we were glad to be out of there.  It was quite warm for the weather outside and the restaurant frankly left a bad taste in our mouths.

Tables around us were being seated, served cleaned and reseated super quickly. Super attentive and helpful staff. We ordered the duck confit hash w/ poached eggs, the brioche French toast, and a side of pastrami. Nothing we ate disappointed. The decor is beautiful.

4.0,3/17/2014,"I'd like to start by saying that the decor of this place is fantastic: The distressed wood panels, large windows and spacious dining area area a great environment for large groups and kids, but there are also plenty of small tables for a cozy meal. As a vegetarian, I probably wouldn't come back here again for brunch. There aren't a ton of veggie-friendly brunch options, unless you go a-la-carte, in which case there is nothing special about the food. I had the brioche french toast which was pretty fantastic if that's your type of thing. From what I saw (for the brunch menu), the rest of the meal options weren't the MOST inventive, but everyone enjoyed their meal and their time at Almond, so it was definitely worth a try. Big plus: This place takes reservations and is in a really accessible location, which, again, makes it a gem for larger parties. And they bring you these DELICIOUS biscuits with butter and apple butter (amazing!) before your meal, so get ready go carb-crazy!",0,0,2,Foram M.,"San Francisco, CA",234,32,30
5.0,3/16/2014,"Solid weekend brunch place. Rarely do you get a place that has good atmosphere, food, wait-staff AND very little wait. Despite how packed this place gets, people come in and out pretty quickly and you can make a reservation beforehand. I called Friday night right before closing and was able to get a reservation for 7 people for Saturday. First off the biscuits. They are tiny cute flaky little things. Comes with both butter and jam. It's really hard not to eat the whole basket by yourself because they're so small.If you come here, please get the Almond hash w/ duck confit and poached eggs. The hash was crispy and potato-y but the duck really shined through. Eggs were perfectly poached with runny yolks. It also comes with 2 buttered crostinis. The whole dish is savory, butter, and just delicious.Usually I don't care too much about how good the service is, but this time I do have to comment the staff at Almond know how to provide a good experience without taking it over the top like at $$$$ restaurants. Even though the place was packed, the waiters and greeters at the door seemed they actually cared whether or not you are enjoying the experience. When I informed one of the staff the bathrooms were out of soap, she immediately apologized and went to refill them. The waiter was also very happy to give us more biscuits when we asked and even doubled the amount because we had to wait for them to come out of the oven.The overall atmosphere is very cool. Rustic and homey yet elegant. It gave off a very clean and comfortable feeling. Looking forward to coming back.",5,5,6,Jocelyn K.,"Jersey City, NJ",479,885,4955

4.0,3/13/2014,"This is my 2nd time at Almond. First for dinner and now for brunch. This review is for both times. This is a solid establishment from service to food. The food is not overly inventive but it is executed well and good. In the first visit, it was for my friend's birthday and the service was excellent! The waitress was friendly, attentive but not overbearing...which is just right the right balance.  We had a good girl celebration---appetizer--Shared Steam Mussels (fresh and yummy!) Entree: I ordered roast chicken and my friend had the lamb shank. Both dish was good. I especially enjoy the chicken which was moist and done well. Sorbets for dessert! Yummy, good time!The 2nd time, I went with friends for brunch. Group of 6 and you can make reservations! Awesome! My friend and I arrived first and was seated without the entire party! Great! It was already a good start. One of my friend was half an hour late, no problem and no pressure to order. It was again another good time spend with friends. There was a good selection for brunch especially with one of the requirement was to find a  restaurant with salad choices! Brunch was again solid! I ordered the Almond hash which is done with duck confit. It was good. So, if you are in this neighborhood and want to find a good place to spend time with your friends, a place that offers good food options, accepts reservations (even for brunch!- say goodbye to waiting 30-40 mins) then this is a place for you to try!",1,0,0,Su C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,7

Last time we went we ordered a dessert that we didn't think was great so we left it there and continued talking. The manager came over and asked if we liked the dessert, we told him we didn't like it and he said he would make us something new (we were already stuffed).

The homemade mini scones were delicious too, I could not stop eating them!  Even though I had to constantly wave down the waiter for more coffee, water and bread (which never came), I would give Almond another try.  They take brunch reservations, so that is a big plus.",1,0,0,Alexia G.,"New York, NY",85,68,12

5.0,3/1/2014,"I visited Almond recently and had a wonderful experience, well above expectations.  The food, service, and ambience were all first rate, and I would rather revisit this restaurant then many better known options (Balthazar, Pastis, etc).Almond has a welcoming, unique, fun, atmosphere - mix of Parisian bistro and country kitchen.  Large space and plenty of room between tables (a rarity in NY)Regarding the food:- Brussels Sprout Salad:  an unconventional interpretation on Caesar Salad which was great.  Combines shredded and roast Brussels sprouts. - Rosemary Flat bread:  we enjoyed.  Tasty rosemary bread which is thicker than typical flat bread.  Had bit of a kick from red pepper flakes.- Dourade.  Perfectly cooked, and crispy.  A but on small side so not overly filling- Arctic Char.  Delicious.  Complex and interesting combination of flavors (miso butter plus roasted shishoto peppers and mushrooms)- Mac & Cheese.  More of a creamy penne au gratin.  Fantastic.  Wish a bit more given- Smores dessert.  Luxurious blend of flavors with crunchy graham cracker element.  Highly recommendService was great and front of the house quite pleasant as well - at the door, they also gave out chocolate covered almonds.",2,0,3,Bill C.,"New York, NY",0,57,8
3.0,2/28/2014,"The Winter Salad was kind of terrible. There was no pancetta, ricotta, or pear to be found. It was just a hot, sour bowl of broccoli rabe -- the pieces of which were too large to eat in a single bite and difficult to cut with a standard butter knife. As a side, it would have been a 4 out of 10. As a salad, I give it a 1. Other stuff there was pretty good, and the waiter seemed unsurprised when I told him that the salad was disappointing (he took it off the bill). In that respect, I appreciate the service, but they should remove that item from the menu. I really can't imagine anyone ordering it and being happy.",0,0,0,Alex G.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,12,0

3.0,2/27/2014,"Flatiron is definitely not a neighborhood that is lacking in quality restaurants. Almond stands out because it has been a pillar in the area and remains a quality food spot for quality fruits de mer (e.g. - Almond Plateau Royale) and meat entrees (pork belly). The service is exceptional, and the waitstaff are always great to have a conversation with (not at the expense of attentiveness to other parties, of course).  The intimate ambiance is ideal for dates, and the bar itself offers tremendous sex appeal.

1.0,2/18/2014,"Repeatedly being accused of stealing ruined an already mediocre dinner:On Sunday evening I went to dinner with my boyfriend, his good friend and his friend's fiancé. The men split the bill and received separate checks. My boyfriend signed his check and then it was promptly removed with the pen. We then requested another pen because his friend still needed to sign his check. As we finished our wine an employee approached us asking for his pen back. We were told we were given a Mont Blanc pen with a diamond to sign the check and that they needed it back. We don't remember getting a fancy pen but if we did we would have returned it if we had it in our possession. We told them that we were sorry but our pens had been taken away with our bills and they should ask the servers. As we exited we were approached again about the missing pen. Again, we apologized that it was lost but we reminded them that we did not have it and that they should check with their staff.The next afternoon my boyfriend gets a voice mail from the owner saying that one of us ""has the pen."" He did not say that we may have the pen or he wants to find the pen. He told us we have it and they need it back. I assumed this was a slip of the tongue. When my boyfriend called back and conferenced in his friend the owner was relentless in accusing us of stealing this pen. He said that the pen was sentimental and could not be replaced and that he has camera footage showing that ""the pen went to the table and never left""...as if you could identify a specific pen on a security camera. Also, who gives out a pen like that!? The boys reiterated that they would love to help but they did not take the pen. The owner then said that one of the girls must have taken it then. Now I know that wealthy people can steal too but, why would a table of investment bankers steal a pen from a restaurant worker who was viably distraught about losing this sentimental item? They can buy as many as they want and still pay for a $400 mediocre dinner at Almond.Being accused relentlessly of this heartless act was rude and insulting. While I respect the owner for sticking up for his employees I found his treatment of us to be rude and out of line. Asking us if we have the pen is one thing but once we denied having the pen for the third time you would think he would have gotten the picture and questioned his staff and searched the facility. I wouldn't be surprised if they find the pen in the restaurant and feel embarrassed by how they treated us.

However the service had a tendency to wander and there was a long stretch when no one really looked in our direction. And the food fell in the very average category- The chicken sausage plate was very bland and a huge disappointment. The croque with bone marrow sounded far more interesting than it was. The chorizo omelette was decent and the hash was good, though a touch one dimensional (you could really throw some greens on the side to balance out the plate).

My good 'ol hometown friend and I were looking for a place to settle into. We walked in and,  rightfully so, it was packed. She'd had some wine and I was very hungry. Not a great combination for waiting. Instead of making us hold up at the bar, the gracious combo of Delilah and one of the managers on duty allowed us to make ourselves most comfortable on the couch near the front. I really believe it was under special circumstances and just the right harmony of personalities was watching over the door that day. This includes the lightning quick and pleasant service from our server, Adam. If you're reading this and go in there expecting the couch you may get turned down at no fault to anyone.The treatment and care was top notch.

My friend who absolutely loves ketchup said he didn't even need it for the fries because the sauce was so good, which is saying a LOT.

I should have saved that drink for dessert.AMBIANCE: Casual and upbeat, with a neighborhood feel. The after-work crowd comes in business wear, but it would not be amiss if you decided to throw on jeans and a sweater.FOOD: Everything is good, but I really like the Brussels Sprout Salad, which is prepared two ways: whole and a la Caesar salad.BONUS: When you've finished with dinner, you can work off those calories with some pool.

It was all delicious. The steak was tender and cooked exactly as I specified and there were about a bazillion fries on my plate. It's not an inexpensive restaurant, so I will save it for a special occasion only, but I definitely intend to return.On this same day, I happened to mention to a different friend that I had dined at Almond, and I learned that this friend actually lives in an apartment in the same building as the restaurant! They then further confirmed that the restaurant makes an excellent brunch although dinner is rather expensive, they make their own bread on the premises and it always smells delicious, and at any given time it is possible to enter the bread room from my friend's apartment building because they don't often lock it and the door is ajar.

He all but ignored our table, brought our food late, forgot to bring us more bread after we asked for it, didn't refill our wine glasses. He was just all over the place. I also ordered the steak, which I cannot recommend. It was cooked medium, as requested, but the whole thing was just sort of stringy and weirdly textured with a bit of an odd taste. I'm hoping it was just an off night for them, because I will definitely be going back for the.",0,0,0,Emma T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,20,6

BEST DECISION EVER!The staff was nothing but kind, accommodating, and excited for us during the planning process and politely dealt with our annoying emails and surprise drop ins to the restaurant. They also invited us to come in for a tasting with their super star manager Lee where we handpicked items off the menu and created custom cocktails for the big day! After a year of planning the big day came and went without a hitch! Our guests loved the laid back, home-y vibe of the restaurant and were really impressed with the attentive staff who wound up on the dance floor with us by night's end. To this day we are still getting compliments on the rack of lamb hors d'oeuvres and the amazing hangover everyone had the morning after :)My husband and I love going to Almond now for brunch (it's all about the biscuits!), and dinner/drinks after work. The menu is always changing, but some of our favorite things to eat include the brussel sprout Cesar salad, ravioli, and flat-bread pizza which you can watch them make at the end of the bar! As far as drinks go, try the Truchard chardonnay, pumpkin ale, and spicy margarita! Seriously, can't say enough good things about this place! Just go, play a game of pool, and have a good time.

2.0,11/24/2013,I was drawn to this restaurant by a nice website with interesting menu options.  I was with 3 friends and we started off with the cauliflower appetizer that was recommended highly by our waitress. It basically tasted like it was dipped in balsamic vinegar.  We then had the bacon appetizer which is a bad copy of Peter Lugers famous side dish.  I had the pork chop as my main dish which was just ok with a side of butternut squash. The squash was ok at best. The rest of my party felt the same way about their experience. I should also mention that we were initially seated next to a family with babies when the majority of the restaurant was empty.

Good place to host clients and catch up with friends. Music was an interesting selection, a lot of new, younger songs. I definitely loved it, but would question if the crowd in their forties enjoyed hearing Flux Pavilion, Passion Pit, etc. Food was good -- shared the cauliflower appetizer which was delicious, unique mix of sauces and enjoyable to split. I had the pork chop while my date had the roasted chicken, both were savory and they were complemented well with a wide variety of greens. However, the menu is certainly pricey and would definitely expect to spend more than $60 a head. Drinks were strong and well-mixed -- tried a few cocktails and their wine selection looked extensive. Pricey as well, but nothing unexpected in Flatiron. The bartenders were friendly and efficient, the manager was behind the bar helping out as well and keeping guests entertained, kudos to good management. Service was great -- waitress tended to us frequently, had great suggestions and recommendations, and did not rush us out.

2.0,10/24/2013,"Despite the creative menu, and insistance on seasonal fare, Almond will disapoint anyone looking for a local, fresh dining experience.Nice enough dining area, lively and warm. Made reservations on a tuesday and were promptly seated. The cauliflower appetizer looked appealing, but came out drenched in sauce, not the way vegetables should be served. The bacon appetizer, also did not live up to expectations. Meat was dry, and had no crisp or char, just tasted like a bad peice of ham.For entrees, the duck and scallops dish and short rib were hits, but nothing extraordinary, while the skirt steak and cavatelli were extremely disapointing. The wine list is also nothing to boast about.Usually not one to complain about service at mid level restaurants, our waitress was an exception. She was unable to hear any of our orders (shouldn't be working in a loud restaurant) and when asked to make a cucumber hendricks martini her response was ""no"".

Although I would have loved to order their french toast, maybe next time. I had house made pastrami and eggs. It came with potatoes and toasted sourdough bread ( my fav!!). It was good, I just wished that the pastrami was a little bit more juicy. The whole plate just seemed dry. My cousin got the Almond Hash- duck confit with crispy duck skin. I only had one bite but OMG that was delish!!! I wished I had ordered that one instead. The crispy duck skin was heaven!!!. Make sure you order this!.Another great dish was their mac and cheese... Ooooozzzzing and creamy!!!! The penne was cooked al dente. We had ordered bacon on the side so you know I definitely mixed the two and it was perfection !!!!Other dished that were ordered were the tamales- I cant comment much cause I did not get to try this but my cousin said it was really good.

Short rib gnocchi- small portion but a very hearty dish. The creamy sauce was quite tasty, and although the short rib was a bit dry, when dipped in the sauce it was still quite delicious. Entree:Scallops and Duck Breast- the scallops were perfectly cooked and nice and dry. The smoked duck breast was so good, some said it almost tasted like ham. The squash purée with pomegranates was a strange combination, however they surprisingly complimented each other extremely well. Bronzino- a very light yet savory sauce with potatoes, onions, and the cutest little clams. The fish was cooked perfectly, but be careful of all of the bones! Dessert:Chocolate pot- A very light, creamy chocolate mousse incorporated with candied almonds and topped with creme fraiche is how I'd best describe this dish.

Duck confit, good. Potatoes, good. Eggs, good. Duck cracklins! GOOOOOD. Rich and warm; the perfect comfort food, and almost immorally decadent. (I saw a few reviews of this that noted there was one poached egg on top - they must have changed it because when I went there were two eggs, perfectly poached and enticingly runny. I was pleased.) However, as I inched closer to finishing the dish, I could begin to see the bottom of the plate... where the duck fat was literally, pooling.... which almost turned me off from completing my meal. ...almost.My companion ordered the home made chicken sausage, which came with two giant slabs of toast, eggs, and homefries. It was delicious. I know that because I ate like half of it. Usually I am against chicken or turkey or whatever in sausage (pork or go home) but this was perfectly spiced, nicely speckled with fat. One of the best chicken sausages I've ever tasted.The waiter brought us a butter biscuit basket (say that five times fast) as we were sipping our coffees and Bloody Marys. OMG. Everything everyone says about them is true. Flaky, buttery, warm, delicious goodness. Great for cancelling out any benefit of the spin class I'd just come from. The biscuits were served with little ramekins of warm butter and jam. We laughed because who would put more butter on buttery biscuits?? Apparently, the answer: us.We stayed at Almond sucking down coffee and Bloody Marys for almost two and a half hours. Our waiter was amazing because never once did he rush us to leave even though brunch service was clearly winding down.

5.0,7/26/2013,"First time having dinner here and I must say my husband and I were IMPRESSED! (he actually called it a 'hidden gem') Loved the atmosphere- not too stuffy, fun music playing, no tablecloths, but still a nice date night out. The place was much bigger than I expected, & had an additional back room with a pool table & tvs to watch sports. We first had a drink at the bar & then we were promptly seated in a cozy corner booth. Everything we ordered was DELICIOUS!! We relied heavily on our waiter's suggestions because everything looked so good on the menu. For apps we had the shorts ribs (to die for!) and charcuteries - i believe they were chicken liver pate and salmon. For entrees we had the roasted dourade & the hanger steak with blue cheese butter, and for dessert we had a blueberry cheesecake as well as 2 sorbets (blueberry & strawberry) & vanilla ice cream. I'm not even a huge fan of vanilla and I think it was the best I've ever had.

Definitely a fan and more than willing to come back.I came here for a Sunday brunch around 2 and there was no wait, however our waiter was a little slow ( I think he was new). Anyways getting down to every body's favorite part of the review, THE FOOD. VERY PLEASED.Biscuits- they gave us a basket of mini biscuits with butter and apricot preserve on the side. Very moist and amazingly fluffy.Almond Hash: I really enjoyed this one, the duck that was in the hash was very moist and flavorful. I hate it when my duck is dry, it just makes it less enjoyable. The poached eggs were literally perfectly poached; one bite and the yolk was oozing yummy goodness.Le Grand Mac and Cheese: Sooo good, but if you eat too much of it, you get that nauseated feeling. I love truffles including truffle oil and this dish you'll smell the truffle aroma right away but when you eat it, it's just the right amount of truffle to satisfy your taste buds. Oh and they use penne instead of elbows which is a plus for me.Turkey Burger: I've never been a fan of turkey burgers because the patty seemed to always be dry and taste like cardboard, but Almond's turkey burger completely changed my mind. It was both juicy and savory.Pastrami and Eggs: Not too much to say about this one. It's literally just pastrami slices on the side with some scrambled eggs and seasoned red potatoes and toast.I probably would've given this place 5 stars, however I wasn't too pleased when I 2 flies flying around my food.",0,0,0,Jeanne T.,"Brooklyn, NY",46,40,101

I love that the restaurant only serves dishes with foods bought locally and in season. And for this, I was sad that I did not get to sample the brussel sprouts.Some comments on the dishes my friends and I ordered:Starters:Short ribs - d'lish! I highly recommend this plate. I got it for my meal and the small portion was plenty big!  Very tender meat and the gnocchi are superb!Capresse salad: Just OK. Nothing to write home about - and a little overpriced.Flatbread: OK. It had mozz. cheese and potato on it - a little dry, but the flavors worked. Dinner:Lamb chop: Not bad.  It was slightly overcooked.Mac and Cheese: To die for!! The small order was split between two people - as a side and that was a smart choice. It is very rich in flavor and I think it would be tough to eat a large order on your own.Pork chop: Breaded and fried, but served with some greens. It probably would have been better if it wasn't fried and breaded.Mussels: Yummy, and get the small order - plenty for one person!Side of sauteed greens: Cooked nicely and very tasty. They were a little oily, but still full of flavor - which can be tough when you have mustard greens in there.Overall, it was a good experience and a great time with friends.

2.0,5/22/2013,"Almond was a bit of a disappointment as it was recommended to me by a friend for having the absolute best Mac & Cheese in NYC. With that said, I was salivating, with that thought in mind, and couldn't wait to check it out for myself and came here on a Tuesday night for dinner.Dimly lit with a rustic decor, Almond was spacious and had a fine dinning restaurant appeal. The service was definitely on queue as all the staff seems to know their role and was very attentive. However the food did not deliver as I would have hoped. Instead, their mac & cheese was too floury. So much so that I'm not sure if it was even cooked all the way through in their butter sauce before adding the cheese. Worst of all, the extra flour separated the cheese, which prevent it from oozing out of my fork while eating. As for using ziti pasta, it was a huge mistake. The ziti didn't help grasp the cheese while eating --seriously this is why it's call mac and not ziti & cheese. All in all, this dish was nothing but a failure. The only thing that helped to hold it's weight was the fancy ingredients that was used to create that dish, which was shaved truffle and prosciutto. Other then that, I wasn't impressed!We also ordered their roasted ""baked"" chicken and that was a mediocre dish!! Although the meat was tender and juicy, the skin was a bit rubbery (A HUGE NO NO). Instead, the skin should taste crispy, where it should capture all the flavors and essence of a chicken. Normally, I might make wave my hand lightly and say the restaurant was busy and their attention to details that night was compromised.  But since we checked in at 6:00pm for dinner and the restaurant was not crowded, I really couldn't help but to think that their food is pretty much the norm and it won't get any better.",4,0,1,Nga C.,"Brooklyn, NY",524,480,2034

The app portion is small but it makes you appreciate every juicy flavorful bite. The meat is so succulent and tender. I haven't had everything on the menu but I'm positive no dish comes close to this.I also tried their Friday Special; The rack of lamb. The portion size is generous and it is served on a bed of not-what-you-would-think mixed greens. This isn't a mix of romaine, spring greens, arugula, etc. It is a mix of chopped, diced, cooked greens - deliciously prepared and tender. I don't know what it was the green veg. mix was really good.

They couldn't do what I wanted on the steak, but that's ok - I understand the way it's made, so I took it as they served it. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't good either. I asked for it medium rare, and it was definitely more done than that, and as a result a little tough. The fries that it came with were decent. My friend - the huge fan of this place - also did not like her food this time around, so it's possible it was just a bad night. Also, her wine had serious sediment in the bottom - I like wine and know a fair amount about it, and I'm used to sediment from time to time. But this was SEDIMENT!

4.0,4/12/2013,"We decided to give Almond another try for dinner last night, and I'm really glad I did!Our server was incredibly friendly and had great suggestions. He was really attentive throughout the night. We started with the oysters and the lobster. The oysters (we got 3 each or west coast and east coast) were both really delicious! Highly recommend and actually enjoyed them more than the lobster.  We also got the beef short ribs to start. I really liked them--the short rib was hot, tender, and cooked really well.For our mains, I shared the striped bass and poussin (special of the day). The bass was good, but the poussin was phenomenal. The poussin (baby chicken for those of you who don't know) was slow cooked under a brick, which made the chicken incredibly soft and tender. The lentils and spinach that the dishes were prepared with were also fantastic and complemented the dish well. For sides, we chose the truffle mac and cheese and the brussel sprouts. The brussel sprouts were the highlight of the meal--the candied walnuts were amazing and the meat (to be honest, I am not even sure what it actually was) added the perfect diversity of texture and taste. These were the best brussel sprouts I've ever had in my life! For dessert, I tried the banana bread pudding with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.

After a brief 20 minute wait (which turned out to be exactly the amount of time my late friend needed to get there), we were seated and given menus, waters, and biscuits.Before even looking at the menu, my friend and I dived for the biscuits. They were were delicious! Warm, soft, and so good with the butter and jam. We demolished them in about 5 minutes and then proceeded to look at the menu. We both decided to order the Almond Hash and also got a refill on the biscuits. The hash was pretty good. I had a bite of the toasted bread that came with it, but decided against eating it since I had so many biscuits. The poached eggs were perfectly poached and I loved the potatoes! The duck also added a nice touch, though it could've been a bit crispier and flavorful. The portion was HUGE! About four bites in I already felt full (okay, this is probably the fault of the biscuits), but both of us were struggling to get anywhere near finishing our food.Service was quick and friendly.

The portions are huge, I definitely couldn't finish it.

The mac and cheese with prosciutto and truffles really hit the spot for me on a cold night.There were many good options for a rich dessert, though after gorging on the mac dish I opted for ice cream - the pineapple sorbet was somehow creamy, while the blood orange creme fraiche sherbet and grapefruit sorbet were both great palate cleansers.Fair prices, not too loud, lots of space.

Like a highly anticipated OkCupid date, I WANTED to be swept off my feet at first sight (or bite), or at the very least enjoy my meat for the night. Alas, disappointment. On December 1, 2012, I had one of the three worst steaks of my entire life here. A samurai sword couldn't cut through the thing. I had asked our server for a recommendation on a lean, unseasoned cut of tender beef that could be (un?)cooked bleeding rare, and she told me I absolutely had to go with their hanger steak. More like a hang-her steak... I was so depressed after I tried to stab this chewy, fatty, slathered-in-sauce brick, that I contemplated carbocide, resorting to the bread basket to fill my growling stomach. I also had no idea the brick came with a huge mountain of fries (didn't say on the menu), and it was too late to swap it out once it came to the table. Fries don't fly with me, y'all. Nor my skinny jeans. My friends were similarly unimpressed, and my girl that ordered the same steak as me ended up bagging it up for her pooch and/or the bum down the block. Honestly, we had heard so many good things about Almond, maybe I should try something else on the menu, or give the brunch a shot. Maaaaybe - It's a little too fresh and painful for me right now.

4.0,1/2/2013,"Came with 3 people for brunch.  Had no issues getting a table.  During the winter time, this place is okay, not too warm.They gave us muffins while we waited with salted butter and apricot jam I believe.  Muffins tasted great with both types of spreads either combined of eaten individually.The muffins weren't heavily buttered either.We ordered the Almond Hash and House made Brioche French Toast.The french toast was good, but not great.  Mainly because of the bread.  Definitely not the best bread I've had for french toast and the cost doesn't really justify it.  A little on the pricier side for french toast.  However, the walnuts were really good.  I believe they were roasted with some sugar.  Tasted amazingly fresh.  The bananas were thinly sliced and the dried cranberries was an excellent addition to the dish.  It's sour taste didn't over power the dish.  Only little issue was the server forgot to bring the syrup.  The syrup was good too.  Not watered down and had lots of flavor in it.  The toast had some cinnamon in it but I would have liked it to have more egg on the toast.The Almond Hash was good.  The salsa that came with it helped elevate the dish because it added some kick to it.  The duck and poached egg was slightly overcooked.  I also didn't see a pool of oil on the bottom of the dish, which was good.  Overall, still a great dish and would recommned it.Service was excellent.  The waiters/waitress were relatively young and were very friendly and attentive to your needs.  As long as the service is still excellent and food still tastes great, I guess the cost can be justified.I would definitely come here again for brunch.They also have a pool table in the backroom.  That's awesome!",2,0,0,Leo O.,"Queens, NY",200,518,1703

3.0,12/29/2012,"When tasked with finding a brunch spot in the Flatiron area that would appeal to the wide array of tastes in my large group, I offered Almond as a suggestion.  We approached the country-style dining room and glanced at the menu board.  From what we could tell, it appeared that both the breakfast-centric brunch menu and the standard lunch offerings were both available.  We were thrilled by this, since everyone had the opportunity to order what they wanted.  We checked in with the hostess, who was less than friendly, and then got stuck waiting around for her to escort us to one of the many vacant tables.  We claimed our seats and called over the waitress to confirm the available menus.  Sadly, we were told that the brunch offerings were all that were available at that time.  We tried to make satisfying selections from the remaining choices while we munched on delicious buttermilk biscuits with sweet berry jam and cinnamon apple butter.  I pieced together a meal of 2 scrambled egg whites and a fruit salad.  The eggs were topped with scallions, but otherwise bland and runny.  The fruit salad included bananas, kiwi, mango, and gala apples.  My side mug of coffee was just rich and dark enough to brighten my morning.While everyone was content with their meal, no one found it memorable or really worth a repeat visit.  I found this sad, as I loved the location, decor, and farm-to-table sensibility.  The execution of both the dishes and service were just poorly executed.",1,1,0,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640

3.0,12/14/2012,"3.5 stars- maybe 4 but I decided I need to revert to a more strict rating system (too many in betweens getting 4 stars these days).  I always thought that Almond has been more of a ""scene-y"" place than a ""foodie"" place but I came here for a work lunch on a Friday around noon (P.S. it was DEAD around this time- easy to get a rez, but not so the case come 1pm), and it wasn't bad at all.  It was pretty ok to good.  In fact, if you stick with just the American favorites (salads, burgers) you might enjoy yourself.  I would veer away from their $21 pre fixe menu as it doesn't seem particularly interesting. I came with 2 others, and one of them got the Tuna Nicose Sandwich. Portions are big here!  It seemed like nothing out of the ordinary ( didn't come with fries, just lots of salad, which is good).  Didn't see as much tuna as bread.  She seemed to like it.  The other companion and I both got the turkey burger- this was pretty good.  It's not the best turkey burger I've had from a flavor stance but it was hearty (very big actually).  I didn't taste much of the sriracha mayo (which I don't mind as I hate mayo, I specifically asked if there was a lot on it- the waiter said no).  But I do wish there was more cumin in the patty, or at least that the bun was more toasted. It was a bit greasy... but not bad.  Ultimately, it was a juicy burger that held up well, so I can't complain.  The salad was a bit overdressed but nothing wrong with mixed greens. The fries were actually very good and crispy.  Our service was good- our waiter frequently checked up on us and he refilled waters pretty regularly.  For dessert, we shared the Chocolate Pots Du Creme, which I really liked.  It had salted caramel in it- which is always good. The creme fraiche was just so rich and delicious with the pistachios.  If I wasn't so full from pigging out on the fries, I would have had more of this. All in all, the decor is whatever but the space is very big and open. I could see how this place does well for groups and brunch.  Beware to make a res though- seems like esp. for lunch it gets very packed. Not cheap though- my burger was $16 and things range to the low $20s here.",0,0,1,Stephanie Y.,"New York, NY",878,1242,25

At Almond, the dra are from a NY brewery and they were pretty good! Sedric gave us a couple samples before we ordered a pint. At the end of the night when it was time to settle up he told us he comped our drinks. What a wonderful surprise!

I enjoyed my cobb salad--the chicken confit made it great.The interior is a mix of modern, homey, and upscale. The waitstaff and hosts deliver smiles, but it is definitely not intimate.

Comes with duck confit, roasted onions, potatoes, duck cracklins, and a poached egg. Extremely savory and hearty, served in a large portion.The waiter also recommended the lemon curd ricotta pancakes which had a great, fluffy texture with a sweet/tart flavor. Super awesome.

4.0,11/6/2012,"On one of the first truly chilly nights of the winter, a friend suggested we meet at Almond for a bite. This is a place I've passed by every day on my way to and from work, but never felt compelled to walk in the door. I'm glad I did!The exterior presents a certain bland vibe that I'm pleased to say did not persist. We sat at the long bar by the wood-burning fire, though the space is huge and had we wanted a table there would have been no wait. The service was friendly and casual, there when you needed but not pushy. We ordered a couple starters and sides to share... the house-smoked bluefish appetizer was a hefty portion: a light and crispy potato latke topped with thick slabs of savory smoked fish, the plate was brushed with an understated yogurt sauce that paired perfectly. The charred squid was next, also big enough to be a main course, and took the consistency of a loosely chopped salad with avocado, sliced potato, charred rounds of squid and some salty sea beans -- accompanied by a mysterious, spicy red compote and a rich tangy mayo-based sauce. It was tasty, enjoyed thoroughly by my friend as I'm not a huge fan of squid that's not friend up into crispy calamari. We indulged in two sides as well: the roasted brussel sprouts with pancetta & candied walnuts were perfect, over-done so as to bring out the sweet and flaky leaves, all drizzled with lemon to brighten. Finally, the macaroni came out still boiling in a ceramic dish (the best way to receive any dish) - it had a wonderful blend of cheeses not too rich or salty, not too sharp, and just the right amount to deliciously douse the al dente penne. Reluctantly, I allowed my friend to take home the left-overs...",1,0,1,Chelsey P.,"New York, NY",2,17,1

Alas, I am better at picking dining venues than playing matchmaker. The space is cavernous and it has a sort of casual, take-your-Little-League-team-here feel to it, if that sort of thing existed in Manhattan. Very family-friendly. Strollers abound.In addition to the stilted conversation, I also recall ordering a Bloody Mary that tasted like it had fish juice in it. After I embarrassedly sent it back however (I usually suffer through my bad menu picks in silence), the waiter replaced it for a mimosa at no extra charge.  We split the Almond Hash ($16) and the Chicken Sausage and the Eggs ($15). The former was definitely superior, although I distinctly remember feeling very heavy and greasy after the meal.The best part? A complimentary basket of flaky mini-biscuits with a selection of jams.

I could eat just that alone for a meal. I had the almond hash which was fantastic. Basically duck confit with hashbrowns and two poached eggs with toast for $15. Portions here are fairly large and many people had trouble finishing their food. A friend had the pistrami which was endorsed by the waiter but the meat was very dry.I would probably come back here for brunch if I had a large group with me as they have an ample amount of space with round tables large enough to seat 7-8 people.

[they were sitting on a shelf.]  although i could have simply taken the plates from the empty yet set table next to us, i chose to not go that route because it would ""rob"" the guests that were to sit next to us of their plates.and then there was the ""coffee"" issue.  our guest had to request coffee refills at least 4 times.  the last and final time really tried my patience.  our server refilled the  coffee for the guests next to us - 12"" away from us - but not our table.  our guest attempted to get the server's attention for a refill, but was unable to.as we prepared to leave, the manager came to clear our plates.  he graciously asked us how our experience was...this is always a nice touch.in the end, my nephew (13 years old) summed it up.  the food was okay, the service was satisfactory, but it would not warrant a return...there was nothing stellar about this restaurant.  with the vast amount of restaurants in the city, i would much rather spend my food dollars at a place that has both good service AND good food.at least the almond hash did not disappoint us...",0,0,0,Jay C.,"Honolulu, HI",1,124,6

We ordered muscles for the table and had to send them back because they were swimming in sand. I think they took our request to rinse the muscles more thoroughly too seriously because when we received our ""sautéed"" spinach and lobster/rock shrimp ravioli they were literally swimming in water Instead of any flavor or sauce, not to mention the ravioli were cold and undercooked.This was by far the most flavorless and horribly disappointing meal I think I have EVER had. I was amazed at how the chef could put something so horrible on our table, as if a 2yr old served it. Did the chef go to junior high school (where home e. is taught) let alone culinary school?A disgusting, terrible, horrible, disappointing waste of money.

I got a ""Fire in The Hole"" cocktail (tequila, jalepeno syrup, fresh lime, rocks, salted rim)--very refreshing but with a kick to it. Highly recommend. My friend got the oysters which were which were served in this delish sauce. The serving sizes are pretty big. Con: Not too many options for vegetarians or vegans, however, the eggplant 3 ways is worth getting. The best thing about this place was that when I ""checked in"" on my Yelp app, I was offered a $5 discount on any order above $30.

She munches on her gnocchi au gratin side dish, fork in one fist, while she waves at people going down 22nd St. with the other hand.  The service is great in the evenings, less so during weekday lunch, but it's never bad/mediocre. We've never done weekend brunch there because it looked a bit crazy and packed, but if you are into a bustling, vibrant brunch crowd, this place would be your cup of mimosa. The seafood is fresh here, and the menu is mostly New American with some bistro fare. A crazy innovative menu, it doesn't have, but it is not completely unambitious, either.  The strengths are the location, space, friendly service, comfortable decor, seafood, and outdoor deck on the sidewalk. The weaknesses are bad acoustics, smallish entree portions (strangely, their sides are huge in comparison- 2 sides can make a meal), and the occasional disappointment (croque gratin a l'oignon was very sparse on the marrow but otherwise tasted fine).",0,0,0,M H.,"Manhattan, NY",2,93,2

Dropping in on Almond in May for brunch, which was memorable mostly for a street parade's raucous beats disrupting the entire experience, I returned last weekend for another try.The second outing at Almond was a tour de force of precision service, uncompromising ambience, and flavorful statements on every plate. A warm greeting by the host gave way to the complimentary basket of warm mini biscuits--just the right give-to-flake ratio--accompanied by a trio of homemade jams. Jason Weiner, Chef/Partner, and his team at Almond have managed to hardcode a brunch dish in my mind--the Almond hash: Duck confit mingling with roasted potatoes and onions, crowned with poached eggs.

As you walk in, you're greeted by a raw bar with a boiled octopus as the centerpiece, with clams, oysters, and jumbo shrimp joining the party.We sat at the back of the restaurant, near the really cool billiards room (free games of pool by the way). From this seat you get a great view of the rest of the restaurant. We started with the charcuterie, which was very nice. The reason why I'm going with 4 stars instead of 5 - I really didn't like the pork chop. It's pounded out and fried. I did not see this coming and I think that the preparation was the reason for the dryness. On top of that, the beans had a strong taste of vinegar.

Ok, enough immature references aside and continuing on, the lamb short ribs had a rich sauce, and the little pieces of pasta/gnocchi that accompanied it were fantastic. This restaurant surprised me. The duck with scallop was also fantastic. The duck was juicy and delicious. And the scallops - perfectly cooked, no real complaints there. The drinks here feel a bit pricey at $8+ a pint, but I suppose this is a nicer joint. Group dinners here would work also as this place is quite large.$40 pp after tax tip is pricier than most places, but the portion size was good and filling for a French restaurant.

The colors make me think of autumn while the tile on the wall behind the bar remind me of the Smith. Pretty generic, but cute nonetheless.When we were seated our server arrived quickly to take our order. I decided to have the House Made Chicken Sausage & Eggs.

My friend and I are southern girls so you have come correct when it comes to biscuits. My chicken sausage with eggs were good, eggs were cooked perfectly.The only complaint I have about Almond is the bathrooms. For an establishment that is so cute and nicely decorated, the bathrooms were on some other level scary. There are several individual bathrooms along a hallway. I walked into at least three. The first two were disgusting smelled bad, unflushed, with toilet paper wet and all over the floor. The lesser of the three evils had a broken toilet seat, toilet paper on the floor, and the tiles on the wall were cracked. Not like some tiny crack, I mean huge spidering out crack. It looked like a mini fight club session went down in there. Do they not check to make sure the bathrooms are up to par? Do you not use your own bathrooms?

The interior was homey with a wooden interior like an old trendy French farmhouse. There were also small tables on the sidewalk outside. I felt cool being there.(Debra Messing was there.)My husband ordered a juicy steak with a delicious light gravy sauce. I've had an obsession with organic burgers and salty fries lately. But I was let down by the burger (boring white bun, small burger patty, not sure if it was organic because it lacked any special taste although the waitress said they mix the ground beef in house). The fries were crispy and delicious. For dessert, I ordered a tarte au chocolat with strawberries and blueberries and whipped topping for dessert. It was truly delicious!  I think if I had ordered any other entrée I would have given it five stars overall.

Immediately you will notice a mass amount of strollers upon entry, but don't fret as all these gramercy park babies are surprisingly well behaved. Plus, I think it tough to hear them over the bloody mary infused drunks talking over each other in this massive restaurant.The menu is great, very diverse and has something for everyone. The raw bar in itself is a plus and sort of gives Almond a ""Balthazar"" feel without the price. That's another thing, the prices here are perfect.

We wanted white wine and they suggested the Sancerre -- it was delicious. and by the time we sat down we were ready to order our second glass. Little did we know the sancerre would run us about $17 bucks a glass. Nevertheless, we enjoyed it. We ordered the mussels as our appetizer. The portion was plenty large to split and they were delicious. I only wish they gave more pieces of the toasted baguette to dip in the sauce since it was so yummy.

Hubby and I both got the steak, me hanger and him new York strip. Instead of fries I got brussel sprouts, and he got gnocchi. Good tip, you don't have to pay the $7 they charge for sides if you just replace the fries with one of those sides. My brussel sprouts was heavenly, so was the gnocchi. My hanger steak was huge, I could barely finish half and was cooked right. My hubby's steak came out overlooked so we sent it back. He was OK with the steak once he got a new one, it was cooked right the second time but he thought the meat was too fattie.  We got a side of Mac & cheese for our son and he loved it.  Overall good food and reasonable price and great portion.

4.0,2/6/2012,"Sometimes it kills me that yelp doesn't offer half star reviews because I really want to give this restaurant a 3.5.  So I came here for my friends 25th birthday celebration.  There had to 10 plus of us. (maybe more)  They seated us once we got here and they didn't even mind that the birthday girl had arrived 15 minutes late, which was a total plus for me.  So let's get straight down to the food.  Their food here is excellent.  If it was just about that, then I would give it 5 stars.  I ordered the Roasted chicken which was absolutely divine.  I never eat dark meat on chicken and I devoured every morsel that was on my plate.  The collard greens and mashed potatoes were not over packed with garlic.   It was just perfection, including the sauce that complimented the greens/chicken/mashed potatoes.  I wanted to storm the kitchen and congratulate the chief because it was that good.  My friend who was sitting next to me got the Arctic Char which was fantastic too but I'm very sensitive to which fishes I am particular to and this wasn't my cup of tea but still it was excellent.  Her husband who sat across from me got a very handsome looking burger (I do not eat red meat but the fries were a perfect ratio between crispy and salty.)On a side note the birthday girl had ordered the their butternut/vanilla squash puree, which was absolutely, hands down, the best thing ever.  Try it!!! The only negative to this place had to be our waitress.  She was very helpful on her suggestions but she was very pushy with us a whole group.  She made her initial suggestions but as the meal went on she kept pressing us to order more alcohol or a huge plate of cookies for dessert (The cookies here are 8 dollars a pop.)  I love suggestions from my waiters/waitresses but there comes a point where you are either attentive to your guests or your over bearing them to make the bill larger.  It's a fine line but here is my bottom line.  This restaurant is excellent and I can't blame our waitress for wanting a bigger bill because she's guaranteed an 18% tip but let us enjoy the birthday girl's dinner.",2,2,0,Cynthia L.,"Astoria, NY",32,30,0

I hesitate to spill the beans but it's the back room.  There are couches, a pool table, cozy decor, and friendly attentive waiter/waitress service.  That, along with a lovely wine list and killer beers on tap (mostly local and including Checkered Cab, a Meghan M. favorite) made this a totally relaxed and easy happy hour.  It's not cheap but Almond easily gets my happy hour endorsement.",2,0,3,Meghan M.,"Boston, MA",161,1055,8

The hosts wee very cordial as they organized our table for 8.We usually start with a cocktail at the bar but since there was 8 of us we went ahead to our table as it was ready. I could not pass up the 'caboose' cocktail -  gin, crushed cukes and salted rim. It's nice to see savory options on the cocktail menu instead of all the fruity-sweet drinks which dominate a lot of cocktail menus. Seating was a little tight and chairs uncomfortable but hey! were in a brasserie.I went out on the limb with the sardine, avo, hearts of palm app. It worked for me, loved the marinated sardine. Many interesting options and I went with Lamb Bolognese which was made with fresh pasta.

I recently had some octopus at Pylos that was exceptional, but Almond's octopus was just as good, if not better. My favorite part of the menu had to be the chilled curried mussels. They were pulled from the shell, chilled, slathered in a rich but delicate curry, creamy sauce, and served in their original shell. I could have eaten those all night. My next favorite might have been the scallop and fennel crudo, followed by the braise lamb. It seems the restaurant specializes in unique seafood dishes, and it really pleased me. If seafood wins first place, dessert earns second. A buckwheat pancake with pomegranate ice cream on top now reigns supreme as my ultimate dessert.

Except the sausage was so huge and overbearing I couldn't help but laugh that it literally is the size of  give wieners.

5.0,1/6/2012,"I was initially a little cautious of trying this place out given the assortment of mediocre to poor reviews of this place.I came here for dinner so no disappointing brunch and seriously... the AC failing is a total pain in the ass in the middle of Summer, but I'd assume that's not a regular occurrence.Anyways, made reservations here for an 8pm dinner and the table was pretty much immediately available at the time. That's always nice, especially when it seems my luck lately is despite having reservations there being a wait.The space has a good feel and ambience to it despite having an open layout and no real nooks or crannies. Conversations flowed freely at every table around, yet you have no problems hearing the one at your own table.The service was a bit slow to start out with, but as the restaurant thinned out it became better. This is definitely a place to have a slow and enjoyable meal.It was also the first place in a long time with a menu that had an assortment and solid variety of options that were all very appealing, which makes the decision for food a tad more difficult.I was torn between the mac & cheese entree and the hangar steak but was pleasantly surprised they were able to make a side portioned size of it for just a few bucks more than the side of regular mac and cheese freeing me up to have my hangar steak and fries as well.With the whole truffle fad and how rich they taste, it's been so easy to find a bad truffle dish as restaurants think it's ok to just dump in a bunch of truffles, up the price and call it a day. The mac & cheese with the chopped truffles and prosciutto however is perfectly balanced here.

Buttery and crispy potatoes topped with a poached egg and hollandaise sauce with a duck confit. I couldn't taste much of the duck, but the eggs and and the potatoes were prepared very well. The ricotta pancakes come with seasonal berries and a lemon curd. They were very good. Very light and fluffy. The sourness of the lemon curd paired with maple syrup were an excellent combination. The berries were kind of sour however and kind of haphazardly tossed on top like an afterthought. They also didn't taste very seasonal, but it's a minor complaint. I will probably return again.

Take me on a date there! But, our table of 3 was sat inside. Still, not bad. The bar looked like a good crowd (saw a friend of an ex). The waiter was sweet. The service was good. Per the manager's orders, our water glasses must always be full.Our glasses of wine came in 2 minutes.  Five minutes later after placing our entree order, I asked if we could add the escargot - a favorite of mine. We were told the food was already being plated. Fine, maybe it was 10 minutes later but....big pet peeve of mine. I believe when you dine out, it's as much about the experience as the food. You are seated. Given some time to peruse the drink menu. Place that order. After you cheers your drinks, soon to follow with the meal order. And then, I expect to be given time to sit with my dining companion(s) to talk. To enjoy ourselves. Rather than food coming and going with no breaks at our table.Our escargot made it out 3 minutes before the entrees. Very different than usual at french restaurants but very good. Light and full of herbs.The meals - the special of the day shrimp scampi was ok. The veal and pork cavatelli was ok but was missing something to make it stand out (like a great sauce?). And my scallops were underwhelming and the corn they were placed on - too sweet.Finishing with the white russian milkshake helped the score. Though, it was less white russian and more vanilla milkshake - which I fortunately like.I had much higher hopes for this place. Because there wasn't anything to really piss me off (good service, timely, nice), I would go back to try any of the Croque sandwiches.

There was some amazing points to the dishes and some dish were great, just not off the wall mind blowing... If you see a dish with peas in it (it was seasonal) be sure to get it. Somehow they made green peas sooooo yummy! Take a moment to have a glass of champagne and oysters at the bar, the bartenders were smiley and inviting and for people watching, it's a great vantage point!The warm octopus app was heavenly. The steak dishes were typical. Good, but you will find it familiar. We also ordered the Mac n Cheese which was rich, heavy, but nice to pick at.

The mussels are also delicious. They're soaked in a beautiful white wine, sauce toped with shallots and parsley.

He got the Burger with all the fixings and he was licking his chops all night. I had the skirt steak with fries and then I ordered the creamed corn, which might I add I really, really wanted, even more than the steak. For my appetizer, I had the duck prosciutto... pretty good, although not as much flavor as I expected. Well the entrees came out but my corn didn't. I had to ask 4 times for my corn. We finished our meals and asked for the check. The check came and then they set down my corn. Boyfriend tipped generously,  despite my objections. Tasty, if mediocre, food. Service was bad. Not awful, just bad.

We both had the roast chicken: he with string beans and no potatoes and I with both string beans and potatoes. The chicken was perfectly cooked (and a nice sized on-the-bone portion), the green beans were a tad underdone (but good), and the potatoes were, well, mushy, creamy, and not so good. I avoided the bread that came in the starter basket (as I had just woofed down a XL popcorn at the theater), but my bf said it was warm and tasty (though who eats whipped butter these days?

1.0,2/25/2011,"Normally I like to get a place two tries but I will pass in this case especially considering that the table behind us had the same problem as we did...Let me start by saying I found Almond through the Flatiron street food stalls and loved their pastrami. The guys were extremely friendly and who can resist to double smoked pastrami with homemade pickles? So on a cold January night, my husband and I walked 12 blocks thinking we would get smoky deliciousness. Think of our disappointment when the menu was mostly a twist on French food...So we ordered two burgers medium rare with a side of Mac and cheese. Their burgers are 16 dollars, which is pricey for a burger but which I am willing to pay for a succulent juicy burger. What came though was a well cooked burger. There were no special toppings or sauce and it was well done...for both of us! There was too much bun, a brioche to make it ""fancier"". I almost brushed it off, especially since we had waited for a while and were hungry, but then the guy at the table behind us complained about the same thing. And the worst is that the waitress flicked her phone open to shine light on the burger patty and declared: ""seems medium rare to me""!In short, please send the cook back to school; if you can't get basics right, try harder or consider a career change. Second, 16 dollars for a bland burger tha isn't even grass fed local beed or bison or kobe is a waste of money. I was fooled one but you won't catch me again.",0,0,0,Joy R.,"West New York, NJ",4,16,5

Anyway, after passing Almond a billion times on my way to work, I decided to give it a try when my dad suggested I pick a spot nearby to meet recently. This lunch ended up taking a solid hour and 40 minutes, and not by choice. We both ordered (cold) salmon nicoise salads, so really, there was little to prepare. The salads were good, but certainly not outstanding or complicated enough to take over an hour to make. Not to mention that not once did a waiter come by to refresh our drinks or give us an update on the status of our meals.

The service was very good; we always had biscuits (more on these later) and glasses filled all the time. It's a spacious layout, so even when the restaurant filled up later, there was no problem talking at the table.The food itself was a mixed bag. The biscuits served prior to the meal were fantastic. They're small but very buttery, and you get butter and two types of jam to choose from. I ended up getting the homemade chicken sausage and eggs for the main course. The home fries were a bit dry, and while the chicken sausage was decent, it was a bit chewy and didn't have as solid a composition as I would've preferred. The flavor was also very sausage-like and not distinct (like the chicken sausage at Cafe Orlin, for example). Eggs are...well, eggs. It's hard to get much variety on those.Almond is a solid place for brunch, but it's not particularly that spectacular. The orange juice is squeezed fresh, which was nice.

3.0,12/5/2010,"My date and I were hankering for some classic American-ish food (roasted chicken, steak, veggies), and funnily enough were led to Almond by a faulty AT&T network (or maybe it was the Yelp iPhone app?) pointing us to a perfect 5-star page for ""Almond Restaurant"" here: yelp.com/biz/almond-rest…. Being that it had only 3 reviews, we figured it was a cool new place we should check out. It wasn't until the network issue cleared up after dinner when I tried to check in again that I found the real page. Yelp should really port those reviews over to this page!For the most part, I have to say I really liked Almond. From the moment we walked in, I liked the look and feel of the place. It was warm and inviting. The bar also seemed to be a happening spot, though I couldn't tell you about the drink specials if there were any on a Friday. I ordered the grilled chicken on the suggestion of the woman who took our orders while my date got the steak frites and we split a side of sauteed greens. Everything was very good. I was pleasantly surprised especially by the potatoes that came with my chicken and the greens, because frankly I never expect much from potatoes and these were a nice mix of mushy and solid potatoey goodness and the greens were heavy on the garlic - yum!Unfortunately, there were two things that kept me from giving this place a 4-star review. The first was the price -- it was $19 for my chicken, and while it was definitely a sizable portion and cooked perfectly well, it wasn't anywhere near $19-for-half-a-chicken worthy. I can't imagine the ingredients cost them more than $5 if even. The other thing was our first server, who basically disappeared after we told him we needed a couple of minutes. 10-15 minutes later, another server (the woman I mentioned) noticed us looking around confused and offered to take our orders. We still don't know what the deal was with our first server, because he took of us after that (though he mixed up our drinks). Weird. TLDR: good food but a bit expensive.

It's nicely decorated interior, although the faintness of the font on the menu and the dim lighting present a little bit of a challenge when perusing the menu. I settled on getting the Hot Pastrami Sandwich. It comes on whole grain bread with mustard, saurkraut, and swiss cheese. It was decent enough, although quite heavy and greasy, but I should have gathered that since there isn't a pastrami sandwich in existence that isn't both of those things. I could have used a little bit more saurkraut on it and the pastrami could have been a little bit more tender. The fries were just ok. Greasy, but somewhat soggy and in very small cuts.The price is a little bit expensive which would be in line with most Flatiron restaurants. I'd be hesitant to come here again as the Pastrami sandwich is actually one of the cheaper options at $14. Most other lunch entrees will run about $20.

He described the lengthy list of toppings which includes gravy, bacon lardo, scallions, and mozzarella cheese. We were intrigued yet scared it might be a disaster. Much to our surprise, it was delicious. The skinny fries were not soggy because it was not drenched in gravy. It sat on top of it along with good chunks of fatty goodness of bacon lardo and cheese. It was indeed a disco in your mouth with all those flavors. The entree we ordered was the Ragu of Lamb Shoulder served with saffron gnocchi. The lamb was fall of the bone tender with a good deep flavor. However, the orange zest added a citrus note that was a bit overpowering. The gnocchi complemented the lamb perfectly.

The french toast was good... but after a few bites it was pretty heavy and became too sweet. They brought out canadian bacon to those of us that ordered regular bacon. After we pointed out that they got everybody's bacon order wrong, they brought out the right ones.

BFF agreed, and mom doesn't touch the raw stuff. As an entree we all split the ravioli of polenta and marscarpone, which was served with corn, zucchini and squash blossoms. This was so good that I kept putting more on my plate from the shared plate. Had it not been inappropriate, I might have licked the plate. maybe.

I've been for dinner and brunch and I have to say the portions are usually quite large. TIP: get the Mussels small plate for dinner vs. the large if you're ordering for yourself. The Frites have to be ordered separately, sadly. The eggplant three ways appetizer - for those eggplant fans - is ""meh"" and the mac and cheese is worth a try. The food overall is very good, but I've never been blown away. The real perk is the front porch and the size of the restaurant.

It was a beautiful morning and so we were very happy. It's really nice to have a good brunch without the anxiety of knowing when or whether you'll get a table. We were probably lucky with the outdoor tables (there's probably 10 or so outdoor tables) but Almond has quite a large capacity inside so I would expect that getting a table fairly quickly would be the norm if you're not fussed as to whether you're indoors or outdoors. I had the croque monsieur with tomato which was yummy and just so huge - you could definitely share it between 2 I think.  My husband had the omelette and was happy with his also.

Wine - An extensive wine list that features French and American wines.  Try the muscadet with an order of oysters. Service - The service was outstanding.  The wait staff is both knowledgeable and attentive (but not overly so, which always appreciated). Space  - The restaurant has a great layout with a huge bar along one side, plenty of space between tables, an outdoor patio in front and a pool table in the back.  There's also an open kitchen with a huge oven as the centerpiece.  Very comfortable space, with great lighting.  This is easily one of my favorite restaurants in Manhattan and Bridgehampton, and last night reminded me of all the reasons why.

I am on the hunt for a fantastically cheesy mac and cheese with just enough mac to serve as a vehicle to transport the cheese to my mouth.

Good and great presentation.  Anyway, I ordered the special of the day which was a sort of lamb rack with a cream cucumber sauce or something.  I'm not exactly sure what I'd call it, but it was the least impressive thing at the table.  Edible, but unexceptional.  More impressive was the Mac and Cheese with proscuitto and the Seabass with bacon skewer that my friends had.  Luckily we agreed to do it smorgasboard style so we shared everything and a side of green beans (ahem... haricot verts).  It was quite good. As was the blueberry tart.  Service was friendly and attentive.  It's rare to find servers that will actually smile and engage with you.  There seems to be a professionalism (or uppitiness) that plagues most NYC waiters, but this staff seems to enjoy their jobs.  Stop by the bar too.  While we were waiting they were extremely gracious.  Anyway,  it was pretty great with a nice, cozy ambient feel.  You could even come to get smashed and play pool!  Win-win!",0,1,0,Anders C.,"New York, NY",0,1,0

4.0,7/21/2010,"A-MAZ-ing food. Have to start with that because the taste buds got THAT much of a treat. Everything I had melted in my mouth. Starting with the short ribs served with thin roasted potato slices. The sauce was so good on this dish that we asked for more bread so we could dip it in and ended up wiping the plate clean (no we weren't starved savages who would've devoured anything edible). Then came the entrees: I had ""King Salmon"" (Tuesday special), which came with roasted turnips, sweet potato (I think) puree and little bacon bits - all soooo good, plus some more amazing sauce (a different one). My brother had the Lamb and lucky me I got a taste: now this was a true explosion of flavors in my mouth: I distinctly recall the salty sausage with the slightly sweeter roasted peppers and soothing chickpea puree, all of which came beautifully together for some moments of pleaure chewing. Juming ahead, not that crazy about the chocolate brownie ice cream dessert (and this is saying a lot for me who eats ANY chocolate).Now on to their weaker spot, at least in my experience: the service. Our waiter was awesome, very helpful and prompt when it was up to him, so nothing against him. However, the wait between meals, especially for dessert, was incredibly long. Too few cooks for too many guests?  Then the bus boy just seemed like it was his first day: he brings out one appetizer for share but no little plates, we ask for them, he delivers; one was dirty with dried food on it so we send it back, he brings back clean, we realize he took our used utensils but never replaced them, we ask for them, he brings them out, and on and on.

Outside, if you can get a table, is quieter and also makes for a lovely atmosphere. The food is great. You can't go wrong with too much here. I've tried the burger, steak, roast chicken... it's all great. Bartenders and servers are friendly and down to earth. Interesting beers on tap, yummy cocktails, extensive wine list.

The food was equally as satifying...I ended up with the flat bread to start...lovely thin crust topped with caramelized onions, goat cheese and arugula. DELISH!!!

3.0,5/2/2010,"My buddy knows the owner of Almond, and he called in a last minute reservation here on a super busy, gorgeous Friday evening at 8:45 PM for 10 people. They accommodated us immediately and gave us what I would consider is the best table in the house, a large, round antique dining table that would fit just as well in an oversized, contemporary country kitchen as it does towards the front of Almond's main dining room. Good start. Almond's atmosphere is intriguing, with re-claimed, wide paneled walls, look like they could have been taken off of an old seaman's chapel in Nantucket. There's a long bar stretching down the length of the left side of the main room, at the end of the bar is an ice chest, which housed an octopus, which I noted later in the evening had been removed. Did someone eat that thing? The lighting inside is medium, not too dark, I would say ""just right"".Not too much on the menu that suits my fancy. Then again I don't really like French food. However, since French food has to be expensive, because we as Americans are simply ""used to it"", kinda like how gas is $3 a gallon even though with the barrel price and refining costs we should be paying less, but we're ""used to"" $3/gal and okay with paying it, same goes for French cuisine. I could rant for hours about this. But, regardless, Almond's prices really aren't too bad.I wasn't in love with the wine list, but I tried a fairly priced Californian Pinot Noir at $8 and enjoyed it. I wasn't in the mood to chow down, so I ordered something small, the mac-and-cheese, which is closer to baked ziti with prosciutto. I wasn't in love, it was ok, the smokey proscuitto kind of had this effect on the way it tasted that reminded me of the time I once made a lasagna in my brand-new gas oven at home and there was this weird new-manufactured-goods-factory type aroma and taste to it. I think I picked the wrong dish.I enjoyed the fresh bread, I also tried some of my friend's NY Strip and it was pretty darn good, as were his fries. I'm sorry, ""frites"". On just the mac-and-cheese I might rate Almond as a 2-star, but I'll bump it to 3 for the overall experience. Everyone else seemed to really be enjoying their food. Would I go back? Perhaps not, I think I would rather go a few blocks north to Artisnal.",0,0,0,Doug G.,"Kings Park, NY",124,251,14
3.0,4/25/2010,"Almond is a nice looking place with a nice looking menu but follows up with average food.  It has an aged grand style decor with cracked subway tiles on the walls and wood panels with slightly peeling paint to give it that experienced look.  I liked that part about it.  The place is also very large so good if you're looking for a group spot.The menu is interesting with a rotating list of daily specials and your usual seafood, chicken, lamb, steak options.  I found it to be a bit pricey mid $20s for an entree sans sides.  I ordered the grass fed flatiron and crumbled rocquefort and had a taste of the ragu of pork shank and was disappointed with both.  My steak was fine, but the shoestring fries it came with left me feeling that you need to order a side.  I'm used to this at a steakhouse, but expected a little more of an inclusive meal here.  The pork ragu was very dry with basically no sauce so I wouldn't recommend that without a large glass of water.I found the service to be pretty good with attentive waiters refilling water and wine glasses.So I've only been to dinner here, and while I don't have anything really bad to say about the place I just don't think I need to go there again.",0,0,0,Albert H.,"Chicago, IL",29,85,4

I got the omelette with chorizo and it was pretty much just that.... nothing to write home about. My sister got the greek yogurt and homemade granola. The granola just seemed like a pile of oats and raisins... You could taste a little bit of vanilla in there, but it wasn't clustered up like its supposed to be.I also got a Bloody Mary and it was one of the worse one's I have had in the city. If there aren't bits of horseradish or black pepper floating around, I usually don't even both tasting it.

The waitstaff was patient with us and very kind. Our waiter was very nice and helpful with his food and drink knowledge. The cocktails were really nice and I agree the bread and butter was tasty.I don't remember the exact dishes I ordered as this was close to a year ago but I know I was impressed with everything.

For dinner we ordered the Almond Plateau Royale. This includes 8 oysters, 8 littleneck clams, shrimp, 1/2 lb lobster, scallops, marinated octopus, and mussel cocktail. We split this all between two and both left satisfied. I wasn't a big fan of the scallops, but they are mixed in with fennel and I don't like fennel (mystery solved). Everything else was amazing! I don't like clams, but these were good. We didn't finish dinner til around 1am, but the staff never rushed us. The crowd at the bar got a little weird, but didn't interfere with a great time.

I'm stopping short of saying excellent, but I am giving this four stars, so y'know... maybe great after all.Incidentally, the cocktail sauce for their oysters is unusually good.

Either give less hash or give another egg - common sense because even just looking at the plate, you know something just doesn't look right.  And don't order the OJ - someone mentioned it previously but I'll say it again - it is from the carton and not fresh-squeezed.  Service:  Varies with the server but overall good.  The manager is friendly.",2,0,0,Mags M.,"Bernardsville, NJ",0,211,0

I started with the escargots. Why, WHY would you serve them warm/room temperature and, to add insult to injury, stick bread in with the snails? I want my escargot pure and piping hot, thanks. I also got the flounder, based on recs here. No one (slash the menu) mentioned that it is fried. YUCK! Luckily, one of my dinner companions had ordered the mac and cheese which was -- other than the delicious bread and butter -- the best part of the meal.My dessert policy is usually to only get it if I've loved the meal. I made an exception mostly because I was still hungry. EH. How can you make an apple crisp that isn't at least somewhat tasty? I don't know, but almond did.

Their wine list is fine, a little over priced I think.We had a cheese board which came with crostinis, some dried fruit, and candied walnuts. Everything on the board was tasty and gorgeously presented. Our order of copa crudo (pork shoulder) was devine and was served with a delicious mustard and tomato confit. We then decided to have some chilled lobster cocktail... which was fresh. Nothing special... I mean, it's lobster... we were just really in the mood for it. Then, because we really wanted to try it, we had two desserts: a chocolate pot de creme which was perfect but the real star was the buttermilk waffles served with nutella and a marscapone ice cream.

4.0,11/16/2009,"The final stop in my weeklong birthday extravaganza, Almond was the location of the fateful ""Parents, meet new significant other"" dinner. Thankfully all went well.We had reservations via Open Table for 6:45, but showed up early and didn't even really need them. We were seated immediately. It's a big space, (and did get a bit loud later in the night when the bar started to fill up,) but ultimately felt very charming and managed to still feel intimate. Our server was friendly and helpful as well.First we started with a bottle of white which the Fam put me in charge of ordering. God I hate that responsibility, but I think I did fairly well. The wine list is small enough to not be too intimidating and offers both by the glass and bottle suggestions at a reasonable price point. Then on to appetizers. Almond offers a large array, from charcuterie, to a raw bar, to classic french options with a twist. You could really just make a meal of small plates here if you so desired. We went for escargot (because I had been craving it like mad and it was my one birthday demand) and bluefish. The escargot was swimming in butter and garlic just how I like it, and I only wish they'd brought over extra bread for dipping in the excess sauce. Nothing new there, but I didn't want new, I just wanted yummy. Bluefish was salty and had a nice texture. Overall I think both were a success.For meals me and the man friend went for solidarity and both ordered the sea scallops, my mother opted for the flounder, and my dad got the pork chop. The scallops were delightful (hello, duck prosciutto! hello, the best ravioli I've had in AGES!) and thankfully a good portion size. I was a little worried we'd end up with small food. I didn't try the flounder, but my mother declared it wonderful. The pork chop was, I believe, a sleeper favorite. It was HUGE for one thing, and came with amazing grilled brussel sprouts.OK, so since this was a birthday meal we all had to do dessert as well even though we were all pretty full at this point. I got the lemon curd and fig napoleon (rationalization: it was the weirdest option and where else am I going to get that?). BF went for the creme brulee with banana sorbet. Me mum got a trio of sorbets, and pops got a waffle with nutella. You can tell from these names alone that the dessert menu is pretty extensive and interesting. My only complaint about mine was that the candied walnuts didn't seem to go with the dish. All in all, we left with some serious food coma going on.

Wanting to keep it light as I was recovering from an extremely late previous night, I opted for an appetizer and side combo instead of an entree. I went with the escargots and a side of the spinach gnocci. The escargots were too lemony, with the citrus taste overwhelming the dish. The gnocci on the other hand were delicious. For desserts, we had a number of desserts to choose from. We went ahead and ordered the apple crisp, the fig mille feuille, the creme brulee, the pear cake and the chocolat pot de creme. We were expecting a molten chocolate and instead got a cold mousse but that was our fault as we never asked what it was. The creme brulee was delicious as was the pear cake. The apple crisp and the fig mille feuille both looked gorgeous but I was full by then and just enjoyed with my eyes. Decor is great with an upscale yet rustic feel.

I started with the house-smoked bluefish, and it was melt-in-your-mouth moist and delicious. One of our friends doesn't really care for  fish, and even she was impressed with the taste.  I also had a SIdecar Royale, which was very nice. For my main course I chose the veal ragout with house pasta...I normally have a rule against ordering simple pastas in restaurants (don't order what you can cook at home) but I was craving carbs and really like veal so I went for it. The pasta was perfectly al dente, the sauce was beautifully and subtly flavored, and I actually couldn't finish my portion.Such a good price for what you get  - delicious food and friendly and timely service in Manhattan. I loved it.The restaurant itself is very comfortable, they had a full house that night but it was never too loud or crowded - the tables are laid out nicely.",0,0,0,Holly P.,"Hampshire, MA",3,1,0
3.0,9/21/2009,"Fulfills all the ""good brunch"" requirements: no wait, relaxed environment, nice seating, decent prices, good potatoes.Almond has a really nice, airy space with outdoor seating that is perfect for brunch.  I had the Red Flannel Hash and my friend ordered the classic eggs benedict.  My hash was delicious - crispy, buttery potatoes made especially interesting with some fresh chopped beets.  The single egg on top was perfectly poached and topped with some homemade frothy hollandaise.  The ciabatta toast accompanying the dish was excellent but I didn't eat much of it since the hash made me pretty full.  I didn't get to try my friend's eggs benedict which she said was good, but did eat all her excellent roasted potatoes.Service was ordinary.  Our waitress never refilled my coffee cup unless I asked her to and it was always hard to get her attention.  However, when my friend's eggs benedict came out cold, she marched it back to the kitchen and had the chef prepare us a fresh hot plate.  I definitely think that they shouldn't have served us cold eggs in the first place but it was nice that they made us a whole new plate right away.All in all, definitely worth a return visit.  Not having to wait for a table at a brunch place with good food is key in NY!UPDATE: MInus one star for service which I'm now deeming ""substandard"".  Our waitress never gave us the mini biscuits with different spreads and butter.  I had noticed that other tables got them, but we didn't.  #fail.",2,2,2,Sonia C.,"Jupiter, FL",408,864,61

I have been to their other location in East Hampton several times, but up until recently I had never went to their Flatiron/Gramercy location. I met a friend here on Monday night for drinks- didn't eat (though the food smelled delightful). There was a feeling when I sat down at the bar that was very small-town, friendly, and somewhat intimate. The bartender Matt was extremely friendly and introduced himself and provided me with a taste description of all their different beers on tap. Over the course of the night, great music was being played by a DJ, and the bartender was just as attentive as when we had just walked in. I would love this to be my new regular spot. The brushed white wood, soothing candles and inviting atmosphere really hit a soft spot with me. It certainly has that Hampton's feel, without the pretension.",0,0,0,Josh H.,"New York, NY",13,73,0

3.0,8/4/2009,"I live right in the area, a few blocks north, and wanted to try this place on for size as a regular joint. It's got a very comfortable feel with warm dark wood decor, relaxed bistro vibe, and even a back room with overstuffed chairs and a pool table just for patrons to hang out in. Although the atmosphere tries to pull off the casual bistro feel the staff and especially the reception desk don't seem to be on that same page. Several times I've called ahead for a reservation only to be told their all booked up or that there's a sizable wait only to show up to half empty dining room. They seem to be playing games and trying to create the sense of hype and more demand. I'd suggest that they cut the sh*t and just try and be a solid neighborhood restaurant. The menu has seen a decent amount of dishes rotate on and off since starting. It's standard bistro fair, satisfactorily executed if not a little heavy handed in butter and salt at times. All and all I've found the things that walk to taste better than the things that swim having had a few misses in their seafood.

4.0,7/16/2009,"You can make reservations on their website which is a HUGE plus!Anyway, into the details; what an interestingly different atmosphere Almond introduces its customers to. The walls have a bit of a Hampton feel to it with the wood paneling and spackled white-paint walls. The main dining room also has a cozy 'loftish' feeling to it, which I found as a plus. Other tables are a good ways away from your own as well, so you don't have to feel like you're competing with the table next to you in order to converse with your friends.The service as well, considering I went at a fairly busy hour, (7pm) was more than sufficient. They kept my water glasses filled, and made sure I was happy with my meal more than enough times.They also have quite an extensive wine selection, along with delectably delicious nightly specials and a vast array of creative entrees. I ordered the herb crusted flounder with hand crushed potatoes and fresh greens. I couldn't have been more stupefied by its elegant presentation. AND the main courses only took like....15minutes from ordering to come out.I will most certainly attend this restaurant again.

I had the spinach salad with chicken liver and beets, and the liver pate on crostini bread pretty much stole the show, but the chopped red beets were a bit on the soft side, but that's if I have to be totally picky.They had a little mix up with my brunch item and served me pancakes instead of waffles, but the waiter quickly brought my waffle back and it was good so I really couldn't complain. Eat the fruits on the side first though, mines were warm by the time I got to them because the plate was so hot. The whipped cream had a secret ingredient that I'm not sure of, but it was sturdier and had a refreshing flavor to it than typical whipped cream. The nutella spread for the waffle in place of butter was alright.I wish they used a better prosecco or even champagne for the mimosa, it was a bit disappointing after you've tried the real deal at some other places for the same price (like the nice Belgian place on 29th...).The service was nothing that I would rave about, but my waiter proved to be helpful, albeit rushed.

Almond is surprisingly never crowded. The food is  spring/summer-like, some with a touch of fruity flavours.  Portions are a good size for you to have an appetizer and entree, and have to think twice about dessert. My favourite dishes include the roast chicken on a warm salad, garnished with croutons/currants/ pecorino toscana/cioppolinis and the red wine braised short ribs with pomme anna/creme fraiche. Desserts are shareable by 2, and are more unusual than they appear. I ordered the pot du creme thinking that it would just be a pot of chocolate, but I was pleasantly surprised when it was served with a layer of creme fraiche, and topped with salted almonds.

4.0,1/20/2009,"On a freezing saturday afternoon, I was actually really stoked that I was going to be on time getting to this restaurant for brunch with the girls.  Somehow from the evening before and the afternoon when I made a mad dash to look presentable to the outside world, the address for this institution had changed on my guide to all things great - aka YELP.  As I ran out the subway and scrambled towards 5th & 6th avenue which the initial Almond page had said, I realized the address was off and checked my trusty iphone to see if I was indeed losing my mind and was suffering from winter wind brain.  The address had changed to between park and lexington so I made a mad dash back east and managed to make it unscathed by the brutal new york city wind. Sorry if I totally bored you and made you want to gouge your eyes out with my little anecdote, but everything serves a purpose my fellow yelpers.  When we got inside I informed the host what had happened and she kindly apologize which wasn't what I had expected, my informing the good people of this institution was merely to let them be aware to the strange change of address in the last 24 hours.In any case, I will get onto the ambience & food.  This spot is homely and chic at the same time - if you can manage to really say those two adjectives in a sentence.  Moving onto what was ordered.  Here goes my quick down and dirty review.1) Ricotta Pancakes with Lemon Curd AND Fig Jam - Fluffy and warm with a nice combination of either the tart/citrus flavor of the lemon curd or fig jam.  Both were amazing and different kind of like fraternal twins or something of that nature.  The waiter was super amazing and offered to bring out both for us.  So thank you!2) Omelette Of Chorizo, Manchego Cheese & Red Onion - Great combination of bringing the spanish flavor in an omelette. This was good, but unfortunately I couldn't say great.  I'm a cheese-aholic and honestly would have liked to have seen a bit more cheese than what was in this package.  The flavors definitely worked well together, but of course that is to be expected.3) Almond Hash duck confit, roasted onions, potatoes, duck cracklings, poached egg - This dish would have to be the shining beacon of hope (if you can name where I got that line from I will definitely give you a cookie or not...) or rather a slight disappointment both rolled into one.  The duck confit was amazing with the medley of eggs, potatoes, onions and duck cracklings.  But, I would have to say that it was a tad on the salty side.  With American food often times, I would have to say though that the love/hate relationship with sodium can be a hindrance.  This also equate to my love hate with this dish.  The duck was AMAZING, but the saltiness kinda made me sad.All in all, this would have to be the most fun and entertaining experiences.  While we were eating someone decided to sharpen knives so my girls and I naturally turned around and threw our own daggers out of our eyes.  The owner was gracious enough to come over and strike up a conversation that ranged from the yelp address fiasco to the knife grinding to apple iphones and much more.  Finding restaurants with stellar service is pretty rare especially on a moderate price level and you know what.  Even at the nobu's of the world, sometime you get some nasty cats trying to throw food on your table.  But, the waiter and the owner definitely made our experience here one that will go down in history in my book of dining in New York City. Plus, we got to try some dessert and I will have to absolutely positively recommend the waffles with nutella and the lemon tart with huckleberries.  SO GOOD, I'm just sad I couldn't finish it all and had to let it go to waste.  So, if you are in the mood for some laid back, but classy than this is your joint right here.

4.0,1/4/2009,"A friend and I went to Almond last night on a whim after reading Gael Greene's review in NYMag from a couple months ago. The food, service, and atmosphere were all spot-on.We started with the tasting plate of three fruits de mer (~$16)--scallops with fennel, grilled octopus, and curried mussels--presented on a bed of ice with lemon and tabasco on the side. All very good; the scallops were thinly sliced, translucent, and delicately enhanced by the shavings of fennel root. The octopus was nicely chewy but tender on the inside with a nice bit of char. The mussels, daubed with a mild curry, were tender and tasty but suffered a bit from being chilled; I think the curry flavors would have been far more compelling warm.Our server was charming--warm and simultaneously discreet--and recommended an inexpensive bottle from Provence to go with the steaks we ordered for entrees (Gourgonnier something or other, $32). The wine was very good for the price--earthy and spicy, but not too heavy; a modest 12.5% alcohol and silky enough to chase down our steak frites. Which brings me to the steak frites! I got the strip with shallots, marrow, and bordelaise sauce (~$30) and my date the ""wagyu flatiron"" with rochefort crumble (~$22). The strip was flavorful but tender, with a nice animalistic quality enhanced by the creamy bone marrow melting on top. The sauce was not as intense as other bordelaise I've had, but it seeped into the meat nicely and enhanced the flavor. The wagyu was filet-cut, and while less pungently beefy than the strip, offered the most melting tenderness I think I've had in red meat. The fries were great, the wine matched well, and we were very happy.Desserts also good. We had the chocolate pot du creme and the pear cake with brown butter and I believe a red wine sorbet (both were around $7-8). The pear cake was delightful, combining the slightly grainy quality of the pear with a delicate warm cake, into which the sorbet gradually melted. The chocolate cream was fine; the fluffy chocolatey thing you'd expect. I'm not such a fan of chocolate cream but my date liked it. We shared one of the cheaper ports over these, and it was nice--mellow, warm, fruity-- too.We had a seat by the window and the noise level was just right, the lighting was good and overall the space very pleasing. The only fly in the ointment was actually a mouse--indeed, two mice that frolicked around the banquette behind us for most of the evening. Clearly this isn't a ""good"" thing, but the evening was so pleasant that the mice hardly stand out as a strong negative--I mention them only so other readers and the restaurant may be aware.I can say with confidence that we'll be back to Almond, next time to explore more of the menu!",2,0,0,Nick G.,"New York, NY",1,10,0
5.0,11/18/2008,"Been there twice now. First time was soon after opening. Service was shall we say ""green"" at that point - server couldn't even pronounce half the entrees. But the food was really good and I liked the space, so gave it another try last week with a few friends. This time the service seemed professional and the food even better (guessing a lot of their kitchen staff trained at their other restaurant so they were good to go). I'd heard their duck confit was great - and didn't disappoint - very rich. The lardon salad was huge and addictive. Mussels were insanely good (white wine, garlic broth). Veal mil, while not the traditional version was delicious. All the sides we tried were also great - fries (perfect), cauliflower gratin and mac/cheese. Was not too expensive (I think $60 per person with wine). Also, the host/manager was really friendly too - one of my friends mentioned to him that she liked the music and he volunteered to email her the play list!",2,0,0,B K.,"New York, NY",0,6,0
2.0,11/3/2008,"My fiancee and I went the night after opening night. Our experience was pretty terrible. We shared the duck confit appetizer. The meat was really dry. Otherwise it was pretty good, but dry meat pretty much ruins duck confit. I got the macaroni and cheese and my fiancee got the steak frites with skirt steak, ordered medium rare. The steak was completely overcooked, and the fries, I could swear, were not fresh - straight out of a frozen bag of Ore-Ida. I would say I'm 95% positive they were frozen, pre-cut fries, which leads to the obvious question: Why bother putting steak frites on the menu if you're not making fresh fries? The mac and cheese - with prosciutto and black truffles - was lackluster. Again, not positive, but if I were to guess I'd say they used truffle (-flavored) oil to make up for the fact that the truffles weren't very high-quality or fragrant. I suppose a dish like that for $18 is too good to be true.To top it off: the mac and cheese was cold in the middle, and I got a terrible case of food poisoning about 30 minutes after eating there.To remedy the cold macaroni situation, someone who was presumably the manager came over to apologize. He kept calling me ""dude,"" which was really off-putting. I'm 27, but, dude, I have a job and pay for an apartment and can afford to eat out in the city, dude. Would he call my dad 'dude?' I doubt it. That's just a little nit-picky thing, however. On a high note - the service was very good, and our waitress was very pleasant and nice (although she ignored us completely after she ran the card).Would definitely not return.",2,1,1,Evan L.,"Maplewood, NJ",0,13,0
4.0,10/20/2008,"Stopped by to check out Almond, from Bridgehampton, which opened in Borough's new digs.  Just a drink and the raw bar looks amazing.  The staff couldn't be nicer (it is opening day -1), and will update after a full meal!",2,0,1,Craig P.,"New York, NY",37,87,0
