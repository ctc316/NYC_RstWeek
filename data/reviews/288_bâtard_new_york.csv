3.0,4/17/2019,"I was there for a work dinner last week, and am really unimpressed with the portion control - not so much the food.  We had the 4 course tasting menu and I picked the beef tartare, scallops, duck and seasonal sorbet to finish. I think portion control is the biggest issue with this restaurant. They serve WAY too much for each course, by the time I got to the entree i.e duck breast, it was heard to appreciate as I was so FULL from the first 2 courses. Beef Tartare - it was ok. Nothing to rave about.Scallops - It was good i.e. most tasty of the 4 courseDuck - It was good I think but hard to know since it was way too much food.Sorbet - Bland nothing special. The other thing too is that the wine selection could be better. We order 2 under $150 per bottle and the quality was bad for that price. That really dented our overall experience.",0,0,0,Kira S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,9,0

5.0,3/11/2019,"Def one of my fav restaurants!!!Got the pate as my appetizer. Mustard, mayo sauce, celery... Everything on the plate was not only for the decoration but also for a balanced flavor!! You can actually feel how the chef played with each ingredient.It came with a toasted brioche, which was also super tasty.

4.0,3/9/2019,"Nice ambiance, great place for a romantic dinner. All of our dishes were  beautifully plated. The portions were generous and we were full by the time we hit our 3 courses. I also liked how they were not stingy with the bread (sesame sourdough and brioche) and offered more all throughout our meal. Service was excellent with constant refills and  I literally didn't need to ask for anything as they predicted it all and brought all that was needed for you. Our rib eye meal was a bit heavy for my taste with the cheesy pomme puree but I loved the apple cinnamon souffle that we had for dessert! Felt like eating a sweet cloud and the apple cinnamon compote was perfect.",0,0,0,Rosa J.,"Somerset, NJ",0,12,21
5.0,2/25/2019,"Ambiance - I came here on a Monday at around 8pm and the place was full and hearty. There was a constant flow of people throughout the night and the place was filled with talks and laughs. Food - Amazing - for an Michelin guide, this place definitely holds up its place and doesn't beat the wallet. You can choose from 2,3, or 4 courses depending on how you feel. You can choose between ANY thing on their food menu not following the app and entree if you wanted to choose a 2 course. Service- service was friendly and warm. Came here to celebrate an anniversary and we got a warm card greeting! Will definitely come back for more milestones",0,0,0,Amy C.,"Manhattan, NY",114,37,42
3.0,2/23/2019,"Came for Restaurant Week 2019 dinner, which was $42pp for three courses. The ambiance and service were great and the food was well executed (for the most part) classics. I probably wouldn't come back unless it was Restaurant Week.For our starters, we ordered the Pate Grandmere (cremini mushrooms, celery, brioche) and Ora King Salmon Tartare (forbidden rice, sesame, shiso). The pate wasn't really fatty enough for our personal taste. The tartare was extremely fresh - I have a really sensitive palette when it comes to raw fish.For our entrees, we both got the Tagliatelle (berkshire pork ragu). The pasta was well executed - flavorful without being too watery.For our dessert, we ordered the Paris Brest (lemon meringue, creme fraiche ice cream) and Warm Chocolate Fondant (vanilla bean ice cream). The fondant was delicious. My friend liked his Paris Brest as well.",1,0,1,Judy S.,"New York, NY",322,1183,1192
5.0,2/23/2019,"*4.5/5 stars, but rounding to 5 for the quality of food.* Bâtard has been high on our hit list for quite some time. We came with a party of 4 on a Saturday night. The Food: 5/5. We ordered a cheese plate for the table to share (3 for $18), and were given a 4th complimentary cheese to try. The variety of cheese was perfectly balanced and surprisingly very filling. For mains, Qia and I shared the farfalle with short rib ragu, branzino, agnolotti with braised oxtail, and lamb chops. Every single dish was superb and beautifully plated.The Drinks: 4/5. We had the Ol' Dirty Bâtard ($16) and the Spanish Gin & Tonic ($19). Boozy and interesting, but we still felt they were lacking a special ""oomph"" for the price point. The glass for the Spanish Gin & Tonic was awkward and clunky making it difficult to drink.The Service: 4/5. The service seemed a little slow in the beginning, but was pretty good overall. For a Michelin star restaurant in Tribeca, the price point of the food is really hard to beat. Portions are also sizable for French food. The ambiance is casual and unpretentious, yet elegant. We will definitely be coming here again!",0,0,0,Kezia Q.,"New York, NY",137,30,64
5.0,2/21/2019,There was a three course special with recommended wine pairings. It was an intimate environment. I enjoyed trying new food! The farfalle with Brussels was to die for!

5.0,2/19/2019,"I thought this place was going to be stuffy and fussy, but it was actually the opposite - it was clear that someone in charge really wanted us to have a good time.  I loved the menu coursing system - rather than having to order an appetizer, main and dessert, I was free to build my own meal.  I had an appetizer, entree and...cheese!!!  My BF had three apps and a main.  The waitstaff was young and attentive.  The room, on a Monday night, was lively, but not too loud, as others mentioned, although I imagine the noise level would rise on the weekend.  The food was nothing short of incredible.  Every last thing that went in my mouth - from the beautiful bread, to the gratis tarts that arrived with the check-- was thoughtful, playful, delicious.  In a city full of mediocre food, it was pleasant to see someone working so hard in the kitchen, and making such good food so accessible.  I can't wait to come back and order everything else on the menu.",0,0,0,Jessica D.,"New York, NY",4,158,0
4.0,2/12/2019,"I dined here for resto week and was treated to outstanding service. Though it was a bit confusing to which one was our server because 3 people waited on us, nevertheless we were attended to with care. The decor was modern with a warm and cozy ambience. My dining friend and I both had Glühwein, a warm drink for a chilly winter day, just perfect. For starters, I had the salmon tartare and every bite was decadent and delicious, a must try. My main dish was the farfalle which was exquisite, but the portion was tiny.  I had a taste of my friend's brazino dish, AMAZING! Of course I had dish remorse, but I still enjoyed my pasta but wanted a little bit more.  We both ordered the same dessert, chocolate fondant, rich in chocolate. I did want the fondant to be a bit warmer, but delicious nevertheless.  As other yelpers mentioned, they were open tables and yet tables were not available on Open Table. My friend thinks they don't have the staff for max capacity. I was lucky enough to snag the 8pm reservation because I was checking on Open Table frequently for availability.  Overall, top notch dining experience and a lovely dinner for a Monday.",0,0,0,Sonia Mae B.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",145,90,196
4.0,2/11/2019,"4.5 stars. Everything about the food was phenomenal. For appetizers we tried the salmon tartar and butternut squash soup, entrees the fish and the pork, and both the chocolate and lemon desserts. We also got cocktails (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic). My favorite thing all night was the soup we had as an appetizer. It was presented very well and the flavors were really unique.The ambiance is beautiful, simple, and elegant (but not over the top). The restaurant is small enough to not be overwhelming and large enough to not feel cramped. Overall service was very good.The only thing that was a bit annoying was I had to ask for coffee twice at the end of our meal and I never ended up getting it. It was a bit awkward but I really wanted it while I had my dessert.",2,1,2,Michael C.,"New York, NY",278,190,137

5.0,2/5/2019,We came here for restaurant week and can not recommend it enough. Service from beginning to end was impeccable. Every dish we had was better than the last and do NOT skip dessert.

4.0,1/30/2019,"A refined yet understated dining experience in TriBeCa. Overall: 4.5/5Value: 5/5 (restaurant week) Food: 4.5/5Service: 4/5 Decor: 4.5/5A Michelin Star establishment, yet the vibe isn't overly pretentious. In fact, the exterior is quite understated, just a small restaurant front outfitted in muted colors. Decor is beautiful, with gold walls and beautiful lighting, although one complaint is the tables are quite small (and same size for 4 and 2 person parties) and require some jostling with the large plates with bigger parties. The food is quite excellent - I had the butternut squash soup, branzino, and chocolate fondant. The butternut squash soup was deliciously creamy which was offset by the slight tangy taste from the beets. The branzino was a generous size and perfectly pan seared, set on a bed of finely chopped greens. The chocolate fondant was a tad disappointing, although very rich, I wish it were a bit more warm. The ice cream was great though, very fresh and sweet. The only slight complaint I have service wise, which was generally quite attentive, is about the reservation process. From the opentable availability one would think it is utterly impossible to book especially during restaurant week - I had to check regularly for a while before managing to snag a spot. I even called and asked and she said they were fully booked for all the dates I inquired about. Well when we went at 5:45pm, the restaurant was barely 1/4 full, and by the time we left, perhaps more like 1/2 full. Not sure if they just don't fill up entirely as policy but I don't see why they don't offer more reservation slots - makes booking a little frustrating, especially when you snag fairly suboptimal times expecting it to be because they're completely full of patrons when they aren't really. Was about to resort to the 9:30pm slot which is so late until that 5:45pm reservation opened up and I'm glad we did not deign to go that late. Anyway still good experience and would recommend.",1,0,0,Kris Y.,"Boston, MA",10,123,195
4.0,1/29/2019,"This place is delightful, elegant, romantic, and has attentive service. Food: I appreciated the menu even if we were only there for restaurant week. I enjoyed the branzino and salmon starter, plus the rich fondant dessert. We did think the meat paste entree was small but still flavorful.Drinks: The Glühwein really worked to warm us up. These were served in cute glasses but I wanted a bigger pour.",2,0,1,Urszula P.,"Manhattan, NY",72,188,598
5.0,1/26/2019,"batard has been on my list for a while so we had to try it this winter RW! The RW menu is decent with some signature dishes. I very much enjoyed the salmon tartare and the branzino, I really love fish... But I feel like the salmon is very rich that it's difficult for any entree to come after it, anyways it's still delicious. The branzino is cooked perfectly, the skin is incredibly crispy. My bf had the pate and the Amish chicken. The pate is not bad but I feel like the texture is somehow not quite there, however it's a lighter choice than salmon. The Amish chicken is indeed amazing, the most tender I've ever had! I never order chicken at a nice restaurant (still i didn't this time) because it's such a boring meat, but will I come back pay full price for that chicken? It's possible... For dessert, we had the Paris Brest (perfect) and the chocolate fondant (so so), should have gotten the sorbet... All dishes are presented beautifully and came promptly (maybe a little too quickly? we finished our dinner in one hour and I had two glasses of wine)Overall it's definitely a worth-try if you wanna sample this starred restaurant without breaking the bank. One side note is that I do feel there are way too many staff on the floor (unnecessary but very common in the US somehow), at some point they are moving a plant around...",0,0,0,Chloe L.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,69,0
5.0,1/24/2019,"Went for NYC restaurant week. Great service, indoor decor and fantastic food.Had the butternut squash soup and branzino with the wine pairings. Both were fabulous. The sauces in the branzino were great and the soup had a lot of depth. I tried my friend's pate--which was probably the best I've ever had. Got the chocolate fondant which was also good but nothing out of this world",0,0,1,Jessica T.,"New York, NY",19,43,92

4.0,1/22/2019,"We came here for restaurant week dinner and had a reservation at 6PM. We came in with very high expectations after hearing lots of great things about the restaurant. It was already bustling with people but the ambience was nice and it wasn't too loud or crowded. This is a place you should dress business casual to for sure. There's a coat and bag check by the door.At our table, we were served water and bread but no butter, which we had to ask for individually. The drinks were good but nothing spectacular or particularly memorable (the specialty spritz with the restaurant week menu was mostly ice).The actual meal was quite good. I had the following:First Course - Butternut Squash Soup: Delicious. By far my favorite part of the meal. Not too savory and just sweet enough. They even pour the soup for you at your table so the centerpiece of red cabbage and pumpkin seeds stays intact.Second Course - Farfalle: Good but a little too salty. Very filling and not too creamy. The portion size was also great. There's a decent amount of pork in this, which was a pleasant surprise!Side - Grilled Broccoli Rabe: Fan favorite at the table. Since the farfalle was too salty, this was a great addition to the meal. I don't know how they did it but they made regular vegetables taste heavenly. Highly recommend.Dessert - Warm Chocolate Fondant: A little overcooked and not as satisfying as I had expected it to be after a relatively salty meal. The ice cream was nice but the actual fondant wasn't impressive.For restaurant week, I think this restaurant is a pretty solid pick. I'd also definitely come back for a regular meal given the nice ambience and overall service. The food was a little lacking but I'll chalk that up to restaurant week overproduction.",0,0,0,Elizabeth L.,"New York, NY",19,99,237
5.0,1/21/2019,The soufflé is a MUST HAVE! It's the best soufflé I've ever had! It's plenty to share with 4 people. It's light and airy with just the perfect amount of sweetness. All of their dishes were delicious. I didn't taste a dish I didn't like. We had no leftovers. You can choose a 3 or 4 course. The duck breast was tender and cooked to perfection.The sea bass and branzini was fresh.Kudos to the pastry chef! I would come back just to have the soufflé for 2 all to myself. Those passion fruit pastry bites were just enough tartness to cleanse the palette.,0,0,0,Mickey C.,"Belmont, MA",7,60,332
3.0,1/13/2019,"We came here for restaurant week, with a pretty late reservation (9:15). The meal started off great- the complimentary bread was fantastic and we polished it off quite quickly. Our waiter came by and asked if we wanted more, to which we enthusiastically agreed. However, he never came back with more bread. We flagged down a different waiter who also promised more bread but still no bread. It happened a few more times throughout the meal but we eventually gave up.For the appetizer, I got the burrata with grilled stone fruit, which was very refreshing. Our table all got the chicken sausage for the entree, which was extremely salty. We felt so full not from the meal but from all the water we had to drink.However the dessert redeemed the meal. The pate a choux with blueberry compote was delicious and not too sweet. The sorbet trio was light and perfect. However the chocolate pot de creme was a little too  heavy especially after downing the chicken sausage.",1,0,0,Vicky R.,"New York, NY",331,62,241
4.0,1/6/2019,"The restaurant decor, feel and service was exquisite, warm and inviting. We started off dinner with cocktails from the drink menu and it definitely did not disappoint. The appetizers we had and the entrees were outstanding- the lobster tortellini was out of this world. I would like to share though that the dessert, the apple soufflé was incredibly sweet, after the initial bite we didn't touch it. The soufflé is more like a soft egg white merengue on top of an apple compote that is also very sweet. Overall good food, but the dessert menu could be retouched a bit.",0,0,0,Jake B.,"East Rockland Key, FL",0,7,0

I had ordered the duck breast and they all had a few bites. In hindsight the duck breast appeared on the rarer side. If the possibility of food poisoning does not deter you, the food was altogether unremarkable and uninspired.

5.0,12/22/2018,"A lovely Tribeca location, a golden jewel of a dining room - intimate and refined.  The restaurant offers a choice of 2, 3 , or 4 courses.  We opted for 4 courses to share - the beet salad (fantastic), the pasta with egg and truffles (so luscious), the Branzini (I never order fish and I loved this dish) and the pear galette with ginger ice-cream (we have a pear tree and made ginger ice-cream last year, every bit as good as our own organic product).  The service was flawless, perhaps the best I have ever had.

5.0,12/19/2018,"From beautiful plating, to incredible food, all with consistent attentive service throughout, Batard provided us with a memorable experience with dishes that we'll be dreaming about for awhile. In short, get the Hamachi, the Truffle Spaghetti, and the Duck Breast!We made a reservation for 6:15 PM on a Wednesday night (OpenTable bonus for this super early reservation). There were only a handful of other diners when we were seated. Our server was very helpful in suggesting wines and also explaining how to order off their menu. You and your dining partners do not have to choose the same number of courses, and your courses just have to include at least 1 entree, but other than that, can be a combination of whatever courses you want (e.g. for a 3 course: 2 appetizers and 1 entree, or 1 entree and 2 desserts; for a 4 course: 2 entrees and 2 appetizers, etc). I absolutely loved the Hamachi appetizer, which is a raw white fish (very savory) in a citrus sauce with thinly sliced pickled kohlrabi. It was a beautiful blend of umami with acid. The Venison & Foie Gras Terrine appetizer was not as exciting as I hoped it would be. I expected a softer pate but as a terrine, it was more of a harder block (think cheddar instead of brie). The shiitake mushrooms were folded into the terrine itself. Loved the fig jam/sauce that was a part of the dish.Ooooh the Black Truffle Spaghetti was incredible. We split the dish and it was the perfect amount because the flavor was so dense and heavy. It's quite saucy in a cream tuffel with ACTUAL truffle shavings!! That was such a treat, since it was our first time having truffle shavings. The poached egg didn't add too much to it, since the truffle cream already made the dish so flavorful. We really savored this dish. Definitely worth the additional $45 on top of the prix fixe price. The Duck Breast entree was incredible- undercooked perfectly and so tender. The pears paired perfectly and we couldn't get enough of it. The Black Sea Bass dish was unfortunately quite underwhelming. It wasn't very creative, I wish the skin would've been crispy instead of like mushy fish skin. The brussels sprouts and turnips were delicious and I wish there was more of both. The dish also comes with caviar, and it was my first time having caviar. I figured this would be the time and place because I can trust the quality. I've decided caviar is not for me. So in general, this dish was not worth the additional $12. The Brown Butter Cheesecake was delicious for us Cheesecake lovers. I really enjoyed how the sweet potato ice cream complemented the cheesecake and was pleasantly baffled at how they made the toasted brioche, which looked like a super thin glazed wonton peel bunched up in a really artsy way. Delicious.We had a wonderful wonderful time. My only complain is while our appetizers came out pretty quickly, we waited almost an hour, it seems, for our entrees to come out after our appetizers. But in general, what an excellent meal! Oh, and complimentary macarons at the very end!",0,0,1,Rosa C.,"New York, NY",85,320,122
5.0,12/17/2018,"Almost ever since I settled down in New York about 4 years ago, Batard has been one of my favorite spots in the city. It's like home where I would bring friends to share the great food and special occasions.I'm very sad that I have to leave New York to explore new opportunities. I will be missing this place a lot.Today I ordered the hot buttered rum (one of their holiday hot cocktails), which I really loved. It warmed my body from walking in the cold and windy weather almost immediately. It's also perfectly sweet (the right amount of sweetness I was looking for combining with the rum). For the 4-course meal I had today, I chose carrot soup, roasted quail, branzino, and pear galette. I am so full now that I couldn't stand up but I'm so happy and feel so loved by the warm hospitality and tasty food. I don't want to elaborate on how umami and comforting the food is coz I think sometimes words can't really describe it. I'm pretty sure you will understand how happy I am feeling right now once you dine here.Don't be afraid to try everything here, you will never go wrong choosing anything from the menu.I will miss this place and will definitely come back to visit when I'm back in New York.:) thank you Batard.",0,0,0,CL D.,"New York, NY",26,6,72
5.0,12/2/2018,"We went to Bâtard because they have a no corkage policy (one bottle per couple) on Monday nights, and we had a 1988 Dom to open up. The meal itself was impeccable, from a rich venison/foie gras terrine to the best soufflé I've ever had in my life. If you bring a white wine, especially a champagne, definitely opt to pay a tiny bit more for that beautiful lobster tagliatelle. The other must have item on their menu is the soufflé for two. It is hands down one of the fluffiest soufflés I've ever had (I have had my fair share of them throughout France and in the US) and has what I call buried treasure inside (cinnamon apple compote). The service was great, and our sommelier also recommended a wonderful red wine to pair with the duck entree my husband ordered.

The second time, we stumbled in after after a football game: ""the oldest high school rivalry in America."" Everyone says that, though. Especially, at Tribeca tap house. But, what everyone hasn't done, is.. try duck before. Shocked. To me, duck is magical. Batard does duck. So, I wanted to share the magic. We managed to score two seats at the bar despite losing the football game. Naturally, you pre-game duck -- with quail. And so we did. And it was delicious. The lobster tagliatelle couldn't hurt, either. The bartender did a fantastic job at highlighting each dish. In the end, it as the souffle that ruled them all.

Food was okay but not worth the price tag unfortunately. I had the sea bass for entree and a part of the fish was still a bit raw and rubbery. My friend had the steak and it was okay- I feel like something you can get for 30ish. Also the service is spotty. Our server was nice but between app and entree there was a 40 min gap, we finished our app rather quickly and honestly waited for a while for entree to come. I understand some guests might take a while to eat and talk, but for those that eats fairly fast, checking on your guest and bring them their next course would be nice. Food is okay, but just not worth the additional price tag. Like bad I paid 150 between the two of us and received the food and service I had that night I'd be okay.

4.0,10/18/2018,"I never really thought I'd end up at Batard. It's been on my radar for a few years, but it's out of the way and it seems like the type of place for people with a certain type of prestige or affectation. We ended up here because we were somewhat desperate, a strange and uncomfortably privileged thing to say about a Michelin-starred restaurant. Despite my suspicions about the ambiance being pretty right-on, our experience was pleasant overall; the food as good as advertised. Some have complained about the price, but I think it's fair. Other restaurants of this caliber can be far more expensive, though I must admit I haven't been to that many. Service is top-notch, the food is all executed perfectly, subtle flavor profiles and seasonal ingredients. That said, Yelp should probably include an ""50 and 60-somethings frequent this place"" and they do for younger folks because places like Batard exist. So this night was a whirlwind. For starters, it was my birthday. Let's just say the original plans for the night didn't unfold as expected, so we needed to pull the emergency valve. For once I was glad that my birthday was mid-week, because last-minute reservations are far easier to come by in this case. Treading water, I furiously scrolled Resy (we were already pushing 8:30pm at this point) and found Batard. We hopped in a cab and that was that. Now all we could do was pray.The only thing that skeeves me out about Batard is the ""decor"". Some reviewers spoke to this, and they weren't wrong. It felt like a grandmother's living room. Or, well, a nursing home's common area. My grandmother's living room was a lot cozier than this. Strange patterning on the walls, a large dining space, certainly ""nice"" but without any design elements lending themselves to this adjective. Little to no music--at some point I heard a few faints notes in the background--likely classical--which was somehow worse. Between the yellow-ish wallpaper and buttoned-up servers, I definitely felt I was out of place. But hey, once we got to consuming the goodies, that mattered far less to me. Surprisingly, the wines by-the-glass here are cheaper than most of the cocktails. For whatever reason all by-the-glass wines are also all French, sans one Riesling that was on there just because. To start, we each got a cocktail: I the Gin Watson (Greenhook gin, ginger liquor, orange blossom), he the Jungle Bird (cruzan black strap rum, campari, pineapple). My drink was a whopping $21 (happy birthday to me?) and not worth that much but still *very* good (I liked it better than the latter). And all wines checked their boxes.Food-wise, Batard has a great setup. Options for two, three or four courses, and you can choose what sections you'd like to pick from. So, for example, we chose three courses an opted out of dessert, while you could just as easily skip one of the savory courses if you sweet tooth needs satisfying. Not all of the offerings are up online, but I'll do my best to describe (the pics should help). Eats, below:Beets done three ways w/ ricotta: A-The least impressive of the night but still a great appetizer. All three ways were delightful, and the ricotta was delicious and a necessary component. A colorful, amuse bouche-type dish.Hamachi (raw): AImpeccably fresh, delicate flavors--a perfect starter. Sadly this isn't up on the online menu, otherwise I'd rave about the accompaniments too. A nice fluffy crispy served atop the fish added some nice textural variety, while the sauce on the side added an extra punch of flavor. Simple but beautifully executed.Octopus w/ gem lettuce, almonds, olives, red pepper: ADelicious, Mediterranean f(l)are. The octopus was well-cooked and paired wonderfully with the red pepper sauce. The gem lettuce was served charred, flavored well (for lettuce). Another well-balanced plate.Roasted Quail: A+This is where they started upping the ante. Served with crispy kale, warm sweet potato rounds, some type of sauce that blew me away and grilled onions. The quail was decadent and cooked perfectly. All of the flavors here blended together harmoniously and it all felt very autumnal. Even the colors. A gorgeous dish in all ways. Duck Breast w/ roasted plums, quinoa, summer squash, fois gras: AAnother plate where each component served its purpose valiantly. Sweet flavors always go well with duck and I'm not sure I've ever seen roasted plums used before--a delightful addition. Quinoa is often boring, yet this particular quinoa was delicious on its own. Seriously. That crisp really does wonders. I let the bf have the lone piece of fois gras, but his facial expression of pure ecstasy during consumption is a worthy piece of evidence.Halibut w/ eggplant, sweet corn, chantarelles, chile: ANot sure why this warranted an addition $8, but it still was quite tasty. Fresh, flavorful, loved the delicate use of corn and mushrooms. Seasoning, preparation, concept on point. And special thanks for the lil bday scoop of vanilla!",7,3,6,Molly T.,"New York, NY",887,463,1480
5.0,10/10/2018,"Batard is easily one of the top 10 dining experiences I have ever had in my life.  The outstanding food was complemented by exquisite design and top-notch service - everything you would expect and more for a restaurant with a Michelin star. My husband surprised me with a dinner at Batard to celebrate my last day of work.  I had no idea where we were going to celebrate until we showed up at Batard's quaint exterior in Tribeca, and upon entering the restaurant I knew this was going to be an experience unlike any other. The restaurant decor is modern, yet minimalistic and artistic. All very upscale, but not stuffy at all (i.e. no white table cloths, but gorgeous artistic chandeliers). Batard offers tasting menus of 2 courses for $59, 3 courses for $79, and 4 courses for $95.  The dinner menu is divided into a few different sections - starters, mains, desserts - and you can choose your 3 courses across any of these categories (i.e. you could have 3 mains if you wanted to!). We each selected the 3 course tasting menu. To start, we were overwhelmed by the amount of Burgundy wines Batard offers - easily hundreds! They have some great selections by the glass as well. We were given some fresh sliced bread and a roll with some amazing salted butter.  I tried not to fill up on the bread but it was hard because it was so delicious! For our real starters we had a Burrata appetizer and a fresh Beets appetizer.  Both were outstanding.  The beets were perfectly plated and so fresh we were convinced that they were picked from a farm earlier that day. We also had a pasta dish to start which were Ricotta and Pumpkin (I think!) raviolis in a delicious light cream sauce. For my main I ordered the Duck Breast.  This is the first time I have EVER ordered duck for myself at a restaurant, but I had a feeling it was going to be absolutely delicious here. And I was right.  The duck was perfectly seasoned and seared - extremely flavorful and melted in my mouth.  It will be hard to find duck prepared this good again.  My husband ordered the fish, but as I do not eat seafood I did not indulge. We selected the Poached Peaches for dessert.  It was good, but not outstanding like the rest of the meal.  But we still ate it all.  It was our surprise that the host came over to give us ANOTHER dessert on the house. I believe it was the Manjari Chocolate Tart with toasted meringue and espresso.  To die for.  This surprise and delight really put the experience over the top. Cannot say enough nice things about this amazing experience.

We ordered cocktails and sadly my wife's did not arrive when mine did and it took a while before we could get our waiters attention. We chose the three course menu and started with the ravioli & the seared foie gras. Both were outstanding. We were also treated to a beautiful pate with our appetizers which was delicious. For our main courses we had the black sea bass and the duck breast. The bass was prepared perfectly as was the duck breast. The duck breast was accompanied by foie gras & sour cherry preserves, perfect! I ordered a glass of Rose with dinner but, again, the waiter had to be reminded and it was sadly delivered mid way through our main courses. The desserts were great!

5.0,8/18/2018,"Can't ask for much better when it comes to restaurant week dinners. The Michelin star is well-deserved as every single dish was top notch and service excellent as well. They even offered half glass wine pairings for the app and main for $6 each! I didn't love the red wine with the fish and would have just gotten a full glass of the white but that was the only slight low point of the meal.I had the mushroom and cauliflower starter, which was delicate and beautifully plated. Crispy trout was absolutely delish and the accompanying elements completed the dish nicely (except for the red puree, but just my taste), and the pâte à choux was exceptional. Loved the little touches like the macarons served on a bed of chopped almonds with the check.Wheelchair access: there are three steps out front. However, the restaurant has a portable ramp.

4.0,8/14/2018,Had pretty mixed thoughts coming here based on some previous reviews. I thought the food was phenomenal. I even had two pieces of their bread. Came here for restaurant week summer 2018. The dishes:First course-Mushroom and cauliflower: really earthy and beautifully plated. Salmon rilette: yummy and fresh. However I did have big piece of salmon bone in my dish. Yikes. Second course-Chicken sausage: very flavorful and juicy! The beans were cooked well and not mushy at all. Really packs a punch. Great if you're looking for a hearty dish. Farfelle: really delicate home made pasta. I enjoyed it and thought the ingredients were super fresh. I love a good mushroom light creme sauce Third course-Chocolate creme: very indulgent dishPate de choux: I usually don't like this dish but thought it was prepared rly well! Great texture and level of sweetness. At the end you also get small salted macaroons for person. Super sweet but macaroons usually are. Loved it. Came with the bill. I thought tbe service was ok. Everyone came off a little too high brow. We also waited a while before we got our menus and the bread came with the first course but these are nit picky items. Food was great!

The mushroom & cauliflower (first course) and the chicken (main course) were too salty and the chocolate pot de creme I ordered for dessert was too sweet to eat...One more thing that left me bad impression about this place was that their restroom was so dirty and messy, probably the worst I've ever seen among all the fine dinning restaurants I've been to.",0,0,0,Fei Z.,"Englewood Cliffs, NJ",59,3,0

The butter was very smooth and creamy. Quite excellent. The mushroom and cauliflower dish was confusing. It was a row of veggies on the side of a plate. The cauliflower was under-executed. The mushrooms were ok, but not particularly flavorful. There wasn't much of a unifying sauce or flavor. This felt like a side dish that needed something else. The crispy trout was good. The crisp on the skin was very robust and pleasant. The flesh of the trout, however, did maintain a slightly too toothy and dry mouthfeel. I also found the accompanying veggies to be undercooked. And the sauce was kind of similar to tomato paste. The Pate a Choux was dry and lacked almost any flavor. I was dissappointed.",4,1,1,Jack M.,"West Chester, PA",517,806,672

3.0,7/30/2018,"This review was for summer 2018 restaurant week.For the first course, we had the mushroom and cauliflower appetizer, as well as salmon rillettes. This was probably the best course, and unfortunately the only course we felt Michelin-worthy. The mushroom and cauliflower was creative - bright yet rich and flavorful. The rillettes were a little less exciting, but no less delicious. This was a great start and we were looking forward to the rest of the courses.The entrees were a disappointment. In fact, the farfalle was such a disappointment that it spurred me to write this review, so let's start with that one.The farfalle was listed as coming in a shiitake cream with wild mushrooms and asparagus. Mushrooms, cream, asparagus, pasta - sounds like it would be pretty rich and flavorful, right? Nope. The creme was bland and lacked flavor and salt, and I don't actually remember much about the mushrooms, given how few there were in the bowl. Meanwhile the asparagus came in giant undercooked and undersalted half-spears. Combined with al dente farfalle and a flavorless sauce, this made finishing the dish a slog. The brook trout was crispy and tender, and when we did get the trout, the sauce, and the olive all in one bite it was delicious. However, our trout was inadequately sauced - only a couple of flecks here and there. Maybe they rushed our plate? This dish could have been great, but instead it was just good.We had all 3 sides offered. The fingerling potatoes were really good - crispy, even crunchy, and flavorful. The squash and the broccoli rabe were decent but not particularly noteworthy.The desserts were okay. We had the pate a choux and the chocolate pot de creme.All in all, it was... an okay dining experience. I can see the potential, but the farfalle was just way too bad to overlook at a restaurant of this caliber.",2,0,0,Mike L.,"Chadds Ford, PA",322,64,1

5.0,7/29/2018,"My bf and I came here on our first date. We've been coming to this restaurant ever since. I love the romantic vibe with lights dimmed, fresh flowers and candles at every table. It's consistently been a great experience. What I love the most is that the menu changes based on the season. FYI, this is one of the signs of a really good restaurant. The service was impeccable! Before my glass of water was empty the waiter fills without even asking. There are multiple waiters on hand checking in at each table- not in an overbearing way. In addition, there's a sommelier to help pick the right notes of wine you desire. My bf and I started with tuna tartare and tomatoes with burrata. The tuna was so fresh and had such unique flavors to compliment- citrus from dressing /crunch from seeds/ buttery texture from tuna. The burrata was so delicate in which it was spread over their signature bread with heirloom tomatoes and peaches. It tasted unreal! After, we shared their homemade pasta dishes. Corn was a unique ingredient that was in both dishes. The tagliatelle was made with corn and mushrooms. The tortellini was stuffed with spicy lamb meat and had a sweet corn sauce underneath. Since corn is a seasonal vegetable during the summer in NYC it seems as if Bâtard mastered incorporating this ingredient. Lastly, we ordered their signature duck dish which is the only dish that's been on the menu since Bâtard opened. I usually don't order duck, but the way the chefs cooked and seasoned this meat with different types of onions makes duck my go to meat. (I hope other restaurants can pull their weight!) As a second main course, we ordered the Black Sea bass which was very delicate and had the perfect amount of seasoning. I would recommend ordering their 3 course on their menu.

Bread and butter: SIMPLY amazing authentic french quality bread and butterBurrata: it wasn't actually burrata; this was some smeared burrata on a hard toast with cherry tomatoes with one slice of roasted peach. Overall tasteless - may be better for someone who was not expecting burrata.Cheese plate: there were two soft cheeses and one hard cheese on the $12 supplemental cheese plate; both soft cheeses seemed unappealing and the taste matched their sad appearance. Upon informing our waiter that we did not like the cheese, he did however, bring up another slice of hard cheese. Also... they forgot to bring our cheese plate at first but made up for it by giving us a free half glass of wine.

4.0,7/23/2018,"The food review is for summer 2018 restaurant week. Cauliflower and mushroom appetizer was delightfully tasty and looked beautiful. Trout was crispy, the chopped olive from Spain saved the dish. Side of squash was as ordinary as a vege side from any healthy-ish fast food chain like Dig Inn or The Little Beet (I actually love The Little Beet's baked acorn squash more that only costs less than half of the price...). The big disappointment was the desert: elegant presentation but awfully sweet and monotone. White Chocolate on top of chocolate moose with some weird white cream. Roasted cashew tried in vain to bring some salty balance. I should have ordered cheese platter instead of any dessert. Bartender was very friendly and her Summer Spritz was so refreshing. Service was too slow. I arrived on time for my reservation half an hour after they opened for diner but had to wait for 15 minutes to get seated at the bar.

We did 3 courses, which was $72, plus a cheese course instead of dessert for another $15. Of course, we then each had to pick dishes with up charges (foie gras, lobster), and the $21 cocktail, plus wine, so by the time we left, the bill exceeded $300, so no: it's not a cheap meal.

I asked the somme for a decent bottle of red for $150 and he told me that there were sparse pickings in that price range. That is absurd and to me demonstrates a lack of knowledge of wines, unless your purpose in life is to rip off customers. I don't care if you can get a flight of La Tache or a range of bottles of Haut Brion for $900 a bottle plus. That's not my thing.

3.0,5/5/2018,"SERVICEThree Stars for this.I am in the service industry as well. And I know that whoever comes first must be served first regardless of who and whatever the circumstances are unless of course it's customers requiring special accommodations. The night I came I was the first person to get in the door and the host even saw me waiting at the door minutes before opening. Yet when I came in the host passed me over and assisted other guests who obviously came later. Maybe I was short, maybe I was darker, or maybe because I was alone then. I wouldn't know because I wasn't given a reason by the host. Dining is an experience and right at the door, it turned sour.Also when we were dining and it finally got busy, we have to tell servers many times before they remembered we asked for something. They apologized, of course, but you just don't expect this kind of service in a ONE-Star Michelin restaurant. It wasn't like this in the other times I was here. That night I was deeply disappointed as this was even among my favorite places that I frequently recommend to friends. CONCLUSIONFood is great as usual though. I just don't feel like I want to go back to Batard again nor would I recommend this to other Yelpers ESPECIALLY IF they are looking for an EXEMPLARY experience of Michelin Star dining.

4.0,3/4/2018,"Batard is an unassuming gem, tucked away on a quiet street in TriBeCa, that packs a serious punch. After a couple of positive experiences, we returned for another dinner service. If anything, it seems Batard is on top of its game more than ever. Chef Glocker really deserves more air time for his well balanced, and perfectly executed food. What's more, it's a crazy value at $79 for three courses. Appreciate that you can enjoy his craft in a more relaxed, yet still upscale, environment. It's not stuffy or pretentious. Wine list has an extensive collection of French crus worth exploring. Totally warrants the Michelin star.Atmosphere- Simplistic decor, but quality finishes. Feels high end, not overly imposing or formal.- Takes on a buzzy vibe during dinner service. Active but not too loud.FoodChef Markus Glocker has devised a menu that is seasonal and interesting, delivered in a genuine way without falling into the trap of overworked fussiness. Dishes are clear in concept and beautifully presented. This paves the way for a focus on execution, with the results being perfectly cooked and seasoned dishes. This was our third visit, and each time the food has been superb, very reliable. We loved the:- Seared Foie Gras (duck confit, red currant, pear chutney -$15/supl.): Excellent sear, pear chutney a nice compliment.- Garganelli (lamb shank ragu, butternut squash, crispy bacon, pine nuts): Deep flavors, didn't want to stop eating. Rich and comforting, but in just the right way.- Striped Bass (pomme puree, wild mushrooms, civet sauce): Fish cooked very nicely, crisp skin, wish for some more interesting components than pomme puree.- Smoked Duck Breast (roasted sunchoke, foie gras, persimmon, five spice jus): Amazing! One of the best duck dishes we've ever had. Perfectly cooked and excellent balance of flavors.- Batard Souffle for Two (pomegranate-rose consume, vanilla bean ice cream): Looks intimidating, but so light! Loved the ice cream.      BeverageBegan with a martini, well made as usual, while my wife enjoyed a glass of the Val de Mer Brut Rose NV ($15). With dinner, the 2010 Bertagna 'Les Plantes' from Chambolle-Musigny ($180) was excellent, and priced at a very reasonable markup for a premier cru. The wine list includes an expansive selection of burgundies, with good options at many different price points. Our wine was served perhaps a touch warmer than ideal temp, and think they could do a little more in terms of presentation (wine coaster, or something), but none of this detracted too much. With dessert, you cannot go wrong selecting the 2009 Castelnau de Suduiraut Sauternes ($14).Service- Always friendly, no snobbish attitude, though not particularly remarkable.- Clumsy at times, but more or less just nits like bringing dessert menu before we even had main course, bringing wine before we could order cocktails, etc.",1,0,0,D.

5.0,2/18/2018,"Came here for a 5pm dinner with my husband on a Saturday. We were greeted by the staff immediately. We checked our coats in and got seated at a couch area. It has a very cozy and warm ambiance overall with pretty chandeliers which could be a perfect place for occasions and dates :). The menu had two courses, three courses, and four courses; we ended up ordering three courses and a cheese plate. Attached is the photo of menu, but it may change time to time.We were served with complimentary sourdough bread and brioche. I got octopus pastrami for appetizer, duck breast for entree, and the Paris Brest for dessert. My husband ordered garganelli for appetizer, Niman ranch dry aged striploin for entree, and chocolate varlhona. All of the dishes were really good, but we really enjoyed the garganelli (the aldante texture and the sauce). Surprisingly, the server never asked us how well our meats to be cooked for our entrees. When they came out, it was medium rare. This is how we usually order so it didn't matter, but if you are a well-done person or prefer it other way, I think you need to address it to the server. Next was our cheese plates... we ordered three but they gave us one more; I forgot the names of the cheese, but they were extremely delicious and complemented very well with the dry apricot, hazelnut vinegar, balsamic vinegar, etc.Finally the dessert was also very good; the chocolate varlhona is very rich with hazelnut chocolate cream (just like the core of ferrero rocher chocolate).

3.0,2/13/2018,"Summary: Excellent food but poor service and staff coordination for a restaurant of Bâtard's caliberWe went to Bâtard for dinner on a Saturday night and chose to have the four-course dinner menu. The food was delicious and exceeded expectations.Service, however, was disappointing and in some cases close to insulting. In no particular order:* Bread brought to table prior to the waiter even taking a drink order (waiter essentially MIA for first 10 minutes after we were seated)* We ordered a glass of champagne which turned out to not be great upon the tasting pour - we asked if we could try the other option offered instead to which the waiter said ""Sure but it's $40 a glass"" - did we look like we couldn't afford it (we were actually aware of the price already)? Tip to Batard, perhaps have more than two champagne options on your by-the-glass menu: a $15 sub-par rose with the next step up being a $40 glass of Bollinger? * Servers stepped on my feet multiple times while bringing food to table and bumped against us as we exited the restaurant* The entire four course meal was served in less than 60 minutes - no spacing of portions at all - our first course was delivered 5 minutes after we placed the order - this limited our enjoyment of the dining experience and made the meal feel rushedBâtard has really great food and we were satisfied with everything on the menu but the service really could use a step up - this seems to be consistent with other feedback I've read on Yelp, and it's surprising that the restaurant hasn't done more to address the issue.

4.0,1/29/2018,"Pretty solid restaurant week experience - not sure if I would have felt as positively if I had paid the full sticker price, but for a $42 3-course meal...sure, you got me. I went with my cousin with a 9:00pm reservation and were seated immediately. They charge $25/pp for canceled reservations, which as much as it bothers me on principle, I totally get it. We ordered a bottle of white wine to share. There were a number of cheap-ish bottles on the menu (in the $40-$50 range) which I think is always nice. The bottle was fine but unexceptional.We ordered the Viennese Wedding Soup and Gravlax for our first courses. I was impressed with the portion size of the Gravlax, which was delicious and beautifully presented. The Viennese Wedding Soup was tasty as well.For our mains, I had the Pappardelle with sausage and my cousin had the Bass. Mine was absolutely delicious but the portion size was a little disappointing, especially for a pasta which is relatively inexpensive to make. My cousin greatly enjoyed her Bass.For dessert, I had the Poached Pear and my cousin had the Chocolate Fondant. She loved hers but I thought it was underwhelming. The Poached Pear, on the other hand, was absolutely delicious. Definitely some of the better desserts I've had from a high-end place, which I find are usually the disappointments of the meal.We ordered the $14 cheese supplement which was a great value and we got to pick from a list of cheeses. We ordered a goats milk cheese, a cheddar, and a brie. They also gave us some bleu cheese, which was quite pungent and not at all my favorite, but a nice gesture regardless. Service/timing could have been better and is the reason I'm deducting a star. Our first courses came out relatively quickly but we waited quite a long time for our mains. Throughout the meal the service was relatively uncoordinated (servers not communicating with each other). We ended up having to rush the last part of our meal in order to make it out for bottle service. TL;DR: Good experience. Not perfect, but a great value for restaurant week.

5.0,1/28/2018,"Our dinner at Batard was a new exposure to contemporary Austrian cuisine and to what I would call nouvelle Viennese. The Tribeca restaurant is in lower Manhattan and has an understated sheen that gently glitters in a subdued hue.The bar opens at the entrance and attracts your attention as you walk to your table of dark burnished wood sans table cloth. The deep banquette seating allows you to take in the dining room. Cocktails for starters were well prepared and had a cool quenching taste. The appetizers were a nicely served Viennese Wedding Soup, which was a broth of  liver dumplings, white-egg noodles and short rib. Its presentation in a crafted pottery bowl was simple yet elegant. The crème de resistance was the famed Octopus Pastrami of braised ham hock, pommery mustard and new potatoes. The ingredients were compressed to form a gelatinous slice that I doubt was ever eaten in fin de siècle Vienna.One main entree consisted of Roast Poussin, a very  tender young chicken with celeriac, pearl onion, baby spinach and apple. The chicken was so tender due to the delectable moisture that seeped through the crispy skin and white meat. A Cote du Rhone white complemented the Poussin. The second entrée was Berkshire Pork Schnitzel served with potato salad, cucumber, lingonberry and sea buckthorn.  After a full meal, we ended with Sorbets of mandarin, lemon and white peach ices and coffee. I found much food in the three-course servings and appreciated the attentive service that was not rushed.",0,0,0,Richard Y.,"Warren, NJ",1,4,10

My friends and I even made jokes that Batard might specially design this dish for all the coming Asian customers lol. The Bass is always my favorite. I do like the cooking style Batard. The dessert just highlighted the night - the three-flavor sorbet was so nice, chilly, do love the cranberries flavor the best.

The glassware was broken in her mouth out of sudden. Luckily, she spotted it out and didn't get hurt. The servant apologized and the rest of dinner went smoothly. After signing the tip, I wanted to leave a comment about this glassware issue. I went to the manager-level guy at the front desk and told him that this glassware is too fragile and not suitable for a young kid. It's might be better to serve the kid-friendly plastic ware or not providing the glassware for a kid. He fought  back:"" I don't take blame for that. You should train your kid to use the glassware. I work in this business since 1986 and we use glassware in the Michelin star restaurant. If you want to use a plastic ware, don't go to the Michelin restaurant.""I felt disrespected. Yes. I learned a lesson that I need to teach my daughter that the glassware provided for her in the restaurant might not be safe.  But does a 30-year experience makes it right to not listen to the customers' voice and being so arrogant in a Michelin star restaurant?

Small bar at the front with an assortment of liquors and customized Batard cocktails, as well.Service hovered a bit, though part of that is the service station was right beside our table of 10.Prix fixe menu (2, 3, or 4 items at different price points) that were very reasonable.The lamb ragu garganelli was excellent; probably the best dish of the night, rich, great texture on the pasta and crunch of the almonds. Sad I didn't just get a full size of this for main. The white truffle pappardelle -- pasta was ok, but the truffle I am not as much a fan of as others. Worth trying a bite, but I find it hard to appreciate the flavor being worth so much more.Main I had the strip loin - skip it. It needs sauce, and is otherwise a dry and relatively tasteless piece of beef. Go with the duck or fish, people seemed to enjoy that. Spätzle was ok, but the broccolini was good.Desserts - stayed away from the too sweet souffle and chocolate, and went for a vanilla ice cream... they brought out a tiny amount, and there was some perhaps ground coffee beans (not roasted) or chocolate beans adding texture but not really enjoyable with the ice cream.Will have to try the octopus and cauliflower soup -- maybe they'll be better next time and will try to pick a better main related to the pasta (reasonably good).",6,4,5,Hank C.,"Jersey City, NJ",1732,2830,1188

Despite the lack of hype these days, this place still delivered a very good meal and showed why it's maintained its Michelin star status.I'll caveat all this with that I didn't pay a penny for this meal. Came here for a Thursday night dinner for two. Batard doesn't have an a la carte menu and instead has courses - 2 for $59, 3 for $79, 4 for $89, and I think that you can add even more after that (or so our waiter said). My friend and I both chose the 3 course meal. My starter was the famous octopus pastrami, while he ordered the seafood sulz. The octopus had a great presentation, and I loved the spices used in the dish as well as how tender the octopus was (which is no easy feat). I was pretty jealous of the seafood sulz though, as it looked amazing. For mains, we both chose the duck breast. What came out was perhaps one of the best duck dishes I've ever had, and a sizeable portion as well. Dessert was a vanilla souffle for two, which was a fine and light way to end the meal, though nothing too memorable and has nothing on my favorite souffle in the city (hi Minetta Tavern).Drinks were also strong and well mixed, and the bottle of wine that the somm recommended was great (I would say that even if it were Barefoot, don't trust anything I have to say on wine).",0,0,0,Yuting Z.,"Manhattan, NY",435,332,543

I went with a group of 10 including 2 children, unexpectedly, because my babysitter canceled. Batard is not young children friendly as they do not have high chairs and I felt that the hostess kind of stared at me quizzically when I walked in with an infant and a toddler. However, he didn't comment. They gave us a round table towards the middle of the dining room and when I asked to be seated along the wall benches so that the baby seat would easier fit onto the bench, they said they could not accommodate us there. I wasn't sure completely why as it was ample room. Now onto the food, the menu in the restaurant was a bit different than the menu online. We tried steak tartare, octopus pastrami, foie gras, a crudo, mackerel, tagliatelle, branzino, bass, duck, lamb, prime rib, duck egg creme brulee and souffle for two. The prime rib was an extra $25 per person and had to be shared by at least 2 people but it was so delicious and worth it. All the other dishes were delicious as well but the prime rib stands out in my mind. It also comes with mashed potatoes and mushrooms. You can mix the prefix options so not everyone at the table has to get 4 courses but everyone has to get at least two courses. The service was good, not great as it got busier.

4.0,9/13/2017,"I went to Batard during restaurant week with a couple of friends. The setup is casual and comfortably small and intimate. The lighting was a bit too dim though, it made the food look slightly bland. In terms of service, the staff was really friendly and accommodating, the only low point was that they would refold our serviettes every time we got up or even put it on the table. This is extremely minor, but it is kind of intrusive and slightly annoying when every 10 minutes someone would appear just to fold a serviette.I ordered the smoked salmon, amish chicken and duck egg creme brulee. The smoked salmon was very flavorful and  the sauce was light and creamy, and complimented the dish nicely, easily making it my favorite dish of the night. The amish chicken was disappointing. It was bland, with all of the seasoning and flavor being in the garnish/side parts. The chicken was a bit tough to cut either because of the size or that it was overcooked. The creme brulee was amazing! It was rich and despite it being made of duck egg, was not overpowering or overtly present (meaning it was actually subtle). Overall it was a great experience, my friends really enjoyed the chic atmosphere and the good food. Would love to go back again not during restaurant week and try the other dishes!",0,0,0,Erin-marie P D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,25,20
5.0,9/9/2017,"Chose this place for my birthday dinner, which also happened to fall during restaurant week in summer 2017. The food and drinks (I had one with watermelon and cucumber) were absolutely amazing, but our service was terrible. Main waiter ignored us for most of the meal, and the bus brought the dessert while my boyfriend was in the bathroom, so I was awkwardly sitting there with cake and a lit candle while I waited.

5.0,9/8/2017,"This is a very belated Summer 2017 Restaurant Week review. However, since their RW menu was basically just select items off their regular menu, I think you can also read this as a general review as well! As stated above, their RW menu was just select items off their regular menu - with a cheaper price tag. I had made reservations a month in advance and we were early but was seated right away. Our waitress was super nice and friendly and very attentive. She even noticed that we were out of bread and a second round of bread was offered, which I really appreciated. For my appetizer, I opted for the Steak Tartare with soy egg yolk, wild rice, and shiso, served with a slice of toasted sesame sourdough. The tartare was phenomenal - it was very flavorful and the soy egg yolk really added to the profile of the steak. My mom had the Smoked Trout Rillettes, served with chilled green asparagus, quail egg, and trout roe. The rillettes were so smooth and basically melted in our mouths. The quail egg was cooked perfectly and had a tiny bit of runny yoke. This was the most aesthetically pleasing dish of the night - the presentation was spectacular. For my main, I opted for the Roasted Amish Chicken with roasted leeks, crushed la ratte potatoes, and mousseron mushrooms. The chicken was very moist and tender. I almost couldn't believe I was eating a piece of breast meat. It was so juicy! The sauce was also very savory and fragrant. My mom ordered their Crispy Branzino, served with Sungold tomatoes, basil, and green asparagus. I had a piece of her fish and the skin was so crispy! The fish itself was tender and moist, which contrasted very nicely with the crispiness of the fish skin. We both decided on the same dessert - the Duck Egg Crème Brûlée with bing cherries and chamomile sherbet. This dessert was a real treat! The crème brûlée was very silky and smooth. A perfect end to a delicious dinner!",1,1,1,Michelle T.,"New York, NY",367,1165,1125
4.0,9/4/2017,"I was SOOOOOO excited to see that Batard participated in 2017 summer RW and booked a reservation immediately. No octopus pastrami or lamb for 2 on RW menu. Fine. I thought the chicken was incredibly cooked. I paid supplement to get the cheese plate, which was interesting but was not worth the surcharge.

5.0,9/2/2017,"Disclaimer: I am writing this review from the perspective of a person with your average fine dining experience. In other words, this review is about how a Michelin-starred restaurant appealed to your somewhat ""Average Joe,"" not how the cuisine appealed to a culinary connoisseur. Our party of 4 came here around 5:45 PM, 15 minutes before our scheduled reservation at 6. The restaurant was completely empty (all the better for us), which was surprising for a Saturday afternoon, but the restaurant quickly filled up later around 7:30. After being seated promptly, we took some time ordering off of Batard's concise menu and eventually ordered our food. Service was great - the bussers were very professional and polite (although they did seem a bit too unemotional/distant at times), and our main server, Alessandro, was incredibly warm and accommodating throughout the meal. The food was very good (4/5), with some dishes being exemplary (e.g. The pork schnitzel and the white peach sorbet). The pork schnitzel, for example, was incredibly tender, juicy, and delicious. However, what really shone in our visit to Batard was their accommodation of a visit of their kitchen. Despite being swamped with orders in the middle of a full house, (and I mean at least 40 diners being served at once, with multiple large groups) Alessandro and Chef Glocker gave us a quick tour of the kitchen in the middle of the service and allowed us to take a picture with the executive and sous chefs themselves. That experience and the service is what pushed this review from 4 stars to 4.5. Overall, I think that Batard is an excellent place to try your first Michelin-starred restaurant. Thank you Alessandro and Chef Glocker for providing us with an excellent dining experience.",0,0,0,Jeffrey Y.,"Mount Pocono, PA",0,8,0

1.0,8/30/2017,"I I had originally made a reservation for an evening during restaurant week, but then couldn't make it. So when I called to cancel, the woman who took my call told me that they are extending restaurant week. So of course, instead of just cancelling my reservation, I changed it to a later date. Well, when we got there and asked for the restaurant week menu, they said they could not offer that to us because the extension of restaurant week was reserved for only certain people who were in the wait list and a note would have been made next to the reservation. They seemed to think that we were trying to pull a scam on them in spite of the fact that it was their reservationist who failed to make a note when she took my reservation. Since they were unwilling to accommodate, we left. I understand that mistakes can happen, but we were very shocked that a restaurant of that supposed caliber did not make any effort to come up with a proposal to make the customer happy. We would have been flexible and willing to accept an effort and in the end would have spent a good sum there.

The wine-pairing that we had went well with the three courses. My only issue with the overall experience was the service. One of the head servers seemed reluctant at first to take our order, despite the fact that they seemed to be under-staffed. Halfway throughout our meal, he began to audibly chastise one of the bussers, which made for a slightly uncomfortable experience.For a Michelin one star, I expected more professional service but I guess you get what you pay for during Restaurant Week -- a cheaper version of the real deal, so to speak.",1,0,0,Leah C.,"New York, NY",1,54,30

First Course - YUM! (a) Smoked Trout Rilletes - Trout, asparagus, quail egg, and trout roe. (b) Scallop Crudo - Scallops, avocado mousse, lime, radish, black sesame. (c) Octopus Pastrami - Octopus, braised ham hock, pommery mustard, and potatoes. Second Course - MEH.(a) Crispy Branzino - Branzino, sungold tomatoes, basil, and green asparagus. Too salty. (b) Black Bass - Started out nice but was overloaded with salt as I neared the base of the fish as well.Third Course - NEUTRAL. (a) Duck Egg Creme Brulee - Topped with bing cherries and chamomile sherbet.

4.0,8/18/2017,"Came for restaurant week. I started off with the heirloom tomato salad, which I honestly thought was going to be boring (salads, smh). To my surprise it was fricken delicious! There were peaches and the ricotta cheese tasted like whipped cream. For the main course I had the crispy branzino which was cooked perfectly. The skin was extra crispy and the actual meat was nice and tender. For dessert I chose the chocolate tart, which as a dark chocolate fiend I was very pleased with. It was a little bit too rich for me but the vanilla sorbet (?? not sure if it was a sorbet) lightened it up. I also had a bite of my bro's duck egg creme brulee which I wish I had ordered too (but for the sake of variety, let my brother order it). I took a star off for the service, they were a little too quick. They were attentive and nice however they did ask us if we wanted bread like 3x and then delivered the bread to the wrong table.

4.0,8/12/2017,"In New York, for a restaurant, there're two kinds of food they serve, one pricey regular kind, and another in restaurant week. Batard is no exception. My observation: they probably made cheap entrees up for restaurant week. Dessert and appetizer are still solid. The whole experience is 3.5/5 rounding up to 4, because their appetizers were amazing.SMOKED TROUT RILLETTES: My personal favorite of the night. It shows how rainbow trout could be moist and tender. I almost felt it melting down in my mouth with the green asparagus juice. The fish roe made the texture more delicate. STEAK TARTARE: Another great example of french dish. Dipping with an egg yolk, the fresh beef taste more like jello in a good way.ROASTED AMISH CHICKEN: The chicken is a little dry and boring. Who likes chicken when it's plain roasted chicken... I've definitely had better ones. CRISPY BRANZINO: well, the highlight of the dish was asparagus, and it was very instagrammable. The fish skin was crispy to a degree that I couldn't easily break it or swallow it. DUCK EGG CREME BRULEE: The bing cherry inside creme brulee made it interesting. I couldn't taste the duck egg any difference though. DARK CHOCOLATE TART: Ahh, I haven't tasted real dark chocolate for a while. This tart is so curiously dark that I almost regret ordering it. The service was generally good, except occasionally hiccups. It was a Friday night in a restaurant week. I'm tolerant enough for them. But it was not perfect as a one-star Michelin restaurant. Anyway, restaurant week food are mostly expected to be less than normal standards. I'll eventually come back and try their regular cuisines to be fair for the review.

3.0,8/7/2017,"Yet another disappointing Restaurant Week showing from a rather acclaimed restaurant. The food was just average, and the service was rather awkward - I felt a little uncomfortable in the restaurant actually. For the appetizers, we opted for the beef tartar and this ricotta/tomato/peach salad thing. I immediately regretted getting the ricotta and tomato as it was a sad looking dish compared to the beef tartar. The cheese was a bit scarce, and I was not fond of the addition of peaches to this dish. The beef tartar was a little better, with super flavorful beef. The whole egg yolk was a bit too much, as I was expecting a quail egg yolk instead for that portion of meat.For the entrees we opted for the risotto and the Amish chicken. This time it was my friends time to regret their choices, as the risotto was super plain looking with a stalk of broccolini in the middle. I will say the texture of the risotto was perfect, and the flavor was rich, creamy, and cheesy. However, the dish is super lacking without any protein of some sort, and it felt a bit incomplete. The Amish chicken was much better in comparison, as there was a big chicken breast over some very delicious potatoes and very tasty mushrooms. The mushrooms are aggressively seasoned, and had an amazing earthy flavor to them. The weakest part of this dish was the chicken actually, as it was a tad bit overcooked and hard to saw through. For the desert we all opted for the duck egg creme brûlée. I'm personally not a fan of desert as I feel like there's only so good it can get, and this was no exception - rather one dimensional in flavor, but the texture of the custard was great!Raspberry marsh mellows were provided at the end which had a very strong raspberry flavor.The weirdest part of the meal was the service. We were situated in the back of the restaurant, right in front of the waiter table. The entire meal it felt like we were being stared at by the waiters - it felt VERY STUFFY and UNCOMFORTABLE with them watching us like hawks. Even funnier was when one of us would leave to use the restroom - one of the waiters would swoop up out of nowhere and food the napkin. Overall it felt very intrusive and impossible to have a conversation without a worker dropping in to fold our napkins. One of my friends instructed us to protect his napkin with our lives, as he stuffed on his chair before he left for the restroom. Not even 5 seconds after he left the waiter located the napkin and folded it - so we had some good laughs at their expense.Perhaps it isn't really fair to judge a restaurant too harshly during restaurant week when an entirely different type of clientele comes to dine at your restaurant. But the restaurant week menu was very weak, and did not even showcase their famous octopus. It was too safe, and no dish really stood out and made you want to come back. A restaurant should strive to be their best during Restaurant Week, but unfortunately Batard fell short. I don't see myself returning in the future, but if I do, it's only because they provide you with a coupon for a free desert with your future meals HAHAHA.",1,2,0,Kevin C.,"Queens, NY",234,140,1516

5.0,8/4/2017,"Everything Restaurant Week is Supposed to BeOnce upon a time when restaurant week was conceived, it was supposed to give restaurants an opportunity to show off their virtuosity and skills during a slow period at a lower cost to lure a new audience.  Over the years, it evolved to the tired chicken and salmon show with cynical restauranteurs condescending to the "" impoverished"" masses and unsuspecting tourists.  Always optimistic, we've kept going, selecting places we probably wouldn't go to   or had been to and thought it might be interesting to go again.  We've found some gems and more often, places that were so undistinguished we'd never go back again.  So we chose Batard.  The four of us had all been there but hadn't been back in a couple of years--We've loved it in all its previous iterations going back to Montrechet but its downtown and definitely a ""destination"" restaurant.  We were thrilled we did.  From the menu, adventurous for Restaurant Week:  A steak tartar, exceptional--and something I haven't ordered in years--to the trout appetizer, complex flavors--it demands culinary excellence and a sophisticated palette to appreciate --no pandering here.  Even the ubiquitous  Bronzino (salmon's replacement) was imaginative and the chicken redolent in a smoldering vegetable sauce of mushrooms, onions and veggies showed off the chef's virtuosity --and the risotto, always a complicated dish to make correctly, was perfect.  The wine recommendations on the back of the Restaurant week menu were well-selected and well-priced.  We chose a $40 white that tingled and had a full-body.  We sampled all the desserts and even somebody who doesn't like eggs and crèmebrulee had more than one bite.  The strawberry marshmallows at the end were a humorous touch.  Service was professional, efficient and non-obtrusive (no cloying waiters grinning and all teeth, asking ""Is Everything Okay?""  and the room has aged to a warm yellow patina.  As my satisfied friend said, ""It's so nice to eat in a grown-up dining room,""  Restaurant Week, this is as good as it gets!",0,0,0,Melanie R.,"New York, NY",11,42,0

Part of it is that I had high expectations, I was disappointed when the food quality and service fell short. The presentation of food is pretty. I dislike the decor of the place. The service isnt bad but not what you'd expect from an upscale restaurant. I won't complain about the service, the restaurant is busier than usual, so it's understandable.I like my appetizer. It's a trout dish with fish eggs and quail eggs in celery puree. The entree branzino was overcooked a bit, overall is good. My date's veg risottos was salty and uninteresting. I had duck egg creme brulee, I really liked. He had chocolate tart and it was terrible. It's amazing how a restaurant can mess up a chocolate dessert...

We did not have a waiter even stop by to introduce themselves 10 minutes after sitting down. We had to ask the hostess to bring us a waiter. During the course of our 4 course meal and drinks, our waiter stopped by only twice. Once to take our order and once to pick up the check. No one even bothered to ask us if we wanted a second round of drinks or ask us how the food was. Our bus boy who picked up our dishes couldn't even form coherent words and basically grunted and mumbled the whole time. Absolutely unacceptable for a restaurant with a Michelin star. Food: 2 StarsThe octopus ham was unique but I wasn't expecting it to be cold. All in all it was good but I wish we had a waiter to explain that the top section of the menu consisted of cold foods.The risotto that came with the rabbit sausage was extremely salty. The risotto itself was saltier than the rabbit sausage. It was almost as if they accidentally seasoned the risotto twice. Two of us ordered the pork schitzel with potato salad. The breading fell off as soon as we cut into it. The sauce for the schnitzel was quite nice though. The potato salad was very unevenly seasoned. Mine was fine but the other person who had it mentioned it tasted extremely sour. I tried it and it was 3x more sour than mine and was basically inedible.

There is a process for everything and a waiter/waitress for everything as well.  We were promptly seated upon arrival (a few minutes late to be honest, but we called ahead and that was no problem at all).  The first thing you are served are two perfect pieces of bread.  The crust on one was made up of sesame and poppy seeds which gave it such a special and unexpected flavor.  The small dinner roll had large chunks of sea salt on top which again, took the bread to the next level.  We did the 4 course tasting menu for dinner with a $44 bottle of red wine which was just great for the price.  Our appetizers were the octopus pastrami and the steak tartare, both fantastic as expected and previously reviewed.  Request an extra piece of toasted bread with the steak tartare so you can fully enjoy it!  For our secondi we ordered rabbit sausage over risotto and sunflower-seed pasta - both are a must try as this was our favorite course.  For our main course I ordered the Branzino and my boyfriend got the duck breast.  The duck breast flavor was out of this world and the branzino was cooked very well.  For dessert we got the duck egg creme brulee (which i wish was bruleed a bit more) and the blueberry olive oil cake with marscapone ice cream.  All in all, 5 star meal and experience.  Certainly worth the money, calories and trip!",1,0,1,Gail G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,10

4.0,6/4/2017,"Having to choose between Bâtard and another one star Michelin establishment, my girlfriend and I decided to dine here due to the recommendation from a friend, good reviews, and a better choice in the selection of courses. The establishment was a lot smaller than many of the restaurants that we've been to. However, that wasn't a bad thing... we felt more intimate while enjoying our dinner.Our dinner was a three course meal each in which I ordered an appetizer, pasta dish and a main entree while my girlfriend ordered an appetizer, main entree and dessert. Of course we shared everything so it was a 6 course meal shared my two :)My appetizer was the scallop crudo which I believe was the best appetizer I've ever had in my life!!! It was definitely the best course out of the six as well! The taste is indescribable... definitely a must try and a highly recommended! My girlfriend got their famous octopus 'pastrami'. She described the taste as 'very good, soft and chewy'. A very good description indeed... also a recommended course as well!The pasta dish, my second course, was the Doppio pasta. This dish was exceptional as well. The course consists of English peas, ricotta, lemon and pine nuts. It was a very strange but tasty gathering of ingredients that made this dish one of the most memorable and my girlfriend's favorite dish. Our entrees were the duck breast and the Colorado lamb. The duck breast was exceptional but did not stand out compared to duck breasts we've had a many other restaurants. The duck breast is complimented well with the citrus cara cara orange. The lamb was great as they hid the smell of lamb which my girlfriend distastes and cooked it to perfection. The lamb rack & leg however felt too small for an entree to enjoy as it did have a 8$ supplement charge. Dessert was a big disappointment. We had indicated on our reservations note that it was our anniversary but they must have mistook it for a birthday dinner. The dessert we chose for our last course was Caramelized milk bread. It was basically a glazed donut with a side of icecream. Wasn't too fond of the dessert and other choices did not sound as appetizing. Nevertheless the food was a 8/10.The reason why we are giving our experience and the review a 4 stars out of 5 was due to service. Our reservation was at 7:15pm. I understand that during this time, it is or will be the busiest time for dinner. However, our server was late to take our order and did not bring food in a timely manner as we had to wait over 15-20 minute per course. We had concluded dinner in a little over 2 hours... having been a server myself, I expected my server to ask how my meal were after each course but was probably asked once at most throughout the two hours while dining at this restaurant. One minor but worth noting is that the price between a 4 course + 2 course is cheaper than a two 3 course meal. We found this 'mistake' and asked specifically for the 4+2 but was charged the 3+3. They should either fix the pricing of the courses or the server made the mistake of mistaking our order.",0,0,0,Thomas K.,"New York, NY",263,20,10

The hostess didn't offer to take our coats, which was fine until we realized every other diner's coat had been checked. We grabbed a seat at the bar while we waited and it took almost 10 minutes to place a drink order. They were out of 3 menu items, 2 of which they let us order and informed us about 10 minutes later they had run out. So on a 3 course meal, 2 courses were unavailable. The table we sat at was behind a wooden pole and the chairs were uncomfortable and cheap and completely different from all the other chairs in the restaurant. Almost as if they ran out of furniture and grabbed our seats from the basement. They consistently set our courses with the wrong flatware (my husband had lamb and they gave him a butter knife and a fish knife; we shared a dessert, they gave me a spoon and fork and just a spoon to him). The bathrooms were a mess. The servers were nice enough, but nothing was at the level a Michelin star restaurant should be at. The food was unmemorable and not worth the price tag. I settle for subpar service when I'm not paying $400 for a meal and drinks. Batard totally missed the mark.",0,0,0,Kari K.,"New York, NY",54,16,0

5.0,5/15/2017,"Second time at Bâtard and an equally pleasant experience. The only flaw was a surprisingly underwhelming Wiener Schnitzel that I opted for this time around in lieu of the the delicious Duck Breast that I enjoyed the previous visit. As an Austrian, I had very high expectations of the Schnitzel, which unfortunately fell rather flat (no pun intended) - meat was moist but the breading was dry like Saharan sand and rather tasteless. Otherwise, an impeccable experience - divine foie gras, followed by exquisite rabbit sausage risotto. Desserts were fantastic as well. The service is highly attentive and friendly to boot.Overall, one of my absolute favorites in the city, and I'm hopeful that Markus's success story continues.",1,0,0,Adi H.,"Manhattan, NY",4,2,0

I kept thinking ... previous saliva all over that table and now.. will be on my fork and knives.   How gross.  Yes- I wiped down my fork and knife once they set on table.  ( a few times ).  It made me felt like I was in Chinatown cleaning my fork and chopsticks in the hot tea.Food is ok, but nothing screaming to come back a second time.  Plenty of other French restaurants that will blow your mind away.   A great meal is suppose to feel like a journey.  If I wanted to get full, any decent place will do.  I have to say living in NYC, we have a TON of good food. You really have to stick out for me to give 4-5 stars. We ordered braised duck, pork shoulder, shrimp, salmon, octopus and tortellini dish.  Out of 6 dishes, two that stuck out was the shrimp and pork shoulder.  Their wine selections were good.

That said, I did not ask for anything in return it was a call to provide them with awareness and to take care of it.

3.0,4/26/2017,"What?! He's going with the... 3. I don't care how many Michelin stars Batard has or how transcendent the pork shoulder was or how cool it was to see the floor manager, featured on television, walking around and micro-managing things like the placement of napkins. It was ultimately pretty disappointing, and I felt the place was coasting a bit too much on reputation. The service could best be summarized as ""F U, we have a Michelin star, go F yourself."" (Sorry for cursing. I'm a classy guy, but it's the only way of capturing how I felt!) Spring onion soup was great, though the portion will make you feel like you could eat a Popeye's ""Louisiana"" Chicken bucket afterwards. (I ate the thing in 30 seconds and even considered licking the bowl clean, though that would've lacked class in a place like this.) Ragu pasta was great but nothing out of this world and better on the P2P (Price to Portions Ratio). Pork shoulder was absolutely transcendent, I have to say, and possibly the best I've had in the NYC. The only place that beats this is a French place in Chicago that I'd grab the name of, but I'm tired and don't feel like looking through my Yelp reviews. (Also a little freaked out that I can't remember the place, since it's one of my favorite Chicago joints. #33yo)So why only 3 stars? The creme brule took 25 minutes to come out, and there was no option to take it home (""It's baked right into the glass."") What?! They were also out of the chocolate dessert. For all the pageantry, this -- and having to wait 15 extra minutes after our reservation time -- really undercut justification for the ""chic tax"" that places like this level on your bill.

We had two bottles of wine, it took us about two hours to finish the first one and the second one was served in the middle of our main course, we had a glass each (they pour a very small amount) and the next time they brought the bottle over we got topped of with a half an ounce each and apparently that was the end of the bottle - we noticed that but didn't say anything - basically we paid a $100 for the bottle that was poured to another table - the sommelier mentioned he sold five of those in that night so I can only assume they confused our bottle with another table's. I am so fucking pissed about that.

Our second course we tried the farfalle and caramelle pastas, which were the perfect combination of comfortable and delicious. The porcelet shoulder I had for my main course was incredibly tender, and my friend had the juicy venison complemented by dark chocolate.

Rabbit sausage risotto was out of the world, with right amount of spice and perfectly cooked risotto.Main dishes were cod and duck breast. Cod definitely deserves Michelin and James Beard, while duck breast is surely tender but a bit too orangey sweet in my humble opinion.For dessert, we shared a duck egg creme brûlée, perfectly topped with pear sorbet.Lastly, chef presented complimentary cappuccino ball.

She spoke so softly that I can hear nothing when she's explaining my dish. Food is okay. I expected more. We ordered the steak for 2($25 supplement), it's just a regular steak you could get at a nice steakhouse. But they don't have steak knife (!!!???) So I was ""fighting"" to cut the steak.

One member of my party regretted not ordering a different dish and pulled over the waitress who changed her order with no issue.The food was excellent! Their ""octopus pastrami"" was beautiful and tasted just like pastrami, I couldn't believe it. The Leber and Zunge (liver and tongue) was so foreign to me that I knew I had to try it. While the texture was a bit odd, the flavor was excellent and I knew since the waitress said it was classically Austrian that this would be the place to enjoy it. For my main course I had a branzino with lentils that was truly delicious. Delicate, elegant and really a special dish. For dessert I had a duck egg creme brûlée that extremely indulgent and very very well prepared. It rivaled the creme brûlée at Le Cirque!Overall a lovely meal with great company.

4.0,1/19/2017,"Came to Batard several weeks ago and I had mixed feelings. I wanted to love the place but I left feeling iffy. I also do not want to bash an otherwise great restaurant for what could be an isolated incident. We had a fairly late reservation in the middle of the week, restaurant started out packed and the crowds slowly dwindled by the end--but the service was terribly slow. We started around 8 and didn't get out till after 11pm. We were practically begging for the food to come out faster because we were getting tired and there weren't too many customers. What was the holdup? The waitstaff was extremely pleasant and helpful but slow. The decor was very plain. I tend to like the minimalist approach to decorating a restaurant so as to focus on the food but they could certainly add a little something. We ordered a bit of everything including the Octopus pastrami that everyone says is a must--it was definitely good but I am not sure how I felt about the other flavors on the plate. We also ordered the Atlantic cod and the roasted halibut as well as another dish that had lobster in it but I don't quite remember it. The food was good overall but I think the flavors could definitely be stepped up so as to compete with the local market and to keep up with the expectations of what a restaurant like this should be like. As I said, the slow service was probably an isolated incident and the food was generally very good. I will probably be back and recommend that if you are in the area you try it too!

5.0,1/4/2017,"I work in the neighborhood and was searching for Michelin star restaurants within walkable distance. Based on the rave reviews for this restaurant I decided to give it a try. I booked a reservation at the last minute for myself and was able to get the last seat (according to open table).The eminence was cozy, comfortable and elegant and waiters were very attentive. I decided to go with the 2 courses and selected beef tartare for starter, and black bass as the second course. While waiting for the food they served two types of complimentary bread coming out piping hot. I liked the round bread which is soft, chewy and has a tiny sweet taste. The beef tartare was in large portion, surprisingly good and perfectly flavored, neither too chewy or meaty. The bread coming with it was a perfect compliment of the meat. I put the beef on top of the bread and enjoyed every bite of it. The waiter was attentive enough to ask if I needed another slice of bread and I said yes.By the time I fished the first course I was already kinda full. Then the waiter brought over a complimentary fish from the kitchen which was the celeriac tortellini, one of the mid courses. I red reviews before I came and apparently this was a much recommended dish by lots of people. The tortellini was a bit dry but the truffle highlighted the entire dish.The black bass was good but didn't blow my mind.

2.0,12/11/2016,"I am so disappointed to be writing this review.  I was looking forward to dining at Batard with a dear friend from college who was in town for the weekend.  She is from San Francisco and dines out at the city's finest restaurants often. she is a very successful event planner so is very familiar with what ""good service"" means. I am a self proclaimed foodie,  work in the wine industry and as my OpenTable and Resy profiles can attest, have dined at many of the best restaurants in New York. We had high expectations considering Batard is a James Beard award winning restaurant and has received a Michelin star.  My friend and I were running late for our reservation because we had trouble finding a cab.  We called the restaurant to let them know.  In the end we were 10 minutes late for our 8:45 reservation.  When we arrived at the restaurant however, we were told our table wasn't even ready.  Every stool at the bar was occupied so we were left standing in a very awkward spot between the cheese cart and the bar.  We were right in the middle of the waitstaff traffic.  It took a while to get the bartender's attention which again, made it very awkward.  We finally ordered a glass of Cremant and two seats freed up.  We were just getting settled and looking forward to our glass of bubbly when the hostess told us our table was ready.  We were seated at our table and I expected that our glasses of previously ordered wine would have been brought over to us immediately but we sat and waited for longer than we should have.My friend was wearing a black lace skirt so asked for a black napkin.  She was told that they did't have black napkins.  We were given menus and left on our own to peruse while we caught up on each other's lives.  When our waiter came, we asked about the dishes that shouldn't be missed and he walked us through his favorites.  My friend then told him about her allergies which include nuts.  After deciding what we wanted (the three course with a pasta thrown in to share), we fell deep into conversation again.  After 15-20 minutes, we realized that our waiter had never returned to take our order.  He finally came to the table, apologized for his absence and we ordered our food.  We both decided that we wanted the sommelier to wine pair each of our 4 courses.  The somm came over to our table and seemed shocked at our request.  I found this extremely odd since most restaurants serving a coursed dinner also offer the dinner to be wine paired.  Generally somms are thrilled to pair dishes because they are passionate about their personally curated wine lists.  We convinced him that we wanted the wine pairings but we were both made to feel like we were asking too much.The courses started and the food at Batard is delicious.  The kitchen is sending out beautifully prepared and well executed food.  It's the service that is lacking.  The wine served with my first course of crudo was a petit chablis.  I was a bit skeptical but was excited to taste a GOOD petit chablis since I read that the beverage director loves chablis and drinks it often.  I did not like the chablis but did enjoy the wines that followed, especially the pinot noir/gamay blend served with our pasta course.  Oddly, the somm never returned to tell us about the wines and why he chose them.  In fact, we never saw him again.More hiccups followed.  Our pasta dish wasn't split as I would have expected and my friends food allergies were forgotten about quite a few times throughout the meal.  The truth is that when you are dining at a restaurant of a certain caliber, one has certain expectations and one wants to leave feeling like they had a special evening.  Sadly, that is not the case with Batard.  I hope they are able to get it together so that the quality of service matches the quality of the food.  With the upcoming closing of Bouley, it would be nice if Batard could fill it's shoes but as of now,  it has a long way to go.",0,0,0,Kerri M.,"Greenwich, CT",0,2,0

This past time, my boyfriend and I had a Friday reservation at 9 pm. We ordered a drink at the bar and each had a glass of wine with dinner.The service was excellent and very attentive. My boyfriend noted he had a gluten allergy when we ordered and when they brought bread for me before the appetizers, they didn't offer it to him (which most other places would), and instead told him gluten free bread was on its way. Plus one.We both got the 2 courses for $58 and shared 3 cheeses for our dessert course for $16.For my appetizer, I had the Steak tartare. The bread that it came with was delicious. The tartare was perfectly flavored, had a hint of spiciness and  nice texture from the crunch. It was not chewy or too meaty, and was very tasty. My boyfriend got the octopus pastrami, which he loves and has gotten both times. To me, it honestly just tasted like pastrami and not like octopus; but to each her own.For entrees, we both got the duck, which was complemented by wonderful citrus flavors and sauce. The fat was perfectly rendered and the skin crispy and salty. It was cooked to a very medium rare, which I prefer, but was surprised to see.  The crispy quinoa added a nice crunch and the charred greens a nice contrast in flavor.They have a selection of many cheeses, and we picked 3 winners (spelling could be off, but we went with figaro, cremont and annalies). The cranberry bread that they gave to pair with the cheeses was great; they brought the boyfriend more gluten free bread.Batard is a nice restaurant with a good atmosphere and deserving of its Michelin star.

5.0,12/1/2016,"Be prepared to be surprised when you dine at Bâtard. Many of the dishes are nothing like they seem on the menu. And for diners who don't like that element of surprise, the food is likely to be disconcerting. However, for those who enjoy creative, even whimsical, cuisine, Batard is likely to please very much.We ordered the 4-course menu for dinner ($75 when we dined, currently $82). Both the Scallop and the Mushroom Tart were terrific first courses. They both had an element of foraging to them, the scallop being somewhat hidden beneath the carrots and cabbage, and the deconstructed tart plated as if still in its natural wooded habitat.For our second course, we both got the Octopus. But the octopus was prepared in the manner of pastrami, something that I have never seen nor tasted before. Paired with whole-grain mustard, pickles, and a rye crumble, the dish was absolutely delicious and nothing short of brilliant.We did Beef for 2 for our third course, a dish that departed from the conventional short rib and was instead a kind of play on cassoulet. It was rustic, comforting, and very satisfying.Our desserts were more predictable, but they were equally delicious. We had the Rice Pudding and the Chocolate Torte. The torte, infused with elements of hazelnut, was especially decadent.The wine service at Bâtard was unpretentious and accommodating. We didn't want to spend over $100, so our somm recommended a 2012 Alain Gras Auxey-Duresses ($92). It's not often that I order red Burgundy off the list because it can be really expensive, but this reasonably-priced wine drank well above it's price point. It was fresh and bright with enough acidity to cut through all the courses.Bâtard is much better than it's one Michelin star rating.

3.0,11/3/2016,"Came to Batard for my 27th bday with hubby. We were very excited given the rave reviews for this restaurant. Service: 5 starsWaiters were attentive but not overly so. They filled our water, explained the menu. They were pleasant. The atmosphere was also warm and cozy. We had requested a nice table via Opentable, and they were able to accommodate us. We were seated in one of the booths. FYI, I believe that the best table for two are those that you can sit at a 90 degree angle - sitting across, your date is too far away from you, sitting side by side, you're just each gazing out into the open rather than each other. So we were able to sit perpendicular to each other, and it was a nice cozy seating. There was a sommelier who recommended a nice red wine to us within our price range. The only disappointment was that when we googled the wine, it turned out to retail about $11. Oh well, I guess that's the price you pay! Food: 3 starsHighlights of the evening were the complimentary bread (yes you can ask for more!). The bread came out piping hot, and the butter accompanying it was warm and soft, and melts on the bread! Usually restaurants serve cold butter, and I end up having to melt the butter on the candle that is usually on each table, haha. Not the case this time! We also really liked the doppio pasta, which surprised us - hubby has never eaten rabbit before, and I only had it once before, and both of us were afraid it would taste gamey. Not the case! The pasta came out like ravioli with two pockets. The pockets were stuffed with two different things - I think one of them was rabbit, and the other was maybe carrots? Explosion of flavor in your mouth. Loved this. The sweetbread risotto was so-so. The risotto was too al-dente, and the sweetbread was just way too much - kinda bordering on too tough, and too... strange. Would have preferred less sweetbread. Barbeque sturgeon was good, but nothing to write home about. The flavor was mild and pleasant, but nothing sticks in my mind about this dish less than a month later.The octopus pastrami was a let-down, especially considering how much people raved about it. It tasted like octopus. The texture was weird - kind of rubbery. We were not fans. I almost wanted to throw up in my mouth after eating half of it. But had to stomach it down - pricey meal, can't be wasteful!We both ordered the grilled porcelet as we were enticed by pork belly. Hubby liked the pork belly and though it was tender. I thought it was ok, not as tender as other pork belly I have had in the past. There was also way too much meat. The loin came out looking like a pork-chop, and was not as tender as I would have liked. By this time, we were both stuffed. I couldn't finish mine, so I took it to go. The take-home container and bag were just plain, not even branded with a logo of the restaurant. We saved room for dessert though. We ordered the caramel creme brulee and the banana bread. They didn't have the duck egg creme brulee sadly, wish we could have tried this! The creme brulee was nice. The banana bread was a little on the dense side. Standard desserts, nothing particular stood out.Price: Wine was $49, and we each opted for the 4 course meal for $82 each. Ended up around $220 or so after. You do get a lot of food, and end up feeling stuffed. I was just disappointed being that I wasn't wowed even though this has a Michelin Star, and also a James Bead winner.",1,0,0,Amy Y.,"Manhattan, NY",203,170,377

It was our first visit and it will most definitely not be our last. Superb from beginning to end. Every dish was spectacular.

4.0,10/1/2016,"Food here is really great. My sis, mom and I came here Saturday at 6pm. Restaurant was empty but got busier as we were leaving.   My mom and sister ordered the 2 course pre fix and I the three so we could share dessert. I liked the fact that not everyone at the table had to do the same course, and that you could get mix and matching courses.  We started off with some great bread (olive roll and poppy seed twist) and I a glass of Gruner - my favorite white wine. Yum. I started with the bbq sturgeon on blini, this ok to good. Would have preferred more blini and creme friache.  My mom has the rabbit ravioli to start (good), and my sister the grilled mackerel which she said was good. For mains, my sister had the delicious duck breast which was well cooked and had an amazing quinoa crust.  My mom the very fresh and clean Tasmanian trout which was really more like a salmon. I had the special veal schnitzel which was perfectly breaded and fried and totally tender. Not greasy. The lingonberry sauce was very good, and I liked the potato salad as it wasn't too heavy and didn't have too much mayo.  Normally I don't like potato salad. The food has an Austrian twang here though French. For dessert we shared the duck egg creme brûlée with raspberry sorbet and some BlackBerries. I'm not sure if the duck egg made a difference but it was definitely creamy and well doneService is really great and polite, attentive. They put a candle in our dessert as we were celebrating a special occasion.  Our server made really great recommendations.",4,0,2,Stephanie Y.,"New York, NY",878,1242,25
4.0,9/24/2016,"First of all, I have to say I'm a very picky person on giving out my stars. So this place has nothing disappointed me, but also nothing left me with deep impression. It's just a new French restaurant with good food. But I do like the services there, waiter and waitress are both super friendly and give you the attention that you should get as customers. So I give the food 3 stars and services 1 star. I picked the 2 courses menu considering I wasn't very hungry. First is appetizer, I ordered the foie gras and its just as good as I expected. I have a thing for foie gras so I cannot complaint, it just satisfies my stomach lol. Second is a main course, I wanted to order veal tenderloin but they don't have it now. So I ordered Colorado Lamb, which turned out to be a good choice too. The lamb is very tender and juicy! I loved it. My friend ordered the lobster which is also good.

5.0,9/22/2016,"What are the odds...? Good fortune more like...  (as in someone recommended Batard and gave me their reservation) that we accidentally ended up having such a wonderful meal here for my last birthday; not just a Michelin Star recognized but also a James Beard awardee restaurant.  Yay!!! Nestled in the quiet street of Tribeca... one would need to stare at each doorway to find the unassuming Batard entrance.  Once inside, you are greeted by beautiful, elegant and romantic decor with big comfy booths for couples and round tables for group dining.  We were lucky to have a corner booth table and watch the entire restaurant bustling away with attentive service.  I actually prefer this cozy dining experience over the 3hr long ones... LOL Batard has either the 2, 3 or 4 ($79! Amazingly priced for such a treat!) course tasting menu.  We went for the 4 course - 2 appetizers/starters, 1 entree, and 1 dessert.Starters: -infamous Octopus Pastrami, a bit on the salty side but goes so well with caper berries, tingling with salty/savory/tangy all over your tastebuds... Sensational.-deep fried sweetbreads, this was insanely good and we loved the texture of crispy and softy in one bite!-foie gras, layered with pistachio & olive, and spreadable onto your bread... no words.  (This was a special for that night)-quail croquette, husband loved it... Me, it was ok. The quail was too thick and the quail egg didn't really compliment it.  The presentation was gram worthy. Entree:-short rib with beef tongue and mash polenta; absolutely delicious and mouth watering good! The short rib was tender, sweet glazed, mix with the crunchy texture of the beef tongue, it will wake up your palate. -braised duck breast, again husband loved this... I actually thought the duck could use more spice... Dessert:-Milk chocolate puff pastry with hazelnut ice cream, very rich and just freaking goodness! -Carrot cake (it may sound boring but it was surprisingly delightful, airy and not overly sweet). Overall, an extremely well thought out meal, blend of texture and confusing at times for your tastebuds.  We enjoyed it very much and hope to visit for another bday occasion! ;) Enjoy this dining experience Yelpers!",2,1,2,Karen Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",216,469,1867

I like that they use ceramic plates. I felt that the restaurant might be understaffed on that day. If you live in Tribeca or downtown area, you may patronize this restaurant.

We had the three course prix fixe dinner. For starters, we had the hamachi crudo, a yellowtail sashimi dish with ginger, spring onion, cucumber and olive oil. The perfect blend of spicy and mellow flavors, the artful mix of soft and crunchy textures produce highly pleasurable sensations in the palate. For the main, we had the halibut with heirloom tomato, romano beans and basil sauce. The fish was meaty and butter-soft, and the basil sauce added the necessary punch. The desserts  were good, but not extraordinary. The chocolate torte with hazelnuts would have been better without the salty flavor. The duck egg creme brulee was a bit heavy.

Second dish we had barbecue sturgeon and the pasta, both are good. The entree then were a disaster... we had the duck and the veal (the special of the night) - the duck was little strange and the fried veal with cranberry and pineapple (?) jam was awful.... It was too much sourness in the dish with the potato salad, and the fried meat was greasy and not at all crispy.

4.0,8/14/2016,"Definitely deserves its Michelin star! The courses can be picked any way you want with the limit of one entree. We did my order with appey, main and dessert and my husband did appey, mid course and main. Started with the barbecue sturgeon served with creme freche which was delicious. Reminded me of how caviar is served (which I also love). The slaw gave it a nice zesty element and the flavors just really complemented each other. Husband got the beets linzer and the veggies were fresh and tasty. Simple dish but worth trying. We then got our rabbit wrapped in a ravioli-like pasta and served with peas for the mid course which we shared. This wasn't too special but was good. Mains we ordered the special veal schnitzel dish served with potato salad and cucumber. The potatoes and cucumber had a lot of dill which I love and the schnitzel was perfectly cooked. The batter wasn't too heavy and was a very satisfying crispy texture. I opted for the duck breast and while it wasn't the best I've ever had, it was tender enough, juicy and skin was crisped with red quinoa sprinkled on top. The sweet corn succotash that accompanied it was this amazing burst of sweet yumminess. There were also chanterelle mushrooms dropped into the duck sauce. Dessert we got the strawberries. It was ok. The strawberries were fresh and I loved the strawberry ice cream it was served with but I would have sooner gone somewhere else and just gotten a big ice cream sundae for dessert (hot summer evening and all - we actually did head over to Milk and got some soft ice cream). Also, the shortcake was a bit salty? Kind of weird...Ended the meal with a latte and they offered some dark chocolate truffles that were filled with ""marshmallow"". They were served cold and the marshmallow inside was really more like melted vanilla ice cream but it was actually really good!

Our server was both knowledgeable and friendly and his suggestions influenced our choices. For appetizers, we had the lobster salad and the rabbit pasta. Both were excellent but the pasta was amazing. If I could have poured the rich broth into a glass and drunk it, I would have. The bread was not ideal to sponge it up, but somehow I made do.  I followed that with the duck breast, which was perfectly prepared. The dorade fish course was a little too fishy for me but apparently quite tasty.

We wanted to get a bottle of wine that would go well with each of our dishes so the sommelier gave us a recommendation that would go with our price point. Very nice guy and knowledgeable! Food (tasty, well-portioned): We ordered a 2-course and 4-course in order to try more dishes but not be over-stuffed at the end. And of course, who skips dessert at a place like this. :) For the savory dishes, we ordered the octopus pastrami (accented nicely by mustard seeds), duck (came with an amazing sauce and corn garnish), halibut (least favorite of the dishes; was not outstanding or really special), lobster vichysoisse (creamy, savory cold soup), and rabbit ravioli (yum). Of the savory dishes, the duck was my favorite. For desert we got the poached pear, which was really good. The portions were pretty decent so I wouldn't recommend a whole 4 courses for one person unless you are extremely hungry and prepared to eat for several hours! I was really happy with the number of dishes we tried and sharing between the 2 and 4-course options. We each got an app and main, and shared the 2nd and 4th courses. Service (attentive): Overall the service was what you'd expect for an established, fine dining place like this. The servers were attentive to clear our plates and refresh our silverware in between courses. Atmosphere (diverse): Happy to say this place wasn't just for couples on dates, but there were groups and families also.

My friend lives in Hong Kong, so I wanted to introduce her to something different.Atmosphere: Greeted and warmly invited into the restaurant. Restaurant was full but not overly crowded. I arrived 30 minutes early and had an apéritif. The bar was empty, so it was pleasant to have a drink in a peaceful environ before dinner.Ordered: only items I orderedWine: - St. Aubin Premier Cru Clos de la Chatenière  I spent some time in Côte d'Or and found a lot of exciting and amazing wines. 1 person just completed a 10 day detox retreat, so wasn't drinking. Base on what we were all having for dinner this was the best bottle to pair with our meals.- Foie Gras: I really enjoy foie gras and tend to order it when on a menu. Foie gras is a means of measuring a kitchen. Overall, the foie gras was good but not amazing. Spring vegetables which accompanied the dish were well seasoned.- White Asparagus: something different and light. Well prepared and seasoned. - Duck Breast: who doesn't like duck breast!! ...the flavours, tenderness, and versatility you have when cooking duck breast. This was my favorite dish because it was just done perfect! - Caramelized Milk Bread: someone at the table orders this dish. I usually do not order desert so I will refrain from comments. Person who ordered this dish thought it was okay, not amazing.Digestif:  Saussignac - good and refreshing.Overall:Service is polite and professional, which is what you expect.

4.0,5/17/2016,"From the décor to the convenience of getting there, this place makes the grade.  Two happy and friendly hostesses to serve you as you enter.  Full bar with plenty to try on the drink list.  This restaurant occupies the former super popular 'Montrachet' space.  Located in a fun part of Tribeca...hip vibes and pretty clientele.  Most of the patrons were suits from where I was sitting and their food choices were like eye candy for me...so it definitely inspired me to try as many dishes as possible.  They have a neat prixe fixe style menu but it's a more relaxed structure than other resys.  For example, if you're doing the 3 course meal, you can order 3 app's, or you can mix 1 app, 1 pasta/second course, and 1 entrée.  Or you can do two app's,1 in between.  The only mention, if you want two entrée choices, they bump up the prixe fixe cost by adding a supplement - believe the waitress said $35 more.Onto the food...I decided to do the three course and selected from 1 of each category.  Note, the menu doesn't make an obvious ""line"" if you will to separate the choices so do look for the extra line spacing as your clue.  I started with the Hamachi Crudo appetizer.  It was indeed one of the freshest (raw) fish I've had in a long time.  The flavors were well balanced and was a pleasant surprise to your usual seafood/raw bar tastings.  It was served over olive oil, and topped with a ginger tampenade and cucumber slices.  Beautifully plated too. This was a surprise since this place is known for it's meat and cooked seafood.Second dish, I ordered the Saffron linguine which originally I was torn between that and their Langoustine choice.  I have a shrimp allergy so was told the Languostine was a no.  :-(  But I was still happy with my saffron linguine.  The reason I picked it was the Uni and lobster bottarga (and the bits of razor clams) made it more enjoyable.  This broth had white wine in it and something else that made it a tad salty. The linguine was fresh and al dente. As it should be.Third dish was the entrée, I ordered the Milk Braised Pork Loin.  This pork loin was so tender it went down like butter.  I highly recommend it.  Served with white mushrooms and topped with roasted foie gras and spinach.  The Roasted Foie...delicious...nice finish!My friends ordered some other outstanding dishes worth mentioning - doppio pasta (which is braised rabbit English peas and gouda...Yum!) and the Foie Gras appetizer. We also shared the Octopus Pastrami.  To our surprise, they didn't give enough ""pastrami"" which by the way, is just smoked ham.  But you should take a bite of the octopus w/ the ham to get the full experience.  Separately it was not as enjoyable but I like octopus so it was still good.  It's presentation was interesting to say the least.Sadly no room for dessert given we were stuffed from dinner.  I would have wanted to try the cheese plate and the famous milk bread dessert but I just couldn't eat anymore.  BTW, washed this all down with The Knickerbocker drink throughout the night.  It was a rum, curasau, lime and raspberry cocktail.  This place is a must try.",0,0,2,Jeannie T.,"Queens, NY",372,532,7611

I couldn't decide what drink to have so I told the server I liked elderflower liqueur and could do for bubbles. He came back with champagne splashed with StGermain. Not super inventive but ok, they take direction well. The model at Batard is that you pay by how many courses you have but certain choices have a supplemental cost.

3.0,4/13/2016,"For date night, I had a nice yet rather unmemorable meal here. The ambience is cozy enough if you are lucky (like me) to get seated at a corner spot, however seems a bit uncomfortable and formal otherwise. I can't really fault any of the dishes we ordered - everything was executed and seasoned well, however uninspired. The steak tartare is beautiful, you can't go wrong ordering this. Meticulously plated with crisps, greens, dollops of aioli, and quail egg (were tweezers involved?). The doppio pasta was just ok - mini pockets of pasta, like ravioli, with 1 half filled with pea puree and 1 half filled with rabbit; I wish it had a more satisfying bite and richer sauce. It almost makes me think diet pasta. My favorite dish was the monkfish, which has a great meaty texture and the whole plate was harmonious (I am a sucker for sunchokes). The duck breast was also quite good, one of the better ducks I've had, with crispy skin and the fat rendered out nicely. For dessert, we probably should have chosen differently. ""Chocolate"" is a chocolate mousse with vanilla ice cream and chocolate shards; a seasonal option was the ""sweet potato"" which was also a mousse with maple ice cream. Nothing quite wrong here, but where was the creativity? Perhaps our waitress should have mentioned we were ordering essentially the same dessert in different flavors?Although I appreciate the option to get 2,3, or 4 courses, nothing was quite outstanding enough for me to want to return. Our waitress was nice, but appeared quite nervous when we asked her to explain the dishes. If a restaurant chooses to go the route of fine-dining classic cuisine, it should really knock it out of the park - especially with all of the dining options in NYC.

Now for the food.....OCTOPUS ""PASTRAMI"" - braised ham hock, pommery mustard, new potatoesa cold terrine of sliced octopus tentacles with braised ham hock, of which there were exactly 2 dice shaped pieces... tiny 1/4"" cubes; the mustard was very potent, fortunately 2 tiny boiled new potatoes (size of a teaspoon) toned down the mustard taste. This dish was nothing to write home about.SCALLOPS* ($6 SUPPLEMENT) - spring garlic, citrus vinaigrette, fennel, almond oilthe scallops were ever-so-slightly-seared, one could barely taste the vinaigrette or almond oil but the failure of this dish was that the scallops were too salty AND I have a HUGE tolerance for salt!DOPPIO PASTA - braised rabbit, english peas, goudafresh pasta raviolis filled with braised rabbit was a pleasant dish however not very remarkable.SAFFRON LINGUINE - razor clams, uni, lobster bottarga, white wineA razor clam enshrouded like a mummy, by ever-so-delicate strands of linguini, perfectly thin (not pasty), perfectly al dente with a nice chewiness. The broth/sauce with the uni and lobster bottarga (roe) was a match made in heaven for this dish; this dish was THE best of all the courses, had we known that it advance.... uhhhh, we'll have 6 courses of saffron linguini, please!MONKFISH - sunchokes, candied citrus, madeira, smoked chicken justhe server brought the plated monkfish out with a small sauce pitcher of the madeira sauce which he explained was made by cooking the monkfish bones for 12 hours with a madeira reduction - wow, that sounds impressive!!! Usually fish bones creates a very sweet flavor broth but in this case the ""typical"" result did not shine through. The sauce was nothing special and the 4 huge pieces of monkfish which might have been poached were rolled in a dry spice rub that was so spicy (heat spicy) that it over-powered the fish. Sadly, I had to cut away the perimeter of the chunks of fish to ""try"" to enjoy the dish. Executive chef.... back to the drawing board with this dish!!!BRANDT BEEF SHORT RIB - black pepper streusel, grilled wagyu beef tongue, polentaa good sized portion of beef short rib fell short of being braised for hours because it was definitely lacking in flavor, totally without the rich, hearty flavors often associated with beef short ribs. The beef tongue was also unremarkable, no good sear, no good flavors - seared spam would have been more impressive!The portion sizes of all of the dishes were nice and ample, not too small, just right. Often times these multiple course meals of small plates leave you feeling hungry after the meal. Unfortunately, most of the dishes really fell short.... missing the mark - except for the saffron linguini.",2,1,0,Chantelle D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,35,17
5.0,4/11/2016,Bâtard may be my favorite restaurant in NYC and I have tried all of the Michelin two and three star restaurants.

3.0,4/10/2016,"Good spot for an upscale dinner in TriBeCa.  When I first walked into the restaurant, I had an eerie sense that I had been there before. True enough I had, the Corton used to be in this space.  The space hasn't really changed that much since it changed hands and reopened as Batard. Food: The food was good.  We had the Hamachi Crudo,  Beef Short rib, Duck, chocolate dessert and the cheese selection. The wine selection was good. We had a bottle of Pinot Noir. Atmosphere was upscale, but approachable.  The room was loud and tables were close to each other, so not good for intimate dinner.  I think if you haven't been to an extensive number of fine dining restaurants, you will appreciate Batard more (more 4 stars).  It's worth visiting once.

2.0,3/14/2016,"Maybe parties larger than two are too difficult for the staff/management maitre diva to get out of their way to properly service?? Have had great meals at Batard previously , even suggested it to others. But I will have a hard time going back after Friday dinner with friends. At previous meals I found the service ok, but just. It seemed too many people who seemed to be standing around as managers and the service hassled. Chatting always seemed a priority. Too many cooks. This was once again the case but it stood out more seeing as it took them a half hour to seat us for a reservation not a walk in.  Perhaps we could've been asked if we wanted drinks rather than have us clog the entry? The sommelier particularly devoid of an idea that he is in service. The waitress seemed so anxious to get us out that she didn't care that half our table wanted cocktails but she didn't even ask the whole table. Even when it was pointed out we wanted a cocktail, she stated no one else wanted a drink( one person had ordered she didn't make contact with others) imagine telling someone inquiring about getting a cocktail that they didn't want one not oh can I get you two a drink??  The room manager seemed to be off her game as well. No greeting just seating us at a half set table while rushing to seat a party of two simultaneously who barged ahead of us.  Just plain odd. Plenty of chatter and laughing of the staff huddling but a glass of wine took reminding several times- and never a follow up. The waitress was smiley patronizing never never asked anything after our order, the sommelier just poured occasionally which was good. The waitress apparently left and we were turned over to a waiter we never had that evening to pay the bill. The food was good although I'd say the fennel tagliatelle not flavored enough.  I would review this also in opentable but I  didn't make the reservation. I am rating it two stars for the food, which should be higher but it was colored by the service failures.  I don't think they can handle a larger party well and should get a reminder  how to manage, greet, and serve.",0,0,0,Bo H.,"New York, NY",0,4,0

As noted by others, the menu is designed to offer small to large meals based upon the number of courses. This feature also means you can span a couple of price points for dinner based upon your pocketbook. Presentations were very good; portions were appropriate and everything our party of four got came in a timely manner and without feeling like something had been setting under a heat lamp.

4.0,3/7/2016,"Let's address the big elephant in the room...what the hell does Bâtard mean?! Being a Master Googler (it's the equivalent of being a Master Somm) bâtard is a type of bread similar to baguette, but shorter. Ahh I feel like my food snobbery has just reached new food nerd levels!OK, now that I've made everyone who reads this an inkling smarter let's get to the short of my experience here: Accessible 4-course tasting ""value"" at $82, gets you elevated and technically masterful contemporary European style cuisines with a tinge of Asian flair. Artistic and well executed plates in a chic fine dining TiBeCa setting. One Michelin Star and the actual James Bear award medallion hangs above the bar near the front door. Service wasn't great and we barely interacted with our server, but the food made up for it. The room is beautifully designed, and open and airy even with a packed house. Noise levels were somewhat tolerable, but we heard every single word from the really loud couple that was sitting next us. We each got the 4-course menu and shared dishes, which turns it into an 8-course tasting menu. What a great way to try so many different plates at a somewhat affordable price, considering the high quality of the foodie experience here.Now on to what we ate! Going go cut and paste the menu to make sure I hit on all the ingredients, but again here's the short: Tuna crudo was velvety and rich, but I could have used some more acid to make it pop  more. The scallop crudo was sublime. Fennel tagliatelle was my favorite, with the smoked sturgeon having a meaty, bacon like quality to it. Short Rib and wagyu beef tongue, really well done and hits all those savory spots. Beautiful plating all around too, with every dish.YELLOWFIN TUNA: toasted quinoa, soy, german sesame oilSCALLOP CRUDO: warm citrus vinaigrette, tarragon, almond oilFENNEL TAGLIATELLE: smoked sturgeon, caviar, pernodGRILLED MACKEREL: spanish onions, black olives, carrot-ginger vinaigretteDUCK BREAST: treviso marmalade, butternut squash ravioli, king mushroomsBRANDT BEEF SHORT RIB: black pepper streusel, grilled wagyu beef tongue, polentaSWEET POTATO CRÉMEUX: steel-cut oats, pecans, maple-bourbon ice creamDUCK EGG CRÈME BRÛLÉE: spiced pineapple, verjus, mint ice creamWe made our reservation via Open Table and they remembered it was my birthday and put a candle in my dessert.

The octopus appetizer was fun and would be a close second to fois gras ($10 up charge) .The desserts were much better off a selection than almost every restaurant in the city.

3.0,1/21/2016,"Like some other reviewers, we liked Batard but probably would not return. The food was good, for the most part, but not mind-blowing. The space is beautiful, and we had one of the best tables, a corner banquette that felt much more private than some of the other close-together tables. And I think the cost was reasonable for a fancy night out.Loved all the wine we had. The lobster and yellowfin courses were great, as were the beef tartare and octopus. Our entrees, duck and short rib, were good but both undeniably dry and unevenly cooked. They tasted like they had been sitting under a heat lamp before being brought to the table. It was sad. If they hadn't been overcooked they would have been amazing. It's possible this had to do with our server...Which leads to my second gripe. While not bad, the service was kind of strange. When we first came in, the general manager seemed on the verge of yelling at the guy manning the coat check. It was intense. There are an unbelievable number of people working in this place at any given moment - the floor often seems crowded with servers, runners, etc. Given this ratio, it was weird that our server vanished for a while mid-meal when we needed more wine (Eventually an attentive sommelier, who was wonderful, noticed this). The courses were presented by a number of different people, all without any explanation or description, which was surprising given how creative the plates were. Our server reappeared by the end and brought out some gelato and cookies for our anniversary, which was lovely of her.We paid the tab with a gift card that covered the meal, with $5 left over. After taking the card, our server never returned with a receipt or a check holder. Did she think we were not planning to leave a tip? We now  have like $50 cash that we would like to give her, but do not know how. We discussed this mildly awkward situation for a few minutes, not seeing her, before finally leaving the cash under a glass like you'd leave a tip in a dive bar. Didn't enrage us or anything, but it was kind of WTF. An hour later I was still worrying about it and wondering if we should have mentioned it to someone up front just to make sure she got it.

Next, the place looks tiny from the outside, but is a strong medium-sized place once you walk in.Due to last minute dining, they only had seats available at the bar for Amanda B. and I.

I don't know, what are babies like? You know what's cheap is not drinking.The food is really good here. We had some octopus pastrami because of course we did, and my wife ate what's probably the best cod I've ever had - even doing cod is sortof funny, right? It's like a dare. ""What's the most boring food anyone can think of?"" Ta-dah, but they basically turned it into a scallop. I felt like every element on every plate was exceptionally done - everything had something about it that made you pause. Creamed spinach tasted vividly green, somehow. The desserts were remarkable too; my chocolate torte was so deep it looked like dark matter. Even the bread was great.Everything besides the food was awkward and weird. I had to flag my server down at one point because she was just...wandering around aimlessly, and we'd been ready to order for quite a while. No one ever explained our dishes for us; we had to stop them, like, ""Remind me what all this stuff is again?"" We were seated at a four-top in a mostly-empty dining room. I prefer to be at a table that's just my size, if there are like 20 of them available anyway. (We could only get reservations at 5:30, thus probably the emptiness.)So, food: brilliant; everything else; wtf.

The restaurant is cozy and dim, but not too dark.You can choose 2-4 courses from a list of appetizers, mains, and desserts. Pricing (currently):2-course: $583-course: $724-course: $82There is a cheese cart, if you happen to have room after dinner.The wine list is vast, great for the knowledgeable wine connoisseur. For cocktails, we ordered the 2 Batards.$12 Ol Dirty Batard - Jim Beam rye, punt e mes, cocchi rosa, mole bitters &$16 Inglorious Batard - fidencio lásico mezcal, grand marnier, lime, honey, bitters:Yes, I copied that from the menu. No I don't know what half of these things are. I don't know much about cocktails. They were delicious. With the Ol Dirty Batard, you get more of a kick with the Jim Beam. The Inglorious Batard is a lot sweeter with the Grand Marnier of course.Octopus ""Pastrami"" - braised ham hock, pommery mustard, new potatoes:It was a pretty generous piece of ""pastrami."" I liked it, though it was almost too much squid for me. Octopus can easily become tough, but this was not. The ham hocks remind me of the crispy skin on top of roast pork from Chinese restaurants, always delicious. I think the little potatoes balanced out the dish nicely. I think that the pastrami would have been even better in smaller pieces on top of a crostini. Foie Gras Special - celery, lentils, brioche:I believe this was an additional supplement, but it's hard to say no to foie. It was served pate style with just one piece of toasted brioche, which was crunchy & buttery. I ended up using spreading some of the pate on the complimentary bread. Brandt Beef Short Rib - lovage polenta, grilled wagyu beef tongue, black pepper streusel - The beef tongue was good. It tastes kind of like a cross between corned beef, steak, and jerky. I enjoyed the flavor. The short ribs were so tender that it didn't need sauce, but the sauce was put it over the top. The julienned vegetables were a nice touch. The polenta was not bad. I used to think I didn't like polenta, but it's growing on me. Actually I think they just make it so that the grains are very fine and end up tasting more creamy. Duck Breast - persimmon, braised endive, almonds, chervil:It's nice to see duck in an American restaurant with the skin on. It was savory & juicy. The persimmon & endive injected some sweet and bitter to the profile.Coffee & Milk ""Kardinal"" - French meringue, milk jam:This was presented in a very pretty way. Plus meringues are just fun to eat. Though it got to be too sweet once we finished it. By we, I mean I finished it.Almond Cookies were presented nicely with our check. Very nice touch. I don't know why restaurants give complimentary sweets with the bill these days. Maybe to soften the blow? lolAll in all, the dishes are presented in a way that look like sparing quantities on rather large plates, but we were quite full once we consumed that meal. Also, service was great. If I were to return, maybe I would like to try their steak tartare.",5,4,3,Joy W.,"San Jose, CA",226,557,4783

Took awhile to take drink/wine order and we had to ask someone to get our server so we could order dinner. It seemed like 3 minutes later the first course arrived. Definitely odd timing. Also took forever for the bread (very delicious) to be refilled after we asked for more.Food...a little disappointing. The pastrami octopus was interesting, but the balance between very salty and very peppery wasn't what I was expecting. The sweetbreads, while not crispy like we usually like, were very tasty. Mains...the pork loin was a bit too smoky for my liking and the short rib was a bit dry.Dessert was the chocolate tort, which was lovely. Wine list is very impressive and we ordered a nice bottle of burgundy, but took untill close to the end of the bottle for it to really open up.The resto was also louder than expected.  Thought it would be a more sedate and cozy atmosphere, but it wasn't.

2.0,12/17/2015,"Our first visit to Batard was disappointing.  We chose it because it was near to a theater in the neighborhood, and because we had never tried it.  The service was poor for such an expensive restaurant.  Maybe it was because we weren't regulars, or weren't dressed up like many of the other patrons.  When ordering, I asked our waiter for a glass of wine to complement my entree, but had to remind a busboy after my entree arrived, who brought something, but since the waiter never came over to discuss the wine's qualities with me, for all I know they just poured me whatever was open and at the front of the refrigerated unit.I had three courses.  The food, for the most part, was very good, but with two serious flaws, and at those price points ($72 for three courses), everything should be perfect.  Salad had two large pieces of kale that were so harsh and rough i stopped eating them after the first bite, completely at odds with all the other delicate leaves in the salad.  The menu listed crosnes (plural) as one of the featured ingredients, but my salad had exactly one (3/4"" long), split in half.Dorade (fish) was perfect -- very happy.  Carrot cake was good by itself -- the pumpkin schmear didn't do anything for it, the four tiny roasted blueberries were a nice touch, but the dessert was nearly ruined by the hazelnut crumble under the quenelle of ice cream -- the hazelnuts had clearly gone rancid.  I left the remainder of it on the plate.  But worse was when we mentioned this to the waiter, rather than relay this information to the kitchen, instead chose to argue and protest, saying ""I saw them prepare it this morning!""  Well, the crumble might have been made that day, but the hazelnuts it was made from could still have been rancid.Given the many other fine restaurants in Tribeca, I'm doubtful we'll return.",2,0,0,Thor S.,"New York, NY",7,26,2

5.0,11/1/2015,"James Beard 2015 Best New Restaurant award winner. Prix fixe menu with a great deal options. Batard seems to have a connection with Per Se. I don't know what it is but there is a menu framed in the woman's bathroom, it's made for the chef, in 2008, from Per Se. Thomas Keller's east coast French Laundry. I did love Per Se and French Laundry, and was surprised that then, Batard beats out Spotted Pig and Per Se in some critic's write up.Of course perfect service. Not missing a beat, everything and everywhere are seamless. Like you don't know when the water was refilled and finished plates are removed from your table. The price has not risen since they opened in May 2014. It's quite reasonable. At $55 for two course and $69 for three. I like TriBeCa, and had stayed here one late fall. It's very nice to get into the season with the leaves turning golden.Batard has excellent Burgundy, another thing to love, as I have a place there.  Their house made bread is addictive.There has never been another octopus dish that wowed me like this one except the one in Santorini, but this one is decidedly different, served as a general slice of terrine, with pastrami sprinkled, as New York as it can be.Duck breast was very tender with baked persimmons along side. It inspired me to make some dishes for those endless supply of persimmons from my girlfriend's trees back at home. A very interesting phenom. So many people dining here take photos of the food. When did it become such a thing? I mean I do it because I've been doing it for years, before there was any real social media thing, but these people either have taken after me (not likely), or that it's a thing here. In case you should feel so inspired to Instagram or FB it, there is a free wifi, ask for password and you are in. And they do charge your cell phone if you ask them, because you've used up all the juice taking photos somewhere else earlier. It's a thing here too.One of my best birthday meals: obviously beats Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare last year; and nearly on par with French Laundry, Saison and Benu, all Michelin 3 star restaurants, definitely comparable to Daniel, Coi, Jean Georges as well, and of course at a fractional cost.

Needless to say, both attempts were completely ignored. Staff didn't mention our anniversary during entire meal. My appetizer, the octopus pate, was good but no where near worth the hype. The complimentary breads served - two kinds - were absolutely dreadful (mainly because they had no salt). My main course was a very small portioned duck. Again, good, but not great. My boyfriend's veal wellington - which cost extra - was absolutely stellar though. When waitress asked me what i thought of my main course, I told her I was disappointed and still very hungry. Her response? 'Sorry to hear that - but don't worry - you still have dessert left!' That's not how you should respond to an obviously unhappy patron. My dessert course was a joke. A tiny smear of chocolate something on a large plate. Our anniversary was completely ruined.

The night I was there it was extremely busy and servers seemed to be in chaos. Wine pouring, menu presentation and direct server relationships were definitely strained for a restaurant of this caliber. I didn't get the sense of an ""intimate"" connection with the staff and felt more like I was part of the herd. I was quite disappointed with their wine program. Their wine storage (check out the wine cellar in the back) didn't seem to maintain the appropriate temperatures for the unique reds and whites. Wine pouring service was also off, as the professional did not allow me to taste the wine prior to pouring. The wine list was below average for a restaurant of this caliber.The food was quite good. My Veal tenderloin was tender and wrapped in puff pastry (a bit chewy), accompanied by sweetbreads and mushrooms.  It was a solid dish, but perhaps a bit pricey.

In terms of how much I liked each of the dishes, I liked the duck breast the most - it was perfectly prepared and the associated jus/sauce was good. The accoutrement added little to the duck so it tasted quite plain.I'd heard a lot about the octopus pastrami, but it was the most disappointing dish...perhaps because it was the one I anticipated the most. The octopus pastrami is a slice of tightly-packed tentacles cut into what looks like a slice of octopus-loaf. It was cooked with ham hock and it tasted so strongly of ham that I could almost not quite tell that I was eating octopus.

2.0,9/30/2015,"I was so disappointed in my experience last night,  although the one highlight was the Sommelier. We had an early reservation on Tuesday to celebrate our anniversary and I was very excited as I had been wanting to try Batard since they opened. The front of the restaurant staff was very nice and accommodating and as mentioned earlier the Sommelier was magnificent but everything else fell pretty flat. I've been to restaurants that felt like they had just given up and were ready to close the doors any day and judging by the lack of effort that went into the dishes, I felt that same way about Batard last night. The two little rolls to start were both quite nice. We decided to choose the 4 course tasting menu and although it's very reasonably priced especially compared to other high end establishments around town this was not worth it. We started with the octopus pastrami and I was very disappointed. It felt like some of the accoutrements were stale and just thrown on the plate. The whole dish did not taste at all fresh. We also had the pork belly and lentils and this was definitely the better of the two dishes. Our second courses were much better, the scallops were sublime and the agnolotti was also very good although a touch undercooked, still a bit crunchy. For our entrees we had the branzino, very good and the duck breast also very good if cooked a touch more than the way we ordered it, medium rare. I was ready to let the octopus pastrami slide until we received our desserts. The pear kuchen was abominable, the pears were so hard you couldn't cut them and the tart taste like a stale frozen tart you pull out of the freezer and serve before it actually thaws. The coffee and milk cardinal was basically a tiramisu that again, taste store bought last week. I didn't want to ruin our night by pointing these issues out then but I felt the need to warn people that they might want to spend their dollars elsewhere.

This is a very meat-centric menu. The options were good, just not great. We had two fine entrees but I'm not sure I'd try anything else.Recommendation- if you're on a budget do the two item prix fixe and get Octopus ""pastrami"" and beef short rib.

A trainee of Charlie Trotter and Gordon Ramsay, Glocker opened Batard in 2014 with the help of famous restaurateur Drew Nieporent (Nobu, Tribeca Grill). I waited about a year to visit because I hate visiting restaurants early on when they're still working out the kinks.My wife and I came for dinner and had the 3-course pre-fixe. We both opted to do two apps and a main which they allow. You don't necessarily have to do dessert which is pretty cool. For our first course we had the Quail Ballotine and Scallops. The Ballotine was pretty amazing and I've never had a dish quite like it. The quail thigh is stuffed with liver and other forcemeat, then trussed up like a giant sausage. It was sliced into circles and served over cabbage, caraway, pumpkin oil vinaigrette and topped with a sunny side up egg.For the second course we had the Fennel Tagliatelle and Octopus ""Pastrami."" The Tagliatelle is carefully rolled and straddled by two pieces of smoked sturgeon. There's also cavier in the pernod sauce. The Octopus ""Pastrami"" is another super creative dish which looks like a mini cobblestone road. It's essentially a octopus terrine which is pretty fun. Our final courses were the Duck Breast and Roasted Cod. The Cod was a bit over-salted, but the accompanying flavors were good. It kind of has an asian flair to it and if you like eggplant then you'll like the Cod dish. I had to try the Duck Breast - it's a staple for me whenever I visit French restaurants. It was cooked perfectly and the figs that it was served with were excellent.

Being stuck in middle of hungry and full, I chose the three course one. Octopus was definitely one thing that can never go wrong. The mosaic texture further added toward its freshness. For main course, grilled suck cooked medium rare as suggested by our waitress was one of the best I have tried in town, so juicy and silky that almost gradually melt in my mouth. Chocolate mousse was just at my expectation, nothing remarkable yet no miss either. The restaurant was not crowded at all with many empty tables when I dined here.

4.0,8/14/2015,"Recently attended Batard and was excited to try the 3 courses (4 seemed like too much).  I left feeling satisfied.  To start, the bread is divine.  I had to stop eating it.  The service was great; attentive but not too pushy. The pacing between meals was perfect.  My friend and I split apps.  I liked the octopus pastrami but would have preferred it to be warm.  The scallops were delish (but they only give 2; 3 would be perfect!) The presentation for both dishes was beautiful!! For mains, my friend had schitznel and I ordered duck breast.  I found the duck to be cooked perfectly but I was disappointed to find that the skin was not crispy. :( I also would have liked a tad more seasoning. We ended dinner with the stone frusta kuchen.  This was my least favorite dish. It was too tart for me and I wish I would have selected the coffee and milk kardinal as the server recommended.  The pre fixe is a good deal considering it is fine dining, but still on the higher price end.  Overall, I enjoyed my email and thought put into eat dish but I think there still needs to be some improvement with respect to seasoning and portion size.",1,0,0,Reesie R.,"Manhattan, NY",45,329,56

It was a nice cozy room and a lot less formal than its former iteration as Corton. We tried to order a few items on the menu when we arrived. Sadly, when we ordered (sometime around 9 and 9:30 pm), the pot au feu was gone, and there was only one schnitzel left, which was a shame because two of us wanted a schnitzel.

5.0,6/26/2015,"So refreshing to enjoy great food without the pretention, formality, and prices of more upscale restaurants.  Batard seems to be following the trend in France of more casual dining being the preference these days.  A particular standout dish, believe it or not, was the beet salad.  At first, I thought it was too small of a portion.  But in retrospect it was perfectly appropriate to the meal.  And oh so delicious -- with this sublime contrast of cool and warm, crunch and soft.   Genius.  We ordered three desserts for two people (doesn't everybody?) -- kardinal, strawberries, and stone fruit kuchen.  The kuchen was the favorite.  The service was ""okay"" -- nothing special -- servers lacked personality (maybe too many handoffs to different people?), and the servers lacked ""conviction"" when we asked questions about the dishes.  But honestly fine.  And we adored our sommelier.",0,0,0,Karen N.,"Mahwah, NJ",1,78,0

These were inventive and perfectly cooked and seasoned. I would come back here and reorder these any time.Also very good: English pea tortellini. Shoutout to the excellent bread basket as well.Decent but missing something: the branzino. The fish was cooked very well but the dish needed more acid, or something to brighten it up.

It's way too thick to call it this and if you closed your eyes and put it in your mouth you would never consider taste or texture of pastrami. Gave it to us with mustard and potatoes. Pretty dish but was just ok for me.Beet linzer...was also pretty. Wide said it tasted good. Hazlenut beet and charred greens.Duck was very tasty...best plate we had.

4.0,6/4/2015,"On a Wednesday night, I had dinner with a colleague from work at Batard in Tribeca.  He made the reservation through Opentable and, upon our arrival, we were promptly greeted and seated at a two-top with a view of the kitchen. Despite our relatively early reservation at 7:45 PM on a Wednesday, the cozy dining room was bustling when we arrived. The interior décor is welcoming and the room bathed in a slightly dim but warm light.  On the way to the table, everyone on the staff smiled or nodded, acknowledging and welcoming us. The service was very good and the servers extremely polite and knowledgeable. With the exception of one semi-long break between check-ins (during which I was hoping to order a glass of wine), service was very attentive, and fast (when I did order the glass of wine, it made it to the table shortly thereafter).  The cuisine itself was inspired, innovative and very tasty, but I was a little disappointed in my main.  At Batard, you see, you have to choose from either a two-course menu or three-course menu. Then, you pick two - or three - meals from the menu's different sections. I opted for the three course menu, selecting: (i) smoked sturgeon and caviar tagliatelli, (ii) the pork schnitzel  and (iii) an apricot compote. The tagliatelli was outstanding - fresh, light, but slightly decadent - and plating was simple yet elegant. I've never had pasta with caviar before but I HIGHLY recommend it. My next two plates, regrettably, did not keep up. I ordered the pork schnitzel because I assumed that, like the pasta, Batard would put a unique spin on it. So, when the plate arrived and two very standard-looking cuts of pork schnitzel were sitting on it, I was a little disappointed. On top of that, there was not enough lingonberry sauce to eat with those two cuts (I could've used double the amount, and I was not smothering it either), which to me was a crucial flavor element for the schnitzel. Without it, well, it tastes like breaded pork.  On dessert, I don't have much of a sweet tooth. So, all I will say is that I thought the apricot compote was ok but I wouldn't order it again. My colleague from work ordered the chocolate mousse, and that looked significantly better. I'm rating Batard four stars. The atmosphere and service are great, and I would return for that smoked sturgeon and caviar tagliatelli any day of the week. That being said, for the price (our bill - with only one glass of wine each - came out to over $100/person), I expected more from my main dish and dessert. But I would definitely return and try some other plates from the menu. I may have just had bad luck that day.",0,1,0,Stefanie M.,"Miami, FL",86,161,267
5.0,5/31/2015,"I have literally nothing bad to say about this place. Best effing meal I've had in a while. And of course it had to be in NYC... sorry LA. Let's break it down. Batard is part of the Myriad restaurant group and Markus Glocker is the chef; (first real big individual project for him). Booked a reservation literally the day before. Went in on a Wednesday night; so much ease, no resistance whatsoever. Staff, overtly friendly and accommodating as soon as we arrived. Ambiance was clean, fresh, and contemporary but in a way that didn't feel phony. Place was packed as per any fancy establishment downtown in Manhattan. Our server was super cool and not stuffy. Ukghh.. I hate having to get an amazing meal WITH the stuffiness. It's too much. My boyfriend and I wanted the whole Batard experience so we ordered all the way from cocktails to dessert. I'm not going to explain how the menu works to you because that would be redundant and you probably know how to read since you're reading this. Anyway, moving on. Ordered both the ""Ol Dirty Batard"" and the ""Inglorious Batard"" with Mezcal; both amazing. Cocktails were on point. If you wanted to just come here for drinks and sit at the bar, it would be fine since the bar space is also amazing. I usually like a dry white wine (not a Riesling but closer to a Gruner) and the server had the best suggestion even though he was no sommelier. Food, food, food. Lobster salad is a must. Some of the freshest and most pristine lobster I've had on the east coast. English pea tortellini, to die. I love me some burrata and the dish was superb. Flavor was unreal. The Branzino was killer.  Artichoke was cooked to perfection with a hint of savory spice. For dessert, the apricot compote. How can you go wrong with mint and buttermilk sorbet? It melts in your mouth. Hopefully, by this time you're not drooling. I suggest this place to anyone dining in the Lower Manhattan area. It is one of the best dining experiences I've had in downtown among the ample amount of other establishments I've tried.

Next time I will skip the hamachi appetizer, but that's just because we have a favorite hamachi appetizer (random, I know) at another place and it didn't quite beat it.

5.0,5/7/2015,"Batard is Drew Nierporent's new restaurant in the space that held Corton, and before that, Montrachet.  There has been minimal change in the tasteful decor, but change has occurred in the popularity of this space.  While Corton was a darling of the critics, it fought hard to find a customer base willing to pay its dear prices.  Batard compels customers to fight hard for a reservation.  It is that popular, and for good reason.  Prices are held down by the prix fix menu, offering 8 appetizers and 8 entrées, and for the fantastic food coming out of Batard's kitchen, it is a veritable bargain.  Two Courses cost $55, Three Courses are at $69, and the full house four course menu will set you back $79.  The appetizers are sublime, with the Octopus Pastrami and Wild Mushroom Tart my personal favorites.  Entrees include Pastas, Branzino, Veal Tenderloin, Duck Breast, Leg of Lamb etc. and they are all delicious.  My Pork Wiener Schnitzel was so incredible, I had another portion for dessert.

5.0,4/23/2015,"IN SHORT: Can food imitate art? It can when it's cooked with the creativity and technical dexterity of Markus Glocker, whose modern European dishes at Bâtard offer a conceptual freshness and energy rarely found in a meal.THE STORY: When I look at piece of truly compelling art, like a Pollock, or a Rauschenberg, or even a Koons, I'm struck not just by the beauty of the piece, but also by a greater sense of the vision of a pioneer adding to the discipline. To then find this instinct at a restaurant in Manhattan, well, that's when I knew something extraordinary was happening at Bâtard.For Bâtard is simultaneously changing the definition of northern European cuisine with ferocity and clarity, and then presenting this cooking in a warm, relaxed setting that prioritizes comfort and pleasure over sterility and politeness. The Octopus ""Pastrami,"" a beautifully composed, contemporary collage of small circles of octopus leg pressed together like found object sculpture, best illustrates what dining at Bâtard means. Meaty, smoky spices are woven throughout, with rich, pommery mustard, braised ham hock, and new potatoes rounding out the plate. Each bite explores a new balance of texture and flavor, providing a tour from dense sumptuousness to crispy lightness with a powerful clarity that never falters.Indeed, like a deeply complex Kandinsky, Mr. Glocker's food expresses volumes about his sophisticated culinary vocabulary without becoming muddled.The Wild Mushroom Tart deconstructs and abstracts what we know about the dish into an elaborate plate with bits of walnut crust and celery root that frame the tender, herbaceous bites of mushroom, while the Black Pepper Cavatelli synthesizes oxtail, green olives, and mint into a dish that marries sweet, earthy freshness with a hearty, salty jus.The Duck Breast is then more about thematic consistency. Even the color of the perfectly cooked, supple duck whose expertly rendered fat seems to melt into the pink meat below a skin that suggests crispiness without shouting it, mimics its foil of pink shallots across the plate. The sweetness of the forelle pear then complements the richness of the duck liver mousse and mushroom crepe in a surprisingly innovative and elegant combination. It is a dish balanced by a chef who is also an artist, or perhaps an artist who also happens to be a chef.Fortunately (and refreshingly), the food at Bâtard is not matched by gallery prices. Two courses from the fixed price, a la carte menu will run for $55, while those who want to try a dessert like Mr. Glocker's own Caramelized Milk Bread with blueberries and brown butter ice cream, or perhaps even another smaller plate, can expect to pay $69 or $79 for three or four courses, respectively.With the vision of Markus Glocker and the hospitality of Drew Nieporent and Myriad Restaurant Group, Bâtard is surely one of New York's best new restaurants of the past year. Yet the manner in which Bâtard innovates and evolves cuisine with stunning beauty while making it accessible to far more than just a few privileged patrons of the art is truly timeless.",4,0,0,Ali M.,"New York, NY",31,234,245

1.0,2/14/2015,"Easily gained from my reviews is that I have standards. Batard failed to meet any of the most basic.1) An odd 5 minute wait to be seated when there were at least 3 open tables (arrived on time for our Valentine's reservations), we were seated at the highest traffic of the 3 (the other two were never filled).2) Timing: we were seated for 1 hour and 25 minutes (more on this later), we waited 30 minutes for the appetizer, 20 minutes for the second course and somewhere close to 20 but not quite 20 for the entree (the dessert was quickly served, but we'd already had to make a fuss about timing at that point). Yes, we spent less than 15 minutes total eating, each course was finished asap.3) Service: I'm not sure who our waiter was. My boyfriend figured it out because he knows the restaurant industry. 1st there was a server, but when I asked a basic question about the sherry on their menu (the ONE sherry one their menu) he disappeared and never spoke to us again (he did replace our silver from time to time). 2nd there was a woman who I saw a total of three times. She also did not know anything about the sherry (""It's dry"", which if you drink wine, sherry or alcohol at all is a meaningless phrase when used entirely on its own), the second time I saw her was a silver change, and the third was when she put the entrees in front of the wrong people. I think the reason she's considered our server is because she's the one we got to take our food order, though there wasn't a check on food allergies or a chance to mention them (more later), as she scurried off immediately. 3rd, the manager was helping as well. I always appreciate when it's obvious that the manager will do all duties on a floor from serving bread to clearing. She became one of our servers as well when timing went to shit. Then we didn't see her for 45 minutes (cellphones were on hand pretty quickly, a 10:30 reservation should eat something before 11pm [bread doesn't count]).4) Food quality: a) bread, goodb) appetizer, scallops were obviously cut in half, not sure if they didn't inventory properly for a reservation required night, but for the width of the scallops, we each received 1 cut into two pieces (v. insulted). A note: there was a weird sort of creme that we assume was supposed to be a sour cream, but it mostly tasted like a bad creme fraiche, this was not noted on the menu. I'm lactose intolerant, I make this clear at prix fix places when given the chance.c) 2nd course was by far the best. The agnolotti was probably the best/only good dish of the night, and I enjoy better over at Box Kite these days. The fish was fine.d) The short rib had an awful fat layer, the halibut had that weird baby food sauce that sometimes shows up with fava beans. It tasted like a steamer table vs. a chefs kitchen.e) The chocolate thing wasn't edible. I sent back my macaroon dish when it showed up with the same sour cream stuff that had been present earlier (once again NOT on the menu), they were good enough to make one without.5) Maître de: after going through all of this on V-day, we were feeling miffed, especially given the lateness of it all, so as a note we purposefully gave the signed check over on our way out and were then followed out by the Maître de who decided the best way to handle the situation (where we'd already paid the check and were leaving) was to challenge us. ""You had 4 courses over an hour and fifteen minutes."" Why yes, we did, and the fact that we spent all that time waiting and so little time eating was not only a comment on how bad the food was, but also how behind the staff was. We'll put up with 20 minute waits for good food, but then we'll also spend more than a few minutes a dish eating (an hour and a half for 4 courses is a poorly timed meal, but generally this is covered by food being good and lingering over dishes, you can't linger when the food is that bad). This was not good food and being challenged for our dislike of the restaurant on our way out only makes the whole experience that much worse.I probably would've let this just die in the pile of restaurants we know isn't aimed towards real manhattanites with good taste if it hadn't been for the chase down.

5.0,2/1/2015,"Was in the neighborhood and had been wanting to check out Batard for quite some time.  Very happy that I did.  I went in with my friend and sat at the bar, which was about 5 seats.  I tried the Gin Watson, which was something out of my comfort zone as it contained egg white.  The Gin Watson was the perfect frothy elixir for a cold day and featured hints of citrus and gin but was still strong enough to fuel my alcoholic tendencies.  My friend had a hot drink which looked a hot toddy but was served in a beautiful glass tea pot accompanied by a cute little glass garnished with what looked like a piece of apple and cinnamon although I didn't really get a good look at the garnish.  We tried the Macon wine which was lovey and only $14 for a glass. The bartender, Candice made me an Aviation which was truly impressive and I am a fan of the classic cocktails, which predominate here. Candice was by far one of the most talented professionals that I've seen behind the bar who knew the product and offered impeccable service.  She made recommendations for us and had such a gift for crafting these concoctions.  I was really surprised at how reasonable everything was priced.   I am used to going out in Midtown and paying a lot more money for quality that can not compare to Batard.We had a few appetizers at the bar.  The Sea Scallop dish was light, crisp and refreshing, the braised artichoke with barley was also incredible and the barley cooked to perfection. I am not of fan of egg yolk so I skipped that part..  We indulged in a small cheese plate which was again, beautifully presented, and the server was well spoken, clearly communicating where each cheese was from and then describing it. We shared such an interesting dessert which tasted like some sort of a nutty chocolate mousse with what looked like miniature Hershey Kisses but was mini Meringues.  Looked similar to a Baked Alaska sans the ice cream.   Different and decadent, loved it!  I will definitely be back for dinner.  Amazing food, very reasonable prices and an attentive and service oriented staff.  I only wish the bar had more seating, and that the restaurant was closer to my neighborhood!  I would be a regular!",0,0,0,steph m.,"New York, NY",0,4,0
2.0,1/24/2015,"Are you really going to charge a $7 supplement for venison and then serve it badly overcooked? The kitchen should be embarrassed. I looked over next to me and the guy there also ended up with his meat cooked medium-well. It tasted like a cheap steak.Beyond that, I found the food quite disappointing. Everything was overly rich to the point where it was hard to even finish dishes; even the desert choices such as rice pudding and milk bread, that seemed like a relief from the overwhelming savory dishes, proved to be extremely overwhelming in flavor. There was no just no balance to anything--no acid, no control, no finesse.",0,0,0,Andy D.,"New York, NY",0,8,0
1.0,1/23/2015,"As Yelp reviewers and food critics alike praise this restaurant I was very excited to eat here on a cold January night. In the end however, I was very disappointed by the food served at Batard.  Not only was the food disappointing, but our waitress was inattentive and kept rushing off leaving us with unfinished sentences, and although the room is simple and feels modern Austrian, the walls bounce noise off of them and it is very difficult to hear when with with a group. Overall the meal was extremely salty and many of the delicate flavors, were hard to taste when paired with the dish's main elements.  This is especially a problem when the menu is structured as a tasting menu and there are many dishes. I would recommend doing no more than the 3 courses, as most of the delicate flavors will be lost with more dishes.GO WITH:Roasted venison loin--my favorite dish at Batard, the Venison was was tender paired well with a diced red cabbage.  The complimentary sauce had a dark chocolate base that was very tasty, but hard to taste paired with the venison.  The buttermilk bread was unusual with an interesting chewy/doughy texture.  Branzino-the Branzino wasn't bad, simple but salty. Arborio Rice Pudding-slightly spicy which was unusual, but as rice pudding is very creamy, the earl grey ice cream was unnecessaryBesoffener Kapuziner--a pineapple cake, and my favorite of the desserts.  Had the consistency of pound cake, and the ginger ice cream was a nice compliment.  Chocolate Torte-goodSKIP:Canadian Lobster --this dish was very bland. The lobster was served two ways: 1) poached which was boring, although I love lobster and 2) a fried ball of lobster salad, resembling tempura.  I don't want a tempura ball I could order from my local Japanese restaurant. Octopus Pastrami--one of Batard's famous dishes, I was confused and slightly grossed out by what I was eating.  I am a big fan of textures, and love gummy textures, so if you do not , do not order this dish.  The octopus itself was bland and rubbery. It was unclear what held the Octopus pieces together. Is it meat? another part of octopus? Although an interesting concept, the presentation of the octopus pastrami slab wasn't very appealing and for a restaurant with small portions, the piece of ""pastrami"" was rather large. I liked the additional of a tiny piece of braised hamhock on the plate, but the fried rye bread was cold and greasy. Happily, the two bites of potatoes were simply boiled. Braised Artichoke--one of the few vegetation options on the menu, this seems like a simple dish.  However the runny poached egg just created a soupy mess of the barley -egg yoke.  The braised artichoke was simple, but the entire dish lacked flavor. Sweet Potato Agnolotti-  This dish was fine, but the sweet potato filling was indeed very sweet and the parmesan mousseline created a very creamy sauce. Veal Tenderloin--the waitress's highly recommended main course, the veal tenderloin was very disappointing.  The veal itself was simple and well cooked, but it was wrapped in a thick dough, overpowering the delicate veal and creating more bready bites. Caramelized Milk Bread--did not have the same rave reviews as most on this dessert. The bread was dry, and just tasted like caramelized white bread, nothing special, and not delicate at all. The milk bread would have been better if it tasted like the buttermilk bread paired with the roasted venison.",3,0,1,Si G.,"New York, NY",1,6,0
4.0,1/15/2015,"Bâtard was one the most anticipated openings in 2014, due in no small part to Chef Marcus Glocker. Glocker has quite the illustrious background; with time working under chefs like Charlie Trotter and Gordon Ramsay, Bâtard was the perfect opportunity for him to showcase his talents. And Drew Nieporent's decision to do so, despite the closure of Montrachet and Corton, was a wise one, affirmed by the awarding of one Michelin star less than a year after opening. The space, although relatively small and sometimes clamorous, is far more accessible than its predecessor; there's imprinted tendrils and stalks against the yellow-tinted walls, a natural highlight against the leather banquettes and seats.The menu at Bâtard offers guests either a 2, 3, or 4-course meal for dinner, with a variety of dishes in each section. We opted for the three course option, and after a deciding on our respective dishes, were offered a choice of bread. Although they weren't serve warm, my personal favorite was the olive sourdough, which I couldn't help but get seconds (or even possibly thirds?) on. The timing was perfect before the arrival of our first courses, for which I'd gone with their signature Octopus ""Pastrami"". There's no other instance I can recall in which I've seen octopus presented in such a way; a myriad of octopus cuts are pressed together into a sort of terrine, held together by gelatin-like pastrami spices. The generous amount of pommery mustard drizzled across the plate was the ideal sharp contrast to the protein, while a variety of new potato, caper, and fried bread rounded out the textures on the plate. I spent a great deal of time trying to decide whether or not I liked the dish; while enjoyable, I'm not sure I would order it again.The Duck Breast I received as my main course was far more familiar, although it did have its own surprises. The three cuts of the roasted duck breast were well executed; the skin was crisp and savory, the fat rendered to a tee, and the protein cooked to a juicy medium. It was served with a slice of roasted persimmon, a duck liver mousse quennelle, and a mushroom crêpe, which added complementing elements of sweetness, richness, and crisp earthiness to the duck.And for dessert, I decided on the Caramelized Milk Bread, another one of their acclaimed dishes. Although I typically don't order desserts that feature dense starches, I have to admit that I was won over by this dish. The milk bread might be best described as an elevated version of french toast - the bread is moist and warm on the interior, while the exterior is crunchy and crisp, thanks to a layer of caramelized reduced milk. With a side of brown butter ice cream and a handful of mascerated blueberries, it was the ideal sweet ending to the meal.I have to commend Bâtard on developing its own character so quickly and distinctly in such a short amount of time. The food here is in a genre of its own, and is executed to a remarkable precision, a fact that still held even though the dining room was filled to the brim on the evening we visited. I have no complaints about service either, as the timing was on point and Mr. Nieporent was even present to greet us as we entered and made sure to ask how our meal went as we picked up our coats. Bâtard is still young, yes, but given the fact that it's hit all the right notes at the start, I'm hopeful that it will make a lasting mark in the future.",12,3,8,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827
4.0,1/15/2015,"In a nutshell, good food, great wine, and LOUD.  Based on the first page of their wine list, the restaurant seems to be named for the Batard-Montrachet wine region in Burgundy, and their Burgundy-heavy wine list provided some great options.  I liked how they had good wine-by-the-glass options, including some expensive Chassagne-Montrachet, which was delicious!Food presentation was beautiful and although we tried several things, my ideal 3-course meal here based on everything we tried would consist of the salmon appetizer with salmon roe, sour cream and cucumbers (perfectly cooked salmon!), the duck with foie gras and pears, and the caramelized milk bread for dessert.I also enjoyed the mignardises they gave us at the end, especially the black olive truffle!Unfortunately it was very difficult to speak with my dining companions with all the noise.",0,1,0,Velina L.,"New York, NY",283,558,9
4.0,1/11/2015,"If I had the time, talent, and resources, I'd want to create a way to blink to capture images of exactly what was transmitted to my brain from the retina! The food here was plated so beautifully, and I know my words won't do them justice. Bâtard has three different tasting course options with a decent amount of appetizers, entrées, and desserts to choose from. While Bâtard may not have the most affordable tasting menus in the city, their prices are very fair and match the quality of the food. The restaurant itself is very simply decorated and it feels like they place more importance and emphasis on the execution of the food rather than the environment. That's not to say that service is terrible*, because it's quite good on the contrary, but the soundproofing could be improved.Some standouts:Tête De Cochon (appetizer) - This was arranged in a long tube and was slightly crunchy, juicy, and so flavorful. So flavorful. The fattiness was offset by the cutely arranged radish slices and a vinegar-heavy slaw.Octopus pastrami (appetizer) - This octopus terrine with chunky ham hock had a very meaty, Japanese fish sausage taste (one I wasn't completely fond of but J and other reviewers seemed to like), and the presentation was so interesting that it was still a standout. It's still a wonder how the chef was able to make it look so...perfect. Veal tenderloin tramezzini ($7 supplement, entrée) - Medium rare chunks of tenderloin were wrapped in a puff pastry. The trumpet mushrooms and the sweetbreads really didn't have to be there to complete the dish (though they were such wonderful additions, of course); the tenderloin spoke for itself. Arborio rice pudding (dessert) - The caramelized milk bread seems to be getting most of the buzz, but I enjoyed this rice pudding more. The Arborio grains were still very much intact and firm. I also really appreciated the nutmeg and the crunchy bits (nuts?) on top. This was served with one spoonful of delicious early grey ice cream. The bitterness complemented the sweet creaminess of the pudding quite well. We went with wine to match our meal, but the cocktail list intrigued us. Who wouldn't be intrigued with names like ""Inglorious Bâtard"" and ""Ol' Dirty Bâtard""??Likelihood of another visit:Seems likely.*I did have to knock off a star because we were rushed. When confirming the reservation over the phone, we were informed that two people had a reservation two hours after ours. I felt like the entrées came out before I could even catch a moment to reflect on the appetizer. The servers also came by several times to check to see where we were along our course. Other than that, the service was impeccable and I felt like we were treated very kindly. They helped us celebrate a special occasion memorably.",7,3,5,Maki Y.,"New York, NY",288,244,358

5.0,1/3/2015,"After seeing Batard pop up on many 'best new restaurants in NYC' lists at the end of 2014, my wife and I decided to make this our stop in 2015. It's a very cozy space; with a small entrance and a dining area that, while not as small as other restaurants, is pretty much jam-packed with as many tables as possible, leaving very little space for any sort of decorative features outside of the walls (which have a vaguely Asian-inspired feel to it in the form of simple plant stalks recessed against the wall). With that amount of people jammed into a contiguous square-shaped dining area, the noise level gets quite loud here - definitely louder than your average upscale restaurant. I was also a bit disappointed in the service level; despite the rave reviews, the waiters here appear to take zero interest in conversing with the diners, and the description of the menu items are nil - the main aspect of the dish (e.g. veal, salmon) was stated, and that was it. Not really a huge problem for me, but it definitely came off as more cursory than I thought was necessary - and after tasting all the flavors on the dishes, it would have been nice to know exactly was on the plate.That aside, the food here is really, really good. There's not really a good description of the food outright (at least in my limited vocabulary), as it doesn't neatly fit into any ethnic inspiration or geographic region easily. We ended up doing the 4-course tasting and started off with two appetizers. The best was probably my wife's lobster, which was prepared two ways (poached/steamed and fried) - very good texture and flavor, but I really enjoyed the fondue that was served as a side, giving a distinctly sweeter flavor to pair against the more savory aspects. I also really enjoyed the cured salmon served with cucumbers and roe; in particular, I liked the crunchiness of the roe to match the cucumber, although it could have had a little more give - they didn't pop very easily! The cream sauce that paired with it was perfect, and the clams added a nice twist on texture (but not much additional flavor). The short rib was good and quite different; my expectation was something like a braised short rib or a sauce-heavy version that is typical at a lot of American restaurants. However, it tastes much more like delicious roast beef, with a light scattering of sesame-infused sauce on the top and served with quail egg to give it a little bit of richness. I actually liked the octopus pastrami the least - while the texturing was fine, the pastrami flavor was definitely on the weaker side, and without it, the standalone flavor of the octopus isn't enough to make the dish whole.We then moved onto the entrees, which were both standouts (at least for the meats). My wife had the duck breast, which was perfectly cooked and had a dash of creaminess from the mousse that was served on the side to give it a kick of richness. The veal was well worth the $7 supplement in how tender the meat was. It was wrapped in a light pastry that added a bit more depth to each bite, and the mushrooms on the side were a nice earthy complement to the meat. Even though it was pretty small, I also really enjoyed the sweetbread that was served - just the right size and good texture - not too lumpy! We then finished off the meal with dessert. The rice pudding my wife had was delicious, especially with the earl grey tea ice cream it was served with that helped to offset the sprinkling of nutmeg (or something similar) sprinkled on top. However, it was no match to the magnificence of the milk bread. I love brioche, so this was a good start, but the caramelizing was done perfectly - enough to make the crust glassy, but not overdone on the bread itself to make it overly heavy. The brown butter ice cream served to accentuate the sugars in the bread and made for a decadently delicious way to finish the dinner. Petit fours at the end was a very dense marzipan cookie, as well as a chocolate truffle that had cardamom-infused chocolate syrup (or something similar) inside - definitely not what I was expecting when I took a bite.The menu here is really interesting and unique; if anything, the standout of all the dishes is that there are multiple layers of flavoring going on simultaneously, and this really makes the dishes more complex and interesting to savor (hence why it would have been nice to know what all was on it!). The drink menu is solid (although the beers are a bit overpriced), and the glass of Syrah on the individual wine glass list had very good mouthfeel and struck a fine balance between fruitiness and dryness. In all, this would really get 4.5 stars from me if I could rate 1/2 stars, but I will round up because I'd like to think the service is something that can be improved for a newer restaurant - and the food is great to start with.",6,0,2,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",371,1653,169

5.0,12/26/2014,"Congrats ""Batard"" *\(^_^)/* You're my favorite new restaurant 2014. Batard opened a month ago on West Broadway in Tribeca. Lately I've gone to many different restaurants in Tribeca such as Racines, Telepan Local, Khe-Yo, and Marc Forgeon. They are all wonderful new restaurants. (Except Marc Forgeon. It's been around for a long time.) I came to Batard on a Friday night. I was, once again, very lucky to make my reservation just a day before.I will start with something not wonderful about this place because after this I will be non-stop writing about how amazing this dinner was!!! Well, the decor of this place was the only reason I took a few hearts off my rating. It is a very classy and more formal atmosphere than I had imagined, however, it was nothing special.  This may not be a bad thing depending on what type of atmosphere you are looking for. I'm sure they purposefully and carefully decided to go for this type of  decor ( 90′s ) but I prefer something more cute. (Cutie Patroller is always on the prowl in NYC for cute places and great food.) It felt out-dated especially when they are serving such modern, new american dishes.OK done!! Now I'm moving on to my 5 hearts rating part for the food!Their menu is only by the course - two course for $55, three course for $65, and four course for $75. Both of us chose three courses. The waiter informed us that our option could consist of two appetizers and one entree. Which means you don't have to choose dessert as one of the three courses. I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!! I have never seen a three course option like this before. I'm not a dessert girl so you have no idea how happy this made me! :)) After much thought my friend and I chose four appetizers and two entrees to share. I think we chose a good balance of six plates.There are eight options for appetizers and they all sounded delicious, most of which were seafood so we chose four seafood appetizers. We decided to balance out the meal by ordering two meat dishes for our entrees.Our first two appetizers were YELLOWFIN TUNA marinated radish, quinoa, camelina oil and SEARED OCEAN TROUT cured cucumber, spiced crème fraîche, clams. O.M.G. Both dishes were amazing!! The plating was so pretty and the portions were great. Most importantly, they tasted perfectly delish!! I give 5 hearts for both dishes.The second two appetizers were OCTOPUS ""PASTRAMI""  braised ham hock, pommery mustard, new potatoes and MAINE LOBSTER green asparagus, zucchini blossom, citrus rind. They were not as great as the first two dishes, but you can see how pretty the plating was. I normally don't order octopus because I can have octopus at any Italian restaurant (or any other place these days), but I saw a photo of it and thought it looked unique.Our third course (and main entree) consisted of VEAL TENDERLOIN ""tramezzini"", asparagus, mushrooms, sauce diable and NY STRIP LOIN OF BEEF braised cheek, cauliflower purée, baumkuchen, romanesco. Both dishes came with sauce, but you won't see that in the photos because I have to take a picture first. I think food photos are sometimes better without sauce so they don't look messy. I assure you that I enjoyed adding sauce to both dishes once I finished taking photos. :) At this time, I was already a little bit full since our four appetizers were such generous sizes, but I was ready to taste the veal! And how amazing that the steak was served as three different parts of beef. Both dishes were perfectly cooked at medium rare and delightful.We probably stayed a good three hours enjoying our courses and a bottle of red wine. At the end of the meal we were served their homemade cookie, too. Oh, I forgot to mention that their bread was so good. I don't eat bread unless it's special and this was! Homemade salted caraway seed roll. Yum!Overall, I give Batard 4.8 hearts which is a super high heart rating for Cutie Patroller. The last time I gave this high of a rating was my three course lunch at JUNI last month. Another minor thing, I thought they should have switched our appetizers bringing the octopus and lobster out first and the trout and tuna second. Since we were having two meats as entrees it would have been better to serve us the cooked dishes first, then the raw seafood, followed by the entrees. I think the courses would flow better that way. Listen to me!! What a  snob!! But that's my mini-thought.The place was surprisingly not very full for a Friday night, but it was raining. I can imagine some reservations got canceled. I am highly recommending you make a reservation right now before it's impossible to get in. I'm definitely going back to have the YELLOWFIN TUNAand SEARED OCEAN TROUT again. I'll also be sure to try other dishes that I didn't order this time.  I go out to eat at new places often, but not many of those places will I go back to within a few months. This place is my exception! ""Cutie Patroller is always on the prowl in NYC for cute places and good food.",14,2,3,Cutie Patroller ..,"Manhattan, NY",1916,123,850
4.0,12/24/2014,"I came here with a few friends this past week and was pleasantly surprised it lived up to the hype.  One of the members of our party showed up later, and they were happy to accommodate her two-course meal while the rest of us ordered the three-course, which left us pleasantly full (the four-course would've undoubtedly tipped us over the edge).  John Winterman was there that night and bid us goodnight as we exited.  Service was excellent, with no wine glass left unfilled for more than a few minutes and waitresses on hand for any requests.  Each course was served promptly with minimal wait.  It was Monday night, and the crowd was 30s/40s+, seemingly made up mostly of business dinners, family celebrations and dates.I had the octopus pastrami, duck breast and arborio rice pudding.  I had initially ordered the octopus pastrami as a novelty (it is high-end pastrami, after all) but really enjoyed the flavors.  While I most likely wouldn't reorder the dish, it is a great concept that works wonderfully.  The duck breast was indeed exceptional, pairing perfectly with the persimmon(?) sauce, mushroom crepe and liver mousse-- my friends tasted the dish and agreed that it was a highlight.  There was a serious case of food envy going on at that table, mostly directed at the duck, although the branzino was a favorite as well.  As for dessert, I appreciated the texture of the arborio rice pudding, but in my eyes, the highlight was the earl grey ice cream-- smooth, rich, and just oh so good.  When I initially dug into the dessert, I tasted only the rice pudding; then once I got halfway through, I found the raspberry preserves all lumped together on the very bottom (but on the opposite side from where I started spooning).  Its overly sweet taste and sticky texture perhaps might've balanced well with the slight blandness of the rice pudding and its al dente-esque grains of rice, but alas, I missed out.My friends ordered the Caramelized Milk Bread, and noted its resemblance to the Cantonese style thick toast that comes slathered with condensed milk and/or peanut butter, to which it was deemed sub-par.  They thought the milk bread was too dry and slightly bitter due to the caramelization, and they left their desserts unfinished.Bottom line: exceptional duck, but dessert is not their forte at the moment.",1,1,0,Lily D.,"San Francisco, CA",0,7,4
4.0,12/20/2014,"Excellent food. My fiancé and I went to celebrate our anniversary. We went with four courses and had a spread of cheeses. We were hungry! But I still did not walk out stuffed- it was perfect. The ambiance is nice enough. The bartender was sweet and made us great pre-dinner drinks, although I had vodka w/ pineapple purée because the drink menu was a bit obscure and whiskey heavy. The service at dinner was great- not Bouley great, but up there. The cauliflower soup was amazing. Fiancé was nice enough to switch with me because I didn't love my king salmon- a little too much fish egg for my liking. Next I had the lobster app which was un-believable. I could have had three of those and called it a night. My Branzino was almost just as good. Anything w butternut squash and I am sold. And the grilled lettuce was much better than it sounds. My only gripe is that we hated our bottle of wine. Admittedly I know nothing about wines from Burgandy. But I explained to the sommelier that we wanted a light red as there would be a lot of seafood. First he only mentioned options $75+ and when we hinted we wanted something in the lower range he recommended a $55 bottle. I kid you not it tasted like sour, tangy, juice. I had half a glass and that was difficult to choke down. Would have enjoyed the meal much more had I enjoyed my bottle of wine. Overall a good experience and we would come back- but I would go wine by the glass and have 2 apps, 1 entree and forget about dessert (unremarkable and I am dessert's biggest fan).

In total, between myself and my fellow diner, we had 8 courses. 2 were excellent, the rest simply flavorless.Some of the flavors in the starter dishes were reminiscent of a standard, run-of-the-mill average restaurant. It wasn't bad food, but given the caliber of this restaurant, I was actually bored by the time I got to my third dish.The restaurant was quite busy. A bit of an older crowd. Decor a little tired looked and a bit of a mish mosh.Service- was good. Seemed a little understaffed at first and I always find it strange when your waiter at a ""nice restaurant"" disappears halfway through the meal and a bus-boy finishes your service and brings you your check. Sommelier was very attentive. I give it a 2.5 starMy fellow diner rates it a 3.5I wouldn't go back and I would not have missed anything if I didn't try it.

4.0,11/21/2014,"This place lived up to the hype. An inventive menu with a lot more German influence than I was expecting (this isn't a French restaurant despite the name), I had some really fabulous artichokes with a poached egg to start, followed by perfectly prepared duck that came with a range of good things, best of which was some incredibly intense chicken liver mousse.  Though the portions weren't huge they were a bit bigger than I was expecting so you won't leave hungry.  Indeed, I had to talk myself into the caramelised bread dessert .. though I am glad I did. A real winner.  Couple this with a very reasonable wine list, quite a bit of space (for New York) and great service and I would go back.  My only gripe is why oh why can't you buy a real espresso machine. Offering nespresso - at $6 a shot - isn't really an alternative. I don't understand why restaurants that take such obvious pride in everything else that they do sacrifice their beliefs at the altar of crap coffee.",0,0,0,Jon H.,"Manhattan, NY",20,91,0

Service was inconsistent, I could see, across the restaurant. The one backwaiter I asked about the food couldn't tell us what, exactly, was on our plate and said our waiter could but didn't send the waiter over.

3.0,11/17/2014,"We read raving reviews about Batard, so I had very high expectations... very very high expectations. Unfortunately, it did not match up to it. To get me wrong, it is good, mainly the appetizers (despite the excess of jelly in my octopus pastrami!!!). But my entire table of 4 got disappointing with their entrees. The gentlemen took the duck - my beloved one who loves duck did not finish his plate (when he eats 2 breasts at home...). Too chewy, meh sauce. So they said.My friend had the venison beef, and not only portions were ridiculous (we could not stop laughing for 5 minutes), but although very well excuted, it lacked invention. Yet, probably the best dish on the table. I had the branzino. Nothing special about it. Really nothing.Service is nice, but it can sometimes be hard to get a bit of attention... But it is very trendy and they are all so nice! BUT please, do not  clear my plate when I am still chewing my last bite. We shared 2 deserts for 4: Black Forest and Milk Bread... Milk Bread is way too sweet, and the Black Forest is not what you expect is you come from Eastern France... but it is ok.  All in one, it was good, but not outstanding.

4.0,11/10/2014,"I came here on a double date last Friday and I had a great time.  This is the latest to come from restaurateur Drew Nieporent (of Tribeca Grill, Nobu, and what was previously Corton in the space), and Austrian born chef Markus Glocker.  Although the restaurant classifies as New American, European influences really come through at Bâtard (there are items like schnitzel and strudel scattered throughout the menu).  The restaurant does not offer an a la carte dining option, but rather diners are given a choice among a 2, 3 or 4 course menu priced at $55, $65 and $75 respectively.  I think the 3-course is perfect, and 4 would probably too much food for the regular diner unless really hungry.  The bread service is also excellent (I loved the poppyseed - it came out fresh and warm) so I would allocate room for that.Onto the menu - I like to share dishes, so my boyfriend and I got different things, but the dishes I enjoyed most between us were:1. Octopus pastrami - this is somewhat of a signature appetizer at Bâtard, and came beautifully presented. The texture was great (octopus was just the right amount of chewy) and the spicy mustard was a nice addition.  2. Veal tenderloin - definitely the best entrée of the night!  The veal was so tender and wrapped in puff pastry, accompanied by sweetbreads and mushrooms.  Totally worth the $7 supplement.3. Caramelized milk bread - I'm a chocolate dessert kind of girl, but this was worth trying.  Tasted a bit like crème brûlée, or ""caramelized French toast"" as one of my dining companions put it.  My only gripe is that the room is quite loud so not really conducive to conversation.  We sat in the middle of the dining room so not sure if that had any impact on the sound level, but if you're coming as a party of two, I would ask to be seated along the edge of the room where it is quieter.  There was also a slight wait for our 9:00PM reservation, but not a big deal since we just sat at the bar and had a few drinks (the cocktails here are really innovative and the bartenders are so friendly!).",10,0,3,Angela W.,"Manhattan, NY",223,157,65
4.0,11/9/2014,"KenScale: 8.5/10Bâtard is a new restaurant from the famed restaurateur Drew Nieporent. The last iteration of the same space was Corton, where chef Paul Liebrandt was showcasing elegant yet somewhat esoteric modern French cuisine that was perhaps not for everybody. Chef Liebrandt has since moved on to open The Elm in Brooklyn, and Nieporent replaced the space with a new, more accessible restaurant headed by chef Markus Glocker. The restaurant has since received critical acclaims across the board. When I finally had a chance to visit the restaurant on a recent weekend, I was struck by how much the space has changed. Unlike Corton's subdued atmosphere was making even a slight noise may seem like a taboo, Bâtard had that lively neighborhood atmosphere fitting for a restaurant in Tribeca. Unlike chef Liebrandt's food that could be a little too subtle at times, chef Glocker's food was much more accessible yet had elements of sophistication throughout the meal.The restaurant serves a tasting menu at a price point that is more generous than Corton (starting with $55 per person for 2 courses, $65 for 3 courses and $75 for 4 courses). I ended up getting three courses and sharing a total of six dishes with my dining companion. There was sophisticated touch with some unexpected surprises in the dishes I sampled. I liked the chewy texture of octopus ""pastrami,"" and Canadian lobster that came with carrot fondue, parsnip and chervil was also quite tasty as well with a nice balance of flavor and texture. I loved the perfectly cooked veal tenderloin that came in the form of ""tramezzini"" wrapped in dough (although I think I would've have loved the dish even more without the wrap), and the off-menu dish of fried chicken schnitzel, a reflection of the classic Austrian/German dish, was absolutely tender. Between the two desserts, I preferred the simple yet delightful caramelized milk bread that came with blueberries and brown butter ice cream, but black forest dessert chocolate sablé, kirsch Chantilly and bing cherries wasn't too far behind either. Getting a reservation here, with all the positive accolades coming lately, has been quite a challenge so make sure to book in advance. As noted above, I was a fan of the vibrant yet elegant atmosphere that wasn't too stuffy and makes Bâtard a desirable dining destination for both foodies as well as residents of Tribeca. The restaurant has a full bar with some nice wine and cocktail selections, so definitely savor your meal with a glass of wine or rye-based Dirty Bâtard. I really liked the transition of this lovely restaurant space from Corton to Bâtard, which deserves to be one of the best new restaurants in the city.",4,1,1,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738

4.0,11/1/2014,"My boyfriend and I came to Batard for dinner on a recent Monday night, having made a reservation several weeks in advance. The atmosphere was fairly upscale as was the service. Contrary to what I had read in a review somewhere, most of the diners were not dressed casually (i.e., I saw no one wearing jeans). All of this is fine with me, as I like a nice meal in a nice place now and again.We opted for the three-course menu. I ordered the beet salad, halibut, and milk bread. My boyfriend got the short rib, duck breast, and milk bread. My salad and halibut were both excellent. My boyfriend said the short rib was awful, but the duck breast was phenomenal. We both felt the milk bread was good, but nothing amazing. I think I had high expectations for that particular dish since I had read about it in several magazines. I also had two cocktails: the Aviation and the Gin Watson. I didn't really care for the Aviation because it tasted too perfumey, but the Gin Watson was great.

4.0,10/18/2014,"We went to Bâtard last night knowing that it was recently given a 1 Michelin star. We made reservations through OpenTable the day before and was able to get an 8:45 spot. Not bad for a Friday night. Food: 7.5 out of 10We opted to go for the 4 course menu. For the apps, we chose the Octopus Pastrami, Short Rib & Tafelspitz Terrine, Canadian Lobster and Pumpkin Agnolotti. I had high hopes for the Octopus Pastrami but I feel like it was lacking flavor. Texture was good and technique was great. The braised ham hock was a nice touch. The Short rib was very good but the Tafelspitz Terrine could have been elevated up a notch on flavor. The Canadian Lobster was so sweet and the carrot fondue really compliments it. I thought the Pumkin Agnolotti was so light yet so flavorful, I wanted another serving of it. I wanted to lick the parmesan mousseline from the bowl. For our entrees, we had the Pork Belly and Duck Breast. It was later on in the night on the way home . When my bf said, ""you should have seen your face when you took the first bite of the pork belly"". Same with the duck, it was tender and not as fatty as it normally is. It usually comes medium rare but we asked if we could have it medium to medium well since I'm pregnant and they happily accommodated the request. All the other elements on the plate for the duck was amazing. I wish there was two of the mushroom crepe.For dessert, we had the Black Forest and Caramelized Milk Bread. I think the Milk Bread could have been better; nothing very special to it. I was putting some of the chocolate sablé from the Black Forest on to the Milk Bread. We didn't have any wine or cocktails since I'm pregnant.Service: 6.5 out of 10I agree with the other reviews. There's so much room for improvement. After we were seated, it took about a good 10 minutes before someone came to our table. Strike 1! He came to our table and asked if (mentions name of lady) has already came to our table. Strike 2! I think they should have known if someone has or not. I think I remember him asking if we had any questions about the menu. There should have been an initiative from him to present to us all the offerings. This was his chance to sell us. But no, we had to ask how the 4 courses would be split up since we only saw 3 courses on the menu. Only then did he explain everything. He did become friendlier when he gave us the check. It also seemed like there were a lot of staff that was just walking around. Overall Experience: 8 out of 10For having recently received a 1 Michelin star, I expected more. I wasn't expecting a Le Bernardin type of service but I've had better service at some chain steak houses where I've felt more hospitality. I'm not sure if maybe because we were only a party of 2 and wasn't even drinking wine but we were kind of feeling a little ignored. Mr. John Winterman was there that night but I didn't see him attend to any guests at their table to check on their dining experience. He did say good night as we were walking out the door but I figured... you ask us now? Did you want me to sit back down and let's discuss if I had any concerns?

It was a really awkward seating arrangement because 2 were forced to sit facing no one while the other was at the end of the table (i think they did this to ensure that the one side of the room could fit the large party they were waiting for)3. Drinks came and one might as well have been a two finger splash of vodka. We said something about it but nope that was normal for this $15 cocktail... Right, so when  we see the table next to us get the same drink but it's a full glass we were kind of ticked. Then, when I was asked if id like another one I said no, 5 minutes later another one appears (full glass this time).

Negative:  I was on the wait list for that night for 3 weeks, checking in every few days, and I did not get a call that a table had opened up.  Moral: If you can't get a confirmed reservation, check Open Table that day and don't rely on the wait list.",3,0,2,Jeremy W.,"Hoboken, NJ",175,526,20
4.0,9/19/2014,"A few takeaways and tips from a lovely meal:*Dress up. I've heard people describe Batard as relatively casual, but we felt underdressed in nice tops and black denim. Basically all the men had jackets, several had ties (including Bobby Flay (!), who was sitting two tables down), and most ladies were in dresses (including Bobby Flay's wife, Stephanie March).*There are bargains to be found on the wine list. Some bottles are marked up the typical 3X or 4X, but we found a lovely Vouvray sparkling for $50 that retails for $20.*Portions are very respectable - two apiece filled us up - so don't feel like you need to go all-in with three courses or four courses unless your stomach tells you to do so. *Food was a solid four stars. Really enjoyed the trout appetizer in particular, adorned with these magical orbs of really high-quality roe.*Nice team effort by the servers, but I have to say that our waiter maybe had too many tables, because he seemed rushed, had no time for basic pleasantries, etc. Also, we walked by lots of staff on the way out, and not a one gave us a glance or wished us a good night, which, come on.

2.0,9/3/2014,"I was eagerly looking forward to trying Bâtard since the chef had previously worked at some very impressive restaurants that I have enjoyed in the past including Steirereck in Vienna, Charlie Trotter, and Gordon Ramsay.  I made an early reservation with the hope to avoid much of the noise in the dining room about which much has been written. No such luck; even at 6:30 it was noisy, compounded by the fact that my table was the first table immediately across a narrow walk way from the bar. Service was polite and efficient, but no better (guess I've been spoiled by the incredible service at Atera and Eleven Madison Park). The menu looked terrific, and I asked my server if I could order a 5th course since the menu listed pricing for 2, 3, or 4 courses. My first course was the refreshing chilled sweet corn soup with scallops, lemon balm and apple balsamic. Second course was the Maine lobster with salsify barigoule, zucchini blossom, and citrus rind that was nice. For my main course, anyone who knows me would know that I would choose the duck breast with black mission figs, mushroom crèpe and duck liver mousse. Thrilled to see 2 very generous slabs of duck breast. Imagine my horror when I realized that the duck was hard, almost impossible to cut with my knife. Gave up on the first piece after hacking away at it for a while. Same problem with the second piece. Finally, I surrendered after getting about 2/3 through. When my server came to the table, I told her that I found the duck too hard, and it would have helped if the duck had been carved into thinner slices. I never complain in restaurants, but my disappointment with this much anticipated dish was too great to let me stay silent. Desserts were excellent:  both the carmelized milk bread with blueberries and brown butter ice cream, and the epoisses with mushroom vinaigrette and cipollini and a too thin slice of grilled baguette. I asked for my check, and was further disappointed to find that no adjustment was made for the disappointing duck. Since each additional course beyond the first two was $10, I was hoping to see $10 removed from the bill. I called over John Winterman, the Managing Partner, to ask why no adjustment had been made. His response was that since I had eaten much of the dish, no adjustment was needed to the bill. Didn't seem to care that I had expressed my unhappiness with the dish. No apology was offered. I paid the bill and said goodnight to Mr. Winterman. He didn't even have the good manners to say to me that he hoped I would return and give them another chance. No problem since I have no plans to return to Bâtard.I am a welcomed guest at a number of Michelin 2 and 3 star restaurants; with service so lacking at Bâtard from management, I think it's safe to say Bâtard won't be joining their ranks anytime soon.",9,1,1,Ellen O.,"New York, NY",51,200,503

It was served with a delicate potato salad and these amazing cucumber ribbons, which were dressed with some kind of light sauce (not sure what it was, but it was tasty!)Veal: Cooked to perfection, very tender and seasoned well. Key Lime Pie: not the best I've had, but it wasn't badCarmelized Milk Bread: this dessert was amazing! the cake/bread was nicely carmelized and seemed to maybe have been grilled as well! They had a nice sized wine list with many moderaly priced wines. We tried a beaujolais and were very happy with it!We really enjoyed this place and will definitely be returning!",1,0,1,Allie K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,44,0
4.0,7/27/2014,"My wife and I came here on a Saturday night for a 9 pm reservation.  We were big fans of Corton and were excited to try this new restaurant.Like other reviewers have said, the 3 course and 4 course prix fixe are great deals.  We opted for the 4 course (2 apps, 1 main and 1 desert) as I wanted to try both the pea soup and lobster.  The pea soup was delicious, very refreshing and seasoned just right, perfect for a summer night.  The lobster was also great, fresh and perfectly flavored.  For the main, I had the veal.  Like the other dishes the veal was cooked to perfection with just the right amount of medium rare.  We asked the somm for a wine pick and he delivered a wonderful red burgundy that was both affordable and ready to drink.  As some reviewers have noted, the wine list at Batard is fairly truncated, especially for a fine dining establishment.  With that said there are nearly a dozen bottles for 65 or under which is nice. My only complaint for the food was the desert which was only okay and compared poorly to the outstanding savory dishes.  Also, as Gael Greene had complained the place is a bit noisy and is one of the noisiest restaurants of this caliber (to be fair we were there with the restaurant completely full and it did get a little quieter when around 1/3 of the patrons emptied out).  With that said, my wife and I didn't mind it too much.Overall, I would give the savory dishes 5 stars, the desert 3 stars, the service 4 stars.",7,0,0,Larry C.,"New York, NY",16,71,0

1.0,7/19/2014,"This review is about their service and not the food as I have not dined with them.My husband and I have a ritual of trying new restaurants every Tuesday night and due to the nature of our work as medical professionals, sometimes its hard to foresee changes in our schedule a month in advance.  I try my best to reschedule accordingly as soon as I find a conflict in our schedule.  Apparently, end of June to mid July, has not been a good work month for us.  I had scheduled Batard a month in advance and had canceled on them on multiple occasions (I had moved date night like 5 times according to them...which I honestly don't recall it being so many times)...but the key is I never canceled on them the night of or the week of...I cancel way, way in advance (2-3weeks) as soon as I find out that we couldn't make it to dinner.  So, of course John, from Batard, politely emails me about his concern.  ""We would appreciate your ceasing what seems to be a pattern of book-cancel-book-cancel on Opentable. We would love to have you in for dinner but I hope you understand we cannot allow you to continually hold primetime spots - which as you may not realize, prevents others from making reservations. "" This is all fine and I get it.  Although, I was a little shocked to have receive such email. But its fine and I completely understand.  I have a reservation with them on Aug 5th and I told myself that we will definitely be able to make it and so I ignored and shrugged off his email.      What got me upset in this situation is that I just received an email from open table about my Aug 5th reservation and that it is now canceled by the restaurant staff. I just responded to Johns email expressing my thoughts and that I did not appreciate him canceling my reservation.  I never intentionally tried to be a pest and I think giving them weeks notice is very considerate. I should've mentioned to him that if they really had an issue with diners canceling reservations...then they should probably take themselves off of open table...just saying. I hope they know and understand that 'shit happens' and its very rude and disrespectful of them to behave this way.  Afterall, I am the diner and there are 18,000+ other restaurants to try in NYC.",23,14,4,Gigi Y L.,"Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, NY",62,11,1
5.0,7/9/2014,"Very accessible menu and lower key than Corton. The stand out for me was the artichoke appetizer. Service was very attentive, but not over bearing.I will definitely be back again.",1,0,0,Alicia C.,"Sherborn, MA",0,8,1
5.0,7/1/2014,"I had the pleasure of dining in Batard, I'm so greatful i did. Also had the pleasure to try the prix menu of 4 chose for only $75, what a bargain. The portion size are quite larger then other fine dining places i been too which is a huge plus. The menu reflects a well rounded selection of fresh and seasonal specialties. The staffs are super nice and friendly. They can answer all question that you might have. Everyone working there is knowledgeable. Believe it or not but my favorite dish was the pea soup. The soup is light , fresh and delicious. another dish that i tried was the rabbit in flavors of bouillabaisse, this dish was amazing with saffron ravioli with a tasty rack of rabbit. Flavors are awesome and well put together. Overall this restaurant is in my top 10 list, i soon will be returning to eat here. if you get the chance to eat here i recommend trying the  rabbit in flavors of bouillabaisse.",3,0,0,Rafael Y.,"Manhattan, NY",148,116,36
5.0,6/4/2014,"I'm not sure about anyone else, but often I find restaurants in NYC to either be too stuffy/formal/lacking in atmosphere on the one hand, or claustrophobic/noisy/trying too hard on the other. For me Bâtard strikes a perfect balance. There is zero pretentiousness and a relaxed atmosphere, yet the space feels like something closer to the fine-dining end of the spectrum. And as far as the food goes - it totally delivered:We shared the pea soup with sweetbreads and the octopus ""pastrami"" to start. The octopus was a really original dish - absolutely loved it. The pea soup was even better, but perhaps that's just because I'm a sucker for sweetbreads. For the main course we shared the lamb for two. Every element of the dish was delicious. Particular shout out to the lamb bacon.To finish up we had the Epoisses (f**king awesome idea whoever came up with that one) and the Milk Bread. As you can tell, I loved the Epoisses. The Milk Bread was also a hit with both of us.We didn't have any wine, so can't comment there. The cocktails however were spot on.Our waiter was great - friendly and informative. Service as a whole was excellent. Especially so, given how recently this place opened. Last thing to mention is the menu format. Original and works well, and reasonably priced considering what's on offer.I'll definitely be going back",3,0,0,Mippy R.,"New York, NY",0,13,0
3.0,5/22/2014,"Well. It definitely isn't Corton, which used to occupy this space (more's the pity). The problem is, I'm not sure what sort of restaurant Batard is (or, as it is early days, wants to become).  Another by Nieporent (who was jovially on hand last night when we dined), Batard is meant to be more ""accessible"" with ""less-demanding"" food.If ""accessible"" means extremely, shout-to-be heard loud, then this place is certainly accessible. More tables, more large tables, and no table clothes seems to have quite an effect on acoustics.  But the thing is, (steakhouses not withstanding) boisterous places are generally not expensive places (55 for two plates and up from there) with good wine lists. As for ""less-demanding"" food, I'm at a loss as to what this is supposed to mean.  They ain't serving truffled mac and cheese or fried chicken and waffles or whatever is touted as trendy haute comfort food these days. Glocker's offerings may not be as complex as those of Liebrandt, but most menu choices are pretty sophisticated (and well-executed). Maybe ""less demanding"" is just a new term for a la carte (Corton was pre fixe). Or maybe ""less demanding"" means sayanora amuse bouche.  Seriously? With those prices? At least they had (great) bread.The staff is willing and will no doubt become able in the days ahead.  We might give it another try after they've had the chance to settle in -- though not if we have to learn sign language in order to communicate.",5,1,1,Ellen G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,16,0
