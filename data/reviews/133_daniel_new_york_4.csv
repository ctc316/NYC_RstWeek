4.0,4/29/2019,"My husband and I celebrated our 10th wedding anniversary a bit over a week ago. Although we thoroughly enjoyed our meal and service (complimentary tastings, custom celebratory menu, friendly staff, etc.), I don't think our overall experience warrants a 5-star review. The seven-course tasting menu, while well executed, did not ""blow me away"". Their bread service, however, was absolutely superb! I would suggest adding a few additional non-alcoholic cocktails for those who don't indulge. Service was friendly and attentive. However, we really struggled with understanding a few dishes due to one of the servers' heavy accent. To be so highly rated, we were surprised to see staff literally bump into each other a few times. The final letdown was the lack of ambiance. Softly played music in the background of the main dining room would've been appreciated as the clanging of cutlery isn't that romantic. I would certainly return for a future visit but not for a while as there are quite a few Michelin restaurants on my list to try.",0,0,0,Tasha H.,"New York, NY",19,119,26
4.0,4/27/2019,I took my wife here for her birthday and I really wanted to do something special for her.  The restaurant is beautiful and the ambiance is amazing.  They have different selections for dinner you can choose the four course meal pre fixe or the seven course pre fixe.  We chose the four course because we had to go to a broadway show.  I chose the sea scallops as my first meal and my wife chose the tuna.  The scallops meal for he was ok perhaps they were more raw than I had anticipated and I felt nervous about the rest of the meal.  My wife had tuna and it looked amazing presentation wise and taste wise.  I had the flambé foi gras and my wife had the crab cakes.  I am a huge fan of fois gras and was disappointed with it while it tastes good and was perfectly cooked it just lacked something my wife tasted it and she preferred it more than her own dish so we switched and I loved the crab it had Brined olives mixed in and I thought it tasted wonderful.  The third course I had the wagyu beef and my wife had the quail.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  While the portion of the beef was not a lot the quality was absolutely amazing.  The sauce that complimented the wagyu was just heavenly.  My wife's quail was equally amazing.  Lastly was the dessert and I had told them it was my wife's birthday so they brought out a dessert on the house for her.  All of the desserts were simply amazing.  We had cocktails which were amazing you must must must try the white cosmopolitan the presentation of the drinks alone was beautiful.  We had red wine with our meals and they were good also.  The fresh baked bread is heavenly.  Lastly the customer service and attention to detail is top notch.  Everyone was so nice and wonderful to us.  I absolutely will be coming back here.  Michellin Star  amazing this is a place you should dine at atleast once in your life.  If you prefer big portions of fat filled food this is not the place for you.  This is quality and superior ambiance.,0,0,0,Yasser A.,"Yonkers, NY",21,108,103
4.0,4/27/2019,"Decided to dine in the lounge rather than the larger dining room in order to have the option of ordering a la carte, but once we looked at the menu we decided to order the four-course tasting menu with the standard wine pairings. Ultimately, the price difference is negligible if you were to order a 1st and 2nd course with a bottle of wine. As expected, the meal was amazing, although my husband thought his lamb was a bit fatty. The venison with foie gras, recommend by our old-school European waiter, was one of the best dishes that I've ever had. Based on some comments online, I wasn't sure about the lounge, but it had a level of comfort and privacy that the dining room didn't seem to have.",3,0,1,Briana W.,"Foxborough, MA",16,430,147
4.0,4/25/2019,"I have dined at Daniel once a year since I moved to NYC a decade ago. My meals are always good, but never great. The dining room is spectacular, the tables are widely spaced, and the staff is  both polite and gracious. The price is steep, but not ridiculous. The voluminous wine list is top heavy, and wines by the glass are just decent. The best dishes that Daniel had years ago are all gone. The Black Bass in Potato Paupiette is gone, as is the Chestnut Veloute, and the Chocolate Souffle cake. There are no fireworks on the plate these days, just good meals. The good part is that I'm not one paying when I'm dining.",0,0,0,Randall M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,37,0

5.0,4/11/2019,"I recently came to Daniel with my fiancé to celebrate his birthday after not having been since it had 3 Michelin stars and in my opinion, nothing has changed. It was wonderful then and it is wonderful now.We opted for the 4 course pre-fix with the enhanced wine pairing.  The wine pairings were all excellent, and at times when we finished them early they were refilled.  The service was spectacular and attentive.  The staff was all personable and wonderful to interact with during the meal.  They did a very nice job adapting everything to be gluten free for my fiance, as we wanted to share all of our dishes.We ordered the following:Amuse bouche - bite size cured salmon.  Very nice, earthy and not overly strong salmon flavor.  Another bite size cracker with a blue cheese filling.  I really don't like blue cheese, but this wasn't that strong of a flavor.Cured sea bas and sea scallop rosette. Both were very good, with the scallop my personal favorite - the caviar on top was nice.  I didn't taste a lot of fennel in the scallop, which is good because i hate licorice flavor Foie Gras - this was prepared table side, flambeed and delicious with a wonderful strawberry side.  If you enjoy foie gras order this, and enjoy the show.Doversole - very light and delicate.  the potatoes were well cooked and the butter sauce was excellent.Trio of Veal - the leg was very moist and my favorite bite. There was interesting truffle flavor as well. Unfortunately one piece of the veal was a slight overcooking for my taste to a medium rather than medium rare but it was still nice.  The potatoes on this dish were also tasty.Bison - very strong black pepper flavor, but cooked to a nice medium rare.  The sauce and the veggies were very good.We opted to add an extra cheese course in the middle.  Our server picked excellent cheeses for us from the cart of cheeses, and the sommelier added an extra very tasty wine for us.For dessert, we shared the pampelmouse, which I didn't care for and the chocolate dessert, which was much better.  They also brought a fruit plate out with a candle for my fiance's birthday. You also get petite fours at the end along with a custom tailored menu with the wine pairings that you received.Overall, a very nice dining experience and I look forward to returning in the future.",0,0,0,Elyka A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",198,204,634

5.0,3/29/2019,"Everything here was perfectly executed and met the expectations of a Michelin fine dining experience.  Very formal atmosphere.  I liked how the courses were a substantial size rather than many many tiny courses.  My favorite dish was the mushroom pastry.  I enjoyed how they had some standard dishes but also incorporated some unique ingredients to mix it up a little bit.  As expected, high quality dining comes at a high price.",0,0,0,Lauren H.,"New York, NY",3,127,296

4.0,3/10/2019,"Let's set the scene: Friday night, boyfriend's 30th birthday, two people very excited to try Chef Daniel Boulud's restaurant walk through the revolving doors that have DANIEL eloquently written on them.  We're confused when we get through the doors. We're not really greeted by anyone for a minute or two before we realize we should check our coats and walk down the stairs to an unattended desk. A hostess comes over right away and leads us to our table. The room is gorgeous, beautifully high ceilings with elegant touches around the rook. All of the seats face the middle of the room, which I'm not normally a fan of but it works here. Our seats are pulled out for us to sit down (which also happens when you return from the restrooms) and were introduced to the menus by our main waiter, Allen, who's name I got at the end of the night. Allen was amazing, so attentive, explained the menu and our options and also explained every dish that was brought out. We decided to go with the seven course tasting menu with wine glass pairing. My boyfriend got the normal menu and I went with the vegetarian menu. The sole reason why this review is 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the (in my opinion) lack of creativity with the vegetarian tasting menu. I had figured if a restaurant were to have an entire separate tasting menu for vegetarians they would have put more thought into it. The menu was almost identical to the meat/fish tasting menu just without the main meat/fish. For example, when my boyfriend had the Thon (tuna and Brussels sprouts) I was served just the Brussels sprouts. Please don't get me wrong, it was absolutely incredible and I loved everything I ate, I just expected a little more. In fact, I even got an extra plate of the Brussels because they thought it wasn't enough food, which I loved! The best part of the 7 courses for me was the Riz Sauvage, wild rice with morels. My boyfriend loved everything he had and said it was one of the best meals he's ever had (comparing to other Michelin starred). The wine pairing for both of us was fantastic and the desserts were impeccable. They gave us some madeleines and an extra chocolate cake as a birthday present which was incredible and they gave us printed menus to take home that said happy birthday on them. Probably my favorite thing of the night were the breads and the wines - pastry chef is incredible and so is the sommelier. I loved the Turkish wine they served with dessert. Overall, highly recommend Daniel for a special occasion dinner. The service was 13/10 and the food was a solid 10/10.",1,0,0,Noelle M.,"New York, NY",243,69,5

5.0,3/8/2019,"Restaurant Daniel is a 2-star Michelin restaurant that is infamous for its refined European cuisine, its world-class cellar, and its attentive hospitality.

5.0,3/5/2019,"The best meal I've ever had, and I've been around the world and eaten at some amazing places. I'm not a snob, but I do love gourmet food.  I've been to the nicer establishments in L.A., Chicago, Rio, Paris, New York, et. al., but nothing was ever as incredible as Daniel.  From the moment you walk in, the service is top notch (top notch!). The wait staff is welcoming and attentive, but practically invisible otherwise. Not once did we have to ask for anything. It would just appear. My companion was even given a chair for her purse!  The ambiance is very warm and elegant. It's large and open, but feels intimate.  And of course, the best part was the food. Every single thing we ate, from the bread to the dessert, was simply amazing. Even the butter was spectacular, imported from Brittany. Every bite was an epicurean shot of morphine to your senses. I found my self frequently taking a bite of something and closing my eyes and just grinning. We had the three course prix fixe, but it was more than we could eat, what with all the extras they brought us.  At this level, I'm not sure it can get much better.

5.0,2/25/2019,"One of our favorite restaurants in NY! We made a reservation about a month before our trip and got a 9.30pm slot. Coming from the west coast it's not a big deal for us. Mens are required to wear suits. They tell you when you make a reservation and remind you a few days before too. They have different menu selections: 3/4 course menu and tasting menu. We did the tasting menu and it's so good! The whole meal took approx. 2hrs. Service was amazing, my iced tea was refilled without me asking and when the ice are starting to melt and makes my tea watery, they replaced the whole glass and brought me a fresh one! The complimentary bread selections are also very good. All the waiters/waitresses were very friendly.

2.0,2/25/2019,"I went here with my boyfriend, his brother and his brother's girlfriend. The experience was of decent food, but subpar service. For reference, I'm comparing this to Eleven Madison Park. My boyfriend's brother and his girlfriend have been to several Michelin starred restaurants and they said similar things. The restaurant's atmosphere was nice and the interior was beautiful. Our waiters were generally professional and attentive. But there were some things that were slightly off about the service. None of the waiters introduced themselves which I didn't mind, but the rest of my party noticed. One of the servers started telling us what we would be having throughout the night and told us that we would be starting with steak, which was strange, but I just accepted that this was how Daniel was. We did not have steak first. We had their starters first. The table crumbs were swept to the carpet and someone else cleaned the carpet mid-service which was a little jarring and strange. Something else that was strange was that when members of the party went to use the restroom, we were still served the next dish.The food was good. I really liked the crusted seared scallops because they were smooth and sweet. The Wagyu was tender. The chocolate hazelnut dessert was overly sweet and the apple dessert was the right amount of tart and sweet. They had a fried wonton wrapper like thing with the apple dessert which offered a nice crunch. My boyfriend and his brother got the wine pairing and I thought it was nice that Daniel does not require the whole table to do a wine pairing. The boys liked trying out the wines with each food item.I ordered a cucumber non-alcoholic drink and it was refreshing and really good. However, towards the end of the dinner, my drink was taken away without anyone asking if I was done with it and I was caught off guard so I did not tell them that I was not done with the drink. When the receipt came, they gave us the wrong receipt twice, so thank goodness we checked. The first one had items we did not order and the second one charged less because they did not include wine pairings. I don't recommend Daniel because the experience was not as good as I heard it would be.",2,1,0,Seelia C.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",1,31,1
4.0,2/24/2019,"Came here and their seven course tasting menu was delicious and memorable. The prices are definitely high, but the combined experience almost (hah) justifies it. The decor is so enchanting and beautiful. From when you first arrive at the restaurant, to the spacious interior with velvet carpeted floors and dimmed lights, the lovely bar you pass, it's honestly memorable and leaves an impression. There are many high dining places in New York, but I think Daniel is very different experience from, for example, Jean-Georges. It's a bit like Clocktower. From when you arrive, to going down the stairs, and as you wander to your seats, to the elegant bathroom, to of course, the brilliant food, it's just a very sweet experience to share. The food portions are reasonable, have only good things to say about the seasoning and sauces. When I came here a second time, and tried the Venison, that was the only dish I didn't personally like at all. Could not finish my plate for some reason. Taste was unpleasantly strong and the sauce was not enough to cut through it. Would recommend for a special night. When reserving ahead of time, ask for a more private seat, and if you mention it's a special day, staff are accommodating and provide a special dessert. Staff seemed friendly. Nothing particularly fantastic but nothing to complain about. One waitress or waiter is assigned for the whole night, and is quite attentive. Ours happened to be a very tall waiter both times, and he seemed fond of talking to us while we were seated, so we would crane our heads upwards the whole time every time our food came to the table. Perhaps step back a little lol.",2,0,2,Isaiah C.,"Cypress, CA",206,50,6

5.0,2/12/2019,"A Dinner in Paradise!Every once in a while you have a dinning experience and it makes you feel alive, makes you remember what fine dining really is...this was one of those rare experiences! We got there early just as they were starting dinner. While we were waiting for the dining room to open they sat us and made sure we were comfortable. A couple minutes later the dinning room opened and they came and got us and lead us in. My wife is 9 months pregnant and they were amazingly accommodating to make sure when we were sat she was comfortable. A minute later the matradee came by and gave my wife a small wrapped gift and said to open it when we got home. Ill fast forward for a moment and tell you it was a bib for a baby that says ""Id rather eat at Daniel and drink their finest White,"" with a baby bottle on it, super cute. Now back to the meal, we both ordered mocktails, the only two on the menu, and we were not disappointed. The meal started with a bite tasting of a play on chips and dip, amazing. Next were were served beats in three ways, each a small tasting. They were delicious! This coming from a guy who does not eat beats at all, its my one food I have told my wife never to make because I will not eat it. Then the bread came around, I suggest it all, between me and my wife we took almost one of each and shared them, each one baked fresh with a great flavor. We did the four course tasting because we were in a time bind. I did the vegetarian option. I started with: CHOUX FLEUR - Chilled ""Velouté Dubarry"", Vadouvan Oil, Pickled BatisRomanesco CauliflowerThe dish was delicious, possibly a bit on the salty side, but if so only by a hair, and I am super sensitive to salt. The pickled elements went very well with the chilled broth, creating a whirlwind of flavor packed into each bite. Next I had: KABOCHA - Kabocha Squash Gnocchi with Nutmeg, Savoy Cabbage, Chestnut, Ossau-Iraty, Hon Shimeji, Sage Brown ButterThis dish was heavenly. The gnocchi were soft and yet firm with a creamy texture as they broke apart. The flavor was packed with depth, moving through the different vegetable elements all while being tied together in the butter and herb sauce. Then I moved to:CHAMPIGNONS SAUVAGE - Wild Mushroom Fricasé, Potato ""Saint-Florentin"", Brussels SproutsThe depth of this dish was unreal. The chef was able to drum the umami to a level where it almost had a meaty taste to it. The different mushrooms in the dish gave a nice spread to the flavor as it brought in different levels to the earthiness of the dish. Then I finished with: MANDARINE - Olive Oil Ice Cream, Sweet Vinaigrette Rosemary-Bay Leaf Chantilly, Eucalyptus Meringue, Mandarin Confit VacherinThis was a playful dish, beautiful and almost edgy design. The meringue was the base of the dish, baked in an amazing thin spiral. With each bite I tried to bring in different elements and see the flavor profiles I could put together. The ice cream was subtle and sweet, the olive oil flavor just caressing the tongue, but not over staying. They finished with a tasting of chocolates made in house, try them all, they are amazing. This was for my wife's birthday, as we were leaving they gave us printed menus with what we had ordered, and saying happy birthday to her. The service was great, very smooth and accommodating. As I stated earlier we were on a time crunch to catch a show and they made sure to move the meal at a speed that accommodated out time frame, all while not making us feel rushed. Truly a magical experience.",1,2,1,Nathaniel Ħ.,"Brooklyn, NY",194,89,21
5.0,2/11/2019,"After extensive research on Yelp and reading reviews online I picked Daniel for our 20th Anniversary dinner and it exceeded all expectations. We arrived early for our reservation and were seated immediately. The team (yes you have a whole team serving you!) was wonderful from Laura who brought our bread and kept our waters topped off to Alan (hope I am getting that right), our main waiter, who introduced us to every course and helped us pick our cheeses. The maitre d' took us to see the kitchen (beautiful!) and another gentleman made sure we always had the right utensil for each course and checked on us regularly. Our sommelier picked just the right bottle of wine for us (and knew all about the vineyard! Keep in mind their wine list looks like a bible and I picked something not-so-typical, so I was very impressed). We chose the 7-course tasting menu which was all delicious and beautifully prepared, with wonderful textures and combinations of flavors. (I took a photo of each course but my camera would not do it justice). The temperature of the food was perfect and the plates were heated for the hot food so that nothing got cold--you could take your time. Speaking of time, it was a 4 and a half hour dinner and we never felt rushed or, conversely, like things were taking too long. If we had had a time crunch I'm sure it would have been faster, as the woman who called to confirm our reservation did ask if we were trying to make a show (we weren't). The final course came with a special dessert for our anniversary in addition to what was already compris and the white chocolate candle was an exotic touch. They printed up the menu for us with the wine we chose and gave us lovely little pastries as a parting gift. They even asked Laura to help us grab a cab. This was a dining experience that we will never forget and we do appreciate all of the effort that went into making it possible.

Jokes aside I was lucky enough to have my Aunt treat my family to dinner at Daniel this Saturday. It is hard to put into words the atmosphere, kindness and absolute perfection in which this restaurant runs. Every single staff member is on top of their game and clearly the kitchen too. From the presentation, to the execution, to the creativity in which ingredients are incorporated it was in a word, perfection. Also seeing the man, the myth, the legend Daniel Boulud himself chatting with guests in the dining room (I was lucky enough to have him stop by ours) was something other worldly. Someone so accomplished who seems to have remained grounded and wanting to connect with those who enjoy what he created says a lot. It meant so much to me to meet one of my culinary heroes.

5.0,2/2/2019,"I was attending a private wine dinner, and my first visit to Daniel. From the coatcheck on, the staff was super nice, and amazingly efficient and professional.The event was a four course dinner with wine pairings from the Northern Rhone hosted by La Tablee, Pressoir Wines and Guigal, so lots of industry, sommeliers galore, and a successful wine and food writer. Daniel joined us for our cheese course, shared some wine and an anecdote or two.The wines were once-in-lifetime kinda stuff, from 1978 to 2016, 12 in all, and kicked it out of the stadium.The food was, as expected, first class, with staples such as seared scallops, tuna, squab breast and venison loin each prepared with innovative touches and delicate au jus. My fav was the foie gras stuffed venison loin that was devoured before I got my camera out. The cheese course was tasty and some lemon Madeleines added a sweet closure. This is food for foodies.The restaurant itself is classy and upscale, and the bar is small - 6 stools, and tables on each side, and it fills quickly at prime time. Bar tables can be reserved. Dress in the restaurant is jacket required (and tie preferred) for men, with the bar providing more leeway in terms of dress (one young lady was in jeans!). Jackets are available at coat check if needed. The evening was amazing and a visit with the family for a treat would be nice too!",6,3,8,Robert C.,"Cortlandt Manor, NY",472,882,3071
5.0,1/25/2019,"Made a reservation for a Friday night. They do require a deposit for a reservation in the main dining room that can be $50-$100 depending on the reservation time. They have a coat check to the left as you enter. I believe they serve dinner in the lounge area as well and they have a small bar that can maybe accommodate 7 seated patrons. To eat in the main dining room men absolutely must wear a jacket. They had a la carte options, a 4 course menu, or a 7 course tasting menu. We opted for the 4, as the 7 was set. My companion was allergic to basically everything listed under the first course options, but they allowed us to substitute second course items. Between the 2 of us we had 8 items so I will only list the stars of the show. 1) the eacargot- not specifically the snails themselves (though they were delicious) the accompaniments and presentation were outstanding. They did a wonderful job with the artistic aesthetic and the ingredients (despite the portion size) I could tell were starting to fill me up. 2) the foie Gras - literally amazing. The best I've ever had (and I once ate this for 2 weeks straight) it's pan seared right in front of you and melts in your mouth. 3) the venison- though we only tried one other entree item I would argue this is the best item on the entire menu. With foie Gras at the center, order it medium rare and indulge yourself in the succulent sweet juices that make this dish delectable. The whole experience took 3 hours, we were in no rush. At the end they presented us with a personalized copy of our menu, with the date and items we'd ordered listed. The take home desert they sent with us was the cherry on top. Best with coffee the morning after your dining experience, as a wonderful way to bring it to a close. I would love to return to this wonderful establishment.",0,0,0,Keeley G.,"New York, NY",8,107,90

I always heard about Daniels and how its perfect place to come too if you wanna treat yourself nicely and in the company of others it is even better!The place is perfect balance of modern and old classic chic, and they are very prompt once your checked in to accommodate you. From the coat check to the check in process you felt very welcomed. We were very lucky to have a ""private"" corner so really didn't have to interact with everyone else dining there. I felt super lucky! We got there at 6:30pm and it was completed full around 7pm.The server was super friendly, knowledgeable, and explained everything if we had any question or mind read our complex looks while reviewing the menu. We ended up getting the 7 course tasting menu and the wine pairing (we were feeling like royalty and birthdays are big deal), the sommelier as well was extremely  friendly, knowledgeable, and explained everything.All seven dishes were divine including couple of complimentary dishes we had received, and wine was really amazing as well, they of coursed went perfect with each dish we had. My favorite wine definitely was the Honoratus Rioja Crianza ""Aurum"" Spain 2008 I could literally drink it all day.The birthday boy absolutely loved his birthday dinner, and was still surprised that he had gone. For anyone else if you do not do the tasting with wine menu I would say its roughly around $135 per person which isn't too bad, and with tasting menu then its $250 per person.

The service was outstanding- they gave me a menu detailing what I eat/drank to celebrating my birthday. The service was on their game/anticipating the need of each table. It was truly wonderful.

5.0,12/21/2018,"We came here for a birthday celebration. Had always wanted to return here with my wife and thought her birthday would be a great opportunity. The place is very nice and welcoming once you step inside the revolving doors. A small, casual bar immediately to your right and the coat room on the left. I recall having come here once as a guest in the past without a jacket and being whisked into the coat room to select one to wear for the meal. This time I was properly attired. We were seated promptly for our 630pm reservation at a table in the corner up a couple of steps with a panoramic view of the dining room. The hostess whispered to my wife that she had saved the best table for her as it was her birthday. The dining room is splendidly decorated in neo French style, with beautiful holiday decorations.Our server arrived and explained how it all works. We went with the seven course tasting menu and wine pairing.  It is always much better we feel, to have the chef and sommelier select our dishes and wine. No chance for any mismatches. There were servers everywhere and our waiter was always around but not overbearing.  We ordered cocktails a Vesper and a White cosmo. They were perfect and my wife's cosmo was served with a golf ball sized ice cube holding a flower. It was now around 7pm and the dining room was almost completely full.We were started off with a couple of interesting complimentary tasting dishes to stimulate our palates. All the food was outstanding. I am not going to go through each course but I have attached a pic of the menu. We were presented with printed menus to remember the evening.

You may not leave the restaurant being stuffed although this is about quality, presentation, service and care. You leave there feeling like you were treated like royalty.Delivery of each dish is well orchestrated. The timing is perfectly synchronized from changing silverware, to placing your plates at every turn. They even print a copy of the individual menu you had.Their manager Karim went out of his way to make sure the service was extra special and even providing a tour of the kitchen which I don't think is offered very often to anyone..

5.0,12/12/2018,"A real treat on Sunday evening: My daughter and I went to famed chef Daniel Boulud's flagship restaurant, Daniel, on E. 65th Street, off Park Ave. danielnyc.com My wife was supposed to go as well, but got sick, and insisted that we go (a financially good decision, so we didn't forfeit the deposit!).Wow. We've been to some of his other restaurants, which are excellent. This special place hits all the right marks; they've earned their Michelin stars.Jackets are required for men at this elegant French/Continental establishment. The restaurant, which has thrived for 25 years (and was full on this December Sunday evening) encompasses the space where the original Le Cirque, where Daniel Boulud made his bones, was located. The main room is beautiful, as are the adjoining rooms, but their varying decors don't necessarily seem to jibe together; I think this is because they pay homage to their varying origins, which works well historically if not visually. Their wine cellar contains more than 25,000 bottles across a broad range of offerings.You may select from a 4-course option (one dish from each of three pages, plus dessert), a set 7-course menu, two levels of wine-pairing options, an eight-course menu with truffle, a la carte, and an added cheese course. We opted to do the 7-course set menu with wine-pairings (she did the basic pairing while I did the estate level). And in a game-time decision just before dessert, we decided to add a cheese course, because we both love cheese and where better to further our education and have an experience?One advantage of the wine pairings was that we had some very engaging conversations with the sommelier each of the 8 times he brought wines to the table (one matched to each course). At the end of the evening (which started at 5:45 and ended at 10 p.m.!), the somm thanked us for our high level of attention and gave us his card.Restaurant Daniel specializes in artistic presentation of innovative creations (including a vegetarian tasting menu), with a strong nod to French origins. Service is impeccable and knowledgeable, highly accommodating, ever-present but not obsequious or intrusive. All of the staff members at every level pay close attention to detail in every element of the experience.At the end of the meal, you are presented with two parting gifts: an elegantly boxed confection of some sort (I haven't yet opened it), and a heavy-paper-stock pamphlet listing everything you had (wines on the left page, food on the right). Without listing all of the courses, I will say that the Wagyu, squab, and scallops, in that order, were our three favorite courses.

Here's what happened briefly: a representative from Daniel made contact with us and we spoke on the phone at some length. He listened carefully and apologetically, never condescendingly. We explained our issues and said we considered our experience an anomaly; we remain great admirers of Daniel, one of America's finest restaurants, and will return very soon. And now we know another reason why Daniel is so outstanding: In spite of its fame and success, the restaurant's owners and managers care about the people who dine there. They are most generous.

5.0,11/3/2018,"Daniel was arguably one of, if not my best dining experience. And it should be stated that, as expected, it was an experience. The foundation is laid by the service which is outstanding. Every individual who spent time explaining the components of our meal (big thanks to Javier and Dan) clearly demonstrated an effort to ensure we were enjoying ourselves. And they did so in an amazing performance of coordination (e.g. a server preparing foie gras table side deftly moves asides to allow another to pass while still managing the flaming vessel). I am not a ""super taster"" and subtly can be lost on my pallet. However, the best way I can describe each course is ""balance and harmony"". All the dishes were good to excellent with at least one dish per course ranking as ""one of the best of x I have every tasted"". Additionally the balance and harmony goes past flavor to embrace texture. For example the crab salad not only tasted phenomenal but the texture of the crab was, for lack of a better word, ""perfect"". The wine pairings were also excellent. The selections were clearly matched with the food with many glasses requiring the dish to become superb. This is something I love - to have a wine that is interesting but not mind blowing become something completely different when combined with food. It is easy to rave about Daniel and report nothing negative because there really is not anything negative to report. There were some subtle inconsistencies noted - e.g. the wash line of a pour varied between servers. Not a big deal but enough to get a chuckle from my wife. I am not a ""star chaser"".

Everything here is elevated to the next level, not just the food but the service and environment as well. I'd come back here in a heartbeat and let me tell you why! Food: Seasonally catered a la carte and tasting menus ensure that nothing ever becomes boring or routine - allowing you experience to be different every time. I opted for the tasting menu while my girlfriend had the vegetarian tasting menu (major bonus points). The vegetarian tasting menu was one of the, if not the best she's ever had as she enjoyed every dish that came out over the 7 courses and that's hard to do, hats off to the chefs! The regular tasting menu offered a wide variety of vegetable, seafood and meets. My favorite was probably the steak dish, which besides being cooked to perfection was paired with butternut squash puree's and other fall flavors - absolutely wonderful! I would recommend more but honestly I was just enjoying it all too much to remember it all. Honestly, most fine dining restaurants can get boring with the food, but Daniel keeps it interesting which goes a long way and makes the experience all the better Drinks: Try the cocktails, the bartenders work some darn good magic and I""m glad we opted to not do the wine pairings and stuck with cocktails. The Moonlight in Vermont was a personal favorite. Service & Ambiance: The staff is here are beyond professional, they add a personal touch to every table by getting to know their guests and catering to their needs that is much appreciated.

But the experience here was exceptional and there were no snooty attitudes. We were attended by Jhonatan and Mathew, who were amazing. We got the 4 course dinner, which allowed us to pick and share things. I've pretty much written off huge tasting menus, because I always feel sick at the end, which ruins my memory. But I'm always on a diet, so maybe I'm not used to eating a lot. If you have a big stomach and appetite, go for it. Anyway, getting to choose from different parts of the menu allowed us to share and try more stuff. We did the wine pairing, which I recommend. Wine by the bottle has expensive options, but also some affordable options if you don't want to go crazy. I loved the foie gras dish which is flambéd tableside, as well as the crab salad (cold), wagyu, and black cod (might have been sea bass-my bad). I really liked the cheese option as a dessert and wish I had not been stuffed by that time. There's all these little treats they give you in between too.

We went with the 4-course prix-fixe, and every dish was absolutely exquisite, delicious, and visually impressive. It was an especially fun experience to see our families bonding over the food, discussing who got what, guessing ingredients, etc. And contrary to my pre-conceived notions of ""small portions"" at a ""fancy"" restaurant, we all left surprisingly full and extremely satisfied.This was our first time going to a Michelin-starred restaurant, and Daniel definitely lived up to the hype. Not only was the food sublime (Daniel exceeded all our expectations!), but the service was impeccable. We actually arrived 20-30 minutes later than our reservation time (never take a cab from Brooklyn into Manhattan when the UN is in session during rush hour traffic). We called the restaurant to tell them we were running late. And from the receptionist we spoke to on the phone, to the staff who greeted us when we actually arrived, everyone was very understanding, patient, and absolutely gracious. There was not a moment we felt rushed or talked down to, and they didn't make us feel at all bad for arriving so late! This kind of service continued during our actual meal. The Sommelier was extremely helpful in selecting a Champagne for us, and throughout the meal he as well as the other servers were ""just the right amount of present"" that they were magically there when one of us had a question. Yet somehow they also weren't hovering over us so we felt like we had our privacy during our family celebration. It really felt like they could read our minds from a distance. We loved it!I'm definitely not used to fine dining because I was blown away by everything! The attention to detail, the servers' choreographed dance of bringing in each course as well as removing the finished plates. The freshly made bread was possibly the best bread I've ever had. And the chef made a personalized dessert congratulating us on our wedding (we didn't ask for that).

5.0,10/7/2018,"Hard to beat the dining experience here. From the cocktails to the coffee this place is a fantastic restaurant. My date and I were celebrating her birthday. We did not opt for the chef's tasting menu. I started with the crab, then the salmon and we finished with a shared Dover sole. The service was impeccable and the food was just phenomenal! We had a bottle of Pauillac which was a great bottle of wine but clearly not well paired to my meal....next time I'm going with the wine pairings as part of the meal. This iconic restaurant is simply the best place I've ever experienced. They pamper you in every respect",0,0,0,Michael W.,"Shrewsbury, MA",90,353,62
4.0,9/29/2018,"Great meal from first to last. We came here for their 4-course prix-fixe. It was too pricy for a regular meal, but great for a special occasion, especially because of all the desserts you get at the end, not to mention the bread. What a great selection: there were baguettes, brioche,3-seed, garlic parmesan, and buckwheat, which I thought was the tastiest. Most people liked the brioche, which was really buttery and flaky.They started us out with a parmesan sablé with blue cheese, which was okay. Then came a canapé of Long Island citrus fluke, not bad.I had the Chilled Carrot Velouté with Peekytoe Crab (chermoula cream, confit ginger, lovage oil) for the first course. It was very creamy, but too salty for my taste. Good thing they gave us plenty of bread.Then I had the Vodka Flambéed Hudson Valley Foie Gras (Pennsylvania pawpaw, gingerbread chrysanthemum salad). This was my first time trying foie gras. It was good, but too rich for me; I would have liked it better in a small dose. It would work well in a tasting menu.Then came the Quebec Roasted Suckling Pig (Heermance Farm carrots, Swiss chard, ""Sauce Crècy""). It was alright, cooked pretty well. I liked how soft the carrots were.For dessert, I had the Grand Blanco Cacao (raspberry jam, cocoa nib sablé, liquorice dark chocolate ice cream). It was tasty, the ice cream made it special. They also gave us little squares of flavored chocolates and some sort of biscuit. The best were the warm madeleines they ended us with. So tasty!As a parting gift, they presented us with their traditional Cannelé. Had it the next day and it was delicious!Service was excellent, as expected. Nice table decor also.",1,0,1,Amy Y.,"New York, NY",46,210,189
3.0,9/29/2018,"First the positives, the higher tier wine pairing for $225 and the breads are excellent.  Our sommelier served a variety of interesting wines that paired well with the food.  Unfortunately the actual food leaves a bit to be desired, my wife and I did the tasting and came away with the feeling like the chefs at Daniel are trying too hard with some of the dishes and messing up the ingredients.  Also the seating for 2 people is awful, the 2 person tables are stuck along a narrow corridor between the kitchen and the main dining room so expect a lot of foot traffic constantly so you should come with a larger group to sit in the nicer central dining area.Poularde - a mosaic terrine that would have been delicious if the layers were blended together a little more.  It seemed jarring to have such large chunks of completely different textures and flavors.Seriole - citrus cured hamachi.  It was tasty, but not much to write home about.Huitre - Partially cooked oysters, this was arguably the absolute worst dish.  The breading on the oysters was oily and soggy which did nothing for the cooked part of it while completely destroying the nice flavor of the raw shellfish.  Additionally the oysters did not taste extremely fresh either from the cooking method or just in general.  Definitely skip this if you have the choice.Saumon - Sous vide salmon finished on a grill.  The salmon was tender and moist, not bad, nothing crazy.Pigeonneau - The squab's flavor was excellent, but I'm not sure if they left this dish sitting too long before serving?  The skin seemed like it would have been crispy, but had cooled and softened up a bit before they served the dish.Cochon de Lait - My wife swapped out the wagyu with this on the tasting.  Suckling pig which was cooked well, but they removed the skin to make thin strips of pork rind as a garnish which is a shame.  Suckling pig skin is absolutely incredible off a roast pig and the fried pork rinds were just an afterthought and a poor use of the skin.Wagyu - Great piece of steak, but not high quality wagyu which is what I expect for this price point.  The meat itself was quite lean and juicy, but you don't eat wagyu for lean cuts, you eat it for the intense marbling.  This was indistinguishable from just any other good piece of steak.Dessert - Really mediocre I forgot what the dishes were, but the best thing were the fresh baked madeleine cookies so shout out to the baker again for being amazing. All in all, not the worst, wine pairing was good, bakery was excellent, actual dishes were mediocre.  Honestly if the baker just opened a side restaurant to serve gourmet sandwiches on his bread he'd make a killing.",2,0,3,Matthew C.,"New York, NY",105,30,0
5.0,9/18/2018,"This has been a long overdue review. I'm looking at photos on my phone and saw some from Daniel and it felt like we owe them a review with the amazing experience that my boyfriend and I had here. I don't remember the name of the staff but everyone was nice and approachable. I surprised my boyfriend for his birthday, we are both vegetarians and it took me a while to find a good fine dinning restaurant that offers vegetarian pre fix course/wine pairing. With that said, we ended up doing the 7-course wine pairing. It cost about $1200 with tax and tip, and I have to say, you get what you pay for!!! Our dinner lasted for over 4 hrs, and after that, they gave us a personal menu of what we had with the list of all the wines we had. I will most certainly go back here!!!",2,1,1,Lorraine M.,"New York, NY",2,11,20

3.0,9/10/2018,"Chef Daniel Boulud's flagship is tucked away in an architectural stunner steps off Park Avenue on the Upper East Side. Add two Michelin stars and expectations are naturally high. To us, the luxury felt forced, both in terms of service and atmosphere. It's by the book, classic French dining - white tablecloths, jackets required, trolleys gliding about. Frankly, there are others in the city executing classic French technique in a superior manner, with genuine hospitality and more personable environment (with air conditioning). That being said, the food was of high caliber and tasty. Wine pairings were spot on target. However, for the price paid (tasting menu plus premium wine pairing, ~1k for two plus tip), found the value to be lacking - the experience was just not that spectacular. If returning, would select the prix fixe and my own bottle from the wine list. Highly recommend the cozy bar area for an aperitif or post dinner drink.Atmosphere- Elegant, but rather staid.- Jackets are required for men, though ties are optional.- On our August visit, the air conditioning felt very weak in the dining room, making it rather warm and uncomfortable as the space filled (it looks like another Yelper experienced the same recently). This weighed on our experience.FoodDiners have the option of selecting between a four course prix fixe ($151) or seven course tasting menu ($234). We elected to try the tasting menu, which affords the chance to try many of the dishes on the prix fixe. The entire dinner took around four hours. Overall, flavor profiles were nice, execution was tight and dishes were well presented; high quality is evident throughout. Pairing and layering of flavors was deft and nuanced in most dishes. Surprisingly for a French establishment, the bread was really weak.On this evening, the tasting menu comprised of:- Lapin (Rabbit ""Porchetta"" with Chorizo): Bit of an odd texture, but the favors, especially when paired with a reisling, were balanced and interesting.- Seriole (Citrus Cured Hamachi): Cardamom beet puree complimented the hamachi perfectly. Excellent.- Huitre (Morro Bay Oysters ""Panée & Tartare""): Least favorite, could have done without the 'foraged' seaweed.- Omble Chevalier (Arctic Char Poached in a Star Anise ""Court-Bouillon""): Loved it, really liked the star anise and fennel. With the Chenin Blanc, this was an all around highlight.- Pigeonneau (Wood Fire Grilled Squab Breast): Cooked perfectly and the porcini puree and salmis lent a wonderful depth of flavor. With a glass of burgundy, what more could one want? Highly recommend.- Wagyu Strip Loin (Sauce Bordelaise): Classic flavor profile, executed well; delicious though not terribly exciting. Classic pairing with bordeaux.- Cheese Course: Selection from the trolley was of good quality.- Abricot (Vanilla Roasted Apricots, Apricot-Chai Tea Sorbet): Perfect with the Sauternes and not overly heavy.- Bolivie (Dark Cocoa Moelleux): Herb ice cream was quite unique and refreshing against the chocolate.BeverageBegan with a cocktail in the lovely bar area, highly recommend stopping by if you have the chance. The Mizumono (Mizu Lemongrass Shochu, Lavender, Mint, Lillet Rose Syrup, Lemon, Peychauds - $22) was excellent.Wine pairings are available for both the prix fixe ($82 or $142) and tasting menus ($135 or $225). We elected for the premium wine pairings with our tasting menu. In our experience, the pairings were excellent, and we enjoyed all of the wines, though value may be debatable. Service- Lacks personality and genuine warmth.- Slight air of pretension, our waiter was a somewhat unsavory fellow.- Tasks were carried out in a more mechanical fashion. Not very engaging or personable.- Gentleman servicing the bar area was great, very hospitable.",1,0,0,D. L. J.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,115,647
5.0,9/10/2018,"My overall impression is that Daniel is surely on its way to 3 Michelin Star status.The taste of the food and presentation was surely better than Le Bernardin and Jean Georges, and comparable to Eleven Madison Park and Per Se, or I dare to say even better, at least taste wise. I do not ever recall saying ""this is so good"" so many times in NYC during a dining experience and I have had a lot. Only one dish turned out to be too salty but the rest of them were flawlessly cooked. Pastry chef - I just need to say this. If not for food, you must still go to Daniel for desserts. This genius pastry chef by the name of Ghaya Oliveira will NOT disappoint you. She is extraordinary. The creativity, the taste, and the aesthetically appealing presentation all made the dining experience more than wholesome and satisfying - I was left speechless. And no other restaurants have left such impression or thrill in NYC just purely from the dessert or dish itself (only service-wise, Per Se was unbeatable for sure). I can sit down and praise the desserts over and over again.If you are low on budget, at least go to the lounge to try the dessert.

2.0,7/10/2018,"My husband and I had the vegetarian tasting menu for our 5 year anniversary dinner in June. We usually go to Jean Georges or Le Bernardin for special occasions; last year we went to Blue Hill at Stone Barns, this year wanted to revisit Daniel, where we hadn't been in 10+ years. We live a few blocks away, but we will not return. The menu was poorly conceived. It was mushroom heavy, lacked brightness, didn't in any way capture the beautiful bounty of the vegetable season which is so accessible from local farmers in Union Square! The dishes were, moreover, poorly executed. My husband accurately described one dish as, ""basically a home fry with soggy mushrooms scattered on top."" The mushrooms in that dish had been crowded in the pan and were soggy and rubbery. In another dish, the cèpe was raw on the inside, unsalted, and tasted bitter. One roasted red pepper dish not only looked awful, but tasted like the inside of a fajita! The plating, too, was lacking. Everything was beige and brown, there was too little brightness visually, many plates were finished with little squiggles and drops of brown paste (mushroom, perhaps?) which looked unfortunately like animal droppings. The flavors were dark, too, everything lacking salt, acidity, flavor. The pacing of the courses was off, with the first few coming too quickly, and the last several, especially the raw cèpe, sitting before us uneaten with our forks and knives set across the side of our plates for more than 35 minutes. Despite not lingering over any course because we enjoyed them so little, we were still at the restaurant for 3.5 hours. In mid June the roses, fields and flowers of New York are bursting with beauty and color, but the greens filling the vases in the corners of the dining room were dull and lifeless, and the décor of the dining room itself looked tired. The sommelier was excellent, so was the wine, the staff was friendly. But those few things aren't enough to bring us back when Jean Georges & Le Bernardin are so close, are so excellent. I see that this restaurant still has excellent reviews, which I can only imagine must mean that Daniel (the restaurant) understands meat more than vegetables, and/or that most reviewers are not from New York. What I really can't reconcile is how Daniel Boulud can conceive of such bright, modern, fresh dishes in his other lower end restaurants, but can't get his kitchen staff to cook a mushroom properly in this one. I am not leaving this review to be unkind, but in hopes that the restaurant improves. I am keeping my fingers crossed.",0,0,0,Sara A.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",0,17,1
5.0,7/7/2018,"Wow! My wife and I are visiting from Richmond, VA, which is infamous for its restaurant scene. I thought I knew ""fine"" dining until I experienced Daniel.We decided on Daniel to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary, and it surely did not disappoint! From the attentive staff to the incredible cuisine, everything was top notch.The first item we had the pleasure of sampling was a tiny chip with a goat cheese and mango filling, no bigger than your pinky nail. But the flavors were HUGE! Next was three different watermelon dishes, one of which had sea urchin in it. These were also phenomenal and refreshing.Our first course consisted of a Maine lobster salad lobster salad (wife), and a scallops ceviche, which I was very skeptical of ordering might I add. The scallops were incredible! I was blown away by how they just melted in your mouth. The flavors were so simple, yet complex at the same time.Next was a sea bass (wife) and the duck Foie Gras. The sea bass had a slightly smoky flavor and was served with these perfectly crispy fried broccoli florets. The Foie Gras was served over a bed of corn grits which added a slightly sweet flavor and really brought it all together! Superb!For the main course, my wife enjoyed the wagyu beef and I, the veal tenderloin. Both were so flavorful and melted in our mouth. Finally, for dessert, my wife ordered the strawberry tart which had a very beautiful presentation; she was sad to destroy it, until she tasted it. I decided to ""go big"" and order the avocado sorbet, which I have never had anything of the sort. It was incredible! It was so light, creamy, and refreshing!To our surprise, as they knew it was our anniversary, they presented us with an extra dessert which was also very tasty!Once again, from the attentive and friendly staff to the delicious cuisine, you can't go wrong here!

5.0,6/29/2018,"I don´t really have much to say and don´t really think anything that I write should influence anyone on this site that much. Daniel is the kind of place that probably transcends reviews on Yelp and this is the first time I´ve ever really written a review of a restaurant of this caliber. But I wanted to boost the ratin as it was that good.Anyway, all I can really do is mirror what has already been said. Incredible expertly-selected quality ingredients, professional preparation, and unparallelled service equal a dining experience that is second to none in my opinion and I´ve eaten at most of the other fine dining establishments in the city. Daniel is exactly what you want for that special occassion meal for an anniversary with a significant other, graduation celebration, or key business meeting. Located in probably the most upscale part of the city, Daniel´s more simple but elegant decor matches the attitude of the whole experience of refined and sophisticated eating. The dining room is surprisngly quiet and not cliché over-the-top so one can focus on enjoying the food and the experience of company with friends or family. Every waiter is incredibly attentive and helpful without being overbearing like at other restaurants. Their tableside skills are also incredible. Foie-Gras was cooked to perfection and I don't know how they do it so consistently in a tux under that kind of pressure each night. You really get the impression that they want to be there to show you the best dinner experience that the restaurant has to offer. They also have immense patience and experience. One of my companions has never had an experience like this and actually asked for his squab well-done (sacrilegious I know) and the staff and chefs actually fufilled this requeset perfectly and also helped him throughout the night to better understand everything. Even in the end, my penny-pinching friend was happy to leave a 25% tip as it was that good. In summary, go here for that special occasion. It´s incredible and Daniel will not disappoint. I really don´t understand how the restaurant is still at 2 Michelin Stars as the quality of the experience is for sure world-class and unparalled. I´ve been to Per Se, Jean-Georges, and others and I can´t think of a good reason why Daniel shouldn´t be up there as well.",3,0,0,Giorgio N.,"Pelham, Pelham, NY",1,27,38

5.0,6/20/2018,"It was a tough decision trying to figure out which Michelin restaurant to dine at during my visit to NYC! I chose Daniel due to the captivating pictures on yelp and the 5 star reviews! A few things to know upon coming here:- reservations begin 2 months in advance- there's 2 dining rooms (lounge and main room)  - main room requires men to wear suit jacket, lounge doesn't ENVIRONMENT: As we walked in through the revolving doors, we were greeted by the staff and was quickly directed to our table. From sitting down to leaving the restaurant, they paid attention to every little detail! I brought my bag and they brought a velvet stool just to put my bag on. After each bread we ate, they would come to scrape off all the crumbs. When I needed to use the restroom, they walked me towards the stairs instead of just pointing/telling me where to go. The staff was absolutely magnificent. They offered amazing recommendations and definitely knew the menu inside-out. FOOD: We did the four course prix fix, which was $151. The presentation of each plate was clean and each component in each dish complemented each other well. -SERIOLE: The presentation of this dish was rather intriguing. I love beets and I didn't know how amazing it tasted with hamachi! -PIGEONNEAU: I might have liked this dish more than my main one actually. I loved the crunchy exterior of the squab.-Can't remember the name for the last dish, but it was lamb. I'm glad that the lamb wasn't too gamey, but I thought this dish was just okay.Since I came for my birthday, they offered a birthday dessert on top of my dessert course in the prix fix! The dessert that I ordered was their version of a tiramisu. Instead of using espresso, they used more lighter flavors such as cinnamon. This was definitely one of my favorite tiramisu!! If I recall correctly, there are apple bits in here as well. I highly recommend this dessert if it is available on the menu! OVERALL: I was afraid that we weren't going to be full off of the prix fix menu, but I was very very wrong. They brought out so many additional little plates for us that by dessert, I could barely finish it. I'm still thinking about their tiramisu dessert that they have.

The service was impeccable from start to finish. The food? Amazing. Beautifully plated and elegant dishes that were still filling and satisfying. Truly a memorable meal and the perfect place for a special occasion when you simply want the best. Is there a price premium? Absolutely. Should you make reservations well in advance? Of course.

5.0,6/11/2018,"#1,385 to review...and that is from people that took the time to praise this incredible restaurant. Our first time here; my amazing fiance is a chef and owns restaurants in DC/VA/MD and we were both so excited to experience this incredible ""symphony"" because I am almost at a loss for words.I could go on about all the food we ate and describe it in detail - everyone has fantastic stories about their meals (except the mean Yelpers). My thoughts:-Beautiful room, with this wall of stunning colorful flowers.-Bernardaud China, French name of course!-Bread Service. I was told they don't count the number of times guests ask for more bread but seriously...they must...i had three portions and three pats of the butter! Having been on a low carb diet lately, I knew I would indulge. The butter...ohmygosh...and the seeded bread (warm of course)-Bathrooms: spotless and beautiful - enough said - i always check out the bathrooms!-Service. Unparalleled. Always anticipating, never hovering. An art form to be experienced. Genuinely hospitable and describing each dish as it was served to us - in detail. I can barely describe what ingredients are in my homemade Mac N Cheese.-Outstanding wine list. Even though we didn't purchase a bottle of wine, the sommelier still treated us the same as if we had purchased a bottle of Domaine Leflaive, Chevalier-Montrachet Grand Cru 2014.-Plating and the beauty of the food presentation - surpassed only when you eat it.  I imagine there is barely ANY WASTE from the plates by the time they make it back to the wash area.-A darling little velveteen purse stool that you can rest your purse - they think of everything!-Desserts. Desserts. For goodness sakes, you have a 2017 James Beard award winning Pastry Chef who started with the Daniel Boulud in 2001 and is now the Executive Pastry Chef at Daniel. Ghaya Oliveira is so talented!-Jackets required for men - yeh!!!-Personalized menu to take home with full descriptions of our meal and the date. Surprised - what a great way to remember the evening.-Each of us received a little brown box that housed a  Cannele. OK...am i the ONLY person who has never had one of these? I tried it the next morning after my 6 mile run in Central Park (needed to burn off those incredible desserts) and my eyes may have rolled back in my head. My fiance caught me eating his too!! Is there any way to purchase these and have them shipped here to DC...or wait..does DBGB DC have them? I'm going to call them!After dinner, one of the nicest managers, Daniel, asked my fiance if we would like to see the kitchen and meet the chef. It was truly an honor. It was the middle of a busy Friday during service and we met Executive Chef Jean-Francois Bruel and Eddy Leroux, Chef de Cuisine. They took the time to take pictures with us - really!

A duck and fois mosaic pate, was a highlight with walnut toast. And squab and oats and risotto was mentionable. Waygu strip with morele many ways and sweet potato frite was godly.

4.0,4/26/2018,"This was a dining experience. I have a hard time counting all the courses that I was served. We ordered the 7 course tasting menu to make sure we had a good overall feel for what they had to offer. However, they start the meal with 2 amuse bouche courses, then end it with two. It was like the food kept going and going and going.. energizer bunny style.Pictures tell a thousand words, so take a look at all my pics, I snapped everything I ate. The food was all good, but the price tag made me compare it to my overall favorite meal ever, about the same super hefty price tag, Providence in LA. Every course here looked stunning and the staff was great, but I wouldn't say every course had the taste of surprise and delight. It was good, but not necessarily worth the price. I mean, it's seriously expensive, which doesn't bother me when after each bite of something I'm having an eye closing, super yummy feeling. But not that yummy feeling with each bite here. Definitely a good feeling, but not a ""OMG"" that was awesome feeling like I had at Providence.So yes, I like it and it was more than the average experience for sure, just not ridiculously amazing.",2,1,1,Brian K.,"Irvine, CA",16,346,1264

Thank you Chef Daniel.We had the courses with wine paring, and the reason I give 4 stars because of ... First, the wine paring, some of wine it doesn't go with the food as it should.

The rich thin dark sauce packed in so much flavor, the pieces of escargot were tender, the small cubes of parsnip added texture and a balance to the richness, and the biscuit crust later made it a savory pie.

He was so nice not only came to our table to greet us like some chefs do if in their restaurant, but talked to us for more than 10-15 minutes. He asked us where we like to eat in SF and what we did for work in detail and shared some about his family.

I was told CLEARLY on the phone that we can have our baby on his stroller, and they would have room next to our table (and indeed there was plenty of room), but upon arriving that was not their policy. So, the baby in his car seat sans stroller was put on a couch, which was not an ideal/stable platform (I had my hand on his seat). Wished they told us earlier on the phone, then we would have gone to another restaurant (we almost walked out, instead of dining here, but decided to stay since we love this restaurant), more accommodating to babies. Anyways, I get the impression that babies are not welcome here, which is fine with us, but they could do a better job communicating about their policy when making a reservation.

5.0,2/8/2018,"What can I say that hasn't already been said?  Probably very little, but I felt so well taken care of after a recent dinner that I had to write it.  I was having trouble making a reservation for one on the website so I sent an email to the address listed on the Daniel site.  Heard back from them within a day and after a few emails I had a Saturday night reservation at 8pm.  I showed up a few minutes early for my reservation and was promptly seated.  I was on the upper level in the corner which was a little dark when I first sat down, but really turned out to be a great table with a view of the whole place.  I enjoyed the show I got to watch.  I decided on the 4 course menu with the older wine paring.  The longer I looked at the menu the more difficult the choice seemed to be.  I finally settled on the Beef Cheeks, the John Dory, and the Monk fish.  After some small bites I was surprised with one additional course and a paired wine, the Oyster, did they know that had been in the runnings as I was narrowing down my choices?  The courses came out at a relaxed pace with just enough time between courses.  Bread was offered multiple times, and you know I couldn't pass it up any of the times it was offered.  I ended up choosing the chocolate dessert and once again was surprised when I was brought not only my dessert choice but then also a second dessert (the Guava).  I am never one to pass up food.  As I was finishing up the petit fours and the madelines I got the opportunity to take a trip back to the kitchen to see where my meal had been put together.  What a final lovely surprise.I have been a solo diner at Michelin starred restaurants when traveling abroad before but this was my first time in NYC.  I have to say this experience was well above what I expected and rather than this meal being a 'check it off the list' kind of dinner it became a 'this is a place I would like to come back to in the future' kind of dinner.",2,0,0,Tina W.,"New York, NY",37,84,214
3.0,2/4/2018,"Let me start by saying my expectations were very high since I had a co-worker or two popping here and give rave reviews. Certainly as you walked up to the entry and drop off your jacket with the coat check, you look deep into a much larger space than you expected. Large dining room straight ahead of you and another one off to your right that's a little more secluded as well as an enclosed room for events or dinner meetings like one I was headed to.Service was okay with an initial offering of drinks and a small bar to the side in the small room. That provided everyone with a cocktail or wine to start, and appetizers passed included:- tuna cubes (good, but bland)- little pastry boats with mayo + seafood (hard to tell what it was, but was mostly passed over by the folks in the room)- steak cubes (so-so, and a precursor to later dishes, I would find out) - duck pate dumplings - the best of the lot, crispy with a burst of great flavorThe main meal, we had kataifi crusted sea scallops - the scallops themselves had no briny flavor, and the kataifi was too salty - bad balance here.Second course of the nine herb ravioli with tomato confit, olive, artichoke, herb salad and a Parmesan emulsion was tasty, and well-balanced. Pasta left a good impression on us at the table and probably the best balanced and flavored dish of the night.Third was a due of of black angus beef and braised short ribs with rutabaga puree.The Black Angus beef - disappointing. I grew up where they raise this, and this meat tasted flavorless and as if frozen for a long time. If your steak needs sauce, that's not a good steak. The braised short ribs were much better - very good portioning (consistently size cubes) for all of us at the table, and flavor was good.Dessert was mandarin confit vacherin, with a eucalyptus meringue with olive oil ice cream and some people may have liked the sour; I was left wanting a simple plain vanilla ice cream to clear my palate (which there wasn't), it wasn't around. Dessert was somewhat made up with the mini Madeleines, fresh out of the oven and super-tasty.Overall service during the meal was mostly to fill water, wine and pick up / take plates. Interestingly enough didn't clean off the bread crumbs on the table until nearly dessert. They were mostly out of the way though periodically with such a busy table they needed to figure out when to remove glasses and plates and come back for others.I'm ok with the service, mixed with the food- some very good mixed with very disappointing. Good dinner conversation distracted and plenty of wine, plus we were given the privacy of our own room for the twenty of us, but I'm not sure such a massive same preparation turned out to be anything more than a wedding dinner in disguise - lots of money, not a lot of the taste I'd been expecting from a place so hyped.Maybe this will be better as a smaller group in the future, but I would skip with another large group.",3,2,6,Hank C.,"Jersey City, NJ",1732,2830,1188
5.0,2/2/2018,"First I have to tell you that this was probably one of the most exceptional dining experiences I've ever had in my life. My sister-in-law and I were New York together for only for a few days and wanted one dinner to be really special. To be honest after reading about Daniel, dabbling in Netflix Chef's Table series, we wanted to try a dinning experience that was on a different level than we have access to where we are from in metro Detroit. The food and service were not a disappointment. I've been to New York many times and this was my first time coming back as an adult not having to sleep on friends couches with any kind of money to spend. I'm happy to say that I am completely satisfied that I spent a chunk of it Daniel. And would again. My sister and I had a seven course tasting menu with the wine pairing. It was everything that we thought it would be and the only thing that made it better, was the personable, and Surprisingly unpretentious service that we received. The menu was well thought out, and allowed us to try some things that we never would have otherwise. Mostly because the really good Brunello that we had was probably making us a bit more adventurous than we expected to be. And probably a bit more loquacious then the waitstaff was used too ..however they were so kind and put up with our slightly inappropriate jokes and overenthusiastic natures (#wine). Our captain Mynor and his associate Daniela, and their subsequent support staff made this evening so next level for my sister and I, with the general manager even offering to show us the kitchen and meet the chef before we left. The gracious kitchen staff were polite,  and didn't seem too irritated by our intrusion :) for which we can't say how grateful we were because we are truly in awe of the artistry it takes to do what you do, in the environment that you do it in. Please know that all of your efforts were truly appreciated by at least two very impressed patrons that evening. Thank you. We won't forget it.",0,0,1,Amy C.,"Birmingham, MI",0,78,5

Five stars for the food, five stars for the service, and five stars overall.My husband made a reservation for our anniversary dinner on Saturday at 5:30pm. We were immediately greeted by the staff. We checked our coats and got seated at a comfy couch area with a very nice view of the interior of the restaurant (as you can see from the attached photos). We did the the four course prix fixe.1. Seriole (wasabi marinated Hamachi) and Pintade (guinea hen with Rhum  Foie Gras and Black Trumpet)  as our first course. Excellent. Excellent. I am usually not a fan of Hamachi, but when I tried the Hamachi that my husband ordered, and it almost changed my whole impression of other fish dishes. Pintade was indisputably great; no word needed.2. Pedrix Rouge and Foie Gras for our second course. We were mesmerized by the fire show (?) when the chef served the Foie Gras. Foie Gras would be my favorite dish out of all the courses.3. Boeuf and Chevreuil for our third course. The beef striploin and Venison both tasted amazing, and the portion was also very satisfying. I was getting full and got worried that I would not be able to appreciate these excellent quality of food, but the quality did not disappoint.4. Elvissa and Mont-blanc as our dessert. Plus a complimentary dessert prepared by Daniel and a Cannale to take home. Every single dish including the Amuse bouche and complimentary bread was also very delicious. They gave a printout of the menu including the meals that we ordered. I can't help but repeat the words ""delicious"" and ""excellent"". Thank you for giving us an enjoyable dining experience.

5.0,1/21/2018,"I had just had dinner downtown which ended with a really disappointing dessert. Was heading home and decided to have dessert here at Restaurant Daniel. The restaurant was almost void of patrons as it was near closing time but the staff was accommodating, pleasant and professional at all times. The dessert menu looked impressive. Tried the Opera cake, the Bolivie, the Itakuja, the Elvisia, and a selection of artisanal cheeses from around the world. Aside from the cheeses, the desserts were primarily dark chocolate and came in unique forms and combined with exotic ingredients. While waiting for the desserts to arrive, a complimentary basket of warm madeleines were provided to guarantee a truly indulgent experience.In order of favorites:The Bolivie consisted of chocolate dentelle, cru sauvage bavaroise roasted cocoa nib, ma khaen berry ice cream, smoked Mexican vanilla - chocolate cremeux . I saw chocolate, cocoa nibs, and ice cream and knew this was going to be good.. and it was outstanding. Rich and creamy with a crunch. Main flavor is chocolateThe Opera cake consisted of Sumatra coffee cream, almond caramel joconde, bataks berry dark chocolate ganache. A classic French dessert - rich, chocolatey and goodThe Elvisia consisted of Dominican Republic dark chocolate, cranberry bavaroise, Grand Marnier gelee, spice bush berry ganache, and pine needle ice cream. The combination of flavors here was interesting and appreciatedThe Itakuja consisted of green cardamom infused dark chocolate, passion fruit and Brazilian coffee gelee, and cocoa leaves . Definitely unique but my least favorite. With cardamom, I was expecting a different presentation and outcome in taste.The cheeses by the way were amazing. There's a large cart full of cheeses. Went with the suggestion of the waiter and all were impressiveFor someone who prefers quality over quantity, overall  I did enjoy the desserts.

5.0,1/19/2018,"My boyfriend made a reservation here for a Monday night for my belated birthday dinner. The reservation time they gave us was at 5:30pm, and when we arrived, we were the first diners inside. The staff were exceptionally welcoming, and took care of us from the moment we set foot inside. We were brought copies of the drinks and wine menu first, and with some help from the sommelier, selected a bottle of white wine. He brought it out shortly after, and we also ordered our food items for the evening. We decided to go with the 4 course prix fixe menu. With that came some complimentary items, including bread and butter, an amuse bouche of beets and beet soup, and dessert wine. Our four course menu included one hot and cold appetizer, a main dish, and dessert. The appetizers included wasabi marinated hamachi, and grilled red snapper. Both were presented beautifully, but my favorite of the two was the hamachi. For the second round of appetizers, we had red leg partridge and quail pithiviers with foie gras and black truffle- this was one of the standout dishes of the night. My scallops were also very good though. For the main courses, we had wood fired duck and venison, both were excellent. Then, dessert came, and we were given some tiny pies, dessert wine (with top ups), madeleines, and an extra complimentary dessert with 'happy birthday' written on the plate. Of the desserts we had (mandarine, opera, and pomme), the pomme was my favorite, with perfect, flaky layers of pastry adorning sweet and soft apple pieces. After our meal, we were given canneles in a box, and taken back to the kitchen to meet the chef. All in all, an outstanding experience. Can't recommend enough for a big occasion dinner. The staff here also seemed genuinely kind in comparison to other upscale restaurants.

Every business encounters a problem, but it's how you deal with the problem that matters most. While waiting for our table we ordered cocktails, and the before they came we were brought to our table. There was a pretty long wait for our cocktails and it was not a great way to start a fancy meal. Our waiter Giovanni brought our drinks and was really upset they took so long.

If you're looking for an elegant restaurant, sensational food, and a kind staff, this is where you need to be. We chose several courses to dine on, and on top of that, there were several dishes that the chef chose for in between dishes. This included palate cleansers, decadent chocolates, etc. They even provide a special cushioned stool solely for your handbag! I'm sure most women in NYC would appreciate this.

I wish I could tell my 16-year old self that it was everything I'd dreamed it would be and more. My husband and I each ordered the 4-course vegetarian prix fixe, and we actually got to choose every one of our courses from a dazzling array of options. The flavors of everything that we had were exquisite, the ambiance (we were in the Lounge) was beyond lovely, but what was truly divine, that made the experience better than I could have hoped for? THE SERVICE. I had heard great things about the service, so I expected professionalism and attentiveness, but I was not prepared for how NICE and lovely the servers would be! Beyond the four courses that were the formal part of the menu, we were regaled with an array of delectable treats - amuse-bouches, breads, delicate sweets, all kinds of miniature (but rich!) delights, and all of the servers who attended to us were so warm, friendly, and devoted to making sure everything was perfect. When the head server asked if we'd enjoyed ourselves at the end of our meal, I gushed about how after years of anticipation, I was finally dining at Daniel with my husband for our 5th wedding anniversary, and then as we were finishing up they surprised us with an amazing anniversary gift!

4.0,12/23/2017,"It used to be THREE Star but in the last few years, Daniel became TWO Star in the Michelin Guide. It's one of the reasons why I was not in a rush to try this as I was waiting for it to be THREE again. This year though I decided to try it on my birthday.  Daniel is a classic starred Michelin restaurant with dress code. The full tables hardly reflect its fall from grace with Michelin inspectors. Even with two weeks lead time, the only table I could get was a 10:20 pm spot and between the reception and amuse bouche, the main fare from the season's tasting menu started coming in a little before 11 pm. Dinner was done at 1 pm. I asked for the Sky Box tour but since it was so late, I didn't get to see it. Sky Box is the part of the restaurant where one can see the chef and his staff at work from a special balcony table where price is double compared to the tables at the main dining room. My biggest disappointment that's why I am giving it four is a major no-no: We asked our beef to be cooked medium rare but it came out almost well done.

4.0,12/16/2017,"We struggled with the right number of stars to put on this restaurant because in some regards it is a five star. In other regards it was lacking. If we had known how expensive it would be by the end of the night we may or may not have done it. However looking back here is our honest analysis about it. First the restaurant is gorgeous beautiful Decour and it was gorgeous decorated for Christmas my went for our anniversary of our first date dinner. The main dining room is quiet and formal and that's where we sat. The wine selection was wonderful and our staff was attentive. However, you had many different staff members who waited on your table while you were there some of them were better than others. While they were all very professional and clearly knew what they were doing at least one of our waitstaff was not very fluent in English and made it a little bit difficult to understand exactly what we were eating with the complex dishesThat Daniel offered. We did the 47 course meal and also added the cheese course with the wine pairing.   Every dish had very small portions until you got further along but it didn't matter because the flavors were so delicious. They were unique and every little dot on the plate meant something to the pallet. The food was exquisitely paired. We really enjoyed the beef wagu as well as the escargot and seafood flight. We had the opportunity to meet the chef who signed the customized menu of the items that we had that night and really enjoyed a experience a fine dining that we can't get where we live and is unique to a big city like New York city. The big downside is that while the food was delicious and we will prepare we're prepared to pay a lot for our meal it was at least double what we expected making the meal over $1000 for two people. This has made us super critical of the restaurant and the food but the culinary delight in each dish cannot be underestimated. Go here if you have a mature pallet. Be prepared to spend time in the meal if you do the full seven course. Ours took approximately four hours for dinner.

It had chunks of goat cheese I believe in it which was interesting with the shrimp. The shrimps had tails on them, which is a little annoying but all in all a solid dish.All things considered this is an interesting place to come to, and for sure expensive so expect to pay top dollar, I give this place the nod, but i do think there is better out there for the price.",2,0,0,Michaela F.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",2,34,1

It's everything it's cracked up to be and worth every penny.  One of my fondest memories was when Chef Daniel himself, not only came to our table, but he insisted we tour the kitchen. For a foodie, this is such an incredible gesture a chef can show his guest. I had my 80 year old grandmother, who, she too, is a foodie and restaurant aficionado. When my grandmother, aunt and I were finished the tour that chef Daniel gave himself, he invited us to dine in the kitchen the next time we came. This is the ultimate act of gratitude a chef can offer to his guests. My family and I felt like royalty for that night. This was several years ago, and sadly I haven't made my way up to NYC since. However, every single holiday, my now, 85 year old grandmother displays Daniel's paper hand towels from the restroom, which she had to snag a few of for her bathroom. Imagine, these are now the ""good"" towels she puts out on holidays. The story gets shared every single year when a guest asks, ""What's Daniel?""

Maybe it's because I'm a native NY'er, maybe it's because I don't speak French even after 7 years of study. We showed up without a reservation the other evening, enjoyed cocktails at the bar, and mentioned that if a table became available in the ""dining room,"" we'd love to celebrate my ""birthday"" at Daniel. We were offered the lounge. I have dined at Daniel in the ""restaurant"" various times previously and was hesitant to sit in the lounge. We asked about the menu and I told the m'aitre de I would never sit ""upstairs"" for a price fixed  menu...the room is just too casual. He assured us that though it's the same menu, we could order ""a la carte."" We figured for a couple of courses with our drinks, why not. We were seated in the lounge and had the lovely experience of watching waiters  running around the table of 10 guests seated next to us. Not an intimate experience, not a relaxing experience, most certainly not for a Birthday.The a la carte menu is ridiculously priced. Though the The 7 course meal is $225 and the 4 course is $151, We were charged $82 not including tax or tip for that same ""2 inch"" piece of beef a la carte. Other than the $35 tiny portion of gnocchi, all the other items on the a la carte menu were priced over $60.  Yes, all these items are 2 ounces of food. The desserts are $24.Clearly because of the price points, the lounge is not for a la carte dining.Btw: out entrees were brought out while I was in the ladies room. That 2 inch $82 piece of beef was served cold. We spent over $400 and my husband was starving. Btw: the bread is GREAT!!! And the food is quite good (other than my dessert) BUT,How desperate is Daniel for diners that they'd push us to the lounge when I clearly stated I would not do a price fixe menu in the lounge because I don't consider the lounge a place for a fine dining experience!!!When I called the manager, his response to me, was that next time I should make a reservation.

It was like watching a  well choreographed dance with the wait staff . I had the four course meal , preceded with amuse-bouche and a canapé. Every dish was as outstanding  as the next . My waiter Javier was amazing as a special treat for this special occasion I was given a tour of the kitchen !!!

The dining room is something out of an Edith Wharton now novel. The wine selection is beautiful and the service is extravagant. The cheese selection is also a must. My only gripe - I left tipsy and bit hungry. There was a large party of 24 year old men eating next to us- obvious JR associates on an expense account. Personally I prefer the bar. It's warm, dark and just perfect for a discrete drink.",0,0,0,J F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,91,0

5.0,10/22/2017,"This is a review for private dining. 5 stars - 10 if I could!I hosted a dinner for 50 people in Daniel's private dining room on a Friday evening. Daniel private dining has my highest recommendation. I found the private events team outstanding (including Jenna Nocciolino and Rachel DeRose): incredibly responsive, calm and collected, while still being incredibly warm and personable. One of the planners was out for a week and I transitioned smoothly between people without ever having to start over or re-explain, which was one of the many signs they have a truly professional team. It goes (almost) without saying that the food was incredible. We did 4-courses, and everything arrived at the same time, beautifully plated, and exactly at the right temperature. Not an easy production for 50 people but they made it look flawless. Huge bonus points for accommodating several food allergies in the group (celiac, shellfish, pregnant guests) - they identified these people by their name cards so these guests did not have to worry/constantly ask. Bravo. When we did a tasting (just 2 people), they did just a beautiful job explaining each option, advising on how each might be different for a larger group, and recommending pairings (while essentially respecting our budget guidelines)We didn't do a ton of decor (as the space is already beautiful) but there were options to add specialized florals, microphones, etc as needed. We did basic florals with their existing team, and Daniel handled all the menu printing, name cards, table numbers etc once we sent over a seating list. One thing I liked about the private space is that it is on the same floor as the ground level, so older people in the party don't have to worry about navigating stairs in the main room. We ended up doing round tables evenly spaced, but they had other options too. For those of you who are picky: There is only one toilet near the private dining room (down about 6 stairs by the bar) - the rest are towards the back room down a full flight of stairs (may be hard for those of you in gowns/older guests/after a couple drinks - or maybe that's just me :) ). Also, the temperature in the room was slightly warm for our liking (but it was August after all). Bonus points for: A staff that is fully fluent in french (we had a bunch of international guests and this was very helpful); a totally worry-free experience; outstanding accommodation of allergies. PS - I hosted a smaller, simpler dinner in private dining at Jean Gorges that same week and it was a total let-down by comparison (messy billing, limited accommodation of fairly common allergies, slow service, unresponsive private events team who only would communicate by email with several days lag time). While I like Jean Gorges for 2-4 person meals, I HIGHLY recommend Daniel over Jean Gorges for private events.",0,1,0,Kels P.,"Manhattan, NY",10,54,5

5.0,10/10/2017,"Daniel is the first upscale restaurant I've tried in NYC. The service was great, waiter and waiter left you with enough privacy but also very responsive. Food was phenomenal. So many flavors combined harmoniously within one bite and it definitely lived up to my expectations. Within the prix fixe menu, I would suggest lobster salad as appetizer, veal as entree and panna cotta as dessert. They did offer seasonal refreshment to start with, it was like a ""beet trio"" which completely changed my view on beets.",1,0,0,Gong L.,"Manhattan, NY",68,7,17

5.0,10/5/2017,"(下記に日本語レビュー有り)Daniel is one of the best Michelin star restaurant in USA.Customer service 5 First, When the hostess confirmed my reservation by the phone, She asked me about my after dinner schedule including flight very politely. Actually I had an appointment at 8pm. I really appreciated for asking about my schedule! She has made a great first impression of Daniel.  Some of Michelin star restaurants make me feel little nerves. But Daniel's staffs made me very comfortable. Me and my friend kept laughing and talking a lot. We enjoyed very much!Food and drink 5(+more) Me and my friend ordered prefix4course meals.  Each dishes looked like formative arts! So Beautiful!  I felt elegant atmosphere of fall from  fastidious food ingredients and presentations. I surprised that They used ""Matsutake mushroom"" for the second dish. ( I was visiting from LA. But originally from Japan) ""Matsutake mushroom"" is a one of fall taste in Japan. It is a very rare mushroom...like a truffle or porcini.  Honestly When I was choosing a first dish to dessert dish from the menu, I didn't have knowledge about some of ingredients. My (funny) friend tried to check words with here iPhone(under the table). But don't worry about it ! Dining staffs have great knowledge about each ingredients! And they did good explanation of the menu for us. At the end of our dinner, they gave us a copy of our 4 course meals menu. It was a great gift for me. I have kept my happy memories in NYC by Daniel.Atmosphere 5Daniel was sophisticated restaurant. We had a wonderful night with Daniel's great staffs and amazing dishes!!Totals 5+++I really appreciated for Daniel's staffs.I'm looking forward to seeing you all soon.(Japanese review)ミシュラン2つ星(2017年現在)のレストランです。予約は必須ですが、とても丁寧に対応して頂けます。予約確認の電話を前日にスタッフの方から頂いた際にも、食事後の私達の予定や、予約した私の電話番号が西海岸の市外局番だからか、フライト予定の有無までも確認して頂けました。レストランに伺う前から接客の良さを感じることができ、より一層期待が膨らみました。他のミシュランレストランにも伺いましたが、良い意味でも悪い意味でも従業員の方々がプロフェッショナルに徹し過ぎ、少し緊張感の漂うお店もあったのですが...、ダニエルはプロフェッショナルなサービスの中にも、私や友人をリラックスさせてくれる雰囲気作りを取り入れ、本当に素晴らしい接客でした。例えば...、メニューに""sea urchin"" と書いてあり、私達が日本人だと知ると、担当のスタッフの方が、"" This is ウニ"" と、ニッコリ笑ってくれたり。お店では日本の食材も多く取り扱っているとのことで、ハマチ、シソ、ユズ...などの日本語も知っているそうです。今回、私達が訪れたのが9月(2017)でしたので、コースメニューは秋の食材となっており、お料理の盛り付けからも、まるで造形アートで表現したかのような秋を感じることができました。正直なところ、4コースのメニューに書かれている食材は知らないものも多く...、どれを選んで良いのか、かなり迷いましたが、聞くとスタッフの方が丁寧に丁寧に説明して下さいます。アメリカ人のお客様でも知らない食材は多々あるかと思います。なので、知らないことを聞くことは恥とかではなく、スタッフの方とのコミュニケーションの時間であって、それもレストランを楽しむ１つだと、私は思っています！そして、お料理の味は勿論ですが、量的にも充分満足出来るはずです。食事後、私と友人が選んだコースメニューをコピーして、小箱に入ったお菓子のお土産と一緒に手渡して下さる心遣いにも大変感動しました。(もしDanielを訪れる日本人の方々が、この場所を素晴らしいと思ったなら...、お会計が多少高額になったとしても、今後他の日本人が訪れることも考慮し、一般的マナーとして20%のチップは置いてあげて欲しいです。ガイドブックなどで15%くらいと書いているかもしれませんが、アメリカ人の認識では平均20%です。)料理、接客、会話、雰囲気、素晴らしいエンターテイメントのショーのようで、心もお腹も充分過ぎるほど満たされ、優雅で最高に楽しい時間を友人と過ごせたこと、ダニエルスタッフの方々に感謝しています。また、ダニエルのスタッフの方々とお会い出来ること楽しみにしています。",0,0,1,Akiko H.,"Tustin, CA",0,15,70

I chose to make the reservation to sit in the lounge area as the formal dining room only has the option of the tasting menu, and I wanted to be able to do a la carte from the menu. The space itself is beautiful, with lots of plush velvet and leather and a gorgeous bar when you walk in. The menu was varied in its offerings and everything we ordered was incredible in presentation and complexity of flavors. Be prepared to spend at least 2 hours on dinner as it is truly an experience. I would also say to make sure you make reservations well in advance of when you want to go, as they fill up very quickly. I would highly recommend if looking for a special occasion to celebrate.",0,0,0,Alexis S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",18,256,16
5.0,9/14/2017,"We went to Daniel to celebrate my wife's birthday and the experience definitely lived up to its reputation. We both opted for the vegetarian four-course prix fixe and ordered different dishes, so that we could try most of the vegetarian options, although the amount of complimentary tastings brought out made the experience feel longer. Our server had a very detailed knowledge of the menu and was able to direct us to appropriate options based on our palate. The flavors of each of the dish were interesting and thought-provoking with the presentation equally effective, forcing us to use all our senses to experience the uniqueness and intensity of the flavors. The dining experience, of course, was not to be outdone by the elegant ambience of the majestic dining room and probably what I felt to be the best service in New York City. The servers' meticulous attention to every detail was impressive, from holding the chair to folding linen napkins whenever leaving the table. The staff was always one step ahead and understood when we needed something before even requesting it. The highlight of our evening came towards the end of our dinner when we got the chance to meet and take a picture with Daniel Boulud, who was very gracious and welcoming. Mr. Boulud was inquisitive about the type of dishes we enjoy cooking and wanted our feedback on the meal, sign of a true chef!Daniel has undeniably been one of our most unique culinary experiences to date and is exemplary of fine dining at its best.",6,1,1,Prashant B.,"New York, NY",104,9,0
4.0,9/8/2017,"I visited Daniel's lounge section for a Michelin starred dinner with one of my best friends. Overall, I think I was the slightest bit disappointed, but I had an amazing experience and I wouldn't hesitate to visit again.The ambiance, the service, and the dining experience generally were superb and definitely worthy of the prestigious reputation. The food, while excellent, fell short in my opinion at times, which is why I'm leaving 4/5 stars.The dishes, in sequence:Rabbit saddle porchetta was the weakest dish of the evening. The dish was served cold, with rabbit, chorizo, and some other components wrapped in a rather slimy, fatty skin. I found myself pretty unhappy with this dish and I forced myself to eat it, but I would absolutely never order it again.Gnocchi with mushrooms was great even though I am not a mushroom lover. The gnocchi were perfectly cooked, seasoned, and served in a divine sauce. Guinea hen was a mixed success. The breast itself was perfectly cooked, albeit topped with a rather unpleasantly rubbery - but tasty - skin. It was served with a strange egg and meat concoction which was unadvertised and completely unwelcome. Kiwi dessert was another mixed success, with delectable and crispy kiwi-flavored cookie petals surrounding a tasty kiwi and arugula sorbet, which in turn encapsulated a dollop of avocado. No, that's not a typo. I thought it was a little weird as well, and the richness of the avocado, which I think was intended to provide a sharp contrast between the icy freshness of the sorbet, just ended up giving my mouth a sort of slick, mucous coating. Between everything we were served a number of incredible breads, outstanding amuse bouches (including a goat cheese mousse cracker and trio of beet preparations), out of this world madeleines, and fine hand-made chocolates. At the end of the meal, we were seen off with an incomparable house-made canele which was individually wrapped and boxed: very charming and memorable!The overarching highlight of the night was the perfect attentive service we received which at no time felt excessive or inadequate. I felt like all of my questions were welcome, answered expertly, and never felt like I was anywhere but at a friend's home. Some fine dining establishments can produce an air of elitism, and while the staff at Daniel could easily have done so, I never once was even remotely uncomfortable. A huge kudos and thanks to all of the staff at Daniel, particularly the front of house. You guys do an excellent job and killed it, in my book. I look forward to returning and am hopeful that next time my meal will be more consistent overall.",2,0,1,Robert D.,"Lafayette Hill, PA",85,55,140

This place is definitely somewhere you want to come for a special occasion, an expensive date night, or if you just want to be fancy.

They fill you up with other amazing goodies throughout your meal, which was an excellent surprise. My favorite dishes were the rabbit, the wagyu and the bolivie dessert.

I wish I could have enjoyed the whole tasting menu. The servers will very knowledgable and right on the spot the whole night. Elvir, the Maître D' Hôtel, went well beyond what he needed too.

We were there for my birthday with a party of 12 (largest they allow outside of private dining) and even despite the massive number of guests the service was impeccable. The customized tasting menu we had was over the top delicious, and perfectly paired wines didn't hurt either! It's hard to put a label of favorite on just one of the dishes, for the meal flowed so perfectly from one course to the next it's as if it were one long course. It was beautiful and the atmosphere was lovely for a small get together!

5.0,6/4/2017,"First of all this restaurant is a must if you're looking for a professional, delicious, and special experience.  The tasting menu is amazing and the timing that they take with the spread of each plate is out of this world.  The clashes in taste on your palate is great and nothing can beat the chocolate they give you at the end of your meal.The only tip I have is to make sure to decide the 7 or 14 course tasting menu carefully as the 14 course may be a-lot even for the hungriest of people and may not be worth the price difference.Note:  I came here in January and am just getting to writing this review now.",2,1,1,Justin L.,"Los Angeles, CA",334,16,0

I would give the food 4 stars, including the dessert (which kind of surprised me to be honest).  You have the option of choosing a 4 course tasting menu or 7 course, so we got 7 course to try more stuff.

The only human experience I can imagine is that people like the robot server type situation. It's good ""boring"" service. Food presentation is good.But the actual food... I spent over $600 and it was unique but not tasty.I have been to restaurants where i can't stop eating the foie  gras and Daniel served a unique experience where it is cooked in front of you, but it had a very pungent taste almost like it was past it's sell by date. It is similar to how you know you have good fish vs bad fish.The steak was ok, why get steak here for so much money when you can go to a steak house and actually enjoy it.Even to celebrate an event seems like a waste of time.

4.0,4/29/2017,"I've been meaning to check Daniel off my Michelin wish list for years now.  I was thrilled to find out that fellow Yelper Sari A. felt the same way, so we immediately booked a table and trekked it out to NYC only a few weeks later.Service is a solid five stars.  They know how to make you feel special and want to help you have the best experience possible.  We all opted for the four course menu which was more than generous in terms of the food you get.  Sari wanted cocktails and was asking for recommendations, and the server offered her a cocktail pairing with her courses instead of wine which was really cool.  They charged her the same as the wine pairing too which wasn't a bad deal at less than $100.  I  got the basic wine pairing.  They have a fancier one for around $50 more.  I was afraid I would be bored with the regular one, but I was not in the slightest.  They gave me some very interesting wines that I hadn't tried before from France, Italy and even Hungary!Bread was readily available as the bread tray came round with about six to eight varieties of bread in between every course.  The flakey, buttery croissant like brioche was my favorite.  I had to hold back from not trying too many or otherwise I wouldn't have been able to finish my meal.I would only give three stars to the savory courses.  They were a let down compared to other Michelin establishments I've visited.  The warm seafood salad was just okay and also had some grit in it from the shellfish.  This is unacceptable at this level.  The sturgeon with caviar from the snake river was my best savory dish as I liked the depth the greens gave the sauce and the texture from the caviar.  The truffled sole was really bland for something with truffles.  The veggies that were the garnish around the sides of the plate had way more flavor than the rest of the dish. All the dishes were beautifully plated, but flavor-wise, these courses were not memorable.Dessert is where Daniel shines.  I would go back for the dessert courses alone.  Their pastry chef is a genius!  I had an artichoke made out of meringue filled with a kiwi sorbet.  It was so beautiful to look at.  Truly a piece of art.  It was so flavorful and had a wonderful variety of textures from the crispy meringue to smooth sorbet.  The level of sweetness was only slight and perfect for me.  Going back to the excellent service, Sari and I couldn't decide if we wanted the Baba Al Rhum cake or another dessert.  The Baba had such a long paragraph about it, we thought it must be good.  Our server told us they pick a class dessert to recreate each season and that's why the paragraph was long.  We both decided on other desserts though still curious about that dessert.  Our server brought our desserts out plus the Rhum cake to try!  It was the least sweet rum cake I've ever tried and I loved the incorporation of tropical fruits such as coconut and papaya.  So boozy and delicious!  As with any Michelin restaurant, the dessert course keeps going.  We also were given some small varied sweets, chocolates, and the best was last --piping hot fresh madeleines out of the oven.  I was stuffed by then and could barely move, but that didn't stop me from enjoying that buttery goodness!  We asked if we could take the Daniel pens as a souvenir.  The server offered us more and also offered us some Daniel matches.  The service was on point all night and so friendly and not stuffy. That along with the desserts is what will have me coming back. The space is really beautiful and classy.  I wish they'd add some background music though because when you're in the first seating, the first hour is really quiet and you feel like the universe can hear your conversation even if you're speaking softly.  That problem went away though after the dining room was full. I'm willing to give the savory courses another go since the service, wine, and savory courses hit it out of the park.",3,0,1,Courtney J.,"Philadelphia, PA",271,484,2175

4.0,4/22/2017,"This review deserves 4.5 stars, but yelp doesn't allow this feature. Let me start off by saying the service was exceptional and the staff seemed very genuine in their eagerness to serve. I will say it was often difficult to understand them due to their volume or thick accents but they were more than happy to repeat themselves without any hint of annoyance or frustration. As far as uniqueness, I'd rate them 8.5/10. The individual components were not jaw-dropping but I found some of the mixing and pairing to be particularly interesting. The flavor of the food was more 7/10. When spending $905 for a dinner for 2, I expect every bite to be exceptional and life altering, which it was not. However, each bite was good and every plate was cleaned. Also, my partner and I drink a lot of tea and found it to be the best camomile and mint tea we have had quite possibly ever. The liquor drinks were a bit over-priced but the nuances and fine details of the food and service are what separate Daniel apart from the pack.",0,0,0,Ryan M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",12,98,22

I wish I remembered what I had but we had worked earlier that day and just landed in NY that night... I was pooped. I just wanted to show up in leggings and a sweater... but I didn't. ;) Oh, and it was probably my fault that I had difficulty understanding the oh so French accents. Sorry. I really tired. I did.

Normally the legendary chef at this caliber may not have to work on Monday night or any nights at all. Not chef Daniel. It is quite a contrast in services and meal quality between Gramercy Tavern and Daniel. The service at Gramercy Tavern reminded me of a German military school is very aloft and impersonal.

4.0,4/10/2017,"My dining experience at Daniel is phenomenal. Amazing food and the service is near perfection.The only reason for a four stars is because I've been to this place twice (almost half a year apart) and nothing on the menu has changed. For a restaurant who holds 2 Michelin stars, I expect more frequent innovation of new dishes.With that said, every dishes they have are well executed and timeless. I recommend trying this place if you want to experience the real classic French cuisine. To my understanding, sauces are the hardest thing to perfect in French cuisine. Their proteins and vegetables are all well done and their sauce marriage all the ingredients together beautifully.Daniel is a very romantic restaurant for dates and I will definitely come back to try some new dishes from Daniel.

5.0,4/9/2017,"SIMPLY ... JUST ... AMAZING!My girlfriend and I came here for our anniversary and it was such an incredibly awesome experience dining at one of the most outstanding culinary institutions in NYC. First of all, I made reservations 1.5 months in advance and it was pretty much packed for the evening we went, except for a 5:30pm slot, so I jumped at it! Once we arrived, we were immediately escorted into the spacious and elegant dining room by a host. The seating inside was very interesting as there were tables overlooking the sunken dining floor. Everyone was located in 1 main dining room, but there were 2 levels of tables within. We loved the spaciousness between tables as there was plenty of walking space throughout the restaurant as well.We both didn't order any alcohol so we went straight to the food menu. We were presented 2 options, a seven-course tasting menu and four-course prix-fix. The seven-course menu was about $90 more than the prix-fix menu. We ended up going with the four-course menu because we felt it was definitely going to be enough food, plus the fact that the seven-course menu was probably going to be an all-night affair lasting up to 5+ hours, which based on our four-course evening was just about right. Just an observation -- based on what we saw other tables order, we felt a good number of tables around us also went with the four-course menu.Our meal started with some off-menu items that every one received. As for what we ordered, here goes:APPETIZERSHOMARD - Maine Lobster SaladST JACQUES - Slow Poached Maine Sea ScallopsFIRST COURSESESTURGEON - Salt Baked Snake River SturgeonLANGOUSTINE - Slow Baked Scottish LangoustineSECOND COURSESAGNEAU - Colorado Lamb ChopWAGYU - Imperial Wagyu Beef TenderloinDESSERTSKIWI - Matcha Tea, Nigelle Seeds Meringue, Finger Lime, Tarragon Coulis, Kiwi and Arugula SorbetTARTE CITRON MERINGUÉE - Mexican Vanilla Sablé, Light Basil Lemon Cream, Passion Berry MeringueI won't go into details into everything we ordered, but it was all amazingly delicious! We had absolutely NO COMPLAINTS about any of the items here. In fact, they all had certain qualities about them that had our minds thinking. We savored each and every bite and wish we had more of it!I will say that the appetizers were so incredibly fresh! The meats for the first and second-courses were perfectly cooked and lamb chop & wagyu were ridiculously tender! The desserts were unbelievably refreshing! Everything about our experience here was PERFECT. The decor was simple, yet elegant. The ambiance was perfectly romantic.The service was outstanding and the waiters/waitresses were so attentive. The food was incredibly delicious and mind-blowingly thought-provoking. The restaurant provided us with a surprise anniversary dessert, which topped off our evening the best way possible! Throughout the evening, the restaurant treated us like a king and queen and we felt like it was a very exclusive experience, despite the fact that the restaurant was at capacity that evening. We truly felt like we were the only ones dining there that evening with the superb service. To be honest, I'm not sure how Pete Wells downgraded Daniel to 3 stars from 4 stars, but I will say that he absolutely needs to revisit this incredible institution once more because it was one for the books!",6,0,0,Chris E.,"Brooklyn, NY",530,1118,9624

4.0,3/25/2017,"4.5 stars. Very tempted to drop the 5-star rating here, but service was erratic at points, and for a three Michelin star restaurant, I was expecting them to come back more often to take drink orders. I have to say this though - the servers, waiters, and other waitstaff will make you feel like a special person. They'll make conversation, continually offer you delicious Parmesan garlic or flaky brioche buns with butter and two kinds of rock salt, and you'll never be lacking in amuse bouches and free dishes. I mean, we probably got four free amuse bouches, ranging from beer tastings to chocolate samples. Amazing stuff.But, if you want to know where the real money is at, aside from Grand Cru wine, you're going to look for some amazing entrees. The escargot and accompanying puff pastry are amazing. The portions are large, and the escargot is cooked to tender perfection. What else? Fatty wagyu and the cochon. Oh lord, the cochon will make you cry. Suckling pig is already good enough as it is, but add some chicarrones and garnishes, and you have enough to make you swoon. After that, get yourself some of their drop coffee and apple dessert four ways. You'll thank me later.Two last notes - jackets required for gentlemen l, and they give you free caneles to go when you leave.

The chairs, table positioning and lighting was just a tad better. Also, I found Daniel to be somewhat loud and ""busy"". Service was solid and insightful. The sommelier had good knowledge with an obvious bent towards French wines. They do have some modestly price wines, but you need to have the knowledge to find those hidden gems. It is also important to note they have great after dinner drink list. I highly recommend their aged rum options. One last comment....they should upgrade their washrooms. They were aged and lacked modern amenities. For a first class restaurant they really should have first class restrooms. Enjoy NYC!!",4,1,0,John I.,"Toronto, Canada",10,576,2

I might be a little too fascinated by fire. The dish also tasted so good. I tried the suckling pig as my entree and that was exquisite. My Grandmother's and Sister's dishes also looked very good. Dessert blew me away. Not only did we get our dessert plate that was part of the 4-course prixe fix menu, but we got some fresh baked madeleines (AMAZING)and a nice little to-go treat box.

5.0,3/13/2017,"AMAZING. Literally THE BEST dining experience I've ever had. I can't give enough stars!!Cliff notes: make reservations, do the wine pairings and order the waygu filet. Yes, it's expensive and a splurge, but absolutely worth it. Enjoy the experience and put your phone away. Details:To start, reservations open 30 days in advance on OpenTable. Be sure to note any special occasions and set a reminder to make your reservations once the clock strikes midnight 30 days before the you wish to go...and then the wait. Lol. Also, the restaurant is formal attire, jackets required for gentlemen and ladies, get dolled up!From the moment we walked in, I knew it was going to be amazing. First you check in with the hostess and then you can order a drink while you wait for your table to be set (10 mins max). Once you get to your table, your server brings you the menu and will explain anything and everything to you and make any recommendations. There are 2 ways you can order, chef's tasting menu which is 7 tasting course (approx $240) or a 4 course and you select each of your 4 courses (3 savory and 1 dessert- approx $145).  You can also do wine pairings to go with your meal, which I highly recommend because each wine is specifically chosen for each course and that way you don't have to think about what to order. We went with the 4 course meal and wine pairings. I had the lobster salad, escargot, waygu filet, and poached pear for dessert. Each course is prepared to perfection and each ingredient is carefully crafted and serves a purpose to bring the dish together. While every course was absolutely delicious, the waygu filet course was my absolute favorite! The filet had a truffle crust and served with celery root 3 ways. I had a bite of my boyfriend's foie gras course and that was spectacular. It's served and flambéed table side. When it came to the dessert course, we had an extra surprise. They wrote ""happy birthday"" on an extra dish of dessert, so we needed up with 3 dishes! There are also a few extras in between in the courses like the amuse-bouche, bread service, and petite madeleines at the end. If you're lucky like we were, you'll also get the meet the Chef himself (yes, Daniel Boulud!!) and have him sign a menu for you as a keepsake!",11,1,5,Lynn C.,"Jacksonville, FL",189,234,1597
4.0,3/12/2017,"I'll help out @Namir S., who said ""4.5 but can't bring myself to give it a 4"" on 3/6/2017. I'll give 4 stars and between us we give two 4.5s.The dinner was excellent, and the service, ambiance, etc. Later that weekend we dined at Jean Georges, which earned the full 5 stars. I'll describe the differences below, but first I'll mention that I probably came at this with different expectations from yourself, so don't let my experience interfere with your enjoyment. 1) I have long, long been a fan of the old fine dining described in books and recipes of the Escoffier scene around 1900, and Oscar of the Ritz. You don't find that anymore, but this was my best chance. 2) We live by the sea and, as my wife eats no meat, we get fresh fish from an excellent fish market most every night, and on weekends we get the freshest fish and shellfish along the New England coast, so we kind of fanatic about it.Here are my thoughts on Daniel: Ambiance: Very nice without being stuffy, comfortable except my bench seat was low for the table (too low for my wife, so we switched). Service: Very attentive, maybe to much so - my wife was escorted all the way to the ladies room, where the door was held for her. She thought that was a bit more than she needed. More important for me: despite having read the menu thoroughly, the servers all spoke with such accents that it was very hard to catch all the delicious details of what to expect with each course. This happened with several servers. I work in Hi-Tech with about 50% of my office from far-off lands and I understand them just fine. The trick here was the lack of context - for example, the dessert included whipped cream scented with pine needles. After tasting it I recognized it, but until that moment I had no idea what the server had said. It was not a single server, either; probably three different servers brought us dishes and I had a hard time with each of them.Food: Everything was creative, even to a fault. My wife was somewhat nonplussed by some of the dishes. It seemed somewhat self-consciously ""Gee-whiz!"" Two days later at Jean Georges we had brilliant creativity, but it was firmly within the lexicon of human food.  Presentation was uniformly brilliant. Quality of the seafood was disappointing, but remember our preconceptions listed above: the lobster in the Homard appetizer lacked the sparkle that comes from lobster cooked and served direct from seawater, and the Dover sole was flat (no pun intended) compared to other that we had had. The black truffle was past peak freshness, and I was disappointed in the Sauce Perigueux (also has truffle). In January I had agonized over making a Sauce Perigueux from the Escoffier book, and I had put a lot of money and effort into it - but it came out fabulous. Better than the one at Daniel, which I had the feeling had taken a few shortcuts with the underlying Sauce Madere that should be perfectly understandable in a modern kitchen, but that nonetheless left me feeling like a chump for all the effort I had put into my own.In the end we had the feeling that Daniel has made its splash (#1 in NYC on TripAdvisor) and now it can cut a few corners. Obviously the huge majority of people are happy with it. For me it was kind of like finally getting World Series tickets, and the seat is uncomfortable - in the Big Picture, it's still the freakin' World Series, and I shouldn't expect perfection on this green Earth.",2,1,0,John S.,"Plymouth, MA",17,68,104

My favorite dish was the escargots. Have always been an escargots fan, I really enjoyed how they made the snails with creamy spinach and rye berries. Rich and delicious.What amazed me most was that when I asked if they have Soufflé for dessert (omg I have been craving for it for months!), the chef made a chocolate soufflé specially for us! It was very fluffy and airy and totally won my heart at first bite - what could possibly be the reason that they keep it off their tasting menu?? After we finished the tasting menu, we were served with a birthday special dessert, fresh baked madeleines and some handmade chocolates. Full and happy at the end of the night.

5.0,2/22/2017,"I'd first like to say that I did not deserve the fanciness of this restaurant. It's more than just fine dining, it's a full blown experience and wow, I will not forget it!!First off, the server and supporting staff were all absolutely wonderful - so polite, professional, and explained everything beautifully. I unfortunately don't remember our server's name, but his winning moment was when we bashfully told him at 7:20 that we were trying to make it to a 8pm show, and he went into overdrive - he brought all the desserts & check pretty much immediately and it was so amazing of him. We could not believe that we made it to the show with time to spare. He felt badly even though we should have told him when we got there at 5!The food was incredible. The complex flavors of everything blew us away. I won't go into detail about each dish because I think I blacked out from how good everything was, but it was all great - I ordered the lobster salad, daurade (very smoky but still good), wagyu (this was AMAZING. best cut of meat I've ever had), and the fleur de cao for dessert, along with a special birthday dessert! My boyfriend ordered the seriole, escargot, sole, and the ""mille-feuille."" He loved everything. I wish I could try everything on the menu!Just an FYI - dinner takes awhile, because of all the courses, including the amuse-bouche, bread, petit fours, etc. (but not because of too much waiting!). It should, though, because it's an experience and should be thoroughly enjoyed. But as a party of 2, we were there for close to 3 hours.I would love to come back if my wallet allows for it!

I sent mine back on the promise I would get something better that somehow never materialized.  Clearly I'm still annoyed about it.Here's why: the rest of the meal was quite good. The Maitaké ""a la plancha"" was fabulously campy. Basically it's artsy mushrooms grilled on a stone and then served with a mushroom broth.  My Black Truffle Crusted Dover Sole was perfect in both flavor and texture.  My only complaint (at that moment) was that there was not enough.But then came their interpretation of the Mille-Feuille - and my enjoyment came to a deconstructed halt.

5.0,2/19/2017,"We recently celebrated my husband's birthday here. They gave us the best table in the house, I felt like the bride & groom in the main dining hall. We were first served with complimentary tasting dishes. Then, we each had the 4 course meal. I had the POULARDE foie gras, LOUP DE MER sea bass, SOLE with black truffles. MY Husband had the HOMARD lobster salad, ESCARGOT & WAGYU beef. Everything was excellent, fresh & delicious! SUPERB!!! French cuisine at its best. For dessert we had the ILLANKA dark chocolate with blackberry orange sorbet & BEN TRE soft fondant cake with coconut butter ice cream. Both fantastic! They also gave us a complimentary CANNEBERGE cranberry sorbet with fresh meringue with a ""happy birthday"" message -DELISH! My favorite out of the 3 desserts.Just in case, we were not full enough. They served us complimentary fresh baked bread throughout dinner. In case, we didn't have enough desserts, they also served us complimentary chocolates & fresh baked Madeleines which was heavenly! They also gave us complimentary box of traditional Cannele dessert each as a parting gift. I ate this 2 days later & it was amazing!The service is nothing but SUPERB! The wait staff were all very friendly, kind and very knowledgable. They went out of their way to make my husband's birthday extra special. The entire experience was 3 hours.

I book the restaurant a month in advance because it's also around Valentine's day, an obviously popular date weekend. The date rolls around and I get the suit out of the closet and surprisingly it still fits me. It feels strange on my shoulders because I usually wear a hoodie and jeans.We take a cab to the restaurant and walk into the restaurant. The atmosphere is relatively quiet because we are one of the first ones there and feel obligated to whisper. They don't play music and can hear each other talk. We opted for the 7 course tasting menu and it featured dishes that were all rich and full. The presentation was fantastic as well.I sipped on a Burgundy red wine but the table-side cocktails looked interesting and I might go that direction next time.

5.0,12/31/2016,"Started off with champagne.   Wasn't seated like mg enough in the waiting area so they brought it to the table. The dinner started with an amouse bouche of sweet potato and shrimp. It was good. Then had scallops, fluke and hamachi. Scallops with seaweed. tasted like sushi. Hamachi was a bit tart. Fluke was good. The next course was frog legs with mushrooms soup with bits of boned frog legs wrapped in bacon. Lobster with butternut squash puree. Nice table side service of removing the lobster from shell. The next course was venison medium rare, American wagyu beef and rabbit with rabbit stew. The venison was cooked perfectly snd not gamey tasting. The beef came from Nebraska and had good marbling and plenty of juice. The rabbit stew was better than the rabbit pieces. Rabbit needs to be braised for the best flavor. The last course was the cheese plate, mont blanc chestnut cream made to look like Mt Blanc, milk chocolate mousse with grapefruit sorbetMake good choices protect your carnal treasure. You get to pick the cheeses from their selection of soft and hard cheeses. Most were from the US. It came with fruit crackers and grapes. The Mt blanc was good. The chocolate mousse was good. The grapefruit sorbet was refreshing. Had Sweet french wine that tasted like port and espresso. The server brought out more gifts from the chef. It was fresh madelines, mini chocolates, petite fours and more mini chocolates lime, chili flavored . The final chefs gift was a rum cake in a little box. The service was fantastic.

4.0,12/31/2016,"4.5 star food, 3.5 star value. Went here for anniversary/night of engagement. Would say this is worth the experience once, not sure I would go back again. We had two servers, the first one was older and snootier, almost like one of those stereotypical rich people's butler you see on tv, technically good manner with thinly veiled arrogance, you can clearly tell he's thinking ""those pleb kids, back in my days (yadayadayada) *shake his head in his head* "". Didn't bother me because it was so expected, it was borderline funny how stereotypical he was. Half way through our meal, it looked like his shift ended and a younger guy took over. And that was the sweetest server I've ever had. The service just went from 2/5 to like, 6/5 :P Drinks: the white cosmo was delicious. Sparkling water will cost you something like 20$ - somewhat expected for a place like this, but you kinda wish they'd list it on the menu. Had the four course meal. The foie gras pate salad was... interesting (not bad, but nothing to rave about). The lobster was good. I liked the lobster bisque foam a lot. But it was like, expectedly-good, nothing ""wow""ing. Wagyu tenderloin was again, expectedly delicious  (but so is a piece of wagyu from Mitsuwa market with nothing more than salt&pepper seared on a pan). The lobster and wagyu are hard to beat, but not significantly better than any other properly prepared lobster/wagyu. I have had some (albeit rare) local fine dining that had delivered something just as good for a third of the price. So I guess that took the wow factor away for me - in terms of the food/taste at least. The presentation was like none that I've ever experienced before. Not sure we are the biggest fans though, of watching waiters coming out with a dozen utensils on a rolly cart, gingerly peel a radish baked in what looked like a pastry crust, and proceed to throw away what looked liked like a perfectly delicious crust and hand us the radish. (I found the bells and whistles bit over the top, my fiance on the other hand, had much stronger, sadder feelings about that crust. It had plebs like us flipping shit in our head.) What really impressed me from Daniel was the dessert. I am an avid baker, and rarely find myself genuinely impressed at restaurant desserts. I would like a lot of them, but rarely do I think ""wow I couldn't have made this"". Daniel's desserts were eye-openers. Their chocolate pastry cream was stunningly good, as was their meringue cake. Also got bunch of freebie chocolates and take-home canele. We sat in the main dining room, but had a sneak peak of the lounge on our way out. Seating looked too close together for our liking, but the decor wasn't bad. I debated between lounge and main room before making my reservation, because the a la carte option in the lounge was always enticing. But having been in the main room and looked at the lounge, if we do come back again I think I would opt for the main dining room again. It just won't be the same experience in the lounge.",1,1,1,Cheryl D.,"Berkeley, CA",29,75,1

Hosts and servers were gracious, but I was, literally, the only guy there without a jacket, so I didn't feel totally comfortable at first.The food was some of the best I've ever tasted, served beautifully, totally lived up to the billing and then some. I'm sure the vegetarian menu doesn't typically get a lot of attention, but whoa. We did the 4 course thing and ordered differently so we could share, and I could list them, but honestly you're not going to go wrong anywhere. The beet amuse trio was basically heaven. Even the breads (and butter and salt) - incredible. One dish, the Fenouil, didn't totally stack up with the others, but is still better than 99% of anything you're going to get anywhere. Desserts especially stood out, even though we were too full to finish. And they brought out a birthday cake with my name on it!So why no 5 star review? We're not regulars... but we felt like it. Filling up a half glass of sparkling water with still after just a few minutes? And just plain getting an order wrong for one of the courses? I know it happens, and I'm super low maintenance, but here? The wait between courses was much longer for us than for others, and the servers started disappearing about half way through. I had heard/read about the double standard thing, thought it might be overblown, but unfortunately it is a thing.

We dressed up, and good thing because most guests had as well -- it's only fitting for such a beautiful restaurant! They had a few menu options, and we opted for the 4 course meal. Our server was very patient and walked us through the menu; he also was very kind. I was worried a place like this would be very uptight, and fortunately that was not the case at all! Each of the dishes were rather small for the price, but we agreed it allowed us to experience the combination of ingredients, how their flavours complemented, and were in awe of the presentation. I believe my main was wagyu beef, and my SO's was rabbit -- both were perfectly cooked, as with the other courses.

2.0,11/14/2016,"I wanted to love Daniel. We came to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary and traveled and planned our entire New York trip around coming to dinner here. We booked a lovely hotel that was within walking distance and eagerly waited for our evening. We made a reservation well in advance and our table was supposed to be at 8:15. We arrived and waited for 30 minutes before being seated. We were ushered to our table and given our menus. At that point, I generally love to discuss with the servers what they recommend as I have in all my travels found that they give the best recommendations. Our server was brusque/rushed and seemed completely uninterested in providing any guidance. I specifically asked this is our first time is there anything you think we should try or what do you recommend how to experience  - how ridiculous that I did not look at the yelp reviews right beforehand. I had read them when we selected the restaurant and wish that I had refreshed my memory. I just assumed that our server would be a guide. I wish we got the 4 course and got to try the foie gras and the truffle special. It certainly sounds like it would have been more than enough food. Instead he nonchalantly shrugged we could try the 7 course and wine pairing. Unfortunately, the signature foie gras was not one of the offerings. The seven courses ended up being way too much food for us. However, even worse was that we felt very isolated. In between course 3 and 4 it literally was a dead zone of 40 minutes and no one came by to even offer bread. We had to flag a server down. I am not sure why we had such a different experience. It did seem that other tables were being greeted much more warmly and with much more attention. Maybe when you get the seven course tasting you just go to some other zone? It ended up being way too much food over too long a period, very extended with awkward breaks.  For $1100 I expected more and although several of the dishes were excellent and very tasty I must say that the service was a big miss and definitely impacted our experience in a negative way. There was one dish that I did not care for at all (Pig trotters) and although I could not find my server I was able to flag someone else down and they were kind enough to get it taken care of for me and substituted it with something else. For our 10 year anniversary we dined at Guy Savoy in Paris and had a completely different experience in terms of flawless food and service and atmosphere. I only wish that I could have said the same for our evening at Daniel. C'est lavie.",2,1,0,S K.,"Bryn Mawr, PA",0,9,0
5.0,11/11/2016,"This was by far the best restaurant experience. The food and service were superior. We sat in the more casual lunge area which was perfect. We had the four course menu. It was nice to be able to make my selections. You get an amuse bouche and a starter. Then on to the four courses. I started with the hamachi and caviar which was very good. Next onto the foie grais which had a table side preparation. It too had a lot of flavor. The wine that was paired with this was my favorite. Next up was the duo of rabbit. And then let's finish with a fig dessert. Lets don't forget that you get a small tasting of some dessert, Madeleine's and a dessert gift to go. Lots of food, great wine and very good service. Everything was top notch. They were appreciative and displayed it. They got us a cab at the corner as well.

2.0,11/10/2016,"Finally returned to Daniel after a decently long absence. My fiancee and I had a really late reservation (same day, though) and were seated immediately after arriving ~5 minutes before. We were greeted by a very friendly maitre d' who brought us to our table (a booth in the back) and we were poured water and a wine list to peruse.[Food]:We both opted for the four-course menu, which in my opinion is TOTALLY more than enough food, plus I like the ability to choose. Our courses: 1) The first amuse bouche were brought out - the chef did the signature trio, this time with parsnip, which I didn't think was very good. Melon was better last time. Shrimp was gamey.2) First course: I had the Hamachi and my fiancee had the Fluke. Both were excellent, there was an ample amount of caviar, and the fish was extremely fresh and tender. Mine had a nice citrusy kick to it and was served with beautiful tomato coulis.3) Second course: per my recommendation we both ordered the foie gras, which is one of the most amazing dishes I've ever had in my life. Just as good as I remembered it - absolutely absoltuely recommend4) Third course: My fiancee had the duo of rabbit and I had the deer. The deer was served with black mission figs and sumac, and I thought it was good but nothing exceptional. I wish I had the wagyu. The duo of rabbit was WONDERFUL - the braised-rabbit stuffed endive was decadent and rich, BUT the presentation was awful! Looked like a used medieval chamber pot LOL.5) Dessert: I had the Vietnamese chocolate and my fiancee had the same chocolate dish I had last time - fine, but forgettable. They brought out a complimentary dessert for our anniversary that looked awful and tasted worse (it was their current ""historic"" dish or whatever) but a nice gesture nonetheless.Total bill was roughly $415 before tip - included two glasses of wine for each of us and espresso.[Service]:This is the main reason I'm updating my review, besides giving an update on some dishes. The service was inexcusably bad for the most part. During our meal: 1) We were sat at the slum table. Now, it was a late reservation, but it was cramped against the wall. I was also not a fan of sitting next to my fiancee while we ate like we were on a bus.2) A server spilled a glass of water and didn't acknowledge it at all - no apologies, nothing, just laid down a napkin.3) The timing of the dishes was awful. There was some overlap and some long lags between dishes. 4) A server poured a glass of wine incorrectly - he poured a taste, label down, for my fiancee before showing him the bottle. 5) After our first glass of wine, we sat with them empty until WE FLAGGED DOWN A SERVER for the wine list again.6) At the desserts, one waiter said something along the lines of ""as if everything weren't enough, here is more"" which got a little chuckle, and then another waiter came out and said the exact same thing as if it were scripted. Probably was. WEIRD.Now, I'm not crazy - if I were writing a review for Chili's I would never complain about any of these things, but at one of the best restaurants in the city, for a meal that costs more than some people make in a week, for an anniversary, I would expect far better.TL;DR: Yes, the food is pretty good, and if I could only eat one thing for the rest of my life it would be the foie gras, but Daniel - you need to tighten your staff. Especially with Michelin NYC coming out in a week I could expect your A-game. I would not be shocked or disappointed to see it downgraded to 1 star.",14,10,3,Hannah M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1025,331,1186

We were greated immediately and had a couple of champagnes before dinner and were seated at a nice table over looking the dining room. The restaurant is elegant with out being pretensious. We ordered the 4 course Prix fix menu and it was more then enough food. There were also least 4 to 6 staff members per table.

That being said I went to Daniel because I expected them to pull out all of the stops given the loss of their third star. I know thats a touch on the grim side. The cost/value of Daniel just isn't there, especially in New York City. I don't want to represent myself as a purveyor of fine dining, I am certainly not, but I have been to Eleven Madison and the contrast is stark. The things that left me disappointed were as follows:- I saw two flies while I was there. One landed on me. - My neighbor's dish had plastic in it. - There was a good amount of wait time before the meal started and in between dishes. - My wife had the vegetarian tasting menu. One of her dishes was the same sides recycled from one of my fish courses. It was amazing, but I had already given her a taste of it. I would expect that each of the dishes be unique. - One of the most visually pleasing dishes was the Foie Gras, waiters flambed it at table side, and customers faces lit up while eating it. Unfortunately this was only available on the Prix fixed menu and not on the tasting menu. My feeling is that something so grand should really go the other way. I should not leave a tasting menu of this caliber with food envy.- My water sat mostly empty for quite some time. I know how pretentious this sounds, but for this level of restaurant I would expect greater attention to detail. Look, I know this criticism is a bit obsessive compulsive, but I honestly expect it from this level of dining. I don't make a lot of money, and had to work extra shifts to be able to afford it.

We were precisely an hour early to our reservation but the staff did not blink nor shun us away until our reservation time; they sat us immediately.

Just the little things about this restaurant make it pristine.  Finished plates never remained on our table for more than 1 minute and the table was brushed after each course. The staff was polite and never interrupted our conversations in order to ask us  questions or clean our table. A small stool was also provided just for my girlfriends purse.

Magnificent food, artfully presented, graciously served in a most beautiful setting is what you can expect. My wife and I will never forget our 25th wedding anniversary dinner for two here. But it's what happened to us that evening that will tell you why Daniel is at the pinnacle of the restaurant world:I had made a reservation a month earlier. When we arrived, I learned that the reservation I made was for the casual bar/grill/side room where people dressed casually and you were separated from the main dining room. Disappointed, I told the hostess that I had made this mistake and that it was a very special occasion for us, but was told the restaurant was fully booked. So we said ok and decided to make the most of it.  About five minutes later, the manager came over to us and said ""I understand it's your 25th anniversary. Please come with me, Mr and Mrs P, your table inside is waiting..."" We we brought to a table where we were warmly greeted by at least 4 wait staff, who already knew our names and made us feel so welcome and special.  The soup to nuts meal was spectacular, and ended with a surprise cake made for us, with a personalized message of congratulations on our 25th.

5.0,7/27/2016,"KenScale: 9.0/10With all the restaurants I've been to in NYC, I still haven't been to a number of three Michelin starred restaurants like Per Se and Daniel. As much as I spare no expense when it comes to my culinary journey in the city, I have been less successful in finding friends or acquaintances who are willing to go as far as I do. Which isn't surprising considering how expensive dining out in NYC is in general. In the meantime, the restaurant world was thrown into chaos when Daniel, that bastion of fine dining from acclaimed chef Daniel Boulud which had maintained the highest four-star rating in NY Times, was demoted to three stars three years ago, followed by its demotion from three Michelin stars to two stars last year. Per Se was also dealt a severe blow in a rather scathing review from NY Times which demoted it from four stars to two stars as well. Does this mean the old-school fine dining as we know it is dead in New York City? You can certainly make a case; given the punishing rent and cost of operations, new restaurants have eschewed extravagance and opted instead for pragmatism in their approach. You don't often see new fine dining establishments that provide exquisite dining experience, not just for food but for the overall atmosphere and services as well. While my mom was in town, I decided to see for myself at Daniel. After my meal, I beg to differ on all the skeptics on fine dining in general and Daniel in particular. I've had quite a memorable dining experience.If there is any suggestion of decline in quality of food at Daniel for whatever reasons (people often cite the ever-growing Boulud empire that probably distracts chef Boulud's attention to his flagship restaurant), I just couldn't see it in the four-course menu (at $142 per person) that I shared with my mom (i.e. we got 8 dishes total to sample). The Long Island fluke with sea urchin, Granny Smith apple, seaweed crisp and white sturgeon caviar was expertly prepared with light touch that would do well in any fine-dining establishment, as was Maine lobster salad with mango and chayote-lime panna cotta that displayed complexity of flavor without overpowering my palate. The second course turned out to be the best in my meal. I seriously could eat the slow baked black striped bass with farm yogurt, wasabi and avocado-cucumber emulsion every day if possible. The bass was lightly cooked for impeccable texture, and the combination with avocado-cucumber emulsion that had soothing effect was simply marvelous. I haven't had a ton of escargots in the city before, but Daniel's ""petit gris"" snails with creamy barley and basil salad was another phenomenal dish that displayed a ton of richness but the ingredients all came together so harmoniously that I really didn't feel tired. Liberty farm duck roasted breast with dandelion flower marmalade and gooseberries was delightfully tender, and the salt crusted lamb chop (which the server pulls out of baked crust) with bean fricassee also displayed great textural effect even though I wish the seasoning were slightly even across the meat and overall toned down just a bit. The desserts were just as remarkable. Nougat parfait ""Provencal"" melons with lime biscuit and herbed yogurt sorbet had the absolutely refreshing quality that would neutralize any heavy meal, and lemon-bee pollen sorbet with honeycomb meringue, mango and papaya displayed memorable combination of ingredients that created very elegant flavor without being overly sweet. Getting a reservation is not as daunting as it used to be, but still I highly recommend booking in advance. The dining space was by no means empty during our meal, and my mom and I recognized a lot of celebrities out there dining with their friends and family. For gentlemen, jackets are required. I absolutely love the classy vibe of the dining space that is simply perfect for impressing your family, date, out-of-town friends, etc. if the budget is not an issue. The service of professionally dressed staffs was nearly flawless, and I enjoyed an Old Fashioned cocktail and a couple of wines by the glass. Overall, my meal at Daniel made me wonder whether all these talks about the restaurant not being what it used to be is simply overblown or whether the restaurant responded big time after all these skeptics voicing their opinion. Either way, I really couldn't find a ton of fault with my meal, and would gladly come back here for another special occasion.",12,0,4,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738

3.0,7/23/2016,"My friends and I (6 of us) had dinner at Daniel to celebrate our friends' anniversary. Overall it was a good experience but I've definitely had a better time elsewhere. We had the tasting menu and although the food itself was excellent, we could have probably enjoyed it more had the service been more attentive. For one it took a while before they realized they had forgotten to give us butter for the bread. The sommelier didn't do more than pour wine for the pairing. Throughout the evening, we had to occasionally look for the staff for basic little things which they could have easily addressed (water, more bread, etc.) without our asking for it.

4.0,7/16/2016,"Daniel's elegant, but understated interior decor is what I imagine lies behind the walls of an Upper East Side brownstone. As to be expected, this 2-star Michelin restaurant is classy, but fashionable, so you'll want to follow suit -- ladies with a pop of color (in your heels, perhaps) & gents with your best jacket. The menu changes frequently so I won't detail all seven (vegetarian) courses, but I want to rave about the highlights: -- COURGETTE: the zucchini flower tempura in this first course was not only beautiful, but delectable -- AUBERGINE: eggplant beignets were thin-skinned & fragile but not lacking in flavor whatsoever -- MAIS: grits seasoned with pink peppercorns -- DOUCEUR MIEL: I chose well, opting for the fruity dessert over the chocolate one. Delicate honeycomb meringue & refreshing, tropical elements.The meal doesn't officially end until you're offered a cheese course (so regret not saving room for this), warm madeleines, dark chocolates, truffles, & then sent home with a cannelé.

2.0,7/9/2016,"Totally understood why this place got downgraded from Michelin 3-star to 2-star. Three keywords: Overrated, Mediocre, Snobbish.For our dinner, bad experience started for water. They asked iced water or bottle water first. We normally go for tap water or still water (and it is always free even for Evian water in bottle) so we chose bottle. Then they asked still or sparkling, we chose still. The waitress said nothing about the water price. Finally, we got $12 charge for the Fiji bottle water which normally less $3 (and even the airports only ask for $5). For the food, quite mediocre. My husband and I always share food during dinner. We chose 4course prefix and and thus we could cover almost everything on the tasting menu:1) Two complimentary starter samples: We didn't get the points, especially the soup in the picture 1.2) The seafood fluke: The green-apple based sauce is too strong that the flavor especially the sea urchin got covered completely.3) Rabbit: it's ok. Not impressive.4) Snails: it's ok. My husband found un-cleaned sand when he tried it.5) Porcini: it's ok. Not impressive.6) Lamb: Probably the best dish tonight.Rainbow trout: Completely over cooked!!! It's simple sous vide with simple grill dish, but the chef over cooked it completely!!!! Cannot believe this could happen in a Michelin 2-star (and used to be 3-star) restaurant!!!7) Tiramisu dessert: Waitress highly recommended this one, but...meh...the sauce is way of toooooooo acid. The pastry chef seems mistakenly added double key lime.8) Dark chocolate: it's ok.9) Complimentary dessert sample: soso.10) Madeleine: not impressive.Ordered two glass of wine, which are good.Service: HORRIBLE! Our waitress is an Asian lady. Since we are also asian, there is no bias here at all. First of all, she didn't say anything about the water charge when asked. Second, after we ordered the wine and later hinted her that we are ready to order the main course, she ignored us and just left us there for more than 10 mins without any ask.Second, she was nice and polite at the beginning, but turned to cold when she found we only ordered the pre-fix menu which covered the tasting menu. She showed surprised that we didn't choose wine-paring although we already have two glasses of wine on the table. Afterwards, she didn't come to check if the food is ok, or if anything else ok, at all. When to choose the dessert, she asked if we want to coffee or tea, twice. We told her that we are pretty full and we normally don't take caffeine drinks at night. She showed her snobbish face, again!Hey, you, it's your chef and owner provided us the choice to go for the pre-fix menu, and it's our right to choose normal wine or wine pairing! We HAD tried more than 30 Micheline star restaurants, and it should be totally ok! Otherwise, why not to only keep the tasting menu + wine pairing which is what some other restaurants are doing?????? You gave us the choices, we reserve the right, OK?!!!!",3,4,1,N L.,"Chicago, IL",2,72,136
5.0,7/7/2016,"Now. We're. Talking!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Worth every penny, every nickel, every dollar.Whoever took away one of Daniel's stars (went from 3 to 2) should be permanently banned from the food industry, period. Good riddance to you my friend! I can't take that person seriously anymore. Daniel should be a billion Michelin stars. I've eaten at just about every fine dining establishment on the entire island of Manhattan and eat all over the world, Daniel is without question in my top 3 if not taking the #1 place.One taste of the foie gras and you will be instantly propelled into an alternate universe after your tastebuds explode out of your mouth. Sweet Baby Jesus! 2 out of the 3 occasions that I've dined here, Daniel was there (so now I have two photos with the man himself) which I thought was awesome.Ambiance: Perfect. Not too modern, not too old (not a fan of the decor/ambiance at 11 Madison Park, etc. and I'm quite picky) It's just right. The lighting is great. Everything works well. Even the bar is a great place to snag some food and drinks.Cocktails: White Cosmo was very tasty and shockingly light (not too sweet, not too tart), Cucumber castle (which is non-alcoholic but I added vodka to it) was also very good.The first bottle of wine that we ordered was too oxidized (bad) so we had to order another bottle but the sommelier was great about providing us alternatives to the bottle that we ordered.Food:+ FOIE GRAS - Don't step foot in the damn place without getting the foie gras. Even if you hate the taste of foie gras, I don't care. Even if you have never tried foie gras and it makes you scared to do so, I don't care. This is THE best. It is a must-order.+ Lobster salad+ Oysters - My friend stated that they were the best oyster's that he's ever had in his life+ Caviar - Worth the $400 price, YUMWill absolutely keep coming back.",5,0,3,Melanie A.,"Manhattan, NY",1284,565,388

Dressed in somewhat ridiculous black-tie clothing for a themed party attended beforehand, the staff passed no judgement on me or my date... then again I saw a couple that must've been in their 80yrs of age dressed similarly here a few years back, and the themed party in question mustn't have been too far removed from that couple's heyday.The tasting menu was off the wall, a brilliantly executed ride of tastes from greens to game.

They even brought out a stool to put my bag on so that it was not sitting on the floor. Our waiter was exceptional and explained everything to us. We did the 4 course meal, which although we thought it may not be enough food, it was MORE than enough! To start I had the lobster, followed by mushrooms, followed by wagyu and then the honey comb dessert. The wagyu was by far the best dish - so tender and delicious. The lobster was okay but nothing special. I'm giving four stars just because I could tell that the food was prepared perfectly, but they weren't the type of dishes that tasted indulgent and amazing. Like, I'm not going to be craving those mushrooms. Between each course came the bread basket. We learned that each bread basket is made to order per table. We took two pieces of bread each time she came around...they were amazing!!!!!! That garlic focaccia....wow. just wow.The dinner took 3.5 hours so don't come here if you don't have an empty schedule!

5.0,6/29/2016,"You know, compared to some of its peer restaurants, the four course prix fie at Daniel is kind of a steal. I won't go too far into the dishes because the selection will probably be different when you go but the dish that stood out most was mullet served with a tahini based sauce and these sort of eggplant macarons. It was a wild dish and the sort of deep nutty savoriness of the tahini plus the whitefish meat of the mullet was a combination I'd not tasted before and was quite blown away by.Anyways, the service here is incredible. I brought my girlfriend for her birthday and while she's more-less quit smoking she was hankering for a cigarette and sheepishly asked our super nice waiter who came back minutes later with a loosie wrapped in a ribbon and a pack of matches on a plate.

(It was my birthday) I was a little bit worried about dining at Daniel since I heard their service was different between the familar person and those who are not. Actually I dont need to be worried about it! Service I received that night was just amazing!!The host was welcoming and nice. My server was friendly and very polite. Prior to placing an order, I talked with my server for few min. and enjoyed the conversation with him. I ordered a glass of wine, fluke, foie gras, wagye, and chocolate dessert. Oh.. bread was sooo good. It was served warm and so delicious. And 3 amuse were also great. Since I love bread and amuse, I had a high expectaion about main dishes. Before my appetizer was brought to me, I got a complimentary lobster dish from the chef! I did not expect it and really appreciate. Fluke and wagye were good but my favorite was FOIE GRAS. It was best foie that I have tried. After I finished my meal, I had to choose dessert but it was hard to decide. My server recommened chocolate dessert so I chose it with coffee. BUT actually I received two desserts! My server said me that graduation is the one of biggest event in my life and congrats it. At that night, I just only one table that dined alone. However, I did not feel alone. Every staffs were just awesome. (One of them took a picture for me :D). They made a conversation but it never intrupted my meal. And they always smiled me. I felt very comfortable although it was a michelin starred and fine dining restaurant. When I received the bill, I realized that they did not include a glass of wine.. Oh my dear..

5.0,6/18/2016,"When I do a review there is a reason why I give three or four stars to most of the ""very good"" to ""excellent"" restaurants I dine at. And that is because there are a few - like Daniel - that deserve five stars because they are indeed head and shoulders above the rest. My wife and I went to New York for our 40th anniversary. We wanted to dine at a top notch restaurant (Michelin starred or the equivalent) for our celebratory meal. Our anniversary fell on a Monday so a bunch of places that met our criteria were closed. Daniel was open, had a table available, we love French inspired food, so I booked it. From the moment we walked in it was obvious they do it right. A bit early for our table, we were offered a seat in the lounge. The waiter inquired, ""Would you like a cocktail?"" ""No thanks,"" we replied. ""We plan on a wine pairing tonight."" ""I understand. May I offer a glass of cold water instead?"" It was much appreciated. Our table was ready at the time of our reservation. Our server appeared promptly greeting us with a cheery ""Happy Anniversary"" (as did the sommelier and other staff when they first appeared table side). We started the evening with glasses of champagne. Soon afterward we were presented the menu to look at -- though I don't think we needed to spend much time going over it since we did our homework and thanks to their excellent web site we knew that Daniel offered a seven course tasting menu. We also knew that the sommelier offered a standard and premium wine paring. So we actually knew exactly what we were going to order before we even stepped through the front door -- the tasting menu and the premium wine pairing.A lovely amuse and an tasty appetizer trio were served as we finished up our champagne. Then the real fun began. The progression of the menu, the pacing of the meal, and the pairing of the wine were all outstanding. And the food was pretty darn good too -- sensational, seasonal, locally sourced  ingredients; expertly prepared; well conceived in flavor, aroma and texture; and all artfully plated. [For us: Fluke (ceviche style with uni, caviar, granny smith apple), Minted Pea Soup (with crawfish & pea tendrils), Soft Shell Crab (tempura with nama yuba, pickled spruce tips & kafir lime bisque), Escargot (with spring garlic, fiddle head fern, pioppini & barley), Trout (with asparagus, red grits & nettles), Waygu Beef Tenderloin (with morels, pommes almandine & fava bean mousseline).]The sommelier hit a home run with the wine pairings. Each wine was poured just before the course was served so we had ample time to take in the bouquet and have a first taste. The wine paired with the escargot was particularly successful (Domaine Bzikot Puligny-Montrachet ""La Roussell"" Burgundy, 2013). It reminded me of sawdust on the floor of a woodworker's shop. But it paired exquisitely with the earthiness of the escargot dish.There were two options for dessert on the tasting menu and as we debated which to choose, both were served with ""Happy 40th Anniversary"" piped in chocolate on the plate. For an encore we were offered delicate chocolate candies to nibble on and a petit babas to take home and enjoy later They also printed us a souvenir menu to remember the evening. Was Daniel perfect? I'd have to say, ""No."" I thought the bread was average (though the butter with specialty salts was a nice touch). There was a bit of silver skin tissue in my wife's waygu beef tenderloin (but 99.48% of it melted in her mouth). The dishes, though flavorful and beautifully prepared, were not what I would call cutting edge or innovative. And the tasting menu with premium wine paring is pretty pricey. (But I like to think of it like this -- it only us cost us $16.25 per person per year over the 40 years of our marriage! That's a bargain if there ever was one!)In the end, was the evening at Daniel excellent and worth every cent? Yes, without a doubt! Daniel delivered!!",1,0,0,Paul F H.,"Hazelhurst, WI",35,131,99

I've been to a few fine dining restaurants as my girlfriend is a foody, but this one is far and away the best. Excellent service and amazing, perfectly crafted, beautiful food. The meal is rather long, but if you can eat a four or seven course meal here in less than three hours, you should do competitive eating as the portions are larger than most tasting menus I've seen. I was so full at the end of my four course meal. The wine list is more than extensive and the waitstaff is more than happy to help you to pair wine with your meal. And the cosmopolitan my gf ordered had an orchid leaf in the ice cube.Also, the most incredible experience for me: they remembered all of my food allergies, all of the wait and kitchen staff were aware and prepared, AND the chef asked me if I could eat the Foie Gras if it had been fed with one of my allergens.

4.0,5/29/2016,"Something I'll probably regret until my dying breath is going to my dinner reservation hungover. But even then, the food was delicious. I'm a huge fan of Daniel Boulud and his flagship restaurant didn't disappoint. Pros:- My waiter was really conversational! The service isn't as canned and rehearsed as a lot of other upscale restaurants, which I appreciated.- $142 for four courses is very reasonably priced. I ordered the foie gras, Maine lobster, pork chop, a and peach dessert (forgot what it was called exactly). I went back in August 2015 though, so the menu has probably changed since then. The lobster was perfectly sweet and rich, yet the flavors were delicate. The pork was carved before me and served with the jus drizzled on top. - Complimentary warm fresh-baked madeleines and a chocolate canelé to take home after! - Well-sized portions. I was a bit too full (not that I'm complaining), but I'd pick that over leaving hungry any day. Cons:- This only applies to the lounge, since I opted for it over the main dining room, which is significantly more formal and caters to a more mature crowd. This is a bit nit picky, but the tables in the lounge were a bit too close together for my taste. I also would've preferred more lighting, since it was rather dark. Tips:- Jacket required for males in the main dining room. - Get one of the pastries for dessert. The French know their butter. I got a lighter, cold dessert, which was still yummy, but after tasting the complimentary sweets, I knew I'd made a mistake.",6,6,4,Erica Y.,"San Francisco, CA",263,27,72
5.0,5/29/2016,"My boyfriend brought me here for our 6-month anniversary.  He made a dinner reservation for 10:30pm as it was the only time slot available.  When he called to see if they could move us up to an earlier spot since we both were very hungry, the hostess was very nice to try to see if they could seat us earlier (my boyfriend asked if they had a table reserved for Kayne West in case he would stop by and maybe they could seat is at that table early :D).  However, they were fully booked that evening and the hostess said they also had someone famous going there that evening.  Even though they could not accommodate us for an earlier seating, they agreed to put us at one of the more romantic spots at the restaurant.  Upon arrival, we were greeted by the hostess and taken to our table.  When our server came over, he said ""the hostess mentioned that you were hungry, so I am going to give you the menus as soon as possible.""  And another person brought over a mini stool for my purse.  They placed us at a spot where we're facing the floral arrangements and decorations towards the back of the restaurant (so the hostess took great notes about us being hungry, etc.  the attention to details is very impressive!) For dinner, we ordered the 4-course prix fixe.  Amuse broche - Blue cheese tarts - I don't like the taste of blue cheese, so no comment on this. Salmon sashimi, Beet purée and shrimp - all 3 dishes were done in an excellently way.  The beet purée is probably my favorite, it's light and flavorful. First course - 1. Quail and foie gras galantine - the quail was cleverly cemented to a bed of foie gras and both were seared.  It came with pieces of hazelnut toasts.  This is an innovative way to enjoy the quail with foie gras, as normally, you would just stuff foie gras cream with the quail and honestly the whole combination would just make your meat more gamey.  And surprisingly, this combination/version by the Daniel is not gamey or greasy.  Very nice execution of this dish! 1. Fluke - they poured a sauce over the fluke sashimi, the sashimi was topped with white sturgeon caviar and sea urchins.  It tastes very fresh. The dish is perfect for summer as it has a very refreshing citrusy taste.  One of my favorite dishes of the night. Second course - 2. Halibut - this is probably my least favorite dish of the evening.  It is slow cooked and topped with clams, Swiss chard and lemongrass emulsion.  The fish itself doesn't really stand out and it's not very flakey.  The buckwheat stuff on the side just tastes weird and bland and seems to have no reason to join the rest of the ingredients for this dish.  I do not recommend ordering it. 2. Escargots - it's garlicky, encrusted with creamy barley, etc.  It's perfect! Third course - 3.  Wagyu beef tenderloin - ordered it medium rare.  The meat was cooked to perfection.  It's very flavorful.  And the Daniel's not trying to overpower the taste of the steak with pepper.  I would recommend this dish. 3. Duck - it's delicious.  The skin is crispy and the meat is tender and moist.  The goji berries, etc. make it less heavy. Forth course - 4. Saint honore - oh my! Oh my!  This is the highlight of the night (or highlight of my life :D).  The Daniel's version of the Saint honore combines the classic with Salted Pistachio Cream, Fraise des Bois and Linzer Sablé.  And that combination makes this classic dessert taste even better.  When I took my first bite of the dessert, I thought I was in heaven.  The salted pistachio cream on the tart shell was so delicious.  And my palate was stimulated with the sourness of the fraise des bois and it was like a big and memorable party in my mouth.  After the meal, all I could think about was Daniel's Saint Honore, and my boyfriend questioned who I was thinking about (because he thought Saint Honore's a person :D). 4. Chocolate - this chocolate dessert presents different forms of chocolate sweetness but it's nothing too special. After desserts, we were presented with a tray of chocolates to choose from.  I would recommend trying one of each.  And they also sent us warm madeleine, the basket came with 4-5 pieces of warm right out of the oven Madeleine, they were delicious. At the conclusion of the meal, they give you a complimentary Canelé (wrapped in a ring box packaging) to take home.  I had it the next morning, it was delicious. Knowing that it's our anniversary, they were kind enough to give us a complimentary dessert with a lighted candle, the shell surrounding the candle looks like wax, but it's actually edible white chocolate.  The dessert was made with chocolate with a little bit of raspberry sauce, coincidentally, a perfect analogy of what a relationship is usually like - it can be sweet or bitter or sour (sad) at times. On a side note, tea and coffee do not come with the prix fixe, you would need to pay extra for those.  A pot of tea is about $20+.  Service at the Daniel is exceptional.",4,0,1,Peggie Y.,"New York, NY",223,199,2692

Superb wine selection, even their wines by the glass were impressive. And of course, the food!!!  OMFG man that food was OFF DA HOOK!!!  For just me, it was $360, and I was on the cheap end I think.

3.0,5/20/2016,"Had a reservation for 9pm on a Thursday.  Didn't leave until 12:30am.  For a four course meal, I found this pretty unacceptable.  We weren't seated until 9:30, but the wait time in between each course went up to almost 20 minutes.  While my table was very chatty, all of us still wanted to leave within a reasonable hour and not fall asleep at our table.  I mean I had a 3 hour meal at Per Se, but that was like a 9 course meal plus like 5 amuses with a fireworks ending and I never found myself wondering where the hell my food was.For the meal itself. The food was very good and the flavor pairings were very interesting, but nothing blew me away. There were points of the meal where I thought the unique flavors started erring on the side of weird.  I tried the lobster for the first course and some of my aunt's fluke.  While the flavor was sort of what I was expecting - there was too much GEL in both dishes.  Like the entire time I felt like I was eating lobster and fish jello ... and while that wast interesting, it was borderline weird.  For second course I had the sea bass and I tried some of my tablemates halibut and foie gras.  YOU HAVE TO GET THE FOIE GRAS.  It was out of this world.  My seabass was whack.  Too much cucumber flavor and the sea bass might as well have been regular boiled fish chunks.  The halibut sauce though was amazing and I'd recommend that over the sea bass.For the main course I got the rabbit ravioli and tried some of my tablemates' wagyu beef and duck.  The rabbit ravioli was AIITE, it was kind of dry though, like the pasta felt thick and leathery and the rabbit was sort of overcooked.  And at some point I bite into this weird flat bone that was IN the ravioli and not a part of the little shank sitting on top.  My boyfriend's duck was good, but the fennel concoction on the side was WEIRD.  The raw fennel under the roasted fennel was too raw tasting and there was not enough seasoning so it was just tasted like licorice.  My aunt's wagyu was good.  Fair to say it's better to stick with the rich foods here.Dessert.  The only thing that was good was the saint honore.  I got the rhubarbe and thought the rhubarb/riseling cream pairing was weird and too sour.  Boyfriend's chocolate cake was kind of dry.  And the miel thing was just not good.  Didn't taste like anything.But uh yeah.  I can see why Daniel lost its 3rd star.  The service and the food were both just so mediocre for the type of place it is.  Like, I wouldn't even compare my experience here to my experience at Eleven, JG, Per Se, or any of the other giants.  It's like on par with Marea.  In fact, I would say the food at Marea is better, and it's at half the price. My lunch at Cafe Boulud during RW one year was better than what I ate here.   At $174/ four course tasting, your'e paying over 40 a dish.  And it's certainly not worth that.  Especially when you think about all the great food here in NYC nowadays.",2,1,0,Biqi C.,"Manhattan, NY",67,247,58
5.0,5/18/2016,"DAMMMMMMN DANIELThis establishment is just over and beyond. I think most people have a very high expectation going in, and every expectation is met and exceeded. My family went and got the tasting menu and it was so much food that we were asking them when it was going to end by the third dessert round... Even the bread basket was phenomenal and I usually don't like filling up on bread. The pea soup was soooooooo creamy and smooth. I honestly hate pea soup, but if I could, I would bath in it. It's so good. The escargot is phenomenal as well, with everything cooked perfectly. The textures in each dish mesh together perfectly, and compliments one another. The service is equally on par or even beyond the food. It was my graduation dinner, but we didn't tell anyone in the restaurant. My mom handed me a card and I guess the floor manager saw it. During our first dessert course, they brought me an extra dessert with congrats on it and even printed out a memorabilia menu that said congrats to take home. We were never waiting on someone to come around, but it wasn't intrusive as well. I think service really makes or breaks a restaurant and this was definitely some 5 star service. If you have an opportunity to treat yourself or a loved one, GO HERE instead of spending it on a material gift. It'll definitely be worth it.",1,8,0,Linda S.,"New York, NY",219,109,26
5.0,5/17/2016,"What an experience! What a pleasure! What a delight! My friend and I celebrated my birthday at Daniel and I'm not even sure how to pen the experience to paper. We walked in and were graciously greeted by rather friendly women at the reception desk who then proceeded to show us to our table. The table we sat at was interesting as we were seated next to each other instead of facing one another. For a moment there it annoyed us but it grew on us the moment our waiter brought the menus and amuse bouche.We were offered a choice of doing the 4 or 7 course menu with a choice of wine pairings too. We chose the 4 course as the 7 didn't have the dishes we thought we'd enjoy. And then chose the $135 wine pairing menu. What amazed me most was the amount of staff serving us in a short 3 hours. It was incredible. So we scoured the menu and eyed the dishes that we felt would be incredible and began the ordering process. First course -- Long Island Fluke and Quail and Foie Gras Galantine. Second Course -- Slow Cooked Halibut and Vodka Flambéed Hudson Valley Foie Gras. Third Course -- Liberty Farm Duck and Imperial Wagyu Beef Tenderloin. Fourth Course -- ALPACO and ILLANKA. While waiting for our food to arrive, we were presented with the amuse bouche and then another dish shown in the pictures I have posted. When we were done with that, a server came around with the most phenomenal breads I have ever tasted with butter and salts so remarkable it was hard to resist not taking more as they came around again. True tastes of Paris right here in Manhattan.Each dish arrived to our table with incredible presentation, presentation worthy of a recording. For shame we were so busy salivating over the dishes there was no time. I ordered the Long Island Fluke as my first course but felt the tastes of the sauce was very overpowering and took away the beauty of the caviar and fluke. My waiter noticed and offered us both the Asparagus dish before our second course arrived. If you do find yourself sitting at Daniel, I demand you absolutely order the Hudson Valley Foie Gras and the Imperial Wagyu Beef. They were the highlights of the night. Especially with the wine pairing the sommelier chose. When we were done with our first three courses, the waiter presented us with the dessert menus. (The fourth course written above). Before they brought the dishes we ordered they brought out another dessert dish with a Happy Birthday Rebecca note. I thought that was really nice and thoughtful of them (and my friend of course). They brought the other two dessert dishes on the heels of that one. Gosh! Seriously -- Daniel puts so much effort in creating this world of flavors and stories in such small edibles -- I want to cry! Our waiter finished off our meal with 3 little dessert items and small chocolates -- Chili and Passion Fruit --.From A - Z there were no glitches. No disappointments. No aggravation.Happiness! Pure pure happiness and elation. After this dinner was done I thought to myself, how could I possibly go back to eating the trash NYC presents :P (I'm kidding - don't hit me).",22,7,18,Rebecca A.,"Brooklyn, NY",649,275,2445

5.0,5/14/2016,"For our 20th anniversary, my husband and I dined here at one of the fanciest and yet most comfortable restaurants I've had the pleasure of experiencing. I wasn't sure they'd be able to accommodate my dietary restrictions (strict vegetarian and no eggs), but they surprised me with an exquisite four-course tasting menu, complete with a complimentary amuse bouche selection. Course for course, I was given masterpieces every bit as flavorful and creative as those my non-vegetarian husband was enjoying. I started with a lovely spring pea soup, then had a risotto made of hearty grits covered with shaved asparagus and green nettle foam, followed by pureed fava beans topped with the most amazingly chewy, earthy morel mushrooms, and for dessert they went off-menu using stacked chocolate rings with chocolate piping in between each layer, and fresh made raspberry reduction to provide an artistic finale. We were there for over 2 1/2 hours, enjoying every minute of our foodie adventure. The fleet of servers were the finest staff I've ever seen. They always had two people bring out all our dishes, so that they could put the plates down on the table at the exact same time. Then the assistant server would leave, and our main waiter would explain each of our dishes to us. They were a most gracious, professional staff, so highly coordinated and attentive to our needs.While it certainly was an expensive evening, there was no question that it was worth every penny between the generous servings, all the complimentary surprises, and the incredible service.

There are two prices for the wine pairing. We went with the less expensive selection and again were very pleased.  The pairings were classic and I thoroughly enjoyed a glass of Sauternes with the above mentioned Foie Gras.

Seats were on a couch bench and comfortable chairs. We had a 5 courses menu.

For the first course, I ordered lobster - which came in large and nice place and tasted as good as it looked.For the second course, I had halibut. It was okay. Just like other great other NYC French restaurant style, nothing special to me at least. Out of all the fish I've tried in the city, I only remember it from 3 places: several Chinese restaurants, Salinas, and Bohemian Restaurant. Recommend you try other dish as a second course if you can.I ordered suckling pig as my third course. Again, it was okay to me. It's my first time trying French style suckling pig. But I still prefer how Cantonese cook suckling pig... more juicy.Desserts I had pistachio cake with some ice cream. I love it! And I find a rule - dessert with pistachio is never a bad choice....I was on cold that day so did not order alcohol, but I had yuzu with matcha drink, which is great as well.Also, Daniel gave me a surprise birthday cake.

5.0,4/3/2016,"If you are searching for the perfect fine dining experience, THIS IS THE PLACE!!! Last night my family and I dined here. This is a fine dining restaurant (Michelin starred), so I would recommend booking early. We booked pretty last minute so the only time slot left was 10pm. This was my best dining experience in NYC thus far. We all ordered the four course menu and each ordered a glass of wine. (I'd personally recommend getting red, its a better pairing for most of their dishes). The food was absolutely amazing. It was elegant, the plating was gorgeous, and the food was high quality and tasted delicious. The unique ingredients and recipes reflected well of fine French dining. Each dish was a joy to look at and to taste. Must try: 1. their foie gras (the chef is the best foie gras chef in all of NY!), they flambé the sauce and everything in front of you/by your table and is fun to watch! (I'm not a fan of foie gras but it was delicious)! 2. The wagyu beef tenderloin. Just spectacular. 3. The scottish langoustines (I don't eat shrimp but my sister & mom both loved it). Don't get: Mediterranean red mullet confit. This was the only dish in all the dishes that we ordered that night that we did not enjoy. It tasted really fishy in a not so pleasing way and was disappointing. This restaurant also had the best service I've experienced in NYC. I've been to other fine dining places and the service had all been good but Daniels service is A++.

5.0,3/24/2016,"On a rainy Manhattan Tuesday, My family and I went to Daniel where we had one of the best restaurant experience of our lives.When you walk in, you are greeted by the coat check. When you walk down a bit further, you see the lovely dining room of Daniel with a classy, yet urban chandelier-type of light which illuminates a good majority of the room. The intimate lighting sets the ambience for the restaurant. For the menu, you can pick between the chef's tasting menu, or pick your own 4-course from the 4 different sections of the menu which is what we did. I had the hamachi sashimi for my first course. For my second course, I was deciding on whether I should try the steak or their frog legs. I'd never tried frog legs before, so I thought why not try it at a good restaurant? Best decision of my life. Once I got past the vision of a frog swimming in my mind, they were easy to eat. The frog legs came in a bowl-shaped dish with an orange puree of some sort. This was during the fall season, so it might've been some type of squash or pumpkin. There was a good play with different textures in the dish, with some type of seed to give it a crunch, the smoothness came from the puree, the juicyness and tenderness came from the frog legs. They plated it so that there were little pieces of crispy frog legs within the puree and there was one frog leg with a little leg bone lollipop sticking out. Amazing part is that even though it was in a puree, the frog legs never got soggy.For my third course, I had the lambchop baked in clay. Our head waiter explained to us that the lambchop was wrapped in a banana leaf to protect it from the clay, they then put the clay over it and put it in the oven to cook. The waiter came with the lamb chops still in their clay shell and cracked the clay in front of us which was a cool visual. The lambchop was cooked around medium rare and it was very juicy and tasty.For dessert, I had their apple tarte tatin. The presentation was nice but the flavor was even better. At the end of your meal, they leave you with freshly baked madeleines. Hands down the best madeleines in my life, they also leave you with a cannele which is a baked custard pastry. (I used the bag that the canneles come in to put the rest of my madeleines in since I couldn't finish them, and they were too good to be wasted.)

Our dinner courses were plates beautifully and tasted amazing! I really like the cooked langoustine with a citrus cream! The turbot with oyster béarnaise was so tasty! And I also liked on one of the dishes the truffle was not shaved but a nice thick julienne it really brought out the flavor of the truffle.

The atmosphere is quiet and sophisticated without feeling cold and the staff are all very friendly and make a point to make you feel comfortable and at home. I dare say even personable. As I've dined at a few michelin rated restaurants, the staff can come off as ""acting"" or even robotic at times, but at Daniel I felt like I could share a conversation with any of the many people who came by our table.The food was beautiful and perfectly plated, the temperature was perfect and the flavor pairing original.I greatly loved the Scottish langoustines, the foie gras that melted in your mouth after it was prepared next to your table. I had the venison as my main course and it was perfectly cut, cooked and presented. The final desert course felt like an additional 3 courses as we had selected a desert that was then followed up with chocolates and freshly baked madeleines.I can't wait to go back and I hear they can do a pressed duck if you ask ahead of time, that would certainly be quite memorable!",1,0,0,Daniel M.,"New York, NY",2,21,0

Every plate was painstakingly prepared and presented, and the desserts were endless.

4.0,1/9/2016,"Turns out I saved the draft but never submitted my review. This is for Jan 2015. I heard about Daniel a long time ago but didn't know how I felt about spending such a hefty sum on one meal. Since it was the holidays, I decided this would be my Christmas gift to myself. The decor epitomized simple elegance. There aren't many people pictured because this was taken at the end of the night and we definitely closed out the place with a reservation at 10:00PM. Our 7-course meal started with a few dishes that were not exactly a part of the 7-course meal. The three dishes are actually a part of a trio of carrot dishes. First being a beautiful piece of shrimp with an acidic and citrus flavor, second the most divine carrot puree I have ever had in my life, and the third a smoked fish. SUNCHOKE VELOUTÉQuail Breast, Black Trumpet Custard, White TruffleHold a white truffle to my face, shave it directly on my plate, and I'm yours. The server was kind enough to let me take a big whiff of it and seriously, I felt like I melted in my seat. This dish pure magic. ALEPPO SEED CRUSTED SEA SCALLOPSBirch Reduction, Celery Mousseline, MatsutakeI am always quite skeptical of scallops at fancy restaurants. They are delicious but how do you elevate it to be different than other scallop dishes. This did not disappoint-perfectly cooked and seasoned. My second favorite scallop dish of all time. SAUTEED DUCK FOIE GRASQuince Marmelade, Early Mesclun, Candied Pecans  I consider foie gras to be my forbidden fruit. As a California resident, I am deprived from the tantalizing delights that the foie gifts to humanity. Unfortunately, I was really disappointed with this dish. It was overwhelmingly oily and I ate what appeared to be the liver lining or something chewy along those lines. ROASTED ATLANTIC TURBOTSpeck Ham, Savoy Cabbage, Fall VegetablesCaramelized Salsify, Ommegang Beer JusBy the time we got to this dish, I felt tired of eating. I wasn't full but the flavors started becoming very overwhelming. I come from an Asian background so I'm familiar with a lot of strong flavors, but I kind of grew tired of it. My tastebuds were hoping for a break. This dish was also a disappointment. It tasted like flavored fish-that was all it was to me. The vegetable roll was good though. EMMA FARMS WAGYU BEEF RIB EYERutabaga, Porcini, Lentils, HorseradishI wish this dish came out before the fish because I would have saved more space for this one. The meat, as you can see, was seared perfectly. The porcinis, hidden beneath the beef, was also a delight. Notice that fried scallion-I kind of laughed when our server noted the single scallion, but it was the best damn scallion I ever tasted. JARDIN EXOTIQUETamarind Parfait, Papaya, Pomegranate PearlsPassion Fruit-Mint SorbetSo begins the desserts. It was definitely a welcomed introduction to my palate. This dish was lots of fun with many colorful elements. I kind of thought it was hilarious that they had a boba though. ATOME ROUGETainori Sphere, Chocolate-Almond Financier, Red Fruit-Black Tea Ice CreamOur final official dessert plate. I didn't care much for the sphere but the ice cream was delightful. Overall, I had a delightful time at Daniel. The flavors were outstanding and I tried a lot of things I never even knew existed. The dishes are a true testament to the creativity and innovation that earned it its two stars.Would I go again? Probably not. The food was great but not memorable-my favorite dish was the carrot puree.  The tasting menu was not as balanced as I would have liked and I was just not amazed.

Yes, it can be a bit intimidating when you walk in and feel like you should be wearing your best cashmere and pearl necklace, but the impeccable service makes you feel otherwise. Look up and admire the intricate moldings in the ceiling, the beautiful chandelier...the entire interior architecture of the restaurant is just breathtaking. We were seated in the center table that overlooked the entire restaurant; with the two columns along the side, it felt like we're looking out a window. =) Tasting:1) Quail with Fois Gras: good.2) Sea scallop ceviche: excellent. Perfect amount of acidity and so fresh.3) Hawaiian Kona Abalone: omg this is AMAZING. The abalone looked small, but sliced and put back into the shell with a nice crust on top. Every bite was sublime....wish it lasted forever.4) Bacon wrapped Yellowfin tuna: this is just ok. Tasted a little flat. I didn't think the lentil complimented it. 5) Caramelized Sweetbread with Licorice root: I didn't like this dish very much, maybe it's because I'm not a licorice fan. The sauce was a bit too sweet and ...well, licorice-y for me.6) Boeuf: came with both shortrib-mash potato concoction and wagyu tenderloin. The tenderloin was excellent- super tender.  7) Desserts: were good, but I'm not a sweets person. =p8) I highly recommend the Domaine Pierre Usseglio and Fils 2011.

5.0,11/25/2015,"So what is a trip to new York without having great cuisine and a mind boggling dining experience. Restaurant Daniel has been on my list for a while and even with a slight drop from a 3 to 2 star Michelin rating, I knew it was a spot that I had to hit on this last NYC trip. Boy was I glad that we had made this a stop for our final dinner in NYC. Daniel Boulud and his staff deliver with exceptional quality and precision. We made our way over to this joint on a Saturday evening with plans to head over to P.D.T for drinks. We arrived right on time for our reservation and was greeted promptly at the door and seated immediately afterwards. The restaurant décor is beautiful (yes I said beautiful) and with intimate table seating for all guests. The bar was elegant and we were seated in the lounge area. The servers were on point making it easily one of the best service experiences I have had. There will be no moment where you are searching for anything... and the timing of the food coming out is perfect. They were extremely friendly and ensuring that we had everything we needed at any point. We orderd a cocktail from the bar and it was amazing... they use some type of smoking glass to let the cocktail have the smokiness come through.  Perfection.We of course had to go with a tasting menu which consisted officially of the abalone, foie gras, Duo of boeuf, and the tarte tatin. They of course provided a few other small items throughout the process inclusive of the basket of warm madeleines at the end. Every dish is beautifully plated and the combination of ingredients is on point. There was so much food that I have no idea how people do the 7 course tasting menu as even the 4 course was enough to make me want to buy one of those pregnancy pants. They provide complimentary bread at the beginning all of which are delicious. The amouse bouches that were provided were excellent offering hints of culinary expertise.  The abalone was perfectly cooked and elegantly displayed, the foie gras was amazing along with the presentation that they made to cook it right in front of you. Perfect flavor to it and delicious. The duo of Boeuf was excellent as well again with beautiful plating. The beef was tasty and very well cooked to provide the right amount of flavor to it. The real surprise was how amazingly delish the tarte tatin was. I could eat this for days and it is not traditionally a dish I feel I would like. The madeleines were amazingly delish and even with being so full from everything we could not help ourselves but to devour all of it. The gifts of canele at the end was a nice touch as well (also which was delicious and I devoured a day later). This is the perfect culinary experience and best way to spend a good 2 to 3 hours.Sit back and prepared to be ""wowed""  It was quite the experience and I hope to be able to do it again soon.",6,3,3,Dan M.,"San Francisco, CA",1040,522,1704

I mean they have really good selections of wine and exterior & interior are beautiful but food wasn't that good and service just was standard compared to Per Se, Marea, Jean-Georges, momofuku ko. etc. - other Michelin star restaurants. We went there for our anniversary and I ordered the duck soup as my appetizer which the waiter recommended - turns out to be very bland and wasn't quite sure why he recommended that to me.

3.0,11/18/2015,"Happy anniversary dinner. This place is beautiful. We walked in and soon realized exactly how beautiful and fancy it is. My husband was lent a jacket for the main dinning room. Lol. Then we sat and ordered the 7 course tasting. Bread came shortly. Wide variety of bread but only the brioche was a favorite for both of us. And the butter was perfection along with the two different types of salt they offer. One is from France and the other is Japanese sea salt with charcoal. Both yummy. Then can our first course. Quail stuffed with foie and lined with truffle. Dish was good. Tender meat and flavors were not overwhelming. But did nothing to my inner foodie. Just ate it and made a face of acceptance. Next was the scallop carpaccio. Now I must warn you. I am an extreme sushi snob and my taste buds are my super powers. I would have to say that the scallops were not fresh. I could taste it over the lemon juice. It was missing that sweet light flavor of fresh scallops. Slightly slimy and slightly fish. Disappointment. Abc kitchen does it far better and they let you wear whatever the heck you like. Then it was on to the fish course. In which I supplemented my fish course for the Hake. The original course is smoked tuna wrapped in bacon. My husband however did not change his and I must say the tuna was disgusting. The fish was cold. It had a strong flavor that did not balance with the tuna. Sat on a bed of lentil paste. That looked like it had been placed for too long and left to sit. (Might have been why the fish was cold)  basically that dish was disgusting and also was not served to us the way it should be. My Hake was delicious. Cooked perfectly and flavors were amazing. When we asked them if the tuna was suppose to be cold. They responded no. But didn't do anything about it. Next we supplemented the sweet bread for some foie gras. And they wheel out the table to finalize the foie with some flaming liquor. And plate it in front of us. Adds to the experience, that is unless your guy over cooks the foie and it lands on the plate like a piece of chicken fully cooked. I did not touch it. Took one bite. And of course they were kind enough to ask. And generously offered to redo my piece. Little did I know they were giving us a brand new dish. My husband got a new foie as well. No complaints there. And this time they sent the pro and cooked it completely different way than the first guy.  They also sent a agnolotti with white truffle. As a show stopper while we waited. Nice gesture. That's good management! Last dish was the beef two ways. The steak was small but the best piece of meat. And by small I mean you can almost consider it sashimi size. And the other short ribs with potatoes was good as well. But not mind blowing. Summary Beautiful restaurant. I would come back for just the four course menu. And definitely skip the tuna and the carpaccio. I saw many guests with the lobster and that look delicious. I'm sure it was an issue of me ordering the wrong things.",3,0,1,Xin S.,"Los Angeles, CA",558,261,678

Like a renowned hostess of yesteryear, Daniel presides over the Upper East Side culinary world, offering slow service with a touch of arrogance and bland, underwhelming food. The only redeeming quality is, perhaps, the wine list and, I suppose, the wine list is to blame for the mold-resistant ratings this restaurant manages to maintain. Every time I visit Daniel (mostly dragged kicking and screaming by colleagues for work-related dinners), I can't help but think that one does not have to be arrogant to assert one's class and refinement - just visit Masa or Jean George's or Juni.

5.0,9/24/2015,"Having done no research on the restaurant before going, I was completely blown away by how amazing my meal was. I came here after an exquisite Swan Lake performance and was treated to one of the best meals in my life so far. The service, atmosphere and most importantly the food was so on point the entire night that it's what other restaurants should aspire to. I probably do a terrible job describing what I ate but be assured every bite was delectable. Food: My group and I went with the 4 course dinner for $135 which honestly with all the extra dishes in between our courses, was more than worth the price. We were presented first with an amuse bouche of a creamy dome on top of a chip of some sort. Wasn't my favorite of the night but the presentation was adorable. Then the second amuse bouche was 3 plays on potatoes, my favorite was the salmon chunk with fried purple potato. Then we got the bread. The butter was served in a perfect dome on a beautiful plate with some black and white salt on the side. Omg, the focaccia is absolutely the best with the cheesy top. I hate filling up the on bread but I couldn't help eating 2 pieces of the focaccia, 1 of the black olive and 1 of the brioche. Finally, the meal begins with the abalone appetizer. I've never had abalone before and this was quite the treat. The abalone was white and tender and the topping was so flavorful and creamy with a crunchy that it was basically perfectly composed. Next came the foie gras and it was literally the best thing I had all night and maybe all my life. I still dream about that foie gras. It was flambéd tableside and served with a duck jus. The plating was very artistic and creative but the flavor of the seared foie gras was pure umami. It melted in your mouth like butter with a slight sweetness from the sauce. Next came the entrée of seared suckling pig with a side of spetzel and it was absolutely heavenly. The pork was perfectly tender and seasoned well; I especially liked the course cracked black pepper on top and the sauce spooned on top tableside. I liked the spetzel but I would have preferred it to have a sauce of some sort it's a little dry on its own. Dessert: Then came the flurry of desserts. Since we said it was my birthday, I got a special dessert to celebrate. It was the most beautiful thing all night. It looked exactly like the most perfect peach but you break it and realize it's kind of like a cake with pieces of peach inside. I have no idea how they made it but it was gorgeous to look at and delicious to eat. Then came the coffee dessert I ordered that was coffee ice cream with a chocolate wafer log and chocolate/coffee crème on top. I'm probably not describing it correctly at all but it was ethereal. Then just when I thought I couldn't eat anymore, came 3 tiny bites of desserts: a pistachio and raspberry cake, a cracker with crème and blueberry, and another creamy dome on a chocolate chip. I thoroughly enjoyed every single one of the bites so much that I also finished my friends' desserts. Finally, came the chocolates. The tiny bites of chocolate exploded with creamy filling once you bite it. I can't remember all the flavors but the passion fruit one was very good. To top it all off, we also got a take home rum cake just to commemorate such a beautiful experience. Service: I've never been to such a fancy restaurant so maybe this is normal, but the entire meal had such flow and felt perfectly choreographed. All the food came at exactly the same time and wine glasses were always filled. The tableside cooking and saucing was very nice also for some of the dishes. Overall, an absolutely perfect food experience. Of course, I can't afford to come again for awhile, but definitely will be back once the wallet recovers.

3.0,9/22/2015,"Took 1 guest here for dinner.We were first seated next to the waiter station where the constant jangling of silverware and plates became too loud and distracting. Further, the waiters and busboys all congregated in this area which made us feel like we were being hovered over.We asked to be relocated and they cheerfully obliged.Many of the servers were wearing jackets which were far too small for their respective bodies. They seemed to be bursting out of their clothes.The waiter took our dinner order without asking about wine. We had to flag down another server to ask for the opportunity to order wine.Initially the amuse and following courses came out rapid fire; to the point where we felt rushed to eat and get out. Then, without us making mention of this, they put on the brakes. We waited over 1 hour for our entrees to be served, following the previous course. They must have known that something was wrong because out of nowhere the maître d hotel appeared and engaged us in a 20 minute discussion about pretty much nothing. It was obvious to us that he was sent in as a distraction to whatever was causing the inordinate delay in delivering our food. We ordered the wine pairings with each course of our meal. They were far too generous with the amount poured; given that each of 4 courses had its own wine pairing. Further, while we waited the hour for our entrees, they refilled the wine which accompanied that course. I asked for my beef entrée to be cooked to medium rare. Despite the 1 hour it took to receive the dish, it came out substantially raw. I left nearly all of it on my plate. The waiter noticed and offered to re-flame or replace. Given the late hour (nearly 11:30) and our lost ability to be patient, I declined. They reduced the price of the dish by $17 (odd amount, no doubt). My guest's empty cocktail glass, ordered at the beginning of the evening, remained on the table as we departed the restaurant.As to the food itself, I wasn't impressed. The fois gras was pretty good. The beets were very good. The desserts were bland and uninteresting.The space is very nice.

5.0,9/16/2015,"Still exquisite after all these years! Daniel Boulud and his expert staff haven't missed a beat at his flagship New York restaurant. We returned here after 8 years to celebrate our anniversary and we were as wowed this time as we were then. What surprised us the most is that every single table in the formal  dining room was occupied on a Tuesday evening in August. The crowd was perhaps fifty percent tourists and business diners and fifty percent regulars. There were a few couples like us obviously celebrating a special occasion. The three plus hour dining extravaganza began with cocktails in the lobby bar area. They had a seasonal gin menu and my husband and I both started with a specialty drink not offered on the regular drink selection. Both were spectacular. We were seated at a lovely round table overlooking the sunken main floor. This gave us a wonderful view of the entire dining room...great for people watching and to admire the servers as they scurried around delivering the most professional service I have ever seen and enjoyed. The decor has been updated to reflect a cleaner more modern flavor and yet the ceiling architecture, airy atmosphere and charm remains. While my husband opted for the wine pairing along with the four course prix fixe, I opted to savor my cocktail and enjoy a glass of wine in the middle of my meal. Here is the run down of our selections (photos have been added): Sea scallop ceviche, smoked sablefish gazpacho and jalapeño panacotta Flaked Atlantic Cod, Betterave-which is a young beet baked in a salt crustPan seared John Dory, Suckling pigAll of our dishes were divine but the standouts were the smoked sablefish and baked beet. Whether you are a vegetarian or a carnivore who enjoys beets, this creation is NOT to be missed. It will knock your socks off with its textures, creativity and table-side preparation! If I could make one suggestion for newbies it would be to save room for dessert and perhaps opt for the savory cheese course in lieu of a sweet selection. The signature chocolates and warm freshly baked madeleines are so wonderful that no other dessert is really warranted. Of course if you're celebrating, they'll write the occasion on your dessert plate and it comes with the prix fixe so it may make sense just to see the creations served. The service is on point...your water or beverage glasses will never be empty and they will make recommendations and accommodate whatever your culinary desire or restriction. And while all of this is happening, you almost never notice them so it isn't intrusive. Oh Daniel....wish I could come here weekly. Alas, our budget and schedule don't permit for such a regular indulgence but for those who dare to indulge and splurge on a $500plus dinner for two, this Michelin star chef still delivers one of the most sublime culinary experiences you'll ever have--- all in a very civilized and elegant atmosphere. The only stuffy element (if one can even call it that?) is the jacket requirement for gentlemen. They even have coats for toddlers as one of the young kids came in with his parents sans jacket. Still, the dressy attire is merely a reflection of the caliber of the food and service and gives diners an excuse to dress for the occasion.

5.0,9/14/2015,"Best value for money meal I've had in NYC (in the context of fine dining, of course). Each course was excellent: I had the scallop ceviche, Maine lobster and wild grouse. The ceviche was fresh, crisp and delicate. Let's not forget the buttery brioche: so crispy and flaky it more closely resembled kouign-amann than bread. The Maine lobster was oh so soft and delicate, but really the highlight was my dining pal's foie gras. They flambé the liver at the table to create an oh-so-pillowy slab that melts on contact with your tongue.

There were 2 price points & we were given the less expensive - too bad, since we actually would have chosen the more expensive option had we been asked.Our ""lead"" server seemed much more interested in impressing the table beside us & after taking our order, we were abandoned for the remainder of the evening until the check was brought out.  No big deal since there were plenty of other staff bringing out food & clearing plates but it was funny to see this person fawn all over the table beside us when we got zero attention from himAnother notable service item occurred after I left for the restrooms. The meal continued to progress...bread was served to the Mr & they even started to bring out our next course until he asked them to wait until I got back.  Service should be paused when someone leaves the tableFinal service item noticed was as we were leaving. There was no offer to help us hail a taxi - some places do this & some don't.... so just so you know they don't hereLuckily, the food more than made up for the service snafus & most dishes were amazing.  By the time our meal was over, we literally could not have fit in 1 more bite.Amuse of parm cracker & a creamy dollop of something I cannot remember (sorry!)Then a trio of cauliflower - sliced & mousses which were all yummy.  Then the meal began:HARICOTS FLAMBO - delish - Cranberry Bean, Chanterelles, Sage, Runner Bean, Australian Black Truffle ShavingsTROMPETTE ROYALE - not impressed - Grilled King Oyster Mushroom, Sautéed Bok Choy, Parsley Coulis, Crispy Yuba, Tahoon CressBETTERAVE - delish - Young Beet Baked in Seaweed-Salt Crust, Black Cardamom, Sicilian Pistachio, Chive Aïoli, Horseradish Crème FraîchePIOPPINI - delish - Sautéed Pioppini and Romaine Lettuce, Confit Yukon Gold Potatoes, Crispy Shallot, Green PeppercornBROCOLI - okay - Tasting of Broccoli, Charred Broccolini ""Quiche"", Broccoli Rabe, Gorgonzola Dulce, Mustard Frill, Nasturtium SaladFRAISE - delish - Tristar Strawberries, Basil Chiboust, ""Sablé Breton"", Lemon Omani SorbetGIANDUJA - okay - Abinao Chocolate Mousse, Gianduja Petals, Dark Cocoa SorbetThen out comes the mini petit-fours & mini-madeleines, followed by plates of chocolate.  LOVED the canelés they sent home with us!  We were completely stuffed!!Totals for our evening2 people2 Prix Fixe Menus + wine pairing3 hours ( not including time at the bar )Price $540 (before tip)",18,8,11,Adrienne G.,"San Francisco, CA",125,2450,2513

The desserts were amazing, and we somehow made room for all of them.  I misread the Turkish coffee (ice cream) on the menu, and the waiter brought that dessert to us anyway, with the Abricot and Gianduja.  The latter was very similar to one of the desserts we had at our wedding at the St. Regis and evoked such warm memories.

I was fortunate enough to have a connection, a VIP treatment so to speak that came through our dear friends. We were a party of 6 and received the most incredible and personal food experience ever imagined. Our waitress (American) was so knowledgeable, easy going that we continuously had conversations with her for long stretches of time.I've dined at Michelin starred restaurants before but nothing came even close to Daniel. We had chef's tasting;  course after course, the most beautiful dishes came out to our never ending amazement. I'd like to point out that each member of our party received a different dish at every course and that each dish was placed in front of us at the same exact moment! It was orchestrated like an incredibly precise dance. We had multiple bottles of champagne and wine (some of them complimentary) as well as the truffle course which I believe was extra $60 per person. I remember some dishes looked as though they were painted on the plate. Exquisite. Beautiful and memorable.  I highly recommend going to Daniel.

4.0,7/22/2015,"On the last day of my brother's trip to NYC, we went to Daniel. My brother is quite foodie, therefore we picked this place based on the Yelp reviews,The food was delicious, the decor sumptuous, the waiters and sommelier very knowledgeable and attentive (a bit too attentive if I'm honest!) I can't really fault the place and I am glad I went...BUT - I'm not sure I would go again. It was VERY expensive (even more so than I expected - for example, my brother deviated from the prix fixe menu and was charged an extra 78USD). We did have a pre-dinner cocktail and the wine pairing, but even so it felt expensive for what it was. I must admit, I had the vegetarian menu which, though tasty, was nothing mind-blowing, the other two in our group ate from the main menu and were more bedazzled.Basically, if you are a serious foodie or a budding socialite then this is the place for you. If you just enjoy a good meal but are neither of the above then you may not reap full benefit from the experience for the price you are paying.Also, remember that whatever you spend, they will add on a 20% service charge.",7,2,2,Whitney R.,"New York, NY",91,15,3

They brought me a stool for my handbag so I didn't have to awkwardly drape it over my chair for people to bump into. When my husband left to use the restroom the waiter came to fold his napkin and make small talk during which I mentioned we were celebrating an anniversary. After our meal was finished and we had finished dessert, he brought out another massive dessert with sparklers and a happy anniversary message on it; this is in addition to the warm Madeleine's and chocolates that just kept coming. Our tasting course at the beginning was a trio of celery and we still talk about how it takes such skill to make such and cheap and basic ingredient shine like they did. Can't wait to go back!

1.0,7/4/2015,"I visited Restaurant Daniel in 2012, and was blown away by both the quality of the food and the service.  Hands down the best restaurant at which I ever had the opportunity of dining.  Fast forward to last night (July 3rd, 2015): the seven course tasting menu was terrible, aside from two of the courses (lobster and beef).  One of the courses included sea urchin, which I was reluctant to try because of things I'd heard from friends who had eaten sea urchin at sushi restaurants, but thought Daniel could make it work; I was wrong, it was inedible.  The first cold dish included foie gras wrapped in chicken that was over cooked.  The service had also noticeably gone down hill from my last visit.  Needless to say I won't be going back.Per se (and even Jean Gorges) is a much better restaurant, and well worth the extra $100 or so for the tasting menu.  For those of you considering Daniel, don't expect much!",2,3,1,Andrew S.,"Manhattan Valley, Manhattan, NY",1,5,0

I've had better variations in small towns in Spain for 5 Euros. Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining and the price. I've our far more and far less for meals that were superior to this.

4.0,6/8/2015,"Disclaimer: #firstworldproblemsWhen I saw nytime's Pete Wells downgrade Daniel's from 4 stars to 3, then from 3 michelin stars to 2, I wasn't surprised. I felt kind of vindicated actually.What can you do if you've been to so many amazing restaurants and need to measure them against each other? Someone's got to get 4 stars, even the most iconic NYC restaurant, Daniel.  My husband and I came here on his birthday in 2012 and the food was out of this world. 5 stars without a doubt. It's the service that I wasn't as impressed as by. We usually ask a ton of questions about the food and how it's prepared. I don't expect the waiters to know everything, so we asked if he could find out from the chef. He said he would, but then he never came back. Also, I had to ask for my water to be refilled. Really? if I'm paying over $100 for a meal, I don't think that should have happened. Luckily we asked another waitress who filled our water and was able to answer our questions.

Daniel has been on my radar for a while and also my bookmark list.  We had the opportunity to dine there this past weekend, and it was fantastic.  I opted to get the pre fix menu over the tasting because I'm pregnant and have specific dietary restrictions.  It was easier for me to choose my own dishes based on those needs.  I did mention it to the waitstaff and they were more than accommodating making sure my needs were met.  The food was impeccably cooked and presented in a delicate way.  My favorite dish of the night was the butter poached halibut.  The fish was beautifully cooked and the pairings on the plate worked together in harmony.  I will also give major props to the St. Honore dessert absolutely divine.  The brioche bread was amazing and it kept on coming! Obviously everything we ate from the amouche bouche to the petit fours was amazing and the precision and attention to detail by the staff is like no other.  Daniel is a serious dining experience and you know it as soon as you enter the door.  The decor is beautiful and the tables are spaced far enough from each other that you will not be disturbed by other diners.  Definitely worth it if you are a true foodie.",2,0,0,Jackie S.,"Ho-Ho-Kus, NJ",62,75,37

2.0,4/25/2015,"Daniel is a fine-dining restaurant.  You are paying for the food, service, and atmosphere.  Unlike most other restaurants, it imposes obligations on its customers (obviously, besides paying) to ensure that mood and atmosphere are befitting a fine-dining restaurant.  For example, men are required to wear jackets.  My last dining experience left a lot to be desired.  The food was very good (although not as good as it has been in the past).  The service was very polished and professional.  So, what was the problem?  Unfortunately, our meal was disrupted because we were seated next to a loud, boisterous, and DRUNK table.  You know there is something wrong when you can clearly hear word for word the conversation at the adjacent table.  You know there is something wrong when a woman goes around to the other side of table to high five the server.  I don't blame Daniel for wanting to keep the alcohol flowing. Booze is probably their most profitable item.  However, they have a responsibility to the rest of their diners.  We were looking forward to a nice calm dinner at Daniel.  We didn't expect that we would be eating at a bar.",1,1,0,John T.,"New York, NY",0,112,0

5.0,3/25/2015,"As always, I like to start with the disclaimer that my husband and I are food snobs, Michelin Star fanatics, who settle for nothing less than excellence when it comes to dining experiences that are meant to dazzle the palate, and Daniel did not disappoint.  We were there for my husband's birthday on March 7th, a Saturday, and ended up arriving 30 minutes late to our 5:45PM reservation due to traffic.  The very first great impression was the restaurant's flexibility and accommodation of our tardiness.  They were formidable, kind and understanding saving our table until we arrived and did not even once make us feel bad about the delay.  We were seated in the main dining room and immediately impressed by the cordial yet well-adjusted service that was similar yet better than Le Bernardin yet not as good as Eleven Madison Park and Victoria and Albert's.  The som did a good job at helping me decide on a glass of wine that suit my preference for buttery oaky taste, and the two amuse Bouche dishes were phenomenal - best I ever had.  And so was the bread, best I ever had anywhere,ever, unquestionably.  And they kept bringing it around too.  Their butter was also amazing.  We chose the Chef's tasting menu, and every dish was excellent, perfectly portioned (I like very very small portions), exquisitely seasoned in a harmonious way, with beautiful texture and presentation - just devine.  The Chef's tasting that night was Poularde and Celery Mosaic, Chilled Oyster En Gelee, Slow Baked Jade Tiger Abalone (exquisite), Roasted Atlantic Turbot, Sweetbread Cannelloni, Thomas Farm Squab, and for dessert Jardin Exotique and Couleur Cafe.  Chef Daniel came out and I got to meet him, which was great since I am a huge fan (I told him I was star struck).  He did not stop at every table though, which actually made us feel very special since it seemed he had only previously taken the time to welcome back repeat guests and for us it was our first time.  I enjoyed meeting him very much, he is a true artist.  I also really liked our waiters, who were knowledgeable but unpretentious.  I am surprised that Daniel had recently lost its  third Michelin star prior to our visit.  It makes absolutely NO SENSE that Jean Georges has three stars and Daniel has two. It should definitely be the other way around.  I have been to both as well as to Le Bernardin, Eleven Madison Park and Bouley and Daniel, Le Bernardin and EMP are far superior to Bouley and Jean Georges, no question.  Apparently what sparked the reduction in status was the inconsistency of service, which we also noted.  We are unsure why, for example, our table was not presented the cheese cart while the table next to ours was.  Perhaps there is a reason, but it seems weird.  I loved that we got the menus to take home as a souvenir.  Overall it was just a marvelous experience.  One of the best dining experiences I ever had.",3,3,3,Camila M.,"Northport, NY",141,261,65

So you can read down to read that part but to get straight to the point on the food-the food was made well, but I've had better. (The Little Inn at Washington in Virginia comes to mind.)Dessert was amazing though and might have been the best I've had yet.As my girlfriends and I were waiting for a table, we were seated in a nice bar area, given water and treated very hospitably by the staff.As we sat to eat, the waiters were even more attentive (but not obnoxiously so). My friend had even dropped a water, and they rushed over but didn't even look annoyed. Just made us feel like no worries, happens all the time! Not a thing! Bathrooms are amazingly clean and the wait staff had someone guide me there which was awesome.My favorite moment though, was when I was I getting cold, I decided to put on my coat. I'm a clumsy moron, so this task apparently was too difficult for me-as i was about to get stuck not getting my arm into the sleeve-a member of the wait staff rushed right over and held my coat for me.

The price was not an issue since I was an invited guest and could order any thing I wanted.  The issue that I have was with the food. The size, the taste and I am a foodie.The food portions were TOO SMALL that I could not taste the food. Let me repeat that (the portions were too small to taste the food). It was a few small bites and each course was gone. If I had to guess the portion size of food ingredients on each plate, it was about 2 to 3 oz per course. Also putting two teaspoons of sauce on the plate does not cut it with me. I had the four course prix fixe menu for $135 and an extra main course entrée for $54. I eat the following: For apps, the slow baked Jade Tiger Abalone and the Grappa flambéed Hudson Valley Foie Gras. For main course, the braised Sea Bass and the Duo of Beef. For dessert, the Abinao Chocolate Mousse. The bottle of wine that we had lasted longer then the food.Like I wrote above the portions were too small to taste the food also the actual taste of things were simply NOT as good as I am use to, absolutely no wow factor when you place the food in your mouth. If it wasn't for the dozen of complimentary bread items that I eat every few minutes when they come by and offer I would have left the place hungry. At the start and towards the end of the meal they offer many complimentary bite size items as well, I guess to try to fill you up for the lack of food on your plate that you order. There were three of us and the total bill was $760 with tip. I would not order any of the items I had again and would never go back to Daniel.

I was not missing or looking for meat or fish. By the end of the meal my friend and I were so full that it felt like I could roll right on home. The flavors and presentation of our dishes blew me away so much that when I returned with another friend and ordered the monk fish, I actually secretly preferred the vegetarian meal I had previous weeks ago. Also, I preferred Daniel's desserts over Per Se's, which is another michelin star/fine-dining establishment.I wish I remembered the names of the dishes, but I was trying to enjoy the experience. The service was perfect. And you get a lot of extra sweet treats in the end. I think we were there for over 3 hours! At that point they needed our table for the other reservations (understandable). They politely offered us a table at the lounge with additional chocolates (and maybe a glass of wine? I don't remember at this point because that wine pairing can creep up on you).  The ambiance of that restaurant is truly romantic - one of the most romantic ones I have been to. It's also quiet enough that you don't have to talk so loud to your date and you don't hear the conversations of nearby tables.

I hate to even write this review since I am such a fan....My reservation was at 9:15 and we were seated at 9:30. Once seated, a server with an injury to his forehead came over with an attitude. My husband requested menus to come right away since we were hungry and ready to eat and preferred a speedier meal. He clearly did not like this. When we ordered our meal  I also requested a glass of rose champagne from the less than happy waiter. He said ""i will bring it right away""...flash forward 20 minutes later and I still did not have it. I finally asked another server if it was possible to have a glass of rose.  He did bring it right away and not one ounce of attitude was given. NEVER EVER has anyone ever had an attitude at Daniel. We were shocked. So, not only was service wonky THEN someone had a baby at the restaurant. I could hear it making noise while we ate. It's not very sexy or relaxing to hear baby noises.  Who brings a baby to a 3 hour meal? The couple with the baby was there before we got there and was still there when we left. That seems like child abuse. The food, as always, was interesting and an adventure but the service and the room is what we come there for on top of the excellent food. It's a package deal. Daniel? What happened to your impeccable service standards?",7,3,0,R C.,"Beverly Hills, CA",1,28,0
4.0,2/10/2015,"If I could give 4.5 stars, I would, but unfortunately some slow service at the beginning (say, being left alone at the table for 25 minutes) started the evening off unfortunately. Rest assured, though, this is an evening out, a luxurious dining experience in a gorgeous room and with lovely, attentive service (once they realize you're there.) The meal is 4 courses with other surprises along the way and develops boldly. The hamachi divine, the scallops lush, the squab scrumptious. My fiancé's venison dish was incredible. The deserts weren't great (a bit too Emperor's new clothes), but the basket of warm Madeleines makes up for it.

5.0,2/9/2015,"After I made the reservation, me and my friend started to count down number of days before we can enjoy this meal, and it eventually came. As a falling angel this year from Michelin three, people would tend to think food quality was not as consistent as before, it is not the case at all. As a perfectionist, I can only say it is impeccable.We tried the seven course tasting menu, and each course was prepared with detail. One course I especially enjoyed was our first appetizer poularde and celery mosaic, pairing itself perfectly well with the bread. Sea urchin was another one of my favorites, mixing together with the light flavor of lime.  Towards the end, both the mousse and papaya was the best memory to complete the whole set.They provided us the tasting menu as well as a small bakery as gifts. Such a classic experience as today is my friend's farewell dinner. I deeply enjoyed the whole night and nothing was even close.",6,3,2,Elaine H.,"San Francisco, CA",1221,1748,5633

I have absolutely no complaints whatsoever, everybody was so pleasant. If we didn't know what something was, we were politely informed.

5.0,1/24/2015,"Daniel reviewFor some reason Daniel was never on top of my list of ""fine dining"" establishments.  Honestly, I thought it was kind of cheesy and boring  to go there.  Of course everyone wants to go to Daniel and of course you kind of imagine what to expect.   To me, it was always in the same ""bucket"" as Cipriani, maybe just a nicer version.  Man, I was wrong! Ambience: Daniel has it all!   The dining room is spacious, gorgeous and dressy with tables that are a perfect distance apart.  You definitely will say ""wow"" as soon as you enter the main dining room... and that's a good start.  The crowd wasn't very different from any of the crowds you might find in other fine dining, fancy NYC establishments.  Maybe it's a little more ""uptown"" if you know what I mean.  I love the fact that for men its  ""jackets required""!  I even think guys should put on a tie.  Why not, you would really fit into the ""experience"" and you know what, the food would taste better!    As soon as you get seated the show begins.  You get all kinds of attention from the culturally diverse staff but in a very classy manner.  No one is rushing you and at the same time no one is neglecting you.  I was just mesmerized by watching the staff move through the dining room.  There wasn't any commotion or stress.  It was like watching a dance.  They were so fluid, so harmonious.  I felt like I was at the Bolshoi Ballet. Food: I got so excited and distracted by our ""arrival and seating experience"" that I forgot that we were actually there for dinner.  So, here is the deal with the menu.  You have two ways to go.  You can order a four course dinner or you can order the eight course chef's tasting menu.  For our first experience we ordered the four course dinner.  Next time I will definitely try the eight  course dinner.  For your first experience I recommend the four course menu.  Save the chef tasting for next time.  I promise you there will be a ""next time."" The food was orgasmic.  It seems lately that I'm enjoying ""food orgasms"" more and more than other...  Ok, I'll stop there. :)  The portions initially look small but you realize later that they were perfectly sized.  They want to make sure you have room for dessert.  Culinary presentation is definitely an art and Daniel Boulud is one of my favorite artists.  I can proudly admit it! Service Service is an equal part of any fine dining experience.  I always say that it is ""as important"" or sometimes ""more important"" than the food quality.  As you know, many times, an excellent service experience can make up for a mediocre dining experience.  I was worried a bit that the Daniel staff would be somehow obnoxious or have some kind of attitude if you weren't ordering the chef tasting menu or a bottle of Petrus.  Again was I wrong!  It was such a pleasant experience!  Everybody were extremely helpful, attentive and most importantly interacted with us.  They were really there to help us have great time.  They weren't there just to sell us something.  I have a word for that type of approach...professionalism.  It's exactly what makes you come back and ""do it again"". It was very fascinating to see Daniel Boulud in the restaurant, wearing his chef's attire and actually working!  I guess being ""hands-on"" does make a difference. Wait, there's more! The night got even better.  After the meal they invited us into the kitchen where I met, spoke to and took a picture with ""The God of Culinary Art"" himself!  Thank you Daniel restaurant and personally to Daniel Boulud for making my special occasion dinner even more special! ConclusionWhat can I say?  It was terrible?  Oh yes, it was so terrible that I couldn't stop talking to my friends about my terribly amazing dining experience!  All I can say about this experience;  it was ""once in a lifetime"".  Dining at Daniel was not just about having a great meal.  Dining at Daniel was like receiving a perpetual gift of gracious hospitality and culinary art.  I cannot say enough about their extremely high level of service.  Words cannot describe it.  You have to experience it for yourself.  We're going back.  I can then say this about the second experience; it was ""twice in a lifetime"".",3,1,2,Anna M.,"New York, NY",2,13,1

5.0,1/21/2015,"Phenomenal service and food! My original plan was to go Le bernadin but it was fully booked and Daniel happened to have a free slot. I'm glad we came we loved all the dishes and the service was incredible!Food : for appetizers we got the oysters and scallops they were both very good. Instead of the typical mignonette the oysters were topped with caviar and mousseline that gives it a great balance of acidity, which makes it very refreshing. It also comes with a side of uni. The scallops on the other hand were cooked to perfection. Nicely seared on the outside and still tender on the inside. Also the chips added a nice crunchy element to the dish. For the entree we got the sea bass and the duo of beef. The sea bass was superb, definitely the highlight of the night. The bass is topped with chives and mushrooms which was a great compliment along with the Syrah sauce which is not overpowering at all. I can still taste the freshness of the fish cooked to perfection where it's moist and flaky on the inside; it melts in your mouth. The potato garnish was also very delicious. The duo of beef so succulent and cooked to my liking medium rare. For dessert we had the borneo vacherin and pistache and because it was my girlfriends birthday we also got the chocolat. The Borneo vacherin was recommended by our waiter he said it's the chefs signature dessert. It consist of a lime avocado sorbet, coconut chantilly spiced Meringue with a green apple coulis. I thought it was going to be heavy because of the avocado but it was actually light and cleanses the palette which was a perfect end to the night. The warm guanaja chocolate coulant was also very good. Aside from all the dishes we ordered there were other compliments from the house such as the amuse bouche, freshly baked Madeleine's which were delicious, and an assortment of house made chocolates! Wish we could've ate more but we could barely finish our desserts. Service: the service as I said earlier is phenomenal but hey it's included in the price right! They also gave us free wine and an extra dessert because it was my girlfriend's birthday. The staff were very attentive everything came out in a timely manner. Atmosphere: nice and quiet very elegant perfect for a date night!

Solid movie though.So first and foremost -any upscale-elegant Michelin star restaurant that seamlessly weaves dub step, atmospheric drum and bass, electro house music and 90s trip hop into it's background sound system has immediately earned my lifetime loyalty.  I can only wonder why Michelin downgraded Daniel to 2 stars in September. Perhaps one of the judges had a bad experience in the Sahara tent at Coachella? I guess that's fair.The space at Daniel is restrained in it's opulence, yet the romance is very pronounced. The lighting is also perfect. The wait staff was attentive, knowledgeable, well-paced, and down right cool.  Our waitress that night was a ballet dancer with a heavy hand for pouring Chardonnays. We like Chardonnay - so we liked her.As for the food - it was all quite good.  We particularly enjoyed the Four Story Hill Farm Squab and the Tasting of Suckling Pig.Overall - Good job, Daniel...outside of Carl Jung who would have imagined that Portishead, Kruder & Dorfmeister and Skrillex would pair so well with Milk Fed Veal.Kudos Staff, kudos...",2,5,1,NJ A.,"San Francisco, CA",0,96,443

5.0,12/3/2014,"Quite possibly, one of the best meals I've ever had in New York City.I took my boyfriend here for his birthday celebration last year (May 2013). I made sure to tell the hostess during booking that it was a very special occasion- not really expecting anything out of the ordinary to happen but  to make sure we weren't bumped for the King of Norway or something. Arrival: We arrive at Daniel at 5:45 pm and were promptly seated (after the concierge asked E to put on his dinner jacket). The Maitre D' received us warmly and we were led to a secluded booth at the edge of the main dining room. He jokingly asked us if the table was private enough and the look on my boyfriend's face as he surveyed the spread was enough for me to give Daniel 5 stars.The Food: As expected, the food was superb if not better than the last time I dined there. All courses were well thought out and executed to perfection. Dessert was especially wonderful because they served us warm birthday wishes on a plate- chocolate ganache filled cake, macarons, truffles, assorted fruit dipped in milk chocolate. I need to point out that this was separate (and free!) from the dessert we already ordered prior.Service: Amazing. We got extra amuse bouches and cheese comped courtesy the great staff and management. It was all very fancy especially to E because this was his first fine dining experience but not once were we made to feel inferior and out of place. I really commend the staff for treating everyone equally and with extra special care. I especially loved it when we were leaving, the concierge asked us if we wanted a cab and I blurted out that we were taking the subway- she didn't even bat an eyelash and wished us a lovely night.Truly another great experience at Daniel and I plan to come back next year for my mom's 60th.",2,1,1,Ro C.,"Brooklyn, NY",173,372,106

5.0,11/18/2014,"Some people eat to live, while others live to eat. Daniel is a place for the latter who are not satisfied by simply eating food but truly enjoy experiencing it. I am blessed to be able to say I have twice had the pleasure of dining at Daniel. Each time it was not only the palatable food, not only the elegantly custom crafted cocktails, not only the delectable wine, nor the impeccably hospitable service that stole the show, it was all these factions amalgamating into a beautiful dinner. The cocktail list boasts a wonderful collection of flavors for everyone's preference. Still, since I could not decide the Sommelier, Aaron (if I remember correctly), made it a point to have the bartender whip me up something special to cater to my specific requests which was much enjoyed as it was appreciated. During my first dinner I was exposed to hard to get wines, craft champagne, and the best Riesling I ever had. I highly recommend Aaron to plan your wine pairing, and if you're a bit adventurous ask him for a champagne tasting. ;)I honestly wish I was better at describing food because I truly want to give Daniel the praise it deserves. I'm not the most familiar with palate, or wine pairings, describing textures and gastronomy. But I know damn sure when something tastes good. Each bite made me happy and excited for what was next. There were new flavors and interesting combinations, all laced fluidly with the smell and texture of the wine. Ordering from the Three Course Prix Fixe, and judging from the photos I had seen of the food, and the price, I did not expect to leave full. To my delightful surprise there were ""tastes"" of this and that, ""compliments of the chef"", as well as my favorite words, ""...and to continue we have..."" I am happy to say I left both times very full and satisfied.A formal dinning room can often times be, if not intimidating, off putting in a way that makes one feel self conscious. Pretentiousness creates an undesirable environment which causes me to lose my appetite. I was afraid that the servers in suits would be formal and stiff, a hint judgmental, and cold. Thankfully, Mark was neither of these, he was polite yet good-humored, eager to accommodate, and quite amiable. I requested to sit in Mark's section the second time I reserved a table. Unfortunately at the time we arrived, his section was full. After my second cocktail and on my way to the restrooms someone stopped to inform me that a table was available in Mark's section and wanted to know if I would like to be relocated. I asked, in turn, if it would be too much trouble. He replied, ""Whatever makes you happy madame."" And so Mark as well as Aaron, who was my sommelier the previous time teamed up again to deliver true hospitality. Let me make something clear, service is all the actions you do for a guest to ensure a smooth experience such as anticipating needs, making sure things happen in a timely matter, as well as keeping your guests happy. Hospitality encompasses good service and takes it to another level where you feel at home, you're comfortable and those who are serving you, you could consider a friend. For example, Mr. Guedouar, the service director, stopped by after dessert to greet me happy birthday, then continued to ask if we would like to see the kitchen. I could not believe it. I was more excited than a five year old kid going to Disneyland, but I had to play it cool. The entire staff greeted me happy birthday and welcomed us into the kitchen! The chef himself wished me a happy birthday and pulled us in for a photo. It was a spectacular night. Mark also hand wrote a comprehensive list of his personal restaurant recommendations which he put in an envelope for us to take. And on top of that he himself left the restaurant to hail us a cab down the block. I love it here.",1,0,1,Chelle S.,"Los Angeles, CA",108,102,198

5.0,11/13/2014,"We had the Daniel's selection. I have to say, the service is impeccable and everyone is so sweet and friendly... Really makes you feel at home. I left feeling amazing. Let me tell you, there is so much food and all of it is so delicious... Where to begin. The oysters with the gelee was spot on, I loved the quail breast with the white truffle (such excellent flavor! And the smell of truffle which they freshly grate is intoxicating), the sea scallop dish was to die for, the Atlantic turcot was cooked to perfection. The wagyu beef I felt was a bit too salty but to be completely honest, I usually don't eat red meat and I am sensitive to salt so that may have been a factor. My date had no complaints and loved everything. Oh my god, and then they bring you all these delicious desserts!! The freshly made madeleines were amazing. The passion fruit ice cream was also one of my favorites from dessert. Also, the bread basket!! The breads are all freshly baked and warm... My Achilles heel.. I may have had 5 or 6 of those. I actually wanted to take the entire tray of bread (and salted butter) home. Additionally, we had the cheeses which we asked for them to choose for us, all excellently curated. I can't wait to go back here again. Ah, and they give you a personalized menu to take home with you as a souvenir which I love. It was not any special occasion so there was just the date of the dinner but nonetheless I enjoyed receiving it.",1,0,0,Susan L.,"Manhattan, NY",33,22,0

4.0,11/11/2014,"From the moment you walk in, it's a very upscale dining experience.  As I heard a lot about the bar, we opted for cocktails.  One disappointing thing was that the large spherical and cubed ice cubes were not clear. I would have expected a flawless clean ice cube from them, especially at $20-25 per cocktail.1. Champagne mojito: a bubbly mojito, but not really my kind of drink2. Smoky bandit: all the things I like - mezcal, jalapeno, lime, pineapple3. Milanese falcon: Overholt rye, bitters, falernum, and montanaro barolo chinato. This ended up tasting too much like grappa to me4. Bitter blues: bourbon, cyanar artichoke liquor, honey, blueberry, and lemon oil. I could taste a berry flavor, but it wasn't obvious that it was blueberry.  This drink was a good highlight of the bourbon5. Salsa y passion: like a dessert, sort of reminiscent of a white russian but way more interesting. It had rum, Leblon reserva exclusiva, and most notably, a house made almond horchata. I couldn't really taste the maracuya, though. Onto food: they were able to do nice vegetarian versions of dishes for my mom, but I went with the regular menu1. Beet tasting: (a) Yellow beet salad with smoked sablefish. The sablefish was very well seasoned, not overly salty, and had a good amount of smokiness. (b) Puree of red beet with apple, chive oil, and cardamom. This puree was beautifully deep red and very smooth, well seasoned, almost with a meaty depth to it. (c) Yellow beet with bay scallop crudo, topped with a parsley pesto. The scallop was fresh and sweet2. Amuse of a kale panna cotta covered in a buttermilk foam shell, topped with a pumpernickel bread crisp.  The pumpernickel was a nice contrast to the smoothness of the other part of the dish3. Bread service: warm bread served with a house salted butter and a sweet cream butter.  My favorites were the garlic focaccia and the epi with poppyseed and white sesame.  The brioche was a little too much like a croissant for me4a. Scallop: Seared scallops topped with an aleppo seed crust, smooth celery mousseline, and amazing matsutake mushrooms. The scallops were very well seasoned and cooked just right4b. Langoustine: I stole some of this off my brother's plate. The Scottish langoustines were wrapped in an egg roll like shell, and I loved the subtle curry flavor of the cauliflower vadouvan veloute5a. Duo of beef: wagyu tenderloin that melted in my mouth, sitting on top of black trumpets that soaked up the reduction.  Then there was a piece of bone marrow (already removed from the bone), and then a cup of short ribs.  The short ribs were the ideal comfort food, sitting on top of rutabaga and lentils, all of which were perfused with awesome beef flavor.  This was kind of like 3 dishes in one5b: Tasting of milk fed veal: veal tenderloin, sweetbread, and tongue.  The tenderloin was very tender and was a bigger portion than I expected.  The tenderloin was definitely my favorite part, but it was nice that it was also like 3 mini dishes in one plateFor dessert, I got to try the following 3 desserts:1. Jardin exotique: a tropical fruity dessert with a tamarind parfait, papaya, and pomegranate pearls. The pomegranate pearls were interesting, but the passionfruit mint sorbet was the highlight of this dish.  This was a light and refreshing dessert2. Les mille pistaches: a chocolate shell half filled with a chocolate mille-feuille and half filled with a mousse.  I liked that the mille feuille was bitter sweet and had a nice crunch (not like a traditional mille feuille cake).  The pistachio fleur de sel ice cream was good but was on the sweeter side, and I had a hard time tasting the fleur de sel3. Warm guanaja chocolate coulant: the signature dish, kind of like a molten chocolate cake filled with liquid caramel.  Again, I wish the fleur de sel were more prominent since I'm a huge fan of salt + chocolate, and the coulant itself was a little too sweet for me.  The milk sorbet was nice and lightThey then finished with warm madelines fresh out of the oven (they smelled and tasted wonderfully buttery).  Then petit fours: an amazing black forest chocolate with a liqueur soaked cherry, a cassis puree on a crisp, and a tart lime gelee on crunchy meringue.  As if that wasn't enough, they then brought out the house made truffles.  I tried 3 of the 4: apple cinnamon, banana lime, and vanilla with Malibu rum.  All of them were beautiful bite sized pieces. Service was spot on - very professional, refined, and organized.  Plates were all served in synchrony, and pacing on the courses was good.  As to why they lost the 3rd star this year, I read somewhere that the ""Michelin inspectors found examples of food at Daniel that wasn't at a three star level,"" but each savory dish that I chose was done very well.  At $125 for the 3 course pre-fixe dinner, I thought it was extremely reasonable for a previously 3-star/now 2-star Michelin restaurant in Manhattan.",2,0,2,Marilyn T.,"Palo Alto, CA",81,2089,202

I placed my purse under my chair, they brought a small fancy schmancy embroidered and tasseled stool out and indicated it was for my purse. I busted out laughing, which was completely unappreciated by everyone except my date. My purse had its own seat! I mean, c'mon. Way to make a patron feel like they don't belong.

3.0,11/8/2014,"This is a bit of a delayed review. Had dinner here earlier this year and had been meaning to review. The key takeaway - my fiancee and i found this restaurant to be mediocre - and certainly not worth the $$ given the other wonderful high end restaurants in the city (have said it before, and will say it again - Eleven Madison is my absolute favorite). The food was actually disappointing - not creative. Some dishes were drowning in sauce, while others lacked flavor. Service was fine. Truly - the experience was just ... mediocre.

Three stars because you can't give a place like this anything less.SERVICEI've asked many colleagues these questions: What would you do if you saw a fruit gnat in your wine glass?  Definitely notify the staff, especially at a place as refined as Daniel.What do you expect them to do after you've notified them?Comp something, anything.  I would have declined the offer, but I expected something more than an apology, and pouring my contaminated wine into a new glass after the bugger was removed.FOODIt was a mess of flavors. I've been to Daniel equivalents and they all had better, and more memorable tasting menus.  It was considerate (and ironic) to receive a very pretty printed card of what we ate at meal's end, so that (in the waiter's words) ""you remember what you ate a week, a month down the road.""It also really saddened me what they did to that beautiful langoustine tail---  it was lightly fried, which killed the sweetness of this delicate crustacean, and all I tasted was salt. The time between dishes could also be shortened. Daniel did many things right. Selection of bread was wonderful.

5.0,10/29/2014,"Daniel is an iconic NYC restaurant, and while it's considered one of the best establishments in the city, has fallen from grace over the past several years - first with the NYT downgrade to 3 stars, and then the Michelin downgrade to 2.  In my books however, Daniel still remains a wonderful restaurant and one you should not miss if you are looking for a quintessential New York fine dining experience.My first visit to Daniel was in 2010, and it was perfect.  I was only a college sophomore back then, and I remember leaving the restaurant utterly wow-ed with the presentation, flavors, and service.  It was my first brush with fine dining, and I came in more curious than critical, since I had little to compare it to.Yesterday I came in with more exacting standards, and Daniel did not disappoint.  We were given two amuses bouches to start - the kale buttermilk foam was excellent - and a selection of bread to accompany our appetizers and mains.  I chose the parmesan and rosemary olive breads, both of which were delicious.  I'm embarrassed to admit I had seconds and thirds of this and ended up eating almost five rolls of bread.  I started with the Chilled Shigoku Oysters, and this came in a beautiful dish of 5 oysters buried under a mousseline, with generous amounts of caviar on top, and paired with three pieces of sea urchin.  My main, the Black Sea Bass was incredible and I now understand why everyone raves about the Syrah sauce.  I tried a bit of my friend's rabbit dish, which was beautifully presented, but too dry for my liking so I was very happy with my choice.  For dessert, I had the Warm Guanja Chocolate Coulant, which is basically a fancier way of saying 'molten chocolate cake', and I don't think you can go wrong with this if you like chocolate.  We ended with an assortment of petit fours, their freshly baked madeleines, and house-made chocolates.So yes, the food was good, as it should be, but what really differentiated Daniel from 4 to 5 stars was the service.  From start to finish, Daniel was extremely accommodating, and gave us just the right amount of attention without being overbearing.  The sommelier recommended an excellent wine, and the waiters made sure that our glasses were never empty.  One of my dining companions had a dairy allergy, and in addition to accommodating her when preparing her prix-fixe, they also made sure to bring out separate amuses bouches and petit fours that were dairy-free.  At the end of the night they found me a cab and had the door open waiting when I stepped out of the restaurant, which I thought was a nice touch.I do think the atmosphere is a bit stuffy, but that caters to the bulk of their clientele so Daniel is not to be faulted for it.  If you prefer something more modern and adventurous, I would recommend a restaurant like Atera, but Daniel excels at being exactly the type of restaurant it strives to be.",12,4,5,Angela W.,"Manhattan, NY",223,157,65

While we expected to be at Daniel for a minimum of 3 hours, we waited 30 minutes between at least one course and the next and found that service was actually relatively inattentive as the meal went on. I could tell that our server was surprised we didn't purchase a bottle of wine, preferring to stick with glasses of wine or drinks. The table next to us kept their attention given the amount of liquor purchased.In any case, the above did not keep us from having a great time, but the service isn't quite where the food is.",1,0,0,MichLee A.,"San Carlos, CA",9,470,2
3.0,10/23/2014,"So let me start off by saying that I feel a restaurant like Daniel has to be held to an entirely different standard than other restaurants who don't hold Michelin stars for instance. If I were comparing this restaurant to restaurants overall, I might give it 4 stars but chances are, if you're reading this review, you're looking for a fine, even perfect, dining experience and this is what I've based my score off of.     Let's start with the pros. First, the ambiance of the place is outstanding. If you're looking to impress a date, this would do it. Very gorgeous on the inside. Second, the service is impeccable. They are spot on with clearing your plates, resetting the table and making sure you have what you need. We loved our servers. The gentleman who took lead was very helpful and patient. Third, we had a few items that wowed us. We got the Bellecour tasting menu and the scallops and snapper were superb. What got my attention the most, funny enough, was the passion fruit sorbet. It was one of those dishes where when you taste it, you realize you've never had anything like it before and it's one of the reasons you've come to eat at a restaurant this fancy.     This leads me to the cons regarding our experience; the sorbet shouldn't be the only thing that wows a diner at a restaurant of this caliber. I've been lucky enough to have had some great meals in my day I guess because I've been to some where each dish seems to awaken new tastes and come together so perfectly that you respect cooking on a whole different level. This experience didn't do it for me and when you're dropping over $700 (wine pairings included) you feel a bit robbed. Every other dish we had was just...good. Another con was that if you want to do a tasting menu, they ask you and your party to choose the same one. I kind of understand the rationale behind this but if you're coming to a place to try epic food and you'd like to share some different items with your guests, it limits you. I suppose we could've done the 3 course prix fixe but we wanted the 7 course experience. Finally, while the meal was paced well for the most part, when it got to the dessert courses, we hit a snag. It seemed like we were sitting around waiting for a long time. Not a huge con, things happen, but once again, $700.     Overall, what I would say about my experience at Daniel was that it was good but not great and certainly not perfect as to the point to justify its cost. If I were to go again, I would do the prix fixe I think. After reading other people's reviews, I agree that there are probably other restaurants in NYC that can give you a better bang for your buck than Daniel can right now. Let me point out, as noted in someone else's review, Daniel just recently got downgraded to 2 Michelin Stars. Kind of have to wonder why.",0,0,1,Jared V.,"Sandy Springs, GA",0,1,0

4.0,10/13/2014,"We somehow managed to get a table at Daniel at relatively short notice and I'm certainly glad we did.Daniel Boulud sadly lost one of his Michelin stars for this restaurant and now has only two but there is still such high demand for tables here that there is at least a six week wait for a 7.30 on a Friday night.The entrance is very grand with a bar but it did have a slightly stiff/stuffy air about it. Everyone was very formal and professional and as soon as I spotted Daniel Bouloud himself sitting in the bar with a restaurant critic I guessed this was probably the reason everyone was standing to attention !!We were seated promptly on the edge of a large room that was beautifully decorated and with plenty of space between the tables to give a lot more privacy than we have experienced in other NYC restaurants. I even had a small stool especially for my handbag. Our waiter came and introduced himself to us and efficiently explained the menu options and the daily specials. We opted for some classics, duck terrine and langoustine to start followed by  duo of beef. Rather disappointingly the bread selection was miserable. It looked good and sounded interesting but inside it was chewy and lacked any of the flavour that it was described as having. I really don't know why restaurants in the USA appear to have so much difficulty with bread. It doesn't really matter what type of bread I order it somehow always tastes like a cross between sourdough and ciabatta. Everything else was excellent - just as I expected it to be. And also especially as Daniel himself was there to keep an eye on things. We were treated to a tasty amuse bouche, chef's appetisers and even an extra dessert to share. this was all then topped of by some wonderful freshly baked orange madeleines.We had a very nice conversation with the Mâitre d who then arranged for us to have a small tour of the kitchen which was great fun. Seeing how organised and smooth running everything was behind the scenes is always something I'm interested in. It was a great evening and a fabulous foodie experience to visit Daniel but I'm not sure I'll be rushing to come back. Maybe it is just a bit too 'formal'... I'm not sure.

The Chilean Sea Bass is the best money can buy exquisitely prepared to absolute perfection that I had no idea I was eating bass and have since scorned all other bass from anywhere else. A sampling of the truffle brought to the table to inhale the aroma and then ever so lightly grated onto a risotto I thought I received none. My mistake partially as the risotto should not have been paired with the truffle dusting. Meal portions are small but the chocolate assortments are seemingly endless and I wished it to be the opposite.

When October rolled around, Daniel was downgraded to a 2 Michelin, but we were still excited to go. While I can't speak for what Daniel was like when it was a full 3 star experience, I can compare it to my experiences at Jean-Georges and Le Bernadin, both 3 Michelin stars in New York, and both my favorite two dining experiences ever. Both also a bit less expensive than Daniel, too. While service and ambiance and fancy pants attire are all top notch at Daniel, I live to eat, and I wanted to love my food here. I'm in love with all sorts of celebrity chefs,  and I think Chef Daniel Boulud is a sexy, charismatic man, but I was disappointed by the food. I was not in love with anything. The food and wine were good, but my mind wasn't blown anyway like it was at Le Bernadin and Jean-Georges. Even my desserts were sad and boring.

I got a kick out of seeing plates served to each guest at the same time in perfect harmony. We did a full tasting menu with wine pairings. The food was excellent. But I did have much better at other Michelin restaurants. To my surprise our most favorite  and memorable course was cheese plate. The cheese was the best we ever had and wanted to lick the plate.

5.0,9/11/2014,Daniel is by far the best restaurant I've been to yet. The service was just so terrific! I love everything about them and the place is just so beautiful. During the pre-course there was something raw and I told them I don't eat anything that was raw and guess what no questions was asked they changed it right away. They bring the dishes to my friend and I at the same time to be exact the same moment. I LOVE their dessert it's just so good and you will remember the taste forever! I had a fantastic time.

5.0,9/10/2014,"Every year, my husband and I will make reservations at Michelin-starred restaurants to celebrate our birthdays. When a meal costs nearly as much as the down payment for a NYC apartment, I don't just expect good food, I expect a memorable gastronomic experience. The atmosphere at Daniel is classy and sophisticated. After a drink at the bar, we were escorted to a private corner table for our romantic meal. In terms of the food, the taste and presentation were both top notch. We both had the seven-course tasting meal and I enjoyed every single dish. The service was impeccable and we really bonded with our server. He was originally from France and before we left for the evening, he gave us restaurant recommendations for Paris (since we had a trip planned). They didn't forget my husband's birthday and gave us some extra desserts at the end of the meal. If your schedule allows, I recommend making a slightly later reservation so it's less crowded. Overall, Daniel did not disappoint and I plan to return again in the future!",2,2,1,Annie C.,"Manhattan, NY",144,23,0

It was perfect.  Refreshing and not too sweet, served with an aromatic sprig of lavender. Also it came with one really big ice cube, so I was able to take my time and my drink not get watered down (yayy surface area!)Got the 3 course tasting menu and added the swordfish. (An entree alone is $79, and the 3 courses is $125, which  is somewhat of a disparity imho)Long Island Fluke. Fresh,  clean delicious.  Mint and fresh celery relative, the wine pairings for this course and all the courses were fantastic.Swordfish served with peppers and olives wrapped in a mild chorizo, served with a polenta with a tangy hollandaise sauce.  Served with a pinot noir, it was awesome.Colorado lamb, excellently prepared with an au jus that was flavorful without solely relying on salt for flavor. Served with artichokes,  spinach and beans, which were probably the downside of the entire meal. They weren't bad just not worth eating almost after everything else we ate.Atome rouge (had to order the atomic themed dessert,  I am a chemistry teacher after all). Little chocolate balls stuffed with deliciousness. Served with a dessert wine that gave all the feeling of a port without the syrupy feel of a port. Is the food good? Yes.

2.0,9/1/2014,"So I really don't want to be ""That Guy"" to join YELP just to trash a place.  ""That Guy"" usually showed up and was an absolute slob and became indignant when the staff didn't respond to his boorishness by kissing his feet.  I hate ""That Guy"".  But I am very sorry to say that Daniel has lost its touch.I say ""sorry"" because Daniel was home to, perhaps, the best meal of my life.  February 1st, 2010, my wife and I ate in the skybox above the kitchen and were awed by quality of, well... everything.  Especially the food.  The flavors were bold, daring, perfectly balanced.  Every bite deserved to be savored.  It was one of the most special nights of my life.  The service was perfect.  The wine was wonderfully paired.  They deserved a Yelp review that night.We went back a year or two later and had a very good meal with my brother and his wife.  Not transcendent, but very very good.  Definitely worthy of four stars in the Times and five stars here (sorry again Daniel).  When Pete Wells deaccessioned one of their perma-stars a few months ago, my wife and I rolled our eyes.  Nothing is more annoying than when a reviewer fancies himself as some sort of iconoclast.  We just didn't believe him.Then three weeks ago, my wife took me on my birthday.  The food on the tasting menu was just plain boring.  The quality of ingredients was often lacking.  The seasoning was clumsy.  The acid never quite right.  I had a course of Wagyu beef that was laughably mediocre.  How can the beef at Daniel be somewhat chewy when two nights later I had Wagyu that melted in my mouth at Brooklyn Fare.  Even the seared Wagyu appetizer at Ipuddo put Daniel to shame.  The wine was very good, but a very poor value considering I ordered the premium pairing ($250 after tip).  This was simply way too much considering I was getting 75ml glasses of bottles that mostly retail at $25 and $30. The service was generally excellent, although they did bring my vegetarian wife an amuse bouche with meat, and they changed her first course without telling her (she ended up enjoying the unexpected dish).In the last three-to-four months, I have visited Jean George twice, Bernardin, and Brooklyn Fare; and this was far and away the least enjoyable experience of those Michelin three-star meals. I would also rank recent experiences at Gramercy Tavern, Annisa, Locanda Verde, Marco's above Daniel as well.  Yet Daniel was very easily the most expensive meal of all of them.  Fortunately, this meal didn't break our bank, but I want to put a warning out to those who are looking for an extraordinarily special meal for a very special occasion.  Go elsewhere.",0,0,0,Paul C.,"Dobbs Ferry, NY",0,2,0

When you come here and you pay that much money for dinner, the service better be amazing! We asked her what she would recommend and her response was ""well everything here is great."" In this tone that was so ridiculous rude. It was the best way to NOT answer the question. Of course everything is supposed to be great! But help us out here! As I roll my eyes- I digress from that situation. Since there are many people waiting in you at once, there is no designated server. The other younger guy that was also waiting on us was awesome! He should get a star on his own. Very attentive, nice and conversational. Ambiance is nice, classy and not overly stuffy. A lot of older people... But Of course probably due to the price point. There was nothing memorable about this dinner. I would have been happier somewhere else.

5.0,8/20/2014,"Chef Boulud is, most assuredly, utilizing ancient alien technology in that kitchen of his. There is no other explanation for this extraterrestrial experience. My party of 6 chose the tasting menu and it was the best decision I have ever made in my life after deciding to burn my Menudo albums one rainy, autumn day.The atmosphere is ultra contemporary and posh. Clean lines, great fragrance and the service was exquisite. The waitress was our soulmate and we all knew it. The Guinea Hen Terrine next to the Peekyote Crab Cannelloni was like bathing amongst cherubs covered in butter. Nude bathing with absolutely zero shame. I went with the chorizo wrapped swordfish and this dish needs to be recorded in the history books. It melted and break danced at the same time in my mouth like the kids in parachute pants were trying to save Miracles from the rich man fighting to tear it down. Toss me your Aqua Net??And when Ghaya brings out the Velours d'Abricot the skies opened up to a chorus of Bat Out Of Hell, all triumphant and such. It was an experience that I will never forget. There were other tastings in between but these stood out. My assistant had the Roasted Colorado Lamb Rack and I almost hit her in the head with a plate in efforts to steal it from her. I would have. She weighs 110 pounds so I felt as if I could take her down. This place has over 2000 wines so forget about picking one yourself. We asked the staff to just bring us what would be best based on what we were eating and, boy did they nail it. We guzzled, yes guzzled, reds from the Rhone Valley until it was time to start texting ex-girlfriends. At least I think that was where the wine came from. The bill?  Well, lets just say we could have skipped dinner and purchased a slightly used VW Jetta, painted it pink and took it off road until it died on us. Which would have been close to as much fun but not so much. Especially when our attorney could not eat another bite and we snagged his Atome Rouge. WOW. I have never proposed to a dessert before. It said no but that is besides the point.All and all probably one of the more premiere dining experiences of my life. I have eaten with kings and hobos and everywhere betwixt and between.

Honestly, out of the 5 non-cheese or desert courses, only one I would order again. I will say the optional foie gras dish was amazing, but I should not have to add a dish to a chefs tasting menu to find a memorable dish. Even as good as it was, the foie gras and eel appetizer at Morimotos is better. The service and wine pairings were impeccable, make no mistake.

5.0,8/10/2014,"Daniel served me one of the best meals of my life. As many other reviewers noted, this is not merely a restaurant, but a true dining experience. And for the price tag, you should expect nothing else. For starters, I love that they offer a 3 course prix fixe. It's just the right amount of food and you can leave feeling satisfied rather than over stuffed. Additionally, the wine service is the best I have experienced and I am tough on wine service. As one would hope  their sommeliers know their stuff, however; they are also very friendly and approachable and not at all condescending or stuffy.  For my 3 course meal, I had the warm seafood salad, the Black Sea bass with cipollini onions and the fraises des boits.  The sea bass was perfectly cooked and the seafood salad was light, but bursting with flavors thanks to the rosemary and the zucchini. And the fraises was a refreshing, sweet way to end the meal. Went perfectly with my last few sips of rose.All in all, Daniel deserves to be ranked among the top restaurants in New York.

4.0,8/6/2014,"***Daniel's service is excellent and there are great things about their food (the creamy center of their Wagyu beef, the nearly perfect spring dish of Arctic char with asparagus and morels, and a fragrant and creamy rose water cremeux tart, which is the perfect last bite), but too much of the menu is just in the good range for a restaurant with Daniel's high prices***Daniel is one of New York's most prestigious restaurants.  It has a long history in NY so it is no surprise that the menu feels dated.  Daniel is the kind of rich, indulgent and luxurious French restaurant that epitomizes an extravagant fine dining restaurant for many.  U.S. fine dining though has become much more progressive with many restaurants reinventing fine dining with contemporary updates on classic dishes as well as whimsical and playful takes on familiar favorites to deliver a truly memorable dining experience.I am typically not a fan of expensive and traditional French restaurants like Daniel.  I definitely found parts of Guy Savoy, Joel Robuchon, La Folie, Gary Danko, and Everest satisfying and even delicious, but I just feel that there are so many contemporary restaurants in the same price range (like Saison and The French Laundry) that integrate French recipes and cooking techniques into much more modern and creative plates of food.  Daniel feels much more like Everest than French Laundry though there were high points.There were parts of the menu where the quality of the ingredients and the cooking of them really shined.  Abalone was slow butter poached to create an unbelievably soft texture.  Abalone is so often chewy and rubbery even when properly cooked.American Wagyu / Kobe beef tends to lack the richness and marbling of true Japanese Wagyu and Kobe beef, but Daniel's Wagyu beef rib eye was the exception.  Utilizing beef from Emma Farms in Colorado, the beef had an incredibly rich and creamy texture to contrast a distinct bark-like exterior (a tad over salted).  Their Arctic char was really nicely done.  The fish was moist and flaky while the garnishes were a celebration of spring.  Asparagus was served via shaved ribbons as well as a creamy flan and morels (so often salty) were perfectly seasoned and buttery.  The chicken jus (another item that often ends up too salty) was rich but thin and well balanced.Their cheeses were excellent and delivered complex flavors.  Some of the cheeses were smoky and peppery and even their firm cheeses had a pleasing creaminess to them.Unfortunately, the rest of the menu was in the good but not amazing category, which I think would be perfectly fine if Daniel was not charging prices where most people would expect amazing food.  The scallop with caviar was okay, but the stinging nettle purée did not explode with spring freshness like that same garnish does at Manresa. The yuku cured fluke was moist and soft and the citrus and ginger both popped; however, there was nothing to elevate this sashimi course above other restaurants charging much lower prices.  Other restaurants are taking this course to another level like Twist utilizing horseradish ice cream for a fun take on a savory course or Melisse's use of fragrant cilantro blossoms to re-introduce cilantro's flavor and intensity in an exciting way.Daniel's seared foie gras showcased great cherries, which were a perfect accompaniment for the foie gras.  Unfortunately, the foie gras was a little stringy and not as smooth as I would have liked.  Some restaurants really do a good job of creating a thick and crispy sear to contrast a smooth and creamy center (like Chicago's Senza) and Daniel did not quite pull that off.Dessert was also a letdown.  It was chocolate mousse with praline and Meyer lemon, but it was too small and too simple for French cuisine, which is known for decadent desserts.  There were many other mini courses (amuses, breads and mignardises) to make the meal more elaborate.  There were some highlights like a great Parmesan and garlic roll, which had a chewy crust to go with a salty, cheesy flavor.Service was exceptional.  The restaurant knows that it is a special occasion for most guests and they really go out of their way to make the evening as memorable as possible.As mentioned, prices are very high (especially for the tasting menu).  A lot of guests opt for the more reasonably priced and customizable 3-course menu.Overall, I enjoyed Daniel more than La Folie, Gary Danko and Everest.  I would probably give Robuchon the edge though; Robuchon's food feels more vibrant and their bread trolley and mignardises cart truly deliver that over the top experience many come to expect with restaurants in Daniel's price range.  Daniel might be appealing to people who love French cuisine, but if you desire more creative upscale cuisine, other NY restaurants like wd~50, Atera, and Eleven Madison Park deliver a far superior experience.I am not sure what the parking situation is.",27,12,13,Anthony N.,"Playa del Rey, CA",4935,2741,19422

Complimentary trio of broccoli. Only memorable one was the smoked salmon w broc. Appetizer was the lime cured tuna. Was amazing. Portion size was bigger than I expected actually. My friend had the crawfish which I tried- very very tasty. Main course was the squab. Cooked perfectly but didn't think the potato that came with it complemented it well. Was a bit too heavy. Sauces were great though. Got the mango lassi cake dessert with sorbet. The crust of the cake was delicious and crunchy. The sorbet was MY favorite part of the course.

5.0,7/16/2014,One of NYC's best restaurants hands down. Many times in life we pay a lot of money for a meal and feel that it just wasn't worth it. A meal at Daniel is priceless. The food is so sublime it will make your eyes roll to the back of your head. Service is amazing and the room is so beautiful.

5.0,7/15/2014,"What a pleasure and privilege to dine here while visiting New York this summer! It was surprisingly easy to book a reservation via OpenTable just one week ahead, though this was for 9:15pm on a Monday which might explain that.My date and I couldn't have been happier with where we were seated, in the alcove on the right side of the room. It was more dimly-lit, intimate, and romantic than the rest of the dining room, and it was a great spot to people watch. The decor, of course, is impeccable. Columns, art, the double circle theme that graces many details, and the orange orchids paired with white accents on the tables. I might have to steal this theme for my wedding!Something else that surprised us was the warmth of the staff. They were friendly, conversational, and entirely not uptight while maintaining high professionalism. Going into my first 3 Michelin star restaurant, I was prepared for something more stuffy. Not so at Daniel. Of course, you still want to draw upon your best table etiquette. But as long as you're dressed the part, don't sweat it too much.And finally, the food. We ordered from the 3-course pre fixe menu plus an additional appetizer. The marinated sea scallops were to die for. My partner enjoyed the chilled peekytoe crab cannelloni, which were wrapped in thin layers of melon and very refreshing. We shared the fagottini (which sounds awful, but is really just a bundle-shaped pasta dumpling) with sweet corn, lamb's quarters (which is actually a green of some sort, not lamb), lobster tail, and chorizo. It too was delightful.I initially asked for the black sea bass with syrah sauce for my main course, one of the restaurant's signature dishes. Sadly, the waiter came back after ordering and told me they had sold out of it. So instead I had the grilled Maine halibut, which was fine, but probably my least favorite part of the meal. My date had the duo of beef, and he enjoyed the short rib mousse half more. He said the wagyu was ok.The desserts, on the other hand, blew us away. I had the Nepali mango, which came with mango lassi sorbet and other delicious bites. The standout was my partner's Borneo vacherin: lime-avocado sorbet, coconut chantilly, spiced meringue, and green apple-absinthe coulis. I clearly could not have told you that without copying it from the online menu. But it was AMAZING. Our waiter also threw in a third chocolate dessert on the house, for not being able to give me my first choice main course. Plus extraordinary petit fours, house-made chocolates, and warm madeleines (which they packed for us to go, since we were stuffed by the end of dinner... they even threw in some extra). One of our waiters walked us out at the end of the night, offering to help us hail a cab since it was raining slightly.A once in a lifetime experience.

5.0,7/7/2014,"As a foodie who has basically sold an arm and a leg to eat at almost every Michelin-starred restaurant in Manhattan, I am rarely impressed by any restaurant these days. However, Daniel always has a way of pleasantly surprising me. The quality of service and food is immaculate. I've had my best bottles of wine there. Daniel keeps on file what wines you have ordered as well which came in handy when I was craving a glass of the red wine I had over a year ago. Some food highlights are: duo of beef, the abalone appetizer, and the ravioli lobster appetizer. They also have great truffle specials at times that are divine. It's definitely pricey but definitely worth it for a special occasion. Sometimes the atmosphere is a little stuffy as men are required to keep their jackets on. It's still one of my top three restaurants in NYC and definitely my number one when it comes to meat; as such, I highly recommend this restaurant.",3,0,1,Stephanie S.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",0,13,0
5.0,7/4/2014,"The many reviews document the culinary at Daniel.  I won't repeat the details but offer the perspective of my wife's and my experience eating in the Lounge on a Tuesday night.First, I made the reservation using Open Table one month out.  8:30 pm and the lounge were the only options.  I was surprised to see the main dining room with few tables taken and only about half in the lounge.  I wonder if calling direct is better?We were very impressed throughout the evening by the quality of service.  At one point two waiters removed our plates and silverware working in tandem careful not to reach in front of either of us... Almost a ballet.  The main waiter was very knowledgeable about all the dishes, provided excellent suggestions, and offered wine by the glass ideas to pair with our main course.  I was most impressed that as we finished our appetizers, he noticed we had nearly finished our Veitliner wine by the glass and generously provided a bit more for the final bites.   My wife had the foie gras and I had the abalone... Both were incredibly good.  The abalone included pickled chayote, very unique.  There were 2 amuse bouche offerings, one being 3 variations in cauliflower, and bread before the appetizer.For the main course my wife had the Dover sole and the waiter appropriately suggested a white Rhone.  I had the sucking pig with a Beaujolais that I preferred over the suggested Chateauneuf de Pape.  Each dish included several inventive vegetable accompaniments.  For dessert, my wife had the floating island and I had the incredible marzipan/chocolate.  And the desserts kept with an amuse bouche of 3 tastings, the most memorable a stuffed cumquat.  Then the Madeline's then a morsel of truffle chocolate.  There was a long delay between the time we finished our main course and the appetizer.  The waiter apologized and I noticed the supplement for the foie gras was not added to the final bill...  A subtle and appropriate accommodation.I wish I could eat my way through the entire menu at Daniel, but I am immensely pleased to have had the fine dining experience at least once.",0,0,0,Ed D.,"Columbia, SC",6,49,1
3.0,7/4/2014,"2014 Michelin 3 starsIt was our going away party since we were moving away from NYC, so what better way to go out then a 3 star Michelin restaurant.  We had a party of 6, so opted to go for the Lounge seating which actually does NOT require a jacket to dine at.  They seated us promptly, and the service was good.  We all opted for the tasting menu (non seafood oriented).  And this particular tasting menu still had ample seafood.out of the 7 or so courses  throughout the entire tasting menu, the dinner lasted 4.5 hours!   Now I am no stranger to the 4-5 hour fancy meal, but those usually have 18+ courses.  Each course had about a 30 min intermission, and due to the portion sizes it took about 5 min to consume each course.  By the end of the night me and my buddies were seriously considering foregoing dessert and the last main so we could get home at a reasonable hour.  The kitchen needs to seriously reconsider their timing of their dishes.  As for the food itself out of the 7 courses, 2-3 were good, the reset were OK, none were amazing/spectacular.  The best parts of the meal was actually the drinks.  The cocktails were all good, and the sommelier picked us some amazing wines.  We opted to just share a couple of bottles instead of the wine pairings.Prices: $220 for tasting menu per person.  Cocktails range from 16-20ish Overall this place is probably my 2nd to least favorite 3 star Michelin restaurant Ive been to.

Maybe, I don't have the best dish in my life here or I don't have every dish that makes me wow and wow again here, but to me this is exactly my feeling of fine dining.

4.0,6/19/2014,"So if the decision to dine requires a high rating of Michelin stars of the chef, then it probably doesn't get any better than Daniel.I am not a food connoisseur so this was a special occasion on my brother's birthday.Every single staff member from the moment we entered was attentive and professional.  We were 15 minutes early and they seated us anyway.I personally don't find the decor especially memorable; it was quite dark and the A/C was a tad low to my liking.  But then again, we're not at an museum and we're there for the food.We each ordered the tasting menu and our staff member recommended that they will split each tasting for the both of us so we can both taste both menus.  Great suggestion.  We thought the tasting menu may not be sufficient for our appetite so we both ordered an additional appetizer and main entree.  Apparently that prompted the staff member to reiterate the amount of the food we would receive and the price.  My brother was a bit offended by that, but I wasn't.  Normally if someone is truly trying to belittle me, I can tell.  Our wait staff was genuine, so I took it as a pure information only reminder.So with the seven course sampling menu, plus an appetizer and entree, our meal was nine courses.  If you count the cheese plate and the desert, our meal was eleven courses.  We were there from 6:20 pm until close to 10 pm.What can I say about the food; as much as I like to reiterate that I am not a food connoisseur and this was truly a special occasion only, one can't help but to get used to this type of a setting.  Each course had a presentation that obviously took a lot of time and care, and each bite was a fantastic discovery.  Each course served with the same care from start to finish.  The attention paid to each minute detail was something quite admirable.Did not quite agree with the rabbit but that was just me; my brother thought it was fantastic.Stand-outs were the halibut and abalone for me, was quite pleasantly surprised with the portion for the halibut as it could have been an entree.  Thought the veal didn't quite have enough flavor, but my brother (who is a food connoisseur) assured me that they were done just right.We both also thought our prawn appetizer was extraordinary.Our wait staff was accurate in that the tasting menu was quite sufficient, so by the time our additional entree was served, I was already quite full and needed coffee right away.We didn't have any wine, just a glass of champagne for the occasion.  Again, just me, for some reason wine doesn't bring out the flavors in food for me, it actually ruins them.  So for this I definitely wanted to taste the food.The staff made a special ""Happy Birthday"" dessert plate which I thought was quite classy, and a card with the same message and the items we ate as a memento.The price was as expected; it wasn't as if we didn't know what we were getting into going in.  This wasn't something we do on a frequent basis, but for a special occasion, it was certainly memorable.  I don't know how else I can accurately describe our experience except that this for me, was definitively, what a ""dining experience"" should be about.  I look forward to our next visit.",2,0,0,David C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,12,8
5.0,6/18/2014,"I had the most Daniel experience. I got to spend some time at the Chef, Daniel's office, back in the kitchen. And apparently he has a secret ""chef's table of four"" there for celebrities and VVIPs. Some people may think Daniel is a bit stiff in terms of fine dining. It is not the most modern decorated restaurant in the city. This UES restaurant may be conservative in interior decor but everything in the restaurant shows off the smell of old money. The waiters are definitely top-notch, friendly and attentive, and they go out of their way to offer you help. My friend and I stayed there really late till past midnight and nobody in the restaurant rushed us. They still brought us just out of oven mini madeleines and offered us a tour to the kitchen and Daniel's office. It was really late but the patience and the hospitality they showed us stated their top-notch training and their passion. Let's put it this way, if you were going there alone without a date at all, you would still be surrounded by a group of gentlemen to guarantee you a good dining experience. At the end of the dinner, we had the menu back.

3.0,6/16/2014,"I always have conflicted feelings about fine dining. On one hand, my wife and I enjoy great food, whether it's ""fine"" or ""regular"". On the other hand, we dread the stuffiness and over-seriousness atmosphere of these establishments even though we enjoy good service.Daniel is such a place. The food is good, but the overall experience felt stuffy. And it's not good stuffy either. I understand that we are in one of NY's nicest restaurants, located in the Upper East Side...but the staff seems to take themselves way too seriously but lacks some of the more refined service levels found in other fine dining restaurants. Perhaps the most uncomfortable experience was how unflexible the Chef seems. My wife and I dined with 2 other couples and we were told that the Chef prefers to have the whole table order the same pre fixe menu. There are three pre fixe menus to choose from (1) 3-course menu, (2) 7-course Bellecour - meat focused and (3) 7-course Mayfair - seafood focused. We took that to mean the Chefs prefers the whole table get the same # of courses for timing purposes. No....they meant the Chef prefers everyone to get the same menu. When we inquired if the Chef could allow each couple order a Bellecour and a Mayfair, our server just went into robot-in-disguise mode and twice repeated the pre-programmed response: ""The Chef would prefers the whole table order the same menu."" Now, if the kitchen staff is really that good, they can handle a table ordering two different menus. When we protested, the Chef granted us this exception. Thanks... (and for the record, the Bellecour is nothing to write home about...)Don't get me wrong, the food was good and the service was good, despite being a tiny bit pretentious. For the money, we've had better food and service. Namely Alinea and various other fine dining restaurants in Chicago.

The main dining room is large with very high ceilings and the lighting is dim. Overall an elegant and calm feeling to the place. The food and service were impeccable. Something cool about Daniel that I haven't seen at other top restaurants was the tableside food prep. The table next to us ordered pressed duck and a crew of about 5 staffers rolled out the operation onto the dining room floor. One of the patrons gleefully operated the press, which seemed to have made his night. At the end of the evening our waiter walked us out of the restaurant and ran down the street to hail us a cab.

There were really no flaws in food and execution, but on a relative basis compared to other restaurants at this level, a couple things annoyed me: if I have a reservation at X time, please don't seat me 15 minutes later (but oh, they do have a world-famous bar but that's besides the point) and second, the service while overwhelmingly nice at times, was very slow towards the end of the meal.

The $125 prefixe is a fine way to go. I recommend start with the abalone appetizer but not the scallops. The garlic bread rolls are a hit. For main: the Black Sea bass is very good but isn't as creative as the beef duo which has a carrot foam beef rib and filet with amazing seasoning - what makes this dish stand out is when a bite encompasses all ingredients on the plate. The complementary warm Madeline cookies are wonderful. For dessert I had a merengue  sorbet which was very good but I might try a different item next time .

3.0,5/6/2014,"So, my first experience of a three Michelin starred restaurant.My fiancée and i had been looking for a place to celebrate our two year anniversary together while we were away in New York and this place had come very highly recommended. Booking isn't easy at Daniel. Our anniversary was on a Monday this year, and yet Daniel was still fully booked two months in advance. Was only when I checked a week before that I saw that a solitary time slot had come up. 21:45? Guess we are eating late, then! Booking made, with a little cheeky note saying we'd like to eat earlier if possible, and off to NY we go!So, the experience...The cocktails we had before dinner, in the bar, were unbelievably good. I had a Woodford reserve based cocktail which I practically licked the inside of the glass when I finished it.After these, we were seated in the restaurant and congratulated by the maître de on our anniversary! This threw us a little, as I think we had actually forgot ourselves. We never did find out how they knew, as we're pretty sure it isn't on social media, but bravo. A wine list was promptly placed in front of myself that looked like a copy of War and Peace. A quick gander at this confirmed my initial analysis that I was well out of my depth, so the option of having wines paired with the meal was (probably, too quickly) agreed by myself.We went for the 7 course tasting menu. Both the Le Menu Mayfair, but Jess had the vegetarian option. Here is where I have been struggling to try and give the restaurant more stars. The food was good. The wine was good. The service was out of this world. It's just that at no point in the meal did I want to jump out my seat and tell all my friends how epic the food was. It was just... Good. Don't get me wrong, it was better than almost every restaurant I have ever been to, but maybe my standards were set too high when the term ""Three Michelin Star"" was used. I was expecting more.

4.0,4/26/2014,"I think this 3 Michelin Star restaurant I need to revisit to see if I visited on a less than great night. Although I'm a believer that if your restaurant is open, even if we are the last reservation of the night, you should still be able to serve as perfect of food as if it were the first reservation. I felt this way also at Le Bernadin - there just wasn't any WOW factor to either restaurant but I also had the last reservation of the night there too.You have a few options in menus to choose from, we opted for the chef's tasting which was good but nothing to be thrilled about. Because we had the last reservation, they actually already stopped serving their chef's tasting option at 10 PM so instead of serving their actual full menu, they made a few course changes but served the full set of courses. I should have opted for the smaller menu after they mentioned this but I figured that I'm already at Daniel, I should go for the chef's tasting...Definitely a proper stuffy vibe to the restaurant from the moment you walk in to the moment you leave. I have many foodie friends that consider both Daniel and Le Bernadin as the best 3 Michelin Stars in NYC - so my recommendation is that you do not take a 10:30 reservation (or whatever is the latest reservation that they have) unless you are just going to Daniel to order a la carte.",2,0,0,Shawn B.,"Singapore, Singapore",122,190,87

The in house version if the Manhattan was superb with silky smooth combinations and quite possibly the largest ice block I have seen. After chatting with our server he sent over a gentlemen that was from our home town in Perth Australia so that was a nice touch. The only slip up was the confusion over the white asparagus dish. On paper it looked like an extra $32 if you include it with your meal but in fact it is $82 which we didn't find out until we received the bill. I'm sorry but as good as it was $82 for 6 pieces of asparagus is absurd. The server amended the price to reflect $32 which was appreciated. To finish of the night we were asked on the way out if we required a cab and before we hit the street there was one waiting about 50m away, which we were escorted all the way too.Food 10/10 service 9/10 decor 8/10",1,1,1,John A.,"Brisbane, Australia",43,249,756
5.0,4/13/2014,"I can't believe all the times I've been to NYC and haven't been here yet. Finally came here for dinner last night.All I can say is excellent! From the moment you enter to the pure enjoyment of every bite of food eaten, every sip of wine and cocktails drank, everything was you can expect from a 3-star Michelin restaurant.  Even Chef Daniel Bouloud was there saying hello to diners in the beautiful dining room.We decided to do their 3 course menu ($125 per person) instead of the two different $220 7 course tasting menus. The 3 Course menu turned out to be like 8 courses! The gratis food included a canapé, amuse buche, petit fours, Madeline's, and chocolate!We had the foie gras appetizer ($13 supplement charge) and was divine. It was my gf first time eating it and she loved it. She had oysters, sea urchin, and caviar appetizer. Delicious! Kyoto bad their lobster ravioli was sold out. The bread basket came after the canapé and amuse buche. 5 different kinds of bread. The first pass the bread was not warm. The second time around it was warm. Yeah! The garlic and olive bread were the best of the bunch. We had the duo of beef and didn't disappoint. The black cod was tastier than the beef dish but both were very good. The desserts were a meal in itself. First came our desserts (warm chocolate coulant was by far the best in my opinion). After they brought the desserts , next came the petit fours, then Madeline cookies, then mini chocolates. I want to say thanks to the service we enjoyed. From their wine Sommelier to our waiter (sorry if I misspelled your name) Theobold, was just superb. Dinner took a little more than three hours and wish it didn't end.

5.0,4/11/2014,"What kind of introduction would do Daniel justice? The flagship restaurant of Chef Daniel Boulud recently reached its 20 year mark, a venerable accomplishment for any venue in New York City. Its three Michelin stars [1] and membership in the Relais & Châteaux association already speak volumes about the caliber of the restaurant, but of course, there is no substitute for a firsthand experience. Despite a recent NYT review in which the restaurant was knocked down from four to three stars on the basis of service, my friend and I were eager to make a visit. Once reservations were secured, the two of us arrived on a weekday evening, looking forward to what we hoped would be an unforgettable meal.The dining room at Daniel is almost everything you would imagine it to be. The multitude of arches and pillars draw clear inspiration from Greek architecture, while the circular chandeliers across the ceiling feature two layers of lights - a theme which can be found in the very logo printed on the menus, which our server, Javier, was delighted to point out to us. We were promptly seated near the perimeter of the dining area, given the requisite walk-through of the menu, and left to the task of deciding our dishes for the night. Thankfully for us (and our wallets), Daniel still offers a traditional three course prix-fixe menu, but also has a Chef's Tasting as well as a separate Vegetarian menu.After a delicate array of amuses and bread were brought to the table, we started off with our first courses. With some difficulty, I had decided on the Sunchoke Ravioli with Sautéed Black Trumpet. About half a dozen pieces circular ravioli were interspersed with the beautifully marbled lobster tail (butter poached, no less), a Swiss chard fricassée, and a vadouvan-coral sauce. Each bite of ravioli was unbelievably silky, bursting with nutty flavor, and elevated even further when accompanied by the juicy, tender spheres of lobster tail.It was when our second courses arrived that things started taking an unexpected turn. Several minutes into the dish, my friend gave me a puzzled look and said, ""Lori... I think the hamachi is overcooked."" She tried several times to call into doubt her conclusion, but it was when I finally took a forkful and deemed it cooked far past her requested medium-rare that we notified Javier. He was more than gracious about it, ensuring that the plate in question was whisked away, and adeptly took my (perfectly cooked) plate back as well - a thoughtful gesture which prevented an awkward dining situation. In mere minutes, two brand new plates were brought out and placed in front of us, which we started on after a quick check of the hamachi.I had asked for the Duo of Beef, a gorgeous plate that featured, on one side, braised Black Angus short ribs, and on the other, a seared Wagyu tenderloin. The short ribs were fall-off-the-fork tender, glazed in a rich red wine sauce, and complimented with caramelized endive, pioppini mushrooms, and a chestnut purée. The tenderloin, on the other hand, was cooked to a perfect medium-rare and simply paired with a bordelaise sauce and glazed parsley root. The seasoning and flavors were spot on, with each element highlighting the best of the protein. And for dessert: The Golden Quince. In its original state, the quince fruit is inedible, and quite a feat to peel. In this dessert, however, poaching it was able to bring out the sweet, almost floral, flavor. When placed atop a cassonade frangipane crust and intertwined between several spoonfuls of goat cheese mousse and a pink peppercorn-apple cider sorbet, it was transformed into a surprisingly light, perfectly sweetened dessert, especially with a dusting of pomegranate seeds as the final touch.It would have been a successful dinner at that, but just as we were about to leave the dining room, Javier asked us if we would like a tour of the kitchen. How could we say no? We were led into the middle of the hustle and bustle and introduced to no small number of people: General Manager Pierre Siue, Executive Chef Jean François Bruel (who humorously asked my friend if she was ""the hamachi girl""), and Pastry Chef Ghaya Oliveira (whose desserts made us swoon). Even for strangers looking in, there's a strong camaraderie between all the staff, which partially explains the seamless flow between both front and back of house.I have no authority to say whether or not the recent drop to 3 stars in the NYT (compliments of Pete Wells) is justified, but from the kind of service that the two of us received, I think it's worth a challenge. Was our meal at Daniel perfect? No - but, it's not in the lack of flaws, but in the recovery of missteps that the stars truly shine.--[1] Daniel was bumped down to two stars in the 2015 Michelin star list.",26,8,19,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827

5.0,4/7/2014,"I know.  This is crazy.  Why even bother writing a review of one the top restaurants, EVER.  But, I want to put in my two cents.  I have wanted to eat at Daniel for years.  It was one of my dream dinners to do the Daniel tasting menu someday and that day finally came when I took my husband to New York for his 50th birthday.  Obviously, a trip to New York is already a pricey gift so I made sure he knew that the night at Daniel was all about ME!  The husband was freaked out about eating a dinner that cost $220 each, but I told him that it was my dream and it was going to happen, so we found ourselves having the best meal of our lives (so far!)I was happy that we didn't have to wait too long to be seated as I'd heard that happens sometimes.  We were seated to the side of the main dining room and our servers were AMAZING.  I started my night with a Smoke and Mirrors cocktail from the spicy drinks and it was a delicious whiskey drink served in a silver julep cup.  LOVED.Our seven course meal truly ended up being more like 11 courses by the time we were finished and we loved every minute of it.  I won't go course by course, but my favorites were a starter of a trio of beet bites, this amazing fois gras (first time trying it) that was served with tropical flavors and pineapple... it was, well, WOW, and our favorite course of the night was a ceviche that I believe was snapper.  There were also many other dishes from sun-choke ravioli to a trio of veal offerings and multiple dessert courses, finished with freshly baked Madelines!  And, the bread!  There was a server who came around with a tray of many kinds of breads.  Oh yeah, I tried them ALL!  We had both sweet and salted butters to choose from for our breads.Besides the food, the service was outstanding.  I believe this was the best service I've ever had.  I know it's how they do things, to reset your table between each course, but we really loved the attention of cleaning our table between dishes and chatting with us about the different utensils provided.  I'd never even known about a SAUCE SPOON!  So much for thinking I know food, right?It was wonderful.  I would LOVE to do it again.  Some day, we will do another one of these because it was a fab experience and I'm really happy that I got to do this at Daniel, a restaurant I'd wanted to visit for so long.  It truly is a NYC landmark and worth every penny.",3,2,2,Jennifer S.,"Escondido, CA",476,955,920
5.0,4/2/2014,"What a delightful experience. My friends and I came for my birthday and I really couldn't have asked for a more perfect dining experience--the food was amazing, the wine selection was superb, the waiters were extremely attentive and great to chat with, and the experience was honestly just out of this world. Let's talk food and then service. We each out our own three-course prix fixe. I ordered the tai snapper ceviche, the Aleppo pine seed crusted artic char, and the orchidea vacherin and each was amazing. We started off with an amuse bouche that focused on the fava bean--fava bean with some sashimi, fava bean paste, and fava beans with clam--all a delicious way to start off our night. The ceviche was delicious and the mandarin was an excellent way to complement the flavor of the snapper. The arctic char was cooked perfectly--not too dry and not too wet either, just the perfect temperature that you would expect for a fish dish. Sometimes I think fish can get dry or the taste can become boring very quickly, but not this one. The pine needle tempura were a really nice, interesting touch that I had never tried before but went really well with the arctic char. The orchidea vacherin for dessert though, was the most beautiful dish. Although the other two dishes were certainly nice, the vacherin was what really blew my mind with regards to design. The taste was wonderful as well. The sommelier helped me pair this one with an Italian Moscato which was the most delicious moscato I have ever had. For my birthday dish, they gave an elegantly designed plate with sorbet, chocolate, and a delicious chocolate cake. At the end, we were also given a small basket of delicious warm madeleine cookies that we quickly devoured.The service--out of this world. My friends and I thought that it was like they were all working in clockwork. Everyone was extremely in sync which was rather impressive. Our waiter took great care of us and was honestly such a nice, funny guy to talk to. All in all, just such an exquisite experience. The three course is nice because it's also at such a reasonable price--only $125 before tip--definitely something relatively more affordable compared to other triple star restaurants. tldr; best dining experience in my life, and you absolutely must go at least once if you can",2,0,0,Jasmine X.,"San Francisco, CA",798,1110,1512
5.0,3/29/2014,"Obviously, as a three-star Michelin restaurant, Daniel has to be at a certain standard. My boyfriend took me here in late February for my birthday, and as two college students in our early 20s, we were at first a little intimidated by all the white-haired, UES types. But while we did feel a little bit out of place, a group strolled in after us in jeans and hoodies and, to my surprise, were still allowed in. The space was very interesting and it sort of felt like a courtyard, with a raised platform area surrounding a lower seating space in between. Both the food and the wine was fantastic, but what really stood out was the service. We were absolutely treated like royalty by everybody from the waiter, to the server, to the people running coat check and to the sommelier. The wine selection here is among the most extensive I have seen at a restaurant in New York. I really enjoyed my veal and abalone dishes, as well as the complimentary fresh bread that they routinely offered us. This is definitely on the less pricey end of 3-star Michelin restaurants in NYC, but the service is unlike any other restaurant I've ever been to.

4.0,3/17/2014,"Came here to celebrate a friend's birthday, since she'd been hoping to come here for a long time.First off, the ambiance of the place is incredible, and the service is beautifully professional. Coat check up front, three waiters showed our party to our seats, before giving us the menu. Someone came over to welcome us to the place and describe the menu offerings to us, and offered us an extensive wine list. I already had my mind set on the prix fixe wine pairings so I didn't order anything, but upon perusing the wine list I was well-impressed (this earns them a star!)I got the prix fixe with an oyster starter, rabbit entree and passion fruit ""islands"" dessert ($125). I also opted for the $65 wine pairing -- in hindsight, the $130 wine pairing may have been a better choice.The starter was arguably the best part of the meal, in part because I'm partial towards seafood, and in part because I loved the wine pairing. The oysters were presented on a plate with a citrus-y seasoning that was poured on, after the waiter had explained the dish and how it was made. Sea urchins and a generous helping of caviar accompanied it. The wine pairing was an Austrian white (Salomon Undhof) from 2012 -- hints of apple on the palate, which is what I like in a good white. Oysters tasted fresh, but I felt a bit of sand on them. Caviar and sea urchin were just amazing.They brought out a round of fresh-baked bread from their own bakery, presumably to cleanse our palettes before the main course. I had an olive bread of some sort, and though I normally don't like olives, it was pretty great. The next wine pairing was brought out before the main course, and they let me sample some before pouring a full glass. It was some Italian red, and though it wasn't bad, I wasn't a fan -- some combination of not liking Italian wine in general, and perhaps an under-aging of the wine (if I recall correctly it was a 2009 vintage). There was some harsh aftertaste that reminded me of the smell of acetone (which is definitely not a good quality). However, aside from that the wine was fine, it had a very sweet fruity taste, and it was a big glass (made me quite happy). The rabbit dish was interesting -- I'd never had rabbit before, so I can't really compare, but it was quite a good introduction to the meat. I just wish there was more of it, as my friends' arctic char and steak entrees both seemed much bigger. For dessert, we were given quite a few options, and I think I just ordered the wrong thing. The ""islands"" of passion fruit and syrup were really good but not stunning. However, the dessert wine I was offered was quite good - it was a Turkish sweet wine, with a very honey-like texture and taste. To top it off, since it was my friend's birthday, Daniel had requested her name when making the reservation so that they could prepare a special chocolate cake dessert for her. They wrote her name in chocolate drizzle on the plate which was a nice touch. Overall a great experience, great memories of the place. A little expensive, but you can't really ""ding"" a restaurant like this over cost. However, I'd probably spend the $200+ on sushi instead if It was my birthday and not my friend's :)",2,0,0,Richard Y.,"San Francisco, CA",188,86,19
5.0,3/17/2014,"This is a special place. There are many places like it however there is only one Daniel. Instead of going through everything we ate I'll attempt to describe what is it about that makes Daniel so different and why it sits as a testament to itself. This was not our first go round here. My wife wouldn't even think about eating foie gras. She tried it for the first time since my Brother in law ordered it. She loved it so much she asked for more. My parents who are both non raw fish eaters and wouldn't even think about going for Sushi both ate raw fish and couldn't believe what they just ate was raw fish. So much so they thought I was screwing with them so they asked the waiter what they ate again. He explained it was basically raw fish and they we're in shock. They described it as heaven melting in your mouth. The point is that you will try things here you would never do so anywhere else. Each bite is like an explosion of flavor that only gets better as your evening continues. That's the food. Top quality, prepared perfectly and with innovation. That is only part of the story here though. Many places do that. Here they prepare and present the dining experience as if it was done at home. Fancy sure but not snotty, snooty or pretentious. You could spend more at other places which I've been to however they do not compare to Daniel. I'll pass on the $200-400 chefs table/tasting menu at some other places and be very pleased paying the $125 for three courses. Portions are real size and you won't be looking for more food. At $125 it's a steal in comaparison and better.  Now what makes this place so different and miles ahead of any of the other top restaurants is the people working in the place. They are real, nice, helpful and will never look down their nose at ""stupid"" questions. They make you feel as if you came home. That takes effort and attention to detail. That is Daniel Boulud and how he wants his business's to run. It comes through from the moment you walk through the door.

3.0,3/6/2014,"Daniel is an excellent restaurant.  The food is delightful, the table service is exemplary.  So why only 3 stars?...read on...We had wanted to go to Daniel for quite a while, so my wife took me here as a special birthday treat in December.  One not-insignificant part of our experience has obviously stuck in my craw so badly that now, in March, I'm still bothered by it enough to decide it's time to share my thoughts with fellow Yelpers.We arrived a few minutes early, were greeted cheerily, and the hostess offered that we have a drink at the bar until our table was ready.  Learned a great bar trick while there (if you want one large spherical ice cube for your scotch on the rocks, freeze a small, tightly-knotted water balloon, then just scrape it off when frozen).You put on your big boy pants (and jacket) for a meal at Daniel, and the atmosphere befits the surroundings.  We were seated at a very nice table off to the right side of the restaurant, a table for 4 between two tables that I assume would accommodate 6-8.  My wife was particularly tickled that her purse was given its own stool to perch on.  We've been to many a fine restaurant over the years, that perk was new to us.  Our waiters and the staff couldn't have been nicer or more attentive.  The food was beautifully presented, meticulously prepared.  Every bite was delicious.  The party of 7 or 8 to our left was celebrating the holidays, or a birthday, or something else along with some school-aged kids, all appropriately decked out and well-behaved.  The party of 6 or 7 to our right didn't seem to be there for any particular event, just out for fancy dinner.  Except for one of them, a man in his middle to late 30's, who was obviously taking the occasion to lament a broken relationship.  We weren't trying to overhear the conversation at hand, it just simply couldn't be avoided.  Not by us, nor by any of the people at any of the surrounding tables.  Linguistically speaking, we gathered from what he was saying - increasingly loudly and incessantly - that the significant other in his life either had perturbed him deeply or was, in fact, a fornicating female dog.  Over and over and over again.  As the drinks and wine continued to flow, that dog was howled about louder, more angrily, and more aggressively.  The others at his table detached uncomfortably from conversation with him, leaving just one older gentleman at his side to try to take the edge off so that this scorned buffoon would make it through the meal without flipping over the table.  We are by no means prudes, but this man had no business being in this restaurant in this condition on this night for this meal.  He was flat out drunk and increasingly a menace.  More than once his outbursts caused many of us on our side of the restaurant to raise an eyebrow, turn our heads, and question whether he might jump out of his seat or throw something.This problem became so pervasive that when it came time for dessert, I asked if we could be seated elsewhere.  Dinner service was winding down, so there was no problem accommodating that request, and dessert was as beautiful and delicious as the rest of the meal.  Stuff happens, I realize that.  So why 3 stars for a restaurant that easily deserves at least 4 if not 5?  After we moved tables one of the hosts came to our table, rolled his eyes, and said to us ""I'm very sorry about that but there's nothing that can be done for these sorts of things.""  And that's what has bothered me for these past 3 months - there were a number of things that could have been done to manage the situation properly and to the benefit of all involved:  At some point during the ongoing discomfort, the host could have discretely spoken to the man, asking him to contain himself.  If there was any fear of escalating the problem with a direct confrontation, another, more stable person at the table could have been spoken to.  Additionally, although obviously drunk, this man continued to be served, and that should not have been allowed to happen.  Instead, management enabled one particularly unruly guest to blemish an otherwise very nice experience for not just us, but all those others within earshot.  I do expect more from a fine dining establishment where a customary tip amount is more than the actual cost of a full dinner in plenty of other very nice Manhattan restaurants.  And, finally, for all the obvious inconvenience and discomfort, just as a gracious gesture they might have considered comping my after dinner drink.All in all, my advice is to go.  Preferably as the guest of someone else.  Hopefully with some nice neighbors at each side of your table so you can give Daniel one extra star for each of them.  Unfortunately, in our case, Daniel let that be taken from us, but at least we've had an interesting story to tell our friends...",1,0,0,Michael V.,"New York, NY",0,23,0

My only *complain* is that we had no choice on the menu since it was Valentine's Weekend - it was a price fix menu (4 course tasting) which was what we had planned on doing but the price was substantially higher than what it normally is (normal 3 course is $125 - our 4 course was $300).,2,0,0,Michele G.,"Staten Island, NY",45,1,0
2.0,2/16/2014,"This place takes itself way too seriously. I dined here in January 2014 to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday. Like any time for celebration, you want to feel relaxed. It's hard to relax in a place that has so many rules. No pictures, gentlemen must wear jackets, etc. but ok I can get past that. We ordered the $125 per person 3-course tasting. I thought the food was very good, just not worth the price. It was good but at that price it should  be much better. Also, our waiter kept faking a French accent. He only spoke to us in this accent, which suddenly disappeared when he spoke to his coworkers. I would only go back if I won't the lottery and had money to burn.",2,0,0,James M.,"Roslyn, NY",3,61,6
5.0,2/16/2014,Great service! I have never seen anything like that before. They have more waiters than the patrons in that place but somehow they manage to stay out of your way without being annoying or intrusive. Top of the line service. The food is great too. You can't really go wrong with anything you order. I had the most amazing steak ever. The portions are small though and the whole experience is not cheap. A dinner for two with couple of wine glasses will cost you about $400. If you can afford it it's definitely worth it.,2,0,0,Edward V.,"Staten Island, NY",2,35,0

However the quality of the food and service is just as excellent as in the main room. The lounge is cozy and pretty. Table was too small for a party if four, especially considering all of the plates and cutlery needed for the cavalcade of amuse bouches. The food was excellent from start to finish, and they are extremely gracious in accommodating special dietary needs. Service is attentive , expert, formal and a tiny but fussy (in other words French). Astonishing wine list.

It's expensive but well worth it and it's an experience you must try. One thing that's good to know, you can get reservations in their lounge area (they call it the upper dining room) more easily. It's a little more casual but you have the same menu as the main dining room. This is an amazing restaurant. Highly recommend!! I will definitely be back!",3,0,2,Kay R.,"New York, NY",78,20,0

4.0,1/28/2014,"I was told about the establishment by a friend.  Daniel really is a good restaurant.  Actually, I will go as far as saying it is one of the top ones I have been  to in New York. When I entered the restaurant, it evoked a feeling of traditional with modern accents. A woman in black caught me off guard as she greeted me at the entrance and took my coat, followed by the friendly hostess, waiting eagerly to cross my name off the reservations list. We were brought into the main dining room, which had an airy feeling but with modern accents such as the added frosted glass panels along the ballestry. The waiter who served our table was very professional without being too stuffy presented us with our menus. Being a very authentic French restaurant, Daniel focuses on only the highest quality ingredients, creating dishes that are simple, yet uniqueWhat made the restaurant differ from a great restaurant, and such a highly acclaimed restaurant, was the way that it stuck to its philosophy and food integrity, constantly changing and creating new dishes, as well as the high level of service and freebies, making the restaurant seem less like a cost and more of an experience. It made me feel welcomed and not a place out to get your money with gimmicky overpriced foods and drinks And best yet, after the meal, the renowned chef Daniel Boulud surprisingly came to my table  and greeted me. In a world where celebrity chefs are constantly out to make money, opening up branches, and spending time on television, it is good to see that there are still honest chefs in the world and in New York City.I cant say enough about this place place.  Everything was fantastic.  The only reason ti did not get five stars is because I actually had to wait to be served even though I had a reservation.  I will certainly be coming back!",1,0,0,Juan M.,"Westport, CT",281,196,38

5.0,1/19/2014,Perfection. Everything is delicious and the service is excellent. I highly recommend the frog legs and duck with truffle. All the desserts are to die for although I can't remember what they were. As soon as I walked in they greeted me by name and the front desk along with the waiting staff all knew and wished me a happy birthday. Also they remembered we had tickets to a broadway show afterwards even though I only casually mentioned it when I made the reservation. It's those little details that make them stand out from the rest. The only negative thing was the drink I ordered was not good at all but they quickly switched it for another one.,2,1,1,Lizz F.,"Bellerose, Queens, NY",12,6,6

4.0,1/14/2014,"I wanted to give this restaurant a 5 stars but I subtracted a star because we were forced to check in our coats. Upon our arrival we were directed to our seats all the way in the back where we were seated near the cash register. I didn't like the fact that every waiter has to go pass us to get to the restaurant. We felt kind of secluded. Anyways once we sat down, the gentlemen requested us to check in our coats, when we told the lady in front we didn't want to, we want our coats by our side. We didn't want to create any scenes so we just check it in. Aside from that, I thought the service by the waiters were great. We did the 3 course menu because I know my tummy wouldn't be able to put 5 course in there. As follows appetizers: A MUST have is the MOSAÏC OF CAPON, FOIE GRAS. This is duck liver. It so good that it melts in your mouth after that single bite. It was so nice and soft, I wanted more. STEWED ALASKAN KING CRAB: this dish was okay, nothing special that stood out. This was kind of like lobster bisque. Entree: DUO OF BEEF: Short Ribs and Seared Wagyu Tenderloin: both meats were nice and tender cooked to perfection. OVEN BAKED BLACK SEA BASS: the bf usually doesn't eat fish, but he took a stab at this dish and he finish his plate. Fish was soft and tasty. Dessert: CHOCOLATE COULANT: Kind of like a brownie with chocolate drizzling out after splitting it in half with a folk. I like the fact that they give some little complimentary desserts/food every so often and extra plus that they bought out a little birthday surprise for me.",3,0,0,Carmen L.,"New York, NY",8,235,2458

5.0,1/10/2014,"The hamachi tasted - dare I say it - overcooked? No way, I must be mistaken. Let me try it again.Wiggling my knife to cut off another piece, I tried to suspend my disbelief. We ARE at Daniel, are we not? This can't be happening. But the hamachi looked completely white. It tasted tough, almost rubbery, and it was nearly impossible to chew. We called over our server Javier.""Did you say the hamachi was supposed to be cooked medium rare?"" we asked him. He agreed and concernedly asked if I wanted to send back my dish. Horrid images of ""Hell's Kitchen""-style yelling coupled with my best friend's stories about food being sent back in a JGV kitchen began racing through my mind.""No no no, it's okay,"" I replied. ""It's probably the lighting, and I'm nitpicking."" When my friend finally agreed to try a piece of the hamachi (fish isn't her first choice of meat), she turned and stared at me.""OMG, Jess, we have to send it back,"" she said. Moments after Javier left, he returned with news that they were bringing both of us new dishes. This time, the sticks of hamachi were seared to a gorgeous light pink color, and they eagerly fell apart as I sliced into it. Just as I hoped, the hamachi simply melted in my mouth. Ahh. My faith in humanity was restored and we now return to our regular programming... Javier's sincere apologies and continual graciousness throughout the night + the impeccable food + exquisite desserts + everyone dropping by our table to make sure we were okay were MORE than sufficient for us to overlook what happened. But the kitchen certainly did not. In addition to sending over complimentary dessert, they offered us a tour of their surprisingly small kitchen, and Daniel Boulud himself appeared (okay that wasn't for us haha)! We could barely contain our excitement. As we entered the kitchen, each and every employee greeted us warmly (Executive Chef Jean François Bruel asked if I was hamachi girl) and laughed at us oohing and ahhing at Bernard's introductions (& the Skybox!). We were at a complete loss for words when we met Pastry Chef Ghaya Oliveira (she is a genius) and took photos with Chef Bruel, Chef (de Cuisine) Eddy, Mr. Siue (GM), and Bernard himself. They were cracking jokes the entire time - what a talented group of people with a refreshingly silly sense of humor! Bernard let us take our time in taking in everything and walked us to the door with our parting gifts. Enamored? Yes, we most certainly were.Pete Wells, you're wrong about their service. If the staff at Daniel is willing to do SO much to make two common girls, who are at least half the age of 90% of the diners and not ""Very Important Persons"" in any way, feel like THE most treasured guests of the evening... perhaps you need to give them another chance to earn back that much-deserved fourth star.Notes:- They have a wonderfully priced three-course prix fixe menu for $125, but also two seven-course tasting menus for $220.- Two amuse-bouche rounds. The first was a trio of cauliflower dishes prepared in three ways and the second was gorgonzola cheese with something (I didn't eat this of course).- We ordered the lobster and oyster apps and beef duo and hamachi entrees - all amazing. But I was completely blown away by the desserts! (We got the golden quince and molasses poached pear.) After being disappointed by the desserts at Per Se and Eleven Madison Park, this was really really nice.- Their bread was heavenly and still warm. They had sourdough, multigrain, french baguette, olives, and parmesan (or some kind of cheese).- They had petit fours, madeleines (also warm! but DAB does it slightly better), and chocolates (irish cream, earl grey, yuzu, and smoked cinnamon).- Their logo of a small circle intersecting a larger circle is representative of ""the Circle of Life."" It's a consistent theme through the courses and room decor.- Javier is the sweetest and the best.",34,22,27,Jess C.,"New York, NY",591,305,582

5.0,1/8/2014,"There's not much I can say that others haven't already mentioned before. Daniel is a dining experience--- you go in knowing that. It's superb service, food and atmosphere. Definitely reserved for special occasions and make sure it's the star act of your night - meaning, do NOT plan for anything to occur after or before. They'll hold your reservation for 30 minutes past your start time, but be prepared for a solid 4 hour meal with many courses and much opportunity to chat with your fellow dining companions and bask in the opulence that surrounds you. Only real downside worth mentioning is that early in the evening, it's very quiet and somewhat awkward to hold initial conversation due to that oppressive silence. Our reservations were for 6 or 6:30 (I can't remember), but the place filled up and rose to a natural, comfortable volume level by around 7:30 or so. And then it was bopping ALL. NIGHT. LONG. We ended up actually staying there after and heading to the bar for last call - and really felt no need to go anywhere else, because it's just such a great place to be and you loathe ending the evening and becoming a plebeian again! But keep in mind, as nice as Daniel is, the atmosphere is very friendly and approachable. I've been twice and never felt like there was an attitude from the staff or fellow diners- which just really makes the whole experience that much more enjoyable. As for the food itself, oh gosh - what isn't amazing on this menu? So I've never done the tasting menu, but I do always get the 3-course price fixe. I also always get the foie gras for the first course, because it is melt-in-your-mouth delicious. So rich and decadent, but really worth the indulgence. For the main, I most recently got the sea bass, which they are famous for - and they are famous for it FOR A REASON, but have also tried the black cod, which was also delicious. For dessert, I have pretty much tried everything on the menu and a bad option does not exist. Keep in mind dessert also comes with petit fours and some amazing warm cookies. SO MUCH FOOD. Another highlight is the circling bread tray -- all the options are good options- and the butter they serve it with is real, creamy, delicious butter - usually they give you two options to choose from. Also highly recommend the cheese dessert option. It's worth the up-charge to get the cheese cart rolled over to you and the cheeses presented with such fanfare.And yes, it's expensive but wow- what a night that you get for the money. Top notch from start to finish - a unique meal flawlessly served and presented by about 10 people constantly circling your table and ensuring you're being taken care of.  If you are in the mood to splurge, then do it.

The food is nonmemorable at best.    I once had a whole salt baked fish at Daniel which was very tasty, but thats honestly the only dish I've remembered to date.  If you like seafood, bernardin or masa are better bets.  If you want general new american/ french, jean georges is much better.",2,0,2,Kevin G.,"Manhattan, NY",83,36,4

They were able to accommodate us and get our food out in time though they recommended only the 3 courses menu instead of more courses due to our time restraint. The complimentary bread they brought out were very good, especially the onion/garlic roll. We had the Duo of Beef and Seabass for entrees, and we were disappointed with both.  We also splurged on the truffle ravioli and thought it was a bit waste of money since the portion was super tiny, and the ravioli was mediocre. The dishes were just ok, nothing amazing.  If you want steak, I recommend Flemming's or Ruth Chris instead. The dessert was good, and the service was absolutely perfect, probably the best I have experienced. The waiters were courteous and professional without being haughty. They were also very coordinated, and two of them will come and serve/take your dishes at the same time. Overall, the food was ok, but the service is exceptional.

5.0,11/12/2013,"This is probably the best restaurant I've ever been to, and I've been to other 3 michelin star restaurants and contenders before.    I'll start with the food:Scallops were crusted, crispy but perfectly done.  They came with small squares of something on the side that had the texture and taste of taro, but was probably something I don't remember from the menu.The bread - particularly garlic parm, was amazing.  I could have eaten just bread for dinner and it still would have been a great meal... but of course we had more...The beet puree amuse bouche was fabulous.  The Hamachi pretty good, the shrimp was in between the two -- still top quality but not quite as good as the beet puree.The salmon appetizer was very good, but not quite up to the standard that the scallops set.  However, the smokey salty flavor of the cured salmon complemented well the fresher salmon, and the turnips were nice - restaurants don't serve enough turnips... On recollection the turnips may have come with the black cod, I'm not sure...The due of beef was amazing, but particularly the rib -- moist, tender, melts in your mouth, robust flavor.  The tenderloin was great as well, but we preferred the rib.The black cod was very good, but second to the beef....The dessert was great, and consisted of three courses... the chocolate cake was amazingly good, moist and molten.  The other memorable part of the desserts were the chocolates -- they were very good, but a little bitter for my taste, and I was so full I could barely eat them... but eat them I did!Their service is second to none... food was constant... they always waited till we finished both plates, and as soon as they were done the next course came out... bread, wine, and water were all replenished impeccably.The wine was a refreshing, slightly oaky aligote... A good complement to the seafood dishes.It was one of the most expensive dinners I've had, but it was well worth it.   I see why it was so hard to get reservations here!",4,1,0,G L.,"Manhattan, NY",55,33,0
4.0,11/10/2013,"I really wanted to give this 5 stars, but at the end of the day when you walk into here, you want the BEST MEAL OF YOUR LIFE. And I got an extremely good meal, with a lot of panache and showmanship, but not the BEST MEAL OF MY LIFE. Very classy joint, oozes old school NY charm and prestige. Dont forget a jacket if you're a dude. Without going into ridiculous detail for each meal and bite, which I'm sure changes quite regularly I will just say the food here is delectable and to die for. Outstanding bites were the pistachio scallops, the swordfish, the steak, the venison and yeah pretty much everything. I loved how they kept bringing us small bites throughout and EVERY SINGLE  dessert offering was more decadent than the last. The only small hiccup was one of the servers spilling my drink on my dessert and the table which another deftly cleaned up. It didn't bother me none but I'm sure at a place like this they really frown on that. A bit stuffy for my taste, hard to have a convo with a silent waiter lurking behind you waiting for your pause to get a word in. But their service is artistry, a delicate dance for the senses that makes you feel like royalty for the night. Again, a restaurant of the HIGHEST ORDER. But after all the hype maybe I expected something a little more? If you're in NYC I would recommend this 100%, I'm sure people come here just to eat here which I don't blame. But when I walked out I didn't feel like it was the best meal I've had. Probably not even top 5. But I'm young and maybe my palate hasn't matured enough for this type of food. I will say I left extremely full. EXTREMELY FULL. The service here was otherwise impeccable, probably the best I've ever had. However, to be honest for the price (and lets be honest, that is a factor for 99% of the people in this world) you can have 4 other incredible meals in this great city. That also cost it the final star. Can't charge for something another person is doing better with less presentation down a few avenues. Still, a place where art is rendered daily.",1,0,0,Saad M.,"Manhattan, NY",58,235,0
5.0,11/10/2013,"Definitely a special occasion restaurant.  Have been to many 'top' restaurants in the city and this definitely falls into that category (not too surprising given it is one of a few in the city with 3 Michelin stars).  Wouldn't call it my favorite (mostly because of personal preference on the menu choices compared to some of my favorites), but it was a memorable meal that will make it to my list of top meals.  The room is beautiful, I had been prior to the renovations and they did a great job of keeping the classic elements while introducing modern touches.  A very warm and inviting space.  You really feel transported out of the city from the moment you walk in.  Even the flowers are beautiful, though I wish they would spread them throughout the room more.  When we went last night they had an arrangement of maple leaves showing fall colors, very creative and attractive look.The service was excellent, as you would expect.  Never had to ask for anything or look for a waiter.  And as with most top restaurants, they made us feel like we belong there and it was all about us.  They knew the menu very well and were able to discuss the dishes with us in interesting ways.The food was also excellent.  I made a bad choice by choosing a salmon dish to start with, didn't realize it was more like a smoked salmon, which I am not a fan of.  Other than that the dishes were amazing.  The scallop starter was one of our favorites, and the encrusted cod was one of the best fish dishes we had (nicely presented and prepared for two).  I had the duo of beef which was also excellent.The desserts warrant their own mention.  I had the best 'molten' cake I every had.  It had a perfectly melted chocolate center, but what put it over the top was the mix of salted caramel.  Not too heavy and amazing mixture of flavors, wonderful!As I said great for a special occasion given the price, but worth the cost.  Just check out the menu and make sure it matches your taste, as it doesn't matter how good the food is prepared if it doesn't match up with what you like.",0,0,0,Peter L.,"Great Neck, NY",13,69,0

Throughout my entire meal, I felt like I had a personal attendant, not a waiter. Every need was predicted, service was flawlessly executed, recommendations were personalized and I never felt rushed or inconvenienced in any way. My pre-dinner cocktail was a savory artichoke-bourbon drink (with an artichoke IN THE ICE CUBE), and my appetizer was poached asparagus which was flown in from Provence 24 hours earlier. There wasn't a single mis-step the entire night.It didn't hurt that between my date and I, we were offered at least 12 or 13 different dessert tastings after our main course.

When I placed a call to the restaurant the next morning to express our discontent, I was reminded that I haven't dined there since 2008 (D'OH!

We went with the three course menu as we were a bit short on time as we had show tickets.  The two amuse that came out once we'd ordered were delicious. One was a beet medley and the other was an avocado foam. The bread was also fantastic, and my husband had probably four pieces throughout the night. I started with the shiimaji and he had the oysters. Both were great, but overall the oysters were probably our least favorite dish of the evening. For our entrees, he had the rabbit and I had the duo of beef. The beef was so tender and perfectly cooked. The rabbit was very interesting, and he really enjoyed  it.  Dessert seemed neverending, as the chef sent out a beautiful birthday fruit plate along with our two ordered desserts and the signature madeline basket.

Dimly lit but not in a romantic way, more in a..... ""grandpa needs to go to bed soon"" type of way. I guess that explains why this restaurant attracts the older/senior/bored couples crowd.Service - meets the bare minimum of what you would expect at a Michelin Star restaurant but DEFINITELY missing the passion or lively factor. Unlike many other well-respected establishments in NYC with servers who are not simply knowledgeable about the food they serve, but also passionate about the culinary culture in general, the servers at Daniel does not seem passionate about the restaurant or the food they serve. C'mon now, anyone could memorize the ingredients of a menu!Food - meets the bare minimum of a Michelin Star restaurant, which means, there's nothing wrong with the execution, the chef definitely knows the proper ways to cook his steak and foie gras, it would be sad if a chef of his reputation does not know how to work with flavors or  protein texture...but when I drop $1000 for a dinner for 2 (I picked the $220/pp 8-course chef's tasting menu + wine pairing which is supposed to be the BEST this place has to offer.........), I expect more than just a standard white table cloth meal.

Men are required to wear a jacket. There's a lounge and coat check when you enter. Make reservations ahead of time. Service: Exceptional!!!! Our waiter was extremely personable and made us feel like celebrities there. Never had such phenomenal service. The waiter had asked if my friend and I were celebrating any special occasion. Although I said no, I had mention that we were visiting New York since I had just graduated school.

Food: Gosh, words cannot describe the quality of this meal. Quality, quality, quality. There are chef tasting specials that are included as part of your meal. After ordering, a mini tray of different carrot purees was brought out. It didn't taste like carrot at all! I did the three course prix fixe menu, which was absolutely worth the money!

So I had to try! Arrived a tad early and was seated in bar area with a good amount of other early diners. Because I am all about getting the full experiance had to try a very overpriced cocktail which was strong but on the petite side. We were escorted to the dining room by our French accented host and we had an intimate dinner at a small couple table. Service is swift and attentive. Not overly hovering, but professional and always an earshot away.. I liked that they immediately noted my gluten dairy allergy and were among one of the most respectful restaurants in regards reminding me what I could eat and even what food would be ok for me to share from my husbands menu. I liked my food start to finish. Nothing mind blowing. Clean French preparations with a few attempts at inventive creative ideas. I have to say the thing I hated the most was the odd decor. The heart of the decor is a beautiful classic upper west side old mansion. However some poorly informed designer decided to jazz up the classic moldings with modern lighting , paintings and furniture which detract from your experiance.Overall, the prix fixe price for this level of dining can't be beat.

2.0,8/3/2013,"The rating is low because the expectation, when dining at a michelin starred restaurant, is high.  Daniel didn't meet the bar of 3 stars much less the 4 that it had prior to last week.  Nothing, with the exception of the white cosmo, was memorable.  Was it good?  Yes.  Extraordinary?  No.  Worth the price?  Absolutely not.  Given that they had just lost a star due to lack of consistent customer service, I expected that they would have stepped up their game.  They haven't.  Example: Wine ordered shortly after we were seated showed up almost as we had finished dinner.  Beverages, in general, were not tended to.  And, towards the end of our meal, a VIP showed up.  Or, I can only assume a VIP as the entire staff of the restaurant danced in attendance.  It was interesting to watch and confirmed that an average citizen is not the clientele they are interested in serving.  Instead of spending a fortune here go to the Union Square Cafe.  Better service, more interesting food and much less expensive.",1,0,0,Caroline O.,"Alexandria, VA",0,36,0

3.0,7/21/2013,"Yikes...a relatively low score for a restaurant that has received overwhelmingly positive reviews. Though I've already hurt my own credibility, I ask for your indulgence and to just trust me. If you've looked at the restaurants at this tier on Yelp, you'll generally find that they all have 4+ scores. And this makes sense; these are splurgefests that will fly laps around your neighborhood diner in both food quality and service. In a way, this is helpful, because it allows you to distinguish top tier restaurants from the rest available in NYC. However, if you are trying to choose between these top restaurants, such high marks make it harder to make an informed choice. Let's face it, if you are looking at Daniel, you aren't really trying to decide between this place and a 3 star Mexican takeout. So, I've rated Daniel in relation to its peers, and as it turns out, it is neither spectacular nor a ripoff. See below for a detailed breakdown.Food tastiness: 4.5Originality of culinary ideas: 3Service: 4.5Comparison with Peers: 3The food here is good. I mean, really good. Classically French, with all the luxe ingredients that one would expect. I particularly enjoyed a salt-crusted Madai preparation, as well as an octopus dish that had tremendous and perfectly balanced seasoning. These dishes were made with the type of superlative technical skill that makes everything seem and taste complex. And really, the high points reach the same heights as one would expect from, say, Le Bern or Jean Georges. The problem here though is that in a meal with ~9 courses, there were just the two high points. Other dishes were good, but it seemed like the ingredients were doing most of the heavy lifting. Add enough foie gras and truffle to any dish and it will taste delicious. And yes, meat was cooked perfectly, vegetables were blanched or pureed with exquisite finesse, but in the era of sous vide and electronic temperature monitors, these feats become less impressive. Most importantly, there was no flair of wildly creative imagination. Dishes were solid, tasty, but offered no surprise when I tasted them. There is always a place for strong fundamentals, but for a more traditional approach to stand on its own at this tier of skill and cost, it better be the best damn tenderloin I've ever eaten. Again, I want to emphasize that the food here is really good. The sauces in particular were all exquisite (perhaps another effect of the classical French approach). But, compared with some of the other stuff that is coming out of New York's top kitchens, I can only say that Daniel is solidly in the middle.",1,1,1,Tad V.,"New York, NY",0,3,0
4.0,7/21/2013,"Overrated, but still good. Dessert was way over-proportioned. And, delicious food aside, the chairs at the 2-tops were really uncomfortable. For a several hour tasting menu, Boulud needs some squishier seats.",1,0,1,Tony S.,"New York, NY",10,43,3
5.0,7/17/2013,"Daniel really is as good as any restaurant can get. When I entered the what was deemed ""food palace"", it evoked a feeling of traditional with modern accents. A woman in black caught me off guard as she greeted me at the entrance and took my coat, followed by the friendly receptionist, waiting eagerly to cross my name off the reservations list. We were brought into the main dining room, which had an airy palazzo feeling but with modern accents such as the added frosted glass panels along the ballestry. The waiter who served our table was very professional without being too stuffy presented us with our menus. Being a very authentic French restaurant, Daniel focuses on the best ingredients, creating dishes that are simple, yet uniqueWhat made the restaurant differ from a great restaurant, and such a highly acclaimed restaurant, was the way that it stuck to its philosophy and food integrity, constantly changing and creating new dishes, as well as the high level of service and freebies, making the restaurant seem less like a cost and more of an experience. It made me feel welcomed and not a place out to get your money with gimmicky overpriced foods and drinks And best yet, after the meal, the renowned chef Daniel Boulud was seen walking out of the kitchen and talking to diners and greeting people. In a world where celebrity chefs are constantly out to make money, opening up branches, and spending time on television, it is good to see that there are still honest chefs in the world and in New York City.",7,0,1,Jilly K.,"New York, NY",14,13,12
4.0,7/15/2013,"The food was really good, everything was delicious and beautiful.  Restaurant was beautiful.  It was definitely a wonderful experience.  We did the six-course tasting and each bite was amazing.  The bread they serve you between courses was fresh out of the oven.  They give you warm little Madeline cookies at the end.  But William, if everything was so great why only four-stars?  Well, given that this restaurant is a 3-Michelin rated restaurant there are certain expectations that one has.  One such expectation is a crumb free table.  Of course  there was a guy that came between courses to crumb the table, but he was, shall we say, crummy.  I've seen fewer crumbs from eating a Nature Valley granola bar (hyperbole).  My night was absolutely ruined by the presence of small morsels of leftover food (hyperbole again).  This is the kind of service I would expect at a 2-Michelin restaurant.  C'mon Daniel, if I wanted crumbs I would have eaten with peasants a few blocks away at Park Avenue.  Clean up the crumbs and MAYBE we'll talk five-stars, but until then it's only four.",0,8,0,William C.,"Austin, TX",122,10,0

5.0,7/1/2013,"Daniel is phenomenal. I went here with my wife for our one year anniversary. Yes it is expensive - we did two drinks, the six course tasting menu and a very good Bordeaux for just over 700 with tip. Yes - that's crazy. However it's a 3 star Michelin restaurant in New York and we got a lot.  The entrance is beautiful with fresh flowers and Daniel on the revolving doors and carpet. You enter with the lounge and bar areas to the right. Flowers, modern furniture and dim lighting are the signature. The bar was cozy and the drinks served up by the extremely friendly bartenders were fantastic. The Smokey Bandit and From the Field were both excellent. We then were given our table which was in a secluded corner as we had mentioned it was our 1st anniversary. The service - both wait staff and sommelier were extremely helpful and friendly and were professional while never appearing stuffy. They made jokes - which we loved.

4.0,6/26/2013,"We arrived 35 minutes late for our reservation and we arrived there to be sat in the lounge, as apparently they only hold tables for 30 minutes and in the five minutes between, the table was gone. So we sat in the lounge.There were some amuse-bouches before we started on the bread, and both of us got a tasting menu.  I normally don't comment on the bread, but Daniel deserves a special mention for their bread, as a waiter comes out with a basket of six different kinds of freshly baked bread, and the focaccia and baguette were outstanding. Listed below are the items we ordered and my comments on them:Duck terrine - very good, smooth, flavorfulShimaaji ""Au vin Blanc"" - I did not have this, but my dining companion seemed very happy with itTrio of Hamachi - Hamachi done 3 ways, the only way I did not like was the fully cooked square of hamachiButter poached abalone - please order this, it is very hard to cook abalone to this tenderness, I cannot remember the sides, but I remember being very pleasedSwiss chard ravioli - A good ravioli, but if you get the tasting and have to choose between this and the abalone, do NOT choose thisMonkfish stuffed with lobster - A good dish, but I did not finish the wild rice - too chewy, not worth the effortTrio of milk fed veal - as good as veal getsDuo of beef - between this and the veal trio, please order this. The veal was good, but this duo of beef was **outstanding**.Dessert:Chocolate coulant Coconut VacherinBoth desserts were not memorable, but if I had to choose again, I would probably pick the chocolate coulant. Overall, service was good, coordinated and attentive. The ""giving away"" of our table was a bit of a damper, but I felt it was still a good experience. We paid 600$ for two, and we did not have any wine. If you enjoy ""safe"" and delicious food at a 3* establishment, Daniel is the place for you. I do think Eleven Madison Park is way better than Daniel, so if you are looking for a nice meal in NY, please give EMP a go if you can.Edit: They make a very good mocktail that is a wonderful palate cleanser in between meals.

5.0,6/25/2013,"Shout out to my boyfriend for taking me to Daniel's for my birthday. What a decadent experience!Daniels proved to be a much more detailed, sumptuous, scrumptious  experience than Cafe Boloud. My main rule for great dining - If I can't remember what I ate, I don't need to go back. And I remember! We went with the tasting menu, which, I'm not ashamed to admit, I Google'd beforehand - what the heck is a Lomo Iberico? What does Shimaaji look like? Who's a well informed consumer? ::points thumbs to self:: This girl right here.The amuse-bouche consisted of different variations of sweet potato, all prepared deliciously (I also have a mild bias toward all things sweet potato). If shimaaji was available freely in North America, I'd eat it for breakfast. What a delicate, delicious piece of fish. It absorbed all flavors so incredibly well. The Braised Black Angus Short Ribs were fall off the bone. No knife needed. The sauces were delicious, the flavors mixed exceptionally well. My least favorite dish award (and I still liked it for the most part) goes to the Monkfish with Wild Rice ... not because of the former, however! It's due to the salty latter. The staff is extremely attentive. They move in sync, are extremely knowledgeable about their offerings, and ensure that you receive a 5 star dining experience. They offer a wine pairing with the tasting menu (which, I can imagine, would be extremely filling). Also, jackets are a must for men.  Overall, it ain't cheap!

5.0,6/24/2013,"After a visit to Daniel, it is apparently clear that haute cuisine is not dead (yet). Each dish was more delightful than the last, with a literal symphony of flavors and ingredients blending into a unified, and exceedingly well choreographed experience. I admit at times, there were items on my plate, either standing alone, or mixed within the dish, that were so delicately modified from their original form, I was unsure of what plant or animal they came from. Fortunately, the wait staff was incredibly attentive, informative, entertaining, and charming.Their signature martini, with a touch of bergamot, was flawless and delicious, and worth the $25 price tag (whereas it's not uncommon to find martinis in Manhattan running at that level or more, which are ultimately inferior). The dessert was, to date, the best I've ever had in a restaurant. Each of the multiple courses of desserts of some form or other, that is. But the best was a blend of mango, passionfruit, and a few other fruits I couldn't quite identify, with a crisp, crunchy, meltability reminiscent of so-called astronaut ice cream.

We did 11 Madison park the next night and it simply blew Daniel away- more creative, more fun, better service and the busboy (actually girl) there knew every item on every dish cold- our waiter at Daniel didn't- just not acceptable at this level.

Oh yes, and each table has separate stools where you can place your purses/bags, which just shows how thoughtful the restaurant is in catering to its patrons.

I would definitely recommend the Duo of Beef if you're in the mood for land vs. sea.

Guys, wear a suit and a button up.  No tie is necessary but wear one if you bought one while shopping in NYC and want to feel like someone important.  Also, there's a rule to wear your suit jacket the entire time while in the restaurant.  You can't take it off.  Learn from my mistake as I felt like an idiot when I took it off; nothing they did, it was all in my head.  Just saving you the embarrassment in your own head.  But for those who have an issue with keeping your jacket on, don't worry the temperature is magically perfect all the time.Service was perfect.  I can always tell when I never asked for water to be filled and forgot that I forgot to ask for more water until thinking about it later.We ordered the 6 course tasting.  Everything was delicious and very very solid in terms of quality, preparation and creativity.  There is also a 3 course as well.  There were so many things on the menu I wanted to try but we just couldn't.  So I would want to go back!  I do have some notes which I did read previously on yelp too:1) FishSome of their fish courses sound, on the menu, to me, more of a sashimi style but they were, I think, cooked with acid or some way where the fish is slightly cooked.  Some reviews mentioned this, more along the lines of, ""they overcooked the fish"" or whatnot but it's just the restaurant's style and interpretation.  Just an FYI, it was good but I too love delicate fish prepared more raw and untouched with only flavor accompaniments vs. cooking the fish however delicately it's done.  The fish we had were all smoked or cooked with acid or poached some way and they were delicious but just a preference thing to have cold fish dishes more raw.2) Veal courses Veal prepared 3 ways was very delicious but I did expect more in terms of overall flavor and preparation style.  All of it was very tasty, again just probably some expectations of my own.The sommelier was extremely informative, down to earth and gracious in his delivery so Kudos to him for making people feel comfortable.6 course will take about 3-3.5 hours depending on how interesting the people are that you go with.  But well worth every moment.As a last note, the normal coffee was just ""alright"".  Usually when we dine at great restaurants I always look forward to whatever special house coffee they have.  The one we were served was just OK.For sure worth 1 visit.  I'm going back for a 2nd for sure.",5,1,0,Alan W.,"Playa Vista, CA",64,84,12

We had 4 or 5 waitress who made sure we have everything we needed all the time.Very surprising thing happened when we asked for vegetarian recommendations and they offered their vegetarian menu! After hearing they have a vegetarian menu I was sold.  First of all, their bread is delicious. They serve it fresh and warm right from the oven. Different REAL flavors. The garlic bread actually have garlic pieces in it, and the olive bread with pieces of olives.  First course we took 3 different appetizers, asparagus cream, ravioli, and the white polenta which was unbelievable! Main course we took the char (similar to salmon just without the fat) and black sea bass. Both dishes were absolutely amazing. Unique and beautiful serving. The food was excellent. For desert we took almost everything they had on the menu (from the chocolate side). I really liked the pistachio desert. Overall, we had a great time.

I could not stop. Their cheese focaccia were great too.Free birthday dessert, which was chef's creative inspiration of the moment. They try to compliment it with the rest of your dessert courses, and it succeeded.LOVED their hot madeleines, which were served during dessert. It was super fluffy with just a hint of sweetness.Complimentary plate of sweets which included mini macaron, variety of gelatin concoction and mini fluffy cakes. Great to nibble with your ice cream.At the end of dessert course, they serve a variety of mini chocolate bites. It was good, but by then I was so stuffed I couldn't taste anything anymore.Did their 3 course prix fixe. My favorite was their foie gras, which just melted in your mouth. Taste of foie gras was not overpowering but with just the right amount of kick that made it linger in your mouth. They also had a black cod special which I devoured. The cod was crispy on the outside but super fluffy and soft on the inside. It was cooked just right! The celery and broccoli gave the dish some texture.Abalone with sea buckthorn was ingenious. The tarteness of the sea buckthorn really elevated the flavor of the creamy, hearty abalone. The greens also helped to balance the buttery-ness of the abalone.

5.0,4/23/2013,"Obviously given the ingredient quality, pinpoint preparation and excellent service this place warrants a high rating. Had the tasting menu (seemed unbearably long but that is a given in any high end restaurant that serves that many courses). MUST make a note here. ALL FISH (except shelled fish) should be BANNED from restaurants such as this and wiped clean from the tasting menus with no record of having ever been there. I adore high end French restaurants but I must say that from all of my experience, they do not understand how to prepare fish. It is all about show and ego rather than execution. Fish should not be prepared like a piece of red meat. Such treatment often compromises the delicacy of soft fishes. If Daniel wipes fish off of its menu, it could be a culinary force to be reckoned with. Because of the fish, Daniel is teetering between 4 and 5 stars. Everything else besides the fish was great.",2,2,1,Davis K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,61,1

Two days ago we had the 16 tasting menu at Eleven Madison Square, where we had dishes that had odd tastes ( minced carrot with mustard oil, butternut squash mustard, celery for dessert, etc, and the tiniest steak we ever seen 1 inch big). Everything had well balanced taste, the rice ball in the abalone appetizer tasted good, but it was a but too hard, not crisp. Service was impeccable, very pleasant. We had a great time, and felt we had a better meal than at EMP.

5.0,4/16/2013,"What can I say other than mindblowingly amazing! My parents took me here (admittedly a couple of years ago) for my 22nd birthday. My purse wasn't even allowed to be on my chair or the floor, it had to have it's own settee! (I thought this was a bit extravagant, but it goes along nicely with the ambiance.) The staff was extremely knowledgeable, especially the sommelier! We ordered wine pairing with dinner and when we didn't understand the choice she had made or wasn't thrilled with the pairing for our taste, she helped us choose a wine we liked. She was especially eloquent at explaining why she had made the original pairing with the food, which I deeply appreciate. The food was absolutely superb! Every bite was complex and when I tasted a single part of the dish without the other pieces (condiments, ect.) each piece was merely improved by the complimenting pieces. My favorite part was that they were extremely accomodating for my mother, who is Kosher, which can be quite difficult and annoying for 99% of restaurants with a pre fix menu. (I honestly don't recall whether or not they had a vegetarian option or not, but my recollection says they were able to change it for her.) I still haven't had a better meal before or after and I hope to find another excuse to go there again!

3.0,4/5/2013,"I would say that Daniel is a great restaurant. We had a good dining experience here last week. The food was amazing, all cooked to perfection. The only thing that bother us the most was the timing between appetizer and the main course. We had to wait for almost 35-40 minutes after we finish out appetizer before they served our main course. That was really a drawback. No matter how amazing is the food, but if you had to wait that long, it was not an amazing experience. Otherwise, i will give 5 stars for this restaurant.",0,0,0,Ira A.,"San Mateo, CA",1,28,1
3.0,4/4/2013,"Daniel has great food, but is super expensive and the service is pretentious. For three Michelin stars, I expected much more!Daniel is certainly the right place to celebrate a special occasion, especially an anniversary. It's extremely fancy. Every single gentlemen was wearing a suit even in the lounge where it is not required to do so. We decided to go with the three course prix fixe menu. First Course: Warm Green Asparagus Salad served with a Soft Poached Quail Egg, Mustard Dressing, Miner Lettuce. This dish was pretty tasty. The quail eggs were poached perfectly. Five star salad. Second Course: Oven Baked Black Sea Bass topped with Syrah Sauce, Crispy Yukon Gold Potato, Tellicherry Pepper, Kale Flan, and Shallot Marmalade. The fish was fresh and light. I really enjoyed it, but it was nothing special. Four star entree. Third Course: Warm Guanaja Chocolate Coulant served with Liquid Caramel, Fleur de Sel, and Sorbet. This chocolate cake was pretty delicious. There was one issue with my dessert. I am lactose intolerant and I asked for dairy-free sorbet. When I received my dessert, I noticed that they served me dairy sorbet. I don't eat any dairy at all because I am highly sensitive and I think that this was a HUGE mistake on their part. What if I were truly had a hypersensitivity reaction and went into anaphylaxis and died while dining in their three star Michelin restaurant. I mean allergies and dietary restrictions are to be taken seriously and unfortunately Daniel FAILED! Service: Three star service. Accomodating dietary restrictions is part of the service and you already heard about my experience with that so no need to elaborate further. They brought out several sorbets to make up for their mistake but I didn't think that it helped. Every time I have dined at a high-end restaurant and they have forgotten about my dairy allergy, they incessantly apologize and make a portion of my meal complementary. (I went to Blue Ribbon in Soho and they made my entire meal complementary because they mistakenly served me dairy. Now I would never expect that at Daniel since the food is so expensive however I think they could have done something more.) The servers look like they are trying too hard. It just does not look natural. They are so intense and it creates an uncomfortable atmosphere. I like to go to restaurants where I feel relaxed and comfortable. Final comment on the service: When we finished our meal, we waited about 30 minutes and nobody came over and brought us our check. We were in no rush to leave so we sat and hung out for a little while but it start to get awkward. I appreciate the fact that they did not want to rush us out, but I had trouble even getting a hold of our server to bring us the check. Overall, I think Daniel is an average restaurant. Extremely overpriced and just not worth it. The value is just not there. And if you have food allergies...stay away...because they may just forget about your allergies... There are so many other restaurants I have been to which deserve three Michelin Stars over Daniel any day!",5,1,0,Kiki P.,"Boston, MA",238,261,1663

I also really enjoyed the lobster appetizer, by then I was a bit full for my meal but I had managed to eat up most of the fish and of course leave room for dessert. When I thought things couldn't get any better, we were surprised by a small basket of warm madeleine cookies which really closed of the evening very nicely.",2,0,3,Mai L.,"New York, NY",218,372,418
5.0,2/20/2013,"This may very well represent the best meal I've ever had. The service is almost telepathic. I was here with my aunt and uncle and my parents who were visiting and when they brought a little stool out for my aunt's handbag, she nearly swooned. Hard to believe it's possible, but the food is even better than the service. I had a rabbit something or other the first time I went and it was divine. It's a long way from cheap, but if you can afford it I find it very hard to imagine anything better.",0,0,0,Mike F.,"New York, NY",3,10,0
5.0,2/20/2013,"Service and food was extraordinary. The syncopated serving was pleasant and was really an authentic French restaurant, having been to France myself. 100% recommended.

4.0,2/18/2013,"Came back for dinner and it was pretty amazing. The last time I was here, the food felt like very well-cooked bistro food but nothing really amazing. This time though, the dishes all contained elements that made me perk up in my seat and smile with pleasure. The squab terrine and beef cheeks were blissful bursts of flavor, and the tableside presentation of the salt-crusted fish was awesome to see. I really think the food this time was noticeably better than the last time I was here - the intense and rich flavor profiles in every dish was just outstanding. A lot of meat jus were reduced to concentrate the flavors and made the sauces incredible.Our waiter also had a great sense of humor, and helped make the dinner quite enjoyable. He brought out the octopus dish and just told us ""it's octopus...i don't know what else is in it.........."" before firing out the rest of the elements of the dish like a machine gun. I was quite impressed and had to up my initial rating.",1,2,2,Monte H.,"Cupertino, CA",431,343,209

4.0,2/15/2013,Daniel just didn't have that wow me factor to let me rate this a true 5 stars.  Came here for dinner with my girl friends and opted for the 3 course tasting menu.  The ambiance was beautiful and service was good.

5.0,2/11/2013,"I'm so glad and honored that I can rate this place because I've actually tried it now.The place is dimly lit and beautiful. Right by the entrance is the coat check and then we were quickly seated in the back room. The seating was a little weird as we were facing out to the rest of the patrons. I came with my bf and it would have been nice if we could either face each other or sit next to each other.. we were placed in a awkward 45 degree angle.Where I sat, there was a draft so I was really cold at one point. I don't know if I was seated underneath a vent, but I didn't see any doors or windows behind me. I think perhaps there was a kitchen entrance behind me? But shouldn't it be hot then?We went with the three prix fixe dinner menu.Before our appetizers came out, we got a complimentary amuse bouche. It was salmon, some parsnip cream, and shrimp.The salmon was delicious and the cream was light and tasty. The shrimp had a bit too much lemon zest for my taste.Appetizer:I ordered the DUCK TERRINE RED WINE POACHED FORELLE PEAR (sorry for the caps, I'm just copying and pasting from their menu).It tasted a bit dense for my taste, and almost felt like i was biting into a chunk of cheese.The bf got MAINE PEEKYTOE CRAB SALAD WITH GRANNY SMITH APPLEI absolutely hate seafood because of the smell and taste but this one was delicious and sweet.Main:DUO OF BEEF- I got this because the other entrees sounded a bit game-y but I have no regrets! Texture was perfect, sauce was perfect, flavor was spot on.TRIO OF MILK FED VEAL- This was good too but I enjoyed my dish better.Dessert:MILK CHOCOLATE DACQUOISE- I'm not a big chocolate dessert fan but I was swayed by the salted caramel ice cream. The pastry was really soft and not overwhelming.PEANUT BUTTER FEUILLETINE- my bf and I really enjoyed this one. It was light and crispyMy absolute favorite was the complimentary bread. Their parmesan garlic focaccia is HEAVEN. I think I ate 3 of these.Their complimentary madelines were so airy and tasty.All of the food had beautiful presentation and I'm glad I got to experience a michelin star restaurant because I believe a great restaurant will make foods you normally don't enjoy into something pleasing and delicious. Seafood and madelines are things I don't normally enjoy, but if Boulud wanted to make them for me, I'd eat them any day.Great experience. Thank you.",2,1,0,Min K.,"Manhattan, NY",70,213,75

5.0,2/6/2013,"Daniel is one of the restaurants in NYC that I've wanted to go to for a long time, so I was a bit bummed out when I had to cancel my reservation for this weekend because of a late-scheduled trip. However, my fiancee and I decided to make an exception and visit the restaurant this past Monday for a low-key birthday dinner. While the outside looks like the entrance to a hotel, make no mistake - this is a very serious dining area. There's a bar and lounge to the side when you come in, and the main dining room is straight ahead. It's very ornate - a very similar vibe to what I felt like stepping into NoMad - and you have seats ringed around the depressed center (which looks like it is for bigger groups). Even for a Monday at 8:30, Daniel was packed - so definitely plan ahead of time if you'd like to come for dinner. In particular, if you want to do the tasting menu, you have to show up by 10 or so at the latest. The service here was probably better than most of the upscale New York restaurants - the waiters explain everything, make sure you are filled up on water and bread, and perhaps most importantly - have a personality (which is sorely lacking at the majority of upscale places here). As for dress code - men, jacket is required; don't come in wearing jeans, and tie is not necessary.The food itself was incredibly good, even though I was worried that a Monday night dinner may mean the food was not as fresh as the weekend. On that note, the amuse bouche was okay - the smoked salmon and small shrimp didn't taste all that fresh, although the parsnip soup was excellently whipped up and prepared. We both did the current tasting menu, which meant we got to sample everything available. While the squab terrine was okay, it was a bit on the meaty side (I've never had excellent terrine with anything resembling chicken in it), but the duck terrine was fabulous - it melted on contact when you took a bite, and it worked really well when paired with the jam. The seafood dishes here were also very well done, even though I think of French food with more of a focus on land meats. The crab salad was very much like a deliciously light sushi roll, while the poached cod was extremely moist and tender, and the parsley vinaigrette added a dash of very light (but not overbearing) dash of natural flavor. The grilled swordfish was very well-done; I particularly enjoyed the sauce it was cooked in, and it wasn't as meaty as swordfish fillets can be. The black bass was delicious slightly charred, but what struck me was the texture - it was very fresh and flaky, but it had a smooth texture to it that didn't give much. To say the least, it was amazing.The rest of the dishes were incredibly good as well. I had frog legs for the first time at Daniel, and I think I'd eat them a lot more if they were prepared in a similar manner elsewhere - marinaded in a very savory sauce, with an almost fish-like flakiness when taking a bite. The fennel ravioli is prepared with great care; there's broth inside the ravioli, just like a soup dumpling you'd eat in Chinatown - incredible. The meat dishes are spectacular; the duo of beef is so good, especially the braised short ribs...these are covered in a rich sauce that really brings out the hearty flavor of the ribs, and it just falls apart in your mouth. The trio of milk fed veal was amazing; the highlight of the three was the cheek 'blanquette' - it's kind of like a veal meatball, but this, too, just falls apart in your mouth. It has a slightly smoky flavor that really adds depth to the meat. Last (but not least), we had dessert. The molten chocolate cake is delicious; it's the perfect mix of a cake that's not too moist but not too crumbly. The huckleberry vacherin is incredibly light given that it is apparently made of cheese; if anything, it seemed to be as light as cream. Combined with the various dots of citrus flavors, this one will explode all of your palate. The restaurant was kind enough to serve us with a few additional desserts for my birthday, and they did not disappoint; the apple crisp was absolutely mouthwatering, while the granny apple sorbet perfectly captured the tartness of the apple. To finish it all off, we had a small basket of madeleine cookies - very light, not overly sweet, and a perfect way to finish the meal.The whole experience definitely puts this as one of the top restaurants I've ever been to, with the service being a substantial highlight. We got a dated copy of the tasting menu, which is a really cool way to remember a birthday by. My only complaint, if at all, was that we didn't really get good advice on the wine - but I had a 1996 Lopez de Heredia that had a restrained dryness to it that worked throughout the meal. If you're looking for the complete package - amazing food, great decor, and service that goes above and beyond robotically reciting the dishes and filling your water, Daniel is such a place. Three Michelin stars well-deserved, indeed.",3,2,1,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",371,1653,169
5.0,2/4/2013,"My boyfriend surprised me with a delicious dinner here for my birthday.  After living in the city for eight years, this is one restaurant I had been dying to try, but still had never visited.  Everything about that night was spectacular!  My boyfriend arranged for a special corner table that provided complete privacy (because it was hidden) from other diners.  It was so romantic!  It was the best table and service I have ever experienced - my boyfriend gets extra points up for arranging this special surprise!We ordered the foie gras, lobster, and duo of beef.  The foie gras was melt-in-your mouth fantastic and I do not believe I will ever taste a foie gras as delicious as this one.  The duo of beef was also outstanding.  Although the portions appear small, because the flavors are so rich, you feel like you are eating a lot and will not leave hungry - we felt stuffed!  The desserts were beautiful to look at and tasted delicious as well, but the shining stars of the evening were certainly the foie gras and beef.  We also ordered a special bottle of wine from the region in France where my boyfriend grew up - Chateauneuf-du-Pape - so it was a real treat to see that bottle on the menu.  What a special night - one I will never forget.  I hope to return to Daniel again to celebrate more special occasions!",1,0,2,Laura L.,"Atlanta, GA",1,23,0

Service was great, again, I got to sit on the squishy side of the booths that I am so fond of.I did like the focaccia bread with olives that was offered to us.. My sea bass was cooked well, however lacked overall flavor. My date had the suckling pig which was nothing special, and.. yeah. I'm so underwhelmed I can't even write anything more. Had something way too sweet for dessert. The madeline cookies were good though. But I did not come here for cookies.Maybe we should have gone for the six course? I don't know.

5.0,12/31/2012,"Tonight was my first time dining in a three star Michelin restaurant.  I was fortunate to get reservations at Daniel and I came in with high expectations after reading the stellar Yelp reviews.  I came to New York with my best friend and we both ordered the six course tasting menu. 1.  DUCK TERRINE, RED WINE POACHED FORELLE PEAR.  This dish was made with Asian pear, ginger-onion jam, Mâché salad and duck pâté with duck foie gras.  The duck terrine was fabulous.  Creamy, rich and it literally melted in your mouth as soon as you bite it. It came accompanied with a thinly sliced delicately toasted bread slightly warm and toasted on the outside and soft on the inside.  Overall, this appetizer was fabulous!  Complex yet very simple and elegant.2.  MAINE PEEKYTOE CRAB SALAD WITH GRANNY SMITH APPLE.  This second course was accented with pickled cranberries, celery shavings, and walnut oil.  This was a delicate dish very light and refreshing.  The Granny Smith apples were crisp and fresh and the crab rolled inside the Granny Smith apple shavings was a wonderful savory item.  The salty of the crab and the sweetness and acidity of the apple when very well together.3.  FENNEL RAVIOLI, SCOTTISH LANGOUTINES.  This course was one of my favorites.  It came with sautéed cuttlefish, Sicilian Green olive artichoke and Saffron cream sauce.  The Saffron cream sauce was rich and very flavorful.  The small ravioli was filled with a broth filling which reminded me of something similar to lobster bisque! The sautéed cuttlefish was a great accent to this wonderful rich dish.  If you love seafood ravioli, you will die and go to heaven after tasting this dish of bliss.4.  CEDAR WOOD WRAPPED HAMACHI.  This course was accompanied with braised celery, caramelized salsify Cipollini onion, and mustard seed-bourbon sauce.  The cedar wood wrapped hamachi was very delicate in flavor and the fish was cooked absolutely to perfection.  Flaky and moist with a light flavor which didn't overpower the natural flavor of the fish.  5.  ROASTED ELYSIAN FIELD LAMB CHOP.  This was accompanied with Brussels sprout-Speit risotto, sautéed black trumpet, glazed turnips, Manouri cheese, and HayLamb Jus.  The lamb was well seasoned on the outside of the shank but a perfect medium rare in the middle.  This was the best lamb shank I've ever eaten.  It was sooooo soft and juicy and it literally just melted in your mouth.  6.  WARM GUANAJA CHOCOLATE COULANT.  This dessert came with liquid caramel, fleur de sel, and milk sorbet.  The chocolate coulant was very delicate with the liquid caramel inside was absolutely lovely.  The ambiance is very romantic and classy.  All gentlemen are required to wear blazers or suit jackets to dinner service.  Ladies should also wear a dress or a classy cocktail dress to dinner.  Cancellations need to be made 24 hours in advance or you will be charged $75.  The six course tasting menu doesn't come at a cheap price.  It comes with a price tag of $195 per person and the table must order the tasting menu.  This is without wine pairing which can be an additional $105 per person. Be aware, there are no free refills on soda.  A small glass of diet coke will cost you $6 a glass.  Also if you order bottle water, it will cost you $10 for Fiji water.  They do have tap water on hand if you don't want the bottled water.  Also a cup of latte will set you back $9 per cup. These are things you might want to know when dining at Daniel.  I have never been so pleased with dinner service.  It was like there were two waiters available for every table.  Service was synchronized with appetizers and entrees arriving together and both waiters delivering the dishes at the same time and removing finished plates at the same time.  Water is routinely filled and a assortment of fresh baked bread is offered between courses.  Silverware is changes after every course despite being used or not.  Overall, the dinner service was exceptional and the feeling and attention you feel when dining at Daniel makes you feel like royalty!  I'm looking forward to my next trip to New York and tasting more of their wonderful courses.  I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who would like to bring someone special to a memorable dinner experience.  This is a fabulous place to bring either a special date, a special client or business person, wife, or close friends.",7,0,1,Tet W.,"Portland, OR",44,230,93

4.0,12/25/2012,"Daniel was a great experience and everything was top notch. From the entrance/walk in to our sit down dinner, everything was set to impress. My boyfriend and I went on a Saturday for our six year anniversary and wanted the eight course menu, but I guess it's not available on weekends. Bummer. So we settled for the six course (first world problems..). We made sure to get one of everything. Everything was good and very impressive - from caviar to 24 carat gold leaves ...it was pretty incredible. You'd have to be brain dead, or well, dead, to not be impressed. Food wise - I prefer French bistro - this food was a bit stiff for me, even with my high end foodie palate. I left full, but not exactly satisfied - I left wishing that I went to my favorite restaurant, Babbo, instead. It would have been half the price (Daniel came to approximately $700 dollars), and I could have indulged in pasta heaven. Some of my courses were a bit dinky. But then again, I am very partial to Italian. I'm basically a Mario Batali groupie. My favorite was the desserts. I felt they were the most substantial and satisfying. All in all, our cocktails were amazing (one came in an ice ball!!), we got a nice bottle of wine, and food was good. Daniel himself was there and was going from table to table asking how everything was. Very nice touch, to say the least. The night was incredible - I went to Bloomingdales for a dress and shoes just for the occasion and Daniel's staff made sure I felt like a princess that night. Great for a special occasion. I'm glad I can cross it off my foodie bucket list, but I don't think that I will be back. I'd like to get Per Se and Eleven Madison Park off my food bucket list next, but I have a feeling I'll leave wishing I'd just gone back to Babbo or Del Posto.",1,1,1,Antonette L.,"Manhattan, NY",317,41,3

They had a poached pineapple dessert in the spring, which was beautifully light and tasty! The tasting menu has six courses and two choices for each one so I recommend going with someone who is willing to share and then getting both options for each course so you get to try everything!The servers here are unfailingly polite, making sure that your experience doesn't lack for everything. They make sure that your seats are comfortable (and they are quite plush with the cushions provided) and that anything you request is brought to you very quickly.Atmosphere is very nice, a good spot to eat with friends or maybe a romantic dinner.",2,1,1,Kelsey T.,"New York, NY",401,440,62
5.0,12/18/2012,"Daniel is the top of the charts in NYC dining.  We had an awesome table in the corner to celebrate our anniversary.  The waitstaff was on top of it and did everything in pairs (remove, serve, pour).  The wine pairings for our three-course were spot on.  Appropriate sized portions.  Bring your credit limit--a bit pricey, as expected.  Great decor and control of volume (intimate for personal conversations).  Great location near Guggenheim/Central Park/5th Ave.",0,0,0,Jeff L.,"Southlake, TX",82,43,37
2.0,12/18/2012,"After using this site for years as a reference point for trying new restaurants, my experience at Daniel has compelled me to create an account and publish a review. I concede that my experience was an isolated one, but I am nonetheless extremely unhappy. Our evening began by waiting at the bar for 45 minutes past our reservation time. It's hard to say for sure what would have happened if we were the ones who had  shown up this late without explanation, but I can only assume we would have suffered some sort of repercussions. And I fully realize that this situation in itself is largely beyond the restaurant's control. But we were offered no explanation whatsoever in the meantime, nor any attempt to offer a complimentary glass of champagne (or any equivalent consolation.) This situation alone is not consistent with other restaurants of the same reputation and price point. The servers were definitely polite and hard-working, but I regret to say that the food and wine were nowhere near what we expected. We have eaten at 1-, 2-, and 3-star Michelin restaurants in Chicago, France, and the San Francisco Bay Area, and our experience at this 3-star establishment fell far short of our relative expectations. Too many of our dishes on the tasting menu were under-seasoned or anti-climactic, relative to experiences we have had at comparable restaurants. We realize that the restaurant business ultimately is a subjective enterprise, and perhaps our fellow diners had a much more enjoyable experience. However, I would say that if you are the sort of diner who loves places like Alinea, Le Cinq, Cyrus, Saison, l'Atelier de Joel Robuchon and the French Laundry, you may well find yourself disappointed here. However, if you want a restaurant where the chef is seen schmoozing with a select few important clients and seemingly allowing mediocrity on the plates put in front of you, then this is your place. I might also add that when I went to the restroom for the second time after about 90 minutes, the half-eaten piece of shortbread cookie was *still* sitting atop the urinal. This is not what I'd expect from a 3-star Michelin restaurant in New York City. I honestly hope that no one else who pays this much money for dinner here has the same experience.",1,0,0,Matty P.,"SoHo, Manhattan, NY",0,1,0

5.0,12/13/2012,"For my 600th review (!!!), I purposely arranged it so that I'm writing about my very first 3-star Michelin dining experience, which was at the elegant, superb DANIEL restaurant in New York City.   Four of us (me, my husband, my daughter and her boyfriend) dined on the Friday after Thanksgiving for what was a belated birthday celebration for me.  I couldn't have celebrated any finer.For someone as food-oriented as I am, I was completely in awe of and (slightly intimidated, to be honest) by the perfection to which this restaurant aspires.... and inspires.  You know, I find myself even now feeling at a loss for the words to describe this gastronomic experience.  I don't think I could do it justice.  Honestly.  My words will fall short, not to mention, with all the other reviews, I won't add anything to what's been said before now.  Beginning with their cocktails, such as the Ivory Pearl, which was an ""ice ball"" filled with rum infused with champagne mango, curry leaves, vanilla, coconut milk, and some 23 year old Rum..... to the very last bite of their signature Madeleines that they place on every table at the end of a meal, we wanted for nothing.  It was sumptuous, sublime, elegant.  It was the perfect meal.While I struggled for a couple of months with going for the 3-course pre-fixe or 6-course tasting, we ultimately elected to go with the 3-course dining experience.  Between the little extras, such as an amuse bouche trio of broccoli, the bread, a full appetizer, the entree, and several different desserts, the 3-course meal turned out to be just fine.  While we did not leave stuffed, we definitely did not leave hungry, either.While I was underwhelmed with the plate presentation at A Voce, I must say that at Daniel, it was exquisite.  It was exotic, beautiful, mysterious, lovely.  Each plate was a work of art, and I didn't want to eat it.  I did eat every bite, of course, but I really wanted to keep it in its original artistic beauty.  I really wanted to photograph each plate, too, but there was something about Daniel that just made me feel awkward for doing so.  I toned it waaaaaaaay down and got a few pictures, but not nearly the amount I wanted or would have done elsewhere. My husband and daughter's boyfriend ordered the Suckling of Pig for their entree, my daughter had the Duo of Beef, and I, of course, had the Lamb.  I love lamb, so why not have it made by the best?  It was divine.  For my appetizer, I ordered the Nantucket Bay Scallops Ceviche, which had red grapefruit, avocado, pickled Buddha hand lemon and chive oil.  I cannot begin to say how delicious this dish was, and never in a million years, would I ever have paired any of these ingredients, let alone know what to do with some of them.  Simply amazing.  The same with my lamb dish..... it had brussels sprout- spelt risotto, sautéed black trumpet glazed turnips, manouri cheese, and haylamb jus.  You know, this just transcends any and all ideas I ever had about thinking I'm such a foodie.  I clearly know nothing.  My lamb entree had things that I would never eat, let alone, pair.  The brussel sprouts were so amazingly delicious, I can't believe how much I liked them.  I'm still stunned.  I didn't taste anybody else's works of art, I was too busy with my own dining experience.For dessert, they asked me what I wanted, so I ordered the Milk Chocolate Dacquoise, served with jivara parfait, toffee tuile, and salted caramel ice cream.  What I didn't know is that they were also bringing me a beautiful plate with Happy Birthday Claudia scrolled in chocolate, but it was a different dessert..... the Vanilla Poached Pear, which had maple parfait, mirliton biscuit, and honey ice cream.  I never would have ordered that, and yet, it was, as you might guess, fabulous.......as was my chocolate perfection.  My daughter ordered the warm guanaja chocolate coulant, with liquid caramel, fleur de sel, and milk sorbet.  The two men, once again, ordered something, and at this time, I can't remember what.  My mind stopped at chocolate.... and the surprisingly delicious pear.  Not to mention, they brought a plate of chocolates and a basket of these amaaaaaaaaazing freshly baked, warm, orange-infused madeleines.  OMG, those were good.  I mean, how much could one person eat?  I just took bites of the dessert.  I didn't finish anything, and yes, I'm still having nightmares about that.  LOL  How could I have wasted even one morsel of food from Daniel?  I apologize for sounding redundant, but the meal was perfect.  I'm out of my league here trying to sound like I know what I'm talking about......it was so far above anything I have ever experienced, tasted, witnessed.....and I am so grateful I have now seen what this kind of dining is like.  This was the road less traveled.... for me.... and I can't wait to go again.  Lovely, lovely meal.  Thank you, Daniel Boulud.  You are brilliant, and I am but your humble servant to spread my meager words.",12,9,11,Claudia B.,"Simi Valley, CA",1144,1299,6819

5.0,12/11/2012,"Daniel was absolutely an unparalleled experience of class and gastronomic delight.  My wife were able to get last minute reservations by sheer luck (Daniel accepts reservations up to 1 month in advance), and being a 3-Michelin star restaurant, we decided to go for the full experience.Our six-course tasting menu with wine pairings was universally excellent.  It's hard to pick specific stand-outs, but 3-part tasting of mackeral, as well as the duo of beef were particularly wonderful.  Everything was presented impeccably in true dining theatre fashion.  Our servers were almost eerily attentive to our every needs, yet very affable and friendly when conversing.A personal favorite moment for me was mentioning to my wife (out of earshot, I thought) that I wondered if they offered espresso in addition to regular coffee as an after dinner drink.  Little did I know that my statement had been heard, and after our dessert course, two small cups of perfectly extracted espresso appeared with a grin from our server.  It was a delightful conclusion to the meal.My other personal anecdote is regarding the personalized menus.  At the conclusion of the dinner, we were presented with menus of our meal -- not uncommon with high class tasting menus.  Unfortunately, after martinis, six courses of wine pairing and a digestif, we forgot them at the table!  I called the restaurant the next day and they said they could promptly mail them to us.  At Daniel, the quality service continues even after you have left!We would definitely go back, but it should be said that a meal like the one we experienced is certainly a rare thing in life.  If you can, you shouldn't miss it.",1,0,0,Nate M.,"Dallas, TX",29,31,1

When we entered the restaurant I was impressed how we were greeted. We waited for a few minutes by the bar and ordered some cocktails. Once our table was ready, we were escorted to our seats. The main dining area was very cozy and yet sophisticated. Prior to coming to the restaurant, I had looked at the menu online. We wanted to try the 6 course meal but because we had abreservation to a comedy show we were advised against it. They were attentive to our itinerary which I thought was good.From the food perspective, their appetizer was the best meal of the evening. They gave us some lobster appetizer as complimentary and it was to die for. They served us a per-appetizer meal and it was nothing I ever tasted - it played around with our taste pallet.  For my main entry I had the suckling pig and it was good. The dessert was amazing!

4.0,11/14/2012,"In NYC for an unforgettable five days, my sweetie did his research and treated me to an amazing, unforgettable French feast at Daniel. We went with the 6-course tasting menu (with wine pairing), which featured two choices for each course. And since the resto didn't require that we order the exact same courses - unlike some *other* restaurants - we got a taste of everything. Unfortch, this isn't the kind of restaurant I'd whip my camera out to take snaps of the delicious and beautiful food, nor did I sit there and mentally recite what I was going to mention in my Yelp review - hey, I wanted to savor each bite - so I don't remember everything that we had. But mark my word, every bite was ... how do the French say? ... ""magnifique."" Since this was such a romantic and thoughtful dinner, I thanked my date by surprising him with a Daniel Boulud cook book. There was a display of all his culinary books en route to the ladies room, and I was able to sneak to the front, pay for it, and they brought it to our table before we left. The *only* boo-hoo moment we had during the entire dinner - from cocktails in the lobby/bar to walking out the door - was when our server informed us that Chef Boulud wasn't available to sign the book since he was gone for the evening. I gotta say, for such a pricey and prestigious restaurant, they should already have each book pre-signed.

5.0,10/18/2012,"This is another one that should get way more than 5 stars. Went here for an anniversary dinner and it was the single best meal of my life. First things first - what to wear? Preserve the dignity of the institution and dress nice. I didn't go buy an expensive dress for the occasion just a nice dress I already owned and my husband wore a suit. We did overhear a nearby male diner being informed of the dress code after he was seated. The restaurant is gorgeous inside and I found myself just staring at the ceiling in awe through lulls in the meal. We started off right with a white cosmopolitan which was delicious and served with a sphere of ice with a flower in the middle. I was given a stool to put my purse on so it wasn't on the floor (very nice touch). Someone comes around with a tray of bread soon after giving you a choice of various types of little artisan rolls. The service was beyond amazing and so friendly and helps you to relax. Now the menu has changed of course. The amuse bouche was shrimp three ways, each more delicious than the last. For appetizer I can't even remember what my husband had, only that he was in love with it, because I was so focused on my own appetizer - frog legs fricassee (or yummy frog lollipops) with some diced up frog in a sweet sauce down the center and a butternut squash puree on one side and spaghetti squash on the other side. In one word, beautiful. For entree I again don't remember what the husband had I think it was lamb, which was very good but didn't compare to my grouse and foie gras. Grouse isn't poultry so don't get confused, it tastes more venison. I also happen to hate foie (I'm unenlightened and find it too strong of a taste) but it was perfectly balanced along the sides of the grouse. It came on top of a little waffle with butternut squash on top of that which was all amazing. We got a complimentary dessert for our anniversary which was a pear cake and amazing, I had something chocolate and peanut butter which isn't on the menu anymore but was again amazing and the husband had something caramel that I wanted to steal. With coffee you might think it's all done but it's not - like the bread there's a selection of truffles going around, a small basket of madelines (the best I've ever had) and a plate of petit fours which were all delicious little bites. This is the service and food you expect. This is an experience everyone should have. It's pricey sure, but you get everything you pay for and then some.

4.0,10/18/2012,"Came here to celebrate my birthday, was a really delightful, memorable experience. There were three reasons that I couldn't give this 5-stars, although the food was truly a top restaurant experience... I realize that these might seem trivial, but with a bevvy of fine dining places here in Manhattan, it's worth pointing out the differences between them.(1) Arrival/entrance. When we arrived at Daniel, the coat attendant quickly took care of us and then we headed over to the hostess stand. She was on the phone and gave us the ""one minute"" hand gesture. Then a second hostess arrived and stood there smiling at us, but not taking over for the one on the phone. It ended up being this very awkward experience that felt like we were at any-place, not at Daniel.(2) Table seating, waiting. We were seated, immediatly offered the drink list, and asked our choice for water. We ordered two glasses of champagne, those arrived. And then, we waited. No menu, no small bite, nothing. We proceeded through half our glasses of champagne, boyfriend and I were discussing how neither of us wanted to stand up and ask if we could see a menu. We were hoping our waiter would show up and save the day. Luckily, after we said ""one more minute and then we'll ask"" our server arrived. The rest of the meal was flawlessly executed by the waitstaff, but we waited just long enough at the start that we thought we were forgotten. Not sure if this had something to do with the awkward start at the hostess stand, but who knows. We were 10 minutes late for our reservation (which I called and told them) nothing that should have messed up their service.(3) End of meal. At the end of the meal at two other 3-Michelin star places and another 1-star place we were given a small gift, a token of appreciation for choosing to dine there. For example, at one place we were given a book (fine restaurants of the world) and two others gave us a small gift from the kitchen ""for later"" (e.g. - muffins and granola for tomorrow, late-night macaroons). Daniel, like the other fine dining places gave lots of extras during the meal, but after the check was paid, there wasn't a takeaway. This certainly ISN'T a reason to not dine there, but it was just something we both noticed. When you eat at a few top places you spot similarities and when someone doesn't do something, you notice that too. The food was fabulous and the wine pairings were excellently done. If you're concerned that the three-course won't be enough food, don't be. We both got the three course and left full and happy as clams. The dishes were all excellent. Duo of beef is great and the kitchen really shows how well they can execute on their fish dishes (loved the crispy Japanese snapper). Dessert is divine, albeit I got the cheese plate which made me quite happy.The ambiance -- GORGEOUS. And worth noting, I have no idea how they did it but just as we're finishing up the whole room began smelling of woodfire. It was amazing. Here we are, pleasantly full and it goes all 'warm and cozy' on us -- fab!In the end, I'm glad I went. It was a beautiful way to celebrate my birthday. If I had to choose whether to return here or go to another top place in the city, I'd probably head to one of the other places first.",6,2,1,Laura Y.,"Westport, CT",117,164,0

Reminded me of eastern France.  Similar to Le-Creyes in Reims France.  Simple, very well executed dishes.  OK..............now the bad.......You can tell that Boulud  carries the Bocuse d'Or style. I don't mean that in a good way.  Food that is prepared in a style that, if eventually goes cold before served, goes unnoticed to the untrained eye.  Not me mutherfucker.  I have cash to throw around but i have HIGH expectations.   This place fucking blew it royally.  Its like having a friend setting you up on a blind date and he claims she looks like Mila Kunis, yet she ends up looking like a man. It was a major slap in the face. Food comes out without notice to freshness, many pre made desserts (But.....let me say Boulud did well on dessert, I'm  not a dessert guy although these may be my favorite to-date).  But back to the review. At Daniel you will not get the 3 Michelin star treatment.  100% of the staff was uninterested in myself or my wife.  It was if something else was on their minds.  He dining area was near pitch black and I am convinced it's to hide the unfreshness of the dishes that came out during each course.  Our sommelier was completely confused on deliverance and selection of our wine.  We asked for a couple of bottles that would pair well with the tasting menu.   He brought out a few shit bottles that I'm willing to bet were on there way to the dump.   He did look like a teenager so maybe it was his first day.  It was like drinking supermarket wine/coffee mixture.  Poor poor job Chef Boulud.  You are no way near Grant Achatz, Daniel Patterson, Eric Ripert, Joel Robuchon, Oliver Saucey, chef Redd.  Time to scale down and retry.",4,7,1,Sean H.,"Pompano Beach, FL",14,105,97

5.0,10/16/2012,"If there was ever a special occasion restaurant, Daniel is it. The layout of this restaurant is extremely beautiful. I never saw what the restaurant looked before their recent renovation, but the inside is gorgeous, it might the best dining room in all of NYC. Dress nicely. Don't make plans for after dinner. Be prepared for a long, luxurious meal. Be prepared to feel like royalty. No other restaurant makes you feel like you're on top of the world better than Daniel. Service is one of the best. During the dinner, while drinking, a lime on the lip of the glass fell and it, inexplicably, could not be found. We figured no big deal, move on. Within seconds, a server from thirty feet away swooped in and with tweezers, snatched the lime which was sneakily stuck between my friend's placed fork and knife. He disappeared back to his perch, where he would continue to observe away. Yes, service is insanely good. And the food? Do I really need to describe it? Taste goes without saying. And just like Per Se and Eleven Madison Park specifically, the presentation is so incredibly pleasing to the eye that the thought of disrupting the work of art seems so evil. But I urge you to persist, and devour the damn thing. While savoring, of course.Which takes me to what to order. Do the tasting menu. With the six or eight course tasting, there are two choices for each course. Plan to get one of each so you can sample everything. You do not want to miss a thing here!  Our menu for 08/17/12: - DUCK TERRINE WITH POACHED APRICOT- TASTING OF RABBIT (TERRINE & EN GELEE) - MAINE PEEKYTOE CRAB SALAD WITH WATERMELON- TRIO OF ARCTIC CHAR (HOT SMOKED, CONFIT & TARTARE) - SLOW BAKED JADE TIGER ABALONE WITH CINCO JOTAS- ARUGULA AND LEMON RAVIOLI- OVEN BAKED BLACK SEA BASS WITH SYRAH SAUCE- CANTIMPALO CRUSTED SWORDFISH- ROASTED VEAL TENDERLOIN WITH ARTICHOKE BARIGOULE- DUO OF BEEF (BLACK ANGUS SHORT RIBS & WAGYU TENDERLOIN)- PASSION FRUIT-VANILLA VACHERIN- WARM GUANAJA CHOCOLATE COULANTAt dinner's end, it was an excruciating debate trying to figure out the best dishes. It's nearly possible, as it's deviously wonderful from start to finish. To this day, I'm still trying to figure out my favorite. The wines were outstanding too. It speaks volumes when a restaurant can make you feel like you're the only ones present, yet you're still in a room full of diners. The service, the atmosphere, and the food is second to none. If you're lucky, Chef Daniel Boulud may come out and say hello too. I should note that it wasn't until the final thirty minutes of the meal that we realized our table was across from Stephen Colbert and his wife. Amazingly, the food and service distracted us from star-gazing. But I can tell you this: the Colberts were doing the tasting menu too.",4,0,1,Jeff M.,"Atlanta, GA",59,711,0

Warm freshly baked madeline cookies followed dessert, and then a tray of 8 different truffles came out and they just said take as many as you like. The beef three ways was very tasty, and the braised beef cheeks were unparralelled.My only complaint was that I ate wayyy too much, and could barely move after this meal.It is also quite expensive, but if you have the cash, and are looking for an epic meal in the city, this is it.",3,0,2,Bryan F.,"Brooklyn, NY",80,172,70
4.0,10/8/2012,"We'd been wanting to try a Daniel restaurant for a long time. We were planning our trip to NYC, now's our chance. We were early & had time for a drink in the bar. Lucky for us!!  My hubs ordered a glass of wine but I wanted to try one of their signature cocktails. Mixologist, Evan, asked what I liked.  I gave him some details, he gave that some thought and then made me a drink based on my likes! WOW! I asked Evan what it was called and he asked me my name....Well, I've never had a Robin Cocktail before...tasty!  Vodka, lime, ginger and taragon!!!We were then seated in a BEAUTIFUL dining room, where we sat next to each other, on the same side overlooking the rest of the dining room. Just lovely! We made selections from a pre fixe menu and we enjoyed every single morsel. I had the abalone w/cauliflower and the duo of lamb. My hubs had the mosaic of rabbit and the duo of beef...prepared perfectly. We selected our own bottle of wine, which went well w/our meal but I would do the pairing next time. We had a cheese course for dessert with a glass of Tokaji. AMAZING!I would have gladly given them 5 stars but I just didn't find the service to be warm.  I don't mean they weren't polite...they were overly polite.  Polite is not warm and friendly. They did everything right!  I'm all about the food, I want to touch it, smell it and know everything about it.  I got the feeling they didn't want to spend much time talking about it.  AGAIN, don't get me wrong...they described it!  BUT it lacked passion!!  I guess there's no pleasing me!",0,0,0,Robin G.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",4,55,3

I had a gin basil cocktail, which was nothing I hadn't had before but I was happy they had interesting cocktails. At our table people had things off the vegetarian and non-vegetarian menu,  and all of the non-veg meals were presented as a little autumn landscape. The beauty of each plate was pretty incredible. All of the flavors were individually distinguishable yet worked together. And dessert was insane -  with options for folk who like chocolate and folks who don't. Admittedly, while it's nice that they have a vegetarian menu, if I were vegetarian this place would be an incredible rip off.  It's so expensive that if any one of these things had been out of place, I would have given it 4 stars, but every detail was perfect.",1,1,1,Anjuli S.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,21,0

The dishes were mostly uninspired and boring. Creamed corn with salmon would be something I cook at home, nothing I want to pay a fortune for.

I'm not impressed at all. the monk fish was a big over cooked and the crab was barely even noticeable. Also....where was the salt? i couldnt taste any flavors..monk fish is a fairly light fish that doesnt have much taste. over all it was a very bland dish.Also tried the veal loins, cheeks, and sweet bread. THAT was aweeesomeee. i really wished i ordered something similar. this dish was executed very well and the veal was so tender and the sweet bread didnt have a bad after taste.Desserts were both very good, also they came out wtih homemade truffles. great way to end a meal.over all, i wish i ordered different dishes bc there were def hits and misses throughout the whole night. i think this is a place that can really shine....IF you're lucky enough to order the right stuff.",2,1,1,wenting x.,"New York, NY",93,82,9
5.0,9/15/2012,"So let me preface this review by saying that this meal was THE reason for my coming to the city. I'm a foodie down to the bone and waited months to get a reservation for this place. Service: A++++ We had a main server (who was so attentive) and several other waiters bustling around us during our meal. There was table-side filleting of a fish dish which was executed to perfection. They even brought me a tiny little stool for my clutch so it didn't have to take up space on the table or sit on the floor. I would come back here just for the service but the food is superb as well. Decor: Uber high scale. Dress like you're going to a cocktail party...but pick loose clothes because you will eat a lot.Food: We were looking for the tasting menu but the night we were there, they only had smaller number of courses. When we asked, they said they could make something up on the spot to accomodate our appetites. It was simply marvelous. My friend and I each received a different dish for each course and they some how (magic) predicted our taste preferences. I love lamb and I got a lamb dish while my friend loves bitter flavors and they gave her a dish with duck and frisse. I'm not going to list the dishes here because they're going to be different seasonally and honestly, you should just go and create your own experience.",1,0,0,Yizhou E.,"West Orange, NJ",84,80,40
5.0,9/7/2012,"The best dining experience of my life.Everything from the food, to the atmosphere and the service were en pointe.  I really appreciated the level of detail they put into every little thing, even the hand towels in the bathroom are printed with the logo. The logo is also the pattern of the carpet. If you have a purse, they bring out a little ottoman for it.The food is absolutely delicious and filling, but what really stood out for me was the service. We had three people serving our table. One person to be our main server (take orders, drop food, make sure we were okay), another person to describe our meals to us, and another to make sure our water was always topped up and we always had bread. Every single person was professional and efficient, and most surprisingly: warm. My dining companion and I were expecting somewhat snooty frou-frou service, but our servers were just NICE. They joked with us, got as excited as we did about the food and basically made us feel very very special. When one server escorted me to the bathroom (seriously) another stepped in and chatted with my friend, almost as if to keep her company. While we were eating dessert, our main server came up to us with a huge grin and said ""You are going to be SO HAPPY"" then dropped a basket of freshly baked madeleines on our table. And we were SO HAPPY.My friend and I giggled like idiots throughout dinner, we were so excited. There were so many new flavours and little touches that I enjoyed, too many to name. Even though we are not the type to go to places like this often, the staff made us feel right at home. Even as we giggled and clutched our chests and made weird food noises. Seriously, it felt like my heart stopped several times during our meal, it was so lavish (eating a giant slab of foie gras may have also been a factor). They were really great about my dairy allergy, telling me that whatever I order, they'll make it work (though you may be out of luck if you don't eat butter, which I do).I would DEFINITELY recommend this restaurant to anyone who's up for a full, incredible dining experience. One caveat, you do get what you pay for. Our bill with tax and tip came to about $180 per person, the most I've ever spent on a meal in my life.

Although the food was probably the best tasting food I have ever put into my mouth, I still left hungry after 6 courses and dessert so all you big eaters out there eat dinner before you get the tasting menu at Daniel.

5.0,9/4/2012,"So we went with the 6 course tasting - and it was spectacular.  I consider dining at these restaurants (Le Bernadin, Gramercy Tavern, Gotham Bar & Grill, Union Cafe, etc.)  sort of like running a marathon - you have to try these places at least once.   Why?  Because eating at one of the best restaurants in  NYC , a city known for great restaurants, you can't help but feel like you are fortunate / lucky / on top of the world.  And because if you have never experienced something that is truly among the best the world has to offer, it is a transcendent and memorable experience.  An example is that my wife forgot her reading glasses and couldn't see the menu.  It took the waiter about 30 seconds to notice and return with a box full of reading glasses she could choose from that went from light to heavy... and they looked good, so my wife wore them the whole meal.Would highly recommend the Hudson Valley Sauteed Duck Foie Gras (they let us substitute it even though it wasn't on our 6 course menu), the trio of Arctic Char, the Duo of Suckling Pig, and the Oven Baked Black Sea Bass.  The desserts were also amazing, perfectly balanced sweet and saltiness... hard to describe in words, but they took some things we have all eaten and reworked them so that they were just a notch above anything else we've ever eaten... and yes, the bill was $600 for two (and no we didn't get the wine pairings).  In this case, you get what you pay for.",0,0,1,Patrick K.,"New York, NY",1,56,2

My favorite: they packed some of our complementary chocolate treats and madaleines to go -- and the packaging is so elegant that makes a person think that he/she just bought a treat from La Duree (a famous desert place in Paris).

Felt like the spinach wrap was unnecessary and I did bite into a salt kernel, but otherwise the fish was amazing.Suckling pig - best pork I have had in a restaurant. The skin was savory and crispy and the side of strawberries and turnips paired well with the richness of the meat.Dessert:Kenyan coffee chocolate ganache - sooo smooth.

3.0,8/25/2012,"Food, service and ambiance - all factor in when evaluating a dining experience and this could not have held more true than for my first ever visit to a 3 MIchelin star establishment.  Daniel certainly shined in certain aspects, but fell astonishingly short in others.The interior was, of course, absolutely gorgeous with Roman columns amongst other adornments.  Our meal began at the bar & lounge by the entrance and with cocktails like the complex Smoke & Mirrors, I was beyond impressed.  Resinous flavors of black cardamom came together extraordinarily well with the whisky and Laphroaig 10 year and provided counterweight to the brighter flavors of mint and maraschino cherries.  Similarly, our sommelier, Jesse, brought exceptional vibrant energy and enthusiasm along with some of the best recommendations I've come across yet for wines.  Our group opted for a lighter followed by a bolder red to go with the dishes and my request for the latter was simply something that might match my all-time favorite.  Lo and behold, he returned with a 2004 vintage from Valpolicella that was right up there with the champion.As for the food, the trio of amuse bouche was in a word...lousy.  Tough, overdone octopus, lightly smoked arctic char and some kind of puree that wasn't worth remembering.  Onto the next course.  Appetizers came in several forms with mine from the sea: Slow Baked Jade Tiger Abalone.  It was quite good, however, my friend and I both agreed that the accompanying fried asparagus, ham and zucchini marmalade with avocado were noticeably tastier.In terms of mains, I loved my friend's Duo of Beef - the braised short ribs offered wonderfully fatty yet complex flavors while the seared Wagyu tenderloin's texture was pretty unreal.  My Roasted Veal Tenderloin, while again quite good, paled in comparison.  The sweetbreads on the side were forgettable and I didn't care much at all for the artichoke barigoule.  Another friend's Spinach Wrapped Monfish had a lovely, delicate texture whose flavors couldn't quite come through on the same level.We had an array of desserts ranging that included Roasted Bing Cherries, Strawberry Granite, Warm Chocolate Guanaja Coulant and Kenyan Coffee Ganache.  Being a self-proclaimed chocolate phenom, the coulant was easily my favorite with the cherries also very much worthy of mention.  Very tasty overall, though nothing truly amazing.So in the end, I had an totally awesome time in the company of most excellent friends.  That said, the food was flat out disappointing for 3 lauded Michelin stars.  I've experienced more memorable cuisine at far better value at 1 star and non-Michelin rated restaurants along with warmer, more personable service.  My friend and I commented that we actually lucked out by just going with the 3 course pre-fixe as the tasting menus would've been a painful letdown given the cost.Sorry Chef Boulud, maybe next time.  Or not.",1,0,0,Eric F.,"San Leandro, CA",821,2714,266

Girlfriend just finished taking the brutal brutal bar exam and it was our 6 months so I thought, ""why not zoidberg?!"" dressed up and having her be impressed by my sexiness (not really), we took on Daniel's. As mentioned above, we got the pre-theatre menu that is available only from Monday through Thursday from 5:30-6:00. Cost is $125 per person and it comes with wine pairing!! SO CHEAP! We were tempted to get the regular menu with wine pairing for $168 per person but decided against it as both menus offer very similar entrees. We shall next time though.Service here is impeccable, so well that I didn't know who really was my server. I ended up having to tip them well because I didn't know how the tip was to be managed amongst them all.

The best part? Wine pairings included! The ambiance and service are amazing, and the food, while perhaps not as creative as some other high end restaurants, is crafted perfectly.

1.0,8/14/2012,"Daniel was the only 3-star restaurant in the city I hadn't yet tried, so I decided to take my fiance on a Saturday night in early July. Given it was on a bit of a whim and last minute, we ended up with a reservation in the lounge. From the experience I will detail below I can only say that while the food was good I really hope the primary sitting area has better service. We showed up for our reservation half an hour early, with the idea of sitting at the bar and enjoying some cocktails prior to our meal. Five minutes into our cocktails (and still well before our reservation time) we were asked if we'd like to move to our table, which we declined, indicating we'd like to finish our drinks at the bar. A mere five minutes later - and still well before our reservation - we were yet again prodded to go to our table. We grudgingly conceded and said farewell to the immaculate and well-appointed bar.    We proceeded to the table, ordered the chef's 6-course tasting menu with wine pairings. I then called our waiter to alert him of my fiance's very serious shellfish allergy. Less than 3 minutes later we are delivered a beautiful tower full of shrimp amouz-bouche. I quickly sent it back and reminded our waiter again of her allergy. He assured me that everyone was aware and that it wouldn't happen again.   Over the proceeding courses the entire experience only deteriorated. During the second course, I had my half-full wine glass filled with water, only to be offered a replacement later at the end of the course. At the beginning of the third they brought our meals just as my fiance asked to be shown to the ladies room. They took her to the restroom by the bar, which is visible from the lounge, where she proceeded to wait for literally 20 minutes as the course grew cold. Believe it or not I am not exaggerating. Finally, I called the waiter over and asked him to show her to another restroom and to put the food on warmers. She eventually returned nearly 30 minutes from when she left, describing the scene she found in the second restroom to which she was led: apparently someone had gotten sick and it had yet to be cleaned. The waiter later came over to explain the situation and apologize, but the damage had been done and my fiance's appetite was long gone. We asked for the check and left before dessert.Disappointed with my experience, I called the restaurant the following day and shared my experience with John, who claimed to be the maitre-d at the time. John took down my details, telling me that he would speak with the staff who served us and to expect a call from the general manager within a few days. I never received a call back from anyone. A truly disappointing experience, as I expected more from such a well-respected place. I certainly will not return for either business or pleasure, and encourage others to avoid Daniel.",10,4,3,Mike S.,"New York, NY",0,4,0

3.0,8/11/2012,"Went to Daniel a few months ago with a friend and had the tasting menu. I was pretty underwhelmed. The dining room was extremely elegant and the food was well executed but overall I think it lacks the ""wow"" factor that I expect with tasting menus at 3 star michelin restaurants.The tasting of lettuce (amuse), the pate and the peekytoe crab salad were all good but not exciting. The three main dishes - the lobster, the turbot and the trio of beef were again good but not exciting at all. The only interesting/exciting part of the entrees were that the turbot had a few drops of premium aged balsamic. Overall I have to say that the food at Daniel was simply good, but after trying the tasting menu I still didn't have any memorable dishes, which is disappointing given the caliber of the restaurant.",1,0,0,Derrick C.,"Princeton, NJ",30,24,4

4.0,8/5/2012,"We came here on a Saturday night for an early dinner at 545.   My expectations were high knowing this is a three star Michelin restaurant.  When we entered the restaurant it was already about half full.  The ambiance was elegant and classy with men in suits and women in dresses.  The service was formal but still friendly and not intrusive.  Water was filled the whole time and it's hard to keep up with me.  We both opted for 3 course prix fixe.  We were offered amuse bouche of tasting of melons, and they were refreshing way to start off the meal.  The bread service was fantastic and I loved the olive and whole wheat bread!!  Crusty on the outside and soft and flavorful on the inside- the way all bread should be.For appetizers we had the rice flake crusted scallops and tasting of rabbit.  The portion of my scallops was generous with three jumbo scallops that are cooked to perfection.  For mains we had squab and duo of beef.  My squab was good and cooked and seasoned perfectly, but I found the overall dish just ok.  It had too many components on the plate and not too sure how everything went together.  But oh my gosh the duo of beef was fantastic.  Now I never order beef on the menu but that dish alone would make me a convert.  Tender, moist, flavorful... All those things and more.  For dessert we had warm Guanaja coulant and passion fruit vanilla vacharin.  They were both delicious and the dinner was finished off perfectly with petit fours and freshly baked madelines.Fantastic meal and perfect restaurant for a special occasion.",4,2,1,JiaJia T.,"Hauppauge, NY",436,408,610

5.0,7/31/2012,"One of the best French restaurants I've been to so far. Beautiful presentations, outstanding service, and delicious food. I ordered the rice-cake crusted sea scallops for appetizer, suckling pig for main, and passion fruit -vanilla vacherin for dessert. My husband had the foie gras for appetizer, duo of beef for main, and the same for dessert. I must say that although the sea scallops were excellent, they just couldn't compare to the foie gras; the foie gras completely melted in my mouth and was one of the best I've had. The suckling pig was also excellent; super tender pork chop with the perfect fat around and the crispy skin on the pork was my favorite.  But my husband's dish outdone mine again; the braised short ribs was full of flavors and very moist, loved it. And of course, the Wagyu Tenderloin was cooked to perfection. As for the passion fruit dessert, it was the perfect thing to end our meal with on a hot summer night; it wasn't too too sweet and very refreshing. As for the service here, everything is so synchronized; they synchronize when they bring you the dishes and synchronize when they take dishes away. Setting is dimmed lighting and quiet. The waiters/waitresses are knowledgeable, friendly and attentive. Good enough for me..Overall, a great dining experience. But you have to understand that this is after all a French restaurant, so tiny portions should be expected. You do, however, leave full because they would offer you complimentary bread (excellent baguette), and mini desserts such as madeleines, macrons and cakes.

2.0,7/30/2012,"Let me preface by saying Daniel is obviously NOT a 2 star restaurant.  My wife and I are vegetarian, and we have NOT eaten Per Se or Eleven Madison Park.  Our basis for comparison is Michael Smith in Kansas City, CityZen in Washington DC, and Volt in Frederick, Maryland.  My wife and I went to celebrate my birthday this past weekend.  When visiting a 3 Michelin star restaurant, one's expectations are naturally high.  However, our friends had been the night before and they tempered our expectations as they weren't overly impressed.  Nonetheless, we were expecting the meal to be at least on par with the restaurants mentioned above.  We opted for the 6 course vegetarian tasting menu (there were 2 options for each course, which my wife and I split).  The first two courses were below average to average, but passable.  The third course was absolutely awful.  My wife got a fennel dish (I usually enjoy fennel) and I got a plate of vegetables that I can only describe like this:  Have you ever been to a steak house and asked for the vegetarian course?  The usual response is a variety of steamed vegetables and some boiled pasta.  If you're lucky there's a little bit of salt seasoning.  Neither of us finished this course and the waitstaff could clearly tell our displeasure up to this point.  They apologized and provided us a wild rice substitute which was above average.  Courses 4 and 6 were both above average, while 5 was actually good (Corn dish).  The deserts were all fantastic, as were the cocktails and wine.  At the end of the meal, my wife and I obviously left a little disappointed.  Although the service was phenomenal, ambiance excellent, the food just left something to be desired.  When comparing our meals with the other high end restaurants our ranking would go like this: Michael Smith/Volt 1 and 1a (note Michale Smith doesn't normally have a vegetarian tasting menu, but they provided us the best meal of our lives when we asked them ahead of time for one).  CityZen would be next and we were both ambivalent about it.  Daniel was a distant 4th.  The reason for the 2 star review?  Simple, based on the pricing and food, I would never say that I would go back.  Moreover, I could never recommend to a friend to go try it either.  There are far better ways to spend your money on food in New York and elsewhere!ps- for everything, I will say that the service we received at Daniel may have been the best we have received at any restaurant.",9,1,2,Kartik K.,"Houston, TX",84,52,3

4.0,6/30/2012,"Here's to another review joining the lines of other hundreds already existing on here! To be honest, Daniel was my first time lavishly dining at a restaurant such as this. We arrived 10 min or so after our scheduled reservation, but that was no issue at all. They sat us down at the most awkward couch against the wall seating so my friend and I would basically be eating right next to each other. We requested a table change and they happily obliged and sat us by the upper level/balcony thingy. The only thing was that it was right next to the kitchen/serving area so that is my minimal complaint. Otherwise, we ordered two of the tasting menus and each dish was so intricately prepared. In between it all, we got a few additional dishes as well. I wasn't completely stuffed to the point where I couldn't move, but I was pretty full to a decent extent. Got a picture of the world renowned Chef Daniel, just wish he moved around talking to the customers more. I was in awe of how well the waiters served the diners. Every little bread crumb, spill, etc. went unnoticed and they took care of it without making us feel overwhelmed. I had my Kate Spade bag on the floor, but they immediately bought this little cushioned cube chair and put it on top for me. Our main server even asked us what the occasion was and we had said just friends catching up after a year. At the end of our amazing meal, he presented us with the most wonderful coffee dessert with ""Happy Anniversary"" spelled our in chocolate drizzle. He exclaimed that even friendship should be an anniversary. So precious! They even led me to the restroom when I asked where it was located. Another thing why it isn't a full 5 stars for me is that 1.) I couldn't even understand/hear the descriptions of each dish when they were presented in front of us because of the server's accent/speaking pace, and 2.) Portions could have been bigger. Even though it is pricey, I didn't expect anything less after hearing the extraordinary reviews. So attentive to details...definitely will be returning.",0,0,0,Samantha W.,"New York, NY",270,259,145

5.0,6/14/2012,"Just about everyone will admit that the food is amazing here, but I want to point out a couple things that really puts Daniel over the top and almost could justify our huge bill.#1 The Chef: Daniel spent A LOT of time out with his customers.  Now, he did spend some significant time at one table with some flirty ladies, but never the less he was making his rounds.  We received a quick hello which was good enough for me.  Maybe if I wasn't around Lissa G would have had a nice 30 minute conversation about what she was doing after dinner  ; )#2 The Cocktails:  These were some of the most innovative cocktails I have ever seen. The one that stands out was a fruit based drink inside a globe of hollowed out ice - brilliant!#3 The Room: Another notable, again besides the amazing food, was the room.  I loved the layout and the over the top decor.  Make sure to get a seat around the outer section so you have a great view of the entire room.Make sure to go for the food, but don't miss out on the extras that puts Daniel in a class of few restaurants.",3,4,3,Jim G.,"West Hills, Los Angeles, CA",540,662,163

This was my parent's second time there and my first, so our reactions to the ambience and food were quite different. Now allow me to begin.When you walk in, you feel like you are instantly transported to some old school European palace. The entrance and bar area are quite quaint, but fascinatingly designed. After waiting for maybe 15 minutes and pounding back a few jamies & ging, we went into the extraordinary dining hall. Once again, the design- exquisite.I'll just go bullet point style from here on out:Food- Pretty great. Amazing array of meats, fishes, and flavors that really party in your mouth. When you get the plate, you think ""dude there's no way this is filling me."" Let me tell you, the food is so rich, i was actually so full that I almost got sick.Service- 1. Asked the wine guy what he recommends (nothing too sweet), he comes back with the perfect bottle2. My girlfriend hates seafood. We briefly joked with her about this while she was ordering. Who would have guessed that the waitress overheard and substituted all seafood pieces with fresh fruit....for all of her meals. OutstandingDrinks- Noted before, the wine guy made the perfect suggestion, A++Cost- For being so highly rated on the Michelin scale, this place is actually pretty affordable.

4.0,6/4/2012,"Another New York restaurant checked off my list.The minute I walked into Daniel I was blown away by the vases and vases of peonies sitting against the back wall! It was such a gorgeous sight to look at while eating.  The table and I decided to go with the three course prix fixe option. I started with the Scottish Langoustine gelee with sea urchin custard, caviar, and avocado mousse. I'm not a fan of urchin but when I'm at top rated restaurants I tend to order dishes that makes me feel uncomfortable just to see if the chef can make me love something I hate. To my surprise (not really) I loved the langoustine with urchin custard. I very much enjoyed how richness of the urchin custard was balanced out by the softness and light taste of the avocado mousse.  Yes, the langoustine was the bolded section on the menu but I think that urchin took the spot light. I also took a bite of someone's foie and it was amazing! Again, I am not a fan of foie because it's too rich for me. The foie was paired with fruit which cut through the rich fatty taste and created a spoonful of heaven. For my entrée I had the Roasted Liberty Duck Breast and it was absolutely tender and made me begging for more. The duck breast was well prepared and the overall dish was well executed. I ended the meal with something that caught my eye and sounded very peculiar. It was strawberry granite with Szechuan Pepper Sorbet. Not what I had expected from Daniel but I was happy with what I had ordered. The Szechuan Pepper Sorbet was delicious. The sorbet had a hint of Szechuan Peppery-ness and I think because of that it was very refreshing and a great palate cleanser. The meal was excellent and of course service was superb.

From the greeting after entering through their elegant entryway to being seated and served by a multitude of hospitable staff members, it was an evening to remember. New and interesting dishes that I have never tried, but impressed me immensely included the veal pâté. A wonderful starter to the night. The middle would require a few pages to describe so I'll go straight to the finish - smooth and creamy espresso beverages with a raspberry almond biscuit cake with multiple layers of delicious inclusions, each more flavorful than the previous. The sorbets and fresh fruit accompaniments are not to be forgotten, either.To sum up my review - highly recommended.A P.S. to add: There was a waiting assistant who took my passing interest in the artwork to the next level by going through several staff and the designer of the restaurant after we left to find out the name of the artist and then mailed me all of the information he had discovered.

LOL)... but I must say this has always been the BEST of the BEST.Food, Service, everything comes into perfect harmony and they really work (they make it seem so EFFORTLESS)..... everything is SPOT ON. detailed to the ""T"". Absolutely AMAZING experience every time.I must note though the first time I ate here.... I took my friends that just got married to celebrate.... and us being a little younger than the other patrons there (mid 20s)... I am not sure if that was the reason why but it seemed as though service was not up to par as say the later two times that I dined there.  They seemed to give off the ""you guys don't belong here attitude... when we were dressed VERY professional and classy just as the other diners. This happened once though, but I was too excited about the food to even care as much about the service. I will keep coming back again and again. PS. Theater special is amazing, mon-thurs.... and it includes the wine pairing. Great deal.",2,0,0,Yoshi M.,"New York, NY",320,102,60

5.0,5/23/2012,"I was here last Saturday for 6pm dinner. It was all they had available reserving 30 days in advance 2 hours after reservation lines had opened. Men have to wear jackets so it's that kind of place. It's my first time at a 3 star Michelin restaurant and excited to see what the fuss is all about. It's definitely amazing but some 1 star Michelin restaurants are not far behind like Gramercy Tavern.We started off with a cocktail which were amazing! Then had the 6 course tasting menu with wine pairing. Notable dishes were the foie gras terrine, salmon smoked in some wood wrappings and caviar even though I don't care for caviar. The service was great. For being a stuffy place the staff were all down to Earth.The only complaints I had were the servings were small even for the main dishes. I walked out just satisfied. Not overly stuffed after spending $850 for two people. I kinda want to walk out a little uncomfortably full. The bathrooms were downstairs which also kinda sucks when your tipsy. Not all the wine pairings were on point. Some were a little too sweet.The cool thing is Mr. Boulud comes out to check on his guests. It's his flagship restaurant and lives upstairs.So I guess this is really 4.5 stars.",0,0,0,Joe S.,"Manhattan, NY",24,32,1

5.0,5/15/2012,"BEST MEAL EVERI don't bandy that about lightly, and I can say unequivocally that no other meal comes close.  I hardly know where to begin.First, if you are vegetarian, there is absolutely no restaurant in the world that is better.  I've been to the best in London, and what I thought were the best in New York, but Daniel kicks their respective asses and sends them back to the kitchen.  Even the most expensive pure veg restaurants can't touch his food and presentation, or the impeccable service.  Our reservation was the last available for the weekend, even though we made it several weeks in advance.  It was 10:15 for the lounge, which is 7:15 Phoenix time, so it was perfect for us.  We sat down to wait for our table in the beautiful bar area, and after a glass of wine we were told that a table had just opened in the main dining room, so we jumped at the opportunity.  They offered me a jacket from their coat check, which fit perfect, and off we went.I've been to many nice restaurants where the servers were snotty and rude, so I never really know what to expect.  Daniel was recently rated as the #15 restaurant in the world, so I was prepared to be insulted with my long, crazy hair and being the only person in the room without a white or cream-colored shirt.  Happily, this was far from the case. Not only was the food the best we've ever had, so was the service.  Giovanni and Minor were our primary servers, and their sincere loveliness was absolutely appreciated.  We were celebrating our fifth anniversary, and they made it a truly amazing experience.  Every person on the staff was fantastic, all the way from the coat-check to the table.  I had alerted the staff about my wife's allergy to walnuts and strawberries when making the reservation, and they almost immediately asked about her allergies upon reaching our table and assured us that all precautions would be taken.  I love that!    I suggest you work out before visiting Daniel, at least if you plan to handle the wine list.  I swear the list weighs at least five pounds.  It was like looking through the War and Peace of wine lists.  If they don't have it, then either you were looking for an Italian wine or something that sells at Trader Joe's.  We chose a white wine from Liguria, which was one of only about six wines from Italy, since it was where we spent our honeymoon and our memories of the trip are some of the best of our lives.Here, vegetarians are not relegated to the periphery of the menu and are, in fact,  given an entire menu of their own, which I find refreshing and simply fantastic.  I felt respected instead of being treated as a culinary annoyance like in so many restaurants who generally serve some kind of punishment dish, like a forgettable risotto (I'm talking to you, Different Pointe of View in Phoenix).  They started our meal with a selection of small vegetable plates, which were beautiful and exploded with taste.  Morel mushrooms are in season, which was an incredible stroke of luck, since morels are the caviar of mushrooms--rare, expensive and unparalleled.  It was the finest preparation of morels known to man, which means they didn't try to manipulate them too much, but massaged them to bring out the utmost flavor.I had the fava bean and hedgehog mushroom fricassee for my appetizer, and my wife sampled the pomme duchesse with stuffed morels.  I've never eaten any dish more slowly to try and relish ever delicious moment.For our main course we had the stuffed satur farm leeks and the mousseron and Swiss chard ravioli.  For dessert, the chocolate coulant and the rhubarb.  The coulant was the weakest part of the meal, but saying it was the weakest is not an insult, but only says that the rest of the meal was so extraordinary.After the normal dessert we were given the Kenyan Coffee Ganache, as an anniversary gift, and it had ""Happy Anniversary"" written in chocolate.  So lovely, and it more than made up for my very slight disappointment with the coulant.  This night will be remembered forever, and that's what fine dining is all about.  To Daniel and staff: thank you!",1,0,1,James S.,"Phoenix, AZ",9,115,0

Blah.Party: 2 PeopleAtmosphere: Romantic, ClassyFood/Drink: Started off with a Champagne Mojito, which was great. It was the perfect mixture of alcohol and bubbly. For our food, we did the 3 course meal. As an appetizer, we had the Foie Gras and the Duck Terrine with Marcona Almond. Both were extremely good. This was probably the best Foie Gras I've ever had. It completely melts in your mouth. The Duck Terrine was accompanied with this perfectly crispy bread to dip in with the sauce. Of course, didn't disappoint either.Our main course, I ordered the Duo of Beef, which included Braised Black Angus Short Ribs, Seared Wag Tenderloin, and a Crispy Rosemary Polenta. Of those 3, the Short Ribs was cooked the best. It was perfectly tender, but still flaky with the right proportion of sauce. Yum Yum Yum.For the dessert, the Warm Guanaja Chocolate Coulant came HIGHLY recommended, which did not disappoint. It was basically a much better version of a chocolate lava cake. It came with a side of Milk Sorbet, but I only wish they gave more sorbet to eat simultaneously with the rich chocolate. Halfway through my chocolate cake, I realized I didn't have anything creamy to balance it out with.Service: WonderfulOverall: A definite must try at some point for a fine dining experience.

I have the 6 course vegetarian menu and asked the waiter to surprise me with what he thought I would like. I wanted to be WOWed and surprised and I wanted to try thing I never had before! He promised no disappointment I certainly was not disappointed! I would fly to NYC for this restaurant! In fact I would use almost any excuse to fly over to NYC (from the West coast) to dine here!

2.0,4/25/2012,"I don't get it.  I know that, as a somewhat poor teacher on a budget, four star restaurants are never gonna be my thing.  But my boyfriend is an acclaimed chef, and I'm a former farmer and foodie, and have had hundreds of delightful and memorable meals in my life - fancy and not.  This wasn't one of them.  We went because my boyfriend had a $500 gift certificate.  We ended up spending $200 on top of that.  And we both thought there was nothing extraordinary.  We both got the 6 course tasting menu - and he got the paired wines.Bonus points for letting us substitute and mix and match items from all over the menu.  We loved that.My romaine heart starter, the syrah sauce with the leeks, and his rhubarb desserts were the highlights.  ESPECIALLY the rhubarb dessert!!! Amazing. But most other things, while beautifully plated and impressively served, just didn't TASTE as good as so many other meals I've had, at much less stuffy restaurants.MOST offensive was that the staff seemed to be pushing us out of the restaurant.  We were there maybe a bit less than 3 hours.  They dropped the bill while we were in the middle of coffee, without asking if we wanted an after dinner drink, or anything else.  AND, they PICKED UP THE BILL once we'd added the tip, from almost under my boyfriend's arm, about a minute after he'd put his pen down.  While we were STILL drinking coffee/wine.  This really pissed me off.  And made us feel like we weren't important enough to be there, lay people that we are.  :(  Not cool at a four star restaurant.Probably my most expensive meal out, ever, and I would have MUCH MUCH preferred to have 6 lovely, unpretentious dinners at Brooklyn and Manhattan restaurants.  Where stuff tastes better, and snobbery is minimal.If you're going to go 4 star, I'd head to 11 madison or per se, where I can't afford to go but I've heard live up to the hype.  Unlike this place.",6,1,5,Jenny K.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,20,0
2.0,4/23/2012,"Will preface this review by saying that I prefer heavy spicy flavors which I know French cuisine is NOT known for.  Took my girlfriend here for her birthday. Forgot which appetizer I had but did have the beef duo for an entree. Let me first say that I picked that thinking it would be sufficient amount of food based on the name as well as the price. Well, they brought me a plate with 3 pieces of hor dourves sized pieces. WTF? Since when did duo mean 3? Why was the entree smaller than my appetizer? Anyway, to make a long story short, I dropped over $500 for a dinner for 2 and finished the night eating a $4 gyro from the stand outside my building. I am done with French food. I question how/why the world is obsessed with this cuisine.",7,11,3,Steve L.,"Bedford, NY",9,39,1
4.0,4/21/2012,"This place lived up to our expectations for the most part. I'll start with the good and bad...we had gotten the 3 course prix-fixe and loved each and every dish except for the Duck Terraine. It was bland and tasteless...they were too damn concentrated on the plating and presentation! If you love fatty liver that is derived from duck or goose through forced-feeding corn and grains then this is the right choice for you. As for my wife and I, we were not fans. I had ordered a Cotes de Castillion Bordeaux for the table and we loved every drop as it paired perfectly with the food, just what the Sommelier had promised. However, my glass remained empty several times yet it was being filled unnecessarily when there was already a sufficient amount in there! Now for the great...the taste of that mouth watering ""Biriyani Masala"" Lobster will remain with me until the end of time. The lobster was fresh and full of flavor. There was a hint of Indian flavor in this dish and this was quite interesting as I grew up eating foods with Indian spices and herbs. My ""Shrimp Crusted"" Halibut was not what I expected as there was only 2 pieces of that crisp shrimp yumminess on top of my filet of halibut. It was a light and delicious entree but did not live up to it's name unfortunately. As for the dish that captivated both of us was the Duo of Beef. There was 2 cuts of the beef, one moist and tender and the other similar to sirloin. The flavoring of this dish accompanied by the red wine was memorable. Desserts were both delicious....the Coulaine was classically made and my Passion Fruit Sorbet was light and airy.

If you go between 5:30-6 on Monday-Thursday, you get a special pre theater menu that is only $125 for three courses with wine pairings. Basically you get three free glasses of amazing wine. And it's not really three courses either - the amuse bouche was so beautiful that I could hardly force myself to eat it, but it had a tiny piece of bacon so I had to try, and each of the three little dishes was delicious and very interesting.Then we had our appetizer (peeky toe crab - tasted pretty good but the presentation was really cool), entree (black sea bass - so tender and loved the hash brown-ish potatoes), and dessert (passion fruit/mango/vanilla amazingness). But after that we got a basket of madeleines. After that we got a plate of various chocolates and macarons. Then he put more plates in front of us and we protested that we were WAY too full for anymore, and he said not to worry and put the TINIEST, prettiest little chocolates in front of us. We were served many more plates than listed on the prix fixe menu.Did I mention they also sent out a special strawberry dessert with ""congratulations"" written in syrup because I recently got engaged?The service was absolutely impeccable.

We had the 3 course dinner with complementary champagne and dessert (thanks to a lovely friend who works here). Before our actual meal they brought us 2 small tasting platters.The quail egg was the best part. In between each course the bread guy would also come and offer us a different bread selection to pair with our food. I had the duo of beef for my main and my bf had the pork chop. Both were soooo tender and juicy amazingggg. Best part of the night was the dessert hands down some of the best we ever had. 2 drinks and a coffee later along with tiny chocolate squares towards the end of the night... we left your 3 hr dining experience full, satisfied, happy, overwhelmed, and giggly.

3.0,3/2/2012,"Daniel is great if you're beautiful or look like you have a lot of money.  But if you're two middle-aged chubby girls from the Midwest, be prepared to be treated horribly by the waitstaff.  The food was great, but I'd never return.    We'd made a reservation and dressed nicely in dresses and heels. We weren't in Prada or Chanel. We were immediately whisked next to the waiter's station, where we spent the evening listening to the waiters make fun of the diners.  Did you know you ate with the wrong fork? That you ordered that cheap wine with the truffle menu? Yeah, we heard about it all night.    My friend was dying to try the truffle menu, and the waiter mentioned several times that it cost more. WE KNOW.  It's right there!  Then she ordered a $40 glass of wine. He leaned over and pointed to the price and asked if she was sure.      I can read, she said.     The food itself was great. I don't even really remember what I had because I just wanted to curl into a small ball of humiliation.      I realize that this is a destination restaurant, but there are many of them in New York.  Go elsewhere.",6,4,0,Dawn F.,"Philadelphia, PA",5,54,0
5.0,3/2/2012,"Great Food.  Great Service.  Great for romantic celebrations.  Aside from the tasting menu, Daniel offers a 3 course Prix Fixe meal for $105.  Everything we ordered was delicious.  I had the crab salad with hearts of palm as an appetizer, the suckling pig for the main course, and the chocolate coulant for dessert. I was going to write a cheesy line about how this is ""Fine Dining"" at a its best, but it occurred to me that I don't have much experience to compare Daniel to.  What I do know is that as soon as we walked in the door, I felt like I was worth a million bucks.  From the coat check to the concierge to the wait staff -everyone was so welcoming and thoughtful. The server, seeing I was pregnant asked if there any dietary restrictions that they should know of before we started our meal.  He adjusted the amuse bouche (smoked fluke) with a cooked substitution that I enjoyed very much. Honorable Mention goes to the Suckling Pig Entree- as it was basically a sampling from the best part of the pig.  It's a pork chop, pork belly, fried pork skin, and bacon.  And before you make a face saying that it sounds way too gluttonous and gross- I have to say that the small portion and presentation really refined the dish.  It was just enough of everything without being too much! Aside from our ordered desserts (I HIGHLY recommend the Chocolate Coulant), we were also brought a complimentary dessert to celebrate our pregnancy, a small dish of tiny chocolates and other candy, and a basket of freshly baked madelines!  To top the perfect evening off, our server handed me small wrapped gift as we left and patted me on the back with a ""Congratulations"".  When I opened it a few moments later, it was a Daniel baby bib!  So thoughtful and so unique! Maybe it was my hormones, but I got a little teary when I opened it.  Such a nice gesture.",1,0,0,Danielle C.,"Jersey City, NJ",103,189,14

4.0,2/26/2012,"If I were rating Restaurant Daniel as theater it would definitely receive 5 stars. The room is beautiful and the service is perfectly choreographed. But, I rate restaurants based on the food and the total dining experience which in my opinion only reached a 4 star level. My criticisms are few: table not ready upon our arrival, appetizer of seared fois gras served at room temperature, bread server not attentive, butter not replenished. But these are minor quibbles. I guess the major disappointment was that nothing we ate sang to me. Everything was delicious, but nothing was ethereal. Nothing we ate created a special moment.So, perhaps I was looking for an unattainable perfection. Daniel is certainly not perfect, but it did come close. One additional point. I was pleasantly surprised when the bill came. Very good value for money.",0,0,0,Walter M.,"Melville, NY",33,207,5
5.0,2/24/2012,"Great place!! Like I said before in many of my reviews, I'm a man who doesn't mind paying for service. Usually, I'm not very concerned about how satisfying the food is, I'll give the restaurant a pretty high rating as long as it presents me with top-knotch waitering. And Daniel has done that with its impeccable presentations. We all had the 3-Course Pre Fixe but with 3 more complimentary dishes from the restaurant itself.For appetizers, we had the Scallop, Foie Gras, and Spinach Raviolini. I didn't really like neither the Foie Gras and the scallop. I thought the Foie Gras was a little bit too cold and the scallop tasted a little bit ordinary... They were both presented extremely well though. I also thought that the entrees' portions (although very delicious) were too small! My dad ordered this steak even with $21 supplement and the steak was just this tiny piece of meat lol. I will give Daniel 5 stars because the service was really, flawless. But I still feel it'd be more worth it to eat at Jean George or 11 Madison.

3.0,2/13/2012,"To dine at Daniel is the tale of two dinners.  If you are a VIP, and roughly 30-50% of the dining room are folks that come here on a regular basis and drop some major moolah, then life is good.  They receive better ingredients *, are treated to table side service, and they get a personal visit from Monsieur Boulud if he's in the restaurant.  They'll theatrically decant your wine and they'll give your limo driver a lavish steak dinner in a to-go box.  If it's your first time here, they'll do none of the above.  They even won't offer to wheel over the cheese cart.   Why am I telling you this?  Because Daniel is an amazing experience for those that can afford it on a regular basis.  For those that can't, you may be better off dropping your $500 on dinner for two at Eleven Madison Park or Per Se - restaurants that always wow in big ways.Daniel doesn't wow, although I may be jaded by one too many great dinners in NYC.  The dishes are immaculately plated and presented, the flavors are the definition of refinement, the service is impeccable, and the dining room is awe inspiring.  But why then, did I wish I were eating at another restaurant?During an exquisite dish of duck terrine, lavished with foie gras (accompanied by Honeycrisp Apple Confit, Sauternes Glazed Date, Mâche Salad, Hazelnut-Cider Vinaigrette), I reminisced about the shaved foie gras dish at Momofoku Ko, a dish more exciting and far more memorable.  In turn, a single plump diver sea scallop (with Celery Mousseline and Bottarga Vinaigrette) made me pine for the awesome scallops with gribenes at Tenpenny.  A dish of beautifully plated  veal over polenta (Poached Cheeks with Parsley Pasta, Crispy Sweetbreads with Hedgehog Mushroom and Crosnes) made me ache for the sweetbread at Apiary.  A similar story for the peekytoe crab salad (Hearts of Palm, Finger Lime, Pickled Chayote, Red Ribbon Sorrel), where which made me crave the peekytoe salads enjoyed at ABC Kitchen and Perilla. For the 99%, it isn't possible to nurture a relationship with Daniel, and in my opinion, at this price point, a one-time special dinner here should be a fireworks display of amazement and delight.  Instead, this ceremony of dining is a restrained and overpriced emblem to haute cuisine - a highbrow reflection of the everyday restaurants that make New York City's dining scene so amazing.* Seriously.  I was chatting with a former cook, who informed me that they have separate ingredient bins for VIPs and regular customers",32,5,12,Chris H.,Hong Kong,170,603,2140
5.0,2/11/2012,"Chef Daniel - you rock!This place deserves every Michelin star restaurant it received.  Magnificent food; lovely ambience; and very attentive service.I need not add to all of the kudos already given here, but I can say a couple of things that I think are helpful:1) Go for the red meat here, not the fish.  Chef Daniel is too skilled for you to waste his talents on anything but game or red meat.2) If anything braised is on the menu, get it!  The braised veal we had here was really magnificent - no puffery intended!3) If you are ordering just the normal prix fixe, look to see what is also on the tasting menu, and go for those items.4) Save room for dessert.  No really - please do yourself a favor.5) Like a true French restaurant, if you speak French, you might get some freebies.  My wife speaks it fluently, and we got an extra dessert on the house along with a free book.  (Well, maybe it helped that my wife is a babe too.)Lastly, the standard prix fixe here is actually a ton of food, although it might not look so initially because of the small portions and the ""three courses"" are really just appetizer + main course + dessert.  They give you ample amuse bouches here, and the portions are really quite filling once they hit your stomach.  (Btw, the celery themed amuse bouches we had here far exceeded my expectations, especially since I don't like celery all that much.)This meal will definitely be worth your money.  Definitely one of the best meals we had in NYC.",1,1,3,Mark M.,"San Francisco, CA",285,721,13
2.0,2/11/2012,"Move over Daniel, you've now got competition. We were super excited to go to Daniel after great experiences at db bistro, admittedly less upscale but damn good. We had a 9:15pm reservation and honestly the dishes did not wow us. Service is to be expected, felt very french/Parisian (ie, met expectations but not especially friendly, slightly buttoned up, which is nice for some people). What I really liked was an appetizer with carrot vinaigrette. The suckling pig was way too dry, the slow-baked fish seemed a bit over heated and they went overboard on complimentary dessert (petite 6 but only one of each kind which is unusual, followed by selection of teeny cute chocolates, and yum fresh-baked madeleines). I prefer a solid meal/entree experience rather than being showered with sweets at the end. The decor and ambiance was nice...high ceilings, nice lighting (not too dark), and good space between tables.For a renowned 3-star, Daniel was below par. You wanna leave a place like than ecstatic.

Getting that out of the way...Had a lovely evening at Daniel, celebrating our wedding anniversary (we celebrated for a few nights, but this was the actual anniversary evening) and enjoying the ambience and food.  As many have said, the room is divine: lavish, tasteful, beautifully lit, etc.  We spent some time in the lounge/bar first and enjoyed the innovative and interesting cocktails.  While I can't recall the name, my drink was served inside (what looked like) a hand-blown globe of ice, with a little tunnel for the straw to come out of.  The ice was placed inside the glass and also had a fresh flower 'frozen' inside it.  As the ice melted, the essence of the flower emerged. What a fun concept! Other drinks at other tables looked similarly interesting.The food is wonderfully prepared with pristine ingredients.  Enjoyed the tasting menu with the wine pairing. Food changes frequently, so no need to give a run down of what we ate.  I will say that our server was of the opinion that if we ran out of wine while still enjoying the dish, then we must be in need of more wine! We didn't realize this until about halfway through the meal; it was good to know!  Service was impeccable; it was especially enjoyable to be sitting atop a balcony of sorts, overlooking the entire room.  It was from here that I watched Chef Daniel sit at a table, chatting up two women for well over 30 minutes! I just wanted to say hello! As the chef walked by us, back into the kitchen, we implored our server to get him to come by, just for a moment! He had been stopping by tables earlier in the evening, prior to his long delay at the one table.  Finally, he did make his way to our table.  By this time, it's near midnight and he didn't seem all that interested, honestly, in talking to us.  We complimented him and his food, mentioned how wonderful everything was all evening, and even said that we had just went to Le Bernardin the night before and found his restaurant to be superior (which is true); he seemed disinterested.  That was a bit disappointing, but, oh well, we still got a chance to say hello!Overall, our evening was delightful, the food was exquisite, and the service was outstanding.  I will say that this was easily our most expensive meal in NYC.  No surprises, of course, but that might stop me from going back.

Perfectly seared.  Although I can make an argument that I've had an amazing $15 foie gras and kobe beef slider in the past at an upscale bar in Baltimore called Salt, that equaled the preparation of the foie gras I had at Daniel.Black Sea Bass with Pommes Dauphine, Leeks and Syrah Sauce:  (Outstanding)Truly amazing dish.  Fish cooked perfectly, amazing texture, sauce accompaniment and flavors awesome.  Duo of Beef: (Great)Perhaps it was because my wife had to have the beef well done since she was pregnant.  Nonetheless, we've had better braised short ribs in the past.  Sauce was excellent however.Warm Guanaja Chocolate Coulant: (Outstanding)Chocolate Heaven.  Enough said.Kenyan Coffee Ganache: (Outsanding)Dark chocolate, coffee ice cream and rice crispy.  Great combination of flavors and texture.OK... we both LOVE chocolate... but who doesn't?Overall Experience: (Excellent)I would probably give it a 4.5/5 if I can.  We will be back.",2,1,0,Simon R.,"Palisades Park, NJ",2,31,1
5.0,1/7/2012,"Daniel was the best French cuisine i've ever had. The wait staff was courteous and knowledgable, and all French! The appetizer (scallops) and main course (suckling pig) were to die for. The meal was wonderful beyond any expectation. But then came dessert.Oh. My. Word.Upon the advice of one of our waiters, I ordered a pear dessert, as my husband was ordering chocolate and I love variety. It was simply divine. Just when I was finishing, we were brought hot, fresh mini madeleines that simply melted in your mouth. THEN we were brought mini chocolates with various fillings, THEN some petit fours! I died and went to dessert heaven. I floated out of Daniel on a cloud, and dreamed of madeleines all night long.

5.0,1/2/2012,"Came here for diner and we tried their Christmas tasting menu (4 courses).  A little more expensive than their regular menu but definitely worth it.As you first walk into the restaurant, coat check in is to your left, bar is in front of you down the steps.  You walk through the bar/waiting area to reach the front desk.  It's very elegantly decorated and while you wait, they gave you bread sticks wrapped around olives.  It was was pretty good, but I don't like olives that much. For the amuse-bouche - they gave us potato done 3 ways.  All I remember was eating it from the left to right and that was the perfect way because if you had done it any other way, the aftertaste would have lingered on your palate and ruined the next bite.For 1st course - we had the Duck Terrine with marcona almond and Dodge Cove Oysters in sea water gelee.  Out of these 2 courses, the ouster dish was the BEST!!  The sea urchin was sweet and both the oysters and the sea urchin did not have a gritty taste to them.  Perfectly clean!!  For me, this was by the far the best dish, mainly because the sea urchin was sweet.  Very hard to find good quality sea urchin cleaned/prepared well.  The Duck Terrine, which is similar to pâté, I didn't like the texture as much.  Reminded me of liver paste.  I also wished the duck flavor was stronger. The Consommé en Croûte was delicious.  The soup was very heart and a strong flavor profile.  The pastry was so light and delicate.  It rose very well and when you poked it with your fork, it ""popped"" and ""deflated"", it was a perfect ""souffle"".  Excellent technical skills.For the 2nd course - we had the Crispy Scottish Langoustines and Buddhas hand lemon pine nut crusted sea scallops.  These two dishes were both excellent but the langoustines (aka Norway lobster) wins by a photo finish. They gave a lot of langoustine meat and you could taste the lobster flavor. The hearts of palm were cut into very small cubes, so it wasn't too overpowering.  I love the crispiness, didn't feel oily at all.  Both dishes were clean, fresh, yet filling.  The scallops was cooked perfectly.  I couldn't tell in the light, but it tasted very slightly raw in the middle.  Other than that, it was an excellent dish.For the 3rd course - we had the Atlantic Turbot roasted on the bone and pan seared millbrook venison loin.  The turbot was a meaty/heavy fish.  I was so full by the time we finished this course.  The fish wasn't dry and there were no bones.  Out of these two dishes, I much preferred the venison loin.  Cooked medium rare to perfection and had tons more flavor than the turbot.  Each root piece was a different root and it all complemented the meat well.  The red wine flavor wasn't strong at all, hardly noticeable.  For the 4th course - we had the Kenyan coffee ganache and maple-honey pear variation.  I got the kenyan coffee because I wanted to see how strong it really tasted.  Granted it's not Kenyan coffee beans, but I figured it would be close.  It was definitely strong but it went well with the ice cream.  I wish I had more ice cream.  The rice krispy definitely helped to cut back a little of the dark bitter chocolate taste.  The honey pear variation was fresh and light.  The asian pear slices were sweet and crispy.  Just how it should be.  The maple pecan ice cream was the best thing on that dish.  I could go for thirds!!  I originally thought that the pear dish was going to be poached in alcohol, but I was completely wrong and I still enjoyed every bite of it.After we finished the courses, they gave 2 more complimentary dessert courses.  One of the complimentary dessert dishes had edible gold flakes.  I was so happy that I got to try them finally.  Now I don't have to pay $1000 for the Serendipity sundae =P  The flakes were slightly sweet and it just melted as it touched your tongue.  Loved it!!  Service was beyond excellent.  Always asking you how you're doing, how's the food.  Always filling up the water non-stop.  More than happy to answer your questions.  Even the water boy knew all the components of the dishes.  I was very impressed.  We sat in the long booths.  The leather seating was very comfortable and your visual field was facing the center of the restaurant.  Felt like you were in a Colosseum but overlooking other diners.  Loved the decor! I was extremely full by the time I left the restaurant.When you pick up your coats, they gave us gingerbread (cinnamon, anise, ginger, orange & lavender honey glazed with rum, garnished with orange peel confit & pistachios).  I liked the gingerbread A LOT except for the orange peel.  I didn't think it went well at all.  Pistachios was a nice touch though.  I would definitely recommend this place and I would definitely come back here again!",1,0,2,Leo O.,"Queens, NY",200,518,1703
5.0,1/1/2012,"Great food, knowledgeable staff, warm atmosphere. Felt guilty spending $200 on a 6-course tasting menu (pre-wine, pre-tax, pre-tip), but it's hard to get all that for less in NYC. Call ahead to figure out the tasting menu options because on Thur/Fri(?) it's a set menu and you can't choose between two dishes for each course. Remember to dress up (most guys were in suits).Here's what I got:amuse bouche - trio of parsnip puree (sweet creaminess), salmon, and shrimp Seared Foie Gras: I was able to replace cold terrine option and mosaic of muscovy duck and parsnip (looked like a cool checkerboard when it comes out) with a seared foie grasTasting of yellowtail tuna: there was some debate at the table which was better, I like the refreshing tartare, a friend liked cured, the one with anchovies was too salty for our likingshared Sea scallops and Squid ink raviolini: raviolini (squid ink bursts in your mouth) was more inventive, but the sea scallops were perfectly cooked and had celery done several different ways - I preferred the scallops but my friend preferred the ravioliniSlow poached monkfish tail: monkfish tastes like lobster, which I love, though this dish was perhaps the least memorableDuo of beef: preferred the seared wagyu tenderloin over the short ribs (salty but more  rich tasting)Chocolate coulant: great ending to the meal, hard on the outside, warm/melty on the insideWe were actually offered 3 more desserts: set of petit fours, chocolates, and madeleinesOh and we also met Daniel Boulud!!",1,0,0,Sarah J.,"New York, NY",22,63,5
5.0,12/29/2011,"I was completely blown away by this experience.  We were contacted by phone and then greeted by host/reservation staff in a very welcoming way without the stuffiness that I feared. After a drink at the bar, we were led to an amazing table for two with great space and a view. The dinner service was impeccable; the staff seemed to float around the dining room like I was watching a choreographed dance. We ordered the eight-course chef's tasting menu, which is a must both from an economic and gastronomic standpoint.From land, sea and air, the tasting covered it all with a level of elegance, sophistication and refinement that I had never experienced. Each course was introduced in a friendly and helpful manner. the sommelier chatted with us about wine pairings. All in all, from amuse bouche to the pastry chef's takeaway gifts, we ooh'ed, aah'ed and gasped after every course not believing it was possible to be better than the last. Was it expensive? Absolutely, but the price was nothing to pay compared to the experience. They even printed a beautiful menu for us to take home to remember our night.PS: I booked these reservations for Christmas week in NYC about two weeks prior on Open Table. It's definitely worth a shot looking on short notice, especially if you don't mind eating early (We had a 5:30 reservation, were seated around 6 and the meal lasted approximately 3 hours).",1,0,0,Sean C.,"Hartford, CT",90,205,87

In fact, all of the extra treats they serve at the end of the meal may leave you wishing they would stop. Do not have a late lunch! Don't go here expecting molecular gastronomy or the trendiest plate of food you've ever heard of. Daniel provides perfectly executed French cuisine. Period. This restaurant is everything a restaurant should be and more. It is a five-star dining experience, so deserving of its 3 Michelin stars.

They offer a tasting menu but also offer a la carte which makes this place pretty damn awesome.Overall, I thought the food was fantastic. I was particularly blown away by the appetizers, which was the best way to kick off a meal. I'd come back just to try the rest of their appetizers since it was so difficult to make a decision.Dodge cove oysters in sea water gelee with lemon custard, caviar, avocado mousse, sea urchin -this appetizer basically combined some of my fav food items into one nice dish (avocado, uni, and oyster). SO good.""Tasting of yellow fin tuna"" was yellow fin tuna prepared in three different ways: 1) ""en tartare"" with northern lights caviar 2) Cured with compressed celery  and 3) Cured Confit with anchovy dressing.

I'm salivating just thinking about this dish.Black sea bass with roasted black mission figs, fennel royale, and syrah sauce - If you're a fan of seafood, I think this is a solid dish.

I was a little hesitant about going to Daniel after seeing pictures of the dining room because it looked a bit stuffy, but I got a completely different vibe when we were seated.  Granted when I looked around the dining room, we probably brought down the average age of the customers because most ppl were there for business, dates, or family occasions, but I think that's what made it fun.  Don't wait for a special occasion to go!We all got the 3 course tasting menu and there were so many enticing items on the menu that I deferred to the waiter for suggestions and he did not disappoint!

For the first timer, I do admit I was overwhelmed a bit too. You aren't allowed to remove your jacket (I did anyways and there was a curt voice telling me that jacket has to be worn at all times). And the restaurant was bustling. The wine list was humongous. I didn't know where to begin - so I did what intelligent guys do - deferred it to my better half. She's good with wine - I am good with drinking. The appetizer - all I can say is I now love squash soup (I ordered fried curried rish with fish). And the presentation was well, very royale. The bread selection is fantastic and the bread guy just shows up at the right time. :-) Pretty neat, I think. Onto the entree - this is where I kind of lost it - I had beef steak - I got one square piece of steak - the size of table spoon - which was very soft and tasted great with a same size potato and same sized poached meat. That's it. THE END. I just didn't know if I had to laugh or cry - I was hungry and there was no food. The dessert I ordered was ok - but my girlfriend ordered the cocoa bean stuff and that plate licking good. It is an experience of life time - but do plan on having a hot dog before or after because for the money - the quantity just isn't there.And I did like the waiters putting on the fake french accent and when they get pushed for answers - they just chuck it and talk in English.

They do have some on lend, though, that has to be weird. The guy I was with forgot and the sizing wasn't ideal for him.You could definitely do a business meeting here, but I somehow feel it's better for special occasion or dating.  It's a bit too upscale. I suppose if you were in a slightly older set than I, say like late 50's and up, then this is great for a high powered meeting.

It was completely unexpected as I've dined at The FL and Le Bernadin and at both places, the wait staff was incredibly nice and friendly.Overall, two hours for 7 courses and two complimentary desserts was short and not so worthwhile.

My whole table was treated like we belonged there, which I appreciate immensely. Service was top notch. Our fantastically French server was kind, serious, and passionate about his job, recommending dishes based on the ingredients and their signature recipes. Courses were brought out by what seemed like a trio of synchronized swimmers in suits, elegantly and simultaneously placing our dishes in front of us and announcing each dish being served as if it were created especially for us. Somehow, hearing about what you are going to eat makes it taste that much better.The food was prepared with such finesse that I was longing to get a peek inside the kitchen. I would love to know the environment that produces that kind of precision and delicacy. Some highlights:1. I loved the bread service that was offered, with a choice of many types of fresh baked breads. The olive rosemary roll was lovely.2. I have always heard that in French cuisine, the sauces are what make the food truly shine, and I have to agree wholeheartedly. The saffron cream atop my Squid Ink and Artichoke Raviolini as well as the Syrah sauce accompanying my Black Sea Bass took the entire meal to the highest level of luxury.3. Dessert. There is too much to say, so it gets its own paragraph:I do not have the biggest sweet tooth, and therefore dessert is usually the part of the meal that lets me down the most. This was not the case with Daniel's desserts, which I would return to the restaurant to enjoy on their own. My dessert was the Chocolate Coulant with Caramel and Fleur de Sel Milk Sorbet. The coulant was cooked impeccably, and adding the salted sorbet just made all the amazing flavors jump out even more. Our table was also served tiny, lemony Madelines as well as a sextet of bite-sized desserts and a round of micro-chocolates filled with flavors like passion fruit, peanut butter, coffee, and blueberry. The fact that dessert was delicious was impressive enough, but that it just kept coming is what left me astounded.I now know why posts for Daniel are so long. Everyone wants to relive the few hours of their life that they felt a bit like royalty. The extra touches that Daniel adds to the dining experience cultivate love in each diner.

5.0,11/8/2011,"I know I know... most of you are going to immediately look at this post & think ""Another 5 star?."" Alright, I admit... I normally like to give things the benefit of doubt in most circumstances (even with this Penn State media debacle... Joe Pa deserves the benefit of the doubt). Regardless, everyone you hear talk about Daniel around town is normally sucking it dry with comments of, ""The best restaurant in NYC.."" ""French culinary at its finest..."" ""3 Michelin Starred Resaurant"" blah blah blah. Even when I found out I would be dining at Daniel for my birthday this year, I was a little nervous about it. I know what it's like to wait on those people who are out for their birthday... the people that save up all year just so they can dine at YOUR restaurant. They are the overly observant, keen-slooths on the pursuit of any mis-haps & service hiccups they can sniff out (am I having server paranoia right now??). It was that paranoia that made me wonder if the people at Daniel would recognize this ""Beverly Hillbilly/Bridge & Tunnel/I don't belong here"" glare that just walked in their front door.... So, let's start from the beginning... I started my descent to Daniel by making the journey up Madison from downtown Manhattan. As I crossed into the 60's on Madison, I could immediately tell I was entering an area that reeked of the finer things in life. Turning on 65th street, I could see the awning of Daniel in the distance. Classically lit with Daniel spelled out in a dated typeface, the opulence of the restaurant started here. As you get inside, you immediately understand that judging Daniel by it's cover is not a bad thing in this case. The restaurant aesthetics are absolutely stunning. All I could keep thinking about was Lucille Ball haha. I honestly have no idea why.... The only thing that could have made this scene even more enjoyable would have been a light piano playing in the background. It would have been the perfect soundtrack to what I was seeing.Per usual, my mom was running on her time schedule... so that gave me extra time to spend at the bar. I unfortunately do not remember the bartender's name but he was very delightful & inviting. I started with a sparkling rose and awaited out my mom's arrival. Our reservation was for 6:30 & we probably didn't sit until 7:15 (a restaurants nightmare). Either way, they didn't make a fuss about it or even mention it. After finally getting to our table, this is where the main show began to unfold. Partially because I hate details (aka lazy) and partially because I would rather you to experience this part first hand... I just want to point out a couple of suggestions & highlights. Since you've saved up all year to go to this restaurant... let the staff put on the their show & ride the ride they are asking you to jump on. Don't cut corners... splurge, be bold & relax into knowing you deserve this! Who cares if you have to wait for your tax return to pay off this charge! Indulge! Get the truffle pasta, have your maine lobster bisque, order the grouse & the duo of meat entree to share with the table.... And if you like wine (hello... it's 2011) grab a bottle of something you've always wanted to try-- we got The Carriage House and I highly recommended it. Decently priced, it fit nicely with all of our courses. I did asked the sommelier to save the label for us but unfortunately he forgot. Giovanni was our server & he was fantastic. Very approachable & extremely knowledgable on his craft. I'm not sure if they knew it was my birthday or if they picked up on the celebration as I was opening a gift but Giovanni unexpectedly presented me with a candled desert. I was happy to know that even Daniel believes birthday candles! I had the idea that they might be ""too good"" for candles haha-- I was wrong. After one of the most memorable meals of my life... the icing on the cake came when we were invited into the kitchen to meet the Executive Chef, Sous Chefs and support team. I loved being allowed a glimpse at how they operate... the different stations that various courses are delivered from, how they expedite the food, the plating styles, etc... Inside the kitchen there is a sky box that you can reserve to sit in to eat your meal. Regardless of your party size though...you are charged a four person minimum. Talk about being inside the chef's mind though! I'll have to save up for the next two years to afford that baby! Please MegaMillion, please!Thank you Daniel... thank you for making me believe in your fantastic ratings & reviews! Thank you for giving me one hell of a journal entry into my memory bank. I hope to see you sometime again dear friend...Love Always,One Broke New Yorker",5,4,4,Amanda B.,"Manhattan, NY",32,9,4
2.0,11/8/2011,"Dear Daniel,Look - I know what you're thinking... ""2 stars, WTF.  What, do you not like French food or something?""  But here's the truth.  When you charge $400 for dinner for two (that's 290 Euros, Daniel), you are rated on different scale.  What I mean is, while your meal didn't taste like a 2-star Papaya Dog, when compared to other ""fine-dining"" experiences, you fell woefully short of expectations.Let's begin with a suggestion.  Do you think it might be possible to put pictures next to your dinner choices?  I think of myself as somewhat cultured, but why did I still have to Google every item on the menu to figure out what it was that I was ordering?  Oh, and you have horrible cell reception inside your establishment - might I suggest investing in a booster so others can connect to Google more quickly before ordering?  Otherwise, you end up ordering squab, like me, only to discover its a pigeon (and not a tasty one at that).  Now let's talk first course.  Your hearts of palm salad - yeah, needs a bit of work (and by a bit, I really mean a lot of work).    Moving on to the main dish...  we all know no two pigeons are alike.  Sporty Thieves taught me that in their oh so clever response to TLC's 'No Scrubs.  So, if I were you, Daniel, I'd suggest checking out the ones roosting near Washington Square Park.  I'm sure they are a little more tender.  Lastly, let's talk deserts.  Yes, this was the best part of the meal - but nothing that has me salivating for more.  Simply put, average.Look - nothing personal.  I'm sure you're a great person and all, and my 2 star review isn't going to hurt your stellar Yelp rating or your Michelin prestige.  But, you really do need to try a little harder for the price you charge and the expectations you set for yourself.Sincerely,Jon",8,20,2,Jon C.,"New York, NY",180,101,12

First of all, the restaurant itself is so beautiful.  The decor is a refined classic, not outdated.  There is beautiful art, it is well lit but not bright, it is just simply put, refined.  Obviously the service is out of this world.  Every server and wait staff member was pleasant and made us feel important!We started with the lentil veloute and the squid and artichoke raviololini.  My boyfriend enjoyed his veloute very much, and I can't even begin to explain how delicate, but flavorful, and delicious by raviolini was.  The mixture of artichoke, squid, and clams come together so well!For our entrees my boyfriend had the bacon wrapped swordfish.  I tried a bite of his dish, and I could not believe how soft, delicate, and refined the swordfish tasted.  I warned him that swordfish is a steakier fish, but I couldn't believe how halibut-like it was prepared!  I had the pork-three ways, and what can I say, all three ways were so delicious!  The belly, skin, and little pork chops were among the best preparations of pork I've ever had.  For dessert I had the chocolate mouse and my boyfriend had the apple with biscuit.  I always feel like most restaurants fall flat when it comes to dessert, but Daniel impressed!  The desserts were all so flavorful, with mixtures of textures and temperatures.  We also kept getting little treats.  Petit fours, madelines, truffles - all so wonderful, especially the madelines.We absolutely loved Daniel!",2,0,0,Milly P.,"Grand Junction, CO",46,128,16

Everything is rich and brings out the natural beauty of the ingredients. It's like a beautiful symphony of flavors and by the end of the meal, I was in pure heaven.

4.0,9/30/2011,"The wife took me to Daniel for my birthday. The execution almost matched the hype. Almost.We were seated in the restaurant's version of Siberia, in a corner on a balcony. At times it felt like we were forgotten. The menus took 15 minutes to arrive. We were only offered a refill on bread once. There was a 30-minute gap between appetizer and entry. Everybody was perfectly pleasant. But a little more attention could have been paid.We ordered the three-course menu and paid $60 extra for wine pairings, after seeing the extortionate prices on the voluminous wine list. As it turned out, that was not a good way to go, as the pours were not that generous. For the entree, I asked for more than they were initially going to pour (a Copain pinot noir) and later put more in the glass without asking. But still. For what we were paying they needn't have been so stingy.The same went for my wife's duo of wagyu tenderloin and a short rib, which came with an $18 supplement. The beef was out-of-this-world delicious, but the portion was more akin to what you would get for a tasting menu. I pointed this out to the captain later. To his credit, rather than challenge me, he instead offered to bring us an additional course (from the tasting menu). We accepted and enjoyed rabbit done three ways. A nice comeback, but it shouldn't have been necessary, esepcially when you add $18 to the already-considerable tab.One special that may be worth it was the cote du boeuf for two that cost an extra $25 a head. Being seated near the serving station, we saw it brought out. The meat on the bone was a work of art. It was expertly carved and you could see that it was cooked to perfection. They actually ran out of it the night we were there.My black bass with sumac was of a high quality--better than most, but just not blown away, as I hoped and expected. Meat may be the way to go here. For seafood, go to Le Bernardin.Dessert was the true highlight. My vodka pluots with almond mousse and orange sorbet were a big winner, as was my wife's hazelnut crumble with dulce de leche ice cream. They also brought out freshly baked madelines, petit fours and delectable chocolates to make sure you didn't leave hungry.All in all, it was a very good dining experience, just not a great one, which was what I was hoping for given Daniel's (Boulud was working the room) rep. I'd go back (maybe the pre-theatre menu), but maybe I'll wait until someone else is picking up the tab.

1.0,9/2/2011,"VEG REVIEW:We went here for our anniversary dinner and left incredibly disappointed.  They recently added a vegetarian menu which we were excited to try.  The amuse was a sampling of cauliflower and brocolli.  Gross.  Pureed cauliflower and raw cauliflower and one tiny cube of cheese with a flick of brocolli on it.  Cold corn veloute - I've had better corn chowder in countless places.  Tasting of carrots - tiny bits of regular carrots with a little bit of carrot puree, the puree was good but the carrots were totally raw and had no flavor.  Entrees - artichoke raviolini- undercooked pasta, thick butter sauce and again no flavor. Couldn't even taste the artichokes.  Cauliflower moussoline with chanterelles.  I had like a dime sized amount of chanterelles on the plate.  Two tiny tater tots and two small roasted slices of cauliflower.  Lacking salt and any other flavor.  Lukewarm.  How they justify charging 300 for this stuff I'll never know.  The waiter overheard us complaining and comparing it to a meat entree which was easily three or four times the size. He brought over a tiny pan with more roasted plain cauliflower! Thanks!  The dessert was excellent at least.  The usual chocolate fountain cake, but with caramel and salt.  We also had the hazelnut crumble with dulce de leche cream.  Great play of flavors and textures.  The cocktails were good as well.  Overall a very lacking experience.  Nothing compared to Per Se, Craft or Gramercy Tavern.",4,3,0,Nirupama K.,"Houston, TX",97,21,0

Tihany redesigned the interior, someone should have redesigned the menu, kitchen and staff.  The ABSOLUTE BEST part of Daniel is the gorgeous décor.  Bravo to Tihany, BOO to Boulud.To set the scene, I dined at Daniel on a Sunday night with three companions.  Two of my fellow diners were pescetarians, meaning they do not eat land animals, though fish and seafood are perfectly within their diets.  My third dinner companion is the executive chef at a celebrated restaurant in Pittsburgh, PA.  We opted to experience the Chef's Tasting Menu, with wine pairings.  The Chef's Tasting Menu consists of six courses, and there are two choices for each course.  There is also a vegetarian tasting menu.  The pescetarians combined options from both menus to form a custom tasting menu.  The executive chef and I decided to choose opposite one another, as to experience the entirety of the Chef's Tasting Menu.  The best bite of food was the first course of duck terrine.  The terrine was smooth and flavorful and was paired with a beautiful crusty bread and seasonal accoutrement.  The other three dishes are not worth mentioning.  In fact, none of the following four courses are worth mentioning.  Truly, this meal was all technique and no taste.  The flavors were deficient, and each plate lacked modernity and ingenuity I expect when I hear about all those stars.  Now, the chocolate dessert was delicious, but I first had to overlook the plating.  The cake, sauce and quenelle of ice cream were arranged in a distinctly phallic manner, and the sauce was a brown smear on my plate.  Really?  Aren't we over the smear?  And was the brown smear EVER really ok?The wine pairings were perhaps the most insulting part of this experience.  Quite frankly, the sommelier should be shot on sight.  Even though each diner had a unique dish per course, the pairings were THE SAME.  Our first pairing was a Riesling that would have been better reserved as a dessert wine with a cheese plate.  It was cloyingly sweet, and was paired with Duck Terrine, Quail Terrine and Frisee Salad with Heirloom Tomatoes (which was so shockingly boring it defies explanation).  I am quite confused how a French Sommelier could possibly pair foie gras with the same wine as he pairs with a lettuce and tomato salad.  In addition, he was condescending and flat-out rude.  After we questioned his strange pairings, he brought us what he described as ""beginner wine.""  Wow.The rest of the service was just as terrible.  We sat at the table for fifteen minutes before anyone approached.  One course was served without any explanation as to what we were eating.  And several of the other courses were described by a server whose South American accent was so thick we couldn't understand a single word.  The man who brought the bread around was perfectly nice, as were his wares.  Sadly, the bread was one of the highlights of this rather distressing evening.At the end this disenchanting dining experience, we paid a bill in excess of $1500.  The Chef's Tasting Menu is supposed to be the chef's absolute A game.  Well, at Daniel, I give Chef Jean François Bruel a solid C minus!For more reviews, visit TrustFundTraveler DotCom",3,0,0,TrustFundTraveler D.,"Manhattan, NY",2,1,0

Unfortunately we must have been the unlucky number who ever so often gets the short end of the stick, even with high standard dining experiences!  We were trying to enjoy our food but we were simply distracted due to the waiters lack of attention.To add, he was a tad pretentious.

5.0,8/22/2011,"Daniel is everything you would imagine it to be. This is definitely one of the restaurants in NYC that if given the opportunity, everyone should try at least once. The food was excellent and the service was phenomenal. From the moment we sat down, we felt like stars. The dining area is set up in a very special way. The room is a giant square where the larger tables are in the center and then there are two levels (about a few steps or so) above the main floor. The tables surrounding the center on each level are mostly tables for two where the diners sit facing the center rather than each other. This is rather enjoyable as you get to see everything that is happening. As for the food- the main server first asked if we were celebrating anything special to make sure they would be attentive to any special needs/requests. The service was beyond what anyone could ever expect. Then as we were deciding on which tasting menu we wanted, we were told that we could try both! What a delight! Everything was just wonderful. But my favorite dish was the Tasting of Veal. The runner up would be the fresh baked Madeline's! The Madeline's weren't on the menu and were just an extra dessert on the house. We really cannot say enough good things about Daniel. All that being said, it is obviously a very expensive dinner. You get what you pay for! But I'll be back for a special occasion!",0,0,0,Samantha W.,"New York, NY",12,44,0
3.0,8/21/2011,"really 3.5 starsFirst of all, i want to clarify the dress code: dinner jacket is required, and no, dont make the same mistake I did and go in with a banana republic black semi-formal jacket thinking its alright, its not, but luckily they have jackets to lend. its definitely a very dressy/business place, so you should strive to have perfectly creased pants, shiny shoes, a sharp button up preferably with a tie, and a jacket that says ""im made of tons of money,"" there was a group of 4 (1 guy 3 gals) ahead of us who was turned away because the guy went in jeans...i come from the west coast, and I have yet to dine at a place that is as strict with their dress as Daniel was, and I have dined at plenty of nice places. the dress code could be good thing possibly, or possibly not so good, i have yet to form a conclusion about this yet. i can see why they are so strict, its definitely tailored to the business upper middle/wealthy class and they want to maintain the look and feel, and also exclusivity of the place. the drinks: had a mojito and a white cosmo, the white costo had a ball made of ice in the middle with elder flower frozen into it. Both drinks were STRONG! you definitely get your 20 some bucks for per cocktail. the sommelier also recommended a fancy bottle of wine from southern france, decent. and the wine menu is daunting, so unless you know your wine, ask for a suggestionsthe food: the bread rolls were good but nothing spectacular, though a huge selection though. they also served a sampling course of the day's ingredient which in my case was beets prepared in three ways (this was on the house of course). appetizer, we had the foie gras pate (though its not called 'pate' on the menu) it was good, probably one of the better pates i've had. the other appetizer was artic trio, good but again nothing to rave about. for the main course, we shared the snapper, this fish was delicious, moist, and flavorful, i believe it was prepared wrapped in a salted dough. dessert was peanut butter custard and some hazelnut thing, nothing to rave about. they did give complimentary mini bakery treats and also mini madelines, which was a plus. we also did a cheese course at the end, it was really a hit and miss, some of the cheeses for me was really good, and others were just too potent, at other restaurants, patrons generally are presented with a variety of cheeses to choose from but not at Daniel, you get what they give youthe total bill for 2 people that evening was just under 600why 3 stars? the place seemed cold, perhaps a bit intimidating. it definitely doesnt have the intimate feel that im use to, but maybe thats my proble, and not the restaurants. i had absolutely no complains about the service or the food, there was also nothing that was particularly memorable for me",0,0,0,Long C.,"San Francisco, CA",59,1095,1112

4.0,8/18/2011,"I'm not a huge fan of French food, due to the fact that it tends to be quite heavy at times. That being said, if I had to pick a French restaurant which represented the epitome of Parisian cuisine, I would pick Daniel. The restaurant is just as much the feast for the eyes as it is for the pallet, and I found the flavors to be perfectly balanced among every dish that I had. I had some species of duck casserole, and found it to be excellent. The dessert tray was equally as compelling, and although I didn't have wine, they had an excellent selection. This restaurant is probably one of the most visually stunning in all of New York, and I would certainly save it for a special occasion.Although this is not a comment on the food, the last time I was at this restaurant I found it a little odd that they had a restroom attendant waiting to hand you a towel after you wash your hands. They actually had a female bathroom attendant standing in the male bathroom, and the men in my party thought they were in the wrong bathroom when they first entered. Quite awkward, as I would expect this in Japan but not in New York City.",0,1,1,Peter S.,"Suffern, NY",53,181,5
3.0,8/13/2011,"Looking through the copy of the tasting menu they gave us and the pictures, nothing really stands out.  All the food was good, but not great.  Somewhere within a $195 tasting menu with a $105 wine pairing, something should stand out, I think.Plus, the service was not consistently up to par for a 3-star Michelin restaurant.  Our server did a good job - friendly, efficient, not stuffy. But other members of the team did not provide the same level of service. We ordered sparkling water but they started serving us still water and later tap water.  This mistake should not be made.  Plus the service is awkward.  They go into this little crowded cubicle before they serve the tables, I'm assuming to coordinate their service.  But it's just weird and distracting, especially when most fine dining restaurants can coordinate from the kitchen.No matter when you show up for your reservation, you will be asked to wait ensuring that you buy a drink at the bar.  This practice bugs me.  Obviously not the worst restaurant I've been, too.  I'd go back if someone else was buying, of course.  But 3-star Michelin restaurants should not be A-OK.",0,1,1,Holly C.,"Arvada, CO",116,775,511
2.0,8/13/2011,Daniel was three Michelin stars.. Why? Because I didn't taste it in the food when I was there. I think it's over rated and over hyped from the movies.I don't drink cock tails but I was told to try the White Cosmo. It was really good and beautiful. They had a frozen flower in a ice ball to chill the drink.,3,3,2,Jeff M.,"Beverly Hills, CA",1277,145,86
5.0,8/13/2011,"Reservations highly recommended, and preferably give yourself at least 2-3 hours here. Be prepared to splurge in cost and in calories, though you will find both well worth it. We've been twice for special occasion dinners, and found the service to be impeccable (almost too attentive at times). For our first dinner here, we were two diners and chose the tasting menu at a later seating (9 PM), which meant we were among the last diners to leave past midnight. Though it's pitched as five courses, you end up eating more like 7 once you include the amuse bouche and the additional dessert treats. I thoroughly enjoyed it, but would have chosen an earlier seating to take even more time enjoying each course, and to savor a coffee with my last course. For our second visit, we went the a la carte route, in part because we were not as hungry, but also because it was with a larger group (5). We went for an earlier seating at 7:30, and the meal was just as leisurely (actually even longer - we left past 11 PM...hopefully we did not overstay our welcome). When making the reservations, my husband noted the occasion; the hosts and the servers took every opportunity to congratulate us, which was very sweet, and they saw us off with a gift at the end of the meal. This is a full meal kind of place, unless you stop at the bar, which is also lovely. Though the chefs are accommodating to dietary restrictions, even in the tasting menu, I would not recommend this place for vegetarians/vegans.

5.0,8/6/2011,"Came late on a Saturday night just for dessert and tea at the bar, which is a tiny 4-seater.  All of the waiters in their suits seemed to have Euro accents, but really weren't snooty or pretentious as expected (esp since I was coming in a casual dress with flats on). The service was impeccable, minus the chatting of 2 waiters next to me, but that's not sounexpected since I was at the bar and there would be nowhere else togo for them. They pulled out my chair at the bar, immediately gave me place settings, water, were very attentive (again, even given my rather casual/out of place appearance). Looking around, almost everyone was in a cocktail dress and heels, and i think all men were in blazers.  As expected, it was an older crowd; tons of 60/70 year olds but there were definitely a few younger couples. The main dining room is very stately; clearly fancy and morebusiness-like than homey or romantic. The decor was pretty minimal butI did like that the tables were fairly far apart for quiet convos.Each party seemed to have a round table; couples had a moon-shapedbooth at a round table, which I liked (but did not sit at).I ordered one dessert: warm Guanaja chocolate coulant, liquid caramel, fleur de sel, milk sorbet...which is a fancy name for molten chocolate lava cake. it was garnished with edible gold foil - damn straight, since it cost me $18 for a one-inch wide by 2"" tall lil nugget of a cake and a dollop of sorbet, which really just tasted like ice cream. all desserts are $18, whether you get a piece of fancy, infused fruit slice or a chocolatey decadent dessert.to be honest, it was not the best chocolate molten lava cake i've ever had (or Guanaja chocolate coulant, whatever). the molten inside was heavenly; rich, thick chocolate with caramel mixed in (caramel taste kind of got hidden; maybe it was meant to just give a sticky consistency), but the outer cake portion wasn't that amazing. i found it kind of bland (esp compared to the richness of the inside) and slightly dry. however, overall it was definitely delicious and super chocolately (saved by the inside). i was just expecting something unbelievable at 18 bucks a pop.after eating the coulant, i was pretty content. i thought ""okay, for $18, i'm not unhappy. not super ecstatic, but this is borderline worth it, given the place i'm at."" BUT THEN, the heavens opened, and made me say...should I be paying more than $18?.....even though i got one dessert and one tea, after the waiter cleared my coulant, he came back with a basket of madeline cookies (maybe like 8 little cookies just for me, although they are puffy - like little cake bites). They were warm and so buttery but light and sprinkled with powdered sugar. it was SO AMAZING and spot on. these might be the highlight of my night.then came a tray of petit fours! there were about 7 or 8 varieties of little treats. most were some sort of jellied fruit tart-type bites or tiny cakes, and there was one chocolatey petit four, which i saved for last. it actually turned out to be choco-peanut butter (surprise!) with a huge pb taste - it was jam-packed with flavor and a great end to my parade of desserts.i definitely do want to try daniel for the regular meal, especially since i had such a great experience with the desserts. i think if the coulant's outside cake was slightly more moist, and maybe if they added some type of berry to the dessert (even just one or two strawberries on the plate), that particular dessert could be one of the best in its league. however, b/c of the 2nd and 3rd desserts they provided that was simply amazing, daniel gets all 5 stars from me!",0,0,0,Anna L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,82,1

2.0,8/3/2011,"This was not our first time at Daniel but several years have passed since we last dined here and after reading so many rave reviews we looked forward to trying it again. We love dining out and have travelled all over the world and eaten at some of the top rated restaurants. It is our opinion that the experience should be equal to the food quality and unfortunately Daniel fell short on both. Our disappointment began as soon as we were seated. We were given a small table in the lower part of the dining room located directly under the stairs that lead into the room. The table was just large enough to hold our place settings and one wine bottle. As soon as the bread butter champagne glasses arrived the table was cramped and unpleasant.The small 'purse stool' had to be placed to my right as not to block the  'passageway'  that was used by the waitstaff to access the upper dining area and the general feeling was that the table was an afterthought in more ways than one. We were kindly greeted by our waiter and we ordered two glasses of champagne as well as our wine and food. The champagne was brought to us along with the bread. We sampled three different types of the homemade bread all of which seemed to have the soggy tough quality that occurs when bread is not fresh. We dined on the langoustines and foie gras both were just ok and both I might add were 'extras' meaning that there was a supplemental charge added to our prix fixe price (??) throughout the dinner a young woman staff member fluttered about our table asking questions like where are you from? Have you ever been here before.?is this a special occasion?blah blah blah this was disconcerting for several reasons, one is this really a'small talk' kind of place? And two were we being profiled for some reason? When our entrees arrived (beef,again with the supplement ) we were astounded at the portion size 4 bites later we still had half a bottle of wine left so we ordered the cheese. The waiters response? What kind of cheese? Seriously were we the first people to ever order cheese here? After finishing the cheese we ordered one dessert (much to the obvious dismay of the waitress ) and in an attempt to make room for the dessert plate she tipped the bottle of Barolo upside down into my husbands glass as if she was squeezing out ketchup on a burger! To her defense there literally was no room on the table for it once the pre dessert arrived but come on the glass was already half way full! Our dining experience at Daniel was unfortunate because as we all know this city is full of top notch chefs incredibly fresh ingredients and exceptional service. The food was good,not excellent. The service was rushed (turn and burn) waiters were running through the dining room and our entire 4 course meal took just under an 1 1/2hrs.

5.0,7/29/2011,I love the food here and wish I could afford to eat here on non-special occasion days.  I did the three course prix fixe with the foie gras and the lamb.  Both were excellent.  I also liked the amuse bouche and the complimentary warm madeleines they served prior to bringing out the dessert.  Ambiance was very nice although I think I was expecting something a bit more special as far as the décor is concerned.  It is definitely an older crowd though (probably because they can afford to eat here more regularly!)  I would highly recommend this restaurant for a special occasion or anniversary dinner.,0,0,0,Nina S.,"Manhattan, NY",16,159,2
5.0,7/25/2011,"For our fifth anniversary, we splurged and decided to go to Daniel!It was soooo good. And we went for the three courses with wine pairing, which was a totally reasonable $168 per person. The amuse bouche was a red beet puree with green apple, smoked salmon and yellow pepper, and ... I forget the third. I was impressed with the fresh flavor pairings, which were both inventive and likeable. They had a server come by with a lovely bread basket. I tried the parmesan focaccia and the fiance tried an olive rosemary bread as well as a pan de campagne.  The fiance started with a trio of hamachi (tartare, confit, rolled in some green thing) for a starter. Everything was very good and light but flavorful.  I had a seared duck foie gras with rhubarb that was delicious. I have a complete weakness for foie gras, and this was done perfectly- warm and melty and just enough gamey-ness.   For the entree, I had a trio of veal- tenderloin, cheek and sweetbread- out of the three, the sweetbread was my favorite. So delish- crispy and creamy at the same time. The fiance had baby Lamb that was so so good. Everything was melt in your mouth. I had such a hard time choosing the dessert because they had such a plethora of choices for fruity desserts, which is so rare, as restaurants usually cater to the chocolate-lovers (which is not me at all!) Fiance had a hazlenut crunchy bar thing and I had a strawberries with yuzu sorbet. Both delicious, though my portion was a little large, as they had a medium-sized AND a small-sized tarte on the plate- I only needed one! And of course, they bring your madelines, petit fours, chocolates with your coffee and tea. What may have impressed me the most was how spot-on the wine pairings were. Though I couldn't tell you a single label of what we drank, every wine was paired perfectly- even the dessert, which I know is quite difficult to pair. I was thoroughly impressed with the caliber of the sommelier. Additionally, my other favorite part about the restaurant was the service- the servers were all very polite but frank. They seemed to chat with each other (not in an intrusive or bothersome way), which I think is so rare in nicer restaurants and a relief to know they are human! Our server was very honest in his recommendations when I told him I had a hard time deciding, which I loved. The service, overall, was very refreshingly down-to-earth.

Also ended the night with a 20 yr-old port.Our dishes were either perfect or near perfect in texture and flavor layering on top of being well-cooked. Excellent waitstaff. We'll be back for sure.,1,0,0,David P.,"Manhattan, NY",73,442,371
4.0,6/30/2011,"So I haven't written reviews in quite a while - but I guess there's no better way to get back into it than with Daniel.I had the pleasure of dining at Daniel in May for an anniversary and it was amazing. The restaurant itself is gorgeous and the staff are friendly, accommodating, and not the least bit snooty. We had a 10pm reservation and didn't get out of there until past midnight, so leave ample time for a long meal.The food was great - as expected, but some of the dishes were only so-so and not mind-blowing. (specifically the scallops - not my fave). But the complete experience was truly special, and I would recommend it to everyone!4.5",0,1,1,Jenny L.,"San Diego, CA",104,174,0
5.0,6/29/2011,"A meal at Daniel is an elaborate production; an art gallery, the ballet and a fine dining established wrapped up into one lovely white table-clothed, high-ceilinged package.The waiters pirouette around the tables, their movements precise, fluid and crisp and just as smoothly take your order while making suggestions after assessing your tastes with a keen eye.The meal started off with the bread basket. Warm, fragrant rosemary bread was placed on my plate. 'Don't fill your stomach with bread,' my companions warned, 'you're going to want to leave enough space for all the food we've ordered.' I wish they'd told me this before I'd polished it all off but I'm going to say - totally worth it.We were then served a trio of forgettable carrot amuse bouches before the appetizers arrived which magically disappeared in the blink of an eye. The servers are just *that* good. I've always had the prawn vs scallop dilemma at every fine dining establishment I've been to. I love the texture of prawns but I like the idea of scallops better and when I saw that Daniel was offering a hazelnut encrusted version, despite my aversion to all things foam, I decided to give it a go. I should have gone with the prawns. It wasn't that the scallops were horrendously bad per se but the foam was distracting and the scallops were slightly too watery for my taste. But that was probably the only not so great part of the meal, the other appetizers made up for it. The pressed duck foie gras terrine was fantastically flavourful and the duck pate had the most amazing texture. Now the good part. I love love love love love love love Daniel's lamb loin. It was sheer medium done perfection. The meat was moist and tender and even though there seemed to be a lot going on in terms of texture and flavours, they all melded together to form a heavenly bite of food. Perhaps that's why it was called the Elysian Fields Lamb Loin. If you're not a fan of lamb, then I suggest the duo of beef which is perfectly pink in the center and almost as good as the lamb. I was definitely more fond of the sides that accompanied the beef - never knew braised savoy cabbage could taste so good. I'm ashamed to say by this point, I was stuffed to the brim. We had ordered two fantastic bottles of wine (which I sadly forgot to take note of) and the desserts just kept coming and coming and coming. I would suggest the coconut lemongrass soup for something a little different but if you're more traditional, you can't go wrong with the warm  guanaja chocolate coulant. Our server brought us some pretty mini madeleines and a final dessert plate of petit fours but I had to pass. I know, I know, I fail as a foodie. Daniel was a brilliant meal, there's no doubt about it. The fact that the food was also a feast for the eyes with the gorgeously decorated plates and the impeccable service makes me realise why its been a New York establishment for all these years. If I could, I'd go back again in a heart beat but as they say, everything in moderation, except maybe that lamb loin.",1,0,0,Eunah T.,"San Francisco, CA",188,127,61

Formal attire only and the venue was nicely decorated and spacious. Service was superb as it should be for this type of establishment. We ordered the $103 3-course menu. I started with the scallops, which was a bit bland for my taste. However my gf ordered the supplement (+$17) for the foie gras w/ cherries, now THAT WAS delicious!!! A huge buttery piece of foie gras that's perfectly seared on the outside, yet still soft and moist inside. I was so jealous of her appetizer. The main course I had the lamb and my gf had the pork 3-way. It was good but not great, nothing very special, but the presentation was nicely done. Finally, for dessert I had a lemongrass poach pear and the gf had the lava chocolate cake, it was awesome. After our meal was done, we were given many dessert freebies, from a handful of small pastries, madeleine cookies, and small cubes of flavored chocolate. Needless to say, we were stuffed. Unfortunately, the weakest point of our entire meal was the entree which was a big disappointing. It is by no means bad, it was good, just nothing special.

Not only was it beautifully and meticulously plated, but it all tasted wonderful.  All very fresh ingredients.  Nothing that I felt I could have come close to making at home.  The risotto with truffle shavings was the best I've had, and my husband, who always orders short ribs wherever we go, said that theirs blew everyone else's out of the water.

3.0,6/11/2011,"3 michelin stars? really? wow.Definitely a bit disappointed by this place. Atmosphere was very elegant, service was impeccable, prices stratmospheric. All this was expected. Four of us did tasting menus with wine pairings. The actual wine pairings were fantastic; but the pours were so small they were not enough to get us through the food paired with them. Staying on that theme, the food portions were tiny (further frustrating us in terms of how small the wine pours were). The food was quite good in many cases, but none of us were ""wowed"" by any of our courses (except by the presentation - that was spectacular), and some were even forgettable. We had expected much much more. I know it sounds a bit small-minded to harp on things like portion sizes because I know it's really just a side issue; but interestingly, dessert portions were generous. Flour, eggs and sugar are cheap I guess... It is probably heresy to complain about this kind of thing with a restaurant of this acclaim; but 4 foodies arrived from out of town salivating about our chance to eat at one of the best restaurants in the world, and we left joking/chuckling about business issues like the tiny portions of beef and wine and large portions of dessert and how these guys must be laughing all the way to the bank.It was a very interesting experience eating at a top-flight celebrity-chef NYC french restaurant. We definitely appreciated the atmosphere and enjoyed the highly polished wait-staff; but the food was just good (not great). So in the final analysis I felt a bit ripped off and under-whelmed. I don't mind paying top dollar for top results. On this night, this restaurant just didn't live up to those expectations.",3,0,2,Stepvan V.,"Andover, MA",2,20,0

5.0,6/1/2011,"It is quite a treat eating at a 3 star Michelin restaurant.  Daniel is one of the best values out there, especially the 3 course $110 dollar pre-theater menu which comes with wine pairing!There is a sitting/lobby area as you walk in with a coat check.  I believe you wait 10-15 minutes there until the main dining room is ready and then a server will escort you to your table one at a time in a orderly fashion.  The decor and ""upscaleness"" is apparent when you walk in.  You can sip on a drink while you wait, and they'll bring it to your table when you get seated.The attire says Jackets are required, but we could take them off while in the dining room, they didn't mind, unlike some other places where I had to keep it on.You know you go to these fancy french restaurant and then none of the waiters speak French, this place was definitely legit, seems like all the waiters spoke French.  The service and attention to detail was impeccable.  The order in which orders were place ladies first then men, and having our meals served in perfect unison with 5 waiters.  All the movements and actions by our servers were with a purpose and synchronized.  Amazing Service, 6/5 if that were possible.  Oh and ladies, they even give you a little stool to place your purse next to you.On to the FOOD: (i don't remember exactly but just from memory)*Amuse- it was a trio of lobster I believe, I don't remember exactly but I'll attache the picture.*Starter:Peekytoe Crab Salad with Cumin Carrot Coulis- Spanner Crab Craquelin, Ginger, Avocado.

5.0,5/26/2011,"I have to say this was one of my best foodie experiences ever! I understand why this place received a 3 star Michelin and they deserve it! So right when you get into Daniel the coat lady greets you and asks to check in your coat. After that you sit by the lounge area as they set your table. When our table was ready they lead us to the table where they pulled out our chairs and brought stools for our purses. After that they bring us menus. I came with 3 other friends and my sister and we wanted to do the menu tasting with wine pairing. It was a 3 course meal with wine pairing for $110 not too bad I think for the full experience and service. Everything was amazing.They start you off with an array of different breads to try as you wait for your food to be prepared. After offering bread they come by with this sort of pre-appetizer. It was a plate with 3 different very small items. Something to start you off and give you an idea of what Daniel is all about and how amazing it will get. It was salmon, some green sauce and the last was a small piece of lobster. All really small bites. After the pre-app you get your starter. The starter I chose was the Maine Sea Scallop Rosett. It was amazing. I normally don't order scallop because I am not huge on seafood but this was amazing. It melts in your mouth and the sauce wasn't overbearing. It really complimented the scallop well starting off my meal right and excited for what else was to come!(I also forgot to mention when they serve your table it is like a show! They make sure they put everyone's dish in sequence! It's like they practice it. And when there is crumbs from the bread they offer you they make sure to clear it away and keep the table tidy for your enjoyment.) Now on to my entree! I had the Trio of Milk Fed Pig From Quebec. To me this reminds me of chinese roasted pig. The kind with the crunchy skin you see at sam woo haha! But this was WAY better. The meat was so tender and not tough the way I am use to it at asian restaurants. Daniel definitely too roasted pig to a whole new level. But I didn't think it was the best entree on the menu. My sister ordered the Sea Bass. I can eat fish but I am not a huge fan and I have to say this was the best fish I have ever eaten! The fish just goes onto your fork so nicely and the sauce wasn't over done. It was just right. For me to say fish was good really has to say something! hahaOnto my favorite part of the meal. Dessert! I had the Lemongrass poached pineapple. It was a nice treat and not overly sweet which I like. But I have to say I LOVED my friend's Chocolate Coulant even more! This chocolate cake melts and oozes in your mouth. It is truly amazing. And best part of dessert was the Moscato pairing. I love Moscato but this has got to be the best Moscato I have ever tried. After dessert there are freshly baked madelines and chocolates. Definitely another nice treat for those with a little sweet tooth like myself! Overall, Daniel was one of the best and most memorable food experiences I've had thus far. The service and food are exceptional!

4.0,5/22/2011,"I took my boyfriend to Daniel for his birthday, while adding a few more michelin stars to our belt. The overall experience was fantastic but not perfect. The decor was gorgeous, I loved the arches and the lights. We enjoyed our corner banquette seating where we could have our privacy and people watch, but a couple they later sat next to us sniffed at the fact that they couldn't see and be seen and switched tables. Perhaps if I have any quibbles with Daniel, it is that it's that kind of place where a few, not many, had their noses too far in the air. This was also reflected in the practiced banter our waiter engaged in that felt neither spontaneous or particularly sincere, but ever so polite and deferential. They are clearly catering to a certain crowd. The food was generally excellent. I loved the shrimp and salmon amuse bouche, just a perfect burst of clean flavor. The seared foie gras was one of the best I've ever had, served with asian pear.  My sea bass was delicious, but not too memorable, and my boyfriend felt his lamb loin was too fatty. The desserts was a siege of sweetness, I had a delicious hazelnut sweet, and we had an extra birthday dessert, plus the warm madelines, plus the chocolates.

I will try to be as informative as possible given that its been over a month since my trip.Service: The service was great and contributed to an unforgettable experience at Daniel. Everyone from the host to the servers were very attentive. Everything they did was so precise and well planned. Drinks were always full, courses were brought out simultaneously, silverware was promptly replaced, etc. They even had individual stools for the purses of each of the ladies in our party. Seriously every single detail of your dining experience is well thought out. If you enjoy being waited on and you appreciate the fine details of your dining experience you will not be disappointed. Definitely deserving of its 3 stars!Food: The food was great.They offer a 3 course pre-theather menu which comes with wine pairing for $110. This is an awesome deal considering the level and quality of both the food an service. In addition to your 3 courses you also get an amuse bouche, mini pastries, and some after dinner chocolates.

It was nice an juicy and not too fatty. It reminds me of the roast pork available at Asian Restaurants. However, the meat quality is much better. It is nice and lean.ROASTED BLACK SEA BASS - This was actually my favorite dish. I actually wanted to order this but since a friend already decided on this I chose to try the pork. The fish was light and flakey. The marinade was perfectly done. This fish seriously melts in your mouth! I get hungry just thinkin about it.===================Dessert===================LEMONGRASS POACHED PINEAPPLE - This dessert was yummy! It is a good nice light dessert. It is not too heavy. If you like fruity desserts this is the one to get.++WARM GUANAJA CHOCOLATE COULANT - A molten chocolate cake served with caramel. This was delicious! I love chocolate and it goes awesome with salted caramel. It is a little heavier than the pineapple, but that is to be expected. I also loved the Moscato (La Spinetta 2010 Biancospino Moscato d'Asti Piedmont) which was served with the dessert course.

For the main courses, we chose the roasted black sea bass with the syrah sauce and the duo of beef.  We had just eaten at Le Bernadin the previous day, so my expectations were high for the fish dish.  It was delicious with bold flavors, and possibly a touch salty.  His syrah sauce had so much depth of flavor without being too heavy so the flavor of the fish came through nicely.  The duo of beef was perfectly prepared and promptly devoured by hubs.  Amazing potatoes accompanied this dish.  And lastly, the dessert.  No disppointment here.  We had the blackberry and fromage blanc vacherin (WOW!!) and the nougat de montelimar pistachio cream. Both delicious but it didn't end there.  They brought out freshly baked mini madelines and a plate of assorted petit fours.  After all that, we were given chocolates to finish off the meal.  Its no wonder that this restaurant has received so many accolades.

4.0,5/17/2011,"Daniel is Daniel Boulud's flagship restaurant, and it has 3 Michelin stars, which should represent the very best in its category and warrants a special trip. Bread service was pretty good.  There were a large number of selections.  The olive bread and butter rolls were the best.  Mini baguette could use a bit more crunch.  The butter used with the bread was perfect - had that slight aged sour note that comes in artisan butter.  I'm guessing it was Echire butter.  Frog leg artichoke soup was excellent.  The frog legs were cooked to perfection and had very little gaminess.  The soup was textbook - rich and bright flavors, enhanced with the texture of mushroom.  The trio of veal was cooked perfectly, resulting in tender and flavorful cuts.  However, there were way too many ingredients on the plate, making the flavor profile overly complicated and confusing.  The sesame bavaroise chocolate cremeux was presented beautifully.  The mix of sesame and chocolate was harmonious and delicious - perfect marriage of East and West. The chocolate ice cream that accompanied the dish had a rich flavor, but the temperature was off, as it had already partially melted when it made its way to the table.  The Sichuan pepper gelee (one of the reasons I got this dish) was rather bland and disappointing.  The Taiwanese oolong tea was of good quality, but it was too weak (not enough tea leaves) and the cup was not pre-warmed.  The petite fours were numerous and excellent, with the reconstructed pomegranate tart being the most interesting .  The madeleines were as perfect as usual.  Both our waiters were French, making the French food experience feel more authentic.  Service was professional and smooth, but felt a bit too formal / lifeless.  Sommelier was helpful and made excellent suggestions.  Decor was modern and beautiful, with some Japanese influence in the artwork.  It was clear that the cuisine was contemporary French, but other than that, there was not a unique or compelling point of view.  Everything was delicious, but nothing wowed me.  The one time during this meal where I thought the kitchen was taking some exciting risk (i.e. the Sichuan pepper gelee), it turned out to be mild and uninteresting.  Furthermore, most of the meat dishes on the menu were in duo or trio presentations, rendering many dishes overly complicated, while the fish dishes were much simpler (and often more successful).  It was as if the fish and the meat dishes were conceptualized by two different chefs.  I must say that I really enjoyed my dinner, and I will certainly return for delicious and well-executed French cuisine; but I just don't think it represents the best of contemporary French cooking, nor does it compare favorably to other 3-star restaurants I've visited.",0,0,0,Rich W.,"Palatine, IL",45,100,1

We ended up with a booth against the edge of the dining room which is elevated around the center. Service amazing as expected, I went with the special as an appetizer, a huge serving of foie gras which was excellent. Went with the lamb chop entree which didn't impress me all that much. Dessert so-so as well, chocolate mouse with dulche du leche ice cream. what followed the dessert was a barrage of dessert after complimentary dessert. Honestly though, they weren't so great after such a big meal I couldn't really fit more food in me.

5.0,5/2/2011,"****The pinnacle of haute cuisine****I have been to Daniel three(3) times within a span of 6 years and they blow me away every time.  Daniel offers a wonderfully luxurious experience from the moment you walk in the door.  The service is extremely attentive without being overbearing.  The servers have mastered the art of reading your mind and knowing exactly what you need any when without hanging over your shoulder.Every dish is a masterpiece and stimulates all of your senses.  I have experienced flavors and textures that I could never imagine being so wonderful.  In all of my experiences at Daniel I had only 2 courses that I did not care for - sea urchin and squab.  This had nothing to do with the preparation, only the fact that I do not like sea urchin or squab.  I had them in another restaurant previously and did not like it, but I thought maybe it was that particular preparation.  I had the thought that no matter what it is if Daniel prepared it I'll probably love it.  Unfortunately I confirmed my dislike for those to proteins at a very nice expensive dinner.  It's okay.....always a wonderful experience.5 stars all the way around!!",0,0,0,David E.,"Dallas, TX",229,127,21

5.0,4/18/2011,"Just because it has the same name I do, doesn't mean I'm biased...not in the very least. =)Six courses. All delicious (though . Only one slight snafu - a slightly over salted sauce on the Alaskan salmon. The best of the six (without details because I don't want to spoil the adventure for you): Duck Terrine, Peekytoe Crab Salad, Wild Herb Ravioli, Maine Sea Scallop, Atlantic Halibut, Lamb Loin, Duo of Beef (except for the short ribs which felt underwhelming compared to the wagyu in the same plate), Lemongrass Poached Pineapple and Warm Guanaja Chocolate Coulant. But that's more than six! You can also try all twelve available dishes if you and your companion both get the tasting menu AND specify different courses for each of you.Service, needless to say, is impeccable straight from the time you walk in to the time you leave. Courteous, friendly, professional. Plush cushion's on the benches make leaning back and enjoying your food that much more pleasurable.As for atmosphere, it doesn't feel like you're eating in a 3-star Michelin restaurant. In fact, it felt more relaxing and pleasurable despite formal attire required. It's all due to combination of subdued lighting, the ""home-style"" sundries (such as a traditional, ancient style globe), and classic colors.",0,0,2,Daniel Y.,"Philadelphia, PA",34,186,0
5.0,4/16/2011,"Such a great dinner! We arrived straight from work so we were about a half hour early for our reservation.  We sat at the bar and ordered cocktails - our cocktails were strong and they gave us little olive sticks, which were great. When we were seated, they asked us to leave our drinks and let them bring them to us - which they did, on a little silver platter! Other than a long wait between when we were seated and when we were given menus, the service was impeccable.The amuse bouche was a trio of eggplant bites - one with shrimp, one with salmon, and one puree of eggplant.  The bread was also delicious - I had a garlic roll that was possibly the best bread I've ever had. I also tried the walnut and raisin, which was good, but pretty typical. My boyfriend had a rosemary roll, which he loved so much he ordered again!We both got the special appetizer of Maine Lobster Salad. It was fine, but not anything amazing. I wish we'd tried another appetizer, just so we had something to compare it to.At our server's suggestion, I got the Black Sea Bass, which is apparently a dish Daniel is known for. I was worried that I was wasting the experience by getting fish, but I just wasn't in the mood for meat. I have to say, the fish was OUTSTANDING! I loved every bite. My boyfriend got the lamb, which had an olive crust, which was also amazing. It was a tie for which one of us enjoyed our entree more.For dessert, the menu is split into chocolate and fruit.  I ordered the hazelnut dessert, again at the waiter's suggestion. It was fabulous. My boyfriend got the warm chocolate cake, which was possibly the best dessert I've ever had. A little rich for my taste, but just amazing. They also brought us a greek yogurt and rhubarb dessert because it was our anniversary - they even wrote Happy Anniversary on the plate! It was very nice, and great to be able to try a dessert that we never would have ordered on our own. And, of course, there were a bunch of little extra desserts - a plate of petit fours, a bowl of madelenes, a last little dessert of basil, lemon, raspberry, and cinnamon chocolates.  Overall, a great meal!",0,0,0,Annie M.,"New York, NY",3,75,0
3.0,4/16/2011,"A 3.5 Yelp star only because they are not the same anymore.As a Michelin rated restaurant and how much they are charging for their price fixe menu, I expected an eye popping presentation and a salivating taste for each scoop or bite as part of the overall culinary experience, but with each and subsequent return visit they are loosing the magic touch.I will be taking a break from Daniel and perhaps come back in a year or so. In the mean time, I'm heading over to Le bernardin and Per se.For those considering Daniel for your date, consider alternative as it is usually filled up with business/sales/wall street types enjoying their expense account.",1,0,0,Heidi S.,"Marlboro, NJ",1,6,7
4.0,4/15/2011,"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday after seeing it jump up 33 spots to the #8 best restaurant in the world in Pellegrino's 2010 Worlds Best Restaurant Awards.  According to the Pellegrino list, it is also #2 in USA (second to Alinea).  Daniel also holds 3 Michelin stars, adding to it's repertoire of accolades and awards.  Needless to say, I had high expectations for this restaurant.It is quite beautiful inside, where the main dining room is lower than the surrounding area.  Columns, soft colors, beautiful floral arrangements, large chandeliers, etc. all made for a grand and sumptuous atmosphere.  We decided to do the 3 course pre-theater dinner since it seemed like the best bang for your buck (appetizer, main course, dessert, with 3 wine pairings for $110) and I read on Zagat.com that it would only be available until March 30th (which doesn't seem to be the case, as it's still on the menu online).  I appreciated that this prix-fixe menu offered some of restaurant Daniel's most popular dishes.  I ordered the seared sea scallops with crispy rice, the roasted black sea bass with syrah sauce and the warm guanaja chocolate coulant for dessert and my boyfriend got the peekytoe crab salad with pineapple, trio of milk fed veal (sweetbreads, tenderloin, cheeks) and sesame bavaroise chocolate cremeux with Szhechuan pepper gelee.  The wines were an '09 chardonnay, '08 Bordeaux and a '10 moscato d'asti.  Our amuse bouche was eggplant prepared 3 ways.Everything was solid, exactly what you would expect from a fine dining establishment.  The peekytoe crab salad was really good with nice hints of the bright citrus of pineapple and the sea bass was great with a nice crispy skin and a soft, tender fillet accented nicely with the wine sauce.  The desserts had gilded, interesting touches such as gold leaf flake on the chocolate coulant and a really cool presentation of the sesame bavaroise (it looks like a Kit-Kat with crescent horns...http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=887-WxTKfe6Tcj3o4nNcfQ&select=MPDd_ExrzasswI71jzYmBA).  My boyfriend was then presented with an extra dessert that had a candle, and afterwards we were given petit fours, and after that tiny, button-like chocolates infused with flavors like basil, fruit, etc. and *after that* (whew) were warm, fresh baked madelines (yum).One thing that surprised us was how generous the portions were.  I automatically assume that the portions would be a bit smaller than usual, but each plate had a LOT of food.  In fact, my fish fillet was so big, I let my boyfriend finish it off because I wouldn't have been able to eat dessert if I forced myself to finish.The wine pairings were great.  I really enjoyed the chardonnay, and the server noticed I eagerly drank a lot of it before our appetizer came out and he was nice enough to fill it up again.  Also, I was really happy to get a glass of moscato d'asti for our final course, which is one of my favorite types of wine (it's a bubbly moscato).  Service was top notch, our server was friendly and even cracked a joke with us, which helped lighten the kind of stuffy/formal setting.  We saw Daniel Boulud walking around, talking with several patrons, but it seemed like he was only saying hello to foreigners which was kind of weird.  He went up to a table of Japanese people in the right corner, to the European businessmen next to us in the middle of the room, and the other Japanese businessmen in the left corner.  Shrug.  I thought that everything was very ""safe"", nothing really surprised us in flavor or presentation (aside from that one dessert I mentioned earlier).  I guess I am just a bit skeptical that it is the #8 best restaurant in the world, and #2 best in America, and having eaten at the #1 restaurant in America and feeling like it was a truly once in a lifetime experience, I expected to be blown away or at least find something amazing from at least one dish at Daniel.  Alas, I didn't...but it was very pretty inside!",11,4,5,Laura S.,"Manhattan, NY",171,270,953
4.0,4/14/2011,"For a 3-star Michelin restaurant, I expected a better culinary experience. If the rating was just for the food, I would have given Daniel three stars, but the atmosphere and perfectly orchestrated dance of the serving staff bumped it up to a four. Dining here was like dining at an oasis - peaceful, calm, everyone perfectly poised with impeccable manners. A fellow patron who looked suspiciously like Johnny Depp entertained an exquisitely beautiful lady on the second tier, and the Japanese family next to us clearly had some serious coin. I fleetingly considered asking them to adopt me. We did the 3-course pre-theatre menu - our server made sure each course was timed perfectly and that we were done by the time we told her we needed to be on our way. Excellent idea, as the bf and I were a bit worried about catching our show if the tasting lasted too long. Food-wise, the amuse bouche eggplant trio served its purpose of tantalizing the taste buds, but the highlight of our meal was my boyfriend's tomme dabondance ravioli first course. OUT OF THIS WORLD. Otherwise, however, my selections consisting of a sea scallop first, lamb loin main, and an apple confit dessert were good but left me slightly disappointed. My boyfriend's sea bass had a perfectly charred skin, but he agreed that the caliber of that dish along with the chocolate coulant should have been higher.  My compliments to Chef Daniel Boulud for a very elegant dining experience, but I would have loved to love the food here too. As much as I tried not to, the comparison between Daniel and Per Se (which we dined at the night after) is impossible not to make. Although our bill here was a few magnitudes less than at Per Se, we would have enjoyed dining here more if it had Per Se's refined but relaxed atmosphere and gastronomically amazing food.Press the ""un-mute"" button, Daniel, on both the atmosphere and the flavors, and we'll be back again soon!",1,1,2,Caroline C.,"Troy, MI",329,91,10

4.0,3/29/2011,"I came here in late January for my girlfriend's bday and was pretty excited as this would be my first 3-Michelin experience.  I'm well aware that people really don't put much faith in this point system anymore, but I still wanted to see what it was all about anyway.  We arrived at Daniel 5 minutes before our reservation and were properly greeted and seated right away.  We walked past the lounge which looked very chill, and I could definitely see myself having a drink or two in there at some other time.  One thing that stood out which I enjoyed was that the maitre d', along with the hostesses never looked down on us for being too young (mid/late 20s) to be dining there, although our server did seem a bit bored.  Maybe she wasn't amused by our constant laughter, or maybe she just had a bad day.  Who knows, in any case, even though she wasn't the most pleasant, she still provided top-notch serviceWe each went with a 6-course tasting, and this was the beginning of a three hour experience.  While most dishes were very well prepared and delivered in a timely manner, nothing really jumped at me or blew me away.  Sure, everything was delicious, but this place didn't excite me like SF's Gary Danko did (supposedly inferior with 1 Michelin, and still my favorite restaurant to this day).  I know it has been a few months since I had been there, but the dishes that were most pleasing to me were the PEEKYTOE CRAB SALAD WITH PINEAPPLE Chayote, Cilantro Oil, Coriander Tuile (super refreshing!!!); TOMME DABONDANCE AND MORBIER RAVIOLI Hen of the Woods Mushroom Artichoke, Winter Roots, Lomo Iberico (a cheesy ravioli...i love ravioli, i love tomme...and I mean, I just love cheese.  cant go wrong w/ this for me hahah); and the DUO OF BEEF Black Angus Short Ribs with Beet Marmalade Seared Wagyu Tenderloin Braised Savoy Cabbage Crispy Chickpea Panisse, Bordelaise Jus (AWESOME...much better than my lamb which was a bit too gamey - even for me).  I must add that my girlfriend orders way better than me since she got everything but the ravioli.  Anyway, all this was good then dessert came out.  And then some more.  And then some more.  I mean the dessert is like four parts, and it was all awesome.  I don't have much of a sweet tooth in the first place but it was very tasty and refined, and the best thing to me was the basket of warm madeleines.  I love madeleines, and theirs had a hint of citrus and so light - amazing.  There was a lot of chocolate and other items as well but I don't feel like looking it up through the menu.To sum things up, great experience but I expected more out of a 3-Michelin since my experience was so enjoyable at Gary Danko.  I'm sure a variety of factors played in this, maybe we weren't good guests, maybe our server's blood sugar was low.  In any case, was it a great experience?  Sure.  Was it worth the money, maybe?  Would I go again - probably not.  Why?  There's too many other places to check out!",1,1,0,Chau N.,"Fairfax, VA",79,133,197

It has 4 stars from the Times, recognized by Michelin blah blah blah...so you know it has amazing food, the best staff etc. So I won't blather on too much...but I will share my absolute favorite bites from the evening. The amuse bouche was a trio of spring pea bites--and the center 'bite' of a pea puree was my favorite. Essence of pea has never tasted so delicious! From the hamachi trio (my appetizer choice from the seasonal menu), the tartare was maybe my favorite. Can't go wrong with perfect, fresh tasting fish plus creme fraiche. As for my entree, the entire thing (lamb loin) was perfect. I would expect nothing less than perfectly cooked to medium rare, but it was really one of those dishes were every bite was exciting and enjoyable. And then of course on to dessert, where the boy ordered the orange and huckleberry vacherin, and I tried the chocolate coulant. Just imagine the best and most interesting tating creamsicle for the vacherin, and a perfect choclate lava cake with salted caramel filling for the vacherin. I also thought the milk sorbet with the vacherin was really light and bright next to the heavy chocolatey-ness of the dessert. Then of course the beautiful complimentary dessert tasting, and tiny truffles. My favorite of the entire group? The almond and asian pear bite. Crispy and light with some amazing spices.And now of course I see that I've failed and ended up basically listing everything we ate...but that's really because everything was so worthy of praise!Also of note--the bread. The boy tried SEVEN different kinds! I have no idea how he was able to get up after the meal! I even ordered a second cocktail just because it was so darn tasty (the Bergamot martini). My advice?

4.0,3/3/2011,"Situated on 65th and Park Ave. in New York's Upper East Side lies Daniel, a dining establishment that can be best described as a culinary mecca among fine dining enthusiasts.  If you're perusing Daniel's Yelp reviews, you probably already know that it's been awarded three Michelin stars and a Gayot rating of 19/20 in addition to ranking 8th on San Pellegrino's list of the 50 Best Restaurants in the World for 2010.  The question is whether or not the momentous expectations set by all these accolades are actually met.Upon entering, I immediately noticed the opulent décor along with the instant decline of my feelings of self-worth.  The latter was stunningly reversed by a surprisingly unpretentious, attentive, and amicable wait staff.  After specifying my selections from the tasting menu, the three-hour dining experience I had eagerly anticipated in the months prior to planning my culinary pilgrimage began.[Guinea Hen and Turnip Mosaic]: The baguette slices served with the dish artfully assisted in toning down the saltiness of this extravagantly flavorful course.  The young leeks and pickled honshimeji were excellent accompanying touches.[Trio of Scottish Salmon]: Various delectable interpretations on salmon preparation.  My favorite of the three was topped with a generous helping of what might very well be the most full-flavored salmon roe my tongue has ever had the pleasure of tasting.[Seared Sea Scallops with Crispy Rice]: My absolute favorite course of the night and quite possibly the best protein dish I've had in my entire life to date. If some higher power confined me to eating only one sea creature for the rest of my life but gave me the option of choosing which one, I would undoubtedly pick scallops.  As a result of my self-professed scallop fanaticism, I have eaten a fair share of delicious scallops prepared in a myriad of ways.  Consequently, the following statement should not be taken lightly: the sea scallops I had at Daniel were undoubtedly the best I have ever eaten at any dining establishment.  Packed with moisture and delicately seared, the scallop was nestled on a scrumptiously earthy bed of brown crispy rice and paired with a fennel marmalade and tangerine-safron gremolata.  The perfectly cooked protein coupled with the contrasting textures and the spicy citrusy gremolata was near-overwhelming culinary perfection.  This is most assuredly an honor I do not bestow lightly.[Grilled Yellowfin Tuna]: A solid course but the memory of the previous course's perfection probably tainted the experience for me a bit.  The peppered red wine shallots and roasted salsify worked well with the tuna, but I didn't find this course as a whole to be particularly exceptional.[Duo of Beef]: Another standout course.  The black angus short ribs were tender and the generous portion of sauce was perfectly offset by the clean flavors of the beet marmalade perched at the top, however the real winner here was the wagyu tenderloin.  Accompaniments were comparatively minimalistic but the beef was so mouth-wateringly marbled that it needed little more than a light searing and a classic bordelaise jus.  The braised savory cabbage and crispy chickpea pinsse added playful textural shifts throughout the course. [Warm Guanaja Chocolate Coulant]:  Daintily decorated with gold foil leaf, the coulant's shell opened to reveal a molten pool of liquid caramel seasoned with a hint of fleur de sel.  The warm and sinfully decadent chocolate/caramel duo was complemented exquisitely with a chilled milk sorbet.  This dessert definitely lived up to this self-proclaimed chocoholic's expectations.Following the courses from the menu, we were treated to additional dessert offerings including a dainty set of elegant petit fours and various flavored chocolates.  The highlight of the supplemental desserts was the box of fresh baked madelines, still warm from the oven.  After finishing, our waiter gave us each a copy of our menu from the night (always a nice, albeit gimmicky, touch).A selection of bread was presented before every course.  Since I don't often go to New York and drop over $200 on one dinner, I made sure to try each and every one (what diet?).  The bread was exemplary though I would say the bread cart at Joel Robuchon's restaurant in Las Vegas edges out the one at Daniel.I'm not much of a drinker but I was tempted to order one of the cosmopolitans simply because they are served with a rose-petal wrapped sphere of ice.  I opted instead to ask the party next to us if I could photograph their drinks.  In hindsight, I was very fortunate they were so obliging because that's pretty damn awkward of me.As we neared the end of our meal, we noticed that Chef Daniel Boulud himself was personally greeting every table in the dining area.  When he got to ours, he graciously accepted our compliments as well as our star struck request to take a picture with him.  What a perfect end to an absolutely fantastic meal!",7,2,5,Lesley P.,"Los Angeles, CA",544,46,87
5.0,2/28/2011,"I now know what heaven tastes like. I was finally able to come to Daniel after a few different occasions of making and then canceling reservations for various reasons. And I can say that it blows pretty much every other dining experience that I have had out of the water. First off its fun getting all fancied up to go out, makes you feel like a ""real"" adult. So we walk in and hand our coats to the coat check lady and let the reservationist know we have arrived and from there we were whisked off to a culinary wonderland. First off the dining room is absolutely gorgeous. My fiance and I spent a good deal of time just admiring our surroundings. Nothing is out of place and its all low key understated elegance here. The service is that way as well. Always there but never in your way ready to assist you or clean up when ever needed. To start every thing off we went with the three course meal (the tasting menu looks amazing but my wallet couldn't handle it) and got our drinks. She had the champagne mojito and I had the (non alcoholic) Palm beach which was like drinking perfection. I want to bottle it and sell it its so good.Then the amuses come out and as one person mentioned at the moment it seems to be a tasting of eggplant which I wasn't too over the moon about as I am not a huge fan of it. Well this changed my mind a little. each lilliputian serving was delicious. There was a puree, a serving with lobster and a wee little (I think) napoleon. all were fantastic. Then they brought the bread around and I had the garlic Parmesan and a baguette, both were delicious and crusty. Then the appetizers come out and you see the artistry really come out to play. My crab salad was a little brick wrapped in cucumber and watermelon radish with tiny cubes of chayote running the length of the plate. and while it looked almost too good to eat, eat it I did and it was scrumtrelescent. Just so fresh and light bursting with flavor. My fiance had the trio of salmon and normally we share with each other but tonight it was just too hard as everything was too good to give any up, but I will say that hers looked great as well and I wished I had had a little taste. Then they bring the bread around again and I had on of the butter breads this time and it was heavenly. Then the entrees come out and I had ordered the dover sole. BEST. PIECE.OF.FISH.EVER. the fish was perfection moist flaky with a shrimp mousseline on top and sitting on a bed of black trumpet mushrooms. then to the side a perfectly cooked log of polenta crispy outside and creamy inside all surrounded by a pool of chorizo oil. I will dream of this dish for years to come and they will be the best dreams I will ever have. My fiance went with the trio of veal and since I don't like red meat so much I passed on trying but she was oohs and ahhs all over it, saving the loin nugget for last. then dessert which just killed. I love love love apples and when I saw the honey crisp confit  option I had to go with that and man was I ever happy I did. There were so many different apple applications that I cant even try to describe them all but needless to say my place was clean and if it hadn't been such an upscale place it would have been licked clean. as it was I was sad to leave some remnants on the plate. The fiance got the coconut sphere that is filled with vanilla infused pineapple and basil seeds which are really neat. it sat on a pineapple gelee (I think) and some kind of cookie with a Cheremoya sorbet (very interesting and tasty) and a basil mousse (even more interesting) just a strange and wonderful variety of texture and flavor. and then you think your done ....BUT NO!!! then they bring out the petit fors which I have no idea what was what but all looked like strange alien spaceships full of tasty goodness. Along with those they bring out the madelines fresh from the oven, and oh my god .. I am not a big madeline guy I mean they're okay and all but nothing special. These on the other hand I could not stop eating they were just warm little perfection nuggets. BUT YOUR STILL NOT DONE because after that they bring you a selection of chocolates we both opted for the raspberry and man was it good. So yeah even though my meal only had THREE courses there was still more then enough food to make you feel like you didn't need to eat again for a day or two. But if I was given the option to eat that again right after I would have even if it meant getting sick.Daniel is truly a special occasion restaurant, even if I had the money to eat there more often I don't know if I would, just to keep it feeling as special as it is.",0,0,0,andy W.,"Flushing, NY",137,73,0
5.0,2/28/2011,"The privilege to dine at a 3 michelin star restaurant ranked 8th in the world in 2010 was more than worlds could describe. cnn.com/2010/LIVING/04/2…  I would not trade the 4 hours spent here on a Friday night for anything else. Daniel Boulud, is my hero for the night...but apparently everyone must have Le Accent De Francais to qualify job placement at Daniel..*_*The experience from start to finish was almost a dance performance once I walked through the revolving doors to the coat check and down into the bar/lounge to wait for my entire party to arrive. While sipping on a drink I munched on these delicate crunchy biscuits sticks with little divets filled with olive tapenade. I love the chairs, I want to take one home. Then we were seated in the middle of the dining room like we were hugged by all sides of the wall.... walking though the wide open doors we were welcomed by a sparkly display of Cognac before we were led to our table. It was all carpet...some people may cringe with the idea of carpet, but in this case it muffled any noises from moving chairs or shoes that detered me from enjoying my experience.  Mr. Somelier brought us literally a manuscript filled with wines from all around Europe with bottles that started @ ~$55 - $2500 magnums. We humbly opted for the lower end of things with a wonderful Burgundy Pinot Noir, which went with everything we ate and didn't overpower it. Mr. Bread came around with a smorgasbord of house baked fresh breads..I tried almost all of them cause he literally was dancing around the dining room all night and I finally decided that the butter bread was my favorite where a little piece of butter was placed inside before baking @_@The amuse bouche was a trio of eggplant inspired miniature dishes to tickle the palate, which consisted of lobster, and zatar served on a wooden log that fit right on top of our plate...:)May I just say the waiters coordinated that all the dishes would be presented to us at the same moment in time...speechless! There were an array of appetizers to choose from...I had to have the Foie Gras and was not disappointed...I applaud the chef for this dish...the succulent foie melted in my mouth with every savory bite. I had a piece of the perfectly seared sea scallops and began to float above my body and looked down at myself to see if this was reality. And that was just the beginning.....my entree, the trio of milk fed pork from the farms of Quebec....I truly went back to my Canadian roots here. The crunch of the skin was an event of itself... the thin piece of cucumber that wrapped around the entire dish was very refreshing after a bite of pork...this alternating mouthfeel was quite an incredible match. My friend order the sole...again beautifully presented with tiny pieces of shrimp laid side by side with a lightly seared piece of polenta. Across the table, ma belle ordered the trip of milk fed veal....tender, flavorful and juicy....everything a baby cow should be eventhough it's cruel. ...je suis désolé petit veau..:(The dessert menu was also large...a selection of 8 desserts separated by fruits and chocolat...I mean seriously? Why would you do that, of course I wanted both....and ReyRey always tries to get what she wants...and apparently when there's a will, there's a way! YAY! From the fruity side I got the Coconut sphere with Vanilla infused Pineapple and Basil Seeds with Cherimoya Sorbet and from the chocolate side I got the Nougat De Montelimar with Pistachio Cream, Manjari Chocolate mouse andToasted Almond Ice Cream....Now this was when I thought I died and gone to heaven somewhere after the first and second bite of the nougat! WONDERFUL, MIND BLOWING and once again...I think my heart stopped for a second just to savor this dessert. @_@Once again, back to reality...before I could take my next breath...a silver rectangular platter filled with ~6 petit fours appeared out of nowhere....all different and special...how could we choose? Well, we managed to plop 2 little bite sized goodies in our moouths before Mr. Madeline came up to each of us with a tiny pouch filled with the cutest madelines in the whole wide world!! Warm, vanilla madelines just baked and popped off the mold! OMG!! Such splendor was almost sinful! Finishing my last sip of wine, I thought it was my last breath before we got the check....Boy was I wrong X....Mr. Truffle came with a platter of mini truffles: Lemon, Cinnamon, Raspberry and Basil.....Please take your pick you can have all 4 if you want...Ummm did he really have to wait for an answer? ....I got all 4 :) I guess one thing good and bad about me...I'm really not bashful when it comes to food! I really do live in the best city in America, and to this day after 3.5 years, it still boggles my mind that I live here amongst such wealth of food and culture.",6,3,4,Renee C.,"Vancouver, Canada",401,613,115

The service and presentation: was simply amazing.  From the synchronized chair pulling for patrons and overall service of guests to the detailed cut of all of the servers' suits, the service and presentation at Daniel was unlike anything that I have experienced at a restaurant.  Even if I won't remember the particular details of my meal here, I will always remember the excellent service and presentation at Daniel.The price: expensive, but what do you expect?",0,0,1,Anthony N.,"West Los Angeles, CA",111,69,17
4.0,2/27/2011,"The final meal during my stay on the upper East Side. A walk from my hotel in the cold!! This is high end French Cuisine. Service is impeccable, wait staff is attentive but unobtrusive. Tables are arranged in such a way that you see everything but have a quiet intimate dining experience. Prix Fixe, the French way. Like it! Almost everyone in the restaurant was a couple the night we were there. I counted 2 tables with more than 2 people... so my guess is this is where to take someone you really want to show appreciation and love for! And be prepared to spend.... especially if you order wine.  We did a 6:30 reservation and it started out with few people and by 7:30 it was packed full. Did the 3course Prix Fixe dinner. There was a 6 and 8 course dinner as well.... would have been a cool experience.  I had the fois gras appetizer, amazing melt in your mouth and paired with just the right amount of fruit condiments.... you taste all the nuance of flavor. Then the entrée of veal three ways. I was not as impressed and it was not as good as it looked on the menu. It was overpowered by a blue cheese like reduction or something. It was good just not great because of this (hence 4 stars).  My date had the Sea Bass which I tasted and agreed it was very good. The best part of the meal however was the deserts. Wow! Ordered the Nougat with Almond ice cream... awesome! Everything chocolate looked good too. Would go back when in Manhattan again. Many years ago  I went to La Grenouille  and Daniel is on par with the ambiance and high cuisine. La Grenouille's food was a bit better though IMO.

5.0,2/19/2011,"Nearly delivering a perfect 5 star experience, dining at Daniel was a gastronomic orgy - mostly at the tail end.We came for a belated Valentines meal, our first 3 star Michelin restaurant. I have to thank my friend HDo for his 6 stars a year allocation to his wife for inciting our own 3 star ch ($10oice.With an early reservation, we arrived to a fairly empty restaurant. We sat along the outer edge of the floor level. There were tables on the raised level as well. All lined with dotted textured white table cloths and red flowers. I liked the subtle touches of dots picked up from their logo and applied elegantly throughout - from the neck ties of the wait staff, to the dots on the parting truffles.We started with some cocktails - Basil Haven ($16) and the Bergamot Martini ($16). The Basil is reminiscent of a basil gimlet but lighter in feel. The bergamot was the favorite though, with the orange citrus aroma you find in earl grey tea. Creative. Later we also tried the Jaipur Sour ($16) with curry leaf and pisco, vermouth. This was certainly different with a big block of ice but it's a necessary touch for when that ice melts it mellows out the flavors and make it much more drinkable.We went with the 3 course prix fixe ($105 pp). No a la carte. You could have chosen the 6 course tasting though.The meal began with an amuse bouche trio of parsnip. Parsnip cream, parsnip gele, and lobster with parsnip. All were delightful.Then you can choose your bread from a basket with 6 varieties or so - walnut raisin, french baguette, garlic parmesan, black olive & rosemary, 3 seed grain, and a country loaf. My favorite was the sweet raisin walnut bread. The garlic parmesan was tasty too Would have been nice had they warmed the buns.Now for the meal:I started with Tai Snapper Ceviche with Uni and Caviar in a Cucumber vinagrette. This was light and refreshing, with lots of texture - crunchy shaved beets, soft meatiness from the snapper, and smooth butteriness from the uni (sea urchin). I easily polished this plate off.My man had the Foie Gras Terrine to start - a long almond encrusted block of terrine served with toasted brioche and paired with a bit of sweet pear.Main course was the Daniel signature Sea Bass. Yum!!! The presentation of it was stark - a grilled slab skin side up whereupon they drizzle a syrah reduction on top. That was a crowning touch. The slight sweetness complemented the perfectly grilled sea bass, with the crispy skin that you would actually eat. The sides of potato ring and stuffed leeks was visually interesting - like an exposed tire rim.I also tried some of the Veal Trio - braised cheek (super tender), tenderloin (mmm delicious), and crispy sweat bread (good but not my favorite). While the veal was done perfectly, it was somewhat expected - in the flavors anyway. There wasn't as much originality in that concoction as there was in the seabass.Dessert was where the orgy really started. We chose one from the fruit side - the Coconut, and one from the chocolate side - the Coulant. Again while the Chocolate Coulant is well known, it is also traditional and expected. A molten chocolate cake with gold leaf touches served with milk sorbet and some chocolate crumbles for texture. It was good but not amazing.In contrast I thought the Coconut Basil ball was deliciously interesting. A light airy coconut encrusted sphere is filled with basil seeds and sitting a pineapple gelee graham cracker. Paired with a tangy cherimoya sorbet and more basil cream, this dessert opened up and cleansed the palate.As if those 2 weren't enough, we were also presented with some mini madeleine 'muffins'. Warm from the oven, these little bites had a hint of meyer lemon. Very nice. Then there was the plate of petit fours - maybe around 7 to try. Those were fun to taste. And finally, as you are about to pay, they come with 4 flavors of mini square truffles - raspberry, lemon, cinnamon, and basil.Oh and they serve La Colombe coffee.As I said early, it's a gastronomique experience. Loosen your belt and wallet but enjoy the impeccable service. Daniel was delightful - could have used some music though but I can see why it earned 3 Michelin stars. Now I just have to go to a few more to fully understand the rating system! ;)",1,0,1,Cindy W.,"Burlingame, CA",306,708,47

4.0,2/10/2011,"It's quite an experience, eating at Daniel. From the moment we were sat at our table for two at the edge of the square restaurant, sitting next to each other and looking out at the rest of the restaurant (to make it extra-romantic, or so you can see and be seen?), through the highly formal French-style service, to the basket of steaming complimentary madeleines which arrived with coffee, it was a long and impressive meal. Long and impressive in equal measure, actually - the food was amazing (my favourite being a brilliant starter of mackerel three ways), but the courses just took too long to come, so after sitting there for three and a half hours (for just three courses!), I ended up with a terrible headache and not a drop of wine to drink with dessert.So it's 5 stars for the food from me, minus 1 for the length of time it took to get it!

The first was that prior to the last two visits the bread server was continually circulating through the rooms replenishing the delicious rolls until we said no more. Now, it's a one-off dole. Similarly, there were dozens of chocolate treats at the conclusion of prior meals - Friday 4 tiny (5x5 mm), though delicious pieces.The service continues to be outstanding and the food delicious, yet I hope that these small changes are not forebodings of future deterioration in quality.",1,0,0,F F.,"Coconut Grove, FL",1,21,0
5.0,2/4/2011,"The place has three michelin stars, so you really don't need my opinion on the food. If you go here, it will be one of the best meals you will ever have in your life, that is unless you can afford to eat like this on a regular basis, in which case I'd like to marry you. Instead I will just leave you with my recommendations:Don't bother with the regular menu. Get the tasting menu. There are two options for every course, so just go with one other person and get one of everything and share. And don't say the tasting menu is too expensive. If you're shelling out the money to go here what's another 80 per person to get the best stuff?Get the wine pairings too. They pay someone a lot of money to make these perfect pairings, drinking is part of eating, take advantage of the opportunity.Prepare yourself for the level of service. I myself am not an aristocrat, so I was unprepared for the fact that they brought over a stool nicer than any piece of furniture I own to rest my girlfriend's purse on. That is just how they do things. They will make you feel like a king, which, if it's not something you're used to or fully prepared for, can be somewhat awkward.It's unfortunate that you have to finish everything they give you (it would really be a shame not to) because when you get the madeleines at the end of the meal you can't help but eat every one of them to the edge of nausea because they are that good.If you are even on the fence about going, stop being such an idiot and just make the reservation.

I did my research and Daniel looked to be the perfect place to toast her special day.Daniel is exactly what you would expect from a Michelin 3 star restaurant. The service is stellar, the dining room classy and the food was obviously incredible. We were both completely blown away by Daniel. We arrived for our 7:30 reservation and greeted upon entering. We were seated right away, but after a quick look in the bar was kind of hoping they would give us a few minutes to enjoy cocktail. Oh well, looks like we'll have to suffer through a couple glasses of Champagne at our table. But if you do go, plan to arrive early as it appeared that the bar might be a place you may catch a glimpse of a celebrity.My wife and each went with the three course (splitting a cheese and dessert course) and wine paring. This may not sound like a lot food, but trust me if they allow you to wear sweat pants with elastic you are going to need it. The food just keeps coming and coming and coming and coming. As you can expect, there are those little unexpected  ""extras"" from the kitchen. Dessert alone was five courses which included our original order, a special birthday surprise, a plating of macarons, a selection of chocolates and finally a basket of freshly baked madeleines.

3.0,1/23/2011,"I know, I know.  People are going to see this and think, ""of course, someone has to be contrary and overly picky just for the sake of being picky"", but that's not the case at all!  this review is more akin to a parent chastising a top performing child for bringing home a B+; yes, it is a perfectly acceptable grade for many people, but not for someone who should be pulling in A+'s.  That's sort of how I felt about Daniel's.  When I am visiting the purported 8th best restaurant in the world, holder of  3 Michelin stars, I am expecting to be wowed.  When they are charging for a meal for two what some people pay for rent, then I'm going to be a little picky. Was the meal and experience wonderful?  Yes.  Was it the best meal and experience ever? Nope!For example, the service.  It was very formal and practiced, silverware changed after every course, etc.  Fine, great.  But we had to ask for more bread (twice), more butter, my water glass was empty several times, & at one point, my wine glass was empty for so long, I assumed we had already finished the bottle!  Aside from those missteps, the service was excellent, and the pacing of the meal was perfect.  It was a very relaxed pace, allowing us to enjoy each course. I started off with a white cosmopolitan, which, like everything else, was presented exquisitely.  A martini glass is presented.  Inside the glass is a jaw breaker sized ice ball with purple orchids frozen within.  The drink is poured from a mini-carafe into the glass.  The drink was very light and refreshing and tasted very yuzu-y.  It was very good. The amuse bouche was a trio of sweet potato served on a 3 tiered tray- sweet potato puree with a spicy potato stick, sweet potato and smoked salmon, and sweet potato and grilled octopus. They were all delicious, but the salmon one was my favorite. They offer about 5-10 different types of bread.  We sampled the cheese and garlic, the salt and butter and the baguette.  The breads were delicious, but were surprisingly not warm and oven fresh; they were served room temperature. We chose the 6 course tasting menu and alternated our choices for all of the courses except for the red meat and dessert courses. For the first course, I had a guinea hen and turnips mosaic and also tried my fiancee's duck terrine with honeycrisp apple.  Both were served with toasted brioche. They were both beautifully presented and delicious.Next course was a trio of scottish salmon for me: poached and topped with large roe, tartare with a sesame crisp and smoked and topped with watercress- although it looked beautiful, aside from the roe bursting in my mouth, nothing stood out.  Fiancee's peekytoe crab salad was good, but had a lot of pineapple in it which overpowered the dish, imo.Onto seared scallops with crispy rice for me, and tomme de l'abondance and morbier ravioli for him.  My scallops were good, but slightly undercooked, tbh.  The ravioli, on the other hand, was AMAZING.  They were creamy, perfectly cooked little pillows of heavenly yum!  I was jealous I didn't pick this dish.Next, I got slow baked dover sole and he got grilled yellow fin tuna.  The sole was good, tasted almost poached, topped with shrimp, yummy little crispy polenta cubes, and the cutest mini mushrooms I have ever seen!  Again, the dish was good, not amazingly great.  Same for the tuna.Last savory we both chose the duo of beef: short ribs with stewed lentils and wagyu tenderloin with onions and carrot confit.  The short ribs were delicious! Perfectly cooked, great flavor and the lentils were the perfect creamy partner to the short ribs.  The wagyu tenderloin was very tender, as expected, but was lacking the amazing flavor of the short ribs. For dessert, we both got the warm guanaja chocolate coulant, which came with caramel, fluer de sel and milk sorbet.  The coulant was like a mini lava cake, but was slightly overcooked and a little dry.  The accompaniments were perfect, and the sorbet tasted like ice cream to me.  It was a decent dessert but nothing very unique.We had ordered coffees with dessert, but they were brought out after the dessert course, during the ""extra"" desserts.First they brought out a mini dessert for my birthday, it tasted sort of like a spicy, gingerbread type of cake, served with tiny balls of poached fruit, ice cream and sauces. The candle was stuck in a little jelly candy.Then came an assortment of petit fours, about six or seven altogether, followed by madelines (delicious, citrus flavored mini beignet type of pastry) and lastly, 4 mini cubes of homemade chocolate: cinnamon, raspberry (my favorite) and I forget the other 2.Overall, the meal was delicious and beautifully presented.  The standouts to me were the ravioli, the short ribs and the madelines.  The decor was romantic.  But I could find a similar meal/experience for half the price.  Sorry Daniel, but glad I visited so I could see what the hype was about!

5.0,1/9/2011,"Not a particularly name-following ""foodie"", when people throw around certain culinary celebrity nombres, I usually blink a few times and ask if their fare is tasty. However, when my friend Alix casually mentioned that her father was Daniel Boulud, restauranteur, I immediately demanded that we try this place. Unfortunately this was in Paris several years ago, far from the UES, and I did not get the opportunity to eat here until recently. However, the wait was absolutely worth my while. For an appetizer, seeing as I had decided to lean into the whole ""French cuisine"" thing, I had the duo of Florida frog legs, fricasseed with Kuri squash, chanterelles, pine nuts, crispy lollipops, black garlic, and Tahoon cress. It was cooked just right, which is important with frog legs - too much and the flavor is lost, too little and they have a bit of a gross froggy elasticity to them. These were jussssttt right. Also part of the appetizing course, the table split a 50g bowl of Israeli Golden Ossetra (caviar), which is also normally not my kind of chow, but was revelatory nonetheless. For my entree, I had an AMAZING pair of Four Story Hill Farm Guinea Hens, braised a leg-chestnut cannelloni, honeycrisp apple roasted and with a Brussels sprout fondue. The undertones of apple mixed with the richness of the poultry and the garnishings was almost too much - I hadn't eaten lunch this particular day, and something that hearty was the best thing I could have hoped for. Finally (although a bit stuffed at this point), I indulged in a honey crisp apple confit for dessert, replete with cinnamon sable.Overall, it was an absolutely lovely evening, made more so by some of the best food I have had in quite some time (cheers, Papa Boulud), and of course, a great deal of fantastic French wine.",2,1,2,Campbell K.,"Manhattan, NY",78,79,64

5.0,1/8/2011,"Great restaurant, most distinctive decor, and best serviceRecommended: * Duo of beef - the wagyu tenderloin and short rib were tender, savory, and flavorful. Flawless. * Sea scallops appetizer - plating was absolutely beautiful with delicious green elements (baby bok choi, gremolata, broccoli tempura, etc). Scallops were superbly tender without fishy taste. * The garlic bread in the complimentary selection of rolls. Wonderful piece of browned garlic inside and dried garlic on top.* Ice cream - the caramel ice cream on our dessert plate had a amazingly intense flavor with a delightfully understated sweetness. The milk flavored ice cream was also very good.* Gingerbread in the poached pear dessert (see below).* Took home the madeleines, they were great warmed up the next morning. Small and fluffy with a light citrus aroma.Just okay: * Sea bass with syrah sauce - everyone recommends this but the flavor of the syrah sauce was not as intense as I would have expected. The fish was well cooked but I think it's hard to make black sea bass an impressive fish, as it lacks the airy flakiness and subtle sweetness of a black cod or chilean sea bass. A good dish but was looking for more.* Poached pear dessert - I was expected a whole pear but got pear balls (the size of melon balls) that I wished were more firm or had more flavor. That said, the gingerbread in the dish was a positive surprise as it was super moist and not very sweet, without being overpowering on the ginger side. Service was perfect and friendly.

For dessert, the chocolate and peanut butter ganache definitely stood out from the rest.  In addition, we were given a dessert amuse-bouche of several little pastries, as well as a freshly baked bag of mini-madeleines that were passed around to each of us, then placed on our table.  It was an amazing ending to a fabulous meal.  Overall, Daniel was flawless, but we didn't expect anything less.  It's definitely a 2-3 hour experience and for serious foodies, worth every penny.",0,0,0,ampdgal G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,45,2
5.0,12/24/2010,"There are so many NYC restaurants that become so hyped that it is virtually impossible to live up to the expectations you have when you walk in the door. Fortunately for me, my expectations were kept in check by a few nay-sayers, which Daniel seems to have its share of.That said, my experience lived up in spades. First, I actually found the decor to be quite a step up form many of its peers. The dining area is MUCH nicer than Per Se, Jeans George & Bouley. And the table we had was amazing, looking out over the entire room. The canapes were just okay but four out of the six courses were excellent. From the duck terrine to the Dover sole to the Duo of beef and lastly, the finale, a chocolate caramel volcano- Just incredible. Now, I know a lot of people expect that everything should be excellent at a place like this and for prices like these, but that's seldom been my experience and 4 of 6 is pretty damn good.We also had the wine pairings which I highly recommend. The only one that seemed a touch off was the Dover sole, but so many were spot on and only made the meal that much more special.And last but not least, the service. This might be my only major nit and I've seen other people say it- The staff really comes off as if they are trying SO hard to be perfect- But they most certainly are not. Reaching across the table, dropping things, taking your plate before you're done- They need to hire the guy who trains servers at Thomas Keller restaurants.But apart from that- a must for high-end foodies.

3.0,12/16/2010,"I have a strong faith in the Michelin guide. In general if a restaurant has 2 or 3 stars from this guide, I know exactly what to expect in terms of quality of food, service, etc.. So much do I have faith in this guide, that I would be prepared to spend the small fortune that this restaurant costs again, just to see if my meal there was perhaps an anomaly. I went to Daniel for the first time two days ago for my 29th birthday.  The meal was by no means bad, and parts were really excellent. But given the price point, and the comparison to the other top-tier restaurants I've dined in (Le Bernardin, Jean-Georges, Del Posto, Le Bec Fin, and Schwa come to mind) the overall experience was somewhat disappointing.I was first put off by the pre-fixe iteself. I realize that a 3 course pre-fixe is standard in many places, but I want more from a place like this. Bernardin offers 4 courses, Del Posto and Le Bec Fin 5, Schwa has a standard 11 course tasting. I want to try many smaller things in a place like this, and 3 courses just doesn't cut it for me, especially when one course will be a dessert which I already know I won't care about.That said, you ALWAYS get more than what is advertised at a place like this, so I wasn't too worried. What WAS disappointing was that neither of my courses were all that memorable. I started with the trio of mackerel (I figured if I cant have different dishes, I'd at least get different preparations of the same dish). 2 of the 3 settings were completely unmemorable, only the middle selection, mackerel caviar served on some unidentifiable tower of something proved to be a wonderful bite. My main was quail, stuffed with fois gras. This dish suffered from an actual fault in that it was wrapped in bacon that completely overpowered the quail and fois gras and I wound up deconstruction the dish so the good bits wouldn't be wasted. I ate quail, with a side of fois gras and bacon. Then they served us 1000 desserts.  The desserts we ordered were followed by an extra small dessert arranged for my birthday, which was followed by a selection of 6 petit fours, which was followed by a large basket of home made Madelines, which were followed by home made chocolates.  Maybe this would float your boat if you are a sweet fiend, but I am not, and found myself quite annoyed that 50-60% of my meal, in terms both of filling me up and time spent eating was dessert. The booze was a more successful affair. We started with a cocktail in the lounge which was probably the single best thing I had in my mouth that night. It was called Bitter for Better or something like that, and if you dig the negroni school of cocktails, this is for you. Go have it at the bar anytime just to try it. We did the wine pairings with the meal and the wines were each excellent, the stand out being a 1999 (tempranillo?) from Rioja.  At first the pours seemed very stingy, and I was pretty upset when they poured the second glass of wine and then didn't serve the main course for 15 minutes. By the time it came, my half glass was gone and I was really not looking forward to shelling out an extra chunk of cash for something else by the glass, but the waiter simply came back and refilled my glass. Well when I realized that THAT was how that was going to work.......When I dine at a restaurant like Daniel I expect transcendence. Obviously not every bite of food will do this, but at each of the other restaurants mentioned above, there was some moment, some bite that when it first hit my tongue, gave an overwhelming pleasure, somewhat akin to an orgasm, where awareness of all other things goes out the window and you are completely enveloped by the single sense of taste.

5.0,12/7/2010,"Culinary creativity, authenticity, and quality at its best. Daniel Boulud really has done it, and done it with grace. Much credit goes to his executive chef Jean Francois Bruel, who made that particular evening so memorable.The interior design of Daniel is homey, cozy, and yet refined as opposed to grandiose. The lighting fosters a soft atmosphere, neither too dark nor too bright. I happened to be seated at a table along the wall of the room which was perfect! Our particular location maintained privacy and intimacy for the night since we weren't sitting amongst a sea of other diners and yet we we felt the warmth and light buzz of chatter from the other patrons.Service was impeccable: friendly and light hearted. Our servers were professional and yet personable, who provided a truly welcoming and transforming experience. We eventually exchanged stories with one of our main servers about Paris, ours about our travels there and having gone to school there, his about his previous job at another fine dining restaurant and his family.I cannot dissect Boulud and Bruel's menu for that night, take the dishes apart into their individual ingredients or possibly describe the joy of tasting the various sauces and small bites of contrasting, surprising, and comforting textures. The presentation and plating of the food was artfully done and truly beautiful.Let me say this. If your wallet permits at some time, consider Daniel's tasting menu and don't over think things. Be seated at this magical restaurant, and order whatever tickles your fancy and stimulates your palate. Don't worry about what others deem the most celebrated dish and instead order to what your heart desires. Less thinking, more eating.The three michelin stars are well deserved at Daniel.

Scallops were decent, lamb loin had a great sauce but was tough to cut even with fancy Cristofle knife and coconut poof was interesting, let's leave it at that.

5.0,11/7/2010,"Love it!First, we stopped at the bar and ordered some drinks. The margarita with strawberry pearls was amazing! The dirty martini was ok.. They have a huge list of wines, as large and confusing as the bible, but if you are not a wine expert, the best thing to do is to order a three course paired with wine.To stimulate your palate, they bring you a sample of three appetizers recommended by the chef. Then, you start with your own choices. I ordered sea scallops a la plancha, a duo of four story hill farm guinea hen as the main course and a chocolate dessert (don't remember the name). They were just perfect! Despite that the food was delicious, the service could be better. Our waiter was a bit impatient-nervous and not very kind.",0,0,1,Carolina S.,"New York, NY",7,21,0
3.0,11/3/2010,"I am really puzzled by the reviews here. I am so puzzled I started my own account (as opposed to the usual anon. stalking.) and gotta put in my two cents. I'd like to think it's just me, but its the entire table last night. People I dined with are from all over the world, different socio-economic status, but all have pretty good experiences with ""amazing food"". Why is everyone raving about this????I really, really, really wanted to love it. Actually, I wanted to love it because I wanted to impress the people I brought with me. I wanted them to have an orgasmic experience because they loved eleven madison park, they loved gramercy tavern, chicken rice, traif, you name it, many many other amazing new york trademarks.Oh Daniel, what can I say.I can't say I had high expectations, I was so busy that day I didn't even think about it until half an hour before I had to get out the door- I literally threw on something and left the house. Since we were four people, you can't say it was because I ordered the wrong dishes (and shouldn't every dish be amazing anyway?)Here's a breakdown of what we had:The tasting palate was around eggplant. They all tasted bleh and nothing refreshing or ""new"". The BreadNot bad, high end restaurant standard but definitely not the best I have had. Appetizers 1.Scallops - mediocre, I'm NOT saying they wern't good but just mediocre. Nothing made me tear or nothing made me blurt out mid-bite ""this is really, really good"". It was good, yeah, but not extraordinary. 2.Squash Soup- pretty cute presentation but it was lukewarm and pretty blend tasting. Maybe I like my stuff with more taste...like a ""punch"". I'm not saying blend can't be good, you can be subtle and still flavorful. 3.Mackerel- not bad, I'd rank it a 7 out of a 10. Again, nothing WOW (3 michelin stars...come on!!!)Main1.Duo of Beef- ""good"", ""not bad"" were the words murmured on the table. People talked a whole lot and not a lot of silent enjoyment was going on there. First sign the food's pretty average. If you tell me this is a pretty solid good restaurant, I'd say yeah it is. But Daniel could definitely compare to Centolire in UES. (food wise)2.Suckling Pig stuffed with veggies: nice idea, crispy skin, but the fact that I am trying really hard to come up with something to say about this is...self-explanatory. 3.Salmon- pretty solid.Dessert:1.Apple tart- innovative design but not really impressive. Taste isn't bad, but again not worth the 3 golden stars.2.Chocolate coulant- it's great, it's good, but go to a dessert place like Chikalicious and the taste would just seem subpar. Presentation is minimal...nothing special.3.Peanut Butter and Chocolate Ganache- As a pb and c mad fan, I can tell you I enjoyed it. The caramel ice cream tasted good but not something that would induce automatic response like an involuntary muscle spasm or closing one's eyes...the ganache was very rich, but nothing wowzer.Service:great, can't complain, on par with most restaurants this hyped up.Decor:great, can't complain, on par with most restaurants this hyped up.But overall:I'm here for the food, dude. You didn't tickle me fancy, I can list 100 restaurants off my head that either compares or shines next to Daniel, so I'm just so sorry, but yelpers need to hear an alternative opinion.I am not saying I am right, but hey, I am really pretty self-aware and I can tell you I really don't have a crazy high expectation or standard. I absolutely loved Eleven Madison Park, and this is, unfortunately, shit compared to it. Maybe it was a bad day for the restaurant, maybe my group was all unconsciously high or something, but the spark wasn't there.I tried DB's extension in Beijing and I can say that was really pretty good for China's standards. But even then, it was pretty mediocre for ""Beijing's best restaurant""...and Daniel is totally comparable to the Maison in Beijing. They both had those warm madelelines which was quite nice. Like I said, ambience is great, but the food is bleh, which defeats the purpose.",3,1,1,Lia M.,"Manhattan, NY",234,4,0
5.0,11/1/2010,"I should have written this review a while ago. As some of you know, I have a huge backlog of things to write down, and since I've dined here, many things have happened with Daniel.In good news, they gained their third Michelin star. Congrats to their team for that. In bad news, Charlie Sheen tried to bang a porn star in the restroom and ended up completely naked with cocaine all over his face. This is shortly after he dropped about $12K on two bottles of 1959 Chateau Latour. Wow. Now why didn't this happen when I was there? I definitely would have made for some awesome stories!After having binged at a few other of NYC's three star Michelin places, was I doing to be sick of tasting menus? Hell no. I am just way too obsessed with food and if I'm going to drive myself broke, dining is going to be one of the top possibilities. So it was a no brainer that we were going to see what they were churn out.  With a handful of canapes to start with, the menu proceeded as follows:-Roasted Foie Gras, black mission figs, spicy hazelnuts- Duck Terrine with Honeycrisp Apple, Sicilian Pistachios, Golden Raisin, Pickled Barberries, Celery Salt-Peeky Toe Crab Sald with persian cucumber, black sesame coulis, early mesclun, radishes-Fennel-Basil Ravioli with Littleneck Clam EmulsionShrimp, Cuttlefish, Broccoli Rabe, Chorizo-Hazelnut and chorizo crusted Maine sea scallops,  stewed gnocchi, corn fricassee, nasturtium salad-Veal Loin ""à la Viennoise"" With crispy sweetbreads, Jumbo Green Asparagus, Caramelized Pearl Onions-Hazelnut Mousse with Gianduja Biscuit, Milk Chocolate, Salted Caramel Ice Cream-Crunchy Succès with Coconut Madras Curry, Poached Pineapple, Passion Fruit Chiboust, Lychee Sorbet-MignardisesThe food was definitely excellent across the board. Though we did notice out of all the other restaurants in the same class, Daniel was the most conservative in it's cuisine. I guess Chef Boulud's roots still shine through and that's not a bad thing. Luxurious ingredients treated with respect, but not overdone. Strangely enough, though the service also seemed the most traditional in many ways, the servers were more relaxed and so were many of the diners. This surprised me as often times when you go to establishments like this, people are stiff as a board all around. This is a dining experience, one should have fun! One of the quirky things I learned here before seeing it other places, is that the ladies get little fancy chairs for their handbags! I know this is a fancy place and all but at the time that just seemed over the top. I guess those are the little things that you provide when you've take your cuisine to the top level. Again, this isn't just dinner, it's an experience.",12,5,7,Kim N.,"South Bay, CA",3020,9832,66435

5.0,10/18/2010,"My.  Daniel really was beautiful.I have had the luck of trying all five of New York's Michelin 3-star restaurants, all of them with my mother.  In that very small and exclusive group, I would say that Daniel is vying with Thomas for the top spot.  My expectations going into our dinner were sky high and I was not disappointed.The dining room was gorgeous, serene and elegant, softly lit and tastefully furnished.  The service was impeccable - it was very formal, but our main waitress was friendly, charismatic, and even lightly chatty.  We didn't do wine pairings with our meal, but instead our waitress selected a few different wines for us based on our tastes.  She let us split glasses, and even gave us different half glasses for one course.The food was brilliant.  We went with the six-course tasting, getting every option between the two of us, for a stunning $185 per person.  If I ever have that kind of money to blow on my own, I'll be happy to spend it at Daniel.Our amuse bouches kicked us off with a beet tasting.  First was a yellow beet salad with horseradish cream and candied walnut, then a borscht with a duck prosciutto-wrapped crostini and cucumber pearl, and last a lobster salad with potato gauffrette, beet coulis, chive aioli, and microgreens.  Each one was tiny yet packed with flavor, leaving us hungry for more.  We chomped on great breads - raisin walnut, olive rosemary, three seed, and oh, garlic parmesan - and waited for the rest to come.The first course brought a duck terrine with mango, pistachios, sauternes gelee, and young salad, as well as a quail and black trumpet ballotine with plum mostarda and farm vegetable salad.  The terrine was silky and rich and the ballotine pleasantly meaty.  Both were served with crostini, on which we spread our birds with greed.Next came a light course hailing from the sea.  A trio of Spanish mackerel exhibited the excellent fish warm with a cumin carrot mousseline, in a tartare with caviar, and poached with white wine gelee.  The tartare especially was exquisite, sleek and briny, but each preparation was worthy of a bowl-sized portion.  The crab salad with cucumber, black sesame coulis, mesclun, and radishes was another triumph, packed into a dense cube of sweet crab that was a pleasure to tear apart.The third course took things to another level.  The hazelnut and chorizo crusted scallops with stewed gnocchi, corn fricassée, and nasturtium salad was unlike any pig and scallop dish I'd ever had before.  The scallop was cooked to a marvelous point of softness just this side of too ethereal.  The hazelnut and chorizo gave the dish a complex flavor profile, nutty and meaty yet ultimately a little bit sweet.  The gorgonzola and mesclun tortelloni was even more magnificent.  Served with tomato confit, caramelized walnuts, capers, and some truly extraordinary snow peas, it was subtle despite the gorgonzola and full of impact despite the subtlety.Next came fish.  Specifically, mind-blowing halibut and bass.  The halibut was slow baked and served wit chanterelles, Tuscan kale, oregano jus, and a potato quiche.  The halibut was perfect.  I've never seen a piece of fish look so evenly white.  The fillet looked like it had been topped with cream.  It wasn't, and instead the firm flesh of the fish was finished by the flavorful kale and a few small but effective mushrooms.  The flaky black sea bass with velvet syrah sauce, leek potato parmentier, and roasted tempura celery seems to be a Daniel signature.  I have no problem with that.The meal flagged with the last savory course - I was not smitten by either of the meat dishes.  The lamb loin, served with tandoori-spiced shoulder, minted ratatouille, ricotta gnocchi, broccolini, and zucchini flower tempura, was obviously tasty, but also heavy and forgettable.  The duo of beef was better, but still heavy and a bit incoherent.  It consisted of short ribs with young spinach, mozzarella-bresaola salad, and wagyu tenderloin and stuffed tomato with basil.Dessert brought sake-poached pluot with almond biscuit, vanilla plum gelee, and Concord grape sorbet, a warm Guanaja chocolate coulant with liquid caramel, fleur de sel, and milk sorbet.  The pluot was refreshing and tart and pleasant enough, but the coulant knocked my socks off.  It was the best chocolate dessert I've ever had, rich and dark and deeply sinful.  We also got a third off-menu dessert of gianduja hazelnut tart with hazelnut ice cream.  It was less noteworthy.We were then showered with buttery mini madeleines and mignardises - a sake plum macaron, blueberry agar agar, passionfruit agar agar on lemon cream, crunchy hazelnut, chocolate tartlet, yuzu cream and candied lemon, all in a pretty row.  We got chocolates in a box to go, dark, praline, toasted sesame, and Grand Marnier, all of which I savored in L.A. as I remembered this grand meal days later.  If I still had even one tiny madeleine, I would try to bite into it and recreate my Danie experience.",9,6,9,Steph C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3889,3532,94
5.0,10/15/2010,"So much has been said here that I'll just try to emphasize the one thing that I think sets Daniel apart from the (very few) other restaurants in its class, the service (to be clear, the food was essentially perfection.  others, however, have said this more articulately and descriptively than I can).I've only had service like this once before.  Anywhere.  And I don't mean that it was formal -- I'm not sure how they managed to do this, but the service was at all times completely on-point, without being the slightest bit stuffy: it was perfect in a way that I think only a tiny number of places in the world can match.  It sounds strange to say, but the service made us feel comfortable, and I went with a group of people (myself included) who understand and appreciate fine dining, but whose usual budgets tend more towards the $2 slice of pizza.",2,1,1,Jason L.,"Brooklyn, NY",76,101,1

The food is just great, even compared to French standard. The guy definitely deserves 2 michelin stars (3, I'm not sure).Another style, but definitely on par with Le Bernardin.Also, yes, it is not cheap, but for that kind of food (in a gorgeous setting - which kind of reminded me of hotel George V in Paris), it is remarkably reasonable (think 150$ a head w/ tax/tip but no wine).

3.0,10/12/2010,"I took a friend for a celebratory 25th birthday dinner and we had a very nice meal.  I absolutely loved their cheese cart!  The service could have been better and I had the feeling that we were treated as second class citizens because of our age (asking for water glass to be refilled, etc).  When the bill came, I paid with my credit card.  The card ended up being declined which our waiter and head waiter loudly announced to the whole dining room.  I politely advised that there must be a mistake and immediately started calling my credit card company.  During that time, my guest said dont worry I will pay and provided his credit card.  Now we were surrounded by 3 waitstaff.  My credit card company was not only telling me there was nothing wrong with the card but that they didn't even see that it had been scanned.  My friend's card was declined and now he was getting upset because of how they were treating us and the situation when it was clear that the error was occurring on their end. I advised them what my credit card company had stated and they said they would run the card again.After about 10-15 minutes (and many people staring the whole time) they came back with the bill saying nothing or even apologizing.  What had started out as such a wonderful evening became an embarrassing situation that was all due to error on the restaurants part!  I have not been back to the restaurant since and will not return.  I have told my friends and colleagues this story and now am telling you Yelpers.  As much as I enjoyed the food and especially the amazing cheese cart, I cannot return to a restaurant that doesn't even offer an apology.",7,0,0,L R.,"New York, NY",0,21,0
5.0,10/9/2010,"Daniel.Before now, the only time Daniel ever came up as a possibility for me was during spring break, 2004. Some friends and I were doing an eating tour of NYC that'd included such heavyweights as Sushi Yasuda and Peter Luger. Then one of them proposed, ""...Daniel?""""NO!"" I said, as definitively as I've ever refused anything. We were 21 years old! Still suckled to our parents' teats! Daniel was arguably the ne plus ultra of formal French dining in NYC. I felt that it was absolutely inappropriate for us, 3 stooges pretending to have taste.That instinctual response stayed with me through the years. I became a fan of Daniel Boulud -- his DBGB is a great all-occasion eatery, and Cafe Boulud has extraordinarily clean cuisine -- yet the flagship was intimidating in its total commitment to the haute. So I felt oddly mixed when my sister declared that our family was going as celebration for a couple of birthdays. Surely everyone else deserved the trip, but what had I done in my life? Had anything changed about me since I'd put my foot down back in 2004? Would it ever feel ""right"" to go?Not that I hadn't built up some fine-dining cred in the interim. My most direct touchstones were from the other NYT 4-star tasting menus, all of which show unique strengths. For me, Jean-Georges does it best, inspiring gasps of surprise that release into golf-clap applause. Per Se creates an enveloping experience during that parade of perfectly paced plates, an immersion chamber of high cuisine. And Le Bernadin's purity of execution and unwavering respect of the protein is a wonderful thing. Where would Daniel leave its mark?Daniel first hits you with a Park Avenue burst of moneyed opulence: its dining room. That alone guarantees I would never be comfortable there. Then again, I wouldn't have been comfortable with Grace Kelly on my couch, either, but do you think I'd complain? Regardless, there's a time-capsule quality to the room that's as much old-NY as Katz's. Not my kind of beauty, but splendid nonetheless. Service is well choreographed, but that's not the same thing as Per Se's effortless perfection in that department. The real magic of Daniel, then, is right where it should be: on the plate. The flexible tasting menu offers 2 choices for each of its 6 courses. I sampled each, but I am assuredly not a fine-dining specialist; I can add nothing to Frank Bruni's stellar 2009 NYT review. I will highlight a trio of Spanish mackerel, each of which was a miracle unto itself (crisped on a cumin bed, tartared with caviar, and poached into what must be God's REAL version of gefilte fish). A duo of beef also impressed: a chunk of Wagyu tenderloin finally doing honor to those coddled cattle, and the greatest short-rib prep I've ever had, dissolving over a scattering of lentils that popped in the mouth like champagne bubbles. The only major off note was a bacon-encrusted monkfish tail that somehow managed to be undersalted, which goes to show you that even Daniel's missteps are fascinating. Flavor profiles were otherwise virtually flawless in their classicism, and thus safer than the higher risk-reward explorations of J-G.But Daniel's distinguishing trait from the other august tasting menus is in the plating. Not the kind of thing I usually pay much mind to, but when done well, it can become as important to a dish as a soundtrack is to a film. Daniel does it extraordinarily. Forget the fact that it's food: it transcends that. Bursts of primary colors. Brushstrokes of glittering sauces. Cloudy wisps balanced upon each other, and not in the teetering towers of the wannabe New Americans -- truly balanced. Visual textures playing off each other in complex patterns.Take the speck-wrapped scallops, a variant of which appears everywhere. But find me a single other one where the cobblestoned appearance of caramelized endives echoes the Maillarded scallop, which in turn gradients out to a pumpkin seed dusting whose matte finish contrasts perfectly with the reflectiveness of a glazed Jerusalem artichoke. Much has been made lately of food porn, but this is food art in the most sincere application of the term.Beautiful and somehow a little sad in the way that some beauty seems self-isolating. Grace Kelly again jumps to mind. You want to tell her that she should just let go, that she doesn't have to be the Princess of Monaco, but you know that to take that isolation away would also rob her of that which makes her exceptional. A curse, but oh, what a memorable one. Too many Grace Kellys would be emblematic of a pathological society. But to have zero would be a terrible loss. So it is with Daniel.Probability of return within 1 year: 0%",5,2,7,Lawrence C.,"New York, NY",82,215,0

It's probably the only restaurant I have been to where you are still required to ""dress"" for dinner (Jackets for guys).  If you don't, even the runners will be better attired than you.  Bring the most elegant handbag you own, they have little ottomans just for you to rest it on.  During the course of the meal, no less than 6 people attended to us.Now the food:  Your 3-course prix -fixe expands to about 5 if you include the amuse bouche (3 tiny tastiings of beets today, including lobster and hazelnut).I had the chorizo-crusted scallops (excellent) and the lamb loin (also wonderful).If you have a sweet tooth, you're in luck.  The desserts are broken down into chocolate or fruit (easy for Hubby to get right to the point).  I had a 'coulant' which was a high-end version of molten chocolate cake which oozed salted caramel...They bring you a basket of warm madeleines straight out of the oven next, which are buttery and rich.Someone comes by next with an offering of chocolates (I had the Grand Marnier, Hubby had sesame)Your meal ends with a tray of petits fours which includes tartlettes of chocolate, fruit, yuzu, coconut and French Macaron.   I'll be dreaming of this for a long long time..",4,0,2,Mariana L.,"New York, NY",362,606,196
4.0,9/18/2010,"To celebrate my birthday I decided to book a reservation at Daniel. Every once in a while you have to treat yourself and this was an excellent excuse to enjoy an evening of great food. If I were to equate surfing with being a foodie, perhaps I would consider myself to be somewhat of a soul foodie.  Less focus on the ambiance and service, and much more on the food. Does the food leave a lasting impression...in a good way? While each dish was exquisitely presented, there were only a couple that really stood out above the rest.  The first was my appetizer -stuffed baby squid on top of a salad with aged balsamic dressing and feta cheese.  The second was the duo of beef - 1) black angus short ribs with young spinach mozzarella-bresaola salad, 2) wagyu tenderloin, stuffed tomato with basil, and 3) black garlic pommes dauphine, sauce choron. The stuffed tomato in particular was wonderful. Upon returning from my evening at Daniel I began to ponder my experience, and have come to realize that this type of food is like a cool toy. It's very interesting to look at and play with for a short while, but lacks a bit of soul.  I find that my most favorite places to eat are like a good friend that I can't wait to see again.  Daniel is not one of those places.  Objectively I have to give them 4.25 stars, mainly for presentation that was a work of art, as well as for an interesting food experiment.",2,0,1,Gregory C.,"San Francisco, CA",93,204,23

4.0,9/15/2010,"I was taken here after a whirlwind day.  After being proposed to in Central Park in the morning, I didn't think my day could get any better, until I was surprised with dinner at Daniel.Upon entering I had a delicious White Martini (I think?) and it had a gorgeous ball of ice with an orchid frozen in the center.  My fiancé had a champagne mojito - yum!The staff was aware of our engagement (my fiancé had told them ""if we show up - she said yes"") and had us all set up at in a wonderful semi-private booth overlooking the restaurant.I was actually shocked to see how reasonable the prices were, becuase with food like that, he definitely could have charged more.  Everything that I put into my mouth was amazing, including the complimentary warm basket of Madeleines they give you right before your check.  The wine list is something I've never seen before - had the best Pinot Noir of my life.The ONLY gripe I have about this restaurant is that my father called and tried to order us a bottle of champagne and in order to do so he had to fax in a copy of his credit card and a signature?!  He was out celebrating himself (in another city) and clearly did not have access to a fax machine at 10:00 p.m. at night in downtown Chicago.  So.. we didn't get our bottle of champagne, which is their loss because the cheapest bottle was around $200.00.I would definitely go back - such a wonderful place to celebrate a special occasion.",0,1,0,Mollie H.,"Chicago, IL",4,107,0

I highly recommend not breaking the 3 or 6 course prix fix with say 2 out of three courses because they will hammer you on the 2 courses and you end up paying more than 3 course would have cost. the girls didnt get desert thinking they would save a buck or something and the bill was about $50 more than it should have been. i think they charged her $40 just for her salad.   Have i had better meals? yes. have i had a better experiance? probably not.   bon appetit",0,0,0,stefan s.,"Mamaroneck, NY",4,13,0

It took me so long to write the review because I wanted to make sure the meal really was memorable & I wasn't going to write the review & give the restaurant 5 stars 'coz of the impeccable service & the hype associated with it. I went to Daniel with two of the most special people in my life to celebrate a number of very special reasons & the dining experience was bilssful. As we sat, the servers placed small little stools/ottomans next to each of us (the 2 girls) for our purses/clutches. Chic. The lighting, music...all so classy & understated.The food...ahh...the food...was excellent. The bread basket was great. We had the 3 course pre-fixe. My 1st course was the Duck Terrine (foi gras). OMG..so good, so smooth. It melted in my mouth...The tagline of this dish really should be I can't believe it's not butter. Flavorful. My friends got the Scallops & the lobster respectively & loved it as well. For the main course, I got the veal trio...this undoubtedly was my favorite course & I will say that it was the best veal I ever had. Each of the 3 ways the veal was cooked...was cooked to perfection. The flavors were distinct & yummy. My friends got the lamb loin & the duo of beef respectively...they were so very very good too. For desert, I had the chocolate & peanut butter ganace...OMG...the chocolate was making love to the peanut butter...I can still taste it. Yummy! The other 2 deserts oredered on the table were great as well.Now, another best part after the 3 courses...they served us the best madelienes (cute, fresh, small, yummy)...I have ever eaten. So good. We loved them so much that they packed the 2 girls cute lil boxes of madelienes...aahh...so good...I cherished those madelienes 4 2 days after & kept eating them. The other pallet cleansers/ tasting appetizer/tasting desert was nice too.& the service...PERFECT. Not too in your face...& just enough so that you remember the wait staff. Amazing. The wine list was good too. The only tiny -ve will be the cocktail list as the 2 cocktails we did try were just about average. I guess the food & the wine list + the service is to swear by. Cocktails - maybe not.Lastly, it surely was one of the most expensive meals of my life. But, the price was worth it.This is such a long review but it was required to fully express my love for the dining experience at Daniel. I will wait to go back though...maybe a wait till the next bonus. Love it. :-)",1,1,1,Sonia C.,"New York, NY",10,27,0
5.0,9/9/2010,"4.5 actuallyI flew from Seattle to eat at Daniel.  I think it was well worth the trip.  Yes, it can be a very pricey, especially if you get the wine pairing, which i did, but the dishes are amazing.  I recommend it for one of those special occasions and not just a, hey-lets-get-dinner-with-a-friend sorta thing that i did.The amuse bouche was a trio of beets.  I am not a huge fan of beets but i am now.  The flavors that he was able to coax out of the bit size pieces of red veggie were amazing.  It was perfect to go with one other person as the tasting menu has 2 options per course, so we were able to get the entire menu.Other favorites from the tasting menu was the duo of beef, the scallop, and the lamb dishes.There was one disappointment on the plate.  The lamb dish came with two preparations and the one wrapped in the filo dough was pretty darn dry.Other than that the food was great.Service was interesting.  There was only two of use but the server was confused and gave each person the other's dish.  It was no big deal and they fixed it after that.  there was one other oddity.  We were at the tables lining the outisde of the sunken dinning area.  You basically sit between the wall and the table. there is not much space so if you ever need to get up during the 3 hour meal to use the bathroom, a server has to come by and slide the table away from you.  It wasn't bad, it wasn't good, it was just interesting and funny as at one point me and my friend were trapped behind the table as she was trying to get to the restroom.",0,0,0,Thai N.,"La Mirada, CA",91,6,4
4.0,9/8/2010,"Daniel is one of those must-eat places in new york and while im still basking in my poast daniel food coma, i can honestly say that it's pretty much worth it.  Even though we got off to a slightly rocky start, Daniel truly won its way back in the dessert round. but let's start from the very beginning...the atmosphere is really nice...for such a highly ranked restaurant, you'd expect a stuffy atmosphere (a la spago in beverly hills), but it was actually quite warm with tables that are situated so you can enjoy the atmosphere without being in your neighboring tables' business.  the wait staff is definitely reminiscent of a quiet symphony, with coordinated and timed presentations.we started with an amuse bouche of a taste of broccoli, which involved a bite of lobster with potentially the smallest morsel of broccoli, broccoli puree, and seared eel with broccoli.  the lobster was good, the puree was decent, and the eel wasn't really anything special.  i started my meal with a peekytoe crab salad that was topped with some type of cucumber and sesame seed jelly, and my dining companion (my mom) started with the seared scallops.  after tasting her scallops, my crab salad didnt have a chance.  the scallops were full of flavor, paired with small bite size gnocchi and corn.  so good.  the crab salad, on the other hand, was pretty bland...the flavors werent strong enough to keep me incredibly invested in it.  the bread selection was more than anyone really needed, but after tasting the garlic parmesan and the olive and raisin, the breads werent as soft as expected...nor was the butter.on to the main course! my mom got the black bass, which according to our waiter, was one of chef boulud's specialties. i dont eat fish, so i cant truly attest to its greatness, but my mom absolutely loved it. according to her, the fish melted in her mouth and she was completely pleased with her dish.  i chose the veal trio that involved three different parts of the cow cooked in 3 different ways.  one was seared, one was in a shortbread, and the last was braised.  as expected, the braised veal was delicious.  the other two were decently tasty, but nothing that truly blew my mind.up until this point, i was mildly skeptical of the greatness of daniel as the portions were smaller than expected and the quality of food was good, but not amazing.  then came the desserts.  the fact that there is an entire menu dedicated to desserts (half for fruits, half for chocolate) shows that daniel is serious about the last course.  my mom got the papaya dessert which involved cilantro-infused papaya balls, paired with an almond biscuit, meyer lemon cream, and guava sorbet.  it was amazing.  and i dont even like fruit that much. i chose the carmelized hazelnut samble with a dulce de leche ice cream.  it came with a chocolate mouse that had a type of crunchy bottom. it was literally death by chocolate but so heavenly.  as if the desserts werent enough, though, our waiter came with a small dish of mini desserts as well as freshly baked mini madeleines!  they were still warm and were so delicious.  by the time i finished my dessert and ate a few mini desserts and pretty much half of the madeleine basket placed at our table, i was nearing food coma.  to top things off, our waiter came with a selection of truffles that included flavors like hazelnut, dark chocolate, sesame, and one last one that i cant remember.  just for kicks, we got one of every flavor but could only manage a bite of each. the dark chocolate was definitely my favorite...so rich but so light at the same time..in only the way super dark chocolate can taste.post meal, i definitely give daniel as a whole 4 to 4.5 stars for service, atmosphere, food quality, and portions.  while the beginning of the meal was overshadowed by other amazing restaurants, the desserts truly brought it back up to exquisite dining standards.",0,0,0,Melissa N.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,156,18

The scallops were perfectly done and served with hazelnuts which tasted amazing. My bf loved his grouse. It was a little too gamey for me, but we both loved my lamb. soooooo good. Dessert may have been the highlight of the whole thing. Get the warm chocolate cake. it's impeccable. However, I think the one at cafe boloud may have been better. Then came the warm mini madelines.

I had the duo of beef for $16 supplement. The wagyu beef is just tender and cooked to perfection (@ medium-rare). The duo of squab is also very very good, especially the breast meat, so tender and juicy (with oil, yum!).

There I had a coke served together with interesting ""breadsticks"" with triangular shaped filling.We were first presented with an amuse bouche based on peas. We ordered from the Summer Prix Fixe menu. The appetizers were scallops with a bubbly corn fricassee and Nasturtium leaves as well as a trio of mackerel with caviar.The main course consisted of veal prepared three ways. I chose medium rare. The taste and texture of the meat was astounding. The three types of meat were presented on a square plate in a diagonal fashion. The types included a mildly seasoned as well as a heavier seasoned version with sauce. White asparagus as well as artichoke pieces framed the veal. Jus was separately added by the waiter. The other main course at our table was sea bass, also exquisitely prepared.Periodically, a waiter would offer bread from a selection of at least six different types, including walnut raisin, black olive, French, and foccacia.For dessert, we had chocolate cake ""coulant"" with a molten center consisting of chocolate and caramel. Edible gold leaf topped the ""coulant."" Vanilla ice cream contrasted with the chocolate.Although we were full, next came a delightful silver plate with more desserts. These included chocolate made to look like a tiny pie complete with a ""crust,"" a mini vanilla macaron, a peanut butter based dessert, tangy white creme with caviar, and an interpretation of a s'more with a tangy creme filling between two tiny wafers.Although we thought this was the end of the meal, more chocolate desserts were then presented.

There wasn't one detail overlooked during the entire 3+ hours we were there. Napkins are re-folded if you go to the bathroom and plates are removed in unison. Every detail is intricate and calculated. Bravo! Okay... now onto the FOOD: -- Amuse bouche - The theme was beets.

Such a delicacy!) -- Hazelnut & chorizo crusted Maine sea scallops w/foam.

5.0,7/15/2010,"It should be obvious from all the other reviews that the food is awesome.  My husband and I ordered the six-course tasting menu (mine was vegetarian) with wine pairings and this was the best meal of our lives.  We rushed to Daniel right after landing in NYC to start our long weekend off right and we couldn't have made a better choice.While the food was outstanding, the service was exceptional.  It's always the little touches that make such a difference.  Our server, Charles, was very knowledgeable and personable and made us feel very welcome at our first New York meal.  When I mentioned that we were in town to see my brother off to join the Peace Corps and taking him to Eleven Madison Park the following day, Charles offered to call over there and let them know that we would be coming.  It was such a nice gesture and my brother was very appreciative for the farewell wishes.We could not have asked for a better night and have seriously contemplated flying back for another weekend just so we could dine at Daniel again.",0,0,0,Lisbeth D.,"Chicago, IL",3,76,0
5.0,7/14/2010,"What to say that hasn't already been said about Daniel? This was a phenomenal dining experience. I have never in my life spent 3+ hours dining and drinking. I have also never been so blissfully tired from doing so.If you're lucky enough to be able to afford to come here on a regular basis, I would recommend eating a la carte and ordering off their extensive wine list. However, if you're like me and probably get the chance to dine here only once or twice, go whole hog for the six course tasting menu with wine pairings. (If the additional wine pairing is too expensive, just get the tasting and one bottle of wine.) Though the portions are small, it is a tasting menu and you will not go hungry. Besides, the food is divine. Just melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I wish I had remember to ask the name of the pinot noir that came with one of the courses. (Think they'd remember if I wrote them?) It was just... I can't even... I need a thesaurus for all the words that mean delicious, divine, savory, sweet, intoxicating...",3,0,2,Abigail M.,"Brooklyn, NY",155,231,8
5.0,7/12/2010,"We recently had dinner at Daniel to celebrate my birthday.  It was a big hit with our entire party.  The restaurant's design was gorgeous (well appointed, understated, yet comfortable).  As much as I wanted to take photos during this meal, my upbringing fought with my brain & told me ""DO NOT!""... and I saw the watchful gaze of my brother, reinforcing just that.  Anyone, who knows me, knows I have a passion for dishes... and I went simply gah-gah over the exquisite Bernardaud dishes that were obviously custom-made for Daniel.  They made me giddy with excitement!  I had to fight myself to not turn over the dish to be certain who created the work of art (a battle also monitored by my brother... which I DID give into... and was nearly publicly chastised for... but it was worth the risk!)  I was anxious to see how the rest of the night would play out.Our service was nearly flawless.  From the little tufted stool, that was quickly & discreetly placed under my handbag, to the attentive but unobtrusive table service.  The staff at the Plaza Hotel needs to have a meal here to be ""taught"" how guests should be treated.Every plate was a visual treat!  Although the food was excellent, there was room for improvement in some of the dishes.  This being said, it was still wonderful food.  Our amuse bouche was a trio of watercress delights... EXTREMELY delicious & entertaining to the eyes.   Next I had the spot prawns baked on rock salt... beautiful and delectable flavors & textures... but I expected a bit more flavor from the shrimp themselves.  My husband had the duck terrine which he loved.  My main course was the sesame & bonito flake crusted black cod with Yukon gold potatoes & glazed asparagus.  This dish had a lovely combination of flavors... not positive I loved it as much as the black cod I had at Ame... but delicious still the same.  The Japanese sea bream was chosen by our party as well... the service was quite an event.Dessert was its own little feast.  I ordered the gianduja sable with Nyangbo chocolate & hazelnut ice cream... luscious ... but the winner was the ""surprise"" birthday dessert they brought out like dessert ninjas... which happened to be my second choice for dessert (tho' they did not know this).  This heavenly bonus was the coconut lemongrass soup with mango gelee & coconut sorbet... oh be still my heart!  If this wasn't enough, out popped the tray of petit fours... and then citrus madeleines.  I thought my head would pop off in glee!  Each taste was fantastic (however I have to be honest that my lovely San Fran friend, Miss E, makes better madeleines)!   Just when we thought there wasn't room for a wafer thin mint... we were offered a selection of various flavored truffles.  I nearly burst into hysterics since I was so utterly (and wonderfully) stuffed.Food and service were nearly flawless... a very teeny bit of room for improvement... but it was a superb evening on all accounts.  I look forward to the next visit!",1,0,1,J K.,"Columbia, MD",2,10,0
2.0,7/9/2010,"My friends and I came here for my husband's birthday.  We were a party of 8 which is the most they seat I hear.  We sat pretty comfortably too.  We all opted for the three course meal which made us all pleasantly full since we received amuse bouche as well.The decor is impeccable, very classy. The ceiling had some nice detail.  When we stained our table cloth, the waitress quickly came over to cover it up so we didn't stain our clothes.  At first, I felt embarrassed thinking she thought I was a slob but then understood the reasoning.  I removed two stars for what I consider a BIG BIG mistake. My husband and his brother both have seafood allergies where if they ate some, their throats would close up.  The food allergy was stated twice.  First when making the reservations and second when the waiter came over to take our orders.  He even confirmed it twice.  A few minutes later, they came over with the amuse bouche and luckily my brother-in-law spotted the fish in his (lucky because it's small and not very easy to tell).  Both him and my husband had fish in their amuse bouche.  I think this is a grave mistake as food allergies are dangerous. The food was very fresh and tasted good. My favorite for each course was (I did not try everything on the menu so take this review with a grain of salt): - App: Gorgonzola Fedelino and Musclun Tortelloni - Entrée: Black Sea Bass with Syrah Sauce (good but did not wow me) - Dessert: Strawberries in Citrus - The amuse bouche was delicious.The crabcake salad was ehh, nothing special outside of looks.The third star came off not because of the food but because of the bill.  We had 8 people and they charged us for 9.  That's an additional $120+.  That's a lot!  With that many courses, and that little parties of 8, it should have been clear that we were only 8 people.  It took them forever to correct the bill.All in all, I don't think I will be returning. The atmosphere was comfortable because we had so many people but if it was just me and my husband, I would have felt a little stuffy there.  The food was good but did not wow me for the amount we spent.  I would pick Eleven Madison Park over Daniel any day.",2,1,0,Cora G.,"Queens, NY",64,12,5
5.0,7/4/2010,"My recent trip to the USA was built around food and I kicked off proceedings in New York at Daniel Boulud's flagship 3 Michelin star establishment.I am grateful to Yelp for introducing me to so many Yelp friends around the world and a wonderful feature of my trip was being to meet so many of them in person and to share food and time. In New York, the 'Mighty Mouse' football-loving (soccer to you Americans!) Dana F was my charming dining companion.Daniel has deep classical French cooking roots but with very modern presentation - if you want to work up an appetite, just go the restaurant's website and salivate over the enticing pictures. Let me assure you that the dishes look just as good in real life.The restaurant space is huge and the kitchen must have a large efficient brigade to cope with so many covers. Dana and I had a great view of the dining room from our corner table. The vibe is one of elegant sophistication and you'd be advised to stick to the jackets for men rule or you'll feel very under-dressed.From Dana's review, you'll know that she was very impressed with little tables for ladies' purses!There are several ways to order at Daniel with an a la carte menu being supplemented with a tasting menu. What's nice is that each element of the 6 course tasting menu offers a choice of 2 dishes for each element. Even before arriving, we had already decided on the tasting menu and as there were 2 of us, we were able to try more dishes between us by exchanging food when we ordered different dishes for an element - don't think too many people frowned when we did that or maybe they didn't see us!Service was very slick and swift with dish announcing and napkin refolding on restroom visits being of the top standard expected at a 3 star Michelin establishment.The food was cooked to perfection technically and classical flavour combinations proving why they have survived the test of time. The stand-out dishes were a melt-in-the-mouth wagyu beef, cooked enough to medium rare perfection and some huge scallops, which had their natural sweetness enhanced with some heat and crunch from a chorizo crust. Expect top notch classical cooking and you'll go away very happy.They had some nice surprises at the end of the meal when they produced an extra dessert to congratulate Dana on her recent promotion (should come in handy to pay the bill!) and the famous madelaines, which I hadn't heard about but Dana had been eagerly anticipating, having heard about them from a fellow Yelper. These arrive warm from the oven and the server must have heard her squeak of happiness on receiving the first batch because we were presented with a second basketful.This was a great way to start my gastronomic tour of the USA.

5.0,6/30/2010,"We went all out & got the 6 course - there were some other dishes that looked intriguing, but we wanted the greater variety. Have to say, the meal started weak but got better with each dish.Decor: simple & modern. The center of the restaurant is a few steps lower than the surrounding area. We had a table on the edge, & it's nice you get to kind of ""overlook"" the restaurant. There was this cute little leather stool by the half wall where I could put my purse.Service: impeccable! Very formal. To give you a few examples: I took a few extra seconds to look at the cocktail menu & a woman came by to help me choose. I think it was someone's job just to see if we left the table & to make sure to pull out our chair when we came back. I spilled my drink & our waiter almost immediately came by to clean it & put a fresh napkin on the table. I did have to ask several times for club soda to clean a stain though. Each course was timed perfectly. There was someone to clean off the bread crumbs after each course.Sidenote: Our waiter had a really strong Spanish accent (at a French restaurant). We found it hard to understand him sometimes. He was still amazing, always tending to our every need & patient through all the times we asked him to repeat, ""what's that great thing I just had again?""Drinks:-Summer in Paris - sweet & light, refreshing, which is what I wanted. Flavor wasn't really unique.-Champagne Mojito - delicious! Never tried a mojito as a bubbly.. I don't usually love mojitos but really enjoyed this one.6 course tasting menu:- Duck terrine with poached rhubarb - found this rather plain & forgettable. Poached rhubarb was interesting.- Mosaic of lola duck, porcini & red wine gelee - once again, not incredibly impressed. Rapeseed vinaigrette was pretty good.- Trio of spanish macherel - this came with Carrot Mousseline which was delicious. Everything else was good.. not particularly memorable.- Peekytoe crab salad - a good crab salad to say the least. Not spectacular.- Hazelnut & chorizo crusted maine sea scallops - absolutely delicious! The scallop was cooked perfectly - you could slice right through it, & the flavor was impeccable. The corn was a really nice touch, added a bit of sweetness. & we kept wondering what that extra bit of meat was in the sauce - so tender & delicious - it was the chorizo!- Artichoke raviolini in saffron sauce - very delicious creamy sauce. I'm not usually a big fan of pasta in white sauces but this one did the trick for me.- Grilled yellowfin tuna with vadouvan - really delicious & unique dish. We'd never had hawaiian hearts of palm & it added the perfect amount of texture to the fish.- Black sea bass with syrah sauce - sauce & fish were really good. Leek potato 'parmentier' was like a spoonful of mashed potato, but shaped to look fancy. Roasted & tempura celery - surprisingly good! Especially when both of us usually hate celery.- Elysian field farm lamb loin - WOW this was good. Meat was cooked to perfection, the tadoori flavor & ratatouille all went so well with it. The gnocchi was delicious too. We were so intruiged by the zucchini flower tempura - it was such a tiny slice but had so much flavor!- Duo of beef - absolutely delicious. Can you tell I'm a fan of red meat? & you get TWO cuts here. The ribs were so tender & soft & just fell apart under my knife - wow - & the quinoa was a nice touch, added texture & mixed well with the sauce (spring onion confit in red wine - so good). Tenderloin was perfection. Asparagus w/ tellicherry pepper jus was a nice touch on the side.- Warm guanaja chocolate coulant - every upscale restaurant has this dessert, & I always love it without fail. Daniel does this a little differently  in that the chocolate cake was a little harder on the outside, & the inside wasn't super melty - it actually made the dish easier to eat (rather than getting a big sloppy mess of chocolate all over your plate), the slight bitterness of the dark chocolate was perfect, & the milk sorbet was heaven.- Coconut lemongrass soup - wow!! What a surprise - as much as Iove chocolate, I think I actually liked this dessert better! There were just so many tantalizing flavors - the poached pineapple was a really nice treat, & the gelee, & the coconut sorbet... I just loved everything about this dish.- We also got about a million amuse bouche's. All really good. Incl. a really nice ""Happy Anniversary"" dessert one(we were asked at the beginning of the meal if this was a special occasion & we made one up. Hey, we were spending over $200 each)PROS:- Impeccable service. A million people tending to you. Very very formal.- Must haves: Main sea scallops, lamb loin, duo of beef, coconut lemongrass soup.CONS:- Expensive. But worth the one trip.- Depends on the atmosphere you like - this place is VERY formal but I never felt like I was being judged for not knowing all the details of proper table manners/ lingo/ behavior.",2,0,2,Ziyan C.,"San Francisco, CA",83,2073,9557

5.0,6/22/2010,"I went here with my boyfriend Brian for our 5 year anniversary. First time & hopefully not the last!SETTING: We were seated on the same side of the table (against the wall) so that we were overlooking the whole dining room. Usually, I hate sitting on the same side as Brian but I didn't mind this setting so much. This place is different from previous french places because my favorite spots usually have a warmer, more rustic feel with dim lighting. This felt a bit more modern, slightly brighter and so I thought it was telling of the food to come - non traditional french fare.FOOD:We opted for the eight course tasting menu but decided to go without the pairings. There were so many dishes but I'd like to list my favorites:1. MOSAIC OF FOIE GRAS & BLACK ANGUS BEEF CHEEK - I enjoyed this dish thoroughly. foie gras was perfectly pink & tender and the beef cheek was really tasty.2. HAZELNUT &CHORIZO ENCRUSTED MAINE SEA SCALLOPS - I LOVED THIS! I like scallops anyway (as long as it's not well done, ew) but this is definitely a far cry from any pan-seared-with-glaze version I have ever had. scallops were tender & perfectly cooked, the hazelnut didn't overpower but was a perfect backdrop. Chorizo just added a bit of crisp with every bite.3. WARM GUANAJA CHOCOLATE COULANT was really good. the only thing is that this is the last course and with 7 tiny, rich & savory dishes preceding it, it's difficult not to be overwhelmed with it's richness. I think I would have enjoyed it better if I wasn't ready to fall asleep on the spot.*also note that after all this, they offer you a tray of an assortment of bite-sized chocolate as well as a basket of warm madeleines. we had these with cups of tea & I was never more ready to get home and snooze for the rest of my life.SERVICE: The waitstaff were great. We had two waiters and they were doting on us (probably because we were like the youngest people there). Every course was served with great presentation as sauces were being ladled and the mix of ingredients were being explained. This was definitely soemthing I'll never forget and I'm glad we spent our 5 year anniversary here. Maybe for our 10 year, we'll aim for Paris!PRICE: The whole dinner came out to around $300+ per person. Obviously, it's for a special occasion so I think it was definitely worth it. Dinner took about 3 hours so it's definitely not something you go to just for the food but for the whole experience!xoxo",1,1,2,Paola S.,"New York, NY",247,131,50
5.0,6/20/2010,"I was delighted when Yee Gan O. asked me if I would be interested in dining at Daniel with him - he didn't have to ask twice!  For weeks leading up to the event - and dinner at Daniel is truly that, an event - I was excited as could be.How does one put one of the best meals of their lives into words?  I can write and tell you about it, but the words do not do the experience justice or paint the picture of a phenomenal meal.The service is exquisite.  Everything was perfectly timed: when plates arrive at the table and time elapsed between courses.  One of our servers (the guy who describes the food), asked if we had any special occassions and I mentioned my promotion.  At dessert, he brought out an additional dessert - a crisp wafer cradling hazelnut and chocolate mousse, which a dollop of ice cream, and the word ""Congratulations"" written on the plate.  The waiter and the sommelier did an exceptional job as well.  Everyone had an air of sophistication without being pretentious.With 200+ reviews, I probably don't have anything new or insightful to say with respect to the six course tasting menu and wine-pairing. The chorizo crusted scallops and the duo of beef were the stand-outs, although I thoroughly enjoyed the trio of Spanish mackerel and black sea bass.  The Barolo went perfectly with the beef - so harmonous.  Little touches, such as the amouse bouche of beet three ways and the petit fours at the end of the meal made it even more special.  As Yee Gan is well aware, I thoroughly enjoyed the madelines as well (and managed to save a few to take home)!And not to worry - there are little purse tables so you don't even have to put your handbag on the floor.Thank you again to Yee Gan O. for extending such a wonderful invitation!",2,1,2,Dana F.,"Queens, NY",665,925,146

I don't like sweets but could eat these all day.Service: polite, friendly, not overbearing, not overly or underly present at the table.  I did feel very well taken-care-of, though, by the fact that staff were CONSTANTLY patrolling.  At one point, we counted the seconds between someone going by and making sure everything was ok via discreet sidelong glances and use of peripheral vision.  It was never more than 5.  My only complaint: the rosemary/olive bread was stale. :(So aside from that bread:  the theme is:  PERFECT.  If anyone insists on giving me a condo in the Mayfair & making this my canteen, I will accept.",1,0,0,Georgiana M.,"New York, NY",10,209,1

Daniel is a beautiful restaurant with irresistible charm and sophistication. The food is straightforward haute french cuisine living up to the three michelin stars and the recent james beard award. Service is impeccable and unmatched. Architecture is both elegant and grandiose with greek-style columns and arches adorning the main dining room. We made a last minute reservation for the lounge and a la carte it up. We started off with cocktails. I ordered a white cosmopolitan served in a martini glass with a sphered ice cube and a hibiscus flower inside it. The server then poured the martini into my glass over the ice. What a refreshing drink!  I was tempted to order the 'strawberry and pearls' margarita ($30!) but held off for the wine to come. The wine list is superb and can take hours to study the scoures of desirable bottles. Daniel also offers a solid by the glass option for diners that do not intend to splurge. After cocktails, we were presented with a quadruple tiered amuse-bouche consisting of the tiniest and most delicate I don't know whats; seemingly they tasted like beet, sweet potato, hamachi, and octopus.  Next came the Duo of Beef entree which included short ribs with quinoa and wagyu tenderloin with black trumpet mushroom. This was such a visually stunning dish. The short ribs were heavenly and paired with an asparagus puree and a razor thin slide of avocado. The tenderloin was cooked perfectly and well season. We then gave our waitress some preferences for cheese and out came four decadent selections. I was happy to find out that two of the four were not from France, but Napa Valley (go cow girl creamery!). Suddenly our initial mediocre cabernet blend opened up and complemented the cheeses beautifully. Our waitress (who was french) then helped us navigate the extensive dessert menu. She was straightforward and told us to order the Chocolate Coulant (the first item on the menu). Embellished with a gold crusted flake, the warm chocolate salted caramel cake was perhaps the best dessert I have ever ordered. What a memorable dining experience. Truly deserving of all the hype.

The oyster was to die for and the uni tapioca (made to look like Ikura) was a nice surprise and very innovative.SEA SCALLOPS: Morel  Mushroom Fricassée, Swiss Chard, Green Peppercorn Sauce - This was probably the least favorite of my dishes. Was a pretty good scallop but I would have liked more of a crust/sear on it. Good but not great.SEA BASS with Syrah Sauce: This was a buttery, delicious black sea bass cooked to perfection and served with an amazing rich syrah sauce that surprisingly complemented the fish perfectly!DUO OF BEEF: Short Ribs with Quinoa, Wagyu Tenderloin with Black Trumpet Mushrooms - Good but not my favorite dish. The meat was cooked well but I didn't particularly think the sides added anything to the dish - the quinoa was not very flavorful and the onion rings were just ok.Chocolate cake: SO good! I don't usually order warm chocolate cake at restaurants because they always taste the same and i want something more  interesting. But since th eother option was not appealing to me (lemongrass soup) I chose the chocolate cake.  It was delicious dark chocolate flavor, cake exterior and warm and oozy inside. Hint of sea salt which balanced the sweetness. Vanilla ice cream with crunchy chocolate bits hidden beneath made the perfect combination with the soft and creamy ice cream balanced by the crunchy and slightly bitter chocolate crunchies. These are the details that make Daniel worth the $$$$.SERVICE: From the moment we walked in service was perfect and exactly what you expect from a 3 michelin star/NY Times 4 star restaurant. We had about 4 waiters serving us, all food presented at the same time, napkins re-folded, no wait for butter or water. They basically anticipated everything we needed but at the same tim were not breathing down our necks. The only snafu we had was at the end of the meal when we ordered our coffee and it didn't arrive until way after we got desserts - not acceptable, but when we notified them of this they brought us each new ice cream servings (since they had melted while we waited for coffee) and a plate of desserts. Altogether the service was amazing.AMBIANCE: Upscale and very nice but not really stuffy or old fashioned - modern dark decor with nice bright red flower  bouquets for accents. Very large dining room, not really on the romantic side but definitely special occasion. I really loved it!WHAT TO WEAR: Men must wear jackets! If you take it off they make you put it back on! Women were mostly wearing cocktail dresses. Lots of old men with women half their age here!! Makes for interesting dinner conversation =)ALTOGETHER: Restaurant Daniel was the best dining experience I have ever had, better than Danko, Fleur De Lys and Masas. My friend said it's better than French Laundry too. I guess it all depends on what you're looking for but if you like modern upscale dining environment, delicious innovative french-american food, and 4 star service, you will enjoy Daniel.",3,0,1,amy k.,"San Francisco, CA",471,104,20
5.0,6/8/2010,"I've been going here almost every year for my anniversary dinner and other special occasions.  Food is still probably the best in NYC.   I've been to all of the so called great restaurants in New York and this probably has the best food.  You will not be disappointed if you go here for the first time.Service is still good but not the same as it was 2-3 yrs ago.  I'm not sure why they keep asking me when I book or arrive if ""this is a special occasion"".   I want to say no, I'm just freakin' hungry and I want dinner.    I never tell them it's our anniversary.  Spare me the lame-o free cupcake.I got seated where I normally sit (they must have some good database that says he come's here once or twice a year and we should seat him in the exact same area).   Cocktails are awesome according to my wife (white cosmo).   I just had a bottle of mediocre $200 bottle of wine.   In years past, whatever I had chosen, it was always good.   Not so lucky this year.crab salad and sea scallops were both great and so was the mixture of bread we were offered.   I wish I didn't get stuffed on this before our food starting coming out.the Sole was excellent.  the best I ever had.   the restaurant was gracious enough to serve the sea bass the way they used to make it 2 yrs ago (in a potato pocket).we finished with the ganache and roasted bananas and chocolate coulant.   both were good but not the best part of the meal.we'll continue to go there next year and years to come.btw - we say Daniel there.  what a treat.",0,0,0,Jaison W.,"New York, NY",0,42,0

The waiters are really nice and patient, explaining each dish even if no one is listening, they even asked me what I was celebrating and bought out a special extra dessert. There's no pretentiousness about the place, my boyfriend didn't have a jacket and they just slipped one on him before he entered the dining room and it fit him perfectly.

5.0,5/28/2010,"I was lucky to get a reservation here before Daniel was announced as the recipient of the James Beard Award for Best Restaurant.In the lobby, my company and I enjoyed some olive crostini while we waited.  I happened to see Mr. Daniel Boloud himself come in, welcome some guests that were waiting for him and run to their private room.  I was nice to see that the star himself takes enough pride in his work that he'd ask friends to come.Being from Texas, my friends and I decided to do the Chef's tasting menu.  In short, it was a mix of items already on their menu, the lady in our group got different entrees than my brother and myself.Overall food was excellent - you could tell there was a masterful sense of technique.  There was a delicious turbot cut tableside.  My main waitress struggled a little and her trainer/mentor Javier came to aid her (spotted a few bones).  I inquired whether they eat the skin as well, so my waitress send the skin back to be crisped for us to taste.Wagyu beef was well cooked.  Short ribs was moist and flavorful - gave me one of those moments where I put my utensils down, smiled, and sighed and closed my eyes in appreciation for food fit for gods.  The sea scallops were well cooked - the hazelnut was not burned but added a nice nutty taste/texture to the smooth scallop.  Sweetbreads were perfectly cooked.  Earlier on my NY trip, I went to Michelin 3 star restaurant whose sweetbreads were chewy.  These sweetbreads cut like it was foie gras.The lady in my party had to leave early, and the staff accommodated by combining the 2 dessert presentations into one.  Everyone got something different.  The sorbet held great form.  A great combination of crisp textures meshing with creamy chocolate.  Bright fruits that compliment Kenyan coffee notes. (From my days working in the coffee industry, I've always enjoyed Kenyan coffee with grapefruit because of the juicy bright attributes. It would be my primary coffee tasting to show people the different characteristics of coffee).  We also received a variety of chocolates at the end as well as freshly made madeleines at the end.  Warm, soft, fresh madeleines - you truly felt like you were dining at home from something so fresh.This place definitely has a well executed menu. The food was magnificent.  My only critical piece is that there seemed to be a power play between the trainer and my server.  My server had been training for over a year, but you could tell that the trainer was checking up to see if she was on top of her game.  I did not say anything but my dining companions said it was a little awkward.Would I come back here?  If 205 per person on a tasting menu is worth it to you, sure.  I am not that kind of person that can drop that money down all the time, but I know that if I want to show the pinnacle of service and treat someone like a god or goddess, this is the place.  Well done, Mr. Boulod making people feel their best through the medium of food.",0,0,0,Brian L.,"Austin, TX",95,230,19
3.0,5/27/2010,"Arriving at Daniel we were guided to our table which was more of a private section I suppose.  My first impression was that it seemed more of a business dinner environment rather then a place for a romantic dinner with someone special.  We were meeting some friends of ours who arrived after we ordered some drinks.  Food: The food was ok in my opinion.  The theme of the night seems to have been mushy peas....which was rather interesting to say the least...our table kept making fun of the fact that in the UK mushy peas are something you get at a local fish & chips place....2 of our diners had a steak during the prix fix menu...problem was that they screwed up the temperatures, ie. gave the wrong dish to the wrong person...rather unacceptable for a 3 star michelin place no?One of the dishes was not edible by one of us.  They did offer to replace it, but she didn't want to.Desert was great, although one of the bussers brought an extra espresso and after realizing that he had made a mistake tried peddling it off to one of us....I mean ok nice jesture and all, but c'monnn....what are we at Joe's Lasagna's? They did try to make up with giving us a nice desert wine which was appreciated.So, this being the third 3 Star michelin restaurant I visited (many one and two), I have to say that I am confident that they will loose one of the stars soon...not to be negative about it, but for 3 Stars you have to be flawless....all in all an ok place, good service to a point and the kind of place you should go to simply say ""Yeah I've been there...""",1,0,0,Mario M.,"San Diego, CA",69,123,29

It was a complete surprise for me and Daniel made sure to provide amazing service to go along with our special occasion. They really cater to the customer! Our dinner included SEVERAL free dessert dishes. We eventually told them we didn't want any more otherwise we might have ended up rolling out of the restaurant. Another observation I made was that although this restaurant is obviously high class and very expensive, there is no sense of pretentiousness. The service at Daniel is impeccable. There are several waiters/waitresses to the table. The ambiance is absolutely perfect and the food was amazingly delicious. Everything my husband and I had was beyond tasty.

5.0,5/17/2010,"Daniel is one of my favorite restaurants because it is always a hit, no matter how many times you go. First things first, I am always impressed by the service. They have a very peculiar and endearing habit of giving you a separate chair just for your purse, no matter how small your purse is. The new renovations that took place a couple of years ago did wonders to the place as well - it used to look quite stuffy with all the gilded mirrors, dark colors, and heavy drapes. But now it is quite light and modern looking, but still maintains a classic feel.The food here is always A+. We never ordered a la carte from this restaurant, as it is so good we just depend on the kitchen to create miraculous dishes for us to sample. We've had everything from whole braised fish wrapped in leaves, to a whole roast beef, carved at the table. I always remember the madeleines they give you at the end of the meal - the best madeleines in the world! They are cute and small, lemony, and served warm in a napkin covered basket, and just ever so slightly crispier on the edges. It is essentially very ""old school"" at this restaurant, and it's quite refreshing because I feel that nowadays there are so many restaurants that try to be new and inventive in a cheesy way. Restaurant Daniel is classic and refined. You almost feel like you are sitting in a 5 star restaurant in Paris.Note: if you have ever had the pleasure of dining in Daniel Boulud's ""sky box"", it is truly an experience. It is Daniel's private office, enclosed in a glass ""box"" overlooking the kitchen. There is a little settee in the corner with a table that sits about 6 people, and you have to climb a set of stairs to get up to it.

5.0,5/8/2010,"First time visit to Daniel. The food was good and sophisticated, artistic presentation of each dishes, and also good wine paring(each portions were decent and couldn't even finish each wine with food).had the three course dinner and picked foie gras from specials and veal for the main. The veal was really good and combination of each meat (also had cheek on it)and vegitable was perfect. But, somehow foie gras had some rooms to improve. (sauce, and also the preparation of foie gras itself. had slightly fat like smell, whch is typical of foie gras, but is usually taken care of)the service was, of course good, but somehow felt a bit robot-like and unsophisticated. But again, over all the service was goos, but as long as you pay more than $600 for dinner for 2, you can expect everything to be fulfilled with certain standards.

5.0,5/7/2010,"Daniel's menu is a well directed symphony of haute cuisine and outstanding flavor. It could literally be read to me at bedtime so as to deliver sweet dreams. My experience at Daniel was truly everything that its reputation and myriad accolades suggested it would be: a transcendent dining experience, full of blissful flavors which rendered me into food nirvana. The restaurant is beautiful and the service (outside of the bar) is perfection. Everything was amazing including the wine and spirits which may explain why I don't even recall the exact contents of the 4 tiered and relatively brazen amuse bouche- but I know I enjoyed it! I tasted both the:DUCK FOIE GRAS TERRINE and MOSAIC OF CAPON, FOIE GRAS, CELERY ROOT both were great but the HAZELNUT CRUSTED MAINE SEA SCALLOPS with Morel Fricassée, Swiss Chard, Miners Lettuce, Green Peppercorn Sauce was the best plate of scallops I have ever had. I then had the SESAME & BONITO FLAKE CRUSTED BLACK COD with Smoked Sable, and Yukon Gold Potato Glazed Asparagus. The fish was off the charts, but the preparation of the accompanying vegetables was both unexpected and bursting with flavor- amazing- advanced or ""graduate level"" cuisine for sure. As an intermezzo I even got to meet Chef Baloud before desert and offer my compliments to his culinary highness which added to the dreamy quality of the whole evening as I am star struck by chefs more so than rock stars. For desert we had nearly every chocolate item on the menu, but my favorite was the WARM GUANAJA CHOCOLATE COULANT with Liquid Caramel, Fleur de Sel, Milk Sorbet...a heavenly balance between bitter/salty and sweet with the molten center I covet above all desert components- it was truly a memorable desert. The cookies and chocolates that followed were met with laughter (as deserts often are), as the thought that further eating was even possible was somewhat ludicrous at that point, but the flavors kept us eating as much of them as we could, not wanting the sweet dream of a dining experience to end.

The meat was so tender, the dish was amazing, and the corn was sooo sweet, they must grow some of these veggies themselves.  Dessert had the poached pineapple with coconut and pina colada sorbet, the pineapple was ridiculously sweet although we loved the sorbet.  We also had the tainori chocolate dacquoise which was delicious, the lemon curd in conjunction with the chocolate cream was perfect, the tartness of the lemon balanced out the bitterness of the chocolateThey also gave us a complementary dessert, the which was filled with caramel and served with ice milk:  this was our favorite out of all of the desserts.  Dinner also ended with madelienes and petite fois.  The madeleines were excellent, a little crunchy outside, and soft in the middle.  Some of the petite fois were a little too sweet for my taste.Loved every facet of the meal, and we're glad we did for how much it was, but we are glad we got to experience it!",3,0,0,CE C.,"New York, NY",3,323,0

Then everything came to a grinding halt. Long wait for anyone to come to the table, when the captain saw me getting a bit nudgy he approached and asked if we would care for a drink. Our waiter finally made an appearance and dropped off menus and was gone again. It wasn't untill I flagged him down to inform him we would be ordering the 8 course tasting menu with wine that he started to pay us any attention, if you could call it that. The food started off at a really good pace and then stopped again. Very choppy after the first 3 courses. Very little explanation about the dishes and almost none about the wines. For example; one dish my wife had was a stuffed saddle of rabbit, when she asked what the stuffing was he replied...rabbit inners and stuff. When I commented on the long wait between courses he said the kitchen had messed up and needed to redo my dish, and I don't want bad food do I?? Well, I guess I don't but ....at this point he tried to warm up to me I think by commenting on my Rolex, which he was very eager to show me his. Dessert courses next all very good, wines very good.

5.0,3/20/2010,"I went to Daniel for my 25th birthday this December. I had the three course vegetarian meal, starting with an amuse bouche and a cocktail. The drink had a spherical ice cube with a flower frozen inside it! Awesome. For my appetizer, I had a spinach dish made with a curry sauce. Such a well-balance, texturally interesting dish.  Aside from the soft spinach there were little seaweed crisps (which tasted like rice crisps) that really were nice with the curry flavor.My entree was a risotto style dish made with Okinawan sweet potatoes and quince. My boyfriend had short ribs prepared two ways, and he positively licked the plate. The many servers who brought us our food made us feel very comfortable and taken care of. I got a kick out of the huge bread selection that made a few stops at our table. Why not try all the varieties? Oh, because there were SEVEN plates of dessert, including a special birthday ice cream and cake. I definitely felt like Daniel is a good value for the cost, considering the deliciousness of the food and the high quality of service.

5.0,3/7/2010,"What makes Daniel spectacular? service, service, service. They are friendly yet reserved. They will chit chat with you, pull and push the table when you get up or return to your seat, and would even take your pics at different areas of the bar or dining room if requested. You are never rushed, no matter what time it is. They put so much effort in service that it seems so effortless and unpretentious. I can't say enough good things about Daniel on this aspect. They make you feel special. I once dined near a young- far-too-stylish looking couple; the girl looked so tacky and whore-ish while the guy looked funny in his  two sizes too big jacket, who received the same level of service as the old upper east siders money sitting on the other table. That says something... The extra courses!! Oh my gosh! We got amuse, canapes, additional desserts, petit fours, madeleines, assortment of chocs, it just never ends!!! Either that or they can tell I have a healthy appetite haha! The ambiance is really conducive to an elegant dinner. I prefer to dine in the lounge area instead the main dining room. It feels more intimate there. But the dining room definitely has better service. Your pick!Now for the oh-not-so-spectacular things. The food doesn't blow me away. Sorry folks! And the wine pairing isn't exemplary either. Can you blame me for having had better meals with service that is on par at a one star Michelin restaurant?  The duo of dry aged beef is the only stand out here. It keeps me coming back. I can eat 50 of the short ribs, and maybe only 25 of the rib eyes in one dinner. The other items like foie gras, lamb, duck, and seafood are very good but I could've had the same things at a little French restaurant in west village.  Just a bone to pick, not a real complain: we went there last night for our 1 yr wedding anniversary. We also made note of it in our open table reservation. But from start to finish, we got no acknowledgement whatsoever. At the end of our meal, our waiter heard my husband and I wishing each other happy anniversary, and immediately wished us the same and apologized profusely for not knowing earlier. The head waiter then followed suit. It was still nice of them to acknowledge it then, but I wished I had gotten my dessert with happy anniversary written on the plate :D So why the 5 star you asked? Well..it is still as good as it gets! I wouldn't come here specifically for the food. It's the whole experience.

5.0,3/2/2010,"We dined at Daniel this past weekend to celebrate my dad's birthday.  There were seven of us including my nine-year-old son.  I was a bit hesitant prior to dining there as when my mom made the reservation and asked if they could accommodate a child the hostess rudely exclaimed ""you're bringing a child?""  It wasn't as if my mom asked if they had chicken fingers or crayons, we just wanted them to be aware that we would have a younger diner with us.  My son is very well behaved and well traveled.   Luckily, this was the only arrogance we were subjected to.  So now that I'm past that...the dining experience was exceptional from start to finish. I'll keep my review simple as many others here have done such an amazing job.First, the menu is made up of a three course  prix-fixe meal or  a six- or eight-course tasting menu.  We decided on the prix-fixe menu.Prior to our appetizer course we were treated to an amuse bouche which happened to be a trio of squash that evening.  my favorite was a creamy little concoction that tasted like pumpkin pie...  For appetizers, many of us chose the crab salad or frog legs.  Both were amazing.    As for the entrees, the table was equally divided.  My husband and I chose the Sea Bass, two others chose the Duo of Beef which consisted of a braised short rib and seared rib eye, and the remaining two chose the Trio of Milk Fed Pig which consisted of a smoked belly portion, ham and a chop.  My son was treated to a dish of hand-cut spaghetti and broccoli which they prepared table-side so that was fun for him.  Speaking for my own meal which was the Black Sea Bass, the fish was of course prepared perfectly as you would expect but the Syrah sauce made it divine.  I also couldn't get enough of the creamy little squares of pureed leek that accompanied it.The dessert course was also a highlight.  My dad was treated to a magnificent birthday dessert of his own and many of us chose the Chocolate & Peanut Butter Ganache which was garnished with a praline and accompanied by a heavenly caramel ice cream.  The chef also sent my son a complimentary tasting of various ice creams.  It was a very nice touch.  In addition, as others have mentioned, aside from all of the desserts we ordered we were treated to what seemed like an endless stream of warm madelines and little silver trays of petit fours and chocolates.  Overall, we had an amazing evening.  The service was flawless and deliberately relaxed in timing.  Each course was beautifully presented.   I would certainly dine at Daniel whenever we visit New York.  (And, even though he was the only child there, I will take my son again.)",0,0,0,Stacy P.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,21,0
5.0,2/27/2010,"I recently had the great privilege to take Natasha to Daniel Boulud's eponymous restaurant to celebrate her birthday.  The restaurant has recently been promoted in the Michelin hierarchy with it now garnering three stars, assuring that it is among the very best restaurants in the world (41st in fact by last year's rankings).  In such rarefied air, the expectation was that I could stand to do little better than this.  The elaborate and memorable meal we had more than confirmed this conclusion.  The meal began with a trio of amuse bouches.  The theme was cauliflower.  The tripartite arrangement draped across the center of my fine china plate was visually striking.  To the left, the cauliflower complemented mackerel and to the right it complemented a small bite of shrimp.  In the middle the cauliflower was made into a small taste of soup that was balanced in texture with a cracker spoon.  The flavors were delicate and interesting.  Impressive given that I generally do not like cauliflower.For the first course, I had the duo of Florida frog legs.  This was a gamble for me having been quite disappointed in the past with the frog legs at Jean Georges.  Surely at Daniel they would fare better with this preparation.  Indeed!  The presentation was elaborate and gorgeous.  Two frog leg lollipops flanked either end of an elliptical plate.  The gulf between was filled in with spinach (both fresh and pureed), mushrooms, and crispy shallot rings.  The plate was made complete by a tableside serving of two dollops of kamut berries accentuated with black garlic.  The kamut berries, a first for me, were simply exceptional.  An innocuous whole grain, these berries took on a prominent role in this dish.  They were an excellent way to bring a taste of butter to the dish through alternative means.  The frog legs themselves were not so diminutive here, and I found them perfectly prepared.  Further, they were nicely accompanied by the earthiness of the mushrooms and fresh burst of green coming from the spinach.  A perfect dish all around and among my all time favorites.  For the second course, I had the trio of milk fed pig from Quebec.  The trio was comprised of a roasted chop, an oblong parallelepiped of ham dotted with Romanesco, and a squat cube of smoked pork belly.  All of the proteins were gorgeously prepared.  My love for pork belly continues, and I was pleased with the smokiness of this particular specimen.  The chop was striking with its delicious meat emanating from the Frenched bone, and its impressive size dwarfing the pork belly.  The ham was okay, but I did not enjoy the frequent interruption by the Romanesco.  This was more distracting than appetizing.  Generally though, this was a solid dish; but I would probably be inclined to order differently upon my next visit.  For dessert, I had the warm guanagja chocolate coulant.  The cake was garnished with a gold leaf and housed delicious liquid caramel.  A streak of chocolate connected it the far end of the plate where a complementary ellipsoid of milk sorbet could be found.  Simple, delicious, and a touch of luxury.  A second dessert was then brought out in Natasha's honor replete with her name written on the plate in chocolate, sorbet, confectionary delights, and a lone lit candle awaiting the bated breath of a wishful young lady.  Compliments of the chef of course, and a lovely way to honor her on this occasion.  The mignardises were less than substantial here.  On a small rectangular silver platter, we were offered a pre-selected set of six small bite desserts including macaroons.  Additionally madeleines were offered.  In addition to the meal, we opted for the wine pairing.  Our sommelier was especially friendly and engaging.  He accentuated the festive nature of our visit and included selections of champagne, rose, and pinot noir.  Because both of our courses were paired with a Pinot Noir, he even encouraged us to swap glasses mid-course to compare the selection from Oregon to the selection from France as it enhanced the flavors in our respective dishes.  I loved the enthusiasm and the great knowledge he brought to our table.  All around, the service was impeccable and consistent with the very high standards one expects of a three star restaurant.  The decor was luxurious and grand.  Sitting side by side in our banquette, we were afforded a view of the main floor while still remaining aloof.  Across the divider from us, our dinner neighbors were none other than Howard Stern and his wife.  Whether you are a billionaire or a mere mortal hoping to celebrate a special occasion, a grand time will be had here.  Highly recommend.  The three course prix-fixe menu is $105 per person, and the wine pairing is an additional $60 per person.",16,4,12,Jim U.,"Washington, DC",690,1303,3044
5.0,2/25/2010,"If you give this place less than five stars, you're just being arrogant. Yes, there are other 3 michelin star restaurants in the world, and they're all a little different.   This is the concept of dinner as an ""event"" done exceptionally well here.  You know the food and wine and service are going to be exceptional, so I won't even bother - because what I had won't be on the menu when you go. What, I think, sets this place apart is the atmosphere.  I loved what seemed to be a 10-1 ratio of service people to our table. But always the same three main people  that spoke with us (waiter, sommlier, food describer guy). I love when they walk you to the bathroom. I loved that there was nothing pretensious about it.  I loved that the sommlier could see I wasn't sporting a 20 carat diamond, so he new to stick to a wine under $250 without even asking our price range. I love that when I would compliment a dish, our waiter was proud, like it was the best compliment he received all night - even though he hears the same thing at every table.I liked the visable wine cellar - not over the top, not the center of attention, but a statement peice.I even liked the modern decor.  And I CAN'T believe I never new this place had a bar the entire time I lived in NYC. Totally a missed opportunity.For me, it's less about the food. I wouldn't be here if I didn't already know the food was gonna knock my socks off.

5.0,2/19/2010,"Daniel was unbelievable. I can't help but make comparisons to Joel Robuchon, where I tasted things that were mind-blowing, and completely new to me. At Daniel, familiar flavors were elevated. I recognized them, but they came from unexpected places; I had a watermelon radish that tasted like mashed potatoes. The food was simultaneously homey and sublime. There was a lot of, ""What is that? It's like... oh my god.""Highlights: - Foccacia with a whole clove of roasted garlic in the middle.- Terrine of foie gras, with a date and almond napoleon. The foie gras was velvety and lucious; I ate it with my mouth closed and the moment felt like forever. It was the best thing I'd ever eaten, until a few courses later. - Breaded sardines (I love sardines) with crispy pork belly (I LOVE PORK BELLY) and butternut squash. So rustic! - Pan-seared turbot on a bed of black truffle arancini (crispy-cheesey-rice) and periguex sauce (wine and black truffles again). They brought it out on a pink salt platter, and carved it tableside. I think this is the point where I began loving the waiters, and everyone else in the room. I almost cried.- Roasted duck breast with watermelon radish (that tasted like mashed potatoes) and an amazing little cube of pesto. I love food-cubes. The sauce was really rich and chicken-y, like coq au vin but more.  - Warm chocolate cake with liquid caramel and milk sorbet. Oozing chocolate goodness. It was the best dinner of my life. I mean, literally, ""Woohoo! As good as it gets!""The service was a bit overwhelming. I think there were too many waiters, and it was a couple of hours into the meal before we developed a rapport and I felt totally comfortable. They weren't actually French, but there was still more snootiness than I would've liked.Still, the service had all the standard flourishes of fine dining. The presentation of the courses was like synchronized swimming; our plates always landed on the table at the exact same second. There was tableside carving and saucing. I got very excited whenever they brought out the sauce. It was like a Steve Jobs keynote: ""One more thing!"" And it was always the best thing.The dining room is absolutely beautiful; it had elements of gaudiness (columns, chandeliers) but it never crossed that line. It's arranged differently that most restaurants I've visited: all the tables faced the center of the room, so everyone was looking at each other. The crowd was older, obviously monied, and (in significant numbers) foreign. The room buzzed warmly with conversation; you could hear other people talking, but you couldn't make out what they were actually saying. Perfect. The bathroom is down two flights of narrow stairs, which is an extremely poor idea (not just because of the wine, but the advanced age of much of the clientele). Cell phone use isn't permitted in the restaurant, so I pulled out my iPhone as soon as I got down the stairs, and looked up to find a painting of a guy looking at his iPhone. It was hilarious. My only real gripe (if I'm allowed to have a gripe about something I enjoyed so deeply) is that my boyfriend and I were mostly served different things, which were largely too small to share. It was a little bit heart-wrenching. Low lighting would my other teeny complaint.Daniel Boloud himself was in the hizzouse. He spent about half an hour talking to two older couples in the middle of the dining room. For a while, he stood a few feet behind our table, leaning against the wall and surveying the proceedings with a stony face. I stared openly.",7,3,4,Alex A.,"New York, NY",63,37,28

As soon as we walked in, I knew we were definitely in for a treat.  I could not have been more pleased with the service, food and ambiance.  We decided to do the wine pairing and ordered from the regular pre fixe three course menu.  They started us off with bread and for my appetizer I got the Maine Peekytoe Crab Salad which also had Celery, Walnut Oil and Granny Smith Apple Sauce. What amazing flavor this had!  It was so vibrant and paired just perfectly with my wine pairing. I could not get enough!  Second course, which was the main course, I went with Woodfire Grilled Yellowfin  Tuna with Hawaiian Hearts of Palm, Red Kuri Squash and Chorizo Emulsion. AWESOME!

Simply works of art. Not only does it look amazing with the way it is presented but there is just nothing you can find wrong about the taste. The portions are small, typical of french food. This is not a problem if you do a 4 course meal. If you can't afford to abuse your credit card, then don't bother. It was more than worth it to me but I know most people wouldn't spend so much on a dinner. Life is to live and enjoy so if you can you should defiantly give this place a visit.

I probably will try it out again in the future, and maybe opt for the tasting menu then.  On a side note:  after we got home, my fiance wasn't feeling well and proceeded to upchuck the entire $500 meal.  Sigh, guess he wasn't a big fan either.",0,1,0,Overeater S.,"Palisades Park, NJ",15,40,1

5.0,1/31/2010,"You truly get what you pay for at Daniel.  My boyfriend brought me here on my birthday last year, and as expected, the service and food were absolutely first-rate.  Despite that fact that we were the youngest patrons at the restaurant by a good 20 years, we didn't feel like displaced outsiders.  We were seated after a 5-minute wait at a cozy table with great views of the restaurant.  The waiter even pulled out a small ottoman so that I'd have an area to place my bag, which I suspect is just for that purpose.  The decor has since undergone a face lift, and at the time, the restaurant, while grand and elegant, did seem a little dated, with all the red velvet chairs and drapes and such. We opted for the tasting menu and I've never had a more beautifully and creatively presented meal.  There were so many dishes that I can't even remember specifically what I ate.  I just know I enjoyed every single one of them.  I do remember starting off with the kaitafi crusted scallops, which were delicious (I still think about them from time to time), but I noticed it's been replaced by kaitafi crusted rock lobster on the menu. When dessert came around, I struggled to pick one item to order, and the waiter, noticing such and finding out that I was celebrating a birthday, brought out several desserts on the house (including the 2 I couldn't decide between!)  I think I had a total of 4 desserts to pick at, in addition to the petit fours and madeleines, which were perfectly soft and warm.  I couldn't have asked for a better ending to a wonderful meal.",4,2,5,McGibblets C.,"New York, NY",28,25,1

5.0,1/28/2010,"There is one word to describe Daniel -- decadent.Was this the best meal I've had in New York? No (with unlimited resources and one restaurant to pick, I'd go back to Le Bernardin without question).  But was this an amazingly memorable meal?  Yes.Waiting for other friends, I enjoyed a drink with Shuo Y., going for the Batida de Coco, a refreshing drink made with iced tea, coconut milk, and kaffir lime Cachaca.  Served with our drinks were addictive and delicately made olive crackers -- I knew from this moment on that we were in for something fantastic.Wine list was pricey (maxed out at around 10k) but with several choices under 100.  Our server tried to help me without offering the support of the Sommelier and tried to steer me towards a set of wines that didn't really appeal to me in price or varietal -- the Sommelier saw this struggle, came over, and gladly suggested a solid bottle. Amuses arrived on beautiful serving pieces allowing for three separate takes on beets.  Tops for me was a beet mousse that not only brought out the sweetness of the beet but let me explore the flavors in an entirely new texture. For starters, I think our entire table went for foie gras dishes.  Three of five, a sauteed foie gras special.  My taste revealed a buttery liver accented by the fruit glaze, although lacking the melt-in-your-mouth ""love"" in the dish that I found in Bibou's (Philadelphia) version.  My capon and foie gras terrine with black truffles and celery root was gorgeously presented and very tasty, but just didn't blow me away.  The duck foie gras terrine with a date and marcona almond napoleon, however, was perfection, with the sweetness of the napoleon combining with the richness of the liver to create decadence in a single bite.  Toasted brioche added a well appreciated crunch.For mains, I went with the duo of beef -- I don't usually eat very much red meat save for an occasional burger, but this came highly regarded from the wait staff, and who am I to turn down parsnip-potato gratin? Presentation was gorgeous.  The steak was probably a little on the rarer side of medium rare, which I'm fine with, although it was also a tad underseasoned. Black trumpet mushrooms were bold and well concentrated in flavor.  The short rib was perfectly seasoned and cooked, although a tad too fatty for me.  The problem with short ribs is that the fattier they are, the more tender they become, although the fattier they are, the more likely the consistency will be gummy.  Mine tasted a little gummy.  The gratin was just okay in my book.For dessert, I chose a chocolate mousse, and although I'm now forever spoiled on mousses post the coffee mousse at James in Philly, it was flawless.  And then the decadence began.  First, a tray of petit fours were brought for the table, including a nice pistachio bite (not to be picky here, but I was surprised we only got one tray of 6 petit fours for 5 people -- you really have to choose carefully!), then warm madelines.  They cleared our plates and I thought we were done, but lo and behold, more plates!  A chocolate truffles course.  I especially enjoyed the chocolate with sesame. Although I didn't particularly care for our waiter's descriptions on either food or wine (I found them rudimentary at best -- he described the Pumpkin Cream on Brown Sugar biscuit as a brown sugar biscuit topped with pumpkin cream), I found the service on a whole to be nothing short of stellar.  Attentive without being intrusive, water glasses were always refilled, food was served to all guests in our party at the same time, and we were never rushed.  In the end, I was nothing short of impressed - 5 stars!",3,1,1,Matt L.,"Washington, DC",43,141,0
5.0,1/27/2010,"The dining room is amazingly beautiful without being intimidating.  Upon entry, the foyer is warm and inviting, and I enjoyed a relaxing pre dinner drink with my friend.  My ""New York sling"" consisted of the drink itself and a large spheroid of ice, inside of which was entombed an orchid.  Being a big fan of geometry, this impressed me to no end.I ordered the 3 course Prix Fixe.  The initial amouse bouche consisted of three items centered around beets (which are apparently in season).  I liked that the flavor was subtle as it acted as a gentle segue into the meal to follow.For appitizer, I ordered the sauteed Foie Gras, which upon arrival the waiter described as ""a loaf"" of Foie Gras.  I've never had sauteed Foie Gras before, but it was superb.  The texture and consistency was one of the best I've ever had, and it was well complimented by honey crisp and redcurrant.  My main course was lamb, and it was delicious.  The meat was well cooked, unabashedly able to show off the distinct taste of the meat, but without letting the lamb flavor overpower the dish.  This was one of the best western style lamb dishes I've had.The meal ended with a very long dessert service, starting with a chocolate mousse, then fresh made madelines, and finally ending with fresh made chocolate.  The chocolate was amazing, and I regret not trying all four.The service was superb.  They gave my colleague an ottoman for her purse which was so awesome it made me wish I had a purse.  The only mistake all evening was that they forgot to give my co-worker honey for her tea that she had requested, but it was quickly addressed.  Even though we were one of the last parties to leave (at nearly midnight) there was never a hint of rush.  The waiters were always attentive (my water glass was never lesd than 30% filled and they were sufficiently ninja that I never noticed when they were filling it) but never intrusive and they made our party feel well taken care of.Ultimately, I struggled whether this was a true 5 star place, or a very good 4 star.  My meal at Le Bernardin has definitely raised the bar, but in the end, I felt the Daniel was a solid 5 stars because of the great overall feel of the restaurant, and how memorable the food was.  As I was leaving, I felt strongly that I wanted to come back again and try the tasting menu, and I think this would be one of my top choices to have a ""special occasion"" dinner.",0,0,0,Shuo Y.,"San Francisco, CA",43,30,0
5.0,1/12/2010,"600th review - see the blog for the full thing.  Highlights below.The amuse of the evening, presented by the younger female server, was a tasting of Beets - Golden Beets with horseradish and walnuts, Beet Borscht with duck prosciutto, and Beet cured salmon with chives.  Loving beets as I do this was a true surprise and all three tastes were wonderful in their manner of bringing forth the earthiness of the beets in various forms.  While all three were tasty little bites, the Borscht with duck is something they should strongly consider as a menu item because it was wonderful and quite complicated for a ""simple amuse.""PRESSED DUCK AND FOIE GRAS TERRINE - Chimay Gelée, Chestnuts, Red Cabbage Chutney - a terrine similar in texture to the quail in a jar at Per Se this dish was served with buttery toasted country bread and similar to the Quail it really wasn't needed as this dish wasn't ""spreadable.""  Tasty and ample in portion I liked the manner in which the savory yet sweet chutney balanced the unctuous foie and succulent duck.  At the top of the plate four different preparations of chestnut were presented and added some crunchiness to the plate - the chestnut with a bit of citrus atop it being the most interesting by far.BLACK SEA BASS WITH SYRAH SAUCE - Leek Royale, Pommes Lyonnaise - was interestingly just as straightforward as the title and all the more wonderful for it.  Featuring a barely cooked filet of bass with skin still on that was topped with a spicy sauce that resembled a sweetened wine alongside a creamy square of pureed leeks and cream and a cylinder of oniony potatoes wrapped in a thin caramelized onion - no tricks, no finagling, just a straight forward and delicious preparation of some classic dishes on a single plate.  Great ingredients, expert preparation, attractive presentation - sometimes that is all a great dish needs.PAN SEARED MILLBROOK VENISON LOIN - Barley Ragoût, Okinawan Sweet Potato, Roasted Foie Gras, Pickled Quince.  Featuring a wonderfully lean slice of venison that likely topped 5oz (interesting that many critique Daniel's portion sizes) cooked rare and topped with a ragout of Barley, Sesame Seeds, and Pomagranate - this is as close as I've gotten to eating Beef texture in ages.  Slicing almost like a lean ham with no gamey or bloody flavor to be found the Barley crust added a sweet and toothy component to the dish that was only furthered in the accoutrements - two squares of sweeter-than-sweet sweet potatoes topped with slices of carrot and a cube of pan seared foie gras topped with quince., WARM GUANAJA CHOCOLATE COULANT - Liquid Caramel, Fleur de Sel, Milk Sorbet.  First of all, the milk sorbet is unreal - it tastes like slightly less sweet than cereal milk from Frosted Flakes and when combined with the caramel and salt had a distinctly similar taste to the ""Secret Breakfast"" ice cream at Humprhy Slocombe in San Francisco - the best ice cream ever.  Onward to the Coulant - essentially a warmer and more dense version of the chocolate bouchons at Keller's bistro, but filled with liquid caramel and vastly superior.  Sort of a brownie, sort of a lava cake - entirely delicious and rich.When it was all said and done I truly enjoyed my experience at Daniel.  While I've heard that regulars tend to get better treatment, I was greeted by the chef like a regular (admittedly he just happened to be walking through the salon, but he didn't have to stop and say hi,) had flawless service throughout, and when I noted the most small of problems the team was instantly bending over backwards to make amends (free cheese course, free second dessert after I rejected a re-do on the lobster and the short ribs.)  Daniel is definitely fine dining done right - from the room to the scene to the service to the quality of the foods.  That said, it is the ""little things"" in my opinion that separate a place like Per Se, Savoy, Robuchon, or TFL from Daniel - offering a tour of the kitchen, servers who ask a little bit about you and seem to want to know you as a diner, a parting gift, etc.  Surely these are not required from a restaurant, but they are the ""touches"" that make an amazing meal more of a ""once in a lifetime experience.""  For now Daniel will settle for the sooner, but I'd certainly not hesitate to come back.",4,1,5,Michael U.,"Las Vegas, NV",3078,4440,99503

That being said, I can't remember a single thing that I ate there, besides the bowl full of warm madelines that came out with dessert. The food is great, the service is on point, but nothing about the experience hinged on revelatory - I wouldn't race back to spend another paycheck and a half.It's a good go to for a fine dining experience in the City and the space is especially posh.

5.0,1/2/2010,"We do not normally (ever) eat at restaurants this fine.  Service to the point of feeling like you have a stalker, without a trace of snobbery or condescension.  All plates were served simultaneously.  Ambiance was pleasant.  Overall an enjoyable experience.  But the star was the food.One omnivore, one vegetarian (lacto-ovo).  Offers a full vegetarian menu, not just a single option.  Was told that vegan options were available.First, a tasting of parsnips.  Oh lord, who knew parsnips were sensual and full-flavored.  The mousse (or whatever) was simply sublime.I wanted to lick each and every plate clean.  The barley ""risotto"" (not risotto, just barley in a creamy risotto-like sauce) was sooo delicious that it inspired me to attempt a home-version. Right.Dessert never stopped coming!  First, we had the dessert that we ordered.  Then a plate of candies.  Then a basket of warm madelines, THEN a plate of little chocolates.  I almost burst.We each had one drink, the 3 course prix fixe meal, and coffee with our dessert and paid about $350 with tip.  Gulp.

I took some clients here for a dinner and every part exceeded my expectations, which were very high. We enjoyed an amazing tasting menu and had the servers (yes you have several) suggest some wine pairings. Daniel came out and talked with us for a little bit, it was great to see him involved in the service during a week night. It's hard to put into words the entire experience (about 4 hours) entailed but the attention to detail that both by the front of the house and the back of the house have is unparalleled in my dining experience.If you are looking for an amazing dining experience in NYC this is the place to be.

5.0,12/21/2009,"I would have to say that this restaurant lives up to its name.  It was an absolutely amazing dining experience from start to finish.  My boyfriend and I went there a few weeks ago for our anniversary.  We had a 10:15pm reservation - despite making it 4 weeks in advance.  So that will tell you how in-demand this place is.  However, we arrived very early and were seating right away.  The service was excellent, attentive and kind.  I found the wait staff to be friendly, but if you want privacy at your table they are not in your face.Now, for the food.  The best part!  We had the 6-course tasting menu with wine pairing.  We were not at all rushed to eat it and we spent a good 3 hours savoring each course.  All of the wines were delicious and seemed like a good pairing to me, (but I'm no wine expert).  I can't recount every single dish but I will highlight some favorites:Duck Foie Gras Terrine - absolutely delicious!  And I loved the presentation it looks like a little wall of bricks on the plate. Marinated Fluke with Seaweed - this was melt-in-your-mouth!  Favorite dish of the night!I also really loved the dessert but can't quite recall it right now. They also brought us an additional small chocolate dessert, for the occasion of our anniversary which said Happy 1st Anniversary in chocolate syrup.  That was also delicious.  By the time we got to that, we barely had room to pop a couple of the unbelievably perfect, still-warm madeleines that they brought out as well!  Needless to say we went home tipsy, happy, and full.I guess when you go to a place with this kind of pricing, you have to comment on that.  I think Daniel is expensive because it should be expensive.  If you want to go to a top restaurant then you're going to pay top dollar!  So if you have the means, or could save up and go for an occasion, I would definitely recommend it!",2,0,1,Nasim K.,"New York, NY",11,39,0

5.0,12/12/2009,"An absolute fab dining experience.  Just go!  My only advice is that you study the wine list (off of the website) before going there because there is an ""arb"" to be had on prices of so many vintages of wines, particularly the Burgundies (by this I mean for the same price you may identity a bottle that has higher ratings because I found that Daniel's prices don't always reflect QUALITY (Parker and/or Winespectator ratings on particular vintage and vintner) and AGE, ie to age a bottle for 10+ years there's cost involved.)  It's 3am and I'm awake because 7 hours ago, I seem to have over-indulged on a perfected cellar-ed (the cork was so perfect, saturated with wine and looking as if it were turning into a river stone) 1989 Clos de la Roche after polishing off a bottle of Krug, with a companion who drank at a less Bacchanal pace than I.  But I digress...OK, it was my first time at Daniel this Friday evening, not for lacking means but for my general distaste for UES-Park Ave snob scene.  I wasnt disappointed in my preconceived notion of who dine here (botox ridden ladies in their minks, etc) nor of much lauded quality of food and service.  Wow!  After all these years, I can't imagine what it must take for Monsieur Boulud to instill in his people the inner drive to excel in providing a fine dining experience.  The evening was an unforgettable experience in witnessing a perfectly choreographed execution of pampering, which is in no less of a feat than serving up a heavenly dish after dish.  I had Maine sea scallop rosette, risotto with shavings of truffle (which was liberally shaved off of a fist of truffle at the exact moment my risotto arrived) and Himalayan salt baked Turbot and a mixed green salad off the menu (and pls trust that the latter was no ordinary mixed green salad.)  The Sommelier suggested a well-aged (some may say over-aged, given that an '89 was less than ideal vintage for Cote de Nuit) Pinot to accompany my seafood centric meal.  I am not articulate enough to describe the transcendental experience of tasting such a well-aged Burgundy, seemingly alive with strawberry preserve fruit, a subtle minerality of the terroir, and velvety smooth tannin.  And this delicious wine seem to bring out the intense flavor of the Abbey Ale sauce accompanying what was a mouth-watering savory taste of what's normally just plain flesh of Turbot.  Again, my words fail me in describing how delighted I was in tasting the flavors that were just exploding in my mouth after having ordered a fish dish in a nod to my health.  Enough said.  A place that is def worthy spending a chunk of your hard-earned money in this economic recession.",1,0,0,Jay K.,"New York, NY",24,66,47
5.0,12/7/2009,"Daniel was one of the best meals of my life, and can not only be looked at as a dinner, but an experience (this may help swallow the bill too).There is little need to mention that the service was perfect, the décor exquisite and that every little detail was covered, but I guess I did just mentioned it. One cool aside, I did get to meet Daniel Boulud at the end of my meal, which was great, but it was nicer to know he was actually back there cooking my meal... unlike several other celebrity owned restaurants. I only commented on my selections from the tasting, but I can assure you that everything was excellent.Food with Wine Pairings:Amuse Bouche: It was a tasting of sweet potato, all of which were very good, but the puree was by far the best.MOSAIC OF CAPON, FOIE GRAS, AND CELERY ROOT, Pickled Daikon, Satur Farms Mâche, Pear Confit: Domaine Ostertag, Sylvaner, Alsace 2008: I enjoyed this dish very much, it had wonderful balance, with the perfect amount of acid. OLIVE OIL POACHED COD EN SALADE with Artichoke Purée, Tarragon Dressing, Lemon Zest: Domaine Bailly, Sancerre Chavignol, Loire 2008. If I had to pick my least favorite dish, this would be it, but by no means was it a poor dish; the cod just seemed a bit lost. Great flavor overall though.BUTTER POACHED ABALONE, Yellow Curry Braised Greens, Crispy Rice, Chayote: Absolutely outstanding, creamy, perfectly flavored, and one of the best dishes. The Abalone was outstanding, its texture and flavor made this my new favorite fish... although I doubt it can be replicated outside of the restaurant.HANDMADE SPINACH TORTELLONI, Chanterelles, Tomme de la Chataigneraie, Lomo, Black Garlic: Domaine Matrot, Meursault  Les Chevalières, Burgundy 2007. Even though this was not my dish, I had to mention it because it was out of this world good.BLACK SEA BASS WITH SYRAH SAUCE, Leek Royale, Pommes Lyonnaise: Chehalem, Pinot Noir, Willamette Valley, Oregon 2007. This may have been the best dish overall, but it was by far the best piece of Black Sea Bass that I believe has ever been made.DUO OF DRY AGED BLACK ANGUS BEEF, Red Wine Braised Short Rib with Parsnip-Potato Gratin, Seared Rib Eye with Black Trumpets, Gorgonzola Cream: La Rioja Alta, Viña Ardanza, Rioja, 2000. Another outstanding course, but the Braised Short Rib was the best single tasting thing I had all night... I would like to have ordered an additional 100oz's of it; words cannot describe how good it was.WARM GUANAJA CHOCOLATE COULANT,Liquid Caramel, Fleur de Sel, Milk Sorbet: Rivesaltes Domaine de Rancy Ambré, Roussillon 1996. As you would expect, another great course, this was the best lava cake I have ever had, although they make the name a lot fancier.Cheese Course: I ordered the cheese plate, for what I assumed would be a hefty additional charge. However, I was pleasantly surprised to be told the charge had been waived, and that made an already great cheese course that much better.I know this was a longgggg review, but I felt it was warranted. I think everyone should be prepared when you are going to spend around $800 or more for two people (tasting, wine pairing, and tip).

4.0,11/28/2009,"I would agree with some of the reviewers here that Daniel is good, very good...but not great. Our experience was mixed and for a 3 star Michelin establishment, they were sure intent on turning a lot of tables.We had a 6pm reservation but arrived early, the hostess sat us anyway which was a good surprise. Proper greetings by the hostess and even the coat check attendant was attentive. We were seated at a quaint table for 2; Daniel has small stools for the ladies to park their bags.Our waiter promptly came to greet us albeit a bit robotic at first for my taste. He offered the cocktail menu as well as the rather extensive wine menu (or book).  My wife ordered the Cosmo Blanc and for me, a Glenlivet on the rocks. Our waiter went to put in the order then came back to explain the menu. We ordered the 6 course tasting menu and I had the accompanying wine tasting.Our amuse bouche arrived and it was fabulous. However, in one of my wife's fish, she dug out 4 small bones...and we kind of looked at each other a bit surprised. A Michelin 3 star kitchen apparently still has issues prepping fish! We told the wait staff about the bones and about 2-3 folks came by to profusely apologize. We just thought it was quite funny, I wonder if Per Se prep cooks have this issue.In any case, the courses came and went; most of the dishes were good and forgettable. The wine pairings were done quite nicely. Most of the dishes were executed well with the exception of the butter abalone and the skate. Our butter abalone was underseason but it was served on a bed of sea salt which we use to season the dish (another dash of humor to our meal). Even our waiter told us, 'the sea salt is just for show'; well that sea salt saved that dish. The skate dish was overseasoned and just a bit over salty than we liked.The one memorable dish was a cheese ravioli dish with shaved white truffle. This was compliments from the chef due to the fish bones incident. They even threw in some extra wine pairings for good measure. The bread selection was quite extensive and we ate too much of it.Dessert arrived and we were given an extra dessert due to the fish bones incident which I thought was a nice gesture from the kitchen to try to right the situation. The fresh baked madelines were the star of the dessert session. Warm madelines took us to butter heaven. The petit fours were not bad as well and complimented our coffees. Service was impeccable. After the somewhat robotic greeting, our waiter warmed up a bit and even the sommelier came by several times to chat; I wonder if they felt guilty about the fish bones. The service staff was prompt, quick and precise. We had one service staff member who I thought acted a bit rushed (maybe he's trying to prove himself?); when he dished out our bread, one of the slices of bread flew out of his tongs right on to my plate. Again, given the 3 star ranking of this place, I find it funny these small bumps in service/food still seep through.All in all, a good experience and a hefty price tag to come with it. I seriously doubt Daniel is deservedly a 3 star Michelin ranking; 2 would have been more appropriate. Me thinks that Daniel got the third star given Boulud's influential rise and position in the culinary world. I have been to 2 star establishments that have had better cuisine and service. Not to say Daniel was not good, it was quite good, however, not 3 star Michelin good. If you were to eat at El Bulli or the French Laundry, I would classify that experience as Michelin 3 star.Although, one could argue that the Michelin ranking systems have become somewhat irregular and/or out of sync with the times? But that's a whole different debate.Daniel: Maybe good to experience once but I would not return.

Warm Guanaja Chocolate Coulant was awesome.Service was amazing, but of course that is what I expected. I am still sad when I look at my credit card bill b/c as a friend said, sometimes you enjoy these places more when you put it on the company card.

5.0,11/15/2009,The revolutionary is a must have drink.  It is a slow-paced delightful restaurant where you are waited on with care.  There is no rush to get you out of the door even though the restaurant is always booked.  The food literally melts in your mouth and the servers continually check in to make sure everything is all right but not to the point that it gets annoying.   The amuse bouche and dessert add ons are a few of the complimentary extras that make the experience even more pleasurable.,0,0,0,Frank S.,"Queens, NY",157,22,0
4.0,11/13/2009,"I must say the space is beautiful and service was flawless. Was it the absolute best meal I have ever had? No. I will say outright that EMP is better in my opinion. But Daniel is definitely a quality institution. You get a lot of freebies and hey you are paying a nice price tag so they should do this. They started me off with a little amuse, then a gift from the chef in the form of a rabbit porchetta terrine, selection from the bread basket which I chose raisin, garlic cheddar, and butter roll. Cheddar was the best.I had a hard time deciding on which appetizer too choose since there were also specials and many sounded great. So the server told me I could do a 4 course menu for $140. Since I am a sucker I went for it. I decided on the following:I had a hard time deciding on which appetizer too choose since there were also specials and many sounded great. So the server told me I could do a 4 course menu for $140. Since I am a sucker I went for it. I decided on the following:1st course- Lobster Soup (forget the actual fancy french name) with Root Vegetables, Duck Prosciutto, Foie Gras, Black Truffles- This was actually very good. I was suspicious because I normally am not huge on soups and feel like they are a waste of stomach space. But when the description has things like Lobster, Duck, and truffles I can't pass that up. The young woman who was my server was incredibly helpful, and she eased any worries I had about there not being much lobster meat. The dish comes with about 4 nice chunks of lobster wrapped in duck prosciutto and 2 chunks of foie gras. The broth contains root vegetables, cream, duck confit, beans, and the truffles. Really was more like a stew than a soup. The broth was deliciously creamy. Lobster was very good and the duck confit made the dish. Only negative was the beans but I am not a huge beans person.2nd- HANDMADE SPINACH TORTELLONI-Chanterelles, Tomme de la Chataigneraie, Lomo, Black Garlic- This was quite delicious. The pasta is handmade and is basically 5 mini raviolis in a delicious broth like sauce. The mushrooms and the lomo (spanish pork) made the dish. I only wish there were more mushrooms and black garlic in there. But overall, this was a very generous portion and the ravioli were stuffed with delicious spinach.3rd- DUO OF DRY AGED BLACK ANGUS BEEFRed Wine Braised Short Rib with Parsnip-Potato GratinSeared Rib Eye with Black Trumpets, Gorgonzola Cream Supplement $13- Let me preface this by saying I think it is ridiculous when a place is already charging an arm and a leg and then they add in supplements because well they can. This is his signature and I must say it was unbelievably good. The only drawback was the portion size. If I didn't add in the extra course I definitely would have left here hungry. I'd rather have smaller appetizers and a large main than the other way around. Daniel seems to have it backwards. Generous app portions and a miniscule main.However, The ribeye was cooked to perfect rare and the short rib was incredibly succulent. Both were covered with a delicious red wine sauce and the gorgonzola cream worked perfectly with the combination of the short ribs and mushroms. The parnsip potato gratin was a 1 inch square of potato heaven. One of the best things I have ever tasted. Again, the only regret here is that everything on this place wasn't three times bigger.Dessert- The cranberry lychee vacherin was delicious and a beautiful presentation. The gianduja sable was comped so I got a nice free dessert. Great complimentary madeleines and petit fours.Overall, the food here was really good, service one of the best no doubt. For the price I think there are definitely better meals and definitely ones that are cheaper and right on par. Nevertheless, I think this is one of those restaurants all foodies should experience and am glad I did. On to the next culinary journey for me.",1,1,1,G C.,"New York, NY",21,264,798

5.0,10/21/2009,"Oh mon dieu! Monsieur Boulud! Let me just say I came to NYC with the main intention of exploring the foodie landscape. This was my first dinner reservation of the trip. We had a reservation for 1030p on Saturday (which was perfectly fine by me since I was still operating on Chicago time). When we arrived around 1020p, our table wasn't quite ready, so we sipped on some sparkling water and these amazing olive bread sticks while we waited in the lounge.When our table was ready, we were guided from the lush dark wood of the lounge into the dimly lit yet amazingly beautiful dining room. (I was envisioning my imaginary multi-million dollar wedding reception happening in that room... It's one of the more beautiful interiors I've seen, restaurant or otherwise. Where's a winning lotto ticket or sugar daddy when you need him?) Our table was dressed with crisp white linens, clean pointelle-themed china, sleek stem and flatware. It was decorated by a small and tastefully elegant floral arrangement and illuminated by a votive. This would be a perfect place for a special date (alas, a great gal pal would have to do!).We were presented with wine and cocktail lists, and I looked on longingly as I couldn't indulge. I settled on a fauxjito while my girl got some sort of white cosmo with a frozen orb that had some sort of flower petal in it. I took a sip and it was delicious (as was my mocktail). In an effort to be moderately budget-conscious, we opted for the three-course prix fixe instead of the more luxe six or eight-course meal. The drawback of such a late dinner reservation is that a lot of the menu items are 86'd by that time of night. No worries. There were so many great options that were still available. I chose the Duo of Hamachi to start while my girl went with the Broiled Sea Scallop Rosette for our appetizers, and her main course was the Elysian Fields Lamb Chop with Sweet Garlic and I went with the Duo of Dry Aged Black Angus Beef per our server's suggestion.While we awaited our first course, we were presented by an array of delectable amuses bouche and the bread service. It was so tempting to gorge on the bread, but I wanted to save room for the rest of the meal. Then came our starters, served in unison by two food runners. (nice touch!) I'm pretty much a sucker for hamachi. And half the duo was Tandoori-spiced? WIN! The other half to this dynamic duo was lettuce wrapped in tartare form. They were both wonderfully presented and balanced in flavor, texture and color. And the scallop rosette? I'm a pretty well-documented hater of brussels sprouts, but that dish WORKED (I think it was the luxe black miso sauce that tied it all together so well).Then came more food runners with our main course, also served in unison with a dramatic unveiling of their silver covers. Of course the plates were gorgeous as well. Everything was so well thought out and seemingly well executed. Carmen's lamb dish was decidedly Mediterranean with the use of pesto, feta and what I deemed a gourmet spanikopita. My dish was definitely the highest form of meat and potatoes, which appealed to my midwestern sensibilities just fine. The braised beef  melted in my mouth. And the carrot puree? Smooth and perfect. The potatoes? Amazing. The seared rib eye left a teensy bit to be desired in texture (not sure if it was the way it was cut or cooked, but it was a little on the chewy side), but the flavor was AMAZING.When it came time for desserts, we were nearly stuffed, but up for the challenge. Again, I asked our server for suggestions and went with their classic Warm Guanaja Chocolate Coulant while Carmen chose the other option I was contemplating, some fantastic melange of strawberries, yuzu sorbet and cake. They were both heavenly (and I'm not a big dessert kinda girl by any measure). And I guess because we expressed to our server that I came explicitly to NYC on a foodie trip, she gave us an extra dessert (the Gianduja Sablé with Hazelnut Cream), which was also wonderfully delicious. By this time, we were pretty much stuffed. But then came the petits fours, which were tasty in their own right. And to add delicious insult to fully stuffed stomach injury the brought the most wonderfully delicious warm madeleines out in the cutest little basket. Like Lay's potato chips, you cannot eat just one. No matter how full you are. I promise you this. Thank heavens for the delicious Verveine tea to help me digest it all, otherwise I would've been toast.The thing about our 1030p reservation is that by the time we'd concluded with the various amuses, bread, starter, main, dessert, petits fours, madeleines and tea, it was late. Like 115a. Pretty much any other restaurant you'd go to, they'd be rushing you through your courses if you're the last reservation of the evening. Here, we barely noticed we were the last customers there. Our service was PERFECT, the food delicious, and we left stuffed!

5.0,10/19/2009,"Not long ago, my parents celebrated their 32nd wedding anniversary by taking themselves (and thankfully their children) to NYC for a few days of fabulousness. I figured since I was one of the best things to come out of their marriage, I deserved the all-inclusive trip =)Before we took off for Manhattan, a friend and culture blogger from my church said we absolutely had to make reservations at Daniel, which she said was the best restaurant in Manhattan. I value her opinion HIGHLY, as her taste is exquisite (I mean, she did give me a list of rare perfumes to purchase at Barney's that even I had never heard of). She knows her stuff, and it showed.Jackets required, no problem because I have this fabulous Oscar de la Renta that I never get to wear in Texas because it's so hot. Mom also got to wear her exquisite Catherine Malandrino dress, but I digress.We had a short wait for our table, so we sat at the bar and I was fascinated with the efficiency and attention to detail the bartenders gave even to the simplest of cocktails. They were also very friendly, even though they were inundated with orders. They welcomed us to NYC and to the restaurant with genuine friendliness.Our table was ready, and although we didn't plan it, we got the table in the far left corner, which gave us a sort of intimacy that we appreciated. Low lights, relaxing atmosphere, obviously a very discerning clientele...the only skecthy guy in the place was what looked to be a greasy Russian mobster with his arms around two model-quality blondes. So cliche.Anyway, we all did the six course tasting menu, and all I can say is it was a rich, tantalizing menu with superb execution. My favorites included the duck foie gras terrine, handmade spinach tortellini, duo of dry aged black angus beef, and the manjari chocolate mousse.As a surprise, they gave us an extra serving of dessert, complete with a confection that said ""Happy Anniversary"". So sweet!The staff was attentive and very affable; like I had read in previous reviews, the place was high on class but low on attitude. The dinner was almost $1000, but it was well worth it!

It is French and you can feel that French je ne sais quoi. Wait I know complete snobbery. The frog legs were good and the foie gras was decadent as expected.  My lamb chop came out nicely but the lamb shoulder or whatever it is  was covered in a mystery garlic sauce.  I couldn't even get it down.  The manager immediately noticed and asked what the problem was.  I told him I prefer the chop sans sauce and he brought me one. I wouldn't have complained so it was nice that they noticedThe best part for me was the cute sommelier with the French accent.

2.0,9/29/2009,"All my friends told me, ""Andy, you have to go see Vicky Cristina Barcelona. It's sooooo good!"" They couldn't stop praising the film, saying it was one of the best movies of the year. Finally, I went to see the movie, and didn't laugh once. I wondered if I had seen a completely different movie from my friends.I feel like I must have went to a different restaurant from the other reviewers. I agree with Andrew C for the most part. My experience at Daniel left me thinking, ""Eh, So what?"" Although the atmosphere and service are excellent, the food fell short. I expected to be wowed but was very disappointed. I'm completely surprised at the high ratings from the other reviewers.First, a word on the ambiance. Very nice setup, very noticeable though the old dudes with their ""daughters"" and, occasionally ""granddaughters"" in sexy dresses. Yeah.... it was like that.On to the food! To start, an amouse bouche trio - a piece of yellowfin, chickpea ""mousse"", and a shrimp in cilantro oil. The yellowfin was warm and had a nasty fishy taste, like the fish had been left out for a few days, then heated, then left to come close to room temperature and served. Let's not kid ourselves here, chickpea mousse? Sounds suspiciously like hummus. Let's look at the recipe for hummus ""Crushed chickpea, lemon juice, olive oil."" Hm.... So, the dish was a flavorless hummus that just made no sense on the plate. It was very boring, necessitating a piece of pita bread or something to save the day. Last, the shrimp. It was decent. Just decent.Next up, the bread. Now, I take my restaurant bread very seriously. A good piece of bread with butter is awesome - forget that pate crap that makes you wish you were chewing your bread with butter but thinking, ""Oh, this pate is different. I find this restaurant unique for serving pate with bread instead of butter. How charming."" This place didn't serve pate though, so it was okay. Forget about it. Anyway, the 80 varieties of bread here didn't stack up to the stuff they serve at Bertucci's. Sure there's walnut raisin bread, garlic something-something, and a regular baguette, but it didn't do it for me.The appetizers, also just okay. The Jerusalem artichoke soup was a brown, bland mess. I didn't get it. The scallop appetizer didn't taste like a scallop, oddly enough, but the ceviche was decent. Decent, no more no less.So, the main courses... Remember that movie Memento when that fellow couldn't remember anything? I was at the restaurant an hour ago, and can barely remember the main courses, if that says anything. I got a beef dish that was average.The desserts all involved a ridiculous ice cream. My peanut butter-chocolate ganache had sweet corn ice cream. Sure enough, the ice cream tasted like sweet corn - didn't at all work with peanut butter and chocolate though. Just because you can make any flavor of ice cream doesn't mean you should. With great ice cream maker comes great responsibility!Overall, nothing stood out in my mind as memorable.

You didn't have to flaunt what you've got by being surrounded by limos and flashing lights, nor did you have to whisper sweet nothings in my ear and make false promises of how great you are, like other restaurants. No, instead you were just you, the definition of New York City sophistication - sleek, refined, and confident.The second I walked inside, I knew I was in love with you. Your spacious, chic atmosphere made me feel elegant (in no way out of place in my fancy black dress) yet comfortable at the same time. And, as soon as our waitress opened with ""I think champagne is the best way to start almost any occasion - a dinner, a night out, breakfast,"" I knew I was in for a great night. Actually, I offered up the breakfast comment, but she laughed and agreed, which made me feel more relaxed than that first glass of champagne.I could go on and on like Shakespeare and count the ways I love you, but really when it comes down to it, there is one thing that absolutely stole my heart - the food. It is rare that I can say this, but every single one of the 8 dishes of the CHEFS TASTING MENU blew me out of the water, not only in terms of presentation, which was the finest presentation I've ever laid eyes on, but also in your choice and quality of ingredients (managing to keep things somewhat seasonal, yet metropolitan at the same time), the combination of flavors, and finally, your execution. Of note, the FOIE GRAS with bing cherry chutney, almond, purslane, and celery was smooth, creamy, and rich enough to leave me satisfied with my portion without wanting more. The RED KING SALMON with citrus cured sorrel, olive oil confit with smoked caviar and a Meyer lemon coulis was deliciously light and refreshing. The BABY SQUID made me feel good about eating infants, as it was perfectly cooked and paired with Mediterranean ingredients which complimented the chewy texture of the squid. Finally, and most importantly, the LIBERTY FARMS DUCK BREAST was the best duck I've ever tasted - perfectly crisped skin, tender, moist, with a roasted plum to bring out its natural sweetness and a rich reduction that didn't overshadow the rest of the plate. Daniel, to put it simply, you had me at ""hello."" No really, you did, literally, as I actually got the opportunity to say ""hello"" to Daniel Boulud himself and have a lively 15 minute conversation (in French!) with the celebrity chef after most of the other diners had cleared the restaurant. It was at that moment, at the end of the night, when I knew this had been one of the best dining experiences of my life, rivaled only by the French Laundry. Daniel, how can I ever forget you?

As per the chef's trademark lofty standards, the service was warm, impeccable, and the food. . . well. Let's just say that today's Cup 'O Noodles are going down rough on this butter-waxed throat of mine.  My companion and I did double duty on the six course tasting menu ($175 pp), to ensure that we sampled a hundred percent of the goods:Canapes were pea-themed; sugar snap, pureed, and whole, served alongside snips of lobster and whitefish.Round 1: Foie gras terrine and bing cherry chutney vs rabbit chorizo porchetta.Both cold plates were excellent; the tart of the cherry gave the foie gras a slight edge. Round 2:Shrimp and Iberian ham vs tai snapper ceviche in cucumber puree.. . . easily, the latter, with tapioca pearls providing textural complexity.Round 3:Butter poached abalone vs spinach tortelone.A rhyming round! KO for the abalone; the pasta was plebian. Ding! Round 4:Lightly seared yellowfin tuna vs black sea bass with syrah sauce.Buttery bass was a touch too rich at this point in the meal; hats off to the tuna, for showing me the meaning of 'perfectly cooked'. Round 5:Garlic lamb chop with mint zucchini vs dry aged black angus duo.Overzealous sauce rendered both meats salt-heavy; the braised short ribs trumped the seared rib-eye, which trumped the accompanying corn fricasse and braseola-topped cornbread. A narrow victory to the beef. Round 6:Poached pineapple Napoleon vs chocolate lava cake The caramel-filled cake went half-finished (I was heaving); the pineapple, served with a coconut ganache and pina colada sorbet, was much more special.

We had the six-course tasting menu:- Foie Gras Terrine with Marcona Almond / Pate of Squab and Foie Gras- Maine Peekytoe Crab / Duo of Hamachi- Paprika Crusted Maine Lobster Tail / Beaufort Ravioli with Green Peppercorn- Crispy Salmon with Tarragon Cream / Black Sea Bass with Syrah Sauce- Elysian Fields Farm Lamb Chop / Duo of Dry Aged Black Angus Beef- Cilantro Poached Pineapple with Coconut / Tainori Chocolate Dacquoise with Rice CrispyAlmost everything was delicious, except for the Maine Lobster dish.  Unfortunately, it was overcooked and you know what lobster tastes like when it's overcooked - tough! It was inedible and I was disappointed because I took one bite and did not continue after that. The server noticed that I ate everything on that plate except for the lobster and asked what was wrong. I told her that it was a little over cooked. She nodded her head and took the plate away. I was a bit disappointed that she didn't even utter ""sorry"". But whatever, I didn't want to let that ruin the meal. So as they were changing our cutlery for the next dish, I noticed the servers came back and took away our knives and forks and replaced it with spoons. We were a bit confused at this point, but then the servers came back with two plates of risotto. Our server said, ""Mr. Boulud apologizes for the lobster."" And then she brings out the biggest black truffle I have ever seen and begins shaving a generous pile of truffle over our risotto. We were happily surprised, the only thing that would've been better was if Mr. Boulud himself came out and did that! The dish was exquisite and the truffles were so fragrant and unforgettable.Post dessert, we were served with a basket of warm madeleines and a plate of petit fours. We were really full at this point but we managed to eat a few madeleines - so warm, buttery and lemony. We didn't even touch the petit fours, so when our server came around she said she could package that up for us and leave it for us to pick up at coat check. We noticed that she even gave us another fresh batch of madeleines in our little to-go package! But the best part of the evening was seeing Daniel Boulud walking around the dining room!It's an expensive meal but worth the visit. It was such a treat to dine there and I am glad it lived up to it's many accolades!",2,1,1,DineoutGal A.,"Winnipeg, Canada",92,849,3873
5.0,8/7/2009,"Daniel is definitely on my ""Top Ten"" list of best restaurants in NYC. In fact, it's safe to say that it's in my top 3. It's also the only restaurant I've ever been to where my handbag got it's own little ottoman...lol. For that and MANY other reasons, I highly recommend Daniel to anyone who is looking for a great dining experience. My husband and I came here to celebrate a special occasion recently. From start to finish, our dining experience was impeccable. The atmosphere is lovely and so serene. Once you step inside, you feel like you are a million miles away from the bustling streets of Manhattan. The decor is rich and tasteful - beautiful flowers everywhere and the lighting is just right. We sat in the ""balcony"" area (the main restaurant is basically one large sunken room with a raised sort of balcony area surrounding it on all 4 sides). The view from this area is the best in my opinion because you are overlooking the rest of the restaurant. The service from start to finish was perfect. We had an entire ""staff' of servers that were polished, professional and friendly. The sommelier was incredibly knowledgeable and warm as well. If any waitstaff ever deserved a 40% tip, this is it. Culinary skills delight and amaze here. from appetizer to dessert, each course was like a flawless work of art. Seriously. The portions, although not large, really seem to fill you up because there are all these extra little amuse-bouches served in between courses. Even with dessert, we got an additional ""dessert"" of these fresh baked mini madeilenes as well as these amazing home made chocolates afterwards! The highlight of our evening was when Daniel himself came out and walked around the dining room, greeting his clientele! Considering he oversees a small restaurant empire at this point, I never expected to actually see him make an appearance! Daniel gets my vote for one of the best and romantic restaurants in NYC. For a special occasion, you cannot beat this place - it is worth every dollar!",0,0,0,Michelle L.,"NY, NY",82,170,76
5.0,8/1/2009,"Amazing amazing.  If you are looking to be treated like royalty without all the pretentiousness, this is the place to be.The service is mostly what deserves the 5 star.  I went there for my birthday and I am surprised how genuine they still are considering how many people go there for their birthdays.  We were fed from the moment we sat down to the moment we left.  They were attentive but not pushy.  The service really shines at the end when I ordered their tea and they keep on coming back to pour more into my cup.  I don't even need to pour my own tea.  The tea is always hot and enjoyable.The food is good but doesn't blow my mind.  The dessert is what blew my mind.  The most memory course I had was the Duo Angus Beef.  Beautifully presented and great flavors.  For appetizer, try the handmade spinach Tortelloni, I never imagine it to be so good.  The Red King Salmon was okay.  All in all listen to the server's advice, usually their recommendations are the best ones.  Do not leave without trying their Warm Guanaja Chocolate Coulant.  This is what blew my mind.Would I come back?  Definitely.  It's pricey but so worth it.  The place is amazingly classy.  The interior design is amazing.  So down-to-earth yet classy.  The lounge were very comfortable.  We were sitting on some big comfy sofa and is very intimate.  It was also relaxing with the low light condition.  Love this place.  They still got it!",0,0,1,Loretta H.,"San Francisco, CA",10,97,22

5.0,7/3/2009,"It was time.  It had been two months since Le Bernardin, so, naturally, my adult-game face had been tucked into my random odds and ends drawer and was now ready to once again expose itself in public.It had been a walk-about day.  Milk Thistle Chocolate milk from the market with the day-after Craft muffin, and hours after such a 6-year-old, cartoon watching breakfast, I was putting on a pink cocktail dress and walking up Fifth Avenue with my heels in my hand.  Upon entrance through the revolving door, I immediately felt chic and sassy.  ""Reservation for W.  Brenna W.,"" I announced proudly.  We were told to wait at the bar where, luckily, there were two open seats.  We sat down and absorbed the details of the garnishes waiting for use in clear, glass ice boxes in front of suave bartenders who were all too skilled.  They recommended their signature cocktail, a take on the Cosmopolitan.  Though I'm not normally a vodka drinker, I happily obliged.  It was served like a modern art piece, a martini glass with an ice sphere frozen with a floral piece instilled in it, almost too lovely to drink.I took my cocktail to our table a half hour after our reservation.  Since it was so late, we were told we only had a few minutes to decide whether or not we wanted to try to Chef's Tasting menu.  Like the impulse buy section at the cash register, we made a quick decision and went for it.  We ordered the same 'Ferrari' Champagne that we'd had at Le Bernardin; it goes well with everything, probably even with bacon and French toast.  The bubbles helped the green, pea themed amuse bouche along nicely, which was more than a single bite but a trio of slurps, bites, and melts.  The six courses that followed were nothing short of incredible.  I devoured the fava with agnolotti (a dish that made the little girl inside me scream with glee), sifted the buttery bass in my mouth, and fell in love with the duo of beef.  When dessert came I was too full to refuse sweets; and when they brought us a third dessert because we are such a lovely couple, I couldn't wait until a half hour from then, the moment when I'd surely be slipping into my sugar coma.We left at 1:30a.m.  I'd never closed out an upscale restaurant before, but I felt like the slim row of petites fours were permission to stay longer.  After light words with the staff (who'd just won a James Beard award for service--it shows), I realized that maybe I didn't have to worry about acting so adult after all.",1,0,0,Blah B.,"Brooklyn, NY",156,14,1
3.0,7/2/2009,"On a Thursday night after 9:45 and with a reservation, we had to wait half an hour for the table. The cocktails were good but did not blow me away, even though the amuse-bouche/snacks that went with them were a delight. Once we were installed at our table, it took quite a while for the waiter to come to us, and I must say that I did not like his familiarity too much (asking us where we were from and what we did). Not that it mattered too much, but at a place like Daniel, you'd expect the waiters to be more efficient and less chatty. The sommelier was very competent, and our wine was divine, yes. The sourdough bread was frankly mediocre: dry and chewy. The butter bread was a little better, but not up to what you'd expect in a Relais et Chateaux. The appetizer of trio of salmon was a little sparse, but the market appetizer of langoustines was delicious. For an entree, we had the duo of beef, with the braised rib part a tad too sweet for its own good, and maybe useless when all what was needed was the exquisitely tender filet; the market entree, the crispy calf's head, was a disappointment for the true calf's head lover that I am. Yes, the meat melted in your mouth, but deep-frying it was completely unnecessary. Why turn a tête-de-veau into a tablier de sapeur? The side of vegetable that came with it was actually tastier and quite extraordinary (vegetables that taste like something without any spices or sauce, hard to find in New York). The best part (with the wine) was the dessert: the praline and cherries would reconcile anyone who like me doesn't enjoy the alliance of berries and chocolate, the complimentary birthday cake with a heart of caramel was close to one of the best coulants I ever had (even though it was still too sweet), and the complimentary madeleines (we were the last diners in the room, and desserts were lavishly bestowed on us). . fresh from the oven and AWEsome, if I may. But I agree, there are too many chocolate items on the dessert menu. A little more diversity wouldn't harmIt was a very nice dining experience, yes, but I have seen much better service, and had better food before. For less of a reservation fuss and less of a price.

I'm not a cheese person, but it was the BEST BEST cheese experience. As for the dessert course it was ....superb!  I have a HUGE sweet tooth and it satisfied me.  They gave me an additional dessert with a birthday candle!

Yes, I did. And he asked me how to spell it. I told him not to worry, his reviews on YELP are all really good.

It really is more about extracting the flavor from the protein than adding for flavor. Favorite dishes include the lobster tail and the black angus beef. The lobster tail was so warm, inviting and comforting. Everyone at our table was savoring each bite slowly so to prolong the bliss as much as possible. The braised short ribs were so tender I really did not have any use for a knife. The sunchokes and potato croquettes were a wonderful addition to the dish. The salmon dish was so incredibly flavorful, Mr. Boulud is truly a master chef. Never have I tasted anything so perfectly seasoned. The desert was a wonderful showcase of how delectable chocolate is. Combining chocolate mousse with lemon curd was a brilliant move. The dish of petite fours were so beautiful it was a pity to watch each piece go. As we were celebrating two occasions, they were nice enough to bring out two other desert dishes with candles. Service was impeccable, in every sense of the word. Mr Boulud walked around his restaurant greeting guests, happily posing for pictures and it is quite apparent that his waitstaff thoroughly enjoy working for him.

It doesn't matter if you're there with someone who is simply not the one for you, or if you hate your job, or if you simply want to die. And no matter how good you are at hiding that from yourself, no matter how easily you slip in with the throngs of placid, ""good"" people, it all slips away.

That said, he doesn't have an eatery in New York, and so when in back in the Big Apple, I frequent my old haunt Daniel whenever possible. Back when I was a regular I would never order off the menu, and upon more recent return visits, even as a non-regular I found that this was still possible. I like the sort of restaurant where you tell the chef what you like and the kitchen does an amazing interpretation of it. You're going to pay dearly for the privilege, but you're worth it.",1,1,1,Tal K.,"Birmingham, MI",401,234,4
4.0,3/4/2009,"Daniel is the place for you if you are  quasi-filthy rich or if someone gave you a gift card. In my case it was the latter. I received a gift certificate from my former realtor, pre-the-subprime mortgage crisis. Finally got around to using it recently after seeing a play at Primary Stages (59 E 59th Street). And we had a ball. We opted for eating in the bar. The room is dark, but the bar itself is all lit up and sparkly. And don't forget to look up. The ceiling is an intricately painted carved expanse of wooden beams. I asked the server for vegetarian options and was handed a whole separate vegetarian menu (which was essentially a creative repackaging of the main menu's side dishes, but still...most restaurants don't even think to do something so simple yet dignified for the growing number of vegetarians out there). The restaurant is also a showcase for  'shrooms, including a full mushroom tasting. Many mushroom dishes, and the server said ""we have something new back there..I'll have to check which ones just came in today from Oregon.""  My man loved his venison dish (first words out of his mouth ""omg""). They bake everything on premises, so multiple choices of bread and rolls were offered to us several times on a big flat basket. As well as a tray of petit fours at dessert time. Actually, you don't really need to order dessert because the petit fours do the trick. Servers were great. Only complaint really had to do with whether one hand was in touch with the other, as seemlessly as one might hope for in a restaurant of this stature. Eg, after declaring my vegetarian status to one server, the other came over 10 minutes later with a three tiered ""amuse bouche"" tray that was mostly seafood-based. But we also enjoyed the fact that our servers could talk in-depth about Daniel's sophisticated menu and wines, while also regaling us with stories about the best pyrotechnic, bottle juggling bartenders in NYC (near Chinatown).  Also, if you're not up for a whole meal here, coming in for a cocktail is always an option before or after heading off to other parts.",1,1,0,Teresa E.,"New York, NY",2,49,31
5.0,3/2/2009,"It's hard to find fault with Daniel. Literally every detail, every dish and every member of the waitstaff is perfectly on point.The meal began right on time -- we had a reservation at 845 and were seated promptly. None of the Le Cirque b.s. wherein you're shuttled to the bar to wait for your reservation, leaving you wondering why in fact you'd booked it to begin with. The host and maitre d' were polished but most importantly, they're relaxed.  No supercilious nonsense here, just warm friendly service that continued through the meal.We both settled on the 3 course prix-fixe, mine with the wine paring as well. The tableside bread selection is a great touch -- I'll shamefully admit that I tried each type and can vouch for the lot of them.  I tried all of my dining partner's food, as well as my own and I can safely say that nothing was short of exquisite. Beginning with our amuse bouche from the kitchen, a three-part sweet potato variation, the meal never ceased to amaze.  Her foie gras was substantial, buttery and nicely crisped, my ravioli were sublime, decadent yet controlled. Her duo of beef was a landmark dish, and I think I can safely say the braised ribeye, which basically fell apart on sight, redefined how I understand beef. It's in a dish like this that you see the immense talent of the chefs -- Daniel's no steak house but it's steak will give any restaurant in Manhattan a run for its money.  My dover sole was also excellent, subtle well-paired with cauliflower gratin. I should point out that the sommelier sagely selected a versatile pinot that nicely accompanied both my dish and hers, a credit to his ability not just to understand wine, but more importantly to understand the dining/sharing situation. Our desert was a meal in and of itself, beginning with an assortment of pastries before our deserts proper, and finishing with warm madeleines. If pomp and circumstance are your thing, then Le Cirque's a better bet. But for low-key special occasions where Swifty's isn't quite enough, Daniel fits the (hefty) bill.",1,0,0,nate r.,"New York, NY",30,98,4
4.0,3/1/2009,"I reaaaaally want to give Daniel 5 stars, but the service precludes me from doing so.First, the food was presented so beautifully and each dish had so many intricate flavors that it was really fun to try to figure out what was in each. The entire meal was extremely tasty as well. I had the three course prix fixe meal and started out with the Pate of Squab and Foie Gras. The second course for me was Duo of Dry Aged Black Angus Beef. My girlfriend has the Duo of Hamachi and the Black Sea Bass with Syrah Sauce. All the dishes were absolutely perfect, delicious, and filling. Then, came dessert. My girlfriend and I shared the Gala Apple Confit and the Warm Guanaja Chocolate Coulant. The chocolate coulant was one of the best dessert dishes I have ever had! I loved both desserts and the petit fours were incredible!Now, I must talk a little about the service which for the price we paid for our meal, was pretty atrocious. We had a reservation and had to wait about a half hour before being seated. Half that time was spent standing by the bar since there was no place to sit which was extremely annoying. Once we were seated our waiter treated us like we didn't belong there... like we were too young and inexperienced or something. I couldn't quite tell why he didn't seem to like us. Also, the time between courses was forever. From the time we sat down to the time we left was over 3 hours! It was good they didn't rush us but for a three course meal, I felt it was too long.It was a mix of two sides. The food was top notch. The service left a lot to be desired. But... did I mention the food was top notch!! Oh, and by the way, Daniel himself kept walking around the room talking to people which was really cool!",0,0,0,Sam G.,"Washington, DC",17,173,1

5.0,2/21/2009,"We don't get to come to NYC often, so we wanted to hit a few of the nice restaurants. To date, we've tried Per Se, Le Bernadin, and Jean Georges.In comparison, we found Daniel to be our best experience so far in NYC, and we thought it compared well with French Laundry! Here are some of the reasons why:The menu was great. We had the 6 course truffle tasting menu, along with almost all the options of the featured Burgundy 6 course tasting menu (since we ordered two of those and the diners varied their choices). Since the food is almost always done at a high level, we rank fine dining experiences by how many make/supplant entries in our top ten, and found 3 worthy entries in this regard.The service was great. We enjoyed the attentiveness (they brought a purse stool for one of our group's purse, which was a first for me) and synchronicity of presentation. We foud the French accents charming, probably because our group spoke French and love Paris. YMMV.The environment was very interesting as well. On average, I'd probably find Jean Georges more interesting, but when we visited Daniel, we had interesting fellow diners and were in the mood to observe artwork, which happens to adorn the walls at Daniel. As well, Chef came out to greet us, which was a first! The only other places that has happened for us were at Manresa and Ritz Carlton SF (though I think we stalked Ron Siegel, perhaps, and not the other way around). Per Se and French Laundry invited us tour the kitchen and observe the satellite uplink (perhaps for time management reasons) but that was a nice touch.All in all, we found the Daniel experience to hit all cylinders and match or mood and surpass our expectations. We'll certainly try all the other restaurants again when we visit NYC as it took us 4 tries at Gary Danko before we fell in love with it.",0,0,2,Walter W.,"Redwood City, CA",566,187,8
5.0,2/20/2009,"There are a number of ways I could decide to begin my review of Daniel.  In the spirit of ""Choose Your Own Adventure,"" I could be clever/funny/cool and ask you to take your pick of any one of the following, and you would likely not blink an eye:1) Have you ever had a pear chip? [IF THIS IS YOUR FAVORITE, GO TO (A).]2) I tried every type of bread available tonight. [IF THIS IS YOUR FAVORITE, GO TO (B).]3) You know a place is posh when your purse gets its very own stool. [IF THIS IS YOUR FAVORITE, GO TO (C).]4) Nothing like having four desserts to celebrate your birthday. [IF THIS IS YOUR FAVORITE, GO TO (D).]or, my personal favorite...5) My belt popped during my meal. Literally. [IF THIS IS YOUR FAVORITE, GO TO (E).]* ~ * ~ *A) Imagine a potato chip...but erase the -otato and add -ear. Paper thin and concentrated in flavor, this deceptively simple element of my amazing star anise roasted pear dessert was probably the highlight of that course.B) With the exception of the sourdough varieties (although I'm from San Francisco, I dislike sourdough -- I know, this is sacrilege!), I had, in chronological order, the olive roll, the sweet butter roll, the roasted nut slice, the raisin and walnut slice, the mini French baguette, and the garlic focaccia.  In case you couldn't tell, that is a lot of bread. Add to that the fact that they even REPLACED my butter dish (with a brand new pat of butter)...and you get the picture. Although they were all good in their own way, I have two comments: (1) I was not a fan of the dry dusting of something-or-other on the garlic focaccia, and (2) the sweet butter roll was divine. It was, essentially, the epitome of what bread should be.C) And if that doesn't tip you off, then the fact that it takes three servers to serve you your one dish should.D) Imagine my surprise when, upon receiving my roasted pear dessert, a molten chocolate cake dish, plate of petit fours, and basket of freshly baked madelines also materialized...voila!E) In my defense, my belt was a patent leather wrap belt that very easily slides one way to the other in the style of the following: img4.realsimple.com/imag….  Still, it was more than worth the three-and-a-half pounds I gained in one evening. I had never understood the term ""food coma"" until that night. I think Nico stared at me a few times with the ""WTF happened to her??"" look on his face.* ~ * ~ *In lieu of any of the above, however, I believe the following should suffice:That day, the twenty-_____th anniversary of my birth, shall henceforth be known as the day on which I experienced the most amazing meal in New York...ever.There.I said it.AMAZING. And my best in New York...(so far).The service was hospitable and welcoming.  On a side note, I was surprised to discover that, contrary to what one may expect, it is NOT a requirement to speak French to work here.  Even so, conversation with the servers can be un petit probleme...because their probably-French accents make everything -- even garlic bread -- sound exotic.  I used Open Table to reserve, but called up the restaurant to change numbers.  They did not bat an eyelash when I changed my reservations down to one person. Yes, I went to Daniel alone. Yes, I had an amazing time. People really need to stop freaking out about how ""brave"" you have to be to eat out alone. Are you comfortable with yourself? Do you not like your own company? I think these questions go to a deeper problem than just a simple solo meal can address.However, I digress. The food was wonderful, and even with ""just"" the three course prix fixe, I was still full 36 hours later. Yup. Pretty crazy.The cast (in order of appearance):Amuse bouche of a trio of beets-inspired dishes.Appetizer of paprika-crusted Maine lobster tail with roast broccolini and this punchy spiced pine nuts sauce.(Surprise guest appearance by) Chef's complimentary dish of ravioli in a sweet-ish brown sauce.Main course of duck two-ways (breast and a dark meat egg-roll-type thing). The duck was succulent, and the skin was delicious, but I didn't like the citrus (grapefruit?) used on top....could have done better with Mandarin orange in my opinion.Dessert of star anise roasted pear on gingerbread with a scoop of toasted pecan ice cream.(Second surprise guest appearance by) Chef's complimentary dessert of a molten lava chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream.Petit fours...and freshly baked madelines........with a consistent cast of extras in the form of the olive roll, the sweet butter roll, the roasted nut slice, the raisin and walnut slice, the mini French baguette, and the garlic focaccia.Is it any surprise my belt popped?110% worth eating Ramen and Cup O'Noodles for a week in order to drop the $165 (which, I note, is surprisingly affordable....for (i) no alcohol, (ii) an order of bottled water, (iii) tea with dessert, and (iv) a 25%+ tip) to experience this masterpiece.",27,21,25,Audrey J.,"Los Angeles, CA",605,618,78

I had the FOIE GRAS TERRINE, which was much lighter and simpler in texture and flavor, but still creamy and delicious.[Domaine Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey, Chassagne-Montrachet La Maltroie  2006]I went with the MAINE PEEKYTOE CRAB while J had the YELLOWFIN TUNA TARTAR WITH CAVIAR.  Order the tuna tartar.. it was magnificently presented, as well as fresh, properly seasoned and well matched to the tiny black salty pearls of caviar.  Even though it wasn't my dish, it was one my favorites of the evening.  The crab was a blander dish, erring on the side of watery crab salad.. would not recommend.[Les Héritiers du Comte Lafon, Mâcon-Villages 2007]Next, we both had the KATAIFI CRUSTED SEA SCALLOPS.  This was J's favorite dish, although I didn't care for the steak-like treatment of the scallop.  The porcini mushrooms, however, were the most delectable porcini mushrooms I've ever had.[Domaine Chandon de Briailles, Savigny-Lès-Beaune Les Lavières 2006]We both had the BAKED ATLANTIC BAR WITH MAINE LOBSTER.  Once I saw lobster, do you think I got past that?  And the lobster was amazing.  I love the French!  I love tender lobster claw, perhaps poached, tasting of the sea, and butter, and lobster-y goodness.  J detested the bar.. I ate mine up, but it was different.[Domaine Henri Gouges, Nuits-Saint-Georges 2006]In the last of the savory, J had the ELYSIAN FIELDS FARM LAMB CHOP, which he quite enjoyed.  I don't like lamb, so I tried a bite.. it tasted to me like.. well, lamb.  I had the DUO OF DRY AGED BLACK ANGUS BEEF, which was heaven in beef.  I don't like short ribs, so J polished those off.. but the seared rib eye.. sigh.  Moist, tender, juicy.. each bite was better than the next.[Domaine Denis Mortet, Gevrey-Chambertin, 2006]For dessert, I had the CILANTRO POACHED PINEAPPLE WITH COCONUT [Royal Tokaji 5 Puttonyos, Hungary, 2003].  J had the TAINORI CHOCOLATE DACQUOISE WITH RICE CRISPY [Rozès Port, Late Bottled Vintage, 1994].  We ended with a huge basket of warm Madeleines and the usual mignardises.Six Course Tasting $175 ppWine Pairing $95 ppFINAL NOTES:Go to Daniel on a weeknight.  The weekend crowd ranged from the usual to downright skank.  At one of the nearby tables we could overhear some 45-year old's 24-year old mistress loudly begging him to pay her rent this month because she loved him, babyyyy!  Seriously?Jean-Georges vs. Daniel- Although I shouldn't generalize until I revisit Daniel, I have found the waitstaff at Jean-Georges to always be more pleasant than Daniel's difficult to understand, at times absent staff on this particular night.  Decor-wise, hands down Jean-Georges.  Lastly, on food, it would be pretty much tied, which is why Jean-Georges comes out on top for the overall experience.",7,6,4,Sara S.,"New York, NY",157,107,121

5.0,2/8/2009,"Well then. Welllll then. That was something. And I never thought it would happen to me, not in a million years. To find myself inside Daniel's bar and lounge being treated like a princess with my friend, the birthday girl. Frankly we weren't sure how to take it. How we were thanked for handing over a bread plate to load up on more bread, or to be treated with such patience..such grace.Frankly, this would be a great horror/sci-fi concept. Aliens take over the world by working in fine dining establishments. They're so nice, it's almost eerie, filling you up on amuse bouchees and liquor until you are too fat to waddle out. Then they've got you. But back to Daniel. The mood and atmosphere was excellent, despite being the two youngest (and poorest) people there. But it's good to splurge once in your life, no?The meal began with a selection of breads: olive roll for me, raisin bread for her. Then the cocktails: I had the passion ginger which was absolutely fantastic, though my friend was less impressed by her $29 strawberry pearls drink. Creative, yes, and beautiful, sure, but very very strong.Then came the amuse bouches on a three tiered stand. A trio of cauliflower, we were told. Cauliflower was pureed into soup and served with a cracker spoon. It garnished a single bite of shrimp, and it laced a beauitful cube of mackerel. Then came the stuffed conch, and finally the terrine (my friend isn't a foodie and was pretty impressed by the stuff.) And then of course came the food we actually ordered - I was already on the brink of fullness. My friend ordered the luscious beaufort ravioli with speck, brussels sprouts, green peppercorn, and black trumpet mushrooms. Delicious, and very very rich.I decided to go nuts and order a seasonal special: watercress veloute (rich and thick) with a frog's leg souffle. It was my first time ever eating the haunches of the popular amphibian, and it lived up to my expectations as an addictively tender and slightly chewy cousin of chicken. And paired with the souffle, it was a heavenly texture combination. Already my friend and I had to go to the bathroom, and bad. So we left the table together, only to come back and find our dishes were missing. The plates had been taken away to be warmed, and new silver was brought out as well. Little touches like that are something to be savored.Since we came pretty late we decided to only share an entree: duo of black angus beef. We had the steak medium, and it was juicy, my friends. The shortribs literally cut like butter, and the sunchoke puree simply added to the velvety richness. Red wine sauce was the thickness of fabulously deep red blood (and tasty too) while the hazelnut potato croquette was fluffy and tasted exactly like it should have. Then came dessert. Oh dessert. Of course it was impossible to decide on what we wanted. So the waiter, being the extremely nice gentlman he is, suggested a surprise selection. Hell, we'll take it. We were presented with a gorgeous birthday plate adorned with a candle. This I believe was the star anise roasted pear, served with pecan ice cream and gingerbread. Great, but our favorite was a toss up between the warm chocolate coulant with liquid caramel, fleur del sel, and milk sorbet; and the hazelnut mousse with gianduja, milk chocolate, and caramel ice cream. Elegant, devestating to the waistline, but totally worth it. We also thoroughly enjoyed the huckleberry and orange vacherin, and an intriguing pineapple dessert that I  can't seem to find on the menu. To top of the sweets overload, we were given warm madeleines and a plate of petit fours: all flavorful and delicately perfect.Along with dessert we each had a glass of Tokaji as well as a cup of mint tea. I was sold, and suffering from food coma. Again, totally worth it. Would I go here again?

4.0,1/25/2009,"Walking into Restaurant Daniel is like walking into a french chateau with rich colors and flowers everywhere, its really one of the most stunning restaurants I have walked into. Everyone seemed happy, smiling, and talking to one another and it reminded me of a foodie french mafia. I decided to dine in the lounge because it looked very appealing especially for a solo diner like myself. The lounge is a small, intimate, dark room consisting of about 8 or so tables and seemed much more quieter than the main dining room. With waiters direct from France, I feel Chef Daniel wants his guests to feel like there dining in his homelandTo start my meal I went with the Maine Peekytoe Crab with Fuji Apples, Celery Creme Fraiche, Hearts of Palm. It was wrapped in a roll, much like a sushi roll, with a rich yet light sauce that paired very well with the crab. It was a good dish but not excellent. For my entree I went with the Pan Roasted Halibut with Pine Nut-Grape Chutney, Celery, Verjus. WOW, I've been craving this dish ever since I had it. The Halibut so light and flaky it just melts in your mouth. The Pine Nut-Grape Chutney added a earthy sweetness to the dish that was mouth watering. This dish is in my Top 5 of all time. Just beautiful, tasty, and memorable! For desert I went with the Tainori Chocolate Dacquoise with Rice Crispy, Lemon Curd, and Dark Chocolate Ice Cream. Like a rich double fudge chocolate brownie with rich dark chocolate ice cream with a mini thin chocolate rice crispy treat on top that tasted just like Kellogg's! If your a chocolate person this desert is calling your name but was a little to rich for me. Overall a good meal, one excellent dish, but I was hoping for a little more. Service was good but a little slow at times. Chef Daniel was out and about talking to all the guests and even though he never came and greeted me he did take the time to sign a menu for me which was cool. I love Chefs who care about there guests and enjoys talking to them and I can see that in Chef Daniel.

We started off in the bar area, where Daniel, himself, was walking around and talking with customers. It was pretty cool to see him out and about. The champagne mojito was probably the best mojito I've ever had. The bar staff was the friendliest group of guys as well. Very professional and very helpful.After drinks at the bar, we were escorted to our table. After about 5 minutes, my drink which I purposely left at the bar, arrived at my table. The bartenders figured I forgot it and had it sent to my table.The staff was very friendly and highly professional. Almost too professional as nothing would cause them to crack a smile. They made excellent recommendations and we took their advice.

A glass of ""house"" champagne is more than $20... Amuse bouche: Trio of sweet potato: the one with white sturgeon was special among the three but none of them were memorable... Complementary breads: the one with sweet garlic and parmasean was really good, the other three I tried were just okay... First course: Red-legged partridge consomee, the savoy cabbage was a bit too crisp, the foie gras was indistinct and felt almost unnecessary, the partridge itself was delicious, the root vegetables were a little overcooked, and the broth was just a bit too oily -- and this was the star dish of my meal; the wine pairing was okay but not terrific... Second course: Black sea bass with Syrah sauce, the leek royale were fine but underseasoned and overdecorated, the pommes Lyonnaise were fine but slightly overseasoned and looked drab on the plate, the fish itself was perfectly cooked with tremendous texture but the accompanying sauce was overly gelatinous and too peppery; the wine pairing was okay but not great... Dessert: Hazelnut Mousse with Gianduja, it came with something that resembled a Japanese chocolate Pocky, the mousse itself was delicious but bombarded with extremely crunchy yet bland ""crunch,"" the caramel ice cream was absolutely wonderful; the sauternes that came with it was delicious but nothing exceptional... The complementary Madeline were, as always, incredible... The complementary petit-four selections were excellent and very interesting... When the check came there was a promotion for Chef Boulud's new casual downtown restaurant (coming soon), as you walk in there are a few promotions for Chef Boulud's current restaurants and upcoming events, as you walk to and from the bathrooms downstairs there are promotions for Chef Boulud's featured beer selections (which are underwhelming), on the menu there are at least 3 different menus to choose from with a couple dozen possible choice-swapping combinations -- I think that there's too much time and effort spent trying to show you why you should come back and where you should eat next rather than reminding you why  you love food so much to begin with.",9,1,3,David L.,"New York, NY",849,1168,1211
5.0,1/8/2009,"BEST MADELINES! Daniel, being the ambassador to the chefs, did not disappoint w/ his food. If you guys watch After Hours w/ Daniel Boulud on HD, you guys know that he is highly regarded in the chef kingdom. For the US, I would say top 3 are Keller, JG, and DB. I've been meaning to come here FOREVER! First and foremost, I'd like to say that Adam Tihany did a great job w/ the renovations. I believe they were closed all Summer for that. As you walk through the revolving doors, to your left is the coat check. Down the steps to the right is the bar. Down the steps to the left is the host. Further down is the dining room. The entire table was indifferent about 3 courses/$105 or 6 courses/$175 so we opted for the latter. Such tough choices with the ORs on the menu. Off the menu, we asked if we could have hot foie and they much obliged. They substituted the first app (foie terrines/pates) w/ that. The service is super attentive, knowledgeable, and inobtrusive. The complimentary hot madelines at the end were CRACKTACULAR! So were the complimentary petit fours at the end. Heck, I liked the petit fours better than my dessert. I had 2: one was the coconut and the other was the coffee. There are specials to be had, like 3 courses plus wine pairing for $98 (Mon-Thurs, 5:30-6:30) and dessert plus a drink for $25 at the lounge past 9:30pm. My friend raved about the scallop here so I must try next time! This place definitely ranks up there w/ Gordon Ramsay as my top tasting menu experiences, but Gordon edges out only cuz it's cheaper. We will definitely be back for the $98 special. Jacket required for men.6 COURSE TASTING MENU ($175)-Pan seared foie gras (substitution) - too small, so good, i wish i could have 20 of these, CRACKTACULAR!-Maine peakytoe crab (fuji apple, celery creme fraiche, hearts of palm) - ample crab meat, tastes much better than the crab roll @ Sasabune, SO FRESH I TASTED THE SEA IN THIS!-Kabocha squash ravioli w/ sage (brussels sprouts, hen of the woods, pork belly) - kabocha is a Japanese winter squash, 2pcs, excellent, this was up there w/ the pumpkin ravioli @ Olana-Grilled halibut - tender, untampered, no skin =(, almost too healthy for me but delish -Duo of dry aged black angus beef (red wine braised short rib w/ sunchokes, seared rib eye w/ hazelnut-potato croquette) - you don't get asked how you want your steak, this is supposedly a signature dish here, allow me to demystify any hype - the short rib is stellar, up there w/ Burke's and Scalini's, but I wasn't feeling the rib eye, as it tasted more like a glob of filet IMO, then again, I'm not crazy about filet, but more of the seared steak variety-Hazelnut mousse w/ gianduja (milk chocolate, caramel ice cream) - mousse was good but too light and airy for me, i prefer denser mousses, wrapped in chocolate shell, caramel ice cream was def homemade and very complex, good job-Madelines (free) - hot from the oven, makes Financier's look like child's play, as it puts those to shame!-Petit fours (free) - coconut was amazing, coffee w/ flaky bits under was stellarTotal came out to $225 after everythingI took my foodie meetup here:Pics to follow...",4,2,3,Jeff C.,"New York, NY",1152,1258,14

That's all I can really say about Daniel and my dining experience there.  So many reviews (including 4 stars from the New York Times) have already been written about the food at Daniel that I don't really have anything insightful to add.  However, I think I've finally come up with my list of top five dining experiences...ever.

I loved that the dessert list had its own chocolate section.  I chose a chestnut mousse with Bailey's ice cream - divine.  The waiters also brought me a plate of chocolate goodies for my birthday and a basket of freshly baked madelines.  I was stuffed and in heaven!Yes, it's pricey.  Yes, it's formal (jackets required).  But it was definitely worth every penny.",1,1,1,Tressa D.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,24,0

One thing Americans are good at (among many other things): unfettered luxury. Even the cocktails while you're waiting are world class.

3.0,12/5/2008,"Went to Daniel for dinner on Sat. The space is beautiful with out being too stuffy or oldschool. We got the 6 or 7 course tasting menu. She got one option and i got the other so that we could try the entire thing. Wine pairings as well, of course. I The amuse bouche was a dish of beets 3 ways. Not a big fan. Actually it was pretty gross. Bitter unseasoned beets. They were beautifully presented though.I got an almond crusted fois gras terrine which was smooth, and delicious. Perfect. She had the pate and fois gras which was also delicious. Paired with a nice Gewerstraminer that was very nice and not overly sweet.Next I had crab salad rolls with hearts of palm that were amazing. One of the best  dishes of the night. But they were tiny. I could have eaten like 50 of them. She got tuna tartar. The crab was definitely the winner. Paired with a French White wine that could be the best I've ever had.Next i got Kataifi crusted scallops which were delicious and she got squash ravioli. Delicious. The Scallops were perfectly cooked with a combination of crispy crunchy and delicate tenderness. The squash ravioli were tender light and AMAZING. The best I've ever had. Another beautiful Wine wine accompanied.Next we got I got Sole which was good, not great; and she got the sea bass. Interestingly both were prepared with very hearty sauces that would have been better on red meat and paired with a light red wine. I felt it was kind of eh. Tasty nonetheless. For the Meats I got the Duo of Aged Beef. Seared Ribeye was ok. Standard Jus reduction sauce on nicely cooked beef. Nothing to write home about, but short rib was ridiculous good. Not so much about the sauce. The sauce was standard Jus redux as well, but the meat itself was so tender and succulent. Delicious. She had Lamb Chop that had this breadcrumb crust on it. I kinda felt it was over cooked a bit, but the meat was still tender juicy and delicious. Can't remember the wine.Dessert was a big let down. I don't remember what I got cuz she hated hers and we changed. It was like a deconstructed  Key lime pie. Might be the most tart food i have ever had. It was actually painful to eat. After a few bites my eyes were watering. Not from joy, but from my tongue being blitzkrieg'd by sour. I am not a big fan of dessert wines so no comment.Over all the cold seafood dishes were my favorite (Maybe i should've gone to Le Bernardin instead) and the white wines were amazing. I felt like we didn't really have very good service either. I could barely understand the food server. He basically told us what is was, but i could have read that off the menu. Seems like we got the J.V. service team.I would think that everything would have been perfect, but i was only impressed with half of the meal. The other half was eh. Don't get me wrong, it was great, but for $700 I expect perfection. I feel like dinner was half perfect. I won't be going back unless I go for a company dinner or find myself a sugermamma.

4.0,12/1/2008,"What an amazing experience! I ate at Daniel last weekend, with a party of 6. It was my first time at the restaurant, but two people I was with are regulars/big Daniel Boloud fans. The restaurant definitely lived up to the reputation and hype. The entire experience was excellent. The service was great, led by Bernard. We started off with bottles of Rose Champagne for the table. The amuse bouche was three tastings of beets done different ways, and they were tasty (I love beets!). I had the seared fois gras to begin with, and it was excellent. I didn't enjoy the chutney that accopanied it, but the fois gras itself was done perfectly. The bread at Daniel is also amazing. I had the sourdough and french sourdough- yum. Next, I had the Chateaubriand (for 2), and it was also good. For desert, our table of 6 had 6 different deserts, essentially sampling all of the chocolate ones, and they brought out the apple desert as well as an extra as well as chocolate truffles. I loved the extra touch of bringing out the extra desserts. After the meal, Daniel made the rounds, and I thought that meeting him was great!

The bar array seemed more than capable of filling any of your more traditional cocktail requests, but it also had a creative list of mixed drinks which I always like to see. I tried two, the champagne mojito- fresh mint and a perfectly sliced lime made it an easy to drink first choice. I followed it with their white cosmopolitan after the bartenders recommendation. Served up with a beautiful flower in a ball of ice, I was immediately impressed with the presentation. The taste was no dissapointment either; it was easy to drink and still did it's job.I also tried my girlfriends champagne with lychee foam concoction which I applaud as well.And If the drinks weren't enough, they brought us tasting dishes on the house. All bite size samples, but beautifully displayed and if a bit odd, I still give points for inventiveness.I will definitely be coming back soon even though it means heading in the opposite direction from home after work!

DEFINITELY NOT.I will tell you what you get.  A rude server that will probably look down on you if you don't order that Oooh so important bottled water.  They just look down their noses at you.  Okay it's not like we are cheap, I just don't care for sparkling water!

5.0,9/22/2008,""" Comfort me with apples, for I am tired of love""a lot of us who write on these pages have reasons to be extremely grateful to Ruth Reichl, former restaurant critic of the greatest daily newspaper in the world. When she got the job in the early 90s she took on the poncey , fancy-schamnacey, pretentious restaurants and chefs and singlehandedly made them realize that their customer base was not necessarily the Richie Rich mob, but the normal mob, who will go on a splurge once or twice a year, and want the experience to be transcendent and celebratory, not pretentious or intimidating.This is exactly what Daniel delivers. My three favorite things:1. The night we were there the great man himself was in the entrance lobby, welcoming people and thanking them for coming. Lovely touch.2. I go to a place like this about once a year, and a buddy in the wine business had just told me that when you taste wine in a restaurant, the only thing you are looking for is if it si corked - and you can easily smell that - no need to taste. The wine comes, I smell it, it's fine. the server says, "" excuse me sir, do you mind if I ask if you work in the business""Oh yeah baby !! That's me, at one with the beautfiul people. Having said that, when I try that stunt 'back home' the server suggests that I should taste the wine.3. Oh yeah - the food. Marvellous. Magnificent.

I had wanted to dine here for a few years now, and basically everything I could ask for -- fine dining, great wine, nice cocktails, IMPECCABLE service, and sophisticated decor. The food is all clasically prepared and delicious, but I'm sorry to say that little of it was memorable. Oh, it was fine alright - but it was not one of those meals that you remembered. The only thing that really struck me were the freshly baked madeleines served at the very end of the meal. Honestly, some of the food was a bit too over-stylized, and ended up not being that tasty. My chocolate dessert was expertly sculpted, but didn't seem to melt in my mouth.  There was some moussey petit four that was actually a bit gross too.... Oh, I hate to say such words when I have such high respect for Mr. Boulud!Speaking of which - I did get to shake his hand when I left that evening, and I loved that he was there in spite of having just opened a new restaurant a few months ago. The ultimate point about Daniel will be the service and decor -- here your purse will never touch the ground (they will give it its own footstool), and you can have complete privacy in some of the tables set off to the side in its own tented area.

Everything was outstanding, just as what other reviewers are saying there were about 10 people that waited on us...hell, they even walked me to the bathroom, talk about service. The room itself was gorgeous and the people watching was outstanding. We were seated at the far left of the dining room and sat at a table that overlooked everything. We felt like we were on the set of ""American Psycho"" though, and eating the best food we've ever tried. The other diners were exactly what we think of when we categorize people as ""american psycho"" cast.

A random girl I just met a few weeks ago but am crashing at her parents house and an 18 years old Allison. Okay, she was not that random, she was in my unit, a fellow Marine. Why she ever enlisted with all the money her family has is beyond me but this review is about Daniel, not her.How it all started:""""Dudette my grandmother and her garden club friends invited me out to lunch and I am soo not doing this alone. You are coming with me"" Free food. I was down.I went shopping specifically for this restaurant. Thought I looked sharp in a pair of black pants and a nice button down shirt from no other but Forever 21. No Miuccia Prada for me, not yet. I had a seafood dish. I believe it was sea bass. It was quite tasty.The crowd was older. Looked very Bold and the Beautiful-ish. Was I in a soap opera? Nope, just lunch with the ladies from the Upper East Side.The waiter was adorable. A french boy that we were both crushing over through out the entire meal. We got his digits. We never called.Highlight of the entire afternoon was that I was able to drink. They  do not card.

3.0,2/25/2008,"Every year on his birthday, my friend chooses his favorite person and a great restarant to ring in the occasion.  For his 32nd year, I was the chosen one and the restaurant was Daniel.  We arrived for a 7:30 reservation, had a drink at the bar (which is lovely) and went to our table.As everyone has mentioned, the dining room is amazing.  That said, we were given a not-so-great table right by the doors to the kitchen (NOTE: If possible, ask for a table in the inner part of the dining room).  I was put off by this.The menu is a little overwhelming and in the end we opted for the 6-course tasting option.  Everything was good; only 2 dishes were great: the lobster and the beef (can't remember the cut).  The first course was a choice between foie gras done one way and foie gras done another way.  My friend does not like foie gras and when he asked for a substitute, his only option was salad (this is lame, no?).  Also note, that we had both the lamb and beef dishes and the beef was the definite winner.We ordered wines by the glass since it was only two of us and we weren't sure how much we'd drink.  The house white wine is great and cheap at something like $13 a glass.  We should have gotten a bottle because most of the dishes were fish and we didn't switch over to red until late in the meal.Desserts were okay.  Along with the main dessert they give petits fours and madelines.  The madelines were so delicious, warm, light and tasty, we asked for more (Why not?).In the end at $600 for two, I can't give Daniel more that 3 stars.  I would have liked it more if we had gotten a better table and if I had been wise enough to know that the three-course option with lobster and beef (don't know if that's actually possible) is all you need to eat and experience what is good at Daniel.  A note about wine: the waiter told us that every year Daniel goes to California to taste wines and decides what to serve at his establishment.  Don't be scared of the house wines.Next time (if there is a next time), I'll ask for a better table and go for the three-course menu instead of the six.",6,0,2,Diane A.,"Manhattan, NY",30,145,0

For those who have not yet had the immense pleasure of dining at Daniel may not appreciate them (as I would not have, before going there myself). Those who are lucky enough to have been can just travel back in their mind's eye and relive the glorious meal, rather than hear my recantation.

4.0,11/27/2007,"I came to Daniel with very high expectations, having read the book ""The Fourth Star"" (yes, I'm that much of a foodie nerd that I spend my non-eating time reading books about eating) in advance.For the most part, my expectations were met, if not exceeded.First off, the restaurant itself is gorgeous, and I would not be exaggerating if I said that it was the most beautiful dining room these eyes have laid upon.  The scene was right out of a five-star hotel - lush draperies, high ceilings, all of the furnishings first rate.My eatin' buddies and I went for the six-course fall tasting menu, for the low, low price of $165 per head (Dorothy, we're not in McDonald's anymore).  With a couple of exceptions, the meal was spectacular, and extremely ample.  Before the first course is served, a trio of excellent amuse bouches were served, along with a bread basket bursting with at least six or seven varieties of artisinal yeasty delights.  Needless to say, I was full before the appetizers came out.  I will not run through all of the courses, but they were great.  Given that this was a multi-course meal, I was quite frankly surprised at how large each of the courses were. And then, there was dessert.  Oh.  My.  God.  I had this chocolate mousse cake that was simply exceptional.  Despite being so full that I contemplated going straight to the emergency room to have my stomach pumped, I delved into the sweet, soft, lemony fresh-baked madelines served after dessert with reckless abandon.  But wait, there's more.  Following the madelines, a wonderful assortment of chocolates and petit fours were served.  And yes, despite having eaten my body weight already, I dug in.Oh, I forgot, a cheese course was involved as well.  Maybe the best cheeses I've ever eaten (and anyone who knows me knows that I consume a hell of a lot of it).The only reason I give Daniel 4 stars is (1) a couple of the dishes just didn't quite make the grade and (2) it is expensive beyond all notions of reasonableness.  That said, if you got a stack of benjamins burning a hole in your pocket, give Daniel a go.",3,2,2,Tom F.,"Chicago, IL",70,69,0

In other words, it was pretty much the same no better no worse. There are many excellent  ""5 star"" restaurants with detailed ""play by play"" reviews,  it is truly a matter of taste and what you find makes one more special than the other i.e. atmosphere, crowd, music. Here is what made Daniel stand out to me, more than other restaurants in its class:1. Unlimited Tea Refills: Not just hot water poured over tea leaves/bag, but a fresh pot poured into your cup every time you finish your last sip.No extra charge. **This is the only reason I gave it 5 stars (otherwise it gets 3) - great tasting fresh tea is a luxury to me. 2. Mind reading Ability of Staff Without Hovering: Whether its more tea, bread or anything else you desire, they are ready and waiting. 3. Best Meat Dish: Duo of Dry Aged Beef4. Desert whether you order it or not: Freshly baked basket full of  Madeleines lightly powdered with sugar plus Petit Fours..5. Friendly Hard Working Chef6.

I did love the wine even though I didn't get the tasting. I did not love the people sitting next to me.

The sommelier was very knowledgeable and professional and helped us choose a wine. He didn't seem the least bit annoyed after we changed our minds on the selection and opted to start with champagne instead. Just be mindful of the prices.

5.0,4/6/2007,"Simply a paragon of fine dining here in the city. There's no two ways about it. Our boss took the team here after an unusually rough project that had stretched for a few months - he made the mistake of allowing me to pick any restaurant in the city to go to for a celebratory dinner ;-)Everything is executed exceptionally. From the moment you step in, you are simply taken aback by the gorgeous, ornate decor (generally not my aesthetic, but works well here) and unbelievable service. As soon as you walk in, you are promptly seated in the waiting area as your drink orders are taken and almost immediately brought out to you with various breads, crackers and nuts to ready your palette for the masterpieces you are about to consume. As soon as your table in the main dining room is ready, you are escorted by what feels like your own personal team of waiters out to a table in a gorgeous dining room with spectacular chandeliers and high ceiling. Once seated, you are treated to a wide array of tasty amuse-bouches which you only stop munching on to admire your surroundings, the multi-volume encyclopedic wine list and tremendous menu.Once you've ordered, your food is brought out by a team of waiters in a flourish, only adding to the terrifically theatrical element of it all. Our table, which had been abuzz with conversation until now, basically quieted down to silence as everyone looked wide-eyed and mouth-wateringly at the food -- no one said a word as we all dug in, and was it ever worth it.Deserts are rich and decadent, preceded of course by a tray of small cookies, truffles and toffees. The whole experience was second to none -- and you would hope so for the price. Certainly on the more expensive side of things, but certainly worth it if you are shelling out for an occasion or important gathering. In my opinion, one of the hallmarks of a great restaurant is not just great food, or just great atmosphere or just great service, but how well each of these elements can be executed in sync (and not at the expense) of the others.

3.0,6/11/2006,"OK, heresy, perhaps, but Daniel is not all that. Michelin knows what they're doing and didn't give Daniel 3 stars. I'm giving them less. Note though, that this 3 stars is only relative to other top flight restaurants, not to the Yelp 3-star rated Thai down the street.Now, having said that, here's why I don't think Daniel is up to snuff: (1) brusque service -- just too rote. Dish descriptions were recited as if making a classroom presentation, (2) food uses just way too much flavor enhancer; yes, the dreaded msg or equivalent (yes, I know that the chef's trademark technique has a lot of intense reductions, and yes, certainly flavor comes from that, but you can't argue with the trademark apres-meal thirsty all night feeling after eating too much msg), (3) their wine pairing pours are way too meager for the price (4) surely they can redo their chair upholstery every now and then. This is my 2nd visit to Daniel, seated at the same table (not sure if that was by design or accident). It is a very handsome room, of course, very nicely decorated, but the one thing I took away from my 2nd visit was that the corners of all the chairs, where they're pulled out and pushed in for the guests, are all very visibly worn. In regards to service, it is certainly very dependent on who you get, more like, which team you get. On my first visit, we had a pretty engaging fellow. On this most present visit, we had a cold fish who seemed just to go through the required motions of his job. Certainly, one has to take different personalities into account, but a top rate place like Daniel shouldn't suffer from such wide differences in perceived service friendliness/professionalism.The food. It's certainly good, and presented very well, with some interesting flavors and combinations, but ... stale bread was offered, and there were more misses than hits (both times we had the tasting menu), with some dishes verging on the bland.Maybe this 2nd visit was an off day, but that's the thing.

It's that good. My lovely wife and I decided to try it after reading a review by Ruth Reichi, the incredibly knowledgeable and rigorous New York Times food critic. In a wonderful piece of deliberate understatement she calls it ""quite a ride"" and awards a very rare but coveted four stars. I can only agree. A cheap ride, though, it is not. We ordered the  five course tasting at $132, with wine flight  for an additional $65. With taxes and tip the total came to $600 for the two of us. There is also an eight-course ""Grand Tasting"" for $175 paired with a $85 wine flight. Had we ordered a bottle or two from the list I'm sure we could have easily spent $500-700 a person.  Service was, as other Yelper's note, absolutely wonderful. Expensive French restaurants often forget that their function is making guests happy.  I can't believe I'm the only one who fears that a badly pronounced order for Vichyssoise or  Soupe D'Haricot (bean soup)  will lead  to a deep if slightly smirking bow and an under-the-breath  ""Je vais vous apporter de l'eau de vaiselle sale. Vous ne verrez aucune difference"" (I will bring you dirty dish water, you will never know the difference). Have no fear of that at Daniel. The staff manages to be friendly without feeling phony, knowledgeable without a trace of condensation and always available without being obsequious.  The food and wine pairings were absolutely incomparable. Rather than try to describe them myself I urge you to read what other Yelpers say,  read Ruth Reichl's review (its contained in the book Garlic and Sapphires), or best of all, try it yourself.  My only regret is not having dressed better.  Daniel requires men wear a coat, and I did. However, it was with a California business casual set of Khakis and a polo shirt.. The restaurant is very carefully laid out to have no bad tables, but I couldn't help but feel that our table along the outer periphery was ever so slightly less equal than others. I also noticed we were next to another table of younger and less formally dressed people, so likely better clothes do mean a better table. However, I wished I'd dressed better mainly  because I want to show respect to the restaurant and the truly remarkable experience it provides.",7,1,1,Bill S.,"San Francisco, CA",365,173,53
5.0,3/26/2006,"This will likely always be on my Top 3 list of New York restaurants.  The last time here, I tried their vegetarian prix fixe menu.The service is unpretentious yet curiously effective--has to be experienced to be believed.  Wait staff magically appear from nowhere when you take your gaze off your companions or your food.The salad, the mushroom soup, the ravioli--all cooked to perfection.  And the hot chocolate souffle with pistachio ice cream--wish it were healthy and I could eat that every day, twice a day of course.If you are in the mood to splurge on a special occasion, there might not be a better place in the city.",15,7,11,Srini V.,"Manhattan, NY",467,463,97

5.0,12/14/2005,"Who knew butternut squash soup could be so good? At Daniel, the service. food, atmosphere and experience was unbelievable. The waitstaff was extremely attentative to our needs and although we felt like taking an etiquette class after dining there, we were extremely satisfied with the delicious food. We went with the 4-course tasting menu which was just right. Loved the Braised Short ribs , which was aged for 32 hours in delicious sauce.Make sure to make reservations 1 month in advance and call early! 7pm spots go fast! Great place to take someone special.",1,2,1,Steve M.,"New Hyde Park, NY",3,528,0
5.0,11/1/2005,"There are not enough superlatives to describe the food, atmosphere, or experience of dining at Daniel in NYC.As you step into the luxurious space, you are instantly welcomed by an incredible staff who understand what it means to be a Relais & Chateaux/Relais Gourmands restaurant. There is a lounge area above and adjacent to the bar where you can eat a full menu, comfortably seated in beautifully upholstered sofas and chairs - with perfect people watching positions.There were people to watch (yes I will get to the food) on this Friday evening - Justice Scalia (not a favorite) with 20 military men in tow in black tie and formal military garb including hundreds of service medals, accompanied by the Senator from Virginia, John Warner. Yanni was in the dining room. Unfortunately Diddy was not to be found in his favorite dining tent, nor in the Chef's table overlooking the kitchen.The FOOD: the gluttony was overwhelming, but all of the food delicate and wonderfully flavored. The presentation was spectacular and of course the service superlative. Among the delights we sampled:Tai Snapper Ceviche with Kumquat Coulis, Watercress, Tomato Compote and a Radish Salad, then Tuna Tartar with Fresh Wasabi and Oscetra Caviar Crisp Cucumber, Watermelon Radish and Meyer Lemon Coulis, then Scottish Pheasant Terrine with ChestnutsMedjool Dates, Poached Quince and Hazelnut-Mche Salad, a claybaked Salmon filet that was so wonderful to watch them serve, and Pan Roasted Scottish Grouse Stuffed with Foie Gras, Sweet Potato Pure, Glazed Salsify and a Huckleberry Jus, then an amazing cheese course served expertly by John Winterman (formerly of Gary Danko in SF), and we ended with a delicious Chocolate Caramel Millefeuille with Vanilla Confiture de Lait ""Fleur de Sel"" Caramel Ice Cream!Ignace Lecleir is the GM of Daniel and he is the best of the best! Formerly of Gary Danko in SF, Ignace is the ultimate professional, making guests feel comfortable, and fluent in several languages, as is most of the staff.This is THE place for a romantic dinner!",3,2,3,Mariangela S.,"San Francisco, CA",172,609,2
5.0,10/14/2005,"The best meal of my life.  The tasting menu was absolutely amazing, heightened only by the wine that so well matched every dish.  A life changing experience, really.  Every bite was a burst of flavor, and they serve just enough to tease you and leave you wanting more.  I can't say enough good things about this place.  Save money.  Then go.  It's worth it.",1,1,1,Annie y.,"New York, NY",3,36,0
3.0,6/30/2005,"Daniel Boulud's midtown namesake is over the top in all regards - the decoration includes gilded columns and Bernardaud china, the food is extremely rich and often lacked balance, the service is impeccable and flawless.  Of course, you have to pay for all this over-the-topness.  I wasn't overly impressed with the food, and this is not my scene (I enjoy more laid-back environments paired with fantastic food).  Definitely a dining experience.  I wouldn't go back with so many other great restaurants in the city.",0,0,0,Christina S.,"New York, NY",56,288,0
