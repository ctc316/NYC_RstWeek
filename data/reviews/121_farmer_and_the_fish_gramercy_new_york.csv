4.0,5/1/2019,"Good spot for happy hour with $1 oysters, $9 select wines, and half off beers. The restaurant itself is pretty large and wasn't busy on a Tuesday at 6:30PM. Happy hour goes until 7PM. Rather than just a bar area, they also have high top tables eligible for happy hour. There's no lack of seating and it's nicely separated from the main dining area. The oysters were great, not fishy and very fresh. They also came out very quickly and the restaurant even gave us an extra oyster! Would come back just for the quality oysters. The wine offerings were a bit limited but included a red, white, and rose option.I want to call out the service in particular. It was fantastic. We were seated immediately upon entering and the waitress made it a point to come over before happy hour was over to get our final orders.Will be back for happy hour!",0,0,0,Elizabeth L.,"New York, NY",19,99,237

4.0,4/13/2019,"My husband and I went here for a late happy hour and a very light dinner. Overall, I was really blown away with the savory, tasty food. We ordered a dozen oysters to share, and then he had the Hamachi appetizer and I enjoyed the Ceasar Kale salad. We didn't actually eat anything from the Entrée portion of the menu, so I can't speak on that. However, the oysters were remarkably fresh and my salad was really flavorful. We each ordered a drink (I had wine; he had beer) and the bill came out to about $80. A few thoughts on the price. For one, we thoroughly enjoyed what we ate and would definitely come back for the oysters (at the very least). On the other hand though, $80 for oysters (they were $1/piece) and two appetizers is pretty pricey. If we had come for a full meal, we would have spent over $100 easily. All in all, we agreed that we would return. However, we would probably only come during happy hour as the prices are a little steep for a full meal. But, that being said, what we ate was so incredibly flavorful. Your taste buds will be satisfied, even if your wallet doesn't leave feeling the same way.",0,0,0,Stephanie G.,"New York, NY",74,18,3
2.0,3/24/2019,"Maybe this is not the place for a Saturday lunch or brunch.  Service is indifferent at best.  I was contemplating the bagel tower but $100 is a bit much for what you get - asked if I can get the whitefish salad separately.  I was told no and this makes absolutely no sense to me.  We ended up getting the bagels anyway and they were dry and definitely not fresh.  I ordered a soy latte and it was lumpy and chunky.  I drank a few sips and sent it back, I was never offered to take if off the bill. Tuna crudo and the rosemary sage bisquits were the only redeeming items of our meal - both very good but not worth coming back for.",0,0,0,Antje N.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",0,5,0

3.0,3/15/2019,"Food: the concepts are great, execution is not great. For example the mushroom ragu with a poached egg isn't really a ""ragu"" it's sautéed mushrooms, the poached egg was overdone so no runny yolk which is the whole point. My tuna was well cooked and flavorful but the there wasn't enough of the sauce so it was pretty dry. The polenta fries were the best part of the entire meal. They are delicious I'd order them again if I ever went back (which I probably won't.) The wine glasses are not good. That may sound odd but they are those thicker glass cheap ones that don't fully express the wine. My dining partner ordered a medium steak that came out blue in the center, it seemed to have a lot of gristle so I'm guessing it wasn't trimmed well either.The service: was good at first but our server pretty much ignored us the whole night. It took so long to get our check one member of our party actually got up and walked over to the bar where she was chatting with two other employees to ask for it.With so many good restaurants in NY, I probably wouldn't go back.",0,0,0,P O.,"Financial District, San Francisco, CA",0,35,2

3.0,3/9/2019,"Let me start off by saying this place can be an easy 4.5 with a few MAJOR tweaks. On the way to Little Italy we saw this restaurant and decided to turn around and give it a try. Here is a tip to every restaurant owner and manager in the world. Your host/hostess sets the initial tone for the patrons. Having someone who shows zero interest in her job, can't smile and is just an overall mope isn't the person you want greeting people waking in. It doesn't cost anything to smile. We decided to sit at the hi-tops near the bar. We would have preferred the bar as the bartenders were very attentive and the service was top notch. I'm not sure if our waiter was super busy with other tables but our service was lacking. I went to the bar twice myself and also had the manager bring us a round of drinks. Had our waiter been more attentive we probably would have had 2-3 more drinks. The food was SPECTACULAR for the most part. The Smoked Trout Toast app is probably one of the best things I have ever eaten. I seriously contemplated ordering another one. So simple yet so perfect. Really delicious!! For entrees we ordered the Tuna Burger ($20) and Chopped Farmers Salad ($14) with Salmon** and a side order of Brussel Sprouts ($10). The Tuna Burger (which is server on a English Muffin) was melt in your mouth delicious. The Brussel Sprouts we great too but could probably be served with a little less parmigiana cheese. The Chopped Farmers Salad was nothing special. The dressing was flavorless and the salad was packed with tomatoes. Not a good balance with the other veggies. ** So my wife requested fish with her salad. The waiter told her to pick a protein so she chose Salmon. He charged us for the Salmon entree ($34) on top of Salad entree price. I don't think I've ever been to a restaurant that charges the full entree price for a protein when it's being added to a salad. If we would have known that then we would have ordered the 3rd entree to have the sides. Would have loved to give this place a 5 but between the hostess, poor service and over charging for the fish I'm going with a 3 (should be a 2 but the manager and bar staff pitching in got the extra start)  Food was a solid 4.5",0,0,0,David G.,"Long Branch, NJ",0,11,0

We accidentally left something we purchased from a store on the floor and the restaurant had it for us the next day. So nice!! Thank you!!Food: delicious.

The decor of the restaurant was very nice, dimmed light setting and there was a bookshelf in the back. The noise level was quiet at first but then it escalated as more customers were seated. It was restaurant week so the menu selection was fixed. It was a three course dinner. My appetizer was the Farm Wedge. The presentation was nice. It was a wedge of iceberg lettuce with beets, crispy fried onions, Gorgonzola and peppercorn dressing. I think the dressing was delicious. My entree was the Monkfish Milanese. The fish was tender and fried on the outside. There was a baby arugula salad. The meal ended with a bread pudding and a vanilla bean ice cream.

1.0,1/28/2019,"Pretty terrible. We went for restaurant week brunch, which is a terrible deal. It costs less to split a couple starters and get your own entree. But what really made our experience memorably terrible was the service. We had a reservation at 1 and arrived promptly. Our server took our orders a few minutes later. We waited... and waited and waited and waited for our food to come. We checked in with our server after a half hour or so and all he could muster was a ""Yea, sorry it's taking so long. That's weird."" A few minutes later he brought us some mediocre mini muffins to hold us over. We finally got our appetizers after 50 minutes or so. The cauliflower was terrible- deep fried, yet undercooked and under seasoned chunks of cauliflower in an unimpressive yogurt sauce. The sweet potato hash brown was delicious, I'll give them that, but I probably could make something similar for myself at home. Then it took another 20 minutes for us to receive our main dishes, which were again, mediocre. Three of us got a vegetarian benedict, and the fourth got avocado toast. We literally ordered eggs and vegetables, so it was a mystery to us all how our orders could have taken so long.I will give them credit for comping our meal without being asked because they realized the long wait was unacceptable.There are so many fantastic restaurants in this neighborhood.

3.0,1/25/2019,"Came here for Lunch - Winter 2019 Restaurant Week.  It should be 4* though with the menu pricing confusion and no way to fix this it became a 3*.Somewhere there is a miscommunication between the restaurant and nycgo website of the restaurant's menu prices.  NYCGo lists the prices at lunch - 3 meals for $26 and dinner - 3 meals at $42.  The restaurant lists the prices at lunch - 2 meals for $26 (+8 for dessert) and dinner - 3 meals at $42.  Yes, I should have confirmed but made the reservation online and forgot to check.  The restaurant really should contact NYCGo to correct the confusion since patrons use the site to view the menu.  It happened last year and now this year, I truly learned my lesson.Other than issue, our experience was overall very pleasant.  Our server was pleasant and very helpful in making sure that the meal was suitable for my companion, who had some food intolerance.  We received a complimentary dish of cucumbers and tahini yogurt dip.  Very refreshing and different from the bread basket.  Thank you for the light option.Meal:Butternut squash: It was a huge soup bowl.  It was very tasty.Salmon: I asked for medium.  It was good.  It's the first time I seen a whole kale stalk.  Funny thing is my companion was saying it was hard to eat.  I said it can be a bit chewy though good for me.  It was difficult to eat since had to cut the stalk into smaller pieces (more work, allows for digestion).Monkfish: it's fried with salad.Overall an enjoyable experience but will skip restaurant week next time.",1,0,0,Caroline N.,"Queens, NY",47,312,2708

That was not the case tonight. My friend and I ordered the lobster Caesar salads and they just weren't very good. Some of the lettuce was wilted and The lobster didn't seem super fresh. For dessert I tried the pumpkin creme brûlée and we also ordered the key lime pie. Just nothing great here. We took two bites and left it.

3.0,11/25/2018,"I had dinner with my mom here last night for her birthday. Unlike most of the lukewarm to negative reviews, I found the food to be very good! Specifically, all of the sides. They were seasoned so well with a lot of complexity. It looks like the staff took into consideration the older reviews complaining of over-salting. The interior was really cute as well. My main issue is with the service, as others have also mentioned. While there was nothing truly wrong with it, I found it fell short when compared to the food. The Blue Point oysters and octopus we ordered as starters were delicious. They also came out in a timely manner. The halibut and brazino entrees were both good too. My mom really enjoyed her branzino, and I found the halibut to be decent. I wish the sauce had been more accessible as it's quite thick and a thin smear on my plate made it nearly impossible to actually get on my food. The lentils it came with were great, though! The Brussels sprouts were good, but nothing to write home about. I absolutely loved the polenta fries, pesto mushroom ragu, and butternut squash. All had such a range of flavors, and a complexity that showed there was real thought put into the dishes.I wish the same thought that was put into the sides had been put into our service. It was very disappointing that my mom's birthday wasn't acknowledged. I noted it in the reservation, and I also mentioned it to our server when she took a photo of us. While I understand that I'm not entitled to something complimentary, it would have been nice if the host had at least said ""happy birthday"" to my mom when we arrived or left. I CLEARLY noted it in my online reservation. I was also told by my server that the Yelp $1 oyster wasn't a thing when I first mentioned it. I guess she went to check with her manager and they honored it after I was initially denied. We also had a fair amount of leftovers that I asked to be boxed. What a mess. The pesto mushroom ragu, Brussels sprouts, and half of my halibut were all put in one box. There was plenty of pesto left that somehow didn't make it into the box of everything, and of course I got none of the sauce from my halibut. I'm sure the polenta fries would have been shoved into the same box had our busser been able to take all of the plates at once.  I really can't believe half of my entree was just mixed in with the sides (the sides in one box is more forgivable). Truly a disappointment as there was a lot of delicious food left.All in all, I'd come back for the great oysters and tasty sides, but not for a special or large dinner. Instead, I'd highly recommend a tapas style meal with one or two other people as the appetizers and sides were really delicious and reasonably priced. Oh, and if you're getting leftovers boxed, make sure to provide very clear instructions on how you want it done.",0,0,0,Irene L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",166,122,81

The woman seating us was friendly and promptly seated us towards the back.It was 19 degrees outside and did not want near the window. We  shared an order of fried calamari for first course. The calamari was chewy and the sauce something green probably avocado was a very small portion. I ordered the $32.00 Turkey dinner my friend the $25.00 Linguine with clams (5) in the shell. The clams had grit in the shell though they were fresh. The pasta was under cooked and tasted like no linguine I ever tasted. It was not good. My turkey was dark meat as requested but terribly chewy and gristly. Don't know which part of the bird it came from but it was not the leg or thigh. Had the usual sides of whipped potatoes and whipped yams along with grilled brussel sprouts. After dinner the waiter brought the desert menu and placed it on top of our very dirty table.when the key lime tart arrived he places it on our uncleaned table.

For mains we had the north Atlantic cod and fish and fish and chips. The cod was a small portion of fish for a main but tasted delicious. The fish and chips was hake which was flavorfully battered and paired with an excellent take on tartar sauce and a slaw. The chips were actually more like grilled wedges and very underwhelming, undercooked not salted. Service was great, our waiter was attentive and food came out in good time.

I ordered their hush puppies for app and crab Egg Benedict for entree. The hush puppies were dry and overly salty. The Benedict was drenched in a cheesy sour sauce that ruined the whole dish.

Things tried: She-Crab Soup - Amazing!Tuna Tartare - Quite good.Avery's Fried Chicken - Huge portion, deliciously light but crispy, flavorful crust (some may think is a little too salty).Soft Shell Crab - Very good but I'd try something else next time because there are so many great items on the menu.Lollipop Kale - So good!

Now for the ugly...As my wife and I were finishing our lobster rolls, we both were astounded at how salty they were. Now for those not in the know, besides the bread a lobster roll is essentially four bites of lobster. Neither my wife or I ate the bread because carbs. So did we realize at the third or fourth bite? I can't tell you for sure, but when we dove into the salad, it was blatant. The food was all oversalted. Not like ""oh that's a little salty,"" but more like ""the cook spilt open the salt container over the food."" For about the second time in my almost 40 years I complained to the waiter, who told the manager. Nothing more was said until the check came and it was full price. I spoke to the manager and her position was that since we ate the lobster roll there was nothing she could do. She ultimately comped our two drinks and we gladly left, never to return again.So here's how I break it down. I was too nice to complain, so I was punished as a result. Had I complained right away, we would have waited hungrily for more food and the restaurant would have thrown out our food and ate the cost. However, since I had that extra bite or two, they would not eat the cost of the food, thereby saying  they didn't believe me that the food was one of the worst meals of my life.  So I've made my return to Yelp to ward you off: (1) the food is terrible and (2) customer service is dead.",4,1,0,Dustin K.,"Queens, NY",28,254,4

They had a habit of chatting in a corner at the bar throughout the night instead of paying attention to the tables.Food came out very late. Our starters came around 30 minutes after we ordered, and main courses came another 35 minutes later, mostly because the kitchen was slow. The night peaked at only 1/2 of the tables being seated, so still not that busy.

Today we wanted to come back as we were excited about the Monday mussels specials . Few things that was disappointing was the waiters didn't seem like they wanted to serve us . We had to wait till we can catch the waiters attention to ask for a refill on mussels , and waiter actually asked us if we wanted dessert after our first pot which probably only had ten mussels , the broth was low also . After the second pot which only had about ten mussels again we asked for a refill as this is unlimited mussels and waiter looked surprised we wanted more . To really top off this experience was there was a mouse roaming around our table and it was just very disturbing because a couple that was sitting across us from the other side was looking at us and pointing if we saw it too , we did both see it . We then told the waiter about it and he didn't really say much about it . He only said he would tell his manager and he came back with our checks . No ""manager "" around to address this issue , as we were signing our check we then saw the mouse again and this time the guys from another table said they saw it too . By now I just got up and left . It was too stressful to be there anymore . They are lucky they are even getting a decent tip for their lousy service and filthy restaurant with unwanted visitors .

5.0,5/13/2018,"Fancy Farm to table restaurant!.The back story for this restaurant is really what drove me here. They own Purdys farm in upstate New York in north Salem and locally source as many ingredients as possible. This is something I love to see but most of these farm to table restaurants try and bring that country style to the city. This restaurant bucks that trend by making its look like your nice restaurant. They stick with a fish theme and have old bay and sea salt right on the table..I got a reservation here for dinner on a Friday night and the hostesses here were really nice. While I was waiting for my date they gave me a window table and let me order drinks! I don't know why more restaurants don't do this but it was really nice and this great service continued through out the meal with the waiter Brandon checking in shortly after each course was served to see how it was or if we needed anything..They have a number of unique cocktails, craft beers on draft, and wine list. I got the ballast point sculpin beer and she got the rose 250ml..Appetizers they put shaved veggies with a dipping pesto cream sauce which was a nice start. We also ordered the Brussels sprouts which was shaved with Parmesan and was good. The cauliflower appetizer was really good it was fried with a yogurt sauce and is something a veggie person has to get.Main course I got the fish and chips and she got the tube burger both come with old bay spiced fries. The fish was fried perfectly and it had the perfect ratio of fish in it. Dipping that in the tartar sauce and throwing some old bay on there was a pure crunchy goodness. The fries were also not your typical fires they were long steak fries and very crunchy just the way I like it! The tuna burger was a solid piece of tuna good not a those breaded or ground tuna burgers some restaurants give you. It was very good with the wasabi sauce flavor..

It was after brunch so there was only a limited menu available, which was fine. I ordered some buffalo shrimp to start - this (and the flower power IPA) was the best part of the meal. Unfortunately we then had to wait an hour for our mains. The waiter also bought us someone else's food. When it finally arrived it was a little underwhelming. The lobster roll was more like a lobster sandwich with stale bread - the way it was put together (or not really put together) also meant I had to eat it with a knife a fork - that was a first. My wife had the tuna burger which I think was fine. Both cane with like 5 potato wedges (""fries""). Then once we had finished the server kept chasing on the check.

The hostess wanted to seat us at  a table near a family with a baby using a screen when there were plenty of other tables available. We actually had to wait while they cleaned this particular table when they could have given us a table in another area that was all set and ready to go. We got significant attitude when we asked for a different table. Not cool.2. There was a diner with a pet inside the restaurant. In no way was the dog a certified and trained service animal.  If the restaurant ignores the health department regulation that prohibits all but certified service animals from being inside restaurants, what other health code regulations are they ignoring?  I am not sticking around to find out, but the fact that there was a hair in a piece of my vegetable gives me an idea that the health code is regarded as barely a suggestion, let alone a requirement.3. It's very expensive, even for the increasingly expensive Gramercy/Union Square neighborhood.  So see #2 above, and consider whether you want to pay for hair, human, dog or other, in your food.

At no time did anyone come over to our table and at 5:30 I decided it was time to get up.  OH, and did i mention that we were the ONLY table in the place!  We got up and left our table and not one person came to ask what was wrong!  As for your dining experience in the dining room I would give it ZERO stars!!I really wanted to try the restaurant, so we headed back to Charlie and another bartender who was just as great, Sammy, at the bar where we were served  a delicious meal  We started with Oysters that were delicious with dipping sauce to match.  I had the beet salad that was the freshest I have had!  My husband had  Smoked Mussel Toast - delish!  Our entrees were Fish Schnitzel and Fresh Cavatelli;  both were a little blander than I normally eat but were quite delicious and fresh.  Dessert...

1.0,1/11/2018,"This is not a place I would recommend for dinner.  I came here last night with my husband for my birthday.  We checked in with the hostess who was polite but never offered to hang up my coat which is a long and heavy.  She walked us to our table, and the waiter came over to greet us. I asked if there was a coat check, and he said ""yes"" and the hostess would take care of it.  So I now had to walk to the front again carrying my coat.  I asked if she'd hang it up.  ""Oh yeah"" she said - (Duh!  Is this an unusual request in January? I guess it must be since she never thought to offer)We sat down to our bare table - no tablecloths in this joint - must be a joint as it looks like a diner with a pretty chandelier.  Ugh!  We ordered drinks and I asked for two extra napkins, so I could make  placemats so we wouldn't have to put our cutlery on a bare table wiped down with an overused rag.  It took two requests of two people to get the napkins.  Our waiter was friendly and polite and I told him I was celebrating my birthday and he wished me a happy birthday and answered menu question. The drinks and bottled water arrived. There was a bread plate, but no bread, so I figured it was for something else. Our appetizers arrived - trout on toast for hubs,(he says the slaw on the trout tasted fishy like it was made hours before, not assembled when ordered)  and grilled octopus for me, which was very good.  I had barely put the fork down from my final bite when the main courses came, and now felt like we were being rushed.  We really wanted a few minutes between courses - I'd like to say to chat with one another, but the NOISE!!! OMG!  This place is beyond bustling.  It's a freakin' zoo.  YOU HAVE TO SCREAM SO YOUR TABLEMATE CAN HEAR YOU!  Hubs and I were 18"" apart and couldn't talk to one another without needing to repeat every sentence. (neither one of us is hard of hearing).  At one point, hubs actually texted me after I said ""WHAT DID YOU SAY?"" for the 5th time.  We started our main courses - he had the tuna on fried rice with coconut curry sauce and I had halibut on mushroom risotto. Mine was very good.  His tuna was cooked right and the rice was delicious, however, the sauce was barely there - it was more of a painted swirl.   So the tuna was bland, bland, bland and in desperate need of that imaginary sauce. (Note:  Once we finished and the plates were being taken away, I noticed that the man at the next table had the tuna and there was plenty of sauce on his plate)  As our waiter came with the dessert menu, I politely asked him why there were bread plates when the restaurant doesn't serve bread. He said, ""We serve bread. Did I not offer you any?""  When I said ""No"", he said, ""Oh would you like some now?""  Seriously???  (Did he mean before, during or after dessert?) I kind of thought that with his faux pas, and being that it was my birthday celebration, he might have offered one dessert on the house.  But that never happened. The noise was so deafening, and the service so unprofessional, we decided to go someplace else for dessert and after dinner drinks, so we  asked for the check.  In the check folio is a little promo card which asks for your email if you'd like to be on their mailing list, and to put down your birthday, so if you come in for your birthday you'll get a free dessert or cocktail!!!   Are you kidding?  Was the waiter not aware of this?  It confirmed to us that leaving was the best decision as this place really doesn't care.  At the front desk I gave the hostess my coat ticket (and a tip) and when she came back, never noticed that she was sweeping the floor with my scarf which was now dirty and wet when I got it. (at the cleaners now). As we walked out, I looked at the bar and noticed a few people dining there.  Under their plates were place mats!  HUH???  So if you eat at the bar you get a placemat, but if you dine at a table, you get a bare table? Does this make sense to anyone?                                                                                                      To be honest, if this was a cheap joint, I could look past a lot of things, but when drinks are priced from $14 - $25, appetizers from about $15 - $20, and mains start at $30 (unless you consider chicken at $27 or a burger), then I expect a table cloth, and more professional service.  You don't get to charge 5 star prices, have 1 star décor and 2 star service and the noise level of a chicken wing & beer sports bar during a football game.That said,I would not come back for dinner. However, I live in the neighborhood and might try it out for after work drinks.  And should I decide I want a snack, I know I'll get a placemat at the bar!",0,0,0,CJ C.,"New York, NY",2,6,0

(Thank goodness we didn't have to do vote with a show of hands on a NYC sidewalk, again.)Upon entering Farmer & The Fish, I quickly noticed there were other large groups already seated.  The decor is that of a farmhouse kitchen, bright and airy.  The bookcases added a nice touch, although someone from our party wanted to take a book to ""the library"" downstairs, just kidding.  I personally liked the marble table tops.  You can see pictures of the decor to see how nice the restaurant is laid out.Peter introduced us to Jess our waitress for the evening. Talk about anticipating our needs, Jess was able to accommodate and service our many specific orders in a very timely manner.  Jess has a very pleasant demeanor and a command for attentiveness.  When one of the cocktails seemed a bit off on its taste, she apologized, went to the bartender to discuss and quickly returned with another cocktail. As for my Manhattan cocktail, it was spot on.  I recommend asking for Jess when you visit.We took advantage of the Happy Hour oyster special.  We ordered a few dozen. they were served chilled, cleaned and stillon the shell.  The salad portions were huge, you can ordered it as an entree. Some of the entrees we ordered were the Halibut with Rosotto, the Bronzino Special (Jess expertly deboned the fish, great presentation.), a Fried Chicken platter and the Veal London Broil in a mushroom gravy.  All entrees were ample portions and tasted delicious.Desserts included chocolate cake and rhubarb cheese cake. I ordered another dozen of oysters, so good, I couldn't resist. We plan to return in a few weeks, hopefully during Happy Hour.

Seafood boil dinner included a small lobster, clams, mussels, potatoes and corn on the cob. Clams were chewy with lots of broken shell. Mussels and lobster were tasty and prepared well. Tuna burger was a generous portion of tuna, very moist and flavorful, however it was served on cheap English muffin. Thai fish tacos were a generous portion of fish (not sure what kind) in a Thai sauce that was a bit overpowering. I could let taste the fish.

1.0,9/11/2017,"Tonight was a lovely summer evening. My girlfriends and I, only weeks after graduating from an upstate Ivy League university (that houses the top hospitality management program in the world) were looking forward to reuniting and having a splendid, gastronomically pleasurable experience. However, this expectation was far from what we actually received. I, arriving slightly late to the dinner, ended up sitting at a seat that had absolutely no view other than the spots that hadn't been cleaned off from the previous diner's mess. Nonetheless, I didn't let this minor aesthetic displeasure disrupt my meal, and I looked forward to the culinary delights to come. Yet, from minutes 28 and 29, the group and I could already tell it would be a rather troublesome experience. It took our waitress, an unpleasant and combative female, approximately twenty minutes to get us our menus. At that point, we were already dying of starvation, and the damage was already done.... or so we thought. She then came back and took our drink and menu orders, and there was yet another point of conflict, confusion and plain insult. I, having gluten intolerances for many years, have become expertly skilled at how to deal with kindly asking for modifications to accommodate my diet. Yet, our sassy waitress rudely declined nearly every item on the menu and was completely unaware of what each dish consisted of, how it was prepared, and didn't even know what simple dressing came with my friend's side salad! Not good. In addition to our waitress being a nasty airhead, the food wasn't Michelin-sticker material either. In fact, I don't even think it was zagat-rated. My beets came out raw and mushy (weird combo, trust me), and my salmon was mostly ash with a weird pickle combo that definitely was not taught to me in my food and wine pairing class. Cooked fish + undercooked pickled vegetables = BAD IDEA. After our severely unpleasant entrees, our charming waitress came back to our table to kindly offer us dessert. In actuality, she wasn't thinking of pleasuring our sweet teeth at all, she was just trying to push on the most expensive desserts she could possibly think of-except it was a mild failure on her end because she didn't remember what the most expensive dessert was and had to look at the menu again before suggesting what her ""favorite"" dessert was. After waiting for two hours for her absurdity, we finally received the check, which we had already anticipated she would be unable to evenly divide. So, she gingerly strode over to our table to drop us a $222 check for the awful service and terrible food, only to inform us that only ONE credit card could pay for the entire meal. So, here I am, the gluten cripple, indebted to this feisty waitress that 100% spit in our food, having to charge $275 on my card.

The entree was a nice tasting swordfish which was fine but nothing special, although I did really enjoy the grilled squash.

5.0,8/17/2017,"Excellent summer night dinner at the Farmer and The Fish. My gal pals and I decided to try this place based on the menu and Restaurant Week offerings available. It did not disappoint.From the hostess seating us (I made a resy in case) to the double wait staff working with us, all were friendly and very quick with service. Appreciated that given we were trying to beat the dinner rush. We entered a few minutes before our 6pm reservation.My two gal pals had to order the Lobster bake special for a Wednesday night visit (in case it's day specific). It was a bargain at less than $30/ea. Came with a 1.25-1.5 steamed lobster with melted butter on the side. Also corn on the cob (whole one), boiled red potatoes, clams, and mussels. The seafood was seasoned with like an old bay seasoning, reddish and powdery. Delicious. Lobsters were perfectly cooked, cracked shell to get you started. Very easy to eat. Bib and bowl provided to complete the experience.I ordered off the Summer Restaurant Week Menu and the choices were great. I chose the Hamachi Crudo (light and cool, perfect for the summer) as my Appetizer. Drizzled with olive oil and sea salt, topped with sesame seeds ... Hint of avocado, made this dish so Pretty to look at. Tasted better still.For my entree, I chose the Big Eye Tuna. It was supposed to come with a shrimp and veggie fried rice and a coconut curry base. But, given my shrimp allergy, I asked the restaurant to substitute the rice with a house salad. They ended up making a gorgeous goat cheese and radiccio salad. It was excellent. My tuna was medium rare. Spot on.For the dessert, I had four choices to choose from: key lime bar with coconut shavings and raspberry sorbet (which I picked), Cheesecake, sorbet of the day, or a white bread pudding. The key lime was just tart but sweet. Very good.Cocktail menu had wine, sparkling or regular, usual bar drinks, and Mojito's. I chose a strawberry prosecco and splash of vodka. Perfect summer meal. I was super stuffed and could barely finish dessert.Gasp! I can't believe I forgot to check in on Yelp while I was snapping away with my cell. Missed out on my cash back and $1 oyster offer. Arrgh.

I called in advance to check on the corkage fee ($25) and brought a nice bottle to enjoy with friends. We would have enjoyed it more if the cork hadn't been broken and ended up IN the wine. Also kind of a bummer for entrees to come first and THEN wine glasses and the bottle to appear. The food went from good to disappointing to inedible throughout our three courses. The gazpacho starter was the highlight but was missing a crispy slice of bread or something to bring texture in the dish, the swordfish was massively overcooked to the point of rubberiness and the tomato slice it was served on was mealy and bland. Dessert took over 30 minutes to arrive. When we flagged the server to inquire she apologized and told us it would be right out. A few minutes later the GM came over and told us dessert was on its way. When I let him know it had been over 30 minutes he snapped at me ""Okay well do you want me to go get it right this second?"" Whoa dude. Personally, an introduction, apology, and possible round of bubbles for the table would have been the route I went in that situation. Whole thing was only made worse by the fact that all of the desserts were poor tasting and nowhere near worth the wait. In the end, he waived two cocktails as well as the corkage but he made the whole table uncomfortable when we could have been such an nicer experience.

The oysters are really fresh and the guy shucking behind the bar is a wizard of efficiency. I can recommend the polenta fries, beet salad and green salad. Can't go wrong with any of the fish entrees. Presentation is beautiful and the waitstaff I've had has been uniformly friendly and helpful. I hear weekend brunch is a great deal and very popular, so I hope to try it soon.",0,0,0,Stephanie B.,"New York, NY",7,50,53

3.0,6/22/2017,"Food = 4 starsService = 1.5 starsI've been here 4-5 times at least since they opened.  The food has been very good, high-quality, and consistent.  The portions are decent, and they're well-prepared.  We've had different dishes every time (no desserts).  I do often feel they're under-salted, but we have not had a dish that disappointed us.  After you place your order, they'll bring you a small loaf of carrot pound cake, and it's delicious.  May not be what ppl expect bcoz I'd love to have it for breakfast, but it's really good. So whoever is running the kitchen, please keep that person bcoz what comes out of the kitchen is GOOD and in good timing.What is BAD, especially the last 2 times, is the SERVICE.  The last 2 times we came here on a Wednesday when it wasn't even half filled when seated.  So it starts out smooth enough.  But half way through, the service just vanishes.  One time, the waiter was gone for a while and finally came back to pour the 250ml carafe into our 2 glasses.  He was in such a hurry that he didn't completely empty the carafe before he hurriedly walked away! (I HATE when ppl waste good drinks, especially when it's mine)And most recently, on another Wednesday, our waiter poured wine in our glasses and put our bottle of white wine in a bucket far from our table, which was fine.  But he never came back to refill our glasses.  We were trying to flag someone literally for 10 minutes.  You say only 10 min, but who would like to have your wine glass completely empty during your meal??  I should have gotten up myself to grab our bottle.  We also had to flap our arms in order to get more water.  The service sucks is an understatement.Décor = 3 starsModern, bright, and fresh interior is nice.  I find those huge chandeliers gaudy.  But they don't bother me that much. Comfort for Conversations = 1.5 starsIt is SO LOUD in there.  Like some restaurants, they may be trying hard to create some ""bar scene"" by their small bar side.  They turn up the music loud in the space where they are surrounded by hard surfaces that bounce the noise everywhere.  They have some noise reduction ceiling tiles, but only along the opposite wall.  It's just not really a comfortable level to have conversations.  Tables are rather large, which is usually a good thing.  But in here, you'd have to lean in for that extra distance you have with your company.Clearly, their kitchen is well-managed and produces delicious food, but sadly their terrible service and loud music leave you with somewhat of a bad taste in your mouth.",3,0,0,Harue J.,"Manhattan, NY",14,272,32

The kicker - we were then told that they were out of lobster and steak. Those were the only other choices that my mother would have eaten besides the seafood pie that was not there. So you can imagine the disappointment for her now having nothing to choose from. There were no specials and now we only had five menu choices, 4 fish (not shellfish) and 1 chicken option. We had to just leave. The manager came over and was apologetic and nice and tried to give suggestions and a comped appetizer, which we refused. He was very nice about it.

3.0,4/6/2017,"The conceit behind the name and concept of this restaurant is that the vegetables come from one owner--a farmer--and the seafood from another owner--a seafood distributor (not a fisherman). No middleman. You expect that everything is as fresh as possible. Based on several visits, I can attest to the fact that in terms of ingredients, the restaurant meets expectations. They probably serve the best selection of oysters in the city. But, The Farmer & Fish has some serious problems. It feels like a ship without a captain. Each time I've gone, a different person greets you at the entry podium. There is no constant presence, something you expect and find at most long-lived, successful restaurants. It is very noisy, despite sound absorbing panels on some walls. Two large air ducts and lack of table linens contribute to the din. Service is inconsistent. On our last visit one of the toilets was out of toilet paper and there were no paper towels. Tables are crammed close together. But most importantly, the food dishes are ordinary--even if the ingredients are top-notch. You can get good food in lots of places where the recipes are creative and you can talk without shouting.

Both my boss and my coworker got the big eye tuna.  I think the first thing we all noticed when our food arrived was how small my meal was and how large theirs were.  I got about three square inches of salmon on top of maybe six tiny, oddly textured parsnips and a few clementine segments.  The salmon tasted ok but the texture of the parsnips was weird and they didn't taste that good.The salmon came over cooked (I ordered it medium ).  This is speculation but It seemed like in trying to achieve pretty grill marks, my salmon was over cooked. I think for the amount they're charging for that entree, either the portion of the fish or the vegetables should be larger.  Or, it would be a good lunch portion at a lower price point.  Both my boss and coworker enjoyed their meals, so I think it was probably just my dish.",2,3,0,Janet M.,"Highland Park, NJ",120,58,58
3.0,3/31/2017,"A group of 8 of us came for a dinner mid-week. The table was open when we arrived (my husband and I showed up early because I work just 2 blocks away) and they were kind enough to settle us into the table because the bar was full so he and I could have a drink while we waited for the rest of the party to show up.The waitress was nice, but... it was just a little scattered maybe? She didnt have a price list for all their whiskeys, so she had to run to the bar and gather prices on a few of them and run back to my guy to let him know. She then took his drink order and started walking away so I started to just order mine to her back (she turned around very quickly to take my order.. but it was still an odd thing). The table and decor was very spacious. We were lucky they placed us at a round table and even with 8, we didn't feel crowded at all. We started with some rose wine and oysters - half blue points and half kumamotos (because Im half Japanese and from California!). They disappeared quickly - everyone agreed they were all delicious. The waitress came over to take drink orders, which was really nice, but she interrupted a conversation a few of us were having and just kind of... talked over us? I know she had good intentions but it just felt really rude.We then ordered our meal: most people started with a tuna tartare or salad: I asked for the beets and my mother-in-law went for the special butternut squash. I do have to say: the dishes all arrived beautifully presented. And honestly: they looked better than they tasted (not because they were awful tasting, but the plating was really that pretty). I took a bite of my guy's tartare/kale Caesar. and it was a bit salty but delicious. The cubes of fish were slightly bigger than the croutons, and the kale was shredded delicately so everything was a nice neat bite. I do think its deceiving to call it a tartare ""with salad""... because it honestly was a salad with a few chunks of raw tuna. My beets were also presented beautifully: they were prepared two different ways: one was just a basic boil and peel, and the other was almost a semi-dried chip-style. The flimsy chip things fell flat to me (the lacked any seasoning and didnt even have much beet flavor, like the other preparation did. There was a smear or marscapone under them and some microgreens/herbs, which helped brighten the dish. A little squeeze of lemon would have really elevated this.Our main courses started to arrive, and then after 4 plates went down, the staff responded with confusion when some of the plates weren't our orders. Turns out, they brought us another table's meal. Luckily, we hadn't jumped in and licked the fish or anything yet. After a few more minutes, our main courses came and it was a smattering of lobster rolls, sea bass, fish tacos (which were half shrimp?), and the chicken. I went with a two-small-plates style order so my second plate was the octopus. It was again presented beautifully and had great char on certain bits but it seems inconsistently cooked. I have a feeling they cooked the entire thing and then sliced it, because the thin parts were charred/burnt, the middle section was perfectly tender, and the thicker pieces were chewy and rubbery. The flavor was wonderful, but I felt it may have benefited from being sliced into pieces and pulled off as each thickness cooked, making a bit more of a uniform doneness.We reviewed the desserts but opted out - they service was really attentive in clearing our plates and ensuring the table was clean and we were happy. Overall, everything was fine but nothing was stellar.",4,2,1,Heather H.,"Jersey City, NJ",440,341,1

2.0,3/23/2017,"This was the single worst dining experience I've had in New York. And I was born here.We arrived right on time for a reservation for two at 7:30pm. We were informed by the curt and unenthusiastic host it would be ""at least 15-30 minutes."" We asked to sit at the bar and wait. They didn't suggest it, we had to ask which I find strange as most restaurants focus on the best customer service practice of offering that as an option. Drinks sounded inventive but overpriced for watery libations reminiscent of a bridge & tunnel Murray Hill bar.Fifteen minutes later a twosome showed up and was seated immediately. I'm not the type of person to let this behavior pass and I approached the hostess to ask why this came to be. She informed us they just split up a four top table to accommodate them and would seat us there right away. I know that had I not approached her, she would've left us to rot at the bar for another 30 minutes. Things seemed to be going right once we got to our table (a tight squeeze to sit, as we were wedged in between two other two-tops), and our waiter Peter was attentive, energetic, authentic and absolutely solid. Liked him a lot! Our oysters came out in a flash. We went for Wellfleets and Kumamoto's (always delivering deliciousness) and he suggested the Belle Soleils which we hadn't had before that. They were pretty good but I'll take a Shogoku or Wellfleet any day over it. That was the highlight of the meal. Things went south quickly from there. We had to ask for our entrees' whereabouts approximately four times in 40 minutes. The two neighboring tables flanking ours were served their appetizers at the same time as ours. And they got their entrees well before we did.Our waiter struggled to get an answer from the kitchen but was attentive and kept us updated. He's not at fault here.The food:Scallop appetizer was just ok. Scallops were charred on one side and near raw on the other. The halibut was bland. The black bass was good but only because of a sauce. Sans sauce, sans all semblance of flavor. Our waiter was apologetic. He tried to get us answers. He comped our dessert, a shoddy imitation of key lime pie for two with an inedible crust that was stiffer than cardboard.I won't be returning to this restaurant.

I say that because share plates shouldn't be a single, small crab cake on a dish - there's nothing sharable about that. The scallops with fingerling potatoes was better when it was more a salad, then a bowl for sharing. Fried rice with shrimp was delish. Sometimes we go and love it, others it ok and rushed.

Our waiter was extremely tentative. I ordered the tuna entree rare and it was amazing. My husbands gray sol was delicious as well. The desserts are fun and prepared unconventionally.

3.0,2/26/2017,"Made a reservation here for 8:15 on a Friday night. I was able to specify a high top table on OpenTable. Took them at least 15 minutes past my reservation time to actually get seated. It seemed like they were running behind with everyone's reservations. My friend and I ordered cocktails - I got the margarita and they were decent tasting but weak. Couldn't taste the alcohol at all. The menu is pricey - most entrees are ~$30. The cheapest are the burger and the lobster roll ($22). The burger was super average. It comes with about 6 thick cut fries. The lobster roll was decently tasty but so so hard to eat. The bun reminded me a bit of a hot dog bun, but it wasn't deep enough to fit the lobster. So all the lobster meat fell out every single time I picked up the roll. They didn't skimp on the actual lobster meat, which was nice but to be expected with the price tag. Once again, came with about 5-6 thick cut fries. I was disappointed because this place looks very cute from the outside, and the menu looks like it'd have some winners, but I just don't think what we paid was worth it. Additionally, a weird service mishap happened where they brought us sourdough bread close to when we first sat down. It had pimento cheese spread with it. We thought it was just a free bread basket brought to everyone, but then I noticed it was also available to purchase on the menu. We had already started eating it and didn't pay too much attention, but when we got our check we saw we were charged for the bread! We let the waitress know we never ordered it, and she said another worker had told her that we ordered it. We did not ever talk to any other waiter at the restaurant. Then we saw her openly arguing with the man, who apparently insisted that I had ordered it from him and pointed at the menu. I have no idea how that situation occurred unless he got me confused with someone else. The waitress took the $5 charge off, but it was uncomfortable to have to argue when I definitely did not order it in the first place!",1,0,0,Dana H.,"Manhattan, NY",766,296,1380
4.0,2/24/2017,"Good place, good food, good prices. Get wine by the bottle the prices are better than by the glass obviously. A few quirks that need to be worked out such as, if your having a steak give people steak knives. The buffalo shrimp is amazing but as an app or a starter however they call it comes with 3 shrimp for $8 which is good but your usually with a date or with another couple so UP it to 4 shrimp and charge a couple bucks more. ---- looks like it's a main dish now actually so I might return to try it there The polenta fries also good. The salad with the NY Feta is really good, dressing is just right. So wrap up, good place not great, can be there though with a few little tweaks.

1.0,2/17/2017,"One of the worst dining experiences I have had in NYC. I've lived in NYC for 12 years, 9 in Gramercy and was very excited when Gramercy Farmer & The Fish opened in the neighborhood.  My husband and I went with another couple. Service was horrible from the start. We waited easily 15 minutes until our waiter even spoke to us and another 20 for our drinks. It got worse from there: 40 minutes later they told my husband they were out of the dish he ordered, then they immediately brought out the rest of our meals so he was left sitting there without food. They then got one of the orders wrong, and on top of that the fish we had was dry and clearly overcooked. They didn't check back to ask us how it was and we were all starving by that point so just ate what we had. 10 minutes later they brought out a lame appetizer for my husband to snack on while we were eating -  ""on the house"" - and when they eventually brought his new entree (after we were finished with ours) they still charged us for it!  I never write reviews but this was too terrible for me not to comment. It's unfortunate because the restaurant has a very cool vibe and a good looking menu. They clearly need to get their service together and their cooking. I could cook fish better than what I was served (and I am a mediocre cook at best).",2,1,0,Monica C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0

And the lobster tail was rubbery. The octopus wasn't bad and a good portion. The brussel sprouts were blah. The cauliflower even more so. The carrots were also average. I wouldn't come back here.

4.0,2/11/2017,"Came here Friday night with my boyfriend at 7:30pm and were seated immediately even though the place was super crowded!For starters, we ordered the pot pie with shrimp, scallop, lobster & monkfish and the duck with farro, quince, and huckleberry. The pot pie was very good and not heavy like traditional pot pies that's filled with potatoes cream and peas, this one was filled with a seafood bisque-like soup and came with super fresh seafood, there was two of everything described! The puff pastry was good too. The duck went well with their pairings but I found the duck to be a bit too tough and tasteless - the least favorite of our orders.For the main, we got the grilled whole sole that came with some greens, grilled cauliflower, brown butter and capers. Delicious!!! Grilled to perfection and every flavor worked well together. Star of the show. For a side, we got the glazed carrots. Simple but deliciously sweet and soft carrots.Overall a good experience food-wise but it is pretty expensive and the service was VERY slow, we waited around 30-35 min for our food to come, but it was a busy Friday night after all.",4,2,3,Karen C.,"New York, NY",226,66,321

4.0,1/4/2017,"I like the concept of this restaurant. It's not a new concept but I appreciate locally sourced farm to table establishments. Came here for lunch and dinner. All starters (which may double as sides) are vegetarian however no mains are vegetarian. Tried the brussels sprouts; the bacon rib; mussels; fried cod cheeks; burger; salmon; and fish Everything tasted just ok, standard. Quality of farm-to-table is normally accompanied by fresh flavors but nothing here stood out as memorable. Perhaps playing it safe and diners can season to their own preferences..? I think the kitchen is trying to figure out the menu still and how to ensure consistency. The brussels sprouts at dinner tasted super salty meanwhile at lunch they were not as salty.

1.0,11/6/2016,"Wow, I'm really appalled at the experience I just had. As someone who lives in the neighborhood, I was thrilled about the prospect of having a great fish restaurant around the corner. I grabbed a seat at the bar at 5:30pm on a Sunday and promptly enjoyed a few delicious oysters, but unfortunately it all went downhill from there. I had ordered the salmon, cooked medium. When I cut into the salmon, it was completely raw on the inside. I always order my meat and tuna rare, but salmon is not something you want to be cold and raw. I sent the dish back. 10 minutes later, I received another dish that was completely black, with a pungent burning smell. The waitress immediately realized the error after the salmon was delivered, and assured me that ""the salmon would be taken care of"" and that the kitchen staff was ""new"". I'm fairly certain I have never sent a dish back twice in my life. The third time, the skin was still completely black, but after I removed it, the rest of the dish was edible. When I received the bill, I was surprised to see that the salmon was still on the bill. I mentioned this and was told that only a glass of wine was going to be taken care of. A $12 glass of wine comped? Which I wouldn't have needed a second glass of if the salmon had been right the first time? Rather than the $28 salmon dish? Money aside, the issue was really with the behavior of the staff of this being a commonplace and acceptable occurrence.

5.0,10/24/2016,"So this is a place with a story .Ownership own local farm in upstate New York and owns a sea food company .So when you have your own top quality seafood and sustainable local farm I say you have the potential of making great food and great food they make .Having bottle of wine from Alsace ""'Zind Humbricht "" with sushi , oysters and some lobster roll works for me .Triple AAA in my book and in this super high foody block with Barbounia , gramercy , Lexpress and few other iconic spots it is great to see that some spots still can be different and high quality .",7,2,4,Youad K.,"ASTORIA, NY",111,16,11
5.0,10/22/2016,"Was excited to try this new establishment.  In my opinion it's a homerun! Open three weeks and the food and service was top notch.  Fresh ingredients from their North Salam farm and fish from a local market make this true Farm to Table. Warmly lit, comfortable seating and atmosphere. Elegant but not fussy. I enjoyed the appetizer of bacon that was glazed and served with pickled side vegetables, others enjoyed mussels and sushi.  Definitely try the whole sole as a main course- beautifully plated and prepared.  The pastry chef created scrumptious key lime ""pie"" and delicate s'mores. Compliments to the owners, chefs and staff for a job well done tonight!",3,1,3,Susan L.,"Dix Hills, NY",168,450,576
4.0,10/22/2016,"A friend wanted to try a ""new place around the corner"" that had opened up and invited me to dinner as he knew I liked farm to table establishments. Gramercy Farmer and the Fish did not exactly strike me as a farm to table place, more of a very very nice restaurant for the chic older/familial crowd of the Gramercy area, the setting (chandeliers, nice marble-y tables, candles, bookshelves etc etc), but to its credit, the food itself was fairly and beautifully simple. We had the Maine Mussels, Local Sole, and Autumn Root Vegetables. Likely wouldn't have separately ordered the veggies had we ordered a dish with veggies incorporated, but they were good (mostly remember carrots). The Maine Mussels, however, were so worth it. There were plenty of mussels and the curry broth was perfectly spiced. We probably spent the most time eating the mussels. The sole was soft but a little too buttered for me. I would definitely go again alone or take my parents out and have the mussels with a small side.",2,0,0,Claire P.,"Hamburg, Germany",12,136,66
4.0,10/20/2016,"This is a new restaurant in a great location. They have a farm upstate where they get all of their produce and just about everything on the menu is locally sourced. After checking out the menu I decided I needed to check it out asap. My friend and I sat at the bar. The bartender was very nice and helpful with the ordering process. We wanted to try it all....but ended up with two appetizers and a side....which was plenty. Unfortunately my friend needed to try two different desserts as well! The Bacon Rib was fall of the bone tender with delicious flavor.The Sea Scallops & Frisee Salad was right up my alley. Light, fresh and perfect scallops.The fried rice was tasty as well, but I might try another side next time.My favorite dessert was the citrus tart with raspberry sorbet..sorbet was AMAZING.We also had this smore dessert, which looks incredible but is a little too rich for me...chocolate lovers go for it!The food is great.The service is great.The wine is great.And the decor is great! I love that we received our bill in a novel.",3,1,1,Jessica R.,"Manhattan, NY",31,61,168
2.0,10/20/2016,"Didn't start off well. We had a table of 6, and ordered multiple appetizers to share. I asked that the squid, which was told was stuffed and about 5 inches long, to be cut in 2-3 pieces, as we ordered 3 orders. I was told no. The chef will not cut it because the stuffing will ooze out, I said that's ok, we want to share, they refused. So I told them we didn't want it. After seeing my dismay, they shorted us an oyster on our order of 15. Not a big deal, but thought it was intentional. They brought out the missing oyster. The bacon rib on the bone was excellent, wish we just ordered 6 of those instead. The steak and fish was unremarkable, which is to say ok. The pork long foot was horrendous. It was a hunk of fat, on a bone. Inedible. I pointed this out and both server and woman who seemed to be a manager said it's slow cooked. What does this have to do with it being a hunk of fat? 6 of us, lots of drinks, 3-4 bottles of wine, large tab. They should have made sure we left there feeling positive. And they didn't. We will not be back.",3,3,0,Food Dude E.,"Rockaway Park, Queens, NY",423,41,1
5.0,10/15/2016,"Stopped in for a pre-theater dinner tonight at Gramercy Farmer & The Fish and was extremely impressed by both the atmosphere and the food. Started with the lobster cocktail from the raw bar, which was served with a wonderfully zesty cocktail sauce compete with fresh grated horseradish. We then moved on to the escarole with black mission figs and the chorizo stuffed squid, both of which were excellent. The squid was a real winner, tender and served in a delicious brothy sauce that we happily scooped up. For the main course, I had the Amish Chicken, which was the star of the show. Crispy skin, perfectly seasoned, and served atop tender autumn veggies all topped with a husked cherry compote. Would recommend all of the above and will definitely be back to Gramercy Farmer & the Fish soon!",1,0,0,Maggie L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0

4.0,10/10/2016,Wonderful and fun lunch here. Started with the chopped liver and scallop appetizers. Couldn't get enough of both. Then went on to the Monkfish Milanese and the Lobster Bone Marrow roll. Monkfish was crispy on the outside and luscious on the inside. Lobster roll was buttery and naughty with the bone marrow. Service was on point. The place itself was posh but warm.,2,0,0,Fina G.,"Bronx, NY",0,9,18
5.0,10/9/2016,"We chanced upon the restaurant on a raining evening. Thankfully they still had a table for 7 of us on a sat night, though we were told that they need the table back at 830pm but we stayed on till 9. The food was good and fresh. From the starter menu, we had mussels, oysters and bacon rib; fresh seafood, succulent and melt in your mouth pork belly! The mains didn't disappoint as well. We had lobster roll, Amish chicken, steak and salmon. Plenty of veggies on the main and they are tasted fresh, literally farm to table! S'more pie and key lime pie for desserts were the perfect finish. Service was excellent!",1,0,0,J K.,"Woodbury, NY",0,14,37
4.0,10/6/2016,Really amazing new spot! I will definitely be coming back here as I live just around the corner. LOVE farm to table dining although I have to say the portions are MASSIVE. Not that that is a bad thing by any means (hello #leftoversforlunch) but a warning would have been nice. My mother and I each got the Bibb salad as a starter and we should definitely have been steered towards sharing one. It's a whole head of lettuce and mine was gargantuan! The spicy cilantro margarita is awesome and had the perfect amount of kick. Overall: Bravo! I'll definitely be in again soon and will plan on bringing friends that have a large appetite. :),1,0,0,Lindsay H.,"New York, NY",0,1,0
