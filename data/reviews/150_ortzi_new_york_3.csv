4.0,2/5/2019,"Ortiz is one of those restaurants in a very busy area so close to Times Square that you don't really expect to love because of high traffic with the consideration that it is a tourist trap, but it is in fact a wonderful restaurant. Ortzi is the perfect atmosphere for dates, small groups and a girl's dinner. There are so many dishes that you can get at Ortzi which is a great share, but there are many dishes that you just want to consume on your own without sharing! Every dish is a blast of flavor with the perfect pairing. The toro appetizer and scallop was definitely on the top of my list! The staff is super friendly and really look to satisfy your every craving during the meal. I appreciated the amount of times and tweaking to my cocktail that they did just to get it right which made the meal that much more special.",0,0,0,Cindy U.,"New York, NY",310,498,849
4.0,1/28/2019,Went here to grab a quick bite on a Saturday before our play at the Booth Theater. We didn't have a reservation but was able to be sat in the lounge. Our waiter was nice and everything came out rather quickly which was good since we were rushing a bit. The drinks were great and the food was pretty good. We started with the Albondigas (meatballs) and croquetas de jamon. Both were good but not something I'd order again. We absolutely loved the polluelo (chicken). It was so tender and the grits were really good. We also ordered the vieiras (scallops) and they were really good too.

When we ordered the waiter told us that we could only order off the special restaurant week menu if the whole table did so. We wanted to order one paella (not on the special menu). Although this is a common practice with tasting menus I was very disappointed to not be able to take advantage of the restaurant week savings. I felt this was unreasonable and unnecessary.

5.0,1/3/2019,"A wonderful experience. My husband and I had an early dinner on a Wednesday evening. The restaurant was largely unoccupied. Our server was efficient, attentive, and helpful. We ordered five dishes to share, and the restaurant provided two small yet flavorful additions. In order of arrival: small rolls with a cream sauce, amuse buche of skewered lamb, pan con tomate, croquetas con jamón, braised oxtail, prawns, and patatas. Aside from the pan con tomate (my mistake for ordering tomato in January/their mistake for serving it), I would say that each other dish proved delightful. The flavors had depth and interest. Lots of smoky undertones. I can usually pick out how to replicate dishes I especially enjoy, and these mostly left me guessing. Thanks, Ortzi and staff, for a memorable evening. Oh, oh, oh. We ended with the copa caramel and a café con leche: just get them.",1,0,1,Audrey C.,"Albuquerque, NM",7,38,2
4.0,12/25/2018,"Came here for Thanksgiving dinner. They had a prix-fixe menu but I was interested in the a la carte. The restaurant is located in a hotel . I didn't realize the entrance to the restaurant is the hotel lobby .  Although I came in confused, I was happy to be seated in the dining room. I asked to browse both the prix-fixe and a la carte menus and then if I could order from both. I don't know why a simple question resulted in ignorant responses. Apparently the answers I was getting from the waiter and manager were 'No' I cannot order from both menus.. the restaurant is only serving the prix-fixe menu. If I wanted to order from the a la carte they will move my table to the lounge (small section between hotel lobby and dining room). After a big stink, I was allowed to sit in the dining room to order the Thanksgiving prix-fixe dinner plus a couple of items I wanted to try from the a la carte menu like croquettes and the pepito bocadillo I stayed because my party wanted to stay. I admit the food is hearty and tasty. The stars are solely for quality of food even though I ate dishes primarily from a holiday menu.

Contemporary decor, good ambience. We ordered a pitch of white sangria, it tasted too sweet, not that impressive. The menu had limited options for appetizers and entrees for weekend lunch, not ideal for a party of 5 like us. We ordered cheese and meat mix, all the appetizers on the menu to share. The food quality was actually really good. They were served pretty quickly, the presentation was nice, well seasoned and flavorful. The service was decent too, pretty attentive and patient.

We were greeted warmly and seated for our Thanksgiving dinner, which turned out to be set-piece, and not mentioned in the website or when we made reservations.So we still ended up having a somewhat traditional meal with turkey rollatini with mashed potatoes, gravy, stuffing and cranberry sauce, brussel sprouts and a starter dish of pig's knuckle with Jamon Iberico, that was absolutely delicious.The dishes were served family-style, all at once and they accomodated the 2 people in our party that had allergies (they looked initially dismayed, but my daughter stated we gave notice to the staff about it). The meal was itself very tasty, definitely 3 levels above what we normally get on Thanksgiving. Washed it down with some Txakolina and a wonderful RIoja and all is well.

2.0,10/27/2018,"We expected this place to be much better than it was. A light Saturday lunch for two (three small appetizers and one sandwich, plus one glass of cider) was a whopping $75. Way overpriced for potatoes and unremarkable sandwich bread (that is only used in Spain for kids sandwiches, if at all). The croquetas were overpowered by sauces and garnishes: a good croqueta can stand alone, and the bechamel should give it flavor. The potatoes were crispy, but smelled strongly of potentially reused oil. We were unimpressed, skip this place. It's not authentic Spanish cuisine, much less Basque.",0,0,0,Em T.,"Troy, NY",0,5,0

I must say I was impressed from start to finish. Instead of bread they gave amuse-bouches and they were delicious... who knew a fried vegetable could be so tasty! (Sidebar: I disagree that anything fried is good- hasn't been my experience.) The Spanish tortilla to start was scrumptious and the branding entree was on point. It's usually hard to make white fish tasty unless there's some kind of sauce on it but this was actually flavorful and there was no obvious sauce covering it.. plus the skin was crispy, which made it even tastier. My only disappointment was not trying their dessert since I was stuffed and had already bought some cupcakes earlier but I do plan on going back- specially since it's so close to work and the PABT.

4.0,9/5/2018,"Ortzi is an unusually good restaurant, especially given two factors that work against it--proximity to Times Square and being located inside a hotel.I have been to Ortzi several times, mostly for work lunches.  It boasts of Basque cuisine which seems to be a mix of Spanish and French.  The tapas selection is interesting, especially the habas (fava bean salad) and patatas asturianas (crispy potatoes).  Good complement to the kale and quinoa bowl or the Ortzi burger if you are so inclined and appreciate the excellent french fries that come with it.Does Ortzi warrant a trip to the area if work doesn't bring you there?  Probably not.  But if you are slaving away in one of those nameless midtown office buildings, find an excuse to have a meal at Ortzi--the food, ambiance and service will not disappoint.",5,1,2,Srini V.,"Manhattan, NY",467,463,97

4.0,6/11/2018,"I went here for a quick lunch and it did not disappoint. There's a $26 prix fixe and considering the ambience and whatnot, it's actually very reasonably priced. For the appetizer, my friend and I both ordered the ajo blanco which is a chilled almond and garlic soup. To be frank, there weren't that many options to pick from considering that the other two were salads. Nevertheless, the soup was definitely good and suitable for the summer as it was chilled. The garlic was not overpowering as well. For the entree, I ordered the pepito sandwich and my friend ordered the lubina. The pepito sandwich was very good. It had a more than adequate amount of meat (for lack of better terms). Albeit oily, my friend is from Spain and told me that's how it's always served. My only qualm were that the fries were way too salty but considering it wasn't the main dish that was, I didn't care. The lubina was also very good but I think it lacked the amount of flavor that the pepito sandwich had. The only two reasons I had knocked off a star was 1. The fries were way too salty.2.

3.0,4/1/2018,"This place was somewhat of a disappointment. The food was 4 stars, overall pretty good, but fell short of being excellent. The sangria was great but when I asked the waitress not to load up the pitcher with ice, she brought back a pitcher that was only 1/3 full. Despite the fact that they shorted the pitcher to offset, they still added light ice to the 1/3 full pitcher. The service was 2 stars at best. The waitress was all over me as I waited at the table 10-15 mins for my  friend to arrive.  Once my friend arrived I couldn't even find the server. The food took forever to come and the waitress was unapologetic. The waitress must have ended her shift while we were still eating and she never told us a new waiter would be taking over.

4.0,3/22/2018,"I had once enjoyed cocktails at one of Jose Garces' Philadelphia restaurants, but had yet to try his renowned cuisine, so I was thrilled when he opened two spots in Manhattan.  Of the two, I made it to Ortzi for dinner first the other day.  The space had a bar and lounge in the front and a small, elegant dining room in the back.  The open kitchen was a nice touch that allowed us to see the action, including the roasting in their gorgeous oven.  When I looked at the menu, I recognized the Basque term for tapas - ""pintxos"", which thrilled me, since there were very few restaurants offering food from that region of Spain.We were seated and quickly approached by two different servers, each telling us about the specials, offering to refill our water, etc.  This was a bit overwhelming and annoying, as we kept hearing the same things twice.  There were only a handful of booked tables, so it seemed that the staff was a bit bored and eager to pounce on each set of diners; they really needed better coordination.  I will say that all of the staff members we interacted with were very polite and helpful, though.  We started with glasses of Red Wine Sangria, which was billed as being infused with cherry-thyme juice, cardamom, and cloves.  We found the blend rather sugary and tasting more like a cherry punch than a spiced red wine.  We were also served two small rolls, which I believe contained cheese.  They were accompanied by a creamy red pepper spread that had a zesty Spanish flare.  An amuse bouche of a thin cracker topped with some type of light, creamy mixture similar to a tuna salad was tasty and made us curious about what was to come. Well, the meal continued to improve as it progressed.  The Madai, or Red Snapper Tartare, was one of the best crudos we had ever tasted.  The white fish was extremely tender and fresh.  It had been tossed with chickpeas and an olive puree, and then basted with a finger lime vinaigrette.  We also sampled a special Octopus appetizer, which included sliced tentacles, pieces of potato, and a slightly spicy red pepper aioli.  The octopus had a minor char, making it crispy on the outside.  However, it was still soft and easy to chew.   The Paella Valenciana was intoxicating!  It contained red prawns, mussels, calamari, cuttlefish, and a ""seafood stew"" broth that infused the bomba rice with the flavors of the sea.  Spoonfuls of a marcona almond paste added an earthy balance.  The Wild Mushroom side dish was a little oily, but still enjoyable.  The Brussels Sprouts were perfectly crunchy and topped with shredded manchego cheese.  Despite the heavy-handed addition of the cheese, the vegetable still remained light with a drizzle of lemon juice being the only other addition to the dish.  Brussels are often paired with bacon or other fatty compliments, which are certainly delicious, but always leave me feeling as if I did not have something healthy.  This version still had a heavily aromatic scent and robust flavor, but allowed me to feel like I was consuming a real serving of an actual vegetable.Forget what you think about Midtown hotel dining and give Ortzi its well-deserved chance to shine.  You will not be disappointed by its intense flavors.",12,2,5,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640

4.0,2/11/2018,"The last winter RW pick for 2018! I had never heard of this place but the menu was enticing and I'm glad we gave this place a try. Note- the entire table had to participate to order from the RW menu.Food: 4/5Appetizers: basque tapas trio! The servers also gave us complimentary mini croissant bread with spicy mayo butter which was warm and delectable. Meatballs- six pieces of small but juicy bitesize meatballs surrounding a perfectly poached egg in the middle... The meatballs were a bit intense with the seasoning but well paired with the sauce and breadsticks.Crispy potatoes- surprisingly better than your average potatoes! Super thin, crispy exterior with warm fluffy insides... didn't expect them to be as good as they were.Artichokes- not as plentiful as one would hope but whatever piece of artichoke you had was perfectly cooked and light! Unfortunately the cheese slivers were pretty salty. The combination of all of the apps together gave you a flavor party! The presentations were beautiful and each dish was a little bite of deep and different flavors.Mains:Hangar steak- perfectly cooked medium steak with tasty mushrooms. The jus had a deeper, lighter Marsala flavor but was super yummy.Red Chile chicken- there was definitely a kick to the sauce! The chicken wasn't too dry and tasted great on top of the creamy grits/chard.Seafood paella- the seafood flavor was a bit strong though there wasn't as much seafood as one would hope in paella... overall the dish was still delicious but definitely a petite portion.Desserts: Apricot tart- pretty good! The texture was of a lovely custard and light cake- not sure I could taste the apricot too much though and the sauce on the side was a bit too tart.Goat cheese almond cake- I thought the goat cheese was actually ice cream! It was a cold, thick, sweet cheese and tasted sooooo good with the cherry sauce and almond cake (think marzipan). Ambience: 4/5The place is small, intimate, and minimalistic. I loved the wall decor and the open kitchen concept as we saw the food coming out. Also the service was great with multiple servers checking on us, without being too burdensome.

Mediocre food and indifferent service?NOT and NOT!We were greeted like the long lost relatives by the young hostess, and immediately adopted by our server Eric.  When we were not sure which wine to choose, he brought 2 different ones to try.The food was terrific - 2 different tapas as appetizers were delicious, short rib bocadillo was succulent, and garbanzo and freekeh bowl was not traditional, but a good accommodation for the current bowl craze. The bowl came with perfectly cooked hanger steak. Restaurant has beautiful modern design, with comfortable lighting and open kitchen (for the curious).We are coming back!",1,0,0,Inna B.,"Fort Lee, NJ",0,58,0
2.0,2/9/2018,"Came here for restaurant week and had a less than great experience here. To start off, the server brought us our drinks. He raved about the sangria, which when came, was pretty terrible. It was completely overpowered with clove, and almost undrinkable. I ordered a barrika basque, because I was interested in seeing what a porron was. Both the menu and Google made it seem like the porron wine pitchers were amazing. However, when my drink came, it was just in a standard wine glass. Additionally, the cider was extremely tart and sour, not at all what I had expected from a cider. When the real food came, things were pretty great. We started off with some bread with an interesting spread - that had hints of smokiness. It was very good. Then our tapas came out. We were able to get all three. The abondigas (meatballs) were a tad on the salty side, but came with a perfectly poached egg and had a lot of flavor. The patatas asturianas (crispy potatoes) came with a decent amount of soggy pieces and couldn't really taste the tomato jam. My friend ended dipping the potatoes in the meatball sauce. Finally the alcachofas (artichokes) were also delicious. The weird thing was that despite have three people in our party, we were only given two pieces of bread. Additionally, we didn't really want to get artichokes, as one of our friends doesn't like them. However, we were forced to get one of each tapa dish. For dinner, we all ordered the hangar steak. The mushrooms that came with it were actually very delicious. The steak had a good sauce on it, but the steak itself was good, but definitely not the best I've ever had. It was a weird combination of soggy and chewy. Finally for dessert, our server ended up bringing us the wrong ones. We ordered one pastel vascos (custard tart) and two cuajada (goat cheese cream), but ended up getting the reverse. The goat cheese was amazing - it tasted like ice cream that was a little less sweet. The cherries were perfectly cooked. The custard tart was standard. It was lacking flavor, and I couldn't taste the apricot. It was a real shame that we ended up getting two of these. Overall, the food here hit or miss. It is either really good or really flavorless. The service was a little standoff-ish. Found myself constantly thirsty waiting for water and our server was a little snarky. The ambiance is nice - plenty of space between us and the table next to us. This is the third restaurant week restaurant I've been to this month, and would definitely recommend going to a different one.",2,2,1,Kenneth E.,"Manhattan, NY",354,280,368

5.0,9/24/2017,"Lovely dining experience!Came here last Sunday with a large groups of friends. Our reservation was at 8:30 PM, and the kitchen actually closed at 9 PM. Our server was very gracious with giving us time to order food and making sure we didn't feel rushed. We chose to order a bunch of dishes, mainly from the meat and seafood sections instead of doing the tasting menu. We tried two tapas - patatas and the mussels. The papatas were really good, I would pass on the mussels. Meat and seafood dishes were definitely bigger but were also more expensive     (~$17-$40) so if you're sharing its best to get a good couple of dishes to share or just have them individually as entrees. We had 7 people and we ordered 8-9 dishes total. Overall I think the food is really good. It's not authentic Spanish tapas but better than a lot of placed in NYC. Would recommend the paella, chicken, short rib and patatas.",4,1,1,Joanna T.,"Manhattan, NY",382,115,117

4.0,9/14/2017,"Newish Basque restaurant located on the first floor of the Luma Hotel near Bryant Park. I've come here for lunch in large groups a couple of times, and the restaurant hasn't been crowded at all. Don't think securing a table, with or without a reservation, would be a problem during the day.Having eaten my way through half the menu at this point, favorites include the polluelo cazuela, all of the sandwiches (tuna and short rib are especially good), wild mushrooms, and the grilled prawns. All the food is flavorful and relatively light, except for some of the sandwiches and the burger. Perfect for a lunch when you still want to be able to function after.Only downside is the price, which reflects the location more than the quality of food. I've only eaten here on expense accounts, and don't think I'd pay out of pocket for it.",4,3,4,Yuting Z.,"Manhattan, NY",435,332,543

4.0,8/7/2017,"KenScale: 8.0/10In the restaurant business, it's not always about location, location and location like they typically say in real estate. Once you make a name for yourself in today's day and age of people's obsession with food, you can more often than not overcome the logistical challenges to diners even if you own a tiny joint in the middle of nowhere. People (myself included) will not afraid to take multiple subway rides or pay a hefty sum of money for Uber rides to get to your place so long as you can deliver in the kitchen. Still, I wouldn't have expected an acclaimed chef like Jose Garces to open his second New York City project (after the first one in Amada at Brookfield Place) inside a hotel that looks like a perfect tourist trap caught right between Times Square and Bryant Park. Perhaps he (with his root in Philadelphia) didn't realize that Luma Hotel where Ortzi is located is the culinary wasteland that is dominated by the likes of Olive Garden and Guy Fieri's establishment that has already been discredited by countless critics? When my wife Jun and I showed up at a prime time on a Friday evening, the restaurant was almost deserted. Of course, why would people other than tourists dine in this neighborhood, especially during this time of the year when Manhattan is flooded with tourists? And, of course, tourists would rather dine at inferior restaurants in Times Square like Red Lobster and Applebee's just because they don't know what they want and have seen these chains in their suburban neighborhoods, right? My venting comes from a sense of frustration that Ortzi isn't getting much love because of a tragic business decision because the Basque-inspired food at the restaurant was quite delicious.Spain has a rich culinary history, and the Basque region in its northern part is particularly well-known for tapas and fine dining establishments. The modern take on Basque cuisine at Ortzi offered many memorable dishes. Curiously, the Bluefin tuna belly with caviar on top (charged at whopping $28 for four pieces of tuna belly) happened to be the weakest dish of the night for being overly oily. On the other hand, the thinly sliced braised octopus with garlic was delicious, and Jun and I couldn't stop digging at the berberechos that we dipped the bread toast. The combination of cockles and chorizo created quite an interesting textural effect, and the potato puree added an addictive flavor that we very much enjoyed. Jun was craving a meat dish that night, and was raving about the delicately cooked wagyu sirloin that was cooked to near perfect medium rare with minimal seasoning to allow the meat's texture to truly shine. The blood sausage that we ordered also turned out to be a winner, working harmoniously with roasted apple for a unique texture. Add a side of crispy potatoes with tomato broth underneath, and you have one very satisfying meal. The lone dessert that we ordered, a Basque-style custard tart called pastel vasco, accompanied by apricot and pistachio was also quite delightful but not overly sweet just as I would have liked. Getting a reservation should not be an issue at Ortzi for the reason I mentioned above. There is full bar with wine lists centered around Spain and France. The restaurant's overall atmosphere does look more touristy than trendy, and its deserted scene during our meal actually made us a little uncomfortable notwithstanding the delicious dishes coming from the kitchen. Would Ortzi have the potential to be a hot spot had it been located inside a trendy boutique hotel somewhere in TriBeCa or Williamsburg? I'm fairly confident it would have been checked out by more people (i.e. New York locals who are hungry for trying the next culinary destinations in the city). It's indeed a tragedy that this fine restaurant needs to endure a cardinal sin of opening in a New York City neighborhood where no sane New Yorkers would want to go other than to watch Broadway shows.",5,1,1,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738

The favas were tasty, but the black bass crudo came with an unpleasant green chile escabeche.

4.0,4/30/2017,"The new restaurant from Jose Garces is near Times Square, which is an immediate turnoff for people not staying in the Luma Hotel and that are from New York. However, it is fortunately closer to Bryant Park than to the heart of Times Square, and it is also better than you would expect from a hotel restaurant in that area.The menu is not as varied as his first NYC spot, Amada, and doesn't have as many sure-fire crowd pleasers. We tried it for lunch, and given the location, has several items that sounds like they would be a lot more than you might want to pay (e.g. $27 for Lamb Chops or $24 for a Sirloin for lunch).We went with a few sandwiches: the Pollo for $17 and the Pepito for $19. The latter was definitely the standout, with a good amount of juicy braised short rib and a small portion of great fries on the side. The Patatas Asturianas ($10) were also suggested as a side, which were not at all ""Crispy"" as the description promised, and severely paled in comparison to the great Patatas Bravas that the chef does at Amada downtown.We skipped dessert, which include 4 options priced at $12 each. It sounds like dinner might be a livelier time to come, and there might be more choices available on the tapas menu. For lunch though, one of the scores of fast casual places nearby feels like a better option.",17,7,8,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1694,69834
