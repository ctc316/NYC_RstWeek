2.0,4/15/2019,"My office was across the street from Anassa for several years so I would occasionally come by for after work drinks / dinner. The one bartender they had on evenings - I believe his name was Bijan - was great. Friendly, great drinks. The food was good. Fast forward a few years to now - I go to Anassa once every few months and unfortunately it's gone way downhill. On my last visit the food was somewhere between so-so to not good. The crowd seems to be mostly tourists now. But it's the staff that really bring this place down, who vary from indifferent to hostile. Last year I had the most awkward experience sitting across the bar from the bartender while she was arguing with a guy that I assume she was dating, while she ignored me for 20 minutes, until I left without being served. On a visit two months later it took 4 requests to receive bread, 5 requests to get water, and our appetizers never showed. Took 30 minutes to get a check. This weekend after patiently waiting for our ""reservation"", and asking what was happening and receiving a blank look from the hostess (who was furiously text messaging the entire time), she then informed us that they had just given our table to a walk-in 5 min ago. She then said there was nothing she could do and walked off. WTF lol? I really want to like this place, but realistically there are much better options in the neighborhood.",0,0,0,Dan T.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,10,0
3.0,4/14/2019,"We took mom to have a nice afternoon lunch. We loved the appetizers and also hummus was really good. We really liked the taste of our entrees. I got Salmon, they got swordfish steak which was very delicious! What I didn't like was the service, I am not sure why they were in such hurry all the time even though the restaurant wasn't that crowded. We got clean utensils and then the other waitress got back the dirty plates and also the clean ones. We had to catch the staff to ask for food or drink all the time. We wanted no sugar greek coffee but was served very sugary and sweet one so we sent it back. It was mom's birthday they even forgot the candles and everything. Which was weird. I usually go there but never seen this much bad service before. Other than that nice atmosphere, good food. I hope they fix the service.",0,0,0,Gizem V.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0

4.0,3/6/2019,"I've visited several times and the food is really flavorful. The restaurant decor is really nice and the place is great for a date night, happy hour with friends or if you want a business lunch. I would recommend to ask to be seated upstairs if you want to talk privately. It is less crowded and in my experience you get better service upstairs. As for the food I've got the beef burger that comes with oregano fries it was very tasty. My go to when I come here is the Greek salad and I add chicken it's delicious. The chicken is very well seasoned and the dressing is really good. My coworker usually has the prix fixe lunch menu which includes a choice of appetizer, entree and dessert for $27.95. The appetizer choices include soup of the day, classic Greek salad, Mediterranean spreads and grilled octopus/sashimi. As for an entree you can choose from Bifteki, fish, chicken brochette, pasta and lamb chops -- for desert they have sorbet or walnut cake. Personally, I think the prix fixe menu is a great deal but for lunch it may be too much food. If you plan on coming for dinner make a reservation I noticed they have happy hour and it always seems to be crowded.",0,0,0,Eli P.,"New York, NY",13,62,51

5.0,2/10/2019,I actually had a girls night out here during Restaurant Week Winter 2019. I made my reservations ahead of time for 4 gals at 6:30pm on a Friday but for some reason they claimed it was for 2. Nevertheless they were able to seat us at a table immediately. Waiter was pleasant and knowledgeable about the meals as well as drinks. I wish I took pictures to show their presentation of the food but I was really hungry and needed my drinks asap lol. The entire table was pleased with each dish. One of my girls is a bread addict and was very happy with the quality and taste.

4.0,11/30/2018,"What's not to love about this restaurant? Great location next to Bloomingdale's, very good food, perfect service, awesome ambiance/decor, solid drinks, AND they've got a DJ. I'm sold, and no wonder it's always packed. Starting with the bread, the food proved to be exactly what you'd expect for NYC. Flavorful and delicious. The bread itself was kind of a thick sourdough/peasant bread, perfectly charred and crispy, with a spectacular hummus (although thinner than typical) dip with olive oil and radishes. Had to ask for it, but loved it.We got a spinach pie and a Greek salad, and both were perfect. The spinach pie was flaky and crispy on the outside, but soft and moist on the inside. The greek salad was fresh and juicy and the raw onion wasn't so overpowering. Drinks - we ordered a Margherita which was slightly spicy, and a mojito which was slightly strong. Both were delicious. We got lemon potatoes as a side, which is cooked  in chicken broth (watch out vegans) but potatoes came out perfectly tender and flavorful. Saw some people get the lamb chops and looked great. Their potatoes seemed crispy. We got the Dorado fish which was fillet'd with lemon and oil, but still had some bones in it. Wish it came with a side or two. The music was on point. DJ knows his crowd. Overall a great choice for date night. Casual but slightly fancy ambiance.",0,0,0,Hal D.,"New York, NY",219,147,305

1.0,11/11/2018,"Sunday brunch must not be much of a Greek thing because they don't seem to understand the concept here.  Service was poor, clueless and slow.  Manager seemed more interested in watching soccer on the tv over the bar than working, serving customers and the things managers might normally do.We kept asking for bread, more coffee etc and kept getting the excuse that it had to be brought from the kitchen downstairs.  Not really sure what that meant and why I should care other than it took a crazy amount of time to get served.  It's expensive for what it is, at least for brunch. Food was decent but not memorable.  Decor looks more like an Italian pub than Greek food.  I don't think it will last long.",3,0,0,Jon F.,"Westerville, OH",1,121,334
3.0,10/27/2018,Im torn about my review because we had such a great experience and delicious food on our 1st visit to Anassa that maybe my expectations were too high. We had an early dinner reservation Sunday for 4 of us. We had a show to see at 7:30 so we made 4:30 reservations knowing we'd have plenty of time. We arrived and the rest of our party was already seated. We were excited to order the lamb shank - their Sunday special.... only to be told there was no lamb shank. That was such a bummer. We ordered the anassa chips which were delicious. My daughter ordered the swordfish and I ordered the sea bass and both were delicious. The missing stars are due to not having the Sunday special and our waiter seemed to want to rush us. It was 4:30 on Sunday not rush hour but he seemed to be over every couple of minutes which made us feel like he was trying to rush us. Hopefully next time we're in NY we'll give it another try and it'll be awesome again.,0,0,0,Natasha T.,"Granada Hills, Los Angeles, CA",6,111,1
3.0,10/22/2018,"Big space so you can almost always get a table.  Solid if not exceptional Greek food in big portions.  One problem is they are always sold out of the lamb specials, and sometimes on Sunday they have no lamb at all.   Servers are efficient and staff is friendly.  Good if you're in the area but not a destination.",0,0,0,Catfish H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,247,114

2.0,9/8/2018,"Now I understand some times people in Customer service are having a bad day but the bartenders at Anassa we're not very nice to those they were serving. Nor were they professional, the bartender was chewing as she took our order. I ordered a drink that was not to my liking, I even had my friend taste it and he actually said it was the worst drink he'd ever had (and he drinks everything) But I could not flag them down to ask for something different as she stayed at the other end of the bar til we'd finished our meal. I had to ask the other bartender for water and she looked appalled as if it was not her job because she was not taking care of us originally. When I asked our server for the check I mentioned the drink was not very good and that I hadn't drank it, obviously hoping it would be taken off the bill. They did take it off but I overheard the 2 bartenders saying that what I said was extremely rude and they had no patience for ""people like me"".  Ive worked in the service industry and I would never treat customers this way, or blatantly talk about them right at the bar! As far as the food, we've had plenty of saganaki and theirs reminded us of plastic. My friend did enjoy his octopus though.

1.0,8/30/2018,"Do not eat here unless you want attitude from the waiter! My father took me here for my birthday (in all fairness they did not know this). We both live in the neighborhood and decided to give it a try. We ordered and noticed that people who were seated after us were getting their entrees before we even got our appetizer. After the app came, I told the waiter we were in a little bit of a rush as we were getting very hungry. Shortly after he brings me the wrong entree. When I told him this was not what I ordered he proceeded to become argumentative with me and insisted what he brought was what I ordered. Clearly I know what I ordered. Only when we were in the process of walking out and the manager came over did he ""claim to take responsibility"". There are so many restaurants in Midtown East that no one needs to put up with this attitude. His immediate response should've been I'm sorry I misunderstood you, let me rectify this immediately.

4.0,8/28/2018,"I love this place for its food and location, and i eat here a few times every year.  I like their wine selection though i usually enjoy a Tito's with Seltzer and Limes on the rocks.  Both soup selections (Avgolemono and Fish) are really yummy, the Avgolemono is my favorite for summer, Fish in the winter.  I suggest you ask for Pita to accompany their hummus, which they tend to serve with Rustic bread - it's just better with Pita (and it feels like less calories).  The Octopus, Beets, Sardines and Mediterranean Spreads are all delicious Appetizers.  I order their Classic Greek and Arugula Salads, and am always satisfied.  I would give them 5 stars but the service can be mediocre - the waiter we had last week (his name starts with a B) seemed to avoid us and so did the busboys.  For this reason, they get 4 stars.",1,0,1,Jenine F.,"Forest Hills, NY",221,332,215

1.0,6/17/2018,"Substantially undercooked lamb they tried to pass off as normal. Very poor salad. Cheap. I think they trade off their proximity to the department stores. Best to avoid. No shortage of close, materially better alternatives. We explained to the waiter the lamb was undercooked, Jacob pulled the kebab to understand how thoroughly underprepared it was. We were assured that was how it should be. They returned with the kebab reheated as it was - all messy and over the place. I would have expected a replacement kebab rather than a complete mess in return. The Cobb salad had no courgette and one tiny piece of avocado. It was also poorly dressed.

1.0,5/13/2018,"Poor food. Amateur service. Terrible management. I mistakenly assumed Anassa Taverna would be a good brunch place to celebrate Mother's Day. I should have opted for the McDonald's nearby, because this place was awful. First, they opened late, leaving a line of customers with reservations, waiting outside in the cold and without apology. Next, after being seated, we waited for over 10 minutes with no attention by a member of the wait staff.  Eventually, I flagged someone down and we were able to place our order. I was disappointed, but willing to put these two amateur mistakes behind me. Halfway through our meal my mother found a piece of wax paper in her omelette. Disgusting. Our waiter was apologetic, but the manager could not even be bothered to come to our table to address the matter. He was working the room, but even after our waiter brought the issue with our food to his attention, he didn't seem to care. To me, this seemed unacceptable.If a restaurant makes a mistake, particularly one that involves a  food safety issue, they ought to properly acknowledge it and apologize.

The food is O.K. There are some pretensions about it too. Quite simply, Anassa is a safe place to grab a bite for lunch, but not much more. I can recommend the octopus and mussels.

5.0,12/6/2017,Except for the Rude Hostess this place is amazing!When we first sat down the first 15 minutes it was boiling hot because the manager had to put the heat on but as soon as we had asked to turn it down he did and everything was perfect after that.The food was Great!There was this pate that you dipped with your bread that was one of the best things I've ever tried.The service was excellent and the bathroom was spotless clean!What's better than drinking champagne and eating excellent food with great company.,3,0,1,Sunday P.,"Howard Beach, NY",328,401,3628
3.0,12/5/2017,"Pretty good brunch in the Upper East Side.Brunch was essential this past Sunday (12/03/17) after a long and successful night of singing karaoke.  My friends and I went to Anassa to recharge, and our experience was A-OK.I was with a large group (9 guests), and we were seated immediately upon arrival.  It didn't take very long for the restaurant to get crowded so I'd recommend making reservations.  The decor was very nice, and our service was friendly.The brunch menu included classics and some restaurant specialties.  I ordered the eggs benedict with bacon.  My friends were more enthusiastic about the farmer's omelette so I had a case of FOMO.  Chicken sausage and bacon sides were enjoyable.I'll probably come back here again, but I'm more interested in trying one of their other menus.",8,5,5,Chris M.,"Manhattan, NY",830,157,161

We made a reservation & even though there were only 3 tables filled when we arrived we were seated at a banquette with 2 tables to our left & 3 to our right. There were plenty of open tables with more space than we had. I ordered the eggs Benedict & asked that the eggs be on the firm side. The waiter simply nodded. When the order arrived, the eggs were very runny and only warm. I couldn't get the waiter's attention as he spent 10 minutes talking to the guests at another table with his back to the rest of the dining room. The bus man was great at replenishing our water glasses, but we had to ask for more coffee. My husband's order was ok, mine was not. I suppose we simply chose the wrong place for a regular brunch as this place specializes in Greek food.

The salad was very refreshing (I did have to ask for more dressing, as it was a little too dry) and the fries were delicious. My friend thought the salad was absolutely tasteless and one of the worst she ever had. Prices are very expensive, but I guess that is to be expected on the UES?

You have the option to sit next to the open window, which would have been lovely on a slightly cooler day. They have ample seating- cute circular booths which may be good for happy hours, and also tables in this side corridor lined with a lightly colored brick wall and full wall glass window on the other side. My overall impression was that of a light and airy chateau in a quaint town. Loved that. The lower star rating is because they have a pretty standard NY brunch menu. I had the lox and cream cheese bagel. Decent dish, they give you the smoked salmon on the side instead of having the bagel made up for you. My partner had the omelette which was well made and come with home fries and toast. You can request hot sauce and marmalade as needed. The Bellini was yummy and I recommend!

The manager finally looked up and asked me if I needed help (why else would I be standing at the host stand?). I said yes and a second host came up and asked if I'd like to sit at the bar or a table. This was the most idiotic question to me as she obviously didn't look at the bar to see that there we no seats available & if I wanted to sit at the bar I would have just walked over and sat myself as that is how bars work. After sitting, my server treated me like most everyone else treats single diners: politely, but judged as a waste of space.

Since we were here and seated with bread on the table (the only decent thing I ate this evening) I decided on the basic salad as well as the rice and spinach side. The salad came out soaked in the dressing with two pieces of tomato - horrible. I was holding out hope for the spinach and rice. That was a fail too, it was so soggy and greasy it tasted like soup that had been sitting out too long. The waiter didn't even ask how our meal was, but I heard him asking all the tables around us.

The potatoes were a little spicy and was cooked in some kind of animal fat and tasted a little weird, but otherwise they were fine.This place definitely was on the expensive side, but its worth the ambiance and the service!!",0,0,0,Aparna B.,"Beaverton, OR",119,244,176

1.0,7/11/2016,"In one word - AWFUL! I pass this place often as I live nearby and it always seems packed but after trying it once I just don't get why. The atmosphere is cute but everything from the service, to the food and prices to staff is just bad. I paid $28 for an itty bitty salad that had 3 shrimp in it ($9.50 for 3 pieces of shrimp?!). The salad was so small and not even a little good, the lettuce and veggies looked like they came out of one of those salad in a bag things. When we were seated it took forever for a server to come over. We were never given the complimentary bread and spread they give although we saw other tables with it. When we paid, a friend and I split the check and a couple of days later I noticed on my bank account they charged my card twice - once for what I actually was supposed to pay and signed up, and one charge for double that amount, overall charging me $30 more than what the total of the bill even was. When I called and spoke to a manager about it, the guy couldn't find my receipt where I signed off on the correct amount, all he kept saying was the server must've made a mistake and he had no solution. He said they charged my friend's card $10 and then the rest on my card - how does that make any sense???? We left $10 for tip but the want they're saying they charged us, they didn't even give themselves a tip, once again making zero sense I explained it to him over and over and he just was silent, he had no idea what to say.He also magically lost the one receipt that would show him he's wrong. He had the receipt my friend signed for her original amount but the one I signed is missing. You run a restaurant, how do you have a missing signed receipt? Needless to say, I will never go back there. The overall experience was absolutely awful, the manager and whoever waited us should be fired as they clearly have no idea what they're doing. If that situation hadn't happened, I'd still say stay away as the price is no where near worth the garbage they serve.",1,0,1,Arielle G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0

The ambiance of the second floor party room is unique because you aren't isolated from the restaurant and have a great cityscape to view. But what really made the evening special was the staff. Everything was served perfectly and with a smile. You could feel that everyone was working to make the evening a great one for our family and guests.

I ordered the lamb salad on recommendation by the server after I asked him which lamb dish was best on the weekend menu. The salad was a pile of fresh spinach, which was fresh, and some sliced lamb arranged on top. The presentation was good with some traditional eggplant salad on the side. The biggest error was the lamb! Thinly sliced lamb roast and then seared on a grill doesn't work!!! Lamb needs to be served at most medium rare otherwise it completely loses its flavor and becomes like dead mutton. Sliced lamb roast without the searing (left on the grill way too long) makes it near disgusting. Sadly this is probably a fairly good place but like many NYC establishments consistency is not achievable...

A bit on the pricey side, but you're paying for location.Great view from the second floor and lovely breeze too when the windows are open. Love the rustic Greek countryside decor. Lovely ambiance. Perfect for lunch while shopping in the area. Service was good, but they brought out our entrees before we had finished with our soup and were trying to take our soup away.

He started explaining how things work in a restaurant and was condescending.  I understand how things work in restaurants, having worked in a few myself.  After the way I was treated today, I will not go back.  If you do go, pay cash.",2,0,1,Annie D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,53,0

My beef burger was good. My friends fish special was cooked perfectly but was not packed with flavor. It should be noted that the service throughout our meal was excellent. As for the prices they are typical of NYC. I have rated Anassa's 3 Stars not because the food is bad, but because i have a very high standard for restaurants in NYC.

4.0,4/21/2016,"Something about Greek food just makes me crave it from time to time. Maybe it's the buttery texture and sweet aroma of the olive oil. The fresh vegetables and ingredients. Or just the energy in the Greek restaurant. To start off our lunch, we each got a white sangria, which perfectly matches the crisp weather, and we were given a basket of complimentary bread and hummus. The bread was soft and chewy with a light drizzle of olive oil atop. After tasting the overly salty hummus, I turned it over and dipped my bread with the table olive oil and salt instead. I love hummus, but it's not always easy to encounter good quality and well-made hummus. As appetizers, we chose the classic Greek salad and Greek meatballs. The salad took me by surprise as it was not a lettuce-based salad sprinkled with crumbled feta cheese and paired with tomato and cucumber slices as I usually see, but it was essentially a mixture of tomato chunks and thick cucumber slices along with two rectangular pieces of feta. The salad was different but delicious. The vegetables were freshly cut as they were generously smothered in olive oil and flavorful seasonings. In fact, the large cut of vegetables gave the salad a unique texture.After a bite into the meatballs, I knew it was a good decision. The juicy, tender ball tasted better than I imagined. The ball was well-seasoned with a rich feta taste, which complemented perfectly with the sweet yet tangy tomato sauce. These meatballs were probably the highlight of our meal! (And it's crazy because we are no meatball lovers.)Moving forward to our entrees, chicken never goes wrong yet some will say otherwise. The organic chicken served with oregano fries, tzatziki, and pita bread was ordered. Thinking back, we probably only wanted fries. You know us by now. When we see the word ""fries,"" our eyes sparkle. Regardless of the grilled chicken breast being on the drier side, the chicken was nicely grilled and generously seasoned. The dish was satisfactory but nothing memorable.Our second entree was the royal dorado (white fish) paired with risotto. Surprisingly, it was our first time trying dorado, and this white fish is known for its rich, succulent, meaty flavors like a red snapper. Unfortunately, it was not so rich or succulent, but I enjoyed light taste with the white-wine pairing and caper flavors. Similar to the chicken dish, it was okay but nothing special.The overall meal was satisfactory but not memorable. Even though the food was average, the service was wonderful. The friendly attitude and undivided attention given to us by our server exceeded our expectations and left a long-lasting impression. Also, the ambiance was lovely. Sitting by the large, open window allowed us to enjoy the fresh air and warm afternoon sun while enjoying the meal and each other's presence.",6,2,3,Fiona L.,"New Brunswick, NJ",422,353,1619

There were very few dinner guests in the dining room.   The waiters were not personable and were not attentive at all.  We waited for our main course for over 45 minutes after the appetizers were served.  The waiter never asked us for beverage refills and seemed a bit bothered when we asked him to check on our delayed dinner order.  Also, my daughter asked twice for a glass of milk -(not a difficult request) with dessert.  The request was first forgotten-then on the 2nd request, the waiter brought out a small pitcher of milk which is used for coffee. Humorously, we just gave up on the service and she drank the milk from the pitcher with the straw she got with her soda.I don't mind paying the going price for a good dinner in NYC, but a with a dinner bill of $195.00 for 3 people with only 1 glass of wine, I expect much better service.Barbara GNYC, NY",0,0,0,Barbara G.,"Massapequa, NY",55,4,0

4.0,12/6/2015,"We enjoyed a late lunch at Anassa after a day of checking out all the Christmas decorations around midtown. It's located conveniently across the street from Bloomingdales and right above the Lexington Ave/59th street subway station. The restaurant has two floors---both beautifully decorated. We were seated on the top floor which had a cool fabric ceiling feature, as well a mixture of tables, booths, and couch tables you could dine at. The decor is airy and light with lots of white washed bricks and neutral colored pottery along the walls. In the summer, you feel as though you're dining outside as they open up all the windows to allow the breeze to flow through.Service was polite and prompt throughout and we enjoyed the saganaki (Greek fried cheese---yum), fish gyro (huge portions of white fish, tomatoes, onions, lobster ragout, and a white sauce served on a homemade pita), and the lamb gyro plate (also well done, served on skewers with a side of pita, green salad, and rice). Overall very impressed with the quality of food here. Prices are perhaps a bit on the more expensive side but we found the portions to be large and the flavors to be delicious.They accept reservations on Open table which would likely be a good idea if you're planning to come with a larger group or for a special occasion.For dessert, enjoy one of their offerings here...or run across the street to Dylan's Candy Bar to satisfy any sort of sweet craving you could imagine!",0,0,0,Amanda B.,"West Hartford, CT",72,404,760

4.0,8/1/2015,"After passing Anassa several times and commenting on its quaint, white-washed, exposed brick interior, I finally decided to see if its food could match its charm. To my chagrin, the hostess sat my party at a tiny two top, in the middle of the dining floor, as opposed to in one of the cozy window-side nooks I had long been admiring. We were also next to a small service station so the restaurant felt especially chaotic and crowded. Multiple servers tended to us during our first round, lending to the chaos feeling, but after we put in an appetizer, things started moving a little more smoothly. Our main server was patient enough to let us hold onto the menu and order one thing at a time, as we craved it. They manicured our table aggressively, and our waters were always full. To start, one of the server assistants brought us lightly toasted bread with humus, complete with radishes and a pitted olive (the table accutraments conveniently included olive oil). I think all restaurants could learn a thing or two from Anassa about how a bread course is done! I was feeling frisky so we  decided to try something new. I ordered the stuffed calamari, which was tender and rich. The thick body of the squid made for a nice container around the three or four different soft cheeses inside (it was quite similar to a stuffed shell). The dish overall was tasty, but I am a sauce fiend so in my opinion it could have used a little further dressing. Next up, lamb kabobs caught my eye, but they did not turn out to be what I was expecting. Rather than pieces of lamb skewed with vegetables, this lamb was ground and spiced, similarly to an uncased sausage. Served with warm pita points, mild tzatziki (cucumber sauce) and a bed of mixed greens, the lamb kabob was essentially a deconstructed gyro. Still, everything was well-cooked and had fresh flavors. The lamb also came with a side of cous cous, cooked soft and flavored with onion and tomato. I haven't had cous cous like that before, but it reminded me of the pastina soups my grandfather would make me as a child. I was licking it off the plate!Before we finished, we gave into temptation and ordered the truffle oil fries. Is truffle oil made of real truffles? No. Are fries ever worth $11? No. But we were hungry, and as they passed our table on a tray to a very happy looking bald man, I couldn't help but covet his parmesan-riddled dish of carbs. They hit the spot.

We did get some interesting looks when we walked in ( which didn't really bother us because we did't care), but we were seated and treated like regular customers, which I appreciated. The host even let us pick the table and the extra star is for him. The fish soup was nice and hot. The arugula salad was ok, it needed a little more cheese for our taste, but we finished it all.

My advice would be just to come here to hang out at the bar for a drink after work (if you work in the area) and maybe get the octopus appetizer and bread and dip as well.  Pass on the rest as there price is high for the quality you get.

The location is fantastic just off of the subway and across from Bloomingdales so it's a perfect way to end the shopping adventure. Food was great - we tried a bunch of appetizers and fish porgie which was great. The spread included a trio of sauces that came with warm pita bread. The veggie chips with tzatziki sauce are phenomenal and a great go to for appetizers. Then if you add calamari it goes perfectly as well and can even save the tzatziki sauce to dip them in as well. We sat in the main floor area which was busy and had good energy.

3.0,4/14/2015,"We came here after a day of gallivanting through Bloomingdale's and it provided a nice relaxing environment.  As a party of 8, we were seated upstairs which was a bit quieter than the main floor that had a full bar and dining room as it was prime-time on Sunday.  You had the feel like you were in an upscale trattoria of sorts with some soft Greek background music playing that made it good for maintaining coversations.Getting to the food, for starters we did an assortment of mussels, octopus, Mediterranean spreads and the crab cake.  The best thing here was the octopus that was cooked well along with the fresh spreads.  Avoid the mussels because it was covered in feta cheese that overpowered the flavor of the actual mussel which was a bit un-enjoyable. For entrees, we did a mix of dorado, sea bass, seafood risotto, lamp chops and the swordfish.  Everyone enjoyed the fish as they were prepared well.  The lamb chops were a bit dry with flavor, so I would recommend sticking with a fish here.Overall, the wait staff was ok.  They were a bit cold with us throughout the dining experience and were not as accommodating as I would have hoped for what we paid here.  The prices are a bit higher than normal, but given the midtown area and high traffic from Bloomingdale's, it only makes sense why that is even more the case here.Buon appetito.",3,0,1,Marco M.,"Manhattan, NY",447,503,263

It's also very nice inside and spacious... so rarely ever had much of a wait.I've usually been forced to share the meze platter... Because I've always come in with a group of annoying girls that don't want to eat their own entree because they just shopped at Bloomingdales (see above). It's pretty good- the tzatziki is my favorite. Bread is pretty tasty as well and you can keep asking for more. Also tried the lamb burger- decent but a little overcooked. Fries were good (but if they messed those up I would have never returned). Summed up by: Meh.",2,1,0,Dani L.,"Boston, MA",289,164,201

2.0,2/17/2015,"My husband and I had lunch at Anassa Taverna yesterday...let me start with the good:-- Complimentary bread is delicious.-- Organic salmon is delicious - but be forewarned that it's likely cooked with a cup of olive oil.-- Restaurant is is in a fabulous location near Bloomingdales.Now the bad:-- Food takes a really, really long time to come out. -- My husband ordered the organic chicken, which finally came with the added bonus of a really long, very curly hair. The waitress apologized and said she'd remake the dish, which of course took a really, really long time to come out. By the time it finally did, my salmon was cold. And after all that? The chicken wasn't even worth the way (according to my husband).-- Service is spotty and truthfully just bad.-- Restaurant is quite dirty. My jacket fell on the floor and I literally had to dust it off, there was so much dirt. -- Prices are unnecessarily high for the caliber of food.Ultimately we requested the manager, who apologized for the hair saying it probably was in the air when the plates were being brought to our table. Not sure about that but in any case, he removed the $26 chicken from our bill at our request.I really wanted to love this restaurant but I doubt we'll return when there are so many better, more reasonably priced Greek restaurants in NYC.",2,3,0,Ameena D.,"New York, NY",93,458,0

Renovations are really nice and the upstairs is great for a private party. Nice atmostphere, comfortable seating and nice lighting for an event. Not too bright and not too dark. Service was good and the wine tasting was lovely.Each wine was paired with different bites from the restaurants menu, forgive me but i should have take a photo of the wine list as I have totally blanked on their names...First white was paired with tuna tartare, very fresh and tasty. They add some sort of onion to it which sometimes overpowers the tuna but is still good. Second white wine was paired with crab cakes. Lots of crab meat inside and tasty. Reminded me more of croquettes. First red was paired with cheese pastries (phyllo wrapped triangles). These were salty pockets of goodness. Second red was paired with Greek meatballs, juicy and quite tasty in a nice red sauce. From the food paired with our wine tasting, I would go back and see how their dinner is.To end on a sweet note, karidopita and baklava were served for dessert. Karidopita is a Greek walnut cake soaked in cinnamon & lemon syrup. This was sooo light and airy and not overly sweet. Really addictive cake and so good I looked up the recipe when I got home. I did not try the baklava but it looked nice.Great event by La Mer and Anassa!!",1,0,1,Caroline V.,"New York, NY",57,507,1081

The eggplant dip was good, a touch creamy in a good way. The grilled octopus was excellent. Sliced, with a few onions at the bottom, and a very generous portion for an appetizer. The fish gyro was also very nice. Thin slices of fish with thick slices of tomato and onions and a great lobster ragu. They are also very generous with their wine pours, which I think is smart, and important!

They do have plenty of window seating however which makes it about 50% better in my opinion.They started with bread and a hummus like dip sprinkled with a kalamata olive and some radish bits. The bread itself was a wonderful stone fired sourdough type of bread and it went well with olive oil. I had lamb chops to eat with truffled fries. Best decision ever.

He did not advise that the fava bean dip contained chicken broth, which was upsetting when I took the first bite and tasted it. Upon asking if it contained meat, he said no. We flagged a manager who confirmed the presence of chicken and grudgingly offered us a different dip (after my friend mentioned removing the fava one from the table). Our next dish to come out was a Lima bean side dish. It tasted of chicken, and when I asked the same manager, he immediately said it contained chicken. He briskly offered us grilled vegetables, without apology. When we paid, the Lima beans were not on the receipt, but the vegetables were and they cost a dollar extra. During the evening, I felt like a rude and high maintenance customer. The items I selected appeared vegetarian, and neither the first waiter not the manager put in the time to apologize for the inconvenience, the obvious lack of attentiveness, or the half hearted investment in our dinner. On the way out, I stopped by the hostess to tell her that, while the food was good, the service was bad and made me feel ashamed for my dietary needs.

Place is close to where I live so had passed it often.The place is very dark. Lots of much younger people than ourselves had to use the light on their phone to read the menu. It is also extremely tightly packed, with the tiniest tables, and a frequent complaint of us older folk is that the noise level was high; not entirely helped by the DJ - why does a restaurant employ a DJ? Not really a place for a romantic dinner.The food was, well, meh. Not many vegetarian offerings; my friend had a lobster moussaka which he said was very hot (temperature-wise). I had a chicken, VERY well fried (ie a bit overdone, but I suppose no risk of foodpoisoning), some rather dark French fries, and a teaspoon or two of tsatsiki. (Tsatsiki was also in one of the starters, a mix of 'spreads'). The bread was nice, though. Once the people at the next table left, I helped myself to their left-over tomato salad, which was mainly, hmm, tomatoes, with no dressing.This is one off the list, or on the list for never returning.",0,0,0,Peter G.,"Manhattan, NY",2,8,0

The octopus stuffed with feta was pretty good...but I think my taste buds just liked everything because it was salty and kind of greased up with olive oil. We were seated in this awkward hallway like area on the 1st floor where the servers can barely get by you. The tables for 2 are also too long so it doesn't feel intimate if you are there for a date. If you are in the area and you have no other choice I guess this is OK...but if you want better Greek food I'd recommend heading down to Pylos instead.

My daughter ordered a burger and it was very good. Now you may ask, a burger in a Greek joint? Most places cannot make good burgers.

3.0,10/3/2013,"I've worked in the neighborhood of Anassa Taverna for years, back to when it was Brassiere 360. When I saw the Mediterranean colors painted on the awnings, and the finishing touches of a taverna-to-be, I was excited. I live in Astoria, so I'm not lacking in the ah-mazing Greek cuisine area. We have Zenon (the BEST), and MP Taverna (a close second), so the bar for Anassa was set pretty darn high. So high, that it just didn't cut it.Where to start? Ah, the atmosphere. They used space wisely, so wise that you feel like a sardine if you're not in the main dining room. I was with a friend, and we were squished into the 60th Street side of the restaurant, with no wiggle room whatsoever. The tables are long and narrow, not big enough to eat mezze-style, that's for sure.And so we didn't.The menu was disappointing from a vegetarian perspective, and the waitress made it clear that they were not flexible to such a common dietary restriction. I was bummed, because online they have a pasta entree that seems to only be available at lunch. I settled for a Greek salad, and a side of grilled vegetables. The salad was decent, but nothing special. Complete with fresh Greek feta and capers (the most pointless garnish on the planet), the salad was generic. The grilled vegetables were delicious, but they're vegetables, so I mean, it's not like they have a real opportunity to disappoint, provided they're fresh. I felt like, as is the case with 99% of the authentic Astoria tavernas, these vegetables should have been offered with a gratis side of skordalia. As they weren't, I had to order it as a side, and pay $5. I'll give them one thing. The skordalia was worth it. So delicious. So garlicky. Had there been a wider vegetarian variety, my review may have been different. The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't special.  My friend ordered the lamb chops, and she seemed happy with them. We both had a glass of wine, so it was no surprise when our casual dinner turned into a $99 feast before tax and tip. I'm not sure that I'd go back, maybe only if catching a movie next door. I'll stick to my Astoria classics.",0,0,0,Alexandra K.,"NY, NY",307,917,57
2.0,9/30/2013,"I gotta tell you...not overly impressed with their ""brunch"".  My friends RAVED about the dinners here and said they wanted to try their brunch on Sunday, so we went about 12:30 pm on Sunday.  i really don't expect anything over the top, but I got a feta cheese and onion brunch omelet which was just that, a very ordinary omelet, laying on a big plate with ONE PIECE of dry american white toast.  THAT'S IT. I mean, not a slice of fruit, garnish or home fries.  NOTHING.....so I'm assuming verything was a la carte unless there was a brunch menu that I didn't see or wasn't given.   Also, when I asked for a refill on my coffee, they bought out new cups and saucers and then simply poured out another cup of coffee from the pot (why didn't they just refill my cup?  I'm not sure if they charged me or not for the second cup....I really didn't look because that would have REALLY annoyed me)..  I also had to ask the waiter a few times for hot sauce (to add some flavor to the eggs since there was very little feta cheese in the omelet, either).  I guess I thought it was weird because I could have gotten a much better omelet, WITH a side of fruit, with coffee, with juice and a choice of two pieces of toast for about 1/5th the price at the Ritz Diner (always packed and right by our apartment on 1st and 62nd). My bill came to $26 for two cups of regular coffee, one omelet and one slice of white toast. My friends kind of joked that they must still be ""working on the brunch menu"", and although  I had a great time with them, I wouldn't go back for their brunch.  I would either go to a place known for their brunch menu (you know, ""X amount of money and it includes coffee, one drink and an entree"" sort of thing), or if I want just a good good, hearty tasty  breakfast, I'll go back to the Ritz.",1,0,0,Keith N.,"New York, NY",2,45,1

1.0,9/26/2013,"It's 6:30 on a Thursday night in Manhattan. I walk into Anassa, a beautiful new-ish greek restaurant I've wanted to try for a couple of months to enjoy a nice birthday dinner for my mom with the rest of my family, including my 4 year old daughter. I made a reservation for 6:30, 4 pp. When I announced my party to the maitrade, which included a young gentleman (30s-40s) and two young women, they could not find the reservation. They checked my phone number, the internet, whatever...didn't see it in the system. Ok, fine. I'm thinking, they'll just say it was a mistake and rectify it by seating us. I was in the restaurant business for many years having been married to a chef/owner. If you want a good reputation, the first and foremost part of a restaurant, the first people you see, the ones who represent you, are the hostesses. Instead of the, ""don't worry we'll still accommodate you"" attitude, the Managing Partner, Tim Pappas, was rude and disrespectful and made quite a big deal about it. After some time (I guess figuring out where to put us at such a ""BUSY"" time), the female hostess had us follow her. At this point Mr. Pappas said that it wasn't a big deal - very much the contrary to which he made it. We sat at a beautiful round table upstairs in a beautiful room. The food was delicious, the wait service wonderful. At the end of our meal (it should be noted that there will still some open large tables), I walked over to Mr. Pappas so I can share with him, politely, my feelings about my experience there. The first words to come out of my mouth were ""The restaurant is beautiful and the food is delicious..."" He basically cut me off and didn't care what I had to say. An argument ensued (all in front of my 4 year old daughter mind you). He basically claimed that I slandered him to his female hostess as she showed us to the table (in fact I did tell her that I was disappointed in such behavior and asked who he was) and he has been in the business many years. I told him I had also been in the business. It's been my experience that you always try to accommodate the customer (pretty much the idea that the ""customer is always right"" within reason).  Believe me, I have had many customers who weren't right, who actually plain out sucked, but this wasn't the case - I was very pleasant and tried to speak to him nicely in hopes we could squash what was just a misunderstanding. Not only did he not do that, he insulted me by telling me that he heard me turn to my sister and say, ""we don't have a reservation.""  Um, buddy - its 6:30 on a Thursday night, I'm out with my family for my mom's birthday, were dressed very well, I have my 4 yr old with me. Do you truly think I'm trying to pull a fast one on you??! I don't know what he heard or what he hears in the future.  What I do know is that despite the food and ambiance - a restaurant that might have been a staple for us - I will NEVER return to. This restaurant gets 1 star due to Pappas rude, arrogant attitude - talking about leaving a bad taste in my mouth... This may not matter to him, and who knows if this review even matters, but in my mind, a managing owner, the face of the restaurant, should be respectful, and want his customers to come back. I will discourage anyone I know from going. So, shame on you TIm Pappas and Anassa for treating local UES-ers like shit.",10,6,2,Samantha B.,"Manhattan, NY",4,1,0

2.0,8/25/2013,"Anassa means ""Queen"" in Greek, but after my two visits that is not the word that comes to my mind.I don't know what sparks the surge in new Greek restaurants in Manhattan, but the market research is strong enough to even provoke the perennially popular Astoria favorite Taverna Kyclades to consider an outpost in East Village. Anassa, run by the owners of Avra in Midtown, is a multi-level restaurant and lounge that is inspired by a particular district in Athens. Located across from Bloomingdale's and near California Pizza Kitchen and a more authentic pizzeria, Anassa promises a better experience to the casual diner than it actually delivers.The staple Greek appetizer Octopus, is described on the menu as sushi quality and charcoal broiled, but it is not as tender as the better Greek versions in the city (not just MP Taverna, Kyclades, Zenon) let alone ""Sushi quality"" and fails to deliver a punch of lemon or olive oil. The lasting taste for me was of the capers. I've liked the Anassa Chips (paper thin Zucchini and eggplant) that are lightly fried. However, the Tzatziki wasn't tangy or garlicky enough, and I bored off the dish after I'd had 10 chips (a single diner would struggle to polish this off). The Shrimp saganaki features a starring turn by the tomatoes, but is otherwise bland. The Spinach pie is competent, but shaped in a coil reminded me of better Bosnians bureks in Astoria. The Chilean sea bass is oven baked with onions, tomatoes, potatoes, and herbs, and is the more interesting of the fish dishes I've had at the restaurant - again, not memorable. Of the desserts I've tried: Ekemek Kataifi would be the only one I would recommend having a nice lemony flavor to the custard and cream, and a light base of Kataifi pastry for textural variation (4.5 stars). It far outshines the tall block of Karidopita (walnut cake) that turned out to be much too dry (crumb) and sweet with the syrup -  I couldn't finish it.Diners are a motley crew. You have your casual walk-ins, and then you have some of the folks you would also find at Avra. I still prefer to go to a restaurant that doesn't have multiple boisterous diners that while (deservedly) having a good time are oblivious of the presence of other diners - in giving an affectionate squeeze (or three) to the posterior cheeks of their female companions...... admittedly, not the restaurant's fault, and not something I hold against Anassa.While I would ordinarily consider a 3 rating for the food, after paying an average price tag of $ 90 per person after taxes and tip, the restaurant name only reminds me of the geometric midpoint of the surface those shameless diners were stroking....

4.0,7/21/2013,"Back to my Mediterranean craving! This restaurant opened about 5 weeks ago and remembered walking by previewing the menu. They recently began serving lunch and the prefix looked like an amazing deal! My fiancé and i didn't decide on dining here until 15 mins before showing up. Good thing they take opentable reservations and had a table ready for us by the time we arrived. The place was half packed when we first arrive but by the time we left around 2, it was full house. Upon seating we were given fresh housemade sourdough bread with hummus spread. The hummus tasted very different than the ones I've had in other restaurants in the past. Very unique seasoning and took a few bites to get used to. I ended up asking for second serving of bread and dip nevertheless. I swear there was a magical shelf where the waiters and busboy reach into for unlimited bread and dip. They just kept going up to tables to generously replenish the supplies. My fiancé wanted to go for something light so he ordered the fish gyro from lighter fair and I decided on the 3 course prefix - Mediterranean spreads where I get to choose 3 out 6 choices, lobster moussaka, and baklava. A girl gotta eat! My appetizer came out to be a lot smaller than expected but the waiter did mention it will be smaller than the normal appetizer portion. Nevertheless I loved my eggplant and tzatzaki. The fava bean purée was a little too earthy for my taste but my fiancé loved it. There were a bit of a wait between courses. But so worth it! The fish gyro was ginormous for ""lighter fair"". It literally was the size of personal sized pizza. Beautiful presentation and extremely tasty! My fiancé doesn't usually eat tomatoes but with the sauces and lobster ragout on top, he couldn't help but eat every bite of it. I actually didnt know what a moussaka was but upon receiving my dish I learned that it is closed to a Shepard's pie. A layer of crispy baked potato on the bottom, a layer of zucchini in the middle and lobster with a tomato creamy sauce and cheese over the top. The cheese was still bubbling when the dish arrived. So comforty and would had been perfect for the winter nights! ( I still ate the whole thing on a heat wave summer afternoon :) ). After finishing our main courses, our baklava was soon served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream! The nuts within the baklava were not overly processed. U can still differentiate each piece and can tell what nut it was.  However they drenched too much honey on top. Too sweet for my taste. A very satisfying brunch/lunch date with my love. And the price we paid, the food and services - it was a steal. Skip restaurant week next week and come here instead for their lunch prefix! 20 dollars 3 amazing courses and top notch service.

I would give it 4.5 stars if possible.Decor: This is  a new restaurant at the corner of 3rd and 60th in the space of the former Brasserie 360. It is a bi-level space, but the room upstairs was still closed, I took a peek and it looks nice though, I would have actually preferred to dine upstairs. The room downstairs is kept in warm colors with light wooden bar furniture to the left, and a light brick wall to the right. This wall separates the main dining room from a smaller, long dining room along the windows. The whole place is decorated with oil lamps or kerosene lanterns. We had one on our table, which made for a nice intimate lighting.Food: The focus of this Greek restaurant is seafood. Our dinner started with complimentary bread with soft and fresh hummus, garnished with an olive and radishes, very delicious. We then shared the grilled calamari dish. The squids were served as a whole body stuffed with a white somewhat spicy sauce. The portion was big and we were glad to have shared it. For main courses, we chose the grilled sea bass and the swordfish kebab. Both dishes excellent, swordfish dish was even exceptional, so soft and tasty with bell peppers and onions.Drinks: They offer a good international selections of wine by the glass and the bottle. I was happy to recognize a  Greek white wine (Biblia Chora) from my wine book, so I could finally try it. This wine was another great success! It's made from the Greek indigenous grape assyrtiko and from sauvignon blanc.Service: Was excellent and efficient, not overzealous.I'm really happy this restaurant opened close to my neighborhood and I'm confident it will do well.",2,0,0,Erik D.,"Manhattan, NY",25,83,0
