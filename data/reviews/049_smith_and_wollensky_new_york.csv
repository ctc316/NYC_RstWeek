5.0,4/21/2019,We come here for every major family event and holiday.   We used to go to Peter luger for decades but service and food are way better here.  On top of the steak the seafood is also great. Very attentive staff and bar tenders!,0,0,0,Michael G.,"Greenwich, CT",0,3,0
5.0,4/16/2019,"What can I say, I love coming here.  The food is great, the ambience, and most of all the bartender! My husband and I came here 5 years ago when we were on our honeymoon. We stopped in Manhattan for a couple of days before going to Italy. We stayed at the Waldorf and wanted some good drinks and the hotel suggested we come here. My husband had already wanted to try it so we went.  We sat at the bar, which was full of regulars but they made you feel at home. We met Ciaran Markey and he really paid attention to detail. He made me one of the best espresso martinis I've ever had. Not a chocolate sweet drink, but a real espresso martini.  We have gone back to New York and have wanted to go back but ran out of time. This year I went for my 40th birthday and it was a must to go back. Sure we could have sat at the restaurant but we wanted to experience the bar again and were thrilled to see Ciaran again. We had some good laughs and as always the comfortable ambience was still the same, no doubt thanks to Ciaran. Can't wait to return. Ciaran is truly an asset.",0,0,0,Evelyn R.,"Fontana, CA",56,17,77

5.0,4/14/2019,Great experience at S&W. I had the Colorado rib steak which was giant and perfectly cooked. The sides were fantastic along with desserts. The service was also excellent.

4.0,4/13/2019,Staple NYC steakhouse with reasonable prices. Came in last night unexpectedly after a change in travel plans left us in the city for the night.  We were able to easily get reservations which is unusual for a Friday night.  Our waiter was attentive and recommended a fantastic bottle of wine that was very reasonably priced!  For an app I ordered the Brooklyn burrata with ugly tomato's and I think it may have been the best burrata I have EVER had.  It was a little slice of cheese heaven that melted in my mouth and left me wanting a dozen more.  For dinner I had the petite steak.  It was good but not as flavorful as I would have liked or expected.  However it was an all around great dinner,0,0,2,Lauren H.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,122,165
5.0,4/13/2019,"Ok, this is not my first rodeo. I've been here several times in the last year. Each time I come it's a different experience. All are positive. The Colorado rib eye is awesome and huge. You will take some home. Fillet is great, order the small one and add a lobster tail for 12 bucks. Hash browns, whipped potatoes and vegetables are all on point. Deserts even better. Order whatever you want with a couple of drinks and the bill will be about $100. Per person. Not bad for such quality. Service has always been great. Minor issues corrected immediately with a smile and an apology. What else can you ask for? Now you have the scoop, give it a try",0,0,0,N W.,"Orange, CT",0,20,0
1.0,4/13/2019,"Where do I begin? We usually dine at another steakhouse when in the city but since we were out for a day with our small children (2yrs and 6 months) we decided to try this place and switch up our tastes a bit. We are business owners so we know very well how this all works, I have never written a review for a restaurant because it was never necessary- This was! Let's begin with how awkward and weird and unhelpful the staff was when we walked in. Yes, I have a stroller, not two heads, help me get in. (We asked if it was ok to dine in with stroller before entering- it was early- barely anyone there) I will say they didn't take a young couple with children as serious customers. Second, we sat for a few minutes with no direction as to where a menu was, no bread on the table. We found the menu on our own in the area to the side.The waiter seemed uninterested in small talk and barely managed to take our orders or even make suggestions when we asked, be nice to children, etc. Thats beside all the other waiters that don't know how to smile but walked by with a odd glance.We ordered mac and cheese for our son and two filet mignon's, spinach, broccoli, and asparagus. When I asked if the vegetables were sautéed in garlic and oil the waiter said he could do that if we want. Ok fine. We asked for our sons food to be brought out as soon as it's ready, eating out with a toddler can get risky. Although our son is generally very well behaved.The mac and cheese came a few minutes later, frozen. The waiter didn't seem apologetic at all and lied about it being made fresh everyday but they put it in the freeZer(it's 11:30 am at this point). Still no bread(maybe thats not a thing here? Who knows?)Our food finally comes and it is - eh. The Steak is Ok, the asparagus is literally thrown on a plate, doesn't even seem like the washed it. The spinach and broccoli were ok. No steak sauce, no bread and we barely see the waiter. It seemed that he didn't take us seriously. As Julia Roberts says in Pretty Woman ""BiG mistake, HUGE."" Our sons mac and cheese comes again but now is burnt on top as if they took a flame to it and called it a day. No actual apology and guess what- we paid for that gross old mac and cheese.At this point a friend of the waiter has come and is hanging out with him by the Bar, right behind our table and in hearing distance from me. We finally ask for some bread, it took a while but it came. Our son sat there and played in his chair watching a video(so we can eat) our 6 month old slept. The waiter and his friend had the audacity to talk about marriage and children right behind us.They said something about how our culture makes women take on children's responsibilities etc but the best was one telling the other ""that kid needs to be put on a leash."" That did it for me, I got up quickly as my husband paid the check. We left and will never return. We have heard of Smith and Wollensky but were extremely underwhelmed. A name won't keep people coming, good service will. Train your people to deal with customers, to treat them all the same whether its an old rich man or a young foreign born couple. Never judge a book by its cover.",0,0,0,Vicki N.,"Bronxville, NY",0,3,0

3.0,4/8/2019,"I had pretty high expectations for this place, given that it's Warren Buffet's go to NYC restaurant. The interior of the place is an old style steakhouse, and we were seated by the window. The blinds were extremely dusty and seemed like they haven't been touched in years. It felt like we were sitting inside the Applebee's in Times Square. Our waiter was impatient, and did not really provide any exceptional service greater than what Applebee's could have provided. I had the filet mignon and the coconut layer cake, which were both quite delicious. The filet was tender and their steak sauce was on point. However, given the ambiance and sub-par service, I probably would stick to other steakhouses in the city for an overall better experience (Wolfgang's or Delmonico's).",0,1,0,Meri B.,"New York, NY",632,65,69
4.0,4/7/2019,"Atmosphere: 4/5 Food: 3.5/5Atmosphere: This is a beautiful NY restaurant that is bigger than it initially appears. The vibe is classy but also fun, with a mix of residents that are getting off work to tourists that are in awe. The spacing between each table was less than I'd like but seems to be standard for NY. Food: They start you off with a variety of breads that tasted freshly baked. The clam chowder was very yummy for starters. The Surf and Turf wasn't as good as I'd expect for the price. The steak had no flavor and the lobster was chewy and over cooked. My dad like the Branzino but he too expected more. Finally the lemon drop was extremely too strong for my first drink, but I'm sure others might not mind that!",0,0,0,Heather R.,"Dallas, TX",610,118,246

5.0,4/2/2019,"This is one of my most favorite steakhouses yet. My friend (mutual steak fanatic) and I came on a busy night and were seated immediately, as one would hope with a reservation. Our waiter, Daniel, knew we were there for a special occasion. We explained the kind of variety we were seeking and he was very helpful in advising on which dishes we should order. We got the porterhouse for two and each got a prime rib (go big or go home!). He gave us some comp'ed glasses of wine and a salad to start, which was very nice of him.The steak was perfectly executed and overall the meal was phenomenal. Just what you expect and more when visiting an institution like Smith & Wollensky. Highly recommend coming here.",1,0,0,LD S.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",113,7,8
5.0,3/28/2019,"This is hands down one of if not the best steakhouse in the city in my opinion. I work in hotel where my guest are always asking for recommendations and this is where I send them for steaks. The steak all by itself is flavorful, juicy and tender but the Smith & Wollensky sauce which isn't overly sweet complements and totally changes the meal. When I go I have to buy several bottles to keep at home for my husband to use until the next tine. For me a steakhouse isn't just about the steaks, the sides have to be able hold there own too which they do. The drinks are good and strong. I always order a lemon drop martini first to size up the bartender and tells me if I'm going to order another drink. The desserts are good the coconut cake which as a dessert I generally never choose on my own because they tend to be heavy and overly sweet is to die for. It is a surprisingly light and playful ending to the perfect heavy meal. Now if only the coconut cake could be shipped which I know it can't because I asked. I just wanted to share it with and change the life of my mother who adores a good coconut cake.",0,0,0,Clarissa G.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,55,30
5.0,3/25/2019,"This is my favorite steakhouse in the city. I've been coming here with my family for years, and we go every time they come to visit me. I came here with my dad last Friday night. We had a 7pm reservation and we were seated upstairs. The vibe is very old school but upscale. Our waiter, Paul, was super helpful and friendly - I would definitely recommend requesting to sit in his area. The break basket itself is pretty epic, but we ordered the tuna tartare to start. It was super fresh and plenty of food for two people to share as an app. We each got filet mignon for our entree, with a side of hash browns and mushrooms. The sides are served family style, so the portions are pretty substantial. The hash browns are probably my favorite side, but I've had the mac and cheese as well, which is amazing. As always, the steak was great and cooked perfectly.The dessert here is my favorite part of the meal, so we ordered the famous coconut cake and the salted pot de creme. Both were SO GOOD. I've had the coconut cake many times - it's one of my favorite desserts ever. The pot de creme was fantastic too, it was a mix between chocolate pudding and creme brulee, with cookie crumble on top. This place is worth the splurge!!",2,0,0,Aiko S.,"Bronx, NY",275,50,15
2.0,3/25/2019,"Average steak and below average customer service...The hostess and people bringing us to our table were rude and unfriendly, and just put a negative tone on the entire evening. Told us our table was ready and for us to check our coats and then had us stand around for 10 minutes while she looked at her phone.The steak was just average at best. We got the filet and it was tasteless. Cooked well, but really nothing special at all. Given its a world famous midtown manhattan steakhouse, i would expect better.

1.0,3/11/2019,A complete embarrassment of a restaurant. I have a nut allergy and when I asked about the bread they put them all in the same basket and said this one doesn't have nuts but it was touching the ones that did.

Very disappointed was looking for a good steak dinner. :(,0,0,0,John S.,"The Blue Mountains, Canada",0,4,1
5.0,3/9/2019,"The food here was excellent.  The filet mignon was great.  The prime rib is huge at 26 oz.  The sides are all great.  Had them do the broccoli with oil and garlic.  The mashed potatoes and mushrooms are both great too.  A slight tick up in price from the other big steak houses, but worth the money.  The restaurant is a little tight.  The squeeze in quite a few tables and chairs.  The bathrooms are super skinny.  Only one person can pass in the bathroom at a time.  The service is great.  I would go back.  A great experience.",0,0,0,Jim D.,"Norwood, MA",0,207,13

4.0,2/13/2019,Went for lunch other day.  Not the first time but first since yelping.  A proper New York steakhouse   Don't have porterhouse on lunch menu but ask and you shall receive. Cost $115 as great as all the top name places you can think of. Def the way to go. Otherwise you can pay $100 for 2 10 oz fillet minions. Wine list is a rip. Yes they should have bottles in the hundreds and even thousands but 76 for house wine; give me a break. There's no reason they can't have several excellent choices between 50 and 80I'm a buyer for a couple of restaurants.

4.0,2/12/2019,"Sunday was our first time dining here. Originally we had plans to go somewhere else but they were unexpectedly closed. After looking places nearby Smith and Wollenskys were able to take us with the next reservation. When we got there we were told to check our coats and we got our seats right away. We were pleasantly surprised! The food was amazing! we split the bone in ribeye and winter special bone in filet, and creamed spinach that was all on point. We even got a really nice bottle of wine, Valentines day celebration of course. The wait staff was super nice, attentive, and very helpful. We loved it. We grabbed our coats and on the way out the oriental woman at the coat check smirks and goes ""thank you for the tip"" we had to do a turn around to make sure she was talking to us and she was. And I'm sorry I wasn't asked to check my coat, I was told too and I thought that was very nice and hospitable. However, if I knew there was a coat check (which I didn't it was our first time) we would've gladly tipped if we had cash. Unfortunately we don't carry cash unless we know it's cash only. That comment really ruined our night because how can you just say that when we just had a very expensive dinner with drinks. We had to call on our way home and tell the host because we were just so flabbergasted that she would even say that. I understand she was upset but she is technically the face of the business. I work in the restaurant industry and she as well as the host are the first and last people you see leaving and that was unprofessional and completely uncalled for. She truly ruined the amazing night we had with that comment. Again, the food and wait staff were amazing and I would go back for that. But I'm hesitant because I don't need someones snarky comments after I just paid over a few hundred dollars for food.

2.0,2/7/2019,"Ive heard a lot of this restaurant in the past, and I can honestly say it was a great disappointment. From the second we walked in, my cousins and I did not feel welcomed by the host at all. We were hassled that our reservation was not valid, although we booked it through opentable and eventually seated inside. Personally I thought that was going to be a minor scuff in our visit, but I was wrong.I have to admit, the Calamari and tomato sauce we ordered were great, the lobster tail was amazing, and our waiter was very kind and had a smile on his face the entire time. But thats where the fathomed greatness of this restaurant ended for us, because my two cousins and I came for steak. First of all, I ordered a 10oz filet mignon medium -rare but it came rarer than anything I could be content with. The steak was bright pink inside and under seasoned, each bite became more disappointing. My cousins both ordered the 14oz dry aged sirloin which tasted more and more like cheetos as a result of the aging with every bite. Although they enjoyed the first couple of bites, every bite became a boring mix of flavors and even more disappointing. Overall, I would have to say this is not a steakhouse I will be visiting a",1,2,0,Sakib A.,"Borough Park, NY",144,4,2
2.0,2/5/2019,"This place used to be one of my favorite steakhouses. Came here for lunch and the waiter forgot my order and then gave my medium rare to my friend who ordered medium. When told about the mistake, my waiter simply said my friend's bloody plate is medium and mine with no blood at all is medium rare. Then in the middle of the meal a waiter we've never seen took the salt and pepper we just asked to bring over and not done with without even asking. We had to ask again for our salt and pepper which they should've placed on the table at the beginning. My steak was way over cooked since I got the wrong order. Do not recommend. I understand this is a busy time but we're still paying customers who deserve the basic service and respect as a human being. Again, do not recommend.

Ignoring us for long, so often. Lastly - the food ended up causing some internal reactions that were not pleasant to over half of us.

We went there for restaurant week of 2018. We shared a salad and fried calamari for appetizers. The calamari wasn't the best because it was kind of dry. Then we had the ribeye steak and a filet mignon both medium rare. I thought the filet was better than the ribeye steak. Then we had the cheesecake and the chocolate cake for dessert.

We had meant to go to the bistro but wound up in the main restaurant where an exceedingly uxorious maitre d' persuaded us to stay, possibly to the chagrin of his colleague next door. Despite this, service was pretty poor with long waits to get menus, order, get served and finally get a bill. If the food had been better I could have overlooked that. But it wasn't. The younger member of the party ordered a burger which was on the charred side of well-done when it arrived. My other half and I decided to share a prime rib, English cut and served medium rare. To say presentation lacked panache is to put it mildly, a large steak swimming in its juices plonked forlornly and naked on a plate looked decidedly unappetizing. In Ireland, we have an expression for rare steak 'wipe its a**e and put it on a plate' which perfectly captures my reaction to the steak placed before us.  The fries served on the side were very average and that's being generous.

4.0,11/26/2018,"First, some facts: This S&W is not like any of the other S&W branches around the country -- at least, not anymore.  You probably know that some years ago, the owner (the same guy who started TGI Friday's - bet you didn't know THAT!) sold the national chain -- but what is not as well known is that the NYC flagship - this one, the original restaurant - was not part of that deal.  So if you have tried an S&W outside of NYC recently, and found it wanting, that's why; the new ownership (in my humble opinion) has not maintained the high standards of the original place, under its original owner. That said, neither, unfortunately, has the original place itself.  To be clear, the decline is small, compared to that of the spin-offs.  Is it still a great steak place?  Absolutely. Is it $100-per-person great?  No.  The tomatoes with burrata came swimming in oil, and the medium-rare filet mignon came medium-well, with a bottle of steak sauce!  Back in the day, the appetizers and sides were always perfect, the steaks came exactly as ordered, and there was never any need (nor desire) for steak sauce.  It is, however, still better than any steakhouse outside of NYC.  And for most folks (and the tourists), I guess that's good enough.",0,0,1,Joe E.,"Belleville, NJ",24,113,9

Sides were creamed spinach and potatoes. Steaks looked great, but the cover was much better than the book. Steaks had little flavor and were tough and chewy. I mean, how does a bone-in ribeye fail on flavor? Well, this place accomplished that feat. Total disappointment.

So off we go to Smith & Wollensky's. Firstly, we sat down and 10 minutes passed and no menus. It was a busy Saturday night so I should give them a little leeway. I had a glass of champagne. We had the seafood platter for four as an appetizer. It was $139. Then we shared one bone-in rib eye for $64 (I don't know that seems like a lot to me) and some roasted mushrooms. The steak needed a bit more seasoning so I found myself salting and peppering every bite :( For dessert, we had the chocolate mousse cake and two regular coffees for a whooping bill totaling $350, which included tax and tip. We enjoyed the food and the staff was attentive but the restaurant is overrun by tourists, b&t crowd and one guest who sat beside me reading reviews of A Star is Born, ALOUD. She constantly sent her meals back complaining about the seafood, to which she described, ""something is off. Something is off. Some THINGX is not right."" The poor waiter had to take off her shrimp cocktail first and then her stone crabs off the bill. I don't know why I care so much. Perhaps I sensed her disingenuous complaint and attempt to sidestep paying for a meal.Lastly, I gave this place 5-stars to start and took off one star for atmosphere and the exceeding noise. I took off another because of the prices but I decided to give it back because it's not the restaurant's fault that the guests are loud.

When it came out to our table and I cut through the steak, he was 100% accurate and it was cooked perfectly. I was impressed and enjoyed the steak with minor seasoning rather than some steakhouses who overpower the meat with seasoning and you can't enjoy the true taste the meat already has.

My wife frequently visits the Smith and Wollensky in Miami when in town on business. She loves her meals there. That is a franchise, though. This is the original. I've always wanted to try it.Our 1 pm reservation was honored and we were ushered to a nice table. Ordered a couple of glasses of Sauvignon Blanc to get going. Switched to red later on.  Some excellent rolls and butter. We skipped apps and went straight for the steaks. Fillet, rare for my wife. The cajun rib steak, medium rare for my son. I had prime rib. Hash browns, onion rings and sautéed spinach. My wife and son were thrilled with their meals. My son advised that his rib steak was the best piece of meat he has ordered. High praise. He has quite the steakhouse resume. Unfortunately, i was extremely disappointed with my prime rib. It was a thinner cut on the bone, rare like I requested. However, it was very low on flavor. I was expecting to be bludgeoned with beefiness, so to speak. But, no. I make better-of course, I use Pat Lafrieda dry aged prime rib so maybe that has something to do with it. One day, I'll get to Porterhouse and try the prime rib there. It is rumoured to be one of the best in the city.The sides listed above were excellent.

5.0,8/30/2018,"There are quite a lot of steakhouses in midtown, and even just in this small area of midtown however Smith & Wollensky is a true standout. In my humble opinion this place epitomizes everything a steakhouse should be. This goes for the service, the decor and of course the food.I've been here more times than I could count - be it for work lunches / dinners, family occasions, etc. I can't think of a single time I've had a bad meal here, and I've tried many things on the menu. You really can't go wrong with any of the appetizers, however I find their raw bar tends to be particularly good. I really like the tuna tartare as well.As for the steaks they are absolutely top notch and always cooked to perfection (which isn't always the case even at places that cost even more than S&W). My personal favorite is either the strip or the filet. I don't typically like filets but theirs is so tender you can literally cut it with a fork. Sort of a weird thing to standout but their béarnaise sauce is out of this world. Always get it on my steak when I come.Overall I love this place and will keep coming back!",2,0,0,Mike N.,"New York, NY",144,283,75

We sat at the table for about 15-20 before receiving We were seated in the back of the restaurant, near the set up area where the waiters carry the food to the tables. My poor hubs was seated in the aisle where the waitstaff was moving back and forth. He had to constantly move his body or his seat in to avoid being hit.  The food was ok and the wine wasn't bad.

4.0,8/19/2018,"Restaurant week (Summer 2018) review:My BF and I came here for dinner and took advantage of the $42 three-course dinner prix fixe restaurant week menu. We made reservations a few days before and we were seated right away when we checked-in. The restaurant didn't seem super busy since I noticed that there were still a few empty tables at our dining area.I ordered the following:-Caesar Salad (appetizer): It's romaine lettuce tossed with a light Caesar salad dressing and topped off with cheese and croutons. The salad was very delicious and I really like that the salad dressing wasn't too heavy or overpowering.-Branzino (entree): I'm not really a huge meat eater so I opted for the branzino. The fish was very light and it was cooked perfectly. The fish wasn't salty at all - awesome! The entree also included a roasted tomato on the side. I recommend this entree.-Coconut Layer Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream (dessert): I read on Yelp that this was one of the most popular desserts and I decided to try it. I thought that it was ok.I also tried the fried calamari (appetizer) and the 10oz filet mignon (entree) that my BF ordered. I really liked the fried calamari and the marinara sauce for the calamari was very good. I had a piece of the filet mignon too. The meat was cooked well and it was moist and delicious.

Yes, please!   The filet seemed a bit larger than 5 oz.  I requested medium and was served more medium rare, but it was delicious nonetheless. The lobster was equally great and just as large!  Dessert: Chocolate mousse cake!  It's my favorite and the one at Smith and Wollensky was perfect.  Again, the service size was very large.  Overall I was very impressed with what a good value this restaurant week menu was.  Several times I have been disappointed by steakhouses that will not offer steak on their restaurant week menus!   If you go to Smith and Wollensky for their restaurant week menu, definitely be ready to eat up.",0,0,1,Jessica M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",87,24,74

3.0,8/13/2018,"Came here for summer restaurant week with some girlfriends. There was quite a few options to choose from, but let's be real- we came for red meat. Appetizers were decent, you could choose from Caesar salad, split pea soup or calamari. Calamari was definitely the highlight. For entrees we all upgraded to the surf and turf which was a 10oz filet+ lobster tail ($10 supplement). No sides came with restaurant week menu, so we also got onion rings, mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. Ya, we were really feeling it. Must agree with other yelpers, there was some fundamental issues with the steaks. 1 being a severe lack of seasoning. Thank god they had salt and pepper on the table. I could understand going easy on the seasoning if this was an amazing cut of meat, but it wasn't. My filet didn't melt like butter and was even a bit stringy??! Temp was ok. The sides were alright, creamed spinach left something to be desired (looking at you striphouse ). I will say while the food was so so, the drinks here were excellent!

2.0,8/7/2018,"I came here to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. From the moment we walked in, there was a slight tension. We made a reservation for 2 at 8:30pm. We get there by 8:34 and check in. Waiting on the side was an Asian family of 3 and a separate asian couple. Okay. A caucasian family of four walks in, apologizes for being late on their reservation, gets seated immediately. Two more caucasian two tops get seated again right after they walk in. A six top walks in with no reservation and the maitre'd tells them to go right upstairs and their table will be ready shortly. It has been about 15 to 20 minutes. I'm basically fuming. They finally tell us that they have a table ready and asks us to head upstairs. We reach the top and look around aimlessly because there is no one there to seat us or speak with us. A server who finishes up on the POS system notices and asks for our names. We finally get seated. The ambiance is quite nice. Very old school, rustic almost. Our server comes by, introduces himself and hands us menus. I asked him if they were still offering the restaurant week menu. He left and immediately retrieved the menu cards. We decide to order clams casino and the loaded baked potato gratin in addition to the RWM. So all together, we ordered calamari, ceasar salad, surf and turf, 14 oz. Sirloin, coconut cake, pecan pie and the aforementioned.Bread basket - yes, this is free. But it needs to be said. Not only was the bread stale, the butter was so cold, you could barely carve into it. Clams casino - very mediocre. They small diced the bacon and cooked it like they were making beef jerky. It was literally soft on chewy. There was no crunch from the breadcrumbs because there wasn't any. The bacon pieces were so big, they overpowered the taste of clams. So I guess it was basically bacon casino with clam pieces. Calamari - this was pretty good. Perfectly fried, it wasn't chewy or overcooked. The marinara was very tasty as well.Ceasar salad - too overdressed. Otherwise, it was fine. Surf and turf - the lobster was tender. The filet was cooked perfectly. However, nothing was seasoned. 14 oz. Sirloin - pretty good. Cooked to the proper temperature. Also not seasoned. Loaded baked potato gratin - let's be honest. This was shipped straight from Waffle House. Soggy shredded potatoes with too much butter and no breadcrumbs does not a gratin make. Coconut cake with vanilla ice cream - delicious. I'm not a big sweets fan, but this was tops. The cake was moist and the cream was light. I would absolutely eat a whole cake of this. Just not here. Bourban pecan pie - who puts a cold pie with cold whipped cream on a hot plate? A deviant. By the time the dessert reached my table, the whipped cream was a puddle of heavy cream again. The pie wasn't bad, though. But use some common sense. Cold food, cold plates. Hot food, hot plates. Seriously. I wrote on open table that we were celebrating a birthday. Guess who got a candle and was sung happy birthday? The table of caucasian people. Yeah. Never again will I visit this establishment.

The appetizers were well portioned, and he enjoyed the fried calimari while I  had the mixed greens salad. Both tasted lovely and fresh, perfectly whetting our appetite before we indulged in the 10 oz. filet mignon. Cooked to order, the medium rare was buttery and lightly seasoned so the flavor of the meat stole the show. We finished with the cheesecake (me) and the chocolate mousse cake (him) which were decadent and complimented the meal.

Smith & Wollensky has that old school charm feel with a doorman opening the door to were you meet the host. We didn't have to wait too long since we made a reservation and we were seated in the upstairs dining room. The upstairs has natural light coming in from the sunroof that brightens up the room. The waiter kindly greeted us and gave us the restaurant week menu as well as the regular menu. For the three courses I decided to get the fried calamari, 10 oz filet mignon and their famous coconut layer cake. The fried calamari was cooked well and served with a tasty marinara sauce. Too bad they don't serve pasta dishes because the marinara would go well with it. The filet mignon had to be one of the most tender I've ever had. It was cooked to perfection and was easily cut with the steak knife. We also asked for their steak sauce which complimented the steak well. The steak sauce had a smokey bbq-like taste. The coconut layer cake was the nice sweet finish to the meal. I was looking forward to trying it ever since it was on the Food Network's Best I've Ever Ate.

3.0,7/28/2018,"Organized a party here for restaurant week and personally wanted to try Smith & Wollensky out since its a Manhattan staple restaurant. I generally enjoyed the restaurant and we really enjoyed the food but there were a few practices this restaurant follows that shocked us.Foodwise I enjoyed all parts of the 3 course meal and loved the dessert! The pea soup here was creamy and the salmon waldorf was really tender. I particularly liked the salmon since I hadn't had a good one a while. The best part of the meal though was probably the dessert, which for me was the coconut layer cake with ice cream. It tasted absolutely awesome and was super sweet. The service here was quite polite and professional as well. You got a serious vibe from the waiters here and they seemed organized. Our party never had to wait too long for our food to come out we were able to give our orders fairly quickly. This is also considering that the restaurant was nearly packed that day. The major complaints we did have with this restaurant though were the requirements Smith & Wollensky has for patrons before and after taking seats. First, at the time of our reservation we were surprised to find out that they do not actually seat you until you have your entire party together. Though most of us (3 people) were together, because our 4th party member was being late we had to wait either at the bar or outside before taking a seat. I don't understand why this has to be the case since most of us were already their and our seats should be available since we reserved them. It just seems like an unnecessary and annoying practice to me. After we finished our meals and paid we were also surprised to find out the bag/umbrella check-in expected you to tip them much like your expected to tip waiters at restaurants. To give some context on this before we could be seated the front desk told us we must check-in our bags first. This was already a annoying request for some of us since we had bags we didn't wish to part with during our stay here. After we were done and were picking them up, the counter worker indicated to us we should tip for using the service. We were unaware of this and thought the service was part of the overall expense of the restaurant. A lot of us have been to high class restaurant where there are bag/umbrella checks but their use was mostly optional, so this came as an upset for a lot of us.Overall Smith & Wollensky is a good restaurant with quality food and service so I can't fault it on that. Many of the practices here though left my party disappointed and unsatisfied with the overall experience. I suppose this place follows a more ""old fashioned"" model for high end restaurants, but this is one of those instances where we would of preferred the aesthetic of an old fashioned place rather then its execution.",2,0,0,Cory B.,"Brooklyn, NY",40,120,723
1.0,7/27/2018,"The one star is for the Chocolate Mousse cake, and okay the food wasn't bad either but nothing extraordinary. Here's what bothered me: Let me first add this was not the first fancy place I visited. When we entered the place, we were ASKED to leave our bags and umbrellas at the coat/bag check area, so we did. I was a bit annoyed with the idea, since I had things in the bag, that I'd have liked to have with me while I was in the restaurant. But it was too much of a hassle to bring them without the bag, so I didn't.Now when we went to pick up our belongings, I noticed a tip jar, which I thought was for people who voluntarily wanted to leave tips. Since we didn't want to leave our belongings there, we didn't think we'd have to tip. But the lady who was working there, didn't smile at us once, yet while giving back our stuff pointed at the tip jar and asked for tips at least twice! We did leave tips out of politeness, but I don't understand why we were required to pay tips, when we never even cared to use the service. Since we were asked by the restaurant to leave our stuff there, we also expect the restaurant to pay people working there enough, so they don't have to ask customers for tips and make them feel uncomfortable.

4.0,6/3/2018,"Classic old school New York steakhouse. I came here for dinner after a conference with a few other attendees and had a feast. The steaks, sides, and dessert were delicious. I got the Ribeye and it was cooked to a perfect medium and  seasoned well. The only thing was that the bacon starter was too salty. I wasn't able to eat more than a bite of it so I packed it up and made delicious stirfry with plain veggies the next day. The service was great. We were welcomed as soon as stepped inside and had 2 different servers check in with us frequently to ensure that we had everything we needed.

1.0,5/28/2018,"You walk in on the main floor to see a beautiful peaceful dining room -- then based on some unknown criteria, you're whisked upstairs to the 'wild n crazy' section where people are shouting 'chug chug chug' and clapping and being loud.  The server approached the table completely uninterested and rushed us into order drinks and ordering food.  This was absolutely not a 'nice' or enjoyable experience.   Here's the rundown of the food:  Ribeye: great, Filet: great, MacNCheese: horrendous with rivers of oil, Shrimp Cocktail: Huge shrimp, Mashed Potatoes: $14 for 2 squished up potatoes, Mushrooms: fine, Onion Rings: basic oily standard onion rings.   Do not get dessert.  This was an absolute JOKE.  Dry Carrot Cake, nearly frozen Cheesecake, bland Chocolate Mousse Cake.  It literally tasted like it came from a bodega down the street. When the 4 of us left and started putting the pieces together, we felt like we had been jipped out of $600.  The sad part is I can see how once this place was probably amazing and over time and with growing popularity, the standards start to slip.  You allow people to scream 'chug chug chug' in your dining room, you allow servers to toss silverware across the table, outsource your desserts to the local bodega.  The steak was amazing and that's about it. ....and the Lily's above our table were real.  And the hosts had fresh corsages, which is a nice touch.  I wish S&W cared less about fresh cut flowers and more about the actual food and service.",4,0,0,Tyler B.,"Atlanta, GA",93,36,27

1.0,5/15/2018,"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday a couple of weeks ago. We were both EXTREMELY disappointed with our meals. For the price, we expected outstanding food. We both love oysters so we started off with 8. These were the worst oysters I have ever had in my life. Every single one was filed with broken pieces of shells. We had to keep spitting them out. They did not taste fresh either. Moving on to the main course we ordered filet mignon and lamb chops. The lamb was 80 percent fat- and not good melt in your mouth fat, the chewy disgusting kind. I understand lamb should have an outer layer of fat but this was unacceptable. I don't have anything bad to say about the filet mignon but I wouldn't call it spectacular. Tasted the same as the filet I cook myself from the supermarket. Not any more tender or juicy. In terms of drinks, I ordered an extra dirty martini. Unfortunately I was given straight vodka which I had to send back as it was burning my throat. No olive juice in sight. The only good thing we had here was the Mac and cheese- wish we both just ordered that as our main course. For 350 dollars for 2 people I was really hoping for a spectacular meal.

Old school coat check, antique bar that is packed with guys in suits at 9pm on a Tuesday, waiters in bow ties wheeling out magnum bottles of wine on carts to fill decanters for eager diners. But it shouldn't it be about the food? We started with overpriced wine that I could buy down the street for a sixth the price (I did the math) and then shared some very old style appetizers lacking creativity and seasoning. It's a steak place so you have to have steak and its a-la-cart to you need to also order $14 of steamed asparagus or $13 mushrooms that weren't all that well seasoned. I still can't figure out why restaurants still have this style of service where the chefs can get away with putting a plain piece of beef on a bare plate and then give plain side dishes for extra cost much like my grandmother served at Thanksgiving dinner and the 80's.

2.0,4/13/2018,"Former favorite restaurant, though never going to return again.I first had a Colorado ribeye here in 2013 and it was the best steak I had ever eaten. The service have been casual and friendly. Returned here a few times and it never disappointed, not until today.The ribeye I just had was thin and inadequately seared and seasoned, with its natural flavor obviously inferior to the one I was used to. The sirloin and lobsters were pretty good though.The food, however, is not the reason for the stars given. I can completely understand the variation of food due to myriads of uncontrollable factors like seasonality and supplies. Passing a certain point of quality, though, the thing that makes or breaks a restaurant experience for me is simply a matter of etiquette.Our waitstaff tried hard to challenge us and push the most expensive options to us on every steps of the ordering process, misleading price and portion of the food. I experienced this in quite a few places before but never to this extent of aggressiveness, and certainly not in restaurants of this caliber. It didn't help that my family looked like a group of Asian tourists either.The gratuity policy is also set and observed in a non-transparent manner. It was stated in the menu that a party of 6 or more will be automatically charged 20%, which is understandable; but ours was a group of 5 and we were charged 20% any way. Though it was stated in the bill that we can request to talk to the manager to mitigate the amount, I would never want to beg or haggle or fight in front of my family in our special occasion.I would be more than happy to pay 20%+ but not for this kind of treatment.The bottom line: even though the food was more than decent, my favorite steak was gone, at least for today, and more importantly, the idea of having a special meal that costed more than $500 at a dining service that lacked etiquette and tried so unsubtly to extract every pennies from my wallet was nothing short of infuriating.

I can't say that Wollensky's lobster roll is the best but it does worth every penny comparing to other restaurants nearby and its own foods, such as steak, horseshoe sandwich (taste like cheesesteak), Lee's Rib, Wollensky's burger to filet mignon sandwich.The slight-golden bun is grilled with slight butter and the most amazing part is lobster meat. Without any fancy seasonings but only thin mayo, chunks of succulent lobster meat is piled into split-top bun.

I dont want to know how much salt, pepper, and butter they use in this dish...because I will eat it again.  Pure Heaven.  These potatoes are an 'in your face' intense experience.  They taste amazing, but it's not subtle.  The flavor bomb happens right away when you stick it in your mouth.But the prime rib was pure gold.  I got a little sad because it was the best I have ever had....ever.  I get sad when the search is over for a particular food item...and my search for prime rib is over.  It is accompanied by horseradish and a cream-spinach-smothered yorkshire pudding as well.  The prime rib was a very large, thick cut, which is nice, but it was the flavor that astounded me.  The only way to describe it, is genuine meaty goodness.  It was almost under seasoned....which strange because most steaks have a lot of salt and spices on them to give them flavor...this didnt.  Each bite made me crave another bite...and I knew I loved it because I was so full and forcing myself to eat more because it tasted so good.We had an apple tart with ice cream for dessert, and it was very good, but I was already starting to have meat withdrawals....I will be back, but not to try new things here....prime rib and hash browns....thats all I need....and all I crave...",13,5,10,Steven U.,"Honolulu, HI",1200,277,2395

1.0,2/11/2018,"My husband and I figured we would try Smith and Wollenksy once just to say we had. Huge mistake! We sat down in a dining room that had seen better days, and after a while a nice man came to get us water. A few minutes later, a different man walked up and basically shoved out a menu across the table while mumbling under his breath. We saw it was the wine menu, so we nicely said we wouldn't be needing that (we don't drink for religious reasons). He then brusquely shoved the regular menus into our hands and walked away without another word. After a substantial wait, he came back to take our order. We ordered the calamari to start, then asked what sides he would recommend. He proceeded to sigh, roll his eyes, and simply list every side on the menu. We ordered the mac and cheese and the hash brown. My husband then asked which steak he recommended. The waiter again responded with an attitude. My husband got the ribeye and I got the filet mignon and shrimp special. The calamari was mediocre; nothing special, nothing done particularly well. Some pieces were cooked better than others. Our entrees came. My meal was SMOTHERED in a heavy butter sauce that was so thick and flavored it overwhelmed the meat. It looked like a layer of mucus on top. Even after doing my best to scrape it off, the sauce completely hid the flavor of both the steak and shrimp. The steak had a terrible mealy texture to it. My husband's didn't have the terrible sauce, but his steak was completely unmemorable. The mac & cheese tasted like it was from a supermarket, and the hash brown was so foul I couldn't eat more than one bite; it had zero flavor and was incredibly dry. My diner down the street could make a better hash brown on its worst day. Our waiter never came to check on how our meal was. We sat with our barely eaten food for more than 30 minutes before someone came and asked if we were done. At least 15 minutes later, the waiter asked if we wanted dessert & seemed offended when we declined. The dessert tray set up on the second floor, tacky and 1990s as it was, looked like it had a good selection, but we just couldn't stand being there another minute. To add insult to injury, the waiter ran after my husband accusing him of not signing the check; the waiter had dropped the receipt on the ground. I stood right by the hostess desk while this went down, and not once did management intervene. After my husband walked back to the table and pointed out where the waiter had dropped the receipt, he walked back to me and explained what had happened well within earshot of the hostess and a man who seemed to be acting like a manager. Neither intervened to say anything; the woman was preoccupied on the phone (as she had been when we arrived) and the man was obsessed with straightening chairs (as he had done to tables throughout our meal rather than circulating and asking guests how their meal was going as the managers do at other good restaurants in the city). I even made a comment about how that rounded out a terrible experience, and neither of them said a word. I worked at a casual restaurant in college, and even my 19-year-old self knew that when you hear a customer say something like that, you shouldn't let them leave the restaurant before fixing the situation. We ended up spending about $200-not the most expensive meal, but not the cheapest- for the worst steak we had ever had and some of the worst service. This is yet another restaurant that survives on an outdated reputation that doesn't match their terrible modern offerings. Go to Quality Meats for an experience that won't make you throw up, or even Quality Eats for a $30 steak that is millions of times better than anything you'll get here.

There was no wait and had two sections to choose from, near the bar which is private or the other side where it's more space for families or larger groups. We stood near the bar . We both ordered the filet mignons with sides of asparagus and Mac and cheese to share. The portions are pretty big and tasted amazing. The asparagus was sautéed with garlic sauce and the Mac and cheese had a creamy texture with slight crisp on top. Amazing combo and did not overwhelm the steak. They have a complete list of wines to choose from to compliment the steak, which of course it's a steak house. So imagine how perfect the steak was and wine! But instead we chose to have Smokey whiskies which was great. And for dessert we ordered the chocolate slice cake, it's a large portion which can definitely be shared. Moist with cream on the side.

5.0,1/22/2018,"As lovers of Manhattan we were loyal to Christ Cella's steakhouse until the family closed it. Over those lonely years we tried the old, the new, the johhny-come-latelies. And then we decided to read all the reviews for the BEST NYC steakhouse and came across Keene's, The Strip House, and in Brooklyn, Peter Luger's. Without a doubt, for all the reasons one goes out to dinner for a fine experience, we selected and have remained loyal to S and W. Waiters are classic; impeccably clean with white butcher boy aprons, a sense of pride as well as NY arrogance. Madame, Sir, deft re-arrangements of tableware, napkins, chairs, a coaster, a crumb....all under the watchful eyes of your assigned garcon. Cocktails are classic or contemporary; permission to use one bourbon over another for a mixed drink comes only from the customer and not the barkeep who may be having an off day.Favorite things: clam chowder, pea soup, crab cocktail, onion soup; ANY type of potato is worth its weight in gold. And the main course: filet mignon ""like BUTTA!"" Sole meuniere is a rare find on any menu; take advantage of the S and W offering. And please, enjoy a slab of prime rib, even a small cut.

My bill came to $202 which was correct. I hand him my cc. He comes back put the bill down and now it says $244 with the next line to put the tip amount in. I call him over and say I never saw a bill like this. Is this the tourist bill I ask. He said oh no that's a mistake. It's someone else's bill.

The steak is mediocre, the sides are boring; in fact, the only good thing that I can recommend on the entire menu is the baked potato. From the moment you walk in and they insist that you check your coat--no coats allowed!--it's a subversion of everything that is New York hospitality. It's designed to simulate a true New York experience, for sure; however, it is the least New York experience that you could ever wish for. Nothing is authentic, everything is manufactured, and there are no New Yorkers here. If you're looking for an old school steakhouse, do yourself a favor and go downtown to Harry's or Del Monaco's; if you need to stay in Midtown East go to Capital Grille--or try STK which is modern but amazing.

Cajun rib eye.  Creamed spinach.  Hash browns.  Wollensky salad.  These are the 4 items I always order when I'm here.  Best steakhouse in all of NYC imo. I mean... I love the other big steak houses too... but at S&W.... the steaks are always so freken flavorful.  While the other ones have been a tiny bit off at least once or twice in my lifetime.

The food is great, the service is good for most of the time however we've had some ups and downs but overall is fine. We walk in to have dinner the other day and experienced the worst welcome from one of the hostesses. She was rude, cold and expected us to have a $200 (minimum) dinner at the bar since there was nothing available for the moment without even an effort of checking. We looked at each other in disgust and left. My money is hard earned and I don't want a hostess treating us with disrespect.

3.0,8/13/2017,"First piece of advice prior to coming to Smith & Wollensky is to make sure somebody else is paying. And by somebody, I mean either the corporate card or your sugar mama. The bill will so easily rack up here once you start adding sides or beverages to your meal, so watch out.I think the food was good, but the feedback that I received was pretty mixed. We were a table of 7 coming in for a late lunch. As a main, I ordered the Dover Sole Meuniere. It was unfortunately pretty bland. For $52, I would have expected so much more. It was just a fried fish fillet that was hardly even seasoned that I could have prepared at home for myself. Although some folks may argue that ordering fish at a steak house is a recipe for disaster, I would say that I've experienced some of the best seafood at steak houses.Sides were great though! The mac and cheese was to-die-for. It really salvaged my meal. I sought feedback from my boss who is extremely well versed in steakhouse experiences. He said he ordered his Prime Rib as medium, and it arrived medium-well. He seemed pretty disappointed because the meat was tough, but he was very impressed with the starter salad and side-mushrooms. Not sure if the great sides make up for the ordinary entrees. Everybody else seemed fairly pleased with their main choices, but nothing to knock socks off.We ended our meal with the chocolate peanut butter cake and some berries & cream which were good.I'm just relieved I didn't have to pay for myself because I won't dare divulge the cost. I'd like to also mention that only 3 glasses of wine were ordered between the group. Therefore the bill was not significantly affected by the booze, the food really does cost quite the fortune.Service was fine. I'll come back maybe if I find that sugar mama I keep referring to.

4.0,8/13/2017,"I was really looking forward to Smith & Wollensky after watching the Eater video (Nick Solares). We came in on a Thursday Evening, had reservations because this is quite a popular steakhouse. I was very impressed with the interior decor and the attitude of the host's. We were seated a little after our reservation time. It was packed that evening so I am guessing that was the reason why it took a little longer than I am used to to get started on the ordering process. Upon examining the menu it was decided that we would indulge in the porterhouse. It was a very big cut of meat. We asked for it to be cooked medium rare, which it was. The meat was juicy and tender, however as good as it was it did not have the best flavor. I was more wowed by the sides than the steak, the potatoes with the garlic creamy cajun sauce was perhaps one of the most delicious things I had ever tasted, so good that I almost forgot about the steak.

The Caesar salad was ok too, but its a Caesar salad, what more should I expect?The filet mignon was a perfectly done medium. I thought that it was a pretty good steak and it was flavorful. The outside was charred which I think added more to the flavor.The coconut cake was very good. It had coconut shaving and the cream was yummy and the cake was moist.

At first the inside of restaurant is decorated very well, I almost forget I'm in the busy streets of NYC. I ordered the calamari, filet mignon and coconut cake.The fried calamari was soggy, it felt as if it was prepared in advance and reheated. I understand it's restaurant week and there have to be corners to cut but I don't think it's worth pre-frying the calamari. Next, although the filet mignon was cooked to a perfect medium rare, I do think it was dry. After I cut the steak open and there was no juice, my plate was bone dry. Finally the coconut cake, it lived to my expectations of being a perfect coconut cake, creamy, soft and juicy with a nice serving of vanilla ice cream.I'll have to come back another day during regular hours to try the menu again.

They typically participate in RW only for lunch, so when I saw that this season they were doing dinner I jumped onto OpenTable to snag a reservation. The four of us arrived on a Sunday night and was seated right away.Smith & Wollensky offers the same menu for both lunch and dinner, which is quite a steal if you can stop in for lunch. The menu offers 4 appetizer options, 8 entrée options (2 with $10 supplements), and 4 dessert options. They also offer a variety of wines at RW prices, which we partook in!I went with the Caesar Salad, Surf 'n' Turf - 10oz Filet Mignon with 5oz lobster tail ($10), and the Coconut Layer Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream. I also stole pieces of my sister's Chocolate Mousse Cake and her boyfriend's Fried Calamari appetizer.In retrospect, I should've opted for the Fried Calamari because it was really good. It was very lightly battered and not too fried, which I liked. The Caesar Salad was good, but not quite the same as a steaming hot plate of squid!The Surf 'n' Turf was really good and I think worth the supplement. The Filet Mignon was very tender and flavorful. My only gripe with the Filet Mignon order was the lack of sides that came with it. Most steakhouses will offer 1-2 sides to split for the table during Restaurant Week, which S&W did not do. My sister's boyfriend, who only got the Filet Mignon, got a slab of beef on a tiny dinner plate and that was it. We could've opted to pay extra for sides, but we didn't think of it at the time since most of the time, something is offered.Both desserts that I tried were really good and I gobbled all of mine up. We had all 4 desserts at the table - I also tried the Pecan Pie, which was pretty tasty as well.Service was attentive enough, although the waiter was noticeably happier and friendlier after we ordered drinks.

3.0,7/25/2017,"I came here with a friend for lunch during restaurant week summer 2017. We were a little late but they were accommodating and seated us right away. It's a smaller restaurant than expected, at least on the first floor. Seats are fairly close together with just enough walking space. Lights are dim and gives you that old-school yellow tone and vibe. It took a while before the waiter came to us to greet us, at least 10 minutes. Meanwhile, we were ready to order as soon as we sat down. Got our glasses of water and told the waiter when he finally came by that we were ready. Placed the order and got our basket of bread (but noticed others got their bread as soon as they sat down, however, keep in mind it was a different waiter). The bread with raisins was really good. If it was toasted, it would have been divine. Pet peeve of mine is when the butter comes hard as a rock. Drives me bonkers! How can I slather this delicious bread in rock hard butter? Appetizers came out quick and entree shortly after. Had to ask for our dessert and check at the same time due to short time frame during lunch. We had our credit cards on the table ready to pay. It was interesting that our waiter took our cards to charge before giving us the receipt. Even thought we knew the price, it was just weird. Fried calamari - pretty good! Nicely fried without being too heavy or oily. Nice crunch, good sized calamari, tasty seasoning. I like that they added a sprinkle of parmesan to the dish. It added a nice texture and taste. Marinara sauce was the usual. Mixed greens salad - well tossed with dressing. Dressing was slightly bitter and creamy. Not bad, just brace yourself for the hint of sour as well. Filet mignon - it's hard to go to a steakhouse and order something other than steak. So we had to go with the filet mignon. Asked for medium. Came piping hot. Although I'm not sure if it was left on its side when cooking. The meat had a nice char all around but when cutting the meat into pieces, there were sections of medium rare, medium and well done all around the filet mignon. Chocolate mousse cake - not bad. Fudge-like outer layer. Inner cake was dry in some spots. Coconut layer cake with vanilla ice cream - hello, we have a winner. Delicious, moist, lovely coconut flavor. Great texture. The cake sat on top of a sweet, perhaps honey, type of liquid. It was the perfect way to end the meal. Ice cream was smooth and not icy at all. I can now check this off my list of restaurants. Don't think I would return but glad I got to try it.",1,0,1,Shelley L.,"New York, NY",96,466,1212

Never heard he word ""sorry"" used so much in one meal by the wait staff. Will never go again. Plenty of better steakhouses in NYC. Also to top it off for 4 people was a complete rip off.

4.0,7/23/2017,"Since 1977. I've never been in the main restaurant, just the side grill. If you can eat at the bar, that's the best. Everything at Smith & Wollensky is perfectly solid when compared to steakhouse standards. Tasty steak, well made sides, etc.But... the Roast Beef Hash. What. The. $@*!. How they do this, I have no idea, but it is unbelievably good. I've spent a lot of time, definitely too much time, in Manhattan steakhouses and spots elsewhere in the country. The Roast Beef Hash is hands down the best thing I've ever eaten at a steakhouse, including the actual steak itself. It alone makes this place 4-stars and if the other menu items were better it would be 5-stars. I've come here just to have martinis and the Roast Beef Hash after work. It's that good. They take prime rib, potatoes, onion and bell pepper and cook it like a pancake in what I assume is a cast iron skillet. The beef and potatoes are perfectly crispy. They bring it out, mix a raw egg in and douse it with Tabasco. If you're in Manhattan and you aren't a vegan or something like that and you don't eat this you are a complete fool and your trip was a complete waste of time. If you live in New York and you haven't tried this you're just lazy or uninformed.",0,0,0,Michael C.,"Denver, CO",127,273,0
5.0,7/20/2017,"Top class food and service to match it! Went to the grill for dinner on a Tuesday evening and the place had a nice busy buzz to it. The welcoming host showed our party of 6 to a nice round table near the of the front of the restaurant. We started with some drinks and the Cabernet Sauvignon went down particularly well. We then ordered the seafood platter special for starter which suited our table perfectly. We all enjoyed the fresh lobster, king shrimp and crab that were served with these two house sauces which were incredible! Every last bit of seafood was devoured. Great start to the meal!We then placed our orders for the main course. I had a filet steak sandwich and the rest of the group had filet steaks and there was one order of ribs. We also ordered some fries, spinach, asparagus and gratin potatoes for sides. The food came out nice and quick and it all looked amazing. We mistakenly got a baked potato instead of the asparagus and we told our waiter and he had no issue bringing some asparagus for us. We all really enjoyed our food and could not complain about anything. The steaks were so tender they melted in your mouth. I'm usually not a fan of steak sauce but their steak sauce is a must try! All of the sides were delicious and nothing was left to waste! Our server kindly offered us some desserts on the house so we got some profiteroles for the table. These were the best I've ever had. The ice cream is such a nice twist and the chocolate sauce just topped it off so well. My first experience here at Smith and Wollensky's was one to remember. The service made the occasion run so smoothly and we enjoyed every bit of food! The only complaint I would have is that I was so full at the end I could hardly move!

We also had some ice cream/sorbet for dessert. All of that and it came out just above our voucher amount!Everything was prepared to perfection, in my opinion. Loved how lightly the asparagus was cooked and seasoned, it was a great break from our decadent feast. The lobster tail was very conveniently cut and grilled and was delightful. The Porterhouse was perfectly cooked - I like my meat so rare that ""it could moo"" as my bf likes to say. Our waiter was great, made jokes bc both he and my bf have foreign accents and poked fun at me bc i urgently wanted the leftover T-bone to take home (it was not, in fact, for my dog. i am an animal).

Went at 7pm on a Tuesday with my boyfriend. Our waiter was a bit inattentive, but I appreciated spending the time to chat. We got sat in a two-person corner table which at first I was worried would be too small for us but it worked out well. We both got the Red House blend - a bit tart for me (I love sweet things) although Peter loved it. It paired well with the meat. As an appetizer, we got the brussel sprouts, then for the main we got the Filet Mignon and Grilled Pork Chop. I loved my Filet Mignon. I kept accidentally clanging my fork against the plate trying to get the last bits off. If I had a dog I would've asked for the bone. Peter really enjoyed the pork chop, although it was surprisingly spicy as it was covered in grilled peppers. That was a nice addition. I wasn't as much of a fan of the pork chop since I thought it was a bit tasteless compared to the Filet Mignon. The house steak sauce was really interesting, it reminded me of McDonald's BBQ sauce. Was a nice touch but the filet mignon held up on its own. We finished up the meal with the Bourbon Pecan Pie. It was good but nothing special. Very expensive, but I had walked in knowing the prices.

Great funk on this throughout, especially on the cap. It was such a massive piece of meat I couldn't finish it. Sides and starters, including bacon, oysters, and creamed spinach were all good. As was dessert. Second visit had much of the same but the prime rib instead of the ribeye. Awesome prime rib, will definitely be back for it. Everything else was as good as the previous visit. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the old school bartenders don't know how to properly make old school drinks. First time there they shook my Manhattan. You never shake a Manhattan, it's the lazy way to prepare it. It's meant to be stirred and strained. Second visit I made it a point to the waiter to have the Manhattan stirred and not shaken.

We ordered split pea soup, mac and cheese, and the Colorado Rib Steak (the waiter said it was the way to go). Everything was delicious, but very simple. The split pea soup was just a green lake- nothing more, nothing less. It was outstanding, but every bite was the same. The same can be said of the mac and cheese and steak (as it should be, in steak's case). I ended up eating bites of steak with mac and cheese to mix things up. Honestly, I had the porterhouse at Peter Luger's, so it's not apples to apples, but I found the meat quality comparable. Another Peter Luger's drawback  is that everyone there drove in from Long Island and has been going there for 40 years.Great steak, reasonable prices for a steakhouse in Midtown, and the service and ambiance were memorable.

I guess this is where personal opinions must be in the category of ""agree to disagree"". I'm not going to go ahead and list all the steakhouses I've been to like the gentleman did - however I will leave it at this. I've been to them all. Period. Every Single One. Hard to believe? I don't know what to tell you. The place is nice looking - but not a fine dining experience like Keens, Wolfgangs, etc. We were a part of 2. The 2nd floor of the restaurant was empty except for a LARGE party ( i assume a birthday or office party) towards the back of the floor. Every other table was vacant. The hostess was going to put me and my friend at a table RIGHT NEXT TO THE BIG PARTY. Explain that to me? I chimed in and we were re-routed. I couldn't believe among all the empty tables - they were going to seat us, party of 2, next to a party of 25 with 20 other vacant tables. That actually pissed me off. We sat down and and we ordered our meal. Started with Caesar Salad for my friend and a Wedge salad for me. I promise you....the dressings were store bought. We asked for NO CROUTONS in the Caesar. It came with Croutons on top. My wedge didn't have enough dressing - but I am not going to judge for that. However, store bought is way too tacky for my tastes at a NY Steakhouse. I asked the waiter if they had bacon. He told me ""Just the thick slabs"" and I said yes - that's exactly what I meant. I ordered it - and those were very good. They come in a large hot oven dish and easily enough for 2. Why is this not on the menu? Every steakhouse prides themselves on the thick slabs of rich bacon. Lugers, Mark Josephs, Wolfgangs, Uncle Jacks, etc. Why would this NOT be on the menu? That's really a bad idea. The amount of revenue they are losing must be astonishing on this staple appetizer. My friend ordered the salmon which was very small - but I am told was good. I ordered a ribeye which was a very nice size but I apologize to have to say this - lacked flavor. I was very surprised. It did not taste quite like a ribeye. I also ordered a sirloin because I wanted to try it - knowing I'd take most of it home. This is going to sound stupid - but it tasted exactly like one from Longhorn Steakhouse or Texas Roadhouse. (Yes - I enjoy going there with my friends when we are going upstate for a weekend).  We ordered a side of mushrooms - Literally - dry - no sauce in it - no olive oil and garlic - nothing. The menu stated ""sauteed"" mushrooms. False. We did not have coffee / Dessert / Alcohol. My friend did however get a diet coke. The last time I was here was about 15 - 20 years ago with friends in from out of town (Scotland). I know my steaks. I am sure everyone on here knows their tastes and likenesses. All these are opinions - some love it - some find it mediocre. I see a lot of ""Really disappointed"" comments. Read all the reviews - and make your decision. I would personally not go back - I didn't enjoy the food - We didn't order anything complicated - and it just was no where near where it should be.

2.0,1/31/2017,"Was very disappointed in this place.  Just stopped by for their RW with a friend for lunch.I came in expecting some good steak lunch because I'd heard that this place was good and whatnot.  It is so highly overrated.  I ordered the caesar salad to start which you really can't go wrong so I don't have any complaints here.  The problem was my entree.  I got the filet mignon (10oz) and my god, it was dry and tasteless.  A quick glance around behind me noted that EVERYONE who ordered the filet mignon needed a bottle of steak sauce.  STEAK SAUCE.  Everyone knows that having sauce is a sign of a terrible steak and that was exactly the case.  I basically choked that steak down because the service is also incredibly slow that I didn't want to waste any more time waiting for a new entree (and possibly get it contaminated by the staff..) since I had to go back to work.  Honestly, it was my fault - I should have glanced around earlier to see what was good and if I had noticed that everyone needed a steak sauce then I wouldn't have ordered the steak.  But I thought I should get steak since this is a STEAKhouse.  My dessert was okay - I got the cheesecake.  It was your standard NY cheesecake. My friend got the pea soup which he thought was okay.  But he did mention that appetizers in steakhouses aren't great.  So I guess that goes to show how ""okay"" his soup was lol.  His entree was the crab cakes which he actually liked because there were large chunks of crabs in there.  It just didn't look all that appetizing to me.  He finished with the bourbon pecan pie which I think we both didn't particularly like.  It was different than other pecan pies that I'm accustomed to and not in a good way.At least we came here for a good deal - $29 otherwise I would've asked for my $$ back.",2,1,0,Stefany W.,"Manhattan, NY",202,214,33
2.0,1/30/2017,"In my very humble opinion this is among the most highly overrated steakhouses in NYC.  Hurts for me to say that because I went here just one time for my birthday in Sept. 2016, and if I never return again I will be just fine with that.This place is just ok.  That's it, nothing more.  The service is meh.  Honestly the servers were kind of weird and creepy.  My wife and I felt as though we were being served by the cast who played the Albanian crime syndicate in the movie 'Taken'.  Yeah, creepy like that.  Our sever wouldn't even look my wife in the eye when she spoke.  Rather, he would look off to I have no idea where and pretend to write down what she was saying.  Did he get her order wrong, yup, you bet.And the food was mediocre at best.  One of the least tasty filet mignons I have ever had.  I ordered it medium and it was overcooked.  And it was pepper encrusted, but way over the top.  Encrusted shouldn't mean every millimeter of the steak has been crazy-glued with pepper corns.  There is such a thing as overdoing it.We had the fried octopus/calamari.  Average, at best.  Just flavorless and soggy.  So disappointing.I dunno.  Maybe we got this place on a bad night?  But I have been to countless other steakhouses so many times and they don't have bad nights, so why should this landmark steakhouse that seems to be a NYC steakhouse institution??  I just don't get it.Anyway, like I said, if I never go here again that will be fine.  I can't even say that it was worth it for experiencing then novelty factor of such a big name in NYC dining.",1,2,2,Jason M.,"Little Falls, NJ",450,241,44

4.0,1/24/2017,"Finally came here for lunch during  restaurant week. Have been wanting to try for years now. Either didn't have time or issue arises. Too bad they don't offer a dinner option for restaurant week.The experience is definitely worth it for restaurant week, and even more so for lunch. Overall, good experience with minor issues. The seating and tables could be updated. The main waiter seemed not to be at 100%.(Probably because of the lower tips from restaurant week deals) The place was packed and limited spacing between tables made it a little hard to walk by to get to our table. Went with three people, ordered 3 different appetizers, same steak, and 3 different desserts. The food is good with one appetizer being the only thing that we didn't like. The free bread basket was good but could've been great. The breads was kind of cold and the butter was a little too hard. But I ain't really holding that against them since it is free. As for the food we ordered:Appetizers:- Cesar salad was good as it should be. Not much to say.- Split pea soup looked unappetizing.(Looked like v***t)The taste wasn't much better. Didn't taste like it was fresh. Do not get this.- Fried calamari was good albeit a bit over fried. The marinara sauce is good as it should be. The portion is rather large for an individual-serving appetizer. The calamari was probably enough for 3 people. Definitely the best of the 3 appetizers.Steaks:- 14 oz dry aged sirloins cooked medium rare. Three of this steak and all were great. Required some trimming of fat. Seemingly worth the $10 supplement but won't know for sure til I try the filet mignon.Desserts:- Bourbon pecan pie was good. Much better than expected. Best in taste and aesthetics.- Cheesecake was good but a little too sour in taste. Texture is soft but not too soft. The graham crust is good and my preference in crust. - Coconut layer cake with ice cream was good. The ice cream better than the coconut cake.(The Cesar salad and coconut cake was not tasted by me. The reviews are based on what they said regarding it.)Definitely want to go here again for restaurant week for lunch, if able. The only other place I have gone to for lunch during restaurant week is Capital Grille in Chrysler Center. Both places are good but I liked the appetizer and dessert options at Capital Grille more. The steak was better at Smith and Wollensky, but to be fair there was a $10 supplement. Would have to try the filet mignon from Smith and Wollensky to know for sure. In general, steakhouses seem worth it for restaurant week.",0,0,0,King C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,6,39

5.0,1/20/2017,"Best Steakhouse in America.I am a connoisseur of steakhouses. I have been to Smith & Wollensky, Peter Luger, The Palm, Keens, Delmonico's, Ruth's Chris, The Capital Grille, Bobby Van's, Ben & Jack's (when it was still by the United Nations in Manhattan), Uncle Jack's, Rothmann's (the one in Long Island, not the one in Manhattan), Gallaghers, the Bull & Bear (in the Waldorf), to BLT (in Washington), to Shula's (in Indianapolis), and to Brumus in London (U.K.), (which is not a steakhouse, but the way they cook their cuts of meat--SO GOOD, they might as well be).  Mostly in New York, often in Long Island, often in D.C., and as far away as London (indeed, I have even been to the top steakhouses in Dhaka, Bangladesh!); I have been to these places to eat, and savor, steak.  Multiple, multiple times.Yes, I have never been to a Morton's, or to Sparks in Manhattan (even though I worked at the United Nations for years).  But outside of that, I have more experience . . . than most.And Smith & Wollensky is THE BEST.  Yes, even better than Peter Luger (which is the majority view of ""best steakhouse in the world"" among native New Yorkers--what I am, as an immigrant to Fairfax County).  Does Peter Luger have the best *appetizer* in the world (its amazing bacon)?  Yes.  Does that beat any *appetizer* Smith & Wollensky has to offer?  Yes.  And is Peter Luger the 2nd best steakhouse in America?  Yes.But, you come to a steakhouse for the *meat*.  I am a prime rib guy, but I eat it all.  Lamb, filet mignon, etc.  And, the cuts, and how they are cooked at Smith & Wollensky, are the best in the world.  Medium rare is the most tender there, of anywhere.  And the fat on the prime rib cut, along with the meat on the bone is to. die. for.Second, you come to a steakhouse for the side *with the meat*.  Appetizers come third, they just do.  And the creamed spinach (the best, indeed, in some way, the *only* side for steak at a steakhouse) at Smith & Wollensky is the best of anywhere (except Peter Luger, which only ties them--it does not *beat* them).And third, when it comes to those appetizers, who has the best that there are (outside of the Peter Luger bacon)?  Smith & Wollensky, without doubt.  The best baked potato in the world, by far.  The best shrimps and salads, by far (if you ever want to get to those things).  Indeed, the best free bread of all the free breads at all the steakhouses; maybe the best free bread that you can get at any *restaurant* anywhere on earth (or at least in America).Throw in the service (best in America again, while some tie it, Peter Luger, Rothmann's, Bobby Van's, Delmonico's, Keens, Uncle Jack's . . . that's it), and it just IS the perfect steakhouse.  Oh, and let's not forget the *one* thing you can have as an entree at a steakhouse (instead of steak . . . sometimes . . . without committing a mortal sin): lobster.  No one does it better than Smith & Wollensky, and they have better selection than anyone this side of Docks.  Want 1 pound?  Sure.  Want 1.5 pounds?  Sure.  Three pounds?  Sure.  Two pounds?  Sure.  You want it, and they will have it.More often than *any* of their competitors who serve lobster.  They will have it.  Not as often as the best seafood restaurants (again, Docks), but, that isn't exactly their ""competitors"", now is it?As far as I am concerned, Smith & Wollensky is rated far, far too low here at Yelp.  It is the perfect steakhouse, and, along with Peter Luger, the only 5-star one in the nation.  It is a crime against nature that they closed down the one here in Washington on 19th Street (near M Street), and I can honestly say that I am proud New York would never let the one half-way between St. Patrick's and the back end of the United Nations, on the East Side of Manhattan, go out of business.  I cannot recommend it more (whatever city you are in, go to the one nearest to you) to everyone with eyes to read this, and a mouth to eat with.Oh, and last Anne Burrell, is right when she says on TV that the coconut cake at Smith & Wollensky is one of the top deserts you will ever eat in your life.  If you have room after the steak (remember, that is why you *should* be there in the first place!), eat that too!",4,1,2,Bradford S.,"Chantilly, VA",38,119,750
1.0,1/20/2017,"Gave this place a second try as we had a gift card to use. Just as mediocre and overpriced as the first time. Steaks are sizable but lack flavor and just felt below par for the price and the way they promote themselves. Had a filet on first visit and it was dry and flavorless. This time I tried the bone-in sirloin and also found it severely lacking in seasoning, not to mention more gristle and fat than I prefer. The calamari came out way too fast to be prepared upon order, indicating to me it was made ahead of time and sits under a lamp. The sauce it came with had a good taste though. The sides we ordered with our steaks were gross- loaded potato gratin and spinach....Sat under a heat lamp way too long and I swear the gratin is not made in house but is something out of a cisco truck.

Service was frankly, poor; bickering among the staff; didn't bring a side dish as ordered, had to remind the waiter to bring one of the desserts we ordered; had to beg for the $305 bill and didn't get offered a drink until our food arrived. Advice: Sides are large enough to share. They are not individually portioned. The coconut cake for dessert for delicious.

We had the fried calamari and the Wollensky Salad to start - the calamari was pretty standard, good but nothing special, and the salad was delightful! A very unique blend of ingredients - bacon slices and cubes of potato among them - with a perfectly paired dressing that I can't remember the name of. For our entrées, we had the lamb, the filet mignon, the salmon, and the prime steak. We preferred our red meats cooked medium, and it was done so delightfully - melt in your mouth goodness. Their steak sauce goes fantastically with it as well!We did bring wine, so if you're thinking of doing the same, take note - they do have a corkage fee of $35.All in all, our experience here was pretty much perfect. The waiters and hostesses were incredibly nice, the restaurant wasn't uncomfortably packed (they even have a coat check so you don't have to worry about carrying your jacket around), and everything we had was delicious. The only thing that may be a turn off for some is the pricing. Admittedly, some things on the menu were priced quite high, but honestly, thinning your wallet out at this place is worth it! haha Definitely a great experience.

The giant asparagus was typical for this type of place but SO BLAND. Ended with a large slice of carrot cake -- again, it was OK but felt like something you could pick up at the grocery store. The restaurant doesn't have much atmosphere. I would not really describe typical attire as ""dressy"".

4.0,10/31/2016,"It's Saturday night before a Broadway show. You are all dressed up and ready for dinner.  Where should you go?  The answer is the best Steakhouse in New York City. Called ""the quintessential New York steakhouse"" by Gourmet Magazine, Smith & Wollensky features USDA Prime steaks, dry aged and hand butchered on premises.When you arrive you enter into what seems to be a time warp. This was our second time with reservations in the main dining room which I feel gives you that atmosphere of what I feel is the late 1800's. As we walked in the main dining room there was a giant center piece that had fresh lilies and other flowers that helped prepare your senses for what is to come. Most of the steakhouses are lit as if they were casinos, not this restaurant.  Inside these hallowed halls of this incredible steak house you find that it is bright and warm, it is decorated with the New York City style with old photos of New York, white table cloths and an elegant table setting.  We were seated and greeted by our waiter Frank.  This guy looked like the quintessential guy from Brooklyn.  Dressed in a butcher jacket with brown collar, he asked us about our day and what we were looking for with regard to a diner. He was very knowledgeable as he explained in detain exactly what was offered that day.We started our dining event with Bombay dry gin martinis with blue cheese stuffed olives (to die for) and the Line-Caught Tuna Tartare.  A scrumptious blend of raw tuna with a little soy and citrus juice to act as a cooking agent that brought out the Asian-infused flavor.After another round of Martinis that were perfectly poured, we ordered our steaks.  My wife ordered the 14 oz Sirloin med-well and I went with waiter Frank's suggestion and ordered the NY Cut Sirloin (24 oz. On the Bone) med-rare.  Since we were not in a hurry, we relaxed and enjoyed wonderful conversation enjoying our Tuna Tartare and martinis.   When we finished or tuna, our salads arrived.  These were a crisp flavorful Traditional Caesar salad that I can only assume that the dressing was made in house as there was a delicate blend of anchovies and seasonings.  Wow! After a perfect amount of time our steaks arrived.What steaks these were. I could smell them coming -- the acrid top note of its char, the funky bottom note of properly aged beef. I could even hear it, still sizzling as Frank presented them to us.  I ordered the cream spinach or as Frank called it ""NY Baby food ""as my side opting for not carbs. No sauce was needed, just a bit of salt and pepper.  These steaks cut like butter and the taste was a delicate tang, and penetrating mineral quality, a wonderful richness of textures: crunchy at the edges, tender at the bone.   After forty minutes of pure enjoyment we polished off the streaks and then enjoyed espresso and a fine delightful piece of cake that was not too heavy.  This was by far the best two hours of dining I have ever had.So if you are looking for the New York Steak House experience, you will find it here at Smith & Wollensky.  Yes it was pricy, but for me, this was a once a year meal that I never forget.",2,0,0,Kahoona S.,"Barnegat, NJ",35,33,11

2.0,10/13/2016,"First and foremost, the portions were more than generous, normal sized portions. Some may claim portions are smaller for RW (Restaurant Week) This is definitely NOT the case at Smith and Wollensky. Also, my party of 4 was in no way segregrated. We were seated with eveyone else and as far as I could tell, diners were partakimg of the RW menu as well as the regular menu.Ambiance and Service: beautiful reataurant, conversations are low and not at all distracting. Tables are a comfotable distance away from eachother.We were a party of 3 with reservations for lunch at 3. Host was VERY accomadating to us when we arrived about 25 minutes early. Although we were willing to wait at the bar, were seated within 5 minutes.  Our waiter was prompt and attentive throughout the meal and we didn't even need to ask for refills of water as some have complained. They were immediately refilled when necessary.Food. We all ordered off the Restaurant Week Menu which had a great deal of variety for every course.Appetizers: Split Pea Soup: Amazingly excellent! Delicious with the PERFECT consistency. Not too thick, not to thin. Sadly, this was the highlight of my meal.Ceasar Salad: Awful. Limp and somewhat weird tasting. Not the worst salad ever, according to my sister, just the second worst. She couldn't eat it.Entrees:Steak: 16 oz aged sirloin ($10 suppl). Honestly, sadly underwhelming. Far from the best steak I've ever had. Way too much fat and gristle on it for me, hell, for ANYBODY who appreciates a good steak. Although it was served medium rare as I ordered. However, the flavor was sadly lacking. Definitely not worth the supplemental cost.Salmon: My mom had the salmon, smart woman. To think I teased her for ordering fish at a steakhouse!!Winner of the table (how sad is that in a steakhouse?) Well seasoned, flaky and delicate to taste. Really excellent. Beautifully plated.Dessert: Bourbon Pecan Pie. Meh.All in all, I won't be frequenting S&W when I get the hankering for a steak.",1,0,0,Tarita H.,"Canarsie, Brooklyn, NY",23,151,141

Came here with a group of 10 gentlemen for a small birthday get together. Food was excellent, atmosphere was also great. The reason for my one star rating is due strictly to the behavior of our waiter. The tip was automatically included in any check that contains a party of 6 or more. Thus, a generous tip was left, I signed the check and proceeded to leave the establishment. The waiter chased me out of the restaurant holding the bill up high while waving it around, as if my card was declined or something more serious!

1.0,10/6/2016,"I don't really write reviews but I felt the need to after a very unpleasant experience at the restaurant that left me and my family feeling embarrassed and upset. The food was decent but the 1 star rating is for how the staff handled our situation. At the end of the meal we asked to split the check onto two cards. After leaving the restaurant, the server runs after my sister saying that he needed to charge again on one of the two cards because he only swiped one card. But checking my credit card account immediately, he had swiped both charges onto my card which means I have paid for the meal in total. The two pending charges on my account was shown to the server but he persistently said that he only swiped the card once and that he still needs to swipe the other. So now I, who was already on my way home, had to turn back around and go back to the restaurant. The worst part about all this, is how the staff were loudly talking amongst themselves saying how my family is trying to cheat and not pay for a meal while it was the SERVER'S FAULT for swiping both charges onto the same card! Unbelievable! I am a paying customer who has paid for the meal in full. Why can't we just leave both charges onto the same card? A manager was called and after understanding the situation, the server continued to disagree with the manager. At the end, the manager apologized and the charges were kept on one card. It was a waste of time for my family and left us feeling embarrassed in front of the whole restaurant. And not to mention, our server made us feel obligated to order 2 prime rib steaks because he had supposedly held them for us after asking him to check if there were any left. As a dining customer, we have a choice to change our minds.

But it was dark in there and I didn't have my glasses, so I'll have to take the eventual responsibility. The wine came to $31 a glass! My glass was short-filled. To boot, it was a nothing wine.  I take the responsibility but he might have mentioned a couple of choices and prices. Not very friendly.  Other waiter was Asian and very good.  Tony, on the ""less than friendly"" side.  He beat me for about $30 bucks, but instead of 20 pct. tip, I dropped it to 15%.  We are regulars and the place is good but not great.  Will try another place next week.

If you come here for a special occasion, you will definitely feel taken care of. The food was also really good and perfectly timed - something I'm a stickler for. The eh:We felt that the Restaurant Week deal totally was great, but would never pay full price for what we ordered. The steaks were good, but not $50 good. I would tell people curious about S&W to wait until next Restaurant Week to try it out. The steaks also do not come with sides, which is just a bit weird when it comes to presentation. Once the sides we ordered arrived though, all was good.  The ugly:We (boyfriend and I) are in our young 20's and made a reservation. We were dressed in business casual. Upon arrival, we were sat in this back corner with anyone who was not a mid 50's white male. I'm not kidding - it was a fun cultural melting pot in this back corner, but everywhere else was as waspy as ever. Not that I wanted to sit next to all those old men, but it upset me that a restaurant could so obviously separate people like that.  Not cool.

3.0,8/13/2016,"Not exactly an ideal dining experience, considering the cost. I can only speak for the upstairs dining area, but I found there to be very little ambiance, considering the price tag. Of course the food was good, but given the setting (which felt like a temporary arrangement while construction was being completed), I wouldn't place this any higher than a 3. Additionally, for a Wednesday night, it was extremely loud,  felt panicky hectic and not, how i feel, a steakhouse should feel. It was restaurant week, so it is understandable to be more crazy than usual, but it didn't feel relaxed at all. Again, perhaps because of restaurant week, the clientele was not what I expected. Young women in crop tops and shorts, young kids that were clearly post-day camp, the feel was just not what I was ready for, nor what I paid for.The waiter was there to take our order, not engage otherwise.

I did not enjoy the steak very much maybe cuz it is RW they lower their food quality. Beside, there is a rude waiter, not the one serving our table.

They mixed the RW people with the regulars and we had a celebrity, at least in the financial world at his reserved table next to us giving us tidbits of what's good and according to him that's everything.We had the RW lunch menu in front of us and a side menu with specials not normally listed for lunch or dinner like Scallops.  I ordered the Split Pea Soup, and the the Roast Beef Hash for two reasons,;1)  I didn't want to do steak like most people.2)  There was no Yelp photo of the hash, yeah, I'm looking out for you all !!!,I also got the Bourbon Pecan Pie, so we got 3 curse meal for $29 that they didn't substitute skimpy servings we got full size.The assorted bread basket for starters is real good and at first I thought the bread was on top of a brown paper but it turns out it was a thin flat crisp bread like tortilla chips under the bread. The bread is served with a small cup of whipped butter.First came my Split Pea Soup with a few croutons in it. It was like home made Split Pea Soup it was smooth and delicious. after that came my  Roast Beef Hash, It comes with Egg Benedict and a Hollandaise sauce on top and it was a lot of food on the plate. The server wanted to mix it up for me and put some tomato or hot sauce on it but I had to shoe him away since I want my photos and not show a plate of mush on Yelp.  The hash is crispy on the outer edges and the eggs bleeds when cut.  This was good but it was too much for me to eat and I had dessert coming so I left a lot.One thing that blew my mind was when thew mains came they took the bread away and my buddy had to ask for her butted pieces back, what's behind removing the bread, I don't know?. By buddy ordered the Filet Mignon as her main and said it was perfect.My thin crust Bourbon Pecan Pie came with some house whipped cream that enhance the flavor even more, and I was scrapping the plate on this one.

However, there were a lot of issues with our dining experience.  First of all, the salad was TERRIBLE, the dressing was sour, the lettuce was limp and bruised, and had no garnish, it was just salad and cheap-tasting dressing.  Secondly, the service was great up until we finished our salads.  We tried getting the attention of our waiter who flat out ignored us on several occasions.  After we finally asked for water, he promised to return immediately but it never came.  During our dessert course we asked for water again and the same thing happened.  The service after the first course was really bad.

One of the menu items changed from what we saw online but no problem. Why only 2 stars? The bread they served us was ROCK HARD. Like, bang it on the table hard. The waiter kept flirting with my friend (not an issue, but he was overdoing it) and as a result, kept messing up our order. He gave her my salad and gave me her calamari. Calamari looked frozen and my salad was overdressed. It wasn't until our food came that we realized we forgot to order sides, but again, since the waiter was flirting so hard, he never attempted the up-sell. So we had just steak and lobster ($10 supplement). Unlike other steakhouses, they didn't shell the lobster tail for us. The worst part.... most offensive for a steakhouse.... they gave me the wrong steak. I ordered mine medium and my friend medium well. I thought mine was a little overdone, and as we got closer to the centers of our steaks that we realized that again, they switched our orders. Honestly, it didn't even taste like they seasoned it. This has never happened at an well-known steakhouse before and I was definitely disappointed. Friend had the coconut cake which was more icing inside than cake.

I started with a salad which was a nice portion and it was good, but I mean it's hard to mess up a salad. My brother had the fried calamari which was OK at best, seemed a little soggy so it appears they probably prepare a bunch and it sits around a little. Next, I had the filet which was a generous size and perfectly cooked... But it was just bland. I hate to alter my dishes in anyway at all because I feel like they should be eaten as served but this filet definitely needed some salt and pepper to bring out the flavor.

It feels old school yet refined. For appetizers, we each got a salad. My caesar salad was the perfect portion to start a meal and was delicious. The bread that came to the table was also enjoyable - I enjoyed the different choices. For entrees, my girlfriend got the Filet Mignon. This was a 10 oz steak and absolutely delicious. I paid the extra $10 to get the 14 oz dry aged sirloin. It was very good, but I actually thought the filet was better. We ordered a side of whipped potatoes, which were very good. While I expected this to be the case, I think it would be helpful to have listed on their restaurant week menu that sides are not included - you are just going to get steak if you do not pay extra and get sides. I did not mind doing this, but I could see where it would be confusing.For dessert, I had the cheesecake, which was good but nothing crazy. My girlfriend got the Vanilla Coconut cake. I don't even like coconut but can admit that that cake was absolutely delicious.Our service throughout the evening was top notch.

The chocolate was so rich and decadent.Service: The table situation was quite awkward because the position forced the waiter to lean over my coworkers making it quite uncomfortable.

4.0,8/2/2016,"came here for restaurant week based on it being highly recommended. had reservations but came half an hour early and was seated by a hostess early with no problems. the RW menu was on the table when we sat down, but a waiter came a few minutes later to give us the regular menu anyways. he didn't seem quiet happy that we were ordering off the RW menu, but I'm here for the food, and I read in many previous reviews that the service for RW wasn't top notch anyways. We both got a red and a white glass of wine to start. I did notice  that other tables got a bread basket, and we didn't. the calamari and a Cesar salad our appetizer. I got the filet mignon and my friend got the 14 oz dry aged sirloin. Both were cooked to perfection and I have to say, the 14 oz dry aged was amazing. was definitely worth the extra 10$ add on and will probably be my choice next time I come back. I got the coconut layer cake and my friend the chocolate mousse. Good, but we were both stuffed that we did not finish. However, my second server of the night was SUCHA sweetheart!! He was super nice and most definitely did not give my table a bias against us eating off the RW menu, so super thankful for that and he made the experience of eating here great.  will most definitely be returning, even if the service won't be as great as it was last night.",1,0,0,Lisa T.,"New York, NY",55,144,894

5.0,7/26/2016,"Without a doubt, Smith & Wollesnky is my top choice for Restaurant Week. Since the winter edition of the event in 2015, I dine here on multiple occasions each Restaurant Week because different friends always want to go. Among the best of the best steakhouses in New York I have tried (Peter Luger's, Del Friscos, Wolfgangs), Smith & Wollensky is the only one that participates in Restaurant Week. In my opinion, it is the best deal because they do not cut back on portion size for the event. For appetizers, I always go with the New England Clam Chowder or fried calamari. The chowder is very good. The calamari is excellent. Of course, I mainly go to Smith & Wollensky for the steak. The filet mignon (10 oz.) is plenty of meat. If you want a little bit more, you can upgrade to a 14 oz. Dry-Aged Sirloin for an extra $10. I normally go for the sirloin. Both cuts are top notch cuts of steak that are usually cooked perfectly with a nice char on the outside but tender in the inside. In addition to the sirloin having more meat, I prefer the sirloin a little more in taste too. It will be difficult but try to save room for dessert. It is stellar as well. The pecan pie is as good as any pie I have eaten anywhere. The chocolate mousse cake is excellent too. From the appetizer through dessert, you receive top notch quality.If you are looking for places to try for Restaurant Week,  feel free to message me through Yelp and I can share my person list, which includes my Yelp reviews.

3.0,6/25/2016,"If this were an average-priced restaurant, I would have given a 4+ overall star rating but I must state that because the price point is so high, so were my expectations and this is reflected in my review. Also, pretty much in line with other steakhouses in town, S&W is an old school ""boys club"" establishment with a butcher coat-clad, all-male wait staff and a mostly-(older)male clientele. Although the staff were very kind to me during my visit, this isn't a place I would necessarily recommend for a ladies night out. Onto the review...Following a very user-friendly website feature, I made an online reservation about two weeks in advance for dinner for two at 7 pm on a Sunday. My dad and I found ourselves hungry about 90 minutes early and decided to see if the restaurant would be able to accommodate us. The host greeted us and happily honored our reservation (apparently, the earlier the better in NYC!). We were escorted to an upstairs dining area and promptly seated. Our waiter quickly greeted us and was very knowledgable about the menu, describing dishes and pointing out featured items. I've dined at dozens of steakhouses across the country and one thing they all have in common is that wait staff fervently push the bone-in steak cuts. While they are touted to be more tender and more flavorful, I've found the regular boneless cuts to be absolutely wonderful and $10-$12 cheaper. Plus, I doubt the average diner would really be able to discern much of a difference. My tip: skip the upsale and stick with a regular cut.I started with a traditional Manhattan for my cocktail, which was sublime. A complimentary basket of a variety of bread items is delivered upon seating, and was absolutely delicious. My dad and I ordered the shrimp cocktail and crab cake to share as starters, and both ordered the filets with a side of creamed spinach to share. The shrimp were superb--huge, plump, and succulent, and the crab cake was one of the best I've ever tried! It was a very generous portion packed with lump crab meat and very little ""filler"" served with a tasty remoulade sauce and a pickled cucumber garnish. Highly recommended. The filets were tender and cooked to my requested temperature, but were a bit under seasoned and sadly served lukewarm, and the spinach was just average, and again lukewarm. Since this was my first time at S&W, I'm not sure if this was par for the course here, or just an unfortunate aberration, but I had to take some points away because I expect a phenomenal flawless steak and creamed spinach in a NYC steakhouse with this kind of price point. I had their coconut cake for dessert, which was light, fluffy, and delicious. This, paired with their house Irish coffee, was a wonderful end to my meal. While there were no real utter disappointments to my experience (the steak was still good), in a city packed with amazing steakhouses, the bar is set high. My suggestion for a night out in NYC--hit S&W early for cocktails and appetizers (the crab cake is a must!), or for dessert and a night cap, but consider making a reservation at a different steakhouse for dinner.",2,0,1,Jenny L.,"Boise, ID",1,23,1

2.0,6/6/2016,"My girlfriend and I arrived at exactly 8pm for our 8pm reservation on Sunday May 29th.  We were ""greeted"" by three hostesses who confirmed my reservation.  One bluntly stated that our table was not ready and that we could go wait at the bar.  No apology, no explanation, and no time-frame as to when our table would be ready.  My girlfriend and I did not say anything and went to the small bar area, which did not have seating available.  I waited ten minutes before approaching the hostess stand where the three girls were chatting about their personal lives.  Now 8:10pm, I asked when the table would be ready for our 8pm reservation.  One hostess stopped chatting with the other long enough to say ""Oh I was just about to come get you.""  That so, I thought to myself.  So I went to the bar and retrieved my girlfriend.  The hostess with the long, black, greasy hair showed us to our table.  She seated my girlfriend and I without uttering a single word, then walked away.  On our way out of the restaurant after dinner, none of the hostesses said anything.  Not that it should matter, but my girlfriend and I are clean cut, well-mannered individuals and certainly didn't provoke any level of insolence from a gaggling group of imbecilic hostesses.  It's a shame I had to write this review.  I might have let it go if it weren't my girlfriend's birthday dinner.  The food was excellent and the all-male wait staff was courteous and attentive.  My recommendation to this New York City landmark steakhouse would be to fire the three little girls you had operating your hostess stand that day and replace them with a single member of your well-mannered wait staff.",4,1,0,Mike R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,21,0

As someone has eaten at multiple locations. S&W has been consistent. I have never had a bad meal at any location including this one in midtown. Are there better steaks and steakhouses in Manhattan?! My opinion yes! But if you go to a del friscos or Peter lugers or a Mortons. There all quite loud. I'm not recommending you taking a date to a steakhouse. But it's nice to come to S&W drink some scotch, the lady has some wine and you can actually have a conversation. S&W is laid out differently than the other steakhouses. Which makes it more private. The menu is the same at every S&W I have been to. Mostly steak some seafood. I usually get the filet mignon or the rib eye. But I will tell you. I love there Mac and cheese $14 gets you some great Mac and cheese. Sometimes on my way to the Rangers game from uptown I will stop here grab a single malt and a Mac and cheese ( I can only eat half) and then head to the game. I will say the service is very good here. They are attentive. Price wise they are competitive with other chain steakhouses in the city. I do recommend making reservations here any day of the week! Reservations on the weekend are a must!!! And should be made 1 week in advance. But I also have walked in on a Tuesday night at 7 and they had a table available.Overall.

The service was very good but not so much for the food.  The Littleneck clams were fine.  We both ordered the Classic 26oz prime rib, well done.  Mine arrived slightly overcooked (no pink & a bit dry) but still fine.  My wife's arrived medium.  We never, never, never send food back but this was an exception.  No way would she be able to eat it.  She gets it back and it's charred on both sides.  Not wanting to make a deal about it given the circumstances she eats it.  The baked potato with all the topping options was very good.  The sautéed spinach had no favor.  The desserts were a big let-down.  I had the cheesecake and while decent certainly not a knock-out I had hoped for, just average.  My wife ordered the carrot cake and did not like it and I thought it was too dry.   She works in a hospital and the one she gets in the lobby blows S&W's away.  The wine we selected was fine.  Kind of irks me the $55.00 bottle cost $12.00 in liquor stores but then I realize that's no way to judge these steak houses because everything else is severely overpriced.  It was a letdown for what was supposed to be a nice date.  So in conclusion I don't trust Smith & Wollensky's to go there again and dropped another $280.00.  I'll try another place.",0,0,0,James D.,"East Rutherford, NJ",0,33,2

And there sits, ""Ms. Fung"", as she called herself (does she not have first name? This is the first time a server, wait staff and etc introduced themselves as Mr. /Ms. something. Isn't is normal to address oneself with first name in service industry?), who clearly does not speak much English, says ""check pocket"".  We explained to her that it's not that we can't find the tag but that we dropped it between two fixed furnitures by mistake. She kept saying, ""check pocket"".  When we repeatedly explained to her that it is NOT in our pocket, she waved her hand to us in dismissive way and said, ""go get it!"" in a broken English. This is when our party member, who happened to be an Asian so this is not a case of us being racists, got frustrated and asked for a manager.  And a young lady, whose first name starts with C (well, at least she gave us her first name), claimed that she is the manager, told us that Ms. Fung is just doing her job, and it is what it is.  Which we replied that we are not even upset with ""Ms. Fung"" not giving us the coat, but rather that she cannot communicate with us and that she shooed us away rudely saying ""go get it!"".If this was your local Panda Express, we would've laughed it away. But we just spent $150 each at S&W for a service person that cannot even communicate in an appropriate way?  And the self proclaimed manager in her mid 20s, who also clearly didn't have much experience, rather choose to offend our party than to admit that ""Ms. Fung"" is an inappropriate choice for a service staff. I've been dining in NYC for over ten years, and this is the first time I'm writing a negative review, which shows how frustrated we were with the service at S&W tonight. Unless they make some change to their service staffs, or at least provide better education, S&W will be losing return customers like our group very soon.",4,8,3,Frank O.,"Englewood Cliffs, NJ",1,13,0
2.0,3/25/2016,For such a famous place I was expecting an excellent dinner with a great environment. I was celebrating my friend's birthday so there were four of us. We were seated in an extremely tight booth with hardly space to sit. I said nothing because I didn't want to ruin the evening. The food was ok but ruined by the fact that I couldn't move. The waiter was nice so I gave this place two stars but I would never go back there. Over priced and probably for tourists that come once only.

Calamari was good. They order porter house and I had scallop. For the side dishes we had spinach and hash potato. They said the hash potato is really good but it's okay. The coconut cake I must say is really good. (They gave it to us for free because we celebrating bday). We had also bottle of wine so the average is about 100 ppl.

My review is based only on my overall experience with their service and food. I noticed as I entered that this place is pretty busy, but then again it was prime dinner time. I informed the nice hosts who I was here for and was escorted to the second floor to one of their private rooms. Their private room was pretty nice, we received quick service and the entire staff who catered to us was very attentive. The room was equipped with a projection system, sound system and a podium with a Smith & Wollensky sign. Each table seating had a printed single page menu of options to choose from again I can only review on what options we were only provided.Appetizer options: Mixed Green Salad or Maryland Crab Cake I had no choice but to go with the Mixed Green Salad since I have a shellfish allergy. The salad was just ok I only took a few bites-too much dressing for my liking.Entree options: Filet Mignon, Veal Chop, Seared Scottish Salmon I went with the Filet Mignon of course and it was really good, cooked perfectly to my liking and a large portion.Side options on our table were Creamed Spinach and Broccoli; both were very good. I kept taking second helpings of the Creamed Spinach, I wasn't even hungry but couldn't help myself it was that good.Dessert options: Cheesecake, Chocolate Mousse Cake or Coconut Layer Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream of course I went with the Cheesecake and I loved every bit of it.All in all it was a great night and I would definitely return as a regular customer.",9,5,7,Orla M.,"Long Island, NY",613,308,3950

It sounded desperate, like a car salesman. Steaks tasted fine.  Colorado rib eye is nothing special. I would give it a solid B+.

1.0,2/21/2016,"The food was great, the reason for the one star is what you will read here:Went for RW menu on 1/29/2016 and it was very good, we had our table on the main floor and knew what we wanted to eat. We enjoyed the food and service.Since their RW menu and price suited us, we decided to come with our 4 children on the following week. We booked a table for six for Friday, February 5th at 3pm. The booking was made a week in advance, after making sure with the person in the front desk until what time they serve lunch.On Friday (day of our booked reservation) at 12 noon I received a call from the restaurant telling me that if we are planning to order from the RW menu, 3pm is too late for lunch and the latest time is 2:30pm and that the restaurant is over booked, so they can't offer us a table for 2:30. I was so surprised as I had the confirmation for a week. The lady from the restaurant said that the table is still ours at 3, but only if we order from the regular menu.So the table is available but they wont honor the RW menu....Hypocrites!! I asked to speak with a manager and she transferred me to Martin. He had the same answer, we are welcome to come at 3 but only for the full menu.I was angry and frustrated, as they waited a week to call me and did it 2 and a half hours before the time of the reservation!!!I was arguing with Martin, so he was really ""generous"" and offered us a complimentary drink with the full menu... all my kids are under 21!!! (or maybe it was for a soda...)There was no place, not on their website, not on RW website and not at the restaurant saying that last reservation for RW menu is at 2:30!!!I ended my call by Martin repeating his offer to keep the table for us at 3pm. I was making phone calls to find a different restaurant for lunch on the last day of RW!!! I finally found a table at TAO uptown (which was great!) I didn't expect this insulting treatment  from a restaurant of this scale.

( However) When our steaks came out the inside of my husbands filet and my sirloin steak were too purple and had to be sent back when we ordered medium to begin with. My wtf moment was when I saw a waiter with a blood stained white coat counting his large roll of tips while standing in the middle of our section of tables. As we finished our dinner I had to ask an available waiter to refill our waters because most of the waiters were only attentive to what seemed to be a select few rather than everyone in our section. I'd rate our overall experience a C-. We thought our experience would be nicer given all the hype of this restaurant. At least the doorman was cool and went out of his way to hail a cab for us!

We asked for Medium and the steak came out so rare that we had to take some of it home so we can cook the rest in an oven. Our waiter was very rude and passed us off to another waiter who didn't say one word to us the entire time just collected dishes and forks off the table while we were eating.

Yes, the upstairs tables can get a bit cramped depending on where you are, but they are still actual tables with linen on them. so it was ok. the waiter that we had was amusing since every time I told him what I wanted for each course he nodded in a gentlemanly way indicating that I had made an excellent choice. There's a reason people go to steakhouses for business meals since you can expect the meats, seafood, desserts and drinks and service to be excellent. That was the case here. the chowder was hearty, the crab cakes were indeed meaty, the lobster tail and steak juicy and service was very good. I'm also not typically a dessert person but the coconut layer cake here is pretty amazing. not nauseatingly sweet or heavy, but with the right amount of sweetness and tartness. the ice cream on the side is a nice touch as well. the upstairs set-up here is more like eating in someone's home (downstairs is more refined and obviously more for the big hitters but it is also kinda homely) so it is a bit different than other steak houses that are more modern. overall, great deal and great restaurant week experience.",0,0,0,Peter M.,"Fort Lee, NJ",270,414,887

First of all, all the rw people get herded into an room upstairs segregated from all the other guests.  Then instead of having one designated server, we were bounced between a couple servers who would repeat the same questions.  For appetizers, we ordered clam chowder and calamari, which we were satisfied with. Then came our steaks. My friends ordered a filet and sirloin, and I ordered the surf of turf.  We all ordered medium rare steaks and they all came out overcooked with no hint of redness to them.  (See pic, which actually look pinker than the steak actually is.  With the naked eye, the steaks looked even more brown.). When the server came to ask how everything was, we bought it to his attention. First he told me to cut my steak in the center to show him, when I did that he said ""oh maybe it's the lighting."" Then he asked me to taste it first.  lol, yeah okay buddy you know it's over cooked with all these excuses. The lobster that came as part of my entree was also terrible. The texture was so mushy that I wandered how long it has been dead. It pretty much ""melts in your mouth."" (Though that's not a good thing when it comes to lobsters.) Disappointing.  We also ordered the oyster mushroom side, which was yum.

The waiter was probably not the bubbliest person but he was attentive to our needs and courteous- he even stuck something under the table leg to balance it out since it was wobbly. On to the food... we went with the RW menu and chose the split pea soup and fried calamari as apps, the surf and turf (Filet mignon and lobster tail) for main course and coconut cake for dessert. The apps were pretty good, just wish the calamari would've been more crispier but it wasn't bad and split pea soup was thick and creamy, just the way I like my soups. The lobster tail was deliciously seasoned and the steak wasn't bursting with flavor- I prefer not to use steak sauce- but it was tender and cooked well. We thought we might need a side before the food arrived but figured that with the apps we would be okay and we were- we would've been too stuffed if we ordered a side.

I wasn't in the mood for meat so I asked for the lemmon pepper chicken and the jumbo asparagus. They were truly humongous! The whole chicken... I couldn't eat even the half of it.

4.0,12/31/2015,"The porterhouse for two tasted great. I didn't feel beat on the filet mignon. The meat was less fatty than strip house. In my opinion the steak was as good as Wolfgang's. The lobster appetizer was a nice portion and their green butter sauce was terrific. There was a bit of wait time between the appetizer and the steak, and between the steak and the dessert. Not to be unladylike, but since this is pretty much my only leisure activity, I like to be shoving food in my mouth in a constant motion. To be fair, it's New Year's Eve so wait staff is busy. The Mac and cheese had a strong cheese taste (which I love) and the creamed spinach was to die for. The cosmopolitan was too strong so I sent it back. The second one was strong as well but not as bitter. The peanut butter and cheese layer cake is very good but the red sauce underneath it isn't necessary. The PB/chocolate flow can stand alone.

Two of the guys with me also had terrible steaks. One of the guys ordered a filet cooked medium, but it came out very rare, and stayed that way even after it was sent back for additional cooking. Another steak was also flavorless, with little seasoning. The sides (mashed potatoes, brussels sprouts, creamed spinach) were pretty awful too.

Lackluster service and lackluster food (minus the coconut cake) for a thoroughly lackluster--and forgettable--experience. I get that RW diners, like Groupon holders, are considered the scum of the earth by the restaurants that begrudgingly participate in these promotions, but most places can at least pull a Regina George and be nice to your face while they mock you behind your back. They just didn't even try at Smith & Wollensky. We encountered snotty attitude from beginning to end. Coupled with limp, almost rotting salads and well-burnt-masquerading-as-medium-rare filet mignon, and I kept wondering what the heck we were doing here.

We were ignored for a good 10 minutes before we were greeted with cold bread. Drinks were good, not comparable for the price. We got burrata and tomatoes, it was okay, lacked dressing and real taste.

So we made reservations and it was a block away from the Residence Inn. We were seated upom arrival. It was a full house as it was Thanksgiving. We sat and waited for a good 15 minutes with no host or waiter coming by to check on us, not evem for water or drinks. Needless to say, we had to pull the host when he walked pass our table. They apologized  and promised service would be improved from that point on. It was somewhat improved, but it felt awkward with our waiter as he seemed a bit ticked that we had said something. He did apologize but the servcie itself wasn't worth what we paid for in the meal. We've been to quite a few dining establishments during the week and all have been impeccable. But to pay the $$$ for this restaurant wasn't what we expected. Overall the food was great, especially the seafood bouquet-- fresh crab and lobster, and jumbo shrimp. My husband had the sirloin with bone in and I had the scottish salmon. All were tasty and fresh. The sides were enough to share between us and the kids.

1.0,11/23/2015,"So let me preface this review by saying that before I this experience I considered smith and wollensky's one of my favorite restaurants and even had my birthday dinner there.I showed up about 15 minutes late for a 7:30 reservation for 2 but was quickly seated by the host who was very nice. My girlfriend and I were sat in a back corner which was my first time sitting on this side of the restaurant ""cool"" I thought.After about 10 minutes of not being greeted by anyone, no menus and no water I asked one of the servers if I could see a menu and for a glass of water. He tells me that our waiter will be with us soon and he will get us water. 10 minutes later our waiter comes over, still no water. At this point we already know what we want, are starving and just want to eat. I order the Colorado medium well and my girlfriend orders the chicken. We also ordered a potato. During the long wait nobody checked on us, our drinks weren't refilled a single time, and when I asked one of servers for a refill on my water he told me ""it's not really his job, but he doesn't see why not"". I was getting really pissed about the horrible service but just kept reminding myself that I love the food.My steak comes out and after cutting into it one look told me it was clearly medium rare. I showed the waiter, they tell me ""oops"" say it was a mistake and they bring me a different steak right away. The steak they replaced mine with was RARE. I don't even need to cut into it to tell. I show the waiter, he prods it with a fork, confirms its rare and takes it away. I pick at my girlfriends chicken while just waiting for my steak. During the wait my water was never refilled and we were never checked on.About 15 minute later my original steak(that I cut into) was brought back to me, without being rested and told it was medium well now. I cut into it and it's still bloody, and clearly medium(if not still pretty rare"". I eat about half the steak, am livid at this point and just take it home to heat up by myself. Took about 10 minutes to get our waiters attention to pack everything up, he never asked us how everything was because he knew it was awful and didn't seem to care at all.Up until yesterday I loved this place but I can honestly say this was my worst dining experience ever. I will never come back and would so much rather spend my money where it's appreciated.P.s.

You expect when the steaks are 50-60 dollars and everything is al la cartel you'd get some respect and great service. Anyways we get in and get waiter Tony D server number 67. Right off the bat he's pushy. He gives us 60 seconds to look at the menu, we are not ready. Then comes back every 60 seconds to ask if we are ready to order. This happened half a dozen times. It was annoying. The restaurant wasn't packed either. It was 10pm. Next I order a martini. He doesn't even ask how I like it before going on and taking everyone else's drinks. Luckily he brought it back the way I enjoy but I needed to ask him to run to the back to bring olives. He comes back to the table and my Mother orders the chicken, he literally tells her it's terrible and has her get the filet which is 30 dollars more. ""The chicken has bones in it, you don't want that, get the filet.""We get our food and the order is messed up. They bring two salads when we ordered one. I ordered the 18oz sirloin and they brought the 12oz. We get the check. My mother ordered 1 glass of Pinot and instead the rang us up for the entire bottle. Our first bill was 197, the second 262 and finally the third was 228. I have no idea what was going on but at this point we just wanted to leave. Back to the wine, honest mistake, right? I don't think so. The guy came to the table and told us my Dads drink was on the house. I think he did this to distract us from the the incorrect items on the bill expecting us to just pay.

1.0,11/4/2015,"I'm not sure what these other reviewers had for dinner, but this Smith & Wollensky is anything but a 4 star restaurant. I say this with all sincerity, this place isn't on the same level as Longhorn Steakhouse, let alone any top steakhouse in the country. I've eaten at S & W in Miami on countless occasions, and assumed that we would experience something similar at this one. Not so fast. The night got off to a bad start when our waiter, Ping, assumed that we had never had filet mignon. Now, I'm never one to play the race card, but both my friend and I felt as though our ethnicity and laid back attitude gave off the impression that we had never experienced fine dining. From there, it only got worse. I ended up ordering the lamb chops (medium) with macaroni & cheese, while my friend ordered a medium Cajun filet mignon with asparagus. Not sure who the cook was, but I'm confident I could have prepared a better steak and lamb chops. The steak came out extremely well done and my lamb chops had absolutely no seasoning/flavor to them. Terrible. Making it worse, the macaroni was burned and the asparagus came out completely dry. Not only was the food bland, but the waiter NEVER even once came to our table and asked us how our meal was or whether we needed anything further. Instead, he proceeded to stand off to side and watch the television at the bar. In fact, on two separate occasions I had to send other waiters to get our waiter. So, as you can imagine, when the $131 check came out, I left him a tip of $9 and a lengthy note explaining our dissatisfaction with the service we received that night. I'm not sure who manages this place, but he or she may want to reevaluate their staff for Tuesday evening.

Its a little pricier than what Im accustomed to paying for a porterhouse, and it wasnt as big as its advertized (44 oz). But the steak here was definately of high quality. I would compare it to the porterhouse of places like Bobby Vans and Michael Jordans steakhouse. The Mac and Cheese definately stood out. It wasnt made with the usual cheddar cheese (thank god). They used two other cheeses, which really gave the taste a twist; it almost felt like I was eating pasta. Reminded me a little of the mac and cheese at Capital Grille.     Now for my favorite part of this experience, the dessert. Im grateful that I went with the recommendation of others here on Yelp. Wow!!!! Holy F*#k!!!! Dam was that coconut cake good!!! First of all, the size was enormous. But it wasnt simply a slice of cake; it was soaked in something that made it feel like I was eating a ""Tres Leche"" cake. Then you have the scoop of ice cream that couldnt have complimented it any better. Wish i had ordered two.     Overall, the decor was absolutely elegant. The noise level was minimal.

4.0,9/22/2015,"We came for late evening drinks and a little something to eat. The service and ambience is great - just a lot of personality and feels like a NY steak place. Had the chilled lobster first, that we all shared . Delicious and fresh. Could have eaten the whole thing myself. Had the surf and turf (half a lobster roll and half a horseshoe roll , which is like a philly cheese steak) I enjoyed the lobster roll, but it was a little heavy on the mayo for my taste. The philly cheesesteak isn't really my fave thing anyway, but it was good. I would have been happier with a whole lobster roll instead of the surf and turf, but when you can't make up your mind, its a good way to go. I prefer Del Friscos for the food, but they don't compare with the ambience at S&W.

Although the tuna was very fresh that was all it really had to offer, I've had better. For dinner, I had the filet mignon, he had the Cajun Marinated Rib Steak. His was WAY better than mine but both outstanding. At first I wasn't impressed with the seasons that they had mentioned I could add on mine because they said they would be very spicy. I do not like anything that is spicy but I do like a little big of flavor. My steak was very tender but didn't have much of a flavor. I wish I had gotten the Cajun seasoning added on. We also had ordered a side of mash potatoes which was out of this world. They were very tasteful. The staff could have been a bit more attentive.

My mother ordered the halibut, which I believe was a seasonal menu item. She wasn't very pleased. She said the fish was way over cooked, and this is coming from a woman who likes everything very well done. I'm assuming this was a fluke because everything else was excellent!

Thank goodness they gave me half a lemon to tone it down. I ordered my filet mignon  medium rare, but it was bordering medium with barely any red/pink left in the center. The lady next to our table ordered her steak medium and it came out very bloody red. How can a steakhouse not do steak right??? My boyfriend's lump crab cakes were divine. They were all lump meat and barely any filler. Dessert is always the best part in my opinion. The bourbon pecan pie was sweet and flavorful and my coconut cake was moist and fluffy.

The place was very busy so I wasn't much bothered. Once we were seated we very quickly received a heaping bowl of assorted bread. (There is a cracker-like flatbread that is made on the premises and is very interesting). We ordered clam chowder and a caesar salad for the appetizers and they came out pretty quickly. I was surprised at how large the portion sizes were. The clam chowder was mild but tasty. Very soon after we finished our appetizers they were cleared away and our entrées were brought out. I ordered the crabcakes and was delighted to see how massive they were... and even more delighted when I pulled one apart with my fork and saw it was almost entirely crab meat. There was just barely enough filler to keep it held together. My friend's 10oz filet mignon was tender and flavorful, medium rare with a crispy outside. We were both somewhat shocked at how it was even possible they were profiting off of the $25 price, since the portions were not small and the quality so good  I was so full I only ate one of the two crab cakes. Our waiter seemed to sense we were in a hurry and very quickly brought out a box and our desserts. My friend and I both ate only a few bites of our dessert from being so stuffed.

It had a crispy sear on the outside yet still rare & juicy in the center but wasn't overcooked (which is hard to do). She got the burger with cheddar cheese. The fries were on point: crispy, salty & NOT greasy. We also split a mac & cheese which was creamy, gooey & cheesy. They use shell pasta which I love because it cradles the cheese inside the shell like a pearl in an oyster. You get a burst of cheesy goodness explosion when you bite down. They use gouda cheese & finish it off with parmesan on top with gets crispy. Now we're ready for dessert (although idk how we have room). I got the Bourbon Pecan Pie & it was phenomenal. I'd return just for pie only! She got the Chocolate Mousse Cake which the waiter recommended & it was good but I probably wouldn't order it again.At the beginning of our meal the couple sitting next to us knocked over their glass oil container & it shattered on the floor.

When dessert time came around our waiter said to order whatever we wanted it was complimentary. We thought that was very nice of them but unnecessary. We didn't wanna be rude so we ordered dessert ;). I got a sweet tooth I never say no to food especially sweets. As we were finishing our desserts we waved down the waiter to ask for the check & he told us it was taken care of already. We were both in shock. I jokingly said I'll take a prime rib & mac & cheese to go if that's the case. Nonetheless the situation with the glass & oil was NOT their fault at all. They were not held accountable for the couples action or accident. Besides the food being delicious & on point the service & customer appreciation went above & beyond.

My wife had the prime rib, which was nearly as large. Fortunately our two kids helped us finished them both off.I'm a huge fan of rib eye and the Colorado did not disappoint.

The hash browns were excellent, and my daughter loved the huge bowl of mac n cheese, but the whipped potatoes were merely average (for a side that costs as much as an entree at some restaurants I expected something special).I was stuffed after the steaks, but still tried a slice of the coconut cake, which lived up to it's excellent reputation.

The service was absolutely perfect from when we walked in till we left. The waiter was always checking how we were doing and was very knowledgeable with all the questions my cowrkers had. To sure we had the seaford platter for 4 which was so delicious. Actually this was the highlight to me instead of the steak. I ordered the 10 oz Filet mignon, creamed spinach and has browns.

However, it was by the service door so waiters kept walking past us and bumping into the table. We asked to be reseated to a different table and they quickly obliged. They apologized over and over again and although it wasn't a big deal in the first place- it was very nice that they catered to our needs and apologized. Onto the food: it was amazing! My fiance and I have been to many steak houses and this one topped it completely. I can't remember everything we had but we ordered some seafood appetizers and steak. The seafood was incredibly fresh and prepared very well. The steaks were exceptional and cooked exactly how we wanted them. We ordered some sides too and they were very tasty as well. The desserts (carrot cake and the chocolate cake) were very moist and flavorful. I believe our waiter's name was Tony. He was so nice and helpful. We did notice that at around 9:30 there was much less people there so if you don't mind a late dinner and like a little more quiet that's the time you should go.Perfect food, nice decor, and very friendly staff.",0,0,0,Ilona T.,"Staten Island, NY",196,39,2
4.0,5/17/2015,"I had a piece a prime rib that made me put down the fork.  Smith & Wollensky (NYC) is a true old school steak house.  Everyone that works there looks like they have been around for at least a two decades.  Except the nice looking young ladies at the front.  :-)  The by the glass wine list was at best so so, definitely could have been better.  I was impressed that they had international selections by the glass, however they could have selected a higher quality of wines for the prices they were charging.  Seemingly they had the low end international selections.  Now since I'm a winee that may be my own personal hang up.  The service is really slow but when you get your food it's enough to fee two and a half people.  On the other hand the servers are all very cordial and accommodating.  Overall it definitely is a place I would visit again, but early in the evening so the food can settle before dinner.",0,0,0,Madison G.,"El Sobrante, CA",19,89,5

We ordered- the creamed spinach came cold, told them it was cold, and they actually brought it back cold again! Finally, a 3rd time, it was somewhat warm. Next, my boyfriend's Sirloin steak was burnt. They didn't bother to ask how our meals were so we didn't bother with it. The servers bumped our chairs several times and never apologized. Then when they brought us the bill, they hadn't reduced the $20 open table credit that we had, so again, we had to ask them to take that off the bill. Finally, when it was time to sign the bill and leave the tip, the server stood over our heads as we wrote the tip on the receipt, and he grabbed it furiously and walked away (who stands and waits while you finish? so rude!).

3.0,5/7/2015,"Came here for lunch during restaurant week with a few colleagues. Classic New York steakhouse with an old fashioned atmosphere and interior. I ordered clam chowder for the appetizer, the surf and turf - lobster tail and 8 oz filet mignon for the main course, and chocolate cake for dessert. We also ordered mashed potatoes and creamed spinach for the sides.  The steaks were just the right portion and medium rare like I ordered. The steaks were good but there was nothing outstanding about it - nothing to distinguish it from a Capital Grill or Ruth's Chris. It was very busy - Friday lunchtime. There was great service despite it being busy - our waiters were attentive. The ambience was great, lively but not too rushed or loud. Overall, I had a decent experience, however, would definitely think this is too pricey if we didn't order off the restaurant week menu.

It was a bit lackluster in flavor, and the cut could have been better; there was a surprising amount of tendons and fat, much of which you couldn't even saw through with knife. The sides were tasty, though the creamed spinach was far too soupy. Macaroni and cheese was good, as were the mushrooms, but none of it was memorably delicious. The crab appetizer had a hint of a fishy smell. The ambiance wasn't wonderful, and a little dated (lots of old wood, some peeling paint).

Would've liked it if it was fried/crunchier more but otherwise still really good!Clam chowder soup: 5/5 - Surprisingly, really REALLY delicious. If you have some complementary bread leftover, I recommend dipping it in the soup. Steak: 4/5 - I'm really tough on steak because I don't prefer it over other meats.

I ordered the clam chowder, surf and turf (10 oz filet + 5oz lobster tail), and cheesecake / chocolate mousse cake. Our table also split mac and cheese and hash browns (both fine if unremarkable).The clam chowder was standard fare -- very thick and creamy... more cream / potato than clam (I maybe tasted two or three pieces of clam). Where I'm mostly dinging them is on the entree: two of us ordered medium filet, another two medium rare. The mediums came out pinker than the medium rares. While the meat seemed to be a good, tender cut of meat... the texture was off. Having ordered a medium rare steak, I  found my cut more cooked / chewier than I'd hoped for. The lobster tail -- again, the meat was solid, but each bite was a bit salty. Desserts were strong -- cheesecake was great, and the chocolate mousse tasted dark chocolate-y, which is a pro for me. (also, the chocolate mousse comes with ice cream!)Service was fine. The place was really packed, but the waiters tried hard to make sure we were happy, had adequate drinks, etc. Additionally, noise was at a good volume, and we were all able to hear each other easily despite full tables surrounding us.All in all, it was a nice experience and well worth it during restaurant week.

1.0,2/15/2015,"Let me preface this by saying that I am a native Manhattanite and I've been eating at NY steakhouses for almost 40 years. In my opinion, Smith & Wollensky's Steakhouse is not a top NY steakhouse. Far from it.  It is evident in the lack of quality of both their meats and sides and service. One example is the ribeye steak. It is very fatty making what seems like a normal portion quite small. The spiciness on the Cajun ribeye is barely detectable. The doneness of the meat is hit or miss. The creamed spinach is unremarkable, etc., etc., etc. From the appetizers through to the desserts, the food here is just mediocre. Truly barely a step up from the Outback Steakhouse. Real NY steak houses are anything but mediocre.  My guess is that they stay in business by promoting  an hyped reputation to unknowing tourists who unfortunately leave thinking they just experienced a great NY steakhouse.

It's extremely hard to find a server with this gift, and he really made us feel very comfortable and valued as customers.

Knew the menu extremely well and helped us choose an amazing meal that hit every taste bud. We started with the fried calamari, which I loved. For the main course i had the Sirloin(delicious), it was cooked perfectly & full of flavor. On the side we shared hash browns and sautéed spinach, which too was delicious. For dessert we shared the coconut layer cake which was heavenly.The service was excellent, we were checked in on constantly, and the food came out promptly. I would recommend sitting in his area.

I have dined all over the U.S. At some of the greatest steakhouses and this one by far was the worst! The steak had no flavor what so ever. It was so disgusting. We had the porter house for two and I literally had to season my own steak with salt and pepper to get any kind of flavor. The waiter kept pushing us to get things We did not want. He brought an order of appetizer which I never ordered! He kept pushing me to order wine.  I don't drink wine ! Kept pushing me for desert!

I highly recommend it.  You can taste and appreciate the freshness of the crab meat. Also, the seasoning of the crab cake complimented well with the avocado-cucumber side that comes with it.  For the entree, I decided to go with the Filet Mignon.  The filet mignon was good, however, it did not blow me away.  I have had better elsewhere which is slightly disappointing because I believe the steak (main entree) should be the main reason why I would come back over and over as we are in a steakhouse!!!! We also had a few sides--hash brown, asparagus and creamed spinach.  The hash browns were perfect--appropriately crisp on the outside and seasoned well. The asparagus were steamed and unseasoned. The creamed spinach was creamy and delicious--had to refrain myself from devouring the entire bowl.  And for the dessert, I went with the carrot cake. Two thumbs up.

While this was unfortunate planning on our part, the hubs and I came here for dinner the last night we were in NY and just weren't that hungry after pigging out the last few days. Mental note to come back again on an empty stomach to try more!Anyway, we shared a shrimp cocktail, wedge salads and a filet. The waiter must have thought we'd go hungry and brought us a side order of fries on the house! Everything was solid - tasty and prepared well, but I can't say it was the best dinner I've ever had. It's just so hard when it comes to steakhouses - there are so many good choices!We were able to polish off a coconut cake before we left....and it was seriously the best coconut cake I've ever had!It's the service and the ambiance (and coconut cake) that will bring us back to Smith & Wollensky.

The good things heard about the food here was def spot on.We ordered the surf & turf sandwich..which has 1 lobster roll and 1 horseshoe sandwich. This entree comes with fries.  We also ordered onion rings, mac & cheese, a prime rib and the cajon style filet mignon.  The food was def delish.  Why I only gave it 2 stars was cos of the service.  We got there a little after they opened on Sunday and we waited for the waitress to come serve us for a while.  In totality, we waited over AN HOUR for our food to come (counting when the waitress took our order and when the food arrived.)I think there should have been more communication with us on her part.  Like, we would understand if we got there too 'early' and not enough cooks were in the kitchen at that time.  But seriously, no communication of why our food was taking forever and no following up if we needed anything or if we enjoyed the meal.So, sad to say..not sure if the food was good enough for me to overlook service.",1,0,0,Audrey C.,"San Diego, CA",427,1341,599

1.0,7/17/2014,"Consumer beware. Negative star rating. The three of us went tonight for a business meeting and that is the only reason why I didn't make a big fuss about the steak. The two of us ordered Colorado ribeye,  $56 a piece. The steaks arrived barely warm, were under seasoned and on the bone. One of those was mined and it was dry, tough and chewey. I inquired with the server whom I had to ""catch"" if that is actually ribeye as it looked and tasted more like sirloin. He assured me it was what we ordered. I had 2 bites and gave a piece to my company to try who was having filet mignon, and was enjoying his steak, but didn't like my steak and he agreed it was very chewey. I took three quarters of my steak home thinking I will give it to my dog, but I have changed my mind since then and I will return it to the restaurant tomorrow. We also ordered roasted cauliflower that was actually boiled, topped with cheese mixture and broiled on top. Pretty flaworless. The service was rude, inattentive,  pushy and not knowledgeable. I asked if the beef was grass fed and the answer was that it is well marbled. Go figure. The server kept pushing seafood platter even though I said I don't eat shrimp or lobster. My leftover steak was wrapped to go in piece of tin foil, no container of any sort. The same thing with most of cauliflower that no one was fond of. Anyhow, over $500 later it turned out to be a huge disappointment.  We got $90 bottle Of wine, 2 appetizers, 2 Colorado steaks, 1 10 Oz filet mignon,  2 sides and 1 cappuccino.

The wait staff are very attentive and responsive to your needs - they were excellent without being intrusive.  There is wine by the glass $12-20 and high end runs as you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber.  There is a full raw bar option on the appetizer menu and the shrimp are very large.  Most items are a la carte.  Salads run about $12-15.  Steaks are about $50 with $2 options for sauces, etc. and seafood was about $30 - note seafood is cooked pretty plain with no options emphasizing that you are here for steak.  Back to that steak:  divine!  wonderful!  tender, tasty and awesome.  Easily the best steak I have had in New York over multiple trips.  There is a full and separate bar location inside and a separate cafe on the outside that has more casual food.  Definitely recommend this one!",0,0,0,Bret A.,"Tampa, FL",47,666,140

They are average sized, not the jumbo lump cakes that I've had in other places.  The Mac & cheese I could eat several bowls of.  It's all cheesy, ooey-gooey goodness.  It appears that they put it in a broiler to get the top nice and crusty...two thumbs up for that!Now for the 5-star highlight...The coconut layer cake *faints, somebody get me a church fan*... That is the best cake that I've ever had, ever!!!!!  If I could just walk in there and buy a whole cake, I certainly would.  I mean it is moist and full of coconut flavor.  It melts in your mouth.  I do not have a sweet tooth but that cake will have me doing a back flip & drop into a split it's so damn good!!!One small tip (don't ever in your life ever order your filet well done).  My friend asked for her filet well done and the waiter scoffed at her. He started raising his voice and stormed off.  It was the funniest thing ever.  I know that filet should never be cooked well done, but hey, to each his own.",0,0,0,Candice C.,"Fort Myers, FL",84,99,74
4.0,3/21/2014,This place is fantastic. I'm not a fancy kind of girl but I am a big fan.Let's start at the beginning. The bar: It wasn't as fancy as I thought it was going to be. It looked more like an after work crowd just hanging out. I didn't sit there very long since I was late meeting my date and he was settling up. Once we sat down I ordered a glass of wine and you can't go wrong with Cabernet Sauvignon. Of course it was the most expensive and the waiter pushed it hard but I didn't mind.The food: We ordered the crab cakes as an appetizer and it was delicious. Lightly breaded and succulent. I was very pleased. There was only one though and we shared. I definitely wanted more. For the entrée I ordered the filet mignon Oscar. It was cooked just right. However my date ordered medium as well and his was a little overcooked. That was disappointing but he didn't mind. The service was great. The entire wait staff was really friendly and our waiter kept my wine glass filled. All in all if you are in the mood for a nice steak dinner this is the place to go. It wasn't stuffy and buttoned up like I thought it would be. I was pleasantly surprised.I glanced at the bill and it was over $200 of course. If I can trick another date into dropping this kind of cash again I'll definitely revisit. :-P,0,0,0,K. M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,13,0
4.0,3/19/2014,"God, I love Meat. And boy do they know meat here.  I've been here a number of times and for some reason, I've always forgotten to review them...here's to fixing that mistake!When you enter S&W, you can either be seated right away (if you're on time for your reservation) or get there a little early, head to the left, and take in their bar.  They have a ridiculous wine menu, and it can be a bit overwhelming (you do NOT want to order the wrong, 1200 bottle of wine my friend), so just mosey on up to the bar and ask the bartender for a recommendation.  Or get a beer, whatevs. The main dining rooms are old school steak house.  If you do not like or appreciate old school steak house - don't eat here.  Its loud, wooden, and a little cramped - but not in such a fashion that you can't hear the people you're eating with.  If you're with big boys (like my pops or my beefcake)...make your reso for one extra person so they can comfortable spread out (you're welcome for that little tidbit friend, next one will cost you).Of course, your starter is a bread basket.  Toss all your manners out the window and grab that pretzel roll.  If anyone tries to take it before you, bite them and then immediately lick it - its delicious. They have the typical steak house menu and specials (and so help me God, if you order fried chicken at S&W at my table, leave before I whack you).  This is a steak house.  Order.  Meat.I'm usually pretty all over the place with appetizers - I know what I like and I get what I like, but I also like to experiment, however, if I'm coming here with fellow meat and sea eaters, I'm getting the seafood tower.  The lobster is always fresh and juicy, and the shrimps are big and have that ""snap"" you only get when they're prepared perfectly.  The lump crab meat is served on a shell that I want to dump into my mouth.But I'm a lady, and ladies dont do that.  The real money shot is the fresh shaven horserasdish they give you.  Not that jarred crap, a horseradish root they've pressed.  And it. is. good.Last two times we were here, we joined their wine week. And I probably shouldn't even be telling you, because you're probably the drunk idiot that was sitting at the table next to us, spilling wine and eating a 160$ meal that he was promptly going to throw up or forget.  Don't be that guy.  Go here, enjoy your meal, and take home your leftovers.  The rib eye is gigantic...and your dog will appreciate the bone.  The filet is always giant - I like my meat rare, and this doesn't disappoint.Sides, you say?  Yes, sides.  Creamed Spinach, Asparagus, Hash Browns...if you need help ordering email me and I'll teach you, grasshopper.  I will teach you.  Desserts? I'm a profiterole kind of girl, or a creme brulee lover, but my pal got this peanut butter cake that looked tastey...and had a cute little cow shaped cookie.  That he promptly beheaded.But seriously folks, if you dont like steak, or your idea of a good steak is butterflied, well done with ketchup...go to sizzler, dont waste your money.  Its expensive, but its worth it.",3,2,0,Johanna G.,"Massapequa, NY",536,370,20

The only downside to the meal was that they didn't offer any sides with the meal - so my girlfriend only had a rather big piece of meat on her plate - I think even if it's an order of fries there needs to be some kind of side with a meal - but that's just me.For dessert I had the cheesecake which was moist with a delicious graham cracker crust.  My girlfriend had the coconut cake with ice cream which she said was absolutely delicious.Lastly, the service was superb - our waiter was very attentive to our needs which made the meal even more enjoyable.If you're looking for a ""classic"" New York steakhouse, Smith & Wollensky fits the bill!",0,0,1,Kim O.,"Yonkers, NY",67,190,2

My fiancé and sister had the porterhouse for 2 which they enjoyed. My father ordered a steak for himself. I don't remember which one it was but he enjoyed his too since he devoured the entire thing. We ordered asparagus, cream spinach and mac n Cheese as our sides. The mac n Cheese was made with shells instead of the typical macaroni and I liked it better since I held the cheese inside.

Made me think of how the place would appeal to guys through the decades.  I liked the waiters, most of whom were older men attired in jackets, who were all very attentive and brought the food out on trolleys. I also thought the linen hand towels in the bathroom you throw into a hamper was a nice touch.  Fell in LOVE with the pretzel rolls in the bread basket. Actually, I LOVED everything I had - tried the porterhouse, and savored the dry aged meat - the texture, the marbling. (the only thing I didn't like about the meat was that the table was so small, not all of the dishes fit on it comfortably. They also put steak sauce on the table, which I tried and reminded me of Heinz 57 sauce. However, I  felt the meat, for the most part, stood on its own with out the sauce.  The creamed spinach was out of this world - would love to serve it on top of everything.  Had the profiteroles for dessert, which were to die for - the cold ice cream against the lovely dark chocolate!

4.0,2/10/2014,"This review is for the Wollensky Grill, where the entrance is on E 49th. I've stopped by here after work and it's usually very crowded so a weekend visit might be better. The grill offers many of the same items found in the more formal dining room but I like it because it's more casual and relaxed. Service is always great and the bartenders know how to take care of you. Say hello to Ollie (shaved head) or Patrick (glasses).Granted, the prices are still going to reflect being attached to an upscale steakhouse but sometimes you just want to treat yourself to something more than diner food but less than a jacket required restaurant. Some recommended food items include the shrimp cocktail, the legit lump crab meat cocktail, and the calamari.Some solid entree items are a killer Cobb salad, a reliable house burger, and the horseshoe sandwich and its surf and turf cousin. The horseshoe comes with fries and two palm sized, shaved steak and cheese sauce sandwiches served on Texas toast. It is an extremely juicy and flavorful sandwich. You will need a napkin to eat this. I highly recommend the surf and turf because one of the sandwiches is subbed out for a lobster roll and the lobster meat is chunky with minimal mayo. It should be noted that this is a great Saturday or Sunday brunch recovery meal. The crowd will skew towards 40s and 50s loud, business jerks during the week and some tourists during the weekend.

It just shows how unprofessional he is, and didn't really care about quality service.  As for our main course, we weren't given any recommendations, even when we asked.  I had a horrible impression of this Mr.Wang.  However, the other waiters around, two elderly gentleman, were nice and friendly and just seems like they care more about how the customers think.  The gentleman who brought us dessert was also quite professional and stopped by to ask us how we are doing with our meal.  I'm glad that the other waiters are good or else I would have given this place a 1 star solely for its horrible service from this Wang person.  I would have given like 5% for Mr.Wang's service, but since I wasn't sure if all waiters share their tip by the end of the night, I tipped a standard 18% for NYC.  As for the food, this is what we ordered for 2 people- 2 glasses of wine - we know what we like, so enjoyed our wine- mixed green salad - pretty plain, nothing particular and can't really choose your own dressing (maybe u do, but we were not given the option to do it, if that's actually the case, BAD SERVICE again!!!)- porterhouse steak -quality steak, crispy on the outside and tender inside.  I wouldn't say it's amazing because I didn't like the steak sauce they have, but meat quality was still good enough-  side order - sauteed spinach - surprisingly good! not mushy at all, and not too oily like most restaurants are- dessert - we ordered the coconut layered cake with vanilla ice cream and chocolate mousse cake.  The coconut cake was really good, not too sweet, good combo with the vanilla ice cream and a touch of sourness from the passion fruit sauce.  The chocolate mousse was good also, but didn't stand out in comparison to other chocolate mousse i had.- cappuccino/latte - actually very disappointing, the foam was whipped surprisingly poorly without the consistency of what a cappuccino/latte should be.  They actually gave us two latte instead, and two poorly made latte.  They taste like something I would do with my simple nespresso machine at home. To think that they charged $7 each, it's a total rip off.In general, this is what i would give for this restaurantFood: 4 starsService: 2 starsEnvironment: 2.5 stars (Restaurant had good decor, but we were kinda cramped at the corner table at an odd space at the back where all the waiters are hanging out, so I got a earful of gossips about their working shifts, plus they keep dropping utensils and plates and making loud noises!!! They also get extremely close when cleaning other tables, I was afraid that they might splatter oil on my clothes)Location: convenientNoise Level: medium",0,0,0,Wendy L.,"Taipei, Taiwan",144,104,433

2.0,10/30/2013,"Ive been coming to S&W's a couple times a year for the past 5 years or so.  I must say the last few times i've come in recent memory I always walk out and have the same thought in my head, ""man this place is just living off its reputation nowadays"".  Im usually with a crowd of around 4 people when I go and have always gotten a steak (whether its prime/ribeye/or that balsamic steak they have and everytime i've come I felt more and more that the food isnt as good as it was 5 years ago.  This time around after dining at another steakhouse about a month ago (i'll exclude the name) where i got the Ahi Tuna (I know, I know seafood at a steakhouse! but for those that are steakhouse regulars you know that they typically have some of the best seafood around).  At the other steakhouse I got the Tuna which was unbelieveably good!  It was a large portion, coated in sesame seeds and topped off with this delicious sort of asian infused sauce that was to die for.  It also included a seaweed salad on the plate which was a nice touch.After that experience at the other steakhouse when I was at S&W's last week I decided the get the Tuna thinking it would be similar.  I can not tell you how dissapointed i was when they brought it to me.  First, I asked for it raw and it was medium (which may not seem like that big of a deal, but for anyone who likes/eats ahi tuna raw they know this IS a big deal.  Second, the portion was incredibly small and the overall presentation of it was pretty ugly to be quite honest.  Other than the tuna steak there was nothing on the plate not even some sort of decorative lettuce (I suppose I watch way too much Food Network).  Third, the Tuna was not coated in sesame seeds which really adds to the flavor and a nice ""crunch"" when your eating (which I like, but may not be ideal for others).  Now, I understand I could of asked if it was and requested it to be done, but I just didnt think of it at the time because I was chatting with my group of friends when we ordered.  The one silver lining I suppose was they did offer a sauce similar to the one I had at the other place and it was pretty good.I suppose if it wasnt for my previous experience elsewhere I would not of known better and had nothing to compare it to, but i've had a lot of ahi tuna at a lot of places and this overall quality, presentation, and portion could be best compared to what i would expect to get if i ordered it at a chain restaurant like applebees, soo dissapointing.The service like always was on the spot and I really have never had an issue with that.  They are always very attentive and despite the annoying occasional ""upsell"" they try its always very good.I would rate S&W's a 2.5 if it were possible, and I wish I could write a better review as this place used to be SO good, but like I noted earlier I cant help the feeling that they just live off their reputation now and I believe they need to make some changes to catch up with the times.",0,0,0,Chris D.,"New York, NY",3,21,0

Are you kidding? It's a good slice for a steak restaurant. It is meant for one person. There are bigger slices at similar restaurants. This isn't a flourless chocolate cake or a cheesecake. This is a chocolate mousse cake. It's alternating layers of chocolate sponge cake and chocolate mousse. It is light. airy. not heavy at all. not sweet (huge plus). and really solid. I would get it again if it weren't for the fact that it's $10 and I'd have to go to S&W to get it.Carrot Cake - Good, but a bit dry. Has walnuts and raisins. Nothing too impressive, but definitely solid. This is a larger portion than the chocolate mousse cake, if for no other reason than that it's so much denser.

He's been wanting to come here for a while, so this was a perfect opportunity.We were a bit early for our reservation, so we sat down at the bar for a drink while we killed some time. My bf's uncle also works here as a resident bartender, so he asked if he was working, but apparently he only has the day-shift. The bartender was nice enough to give us our drinks on the house because of the affiliation. Sweet!We were sat upstairs, and immediately helped by our server. He was very nice and was super attentive all night. I was also kind of nervous that we might feel out of place here, being that we're in our late 20s. I thought the crowd would be a bit different, but the staff totally made us feel welcome.Since I don't eat meat, I ordered the beet salad, which was much bigger than I thought it was going to be! I also ordered the mac and cheese side, thinking that would be small as well, but it was also gigantic. I ended up taking half of it home. The bf got the NY strip steak and a baked potato on the side. The potato came with this little topping stand that had sour cream, bacon bits, chives and cheese on it. Pretty cool! Everything was very good. I wouldn't write home about my meal because it was pretty basic, but the bf really seemed to enjoy his steak. Because we were sat next to a table with like 6 kids at it, who were all very loud and were running around, the maitre d' checked up on us and asked us if we wanted to move. We said that it wasn't an issue but I guess because of it, we got free cheesecake for dessert! That was really nice of them.. totally did not have to do that. He even checked in on us as we were leaving and apologized for the other table AND offered us a drink at the bar. We said it wasn't necessary but this place DEFINITELY gets 5 stars for service. The ambiance of the place is just like you'd imagine. Steakhouse, upper class, fancy with pictures of famous people lining the walls of the bar.

3.0,8/15/2013,"Not bad. It's not on par with the best for certain (Del frisco's, keen's, sparks, etc.), But it's not bad. The steak was perfectly cooked to my order and was very tender but wasn't particularly flavorful. I always order sirloin so as to have a fair base with which to compare these various steak houses. Usually it's a very flavorful cut. Not this time.The creamed spinach: it's not just chopped, it's pulverized. Almost like they ran it through a juicer. The flavor was just so so.Grilled asparagus was very good.The pea soup, which they claim is famous, must've achieved its notoriety by assassinating somebody famous. It was just OK, definitely not worthy of fame.They also rate their own hash browns quite highly, when in fact they were on the poor side, the worst part of the meal. Prices were average for New York City steak houses. Service was good; no complaints on that front. The atmosphere was quite nice, and quiet, which I consider a big plus.But you simply don't walk out thinking you've just had a stellar meal. It was OK.",0,0,0,Joseph P.,"Manhattan, NY",4,43,0

5.0,8/14/2013,"I go to the grill a couple times a month, as my aunt and uncle are regulars there, and I always have an excellent meal. The bartender is great, the waitstaff is friendly and knowledgeable, and the restaurant treats its regulars incredibly well.As I don't fix what doesn't need fixing, my meal hardly ever deviates from what I consider to be the perfectly crafted dinner:Starters: Crab and Lobster cocktail, fried calamari. The cocktail is a substantial portion and always tastes fresh and prepared perfectly. It comes with a tasty green sauce, which I believe is their own ginger mayo. It's awesome; I always eat more than just my share. The fried calamari is what you want out of fried calamari: golden brown and crispy.Entrees: I either split the porterhouse for 2 or get the Colorado rib steak. Both come charred on the outside, like a good broiled steak should be, and tender on the inside with just enough fat to make it nice and juicy. I love my steak incredibly rare, almost mooing, and they always cook it exactly how I ask for it. I either get bearnaise or au poivre sauce for the occasional dip and creamed spinach as my veggie (after all I have to stay healthy). I've seen mixed reviews of the creamed spinach on here, but if you like it mixed more with the cream instead of full leafs, it's the creamed spinach for you.Dessert: Usually we don't make it this far, but when we do, Wollensky's has OUT OF THIS WORLD cheesecake and carrot cake. They're both awesome and if you're a fan of either of those desserts, then order them and thank me later.As far as a late-evening place to grab an excellent bite and drink after work in Midtown, Wollensky's Grill is where it's at.",0,0,0,Gabe F.,"Manhattan, NY",1,17,8

We thoroughly enjoyed getting to meet him, and his knowledge of the menu is expert!  We'd make a return visit just to see him!  I enjoyed the filet topped with crab meat, and my husband chose the halibut special.  Both were outstanding, as were the grilled asparagus and macaroni and cheese we chose as side dishes.  We'll definitely be back to visit Smith and Wollensky when we return to the city!",0,0,0,Rachel W.,"Tupelo, MS",0,17,0

5.0,7/15/2013,"My boyfriend and I came here for our 5 year anniversary two nights ago and can honestly say that it was one of the best meals we have ever had! Prior to our visit, we were informed that it was very ""Suit and Tie"", so we both dressed the part, donning a full suit and gown, only to find that the dress code wasn't as strict as we had anticipated. There were people in dress shirts, jeans, and casual summer dresses. So, we did feel a bit over dressed. Not a big deal. We walked in and were warmly greeted by the Maiter'd who seated us immediately, even though we were about 15 minutes early for our reservation. The dining room was upstairs (Not very pleasant when wearing heels) and our table was off to the side, near a window. The room was big, open, and beautiful. Very clean and bright, with a large skylight in the center of the room. The tables for two were small, but adequate. As soon as we were seated, our waiter came over and introduced himself. His name was Carl, and he was extremely knowledgeable about everything from their extensive wine list to the specifics of each Steak on the menu. We placed our drink orders, which were brought to us within a few minutes. Then, we placed our meal orders. I ordered the Maryland Crab cake as my appetizer and the Filet Mignon with Creamed Spinach for my main course. My boyfriend ordered a Caesar Salad for his appetizer and the Cajun Spiced Filet Mignon with Onion Rings for his main course. I was told that the crab cakes are made to order, and that it might take a little while to be brought out. Fine by me. In the mean time, we sipped our wine and enjoyed the ambiance.  Surprisingly, the appetizers came out much quicker than I had anticipated. The crab cake was fresh and perfectly cooked. My boyfriend's salad was lightly dressed and perfect, by his account. After we finished up, the waiter promptly cleared our plates and offered us a refill on our drinks, which we both accepted. Shortly after, our main courses were brought out. Our fillets were the size of a fist and the sides were very generous. The meat melted in your mouth, we barely needed our knives to cut it, the fork alone would have done fine. The Creamed Spinach was the best I ever tasted and the onion rings were crispy and not greasy. Every mouthful, we would look at each other with that ""This is the best meal of my life"" look in our eyes! In an attempt to save room for dessert, we ate half and asked to have the rest put in a to-go box. We then placed our dessert orders; My boyfriend ordered the Chocolate Mousse Cake while I opted for the Coconut Cream Cake, which I was told was amazing...and it was! The waiter must have seen the expression on my face as I took my first bite because he came over and asked if I was enjoying it. He also added that it is made fresh every day and that the particular piece that I was enjoying was made only three hours prior. My boyfriend said that his Chocolate Mousse Cake was unbelievable. They even added a chocolate cookie shaped as a cow as a garnish! When it seemed apparent that my boyfriend and I couldn't fit another crumb, the waiter offered to have our desserts wrapped up, as well. The bill came and was actually not as expensive as we had expected to be, not to say that it was inexpensive, because it was, very, but every mouthful was 100% worth it. Everything we had ordered went above our expectations. Food wise, this place is top notch. Even our left overs, tasted amazing the next day. My single complaint was that when we had first arrived, our waiter seemed to not address me. Even when I asked questions about the menu, he would look at my boyfriend when he answered. Don't get me wrong, he was very nice and knowledgeable. A bit old fashioned, I suppose, but that's my single complaint about Smith & Wollenski's. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for the best steak dinner of life! The classy environment combined with excellent service, and out of this world food to match, has made this place my new favorite steakhouse! Cheers!",0,0,0,Elizabeth M.,"Ronkonkoma, NY",47,49,38

Delicious cut up steak (the kind you would expect at a quality steakhouse), crisp hash browns, topped with an over-easy egg and hollandaise sauce. At the table they mix it all up with a tabasco/ketchup  sauce and then you are set. Our table ordered 2 for 6 people as an appetizer. I wish we got three.For main course I ordered a steak sandwich, which was good but nothing to write home about...Ambiance: For a Wednesday night, it was very busy and a little loud, but we got the tables behind the glass which was very nice and allowed us to all chat.Needless to say I will be back for the Hash...",1,3,1,Joe L.,"Larchmont, NY",69,24,5

5.0,5/28/2013,"This is a very typical incarnation of a New York City Steakhouse. I took my girlfriend here for her birthday after I could not get reservations for Lugers. And I certainly don't think we lost anything by going here instead. We arrived a half hour early for my reservation and we were sat immediately at a table near the kitchen. Now some people may not like being there but my girlfriend and I must have stared at every single dish that came out of that door. We were greeted very quickly by our server, Nicolo. Now maybe its that him and I share the same name, but he totally blew away all of my preconceived notions of the service at S&W. For all of those who wrote bad reviews based on service, I just have to assume you didn't have this man for your server.We started off with the Tomato and Buffala Mozzella Salad for an app. It arrived very quickly and was a towering stack of cheese and tomato. Make sure you use some of the bread they give you as a vessel (it works, trust me). We also ordered a bottle of wine off of there extensive list (I believe at least 6 pages) and I ordered a Scotch. The prices for Alcohol are very reasonable for the area and type of restaurant.Our meat selection was my easiest choice. For all you reviewers who got the Filet and didn't like I am sorry but that cut of meat is not the quintessential steakhouse cut.  I went with the bone-in Colorado Rib-eye (24oz) and my girl got a bone-in NY Cut Sirloin (rare cut but very nice). Both were ordered medium rare and both were perfectly cooked. The fat melts in your mouth and the flavors were excellent. It is an ode to the meat and to the classic steakhouse mantra when the chef puts only salt and pepper on your bone-in ribeye. Moving along to sides. We ordered Hashed Browns and Creamed Spinach as they were the most classic of sides. The Creamed Spinach was delicious and a welcome light side to the heaviness of the rest of the meal. The Hash was cooked perfectly and had the perfect amount of salt, but I could have used more pepper. Also both sides were split by the servers and placed in separate plates for us.  For desert, we ordered the apple tart with ice cream and Espresso/Cappuccino.All in all, the service, ambiance, and food made it an amazing experience. It certainly belongs on the list of top steakhouses in NYC.",4,0,1,Nick D.,"Aberdeen Township, NJ",21,34,0

We will go back - as long as we get a better table & a better waiter!---SO LOUD in the grill I couldn't hear myself think. The waiter clearly needs his ears checked because he was basically shouting at us the entire time. He was over-the-top obnoxious and had no issue treating our table (of 10 people mind you) second rate to the table next to us of 3 people who were as equally as loud and obnoxious as himself. F-bombs dropped every other sentence... it didn't end. My mom's salad came 30 minutes after everyone else entrees arrived so she was eating her meal by herself. The salad was sub-par at best. Asked for ketchup and mustard 3 times and when it finally arrived my burger was cold. The table they seated us at was fine but then they decided to pull out a table behind ours so the space for the waiters to walk through was less than a foot, which resulted in my friends being kicked by passing waiters and waitresses throughout the entire meal. When we politely asked them to fold up the table they refused and suggested that we push our table closer to the wall, when we were already cramped up in a tiny space to begin with.

The Filet was honestly disappointing for a steakhouse of this prestige - even if it was RW I would've expected a little bit more effort. I personally ordered my steak done medium well, while my friend ordered it medium rare. We couldn't distinguish which was which at the table...which definitely was an issue. It was also relatively tasteless for such a large hunk of meat. Dessert was very good though, we had chocolate mousse cake that came with a side of delicious whipped cream, and a friend had the coconut cake.

The only questions we had to answer was how we wanted the steak cooked, and what appetizer choice we wanted (out of 3). I've had teenagers in TGIF get my order right without writing it down. No excuse. Strike three. As far as the food goes, it was GOOD. If all of the above was in line, they might get a 3.5-4 It was well seasoned, cooked well, and flavorful. The sides were on the mediocre side of good. So what redeemed them? Dessert! Seriously. The chocolate mousse was smooth, sweet, and just the right balance of chocolate.

2.0,2/23/2013,"I'll make my review of Smith & Wollensky quick and straight to the point:Absolutely not worth the money.  I've had much better steak (I ordered the Filet) with much more flavor, at half the price.  Even the sides were flavorless, the broccoli was just steamed broccoli, no seasoning. The service was average at best.  Take it from someone who was in the restaurant business for many years.  The old gentleman who have been working here for years havent worked hard for their tips since before the civil war.If you are going here, you are going because of the name, not because of the quality. When everyone did the awkward stare at each other after paying the outrageous bill and asking ... ""So, what did you think?""  The best thing I could say was ""The ends did not justify the means.""  The verdict amongst the table was unanimous.I've lived in Manhattan for 5 years now, and enjoy trying new restaurants every weekend.  Do yourself, and your wallet a favor, skip this one.",1,2,0,Adam K.,"New York, NY",98,6,1

3.0,2/19/2013,"3.5 StarsI made reservations for last Saturday for two. We arrived on time and still had to wait 15 minutes to be seated. The tables are a little too close together, the crowd is definitely ""interesting"". I suppose it is a good place to people watch. The decor is rather simple since the focus is simply on the food and the service is very slow. Thankfully, I enjoyed my company so I was not in a rush by any means.I know you are only supposed to order steak at a steakhouse but we're suckers for tuna tar tar and had to try it for an appetizer. We thought it was a safe bet since everyone around us was also chowing down on seafood. Let me just say: 80% tomatoes and 20% tuna. All we could taste was cilantro and tomatoes. It is as if ingredients were marinating together for hours. All flavors became one. I tried to clear my pallet with water but my glass was entirely cracked and chipped. It took a good 10 minutes to even get a replacement. Another major con - the butter is frozen and taken straight out of the fridge. I'm all about the details and something as simple as whipping the butter at room temp could have made a huge difference especially since the variety of breads are cold when served and not warm to soften the spread.Now to the steaks. Good. Very good. We didn't bother with dessert because we wanted to make sure we ended the night on a good note.

Per usual steak houses have the best RW deals, and Smith and Wollensky was in the same boat offering a nice selection of their staple items (e.g. steak). The food breakdown: caesar salad- standard. large serving though. had to ask for black pepper as none was offered or on the table. filet- i ordered mine medium rare + and my colleague ordered her's medium rare. it took us several bites to decide they had switched our steaks. good thing we are good friends and just swapped our half eaten steaks so we could each have the one cooked to our preference. but definitely botched on the restaurants sides especially as the med rare was more like rare which was not very appetizing for me for the first half of trying to just eat through it. server never asked how our steaks were done. hashbrown side for the table- suggeted by our server. i didnt really care for. was very burnt on the top and didnt have much flavor. pecan pie- good. very sweet. i ate a few bites and left the rest. i also tried the coconut cake which was tasty. Also, there is a $5 glass of wine deal with the RW menu so i obviously had that. your standard table wine which was easy to drink with little complexity.worth noting- they were playing Christmas music in our dining room (small back room upstairs). it was February 1st. weird...!All in all I would recommend this place for RW. i came here a few years ago for a work dinner and really enjoyed it but the food quality this go around didnt really stack up (potentially at RW hazard, but a restaurant should be on their game at all tiems). not sure i would come back otherwise.",0,0,0,Christina H.,"Manhattan, NY",54,533,110

3.0,2/3/2013,"Let's start with the negatives first. While the old style charm of the dining area was pleasant, it was way too noisy. I like a little bit of noise so that I don't feel like the tables around us are listening to my conversation, but having to raise my voice so that my girlfriend sitting across can hear me is ridiculous. My glass of wine and water was empty from the time I finished it, which was shortly after I ate my appetizer until I paid the check. I did not expect such poor service especially when I was being tended by a waiter with 2 assistants. On with the food, I  thought the food was excellent. I went during restaurant week and it was well worth the $38 + $10 supplemental charge. To start I had calamari, it was very fresh and delicious, where the portion was more than adequate. For the entree, I had the 14 ounce dry aged sirloin which was absolutely fantastic. It was very flavorful and juicy where the aging flavors kick in as I was continue to chew.

I got the filet for my main, which was a good steak (I mean, come on my whole meal is only $25 and part of that meal is a 10 oz filet mignon...it was a good steak). I finished with the coconut layer cake, which was delicious and probably my favorite part of the meal. Not sure what the fruity (maybe pineapple) honey glaze was on the bottle, but it made this dish. Very good (and HUGE) slice of cake. Also, there is a $5 glass of wine deal with the RW menu. We ordered a side of hash brown for the table. They were good, but pretty greasy.

Chocolate Mousse cake - I refused to get the Coconut cake because I hate coconutty stuff, so I was worried I would regret this one. The Mousse cake was probably the highlight of my meal, also making me round up to 4 stars. It was enormous, delicious, and some chocolate cracker on it was so good.

Add in taxes and tips and blam, ~$20 for three shrimps. Can anyone gouge you deeper into the asshole? The waiter jokingly told me ""You get more value if you order another shrimp for just an extra $3."" JUST an extra $3 for a shrimp? No thanks. So the food came, I got the sliced steak Wollensky or whatever it's called. I asked for a medium, and it seemed to arrived in a medium well done condition. When I cut into it, it was more brown than pink-red. Oh, and the portions. They're meagerly small, to say the least. It came with a few strands of veggies. Each strand probably is costing me $5 or so. I can easily get a whole bundle at Safeway for $3 or so. I'm all down for over the top pricing for over the top food. What I'm not happy about is over the top pricing for shittyass food. The atmosphere was decent, but you can tell the service was in a snobbyish way. You get an aura where they seem to think highly of themselves. Anyways, I wasn't about to let them have the last laugh.

They charge high end prices for steak, and sadly do not deliver equal value. Tasty enough, but you can get equal level quality in other places for cheaper prices. With so many amazing steak places in NYC and stiff competition for clients, there is no excuse for an average cut and cook of meat. Head to the other high end steakhouses if you want quality for $$$.

1.0,1/12/2013,"Worst experience ever. We were a party of 4 that came for dinner because we heard a lot of good reviews and we were ALL extremely disappointed.Both of the waiters that served us were rude and unpleasant. We had to wait for 20 min before anyone even looked towards our table and then ask the waiter twice if we could order before he finally came to our table and acted like he's doing us a favor by serving us.Three of us ordered the Fillet Mignon and my husband ordered the Sirloin steak. We all asked for the steaks to be cooked medium well. When the steaks arrived, after a 40 min wait (!!!), one of them was undercooked and completely bloody, mine was overcooked and dry and my husband's was also overcooked even more than well done. Usually we are not the kind of people who complain and we almost never return dishes at a restaurant but these were just uneatable. We called our waiter and told him that our steaks came out not as we asked them to be cooked and his response was: ""I can call the manager if you want"". No apologies, no acknowledgment that it was their mistake and absolutely no willingness to try and please us by offering to exchange those steaks. Just a quick reminder: these steaks are $50. The manager comes over to our table and asks us what the problem is. We explain to him that the steaks are overcooked and express the fact that we don't wish to cause any trouble thinking that he will surely offer to take them back and make us new ones. His response:"" I can bring you some free spinach if you'd like"". No, I am NOT KIDDING. Only after my husband literally asked if he could return his steak and get a new one did the manager agree to do so. Unbelievable. Regardless of that we all did not enjoy the food at all. The baked potatoes we ordered were tasteless and the meat itself didn't have any flavor to it. We all ended up leaving more than half of our steaks untouched. Our waiter and the manager passed by our table numerous times while looking at our plates and not once were we asked if everything was ok. If it was me and I saw a table of 4 that haven't touched their food I would at least check if everything is to their liking and make sure nothing is wrong. Again - this is not an inexpensive restaurant. I expected a minimal level of customer service.We were never asked if our plates could be cleared. We had to ask our waiter to see a desert menu and it was only then where he cleared our FULL plates, again, not wondering if something was maybe wrong since we haven't touched our food.They didn't clear everything from the table so when the desert came out the waiter didn't have anywhere to place the plate so he basically handed the plate over to our friend for her to hold and figure out where to place on the table and simply left. If I could not give any stars I would. We will never return again. Honestly we all couldn't figure out why this place has so many good reviews. The food was awful but the service was even worse. All in all it was a huge disappointment and I can't believe they charge those prices for steaks that are simply not worth it.There are so many good steakhouses and restaurants in NYC.

We just felt that the waiters didn't give a **** about us.

4.0,1/2/2013,"HOLY SH!T!  THIS IS THE 50th STEAKHOUSE I'VE REVIEWED! I've been here once before, but that was before I started doing reviews. I remember thinking it was in my short list of favorites at the time, so I needed to come back and give it the old once-over, JP style. The verdict: not quite as incredible as I remember, but still a solid dining experience.Flavor: 8The flavor here was good but it lacked a little seasoning or salt. My rib eye was cooked nicely, but there definitely was a little bit of bleed-out - like that time of the month when broads start to bleed from their vadges. I think if there was more crust or char on the meat, the juices would've been sealed in better. They definitely let the meat rest properly before serving, so they got it mostly right. They DO have a steak sauce here that they pop on the table after you order your food, but it tasted more like a BBQ sauce to me. Perhaps good on chicken, but it would fuck up a good steak, in my opinion.  Choice of Cuts & Quality Available: 9The selection here is all prime, and dry-aged in house - so it is nice quality. You can taste that in the natural flavor, and that might be why they are light on the seasoning. Some places don't want to tarnish the purity of a nice cut. They have five different styles of filet, four of which come in two sizes. They have single sirloin cuts in two sizes AS WELL AS a sirloin for two and a NY sirloin (strip). Then there's the Colorado rib steak, a Cajun marinated rib steak, a prime rib, and a porterhouse for two. Last, they have ""sliced steak Wollensky"" in two sizes as well, which is another sirloin of some kind. That's a lot of fucking beef to choose from.Portion Size & Plating: 9My steak was 28oz, bone-in. That's a good-sized slab of meat on the bone - like Lexington Steele. I didn't ask about the sizes of the other cuts. I'm sorry about that, assholes. Plating was basic steakhouse styling.Price: 8Prices here range from $45 to $54 for proper cuts of steak. The Colorado rib steak, which I had, came in on the higher side of that range at $53. It's a bit high compared to other joints. Was it worth the money? Well... I guess. I can say yes if you are a purist. If you are like me, though, and sometimes you want a little crust on your steak, then you might be better off elsewhere for this price range. I did think the crab claw was over-priced, though it was delicious. I was hoping for a little more than one claw - like maybe an entire crab.  Bar: 8The bar here is nice, and it reminded me of [link] Keens a little, though not quite as incredible. It has an old feel, it smells like a bar, and the bartender is fancied up with some nice attire and even has an Irish accent. The martini was made perfectly, and came with three unpitted castelvetrano olives instead of your normal bullshit cocktail olives. Very nice - almost worth the $14 you pay for it (before tax & tip). I will be honest though - I hate NYC's east side, bottom to top, but especially midtown. I never hang out there, and I most likely wouldn't go there just for the bar unless I lived in that area (which I would never do). So there you have it. Specials and Other Meats: 8Our waiter didn't read us any specials, so I was assuming there were none... until we overheard another waiter take a surf & turf order. I have a feeling my wife might have ordered that had we known about it. It wasn't on the menu if it was a special - I'll chalk that up to a service mishap. For other meats, they had braised short rib, lamb chops (which my wife ordered), roasted veal chops, and lemon pepper chicken. The lamb chops were thick and juicy, and cooked nicely - not too gamy. They came with an utterly horrific mint jelly (on the side, thank God), which tasted like melted mint gumdrops - those big, granulated sugar covered ones that you get from a crystal candy dish at your dead grandmother's house. Mildly reminiscent of tooth paste. Fuck that shit. Apps, Sides & Desserts: 7To start, I had the colossal Florida stone crab, which to my dismay was just a claw and not a full crab. It was absolutely delicious though. My wife had the famous split pea soup, which was very smooth and tasty, but ultimately nothing to rave about. On the side we had creamed spinach. I had heard good things about it here, but I wasn't impressed. I prefer a leafier creamed spinach in general, but I am not opposed to the pureed type. Here it was pureed, but I thought it lacked punch. It was nice when you slathered it on your meat and took a combo bite though. For dessert we shared a disappointing slice of the bourbon pecan pie. The nutty top part was nice, but the inside was a little too gelatinous and fake tasting. It just didn't compare to the walnut pecan pie at [link] Sparks. Seafood Selection: 10There is a ton of seafood here. In addition to a full array of shellfish and regular fish for cold apps (tuna tartare, clams, oysters, shrimp, crab claws(REVIEW CUT FOR LENGTH)",3,3,3,JohnnyPrimeC. C.,"Manhattan, NY",199,213,4300

A baked potato that was *literally* thrown in the oven and thrown on the plate (dry, tasteless). And finally the spinach was also Ok, nothing special. I'm willing to shell out that much for a spectacular experience but this  was anything but that!

The coat check room is extremely tight but the ladies brushed our coats dry and hung them promptly.- maitre'd and staff couldn't have been more professional and/or polite. They made conversation with us while dozens of waiting guests stood sipping cocktails in the full bar. We were seated immediately into the 1st floor, 99% full dining room.- server (Danny) knew all the answers to menu-based questions and then some. He made his rounds throughout the night to each table and the desk, checking but not hovering.- seafood for four - amazing. The presentation alone is worth the purchase. Their cajun ribeye is the best steak in the city, bar none. Get it. I don't care if you don't like spicy food, that's how flavorful it was. Hashed browns were crispy and dense. Creamed spinach melted in your mouth. Peanut butter cake, coconut cake and cappuccinos all were perfect.     I do believe the steakhouse market has become somewhat saturated in the past 5-10 years but there are obvious reasons why this one remains a constant.

2.0,11/28/2012,"I was in NYC with my wife and 3 grandsons for a short getaway. My grandsons are hungry growing boys and I enjoy watching them eat. I promised them I would take them out for big fat steaks to Smith and Wollensky which was a short walk from our hotel at 50th and 3rd. The night before my wife and I snuck out and went there for a drink after the kids had gone to sleep. (The oldest is 16 by the way) . We had the most wonderful time. There is a guy behind the bar who I am sure is famous in NYC named Patrick. Service was good, but level of fun was off the charts. My wife was laughing for hours after we returned to hotel . Next time I'm in NYC I will definetely go back to the bar. This guy knows how to create a welcoming fun atmosphere that is second to none. Now we get to dinner the following night. I'm not going to talk about staters or dessert which were both better than average. Service was awful. We arrived around 930 pm after a long day of walking. I think the waiter wasn't expecting any more tables and was clearly not happy to see us. He knew what to say at the table but his body language was ""let's get this over with"".  He never seemed to be there when we needed him , but stood close to the table after bringing the bill before I asked for it while we were still finishing dessert . We were not lingering , there were still many other patrons in the restaurant . He just wanted to leave and made me feel unwelcome . Putting the service aside ,if the steaks were good I would return quite confident that our waiter was the exception and not the norm. Unfortunately our steaks were full of nerves and too fatty. We ordered 3 NY's with the bone in and the kitchen sliced them up for us to make it easier to serve the 2 younger of my grandsons. I didn't bother complaining . I had no desire to wait for new steaks. We ate what was edible and went on to dessert. In Toronto I eat quite often at Morton's, Ruth's Chris, Barberians and The Miller Tavern. All very good. I expect that Smith and Wollensky is usually in the same league , but it was not on that night.

4.0,11/2/2012,"I couldn't leave NYC without going to a grade-A steakhouse. After doing Yelp research and recommendations from friends & colleagues, short of Peter Luger's, Smith & Wollensky was the place to goWe made reservations for 8 pm on a Thursday, got there at 8:05 and had to wait 20 minutes to be seated. This kind of ticked me off, but it was so worth the wait. We were taken to a kind of side room where they had a few tables for couples, and 3 tables for groups. It was away from the noise of the main floor which I rather enjoyed.The only downside would be the table was too small for all of the delicious food!My girlfriend and I ordered the fried calamari as an appetizer and it was delicious! The calamari and baby octopus were fried perfectly and well seasoned, and the sauce that came with was warm and flavorful.For the main course, I ordered the large filet mignon, done medium, with Roquefort (I freaking LOVE cheese, especially blue cheese with my steak) and the creamed spinach. My girl ordered the regular filet medium-well with baked potato. While we were waiting, the bread basket they brought us was so-so. There were some selections that were delicious, others were nothing memorable. The butter however was delicious.The food arrived and OMG what a treat! I swear there was a layer of cheese on my steak maybe half the thickness of the filet. It was soooo goooood. My only complaint was that my filet was a little pinker than what I like, but it was still good. Only the very center I couldn't muster. My girlfriend's steak was perfect for her - charred on the outside, cooked evenly throughout. She rubbed it in their delicious steak sauce and what a meal it made! The baked potato and creamed spinach were delicious of course. We simply couldn't finish our sides with the deliciousness of the meats.We decided to skip out for dessert, even though many Yelpers recommend the carrot cake or coconut cake. For $11 a dessert, I could find many other places where that could be better spent. In the end, the reason smith & wollensky didn't get 5 stars was for a few things: the long wait even though we had reservations, every time we needed a refill on our water, we had to ask for it (the waiter didn't notice or just didn't bother to fill it up on his own volition), and when we boxed up our leftovers, we specifically asked them to put the leftover cheese from my steak with my girlfriend's filet.

2.0,10/8/2012,"Here's why I am leaving a bad review of my favorite NYC steakhouse. After plenty of times going in the front door I was looking forward to trying ""the grill"" at the side door. The Hispanic punk that posed as our waiter (I think his name was Geo) sat us down and did as little as possible to process us as we sat against the glass on 49th street. He took our order and that was the last we saw of him. Well, I take that back. We watched him stand near the side door and jack around with a few other useless bastids while another dude brought us our Steaks etc. We had to ask the other guy for bread and butter etc. All in all I choked down the mediocre filet with little fanfare and absolutely no service. I hate, I repeat, I hate leaving negative reviews on businesses as I own one myself. The experience tonight made me look forward to my next trip to NYC where I will now look forward to finding a new favorite steak house in a city chock full of them. My suggestion to the owners of this branch of their chain (and that is what it is) is to train these tough guy wanna bes and weed out the losers so your clients that are serious steak lovers don't need to interact with immature little boys that are about as serious about...ah forget about it.

It was a lot larger than I expected, and it was juicy and tender. No frills on this steak: just broiled meat seasoned with salt and pepper. Simple, but great! Filet Oscar [$45 for a 10oz / $49 for a 14oz] -- I had nothing left on my plate by the end of this evening.  I went ahead with the 14oz and it was great!  This time around, they had to butterfly the steak because they didn't have a whole 14oz (so they found a way to do it, I guess.)  Sadly, because of this, the steak came out a little too charred.  Whatever the case may be, it was still super delicious.  The crab portion was awesome but sometimes (this time included) I wished for more asparagus.  Was this the best Filet Oscar experience that I've ever had at Smith and Wollensky?  Definitely not.  Was one of my top three experiences?  No question!  My other experiences with Smith and Wollensky have been perfect, especially involving their Filet Mignon.  Trust that this experience was rare and that their steaks are usually charred perfectly.Chocolate Mousse Cake [$10] -- This blew me away.  Towards the end of the meal, we were both extremely stuffed but I needed to go with this.

Had a great deal, too bad it wasn't really a deal.I guess we went is here expecting much better service than we received, after all it is Smith and Wollensky. It started off great with a nice greeter at the door but then went down hill from there. The waiters seemed to play the part of catering to fine dining, but I would say that I did not feel the same attention as the other non-restaurant week diners. Our server was quite filthy his uniform was not very clean (to be nice), but his attention to our table was lacking. I waited 10 minutes before my iced tea and bread was put onto our table. This was a little off-setting because all the other tables around us had drinks and bread on their table before their appetizers arrived, as for my table we received our bread and my drink after the appetizers were set on our table.We ordered the fried calamari, a ceasar salad, surf and turf, grilled salmon.The calamari was not done well, the breading was all over the place and falling off as we picked up pieces. The ceasar salad was okay. The steak in my surf and turf was perfect cooked and my lobster was a little over done. However my girlfriend's salmon was well underdone. The salmon was raw at the thickest parts of the meat. I expected better than that from this establishment. For dessert we had the cheesecake and a slice of coconut cake with vanilla icecream. The cheesecake was a bit tart with lemon and the coconut cake was great, although I personally am not a fan of dried shredded coconut. Felt a bit disappointed in our experience because we felt as if we were catered to differently because we were participating in restaurant week and maybe not paying as much for our lunch. But honestly it's not like we don't have the coin, just figured we'd participate in the week to find out if we'd go again. But the combination of misfired service and food coming out without any kind of fine dining consistency, my girlfriend and I will probably elect to spend our dollars elsewhere.",2,0,0,Jason C.,"Queens, NY",16,411,38
3.0,8/10/2012,"I came here with my bf for restaurant week. I expected a lot more and felt it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Service- At first when we arrived our waiter pulled the table for me so I can get into the inside seat. I thought that was pretty cool because usually at other restaurants I have to squeeze between two tables to get into the inside. However once I notice his uniform I wasn't as happy. His uniform was kind of dirty and I didn't want to imagine if the restaurant was cleaned or not. It wasn't just his uniform, it was most of their waiters uniform. When we arrived at the table, the wine menu was already on the table. He didn't seem so happy when we said we didn't want any wine. In addition, he thrown the restaurant week menu on the table. He didn't explain anything on the menu to us. I realize that maybe we were getting food from this place for a cheaper rate. However I don't think that this is a reason to give us less than usual service. He did come by to check on us and when he brought our food, he did warn us that the plate is going to be hot. But that about it.Food- My bf ordered the Surf and Turf. It came with the lobster and steak. I order the grilled salmon. The lobster and the steak was pretty good. The steak especially was really good. It was so juicy and the juice squirted in your mouth as you chew it. I was disappointed by my grilled salmon. I asked for grilled salmon, not raw salmon. The ends of my salmon was really good. However when it got to middle of the salmon, it was raw. Only a little of the top and the bottom of the salmon was cooked. The middle of the salmon was all raw. I don't like eating raw fish and I didn't like the fact that it was raw in the middle. I thought that it was going to come fully cooked. We ordered the coconut cake with vanilla ice cream and cheesecake for dessert. The cheesecake had a lime favor and it wasn't very good. I thought it was a little bitter for cheesecake. I thought it was going to be sweet but it was a little bitter. The coconut cake with vanilla ice cream was pretty good. The coconut was a bit much, I like the cake and the vanilla ice cream but I thought the coconut pieces was a little too much. Overall, I think this is a one time experience. I wouldn't go back and pay their prices for this restaurant. I don't think this restaurant is worth the prices they set.",1,0,0,Leila Y.,"Woodside, NY",9,173,101
4.0,8/7/2012,Came here for the RW. Definitely worth the price for the lovely steak! I had a medium filet mignon for entree and it's good and tender with the great steak sauce. Also the fried calamari for appetizer and coconut cake with vanilla ice cream for dessert. Both were very good and enjoyable. My friend also ordered the filet mignon. She had split pea soup for starter and it was good according to her. Her cheesecake was decent. Very very full after the 10 oz steak!,2,0,2,Wini W.,"Kew Gardens Hills, Queens, NY",9,12,9
4.0,8/7/2012,"I came here for an event and I must say the waitstaff did an excellent job here.  I love steak personally and got a medium rare filet mignon here.  They cooked it a bit more than medium rare but I was 100% cool with that.  I had the blue cheese on top of it as well.  It was ok, but not really worth anything extra or it didn't really make a difference to me, I just unfortunately got a small piece of steak than everyone else.  Filet Mignon with Roquefort is what it was called.  Good steak though I must say. Hash browns were great on the plate as well and so was the Spinach.  This place is definitely a well known steakhouse here in New York, glad I finally got to check the place out after passing by the place so many times.  -Also, got to sample some of the sample some of the appetizers.  My group got the Crab Cakes, Calamari and Salad.  Great selections to try from each one.  The Calamari alone is worth another trip back here.  Desserts were pretty amazing as well.  Trays were passed around family style for our group of 40-50 people.  Cheesecake was my favorite.-The upstairs area was pretty cool.  We were here for a Johnny Walker event so at first there was some wait around time and I got one of the Irish stout at the bar.  Excellent choice too, that was $8 well spent.",2,0,5,Jordan W.,"Bronx, NY",1532,1252,4031
3.0,8/7/2012,"When I came here four years ago, it was my absolute favorite, but since then I've been here twice and both times have been disappointing. My most recent trip was for restaurant week lunch. First, I will say that the restaurant week lunch is a great deal. Appetizer, steak, and dessert for $24? Yes, please! A filet mignon by itself usually costs more than that. However, I also believe that restaurants are selling an experience, and I left the place a little upset.First, the starters. I got the calamari and my boyfriend got the split pea soup. Both were mediocre. Not much to say about them. We also got an order of fries on the house, which was nice of them, but it was really confusing because they just left it on the table without telling us anything, and when we asked about it they made me feel really stupid.Next, the steaks. We both ordered the filet mignon, but mine was medium rare and his was rare. We're not the most experienced steak eaters, so it took us half a steak to realize that our steaks had been switched. The steak they gave me was definitely rarer, and to me, kind of dry. His was much juicier - I liked it a lot better, and he liked mine a lot better - but since he had eaten most of his, I ended up eating something like 3 oz of a steak I didn't like and 1.5 oz of a steak that I did like. Yes, we should have realized that our steaks were switched earlier, but it was the waiter's job to ensure that we got the correct steaks in the first place! I was pretty unhappy after the steaks, and also disappointed that nobody gave me a chance to point out what happened (all the waiters literally came and dropped something off and left - no solicitation at all). Finally, the desserts. I thought the pecan pie was too sweet. The chocolate mousse cake was pretty good, although I would have preferred more mousse and less cake - it was a tad bit dry. The whipped cream that came with it was delicious.Service was also not on par with what I've come to expect. Even though we went relatively early and there were many tables open, we were seated next to a really loud table. I'm sure the maitre d' had a reason (maybe it was just that we were dressed casually?) but my boyfriend and I both felt condescended to by the maitre d'. And of course, our waiter screwed up our order. So overall, I still feel kind of sad when I think about this meal. It was the one I was most looking forward to during restaurant week, and it ended up being the biggest flop.",0,0,0,Danielle Z.,"Manhattan, NY",1,82,0
4.0,8/6/2012,"My friend and I went here for NYC RW lunch.  Our experience was very positive compared to the recent yelp reviewers.To start off, we ordered the calamari and split pea soup.  Both were very both good but my friend said the split pea soup is a tad bit colder for his taste. Entrees - my friend ordered the 14oz dry-aged sirloin and I ordered the Surf and Turf - they were both an additional $10.  My friend is a big steak eater and he said the steak was so good that the fat on the steak melts in his mouth when he eats it.  This is a guy that is so health conscious that he normally cuts the fat off but he ate the entire steak including the fat!  My entree - the surf and turf - the filet mignon is supposed to be 5oz but the portion is closed to 8oz (not complaining at all) and lobster tail was well cooked.  I enjoyed my meal! Side: We ordered cream of spinach and I LOVED it.  I think this may be the best cream of spinach I ever had... Dessert - I was so stuffed that I got my dessert to go - may update later after I eat it.  My friend ordered coconut cake with vanilla ice cream.  I had a bite and it was decent.  Our waiter was not very tentative but the other waiters catered our table to fill the gaps.  Kudos to the staff for chipping in!  Overall, I find this RW lunch deal as a bargain and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience!Edit: I don't know why people are complaining about the shapes of the lemon... they are cut that way so you don't get any seeds...",3,0,2,Michelle C.,"Hoboken, NJ",495,114,4416
1.0,8/6/2012,"My sister and I had dinner here last night, as part of Restaurant Week.  SERVICE -- our waiter was bad.  no bread plates, never refilled our water or asked how our meal was.  I understand that waiters receive less tip money during restaurant week, but if you're going to give people poor service when they order off the RW menu, the restaurant should not be participating in it at all.  The point is to get new customers to come to the restaurant, but if you're going to turn them off with bad service, then it's the restaurant's loss.The only thing good about the service was Justin, the manager.  He came over to ask us if it was our first time dining there, where we were from, and declared Smith & Wollensky to be the best steak place in the city, etc etc.  He brought over a complimentary creamed spinach and came over to ask how our meal was.FOOD -- Not good.  Ceasar salad was slightly below average with not much flavor.  We both ordered the sirloin, thinking that if they were going to charge an extra $10, it must be better than the filet.  The steak had no flavor -- I seriously think they forgot to put salt & pepper.  Also, the two sirloins looked different - my sister's had grill marks whereas mine had no color and looked pretty gross.  Complimentary creamed spinach, while nice that it was free, was also kinda gross.  Dessert - cheesecake had a lemon-flavor to it (not terrible), and the chocolate mousse cake was good.  Cappuccino for $7.25 was overpriced and bitter.For $140, it wasn't worth it.  I've always wanted to try this place but will not come back.  Del Frisco's is a thousand times better - both for service and food - along with Peter Luger's and Capital Grille (I went for RW a couple weeks ago and it was fantastic).  Sparks is just ok (service not great either, unless you like being waited on by 70-year old slow and grouchy men )",2,0,0,Melissa D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,12,2
2.0,8/5/2012,"Not all Restaurant Week experiences are built the same. Let me start off by saying portions are not a problem at Smith and Wollensky - not even during Restaurant Week. The filet mignon was definitely a generous plenty. Unfortunately, both orders came back a little overcooked for Medium Rare. The mixed green salad appetizer could have been straight out of a Dole pre-made baggie  I glumly shuffled the radishes while taking a nibble here and there. We ordered the creamed spinach as a side to split & my dining companion remarked that it had the consistency of baby food - more like puree. It's not something I would order again - especially since it costs $13. The desserts were hefty size. My coconut cake had a lot of frosting but wasn't enough coconutty enough to suit my (seemingly fickle but not really) tastes. Service was not outstanding. It was a busy Wednesday night and it took more than one attempt to get the waiter's attention.  I did like the fresh floral arrangements on the 2nd floor.

1.0,8/5/2012,"We were greeted by the matre d and was told to go up to the second floor where we were seated near the corner, I guess I'm fine with that. The bread was served first by this Asian chubby dude. He did not greet us but just place the bread on the table. I had to asked for my water. He then didn't even brought out the regular menu to us but gave us the restaurant week menu. He did not explain the specials or asked us if we had any questions about the menu. I mean I don't want to be racist here, now I preferred to be served by any race other than my own. He was impolite and acted as if we don't have enough money to pay off the regular menu. I mean I looked around and he gave this other table a regular menu while he gave us a restaurant week menu. Afterwards, he came over and asked us what we wanted. After we ordered, he asks us do we want sides and just listed out to us from what he remembered and he told us that the Mac and cheese was good so we ordered that on the side. The appetizer came fast and he just threw it on the table like a fast good restaurant. I don't like being treated this way especially at a high class restaurant. The calamari was okay. I felt like they just threw it in the fryer and that place it on the plate. He got the Cesar salad, which was just plain salad drizzle with cheese. The portion was somewhat big but the quality is only average. The chubby waiter didn't even come back afterwards to asked us how we are doing or refilled our water. We had two other girls seated next to us, I was hoping that they will be assist by the chubby waiter but my wishdidn't come true. I really want to see will they be treated differently because they weren't Asian. They were greeted by another waiter whom made them felt welcome and asked them are they coming to do restaurant week instead just throwing the menu at them. The sirloin was juicy and the filet mignon was rough and dried. The meats are not anything like wow. To top it off, there was no meat presentation. The Mac and cheese tastes like something I can get at smac. The best part of the meal was dessert but eh I like anything that is sweet though. :/ I'm sorry I wont come back here or recommend it to others.

The food was not good by the way. The sirlion I ordered was burnt.  It took 20 minutes to get my check. I would not go here if you want great service.

4.0,8/5/2012,"I visited Smith & Wollensky this evening while on a trip to New York. While planning for the evening, I made the mistake of thinking that Smith & Wollensky offered their Restaurant Week menu. However, despite the fact that it was a Saturday night, they were kind enough to offer the RW menu. The three starters we chose were the pea soup, the soup de jour (which was gazpacho), and the calamari. All three were quite delicious, but as the calamari was just a tad too chewy, both of the soups won this round.For the main entree, all of us ordered the filet mignon. Oh. My. Gosh. We were all quite enraptured with our entrees! The mean was so tender that it melted in your mouth, and the cut was absolutely perfect! To top it off, we were given potato dish on the house.Dessert was good. We ordered the Coconut Cake, Pecan Pie, and the Cheesecake. All of them were pretty good and a great way to end the meal.However, it's the service that really sets this place apart from anywhere else. The staff went out of their way to accommodate us, despite the fact that it was our mistake.

More like tower of creamy cheesy and bright tomato-ey goodness. This was more like an entree than an app.And my colleagues were equally impressed by their meals (all from the RW menu) - there was crab cakes, filet mignon, calamari, salads and gazpacho, all followed by some form of ridiculously portioned dessert (coconut cake, bourbon pecan pie and chocolate cake). I watched them in envy and bookmarked the desserts for future consumption.FYI - the desserts are all laid out on a cart in the middle of the main dining room for hungry eyes to, well, eye.

WE also ordered a cheese cake and the chocolate mousse cake. The cheese cake was good, but it looked like someone bit or cut the tip off, the chunk missing was quiet large, and it was missing the strawberry, like the others had (so the presentation was terrible). The chocolate cake sucked completely. The area upstairs, where we set, was loud and cramped, like at some cafeteria.

Granted I work in finance and make a decent living, I felt like the host took one look at me, saw that I wasn't wearing a suit, just business casual, and just kind had this smug arrogant attitude on me as I waited for my friends. Then we were seated upstairs in the corner when clearly there were empty tables throughout the restaurant. As I noticed throughout the night, the corner was filled with Asians. Are they racist? I have no idea but maybe it was just a coincidence. Got the Calamari and Mixed salad for appetizers. It was ok. Portions are large. For steak, I got the dry age sirlion. Steak seemed like it was bought from a vending machine or a local grocery. I can buy a steak at Trader Joe's and there will be more meat on it than there is fat than what I got at this ""steakhouse."" Still the steak was tasty but for $45? No thanks. And what's up with the waiters bringing out all the steaks at once on ONE PLATE, and dishing out the steaks on individual plates afterwards? Talk about lazy, unprofessional and really grimey service. I saw one of the waiters actually take the spoon from the cream spinanch at someone else's table and used it to put the steak's on the individual plates and then proceeded to put the spoon back in the cream spinach. I feel bad for any vegeterians that were eating the cream spinach. Highlights for food: Hash browns and chocalate mousse cake were fantastic. As we were trying to figure out the tip 4 ways, the waiters kept hounding us about it, when in fact we were taking our time, trying to engage in conversation. The waiter was rude enough to even tell us I can figure it out for you. Ummm buddy, LEAVE US ALONE AND RESPECT OUR SPACE. I will never come back here.

5.0,7/8/2012,"I could go on and on about how wonderful this steakhouse is. I've been to several (but not all) of the other top steakhouses in New York, but I really don't have much of an interest in going to the other ones after having gone here. First and foremost, the food is incredible. I'm not a big meat eater and I often go a week without eating any meat whatsoever. I was also never a fan of steak until I came to this place. The same with my mother-in-law. She never liked steak, but now she says she'll eat it again.... at Smith & Wollensky. I always order the filet mignon and it's consistently delicious. And the steak sauce is incredible. It's the perfect balance of sweet and salty. I put it all over my hash browns whenever I go there. The desert is also amazing. I would go back there just for a desert. They have mostly American classics like peanut butter chocolate cake (I'm drooling just thinking about it) and coconut cake. They do a great job with all their food. I've never disliked anything I've tried. The second thing that keeps me going back there is how down-to-earth and friendly the staff are. My husband and I are just two average Joes living in New York. We're not broke ass and we have fairly decent jobs, but we definitely don't look like hot shots or huge spenders. But the staff at Smith and Wollensky is so friendly and not snooty whatsoever. We only go there on special occasions, but some of the staff recognize us and say hi. The restaurant is classy and looks expensive, but the down-to-earth atmosphere makes it a very comfortable dining experience. A lot of high-quality restaurants in New York have waiters who act like they're doing you a favor by serving you and who are just rude. It's like restaurants think that by having the staff be complete dicks to the guests, everyone will think their food is great because they don't have to win you over with kindness to get business. That was why I was initially so surprised by how since the staff was at Smith & Wollensky since their steakhouse is one of the best in New York. All in all, I think this restaurant's employees are some of the most professional staff I've ever had a New York restaurant. Never once have I encountered a rude employee-- even on the phone.

We had no problem with the service.We each ordered a filet mignon. I had the plain one, my husband had the one with blue cheese and my brother in law had the one with stuffed crabs.I think I might be a little bit of a snob when it comes to good steak since I frequent places such as Wolfgang's and Peter Lugers and honestly this place is no match to them.

1.0,6/25/2012,"Please read this completely, because there are some positives.I second the review by Lauren B.With not much choice in the area on a Sunday night we went in there wanting some good steak. We sat at the bar area to be in a more quiet space. The waiter came over with an attitude that translates to ""whadya want? wine, steak, what?"" I asked for a taste of the house cab blend, which I didn't care for much. After serving it he took away the wine list - what if I didn't like it? Anyway, I asked for something else and also ordered the food at the same time. We got a Filet Mignon and Asparagus. No sooner, he vanished from serving us so I pretty much called out to anyone who was ready to listen and serve. One of the guys who brought out the bread was really nice. I then asked one of the young hostesses something about the steak and the young guy from the bar came over and was also most helpful and friendly.By now, I had been assisted by 4 different people. Lastly the manager came over to ask if we wanted anything - I asked for a glass of wine. He very kindly brought it over and said ""this is on us"" (major plus points here but it won't affect the star rating.The food was sub par, the only thing good there was the free bread! So I can't tell you to go for the food, but you will get decent service at the bar. I can say that I will never go back with my own free will, however, if I had to meet someone there who actually liked the food I will be taken care of after I made good with the people who were kind enough to treat me like a paying customer.

Nothing was particularly good or bad, but given its iconic standing in NYC and reputation as one of the city's best steakhouses, I was really quite disappointed. Our waiter was a strange mix of jovial and condescending. From ""if you need anything, don't hesitate to call me over"" to ""$145 for a bottle of wine IS cheap to me; if you don't think so, I don't know what to say."" Bipolar much?We had the shrimp cocktail and tomato& mozzarella as appetizers. They were fine; nothing special to report. For entrees, all of us had the sirloin. My steak was cooked perfectly medium rare, so points to them on that. We got the following sides: hash browns, creamed spinach and wild mushrooms. They were alright as well.Surprisingly, their desserts are pretty good. The carrot cake was a big hit in our group and the coconut cake was delicious as well. It's a huge slice of cake; unless you have a huge sweet tooth, it'd be a good dish to share. In conclusion, S&W is like a sub par version of Peter Luger IMO (even their steak sauce)...

4.0,5/18/2012,"I went here last night for a Johnnie Walker tasting event.  We weren't quiet sure where to go at first but ultimately we followed the crowd and wound up upstairs, where there is a separate dining room, another bar, and extra restrooms.  The staff quickly seated us in the separate dining room.  We thought this would only be a tasting with whiskey and not much else, but once we were seated, there was a menu laid out in front of us.  Three apps to choose from, three entrees, family-style sides, and dessert.  We all shared knowing glances because we knew we were in for a treat.Once the tasting officially began, the waiters took our orders.  I had the crab cake for my app and it was REAL crab, not that imitation crap they give you in other places.  For my entree, I of course had the filet mignon because 1) I typically hate steak but 2) it was free!  I asked that they cook it medium rare (if you get yours well done, go ahead and de-friend me on here) and it was cooked perfectly.  Red, juicy, still mooing....Okay skip that last part.  The creamed spinach looked good but I have an issue with pureed anything so I skipped it.  The hashed browns were very tasty and seasoned to perfection.  The asparagus was huge!  So yummy.After going through a few more samples of JW, they brought out a tray of dessert for each table.  There was pecan pie, cheesecake, chocolate cake, and carrot cake....As well as some fresh fruit.  I normally hate carrot cake but theirs was very tasty.  The chocolate was a bit too much for me since I lack a sweet tooth.  The pecan pie was perfect.  They did a great job at handling a group of 30-40 people in a smaller room, who were all there to drink whiskey and have a good time.  I was impressed with the service.  The only reason I removed a star is because they almost poured me the same whiskey twice (normally this isn't an issue but each glass needed to be kept clean before the whiskey was poured, as to not affect the taste) and they popped blue label in the freezer instead of gold label.  Big no-no, even though it tasted fine, anyway.I would love to come back here one day....But only if someone else pays.  I was spoiled last night because it was all free!",9,1,4,Kristy R.,"New York, NY",421,1576,174

4.0,4/5/2012,"This review is for Wollensky's Grill (not sure why it doesn't appear as a separate restaurant on Yelp)So it was a Sunday afternoon and my boyfriend and I were craving burgers. With this spot only a short walk away, we decided to give it a try. I thought it was a great weekend lunch spot, particularly if you can get seated near the windows on a sunny day. It has a much lighter and airier feel than the stodgy and clubby dinning rooms in Smith and Wollensky (not to say that's bad, I actually quite like it for an evening meal). The crowd seemed to be a lot of rich old people, many of whom appeared to be regulars and knew all the waitstaff, this gave it a pretty interesting atmosphere. I started lunch with a Caesar salad, which although nothing amazing, was good. Fresh crispy romaine lettuce, crunchy croutons and an appropriate amount of dressing (one thing I miss are the anchovies, why does nobody put them on Caesar salads any more?). The burger was quite impressive. Incredibly thick and juicy, it was among the most flavorful burgers I have ever had. The interesting thing was, while I was eating it, I merely thought it was a good burger. However, after I left and as the day progressed, I kept thinking about it. And thinking about it. And thinking about it. I'm really hard pressed to think of a better burger that I've had and now hold it up as one of the best burgers that I've had. The fries were good as well, very crispy and not too greasy done more in the stile of frites. I actually wish they gave more, they come in a little paper cylinder and they pull a little trick by putting an elevated bottom in so you think you have a lot more than you actually do. Another nice touch was the somewhat spicy pickle relish they included on the side of the burger, very good. One of the low points during our meal was the service. It wasn't bad or slow, the best way to describe it would be confused. I guess servers don't have assigned tables or something, but it seemed that there were two or three different people (who didn't really seem to communicate with each other) taking care of us. At one point, after a server had already taken our credit cards and the bill another server came over and asked if we had already eaten.

The steak was really nice, just a bit charred which is kinda typical when you get order well done, and definitely a hearty portion. The baked potato was massive and delicious (they give you bacon bits, green onion, sour cream and grated cheddar to load it up).

Around the table, we ordered lobster tail (which i didn't taste, but it was reported a bit on the salty side), filet mignon (2) and bone-in sirloin. The meats were cooked correctly and the portions were generous, but the quality just wasn't there. Both filets had to be sawed at with a steak knife for each bite and were only slightly more tender than my sirloin. I feel like the waiter put out their steak sauce because he knew they would be on the dry side (all three of us ended up using the stuff). I normally would not be this tough on a hearty and generally good-tasting meal, and the food wasn't terrible, but I always view restaurants with a slant towards their value to quality ratio.

2.0,2/3/2012,"My review is comparing Smith & Wollensky to other pricey steakhouses.  As a steakhouse, Smith & Wollensky is nothing special, and actually sub-par in my opinion.  Once the steak has reached a certain quality, it's all about the atmosphere and the service.  The front of the house is decent, but the waitstaff surprised me.  We had a waiter and a busboy/second waiter, both with such heavy Chinese accents, they were hard to understand.  They also didn't understand us very well.  When my friend asked the difference between the NY sirloin and the sirloin, the waiter hesitated and muttered something about the size.  We asked if the bone-in steak could be served cut and he pointed out a different steak and said ""no bone"".  He couldn't even explain the difference in the sizes of the steaks.  We gave up asking anything and just decided on our own.  I looked over at the waiter for the table near us, and his shirt was partially untucked with a huge belly hanging out of his open jacket, which looked very dirty, and he had his long tie dragging all over everything on the table.  I also got the feeling we were being rushed out, because our waiter kept hovering over us as we were finishing up, and hovering again once we got our check.  We split 3 cards, and he only gave us one pen, so how fast did he expect us to finish?  In all, it was very good food, but it was very expensive for such low class service.  If you're looking for a steakhouse dinner, go elsewhere.",0,0,0,J D.,"ROOSEVELT ISL, NY",0,14,0

We shared the seafood banquet that was decent with huge shrimp, lobster and yummy crab meat. It was somewhat disappointing that it didn't include some oysters on the half shell, however. For our entries, she had lamb chops while I had a Colorado aged ribeye (rare, of course). My goodness, the steak was heavenly. They age their steak for 21 days on site, which you can definitely taste. We also shared a delectable truffle mac and cheese, so incredibly rich and creamy. We finished the meal off with an excellent, moist slice of coconut cake.I have changed my mind regarding Smith & Wollensky. It is an excellent place to dine.

The service, however, was entirely something else.Our waiter was rude, crass, and unprofessional.  When you walk into a restaurant, you are to be handed two menus, one for Restaurant Week and one for the regular menu.  He asked us if we were doing RW, and when we said yes, he crudely snatched the RW menu which was a flimsy piece of oaktag from another couple's table complete with splotches of spaghetti sauce and handed it to us.He didn't even bother explaining which sides the house was offering, and when we asked, he answered in such a condescending way that told us he really couldn't be bothered with our time.  Not once did he even come to our table to ask us if we needed anything, or if we were enjoying our meal.I don't care if you're busy.  I don't care if you have a million things to do.  I don't even care that you feel customers who come during RW are unworthy of your attention.  You are here to do your job right, and you are here to make them feel welcome.  Neither of which we experienced that afternoon.For a restaurant that I've been wanting to try for years, especially after being featured in The Devil Wears Prada, I am severely disappointed.The waiter's name is B.

The good news is that when I called it to the attention of the waiter, Nick (I chose not to send it back, and only asked him to please let the kitchen know), he took me seriously, practically begged me to let him make me another one and in the end told us to get whatever we wanted for deserts...on him.  Well handled.Not sure I'll go back, though I'll probably want to give them another shot since its still a great room to have a steak and a glass of wine.",0,0,0,Alan F.,"Washington, DC",0,11,0

I said: Hi, I'm suppose to meet a friend here, I have a dinner reservation at 7, and I think my friend already hereHe asked: Okay, where is your friend?First of all, let me STOP HERE and point it out what he did wrong. When I said I have a dinner reservation at 7, your response suppose to be ""sure, may I have your name PLEASE"" OR "" Yes, can you please tell me your name and let me check for you"" You are in a public relation, at least put a little effort into your job and tried to help your paying customers!! I said: I think she already here, can you check? My name is Kenny He said: Check the bar area, she probably there.Second of all, please once again, ALLOW ME to point out what he did wrong AGAINI ASKED you to CHECK MY reservation and see my friend is there, and you pointed me to the barHere is a little tip: Your answer should be ""Yes, I see your reservation here, but normally we don't seat the party till everyone arrive, perhaps you might like to check the bar area and see your friend is there""?

First, the service wasn't great, just enough to suggest that the waiter had acknowledged our presence and was game to take our money. Next, my tomato and buffalo mozzarella appetizer had come straight from the refrigerator, so the tomato was partially frozen and the cheese was tasteless. Meanwhile, the dessert - an apple tart with ice cream - was similarly bland.Fortunately, my NY cut sirloin was tasty, but this is a steakhouse and it shouldn't be anything less.

It took a while before our waiter came over and gave us menus so we just sat there staring at each other for a while. I ordered the filet mignon and my husband ordered the prime rib. We got baked potatoes and I got a glass of wine. The bread selection was really good. We ate nearly the entire basket pretty fast. I loved how everything had the restaurant name on it, even the napkins and the cover over the butter. Our food came out in a decent amount of time. The restaurant seemed pretty crowded from where we were sitting. When they rolled out of the serving cart, I couldn't believe the size of my husbands steak. It was huge. Everything was good. I ate my filet with and without their house steak sauce, which was very good. The baked potato was big enough to break a window with. We planned to get dessert but were just too full after our meal.

Also ordered the calimari for an appetizer.  The presentation was horrible.  The dough was either falling off the meat or they were all bunched up together.  Looked more like a leftover onion bloom.  Definitely did not live up to the expectation of an upper class steakhouse!",0,0,0,Kiu W.,"Flushing, NY",0,6,0

We were seated right away and got our water and bread quickly.Yum to the bread - there were a few different kinds in the basket but I only tried (and loved) the crusty Italian one!I barely had to look at the menu because I was only interested in one thing - filet!In addition for the RW menu, I got the Caesar salad and coconut layer cake with vanilla ice cream.The salad was good but nothing special - I am sure the RW portion was smaller, but I would not have wanted to pay the normal $12-13 for it!With the other two courses, we decided not to get a side, but in retrospect, I probably would have gotten one to go with the steak, since I saved half to take home anyways.My steak came out cooked rare, for the most part, a tad too done on the ends but still tasty. For a (normally) $45 steak, I expected more. It was good, just not one of the top 3, or maybe even 5, that I've had. I actually almost enjoyed it more left over for lunch the next day.Dessert was good but the ice cream with the coconut cake was a little strange - I would have expected a premium ice cream but this one didn't taste like it. Service was pretty good - we were cheap and stuck with the RW menu - no drinks, no sides, etc. I don't think our server docked us for that; he had a lot of tables to wait on but checked on us and got us our food/bill timely. He wasn't exactly warm and fuzzy, but none of these styles of steakhouses have that. Overall, I enjoyed the meal and would come back for RW again; but probably not for full price.

My boyfriend described the experience as ""a huge lunchroom"" of sorts. The service and presentation is what brought down the entire dinner. The service was really poor, water wasn't being refilled until it was asked, the waiter ""dissapeared"" and the presentation of the food on the plate was like a ""second though"". The dishes were being brought out on a push cart, and someone pushed the cart practically next to our table, 3inches from touching.. while waiters took the food and served it to someone 3 tables down. Very unprofessional.The lemons on my calamari dish looked like they were shaved left over pieces...it's funny if you look at the yelp user pics, there's a pic of 5 pieces of lemons all shaved in odd shapes. What the F is going on ?? Are they scrimping on the lemon?In terms of the steaks, it was a little overcooked past ""medium"". despite it's delicious seasoning and taste... i was curious why it was cooked the way it was, until another reviewer ""Steve"" mentioned it MIGHT have been pre-cooked!The worst is the cake. The cake was sliced in such lopsided way and the ice cream was practically falling from the dish. The steaks were just thrown onto the plate and they were plopped down on the table, as the waiter just left. Like ""tossed"" almost on the table.

Waiting in line for a table is a little lengthy as usual, but the bartenders will sling you drinks to keep you ""controlled"" and under comfort until you and your party will be seated. Something that I noticed however - most of the minorities (Yes, I'm bringing in stuff about races - I don't mean to flare up anything) were placed up top on the second floor, to be served by a seemingly large amount of Asian steak masters, who were skilled in their jobs to serve up steak. Just a recall of an odd memory, folks. Onto their steaks ... they are the best pieces of cow you'll enjoy in New York. Aside from Texas, they are the best in America. The appealing balance of both tenderness and spice in the dead cow's flank made my taste buds jump for joy as I consumed the whole 32 ounce steak. Hey, it was my 16th birthday - excusable to the fact that I enjoyed my pleasurable dining experience. The meat is accompanied by a state renowned steak sauce which even finds refuge in my home refrigerator.

3.0,6/25/2011,"When thinking of what follows the words ""Smith and"" , my mind sometimes wanders to ""Wesson"". Firearms aside, a quick flip of the W results in S&M. What does this have to do with Smith and Wollensky you ask? Well, I had an adult sized burger that was by far the highlight of the meal.  You might just loathe yourself and inflict countless depravities upon others if you don't order this burger. (And wind up having a few bites of the burger of the person you are dining with).So we dined at Wollensky's Grill, the around the block, back entrance, more casual and less pricey part of the famous S&W's. View my less pricey comment with a grain of salt: dinner for two still cost $100. At the Grill, you'll have access to the full menu from the steakhouse as , after all, both parts are pulling entrees out of the same kitchen.Keep in mind there are no real ""Smith"" or ""Wollensky"" founders of this establishment. According to the web site, the founder (who also founded TGI Friday's) chose the names randomly from the phonebook.We started by sharing the colossal lump crabmeat cocktail appetizer. Presented on a bed of ice, with fresh lemon and two sauces to dip (cocktail and a chipotle mayo), the meat was tasty but smaller than expected. Given the light nature of crab meat, you can easily find yourself in an arms race with your fellow diner if you share this dish. Up next was the house made Wollensky's burger. As noted earlier, this is an adult-sized burger for an adult appetite. Two hands can comfortably grasp the bulging bun as the first bite reveals a plethora of beefy juice. (When ordered medium). With USDA prime beef, dry aged on premises, I'd expect any byproduct of beef to be exceptionally good and was not disappointed.I do wonder why the typical onions, lettuce and tomato are included on the side, as if anyone would want to tamper with the pure beef taste of the burger by adding those accompaniments.The only add-on for me was a slice of melted American cheese.You'll get a small cup of fries with the burger. It's rare that I finish all my fries but I did here, mainly because there weren't that many to start with.None of the entrees come with a side so be prepared to augment your order with asparagus, baked potato , creamed spinach or hash browns.Service was amiable but having to ask for water refills was unexpected.

So fresh! Huge chucks of high quality crab meat served chilled on a huge plate of ice. No need to douse in sauce.The mac and cheese? Best mac and cheese I've ever had. Pasta shells baked with four types of cheese: perfect.The fillet mignon served with Roquefort? So enormous I had to eat it over two glorious meals. Every non-vegetarian should try this place at least once.,4,3,2,Saara H.,"Manhattan, NY",80,138,0

3.0,6/19/2011,If you don't care about spending a lot of money it is a great place...but I guess everything has a high price in the city that never sleeps.

The full menu is available there as well as some smaller items.

Just had a bad experience here on an early Saturday evening - Porterhouse first came out well done (we had ordered medium) and after we sent it back, the next one was served rare. We just lived with it.  On the plus side they have freshly grated horseradish on request.  The caesar salad was average at best, but the hash browns and asparagus sides were good.  We were sitting next to a table of 2 older growling men and 2 older women who got very drunk and ended up fairly boisterous, with it ultimately seeming like a hooker situation.  Not such a nice way to enjoy a meal.  The other time I ate here was a Friday night, and it was great: filets were nice quality and cooked perfectly, hash browns were delicious, ceasar salad very tasty, fun time at the bar while waiting for table - all was well.  The other guests seemed like local business people, not NJ guidos out with their hookers.  I conclude the place is hit and miss, and maybe it's a day-of-the-week thing, with more tourist-level quality on Saturdays.",4,0,0,Wendy G.,"Greenville, SC",76,238,99

Our waiter, Michael, was a knockaround guy that was really helpful and attentive.  He, too, was a native NY'er and when he saw I wasn't any of the above mentioned type of customers, he opened up and was joking and very cool.  I was taken aback because the wine menu was enormous and the menu itself was in a picture frame.  I found it almost intimidating in a way, making me feel like Mark and Stacey in ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"".  We ordered the calamari for openers with the special Lobster/Crab/Shrimp cocktail for 2.  The calmari was good, a tad greasy, but I enjoyed the marinara.  The giant seafood cocktail was delicous.  It was cold, but the shellfish was fresh and tasty.  The shrimp were friggin' huge!  They were like sausages from the sea. My wife and I ordered the specialty: NY Cut Sirloin on the bone.  I had mine covered in Bleu Cheese.  The steak was cooked perfectly and was tasty as hell.  It was a thick cut and I couldn't have asked for a better meal.However, the true victory of the meal was my dessert: Peanut Butter Chocolate layer cake. Yes, I'm a peanut butter whore and that makes me partial to such things.  I housed it immediately.  As my wife asked for a taste, I felt the urge to growl at her and bare my teeth.  But I was nice and shared, especially as I snagged a piece of her delicously moist carrot cake.  Why 4 stars instead of 5?  Well, I have yet to try the likes of other steak houses and I don't want to be a fanboy right off the bat.  Also, the staff was supposed to sing ""Happy Birthday"" to me and they did not.  Although I personally did not care for that, my wife was upset because she specifically asked for it when making reservations.  She became embarassed when my cake came out, sans song, and then saw the staff sing to 2 others in the restaurant.  When she complained, I will say that the head waiter and staff did right by us.  I guess it was the receptionist's fault.

I normally always get the porterhouse when I go to a nice steakhouse but this time I decided to get a filet mignon (on the restaurant week menu). I was a little disappointed with the steak only because I was expecting PETER LUGAR type of steak. I did like the steak it was just not as good as I expected it. I kind of regret on not getting the porterhouse because I feel like I'd like that a lot more and probably would've gave a higher rating as well. The waiter actually comped my check because I'm a concierge and I've been still recommending people here. I would definitely go back next time to try the porterhouse and give it another rating.

Compared to the other top steak houses, Smith seems lackluster, providing a resigned ""eh.."" while you're dreaming of the char of Peter Luger and the desirable ratio of Deliciousness/Price of Wolfgang.

The Prime-rib & the porter House were both very good & large cuts of meat - moist, tender & just the right amount of seasioning. It was a meaty meal. The sides of mushroom, hash browns were OK - nothing special or perhaps, I was just concentrating too much on the meat.

The red wine (Napa Valley) that we did have was recommended by our server & was light - perfect for lunch (working lunch especially) - but went well with the meat.& then we got desert...(Don't ask me how I could still have the appetite...)We got the chocolate & peanut butter cake, which was not too bad + the profiteroles, which was fresh & pretty good actually.Service was decent. The ambience was nothing special. Prices were steak house standard.All in all, a good experiece but not the best steak house.

Moved to a small table against the wall, upstairs...by a maite d clearly perturbed we asked for a change.  The curtains of the window were on my lap.  What really flamed me is that thereafter they put parties of 2 at mid room four top tables.  One had two tiny women eating like birds.  If you are taking clients to a steakhouse you need room on the table. Good oysters, crab meat, then my filet arrived.  Completely undercooked and worse, absolutely tasteless.  I mean this: no taste at all.  I took one bite, then another to confirm that it tasted like...nothing.   You'd think the waiter might see a full untouched steak on a customer's plate and inquire? No.  Cleared the table without a word.  It's Christmas season so I cut everyone some slack for the crowds etc. but I always hated the noise level in this place and the hockey game that is played around the coat check.  Not for me and not for my client dinners.  I just will not go to this madhouse again  ( I do ok the grill room for a late night beer and burger though).  You want the best steaks,  service in NYC and an atmosphere conducive to relaxing and conversing?  The go to to Harrys at Hanover Square.  Here I  give the 2nd star only for the good house cabernet and for admitting it was my fault for allowing my dinner to be booked here in the first place.  This place is for tourists.",1,0,0,Daniel D.,"New York, NY",0,6,0

I really wanted it cause I LOVE coconut but we were running late on time and skipped dessert. So, when I saw Smith & Wollensky's Coconut Cake on The Food Network's ""Best Thing I Ever Ate"" show. I knew I had to make a special trip there just for the cake. A $20 cab got me there. I ordered one coconut cake and one chocolate mousse at $11 a piece. Hopped in another $20 cab home salivating along the way. Finally reached home and took a bite of the much anticipated cake and .....blah. I can't believe this cake was featured on the show. It hardly tasted like coconut and the proportion of frosting to cake was totally off. I felt like I was eating just frosting when I really wanted cake. Supposedly they put rum in the cake to make it moist but I didn't taste it. Probably cause I didn't have much cake. LOL. The chocolate mousse was a bit better but still nothing to rave about. So, for you coconut lovers out there. Pass this cake up and head to CRUMBS bakery. They have the best TOASTED COCONUT cupcake. It even has a tasty vanilla custard surprise inside YUM!

Yes, I was embarrassed, but couldn't really do anything about it. Given we dropped $5000 that night, the restaurant didn't do much to deter us either.All in all, I think this place is better for tourists/visitors. Yes, it feels like a very traditional steakhouse, inside and out, with servers that are wearing steakhouse-like uniforms. But in terms of the food, there are places better (unless you want a filet mignon for which this place seems to have a more extensive menu - I don't know why, and I'm not a fan, so doesn't do much for me). That said, I think I was most impressed with the wine list - huge selection and surprisingly reasonable prices (esp compared to Strip House) - and the desserts.

He wanted to try Del Frisco's, I wanted to try Smith & Wollensky because I've seen cab commercials (and I've been to Del Frisco's already), and naturally I won. In summary, Smith & Wollensky is a very cookie cutter plain vanilla higher end steak house. It met exactly that expectation. The food was pretty good, but nothing special about the menu. Would I come back? Yes, if I was with work / client, or if a friend requested it. Would I voluntarily come here with a friend or on a date (with someone that loved steak), probably not. Now for details as to why Ambiance - felt very family like, but a little cookie cutter feel (what you'd expect from a chain) Service - Very good, if you asked for it. No customary how's the food (not being high maintenance, but just what I'd expect from this type of restaurant). Always felt like I had to ask for water refill also Food - warrants 4 stars. Started off with crab cakes, which were mediocre. Then main course was the Cajun flavored rib steak, which was delicious. If you like a little zest and spice to the steak, the flavor was amazing. The downside was after 5 minutes of eating the steak, the plate was covered in oil (from the Cajun seasoning), and became quite unpleasant to eat. Got side of hash browns, very crispy Wine: excellent selection. I personally got a bad choice in terms of my wine by the glass, but the restaurant has a very extensive wine list Price: What I'd expect from a high end steak house ($100-$120 per person for a normal non-extravagant meal) All in all - I came in with middle of the road expectations, and they were met.

My guess is around 12 ounces.  I ordered it medium rare, but, as expected, the middle was medium rare, and the rest was overcooked the closer you got to the edges.  Anyway, the filet tasted fine, but I could have done without the thick and salty gravy upon which the filet was sitting.  If there is a next time, I'd just opt for the regular filet without the accessories.Didn't have room for dessert, but it looked like they were massive too.  So, if you'd like a decent meal with massive portions, this is the place for you.",0,0,0,Richard K.,"San Francisco, CA",7,60,0

4.0,6/6/2010,"My wife & I came here during Restaurant Week to see how the original Smith & Wollensky compared to the one we'd eaten at in Johannesburg, South Africa (which has since closed down.) On one side we had a table of hedge fund managers on an expense account, on the other side an old man who must've been pretty important because the waiter promised him he could have anything he wanted on the house. The atmosphere was pleasant if slightly stuffy, certainly you wouldn't use words like cozy or romantic.Our waiter was so good that I could've easily believed he was dedicated to only our table. He seemed to appear just as we were about to need him as if by telepathy. He suggested a wine which was on special for NYRW, and it was a top notch selection. Most restaurants undercook steak so consistently that I've started always ordering 'medium well' when I mean 'medium'. But S&W bought our Filet Mignon's exactly how we ordered them.

5.0,4/17/2010,"We had an utterly, utterly memorable last night in New York thanks to this place. Thankfully we went to the grill rather than the main restaurant - it was the night before Thanksgiving and the place was absolutely buzzing. Our waiter was tall, blonde and totally charming and it was his fault that we ended up spending $450 on all the specials in the house! We shared the seafood platter to start - huge prawns, half a lobster and a crab with a mint sauce and a seafood sauce. I'm drooling just thinking of it. Then we all had a steak - chargrilled, beautiful. Steaks don't come with a sauce but the meat is so tasty that you don't need one. A tip - don't have the broccoli, as it costs $11 and it's just that - broccoli. We had an amazing time, and the fact that we accidentally spent all the money we had left just made it all the more memorable.

4.0,2/23/2010,"My overall review of the place can be summed up with: Good, but not great. The food was very good, but there was nothing in particular that I would say was excellent.

I was dying to get the crab cakes but they were on the expensive side so I refrained. The salad was good. Again, not the best I've ever had, but solid. For entree I ordered a Filet Mignon. Many on my table of 8 did too, with various au poivre and other toppings. I ordered mine plain and ate it plain. I enjoyed it. It was tender and cut like butter. One person got fish in party, I'm not sure what kind but she liked it.  We also ordered creamed spinach for the table which I loved, and tatered tots which I didn't (I don't ordinarily so I'm not one to ask) but the rest of my party raved about.  For dessert most of my party enjoyed the apple betty, while I got carrot cake and another the peanut butter chocolate cake. Mine was decent but her peanut butter chocolate layer cake was amazing. Service was also solid, good and attentive but not great. Decor was decent, but there were lots of strange paintings of topless women. To be honest, unless I was going there with a large group of people like I did this weekend, I probably wouldn't go back.

2.0,2/20/2010,"I came for Restaurant Week.  The feel of the restaurant is that old-school steakhouse feel.  It is pretty much a boys club, and if you are expecting pretty plates and cute decor, you are at the wrong steakhouse.  The service was pretty much the same as the decor- simple. It wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't over the top.  It's almost like since we went with the Restaurant Week menu, we were almost an afterthought to the server.The meal started with some bread on table, and I appreciated the ample amounts of butter and different kinds of loaves - raisin bread, salt bread and wheat bread.  This bread was all delicious.  For the first course, I had to choose between calamari, soup and salads, and I went with the caesar salad.  Wasn't too impressed with it - felt like there was a lack of dressing and the salad wasn't the freshest.  To be honest, I would much prefer the salad at the Outback Steakhouse instead.I came though for the steak, and the steak delivered.  The steak was phenomenal.  I had the filet, medium rare, and it melted in your mouth and was delicious.  The bernaise sauce on the side went well with it, but the steak was so good it didn't really need it.  If I put my value hat on though, I was disappointed the steak didn't come with any vegetables or even some polenta for crying out loud.  I mean come on it is Restaurant Week and you are seriously going to make me order some sides?...which we did.  Creamed spinach.  Eh.  Tasted really pureed.On to dessert.  I went with the hot apple betty.  If you work at Smith & Wollensky and are reading this, I highly recommend you swap out the vanilla sauce you paired with it, and put some vanilla ice cream instead since I love the hot/cold combination.  Regardless, my dessert was very good and I enjoyed it, but would have loved something cold to go with this hot treat.  Like everything else about the restaurant, the dessert was no frills - just a doughey pocket filled with apples, syrup and raisins.  And our server was kind enough to offer coffee and tea - after dessert was finished.As far as Restaurant Week goes, Smith & Wollenksy is a good value, but isn't anywhere close to one of our favorite steakhouses in the city.  My advice - if you are looking for steak, try somewhere else first.",2,1,0,Laura F.,"Cortlandt, NY",70,186,18

4.0,2/16/2010,"So I went back to Smith and Wollensky for the second time. I have been craving a great piece of prime rib and have read that Smith and Wollensky turned out a great one. There is actually a great article on the entire preparation here from the great and always helpful Beef Aficionado's blog: beefaficionado.blogspot.…...Before I get into more detail I also ordered:Lump crabmeat cocktail served with green (remoulade?) sauce and cocktail sauce- Absolutely delicious, simple. Generous lumps of jumbo crabmeat in a clam shell. It didn't even need any sauce that's how fresh it was. However, the sauces were terrific. I loved the green sauce, which was incredibly creamy and had a kick to it. The cocktail sauce was also delicious and sweet. When you combine the two together it really makes it a winner.Baked potato with the fixins- Since I was alone I didnt go for the hashed browns which is meant for two. I did have the hashed browns last time though were incredible. probably the best hashed browns I have ever had. I loved that they give you a baked potato ""caddy"" with sour cream, cheddar cheese, chives, and bacon. The baked potato is huge, probably close to 10 ounces and absolutely delicious.Sauteed mushrooms- Last time we had the creamed spinach and that was a huge letdown for me. I love creamed spinach yet it was the one of the worst I had ever had. Maybe it was just a bad day that day. This time I went with the sauteed mushrooms, which were delicious and proved to be a great choice.Dessert- One of my favorite things about S and Ws is the dessert cart. I LOVE that they wheel it over to your table and show you each dessert and explain in detail. That is something from the past, and I wish more restaurants would follow suit too! I love the interaction with the waiter, but more just being able to see delectable desserts is awesome. I was so full, so I skipped dessert kinda. I never really skip dessert. I just ordered it to go. I got their ""famous"" carrot cake and it was delicious. Famous for a reason and probably the best carrot cake I have eaten. Anyway back to the main event the PRIME RIB.On my first visit to S&W last year, I contemplated between the traditional prime rib and the Colorado Ribeye. I decided to go with latter, which turned out to be very good. I enjoyed my Colorado Ribeye very much, however vowed that I come back for that prime rib. So I decided to go for it and the prime rib was great too!I ordered it ""extra rare"" as I do with all steaks. The middle part was perfectly bloody red, while the thin outside layer was more well done (usually is with prime rib). The well done outermost layer is the only type of well done meat I actually enjoy. It has that extra salty, almost short rib like taste to play off of the truly rare and beefy flavor of the middle. The prime rib was served on the bone, and had just the right amount of marbelization. I loved their au jus and they sit the prime rib in a generous pool of it.My only criticism is that it was not larger. There also probably could have been a little more meat attached on the bone, which is one of my hugest criteria for a great prime rib. Nevertheless, I was still able to gnaw a nice amount of delectable prime rib off the bone. This is where it lags behind Old Homestead, Keens', and Strip House's prime rib. Old Homestead lists its behemoth prime rib at 32 oz on the menu. That thing is huge! Keens, not as large probably weighs in at 26-28 ounces. I'd say Strip House weighs in at about 26 ounces. Smith and Wollensky's rendition is closer to 20-22 ounces, which don't get me wrong is still a nice size but you don't get the same ""wow factor"" as from the aforementioned steakhouses. Since I requested extra rare, they had to cut mine from the middle of the roast. Perhaps this yields a smaller piece than the outside part of the roast? This I do not know for sure. However, I imagine that you could get inconsistent sizes since you are cutting from a whole roast. Anyway, in my first experience I did realize inconsistencies in the size of the steaks. So to conclude , the prime rib while delicious, is not the best in the city for me. Taste was on par, however size lacking. I rank it below OH and Keens. But definitely right in that next tier with Strip House's version.I really enjoyed the meal I had at Smith and Wollensky. The good experience I had with the ribeye the first time drew me back for the prime rib and it didn't disappoint. The service was exactly as you would expect. The food came out promptly, cooked as ordered, and piping hot. Two visits and two successes. That's really all it takes- It really does not take a lot to get a great grade from me. Smith and Wollensky is a quality steakhouse and it does what a steakhouse should do right, especially in a steakhouse. They have me as a repeat customer. Next is the porterhouse for two. The true judge of a steakhouse for me. If they pass my grade in that department, then I will be truly impressed.",0,0,1,G C.,"New York, NY",21,264,798

2.0,2/8/2010,"I came here with my girlfriend during restaurant week. First of all, I thought this place had a dress code, but I saw people with hoodies / jeans and sneakers. I guess I was misinformed.We both ordered from the Prix Fixe menu. I had fried calamari (appetizer), filet mignon with lobster tail (main course) and chocolate mousse cake (dessert) while my girlfriend had caesar salad (appetizer), grilled salmon (main course) and cheesecake (dessert). We had cream spinach on the side as well.First of all, our waiter was rude. His name is Juan, he didn't HAND us the Prix Fixe menu, he simply flung it on the table and walked away. I ordered my coke with lemon, he completely forgot about it. When I asked him for the lemon, he came back with chunks of lemon pieces which were very difficult to squeeze because of the way they were cut. I ended up getting lemon juice all over my hands.The fried calamari was pretty bad. I thought I ordered a plate of squid with crust on the side. The crust and the squid were completely separate. My girlfriend's Caesar salad wasn't impressive either.Then the main course came. I wanted my steak medium rare, but it was medium WELL, almost well done. I told one of the waiter, and he told me to cut the steak and checked the center. Indeed it was medium rare (ONLY AT THE CENTER). I have had steak at Peter Luger, Del Monico and Del Frisco and I never had this issue. Also the steak didn't have a lot of flavor. But I was really hungry and I didn't want to wait for another steak so I let it go. The lobster tail was quite ""interesting"". It tasted like a giant shrimp. Perhaps it WAS a giant shrimp. The cream spinach was too creamy and mushy. My girlfriend's salmon was okay at best. The cheesecake had a taste of lemon but not cheese. What's up with that?I will not come back and I won't recommend this restaurant to anyone.  I felt like I was eating at Applebee paying Del Frisco's price.",3,1,0,Brian L.,"New York, NY",46,19,7

My friends shared a porterhouse for two due to the abundant cut and serving of food. Our sides of creamed spinach, hash browns, and onion rings were amazing. Absolutely delicious!

2.0,2/7/2010,"After watching the movie ""The Devil Wears Prada"" in 2006, I decided to add 2 wishes to my bucket list: 1. Move and live in NY 2. Sample the tasty, savory and everlasting steak as featured in the movie at Smith and Wollensky Steakhouse Sequentially, in 2009, I moved to NY and this past weekend, had the opportunity to visit Smith and Wollensky. But after my meal last night, I'm glad I can now cross that off my bucket list and move on to better things. If you can recall the movie, Anne Hathaway's character had to fulfill two requests by her boss, Meryl Streep, in order to keep her job. 1- get a hold of the unpublished Harry Potter manuscripts and 2- purchase a steak from Smith & Wollensky within 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, her boss notices the steak and replies ""I don't want that!"" - I would have said this yesterday had I known. Now for the actual review - my parents decided to make use of their weekend and visit their youngest son. In return, I wanted to have (at least) one decent meal. Since it also happened to be Restaurant Week in NY, I discovered that S&W was participating and made a reservation for Saturday Night. My parents and I found the restaurant in no time and greeted by their host. I gave the name, time of the reservation and was directed to head upstairs to be greeted by another gentlemen. After checking our coats, we were promptly seated. I had my reservation for 6PM and somehow found ourselves seated next to their service door when, clearly, only half the tables were occupied? That definitely dampened my immediate experience but pushed to enjoy the moment! The waiter introduced himself and distributed the menus. After noticing the menu's were not affiliated with RW, I kindly asked if he could bring the RW menu. To my surprise, and in a sassy tone, he said ""they would have already been placed on the table."" Minus One Star. I do take partial blame for this incident because, while still being new to the idea of RW, should have noticed that Saturday Nights were not included. But sassy tone? Not necessary. Now, browsing through their regular menu, decided to order 2 steaks (Sirloin and Prime Rib), 1 - Alaskan Salmon, 1 - soup of the day and 1 - side. This was definitely a good amount of food. After sampling a good array of complimentary bread and butter, the bowl of Cream of Mushroom-eque type soup was served. Not sure how to describe it as it seemed to be a merged version of ""chicken noodle"" and ""cream of mushroom."" More importantly, it was a little cold and nothing special. Shortly after, the main entree was served. My Prime Rib was a generous piece while the Alaskan Salmon and Sirloin were decently sized. My Prime Rib was cooked at Medium and very tasty. But the Sirloin was ordered at Medium Well and came out beyond well done! It tasted like beef jerky! However, the salmon was nicely cooked. Our side of Cream of Spinach was very tasty but the color was, peculiarly, extra green - lab experiment, maybe? Minus two stars. Throughout our meal, I noticed the majority of the waiters not doing anything; especially ours! He did not refill our water once or asked if we needed anything else. I had to ask for each refill and that totalled 3 times. He did not seem to give us the attention we deserved while clearly not having anything better to do. Minus three stars. Lastly, the atmosphere was OK. The lighting was a bit brighter than I would have expected. I really enjoy children, but the four year old screaming and throwing her napkin in the air was a bit much for a restaurant like this. I guess it's more family-oriented; not recommended for couples. After all this, I would not go back (if you didn't get the hint already!) :) After my experience, I had to share it and this is only my 2nd review on Yelp!

I looked over at one of the guys who had order his medium and there was no way his should only have been a step below mine. His was extremely red, and mine was extremely...not. However the flavor of the meat was quite good. The hash brown potatoes were possibly oversalted, but that is more than likely why I loved them. Some steamed asparagus on the side helped me pretend that some part of the meal was healthy. Somehow i got sucked into dessert.

We started at the bar because there was a 15 min wait and you wouldn't believe who we met - John Lewis of ""The John Lewis Sound!""  (Here is his MySpace - myspace.com/johnlewissou…).   John Lewis, a well dressed, dapper and  charming guy, told my wife and I  how he played with Tony Bennett  Frank Sinatra and then proceed to charm his way into us buying him a Kettle with a splash of Cranberry. Talking to John for 10 mins was totally worth the cost of the drink - he made my wife and I feel like we were the most beautiful and special people on earth and told us he was going to get us into the VIP room at his next concert. After the meal, I asked the Maître d' if John gets people to buy him a drink often. My hunch was correct, he said ""He has been doing this for 70 years!"" Strange how his myspace page says he is 44!Eventually, we were seated. They sat us in the front room. It was crowded, it was drafty and, unlike the main area that had an energy and was full of excitement,  you could hear a pin drop. There was something about the tables of two and the younger servers with less personality in the  front area that didn't allow the vibe of the main room to translate over.We ordered from the menus, which are cards on the table. Strangely, one menu item was highlighted in bold in the center, the lemon pepper chicken. When we asked why, the waiter said, ""because it is big."" My wife went ahead and ordered and will have chicken for dinner tonight and maybe tomorrow as a result. For $19, it came with 4 big and juicy pieces of chicken. Yes, it was big, but it was also good. I loved the crispy skin, the subtle flavor and the large pieces of juicy chicken meat. I had several pieces of my wife's chicken because I had to send back my overcooked steak sandwich, which came out at the same time. The waiter came back five minutes later with a new portion, which was perfect. It was a crispy baguette slathered with Russian dressing, On the plate was a ripe tomato slice, an onion and crispy French fries. I ate every bite. The highlight, of course was the sliced steak.  At $25, it seemed a little pricey, but when you consider the price of a steak, which essentially you got a portion of, it was worth it. We completed out meal with a hunk of carrot cake. It was wonderful.All that for $55 bucks, which is less  than that  would spend for informal Italian in the city.  The the combination of the food, the service and the atmosphere issues doesn't elevate it to 4 star land.

I was slightly surprised that there would be a wait at 9pm on a Tuesday night in this recession, but there was. After a bit of a wait and a very strong gin and tonic later, we were seated on the second floor. The atmosphere was just like all the other S&Ws I've been to and we were off to a great start.I didn't realize we were coming here, so I didn't prep myself (basically starving myself all day so I can eat the wedge salad and a full serving of some prime rib plus the sides). I opted to skip the appetizer so I could devote my stomach to the prime rib. My brother got the pea soup, which was good, but not the best I've had. It was completely pureed, although you could definitely taste the bacon in it. I personally like a pea soup with texture. Now comes the steak. It's usually 5 stars, but this time, it was 4. The medium-rare that I ordered was leaning towards the medium-side. It was great, but not the amazing I was prepping myself for, especially since I know I love S&W steaks. It was slightly disappointing, but I definitely still enjoyed the entire thing and out-ate the other guy sitting at the table.

1.0,3/2/2009,"In a city with absolutely GREAT steakhouses, why would you go to Smith and Wollensky? I've been twice, once a while ago for steak dinner and last week for lunch. When I went for dinner, and this was a few years ago, I thought the steak was alright but nothing special. This place is quite expensive; 'alright' is simply not good enough!So, I should have known better when I went there for lunch but i read the reviews of others here on Yelp and thought I should give them another try. Plus I was in the neighborhood and hungry. I decided not to have a steak, I knew the tab for lunch would be about $100, so I opted for good beer, their 'famous' split pea soup and the roast beef hash. It sounds good, doesn't it? I love beer, I love split pea soup (especially on a cold day, as this was) and what's not to like about roast beef hash?It all started to go wrong when I sat down, I was sitting next to a drunk couple who were very loud and remarkably annoying. They were still there when I retreated from the place, with the guy slurring the word 'beautiful' so that it sounded like bootybull. Geez! Shortly after taking my order the waiter threw my silverware on the table. Seriously, knife and fork (I was, apparently, not to be trusted with the entire triumvirate of knife fork and spoon) landed near the center of the table. At least he brought my beer pretty quickly. As I was draining my first beer I looked down at the fork, it had some sort of food residue on it, probably egg. It was pretty gross. I then decided to inspect my knife a little closer, it too was dirty.Just as I was looking at the knife my soup showed up. I opened my mouth to ask the waiter for a replacement but by the time I could get out the words, ""Excuse me"" the guy was gone. Vanished. I should point out that I was in a small back room with only about 6 tables. Oh well, no matter, I didn't need a knife and fork to eat my soup so the matter could wait. I did look carefully at the spoon before trying the soup, their track record on cleanliness was not too inspiring. It was OK. Which is about the same thing I could say for the soup, it was just OK. It wasn't awful, although it did have the inconsistent consistency of something made from a mix, and not very well mixed. It was a bit gluey, with no flavor aside from pea. No bacon, no ham, nothing but gluey pea. It did have nice croutons, but if that's the best thing you can say about a soup for which they are supposedly famous then it's faint praise indeed.Next up, my roast beef hash. It, also, was OK. It had more meat in it than the roast beef hash at Keen's steakhouse, but it also seemed that it had been sitting around for a week or so. It was a rather large, dry, remarkably tasteless lump! Thank God for the egg on top or I wouldn't have been able to swallow any of it. Thank God also for the beer, which was the only thing that made the lunch worthwhile.Oh, and the waiter was never around long enough, or sufficiently interested, to exchange the knife and fork for clean ones. I ended up doing that myself, stealing them from the table next door.I don't think I will go back here, it's very expensive for really mediocre quality, but if you do happen to find yourself here, remember to check your silverware carefully. Or, perhaps, bring your own!",4,0,1,Stephen B.,"New York, NY",2,12,0

The staff are really awesome and attentive (as you'd expect for such a pricey place). The only reason I'm keeping that last star is because I could never afford to eat here if it wasn't for the above story! Also, to make your bill even higher, ANY sides you order (none come with your steak), costs an additional $10 PER SIDE. That hurts a bit, especially after ordering a $70 steak.

In fact I had a very lovely time here last night when meeting my aunt for dinner.It was loud and a little crowded in the bar but we were thankfully taken to a back, private room that was much more quiet and intimate. The service was great and the waiter very nice and full of energy (maybe he had just gotten there). Their house Pinot Noir was fabulous but at an outrageous $13 a glass! (It wasn't that great) And $13 was on the less expensive side out of their whole selection.I ordered the filet mignon RARE ($36 - not bad for the city) and a side of asparagus (thinking that all sides were a la carte). My aunt got the chicken caeser salad. The food came out pretty quickly. I never tried the salad but she said it was good (I've seen better). My filet was good, but didn't even come close to Del Frisco's (my fav steakhouse thus far in the city) filet. I asked for rare, which usually means it should come out a little purple on the inside with a slightly cool center. This rare was pink all the way through and warm in the center. Not a huge deal. But it also wasn't as tender as other filets I've had. The filet I've had several times at Del Frisco's cuts like butter, is so tender and the most delicious piece of meat that's ever entered my mouth...well, almost =) HA justttttt kidding.Back to steak...So I was not very impressed with their cut. NOTE: the steak does come with a side of fries, which is not mentioned when you order it nor is it on the menu. The asparagus was good but flavorless. It was probably just steamed with no spices or butter or oil. Which is fine, but they really didn't offer much else for veggies. If you don't like asparagus, the only other choice was creamed spinach. I LOVE STEAK. So it's gotta be pretty damn good to get up there in the rankings. I've had much better filets before.

The seafood starter is amazing but its just way too much if you plan on having a steak after it. Instead, have the soft-shell crabs & the fried calamari to start.

From the waiter, I expected sympathy and a shared dismay at the destruction of a beautiful cut of beef, or at the very least a willingness to put things right.  To my astonishment, I was met with irritation and obnoxiousness. The waiter did a very convincing impression of the maitre d' in Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  Snooty? Snotty. If you are reading, sir, it's UNDERSTANDING that makes it possible for people like us to tolerate a person like yourself.I calmly displayed the thoroughly gray center of my ruined meal, and explained that I would not pay for such garbage. Had I been dining at my aunt's house, I would have kept my mouth shut, except perhaps to ask for the BBQ sauce; however, if I am dropping $40+ on a steak, I expect it to be prepared correctly. The replacement came out still mooing...but I ate it, rather than deal again with the haughtiness of the waiter.The only reason this isn't a 1-star review is because when I was just a little guy, my dad brought me here for one of the best steaks of my young life.  Apparently that was before S&W decided they could coast by on reputation alone.",46,29,22,Peter D.,"Brooklyn, NY",4675,3022,10463

Those seats shouldn't even be there or they should close off the kitchen; it didn't do much for the atmosphere. This restaurant is pretty pricey.

5.0,2/29/2008,"I love this place- and will stick by it even if I hate the original Smith & Wollensky's. -I found the original S&W very obnoxious, rude and stuck up. My review of Wollenskys grill will be on the basis of food only- since ambience isnt what this place is about. (Tiny and crowded, loud and bustling) The main purpose of this sidecar  to me is: if you love the food and none of the gimmicks - you can come eat here without the reservations and snobby attitude. Dont get me wrong- the servers here are no fairies but they seem to tone down the schnoz a notch or two. When here I always order my two favorites- the ever consistent Colorado Rib Eye (not spiced but plain) and the Seafood bouqet. Thats all you need- PERIOD. Forget the sides etc they will only fill you up. Dont get me wrong- Over the years I have tried other things here and there.. like the Wollenskys Salad and burger- both very good. But why take away from the main event and how much of it you can consume? Believe me the steak itself is more than enough for anyone to finish. I always take like half of it home and grill it up again- its just as delish the next day. The Shellfish Bouquet is the absolute best I have ever had and no matter which steakhouse I have ventured to- it has not been topped. You get: Chilled Lobster, Giant Shrimp, Clam and Colossal Lump King Crab- ""thats it?"" you might ask- you greedy bastards! Believe me its all you need. Why? because its about simplicity- each item is perfect and you dont overwhelm your taste buds with all different things.(I think however they may have recently added Mussels) The star of the seafood platter is going to knock your socks off- its not the seafood.. but the green sauce that you dip the crab/lobster in. The combination of flavor is like pastrami with mustard, wasabi with sushi- you will never imagine eating one without the other again. For the Colorado Rib Eye- I have been to countless steak houses and no one can make a better bone-in Ribeye. The texture is perfect (not too soft.. not too tough.. not too stringy.. perfect amount of marbled fat and always sent piping hot) A lot of steakhouses these days over age their steaks to the point where steaks arent even steaks anymore- they're soft and mushy to the point where it becomes souless and boring. Some underage the steaks where they simple tire me out from chewing- while others play with the natural juices and flavors by masking it with spices and herbs. Consistently my rib eyes at Wolly's have been cooked to perfection- simply and true. If you are a purist who doesnt give a crap for the scene or anythign else but focus on the main purpose of being there (EATING THE BEST RIBEYE) then this is for you.",0,0,1,mOmO B.,"New York, NY",66,67,178
4.0,2/28/2008,"An old midtown standard featuring white coated & primarily male service staff offering up hunks of seared & roasted beef that are really quite something. The place has the feel of a golf clubhouse or something - obviously a cultivated appearance - and they welcome you in warmly, seat you promptly, and attend to your desires with a quickness. There are several rooms within the restaurant, each charming, and all have that very wooden, old style, lodge-y feel.Start off with the cold seafood platter (I assume no one who has to worry about money has lunch here when they are actually paying, so let that corporate plastic get out and get a little exercise) - hunks of lobster, lump crab, shrimp, and shellfish, all fresh, huge, and scrumptious, and it comes with a one of a kind lime dipping sauce that, though it resembles ectoplasm in color, tastes fantastically zippy. Ok no one has a clue what zippiness tastes like, but trust me.The steaks are gargantuan. Half a cow. Their amazing hugeness is such that a post meal triple espresso really won't save you from spending the better part of the afternoon happily caressing your own belly while you do no work and dozily daydream the afternoon away. The ribeyes are juicy and truly massive. The sirloin is less fatty, but equally satisfying, and a touch easier to fit into your innards. All steaks are served in the classic steakhouse style, with a nice char on the outside and finished in the oven. I've had several and they were always prepared perfectly, with juices running forth when cut. Worth a trip.

1.0,2/19/2008,"So I'm fully aware of how some restaurants scoff at patrons who come during restaurant week, I don't care if they feel that way. I will care when they treat us like complete crap during our visit. There's simply no excuse for that kind of behavior. The nightmare began when we sat down. An old wrinkly grumpy human version of oscar the grouch came over to us to take our order. At first he didn't want to give us menus because he said ""aren't you all going to order the restaurant week menu anyway?"" We said we would still like to see the menu. He brought it over begrudgingly and when when time came to order (we ended up all ordering from the RW menu), he would cut us off as we were saying our order and condescendingly say ""STEAK. I knew it."" This was Strike One.Strike Two, prior to the food service, my friend asked him to change her glass of water since there were unidentified floating things in it. Oscar The Terrible proceeded to then pick up the glass, examine it and then argue with my friend about the dirt in it. In short he didn't want to give her a new glass of water because he didn't see the speck. So we're all sitting really confused and giving the waiter the benefit of the doubt. In retrospect, I don't know why we thought that this old wrinkly man from the dinosaur era would have better eyesight than 6 of us at the table. Strike Three - When we were paying, our waiter did the worst thing possible. He ""hovered"" to ensure that we would tip him accordingly. This is appalling, I don't even have to go into detail with this.The only thing that salvaged our night:1) We made friends with one of the busboys who was kind enough to attend to us all night, give us plenty of new glasses of water and apologize for the behavior of our main server. But the fact that the busboy was apologizing for the behavior of the waiter, come on. That's a sign right there.2) The steaks are truly truly delicious.Juicy, tender, flavorful. Our meal was not cheap either. Even with the RW discount. I'm very happy to say 90% of our tip was given to the busboy (we handed it to him) and 10% to the horrible waiter who made sure that none of us would ever want to go back there again.So all in all, if you're willing to bear absolutely nightmarish service for good steak, go.

Dessert was okay, but it clearly had been sitting out for awhile. Ambiance: Stuffy country club feel. You would probably get glared at if you laughed too loudly.

4.0,12/7/2007,"A Tale of Two Sauces. (sigh) I'm torn. On the one hand, this was the best fillet mignon I've had in years. On the other hand, the total bill for two set me back $250, not including tip*. Yeah, read that again. Let it sink in.But back to the hand with the food... One of their signature steaks, the Oscar fillet arrived perched in a shallow pool of wine reduction sauce. On its top rested a generous garnishing of crab meat smothered in just the right amount of hollandaise. Omigod. Sinful. I loved the interplay of the two sauces. The resulting variety of taste combinations meant there was never a dull moment for the ol' taste buds. And the quality of the meat was melt-in-your-mouth-errific. My guest is still talking about how good his un-garnished, un-saucified version was. He gets this faraway, famished look in his eyes that... well... scares me a little, actually.Word to the wise: Don't bother with the seafood bouquet, unless you absolutely can't live without crab or lobster. Both of us agreed that the best thing in the bouquet was the shrimp, and that we would have been just as happy ordering that alone at a much lower price. Though the bouquet's presentation was definitely something to behold.All that being said, I was expecting a much more elegant dining experience. Yes, the service was great. But the decor was a little bit too dressed down for the price tag. It reminded me of an informal clubhouse at a country club or a private gentlemen's club. (The British kind, silly. Get your mind out of the gutter.) A romantic dinner for two this is not. Unless you close your eyes. Come to think of it, a simple dimming of the lights would have gone a long way toward making the atmosphere match the quality of the food.*$250 covered two cocktails, a humongous seafood ""bouquet"" appetizer, two steaks, a side of creamed spinach, and a bottle of wine.",1,0,1,Ames F.,"New York, NY",54,86,6
2.0,10/28/2007,"Wollensky's Grill is supposed to be the less formal, less pricey version of Smith and Wollensky's. The signature dish is a hamburger, and they don't take reservations.Sounds good, but there's a couple of problems with the formula.  The first is that the place is really, really noisy and crowded, although you can get a table fairly quickly (the crowd is mostly young masters-of-the-financial-universe types, which is possibly why they got under my skin more than crowds usually do).The second problem, and one that's very troubling, is one of honesty. If the waiters mark you as a rube, they'll give you the main Smith & Wo's menu and let you order off that. Keep in mind that most of the same dishes are on the grill menu for a much smaller price-tag - sometimes, half. Most of the clientele, blissfully ignorant, paid for the full price of dishes at the Smith and Wo mothership. In short, if you go, the waiters will give you the ""framed"" menu. Don't fall for it. Order from the grill menu already on your table.Should you ""insist"" on ordering from the grill menu, forget it. You'll be ignored by the waitron, who's going to spend all of his time on the rube that he just ripped off. And it does seem that the stupid tend to drink more, exacerbating the situation.In truth, the food is the same high quality that you get from the main restaurant - not surprising, as the dishes are prepared in the same kitchen. Nonetheless, even the quality of the food cannot hide the robbery that occurs there.It is essentially a lose/lose situation for the diner. The management has to be aware, because how else can one explain the majority of your clients choosing to pay more for the same thing that can be had for less?  Then again, the aspiring hedge-funders may like to pay more just for fun.",3,1,2,jonathan h.,"Brooklyn, NY",10,82,2

We got some sauteed spinach anyway (this is not on the menu, btw... but they will make it for you if you want to avoid the creamed spinach).The steaks were enormous and both cooked perfectly medium rare, as ordered. My filet au poivre was nice and crispy on the outside, juicy and rare on the inside. Completely tender and delicious.The best part was at the end when one of the waiters approached my date trying to speak Mandarin with him, but alas my date spoke Cantonese. Anyway, this sparked a conversation about the little stars on the lapels of the waiter's jackets and all of a sudden we had a swarm of Smith & Wollensky waiters around us, arguing over who had been there the longest, telling us about their children, asking us if we were married (a little awkward for sure).

I doubt there's many who'd be interested about how that tasted, but just in case someone has a taste for it when they visit S&W, it was actually very good.  My boyfriend started with the lobster cocktail, which was pretty much a small whole lobster with cocktail sauce on the side. Simple, yet good. For the steaks, the bf had the cajun ribeye. Lots of flavor since its pre-marinated. Really good choice if you're looking for a different taste in your steak. I decided to go for the 16oz filet au poivre. My god, it was a big piece of steak. I'm a girl who loves her steaks and this was the first time I was defeated. I did the best I could to finish my filet with the peppery crust and juicy tender inside, but I just couldnt do it. Hashbrown potatoes were good and the creamed spinach wasnt bad either, but what really made the night was the chocolate and peanut butter layer cake. Light and sweet with all the right flavors.

4.0,5/8/2006,"A word of caution: Smith & Wollensky  is a classic old-style steak house. Do not expect ""Sizzler's but classier"". This is an entirely different experience.  Two words: Old-school and testosterone. Some tips: 1. Emphasis is on the food, NOT the atmosphere. The decor is a little tattered, the floors are worn, and wait staff bustling. You'll likely be stuffed in a large room crowded with diners, mostly  well-dressed old-money businessmen and their guests (and a spattering of confused misplaced-looking tourists). This is the type of place where if smoking was legal, it would be cigars all around. 2. Sides are ordered separately. As per tradition, they do NOT (repeat: DO NOT) come with the meal. 3. The menu is decidedly classic bare bones. The breadbasket is great, the seafood platters are obscenely overflowing (and obscenely priced), and the high-quality steaks are huge (I'm partial to the Colorado cut and the filet mignon au poivre ). But don't expect fancy nouveau-riche culinary maneuvers here. Your salad will be iceberg lettuce, the spinach creamed, and the steaks prepared old-school style.4. Service is all over the board. Partially dependent upon how high your tab will be and/or where you are in the alpha-male hierarchy. If you don't think the above warrants the high prices (which is entirely justified), for the love of god, go elsewhere!

I've had far better steaks at Ruth's Chris Steak House (which has the same philosophy of ordering stuff individually) both in San Francisco and Los Angeles. Maybe we should've gone to NYC's BEST steak house Peter Luger's instead.",5,2,2,Anita L.,"Irvine, CA",1409,4084,3685
