5.0,4/26/2019,"I took my mother here last night for her birthday, and when I tell you we recieved phenomenal service there is no exaggeration. I booked the reservation last minute and was worried that we wouldn't be able to get the time slot we requested, surprisingly we did. I also made a note to mention that it was going to be a birthday dinner. When we arrived we were seated right away and the table was already set up with birthday trinkets and a birthday card. Our waiter was nothing short of amazing and he catered to our every need. The food was very flavorful and robust. I would definitely visit this location again in the future",1,0,0,Milan M.,"Manhattan, NY",106,13,12

My husband received a nice birthday card on the table when we arrived . Surprised us with a glass of champagne. We ordered onion soup, filet mignon, ny strip , potatoes and green beans . Everything was delicious. We must have had maybe 5 people come over and wish him a happy birthday .  Desserts were awesome too . They knew we had a play to see so we were in and out hour and half .

There is meter parking around the area but as you know it is the city so most are already taken but you'll find one close by if you get here about 40mins prior to your reservations.

Our waitress name was Rachel very nice lady and the whole night she was on point, stoli doli is what me and my wife were drinking, seems like more vodka than pineapple juice (still have a headache) my lady ordered salmon and I had the Ny strip steak Medium well, my lady didn't like the steak I loved it, she enjoyed her salmon though, disliked the green beans.

5.0,2/2/2019,"The Capital Grille never disappoints. I came here to celebrate my birthday and also for restaurant week winter 2019. The restaurant week menu had really good options, but our waitress Angela Wingrove recommended the porterhouse and the Kona crusted ribeye to share. OMG let me tell you, they were both so delicious and well cooked. The ribeye especially. You can not go wrong with either of those steaks. We had the steaks with the lobster mac and cheese, creamed spinach, and asparagus. I left there so full and happily satisfied. From the bread basket to my birthday dessert, I was in food heaven. Angela was awesome. She took care of us and made sure we enjoyed our meal. She also recommended a great full red wine. I want some more LOL. She knows her stuff. The service was exceptional, I mean Angela took care of us and trust me when I say, I will keep coming here not only for the food but for the great service as well.

5.0,2/1/2019,"My fiance and I set up a reservation here after purchasing tickets for a Broadway show. We had looked at the Restaurant Week menu and decided that their offerings were pretty generous for the price. The reservation process was very smooth- they're on Open Table so it was really simple to make/adjust reservations. Unfortunately, on our way into the city we hit massive amounts of traffic and arrived half-an-hour late to our reservation. I called when I realized that we would be late and the hostess was extremely pleasant about our tardiness. They also didn't give us any grief when arrived, which I thought was very professional and courteous. I really liked the overall ambiance of the restaurant. They have a bar area as well as a main dining room and smaller offset dining rooms for a more intimate setting. I was also happy to see that the tables were not jam packed together, as is standard for NYC. Our server was outstanding. When he greeted us he asked if we were going to see a show after dinner and when we told him we were looking to be done with dinner in an hour, he assured us not to worry. I am impressed with his ability to cater to our crazy timeline all without making us feel rushed or stressed at any point.When it comes to the meal, we both opted to order off the Restaurant Week menu. I had the New England clam chowder, 8 oz fillet, and cheesecake. My fiance opted for the lobster bisque (at a $5 up charge), 8 oz fillet, and espresso cake, while we both shared the green beans and mashed potatoes. We were both extremely satisfied with our meals. I really liked my soup, but the lobster bisque was incredible. Our steaks were perfectly cooked and the sides were tasty. I really loved the cheesecake and the espresso cake was good as well. Overall, I'm really happy that we tried the Capital Grille and will definitely go back!",7,2,3,Sara C.,"Wayne, NJ",219,316,163

5.0,1/26/2019,"This review is more geared towards the two times I've been to this Capital Grille location during Restaurant Week. Both great experiences. I think that capital grille offers the best bang for your buck during RW. Appetizer, entree (including steak) dessert and a side for $42 is one hell of a deal by any standard. Particularly since some of the steaks they include on their RW menu are over $42 on their own. I've been to two of their locations during RW. The first location we tried (Chrysler center) made us feel uncomfortable asking for the RW menu, and once we did the waiter clearly diverted his attention away from us for the evening. The food was also pretty bad for Capital Grille standards. It was overall a bizarre experience - especially since we've been to that location many times and never had issues. This location however treats it like a real feature and offers a much better experience overall. Both times our servers were great and the food was top notch as well. For RW they offer the Kona for a $20 upcharge - still a great deal and is my favorite steak they offer. As with all of their locations, despite being a chain I find their food to be excellent. I look forward to coming back to this location, during RW or otherwise.",2,0,0,Mike N.,"New York, NY",144,283,75

3.0,1/16/2019,"Had dinner here last night before a show. Arrived on time and asked hostess to hold table till after we finished our drink at the bar. She agreed but didn't -and we had to wait further for a table. Very amateurish. Appetizers were all good. Filet mignon was a bit dry but tender. Amount of Bernaisse sauce was ridiculously small. Plate was somewhat ""bare"". How about a sprig of parsley? Salmon was very small in portion size but good. NY strip was a bit tough compared to other steakhouses including those of supposed lesser quality. Again plate was "" bare""   Sides of Mashed Pot were good. Mushrooms a little burnt with no flavor. Spinach was also just ok lacking flavor. Service was sterile and minimal interaction. Could never find her. Atmosphere was very good.

All were wonderful but I loved the mushroom bisque it was the star of the appetizer. Then we all ordered fish because we were going to a steak house the next night. We ordered the tuna with ginger, the salmon and the chicken. The tuna and salmon were wonderful and the green beans were very good. The chicken was alright but not great.

But this location did not live up to our expectations at all.  The service was ok and we left a full 20% tip however the steak was disappointing. We ordered it medium rare. It arrives medium rare to table but is almost cold. We tried one bite to confirm and it indeed was not hot. We returned it. Not only did the staff act annoyed that we returned it but they brought it back out after heating it up in the microwave. Now not only was our meat barely warm, it was also well done.  I have been to many restaurants and never ever had a re-heated plate brought back out.  Very disappointing.",0,0,0,Danielle H.,"North Bergen, NJ",43,8,0
3.0,12/18/2018,"We frequent Capital Grille in Garden City and always have a fantastic experience but this location was not nearly as good.  We had to wait to be seated even though the dining room was empty and the host was visibly flustered.  He had a strange system where he printed tickets for the tables and laid them out on the front desk so they blew onto the floor every time the door opened.  Once we were finally seated, they took us to a small side room to table that wasn't set. The iPad drink menu they gave us was on Low Power Mode so it wasn't functioning well, our drinks took a long time, the food runners didn't know where to place the food or even which table to go to.  Our server Sarah was trying very hard, but the experience was disappointing.  Overall the location felt poorly managed and we expect a lot more from Capital Grille.",0,0,0,Alex C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0

5.0,12/14/2018,"What a delicious dinner! One of the best steak that I really enjoyed the most. This is such a sweet treat before Christmas. I got invited by my sister in law to attend her company Christmas party and I'm really glad I went because I got to meet new faces and enjoyed everything that I ordered. We had a private room for the event and it makes it extra special especially in places like this. The bread they give was really good and they gave a lot. For main dish I had the ribeye, its so huge so if theirs just two of you then its better to order different types of steak and share. Its very tender and juicy. It has this little bit of sour taste to it which I like. Also theirs a spinach, asparagus, mushroom on the side and its all flavorful. I love sauteed and flavorful vegestables. For dessert I got the chocolate expresso cake with cocoa. Yummy! Anyone should try this especially if you're a chocolate lover. One of the best steakhouse in NYC and service is top notch!

It felt quite cool to have our own space.Our drink orders were taken and served, and then our food orders were taken. We waited a bit for our food (because there were so many people), but all our dishes came at once. I got the seared tuna with rice, and the table got 3 orders of truffle fries and 2 orders of brussels sprouts. The fries at the top of the basket were good and had truffle flavoring, but the ones at the bottom didn't. The brussels sprouts came with bacon but for some reason were really sweet. My main dish was quite delicious, and it came with soy sauce, vinegar, and wasabi sauces. I got the tuna medium rare, and I quite enjoyed each bite. The rice was a bit clumpy though and it wasn't the best. For dessert, I got the apple crostata, which I thought was just okay. It wasn't overly sweet which I appreciated, and it came with vanilla ice cream. The ice cream wasn't creamy at all, and it was really icy. Not good. The crostata top wasn't crunchy and it was very mediocre. I had a bite of my coworker's cheesecake though and that was actually quite delicious; very smooth. At the high prices, I expected food to be better. I don't think anything wow'd me, and everything was just average.",1,0,1,Andrea W.,"Brooklyn, NY",172,2109,1018
4.0,11/18/2018,"Cap off a Broadway show with a meal at this Capital Grille. The steaks are like butter! Melt in your mouth delicious. We had a party of 11. Make a reservation if you can. Large parties I would recommend requesting the upstairs area, as it's more intimate and quieter than the main floor.  Although they don't advertise a kids menu, they have children choices that are delicious. 4 ounce filet mignon or chicken fingers and fries are both great choices.We enjoyed a great variety of menu choices in our party. Porterhouse steaks, Caesar salad, lobster with tenderloin, calamari appetizer, au gratin potatoes to name a few. We all shared our meals with each other, and all were excellent.The only reason I don't give 5 stars is our server was not up to snuff.  We had to flag her down for everything. Another drink, clear some plates, more dressing etc. Also, as the side dishes are separate, they should come close to when you get your meal. They did not. Same with our desserts and coffee. Some of us finished, some still waiting.Overall it was a great place to have a special meal for a special occasion. Will definitely be back. Hopefully the service is better because for the prices and the 5 star food, you should experience 5 star service.Still I highly recommend!",3,0,0,Colette G.,"Shoreham, NY",113,219,106

After traveling for over 7 days with our two teenagers, my husband and I needed a break and a nice dinner on our own. We decided to go to Capital Grille. There are three in a very close proximity. We went to the wrong one but the hostess immediately accommodated us. She was gracious.  Our waiter was great and most everything was perfect. The only feedback I have is how my fillet was over cooked. I ordered it medium and got it really over cooked. If you look at my photos you can see how both of our steaks were slightly over cooked, mine more than his. My husbands rib eye had so much flavor, you over looked the charred pieces. Mine on the other hand burnt off the seasoning that was on it. I would go back because this was the first issue I've had at a capital grille... ever.

For the main course we got the Gorgonzola NY strip medium rare (of course) cooked perfectly, tender, and fully of flavor. The Gorgonzola may be a little too strong of a flavor for some, but I thought it worked well. We also got the roasted chicken which was also good. We couldn't finish all the food, so I took the chicken for lunch the following work day - still delicious the next day. As a side, we ordered the Brussel sprouts with bacon - delicious but probably not too healthy. The environment was very romantic.

5.0,8/13/2018,"After doing a lot of research on all of the restaurants participating in Restaurant week, my friends and I decided to give Capital Grille a shot. I made a reservation about 3 weeks ago for a party of 6. On the reservation I specified that I would like a private room if available and luckily we got one for no charge. Our waiter Billy was very attentive and gave us his opinion on what the best options were from the Pre-fixe menu. He also told us about the Generous pour event which includes 6+ glasses of various wine's to pair with our meal for $28 more. We all took part in the generous pour event because you can go to any other restaurant in the city and expect to pay that much for 2 glasses, what a steal.Billy brought out a couple of baskets of bread (all of which were awesome) and we got started with our meal. Most of us started with the wedge salad and a couple of others started with the clam chowder. The wedge salad had giant pieces of bacon and a heaping dollop of bleu cheese. Very tasty. The clam chowder was also quite tasty and didnt last very long. For our Entree's, the majority of the table opted to pay the extra $10 for the Kona Crusted NY strip. I opted to stick with the regular Bone-In NY Strip. Each steak was cooked to the way we ordered it and it was all incredibly tasty. For the sides we did a 4:2 ratio of mash potatoes to French Green Beans. The mash potatoes were the star of our meal, just awesome. For dessert we each shared the Espresso Cake and Creme Brulee, all very good. I didn't get to take many pictures of the meal because I was already 4 glasses of wine deep and completely forgot. I can't recommend this place enough as this was one of the best meals I had in a very long time. The value for what we got was absolutely crazy and I will be returning very soon!

4.0,8/8/2018,"I came with coworkers for Restaurant Week lunch and was pleasantly surprised. It's a gorgeous space and impressive throughout despite being a chain. It's definitely a Midtown corporate vibe, and it's got expense account (though not eye-popping) prices to match.The RW lunch menu ($28) gives you a choice of appetizer and entree, which I believe were two salads and a clam chowder. Some raves from the group about the clam chowder; I went for a salad which was fine but forgettable.Most of us went for the cheeseburger, and I don't think more than a couple managed to finish it. It's a big, satisfying portion, and all the usual accoutrements are fresh and flavorful. What wasn't flavorful was the patty itself, which though it had a great juicy texture just didn't have that meaty taste I look for. Similarly, truffle fries had a mouthwatering scent but didn't deliver that earthy flavor.Pacing a bit on the long side but never egregious, and they did a great job handling our group of 12.This is a good use of Restaurant Week (Del Frisco's still delivers the ultimate RW lunch), as you get a good bang per buck. One of our party members opted to order from the regular menu and blew through $50 easily. I would also skip drinking here as by-the-glass prices are high.",2,1,3,Liz S.,"New York, NY",952,772,1843
1.0,8/5/2018,"Came for a pre-theater dinner with reservations. I work a block away, and have been to this Capital Grille a number of times before, always made reservations and never had an issue. On this particular occasion, the main restaurant was pretty empty, but we were seated in the back room. The room was very warm. When we let our server know, he apologized and explained that the A/C is controlled by the building, and they've not been able to adjust it. At this point, there was only one other table in the room, who also complained that it was very warm. The rest of the restaurant was comfortably cool. The manager brought in a fan, which did very little by way of cooling the room. Within fifteen minutes, despite the fact that the restaurant acknowledged the temperature issue, and both tables already in the room pointed out that it was uncomfortable, four more tables were seated in this room, making the temperature even hotter. My husband went to speak to the manager, because at this point our creme brûlée was melting on our table. The manager apologized and comped us the bar tab, which was nice of them, but at that point we couldn't finish our drinks nor the dessert because we were so uncomfortable and hot. The best part of the evening, however, came after we got home, and spent the rest of the evening with a massive case of food poisoning. I suggest a hard pass on this restaurant going forward - you can have a pleasant meal at Ted's Montana Grill, Ruth's Chris, or Del Frisco's within a five minute walk if steak is what you are after.",0,0,0,Wackydream M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,22,35

I had a fresh, delicious green salad with a light parmesan vinaigrette  dressing. I then had the dry rub Kona steak...about 14 ounces and sauteed spinach. I was able to exchange the potatoes for the veggie.  It also included a dessert. I had the homemade sorbet with 3 flavors. Most of us indulged with a glass of wine. I enjoyed everything about Capital Grill.  The venue is very sophisticated and elegant. There's an open kitchen. Our waiter got all our orders correct which was a big plus.  The hostess was delightful and we couldn't have asked for a nicer experience.  We would definitely return on a future trip.",2,0,1,Audrey L.,"Englishtown, NJ",133,150,490

Food:I started with the delicious must order lobster crab cake and lobster bisque . My favorite ? Lobster crab cake , it had so much flavor without the side sauce and that was just an added bonus and I must say everything tasted fresh. For my main dish I got a filet mignon  with a side of their rich mash potatoes, cream of spinach and Brussels sprouts with bacon which ended up being the best dish and that with the crab cake has had me waiting to go back.

4.0,6/12/2018,"How have I never reviewed this place? I've been here at least a doze times, and I almost always have a good experience. The only time it was kinda wonky was when we had a party of 7-8 in one of the private dining rooms, and the waiters kept forgetting about us, but other than that, it's solid. We were here about a week ago again to take advantage of the theater menu, which they have between I think 4-7pm everyday. You get to choose a starter, an entree, a side, and a dessert for I believe $42 or $45 or something around there. This is an incredible value, because that's how much a single steak can cost if you get it a la carte. My go-to is the clam chowder (def worth a taste if you haven't tried it before), the kona crusted steak (my fave!), and the creme brulee - altho I do prefer the cheesecake (I think you can pay a little more and get it instead of the creme brulee). Overall, I think it's a solid meal for the price. It may not be the best steakhouse in the entire world, but what I love about coming here is that they are consistent and consistently good. I know what to expect, and they always deliver.Other items of note:Lobster mac and cheese: tastes good, but the amount of lobster is inconsistent sometimes - but when you get a good dose, so worth it.Bread basket: brown bread with raisins is my favorite, but all the other stuff is good too! I basically get full before the appetizers even arrive.Fried Calamari: they pan fry it and stir in pickled peppers, and it's a great combination. Sometimes it can be a bit oily b/c of the pan fry.Truffle Fries: I think they have some parmesan on these too. No real truffles - just truffle oil, but it's still good!",0,0,0,Rose L.,"Queens, NY",80,139,168

I expected it to be bland like most places but I'm so glad I was wrong. It had a nice crisp and was well seasoned; to my surprise, I ate the whole thing.

5.0,5/3/2018,"This review is for private dining. I am in Michigan, and was tasked with finding an appropriate diner venue for my boss to host 15 high-profile investment advisors for dinner, the night before their meeting, in proximity to the meeting venue and hotels. The Capital Grille fit that bill. They have a variety of accommodations for private dining, which made it easy to find one that fit our needs perfectly. The rooms are elegant, yet comfortable. The private dining manager was responsive and making arrangements from afar was a breeze. I could see the details of the rooms online, which was very helpful. We were able to choose a set price per guest and even choose the wine ahead of time. The menu choices were excellent and decadent. The room cost requirements were appropriate for the size of the party/room and reasonable. The dinner was last night, and I just received a big thank you from my Big Boss that the venue and dinner was excellent, and thanked me for finding it.

5.0,4/10/2018,"The Capital Grille on 51st Street is certainly one of the best restaurants in the city. I certainly love coming before or after a performance on Broadway. The menu revolves around the delicious steak, but is much more than that. The other meats and seafood are also amazing. My first time here was magnificent. We had just come from a performance of Wicked on Broadway and were looking forward to our meal here. Immediately as we entered, my friend and I were impressed with the beautiful decor and the friendliness of the hosts and hostesses in front. We were promptly seated at a lovely table with an impressive menu. The wine list was also excellent, and the cocktails quite nice as well. I ordered the shrimp cocktail for my appetizer. Shrimp cocktail is one of my favorite things to order at a new restaurant that I am visiting. I was certainly not disappointed. The shrimp were plump and juicy, with a perfectly spicy cocktail sauce. We also ordered a Caesar salad. It was perfect, with beautifully dressed, fresh lettuce. For the entree I had to go with the house specialty, the steak. I ordered the fourteen ounce New York strip. It was just what you would except from a place like this. Juicy and flavorful, cooked to perfection. It was also incredibly tender. Overall, impeccable. My friend also had steak and loved it as well. To go along with the steaks we ordered the parmesan truffle fries and grilled asparagus. The potatoes were perfectly done, and the flavors were spot-on. The asparagus was great and served with lemon mosto, which gave it a nice taste. For dessert I had to go with the double chocolate cake. It was spectacular. Served warm just the way I like it, with creamy, fresh ice cream. Throughout the meal, the service was attentive and courteous. The waiters and waitresses made sure everything was to our liking. These standards have been the same every time that I have been back, either for lunch or dinner. I certainly had an excellent time at this wonderful establishment. I urge you to go as soon as you can, it will be delicious. The locations on Wall Street and 42nd Street are just as good.

One of my friends got a porterhouse and he loved it. We got two crab cakes, two spinach, 2 calamari appetizers, and two truffle fries, two lobster mac. This was the perfect amount of appetizers and sides. Note to self make sure to go for the $100 bottles of wine. I got one that was $80 and even though it was rated + 90 you could tell the difference.I got the New York strip which was 14 ounces. Next time I'm going to the filet mignon. I think I would like that better because it would be more tender and it was 10 oz.This place was close to Times Square so it was nice to walk around there afterwards.

The interior had the expected classy decor.Our hostess was ready for us at the front and we were immediately led to a private booth.Anthony, our outstanding server, arrived in seconds offering us menus and drink options.

Service and hospitality at its finest!As always, the flatbread and rolls on the table are fresh-baked.Though I was set on ordering the porterhouse, as I always do, I went off my plan and chose the remarkably underpriced special, Twin South African Lobster Tails. My dinner companion went for the Filet, from which I shared a healthy portion.Both the surf and the turf were precisely broiled to perfection.The advertised 10oz lobster serving was monstrous; enough for 2 with some left over.And, quite the bargain at $54.00!!!The Filet had a perfect char with a juicy, pink center.Combined with the sides of mushrooms and the most homey mashed potatoes, we had a perfect dinner.Somehow, Anthony coerced us to order, and finish, a healthy slice of the classic flourless chocolate cake.

I was in casual clothing dressed for cold weather so I wouldn't have even thought to try and sit in the dining area so I found a place at the bar.

4.0,10/1/2017,"I'm not a big fan of chains, but I make an exception for Capital Grill. I've dined at the Chrysler Building location three times in the past. This time I dined at the West 51st St location in Manhattan with an opentable reservation. When we arrived, the white table napkins were changed to black napkins because our slacks were dark. The only other place that did that was Veranda in the Four Seasons Hotel in Las Vegas.  The service was nearly flawless with one slip up. Our server Josue Minor was,overall, exceptional! We were given an Amuse Bouche that was delicious. Our appetizers were the Mozzarella with tomato and basil with 15 year aged balsamic that was excellent and large enough to share and the Russel Sprouts Salad with toasted pecans goat cheese and smoked bacon which was also excellent and large enough to share. I wish they indicated that on the menu since my dining partner and I were baffled at how the tuna tartare was listed as ""for 2"" but the appetizers we ordered weren't. They should be. Entrees were the Sushi grade sesame seared tuna with gingered rice and 3 sauces and the Seared Halibut with Sake braised mushrooms and miso butter. I had asked for the tuna medium rare but it arrived rare (although the center was a little warm) But... it was seared flawlessly. The skin with the sesame crust was perfect so all is forgiven. Not only that, but the tuna overall was one of the best dishes I've ever had! The Halibut was equally good. We had a side of grilled asparagus with lemon that was excellent. Because the portions are large, we shared the sorbets for dessert which were excellent as well. A wonderful meal. Why 4 instead of 5?  Two issues. They provide a bread basket and bread plates but no bread knives. I had to use the same knife that I used to cut my Mozzarella and tomato salad with balsamic to cut the butter that was presented. Second issue is that the the watier mentioned the sorbet flavors prior to our ordering them, but when he brought the sorbet he said that the flavors had actually changed from what he had told us. He should have returned to the table when he learned that the flavors were changed and informed us of the changes to see if the changes were acceptable.

4.0,8/24/2017,"It's never my preference to eat at expensive chain restaurants, least of all when I'm on vacation. I guess my latest visit to New York was technically a work trip, which is why I ended up spending one of my evenings at the Midtown West Capital Grille.I'm one of many lawyers who decided, ""Fuck the law, I'm gonna write books (and also Yelp reviews)."" I got an invite to speak on a lawyers-who-write panel for a bar association conference in New York a couple weeks back, and I met with my fellow panelists for dinner the night before the event.The dinner wasn't covered, and I was a bit confused when the organizer informed me that he'd booked a private room at the Capital Grille. He noted there was a food and beverage minimum for the room, and that I was expected to put in $100 for my share. This all seemed pretty unnecessary for a party of five, as well as a wasted opportunity for a group of people visiting this great food city from different parts of the country. To make things worse, I'd already planned a late second dinner with friends, and was only going to meet my co-panelists for drinks. I showed up ready to have a bad time.As soon as I walked into the room, I understood. Turns out I was not just the only woman and non-white person on this panel, I was also the youngest by a few decades, and the only one who hadn't written a presidential biography. The organizer was a lovely Texan man who said there was a Capital Grille in Dallas, and it was always reliable. Everyone ordered the filet.Once my resentment evaporated, I had a lot of fun. We were in the Phillip Johnson room, and it was quite pleasant, quiet and comfortable with a round table big enough for about a party of eight. Service was attentive and professional. Our waitress checked in on us at regular intervals, and we were never wanting for anything.I didn't eat a full meal here, but I did get a half dozen oysters, and they were good, fresh and tasty, served with mignonette on ice. Mostly, I drank. I had a couple glasses of red wine, as well as a cocktail and a pour of Courvoisier (we had to reach that minimum). All very nice. The cocktail was a twist on an Old Fashioned called the In Fashion, made with Russell's Reserve 10-year small batch bourbon, Grand Marnier, and black walnut bitters, served over an orange ice sphere with an amarena cherry. Thanks to the New York law requiring chain restaurants to display calorie counts on the menu, I now know that an Old Fashioned is about 220 calories. Good to know, I guess.I was in a great mood by the end of this dinner. My dining companions were friendly and fascinating, and I was pleasantly tipsy. There are definitely better places to eat for $100 a head in New York City, but if you want the comfort of a private room in midtown, I guess you could do worse.",3,5,7,Steph C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3889,3532,94

4.0,4/18/2017,"Tonight we feasted while at a work-related dinner which was held at the midtown chapter of The Capital Grille.  The hostess who greeted us prompt, friendly, and immediately took our coats as we walked in.  She then led us to the back room where the wait staff was ready to help find our seats, as well as fill our glasses with wine.  For starters, we had the spicy, jalapeño calamari which was cooked perfectly!  The texture of the calamari itself was not overly chewy and the crunch of the batter was impressive.  The pickled jalapeños and peppers added a nice kick to the dish, but my only complaint is that the texture of the pickled peppers was too limp in comparison to the fried calamari.  I wanted each bite to have that vinegary element, but every time I placed both pieces of food in my mouth, I was so disappointed from a texture perspective - of the peppers.  I may have enjoyed them more if they were crunchier. The table bread came in a variety of rolls and sliced sourdough breads that were pipping hot - perfect for the salted butter to melt into a liquid gold onto the starchy bread.  The roll had a perfect crisp to the outer shell, but a soft, dense, and chewy middle.  The salad that came was a mixed fricassee, romaine lettuce, and mixed greens plate that came with three different types of tomatoes, and the dressing was maybe a Caesar dressing that wasn't overly apparent on the dish, which I liked. For the main course, I had the 18 ounce bone-in kona crusted dry aged sirloin with shallot butter.  I definitely had leftovers of the perfectly cooked medium steak which was accompanied by a wilted piece of greens.  The presentation of the dish was not that impressive, but the melted butter on top glistened the perfectly charred piece of meat.  For sides, we had Sam's mashed potatoes which were DELICIOUS!  Almost comparable to Jacob's Pickles's mash potatoes because they were hot, buttery, and gooey in consistency.  The steamed broccoli was simple and with the exception of the mash potatoes, the meat and broccoli were not salted which I liked because it is healthier.  However, from a taste perspective, the meat definitely needed more salt.  That being said, I would rather have under-salted food than overly salty, which is not pleasant at all! Dessert included three different dishes (brownie cake, Brûlée style cheesecake, and the coconut cream pie with house made caramel sauce).  The last dish was AMAZING and quite addicting.  The pie's tart was moist and buttery.  The custard and cream on top harmoniously joined together with the shortbread-like crust.  The butter cookie on top was also tasty and added a nice crunch to the overall dish.  I enjoyed it thoroughly with my chamomile tea.

While it was flavorful, I had to share my bone-in dry crusted kona strip with shallot butter which was juicy, cooked appropriately, and was plentiful.  It just seemed strange that a waiter would recommend a dish and then agree with us later about our objections to the dish.  We honestly shared our feelings with the waiter and he did remove the Parmesan  truffled French fries from the bill.  We did enjoy the fresh mozzarella,basil,tomatoes with 15yo balsamic-fresh,tasty, good portions.  Would we go back? Well, with a bill of $162 +tip (without the fries) and all the great competition in NYC, we are in no rush.",0,0,0,David E.,"New York, NY",363,21,0

Each drink has its own page where you can see a picture of the drink and its ingredients. If you're looking for wines, you can filter the selections to make your choice easy. Very helpful!

5.0,2/4/2017,"This is a restaurant week 2017 review:My boyfriend and I always try and take advantage of nyc restaurant week, is it is often a way to try some more expensive restaurants at a more affordable price point. We try and really do our homework to avoid going places that aren't a good restaurant week value. We have both heard good things about the capital grille, and with the average steak costing about $40-$50 (not including any sides) we thought restaurant week was the perfect time to try. We were not disappointed. The first course we got the Cesar salad and the wedge. We both preferred the wedge, the thick cut bacon on it was fantastic. The Cesar was good but it was your basic Cesar salad. The bread basket they give you is phenomenal. It comes with a variety of breads, we both wanted to eat the onion focaccia one forever. We both got the dry aged ny strip for our entree with the mashed potatoes. The steak was perfectly medium rare and so incredibly delicious. We got one of each dessert,  chocolate flourless cake and cremebrulee. I love cremebrulee and this one was great. I think looking back we would have just gotten two of those (the chocolate cake was good but very rich after a big meal. We had a wonderful experience. The decor was beautiful and staff was friendly. We had a reservation on a Friday night during restaurant week and were seated immediately. We would absolutely go back and plan to bring his parents next time!

The filet mignon was very tender but needed some salt and pepper. As sides we got the mashed potatoes,creamy too bad it's not meant to be shared and we got string beans with tomatoes. It was a strange combination. We did not care for it. The huge disappointment was the lobster mac and cheese. They delivered it to us after our entrees. It was quite hot.

Only restaurant in New York that we visited where the tip bowl was so offensively in-your-face. There's plenty of room in the restaurant for you to put your coats (we got a booth), so try to forgo the obnoxiousness.  Steak was a little tough but you could taste the beef flavor.

The steaks are one of the best, and darkm clubby atmosphere harkens back to old Hollywood movies, where business deals are made in a smoky backroom. I've visited this location before, and much prefer the one located in Fidi.Given the past experience, I was disappointed. I felt that they didn't put their best foot forward for the level service that an establishment of this caliber is capable of. Despite requesting a booth, I was seated near the frigid entrance (when wind-chill made it below freezing), and when we asked to be relocated, we were told to wait in the lobby or take one of the tables. This despite seeing numerous booths being available. We waited about 15-20 minutes to be relocated.The food (porterhouse steak, chillean seabass), as always was of high quality, but for an establishment of this range (about $300 for 2), that's a given. Part of the allure of coming here in the past was that I'm usually overwhelmed by the level of attention they give to make sure you're a happy camper.

Was invited for a business dinner as we were a group of 28 not easy to find a restaurant to accommodate such a large group. Originally we were scheduled for another restaurant that I was looking forward to but it was explained to me our group was too big not only did we get our own room on the second floor it was open to the entire restaurant so you got to enjoy the wonderful atmosphere. This restaurant was in walking distance from our hotel the Hilton in midtown. Upon arriving we waited about 10 minutes in the lobby until we were lead to our tables. One round and one long table I preferred the round so I could talk to everyone at our table. We had several servers specially designated to our party. Fantastic service as we never went without anything not even for a second. We had a beautifully set menu for our group with more choices and food that one could even eat or drink. We started with seafood towers OMG do they do this right wonderful assortment of the freshest and coldest seafood. Just the way it should be I had one oversized shrimp and I was in heaven. Also the crab was fantastic. Other appetizers were crab cakes another favorite. Our salads were fantastic majority of us had the greens with the roasted Brussels sprouts. Main course if you have the opportunity get the Chilean Sea Bass in short supply so get it while you can before it is extinct. Also they prepare it the best in the world. My portion was gorgeous and so big yes I had to take it with me for a late night snack. For dessert creme brûlée a classic light and always served with the freshest of seasonal berries.

Had a large group so we got a private room which was nice.  Appetizers were very good.   We had lobster which was amazing.    Steak tartare was also good, though was saltier than I'd like it.  Salads were excellent.   Really liked how fresh the greens were, very tasty and well dressed, not drenched. Had the filet steak for main course.   It was delicious, however it was not cooked to how I ordered it.   It was much rarer than medium.   Others had similar issue.   Perhaps just how they define medium is really more rare.  Desserts were excellent as well.  We had one of everything on the menu in the group and no complaints.  Capital Grill is pretty consistent no matter where you go and this was no exception.   It's a strong choice",0,0,0,Mike S.,"Spring, TX",0,68,25

It was a Creme Brulee Cheesecake with strawberries and blueberries. That cheesecake was so nice and creamy and the crunch from the Creme Brulee topping was like icing on the cake. It was very yummy.

3.0,8/1/2016,"*This is a restaurant week rating*-New England Clam Chowder soup was not good, extremely runny and watery.-Wedge salad with blue cheese and bacon is definitely the better choice for the appetizer. The blue cheese dressing was yummy and so were the bacon pieces. -Filet Mignon  was average at best. They couldn't get my temperature right, I ordered medium well and the steak came out medium rare. The actual cut of meat wasnt the best either, this was the first time I experienced fat on my filet mignon. Not impressed. -Sides: mashed potatoes, they were pretty good. String beans: average, nothing to brag or complain about. Creamed Spinach (we ordered this as an extra), did not like it at all, it had a weird taste. Other people at my table said they enjoyed it but I personally didn't find it to be appetizing. -Chocolate Espresso Cake: very rich and heavy, first few bites were enjoyable but after that I was done with it. We decided to do the ""generous pour"" for $28 extra per person. It's supposed to come with 7 tastings of wine but we did 3 glasses instead. I think this was a good deal and would recommend giving it a try. The generosity of the pours is based on who is serving you, our waiter was pretty generous for the most part. Based on this experience, i would not reccommend coming here for restaurant week. I do feel if I came outside of restaurant week, my experience would be better.

4.0,7/28/2016,"A great choice for business lunch or dinner near Rockefeller Center. As Capital Grille's usually are, this one is cavernous and inviting in the old school boys club kind of way. A large bar and wall of private wine cubbies greets you if you enter on 51st, but you can also enter from within the lobby of the Time Life building. Grab a booth table if you can since they're roomy and cozy. It's never too loud, but with the right level of din to hold serious, or not-so-serious, conversations. The food here is consistently good and on par with the other locations. They're obviously famous for their steaks but I also like their fish dishes. The salmon with Marcona almonds was fantastic. Oh and don't miss the truffle fries, they're fantastic! It's not cheap, but when the nearby options include Ted's and Bill's (what's up with the generic guy named bars?), Capital Grille will always be my go-to.",2,2,2,Ahu S.,"New York, NY",122,450,87

We ordered off of the Theatre menu, which was $39 with your choice of a soup/salad, a main entree, an accompaniment, and a dessert. This was a great price because the portions were big and the food was delicious. The restaurant is classy and modern and the ambience is nice, with dim lighting and a quiet atmosphere. There is a bar in the front of the restaurant that looked like a perfect place to grab cocktails with friends. We were seated at a lovely booth and greeted immediately by our waitress.

I was expecting a small, side-order portion but this one was like an entrée. I did love the fresh greens and freshly grated cheese. Entrées:*Seared Salmon - I loved it. The salmon was cooked with a light citrus glaze and accompanied with green beans. I liked it because it was light and healthy. The portion was also big, so I ended up taking it home. I highly recommend this dish. *Kona Crusted Sirloin with Shallot Butter - My friends ordered this and enjoyed it. They also couldn't finish it and took it home.  This comes highly recommended as well!!Dessert:*Creme Brûlée - Yummmm. Topped with raspberries, blueberries and strawberries, I loved it! *Flourless Chocolate Cake - Recommend this if you're a chocolate lover. It is dense but not too sweet. Try it it you like chocolate. *Trio of Homemade Ice Creams - This wasn't a fave of ours. There was a little aftertaste with some of the flavors that was a little different. Won't be ordering this again.  I must add that the bread basket was quite impressive. There were at least five or more different types of breads to try and all were delicious.

This is definitely a place that if not jacket required, it's you'd feel weird if you didn't have a jacket. To celebrate, a few of us got some drinks--hefty prices but not unexpected in midtown.For entrees, three of us got steaks, two got the salmon salad, one for the sea bass and one got the citrus salmon. For dessert, we shared the sorbet, crime brûlée and warm chocolate cake. Everything was fantasist. Beautifully seasoned, great flavor and had excellent presentation. The graduation girl got the filet mignon with caramelized onions and mushrooms and those mushrooms might have been the best mushrooms I ever had in my life! Our desserts were wonderful--I'm a big fan of crime brûlée and this one did not disappoint.Our waitress was very attentive throughout.

It was the worst night of my life!! This wouldn't have been that terrible of an experience if the Capital Grille actually did something about it, but they did NOTHING. That's correct, NOTHING! I called them several times and each time I called the manager told me they were going to take care of me and make up for my lost dinner, lost show, and a night in the city throwing up for 10 hours straight! I also missed a day of work on Monday to recover from this horrific night. All Capital Grille had to do was get me a gift certificate to come back and maybe replace my broadway tickets and this would've all went away, but after speaking to them in January I have heard NOTHING from them. Horrible customer service!! They are not about the customer, clearly!

2.0,3/4/2016,"First off, I am not a big review-type person, but I felt this was necessary.We have all been to a steakhouse and know the standard fare. At first glance, this is what The Capital Grille appears to be, another run-of-the-mill upscale steakhouse. However, the food was lackluster in comparison.The starters we chose (French Onion Soup and the Wedge Salad) were definitely the highlight of the meal. The soup was delicious and the wedge was flawless. If I was in the neighborhood, I would consider dropping in for these and a glass of wine. Maybe.For our entree, my date and I shared the porterhouse steak and lobster mac 'n cheese. The steak was perfectly cooked to medium rare, as requested, and had a good taste but was very much at room temperature. Not hot or warm in the slightest. That wasn't great. The noodles in the mac 'n cheese seemed to have been boiled for about 2 minutes - very hard. And the crisp on top and lack of sauce did not help in any way. Only made the noodles worse.The waiter seemed to be very new and unprofessional. There was another employee at the table next to us listening to his Beats by Dr. Dre headphones (not really sure why he was still there if he wasn't actually working), and the two of them started laughing as our waiter (Jeffrey) was telling us the specials. He did not enhance the meal in any way and did not visit our table nearly enough to see how everything was.I never send food back at restaurants. I believe it is a risk you take when you choose to walk into a restaurant. If it's not good, lesson learned and you don't go back. If it is good, you go back.

When we were seated our server promptly came by and suggested the nightly specials and the restaurant favorites.

5.0,2/6/2016,"Four of us went here last night before seeing a Broadway show and it was a great choice. The atmosphere is one of a dimly lit, traditional, impressive steakhouse. We've been to the Capital Grille on 42nd Street also, but that location seemed more open, lighter and modern. It's just my impression, I guess, and it all depends on what you like. We all enjoyed this location (51st Street) very much.We reserved a table for an early (6pm) dinner and were seated quickly. Drink orders were taken and served right away also, which was very well appreciated! Dark horse Cabernet was great.  Our waiter, Bill Sheridan, was excellent - very cordial, while being very professional. He was helpful in our choosing from the menu, and made us feel like we were regulars there. Great job!It was Restaurant Week so we all had the special filet mignon main course, which was a nice size (8-10 oz)  and an excellent, tender cut, especially for the price ($38 for all 3 courses). Wedge salad also good. Sides were Sam's potatoes and creamed spinach, also very good. We also ordered a separate seafood tower appetizer which was a little pricey ($99) but well worth it. It was shared by all 4 of us and we had more than enough to go around, all delicious and fresh. Finished with Creme Brulee and it was good but would have been better if it came out warm, not cold.We all left very happy and well fed - can't wait to go back!",0,0,0,Rick H.,"West Islip, NY",0,15,0

We ended up waiting more than 45 min to be seated. They kept telling us ""Your table will be ready shortly"".. (I had to be somewhere by 9pm and needless to say I was late to the meeting.) I understand things can get crazy during restaurant week but no one apologized to us or tried to make up for keeping us wait that long. How unprofessional and inconsiderate.

2.0,2/3/2016,"You should walk a few doors down to Ruth's Chris instead! Came for restaurant week dinner on a Tuesday with a friend.Wine:$29 dark horse bottle Cabernet - great for the price! Best thing about this restaurant. You get 1 star for that.Starter: Caesar saladBlue cheese wedge salad with bacon I had the wedge and thought too much dressing and I love bacon but the size of the pieces was conflicting with the salad I believe. Entree:Bone-in strip (14oz) Filet mignon (10oz) Both dishes came out looking like sad, airplane food. Both looked dry visually. I had the filet and it was DRY and I got it medium. It was so depressing that I didn't bother trying my friend's steak but he also said it wasn't so good. We both agreed these steaks were at the bottom of our list.Dessert:Both got the creme brûlée and I personally like more of the custard and a thin layer of the caramelized sugar but it tasted more like 1/2 and 1/2 so it was too intense for me. My friend, however, destroyed his and my leftover so this is subjective. Service:I won't put our server on blast but I do know his name well. We both felt kind of forgotten and service was slow and it's a Tuesday night! It didn't seem to be crazy busy so no excuse. He's a very friendly guy when you do catch him but overall, not attentive. Ambiance:Nice setting, feels very warm and cozy. I guess that is a plus, I'll add another star for that (from my initial 1!)

The service was impeccable, our waiter Edgar always made sure we were well-taken care of by checking on us every so often. Only one hiccup was that they forgot to bring out our Fried Calamari appetizer until I asked about it when the entrees were being brought out. So Edgar apologized and comped it out of our bill, as well as gave us a voucher for a free Calamari appetizer during our next visit at any Capital Grille. We all ordered from the Restaurant Week menu and were overall pleased with the selection. For appetizers we all had the caesar salad, which was a little overdressed and not as impressive as the waiters talked it up to be. For the entree, I had the 14 oz. Bone-In NY Strip cooked medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. We had a bottle of Cuvée Alexandre Cabernet Sauvignon to keep us warm and rosy. The highlight of the meal was the mashed potatoes, which were so buttery with some potato skins mixed in.

2.0,1/4/2016,"*2.5 - Following a day in the city the week after Christmas (Dec. 28) we came to Capital Grille for dinner. Despite arriving about 10 minutes before our reservation, we were seated in just a few minutes in the back by the wine cellar which was a beautiful, private feeling spot. Edgar was our primary server. At TCG, they've switched to an electronic menu for the wine which is sometimes nice if the software is user friendly but in this case it was not. We asked for a hard paper copy of the wine list for easier searching, but TCG has gone all digital with wine - no more paper lists. Though the food menus are paper. After attempting to search for a good wine by the glass, we went with ordering a cocktail instead.To start, we ordered the mozzarella, tomato and basil salad with aged Balsamic and the field greens salad with tomatoes, fresh herbs and a Parmesan vinaigrette. The greens salad was nice and refreshing but a tad overdressed. As for the mozzarella salad, we remarked that it was ok but nothing exceptional as well as the mozzarella wasn't as creamy as one would expect it to be. Shortly after our appetizers were cleared, we got our entrees; double cut lamb rib chops and the sesame-seared tuna for me. Cutting through the middle of the lamb chops, we could easily tell that they were not right. Of the four, only one was done correctly and another semi correct. So while they may have not been to the point of being inedible, we had higher expectations for TCG. My tuna, which was sushi-grade was correctly properly and the gingered rice was nice and fluffy. The tuna came with three different ""sauces"" as our waiter explained it in small individual dishes. Of the three, only one tasted right for the tuna. Overall, our recent experience here was fine. Nothing awful but for a steakhouse, the restaurant/chef should know better how to even cook several lamb chops and, as with any hospitable restaurant, patrons should not feel as though their server is trying to run them out of it. I wouldn't say he wasn't attentive but rather he was a little rough and insincere. At the end when we were deciding between the two of us whether to stay for another drink or go somewhere else, he quickly swooped up the menu and said ""Ok, so then you're all right?"" and left before we could even have a chance to respond.",5,1,1,Sarah M.,"Washington, DC",730,253,195

I ordered the filet mignon and it was very tender, juicy, and delicious. I would definitely order it again. I also ordered wine. It was my first time trying wine and I was clueless on which to choose. Our waitress explained the difference in certain wines, like taste and strength. I tried the Meiomi, and it was too strong and bitter. Luckily, the filet mignon helped me mask the taste. Next time, I'll try something lighter and sweeter.Overall, the experience was great!

We ordered a bottle of wine and a filet mignon each with mashed potatoes and the lobster mac and cheese to share. We did not order an appetizer, but our waiter brought us Caesar salads anyways, which were delicious. Our entrées came and the steak was cooked to perfection and the mashed potatoes were soo delicious. When we were finished (aka to stuffed to eat anymore because we left with doggy bags), our waiter brought us the dessert menu. We told him we were too full for dessert.

Mine was perfectly cooked and tender but a little bland apart from the pepper. I also found the sauce to be underwhelming. We had he creamed spinach and the fingerling potatoes as our sides. The spinach was good: standard steakhouse fare. The potatoes were extremely underdone. As we were keeping our eye out for our server, the manager, Melissa, stopped by to check on our meal.

We had the lobster crab cakes for an appetizer and they were near perfect, moist, great balance of lobster and crab. For main dishes we had the surf and turf and the scallops. Being blunt, the cook on fish station needs to be fired or demoted to commis. The scallops were not a little over cooked, they were grossly over cooked as was the lobster tail with the surf and turf. Both dishes should have never left the kitchen. This is amateurish and what you would expect from Applebee's, not The Capital Grille.

We also decided to share the bone dry crusted sirloin, filet with lobster tail, scallops and lamb chops. We also had a size of asparagus. The scallops with mushroom risotto was my absolute favorite.

""It's impossible"" he claimed.  I asked him to check our reservation to see where we sat but he refused. ""Our cleaners would have found any bags left"".Well if you have been in the dark restaurant and looked under the booth with lots of nooks and crannies, it certainly would be possible for a small bag to be left under the seating area. Also if it was found by the cleaning crew last night, what kind of top restaurant has dishonest cleaners who wouldn't turn over a shopping bag. In either case it's just despicable.While the shopping bag certainly might not be there, it is beyond bad service to refuse to check the booth or with their cleaners.  We spent $500 on a dinner for four and it will be the last time I ever eat at any of the Capital Grilles.  There are too many other fine steak houses, including Ruth's Chris right next door and Mastro's a block away to settle for either bad service or dishonesty.",1,1,1,Ray A.,"Westport, CT",2,6,3

Now this is where I take one star off. The lobster tails were totally overcooked - for this to be one of the priciest dishes on their menu it should of been perfection.

You'd be surprised by how many times you can pay +$50 for steak and have it cooked wrong or be served subpar quality steaks. The second thing I love most is their bread. To me, the quality of their breadbasket says a lot about their restaurant. The breads are always warm, flavorful, and mouthwatering. I really don't like bread/carbs in general because they are empty calories but I think I almost ate 2 baskets all by myself. For dessert, I highly recommend their flourless chocolate cake. OMG I am salivating at the thought of the soft chocolate ganache melting in my mouth again... I highly recommend the lobster mac and cheese to share- it's the perfect consistency of what a mac and cheese should be... crunchy on the top and warm and gooey in the middle with the pasta being in the middle of al dente and cooked all the way through. A meal here would mean to starve during the rest of the week but it is well worth it. Just an FYI- if you're ordering a bone-in steak cooked medium rare, I suggest eating up to the bone area and having that part cooked a little longer because sometimes it seems completely raw.",0,0,0,Liz H.,"Long Island City, Queens, NY",0,40,1

The clam chowder was great, my Caesers salad was OK. The fillet was perfect. The sides (spinach and mashed potatoes) were excellent. All of the desserts were fine. My iced cream was the best I can remember. We ordered a red Zindfandel for $50 which was delicious (Edmeades 2012). Having dined at a number of fine Manhatten steak houses, I can say this place is up there. Everyone enjoyed the dinner. Ordering off the dinner menu would have cost twice as much.

The 3rd order had the left over the dark part of the fish which was slimy and smell very fishy. I didn't want to complaint to my waiter because if i requested another plate don't know what extra 'thing' they might add to my plate. The head chef or manager need to keep an eye what is being serve to customers before they bring it out. The rest of our party of 8 had steaks, chicken and lobster mac n cheese.  It was good nothing much to raved about it other than the fact that  it's very expensive compare to other restaurants nearby.",0,0,0,Beth L.,"Little Italy, Manhattan, NY",2,45,2

Hey..I like wine and 8 being more than I usually enjoy during one meal I was up for the challenge!Service: I normally rate food first as I feel it's the most important but in this case our waiter Robert really made the visit special. Explained the full menu plus the Restaurant Week choices fully and made excellent suggestions. Suggested the perfect wine pairings from the salad through the dessert course, perfect service!!!Food: We were very fortunate to be here during restaurant week. $38 for a salad, entree, side dish, and dessert was quite a bargain at this establishment. Our party ordered the Caesar Salad, the classic Wedge Salad, Filet Mignon, Grilled Salmon and based on Robert's recommendation, I upgraded my dry aged sirloin to the Kona Bone In Dry Aged sirloin. The food was excellent, if I were in private I would have been gnawing the meat off that sirloin bone! The generous pour...Robert matched the wine perfectly with my courses and were a bargain at $28. Robert even refreshed my Syrah because it paired well with my dessert!Atmosphere: Classy, classic, elegant, but we did not feel like it was a stuffy establishment. Great feel and the people actually make it feel very warm.Value: Pricey but what a great deal with Restaurant Week.

My friend and i came here for restaurant week dinner and ordered both on and off that menu. Their wedge salad is always a good way to start. That with some calamari and you've got yourself a party in your mouth! Of course their steaks are prepared just as desired - I just wish that out server placed my medium rare steak in front of me instead of my friend. And you can't go wrong with their asparagus and mashed potatoes! Finally some cheese cake and creme brûlée to end the night...and a good way to end the night at that!Don't expect your bill to be on the cheaper side- you might be able to do that if you only stick to the restaurant week menu, but not if you get a bottle of wine and order off too.

Worked out perfectly since we had about an hour to eat. My 3 course meal consisted of Caesar salad, salmon, and creme brûlée. The food itself was satisfying. Service on the other hand was somewhat friendly and strange. We were first greeted and served by a female bartender, but toward the middle and end of our meal she completely tuned us out. A gentleman bartender took over and took care of our needs. The place itself is extremely beautiful the workers on the other hand seemed too pretentious. Would I return?

The stacked Bibb salad was fresh with tons of strawberries and a tangy vinegarette. The potato bisque was creamy (without cream) with just enough texture to not taste like baby food. Truffle fries were okay- they definitely could have used a healthier dose of truffle oil and garlic. Creme brûlée was classic, with a thin sugar crunch and tons of yummy fruit on top. It was creamy and custardy without being too eggy. Ambiance is nice but not required dressy- we actually ended up swinging by last minute for creme brûlée only, dressed in tennis shoes and shorts, but the menu looked so good we ate full on meals!

Going in with high expectations from our DC experience we weren't sure that it would hold up.Well, it sure did. Our server was Sarah B. from Montana, what a friendly and professional woman. Greeted us with a huge smile and talked to us like we had known her for some time.Being somewhat a creature of habit (and knowing that what we had in DC was the perfect size and delicious), we ordered the same thing. Calamari appetizer, Dry Aged Sirloin and split it. Trust me, that was plenty of food for a normal couple to enjoy. In my previous life, or maybe even one of these days in the future I'll go for the larger steaks just to try. Everything was perfect, including the wine. Even had some leftover steak that my wife couldn't finish that I planned on taking back to the hotel for a midnight snack. When we left it started raining on us and we enjoyed walking in the rain in NYC, not caring at all about getting wet. Saw a homeless guy living on cardboard and he was getting soaked. I handed him my bag of leftovers and his response was ""God Bless You, and thank you"". I'm sure that when he got into the bag and had some of that leftover steak he probably thought he won the lotto.Long story short, service was exceptional and food was GREAT.

I'm sure they do this for everyone who dines there on their birthday. It still made me feel special and it was so thoughtful. A lot of these places you'll be lucky if you get a free dessert or happy birthday. So bravo for going above and beyond. The complimentary dessert and champagne was a plus. FOODThe calamari was delicious. Crisp yet tender and I absolutely love hot cherry peppers in my calamari. The crab cake was so lack luster. Under seasoned, underwhelming and uninspired. I wanted it to taste fresher and have more crab. The corn succotash that accompanied it was great.They had a special of lobster bisque that was a total fail. I honestly believe they were trying to get rid of the clam chowder they have on the regular menu. The lobster bisque did not taste like lobster nor did it have much lobster in it and the texture was weird. Total waste of $15 for that small cup. The double cut lamb chops were heavenly. Cooked a perfect medium they were tender and seasoned well. Seared tenderloin with butter poached lobster tailWas divine. Steak was cooked a perfect medium rare and lobster was cooked perfectly literally melted in my mouth. They also had a king crab special with steak. I didn't want the steak so I just asked for a side of crab. I couldn't believe they charged me $28 for that less than half portion of crab with 3 legs pieces attached. It essentially tasted like nothing. Honestly I believed the chef shocked it in some boiling water then put it on a plate to be served. I was baffled by the lack of care and flavor.For dessert we had the coconut cream pie and the chocolate hazelnut cake. I didn't expect to like the cream pie as much as I did. I thought it would be cloyingly sweet and it was surprisingly well balanced. Had a lot of different textures ranging from crunchy, creamy and chewy which was very nice. The hazelnut cake was good. It could have benefited from being left out at room temp a little before serving the ganache and mousse was a little to stiff. Good flavor though. SERVICEEveryone was superb from the hostess down to the bussers. Polite, smiling, water glasses never went empty our server was very funny and chatty but in a good way which I loved.

Anyhow, let's focus on the ambient, staffs and food.Staffs here were very welcoming and came by the table more often than you think to see how everything was going which wasn't bad. This place was all dimmed but good enough with some light where you don't have to turn your flash on to take pics. **Now for food. I came here thinking whatever I order will be small portions so why not get some appetizers along. I ordered the sliced filet mignon with caramelized onion and mushroom, to die for! It has a sweet taste which brought out the the meat flavor along with the mushroom! I had it cooked medium rare and that's the way to eat it. The middle was pink, not red so there was not blood dripping. It was the best dish I had!! I also ordered the half a dozen of oysters. The oysters were very thinly sliced and long. I must say it tastes very fresh and delicious. There were maybe one or two sand in the oysters, but that's normal. My bad ordered the 14oz ages sirloin steak and it was huge and thick. We both ordered medium rare on our meats. His however, due to the thickness, medium rare looked like it was so raw inside. I couldn't even swallow the center raw part which was disappointing, but my bad enjoyed it so its really preference. Along with his steak, he also ordered a jumbo crab cake cocktail. Do not order this. It tastes and looked like those meats you pull out of a king crab and dip it into sauce. That was it. Nothing special. Lastly we ordered the cheesecake.

I was told this would be something in between medium and medium well, but it was basically just medium well. Despite that, it was very tender, which is impressive. As for the overall dish, the cheese was unsurprisingly very strong and overpowered everything else. It was good though, especially since I like Gorgonzola. We also ordered two side dishes to share - truffle fries, and Brussels sprouts with bacon and Parmesan. They were both pretty good; I prefer thin fries and these were on the thicker side, but they were seasoned and cooked very well.

I've been here over a dozen times and they never let me down, in fact, it gets better every time.  This is a world class establishment.  Nevermind that, yes, it is a chain - a very high-end restaurant chain mind you - this does nothing to detract from its quality.  (I should note that I have only been to the 51st street location, however, I have heard from several people that the other locations do not disappoint.)   I first came here for Restaurant Week in the late 2000s and so thoroughly enjoyed myself that I have been back nearly every Restaurant week since, with a few visits in between.  Be prepared for the cost - this is New York City after all, and this is a high-end restaurant - but it is worth every dollar and more - and I can be quite the frugal customer believe me.Food - Steaks as good as any steakhouse (my favorite being Keen's) all of the food that this restaurant prepares is just superb.  Seafood, pork, chicken, vegetables, desserts - you name it, I've had it here - and it was GREAT!  Staff - Utterly professional: courteous, knowledgeable, friendly, helpful, respectful - everything any business should want in their employees and management.  The staff have been fantastic every time and a true asset to the establishment.Location (51st) - Beautiful, Tasteful, Business Casual - a large ground floor with an open layout and very high ceilings, dozens of tables and booths for up to 8, separate waiting area and huge bar (gorgeously done); there is also a 2nd level with several smaller rooms that are used for open dining or can be reserved for larger parties.  In fact, Ive been here with large groups on several ocassions (up to 22 once I believe) and each time it went off without a hitch.  The first time I didnt think to make a reservation for that many people (turned out to be 20 when I thought only 10 would show).  Being unaware of the upstairs and peering into the nearly full-dining area, I was dubious that we would get seated at all.  The staff didnt skip a beat - a quick 'right this way' from the excellent hostess our large party weaved its way congo-line style through the main dining area to the back, up the stairs and into our own private room...perfection!!  I think the bill for that night came to under $1000 - ridiculously low for that many people, granted that was on the dinner prix fix menu @ like $35 per person but we all drank 1 to 3 drinks each.  Dinner for 4 when I took my Mom and Aunt one time on the regular menu was under $200 - so well within the range of reasonable for a high-end dinner out in Manhattan.You guys are the BEST!",0,0,0,Bryan C.,"Torrance, CA",27,39,6

1.0,4/30/2015,"They need to be more professional... This place is beautiful from the moment you walk in the decor is very welcoming and so are the three people behind the hostess desk but that's where the smile and the great service stops. I ordered the lunch entree salad with the seared salmon and mango had no idea that the dressing was going to be put onto my salad I was never asked for an option nor was I asked if I would like it on my salad or on the side. as we walked to our table , the maitre d never bothered to pull my chair out for me as a woman I found that a little bit rude if you think that's the worst thing wait. the next thing that happened was as we enjoyed our lunch while the food was tasty the waiter didn't offer a wine list instead he got me a glass of what he felt I would like which wasn't bad but I would like to have known the name of what I was drinking. Next thing, without asking our check was placed on our table again without asking another waitress grabbed it walked away only to return back to our table saying there's nothing inside of it, well that's because we didn't ask for the check yet but I did ask for a second glass of wine which had not been received to our table poor customer service skills in addition to that the last and most insulting thing was this luncheon meeting was held with a diplomat to the UN who gave an ID and rather than give an explanation the waiter came over with a pen and an application form telling us that we needed to fill that out in order for him to get his exemption apply to the check how rude even though he visits this restaurant every two weeks overall I would say wow this place is beautiful and it can be so much better I think the wait staff needs to be trained a little bit more as far as hospitality, the kitchen staff needs to learn how to plate food correctly so that what you taste will appear just as good when eating it I give this restaurant really a half star because of the service I wish that was possible but oh well its not all that",0,0,0,Eneri I.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",93,64,141

2.0,3/11/2015,"Came here for a RW lunch and thought it was just alright. Service here is a little strange - friendly, but in almost an offputting way. I asked the server to recommend a couple of dishes to me and he basically read me the entire menu then cackled to himself. Then, when the burgers came out, we asked the other server which ones were medium and which one was medium rare and our original server came by and cut us off and remarked ""we go by seat number! stop asking him!"" ....Anyway, we had the soup, burger with truffle fries, and a creme brulee/chocolate cake. Soup was good albeit a little small, burger was an extremely large portion and just okay, truffle fries were good, and creme brulee was disappointing.

Continuously asking if we are done if each plate while I was still eating from it.. was annoying. Good service (with good food) makes customers return.

4.0,2/26/2015,First let me start by saying this is definitely a popular restaurant. It's restaurant week in NYC and my friend and I saw this restaurant on the list and got excited. I made reservations for 7:30 and got here a little earlier than that time so we had to wait. Nonetheless when we were seated the hostess forgot to give us the restaurant week menu. She ended up coming a little later with it. The selection on the menu was awesome so we other from the restaurant week menu. It's a little loud but you can still have a conversation. It was busy so we had to ask a few times for certain things but the waiter was patient and polite. We both ordered the filet with mash and beans. The portions are a good size. The drinks are fairly good. The ambiance is beautiful and comforting. I don't recommend this restaurant for big parties but more so for like a intimate setting or the most 5 people.

We stopped by around 6:30 on Saturday night to have a couple drinks and an appetizer before seeing Wicked.  We got a seat at the bar which was about half full. The bartender came over and told us up front that he was working alone that night. We had a few drinks and ordered the calamari, which in my opinion, is the best you can get in Philly. It took almost 30 minutes to arrive, and once it did, it just tasted off to me. I have ate a 3 other Capital Grille locations besides Philly and here, and they were all about the same, other than Scottsdale. Everything at the Scottsdale restaurant was horrible. Anyway back to NY, the calamari was edible but tasted a little dry, and seemed to have more breading on it than usual. It might have sat for a while before coming out to me, as it wasn't really that hot.

5.0,1/13/2015,"Wow, where should I start with this review.  Okay I suppose I'll start from the beginning of the evening.Me and my two friends were staying at the W Times Square Hotel on 47th and Broadway.  While searching for a place to dine we popped open the Yelp app on my iPad and found the Capital Grille, located at 120 W. 51st St., in the hundred or so restaurants located within four or five square blocks of the hotel.  It seemed to get pretty positive reviews with average of 4 out of 5 stars given by Yelp user reviewers, and also seemed to receive a decent number of reviews, with 400+ total reviews posted, if I remember correctly.  I typically use the total number of reviews metric as an indicator of whether a restaurant is popular enough that people are impelled to go back online to leave reviews after dining there.When we arrived we chose to sit in the bar area so we could watch the Panthers at Seahawks playoff game.  The place was not very busy most likely due to the bone chilling 18° temperature outside in New York City.  I believe this worked in our favor for the evening because we ended up with extremely attentive service and super fast food delivery times.  So upon entering, we grabbed a cocktail table and were greeted within a minute or two by the bartender Jeremy.Throughout the entire evening Jeremy constantly checked on us to make sure our water glasses were never empty and made top notch drinks - the perfect combination of alcohol and accouterment.  I prefer strong drinks and these drinks had plenty of kick and were a joy to consume.  Quite tasty indeed!We ordered several rounds of appetizers.  The two appetizer dishes we enjoyed most were the lobster macaroni and cheese, and lobster and crab cakes.  We actually stumbled upon the lobster mac and cheese and Jeremy mentioned it was a great choice, as that appetizer is one of the most popular dishes on the menu.  It was absolutely incredible.We also tried the 10 ounce filet mignon entrée, and ordered some sides of creamed spinach, and asparagus, along with the wedge salad with blue cheese and bacon and lollipop lamb chops.  The food was literally on our table within five minutes of ordering.  Oh I forgot to mention that the chef actually sent out complimentary sautéed wild mushrooms (which were very juicy and flavorful) and Sam's mashed potatoes for us to nibble as a courtesy for dining there that evening.  It was quite clear that the Capital Grille staff was genuinely happy to have us in their establishment and wanted us to thoroughly enjoy the experience.After finishing our food, we proceeded to order our last round of drinks, and Jeremy brought three glasses of the pineapple-infused vodka (Stoli Doli) sitting behind the bar as well!  The perfect digestif to an outstanding dining experience.The last thing on which I would like to comment was the atmosphere and décor of the restaurant.  The ambience was warm and soft with a subtle yet energetic feeling permeating throughout the dining room and bar.  The quality and finish of the furniture and interior décor was clearly a result of top notch workmanship and materials.  Simply a beautiful restaurant - well decorated and properly lit to create the perfect dining atmosphere.After our superb experience this past weekend, my friends and I have agreed to make this a must visit on any future trips to Manhattan.  I strongly recommend you spend a few hours to visit this place one evening while in the City.  You won't be disappointed!",1,0,0,Brian M.,"Washington, DC",3,2,1

2.0,1/3/2015,"My parents were in town for the weekend and as per tradition, I took them to a steakhouse. I had recently taken my sister to the location in midtown east for her birthday and we had a phenomenal time; I decided to give this location a try because my parents were staying closer to this location. I will preface this with the fact that this was restaurant week.When we first arrived, the restaurant was packed. There were probably about 6 or more groups waiting for a table in the main entry way. I actually ran into someone using the revolving door because people were so jammed in there. I arrived 15 minutes early for my reservation and tried to check in. They could not find my reservation under my name, so the hostess politely called the other location. I checked in again and we found my reservation (under a different last name). We were seated about 20 minutes late, but didn't mind as we were enjoying wine at the bar. (the hostess was awesome! Friday evening 2/21)We were shown to a table by a very unfriendly gentleman. I had seen a couple other parties sat and the people who showed them their tables (they have about 3 people doing this) were very friendly and polite and explained the menu options. Ours however clearly had an issue with seating us the 50 feet from the hostess stand. This began the rude encounter of dinner.Our waitress approached the table, but did not introduce herself. I believe her name was Tracie, but could be mistaken as I was too scared to look her in the eye. She took about 5 minutes to fill our water glasses and then another 10 before she bothered to check back for a drink order. She was rude from the very moment she took our wine order.As people have mentioned- the bread basket here is amazing. So delicious. We opted to order from the pre-fixe menu because it is a pretty good deal. As we were placing our order, the waitress continued her snobby attitude. When attempting to order the caesar salad with no dressing, the waitress looked at me and said ""you do realize thats just a plate of romaine lettuce?"" Having ordered this before, I know that this in fact includes cheese and croutons as well. She proceeded to have a 30 second argument about this. After taking my order, she continued to my mother. Now I realize to give five minutes to a table is precious time in the serving industry (I have a serving job as well), but I have NEVER cut anyone off. As my mother was deciding her dessert the waitress was apparently too busy to wait the 30 seconds and cut my mother off and continued to my father.When the salads came, they placed all the wrong orders in front of the wrong patron. I am pretty sure that you use seat numbers at this restaurant to avoid this type of issue. When we all swapped salads, we finally dug in. They were OK. The mixed green salad seemed as though it came from a bagged mix and the dressing was watered down.Again, when the entree's showed up, they were delivered to the wrong patron. While I realize this is nit-picking, it is still supposed to be a ""high end"" steakhouse. The entree's were subpar. The cook on the steaks were all correct, but they lacked seasoning. Our waitress barely asked how our food was, let alone offered any fresh pepper as I saw all the other waiters offering their tables. This would have helped with the flavor inconsistency. Dessert was the highlight of the evening, but I highly doubt they have their own pastry chef in house. If they do- Delicious and amazing! All in all it was a pretty disappointing experience. My parents never complain about service and enjoy dining in NYC because they are not from here. However, even my parents thought it was pretty bad. As a server, I always leave 20% even if the service isn't my favorite because this is someones income. However, we did NOT leave 20% at this table. I am sure the waitress rolled her eyes and was not happy, however, the tip reflects the service. I wish I could have left less and not have felt guilty about it. She was rude and inattentive.Do yourselves a favor. Hop the subway to grand central and eat at the location in midtown east- it is a much better overall experience.",1,0,1,Cailin D.,"Manhattan, NY",227,3,2
3.0,1/3/2015,"A steakhouse chain well known in other parts. The restaurant itself has a nice piece of real estate near Times Square and midtown for the worker bees during the day. I went on a holiday day but it was not at all busy and now I know why.First the drink menu is on an iPad because they went paperless, the problem with that is that if I cannot make up my mind in a fewSeconds I'm forced to star at an iPad held by another person for however long this indecision occurs. That's no fun. They do have a decent Malbec that goes well will steak.I chose the usual filet. It came out perfectly medium rare but it was otherwise not that interesting just a piece of meat for my mouth... The Parmesan truffle fries are really good. The mashed potatoes are basically creamed whole potatoes which also are very good. Tastes like a destroyed fresh potato in my mouth.They bring you out a random selection of 'bread' but half of it is a large non salted cracker. However the bread itself is warm which is a nice touch. Still who needs the cracker?Overall as far as fine dining experiences it's not bad. Just don't come here if you're expecting an amazing steak. It's a-ok!",0,0,0,Mary P.,"Brooklyn, NY",602,1551,2818

So props to that.My friend and I ended up getting their theatre pre fixed meal, which was the cheapest and NOT ON THE MENU. I ended up with the steak, which was eh-- I've had better. We also got the lobster mac & cheese, which was also eh as well. Nothing was really memorable or too spectacular for me.The atmosphere/environment was very dim and romantic-- which was absolutely horrible for photos unless you add 10 shots of flash. So if you're trying to instagram, don't even bother-- the lighting is way too dim.Overall, this was a decent place if you're on a strict budget (especially with good seatings at Wicked). But if you're in it for the quality-- you're better off with Ruth Chris. With that said, I doubt I'd come back because STEAK IS VERY IMPORTANT IN MY LIFE.Turn Ons:- Great service.Turn Offs:- Food was mediocre.",3,2,2,Ray N.,"Rosemead, CA",724,540,134

2.0,12/17/2014,Overrated and pricy restaurant. We don't mind spending $$$ on dinner but this left much to be desired. Two out of two steaks ordered by our party was not cooked correctly. Well done was pink in the middle and medium well bleeding red. It's should not happen at a place that specializes in steak. Will not return.

I ordered the clam chowder to start off with, and it's probably some of the best chowder I ever had! For my entrée,  I ordered the chicken and was kind of perturbed by the dry taste it had. I also wish the meal had more side dishes, because the only other food it came with was carrots, which were also a little hard to bite into. For dessert,  I had a delicious chocolate espresso cake, although kind of dry. Overall, I'd give this place a 3, but.......this place had some of the best clam chowder I've ever had and had a cake, that tasted like a mocha espresso from Starbucks.  I'm gonna be generous, and give this place a 4 out of 5.",2,0,1,Matthew W.,"Ridgewood, NJ",28,13,13

They sat us at the table closest to the door so it was freezing every freakin five seconds. Our server Amanda was attentive and sweet, so that at least offset the crap experience we had at the beginning. Massive lag between appetizers and soup. By the time soup got here, they were all lukewarm. As for the filet mignon, either they undercooked my medium and overcooked my brother's medium rare or they reversed the plates, but that was another issue....for desserts, we were looking forward to all the hazelnuts that usually come with the massive slice of chocolate cake, but we were left disappointed. No hazelnuts at all and cake was very dry.

3.0,11/22/2014,"The decor and the inside is very dark. It reminded me of an old world type restaurant or a restaurant from the 50s where the rich dined.While there is no dress code it is a fancy dress place. The men were all in suits and the women were in suits and dresses with Louboutin heels. Seems more like the kind of place that you go to for a fancy dinner. I was there for a celebratory lunch and did feel underdressed as I was not in a suit or dress but they'll take your money anyway.I am a pescatarian so I did not have the steak but from the other reviews it seems that's what they are known for. I had the New England Clam Chowder and a salad with salmon.The clam chowder was good but I felt it was heavy on the potatoes and light on the clams. I prefer my clam chowder to have about a 60/40 clam to potato ratio or higher, this one was more like 25/75 or less.The salmon salad was good but nothing to write home about. They serve the salmon on the side. The chives were not chopped properly so there were just long stalks of chive in the salad. The salad was just not spectacular or anything really, I expected more for a $19 salad.My experience was not terrible and the food was ok but I probably wouldn't go back. I just found it to be overpriced for the food that they were offering and I found the decor to just be dark, imposing, and dreary.

Furthermore, the server didn't seem to give us good suggestions/information when I asked them to recommend good wine and entree. I paid $200 for this dinner with my friend, but I don't feel like services and quality of steak deserve that much $$ bill.

4.0,8/23/2014,"This is the first time that I've been to Capital Grille and it was a really nice experience.  My friend and I came here on the last day of Restaurant Week.  I made a 5:30PM reservation since we had an 8:00PM Broadway show to attend close by.Firstly, the restaurant, located in the Time-Life Building, is spacious and very comfortable.  The color pallet is rich, dark earth tones of browns, black & mahogany. The walls are covered with large paintings, portraits and a few deer heads.  I didn't find the lighting too dim. The waiter we had was excellent.  He was prompt, attentive and most importantly, unobtrusive.   We both ordered the Caesar salad to start and the 10 oz. Filet Mignon with grilled jumbo shrimps ($10 extra).  My friend wanted her steak medium well and I wanted medium rare, being told that the middle would still be a cool pink.  We both ordered one of their signature cocktails.  My friend had The Bohemian, peach vodka, berry cordial topped with champagne and I had The Stoli Doli, Stolichanya vodka infused with fresh pineapple. Both drinks were kind of watered down with mostly the fruit taste coming through.  When my friend complained that she could not taste the alcohol in her drink, the waiter brought it back to the bartender and then returned and told us that the bartender said the drink was made to the restaurant's exact specifications, period. My friend ordered a Sidecar instead and was happy with that.The Caesar Salads that we both had were average.  They lacked flavor and the dressing wasn't any better.  They were very cold and tasted as if they were pre-made and sat in the refrigerator.The steaks were well seasoned and tasty.  We found that both our steaks however, were slightly overcooked.  Mine more so.  Instead or medium rare, it was a definitely medium.  Both still very edible though.  The shrimps were nicely cooked and juicy.For dessert we ordered the cheesecake with the caramelized brulee and the flourless chocolate espresso cake.  Both were very good but not exceptional.All in all, it was a very good dining experience.  The waiter made a big difference and the special pricing for Restaurant Week of $38 definitely made it a deal.  I would go back and try the other items on their very big menu.  My only gripe is the cocktails.  I was surprised that the restaurant did not do anything for my friend after she sent the drink back and ordered something different.  Anyway, I'd still recommend this restaurant as a place to try and would give it 3 1/2 stars.",1,0,0,Norm C.,"East Elmhurst, NY",0,34,34

The filet was cooked perfectly (medium rare). However, the shrimp were not jumbo by any means. It was five almost microscopic baby shrimp on a skewer. I understand it's the restaurant week menu but that was some serious false advertising. For dessert I had the flour-less chocolate cake which was good and I liked the hint of espresso, however, it was difficult to finish because it was so dense.

There was maybe a handful of tables with other customers setting at them the place was pretty much dead. Finally after about 25 minutes we just got up and walked out.

My boyfriend's mom and I had the Lobster Bisque, and it was delicious. There were chunks of lobster in it and it was creamy, perfect. My boyfriend had the Clam Chowder and he couldn't stop talking about how good it was, his also had chunks of clam. Since we weren't too hungry we shared a Porter House with the creamed spinach! Absolute perfection. The Porter House was tender and so juicy. The spinach was finger-licking good. You could taste the spices they used. We had the Pinot Grigio, though I don't remember which one exactly. But it was very good. They have an extensive wine list and plenty of drinks to choose from. It is a pretty pricy place. For the three soups, the porter house, spinach and 3 glasses of wine, plus 20% tip, it came out to about $230-$240. The service though is great. They refer to you by name, take their time to speak to you and listen to what you want.

Both of our steaks came out medium well. She ate hers but I wasn't about to eat an overcooked, $50 Delmonico. The server apologized and brought me a new one. The new one had been seared, but was entirely raw. The manager aplogized, said he was embarrassed, and brought it back. When they brought the second steak back, it was still raw. They sent it back.

1.0,5/18/2014,"If you want to be treated like a second class citizen, order from the Pre-Theater Prix Fix Menu. I was completely blown away by the poor service I received at this Capital Grille location. Two friends and I were watching a Broadway show that night and decided to give Capital Grille's Pre-Theater menu a try. For $39/person, you get an appetizer, entree, side, and dessert.  They only offer it if you come in before 7PM and you have to specifically ask for the menu.We were sat down for our reservation by the hostess and then Jimmy, our server, introduced himself to us.  After he introduced himself to us, we asked if we could see the Pre-Theater menu.  Everything from this point on went straight down hill. The moment we asked for the Pre-Theater menu, our server Jimmy did a complete 180 and we suddenly became second class citizens.  I guess since Jimmy knew our check wasn't going to be as large (less tip) as his other a la carte ordering tables, we didn't matter to him anymore. Service became extremely slow and rude. It really seemed like he didn't care at all about our table. It was a real slap in the face to see him schmoozing with other tables who obviously had a higher check total then us. It took us almost half an hour just to get our check! Once the busser cleared our dessert plates, we were never offered coffee or our check. Jimmy seemed perfectly fine with having us just sit there while he waited on the tables that mattered more to him.  When he finally brought the check, we didn't even get a thank you. When we walked out of the restaurant, he walked right by us like we didn't even exist. I couldn't bring myself to tip less then 20% since I have worked in restaurants for years and know what it's like, but I'm seriously regretting that decision. I've been to other Capital Grilles before and had significantly better experiences.  I cannot say the same about this location. However, this visit has also solidified my opinion that the Capital Grille food quality is 3 stars at best.  If you're in the area and going to spend this much on steak, don't bother with this place, walk 2 blocks over to Del Frisco's.",1,0,0,Eddie C.,"New York, NY",2,49,0

I ordered a medium rare steak and that was exactly what I got.  Unfortunately, I made the mistake of ordering it a little under, expecting them to serve me something more cooked like any other restaurant I've been used to.  I forget that I'm at a reputable steak house/grill and not at my local red lobster.  Capital Grille gave me a true medium rare steak and my other 2 friends ordered the same steak 1 cooked medium and another medium well, were both just as impressive and true.  I could not be more impressed!  For dessert, I had a cheesecake while my friend had a flourless espresso chocolate cake.  You can taste how strong the espresso is in there.  Perfect if you love espresso.  Otherwise, a tad bit lighter on the espresso is more of the average pallet.  My cheesecake is dense and wonderful as well.  The only reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars is that the steak came with nothing but a baby spinach salad.  Plating was not too impressive.  They could have thrown walnuts or figs in the spinach salad or just sautéed it a bit.  There were no other sides to go with the steak which is fine.  The steak alone was the star anyway.  I would have given it 4.5 stars if it was allowed.  The steak was not only cooked to exceed perfection but you can taste that it's been aged!  This is the first steak that had me refusing steak sauce!  I also must mention the attention to detail at this restaurant is impressive as well.  I came here expecting a long lunch hour but they got us in an out in less than an hour.  They understand that people need to get back to work without us even asking and I was impressed!",0,0,0,Serena T.,"New York, NY",38,29,0

Once seated we got our drinks and assortment of bread immediately. I ordered the clam chowder, filet mignon with mashed potatoes and cheese cake with berries. The clam chowder was great, presented in a small bowl with packaged oyster crackers. I wished there were more clams but it was definitely hearty with potatoes. I would recommend getting the clam chowder over the salad. Filet mignon was cooked to perfection and exactly how I liked it cooked, it was extremely tender. Get the mashed potatoes!!! what else can I can say it's mashed potatoes so you know it's good.  The cheese cake was bigger than the piece of filet mignon I had. The cheese cake was pretty complex, top of it was torched like a creme brulee to have this hard caramelized texture. The bottom of the cheese cake had a nice flavorful cracker crust. This was served in some kind of strawberry jam with fresh berries. Unfortunately, this cake was too sweet for my taste.

Maybe could have been seasoned a touch more.  The sides were the winners though. The mashed and green beans were incredible.  I almost asked for extra mashed bc the serving for two was a little small.  But I knew dessert was coming. Good thing I did because dessert quickly became the winner. There was sugar on top that was brûléed. Meaning there was a sweet crisp on top.

4.0,2/24/2014,"**WINTER 2014 RESTAURANT WEEK REVIEW**Two friends and I had a reservation on a Friday night at 7 p.m. While the place wasn't packed, I would still make a reservation - especially if you plan to go during restaurant week. For $38, you get an appetizer, entree, side and a dessert. Here's the rundown:Appetizer - I went with the clam chowder. I'm not crazy about clam chowder but it was good - not overly creamy (which I hate) and there was a good amount of clams in there.Entree - I decided to splurge and go with the extra $10 upgrade option. This was the 18 oz. bone-in Kona crusted dry aged sirloin with shallot butter. I am no steak connoisseur by any means but I do know that I enjoyed every bite of it. The shallot butter was pure heroin. There is no other way to describe it. I couldn't really taste the Kona (Hawaiian coffee) but I didn't mind. At first, I thought 18 oz. might be a little too much - but let's not be silly. There's no such thing as too much steak, right?Side - I chose the French green beans but they were a tad too salty. My friend got the mashed potatoes and as soon as I took a bite, I wish I had gotten that. It was creamy perfection.Dessert - To top off the meal, I had the flourless chocolate espresso cake. This was my first flourless cake experience so I didn't know what to expect. The consistency was almost brownie/chocolate bar-like. I'm probably not explaining it very well but trust me on this one, you can skip it. it was way too chocolatey and rich for my taste. Go for the cheesecake.Wine - I think our server mentioned there were over 1000 (?) different bottles of wine. Some are pretty reasonably priced too. You can get a bottle for $30. We weren't sure which to order but we knew we wanted the prosecco. When we asked our server, she seemed pretty knowledgeable. I also appreciated the fact that she told us that the different bottles of prosecco tasted pretty much the same - and didn't try to push a more expensive bottle on us. Which brings me to my next point - service was great! Our server was always checking in on us - refilling our water glasses and more importantly, our prosecco glasses!The Capital Grill was more of a splurge for me but I would definitely come back for a special occasion. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some daydreaming to do about that shallot butter.",5,0,0,Mel T.,"New York, NY",444,1319,3268
4.0,2/23/2014,"Came here on Friday night for Restaurant Week and ordered the caesar salad, 8 oz filet mignon with the jumbo shrimp upgrade option ($10 extra), mashed potatoes, and cheesecake for dessert. The ""caesar salad"" that came out was actually a garden salad. Me and my friend realized this mix-up when actual caesar salads were brought out to the table next to us. Not cool. Filet mignon was juicy and tender, but the sauce(?) was a little sweet for my liking. My upgrade option came with 3 grilled jumbo shrimps, and they were cooked to perfection! Very nice addition to my meal. My other friend ordered a medium rare kona crusted sirloin and it was VERY good, but on the chewy side. The sauce on her steak was delicious. Mashed potatoes were very good - creamy and soft. The cheesecake was good, but the top of the cake had a burnt taste to it. It wasn't exactly bad, but I could have done without it. Their wine menu is VERY extensive -- I think our waitress mentioned over a thousand options. We ordered a $30 bottle of prosecco and we really enjoyed it!Service was amazing. Our waitress checked up on us often, and was really friendly the whole time. I didn't get a single bad vibe from her, or anyone working there for that matter. Good steak! Definitely come here for restaurant week - you will not be disappointed.

I don't say that to be pejorative.  There are times when I want a 20-seat bistro with a creative menu.  There are also times when I want a 12 oz steak and a jumbo shrimp cocktail.  When I want the latter, I seek out places like The Capital Grille, which is essentially the same deal as all of the other major NYC steakhouses (Smith & Wollensky, Ruth's Chris, etc).  The shrimp and oysters were amazing.  The filet mignon was great.

3.0,2/2/2014,"Oh Capital Grille...I had such high hopes for you! I've been wanting to eat at your restaurant, ever since you took over space in the monstrosity known as the Beverly Center and you made it so pretty. But I suppose that the Beverly Center is another whole review...In any case, I'm living in NYC now, and visited the midtown location. And here are my thoughts:Ambiance: Capital Grille is beautiful...love the steakhouse-vibe it has (as it should). Everything, including the restrooms, are spotless. I can't fault CG in this area.Service: The waiter was super nice but he kept disappearing. We had to ask another waiter to find him, just so we could place our order. Strange.Food: The only good thing about our meal? The phenomenal bread basket. I mean, this was an AMAZING bread basket, and I have very high standards when it comes to bread.For $43 I had the pleasure of not enjoying my entree of sea bass (I think?) in a mushroom sauce. The sauce tasted exactly like Campbell's Cream of Mushroom. I don't like Campbell's Cream of Mushroom. So no need to elaborate I suppose? My husband was not impressed with his steak either. ""Ruth's Chris is the best,"" is all he kept repeating. It was annoying but I let him vent. After suggesting CG, I figured it was the least I could do.My daughter ordered the children's burger with fries. I am not a fan of children's menus, even less a fan of hamburger's on a children's menu, but I let her have her way for once. She obviously regretted that, saying ""This burger tastes funny."" Hmm. I bit back a ""Maybe you should listen to our mom next time?""Our sides of steamed broccoli and asparagus were fine, nothing to write home about.The Bottom Line: If I'm being honest, I can get a better piece of fish from Fairway's deli.

We started off with the lobster/crab cakes and those were delish! As our main entree, my husband chose the black cod while I went with the seabass-- both weree just...okay.

5.0,12/2/2013,"When planning our wedding, we decided to splash out a bit on the dinner after wards. We only had about 10 guests, and we were getting married on a Sunday, so we thought this would be easy. NOT SO. Most restaurants would not bother with us, we did not have enough people to book a private room, or they weren't open Sunday, or would not respond to my email. Capital Grille did respond to my email, and despite the fact I would have preferred to have booked at a non-chain, we decided on here. They would let us book a private room of our choosing for whatever length of time we wanted, and only required a minimum spend of $2,000. You would think that would be easy in NYC, but it is not! We picked a price fixe menu, which included a starter, salad, main, dessert, cheese course and seafood add-on and still had $1100 left over to blow on booze- which we totally did.The starters were scrumptious- delicious calamari, beef carpaccio (which I had to lie to my family to get them to eat, but they loved it), and fish cakes even my fish hating husband liked. The salads were salads. The seafood course was amazing for $100.... it had lobster (heads), lots of high quality oysters, lots of large prawns, and some langostinos. It really was a great value. The mains were good, although my husband said the filet was a bit overcooked. My sirloin was cooked to perfection. The desserts were painful to eat, since we were all bursting, but too delicious not to finish. The cheese course was a bit disappointing, as there were no crackers or labels telling us what cheeses there were, but we were all too full to eat them anyways. The service was some of the best we have ever had. The server, Jonathan, was attentive, without drawing attention to himself, very good at anticipating needs (he kept us apprised of the bill constantly, since we were struggling to meet the minimum),  and totally professional.

Five other people in the party ordered the sirloin steak and sadly they looked just as tough as mine.  As I was hosting the dinner, I was anxious that everything went well.  Though they said they enjoyed the steak, I find it hard to believe anyone would actually enjoy eating tough meat.My mom ordered the lamb chops which were excellent (tender and flavorful); as were the Chilean sea bass my aunt had ordered.  We ordered the asparagus and string beans as sides for the table.  Both were nicely cooked.  Service was very good as well, but overall I was disappointed the food didn't live up to the hype.",0,0,0,gwen L.,"New York, NY",3,137,0

Again, cooked exactly to our tastes (medium-well and medium-rare, respectively).Sides: Potato au gratin, and grilled asparagus. The potatoes were hands down the best I've had, and we couldn't have asked for more perfectly crunchy and flavorful asparagus,Dessert: Coconut cream pie - it's even better than everyone says it is. Perfectly sweet but not overbearing, and that crust!!Last, but certainly not least, was our waiter Jon. He was present but not annoying, and even though it was the end of the night we were not rushed into making any decisions and we did not feel pressured to speed through our meal. He kept our beer cold and water glasses filled.I WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK. With or without an excuse!",0,0,0,Ro S.,"Elmont, NY",10,18,0
4.0,9/12/2013,"We came here on a Sunday evening with a large group of friends to celebrate my hubby's birthday and the food & service were both amazing! The decor is very nice with an old-school traditional steakhouse feel and the space was open, perfect for a large gathering. We ordered a number of different dishes and sides. My husband ordered the Porcini Rubbed Delmonico with 12-Year Aged Balsamic (signature steak, prepared with delicate porcini mushroom crust) and enjoyed it very much, while I ordered the Capital Grille Chopped Salad and requested it to be topped off with some grilled chicken. (I'm not a big steak fan, hence the salad.) Our group seemed to enjoy all of their meals and I, thoroughly enjoyed my salad .. the chicken was served warm and super tender and juicy!We shared a number of sides including the lobster mac & cheese (absolutely divine!), the roasted wild mushrooms, and the spinach. All were cooked to perfection.We were stuffed silly but couldn't resist ordering dessert ... The Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake was a bit dense and one-dimensional, while the Coconut Cream Pie offered a nice contrast in texture.

3.0,9/11/2013,"Dined here last Friday, pre-theatre, with my girlfriend and one of our friends. Being that we we seeing a show, we all ordered off the pre-theatre menu, which is a great deal for $39. It's pretty much equivalent to a Restaurant Week meal.You're given three or four choices per course and for our appetizers, we ended up ordering the Ceasar Salad and Clam Chowder. For our entrees, we had one filet, one Kona Crusted Dry-Aged Sirloin with Shallot Butter and one Double Cut set of three Lamb Rip Chops.Appetizers were very yummy all around. The clam chowder was hearty, but not overly thick and had a good amount of clams. The Ceasar Salad with fresh and well dressed.Moving on to the mains, I ordered my lamb chops medium rare and they arrived perfectly cooked, very juicy and very tasty. They did come resting on oil and vinegar, which I just brushed off.As for the filet, just note that on their online menu, it lists a 10 oz filet, but once you're in the restaurant, the menu lists an 8 oz filet. Anyways, the filet, also ordered medium rare, came perfectly cooked, but was otherwise underseasoned and somewhat bland. The same goes for the sirloin - perfectly cooked at medium rare, but maybe it was the Kona crusting? Something was off - it lacked the good and sizzling charred taste of a sirloin.In terms of the sides - mashed potates and creamed spinach, we had two orders of potatoes and one of spinach. Both were excellent. You could really taste the butter and the milk in the potatoes too.We all opted for the sorbet for dessert and chose mango and lemon as our flavors. For whatever reason, we were all served two scoops of mango and one of lemon. Both were yummy, but it would've been nice to have more lemon.Service was overall very friendly and professional, but after we arrived back home, there was a major gaffe. In addition to taking our leftover meat home, we'd also asked for the remained of the potatoes and spinach (there was a lot of each), as well as the remainder of the bread, since there was a lot and it'd otherwise just get thrown away. Upon looking at our food the next day, no bread was included and we barely got any potatoes or spinach.Sigh... almost makes the $39 per person for the theatre menu not worth it. In the end, disappointing.",0,1,0,John-Paul P.,"Madison, NJ",68,149,839
4.0,9/1/2013,"We came here a couple of times during our latest NYC visit because the hubster's father loves restaurants like this: steak, seafood, with classic sides, an extensive wine list, and a staff who will bend over backwards to make sure we have a great night.As the hubster's niece said, ""This place is like a scene out of 'Mad Men.'"" And yes, it's a classic chophouse that serves suits but they know how to cater to families/tourists who are visiting the Big Apple looking for the Big Apple experience.Steaks done perfectly medium rare and lobster all buttery and melty in your mouth. Even the breads are good! I also had the tuna tartare the second night as (believe it or not) I was meated out. The rice that came with the tuna, however, was mushy. Yes, I know you're not an Asian joint, but everyone should know how to cook rice! All the soups were luscious and tasty: the French Onion, the lobster bisque, and the clam chowda were all robust and could've been a meal on their own. And you have to get their cheesecake. It is AMAZE-BALLS! I even love the crust and I'm usually not a crust-girl at all; I only eat the insides of pies for example. Seriously, I'd come back just for that cheesecake which was a hit with our table of 8. And when we came back the second night, we got the private room in the back because Jay, our fabulous waiter the night before, was there and wanted us at his station again. They even brought out a HONKING piece of divine chocolate cake for a Birthday celebrant in our group. And they have decent prices for what they offer.

The ginger rice was decent.The best items were the sides.. we had the mashed potatoes (amazing), along with the spinach (really good), and the mushrooms (really good).We decided not to order desert, as it was taking too long.Overall, not a great dining experience.",1,0,1,Asish P.,"Jersey City, NJ",84,442,2562

He was so nice to us that I kept wondering if we knew him from somewhere (we didn't, it turns out there are just exceptionally great waiters out there--surprise!).I've also been here during non-restaurant week times and have always enjoyed the visit. The steaks are usually very good, although one time I asked for medium and it came out bleeding. They took it back right away and it came out much better the second time. I've also enjoyed the fish entrees here, and their mashed potatoes and lobster mac 'n cheese are both really, really yummy (I could do without their calorie counts on the menu, though).Overall, this is a pretty safe pick.

2.0,8/11/2013,"Saturday night for a pre-theater dinner. The bar was busy and noisy, but we were shown to a lovely table overlooking 52nd Street on a room with only a few tables. The service was prompt, and drinks were served quickly.We had a ""restaurant week"" menu that looked rather appealing, similar to the regular menu. I ordered clam chowder 1st course, and my wife ordered the Caesar salad. The soup was like warm, but I elected not to send it back. The salad had no anchovies. For the entrees, we ordered steak- sirloin and filet. Both were ordered rare. They came medium-well. We sent them both back, and received new ones, cooked properly, with sides of potatoes and creamed spinach. The steaks were mediocre in flavor, even with the ""sauce"" that was served on top. I do not believe that this was prime meat, because of the lack of flavor. The sides were mediocre- the potatoes had a gloppy texture.Dessert was again disappointing- my wife, who adores chocolate, wouldn't take more than a few bites of the chocolate dessert. I ordered the ""home-made"" ice cream- a scoop each of chocolate and vanilla. This ice cream was again mediocre in flavor. I have made better ice cream at home.The service and ambiance were the only good qualities of this restaurant experience.

4.0,8/3/2013,"I really wanted to give Capital Grille five stars as it is usually one of my favorites.  I have been to the branch at the Chrysler Building before, but this was my first time at the Time Life Building branch.  Was there for a Restaurant Week dinner.  They are also having their ""Generous Pour"" event in which they serve seven excellent 90-point California wines.  It is a great value for great wines and highly recommended, but for one problem to be discussed later.The place was very busy on Friday night and although we were about 15 minutes late, we had to wait about 25 minutes (and I do not think it was because they gave up our table).  I ordered the clam chowder, which was New England style and a well-stocked cup of clams. Excellent. Also, they have an excellent warm bread basket.Then had the Bone-In Kona Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin with Shallot Butter 14oz.  It came perfectly medium rare, but was not as perfect as the last time I had it. My wife had one too and she wanted it cooked more and the second cooking charred it a bit more which added to the excellent flavor, although I still prefer medium rare.We shared  Sam's Mashed Potatoes and some Fresh Creamed Spinach, both of which were excellent. The only problem was that the red wines that should have been served with my steak never came.  I had four beautiful empty glasses in front of me and by the time I got someone's attention I had finished most of my mouth-wateringly delicious steak. Our waiter was very busy that night, which seems to be a problem on some nights as I recall that happening before at another Capital Grille. Still without missing a beat, I was issued an immediate apology, told I would not be charged for it and offered some red wine anyway.  Excellent response. For dessert we ordered the Classic Créme Brulée and the Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake.  We were then told that they were out of the Créme Brulée and could have any other item on the menu.  Another excellent touch.  We went for the Chocolate Hazelnut cake, which was huge and delicious.  Still nothing much tops their Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake, which is one of the best examples of such cake around.  Very dense and full of espresso flavor.Not only that, but the atmosphere is lovely.  Definitely can take a date here for a great meal.Although not a perfect night, it definitely came close and even if the service was not perfect, it was extremely friendly and gracious.

The service here was top notch. We received our own private room with round table and received constant attention from the waitress.The steak I ordered was pretty good but not amazing. The other food we ordered was good but not memorable. However the highlight of the night was the dessert. They brought us 6 or 7 desserts to pass without even requesting it.

He explained the menu to us in detail, and was very helpful and knowledgeable.My boyfriend and I shared the oysters, which were great, and the lobster bisque, which was quite good. Our dinner, however, was amazing. I ordered the filet mignon with onions and mushrooms. Despite not being much of a steak person, I must say that this was probably one of the best dishes I have ever had at a restaurant. My boyfriend had the Delmonico and said the same. We also ordered the sauteed spinach, which was delicious, but what we really loved was the lobster mac and cheese. I wish I could eat that every day!For dessert, we shared the berries with cream and enjoyed two great cups of coffee each... and at the end of the meal, they gave us each a chocolate truffle, which was rich and gooey and amazing.We had one drink each, two appetizers, two entrees, two sides, one dessert and coffee -- and the bill came to about 200.

We were here for restaurant week and so we got lucky with the prices. We were seated upstairs away from everyone below. I'm assuming due to our group size? Either way it was nice and private. I ordered the salmon dish while everyone else ordered steak. They provided two options. You can either get the filet mignon or another cut that was bigger. Both were ordered at the table and since we were all among friends we pretty much tried each other's dish. They did not offer any vegetarian dishes on the menu for restaurant week and so one of our friends had to order pasta. I guess they don't accommodate vegetarians or vegans at this restaurant. Shame. You get quit a few selections for your sides. We all decided to share and since it was a pretty big group there were double even triple orders of certain things. We ordered the mashed potatoes, sauteed spinach, creamed spinach and creamed corn I believe. Not sure on the last one. For dessert we had quite a few options. I ordered the creme brulee while everyone else ordered the flourless chocolate espresso cake and icecream that they make there in house. pretty much everyone was stuffed after the meal so of course who do they pass their desserts on to?

The chicken breast confit was also incredible - the meat was so soft and flavorful and the gravy was light and accented the meat just perfectly. The salads are fresh and tasty. The french onion soup was less than spectacular. And the sides, as expected are so good (potatos = so insanely creamy).Super pricey though!",0,0,0,Stephanie M.,"San Francisco, CA",5,759,93
4.0,10/3/2012,"The highlight of our meal was definitely the service. Our waiter was attentive, personable and timely. He also went on the hunt for a very particular bottle of wine, which I appreciated. We came here later on on a weeknight. Despite a few corporate dinners winding down, the restaurant was fairly empty, which surprised me.As expected, the food was very good. I was slightly disappointed in my entree, though I should have known to just go with the meat at a steakhouse. My main dish, the lobster & crab stuffed shrimp, came in a tomato sauce that wasn't particularly in my taste favor, though something about the flavors as a whole wasn't quite working. Caesar salad was classic. I did have the chance to try the steak (the Kona rub).. now that was delicious.

Holler Back!  Awesome selection of wines from all over the world.  Even offer Mag size bottles for large tables.  The other scary thing is all the calories on the menu. Really makes you think twice and then just not care when you realize your steak is 1000 calories!! yikes To start: Prosciutto Wrapped Mozzarella: this was ok, not fantastic. They pan fried it, so it took away from the crispness you usually haveFresh Mozzarella, Tomato, Basil Salad w/12 yr aged balsamic: this was fantastic, the balsamic was super tasty and the dish was fabulous Oysters: Nice, meaty oysters, very goodMain: I had the 'Chef's Suggestions': Tenderloin w/Lobster: This dish was very good, but the presentation of the steak was bazaar, they chopped it into two cubes instead of one piece of meat, this left the meat over cooked on one half and perfect on the other cube. The lobster was awesome. ** Lobster: this was a huge platter of lobster, but the took the hard part out of it for you (it lay on-top of the shell) ** Swordfish: Nice size cut of fish, seasoned well ** Veggie Pasta: I think its a crime not to order meat at a steak house, but we had a vegetarian, the pasta was HUGE in portion, looked good, but not as good as the steak!! Sides: Green Beans: nice flavor, fresh tasting Portabella, Shitake, and oyster mushrooms: Fantastic!! Great mix, perfectly marinated Sauteed Spinach: trying to be somewhat healthy, this was not a favorite of the table, seemed soggy Parmesan Truffle fries: addictive!! Asparagus: Very nice, large pieces Wines: We had two nice bottles, both from Cali both reasonably priced $~55-85",4,1,0,Elizabeth J.,"San Francisco, CA",596,659,801

2.0,9/5/2012,"We arrived early for our reservation, and while it was no problem because the place was empty, the maitre d' glowered at us.The decor in this restaurant is bizarre. There are stuffed deer heads mounted on the wall right next to big, museum-style oil paintings of celebrities like Groucho Marx. More importantly, the food was uneven, and fell short of expectations overall.The warm spinach salad was overdressed, and the bacon was fossilized. The carpaccio with arugula and wasabi vinaigrette was much better, albeit a little salty.My wife and I both ordered filet mignon, hers with a coffee dry rub and shallot butter, and mine a la Oscar (crabmeat, asparagus, and bernaise sauce). Although we both requested medium-rare, hers came out perfect, but mine was grey and dried-out, with barely any pink left in the center. I am wary of sending food back, because I have worked in restaurant kitchens, if you know what I mean, so I ate it, but did not enjoy it.Our sides were sautéed mixed mushrooms which were cooked well, but devoid of seasoning (I had to douse it with the salt and pepper shakers), and parmesan-truffle fries, which were good, although I really didn't detect any truffle flavor. Are you supposed to?I also had the coconut cream pie. The thick shortbread crust looked properly baked, but tasted gummy and raw, and the coconut cream was a gooey custard. Coconut cream pie should be light and airy, and this was just the opposite, dense and leaden, and not worth the calories.The server was very polite. He presented me with his personal business card along with the check, and insisted that I take it. Not sure if he was looking for another job, or if he expected me to ask for him by name when I come back, but, considering the fact  that I spent over $200 for an unsatisfying meal, I won't be returning.",3,1,1,Michael K.,"Westfield, NJ",36,506,351

My mom ordered the filet mignon cooked medium. It was juicy and tender- cooked perfectly. It was a good size too, I think it was 10oz. I got the special which featured waygu beef. This one had a lot more flavor than your typical steak. I got mine cooked at medium as well. Nice and pink in the center. It was so tender and flavorful. Delicious!

5.0,8/13/2012,"For a Restaurant Week dinner, I was so impressed by what Capital Grille had to offer! I normally don't participate in RW because portions are smaller and the quality is never as good as ordering from the regular menu, but the food was delicious and the portions were great. I had the clam chowder, bone in kona and the creme brulee for dessert and everything was delicious. Good portions of clams in the soup and there wasn't an overload of potatoes. The steak was ridiculously amazing. It was cooked exactly the way I ordered it and I couldn't have eaten it any faster. I'm normally not a fan of sauce on my steak, but it was a perfect combination and really added to the overall steak. The creme brulee was so good and rounded out the meal perfectly. The service was great, but I really didn't expect anythign less out of the service. They did hand us our bill right away, but we ignored it and finished our wine and had a few minutes of conversation. I will say the quality and service does not change from location to location. The Kansas City location was great and so was this one. I will gladly come back to Capital Grille again, both for RW and for regular dining.

4.0,8/13/2012,"I had an awesome time with my girlfriends here as we did the Generous Pour wine tasting event. For an additional $25 per person at dinner, you get to try 9 different types of wine: rose, white, red and dessert wine. If there's a particular wine you really like, you can ask them to keep pouring more for you. (dangerous!) I enjoyed the rose and dessert wine the most. But after 4 hrs of drinking, my friends and I were pretty much done for the night. Nonetheless, the dinner itself was pretty good. For appetizers, we ordered Lobster Mac n Cheese, Calamari and Fries. The lobster mac was good but wasn't great in my opinion. I don't know but I think prefer just regular mac n cheese. The calamari had a little kick to it but was very flavorful. I couldn't stop nibbling on the fries because they were crispy and great on its own without the ketchup. It's a nice source for carbing it up while drinking. For entrée, I ordered the Pan Seared Salmon, which was delicious. I personally love salmon and try to get it whenever I go out for dinner since I rarely make it at home. But the way they make it here is impeccable. Flaky on the inside and crispy on the outside.  Definitely worth the money if you like seafood. The décor is also very classy.

We did not like the mashed potatoes and creamed spinach as they were very ""heavy""' meaning too thick and not very creamy. I had a French onion soup which for 10 dollars was very small, not hot and had too much cheese.

Do I feel like I'm being influenced as an elite member? I don't think so (never was the possibility of my updating my review on Yelp mentioned), also, my prior review was not based on anything more than a promise of gift cards (and definitely not an amount). I stand by my previous reviews, but I will also say that my lunch here today was without flaw. I'd also like to think that anyone who had experienced the same type of food/service problems would get the same treatment, regardless of if they Yelped.

The replacement steak was not rested, and when I cut into it, it bled out all over my plate, leaving me with a pool of juice and a feverish struggle to finish before it got dry. The steak also had a bit of inedible fat on it, but it also did have some nice melty yummy fat too. It tasted good, but I had to add salt and pepper because they rushed my replacement and didn't season it properly. I tasted the filet as well, since my coworker ordered the price fix for ladies (FYI he is not a she), which came with an 8oz filet (no bigger than a good burger). It was perfectly cooked and juicy. So rather than the minus 5 that this place would have gotten for the incredible steak mishap, I added a point back for the filet. Keep in mind that mishap threw off the entire flow of the meal. My coworker had to start eating otherwise his steak would have gotten cold, and I was sitting there poking at the sides while waiting for my unrested, unseasoned $45 steak.

5.0,4/15/2012,"Long time ago when I just came to NYC with few pennys in my pocket and million dollar dreams  ( sounds so original isn't it, lol)  I used to pass by Capital Grille on my way to work and think how amazing it would be to have a dinner in here.    Years passed since then and one day I remembered about that small crush that I nursed toward CG.    However , after countless indulging food sessions in other restaurants I was afraid that my overly desyntesized sense wont be able to appriciate the place to the fullest.    I was , wait for it..... I was  wrong.I booked a table for lunch and when we arrived place was almost packed with corporate crowd in suits and ties. Mostly men and all eyes were on us cuz apparently girls do not eat meat or can't afford it since me and my friends were the one of the few female customers. Oh well, the world is my runway so i have been my gracious self as always and didnt mind. Food is delicious. As a meat lover I grade the steak and burgers as excellent. Juicy and moist it melts in your mouth. and of course, meat is not soaked in gallons of sauce to make it tasty.   If its fresh and high quality a good chef wont try to hide it under various sauces. Even clam chowder that i dont usually eat since there is no meat in it was delicious. Service was superb. Hosts are very accomodating.The whole service itself wasnt stiff and overly professional as I thought its might be.

5.0,4/9/2012,"Capital Grille is an outstanding restaurant to bring your friends and family for birthdays and celebrations! Having eaten at other Michelin rated restaurants in previous days (ie SFs Gary Danko, Murrays Circle), I can definitively say that Capital Grille is the best restaurant to celebrate your birthday in.  The service is outstanding, and you truly feel special. I highly recommend it as a memorable experience, especially for groups of 7-12.  While most restaurants barely give a birthday scoop of ice cream, Capital Grille went above and beyond to make birthdays unique. First, when the eight of us arrived to celebrate my birthday, we were delighted that the Capital Grille had reserved a private room for us complete with a bit of confetti and a birthday card. Then, the food was beyond excellent.  We had a variety of apps, side dishes, and eight different entrees (6 steak, 1 fish, 1 lamb), and they all were amazingly flavorful.  Originally, we thought of going to a seafood restaurant since I prefer shellfish over steak, but changed it to Capital Grille since, as you can see the yelp reviews are consistently excellent.  Even thought I am not a huge steak person, I was blown away by Capital Grille's quality. Then Steven, our waiter, gave me (the birthday girl) a complimentary tasting of both champagne, and a separate drink.  To top it off, he not only delivered a birthday slice of cake, but also took his own digital pic, PRINTED IT OUT, and FRAMED IT in a real 4x6 silver picture frame!  In fact, the manager came over at the end to wish me Happy Birthday and to make sure our party felt like we had great service.  We all left really impressed.  I highly recommend Capital Grille if you want to make someone feel special on their birthday and want consistently outstanding food.",0,0,0,Lil I.,"Alameda, CA",6,23,2

(I have small hands.)  If I had to guess, my steak was 4 ounces in total, and the lobster tail, without exagerration was the size of my index finger.  The dishes do not come with any potatoes, no salad, no asparagus - no complementary side dish at all.  The plate did not arrive hot - just room temp to cool.  My boyfriend's sirloin did come with a little bit more size to it, perhaps two of my small palm sizes together.  Again, no complementary sides come with it.  He enjoyed his sirloin, although I have had better - try Del Frisco's or Harry's.  Same goes for my miniature lobster tail, which was on the salty side.  It must have been a baby lobster, since that certainly was not a full tail.  I've had bigger tails at Red Lobster the two times I've been there, and that's not saying much.   We finished our meals not really satisfied and felt ripped off.   If you have a lot of disposable income, the ambiance and service are nice, but I won't be coming back.",0,0,0,D R.,"Cranford, NJ",1,149,24

Now for the food.Appetizer: Ordered the Field Greens, Spring Vetables with Shallot Champagne Vinaigrette. Prior to dinner, I read reviews on how fantastic this salad was and was expecting something fresh. However, what came out on the plate looked like something that came straight out of one of those instant salad bags purchased from a supermarket for a whopping 2 for $5.00. Entree: I had the 8 oz. Filet Mignon with the lobster tail $10 supplement. Like other reviewers said, my steak came out slightly charred.When I cut through the middle, I could easily tell that it was overcooked, not to the point that it was inedible, thankfully because I was starving, but I had much higher expectations for a place like Capital Grille. On the positive side, the lobster tail was NOT overcooked. I might have mourned if it was because I am a HUGE lobster fan! loveLoveLOVE LOBSTER!! For accompaniments, the creamed spinach was so-so and the mashed potatoes, as my co-worker put it, tasted like ""lots of cream and lots of fat.""Dessert:Yet another disappointment in my meal. I ordered the Crème Brulée. The dish came out cold and breaking into the top layer was similar to using a jackhammer to break into concrete...

With heavy hearts, and parched gullets, we checked our coats and loomed about the lobby while waiting for a table. I'm +1ing Clint H's comment about food coming out quickly. It definitely felt as if Capital Grille's kitchen had Restaurant Week items prepared in advance. Our meals came quickly, which was nice, but none of the main or side dishes felt particularly warm. I can understand a salad not being warm, but an 8 oz fillet shouldn't be cold. Perhaps we should have gone in the same night as Lauren L., my table did not feel that the meats were particularly impressive. One person had a hard time finishing the 14 oz bone-in dry-aged sirloin as it was riddled with fat and too chewy for her taste. Even though we weren't able to snag a drink before eating, we were able to take advantage of the Restaurant Week drink specials - the most inexpensive wine was $8 (both red & white varieties are offered).

3.0,1/23/2012,"Really Clint, 3 stars? Yes REALLY!Maybe closer to like 3.5 because the food was quite good, but there were a couple things i wasn't a big fan of. First of all, the service was, meh. I had dinner reservations at 845pm and for some reason this place was packed around then with people trying to eat dinner on Friday night. I guess that's not very late for Friday night dinner? Also it is Restaurant Week after all. Anyways they finally sit me down after 9pm (really?) and get me my menus. The menus here are GIGANTIC! It's so weird. They take up half of the table, seriously. The best part is that all the food is on the front part, the inside 2 pages are all wines and champagnes! Pretty extensive list though, I must say.For whatever reason we waited a pretty long time for the waiter to come take out orders. it was very strange. I guess they were REALLY busy. I got the clam chowder which was quite good. A relatively small portion but it's really rich stuff, so you don't need much, especially since I was going to wash it down with some Filet Mignon anyways.When my Filet came out, it seemed a bit on the charred side, but I didn't really mind, i did ask for it medium well (it was closer to well though). However my date ordered hers medium rare, and it came out pretty close to as charred. The other thing about the food too, was that they came out VERY quickly. Almost within a minute of us ordering the food! Makes you think they had it just sitting back there waiting for the Restaurant Week people to come in and order it. Even if that was the case, my steak was amazing! Kinda hard to mess up Filet Mignon. They came out with creemed spinach and mashed potatos, which were also good.Apparently they were out of Creme Brule, so we had to get the chocolate mousse (which i surely didn't get because I'm not a chocolate fan) and the icecream. Icecream was good, because it's also relatively hard to mess up. I guess the chocolate mousse was alright, from what I hear.Here's the other thing, the waiter comes by to drop off the check, so I put my card it and wait. He comes by to pick it up, he then brings it back and is like have a nice night blah blah. Fair enough. I take my receipt, sign it, take my own personal receipt and before I can even put it in my pocket he comes by and grabs it! Umm. BAD FORM bro. You're supposed to wait for the people to get up and leave before you take a check. Just seemed like he was ready for us to leave, which doesn't make any sense because he took forever to come serve us anyways!

We decided to get the pre set menu (I forgot the exact term but it comes with the main menu but as a smaller piece of paper) and it was 39 dollars a person for appetizer (I had clam chowder my friend salad), entree (I had Fillet Minion and my friend had Lamb) and desert (I had vanilla ice cream which was devine lol I'm starting to think I have a ice cream problem). The price compared to amount of food was not bad for anywhere and on top of that the quality of the food was great! I also should mention however, things off this pre menu were on the pricier side.Now on to the service! Thank heavens I'm a pre-pre planner and made reservation here (and everything else when I went out) because there were people waiting when we got there and they didn't seem to happy (maybe had to wait for a bit?). So I would most definitely suggest making reservations. The server we had was absolutely awesome. She was on top of our every needs (our drink and when we are ready for our next course) without giving us any feelings of her bothering us. On top of that, my friend and I, being us, lost total track of time and had to dash out out waitress was attentive and quick so we can make our Broadway show.After all those compliments why didn't I give this place five stars? Well, at the end of the day our food came out to roughly 80 dollars which was expected and not a big deal. However, the total came out to a whopping 120+ dollars before tip. After quick calculating I realized that the drinks we had weren't included in initial calculations. My friend had one wine and I had two Guinness. So that's like 13 dollars a drink. Club prices baby!  My wallet implored me to at least subtract one star and I had to go with it because it didn't have Guinness on tap as well =/ Overall great restraunt if you want to have a fancy dinner (especially before Broadway show since it's like 3 min. away.)

Here they do a really good job.We were quite a big group and seated close to the kitchen. First I thought this might be disturbing and noisy but it wasn't at all. The service was impeccable and I was really impressed. I had my first T-bone steak I hadn't cooked my self so I was very curious how it will be. The waiter was patient and asked what kind of meat you prefer and then made his recommendations. I was undecided whether to take the Delmonico or the T-bone because I didn't want a piece of meat that was too lean. Eventually I went for the T-bone steak and I have to say I like the fillet side of it much more than the other side. I love to add pepper on almost everything I eat but this was just perfectly seasoned. When I look on an other plate next to me I saw the Delmonico. It was perfectly marbled and when I got to try it I knew I wanna come here again and have the Delmonico. It is so good! And already know what I want to have on the side. The have fries with truffles and I tell you I will go there and order a whole bathtub of them to take them home and sit in it. They are exceptionally delicious! Someone ordered the lobster bisque. I wanted to order it as well but thought a creamy soup before a steak or something might be too much. Yet the bowl of soup was quite small. Personally, I appreciate small starters a lot and so you know what I will order as a starter when I come here again: lobster bisque. It seemed to be outstanding.

4.0,12/9/2011,"I came for a lunch and started with a Wagyu beef carpaccio with a giant bed of arugula on top. It was over dressed with a mustard hotness. The beautifully red beef was unfortunately lost among the rest of the dish.The beef was not lost in the luncheon cheeseburger. With a big, juicy patty with beefy meat flavors, the best part of the burger was the beef which I would hope would happen at a steakhouse. The burger was cooked to the correct rare doneness and created a wonderfully sloppy, juicy, napkin-required sandwich. The big, oily brioche bun added to the delicious mess.The rest of the burger could be improved.  The single thin slice of melted cheese was hard to taste. The standard 24-hour diner fixings like pickle slices (probably from a jar), slice of white onion (bit too much), and a tomato slice (too small for the burger diameter) gave the burger an everyday flavor profile. Given the many high end burgers at other restaurants, they needed to do something more special than provide good meat and a good bun - like marinate the tomato, make in-house pickles, or use bold cheeses.The $18 burger came with truffle fries, but they tasted just like regular fries. They were the standard bistro fry cut and had a thick fry coating. Aggressively seasoned, additional condiments were not needed. A dining companion ordered a boring sautéed spinach which had garlic chunks.For dipping the fries or smearing on the burger, there were three condiments - aioli that was about to separate, generic yellow mustard, and plain old catsup.For dessert, we shared the cheesecake which was lighter than most, but the crust was soggy. For drinks, I had an above average Manhattan from the bar and an Inniskillen 2006 Vidal dessert wine for $24 which paired well with the cheesecake.Service was a little slow and uneven.",1,0,0,Brian U.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1798,109

4.0,10/26/2011,"When American Express sends you a $50 gift certificate for Capital Grill and tells you it expires by the end of October, you go and make a dinner reservation before said expiration date. As such, my girlfriend and I ended up having dinner here last weekend. The restaurant was kind enough to hold a reservation even though I was running late (thank you, E train running local back from Queens), and we got seated at a spacious table for 4 - props for not cramming us into a tight 2-seater like some other restaurants would. The interior is very upscale, but I didn't feel terribly out of place wearing what would probably pass for above-average casual for most people. Service was solid, if relatively unspectacular, throughout.As for the food - every aspect was very quality. The lobster & crab cake was interesting; I was a big fan of the succulent crab meat, but the lobster threw off the texture a bit...didn't end up being a huge fan, but the two medium-sized cakes were okay. We split the dry-aged sirloin and the filet; both were accompanied by the same light gravy (I don't think it was au jus, but my taste buds aren't that good) that helped to accentuate the meaty flavor. My only complaint is that the 'medium rare' on the filet sure had what looked like rare portions in the middle - so if you don't want something that looks undercooked, make sure to check out the middle of your steak. Nevertheless - it was still delicious. The sauteed spinach was lightly flavored - just right - but some of the excess oil from the bottom of the plate made it a bit soggy. As for the mashed potatoes - absolutely delicious, but they use the stuff (namely, sour cream) that gives it a much smoother and buttery/fattier taste than your ordinary hand-mashed potatoes would. Dessert was the flourless chocolate espresso cake, which was very well-done. Not the best flourless cake I've had the chance to enjoy, but still very hearty.There's a prix fixe menu for the pre-theater crowd that's pretty reasonable, but if you're looking for a reasonably upscale steakhouse in Midtown, Capital Grille is a quieter, classier alternative to Del Frisco's a block away. The appetizers are also pretty strong all around.",0,0,1,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",371,1653,169

3.0,10/16/2011,"My recent experience at Capital Grille was fine.  Nothing truly spectacular or awful, but just okay.  Our server was friendly, but very slow.  We had to wait a little while for our server to come to our table initially, but we had water and were still working on our drinks from the bar, so no big deal.  After that, however, the waits got longer and longer.  It took forever for our first course to come out and it was clear from the lukewarm temperature of my lobster bisque that it had been sitting in the kitchen for a while (my boyfriend's wedge salad was good, but still just a pretty standard wedge salad).After we finished our appetizers, it then took forever for us to get out main course.  Our steaks were absolutely delicious and perfectly cooked - I had the filet mignon, my boyfriend had the steak au poivre - but the sides were disappointing.  The sauteed spinach was highly average and I wasn't a fan of the au gratin potatoes (wish we had gone with the mashed potatoes instead).After another wait, we ordered dessert.  When it finally came, I was extremely happy with the flourless chocolate espresso cake.  The cake was wonderfully chocolatey and the raspberry sauce and whipped cream were the perfect compliment.Overall, the experience was fine, but with so many amazing restaurants in the city, I doubt I'll be rushing back to Capital Grille anytime soon.",1,0,0,Annette M.,"New York, NY",228,263,0

4.0,8/24/2011,"My family and I went to Capital Grille for dinner before a show.  We selected this particular location because of their pre-show prix fixe menu, which was supposed to include 3 courses (with 3 selections each) for $39.  When we were seated, we were initially handed just the regular dinner menu.  Then, when I asked for the pre-show menu, turns out, they had extended their Restaurant Week menu, so instead of a $39 prix fixe, it was $35!  Ok, so woop-dee-doo for a $4 difference; however, the Restaurant Week menu was actually a bit larger than the Pre-Show Menu.  There were 5 entrees and 5 desserts to select from, instead of 3.So around the table, we all ordered a variety of the appetizers, entrees and desserts.  Everyone was satisfied with their selections, and not only that, the portions were VERY generous.  Besides the fact that we had a very early dinner, most of us could barely even finish half of our entree.  And for the best part...dessert...everything that we selected was great!  Creme brulee, flourless chocolate cake, pina colada sorbet and my favorite, homemade strawberry ice cream.  Our waiter, an ALIVE Ed Sullivan, had recommended the strawberry over any other flavor, and it was just divine!I also want to mention the fact that one of the members on our party was on a strict cleanse diet at the time of our visit.  Our waiter was so accommodating to her and even found substitutions for each course, in order to allow to her participate in the prix fixe with us.To top off the night, we even received a souvenir photo (a digital photo taken by our waiter and printed on the spot) in a Capital Grille folder.  It wasn't something necessary, but it was a fun thing to end the night with.All in all, we had a great experience.  If it weren't for the prix fixe menu, we definitely wouldn't have ordered as much food as we did; however, for the value, you are probably better off going that route.",0,0,0,Audrey C.,"Redwood Shores, Redwood City, CA",464,526,1427

As for the entree, salmon and lamb steak came out literally twice as big as the regular portion in other restaurant. I didn't try the salmon thus can't tell the taste, but enjoyed my juicy perfectly cooked meat to my heart content...! The dessert chocolate cake was also relatively large and simply delicious. The service here is typical of steak house standard(say, no-smiley friendly service, but attentive). Over all, I'm satisfied with the experience here (especially with the restaurant week deal).

4.0,8/19/2011,"I was there yesterday with my sister and my friend to try out the restaurant week menu, we all love their food, environment and the location.  I had Clam Chowder for appetizer, 8oz Filet Mignon (medium) maybe i can go for the medium/rare next time, and round it up with Creme Brulee for dessert. Clam Chowder wasn't salty since most places i've been to hv the clam chowder a little salty, theirs was good.  The Filet Mignon was very tender. the sauce on the side help to make it taste even better, the sauce had little wine in it, therefore, maybe not for kids or teenager. And then the creme brulee was a little too sweet for me, but because it had the fresh strawberry, blueberries, raspberries on top, it balance the sweetness with the sourness from the fruits.  About my sister's choices, she had Cesar salad, Filet Mignon, and Pina Colada Sorbet for dessert.  I couldn't try the sorbet because it was already gone to my sister's stomach by the time i asked.  And my friend had the Sirloin steak for main course.

I ordered shrimp stuffed with crab and lobster. It was good but came with some sauce in the middle that didn't really go with the meal at all. I don't think I need to tell you this, but definitely go with the steak here. Being the freeloader that I am, I tried enough of my friend's steak to know that it's scrumptious. Their sides are out of this world. And they're large enough to feed about 2-4 people. Depends on how hungry said people are. The Lobster mac and cheese is amazing. I seriously had to control myself from eating the whole plate. I was definitely the ""does anyone mind if I finish this"" guy at the dinner. The scalloped potatoes were really good as well. We also had appetizers. Their calamari is delish, just very spicy. But if you can handle the spice, definitely get it. The ambiance at this place is very upscale and classy.

While the food was good, I was disappointed with my Sirloin and my Butter Poached Lobster.  The pieces were small, and even though I asked for medium doneness on my steak, one pieces was medium, and the other was much closer to well done.  My husband enjoyed his Rib Eye, but said that he had enjoyed other steaks more.

1.0,2/10/2011,"I had dinner here on a Saturday evening a couple of weeks ago and although some of the food was good, the service was poor and the chef disputed the temperature of my steak. The bar is beautiful and I waited there for a few minutes for my party with a friendly and efficient bartender. The dining room is nicely appointed and the booth that we had was comfortable for four of us. 3 of us had the spinach salad appetizer, which was excellent. and two of us ordered the special sliced steak. I ordered mine rare and the other person ordered medium-well. When the server brought the plates they didn't ask who had ordered which temperature but then when we compared the two they seemed the same - medium-well... I told the waiter that my steak was at the wrong temperature and he brought it back to the kitchen. I could see the chef arguing with him from where I was sitting and then, to my amazement, the chef returned with my steak to tell me that the chef wanted me to look at the very center of the steak to see it was rare. As this was a sliced steak I told him to show the chef the two end pieces that were well done and the next pieces in which were medium well and to let him know that the 2 bites of rare meat in the center was not going to be enough for me. Eventually the waiter came back with a new steak for me, which was properly cooked. At this point my dining companions were finished their meals and the sides were cold. The side dishes were not replenished or freshened up - I was left with my steak and cold fries while the rest of the table watched me eat it. At that point I had mostly lost interest and ended up taking the steak home. I understand that getting the temperature just right for every diner is challenging but I have never seen a steak being sent back with a scolding from the chef before. I don't intend to do it again either. The experience has left me with a very bad taste in my mouth and I will not be returning to the Capital Grille.",1,0,0,Paul M.,"New York, NY",3,59,0
3.0,2/7/2011,"Went here for date-night. We enjoyed ourselves, but compared to some of the other steakhouses out there, our meal and evening fell slightly short.Salads: we ordered the wedge salad (with blue cheese dressing, tomatoes, and bacon) and ceaser salad. My BF was really excited about the wedge salad, particularly that the tomatoes were sliced and not chopped into small pieces, so it was easy for him to keep it separate (he isn't much of a tomato fan). Dressing was delicious, creamy but with huge chunks of fresh blue cheese. And the ceaser salad was just as good, leafy with the right amount of dressing, fresh cheese, and homemade croutons.Steak: we ordered the delmonico (house recommended) steak, it's a 24 oz ribeye, plenty for the two of us. Cooked to perfection (medium rare), and it was delicious. No complaints.Sides: here's the part that fell short. We ordered the potatoes au gratin and creamed spinach. The potatoes were creamy but not cheesy - isn't the fun of au gratin potatoes to be super creamy AND cheesy? The creamed spinach was also creamy, but it didn't seem like the spinach was cooked WITH the cream. When you tasted it, it felt that the cream separated from the spinach a bit too quickly and you ended up with spinach in your mouth with no cream. Something about it wasn't right, though the flavor was good. Ambiance was fine, not dissimilar from other steakhouses. This particular location is definitely catered to business people with expense accounts, so going on a Saturday night, it was practically empty. We wanted to enjoy a leisurely dinner, and because the restaurant seemed empty, we didn't feel any need to rush through our meal. It was slightly annoying, however, that the waiter (and servers) came by periodically to ask if they could take away our food. Maybe they were bored and needed something to do? I think we had to say ""we are still eating"" about 10 times. Overall, I'd say good but not great.",1,0,0,Wendy L.,"New York, NY",13,106,4

Ordered bottle of wine, 15 minutes later found out ""it was sold out months ago."" Asked for a salad w/o eggs due to allergies, ""no problem"", still comes with eggs, but even before we caught it we had to switch the pates because they were placed on the opposite side of the person ordering.Ordered another bottle of wine, came very quickly, wine must be stored upside down (understandable), but check for the sediment before delivery, I don't feel like sipping a $100 bottle of wine and be weary of particles floating in my glass. Made a note to our waiter, he just laughed it off, didn't really offer a decanter.Ordered two main dishes, lamb chops and a steak, both weren't cooked to order. Steak came rare and cold. I understand the temperature for rare however medium (as ordered) should not be immediately cold, sent it back to ""throw it back on the grill."" Effective but I am not sure if that jeopardizes the quality of the meat. Overcooked lamb chop was OK, that was quite delicious but fatty, once again, OK with that.

The sides are amazing (calorie count be damned!), and the lobster bisque is nearly equal parts lobster and bisque. The ambiance is upscale, but the dress is surprisingly casual -- a touch more casual than even the corporate world's notorious Casual Friday casual. There were as many jeans and sneakers (well kept, of course) as business suits, and no one seemed to look twice at anyone else's attire. Most hearteningly, the staff is extremely cheerful, alert, helpful and knowledgeable. For what could be a faahhhncy shmaaahnsy place, Capital Grille is refreshingly down-to-earth. Every customer seems to be treated with equal courtesy. I was so impressed with my friend's birthday repast (and he is an .. uh.. unusual dresser), that it quickly became my restaurant of choice for all birthdays. I've take my parents -- also not flashy dressers -- here for their birthdays for the past two years, and each time they have been delighted! Sure, it's a bit expensive, but as steakhouses go, it is quite reasonable. And with service like this, it's a bargain at twice the price.",2,2,1,Carol H.,"Brooklyn, NY",595,9,0

5.0,12/1/2010,I was in this past weekend visiting from Los Angeles. I was looking for a top-notch steak dinner. Amy was our server. She represents the epitamy of top-notch customer service. She was extremely informative on all of the meals on the menu as well as the specials for the evening. She even came by and offered small perks througout the evening. She is truly an example of  a proffessional and personable representative for a high class dining experience. Each time I come to New York.

4.0,12/1/2010,"Stopped by the Capital Grille for dinner last night on a whim. We couldn't have been more pleased with the food quality, service and atmosphere.We made a reservation last minute which was graciously accepted even though the place was packed. On top of it, we were given a gigantic booth which was comfortable and spacious. I don't know what it is about a big booth, but damned if it's not the best place to sit in any restaurant from McDonald's on up. The waiter was a gem; quick and attentive without being a nuisance (as the waiters in Del Frisco's have become). As for the atmosphere, it was lively without being uncomfortably loud as it can be in some steakhouses.I went with the 10 oz. filet mignon, medium rare, my girl got the rack of lamb. We also split the mashed potatoes. Everything was outstanding. My steak was top quality, cooked perfectly and seasoned well. My one minor complaint was that they plated the steak on a savory reduction which I thought was unnecessary considering how juicy the meat was. The lamb was very tasty, and the side was velvety smooth and delicious, primarily in part to a gaudy, though delicious, use of butter.I finished up the evening with a Courvoisier VSOP, and my girl opted for the 1100 calorie coconut cream pie, bless her. In the end, it was a great experience all around. It wasn't the best steak I ever had, but it was quite close. Highly recommended.",4,4,2,Jeff S.,"Bucks County, PA",592,1834,584

The filet was perfect, and the filet portion of the porterhouse was terrific. Unfortunately the strip side of the porterhouse as far too fatty for my tastes. I like porterhouse but this cut had more fat that a rib eye.5. For a side we ordered the potatoes au gratin which were delicious with fried onion crumbles on the top.

4.0,5/2/2010,"When I think of bar food, I picture little nibbles: peanuts, pretzels, maybe a cracker with cheese or two. I don't think of generous portions, or particularly delicious food, which is exactly what I got here earlier this week.My boyfriend and I decided to come here after long days at respective jobs. We started out with a drink - wine for him, mojito for me - and mused over the bar menu. The crowd was full of business men unwinding, and small groups of people at the bar and around the high-top tables lining the window (which is where we were.) Despite the vibrancy of the place, the acoustics never drowned our conversation out. We decided we'd share three things - how bad could that be? We'd probably need to stop at the corner deli to finish what we started. We were stopped dead in our tracks when we were presented with a monster-sized cheeseburger with truffle fries, a heaping plate of spicy, crisp calamari, and delicate but meaty lambchops. In many cases, large size connotes bad taste. The exact opposite here. The truffle fries were a crack-like umami circus, impossible to stop eating and too good to be relished with anything else. The burger had equally savory qualities, with tomatoes, raw onion, lettuce, and a pickle. Three little cups of ketchup, nose-busting mustard, and an aioli sauce surrounded it, and made the option open to either spread or dip. (I dip.) The calamari was my boyfriend's favorite. The calamari, especially the legs, were crispy and tender, and never chewy. Usually accompanied by some sort of red sauce elsewhere, these needed no other adornment than the red hot cherry peppers that made their way into every crack and crevice of the dish. The lamb chops had virtually no excess fat,  were easy to cut, moist, and juicy. Served medium, they were delightful. To help us make sure we ate as much as possible, we ordered one more drink each to make swallowing all the more easy. A guinness for him, and a ""Bohemian cocktail"" for me - a fresh and pretty drink with icy raspberries floating inside. It's tall, not too sweet, and tastes a little different from sip to sip - get it. Service was congenial and friendly - as if talking with friends - but with enough professionalism and quick reflexes to make the night go smoothly and without any trouble.

The pineapple and vodka mix and sit for several days as the wonder of infusion transpires. After several days of sitting, the result is ready to drink and poured into a martini glass.The danger of Stoli Doli is that any strong taste of alcohol is missing. It's like pineapple juice with a slight hint of the drink. Because of that one can easily consume three in 30 minutes and attempt to keep up that rate for several hours if need be.Our bringer of Stoli Doli was friendly, talkative and never made us wait for another round.While I did not eat in the dining room area, walking through revealed a recreation of classic old school NY decor.

Fries - wow another hit, truffle flavor was perfect - subtle yet ever present....  The meal started with an amuse-bouche of cream of asparagus soup - heavy in the white wine reduction it was tremendous and light.Then we were treated to champagne (gratis for the birthday).Then our apps - blue point oysters - divine and calamari - perfect, light and spicy - lightly breaded and fried with peppers.  We shared a wedge salad with thick, tasty chunks of bacon...yum!Then our main and sides - none of which we could finish (there were four of us - 2 apps, 1 shared salad, 3 sides, 4 mains and we couldn't finish!)Amy brought my a dessert plate with flourless chocolate plate with a raspberry sauce and a ricotta cheese cake with carmelized top (think creme bule with cheese cake) - unreal and perfect - even with us completely full.Along comes Amy and asks if we would like a picture taken.  Being my  birthday, we took up the offer and when she brought the check, she brought a 5x7 picture in a card stock frame - awesome!So in conclusion - Unreal service - truly spectacular - personal, professional and inviting - Food - fantasticAmbiance - classic, airy and tastefulAn ABSOLUTE must for streak lovers - and food lovers in general!!!!",0,0,0,Myron C.,"Eugene, OR",0,13,0
4.0,10/30/2009,"In my opinion, this beats Del Frisco's, and I've decided it's my go-to steakhouse for business lunches.  I've been to the one in D.C., but my lunch today was really awesome, and you know, sometimes being a chain restaurant doesn't hurt (although having to put the calories on the menu is a real mood killer).We ordered oysters and fried calamari to share, and I got the shrimp cocktail to myself.  The seafood was fresh and tasty, and the calamari was very tasty (albeit bit greasy though).For my entree I got the sirloin, medium rare, and it was exaclty what I'd hoped for.  A good piece of meat.  We shared sides, and everything I tasted was good.  Definitely try the truffled fries and lobster mac & cheese!  It's a heart-attack on a plate but it's rediculously tasty.  The fries were the best fries I've had in a long while.For desert, we shared a bunch.  The ice cream cookie sandwich was gigantic (like, enough for 3 people), and the mint ice cream was very fresh tasting.  Creme brulee, flourless chocolate cake, and chessecake were also very good.  The cheesecake was of the creamier variety.  The service was very attentive, and moved at a good pace.  They are definitely equipped to handle the business lunch crowd.  The only mishap was that it took forever for our coffees to come out, but I'll let them slide on this one.",1,0,0,Jordan S.,"Denver, CO",31,138,22
4.0,10/21/2009,"Holy smokes, this is a chain!?  I didn't know!  Came here for another business lunch.  A great experience, we all tried the special soup of the day, Lobster bisque.  This was some lobster bisque with giant chunks of lobster meat in it.  Perfectly seasoned, creamy, and delicious.  Then onto the main course, the SOTD - Open faced scallop BLT.  This should be a main stay on their menu.  It's perfect for lunch!  3 Giant pieces of diver scallops on top of 3 thick pieces of bacon, on top of fresh lettuce, and tomato, all served on a toasty piece of bread.  As a side we tried the Lobster Mac & Cheese.  It was ok, could've been better.  It was missing the gooey cheese and was a tad dry.  I took a bite of my colleagues flank steak NY cheese steak and it was awesome.  I'll be back to try their steaks.",0,0,0,Sandy C.,"Queens, NY",249,578,465
5.0,10/19/2009,"I feel rather silly giving a chain restaurant five stars.  However, despite the fact that The Capital Grille is a chain restaurant, it really serves up some delicious food.I've only been here once and it was because I was lured in with a $50 gift certificate from American Express, which, I must add, doesn't get you too far.  However, I have a feeling that my experience was pretty standard.We ordered the onion rings, lobster mac and cheese, steak au poivre and the porterhouse.  Additionally, we got martinis and a bottle of wine.  We topped it off with the dessert as well.  What can I say, it was an indulgent night and I probably need to run a marathon to burn off the amount of calories I consumed here that night.  So here's the run down of the meal:Vidalia Onion Rings:  The flavor was kind of meh.  Nothing really grabbed me about the flavor, but the onion rings were perfectly cooked.  You know what I hate about some onion rings?  When you bite into an onion ring and the onion skin doesn't quite cut through and then you end up taking out the entire onion ring and then you're left with the breaded outer shell.  This never happened to these onion rings.  They were wonderfully crispy, but not too crispy to the point where I felt like my mouth was getting cut up.Lobster Mac and Cheese:  This was so scrumptious.  The bread crumbs were buttery, the mac was not actually macaroni but campanelle and the lobster chunks were plentiful. If you're a vegetarian and are planning a visit to this place, order this.  If you're not a vegetarian, order this.The Steaks:  We ordered them rare and that's pretty much how they came out - there was a cool pinkish red in the center.  I think they could have been a bit more red, but that's okay.  They were juicy and delicious.  Now, here's some helpful information about their steaks if you're trying to figure out whether or not you should come here. 1.  They dry age their steaks in house for 3 weeks.  Jeffrey Steingarten says the optimal aging time is 6-7 weeks, but I'm under the impression that no steak house in New York City dry ages for that long.2.  They use a special broiler to cook their steaks.3.  They don't use any butter in the cooking process.I was honestly kind of nervous when the manager told me that they don't use any butter in the cooking process.  I'm used to my steaks having a rich, beefy, buttery flavor and clearly I wasn't going to be getting any butteriness with my steak here.  However, it totally works without butter.  My porterhouse was served with its natural au jus and I ended up asking for more.  Overall, the steaks had a great beefy flavor to them and the texture had the dry-aged texture to it.  Desserts - We actually took these to go, because we were meeting friends and after our meal we were too full to really eat much of them.  The couple of bites I had of flourless chocolate cake and cheesecake were pretty good though.All in all, we agreed - we'd definitely come back.  The Capital Grille isn't your standard chain restaurant.Oh, however, because it is a chain restaurant, yes, they do have calorie counts next to everything on the menu. EVERYTHING.  Not that seeing that a porterhouse steak has almost 1000 calories kept me from ordering it though.",2,2,3,Elissa S.,"Westchester County, NY",126,279,23
4.0,10/6/2009,"Stopped in here during search of a good midtown bar after work.  We weren't that hungry but the menu looked pretty tempting and the bartender was very convincing.We had the seafood platter appetizer, which usually comes with lobster, but since they were out - they gave us king crab.  It was really pretty, fresh, and satisfying.  It comes with 6 huge oysters, 6 huge shrimp, king crab, and a really spicy cocktail sauce.  After that, we had the sirloin steak with no rub, and it was cooked really well.Drinks were good, service was fast and friendly, would definitely go back.  PS, loved Gabe (bartender).Also, ask what the Stoli Doli is, and you might get one (or 2) for free!",0,0,0,Alice K.,"New York, NY",7,12,0

3.0,8/5/2009,"Flanked by both Del Frisco's fantastic vaulted ceiling steakhouse and Ted Turner's janky bison shop, Capital Grille tries to stand up as a true contender but doesn't quite make it there. An immaculate deep mahogany dining room paired with an extensive wine list, a Delmonico medium-rare steak to die for does not, at the end of the day, overcome the lackluster service, desiccant-like dryness of the fillet, and uninteresting and unmotivated sides. An experience that does not yet come together, and a pondering question as to why pay the premium and go to a chain restaurant that does not deliver on its standards.",1,0,0,J Z.,"New York, NY",44,89,8

The entire evening....Excellent Food, Friendly and attentive Service, Serious Wine list, and Plush Ambience was contiguous bliss! There were six of us with varying choices....everything was brawny joy! Appetizers: calamari with hot cherry peppers and cold seafood platter. Salads:  wedge salad and spinach salad with warm bacon dressing.  Entree: The Bone-In Kona crusted Dry aged Sirloin with Carmelized Shallot Butter; The porcini rubbed Delmonico dry aged Steak seasoned and broiled to create a delicate porcini mushroom coat, drizzled with 12 year aged balsamic; The filet mignon with wild mushrooms and cippolini onions were all sublime.  How do I know?  I had a bite of each! I think that the desserts were a bit overrun by the wine, but we shared several and all were wickedly yummy.Beside, great company.....what more can you ask for?",1,0,1,Terri V.,"Manhattan, NY",171,277,13
5.0,6/13/2009,"I am a first time yelper and I couldn't wait to add this review. We went to this location in the Time-Life building and my husband and I had a very memorable anniversary dinner.  When I made my reservation via their website, I asked for a great table in their restaurant explaining that it is our first time in New York and our anniversary celebration. Upon our arrival, 3 people greeted us saying ""Happy Anniversary""! When we got to our table on the second floor with a view of the entire first floor and the kitchen, our table had lots of votives, two roses and a Happy Anniversary card that was hand written.  Our waiter, Andy surprised us with a complimentary glass of champagne as well as an amuse bouche of figs with a delicate cream cheese from the chef.  I never had an amuse bouche, my taste buds were delighted.  Between my husband and I, we ordered:            1. Ceasar salad with anchovies             2. Fresh mozzarella, tomato and basil with 12-year aged balsamic             3. Dry Aged Steak Au Poivre with a Courvosier Cream Sauce            4. Sliced Filet Mignon with Cippolini Onions and Wild Mushrooms            5. Lobster Mac & Cheese side            6. A bottle of cabernetAll I can tell you is that the food is totally amazing, great-melt-in-your-mouth steak and the lobster mac and cheese will forever be my favorite.  The salads were both superb.  I ate all my mozzarella salad. that balsamic was the best. After dinner Andy, our waiter asked if we were interested in dessert, after all that food that I tried to finish (didn't want to waste any) we declined dessert.  Lo and behold, he comes with a complimentary handmade vanilla ice cream doused in Grand Marnier with fresh strawberries.  I thought I was full but that ice cream was heavenly.  The whole expereince was divine but the hospitality and generosity of the people there made our evening.  My husband and I couldn't stop talking about it.  This restaurant by far is the BEST place we have been to.  The salads were great. The 12 yr old balsamic on my salad was delish...I guess aging it makes a great difference.  My husbands steak was divine, it was so flavorful...I liked his better than mine.  I think the dry aging makes it much more flavorful and very tender.  My steak was also really good but it wasn't dry aged.  The lobster mac n cheese was so yummy!  It had big chunks of lobster claws on top of it and more meat inside.  If you are lucky enough to be offered an amuse bouche, take it.  The dessert we ha was so good, I almost licked the bottom of the dish.Special thanks to Andy, what a great waiter who made it special and even got our roses from the market before we came!  Also Jessica, she may be the maitre'd who came to greet us at our table and helped serve our lobster mac & cheese. And to all those who made our experience memorable, thank you!So if you're ever in New York, and looking for a great steak place...consider Capital Grille in the Time-Life building, they will make your night extra special.",2,0,0,Kris A.,"Fullerton, CA",443,187,438
5.0,6/9/2009,This place is great - as are most Capital Grilles. The service was great and knowledgable. We tried a few things. The steak was perfectly cooked. The lamb chops were juicy and again cooked perfectly. The lobster crab cakes were also delightful.

5.0,5/11/2009,"The newest Capital Grille location in NYC lives up to the same flavor full steak and extraordinary service as other locations fulfill, so any frequent C.G. guest can be assured this location has been trained well. My personal tip: when making a reservation for a table of 2 or 4, ask to be seated at the corner table on the mezzanine level. You'll have a great view of the entire restaurant and kitchen. Oh, and while both are great, I'd chose the Kona steak over the Delmonico anyday.",2,0,0,Evelyn M.,"New York, NY",23,65,10

Our waiter Ed Sullivan was knowledgeable and attentive, as was everyone else on this large staff.We started with the fried calamari with hot cherry peppers which as perfectly prepared.For dinner I chose the filet mignon, excellently cooked and tasted fantastic. My boyfriend had the Dry-In Kona crusted sirloin which was also juicy and amazing. For sides we sampled the mashed potatoes and the cream spinach, then we were about to explode (in a good way).The wine list is expansive and a bit overwhelming, but we found a reasonable one to go well with our steaks.I would highly recommend this as a date place or somewhere to come for a special occasion.
