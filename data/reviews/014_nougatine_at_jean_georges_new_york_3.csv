4.0,4/27/2019,The meal I had here was amazing! We had the following:-tuna tartare: this is one of the best that I've had at a restaurant. The sauce that comes with this is just amazing.-burrata: this came with a strawberry compote and the combination was so good and original -sea bass: this was cooked perfectly and the sauce that came with it was amazing. I also loved the roasted artichoke hearts that came with it.-prosciutto wrapped pork chop: my husband loved this dish-mashed potatoes: so good and creamy. I would definitely recommend. This restaurant was great!,0,0,0,Melissa P.,"New York, NY",131,354,692
5.0,4/27/2019,"Fantastic dinner. I was with a party of 4, we all enjoyed everything we ordered. I had the sea trout appetizer and sea bass entree and both were great. My husband ordered a burger and I thought ""what???"" But I took a bite and, yes, it was delicious.  My friend's pork chop looked fabulous and she loved it. The room is very nice as was the service. I trusted our waiter's recommendations and he cane through for me each time. Wish I had photos to share mostly bc it's not the kind of restaurant where you'd take pics of the food.",0,0,0,Robin M.,"Chappaqua, NY",7,65,53
5.0,4/12/2019,"Pure bliss. We came here for winter Restaurant Week and the next thing I remember, I was eating the most amazing wild gulf flounder in paprika butter, served on these soft pillows of heaven (they called it potato ravioli). My boyfriend and I just wanted more, and were seriously contemplating coming again the next day just for this dish. Please make it a regular item on the menu. Other items we ordered were the sea trout sashimi appetizer, which was amazingly fresh. I often avoid raw fish unless I know it's high quality, and this was top notch. I also tried the creamy tomato soup, which was tasty but not outstanding like the rest of the food. For dessert, we had the passion fruit pavlova and Jean Georges' signature molten chocolate cake with salted caramel ice cream. Both delicious and the perfect amount. Even more than the food, the atmosphere was wonderful and the service exceptional. It felt effortlessly (and unpretentiously) upscale. Our server was incredibly professional. We never had to call on him, but he was swift in getting us exactly what we needed. All without the dreaded hovering. He finished his shift while we were waiting for our desserts, and made sure to approach us and let us know we would continue to be in good hands and that it was his pleasure serving us. Class act. Bottom line: touché on being a high quality, upscale restaurant that can actually justify its above than average prices. A rarity. The dishes we were served were of true entree size, delectable, unique, and filling. We'll be back again soon.",0,0,0,Daisy W.,"Manhattan, NY",159,72,23
4.0,4/7/2019,"This is a cute place for brunch, located right next to Central Park. It's located at the lobby level of trump tower. For those of you who aren't familiar with the restaurant, Nougatine at Jean Georges is a more casual version of the the actual Jean-George's restaurant, which is right next door (they're literally connected and separated by a glass door, and share the same check-in area). So Nougatine is a bit more noisy, more likely to have young kids and crying babies etc, and the food is much cheaper also. Service here is still excellent, food comes out pretty quickly, and they give complimentary sourdough bread. Reservations are accepted here too; Just be sure you reserve at the right place (ie Nougatine at Jean-Georges vs Jean Georges). Parking is not impossible- there's street and meter parking within a few blocks walk if you drive. I highly recommend the lobster burger. It's such an interesting dish, and reminds me of a lobster roll. There's so much lobster with every bite, and comes with cheese and pickles. The dish comes with fries on the side, which are perfectly crisp and salted. The eggs Benedict with ham is also good, but nothing out of the ordinary. However, it does come with home fries, which I think I liked more than the eggs Benedict itself! The potatoes are sliced in small thin circles and very crispy on the outside. We also shared the calamari appetizer, which I wasn't a huge fan of. It was very fishy, which made it hard to enjoy the calamari itself. I've had plenty of fresh calamari before which didn't come with the fishy smell.",0,0,0,Ruby C.,"Cambridge, MA",8,181,212
2.0,3/31/2019,"Nougatine is very overrated. Every dish we ordered was bland and underwhelming. I dined at Nougatine last night for a birthday dinner - a party of 7. We all did not fully enjoy the appetizers, entrees, and the bottle of wine. The desserts were the best part of the meal. Here is what we ordered:Appetizers ~- Crab salad: meh, nothing special - Fried calamari: calamari didn't taste very fresh- Burrata salad: tasty but not anything special - Foie gras creme brûlée: very bitter and just not tasty- warm artichoke: extremely bland Entrees:- Prosciutto wrapped pork chop: mediocre and overcooked. The prosciutto was overcooked and did not complement the pork chop. I'd suggest bacon instead. - Beef tenderloin: nice cut of steak, but nothing special - Sea bass: good, but also nothing special - Hake: good but under-seasonedDesserts:- Meyer lemon creme brûlée: delicious, my favorite part of the meal- Apple cinnamon crumble cake: well made- Chocolate cake: also delicious- Peanut banana caramel tart: my least favorite dessertI can't remember what the wine was but it was so acidic and didn't pair well with any of the dishes we ordered. None of us would ever return.",1,1,1,Lin C.,"New York, NY",381,167,487
2.0,3/5/2019,"We came here for brunch and tried the eggs benedict and omelette. Both were tasty and I loved the side of crisped, thinly sliced potatoes bathed in butter. What we were very confused by though, was the side of artichoke that we ordered. It was a whole head of artichoke that we were supposed to peel and dip. It came very undercooked, and we were not able to find a part that was tender enough to eat even though we peeled until the center. When we brought this to our server's attention, she mentioned that she will check with the chef and did not return until half an hour later. She then kindly offered us another side (we chose brussel sprouts) which turned out to be delicious, but took another half an hour or so to arrive. So understandably, we were done with our other dishes and were just waiting on the brussel sprouts. During the wait, we were approached by three different servers asking if we were ready to get the check, and we had to explain every single time that we were waiting on a replacement dish. At one point we were literally done explaining to one server, and I took a sip of water, and another approached us. I don't know what the staff workflow protocol is (maybe there is such a long wait that the staff were trained to turn tables around as soon as they see a possible vacancy), but some structure and consistency would be nice.",0,0,0,Sophia X.,"Manhattan, NY",384,126,189
2.0,3/1/2019,"Seriously, for the price I was disappointed.   My fish was really blah and had bones in it.   The potatoes it came with were like a throw back to 1972, think German bar food.   Our artichoke appetizer was over steamed (yes, I'm from California, we are picky about our artichokes).    And I've had better meals at Nougatine than the one I had this week.   And for some strange reason they seated us in Jean-Georges (not the Nougatine side) at the very worst table where you can clearly observe the behind the scenes expediting.   I did very much enjoy the wine, however.   Lovely selection.",0,0,0,Stephanie B.,"Lafayette, CA",6,85,6

The food was excellent. We had the foie gras, trout and fennel for appetizer.  All 3 were excellently executed with interesting seasoning to compliment the flavors. Then we had burger and flounder.

1.0,2/5/2019,"Wow, utterly surprised by how disappointing the food was. My first time at Nougatine but having dined at Jean George before, I had high expectations. I started with the warm fennel salad which wasn't roasted well so had a really weird texture. For my entree, I had the flounder which honestly didn't have any kind of flavor whatsoever.

3.0,2/1/2019,Kinda average. Went for restaurant week but we got the scallops on the regular menu. The seasoning's too strong felt overwhelming and it's covering up the taste of the scallops/flounder. The appetizer sea trout sashimi was quite creative with yuzu sauce lime and pistachio. It's spicy but a good way of balancing the fat.The passion fruit dessert is like an egg with white icing shell and passion fruit ice cream inside -  not a very delightful taste and unnecessary,0,0,0,Jessica Q.,"New York, NY",392,1,2

3.0,1/27/2019,"Let me give you a low down of my experience here and why it's a 3 star rating.I have dined here twice and the first time was exceptional. If I remembered then to write the review it would've easily been hands down 5 stars all the way! I recently remembered the other night of how good the food was and decided to make reservations.We arrived at 3:00pm for a 3:15pm reservation, but since the table was not ready we waited at the bar. We were then seated 10 minutes after our reservation time, but that was not the issue. It started when we were seated at our table...So, our waiter (who I'm not going to name) was so quick to rush us out! When I tried to give him our order for the appetizer, he did not want to take it. Whaaat?! You say why?? Well let me tell you his reasoning- He wanted to know our whole order because he said that the kitchen was closing....Ok, but why not just put in the order for our appetizer so the kitchen can fire it up already?? As a matter of fact, why not just tell me during the time of reservation that making a 3:15pm reservation is a shitty time to come because the kitchen will be closing??? Well yelp readers, at least y'all know now. Don't show up at 3:15pm unless you want to feel like that diner who walks in right before closing, but doesnt give a shit and is hungry, ""so feed me anyways"" feeling.Too bad we had this experience...It's such a beautiful restaurant with floor to ceiling windows that looks out into Central Park. Unfortunately, I could not appreciate it because I literally was getting kicked out even before I could even place an order. Half way through with the crab cake appetizer, the waiter was already taking our plates away! I definitely think this waiter needs etiquette training. For a Jean-Georges restaurant, I would expect quality people and quality service....Anyways, I think I made my point. I hate complaining, but that waiter deserves 0 stars. The ambiance and food is consistently fantastic, which I give 5 stars. So overall 2.5 stars. Because the food is so great here I would come back, but I would def make sure we Do Not get the same waiter.Food reccomendations- The Organic Chicken is always perfectly roasted and so freakin' juicy.If you also get the steamed bass, dip the chicken in its green olive dressing to give it acidity.",3,2,1,Frances T.,"Manhattan, NY",245,87,440

I went with a group of six and was able to try a number of dishes.Let's start with the food, in my opinion good but not great. There was one appetizer I loved which was the crispy rainbow trout, the rice was flavorful and the fish was soft with subtle flavors. I was disappointed with the tuna tartar the fish was good but over seasoned with sauce and I wish they gave me something to eat the fish with other than a fork (wonton crisp or a chip). The butternut squash soup was tasteless in my opinion and wouldn't order again. As far as entrees, I liked the lobster burger. The patty was extremely seasoned with sauce that some may find too spicy but I enjoyed. While the pasta I tried was oversalted and I felt I could make a comparable dish at home. The salmon was cooked well and the cranberry sauce was interesting. My brother in law enjoyed his salmon Benedict, but I didn't try it. The service was good, but too slow we weren't able to order dessert because it took a bit over two hours to eat out appetizers and entrees.

1.0,1/13/2019,"Unfortunately, Nougatine was not the restaurant we were hoping to celebrate our anniversary at. The ambiance staff were generally fine, but food was beyond disappointing.Appetizers were oddly flavored, my trout over sticky rice would have been edible if it was not for the extremely overpowering onion taste they failed to mention on the menu. The foie gras was average, at best. Next we're the entrees. I had the tenderloin, which I had to return. The meat was smothered in what tasted like... BBQ sauce?? The Brussel sprouts were inedible because of their salt content. The dish was unpleasantly overwhelming. When telling our server this, he was kind and took the plate away but did not offer to replace my meal with anything, so I sat dinnerless on my anniversary. He said the manager would be over, and while the manager lingered around our table for some time, he never came over. My boyfriend had the veal, which while edible, completely fell apart at every stroke by his knife. The overly heavy breading went one way, while the dry veal went another. The serving size was decent, two large pieces of heavily breaded veal, but barely any sides and the bit of greens on the plate was yet again heavily over seasoned. To top it off, no one apologized to us for the less than ideal special occasion meal, knowing it was an anniversary dinner. I'm disappointed by not only the food, but the service.

I ordered the tuna tartare and the veal Milanese. Both tasted delicious. However, I thought the sauce for the tuna tartare should be left for me to pour, I thought it was a little over sauced. Also, warm lettuce in the veal Milanese was a little weird for me. I highly recommend the Tasmanian sea trout over the crispy sushi rice. I have have this variation at many restaurants but here at Nougatine, they really get the rice part cooked perfect. Not over fried or too crunchy.

We ordered the lunch prix fixe for $44/pp. we also had the Tasmanian Sea Trout on top of crispy sushi rice and a side of Brussels sprouts.For the appetizer, I had their tuna tartare. The tuna tartare was full of flavor and they put a glaze over it making it a good balance of flavors.I ordered the Sea Bass as it seemed very popular. Although the serving was on a the smaller side, it was good enough for me. But I think my fiancé wished there was more. The sea bass was very delicate and melted in my mouth. The dessert I ordered was the passion fruit which was super delicious and refreshing. If you love passion fruit, this is a go-to. Even if you don't love it but you're looking for something refreshing, this is a go-to.

2.0,12/27/2018,"I've eaten at multiple Jean-Georges restaurants before (including Nougatine), so I was pretty surprised that this visit wasn't as good as I was expecting. The best dishes were the Tasmanian sea trout on top of crispy sushi rice (I believe a variation of this dish is always on the menu, and it's always exceptional) and the gingerbread cake for dessert, which was a showstopper that came with gorgeous cranberry icing. I also loved the fig sour martini. The rest of our meal was not as successful. Our other appetizer was the shrimp salad, which came overdressed- when we finished, there was still a large pool of dressing left on the plate. Our entrees were the veal Milanese and the pache pasta with meatballs and pepper-tomato ragu. The veal Milanese was mostly breading, with a surprisingly small amount of veal, and the pasta was so salty that it honestly hurt my mouth a bit to eat it after a few bites. It was a real shame, because the flavor of the pasta was delicious and the texture of the meatballs was perfect, but the amount of salt ruined it. We were also a bit frustrated because we had told our waiter that we needed to leave the restaurant no later than 7:30 for a show, but there was a long wait for our check at the end of the meal, and we didn't receive it until a little later than 7:30.

3.0,12/16/2018,"It's sad to give 3 stars to a restaurant I have so loved in the past but two slip ups, one during our meal and one during the meal of our neighboring table really were disappointing. We had an open table reservation and arrived at 5 pm, our reservation time since we were attending a 7:30 concert at Lincoln Center. Our initial server (we had several throughout our meal) asked if we were going to the theater and what our curtain time was. We ordered the gently roasted fennel, the Tasmanian sea trout, the Seared Beef Tenderloin, the Veal Milanese, a scoop of Cranberry sorbet and the chocolate pecan tarte with poached pear. EVERYTHING was a great. Service was impeccable. However, the roasted fennel was $19 on the menu but $22 on the check. I'm sure that if I had called attention to this to one of our servers it would have been corrected but it shouldn't happen at all. However, a more serious issue occured at our adjoining table who ordered the Tasting Menu. They were brought the first two tasting menu items then were brought the third. The third should have been the scallop dish as listed on the menu. However, they were served, instead, a large fish! When they inquired, they were first told that the kitchen made a mistake. Really? The kitchen sent out 3 incorrect items? Then they were told that the tasting menu had actually changed from what was presented on the menu and the dish they were given was indeed the correct dish. The diners indicated that they were not happy with the substitution and the waiter indicated that they could enjoy the substitution complementary while the staff created the scallop dish which they were eventually served. The diners should have been notified of the change on the tasting menu when they were first presented with the menu or at the very least, prior to ordering it.

1.0,12/8/2018,"I would give nougatine 5 star if not for one server who ruined the night for me. As an old Chinese saying goes, 'one small mouse dropping destroys an entire pot of porridge'.Went with 3 friends for restaurant week dinner. As I was ready to order, pointing out my choice on the drink menu to the waitress, I felt a forceful jerk on the menu that I was holding, two hands reaching from afar pressing insistently on the menu to an angle smaller than 180 degree (I opened the menu all the way till the front cover and back flap touched). I was dumbfounded and felt very violated by this rude gesture. To make sure that I was not mistaken, I deliberately opened the menu again. Unmistakably, she reached out and forced my menu open again. 'I am not allowed to bend the menu?' I asked. She had the dasity to answer back, 'I prefer that you don't'. On that note, my night has turned irrevocably sour and I was in no mood for any drink. I closed the menu and returned it to her, expressing my lack of interest in dealing with such indecency. I believe she sensed my anger, and to stay true to her rude manners, she confronted me and went, 'If I let you bend the menu, would you care to order a drink?' 'Maybe', I responded, and she came back with, 'If you change your mind, let me know'.How such insolent attitude and atrocious behavior exist in a michelin 3 star Jean George affiliated restaurant I cannot fathom. She made me feel unwelcome and forced me to conform to her way via physical violence. My friends were also appalled and couldn't believe what they witnessed.  What grants a waitress the right to invade my personal space and correct me for doing something as infinitely insignificant as flipping menu? I never expected in my life to be upset over, let alone write a review about such preposterous matter, but I guess one can never underestimate the power of bad manners, lack of professional training, or just plain ineptitude of decent human interaction.My friend was kind enough to complain to the manager about her revolting act, and though the manager did not make an effort to make up for my trauma, she at least sympathized. This aside, the food was excellent. I am most likely to come back for the food, but I hope by the next time I'm back, this mouse dropping will already be permanently removed from the Jean George menu.Update: the mouse dropping was rightfully discarded from the restaurant.

Expect a very high end dining experiencing, from the moment you walk in and throughout the meal. Nougatine is the more casual sister restaurant of Jean-Georges, which is much more formal and even more upscale. I love the open kitchen concept, where diners can watch as the staff deftly navigates around the kitchen. There was even a dessert station where we saw the dessert chef meticulously plate the beautiful desserts. I also loved how open, airy, and bright the restaurant is, which was perfect for our lunch on a chilly autumn day.

If you want white instead of dark plates ask and say Myra told you to, one of his best and most demanding customers who also happens to be my mother.  If you are lucky Jean Georges May come out to greet and entertain you with his great smile and wit, or maybe his equally interesting brother Phillipe.

5.0,7/25/2018,"Jean-Georges on Columbus Circle is a welcoming, sophisticated find on the edge of Hells Kitchen and the Upper West Side. Sitting in the basement of the Trump International hotel, Jean-George's serves modern cuisine with classical French technique. Diners can either sit on the side of the dining room overlooking the kitchen or on the other side of the French doors leading to the terrace, which itself looks over Central Park. To start, I had the gazpacho. A bowl with raspberries, herbs, and chopped tomatoes was brought to the table by the graceful staff. A waiter-soldier poured the fruity, chunky gazpacho over the garnish to provide for a gazpacho combining smoothness and chunkiness. Next, we ordered the calamari. The squid pieces were perfectly cooked and crispy and were served with a champagne vinegar-based sauce that balanced the saltiness of the fried calamari. Jean-Georges' only mistake in the first part of the meal was the bread. While the multigrain loaf itself was fine, it wasn't warmed and was served with chilled, difficult-to-spread butter, not exactly what one has in mind for a top restaurant. I also tried some of Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten's famous shrimp salad. The salad is large, and the greens, tomatoes, and other assorted vegetables are dressed in a vinaigrette, while the warm prawns themselves are dressed in a champagne beurre blanc sauce. An amuse bouche of delicious ginger cucumber coconut soup was served somewhat awkwardly right as our appetizers were arriving, not before all the food or between courses as typically served. For my main course, I ordered the crispy Maine lobster. Large pieces of Maine lobster are fried in a mixture of potato starch and oil, compared, interestingly given the Asian (Thai) influences on Vongerichten's cooking, to Japanese tempura. The lobster itself was served over a bed of butter-sautéed cabbage and garnished with a pico de gallo of herbs, tomatoes, and ginger (again, Asian influences). For its price, the Maine lobster was a good deal and was surely delicious. Others I know ordered the steamed black sea bass and the lobster burger. The lobster, for those wondering, is not 24-karat lobster (and I mean karat, not carat, as in the purity of gold alloy, not the mass of a jewel), but rather a mixture of herbs, spices, lobster, and shrimp to bind it all together. It is served with shoestring French fries, a rarity in nouvelle cuisine restaurants. To finish, I ordered Vongerichten's famous warm chocolate cake: a chocolate dome filled with smooth semi-sweet chocolate ganache. On the side, vanilla bean ice cream and, since it was my birthday, a candle and the words ""happy birthday!"" spelled in hardened white chocolate were served.

When the busser finally came at the very end, he asked how the chicken was because he saw was 1/2 was uneaten, I told him, and only then did the manager come by an apologize and said she'd take the drinks off the bill because she knew they were very late.

While it is more casual and less stuffy than its sister restaurant Jean-George's right next door, it is still pretty upscale for a special occasion. Lunch ($38)1) The tuna tartare was really fresh and delicious - a beautiful presentation on a bed of avocado and tangy ginger marinade, with a pretty radish flower on top. Almost too pretty to eat :) 2) I ordered the black cherry yuzu and it was amazingly refreshing and complemented the rest of my meal well.  3) The sesame crusted salmon was incredibly tender, and had a wonderfully masterful sear and crisp on the outside. The potatoes were sautéed and everything was paired super well. 4) To conclude with the wonderful, classic warm chocolate cake and salted caramel ice cream, my lunch was complete! The chocolate cake was gooey and warm and melty, and the ice cream was decadently rich.  Dinner 1) The sea trout sashimi was really fresh and had a wonderful texture - the hint of lime and mint really added to its flavor.2) The flounder tasted delicious with the soy yuzu broth and the pieces of spaghetti squash tasted crunchy like chips. 3) I was full already from the flounder and barely finished my warm chocolate cake and caramel ice cream :) but it was amazing as usual.",1,0,2,Jessica M.,"Manhattan, NY",535,22,45

5.0,5/17/2018,"As sweet and historically significant as the nougat, yet as affordable as tin - a beautiful harmony that defines the very essence of Nougatine, one of my favorite brunch spots in New York, and certainly ranking higher in order above it's sister, Jean Georges, in my heart and mind. Why?In juxtaposition with the more stuffy and pretentious sister restaurant, Nougatine is the perfect balance of comfort and luxury, with no less exceptional service.  Nougatine greets you with that sense of sipping-afternoon tea-by-a-garden like tranquil comfort yet with just enough glamour to mark a special occasion that is difficult to master. The food is inventive and fun; the service is remarkable (the waiter did not once question or push us to order more though we had ordered less than a standard amount); and the ambiance is one of a comfortable French kitchen - affordable luxury at its best. On to the ""meat and potatoes"" -(1) The shrimp salad was a beautiful harmony of rich shrimp meets crisp greens, creamy avocado, with just the right tinge of champagne vinegar to cut through the creaminess(2) The fried calamari was among the best I've had to date - crisp and importantly, fresh. Not drenched in sauce or overfried to mask frozen calamari, rather perfectly seasoned in basil salt and lightly battered to complement the already exquisite fresh delicacy. (3) The Skuna Bay Salmon on top crisp sushi rice with chipotle mayo was an ode to my childhood but in an inventive way - it took me back to those days I would eat grilled musubis (rice balls), but with added components and made bite size. (4) The fresh spaghetti with basil pistachio pesto was likely my favorite item - I loved how the peppery basil met with the creamy and nutty pistachio to arrive at the blend of flavors no short of a celebration in its own right. (5) The rigatoni with meatballs and smoked pepper tomato each was also delicious but no basil pistachio pesto.  The meatballs were tender, the noodles al dente, and the tomatoes a vibrant beautiful red color that define southern Italy. (6) The lobster burger was absolutely divine, with large chunks of lobster bound by shrimp in an enjoyable burst of both flavors in every bite, all the while balanced with buttery lettuce, tomatoes, and a side of crisp fries. (7) The signature Jean Georges warm chocolate cake was smaller in portion (and flatter) than I had hoped, but it was cooked to perfection, with a very good, authentic bitter yet sweet chocolate taste that was not artificial. The chocolate cake was paired well with the vanilla bean ice cream. (8) The passion fruit pavlova was very light and tangy.  The meringue was sweet, crisp and airy, with the taste of the passion fruit coming through the sorbet core.",3,0,1,Vivienne K.,"Honolulu, HI",40,194,987

5.0,4/15/2018,"Came here with my husband to celebrate my birthday. Upon arrival, we were asked if we had theater plans afterward, which I thought was great, so they would know if we needed to get out of there by a certain time. We told them we were seeing a concert at Lincoln Center at 7:30. Cocktails were good - my husband ordered a Manhattan, which was delicious. I ordered the Elderflower Paloma (tequila, grapefruit juice, elderflower, soda). I didn't really taste any carbonation, so there must have been only a splash of soda, and the elderflower was super faint. I really only tasted the tequila and grapefruit. Tasty, though.Bread & butter: the bread was delicious. The butter would've been better had it been room temperature rather than cold. Or, if the bread was warm. It made spreading difficult. That's my nitpicky comment for this review :)Amuse bouche: hummus with endive, radish, peas. Nothing fancy - just good fresh veggies and hummus. We opted for the 5-course tasting menu ($118/person) and added on the wine pairings ($78/person).1st Course: tuna tartare, avocado, radish, ginger marinade. This was a great dish in terms of taste and balance.  2nd Course: Foie Gras brule with pineapple-lemon jam and rose salt. The foie gras was amazing on a tiny piece of toast. And the caramelization on top was SO GOOD. A little burnt, a little crispy, a little candied. YUM.3rd Course: This was supposed to be a salmon dish but we asked if the chef would substitute the black sea bass instead. Usually with tasting menus, there are no substitutions so I was happy that they were willing to accommodate. The sea bass was served atop a garlic lemon sauce with fava beans and DELICIOUS artichoke hearts. It was a pretty decent size piece of fish for a tasting menu, I thought, which was nice. Really delicious dish.4th Course: Beef tenderloin, roasted asparagus, jalapeño and a mustard butter. It was cooked very well and was juicy and flavorful. Also a decent size. Delicious.Dessert: passion fruit sorbet, the JG chocolate lava cake, vanilla ice cream atop cookie crumble, and some sort of deliciousness in a ramekin and I forgot what it was! SO GOOD. They even put a candle on the plate and wrote ""happy birthday"" for me :)The wine pairings were spot on - we LOVED everything that was poured for us, including the madeira with dessert.We left the restaurant at 7:10 - only because I realized the time and asked for the check. Good thing we were only going two blocks away! We JUST made our Lincoln Center concert. Maybe they thought we needed to leave by 7:30, not that the concert started at that time.

4.0,3/16/2018,"I had a satisfactory Michelin fine-dining experience for 3 dollar signs, which is fine by me. I called for a reservation that afternoon for an evening date, a relatively brazen, overstretching demand for a popularized Manhattan restaurant for which they graciously able to accommodate (although to be honest, it was a Sunday). When we entered, we were greeted by an amiable team of attendants who took our coat check and sat us down at our table briskly. While it is in a Trump building with a gaudy exterior, the interior on both the hotel side and the entrance was actually very elegant and posh.  While walking to our table, I glanced into a portal of white table cloths and superior lighting ornaments, of which I assumed the actual Jean Georges was situated. However, the large windows overlooking the Park and modern hotel getup of Nougatine was a force to be reckoned with in its own right. We sat down, had a fine red that waiter recommended and the overly decadent Foie Gras Brule appetizer (though I'll give it credit for its gumption and finely-executed caramelized shell). I ordered the soy-glazed short rib, which was tender of a modern with a non-traditional flavorful twang expected for an establishment that errs on the more adventurous side.

5.0,3/13/2018,"I've been here twice now - once for Restaurant Week lunch and the second for Valentine's Day. I was seriously impressed both times, and can't wait to come back.While Nougatine is the more casual accompanying restaurant to Jean-Georges, though it is still pretty upscale. All the patrons here are pretty well-dressed, and you'll need a reservation in advance to avoid sitting at the bar. In my opinion, it's a bargain because the dishes here are crafted by the same team managing Jean-Georges - you can tell that thought and care went into each plate on the menu.My favorites include the Tuna Tartare (nicely presented on top of a bed of avocado and ginger marinade with a radish flower on top), the Fried Calamari (really well seasoned, not overbreaded, rich dipping sauce), and the Warm Chocolate Cake (one of the best lava cakes I've had). When I came for Restaurant Week, I had the Veal Milanese, which was honestly a bit forgettable - though I liked how it paired with parmesan. My date had the Zucca, and raved about the meatballs.We had a great experience coming back for Valentine's Day. The staff were extremely polite and accommodating. We initially got seated in a relatively cramped corner near the kitchen against the wall, but they were very flexible and moved us to a nice window seat as soon as one opened up. They also gave us lots of small sushi bites on the house for the occasion. We had the 28 Day Dry Aged Ribeye for Two, which was flawless.This place is great. Impeccable service, casual yet upscale ambience, food served by a Michelin star team at a good value. I would definitely come back.",2,0,1,Kevin T.,"New York, NY",284,72,177

3.0,3/4/2018,"We went here towards the end of restaurant week. They didn't publish the menu beforehand but I expected from what I'd heard about the restaurant that it would be good. We were severely disappointed with the choices, and my friend decided to get something off of the regular menu. I had the restaurant week menu of the shrimp appetizer, the bolognese pasta and then the chocolate lava cake with salted caramel ice cream. Let me start by saying the desert was ah-mazing! The lava cake was moist and delicious and served at just the right temperature, and the ice cream was excellent. But, the rest of the meal was very lacking. The appetizer was pretty bland and just nothing exciting and the bolognese has very little sauce on it and could have used more seasoning. My friend was also disappointed with her meal and as I mentioned she ordered off the regular menu. Her fries were extremely greasy and the burger was very difficult to eat the way it was put together. We also saw the table next to us cut into their chicken to find it was undercooked - and from our table it did look undercooked - but the waiter proceed to tell her ""oh, no that's just the way the chicken is prepared"" instead of taking it back.",1,0,0,Martha H.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,57,89

4.0,2/17/2018,"Tucked between the entrance and main dining room of Jean-Georges, Nougatine offers the culinary prowess of JG in a more relaxed environment. Make no mistake, though, it is still quite sumptuous and a treat to enjoy. The environment is unabashedly luxe, as are the clientele, and the space has a nice energy with the open kitchen close at hand. The food at Nougatine is clear in concept and executed with precision by the same team serving two Michelin star Jean-Georges and offers great value. If that's not enough to win you over, the cocktail and wine list should seal the deal - both are extensive and well done. Overall, a great place to dine and a reliable choice we can't help revisiting.Atmosphere- Clean and airy, with luxe finishes; open to the kitchen serving both Nougatine and Jean-Georges.- Generally well-dressed (and well-heeled) clientele in spite of the 'causal' descriptor.- Space is not very large, so expect most tables to be rather close together and tucked into various nooks and crannies.FoodOur experience at Nougatine over many visits has shown the food to be consistently high quality with superb execution and elegant flavor profiles befitting the season. It is prepared by the same kitchen as Jean-Georges, giving it great quality to value. The menu has good breadth across light/heavy and tastes, making it versatile to many groups/occasions. On this visit we had:- Foie Gras Brulé (Pineapple-Meyer Lemon Jam, Rose - $26): Just the right amount of decadance, bruleed foie atop pastry, the jam paired perfectly. Not too heavy.- Spaccatelli Pasta (Caramelized Brussel Sprouts, Basil-Pistachio Pesto - $25): One of our perennial favorites on the menu, great in the fall/winter; though woefully under-salted this time.- Sautéed Black Sea Bass (Broccoli Rabe, Sesame Vinaigrette, Lavender - $35): Perfectly cooked, the vinaigrette was an excellent complement. Great lighter option.- Soy Glazed Beef Short Ribs (Apple-Jalapeno Puree, Rosemary Crumbs - $41): Decadent and rich, but so comforting on a winter's eve.- Creme Fraiche Cheesecake (Cranberry-Orange Compote, Pistachio - $12): Loved the concept and taste, much lighter than normal cheesecake.BeverageThe bar at Nougatine is clearly one of the venue's strong suits, and reason enough to stop over, though seats disappear quickly. The bartenders always make an excellent martini ($24), and are great at listening to and adjusting for your preferences. The cocktail list is very well conceived, and my wife loves the Elderflower Paloma (Casamigos Blanco Tequila, Elderflower, Grapefruit, Soda - $18) which is quite refreshing without being too sweet. Nougatine offers a very extensive and well-selected wines by the glass list, with something for everyone, as well as the full wine list available in Jean Georges, if you care to splurge. I keep returning to the 2015 Ponzi Pinot Noir ($18).Service- Historically quite good and attentive.- This visit, our waiter wasn't representative of our typical experiences. He was rather awkward (asking as soon as we sat down if we were celebrating something?, seemed incapable of understanding we would share some early courses) and simply didn't listen to our requests (from pacing of courses, to removing items from the table, etc.).

The chic presentation alone will increase your appetite. All the ingredients were very fresh. The avocado on the bottom complemented the taste and texture of the tuna on the top very well. The sweet sour marinade stimulated my taste buds and provided a unique flavor. The Fried Calamari was fried to perfection with not a lot of breading but somehow still crispy. For the entree, we ordered the Veal, which was very thin and crispy and topped with shredded rich Parmesan. The fried flounder was prepared in an Asian fusion style. Also, the fried pumpkin seeds really complemented the sauce.For dessert, the Passion Fruit Pavlova was a total hit.

5.0,2/12/2018,"I had been to Jean Georges a few times but had never been to Nougatine.  My friends and I decided to come for dinner for restaurant week, and I actually like this place better than Jean Georges.We ended up not even getting the restaurant week menu because the options were not the same as the menu we found online, and they were frankly really bad options.  Also, the prices here are pretty reasonable so even with an appetizer and entree per person, and dessert to share and a glass of wine each - it was $88 per person with tip, that's pretty good.For the appetizers my one friend and I shared the tuna tartare and the foie gras (my other friend ordered the tartare for herself).  The tartare is basically like the tuna ribbons at Jean Georges and the server said the sauce is even the same.  The tuna ribbons (and now tuna tartare at Nougatine) is one of my favorite dishes, so I was happy to see that this is the same just in a different form (they're not in a ribbon shape).  The foie gras was AMAZING.  So well prepared and flavorful and the brioche on the bottom was great.For the entree my one friend and I shared the burger and the poppyseed crusted salmon (my other friend ordered the veal, which was a very large portion.  The burger was quite large and soo juicy/yummy with a delicious sauce.  The french fries were thin and cirspy awesomeness. I was hesitant to order the salmon because the thing I don't like about Jean Georges is how all the entrees are over seasoned and crusted and poppy seed crust didn't sound promising.  That being said, it was not overpowering and the salmon was cooked very well and the dish was balanced.We were pretty full so the three of us just shared 1 chocolate dessert, which had a warm gooey center and was perfect.Overall, I'm a big fan of Nougatine and would choose this place again over Jean Georges.",1,1,1,Elyka A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",198,204,634
1.0,2/11/2018,"Nope. A friend and I came for her birthday during Restaurant Week. We both looked at the very limited menu (2 options for each course) and I opted out of it. I got their burger ($19) and it just wasn't good. It was cooked well, medium, but the beef wasn't seasoned. The sauce was just Russian dressing. It wasn't easy to eat or pick up either, due to the arrangement of the layers. They did it in kind of an ""assemble your own"" style that wasn't super successful. The yuzu pickles were good- I finished all of those- but, the best thing about a $20 burger shouldn't be the pickles. The fries were shoestring fries, which I normally like, but these were fried at an incorrect temperature and were just soaked with grease. It was also EXTREMELY cold here. We, and the table behind us, brought this to the attention of the server and were basically told to deal with it. I will admit, with how cold I was, it would have been very difficult to enjoy even the most expertly prepared meal. It did finally start to warm up towards the end, but we really could have done without the waitress's attitude about it. And the staff. Yeah. Our waitress made it seem like we were a burden and inconveniencing her. I watched her argue with the table next to us (a different table than the other table who complained about the cold) when a chicken, one of the restaurant week dishes, was underdone. I saw the meat- it was. But this waitress just proceeded to insist it was ""cooked to a safe temperature"" and ""organic birds still look pink when cooked"" with the customer. It made things really uncomfortable for everyone around. Not to mention, it made me very glad I didn't do the restaurant week menu. The ""saving grace"" of this place? Dessert. I got the candied pineapple. It was, honestly, excellent. But with so many world renowned dessert places in NYC, there's no chance I'd be back just for dessert. Overall, thanks Nougatine!

3.0,2/5/2018,"First time here, dropped in without a reservation during Restaurant Week. The hostess informed me that without a reservation and if they're booked, guests will be seated by the bar. So I recommend getting your coat checked to conserve seating space on your chair. And make a reservation prior if it's not too late already because having ate a meal at their bar, it completely ruined the dinning experience at a nice restaurant for me. I don't like being stuck inbetween people who occasionally elbows you and knocks your arms while you're holding your utensils....and surrounded by mutiple groups of people and their conversation...Esp in close proximity is just migraine inducing...(yes...I did get one) let's just say ..Money can't but class or manners....smhUpon entering, the atmosphere ..it's beautiful...The interior decoration is cohesive, with its transparent kitchen in the back. After being seated, it was nice to find purse hooks beneath the bar counter. And the chairs by the bar weren't backless, it's half way for support..And aestetics of their overall dinning interior style.The snacks at the table by the bar: popcorn with olive oil, pulverized rosemary and sprinkles of cayenne pepper on top, pretzel sticks, wasbi covered peanuts, five spice almonds with rosemary and chili powder. The menu selection for restaurant week was very limiting..as in only two entree options, vegetarian or chicken ...:/..However, quality dinner... The appetizer I picked was the Seared Gulf shrimps....but don't let the name fool you....it's not large shrimps folks....however, the puree from the shrimp was deliciously mind puzzling when I was trying to figure out the sensation on my taste buds; it's playful on its own.The roasted chicken entree....reminded me of flatiron pressed chicken from how it looked upon arrival. The skin was crispy and it was pleasantly deboned, paired with light seasoning that also came with a pour on broth, which changed the experience a bit. The entree was light and delicious.The dessert recommended was the warm chocolate cake with salted caramel ice cream. The chocolate cake was soft and the filling was dark chocolate...however, it just felt like a richer lava cake to me. The star of the dish was the salted caramel iced cream and the extra crispy decoration on top...(which I wished the cookie crumbles beneath the ice cream was actually crispy and not so stale....)However, the biggest pet peeve tonight outside of dinning at the bar....Was the frozen butter that came straight out of the fridge...I was half way done with my entree and the butter was still too stiff to smear over the slice of bread provided ...:/ ...No butter is supposed to provide hand discomfort...They took a new tray of butter that had to be heated twice since the first try got it to the same room temperature as the first one. And the second attempt didn't soften the whole thing neither.... You'd be better off asking for olive oil and surrender the butter completely....Side Note:*Google maps might be abit confusing for this place, it's located on the block behind the Trump hotel.*The regular menu item that caught my eye was the Dry aged  Ribeye steak for two thats $138. It is a bone-in steak that's 32oz before cooking.FYI:The recommended ""Less crowded"" day for the bar area: Mondays and Sundays..Around 5pm, when the bar first opens...Till about 5:30pm and then Later on around 9pmAnd for other days..Come around 445pm to be safe.* Sit by the ends of the bar if you want to avoid the crowd swarming sensation...People tend to gravitate towards the middle of the bar and it'll feel like a fully surrender ambush of people...*There is No Happy Hour at this place...But they do have a lot of regulars that lives and works in the area.*Hostesses stated that reservations needs to be made ""at least two weeks prior""... (Surprised)Highlight was the service provided from the bar staff (Justin is very knowledgeable and his recommdations were spot on. Most bartenders I observed, knew their regulars by name, with their preferences, just great),  the interesting bar snacks in the multi tray, and the salted caramel iced cream.

2.0,1/30/2018,"Wanted to try out their restaurant week menu. Was very disappointed. Had their Tuna tartar for appetizer, the ginger sauce they put was way too salty. The main course, I had a bite. Dessert, found a paper in the chocolate cake. The only good part of this restaurant was their servers. They were all polite. I was excited about this restaurant and expected more.

5.0,1/30/2018,"tl;dr I had a wonderful dinner at Nougatine and would highly recommend you check it out (definitely go for restaurant week). APPETIZER: I got the trout sashimi with pistachios and lime and the textures and flavors were perfect. I loved how the crunch of the pistachios contrasted with the softer texture of the sashimi so it was already a great start to the meal. My one complaint here is that it was a pretty small portion compared to other appetizers I've eaten, but the flavors were delicious.ENTREE: This was probably one of my favorite entrees at any restaurant I've eaten at. I got the flounder with a soy yuzu broth and I loved this dish because the portion size was HUGE. I haven't seen that big of a portion at such a high end place so it was definitely worth the money. The broth was also great and didn't overpower the fish (they only poured a tiny bit of broth on so it was good that they did that) and the most surprising part was the spaghetti squash. I was not expecting spaghetti squash to have the crunch that this did and it was delicious and provided a nice contrast to the rest of the dish. Overall, fantastic.DESSERT: Of course I got the chocolate lava cake and salted caramel ice cream. I absolutely loved how the two parts worked together in terms of hot and cold and it was definitely a quality dessert. I'd say I've had better desserts at other restaurants, but it was definitely a great dessert.SERVICE: The service here was fantastic - the waiter came back to check on our courses, we never had to ask for more bread or water, and it was overall just quality service.Overall, I don't have many complaints and I was pretty blown away by the quality of the meal - definitely recommend it!",0,0,0,Michael L.,"Manhattan, NY",1032,172,59

5.0,1/26/2018,"My husband and I came here for dinner during restaurant week and we loved every bit of it. From the moment that we entered the door next to the main entrance of trump towers, it was smooth sailing with exceptional service and attentiveness. We had a reservation and were seated immediately By a hostess who was really warm and friendly. We ordered the following from the restaurant week dinner menu-For starters we both got the sashimi with pistachios and chili lime oil and it was nothing like what I imagined. All the flavors and textures were like a flavor bomb exploded in my mouth. What a start!For the main my husband got the chicken with winter vegetables and I got the flounder. While I loved the textures and flavors in my fish dish, my Husband's chicken had a weird smell/taste to it and our server upon hearing it happily suggested to change the dish. So my husband too ended up getting the flounder which was incredible. The yuzu broth balanced the flavors superbly.For dessert we got the molten chocolate cake with caramel ice cream which is Jean-Jeorges signature dessert and I can totally imagine why. It was flawless and perfectly molten in the center. We also got the poached pear with pecan praline which was realy nice too, especially paired with earl grey.

4.0,1/26/2018,"I have dined at Nougatine three times and the experience has been good all three times. I have done the lunch prix fixe twice (October 2013 and November 2017) and restaurant week (Winter 2015). I have noticed that their prix fixe menu offerings doesn't change super often, but I know that they always offer their signature warm chocolate cake for dessert. This review is for the lunch prix fixe offering when I dined during my birthday back in November since it was my latest visit and I still remember some of the details.APPETIZER:Fried Calamari: I remember that during my friend order this back when I first dined at Nougatine and it tasted pretty good. So, I decided it order it this time around. The fried calamari wasn't oily at all and it has a nice crispy tempura like texture. Delicious and I recommend it.ENTREE:Roasted Hake: It had a mushroom yuzu vinagrette, celeriac, and shiso. The entree was a little bit salty to me.DESSERT:Warm Chocolate Cake: It also comes with vanilla bean ice cream. I love this dessert. YUM! My boyfriend called the restaurant to make sure they put a happy birthday chocolate sign with the cake. I thought it was cute and nice. :)Overall, I haven't been disappointed here at Nougatine and it's still one of my favorite fine dining establishments. The service has been great and professional. I also recommend people to definitely try coming here for lunch during Winter and Summer NYC restaurant week. You'll get a wonderful meal for $29.

The flounder entree had an Asian take on it and was delicious. My boyfriend got the chicken entree which had both white and dark meat. Finally, the chocolate cake is to die for.

5.0,1/24/2018,"I had an absolutely wonderful time at Nougatine other night. It was my first time dining here and since it is NYC Restaurant Week, we had a lovely three course pre fixe meal that was to die for. My one issue? I left the restaurant extremely full (first world problems). My friend reminded me of the upcoming restaurant week in NYC and invited me to dinner, my choice. Of course, I had a list of choices and we decided on Nougatine because well, Jean Georges, of course. I have never been and it was a long time since my friend had eaten there. I almost missed my chance at a table. I inadvertently booked a table for 8 AM (I have a no idea how I managed to screw that up) and when I called to find out what happened, the woman I spoke with explained my mistake. Despite there being no tables available at 8 PM, which is what I originally wanted, there was a 9 PM opening available which I jumped on.I found parking in the street just down the block which was very convenient. My friend was waiting for me out front and when we entered the building, I was impressed by how organized they are. We checked in with the maitre d and were able to check our coats at the same time. All three of the women at the host table were gracious and pleasant. We arrived a little before half past 8, just in case we could snag an earlier open table. We were directed to the bar to wait until our table was ready and decided to have a few cocktails. We both had tasty mocktails, I forgot the name of mine (Orchard Blush?) but my friend ordered the Thyme Lemonade. About ten minutes later, one of the hostesses came to check on us and show us to our table. We were able to transfer out drinks and she had our server bring our drinks to us. That is a small gesture but it speaks volumes on their attention to detail. We felt pampered. A few moments after we got cozy at our table, Sarah came by to greet us, give us menus and serve our drinks. Ultimately, we were seated twenty minutes before our reservation time which I greatly appreciated.We opted for the restaurant week pre fixe menu but in true foodie fashion, we also ordered a few items a la carte.Restaurant Week Menu: Tomato Soup - this tasted amazeballs! It's a more than enough bowl of creamy tomato soup poured over a deconstructed grilled cheese. The huge piece of buttery toasted sourdough and cheddar cheese in the bottom of the bowl was a nice touch.Sea Trout Sashimi - my friend's dish which he loved. We both found ourselves pausing in between bites to savour it all. Roasted Organic Chicken - my friend's dish which was served with roasted winter veggies. I tasted a bit of his romanesco and it had a nice smoky char.Wild Flounder - I really liked this dish. The fish was served over spaghetti squash which I love and a light, citrus-y yuzu sauce. I was becoming too full to finish my entrée so I had to make a decision; either eat all my fish or take it home and save my tummy real estate for dessert. Needless to say, dessert won.Warm Chocolate Cake - I loved this. It's their signature dessert, an upgrade on a molten lava cake, served with creamy salted caramel ice cream. I made the best decision to save room for dessert. Roasted Pear - my friend's dish which tasted dreamy. The pear is stuffed with Nutella and paired with a pecan praline and whipped cream.A la Carte: Foie Gras - my friend's extra. It was served on toast with pineapple-meyer lemon jam that I HAD to taste. It was soooo creamy and melted in my mouth. Worth every bite. Burrata - I ordered this extra. The plating was beautifully simple. It was a super creamy burrata ball sitting atop a meyer lemon jam with pumpernickel toasts. Amazing and probably the main reason I couldn't finish my entire meal. The service here is impeccable. Our dishes were cleared on cue, water constantly refilled and we were checked on, regularly. We were served hearty bread while we waited and I would suggest not eating more than two pieces because you will have a most difficult time trying to finish everything.Sarah, our server, was great. She had a wonderful demeanor as did everyone with whom we interacted. My entrée was waiting with the maitre d when we left and I was given a number to claim it on the way out. I would definitely come back and I'm happy to have had this dining experience.",35,17,37,Amanda G.,"Yonkers, NY",1010,912,5110

Appetizers appeared relatively quickly--butternut squash soup was sweet, creamy and full of heart wintery flavors--and then we waited. And waited. And waited. People who arrived after us were served. Requests to our waiter and the manager were answered with assurances that our food was on the way had ""had already been plated."" The orders didn't appear. We let them know we wouldn't have time for desert. Still nothing. Finally the food appeared. Salmon crusted with poppy seeds was good but not great--likely flash frozen (which is not bad...better actually than day old fresh)--without the fresh notes you'd typically get from really good salmon. The waiter then delivered our check. No apology for bad service... just for it taking a long time. Nothing comped. (Not even a cup of coffee.)

4.0,12/30/2017,"Nougatine is the little brother restaurant of the famous Jean Georges which is also housed in Trump Hotel.  Decided to dine here for Christmas (not the exact day) this year as I thought Jean Georges was a bit (a lot in fact) over my budget.  It is definitely the casual side of Jean George, but is very classy and great for a special dinner.We were led by the hosts to a table which was very close to the entrance (I would take it as I made the arrangement pretty late, but this is an issue that I will bring up at one point at a restaurant in the future.  We will see when that will be).We started with sunchoke soup with truffle which was warm and also tasted great.  Were also given sourdough bread to start with (actually the table next to me had a variety of bread while we only got the sourdough so I request other kind and they complied with it.  But then it seemed like the next table was a regular at Jean Georges and they were gettting some of the stuff served from Jean Georges, not Nougatine... so If you see someone getting stuff you were not offered, that's why).Then we had shrimp salad and crab cake.  I had crab cake because I had a good experience with the same dish at the Mark by Jean Georges and it was still good.  The shrimp tasted really good and the texture was almost like that of langostine.  Also the portion was so big that people with small stomach can take it as a full entree even.  The next one ordered was basil and pistachio pasta to share, which was also really good. For entree we had pork chop which was very crisp outside but tender inside.  Perfectly medium cooked.  Chicken was good.  The skin was perfectly crispy, but it would have been better if the meat was a little more juicy.  For dessert, none other than the signature lava cake I always loved in all Jean Georges. Don't underestimate Nougatine because it is the little one of Jean Georges.  It will still haunt your wallet, but overall I think it was well worth it for our Christmas dinner.",2,0,1,Jay I.,"New York, NY",260,683,192

Food didn't taste as good as before - the shrimp was not cleaned and still had shell and black mud/poop in it, fish was way too salty and had too much ginger in the sauce. The dessert was okay. I guess it was because of the Christmas/ holiday rush, but it just felt the restaurant standards have gone down a lot... I wonder if that's why Jean-George's lost one star for 2018 Michelin rating.

All of the food was amazing- not one complaint. It was all very very savory, until we got to the dessert. The chocolate cake is a must!

My passion is food and cuisine.  I was visiting New York City and wanted to experience a New York City Michelin star rated restaurant. Upon arrival I asked the waitress if there was a dress code; she replied no. I was dressed casually and by myself. I was seated at the end of the bar. I waited for someone to greet me. No one acknowledged me. I waved down someone and ordered a high end tequila. The bartender served my drink and walked off. Did not offer me a menu, water or anything else. I waved him down to ask for a menu. I was given one. I waved someone down again just to get a glass of water. I waited to see if someone would follow up with me. It's seemed as though both bartenders where to busy socializing with everyone else at the bar besides myself. I waved someone down again. Asked them to tell me more about the $120 rib eye. He simply pointed at the person sitting next to me and stated "" that's it"" and walked off. I had intended to order the steak but was becoming very frustrated with the service and poor attitude of my server. I waved someone down again and ordered the burger because I was hungry and wanted to just get out of there. The burger was ordered medium rare, it came out almost well done. I took one bite and put it down waiting for someone to come by. I waited five minutes. Said fuck it and ate the rest because I was tired of waiting and wanted to just leave.

5.0,10/31/2017,"Excellent preparation and intelligent flavor balances for the most part. The environment feels slightly clinical and cold. It's not a cozy intimate dining experience. I ordered the foie gras brulé supplement along with a prix fixe selection ($38) of Tuna Tartare, Roast Hake, and Chocolate cake. The meal started with mediocre bread and butter that was OK, but was served cool with a very firm butter that lacked creaminess. I was very disappointed Jean Georges doesn't serve well-executed bread. There wasn't even a selection. Just a piece of mediocre bread. The foie brulé was perfectly smooth like butter yet the sear on top was impossibly crisp and maillardy. The brioche underneath added an interesting variation in mouthfeel. The dish is served with an unctuous fig marmalade. It's creamy and sweet with an intense fig flavor. The foie was incredibly rich and the fig cut into the fattiness in a perfect complement. This dish was ethereal. The tuna tartare primarily excelled in execution. The tuna was perfectly smooth and mouthmelting. But, it lacked flavor. Thus the acidic sauce and micro-greens left the taste of a vinegary salad. I understand the dish is designed to prepare the palate, but I felt it was overly acidic. The hake was very nicely executed, but could have used more seasoning. The fish tasted very plain and still wasn't as fall-apart as I've seen from sous-vide preparations. I'd like to see the dish challenge the palate more. The hake was served on a perfectly cooked potato. It almost tasted meaty. The chocolate cake was similar to a lava cake. It was extremely well-executed. The crumb was moist, deeply sweet and buttery. The cake is served upside down and oozes chocolate sauce as you break into it. The ice cream was smooth and creamy, a nice temperature and flavor contrast to the cake. Overall, I liked the meal a lot, so I give it 5/5 stars. However, I took objection to some of the flavors and execution decisions. The environment is not quite as luxurious as other 3-star options in NY.

I was told on arrival that it was ""not available."" We were seated at a table in the middle of the hall, so it made me feel a little uneasy. The guests were nice about it, and it was a relief for me. I suggest making a reservation well in advance (weeks was not enough) if you require a specific table or a private setting.

1.0,9/13/2017,"A Monday night reservation for two on the terrace was a disaster. It was with great enthusiasm that I put a reservation in place at what is a New York institution.Upon arriving, we were taken to our table on the terrace and seated. After 10 minutes, we had not been offered a drink of any type, nor had we been seen to by service staff or offered a menu. We were then asked what our water preference was, and were provided with a food menu. Alas still no offer of a drink!When the water arrived, I requested a wine/cocktail list. Another 15 minutes elapsed, and by this time, we had been seated for 25 minutes, and we're still to receive a drink list. It was at this point, that we rose and departed the restaurant.A thoroughly disappointing experience. As we collected a bag from the front reservation desk, I mentioned our experience to the front desk operator, who casually said he would pass on the feedback to his manager. A number of other patrons were requesting the check, dessert, their drinks etc multiple times and there was clearly an issue with service or lack-thereof on the evening. The terrace seemed to have limited staff, whereas inside Nougatine, there appeared to be no issue with staffing.We expected far better, and were genuinely excited.  Sadly after this experience, we won't be back.",0,0,0,Richard D.,"New York, NY",0,6,15

Now the food: Cucumber and yogurt soup: I normally dislike chilled soup. I never really had a gazpacho I loved. This cucumber chilled soup was something else. It doesn't have the overwhelming vinegar-taste from your usual chill soup. The yogurt and berries worked well and made the whole dish super appetizing. Trout: this simple dish was delicious.

3.0,8/6/2017,"Overall, a very underwhelming experience. I went for a Tuesday restaurant week dinner. I keep wondering if the food was sub-par because it was for Restaurant Week, but that really should not be the case. Although it's a small discount of the original price, the prix fixe menu is still a significant cost. The service was fine, and although the atmosphere has something to be desired, it didn't affect me that much. I knew what I was getting into. If the original Jean Georges was Nordstrom, Nougatine would be the Nordstrom Rack. Still, I was expecting a great, if not exceptional, culinary experience. I am no picky eater, and most dishes satisfy me. Especially if I'm paying a hefty price for it. But the dishes here were... just okay. Borderline satisfying. To start off, the bread and butter were alright. I could get a better bread basket at my local diner, but hey, a bread basket is no way to measure the quality of a restaurant.Then the salad came. Honestly, the one main reason I chose to have the salad was because it listed avocado has being one of its ingredients. One of my friends also got the salad, with a small piece of avocado. Mine had zero. I would think that a restaurant like this would at least be consistent with its dishes. And although I enjoyed the sour vinaigrette dressing, if a person with normal taste buds (aka does not eat lemons for fun) tried it, it might have been way too strong. Finally, my entree. I got the organic chicken. Now, I'm always wary of ordering chicken at restaurants, since it can often come out dry. First bite, I was impressed. Halfway through, it was dry. If I was at any other diner or restaurant, I wouldn't really be surprised. But honestly, I wanted to hold Nougatine to a higher standard. Finally, we finished off with a dessert which was also okay. Overall, a very ""okay"" dinner experience. But if I'm paying a hefty price for it, okay is simply not good enough. I would much prefer to spend my money elsewhere.

It was a nice riff on strawberries and cream.Service was attentive albeit a little cold.

And then deliver the food to the wrong people and then look offended when you start switching plates around so each person has their respective order in front of them. The food was definitely good, but nothing to really write home about. If you're at a place with such high esteem, you'd expect food you'd want to tell everyone about.

3.0,7/25/2017,"Very disappointed about our experience here today (2.8/5.0).We came for a late lunch (Restaurant Week lunch prix fixe). The staff were not welcoming at all. They didn't have smiles on their faces, or am I asking for too much? This is a well reputed restaurant and the staff were just cold to their guests!After we were seated, we waited for like 5 mins until they gave us menu. Another 5 mins between first and second course (2-3 mins is reasonable, in my opinion). No water refill and didn't check on us while eating until they came to clean up plates. They did ask if we want more bread, once. The butter stayed on the table even after we finished the bread (which is fine, I'm just being picky here). The food was mediocre. The appetizer soup was sorta salty, and my friend's salad was nothing but a plate of sad vegetables. We can even make a better salad at home. The main course, flounder on a bed of corn pudding, was delicious overall, but the corn pudding was way too salty, and the fish was pan-fried in too much oil. The best part was the chocolate cake and caramel ice cream, which was not overly sweet.Because of all the hypes and popularity, I had a high expectation.

3.0,7/23/2017,Went here for lunch. I guess I was expecting more based off all the reviews. To start: The cucumber martini was amazing which I got at the bar and thank goodness because it took 20 minutes for our waiter to take a drink or food order. We never received bread although everyone around us did. We asked once our appetizers came out for bread which they eventually brought. The tuna tartare appetizer was very good. I would go back just for that. However my black bass and potato purée was lukewarm and nothing spectacular. It was too salty for my taste as well. My daughter had the calamari appetizer which was just okay. The calamari at Yolo in Fort Lauderdale blows this away. Maybe we chose poorly on our dishes.

3.0,6/2/2017,"Caveat: I am devoting the first paragraph of this review to address the faults in the service. The question: How do you manage a 3 course meal so that you don't rush the guests but also don't draw it out too long? Answer: TBD - as Nougatine still has to work out the kinks. My colleagues and I dined here today to a rather shocking 2 hours and 10 minutes lunch (from when I sat down, not when I left the office), not necessarily due to flowing conversation, but because there was literally a lull of 20-30 minutes gap between each course. I understand that this is not the original Jean-Georges, but I am (and was) quite surprised that service could be so slow given the namesake. Nougatine shouldn't be second-place to Jean-Georges. but It should still offer a spectacular, but different, experience to its patrons. Where they really dropped the ball was the dessert course. We all ordered coffees alongside our dessert, but the coffees came out halfway through our dessert course, which I thought was a strange and disruptive to the flow of the dessert course. Additionally, this was the ONLY time in my dining experience where the restaurant did not call or email me prior to confirm my reservation (but they do take your credit information to make the actual reservation itself for a big party). The food was solid. I ordered the warm beet salad, roasted hake, and Jean-Georges Warm Chocolate Cake. The beet salad was sweet and bright, with delicious pieces of hazelnut folded into rich yogurt sauce. I wished for a more flavorful (spicier?) kick, as the sweet beets against the rich yogurt was rather one note and I didn't feel that the beets were elevated in any way. The roasted hake was buttery tender with a beautiful crust with equally tender and flavorful pea shoots. The Jean-Georges Warm Chocolate Cake was good, with oozing chocolate and depth of flavor in the vanilla ice cream.Given how solid the food was, I debated rounding up to 4 stars. However, I cannot really justify the slow service, especially given that this is a highly esteemed restaurant.",5,1,3,Jenny P.,"Arlington, VA",231,723,753
5.0,5/30/2017,"without hesitation, this is definitely one of my personal favorite restaurants in the tri state area. not just because the food is exquisite, but because the service is outstanding to boot. my review is somewhat overdue, as i haven't been since last summer, but i figured i would add my two cents. my fiancé and his father and fathers girlfriend dined here for dinner on a weekday night. the place was pleasantly full without being stuffy because the layout is spacious and comfortable. i cannot remember our waitresses name but she was extremely helpful and friendly, as i'm sure all of the wait staff here are. i can't recall all the appetizers we had but i do remember the artichoke and it was DE-LISH! hard to mess up, but really fantastic when done right and this was just that. for my entree i ordered the salmon. now, i informed our waitress of my (severe) dairy and egg allergies, and our food was taking quite a while to come out. she then came by and informed us that she saw the entrees were ready for the table but that she didn't think that the salmon ended up being dairy and egg free. this was confusing to me for such a high end restaurant, but she handled it with extreme professionalism. she told us that the chef was preparing a new salmon dish that would be dairy and egg free and that she would bring all the entrees out together. this upset my fiancés father, only because he is elderly and very demanding. in the meantime we enjoyed wine and conversation and to our surprise she brought out a complimentary plate of INCREDIBLE grilled watermelon which was deeply appreciated. our entrees eventually came out and i'm sure you can guess those were equally as divine. my fiancé had the prosciutto wrapped pork chop which he said was to die for. on top of our dinner thus far being excellent, the waitress was nice enough to bring me a complimentary sorbet and fruit dish for dessert. as if things couldn't have been any better, they also took care of my meal. i have had so many mishaps in regards to my allergies when dining out and a restaurant comping my meal is usually something i never expect nor receive. this was truly a matter of great moral and professionalism on the restaurants behalf. nougatine is truly the definition of great food and GREAT hospitality that is worth every single penny you'll spend here. we had a wonderful and memorable meal that i can't help but think about almost weekly.",1,0,0,Michelle M.,"Brooklyn, NY",26,99,64

Due to circumstance we couldn't splurge on the tasting menu but enjoyed a few of the dishes. We began our meal by ordering the Peekytoe Crab cake. An amuse of truffle and cheese croquettes with an airy horseradish foam was a wonderful way to start the meal. With quick timing the crab cake arrived.It was pretty standard, but the accompanying snap pea remoulade was sublime. Hints of garlic broke the richness of the crab nicely. I find many restaurants crab cakes tend to hit a wall and this was no different besides the snap pea. Main courses included a prosciutto wrapped pork chop. Accompanied by a wild mushroom sage sauce it was well seasoned and delicious. I had the beef tenderloin and although it was cooked more rare than I would prefer the quality of the meat made up for this completely. I must have repeated it was the best tenderloin I've had three times. Accompanied by a soy mushroom reduction and crispy potatoes that had a subtle lick of heat from birds eye chilies.We were able to have room for Jean Georges' warm molten chocolate cake and loved every bite of it.

I did not find the entrée choices terribly exciting and ended up picking the seared wild hake with maple-celeriac puree and pink-peppercorn vinaigrette. As for dessert, it was either Jean-Georges' warm chocolate cake with vanilla bean ice cream or a citrus pavlova. Went with the former - it was VERY decadent but because it was so rich and a tad bit sweet for me, I only managed to finish half! My friend who had a sweet tooth and loves chocolate finished this effortlessly though. :)Overall, the lunch prix fixe offers a great deal - it is very affordable at only $38 for an appetizer, entrée and dessert.

My wife and I came for brunch on time and we were asked to wait at the bar even though the restaurant was basically empty. No big deal, my issue was when the table was ready the staff told us they would bring our drinks to the table. This did not happen. After 10 minutes, I asked for our drinks and they arrived. Onto the food, our brunch was prepared well but I was served food without silverware. They never reset the table after bread and butter was served. The servers did not notice and I had to ask for silverware 5 minutes after our food arrived.

I made reservations for this restaurant on Valentines Day and was disappointed. When we arrived, we had to wait for a table (despite making reservations more than two weeks in advance)  and our waiter did not even tell us where we should wait... Okay. The food was just OKAY and could have had more flavor.... Our drinks were mediocre and watered down (I had Spanish wine which was good but not great ). Furthermore, the service here was below mediocre. Our waiter could have been more attentive, but he was not. I get that this restaurant was super busy, but this is NYC and a high end restaurant...Good service goes a long way !The only reason why I am giving this restaurant four stars instead of three is because the chef Jean- George was Extremely friendly and took photos with us (thanks again !!!!!).

I had the sashimi for my appetizer, it was just delicious. very clean flavors and the right size. it was also very pretty to look at. I then had the parmesan chicken which was just so good. It was a great portion and had a great sauce as well. Finally, I had the chocolate lava cake that just melted. It was so good and the salted caramel ice cream was just the right amount of saltiness to cut through the richness of the cake. They then gave us an extra dessert because they slightly mixed up our order, but wasn't a huge deal at all, they fixed their mistake in 2 minutes and brought us a wonderful extra dessert. Was really treated very well by the entire staff, was very impressed and pleased with my experience here.

4.0,2/8/2017,"Once again, overthinking a restaurant is a terrible thing.Lemme ask you, when traveling by plane and walk thru First Class seating, are you upset that you're not getting the bigger seats and upscale meal? Or do you just walk thru and say, good luck suckas, enjoy that expensive up charge? If you're like me, I don't care. The difference between Nougatine at Jean-Georges & Jean-Georges is like First Class seating. Same wait staff, same chefs, same food. Its the same at Le Cirque. I don't like to wait and stand around. When I arrive, it's on. There's seating available in Nougatine at Jean-Georges? Cool. It's my wife's birthday in January. Without fail, when I plan something for her, the weather will muck up our plans. Not to fear, I rescheduled on a beautiful Sunday and made our brunch reservation work. We arrive and the front desk says my name properly. Man, kudos to you! They take our coats and seated not to far from the open kitchen. Don't like the open kitchen? Make a reservation for Jean-Georges. We're given brunch menus. The price fixe is calling me because of the warm, flourless chocolate cake with salted caramel ice cream.My wife always ordered better than me! She starts with a beet salad mixed with Gorgonzola. The beets were so sweet, very nice choice. I ordered the calamari starter. Cooked very well, it was a nice starter for me (I wanted the beets after tasting hers)She ordered a fish dish, another perfectly executed dish. The skin was crispy and the meat was buttery, Mmm mm, amazing.I ordered a lobster burger. It was a thick patty of lobster chucks and fillers, a very tasty treat. On a supermarket, sesame seeded bun? What the what?! Yep, the bun was straight from the bag. That will get you a start knocked off. Sorry Jean-Georges.Our desserts come out, we both ordered the warm, flourless chocolate cake with salted caramel ice cream. I poke at the cake and chocolate oozes out. OMG, this dish was so sinful. Simply an amazing ending. Our waiter was all over us, how is everything, is there anything I can do while I'm here? A total professional. There's a dude holding the door! Your job, if you choose to accept it is to hold the door for the guests. The front desk? Welcoming from start to finish. Want a great brunch experience in NYC?

2.0,2/7/2017,"My wife and I came here for lunch during a weekday on a rare day out together. We were excited for our day and Nougatine was the starting point.When we stepped through the door, we were greeted with one of those fake smiling, I'm too good to work here and you're not good enough to eat here hostess. To add to that, their system of checking people in and checking coats was a bit confusing. She took our name and asked us to stand to the side until our name was called. But we were never informed if we could check our coats. We had to figure it out for ourselves that the coat check was off to the right. Be aware that Nougatine and Jean-Georges share the same hostess table. It was a bit weird to see so many people standing there waiting to be seated when Jean-Georges is such a high class restaurant. I'm sure everyone had reservations.After about 10-15 minutes past our reservation time, we were seated. The restaurant is connected to Jean-Georges, so if you have some kind of inferiority complex, this is not the restaurant for you. But the food comes from the kitchen and a lot of the same dishes are served in both restaurants.We had the pre-fixe and I ordered the shrimp salad for appetizer, lobster burger for entree, and chocolate cake for dessert. Shrimp salad was fine, salad was just a salad, nothing special. Not much shrimp on it, which was expected. The lobster burger was good, but again, nothing special. I've never had a lobster burger before (I think) but it pretty much tasted like a crab cake, except with lobster instead of crab, stuck between two pieces of bread. Eh. The best part was the chocolate cake. It was delicious and the ice cream paired well with it.Overall food was ok, but not worth the price.

5.0,1/22/2017,"My daughter who lives in New York really likes Nougatine.  She recommended Nougatine at Jean-Georges to celebrate her sister / my younger daughter's birthday this year.  My younger daughter lives in L.A. as do my husband and I, and we flew 3,000 miles from home to do this.  I'm so glad we did.  What a delightful experience.  The food was excellent, and we wanted for nothing.  Our waiter was excellent, and while not at all overbearing, he was there to wait on our every need.  While we all had the dinner tasting menu, he very kindly offered us substitutions for the things we either didn't like (foie gras) or didn't eat (I don't eat pork).  Instead of the foie gras, we all substituted that for their shrimp salad, and instead of the pork, I had the black sea bass instead.  There was so much food, such large portions of each course, and it was all delicious.  Flavor and freshness was top notch....esp. the flavor.We started with an amuse bouche of I don't know what.  I never quite heard what the waiter said, and I even asked him to repeat it, but it was FABULOUS...... I just don't know what it was (sorry).  It was like a crab cake (and maybe it was) with some kind of creamy sauce.  All I can say with certainty is that it was delicious, and I wanted more than the one.We then moved on to the Tuna Tartare, which had avocado, spicy radish, in a ginger marinade.  There was something like pureed tomato in the sauce, at least I thought so.  All I know is that it was so wonderful.  I loved the refreshing, yet bold flavors.  I'm not usually a ginger fan, but it was not overpowering, and we all devoured this dish.Next, instead of foie gras, we were offered the substitution of a shrimp salad.  My daughter kept raving about their shrimp salad.  I have to say, it was THE BEST I've ever had.  The dressing, some kind of champagne vinegar dressing just hit this dish out of the ballpark.  It was creamy but not heavy, just so delicious.  The shrimp was on a bed of lettuce with avocado and tomato.  Perfection. Truly.The next dish was a Sesame Crusted Salmon that was served with sautéed potatoes, black olive, spinach and passion fruit.  I honestly don't recall tasting any passion fruit, but once again, whatever I ate, was so flavorful.  You know, now that I think back, the sauce had a sweetness to it, so I'm wondering if the passion fruit was pureed into the sauce.  I don't really know...... it just tasted excellent.  The salmon was, of course, perfectly cooked, and I'd expect nothing less from a restaurant of this caliber.While everyone else at our table ate the Niman Ranch pork chop with bacon, apple compote, and cauliflower (and loved it), I was given Black Bass in a habanero-lime sauce with roasted Brussels sprouts.  The Brussels sprouts were the tiniest I've ever seen, and they were sooooo good........ one would think something that small would have no flavor, but they were soooo delish.  However, my fish (Black bass) was sooooooooooooooooooo salty; I think a mistake was made, and someone salted it too much.  The waiter very graciously wanted to have another piece prepared for me, but I told him no way.  I was really full, and there was no point (esp. since I wouldn't be eating it at any other time).  I truly was fine without it.  He was so apologetic. For dessert, we received the following:Citrus Pavlova with Blood Orange Sorbet and Candied CumquatsButterscotch Pudding with Crème Fraîche, Sea Salt & CaramelJean Georges' Warm Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, Chocolate ShortbreadFor me, it's a tie what was my favorite...... either the citrus pavlova, so different, refreshing and lovely........ or the butterscotch pudding.  Such different flavors, but I STILL can't make up my mind...... just sooooooooo good.  Sure the chocolate cake was fabulous, but the other two items had such unique flavors.If this is a far more casual version of Jean-Georges, I can't wait to see what that restaurant (in the very next room) has to offer.  I just need to win the lottery for that one.  We'll be back, though.  I loved Nougatine.  My only bug-a-boo about this place is that its location is in the Trump International Tower.  Sure, a GREAT location....... and yet, NOT.  Consider the source.  Boooooooooo.  Okay, enough about that.  Try Nougatine.  Truly delightful.",9,7,7,Claudia B.,"Simi Valley, CA",1144,1299,6819

I was concerned that someone else would have the same experience hence the food must be checked.  The Manager assured me that the food was checked and checked out. Sure! One can't help but wonder how THIS WAS DONE?!?? The Manager then invited us to return to Nougatine and offering free drinks plus.... BUT my goodness, neither my husband or I had zero interest of returning to Nougatine. EVER! FYI...

5.0,1/3/2017,"My very good friend took me to lunch at Nougatine at Jean-Georges for my birthday. Yes she's a very good friend. We decided to share two appetizers and two entrees. I ordered the Burrata (Poached Mission Fig Vinaigrette and Arugula) and she ordered the Crab Cake (black pepper, Asian Pear, and Endive.) We each ate half then switched plates. The Buratta was amazing. It was soft on the inside and the fig vinaigrette gave it just the right amount of acid and sweetness. The best component of the crab cake plate was the black pepper sauce that sat next to it. It packed a sweet and peppery punch. For the entrees I ordered the Spaghetti (with Brussels Sprouts and Pistachio Pesto) and my friend ordered the Veal Milanese (with Parmesan, Escarole, and Lemon.) The Spaghetti was DELICIOUS. This was by far my favorite of the four dishes. The spaghetti was al dente, the Brussels sprouts were perfectly cooked, and the pistachio pesto was everything I wanted and more. It was so flavorful. If they sold this in a jar I'd line up to buy it. The Veal Milanese was great too but the spaghetti was the daily winner for me! Wow, what a great restaurant. The service was impeccable.

5.0,12/24/2016,"The name threw me off. I've only eaten at Jean-Georges (which is connected to this one) and not Nougatine. But that's not all of it. The girlfriend who made the reservation forwarded me the open table reservation and it says One Central Park West. I am on Central Park South. It's a 5 minute walk. How could things go wrong? Well? The Jean-Georges I ate at is of the same address. I was therefore confused, for one. For two, it shares the same address as the Trump Tower, and let me be clear, it's actually part of the Trump Tower, and being that I'm from the liberal land of San Francisco bay Area, imagine my surprise when I realized 1 Central Park West is synonymous to Trump Tower, but no one wants to just tell me that. Geez. That was a lot of work and unnecessary stress because those machine gun carrying police was not there to guard that building but the Christmas Market which is across from the restaurant. Berlin Christmas Market ripple effect. But I persevered. Everyone knows that I'm not there to see Trump. I'm there to eat. Which is exactly what I told to the lobby guard and they sent me left through the glass door.Once inside,  life was wonderful once again. You cannot go wrong with any JGs. Prix Fixe is a steal at $38. Appetizer, Entree and dessert. Note JG is a three Michelin. A three Michelin means $1400 for two in the Bay Area after wine pairing. My girlfriend ordered off the regular menu and her dishes were bigger but that's to be expected. I think the prix fixe was quite generous in size. I had the tuna tartare and hake. Both were work of art with amazing taste and presentation. Perfect in fact. I then shared the gluten free dessert with my girlfriend as I stole bunch of the mushroom off her steak plate which was the best mushroom I had ever had in my life. I think I need to learn to make mushroom that way. I've eaten at too many Michelin 3, 2 and 1 star places in New York, the most approachable place to me remains to JGs. Not only the service is impeccable, but also they understood their customers. My girlfriend is gluten free and when she said no to delicious bread they immediately offered her gluten free bread. See, not everything affiliated with Trump is bad, this restaurant breathes a sense of relief to fellow San Franciscans travelers. It certainly is a fail safe for me.

4.0,12/12/2016,"Nougatine is a great spot for lunch, brunch, or a casual dinner. Note that the restaurant is located inside Trump tower. Anyone working at the Trump tower will be able to point to you the correct location, so go inside and ask if you are lost.Nougatine were very accommodating as I had notified them 30 minutes prior to our reservation time that my friend was going to arrive 25 minutes late. After 20 minutes, they release the table to people without a reservation. Once my friend arrived, we were ushered to a table- only for the lovely concierge to apologize as the table had yet to be cleaned. Seems like there is some disconnect in communication between the front desk and the waiters inside. We waited approximately 10 minutes for them to clear a table. There is not much waiting space, there were groups of people huddled around the door and the bar area sticking out like a sore thumb.~ Food, Prix Fixe Lunch MenuThe bread and butter that is served is decent. Wish it was served warm...For appetizers, we ordered:- Tuna Tartare: Presented beautifully with sliced radishes, it looked like lotus flower. The ginger marinade was very flavorful, but I can see why people would complain about the marinade. It can be very overwhelming if you are not used that taste- I love Japanese cuisine and everything ginger so the tuna tartare really hit the spot.- Fried Calamari: The dip was whipped and airy, and the warm calamari was delicious.Main:- Seared Wild Hake (maple-celeriac puree, pink-peppercorn vinaigrette): Out of the three entrees we chose, the hake was the best dish. However, if you are hungry, the Black Bass would be the better dish to order if you want seafood.- Black Bass (habanero-lime sauce, roasted brussels sprouts): The brussels sprouts were tender and flavorful, and the bass was incredibly meaty. Probably the best seafood portion on Nougatine's menu.- Lobster Burger (gruyere, green chili mayonnaise, yuzu pickles): Came with these thin fries- the fries were delicious. Personally, the lobster burger tasted a bit like it was mixed with salmon. It tasted extremely ""fishy"" and in a very bad way. Unpleasant and not recommended.Dessert:- Cranberry Pavlova: The cranberry sorbet was too tart for me. I am sure that during other seasons, the pavlova is delicious but the cranberry was almost offensive. The pavlova part was delicious, with the soft marshmallow base and a crispy meringue crust. My friend liked it though, everyone's different so try it out if you want to try something new!- Jean-Georges Warm Chocolate Cake:Delicious and a safe choice, the warm chocolate cake and indeed, very warm, and oozes chocolate. Mix the vanilla ice cream with the chocolate cake to get the hot and cold sensation.~ ServiceThe waiters were incredibly helpful and kind. Waters were replenished quickly, as was bread when I asked for more. We did not feel rushed, and one waiter even took a picture of us and our lunch!~ ThoughtsNougatine is worth it for the prix fixe lunch, very good value. Don't get confused or expect the same level of service and food as Jean-Georges. Nougatine is NOT the one who has 3 Michelin stars or five stars from every single publication ever, and people who expect that from the more casual Nougatine will be severely disappointed and frankly, are misinformed.

I was sad that mine was overlooked then towards the end realized they had given the medium rare to my boyfriend who didn't notice. They offered to send out a new steak but I didn't want to wait around since we were almost done. We went with apple pie for desert. It was good but mostly just crust. The waitress was nice but we were surprised at how fast everything came out- 4 courses with wine in less than an hour. Each course came out before we even finished the previous.

3.0,11/26/2016,"I have very mixed feelings about Nougatine. The hubby and I are long time fans of Jean-George restaurants  and know that some are definitely better than others.   This restaurant gave the appearance of being helpful and accommodating, but were they really? That is where I have mixed feelings.We arrived on time for our reservation and were promptly shown to our table in the front of the restaurant. Right in the mid-day sun. After sitting in my seat for 5 minutes, I asked the server if the shade can be pulled down further as it was at least 90 degrees in the sun. I was told that the shade could go no lower. After another few minutes, sweat dripping down my face, I asked for a different table. The maitre d told me that we can sit at a table across from us, out of the sun but we would have to be done with our meal by 1:15 (at that moment, it was 12:20). Seriously? You are giving me less than an hour to eat lunch at a 5 star restaurant? It's not like we walked in without a reservation, quite the contrary. I told her that was unacceptable. She stepped away and whispered something to another server, I can only imagine what she said. I would expect this at an Applebees, but not from a Jean-George restaurant. She returned a few minutes later, offering us a table in the back of the restaurant which we accepted.The service after this snafu was fairly good, although the servers were circling the table next to us like sharks because the 2 women were eating very slowly. Twice they tried to take away one of the women's plate while she was still eating - again not acceptable at a Jean-George establishment. We had:- Tuna Tartare - delicious- Shrimp Salad - very good- Amish Chicken - delicious- Black Bass - very good- Pavlova - tasty- Chocolate Cake - very goodHonestly, this would have been a 4 star review if the service was up to par.

The salad was so unspectacular, I could have bought something similar at the Whole Foods across the street. The tuna tartare was pretty good but nothing to brag about. The chicken was the worst - horribly bland and dry. It was also served on a very oddly shaped circular tray that was awkward to rest my utensils on.

Our waitress clearly had no interest in assisting our table and missed out on so many opportunities to serve us (I would have liked to order more food and wine!) Maybe because she knew we were there for restaurant week? Who knows.

We tried the pre-fixed lunch menu, which was reasonably priced and delicious.

4.0,9/13/2016,"Nougatine was delicious, a really wonderful lunch. I will say that nothing was the most delicious thing I ever had and I don't know if I'd come back for anything, but it was still a fantastic meal. I started with the tomato gazpacho and my boyfriend had the shrimp salad. I think the shrimp salad was better, just much brighter flavors and a wonderful dressing. The gazpacho was pretty one-note and I could not finish it. For entrees, I had the salmon and my boyfriend had the chicken. I think the salmon was so great, perfectly cooked. However, the potato puree and sauce seemed unnecessary on the plate. The sauce overpowered everything when combined, so I didn't love that, especially since I love potatoes just by themselves a lot of the time (and the potato puree was good by itself!). My boyfriend's chicken was a little crispy for me, but it was also good.Then, for dessert, I had the pavlova and my boyfriend had the chocolate cake and ice cream. I thought the pavlova was excellent. There was great fresh fruit and all of the flavors were so light and enjoyable. We ended up only trading bites on this dish because we both enjoyed our own so much.This was also a cheaper option than eating at Jean-Georges and also the cheapest experience we found eating at the lounges/salons/bars/patios of the 3-Star restaurants. The outside deck is very pleasant and hidden from the street, so it feels like you're in a great garden when you're really right on Columbus Circle!",2,0,0,Paige K.,"Washington, DC",586,174,5
3.0,9/5/2016,"Still solid for lunch, but service standards have VERY noticeably slipped: server gave us the wrong plates for both appetizer and main course and had to be corrected.  Once, this correction was met with a rude click of the tongue.  When I said that I would ""get back"" to the server with my dessert choice, he snapped that ""it is really only two options to choose from"" and forced me to make a selection (I went with the berry pavlova).  I was quite shocked.Additional service lapses: waters were left unfilled until requested; no second helping of bread was offered until asked.  On the other hand, the watermelon and goat cheese salad was lovely: a perfect mix of savory and sweet.  Meanwhile, the shrimp salad with avocado, tomato, and champagne-vinegar dressing was good, too.I would pass on the rigatoni with meatballs and smoked pepper-tomato ragu as it was nothing special.  I would instead get the Veal Milanese with tomato-arugula salad and red wine vinaigrette.  Finally, as I alluded to earlier, dessert was between the JG warm chocolate cake with vanilla bean ice cream and the mixed berry pavlova with strawberry sorbet and whipped fromage blanc.  The pavlova was clearly the superior choice here.Overall, RECOMMENDED, though service issues really do need to be addressed.  This is supposed to be a 5-star establishment, after all.",1,0,0,Mickey M.,"New York, NY",0,192,0

3.0,8/24/2016,I want to like this place but there are a few negatives on my list about it.1. It's in trump tower.2. The clientele are sometimes pretentious.The food is decent. I mean I enjoyed what they sent me but it felt like dressed up food that I definitely paid a few extra dollars for. The calamari is good but I can get similar calamari for the same price point and more comes on the plate. I had a giant bowl of whipped sauce for the small amount of calamari they gave me. It was slightly confusing to dip these little calamari pieces in a soup bowl worth of sauce. I almost thought perhaps I should drink it like soup but they didn't give me a spoon.This is a dining for the dollar experience though where less is more and it's about quality.I had the beef tenderloin dish which was plated on a sauce that seemed like a tomato onion infusion. The beef was cooked well. There were crispy almost fritter like potatoes in the mix.The dessert is pretty good. The chocolate ginger cake is better than the peaches and pistachio ice cream but both taste very fresh.Overall the place is A-OK.

5.0,8/17/2016,"We came for restaurant week and was lucky to be seated by the open kitchen when Jean Georges himself was attending to our dinner.  The food was slower than desired, but the food was delicious and the portions were great.  The only complaint is the hostess can be nicer and more attentive, she left us just hanging there for a good 6 minutes before she seated us and didn't mention a word as to if we should wait or just go through the glass doors.  With our food, we went with the restaurant week pre-fixe.  Naturally, the summer soups are not something familiar to my Asian palate, but it was delicious.  But their entree's and dessert just hit the spot.  The chicken is really juicy and generously portioned and the salmon was cooked just right, not too raw and not over-cooked.  We didn't order wine as we dined on a Monday night, but of the four, one of us ordered white wine, and he didn't like his drink.  The waiter was super nice about it and offered him a different glass of white wine.  And last but not least Jean Georges came over to take a picture with us when we asked the waiter to take our group photo.  Thank you Jean Georges!",0,0,0,Minji C.,"New York, NY",0,8,0

5.0,8/11/2016,"I dined here after obsessively checking for reservations the two weeks they had restaurant week and I must say I was impressed with about half the menu. I recommend for restaurant week, if you're going with one other person, get one of everything to have a little variety and share; its always more fun that way and you get to try new things :) The service was good, even though it was a little busy. Server knew exactly what she was talking about which is something I always appreciate. As for my prix fixe restaurant week, dinner for two, i had...A P P E T I Z E R S+ SUCRENE SALAD with avocado, tomato and spicy corn vinaigrette. It was meh compared to the rest of the menu. + SPICY TUNA, black olive, cucumber. This was my favorte app, and its pretty much a tuna tartare, but spicy. If you're a sushi fan, GET THIS. E N T R E E + CRUNCHY ORGANIC CHICKEN with glazed market carrots, soy syrup. This dish was a little less than impressive for me considering my expectations for this restaurant. The breast was a little dry, but the thigh was juicy so the dish was partially salvaged. Veggies were good but nothing to go crazy about. + SAUTÉED HAKE with fresh corn pudding, marinated cherry tomato. This dish was fantastic, super balanced with the lightness of the fish, creamy corn pudding and acidity of the tomato. I was SO impressed with the corn pudding, it sounds weird with fish but its an amazing combo I didnt even know existed til now. This was my fav of the two. D E S S E R T + Mixed market BERRY PALOVA with whipped fromage blanc and starwberry sorbet. This was very fruity and sweet. Loved the freshness of the sorbet and it comes with fresh fruit so it was a nice finish to out meal. This dish was good, but not as impressive. + Jean Georges Warm CHOCOLATE CAKE with VANILLA BEAN ICE CREAM. OH MY GAWWDDDD. IF YOU ONLY HAVE ONE TAKE AWAY FROM THIS REVIEW, LET IT BE THIS...this lava cake is hands down one of the best desserts I've had IN MY LIFE. I am a HUUGE fan of lava cake (the green tea one at Spot dessert bar was my fav before this), but this....this one is a GAME CHANGER. IT IS THE MOST PERFECT LAVA CAKE EVER. Not too sweet and the perfect consistency; the vanilla bean was the best complement to the dish too. I could eat this ALL DAY. Will be raving about this signature dessert for the rest of my life and WILL be back for it.ALL IN ALL...I would've honestly given this place a 3 or 4/5 stars if it wasn't for the lava cake. Only half of the menu really blew me out of the water, but the lava cake has changed my life.....so it has to be a 5/5. Clearlyyy, will be back :3",1,1,0,Grace S.,"Brooklyn, NY",530,120,187

First of all, the ambiance of the restaurant is so elegant and serene, making you feel comfortable dining and wining there all day long. Making a reservation in advance is highly recommended if you are trying to make your way to splurge in what the restaurant has to offer during restaurant month. To start off the $42 prix dinner during restaurant week was the Arugula salad, I ordered salmon for the entree and hot chocolate cake as dessert. I need to scream out how good the salmon tasted because of its tender texture (medium rare) and special mixed coconut sauce complementing it. Hands down one of the best salmon dishes I've ever had at a restaurant!!! Salad was fresh and flavorful just as expected.

Appetizer: a nice tuna tartare. I asked the server for an extra piece of bread to eat with it; he said ""Of course!""...then never returned with the bread. Entree: I'd planned to order the hamburger; I'm a fan of the burger at JG's Inn at Pound Ridge. But our ""helpful"" waitress pushed the lobster and shrimp burger, so much so that my husband was persuaded to order it as well. What emerged from the kitchen was a flabby, mealy disc that texture-wise was a cross between a Whoopie Cushion and old sneaker bottoms, and taste-wise brought to mind a hamper in which too many damp towels were allowed to sit. I had three small bites and couldn't bear to finish the rest, though I was hungry. I would have sent it back, but no waitstaff came around to inquire if we all liked our food. My husband hated the dish too, but had had no lunch, so just ""ingested"" it to ease his ravenous appetite. When our waitress finally reappeared as our plates were being cleared--gee, thanks for showing up!--she didn't show any concern about my obviously all-but-untouched meal.

It's interesting that every item we ordered turned out to be foods that other neighborhood restaurants do much better. I had split pea soup that was pretty good vs. the same at Bar Boulud which is outstanding. My wife's pricey hamburger was fair vs. The Smith's which is superb. I'll leave it at that.

5.0,6/23/2016,I've been coming here for almost 10 years. It's still an impeccable lunch. And at $38 is a steal for the quality and quantity. The shrimp salad was very good and buttery. The hake was delicate and had a nice kick to it with the ginger. The legendary chocolate lava cake is still fantastic. Service is impeccable. Beautiful space. Try and sit by the Windows.,0,0,0,J.

Everything was superb. I can't even remember everything I ate. The only thing I didn't like was the quail entree. It was a little bit too rare but the deserts are very tasty. The service was phenomenal. Nothing like synchronized service LOL.... Overall I will recommend it and its a once in a while splurge.,0,0,0,Simone G.,"Fort Lee, NJ",0,30,7
4.0,6/13/2016,"You enter both Nougatine at Jean Georges and the regular Jean Georges at the same entrance (located right inside the very hard to miss Trump Towers...), so don't be confused if you think you're accidentally walking into the Michelin 3-star restaurant rather than the more casual one for lunch. Both share the same drinks menu and the same kitchen, so this is a great option if you're looking to experience the world of Jean Georges without breaking the wallet. The ambiance was great. We were seated in the outdoor patio area, which could not have been more perfect for a 80-degree sunny Sunday. The tables are spacious, and the space between each table was ample. At no point did I feel overcrowded.Our group of 4 all chose to do the 3-course prie fixe for $38. After listening to the waiter's enthusiastic recommendations, I decided to go with the shrimp and avocado appetizer, the seared sea bass with tomato sauce for my main, and the strawberry pavlova for my dessert. Albeit a bit simple (so simple that I think I could whip this up at home), I thought the shrimp and avocado salad appetizer and the sea bass entree were both delicious. The dishes were light and refreshing, and the ingredients were very fresh. My sea bass was the perfect level of tenderness. If you like heavy flavors, these are probably not the right dishes to order, but if you like ingredients that speak for themselves without needing to hide behind a ton of spice, this is great. On the other hand, I completely regretted ordering the strawberry pavlova. It was far too sweet for my taste. I happily ate the strawberry and sorbet on the side but almost cringed at the taste of cream. Though the pavlova was disappointing, I luckily did get bites of the warm chocolate lava cake, which is by far the much better option, so definitely order that for your dessert!Because of the simple nature of the food here, I don't really see this as a place I would die to go back to. However, if I am ever looking for a place to bring parents or older folks to for a wholesome lunch with a nice ambiance, Nougatine would definitely be on the list.",0,0,0,Cindy G.,"New York, NY",916,401,423

4.0,6/11/2016,"I would say probably closer to 4.5 stars. Some of the dishes are out of this world. The sweat pea soup with croutons is amazing! What bright, fresh, verdant flavor. Yes...you can literally taste the green. Shrimp salad is also solid, but a little over dressed. Shrimp was cooked perfectly, delicate and warm.For mains, the slow cooked salmon is off the hook good. It must have been sous-vide, it literally dissolves in your mouth. It's amazing and maybe the best salmon i've ever had. The pork chop though was a bit of a disappointment. Surprisingly it was bland and really nothing special about it at all and for a $38 pork chop with some mustard greens and BBQ sauce, I expected something pretty outrageously good. BBQ sauce was nicely flavored, but even the mustard greens had some very woody stems that i couldn't chew. So definitely get the salmon, i wished I did.For dessert, the signature warm chocolate cake definitely does not disappoint. The warm peach pie was fantastic as well. A very light crust, served warm all the way through with a little ice cream. The fruit was also fresh, light and sweet. Perfectly cooked.Service is also top notch as you would expect.

4.0,6/5/2016,"Came here recently with a group of 4 to try their lunch prix fixe menu. We had made reservations and we were immediately seated upon arrival. The restaurant is in the Trump Tower. They don't have a big name sign out in front so you can easily miss it.I ordered the shrimp salad, crispy black sea bass, and pavlova for dessert. I was able to try the tuna tartare, cheeseburger, roasted hake, and warm chocolate cake.Overall, my favorite dish was the cheeseburger. The meat was super flavorful. I think they add something to the beef before making it into a patty. The yuzu pickles added a different level of flavor profile that really complemented the other components of the burger. One issue I had was the bun. I thought there were too many sesame seeds and there could have been a better choice in bun used for the dish. Despite that, this is an excellent dish and worth the $38 prix fixe.I thought the tuna tartare and shrimp salad were good but nothing out of the extra ordinary. Everything was fairly spot on. I thought the shrimps were over cooked. They were dishes that work and they are very consistent at making these dishes excellent every time. The hake is definitely a meatier fish than the sea bass. Both were great dishes. There wasn't a fishy taste/smell to them. The skin on the sea bass was crispy and not soggy at all. I thought the cauliflower taste wasn't strong enough and overpowered by the other ingredients. Hats go off to the pastry chef that made the pavlova. It was super soft and light. It was contained in this crispy sugar shell (i don't know the fancy name for it) but everything was in harmony for this dish. The choice of sorbet matched the pavlova and the strawberries were fresh and sweet. To me, I thought this was a more complicated dish to make when compared to the chocolate cake. However, the chocolate cake was amazing as well. The chocolate literally oozed out of the cake once you cut into it. The cake was still warm when they brought it out. The cake was so soft and the chocolate was super rich. I initially the cake would be harder that it looked but boy was I surprised. Both were so delicious.The decor is really nice. The place is spacious with tons of natural sunlight. Everything is ""bright"" inside.Overall, great restaurant, definitely worth coming here for the prix fixe. Both of his restaurants are right next to each other and the food come out from the same kitchen. I just wonder if they have a different chef for the dinner menu. I'll come back here for dinner at Jean Georges to see if it's worth it. My suspicion is that you're getting the same chef that cooks for both restaurants. If that's the case, just go to Nougatine to get excellent food at a lower price point.",0,0,0,Leo O.,"Queens, NY",200,518,1703

Impeccable, classy--yet somehow managing to pull off human and down-to-earth. He's so on top of everyone's every need. Don't know how he does it. In any case, we all decided we'd stay outside until dessert. Our amazing waiter, Geo, took fantastic care of us before handing us off to Nerissa. We didn't spend as much time with Nerissa, although she was so gracious about dessert, but Geo was just awesome and backed up super nicely by Pedro on clean-up. We felt so well-taken-care-of, it just made us so happy. And since we were so slowly enjoying our food, it was really great that no one was pushing us out the door. We ate very, very slowly, savoring everything.Brings me to second, but should be first? The food, the food, wow, the food. I have a gluten/wheat allergy so they replaced Tuna Tartare for me with the shrimp salad. Faint. So good. Next? That amazing, amazing Foie Gras. The sweet of the sauce and the brulee matched up to this food that I normally never ever eat... heaven. Then Salmon that was so perfectly cooked and matched up with broccoli on mashed potatoes... sigh. It wasn't the sesame encrusted, it was something else, but was amazing. Last, the beef tenderloin on asparagus and fern and something spicey... All washed down with Prosecco. When it was cold we moved inside for dessert. My friend wanted me warm chocolate cake so I just took the full tasting. Butterscotch pudding. SIGH. Citrus Pavlova. SIGH. I nibbled at the vanilla ice cream.

However, I thought the food this time was hit or miss.  I had the tuna tartare and the sea bass.  I thought the ginger marinade they pool around the tuna tartare was too salty so I tried to take each bite with as little sauce as possible.  Daughter #2 thought the same.  The sea bass was prepared well but it was not amazing.  Maybe my tastebuds were shot from the too salty ginger marinade of my appetizer?  Daughter #1 had the kale salad which was delicious.  However, she did not like the minty flavor of the spaghetti with asparagus and morel mushrooms.  She felt that the mint should have been included in the menu description and I agree with her, as it is not something you would normally expect in a pasta dish.  My son had the prosciutto wrapped pork chop and even though it was huge, he finished it all.  We also ordered a plate of salumi and cheese for the table and that was quickly devoured by all.  My husband thought his sweet pea soup was really tasty.  We ordered three desserts, the chocolate cake, the butterscotch pudding and the tiramisu.  They were all delicious.  The graduate decided not to order dessert so our waiter presented her with a nice plate of hazelnut chocolates with a congratulatory message which was a thoughtful touch.  We had a great time at dinner and we chatted with our waiter who was from Turkey about how much we love Istanbul.  Dinner with cocktails and a nice bottle of wine for the five of us was over $700.",1,1,0,Lisa L.,Hong Kong,3,15,2

We 1st had a delicious tomato soup in a large shot glass as a palate cleanser. The 1st course was an amazing tuna tartar on chopped avocado with a sesame soy sauce. Second course was fois gras with a grape gelée with baby shiso --- rich, but very yummy. 3rd was a wonderful sesame-crusted salmon that was extraordinary. The final course was a medallion of beef tenderloin with asparagus and other green vegetables in a salsa Verde with lime. The dish was prepared to perfection except the sauce was slightly over seasoned with salt.

1.0,4/4/2016,"My husband & I've had some wonderful dining experiences at amazing restaurants around the world; this however was not one of them.It was my first time in Manhattan & we were very excited to have our first high end dinner at Nougatine. It was highly recommended & we were told on its way to a Michelin star. Everything started off very well, we were welcomed & seated, our server Brian came over & introduced himself quite professionally & we ordered cocktails (both delish) to start. Prior to ordering our meal while talking to Brian he offered to see if there was a table available at Jean Georges, but looking over the menu we decided the options that night at Nougatine were more to our liking.I am a new Sommelier so I was very excited to meet & talk to the Somm on staff to discuss the wine list & get her recommendations for our meal. Hubby had already lovingly informed me that I was having lobster & he wasn't going to take no for an answer, since he knows how much I love it. Tali came over, was professionally friendly, we talked about being Sommeliers & how she was on her way to being a Master which is a huge accomplishment. It made me even more excited to hear her recommendations for pairing our meal. So when I told her what I was ordering & she said, ""You're a Sommelier you should pair it yourself"", I was a little taken back. Of course I could pair my meal to my wine in a general sense but since I'm not familiar with how Chef incorporates the flavors of his dishes (as I'd never tasted his food) or how they were going to pair with the wines on the menu, I was a bit thrown but I decided to play along. I picked 3 options; the Sancerre, Chenin Blanc & Chardonnay, figuring she would  tell me which she thought would best pair w/ my dinner. I told her my thoughts & she was still very cagey about making a recommendation, I finally just asked her if she thought the Sancerre would pair well. She said it would be a fine choice & it was a very good pairing. She (and I) couldn't have been more wrong. Based on her statements we decided to order a bottle ($79) instead of just a glass since hubby was ordering the salmon, we thought it would be a good cross over wine.(it did go well with his meal). Brian came back & we ordered Peekytoe crab salad & pea soup, both very good. We put in our main dish orders; Steamed Lobster w/ Golden Garlic, Ginger, Pea Shoots & Dried Chili and Sesame Crusted Salmon Sautéed Potatoes, Black Olive & Passion Fruit (puree) and Tali brought over the Sancerre which on its own was tasty. The real problems started when our meals finally came out. Both seafood dishes were luke warm to cool & we sent them back to be reheated. When I drank the wine w/ my meal the dish appeared to be really mediocre, tons of ginger w/ a slight bitterness. Initially I thought the wine neither enhanced my dish nor detracted from it, it just was. It wasn't until later that I realized how much that pairing actually really ruined my dish.As we were coming to the end of our meal (I had about 4 bites of lobster left) server Gabe, came by to check on us. We started chatting, he's the same level Somm as I but w/ more experience. Then he said, he'd never have paired that particular lobster dish w/ the Sancerre; the Chenin Blanc was a much better choice. I was shocked! That's the type of guidance I'd expected from Tali. I asked if I could get a taste of the Chenin Blanc to try w/ my dish. When I tried it, what was left of my dish transformed! It went from mediocre to almost magical! I wanted to cry. I wanted to step back in time & order that dish w/ the Chenin Blanc. When I asked where Brian was since he hadn't come back to check on us after we'd gotten our meals, Gabe said Brian was no longer our server, he'd gone into Jean Georges to work & Tali had gone home. No one told us this, nor did anyone come over w/ Gabe to introduce him as our new server. Gabe ended up being the game saver for us that night...he was warm, friendly, enthusiastic & had great recommendations. We weren't planning on having dessert but Gabe was so excited about having us try a dessert wine w/ their Butterscotch Pudding we just couldn't say no. He was right it was delicious. He literally changed the entire tenor of the experience; we called over the manager to tell him what happened during the evening & how Gabe made our night. He listened, apologized, pretty much just tried to placate us, nothing more & we left. Around 2 a.m. it hit, my husband ended up spending most of the night vomiting, with food poisoning! His $200.00 dinner, straight down the toilet-literally. Later that day my hubby stomach still sore & sensitive, called the restaurant to tell the manager, so they could look into why it happened. He was put on hold for around 10 mins before they came back & said the manager would have to call him back. To this day, we haven't heard word one.

5.0,2/24/2016,"Simply aahhhhmazing! Went for my birthday out in the pouring rain and wind just to try this place. It had been on my yelp list for the longest time and getting reservations here was crazy especially for a 6pm. But my friend got one last minute so someone definitely cancelled and I am thankful to whom ever did because it made my birthday so special! When you first walk in there are people at the front desk that greet you and take your coat and purse and then two people open the grand door for you! Such great service right from the start. Now here comes the best part and that was the food, I ordered the tuna tartare which is a must, then the veal milanese and for dessert we had the caramelized apple pie! The tuna tartare was delicious! It was on top of really fresh avocados and the tartness and spice from the ginger soup that they poured in after serving the dish to you complimented so well the the avocado and the tuna tartare and the radish that were neatly placed on top. All the flavors were done with such finesse and just worked well together like a melodyNext was the veal milanese this dish was also tart but in a good way where it mixed well with the cooked cranberries and the thin piece of meat that had a great crispness to it where it was oily at all! Meat thats usually coated with like bread crumbs or other things tends to fry and burn too quickly but this one was cooked and pan fried perfectly with a golden crust and easy to cut. This veal was placed on top of a bed of salad as well  Everytime they served the food they would describe what your eating and I think that added to the experience cause you can understand what your actually tasting which I loved! For dessert since it was my birthday they added a little happy birthday note and gave me a candle and that was thoughtful of the restaurant and this is how you know they take care of their customers and make sure that the experience they have is everlasting and great! They even gave complimentary chocolate truffles and I am usually not a fan of truffles because of the texture but the taste of this truffle just melted in your mouth. I loved it here and definitely will go back again!",1,1,1,Jennifer C.,"New York, NY",162,24,20

We came with our three month old and were terrified he'd ruin our lunch and others's, but he was so well-behaved and it made our time great. Service was impeccable from the check-in desk until the end. Our waiter was knowledgable, attentive without being overwhelming, and we always had clean handkerchiefs and full glasses of water. Ambiance was casual as advertised, and the decor was modern and beige a la ABC Kitchen. The $38 lunch prix-fixe is one of the best dining deals in the city. Wife and I share everything, so we both got to experience all the plates. For appetizers we had the tuna tartare and the warm duck confit salad. The tartare was average, but its jus was beautiful, gingery, zingy; duck confit salad was spectacular! For entrees we shared the burger which was solid (the pepper-jack was an surprising and delicious cheese choice); but the sesame-crusted salmon was perfect, especially with its awesome passionfruit glaze. Desserts were good too (particularly the one with blood oranges), the most notable element of each being the ice cream and sorbet.

3.0,2/18/2016,"My girlfriend and I dined at Jean-George's restaurant Perry St and had a great experience there, so I was excited to bring her to another one of his restaurants for date night. For some reason, his restaurants are a bit hard to find? We ordered the tuna tartare to start. Unlike the traditional tuna tartares, this came with spicy radish in which the bitterness was a good addition for each bite. For entrees, the girlfriend ordered the Veal Milanese, while I ordered the Caramelized Beef Tenderloin. The veal dish can feed two! They're generous with the portion as the dish came with 2 huge veal cutlets - you have to share this dish because eating two would be way too much. As for the beef tenderloin - this was super caramelized as it was so charred; way too charred for my liking that I made a comment to the waiter because it was charred to the point where it tasted brunt, but the waiter simply replied that that's how the meat is suppose to be cooked...Overall, I was left disappointed as I expected more after Perry St. Also, we had a weird mishap with the coat check. Although we gave them our coat tag, the woman refused to give us back our coats and umbrellas for some reason. After disputing for at least ten minutes, we ended up with our belongings and a doggy bag of someone else's food..weird.If you wish to dine at one of Jean-George's establishments, I'd highly recommend going to Perry St instead.",0,0,0,Boris C.,"Little Neck, Queens, NY",3,86,14

I mean ... It's pasta... What is there to say?  Those were my options-chicken or pasta ...Shrimp - fine.. Nothing too special Parsnip soup - interesting with the coconut foam but just cause you put some froth in my soup, i'm not going to overlook the issues.  None of the dishes were hot.  Then I begin to question the freshness right?  If it's not piping hot like it should be, our the dishes cooked to order?  Desserts were awesome and that earned them one star.  Delicious molten cake with ice cream and the pavlova and sorbet was very good.  Good textures and balanced flavors.  Complimentary chocolate was good as well and that was appreciated.The second star was earned for good service. And if you're paying top notch dollar, shouldn't you be dinning with table cloths?  Nope, it's okay, I had paper table setting.  Oh and the bathrooms aren't even in the dinning area.  One restroom ran out of toilet paper.  Okay now I'm ranting but all true. Does Jean-George himself care?  Does management care?  Does anyone care about the dinners that go on during restaurant week?  Most probably not cause they know guests probably are one-timers.  They KNOW, patrons that go during restaurant week will not be returning so they take your money and laugh their ass to the bank.  Will I return?  Heck no.  If I had a great experience, would I return, of course!  Due to the reputation of this place, I expected a lot more and for this high caliber of an establish to rip good paying customers off is really something.  It's really embarrassing.  And what part of any of this was French?!  Wow ...

3.0,2/3/2016,"I have eaten at the majority of Jean Georges restaurants but had yet to try Nougatine! It was ultimately restaurant week that brought me here and I have to say, I was not too impressed. The menu for RW was limited which was a little off-putting.  i ordered the parsnip soup with a coconut lime zest cream.  It was a well-seasoned, simple, and tasty starter, but it didn't wow me as cuisine of this level should.  My dining partner was less thrilled with his first course (the seared shrimp in a butternut squash puree), he said the shrimp, in his opinion, did not taste fresh. We both ordered flounder with potato ravioli for our mains and were overwhelmed by the smokey flavor of the paprika. If you are not obsessed with BACON, do not order this dish.  It was almost inedible for us and the server switched our mains to the chicken; which was moist and served over onion compote & green beans.  The dish was very good but again, any decent restaurant in NYC should be able to nail pan-seared then roasted chicken. The best part of the meal was by far dessert: we had the chocolate cake with vanilla bean ice cream and it was knock-your-socks off delicious! The pastry chef nailed it- perfectly cooked cake on the outside, gooey chocolate molteness on the inside.  The atmosphere was filled with elegance and french-accents.  All & all it was a good evening but when you dine at a Jean Georges, there should be a better word to describe the experience!",2,1,1,Rachel K.,"New York, NY",1,13,2

The seared shrimp in the butternut squash sauce/smear was okay; it reminded me of pan-fried shrimp.I got the flounder on the potato ravioli. I had forgotten that the potato ravioli came with the flounder, and I was wondering why they filled these skins with a mashed potato. But they turned out to be really good. The fish was okay as well. I had a bite of my wife's roasted chicken, and it was actually a bit dry to the both of us.Chocolate cake with ice cream was great.

2.0,1/30/2016,"If you enjoy spending money on good food with a side of piss poor service, this is the perfect place! I was in a celebratory mood and paired with Restaurant Week (RW), I was excited to try Nougatine. We made a reservation weeks in advance and were very much looking forward to trying this place out. Perhaps the other Yelp reviews about the poor service were a fluke or the result of a rogue employee or two who hate their jobs. We had a reservation, were greeted, and seated promptly.  However, that is where the experience goes downhill.We were seated for a long while before I finally flagged down someone to ask for water and some menus. We ordered from the RW menu which was limited but tasty. I started with the roasted fennel which was very tasty. The fennel lent sweetness while the goat cheese and the olives provided additional depth to the flavors. This was followed by the flounder and potato dumpling. The flounder was flaky and tender. The potato dumpling was like a boiled pierogie. The filling was tasty but was a bit on the plain side.The evening concluded with a piece of pineapple upside down cake. It was pretty good and served with coconut ice cream. I really wished I had something more than water to drink with my dessert. I was hoping to get some coffee to accompany my dessert. However, the server never appeared again the rest of the evening and a random server or food runner (not sure because we never did meet our server) plopped the check down on the table. Nobody came to check on us, let alone permit me the opportunity to order more food or drinks. I noticed two tops were pretty much ignored whereas tables with three or more diners, the server kept checking on them and just a regular chatty Cathy. The server for the section we were seated in pointedly avoided us as he would come up to the table to the left and right of us regularly throughout the evening. Literally, less than half a foot away from my fellow diners.The food was pretty good but the poor service left such a bad taste in my mouth, I doubt I will ever go back.

I guess we looked like we couldn't afford wine? 2) Waiter cleared our plates without waiting for our replies on whether we were done.3) Waiter put the words in our mouths--""Are you done? Yes, you are done? You're done?"" We corrected him, ""No, we are not. We are not."" At that time, one of us still had 75% of her food on the plate, I don't see how she could have been done..4) While asking, ""Can I get you anything else?"" waiter was promptly clearing the table and attempting to take away (you guessed it--unfinished) dessert plates from the table. At this point, we were pretty fed up and wanted to leave already.5) Then, waiter and sommelier haul-ass cleared the table as we were getting up. I had to tell them to wait to clear the table until at least we were gone. Waiter looked baffled, nonplussed I would demand such a thing, but kept bussing anyway. I don't know, maybe we should have conversed in English to avoid being treated like foreigners who knew nothing--I don't think that even makes sense. *Sigh* Don't see why I would go back.

We arrived for our reservation at 2:45, but still had to wait a bit due to the higher volume of customers during restaurant week. However, as others have mentioned, the service is amazing. The environment in and of itself is an experience. Meal started with delicious sourdough bread, although I wish it had been served warm. There are two options for the appetizer, entree, and dessert, which was perfect. We got one of each and split everything. I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't prefer any option over the other. The appetizer tomato and cheddar soup was divine with a soft-yet-crispy-on-the-outside piece of parmesan bread. Although I'm normally not a fan of sashimi, the sea trout sashimi appetizer was perfect - no hint of a fishy flavor, and it had a tiny kick with the mint and lime. The flounder entree kept up the high standard set by the appetizers. Crispy on the outside, flaky and buttery on the inside. Served atop a bed of butternut squash, and sprinkled with pumpkin seeds. The ensemble is a masterpiece. The roasted chicken was equally as amazing, accompanied with broccoli, yogurt sauce, and breadcrumbs for dipping. Fun and delicious to eat.Dessert did not disappoint. Classic lava cake - rich, gooey, and served with magical Madagascar vanilla ice cream. The subtler almond cake with citrus sorbet provided a good balance. The cake was dense and moist, and the sorbet was just the right amount of tart.

5.0,12/29/2015,"Absolutely incredible! I really recommend Nougatine for Restaurant Week! It was by far our best experience for Summer 2015. For Appetizers, both dishes were incredibly fresh and reminiscent of our Blue Hill experience. I'm not a salad person. I usually actively avoid salads since I think they're lazy. But both the tomato salad and the squash were very good! It tasted like it was just picked from a garden outside - the ingredients were fresh and tasty (and that's coming from someone who typically doesn't like salads!).1. Summer's Squash and Arugula Salad 2. Heirloom Tomatoes with BasilFor Entrees, the chicken was the star. It was probably the best chicken I've had. It was so tender and tasted almost pork-like in how juicy it was. This is what chicken should taste like! I also really enjoyed the salmon. But unfortunately, baked salmon is never as juicy and tender as poached salmon (We had the poached salmon at Aureole for RW Winter 2015 - so incredible!). Both entrees were fantastic and well worth the Restaurant Week price - highly recommend.1. Salmon Baked with Lemon Crumbs and Sweet Chili Glaze and Swiss Chard2. Free Range Chicken with Summer Radish Salad and Cucumber EmulsionFor Dessert, I really enjoyed the chocolate cake and my dining companion preferred the Parfait. Overall, both were good choices. The cake was what you'd expect of a good lava cake. The right consistency outside and gooey lava on the inside. The compote is less heavy and more of a cleaner option.1.

1.0,12/22/2015,"That was some experience walking in.  Four diva looking employees who apparently are incapable of smiling stand at the 'Jean Georges' desk in the most unwelcoming, intimidating way, act rudely towards my fiance and when I give my name and tell her our reserv. is for Nougatine, not JG, she says ""Yes, I know that"", with a look that I must have just fallen off a turnip truck when I ask where, exactly Nougatine is.  ""Take them to their table"", she directs the other Ice Queen.  (there is no sign for Nougatine.  They just seat you by the bar in the front.  Well, I guess it's better than if you are shuttled all the way to the back after passing through the lovely JG dining room). ""And I will take your coat"". No thanks, I told her. How about, 'can I take your coat?  Call me old fashioned, but I grew up in the good ole' New York, where a 'welcome' was always nice to hear, or at least a smile and 'hello'.I wonder if they treat the JG customers better?  Fastest over$100 meal of my life, which I guess was a good thing because it was so disastrous.   Although it started out good - amuse bouche - broccoli puree with a hint of mint - delicious.   The bread had a crust that was too hard to chew, and an off sourdough flavor, served with blah butter.  Within two minutes of getting the bread, the waiter removes the butter from the table and serves the tuna appetizer.  Now the tuna tartare at JG made my top 5 list of dishes to eat in NYC.   The one tasted completely different.  The tuna was not exactly fresh, there were too many radishes but worst of all, that ginger sauce that was delicious 3 years ago, tasted more like burning vinegar with no real ginger flavor.The very small sized veal entree was deep fried. (picture fish and chips type fried).  Served over overcooked escarole with too much oil and cranberries and pecans.  My fiance said the veal was good, though I didn't care for the piece I had and it was paired with a very odd side dish.  My entree- as usual was the worst.  Salmon burger.  Tops my list for worst entree ever at a restaurant.  Ever eat the shell off a shrimp by accident and you know that awful flavor? That's how it tasted. Shrimp gone bad. I asked the waiter if that was really lobster.  He said, 'lobster and shrimp...shrimp paste'.   The gruyere and bun were flavorless.  When is gruyere ever flavorless?  Nothing could help cover that awful taste.   The second my fiance was done, 2 other servers come to take everything away as I was eating my fries. .  Think this chef needs to take some lessons from McD's on how to make flavorful fries.  Shoestring fries with zero flavor.  But I needed something, anything to get that taste out of my mouth.  ""I'll take your fries"", as server goes to remove them from in front of me.  ""No, I'm still eating them"".  Fed up with the rude, rushed service at that point. Waiter told me I could order something else, but I declined.  Unfortunately did not offer to take that $23 so-called lobster burger off the bill. I told him they need to specify on the menu the burger includes shrimp, some people are sensitive to certain shellfish.  I still do not believe there was actual lobster meat in it.And so my bad luck with meals continues. I woke up the next morning with left eye swollen shut- I am sure from the shrimp paste or whatever other shellfish they put in that burger. I had high hopes for this one, as my parents loved it years ago several times.  So I think in the new year I will give up on eating out.  Make my delicious salmon and escarole at home for 1/4 of the price.  And stick to reviewing..

I don't know if its because we're foreign and perhaps they don't like dealing with foreigners, but I have never once left this establishment feeling happy. I've always felt mistreated. Their customer service/treatment is just as mean and bad as it gets. Don't bother complaining to management they are worse than the waiters.

The summer squash salad was kind of bland and the molten chocolate lava cake was very delicious. The chicken was a little cold but it seem to be cooked on the outside. I couldn't sleep five hours later because I felt so nauseous and then I couldn't stop vomiting. The doctor told me I had salmonella poisoning. I couldn't have my normal diet the next several days except for a lot of yogurt and probiotics because my stomach felt upside down. I called the restaurant and explained what happened.

A couple days past and I didn't hear back from him. So I called the restaurant again and James said he didn't speak to the manager yet who was there that night. James called and left me a message. I called the restaurant two times that I'm returning the manager's phone call and I still didn't hear back from anyone!

We ended up having a 7th person unexpectedly join us halfway through dinner and the waitress graciously added a chair for us! Food: our table decided to try the dinner tasting menu. The first two courses, tuna tartare and foie gras brûlée, were my favorite. The last three courses were a little underwhelming. 1. Tuna tartare tasted very Asian/Japanese (in a good way) with the spicy radish, avocado and ginger marinade; it had a good kick to it and was very refreshing.2. Foie gras brûlée was bite-sized perfection. The strawberry syrup and aged balsamic complimented the dish well. The crispy top added just the right amount of sweetness and crunch. I would've gladly eaten 6 more of these. 3. Poppy seed crusted salmon was good, but the presentation was a bit sloppy. The squash and sauce looked like it was hastily dolloped around the salmon. The poppy seeds added a nice subtle flavor and texture to the fish, but the squash was sadly mushy/limp. 4. Grilled beef tenderloin was nothing special and slightly over cooked :(. 5. Dessert tasting came with the warm chocolate cake (very delicious but pretty ordinary), angel food cake (dry; only ate one bite), and a scoop of sorbet (very tart but nice palate cleanser).

His attitude was so rude, he just basically threw utensils in the tables. I had a spoon that had a sticky pink residue and i let another server know and Jonathan brought out a new one. He didnt said sorry or anything. Usually getting an apology for dirty dishes is pretty standard no? A woman served the bread and she basically served the bread across the table which i know for a fact in restaurant 101 you never do that. We just had a terrible experience here. Another water server spilled alot of water on our water and she just cleaned half of it, didnt apologize or anything and left.... We had clean the rest with our napkin. The food itself was decent.

Came late on a weekday night and got a table right by the window. The interior is beautiful and the atmosphere was peaceful and romantic due to the ambient lighting. Chairs were comfortable as well. Ordered the beet salad as my appetizer. My mind set towards salads is usually ""another day, another salad,"" but this salad was surprisingly delicious. The beets were flavorful and added something great to the salad. For my entree I ordered the chicken. It was a simple dish but there was definitely a lot of skill involved in cooking it. It was crispy-ish on the outside, but soft on the inside. The fish was great too. The summer squash added rich flavor. Dessert was definitely the best part. Molten chocolate cake to die for. Get it. I really enjoyed the food and atmosphere here so I'll definitely be back to try out their other menus.",1,0,1,Victoria L.,"New York, NY",148,143,218
1.0,7/30/2015,Service was awful. The server actually rolled their eyes at us because my friend didn't eat her food fast enough. Food was delicious but I won't be going back there again.,1,0,0,Kaity C.,"Flushing, NY",13,83,40

1.0,7/28/2015,"As a sister restaurant to the Michelin Three star Jean-George, Nougantine is like the sibling who tries but fails.Service: They did start out pretty well, when I asked for the direction to the restroom the one server was nice enough to lead me out into the hallway next to the receptionist... It really was too bad that he wasn't my server. From when we seated to when our server came to get our order was a good 15 minutes; well actually I was the one who was tired of waiting, so I had to flag someone down. This should have foreshadowed their inattentiveness. After we ordered the restaurant week sets, there were basically just two sets and I just went with another person, so we got everything... The server didn't seem happy the whole time. As we were waiting for our appetizers, they started giving out bread, which was nice except that it took about 35-40 minutes for our first course, during that time we only get two slices. The wait was so long that I would have expected the bread being given out more attentively. I also had no idea why they decide to serve bread piece by piece instead of in a bread basket. It's not as if the slices were hot... Just seems like they could have cut down on servers. Also as some of the previous reviewers have mentioned, they give you the bill before you ask for it. Granted, it is a prefixed menu, but still, the service was very slow (it was almost 2 hours from start to finish), so why are you rushing us to leave? Literally the dessert plate were cleared, not five minutes later, we were given the bill.Food: I was so disappointed with the food. The spicy tuna, was good, but nothing special. It is like a spicy tuna roll with out the seaweed and the extra carbs from the rice. The avocado was a pleasant surprise though the flavors were totally overshadowed by the taste of the spicy tuna. The cucumber made the dish a little more refreshing, however the Black olives were a bit superfluous for it did not add flavor just unwanted saltiness. The Gazpacho was an interesting dish, it was sweet, salty and spicy, you couldn't really taste the watermelon all that much as it was totally covered by the tomato soup, actually the soup seems more like canned tomato juice mix for bloody marries. The most disappointing part were the entrees the beets and radish from the Hake were good. It was too bad they weren't the actual meal. The Hake was a little rubbery, it is a shame because the fish seemed fine, until you take a bite and all you can taste is the overwhelming bitterness of the olive oil they use to finish the dish off. The chicken was even more disastrous, the garnish were onion rings. I mean if the onion rings were good then, no complains, but it stank of reused oil taste, which totally brushed off and soaked into the chicken. The eggplant bed underneath didn't add anything to the dish. The whole dish was very sad, with a nasty oil after taste.I have to say, the only star was for he dessert . The chocolate cake was good, the molten lava oozed out and was very chocolatey and rich. However, I felt very sad that the Madagascar Vanilla Bean Ice Cream on the side was not that good. If it was as they claim made with Madagascar Vanilla Bean, I would be very mad for ruining a good ingredient. The ice cream was very sugary and watered down, there were no milkiness to it. The crepe cake was pretty good, rich but not too sweet, with a nice layer of torched sugar on the top. However, the red wine infused blueberries were a little disappointing; missing sugar and depth, just overpowering dryness from the wine.Décor and other remarks: Exterior had no sign as to where the restaurant actually was. It was only until we got into the restaurant then we saw the name of the restaurant, at which point is pretty pointless. The interior decor was pretty nice, classy, granite counter tops, nice chairs. The space were I sat would have been nice if it was a single table that sat a party of four. However, they made it so that there were two tables of two in the small space; made the experience very intimate with the other table. Every time I tried to leave my seat, e.g. for restroom or just to leave, I feel like my butt either hit their table or just barely hovered above. It was so very awkward. Another thing that got to me was their inconsistencies, not all ingredients and how its cooked were listed on the menu. All in all, disappointed doesn't really capture my sadness. If you are going to participate in restaurant week, then why not do it right? Just because you are giving a cheaper Prefix, doesn't really mean you should skimp on the service or your quality. I wasn't expecting for the three star experience of Jean-George. But if you can't live up to par, at least meet the bare minimum standard. I totally should have taken the 60bucks and went to any other restaurant in the Hells Kitchen area for an overall better experience.",5,1,2,Allison C.,"New York, NY",35,68,299

I also can see they're trying to modernize French based cooking with Asian influence.

4.0,7/25/2015,"This review is based on restaurant week. So I went with my fiancée and it worked out that we could each get one thing each from the menu since its your choice from 2 appetizer, entrees, and dessert. Out of the two appetizers the cucumber yogurt soup tasted better for us. It was a perfect soup for summer. It tasted refreshing and different from other soups we had before. For the entrees the flounder was by far more delicious than the chicken dish. I wasn't too impressed by dessert but I also don't have a sweet tooth to begin with so maybe other people will have more to say about it.",0,0,0,Ferdinand C.,"New York, NY",46,264,14
3.0,7/23/2015,"Restaurant Week is a great opportunity for a chef to show off the potential of a restaurant by presenting prospective new clientele with a selection of exquisitely crafted and innovative dishes. At least in theory, right? Well, apparently Nougatine At Jean-Georges did not get the memo.I came here with my mother and aunt for the NYC Restaurant Week dinner prix fixe menu. Sampling at least one participating restaurant every time Restaurant Week rolls around is our little tradition, and at $38 per person for a 3-course meal this deal was too enticing to pass up. Unfortunately, the prix fixe menu options were reminiscent of mediocre wedding reception food: a choice of soup or salad for the appetizer, chicken or fish for the entrée, and chocolate lava cake or strawberry shortbread for dessert. A bit disappointing, considering the caliber of restaurant. As each course was brought out, I kept holding on to the hope that the chef would show us a different perspective on the old soup-or-salad-chicken-or-fish combo by adding his own unique twist to each dish, but was sorely let down. Between myself and my dinner party, we tried everything except for the salad appetizer:Appetizers: Chilled Cucumber-Yogurt Soup - In my opinion, the most original dish on the prix fixe menu. A little creamy but not rich, refreshing, with fresh blueberries and raspberries adding an interesting mix of flavors to the dish.Greek Salad of Roasted Beets - As already mentioned, no one in my party ordered this. Our server did mention that the beets are specially roasted in some sort of citrusy reduction. It looked pretty sad sitting on neighboring dinner tables.Entrees:Sauteed Flounder - An overall well prepared, but pretty standard fillet of flounder. It was a bit too heavily salted for my taste. The only interesting part of the dish was the rice pudding that it comes served over, which is reminiscent of polenta but not quite. Crispy Organic Chicken with Summer Squash - Too salty, just like the flounder. A sad piece of chicken floating in a sad puddle of tomato sauce that tasted overwhelmingly of basil. I was pretty excited about the summer squash, but there was only one tiny circle of it on my plate.Dessert:Strawberry Shortbread - Stale frosting sandwiched between two pieces of biscuit, served in a puddle of strawberry syrup and fresh diced strawberries on the side. It was really nothing special. Valrhona Molten Chocolate Cake - Molten chocolate lava cake served with a glob of vanilla ice cream on the side. Rich, sweet, overwhelmingly chocolaty, and pretty much tastes like this no matter where you order it. We ordered cappuccinos a la carte for $8 apiece to enjoy with our dessert, and those were actually pretty delicious. The service was nowhere near up to par with what I expect from a restaurant of this level. I had the misfortune of sitting on the outside of our little corner table, and the wait staff repeatedly bumped me, grazed me, and/or asked me to shift out of the way whenever it was time to clear the plates or refill the water glasses for our table. By about the sixth time I was asked to duck as someone loomed over me with a full pitcher of water, I was visibly irritated and uncomfortable, but no one took notice. They brought us our check without asking if we were finished with our meal - another major no-no. In the end, I can only describe my experience at Nougatine as anti-climactic. It was like sitting through a slew of mediocre opening acts while waiting to see a favorite performer on stage, only to be told that he missed his flight and won't be showing up after all.  None of the food was outright bad. Everything was well prepared and, aside from being a little on the salty side, tasted pretty much how one would expect at most restaurants. It just missed that special bit of culinary magic that one expects from a high price point, top reviewed, 3 Michelin star rated restaurant. I don't think I'll be back.",5,0,0,Polina D.,"Rego Park, Queens, NY",10,2,55

The food although was slow to come out was as expected--good.  Moreover, we had a 1:15 reservation and we were not seated until 2:05pm. On a positive note, they bought us all a round of drinks.

The waitress was less than friendly (did not crack a smile once and was borderline rude), the bus boys were abrupt when picking up plates (constant contact with my arm and grazing my back with plates) and the food was mostly, overly salted. We had planned on having the restaurant week menu, but ended up with a bunch of apps and a few entrees... the restaurant week menu was very limited and to be honest nothing looked appealing at all.

4.0,7/21/2015,"This is a review for their Lunch Prix Fixe for $38 which is available Monday-Saturday. This is also available during restaurant week, for $25. When it's that time of year, make sure to go on Monday-Friday. When I go here, I always make a reservation beforehand. Go to their website and it'll connect you to opentable.com! The pre-fixe comes with an appetizer, entreé, and dessert. I love to get the shrimp salad as an appetizer. The shrimp is so fresh and I also love the dressing. Having avocado also is a plus for me. I've also had their fried calamari and tuna tartare. Both are good if you want to share another appetizer with a friend. For the entreé, I definitely recommend their fish. Mostly recently, I've had their Hake, which I ate for the first time in my life. The fish itself is very light but I enjoyed the sauce that brought the flavor out. The best dish I had was their slow-cooked salmon, but I don't see it anymore on their menu! If that comes back, I definitely recommend it. I've had their organic chicken and pastas, but there's nothing special about them. For me, the highlight of the meal (because I really only come here for the dessert) is their chocolate molten cake: JEAN-GEORGES WARM CHOCOLATE CAKE with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream!! Don't hesitate, get this, because that's why everyone comes here. Disclaimer for first timers: portions are not big, so take your time eating! Nougatine also enforces a business casual dress code. They don't accept any sneakers, flip-flops, t-shorts and shorts. I saw some tourists being stopped because of this! However, they will guide you to their outside seating area if the weather is nice so not worry if you absolutely have to dress casual.",2,0,1,Michi S.,"Honolulu, HI",21,171,441

I had had dinner at Jean-Georges before and knew how outstanding their food & service are. This time was also great dining experience with inexpensive price. The atmosphere they created is very sophisticated and stylish, even for brunch occasion. Food is superior; anything you get from the menu is surprising in a good way. You might not be able to imagine by just looking at the menu, but once you try it, you know what the chiefs are doing. One little disappointment I had this time is that it took them forever to bring drinks. We had to ask a couple times to remind them. Also, a waiter refilled our glasses with regular water when we had sparkling water. But they apologized for the wait and mistake, and immediately changed it. We ordered desserts, but they also gave me an extra dessert with a ""Good luck"" sign on it-- it was very lovely. I appreciate small consideration like this. It means a lot when it is given with genuine thought. Thank you for making my last Sunday brunch in New York City fabulous.

4.0,7/4/2015,"I went to Nougatine Terrace today, 4th of July, for lunch.I was glad to discover they had a real lunch menu and not the brunch. Apparently they only have the brunch menu on Sundays. I am getting tired of no options available beyond brunches on the week-ends. I was also happy to see that they had a very affordable Prix Fixe menu for 38$, that includes appetizer, entree and dessert. Even though you are not eating at the 3 Michelin Stars Jean-George restaurant, you are getting food produced in the same kitchen. It is a real bargain.Every dish was amazing. We were 4 people, and we tried each others selection so I have a good sense of the different dishes. Among the appetizers, the shrimp salad and the tuna tartare were the best. The chicken and the salmon were excellent. The 2 desserts in the menu, warm chocolate and strawberry panna cotta, were delicious.Overall I would strongly recommend the restaurant.Only 2 points that made me give 4 points instead of 5:- the terrace is not well protected, so when it rains like today, you get soaked. Luckily we managed to get inside for our desserts. As you have to book specifically for the terrace, you may want to check the weather forecast first.- as you wait for the appetizer, they serve you olive oil and not butter. I expect to get olive oil at an italian restaurant but not at a french one. Moreover I noticed that some pictures in Yelp are showing some butter in the place inside. Not a big deal obviously but we were all craving for the butter.",1,1,1,Abd D.,"Washington, DC",2,10,6

3.0,6/13/2015,"2 stars for the service and 1 for the food. Waiters are very attentive and knowledgeable but the food was not worthy of all the praise it gets on yelp and by the fine, somewhat sketchy, folks at the michelin organization. The salt and pepper duck was so dry, flavorless and uneatable we had to ask the waiter to give us another dish instead. For goodness sakes, how can duck confit, which is poached in duck fat, taste like cardboard? This was my first time at Jean-George's  and I expected the food to be creative, inspiring and most importantly-- DELICIOUS! Unfortunately it  fell short....very short. It is infuriating to go to a 3 michelin star restaurant and receive food that needs to be sent back to the kitchen. Could this be an isolated incident... Ehh maybe. But based on other reviews here it looks like people have had complaints about the food quality too. I understand that high end cooking is supposed to be refined... But that doesn't mean it should be flavorless. The Berkshire pork chop was cooked on the underdone side and the asparagus was very... Mush! Theres eggplant under the pork chop and it really doesn't do anything for me. Just mushed up and bland. It acted as an element to prop the pork up off the plate. Simply put-- I've had a juicer, more flavorful pork chop for $5.95 in chinatown!  I could go into the other dishes we had like the tuna tartare and the charcuterie but I you would just  disappoint you with these as well. It not to say these aren't good, but the raw tuna with a ginger sauce is so unoriginal that it feels like something you've eaten a 100 times at sushi restaurant everywhere... Whats it doing on the menu of a 3 michelin restaurant???    Dont get caught in the hype if you come here. Try to forget that it has high ratings on yelp and be as objective as possible.

Of the appetizers, the tuna tartar was beautifully presented but didn't taste particularly interesting; other restaurants have done better with the marinade/sauces accompanying a tartar. The one stand out of the meal was the split pea soup - that was truly refreshing and delicious. Among the four of us, we had a range of the menu entrees: the crunchy baked free range chicken (white meat, not succulent), the miso-glazed cod (it was more citrus-flavored than miso, and the fish was not noteworthy in taste; I expected a more buttery, decadent quality for cod), the burger (this was great, but just a burger, it's not too hard to get right!), and the veal.The desserts were nothing different from a standard New American restaurant - molten chocolate cake and a petite beurre cookie with some berries on it.

I was skeptical on how much food we're getting with a 3 course and I was already thinking about where to get pizza after it since for sure we will still be hungry. But no. Their three course meal was a real meal that can definitely be enough. The amuse bouche, petit fours, dessert and even the palate cleansers that came on top of the 3 courses was lovely.

For my main course I had the cheese burger with no onions and Russian dressing but then I realized I didn't like Russian dressing so they gave me a whole new burger. Also the French fries were great. Dessert was great. The dining room was fantastic. My all over experience was amazing.,0,0,0,Georgia M.,"Toronto, Canada",0,5,0
2.0,5/15/2015,"Great service and presentation but mediocre food at best. Had the tuna: tasteless and with a sauce that was way too strong, the sea bass: okay but boring--found a hair in it!! And the chocolate cake was good not great. I also tried the pea soup and the calamari. Pea soup was good, not great. Calamari were bad...neither crispy nor tender and not good texture, sauce was all mayonnaise. Bread was okay, certainly not warm. Look, if I'm going to shell out a lot of money for lunch at a place like Jean George, I expect so so much better. Like I said, excellent (but pretentious) service, but the food was really simply nothing special. Honestly, even if they costed the same amount of money (which they obviously don't), I'd rather have a chicken and rice from one of those halal trucks on the street than the prix fix menu here. If you're one of those über pretentious types who wants to eat at a place like this for the name, or you're a businessperson taking someone out for lunch, I get that. But, if you're someone simply looking for good food, go elsewhere, really. There are restaurants that are too good in New York to pass up.",0,0,0,Michael F.,"Bethesda, MD",0,35,0

2.0,5/6/2015,"This review is based on a lunch prefix menu on a Sunday at 11:30am.I love the food, atmosphere and everything.  One thing it was surprising for this caliber restaurant is how pushy they were to hint that they want to keep in a certain pace.We were 2/3 way through our appetizer and the waiter came and ask if I want entree now or wait.  The table can't fit 2 more entree dishes, why even ask when the customers were still working on their appetizers.  And it seems they have already finished cooking my entree and just left it in the oven, because when the dishes came, the plate was scorching hot.  Good that the waiter warned me before they putting down the plate.When it comes to paying the bill, the waiter came to check if I have put a card in it not too long after putting it down.  We left before 1:15pm, so it was not even a long lunch.  Not sure why they were rushing...  Hope this can improve.",0,0,0,Eric L.,"Manhattan, NY",15,17,2

4.0,4/26/2015,"Admittedly, I love, I mean really love, the main dining room at JG.  The food, the service, and the ambiance all set my little heart aflutter.  Nougatine almost does the same.  Almost.One of my favorite things about Nougatine is that it is a shared bar with the main room.  That means I can still get my favorite warm fuzzy-inducing ginger margarita.  Two of those and any meal instantly becomes...delightful.  As much as it pains me, let's set the liquor aside for a minute.  My last visit there included a starter of the pea soup.  The name sounds like something your grandmother would make you eat as punishment, but if this soup is punishment, then I've been bad.  It is velvety, rich with flavor, and has an unmistakable brightness about it.  They also add a little parmesan foam and sourdough croutons which are out of this world.  I literally could eat roughly a quart of this stuff.  The time before, I had the tuna tartare with spicy radishes which had a great kick and freshness about it that is not found in all tartares.  The entree I tried during this last trip was the lobster burger.  My thought was that with spring upon us, the burger would be a good option.  I was partially right.  The lobster itself is delicious and has this yummy green chili mayo, along with yuzu pickles.  All of that is good, but somehow the dish falls a little flat despite a very generous side of amazing french fries.  After living in Boston, my heart yearns for lobster that is served in more of a lobster roll construct.  The other entree I've had that was truly delicious was the rigatoni with meatballs.  The sauce is incredibly flavorful and the dish, while looking to be on the small side, is quite filling.  No meal is complete without a little sweet treat at the end.  The chocolate cake is consistently delicious, rich, and decadent.  Have a cappuccino along with it and let your belly enjoy the last few bites of a great meal.",1,0,0,Dana S.,"Manhattan, NY",18,35,2

4.0,3/30/2015,"4.5 stars.  Had an excellent dinner here on a Saturday night.The service and décor are both outstanding.  The staff are clearly well-trained and knowledgeable.  We also had a very nice table surrounded by large windows.  We were presented with a nice amuse bouche consisting of a shot glass containing pear-parsnip soup, which was a nice way to start the meal.  We also had cocktails, which were just okay and nothing too special, as well as some wine.We tried 6 different appetizers.  The winner was clearly the crispy rice with tasmanian sea trout.  Unfortunately, the portion size was rather small.  The flavors and texture, though, were terrific.  The rest of the appetizers, however, were not too memorable.  The tuna tartar was good but I was expecting to be blown away after reading some of the reviews--I was not.  The fried calamari was also good but you can have calamari just as good at nice Italian restaurants.  The mango and feta salad was light, sweet and refreshing, but was hard to share considering the portion size.  The artichoke was fairly plain-tasting and would not recommend purchasing for $16.  Finally, the foie gras--maybe I'm still getting accustomed to this flavor, but I did not really enjoy this dish.  It was bitter and did not give off any ""wow/melt in your mouth"" type factor.The entrees, though, were each outstanding.  I had the salmon, which I was not disappointed with.  The flavor was delicious and it was so buttery and smooth.  I just wish I had a bigger portion (sensing a theme here).  The greens and potatoes it came with were also great.  I tasted the black sea bass, which might have even been better than my salmon.  The crispy skin gave a nice textural distinction and the flavor of the fish was excellent.  The sesame vinaigrette was not over-powering.  I also had bites of the veal and the burger, which were both delicious.  If I were to return, however, I would probably go for the fish.The chocolate cake was a nice way to end the meal.  I did not really like the rhubarb and basil ice cream dish.  The basil was a bit too strong for my liking, especially for a dessert course.Overall, this was a very good dining experience.  That being said, I am not rushing back considering the slight disappointment with the appetizer selections, the price, the portion sizes, and the fact that I want to try a lot of other restaurants for the first time.  If someone wanted to go here with me, however, I would not hesitate to join.",0,0,0,Adam B.,"New York, NY",15,156,0

Some pieces of the fish had vein.The main was chicken with lemon potatoes and herbs. The potatoes were too acidic (I have found that most JG establishments overpower with acid when there is that element on the dish). Less lemon would have made this dish very tasty. The chicken was delicious and the skin was on point.Dessert was a work of art. Yuzu eclairs with mango sorbet.  It transported me to Spring in the wintry cold.

5.0,3/13/2015,"I came to Nougatine for a work dinner; our reservation was for 5:30, but apparently they don't start seating until 5:45. We waited at the bar for a little before they led us over to our table, which was right by the door. If you ever get seated there, try to request a different table, because every time the door would open, the cold air would sweep over our table. By the end of the meal, I had my coat back on. I can imagine how uncomfortable the table would be in the middle of winter.We received a complimentary amuse-bouche of parsnip soup topped with a crumbled crouton to begin with. The crouton gave the tiny soup a great crunch, but the soup itself is definitely an acquired taste.We started with 3 appetizers to share: the tuna tartare, the shrimp salad, and the calamari. All of them were extremely delicious and I highly recommend them all!For my main meal, I got the slowly-cooked salmon over spinach and potato crisps. It came out medium rare and beautifully-plated. There's a very good balance to the dish; the sweet sauce and the spinach go well together while the potatoes provide the salmon with a little bit of salt. I was extremely disappointed by how full I was; I didn't get to finish this amazing meal.For dessert, we got the chocolate cake and the butterscotch pudding. Both were delicious, but I suggest you eat the pudding carefully; it's topped with cream and salt. I made the mistake of taking a spoonful of only the cream and salt and my mouth screwed up from the extreme saltiness.Service was great; there was always someone ready to refill our glasses, clear plates, and answer questions.Nougatine was an amazing experience and I really can't wait to come back and try some more of their options!",1,0,0,Pearl K.,"Saddle River, NJ",582,172,132

5.0,3/6/2015,"Came here for Restaurant Week Dinner.  Was running more than 15 minutes late for our reservation due to LIRR signal problems.  I was worried that they would let our table go, so I asked my friend to get the table first.  Thankfully, they let her sit at the table even though our party wasn't complete.  Service in general was excellent at Jean-Georges.  Waiters were well-mannered, friendly, more than willing to give recommendations, and constantly filled our cups and gave us bread multiple times.For my appetizer, I ordered the Parsnip soup.  It was absolutely delicious and heavenly.  Although the soup was quite one-note, it was still savory and creamy.  The soup wasn't heavy either for a cream based soup.  The little hints of seasoning and the varying textures from the coconut cream, lime, and ginger foam all complemented each other perfectly.  My friend ordered the Seared Gulf Shrimp.  After she was done, she couldn't tell if she liked the shrimp or my soup more (because both were equally awesome).Next up was the Fresh Rigatoni for the entree.  That was definitely the best pasta that I've ever had in my life.  The rigatoni was cooked perfectly to al dente.  The bolognese sauce was really spot on considering that it was a meatless sauce.  The mushrooms added meat-like texture to the sauce while also providing this umami taste.  There was also a small spicy and sensational kick to the dish.  I couldn't get enough of this savory, mouthwatering, but simple dish.  I also tried a couple bites of my friend's Roasted Chicken.  The skin was nice and crisp.  The meat was cooked quite well and tender for breast meat.  The string beans and onion compote was really good when basted onto the chicken.Finally was dessert.  We both got the green tea pavlova.  It was really a roller coaster of sweet and tart in my mouth.  The pavlova's texture was perfect.  It was crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside.  The passion fruit sorbet was full of passion fruit flavor.  It was just a tad cloying when I ate a spoonful of everything together (the pavlova, the sorbet, and exotic fruits).  It was too sweet and sour at the same time for my taste buds.  My friend suggests eating the sours alone, and the sweets alone, bite by bite.  Regardless, I still loved the dessert for the texture and flavor.",2,1,0,Nathaniel L.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",74,80,178

3.0,2/25/2015,"Came here during restaurant week. Was going to order something off the regular menu, but decided to give the tasting a try since the waiter sold it quite well.The service and ambiance was great. It's more than upscale, it's old school. Your silverware is changed between all courses, your water cup never goes dry, your whole table's plates hit the table at the same time, etc.I started with the TUNA TARTAR. The flavor was amazing. The only thing I could say that I didn't like was the fact that the tuna was pureed. If you're using a good cut, you'd want it cubed. Next was the FLOUNDER... It's a sad day in fine dining when your food doesn't even look good. First off the flounder was TOUGH. I mean it wouldn't cut with a knife because it had too stringy of a spine. There was absolutely no sauce or flavor happening to it. It was cooked way too much to the point where it would shred, not cut with a knife. It was atop potato ravioli that wasn't seasoned and was quite flavorless. Lastly, it was topped with potato chips. POTATO CHIPS... At a Jean George restaurant..... They belonged nowhere on the plate, and were greasy. The whole plate left a greasy film on my mouth. If you don't want to do restaurant week, then don't! Not all of us are people who are looking for a bargain and will never go back, some of us live down the street...Lastly I got the dessert. I tried both options. The meyer lemon mille cake was okay. It was obviously made earlier and refrigerated a while because when you tried to cut it, the layers slipped. I had to eat it layer by layer.

Once you're done with the crispy sourdough, don't be afraid to ask for more servings of the bread they give you before your meal and give it a generous dip. My favorite out of all the RW dishes.2) Organic roasted chicken - cooked to perfection, juicy and tender. Although it was a bit too salty for my taste.

They do give a lot of fish though.The desserts were nothing special. But out of the two choices (molten chocolate cake and eclair), I'd recommend the eclair (although overly sweet) just because it's more unique..Portions were overall very generous and I was full (uh..

Cant go wrong.Tried butternut squash and shrimp salad for apps, caramelized hake and red snapper for entrees, chocolate cake and toasted almond for dessert. Both apps - absolutely delicious. champagne vinegar dressing on the salad is fantastic with the shrimp cooked perfectly. the butternut squash soup is one of Jean Georges classic dishes at most of his restaurants. cant do no harm ordering this. The Hake - Greens were delicious, thought the miso glaze was a tad salty, ginger rice was good. Cant comment on the snapper as I did not try this.Dessert - chocolate cake is $$$$$$$$$. I am not usually a chocolate person, but the molten lava cake is probably the best I've ever had. Frozen toasted almond was an afterthought compared to the chocolate cake.

2.0,2/3/2015,"Came for the tasting menu. Great deal and good food.BUT the service! Oh, how terrible it was!We had a reservation for Nougatine a few weeks ago. Upon walking in, our seater took us to the bar where there was nowhere to sit as our table was being prepared. It was so crowded and rather than find us somewhere to wait, she left us awkwardly standing behind some people seated at the bar.So we stood there about 5 minutes until we started to feel WAY TOO AWKWARD since we were breathing down some people's necks and we had to keep moving out of the way for the waitstaff.We then decided to stand in next to the door where we were told by one of the waiters that we were in EVERYBODY'S way. OOPS. I'M SORRY. I JUST HAPPEN TO BE A PAYING CUSTOMER WHO GOT SUCKERED INTO BAD SERVICE. At this point, we had been waiting for our table for about 20 minutes. I'm pretty sure if I had made them wait for 20 minutes, I would have lost the table. But upon asking about the table, the woman looked at me like I was crazy for even suggesting that it should be ready. I think 20 minutes after the reserved time is a reasonable amount of time to be frustrated.Anyway, we were finally seated and served. Dinner was pretty good. Not sure that such large portions classify as a tasting menu, but that's alright. At least they give you your money's worth.On our way out, they handed us our coats and a bag and told us our hats were in the bag. Upon returning to the hotel, we realized that, in fact, our hats weren't inside the bag at all. Being visitors to New York with a flight out the next day, there was no way we would have time to go back and get them. So we called and asked them if they could ship our hats to us.

5.0,1/26/2015,"If you're looking for a nice dinner to celebrate something or just because, pick here!!! You will not be disappointed!!I came here for dinner on a Sunday with a friend and I keep thinking back to my amazing meal here!The meal started with a celery tempura amuse-bouche which was different + fun. (My friend never eats vegetables ever and I convinced him to eat this haha.) We then had the:- tuna tartare- lobster burger- slowly cooked salmon (my friend's, looked amazing)- sour cream cheesecakeThe tuna was balanced with fatty avocado and a citrus-y marinade. My burger was filled with lobster cooked *perfectly* on a super soft bun. And I don't even really like cheesecake, but I wanted more of that sour cream cheesecake!! This cheesecake was not super dense, but instead was really well paired with sorbet and berries! I don't know how else to rave about this food. The bill for two came out to around $130 (incl. tax and tip) which I thought was unbelievably worth it...Oh, and the service was great. They were friendly, attentive (but not bothersome), and they didn't seem to mind at all that I was seated at our table for ~30 min waiting for my friend (in fact they were all smiles + made sure I had everything I needed). I liked the simple decor + overall atmosphere of the place.Highly recommend!!!!!tl;dr well worth the price, great service + food that will definitely have you back for more... :) great place to go with your parents, take a date, catch up with a friend, really anything",1,1,1,Lucy H.,"Manhattan, NY",70,2,5

Overall, the setting is nice and just the right amount of upscale. It was also fun to see the waiters coordinate their movements so that two of them came to clear our table of two at the same time, with each dish.Appetizers: The tuna tartare was wonderful! I absolutely loved the spicy radish and ginger marinade. They gave the dish a strong, bright flavorful. The shrimp salad was nice, with its nice creamy dressing. Entrees: I loved the black sea bass! Such a unique dish and tastes great. The veal milanese was also quite nice.Dessert: The warm chocolate cake was delicious.

4.0,1/7/2015,"I had dinner and lunch there while I visit New York City this week. I would say Nougatine at Jean Georges is one of the best choice. Delicious and well presented meal cooked by the same kitchen of Jean Georges, one of the only six three-starred Micheline restaurants in New York City. Glad a good restaurant provides a scale down version so average people like me who don't dine at the cost of a business can enjoy good food from time to time. Services are really good - I need to finish the lunch of 3 course within 45 minutes. I left happily on time!! But the famous Jean Georges hot chocolate cake didn't exceed my expectation as I think the chocolate fondant at brown sugar in Bondi beach, Sydney Australia is better...

5.0,1/4/2015,"Had almost everything on their lunch/dinner menu, and I'm making it a point to go back for their Proscuitto Wrapped Pork Chop before it's off the menu. There's a good amount of heat in this dish - unexpected when ordering and pleasantly surprising when taking the first bite. The best part is, they can prepare it to a perfect medium rare - an option rarely offered. You can't go wrong with any choices on their menu. Who could hate the basil salt and aerated citrus-chili dip for calamari? And the pineapple-lemon jam for the foie gras brulee is smart. Everything on the menu is loveable. As Jean George's counterpart restaurant, it delivers for exactly what it's supposed to be.

The name isn't visible from the outside so it's a bit hard to spot but once inside, we were promptly taken to the bar area. We can't speak for the food because we only came for drinks. The menu has wines, sparkling and classic cocktails to meet anyone's taste.The JG 57, Paloma, Aviator, and Cucumber martini were delicious and strong. Nougatine isn't innovative with their cocktail presentation but they are well executed. The mixed drinks are around $18.

4.0,12/31/2014,"My wife and I have dined at Jean-Georges many times, but this was our first lunch at Nougatine.   Very modern and luxurious feel to the restaurant and across the street from Central Park.  The lunch prefix is a great deal to take advantage of.  Nougatine is the ""informal"" side of Jean-Georges, and, in the evening, could get very noisy with the bar near by.  Also, Nougatine is not the one with the 3 Michelin stars, that's Jean-Georges, the main formal dining room.  So, don't expect the same level of service and experience. All the dishes are good, but not truly memorable.  Hey, what do you want for 3 course prefix for under $40.  Get the tuna tartare, their signature dish.  Also, no complementary dishes, but again, what do you expect for under $40.  It's a great deal still and we would definitely go back for it.",1,0,0,Peter L.,"New York, NY",75,67,429

5.0,12/16/2014,"Almost perfect. More of a 4.5/5.The restaurant space is modern and minimal. Although this is the ""casual"" Jean-Georges, it still feels very refined. There are large floor to ceiling windows facing the street and high ceilings which make it feel very open. Service was great from the moment we entered to the moment we left. The entire staff was very professional, but friendly.We arrived early so we had a few drinks at the bar. The whiskey cider was very good, especially after it had cooled down a little so that I wasn't inhaling alcohol fumes through my nose. The cucumber martini was also good, but the passion whiskey sour was diluted from all of the ice in it.After being seated at our table we decided to all get the tasting menu. The sommelier helped us pick out a bottle of wine to go with it. They started us off with a hot shot glass of soup with a small ravioli in it. The soup was rich and delicious and the ravioli was surprisingly flavorful for something so small.Our first appetizer was a small tower of tuna tartar stacked over avocado and topped with sliced radishes. A ginger broth was poured into the dish to create a small pool at the bottom. The ginger helped cut through the fattiness of the tuna and avocado while the radishes provide a nice palate cleansing flavor as well as some crunch. Amazing.The second appetizer was their famous foie gras brulee; a fat puck of foie gras seared on its surface served on a crispy bread cracker. To the side was a dish of lemon and pineapple jam. The jam provided some sweetness and acidity to the richness of the foie gras and prevented it from becoming too cloying. I've never been to crazy about foie gras but hot damn this was good.Next was their salmon. We ordered it medium rare as suggested. It was served over a fried potato crisp, spinach, and a sauce of passion fruit and what I'm guessing was some kind of vinegar. The salmon flaked off beautifully and was without a doubt the best I've ever had. The spinach and the sauce were great as well, but the potato crisp was incredibly salty. Even when eaten with the other ingredients, the saltiness was overwhelming in each bite. I would still order the salmon again, but either ask the kitchen to go easy with the salt or just forgo the potato crisp altogether.At this point we were stuffed. The meal could have ended there and I would have considered it money well spent. But then the tenderloin came. It was served over a green pesto looking sauce (I think the waitress said it was sunchoke) with heavily roasted shallots and leeks on the side. The steak was cooked to a beautifully even medium-rare, and eating it with the shallots and leeks was a great bite. But again, there was the salt. This time it was less evenly spread, with some bites being fine and others making me want to spit it out. Still, I couldn't let such a beautiful piece of meat go to waste. Full, bloated, and swallowing even more salt, I finished it and prepared for dessert.All I wanted was a sorbet of some kind to cap off the meal. My wish was granted in the dessert sampler in the form of a passion fruit sorbet, but it also came with a mini financier and a mini molten chocolate lava cake. The sorbet was also incredibly sour, like lip puckering with every small bite sour. This ended up being great however, as I switched between bites of the sorbet and the delicious lava cake. The financier was fine, it felt like an over glorified muffin bottom (a good one), but my stomach had passed capacity two courses ago and sacrifices had to be made.Although there were some mistakes, the food was still some of the best I've ever had. Service was top notch throughout the meal. Will definitely be back at some point, and will probably check out its more upscale version next door.",1,0,0,Wade C.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",0,129,2

4.0,12/6/2014,"It was quite an experience to dine at Nougatine at Jean-Georges. It started off a little rough because this was my first stop right when I got to New York from Boston. My ETA was a little off so I was late to my reservation. The hostess was accommodating and they just reset my table. However, it took a little longer than I expected for them to reset the table though. I decided to dine at Nougatine rather than the actual Jean-Georges for lunch because it was more casual and I still got to experience the food made from a 3 star Michelin restaurant!I got their prix fixe lunch and it was an amazing deal. I started off with the fried calamari, then I got the black sea bass, and I ended with the warm chocolate cake. The calamari was flavored perfectly and the dip was really delicious. The dip was a citrus-chili dip that resembled spicy whipped mayo. I seriously wanted to dip everything in that! The problem I had with the calamari was I wished they cut down the tentacles more. It was a little messy to eat. One can tell that they put thought in coming up with the ingredients for this dish because they even included pickled chili slices to pair with the calamari, which added an extra kick.The entree that I got was the sea bass. I liked every component of the dish. It tickled every taste buds I had. It had a good balance of flavors - the sweetness and bitterness from the caramelized cauliflower, the acidity from the buttermilk vinaigrette, and the saltiness and umami flavor from the protein. The skin of sea bass was seared perfectly such that it was really crispy! I also liked the spätzle because it absorbed all of the flavors of the vinaigrette. After I finished the entree, I wanted to have another plate of it!As for the dessert, I thought it was heavenly. I normally don't like chocolate or sweets, but this was the perfect dessert for me! The molten chocolate cake was not too sweet and I liked how there were different elements that enhanced the usual molten chocolate cake. It was interesting to pair the cake with Madagascar vanilla icecream. The warm molten chocolate with the iced, cold ice-cream was a good combination! Also, they added some crunchy chocolate bits that elevated the dessert because it offset everything else on the dish that was soft.We sat by the window and had a nice view of Central Park to accompany our dining experience. I think we lucked out by getting what I thought was the best table in the restaurant. I thought the servers were attentive and there were multiple people taking care of one table at a time.

We had brunch here, and I must say, this is one of my favourite brunch spots. Brunch is a bit of a misnomer, given that there weren't many traditional breakfast items. We had the three-course tasting menu. I got the butternut squash soup, followed by the cereal-crusted chicken, and finished off with the best pumpkin pie I've ever had. We were going to the theatre right after and were concerned we wouldn't make it in time. So we told the waiter, and he told us he would make sure our dishes come out in a haste. The waiter was exceptional, and ensured that we could make the play, without compromising on the quality of the food. Given the quality of this food, I have to say, it's not too expensive.

3.0,12/3/2014,"I had high expectations before dining at Nougatine at Jean-Georges. My experience was short from what I expected, which is why I am giving this a whopping 3 stars.I made reservations for the day of my visit. I was a little let for my reservation but I ended up waiting 20-30 minutes for my table. The hostess insisted I wait in the waiting area outside. It was mid 30 degrees weather. Although the waiting area was indoors, every time someone opens the door to go out, a gust of freezing cold breeze blows towards me. This is a bad set up for patrons, especially for a restaurant like this. Finally, I was seated! I ordered from the prix fixe menu which was 3 courses for $38. This is such a great pricing, especially because I am getting the Jean-Georges experience. The environment of the restaurant is really nice. It is part of the Trump Hotel and right across from the Central Park. So you get a great view if you are seated by the window. The complimentary bread that I was served was sad and boring. It was a cold and hard, which reminded me about my experience waiting in the cold to be seated! Also, I expected the butter that was served with the bread to be room temperature or whipped, but nope it was cold and hard as a rock! There was no way I could spread the butter on my bread. For my first course, I ordered the tuna tartare with avocado, spicy radish, and ginger marinade. The ginger marinade was way too acidic. I was puckering my lips every time I took a bite of my tuna tartare. Just talking about this is making me salivating to the max.For my second course, I ordered the caramelized hake with broccoli and ginger-chili vinaigrette. The hake was cooked perfectly. However the ginger chili vinaigrette was a little too citrusy for me. I expected more of a ginger spice vinaigrette but I ended up with a vinaigrette that tasted like fresh orange zest was blended in the sauce. Not really the flavors I look for in a savory seafood dish. This entree is served with ginger rice on the side. The rice was flavored well but it was underdone. The rice was hard and if I had more of it, it would have caused indigestion for me. For dessert, I ordered the Jean-Georges warm chocolate cake with vanilla cream. The dessert was probably the highlight of my meal. The warm molten cake was made perfectly. It was a great pair with the cold vanilla bean ice cream. It was like a match made in heaven! Overall, it was a good one time experience. Maybe it was because I went the the Nougatine at Jean-Georges instead of the actually Jean-Georges.",5,5,5,Idy T.,"Boston, MA",417,402,2196

The tuna tartare was delicious and they gave you a pretty decent portion. The same could be said with the shrimp salad. The ingredients were extremely fresh and something that looked out of a grocery catalog. Next we had the Salmon and the Hake. The salmon was delicious, tender like butter and just the perfect visual spectacle. The hake was also very good, and had an interesting flavor. The flavor is similar to that of a Cod, but my girlfriend didn't like it that much.The desserts were excellent. We had the warm chocolate cake and the pumpkin cheesecake. The warm chocolate cake was your standard molten lava cake, delicious with the molten chocolate center. The cheesecake was what really surprised me. It was delicious and decadent.

I had delicious  crab cakes and a hake glazed with Yuzu and miso, rice was ( even for an Asian dish) very dry. The worst part of the meal was the body odour of one of the waiters. Every time he waited the next table and raised his arms, the smell was stronger than what I could taste from the food.I am sure that it didn't help the space was so tight, but it was very off putting.Mentioning it would have been cruel, but I believe the restaurant is trying to turn over tables too fast, squeezing in to many people and compromising on the dining ambience.NY has amazing restaurants, I don't think we will be back to this one.

Compliments of the chef, we were given 5 different desserts on the menu--and it was hard to pick a favorite!     Great place, and plan to be back for a future occasion.",0,0,0,Kathy D.,"Brooklyn, NY",237,282,810

2.0,9/24/2014,"For the price of the prix fixe lunch (almost $60 with a tip) I have experienced way better for about half the price. The atmosphere is nice, the wait is long and when the food comes out you are not going to be doing back flips for it. Dare I say looks like its been microwaved. I had the organic chicken, it's dark meat on the bone, served with bland tasteless gnocchi that looks and tastes like uncooked dough. The ""veggies"" are colorless and taste like they came out of a steamer bag from Green Giant. The only saving grace was the molten lava cake, which is sort of hard to mess up. The latte I had was good, too.",0,0,0,Christina M.,"Brooklyn, NY",10,47,0
5.0,9/22/2014,"Let me start out by stating that the $128 pre-fixe menu with three dishes plus desserts is TOTALLY WORTH IT. I chose:Sea Urchin, Black Bread, Jalapeno and Yuzu: generous portion of sea urchin served on top of lightly toasted black bread - they went together very well. I first thought a hint of yuzu on top of sea urchin was a bit weird, but the combination definitely grew on me. Turbot with Chateau Chalon Sauce: this was the first time I've tried turbot and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The fish was only lightly seasoned, but the texture was so soft that I didn't even have to use a knife to cut it. The highlight of the dish was, of course, the chateau chalon sauce! I don't even know what it is made out of, but it was so good that I was practically licking the plate in the end. It went very well with the lightly seasoned fish and made the dish very flavorful yet not overwhelming overall.Duck Breast Topped with Cracked Jordan Almonds: perfectly grilled to medium-rare. The meat went very well with the almond crust on top as well as the sauce on the side. It was possibly one of the best duck dish I've ever had in the city. The portion was quite generous, so I felt very full in the end. For desserts, you get to pick one from chocolate, strawberry, fig and summer special. I went with strawberry since I was craving something light after my heavy duck dish. The sorbet and sponge cake were excellent, but I kind of wish I had picked the chocolate one; my friends seemed to be thoroughly enjoying their warm chocolate lava cake and white chocolate ice cream. The pre-fixe is complemented with several small-bite dishes (broccoli soup, three different kinds of sorbet, etc.) here and there and I was satisfied with every one of them. Even the complimentary bread served in the beginning was great.In sum, this was one of the best fancy dining experiences I've had. I was a bit taken back by the fact that the noise level was higher than I expected (certainly not loud, but not quiet and serene either), but I think in retrospect that it made the overall experience less overwhelming and more enjoyable in the end. Needless to say the service and ambiance were amazing through and through. I highly recommend this place for any special occasion; given the quality and portion of food, the pre-fixe is definitely worth every single penny.",16,6,9,Elle C.,"Manhattan, NY",21,331,0
2.0,9/22/2014,"We decided to bring my visiting FIL to Nougatine yesterday, for his birthday lunch. Sorry to say that this place was pretty much a disappointment from start to finish.Service: Terribly slow, and not in a ""fine dining"" sort of way. We waited a while for our orders to be taken, waited even longer for our appetizers (25 minutes), waited an absolute eternity for our entrees, and would have given up on dessert if it hadn't involved a warm chocolate cake. Plates weren't properly cleared between different courses either. Even butter took 15+ minutes!Ambiance / Decor: Nothing too special. The dining room was freezing! I did love the beautiful bowls though, so there's one highlight.Food: While there were a few highlights, the food was nothing extraordinary:-- Tomato soup - definitely received rave reviews from everyone at our table. I didn't try it as it had cream.-- Calamari - nothing special although the presentation was nice.-- Shrimp salad - I could have made this for half the price, and I am a terrible cook, if that tells you anything. The most disgusting part of this salad was that the shrimp were NOT cleaned properly. At a JG restaurant I wouldn't have expected this and was really disappointed.-- Chicken - my husband was not a fan. I had a taste of the vegetables and agreed the sauce had an odd taste.-- Salmon - my FIL said he enjoyed this but I noticed he didn't finish it and it was a small portion. Not sure if he was just being polite?-- Burger - my 9-year-old seemed to like the burger although she wasn't a fan of the sesame bun and tore off the top of it to ensure that she didn't accidentally swallow a single offensive sesame. As an aside, can we say high-maintenance?-- Chocolate cake - Although the presentation was great, and the lava flowed appropriately, I've had better warm chocolate cake just about everywhere. I believe that Roy's is the best for those of you on a mission!Overall: Nothing at this restaurant wowed me in the least.

4.0,9/6/2014,"Let me start by saying that we have dined many times at Jean Georges and the Bar area Nougatine.  It is amazing to me that after 11 or 12 years it is still impossible tosnag a dining room table on a Saturday with short notice.  I called a few months in advance and wait listed. It was our wedding anniversary  and I was hoping for the typical wow experience.  I can't say I was blown away with anything except the foodand attentive service but it all seemed very matter of fact and robotic. The Nougatine room is minimalistic and more casual than the main DR. I ordered a bottle of Champagne that was excellent and I did wines by the glass. It is nice to have  a deep wine list to offer a 2009 Chateau Yquem. I also had a really nice Burgundy that I can not recall.  They were gracious enough to allow us to order off the main dining room menu which was much better than the bar menu.  My wife had the Yellowfin Tuna Ribbons w Avocado radish and ginger; I had the Foie Gras with a granola and strawberry and aged balsamic and sorrel; both apps were outstanding with very complex and deep flavors.  For our next course, I had the classic scallops with caramelized cauliflower and caper raisin emulsion and wife had Buckwheat crackling shrimp with a silky carrot puree. Both were outstanding as were the entrees, The Lobster w corn and smoked chili emulsion and I had the seared tenderloin with a mustard green ravioli and this amazing compound mustard sauce. I never had anything like this. Truly excellent and all dishes were perfectly cooked. I thought the scallops were on the small side and a few plates were a little messy with the saucing and artistry. The desserts were excellent, samplers of chocolate and the other figs all done 4 ways.  I also did not mention the great bread service. I guess I was also surprised at a few service glitches from the ""helper waiters"" One server brought me a wine that I think was a pinout and it sat for about 5 min at my table while I enjoyed the rest of my sauterne and awaited the Chateau Margaux by the glass...yes by the glass. Anyway, the server found that this pinot was another tables and without asking if I tasted it or used it he took it from me and gave it to another adjacent table. I would have taken it away and poured the poor guy a new one...I didsmell it and hold it but had not tasted it but the server did not know this.  I was also disappointed that for an anniversary, I did not get the goodies that are given in the dining room , the chocolates and cotton candy. We had a great dinner and it was very professional but impersonal and not memorable as our many visits in the main restaurant. of course we will return but that is why I only gave 4 stars",2,0,0,Ken L.,"Philadelphia, PA",21,52,34

Somehow they communicated that to our waiter and they know exactly whose birthday it is. I was blown away :)I was not impressed by the menu at all. Both appetizers on the menu are spicy. the first one clearly says spicy tuna so my immediate choice is the gazpacho soup without even looking into it. Turns out there is chilly peppers in there and I couldn't finish it. I left half of it on the table and the waiter came and asked if I didn't like it. I said it was too spicy so he offered to get me a new one and take out the chilly peppers. It still wasn't that great.The flounder was alright.

4.0,8/26/2014,"I attribute my first fine dining experience in New York to a meal at JGV's Nougatine, the sister (and lesser) restaurant to Restaurant Jean Georges located next door in the Trump Tower. At the time, I wasn't aware of the dining room that was only a few yards away from me; after all, how could a just-transplanted Philadelphian know what three Michelin stars, four NY Times stars, and a 28 in Zagat meant? But it was the first step down the rabbit hole, and nearly two years later, with a respectable list of culinary conquests under my belt, there was something fitting about walking through the same doors - but this time, for Jean-Georges.Arriving earlier in the day or evening will afford a gorgeous view of Central Park West, as the floor-to-ceiling windows across the room let the remainder of sunlight filter in throughout the evening. The dining room, almost as iconic as the restaurant's name, consists of numerous curved banquette-style seats bordering a handful of perfectly-spaced tables. It's modern elegance at its best: comfortable, but still grand enough to let guests know they aren't in any ordinary dining room.For dinner, Jean Georges offers a three course prix-fixe as well as two tasting menus: the Signature and the Seasonal. Both are comprised of 7 courses, and despite multiple perusals of the menu, both had dishes so tempting that I couldn't decide between the two. Thankfully, our server was able to confirm that we could interchange courses between the two tastings, which solved my dilemma. A half-bottle of Zilliken 2011, a slightly dry Riesling, was brought out, and we were presented with a variety of light, summery amuses, signifying the start of the meal.To begin, the signature Egg Caviar. Even at first glance, it's a dichotomous dish; a simple egg shell almost comically topped with a generous spoonful of caviar. The hollowed egg shell is filled with a fluffy, almost airy soft scramble of eggs which is then finished off by whipped cream and caviar. Each spoonful is pure delight; the hints of cayenne in the scrambled egg are perfectly offset by the addition of lemon in the whipped cream, and the final punch is delivered by the brininess of caviar. My only regret was that there wasn't slightly more of it, but it served as a good segue into the second course. I was surprised at the size of the Sea Scallops as they were less than a centimeter in width, but they were lightly seared and served with caramelized cauliflower, a few strands of parsley, and a nutmeg-infused caper-raisin emulsion.  The Young Garlic Soup that followed was served in two parts: a small terrine for the soup and a side of sautéed frog legs, which I was encouraged to use my fingers to pick up and dip into the soup. I did appreciate the simplicity in the garlic soup, which was delightfully aromatic with the addition of thyme, curled watercress, and chive blossoms, but the discombobulated components threw me off. The Turbot that followed was perfectly poached and tender, but the pairing with a Château Chalon Sauce made it significantly less appetizing. The sauce, made from the rarer yellow Château Chalon wine, had a strong acidic edge that overpowered the fish.This was slightly ameliorated by the Lobster Tartine, which consisted of butter-poached lobster served with pea shoots and snap peas, finished tableside with a pour of the lemongrass and fenugreek broth. The presence of the butter toast at the bottom of the bowl was confusing at best, as it only become a soggy carbohydrate in short time, but the lobster was cooked to perfection, and the broth was startlingly simple and balanced meld of lobster stock, tomato, lemongrass, and fenugreek. The final savory course featured a perfectly-executed Lamb Chop, seared to a medium-rare and paired with a chili oil and cucumber yogurt. The protein was delicious, both fatty and lean, and the contrast of spice and coolness worked in tandem.Dessert is an essential ending to any good meal, and the tasting menus at JG offer a quartet of Dessert Tastings. The Strawberry Tasting was less than memorable, with a strawberry-red wine sorbet, over a vanilla crumble; a tasteless sponge cake, paired with a caramelized balsamic meringue; an effort at chantilly cream that clashed with the addition of shiso syrup; and a room-temperature Pâte à Choux, served with a side of Strawberry Jam. The better bet is to stick with the Chocolate tasting, which offers a miniature version of JGV's signature molten chocolate cake.I must caveat this review with the fact that: yes, I am biased, no, I am not a professional, and yes, this is based on just one experience out of many. But let the main takeaway be this: Jean Georges continues to deliver high quality food and service, in a remarkable ambiance. Is it the best of the best? In my opinion, no, but it's a worthy presence in the list of NYC's (and the nation's) best restaurants.--Review #101 of 2014: Complete.",11,3,6,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827

We had the restaurant week menu, so we got to try a bit of everything. I got the gazpacho, the chicken breast, and the almond cake.The gazpacho was great - I liked the almonds at the bottom. The chicken breast was cooked to perfection and very tender. The almond cake was okay, but I liked what my friend got better - the chocolate cake.

We were seated immediately and had amazing service throughout our whole dinner. For the appetizer, the gazpacho soup with summer flavours and almonds was amazing. Definitely a favorite all around. I had the seared flounder for the entree - it was cooked well, soft and flaky, flavored well. However, I wasn't particularly wowed by the dish and it's taste. Unfortunately we all had the flounder so I can't comment on the organic chicken. Now the dessert - AMAZING. By far my favorite dish of the night. We all ordered the chocolate lava cake with vanilla bean ice cream. Already at the moment they put the dish in front of me I could smell the amazing chocolate cake - the smell you get when you walk into a bakery with freshly baked goods. I couldn't believe I was able to smell it so strongly in the middle of a busy restaurant. It was by far the best chocolate cake I've had in my life. We had an incident with the coffee but the restaurant was very gracious and apologetic about it. Would we be back? Hopefully!

Yes, it was Restaurant Week, but my fiancé ordered from the non-RW menu, so we got a taste of both lunch menus. And honestly, while the food was solid, nothing blew me away.We both got a tuna tartare dish to start, but our dishes were slightly different because they were from different menus. His was more Asian-influenced with gingery flavors, and mine was more Mediterranean with olives and crunchy stuff. We both thought our appetizers were the star of our meals.For entrees, he had the meatballs and I had the chicken. While both dishes were good, they didn't blow us away or make us long for more.

3.0,8/4/2014,"I love you JG but I don't think restaurant week is your thing. I made a 9:00 rese on a Tuesday night during RW and although the service at the table, not the bar, was stellar, and the wine list was fantastic, the food left me with a big case of Meh. First of all the menu that was publised for RW was not what they were serving. I got there a few minutes early and I'll have to say the bartender had little to no personality. I ordered a cucumber martini, which was actually quite good and I think he did little more than grunt at me through the entire transaction. At 9:00 on the dot the hostess came to the bar to show us our table. The service from then on was what you would expect from a JG spot. We ordered an amazing Oregon Pinot and made our dinner decisions. To start we had a choice of either tuna tartare or a salad....snore. We all went with the tuna which I will admit was one of the better iterations I have had. It wasn't just a mound of ground tuna it actually had some puffy rice balls on top that made all the difference, this dish was very good. For our entree we had a choice of chicken or fish, what is this a cheap wedding? I went with the fish which was a pan-roasted white fish with a few anemic green beans and 1 or 2 radishes on the side and my friend to my left chose the chicken. The chicken was perfectly moist and the fish was cooked properly I just was a bit bored with it all, nothing at all inventive to see around here! For dessert the blueberry crumble mentioned online alas, was not meant to be so we had a choice of either a pear tart that was cloyingly sweet or a choclate ganache cake, again, snooze.

OMG!  Sautéed Flounder was FANTASTIC!  SUPERB!  Corn pudding offerred mildly sweet flavor to succulent fish.  Fish was so moist, cooked to perfection.  It really was out of this world.  Cherry tomatoes also added another layer of flavor, I really was in heaven.  I talked about entree first because it was a highlight of my meal.  I just couldn't contain my excitement.For appertizer, I chose Chilled cucumber-yogurt soup.  It was a good start to the meal, but flavor of lemongrass was a bit too intense and a bit heavy on salt, but it packed with so many flavors in one spoonful; a hint of spiciness, tartness from berries, lemongrass or perhaps ginger, and crunch from cucumbers.  It would have been quite refreshing if the salt was toned down just a notch.  Dessert was Blueberries Angel Food Cake.  It was good also, but the fish really stole the show.  Overall, I enjoyed my choices.  My buddy had Crispy Chicken, I tried a bite and I thought it was good, chicken skin was crispy, chicken wasn't dried, but still can't compare to my dish.However, it is not a 5 stars experience for me because service was quite slow.  There was a long pause between each course.  We spent almost 2 hours on lunch.  Hopefully we won't get fired from our job.I was very satisfied with my first restaurant week choice.  Chef Jean-Georges was in and out of kitchen.  He even let me walk in front of him as I made my way out of the restaurant, like a gentleman. :).

4.0,7/17/2014,"We had a most excellent meal here.  The ambience was clean and beautifully minimal, the service was impeccable and our starters and entrees were prepared to perfection.  The Foie Gras Brule was one of the most amazing things that I have ever eaten!  Truly.  And my salmon was flawless - paired well with corn pudding and cherry tomato salad.  Absolutely delicious.  The desserts?  Hmmmmm.The presentation of the Poached Peach resembled a dirty ashtray - tiny cigarette butts, popcorn, random bits of lord knows what.  Hilarious, yes, but it just didn't come together for me.  The fruit wasn't quite ripe or warm and it sat on a bed of chilly peach granita.  And the core was full of pistachio cream.  And it had popcorn and little sugar butts on it. And mint and peach chips.  The tastes and textures were in total conflict!Now the Butterscotch Pudding with sea salt and caramel was dreamy.  Very very rich, oh-so smooth, presented simply with two biscuits and lovely with a coffee.Nougatine is deserving of 5 stars for sure, but I'm deducting one for that damn peach and the fact that I didn't love it all enough to race back.But you should go.  For the Foie Gras.  I can't stop thinking about it.",2,1,0,Jennifer S.,"Wilton, CT",10,122,57

You already looked at my way can't you tell my plates are empty and needed be taken away?The only good thing about this place is their food. But not all of them. The tuna tartare, first off, was so amazing. The tuna was really creamy and went well with the soy sauce underneath. The only thing I doubted was the radish they placed on top, which did not go well with the flavor. The pea soup and watermelon/goat cheese salad my friend ordered were really amazing. The flavor blended together really well. Ok. The bad one. I ordered veal Milanese, the veal tasted like aged pork; it was not tender at all. Also, the outside was fried, wtf? There's nothing on the menu that suggested that it would be fried or else I wouldn't order it. The flavoring of the dish was weird. Some part was very sour, and some part was very peppery aka very spicy, that made me cough a lot. AlsoWhen we asked for the check to be separated, well, it came back in one piece.

We were seated near the window as we had requested in our reservation - it has a lovely view of Central Park. To drink we ordered a Bellini and a French 75, both of which were excellent. To eat we ordered the organic chicken and the veal. The portion sizes were perfect, so we left feeling satisfied but not in a food coma. The textures and favors of the dishes were very well thought out and enjoyable, although the veal had some surprise spice to it. The staff surprised us with a happy anniversary chocolate molten cake which was incredibly thoughtful and absolutely delicious. The staff was very attentive and made sure multiple times that we were enjoying our meal. They even pulled the table out of my way when I got up to use the lady's room. We really felt like royalty! They asked right away if we were going to see a show afterwards to make sure we left the restaurant on time.

3.0,5/5/2014,"In a word, mediocre. The performance is uneven, and while some dishes are very exciting, some are very pedestrian, just not at the level which you expect from such a restaurant. Our dinner started from  amuse-bouche, which was served in the form of the shot of the soup, which tasted like a salt shaker would be put into your mouth. Two appetizers which we got were beautifully appointed and tasty - beets salad and tuna tartar, very good. The two entrees which followed, Veal Milanese and black bass were so boring with very average presentation, there is simply nothing to talk about. The woman at the table next to us called the waiter to complain about her chicken having no taste.Dessert again was tasty. Also a big disappointment was the fact that I ordered two glasses of wine - one as a taste (3oz) and one as a glass (6oz) - we got two of the 3oz glasses ( which was fine), but we were charged as for the two 6 oz glasses. Service was prompt and attentive - but not genuine. I don't appreciate a recommendation of the most expensive dish on the menu ($72 filet of sole - they must be delivering it fresh via helicopter to have it cost so much) as the best dish in the restaurant (the black bass was $34). If you just want a glass of wine - this place must be fine ( note - it is hard, but not impossible to find values in their wine list).

5.0,4/28/2014,"Solid 5 stars!! Definitely one of the best meals (if not, the best) I have had to date. Amazing food and experience!! Can definitely understand why this is a Michelin establishment. After getting a recommendation to come here from a coworker who claims that this is her absolute favorite and ""go-to"" restaurant everytime she is in NYC, I was really looking forward to this meal. My boyfriend booked the restaurant almost 3 weeks in advance and even then, we couldn't get a seating for the early prix fixe menu. So be sure to book early and as soon as you know you will visit NYC. Our reservation was for 6:45pm and we got there at 6:30pm. We were offered a coat check then quickly seated and offered water to start. It felt so warm and inviting and we were impressed from the get go. The atmosphere is lightly dimmed with a quaint candle and flower centerpiece. It definitely felt romantic yet not overly lovey dovey. We ordered the $88 tasting menu which comes a tuna tartare, foie gras terrine, slow baked salmon, caramelized beef tenderloin and assorted dessert. Because it was my birthday dinner, we received complimentary pea purée soup to start and even more desserts. My boyfriend and I ordered another lobster burger thinking that the tasting menu portions would be small...but we were so wrong. Not only were the tasting menu items very generous in portion sizes, we were stuffed by the time we got to the salmon and beef. Everything was absolutely delicious. While we both weren't big fans of foie gras, we still tried it and it was definitely better than others we have had before. Unfortunately, foie gras was just still not for us. Aside from that, no complaints at all. The salmon and beef were perfectly tender and juicy and the desserts included their signature nougatines. Including drinks, we spent around $160 after tax and tip which is amazing considering the quality of food, service, atmosphere and attention to detail.

5.0,4/15/2014,"Yet again, a hit from Jean-Georges.  Nougatine was a fantastic experience, and one of the best meals I've had in NYC.First - the location is prime - on 61st just at the southwest tip of the park.  There's a terrace in the summer, and there's a pretty cool view of the CNN sign and other epic skyline landmarks.  Service is on point from start to finish - extremely polite and gracious hosting staff, knowledgeable waiters.  The dining room is pristine, and the wine list is LONG.  We tried a California chardonnay that was explained to us in detail by the sommelier - something about being fermented in metal instead of oak? - and it was mild and tasty.  Good for a warm evening - the first of the season in NYC! - so my date and I were in a fabulous mood, and the wine only made it better.There are a TON of seafood options - and we tried nearly all of them.  The salmon sushi on a bed of crispy rice is so unique, and the sesame seeds give it a rich kick in addition to the blending of soft fish / rice crunch.  Awesome.  Tuna tartare and crab cakes were both good - but I think the raw fish is the move.  Tartare is served on a bed of pureed avocado, with some derivative of an asian sauce...very light and much more blended than the usual tartare dish.  Hamachi sashimi was served with sliced grapes and I believe raisins? - although I could be wrong on the raisin part - but regardless, the fruit sweetened up the whole dish and made for a nice variety next to the saltier options.My absolute favorite was a whipped goat cheese, beet, pistachio and olive oil dish - ultimate cheese dish that won't make you feel too heavy.  The goat cheese becomes so thin, it clings to the utensils and picks up tiny fragments of pistachio and beet - literally PERFECT.  Was absolutely in love and could eat this every day.By the time the entrees came out, I was borderline stuffed, but had a taste of the rigatoni and meatballs and lobster burger.  The meatballs were interesting - they definitely had a different type of savory flavor than I'm used to in a typical italian dish.  The lobster burger was on special - ridiculously decadent and fresh. Wish I would've saved ordering entrees for next time so I had more room - was really too stuffed to get into it, but enjoyed what I tried.It's the epitome of a perfect place to bring parents or clients- comfortable, upscale -but not sterile, with incredible food in an iconic location.

2.0,4/7/2014,"My boyfriend planned an amazing weekend trip to NYC for us so I wanted to take him to a nice dinner to say thank you. The location was convenient to our hotel and it looked nice so I booked a reservation a few days in advance. Now reading the reviews I realize that all of the lower ratings were all for poor service, and we had the exact same problem. For the prices I really do think you could get food of the same or better quality with half-decent service elsewhere. Had dinner reservations for 9:15, we walked in right on time and were promptly ushered in to wait at the bar - but weren't told that they were running behind or how long the wait would be. They were also doing this with every other group, and since the bar isn't huge, there weren't actually any seats available. We stood awkwardly in the aisle for 30 minutes before finally getting seated around 9:45. Sat for a while and watched every other table get served bread while actively trying to get the waiter's attention (we were starving at this point). It was around 10:15 by the time we got offered bread -- which was cold. Really!? You had allll that time to warm it up guys!When we finally received warm food, we enjoyed everything we ate. The amuse-bouche was broccoli soup with chili foam, which we liked very much. We shared the salmon sashimi which was fantastic - loved the crunchy rice underneath! I got the lobster burger and boyfriend got the tenderloin. Both were really yummy. His didn't include a ton of food but I had plenty so we shared. Although, towards the end of our meal, we were both picking off of my plate while chatting and the waiter would not stop trying to take the plate. It was 10:45 so it's not like we were sitting there all night, and we were chatting while eating but definitely still eating. The waiter tried to take it, I said no. He walked a few feet away.... watched us for a minute.... walked back... tried to take it again, I said no. He walked a few feet away... watched us for a minute.... walked back... tried to take it again. We were clearly still eating because he waited all of sixty seconds in between. By the fourth time it was actually becoming pretty comical. I had a french fry in my hand when he tried to take it AGAIN and we just laughed and gave up. The little desserts they brought with the check were a nice idea; the chocolates were good, but it also came with these two little green gel cubes that were not. Boyfriend described them as tasting like ""soap or hair products congealed into a little cube"". This was not necessarily the special dinner I had in mind for him, but at least we bonded over the terrible service and soap candy debacle (and the bottle of wine). Thanks, Jean-Georges!

4.0,3/10/2014,"How lucky am I? I'm very lucky! Nougatine at Jean-Georges was the hot ticket item for this year's restaurant week. Reservations were completely booked within minutes of the participating restaurants being listed. On Friday night (the last night for restaurant week) I randomly decided to check if there was anything open. Next thing you know I found and booked myself the very last reservation slot available. Booyah!My girlfriend and I arrived right on time and were seated without delay. For our appetizers we both had the Scottish Salmon Tartare Crostini. This was very good. Something about salmon and chives that just go together so well. Next for our entrees my gf ordered the Roasted Chicken while I ordered the Hake with Miso-Yuzu Glaze. Let me first state that the chicken dish was huge; which is not what would be expected of a French restaurant. It was a large cut of chicken breast that was roasted to perfection. I've never had such a succulent chicken breast in my life. The hake dish I ordered was equally amazing; albeit small compared to the chicken dish. I think I had a case of portion envy. I've never cooked with hake nor have I eaten it elsewhere but this was one perfectly cooked cut of fish. My fork went through it like a hot knife through butter. I liked the miso-yuzu glaze on top although my gf wasn't too fond of it. The ginger rice was a good accompaniment but nothing really over the top about it. For dessert we had the Gingerbread Cake and the Jean-Georges' Warm Chocolate Cake. The gingerbread cake was a little dry to me. My girlfriend liked the walnuts on top. The chocolate cake was a tad too sweet. It was a very heavy, stuck in your mouth type of sweet. The most notable thing about the chocolate cake though is that it was very reminiscent of the chocolate lava cake at Spot Dessert Bar. In fact they are almost exactly the same right down to the plates they're served on. Someone might want to look into that..The service here is top notch. It is exactly what you'd expect from a top tier 3 Michelin Star restaurant. The servers are completely synchronized such that each plate is presented to each guest at the same time. The same goes go removing a finished plate. It's quite theatrical if you ask me. I'm glad I had to opportunity to visit. Hurray for restaurant week!",1,1,2,P C.,"Brooklyn, NY",235,206,145
1.0,3/9/2014,"I came here over the RW 2014. I was not expecting a foir gras or anything spectacular because after all it's restaurant week. However, the quality of food and the menu options are more than disappointing.I make a reservation at 9:15pm which is pretty late, but still, we waited for more than half an hour. What is the point of having a reservation system if you can now seat people within reasonable time? Then it comes to the menu, only two options of appetizer, town options of entree and two option of dessert, and worse of all, either of the two is far from a satisfying dish, especially the entree. I ordered Hake for entree, the Hake was fishy and miso flake doesnt have any taste of sweetness and miso. The side dish of the jazmine rice and the kale leafs, the leaf is bitter and the rice is recooked. I understand I paid a discounted price for RW menu, but if a Michelin restaurant thinks it is a completely waste of money and time to join the week then just drop it!

2.0,3/6/2014,"To keep things in perspective, I think I would rate Nougatine higher if it were a standalone restaurant.  Having experienced the magic of Jean George previously which is located in a separate and more plushy dining room separated by a wall, one can't help but think the Nougatine diner is a second class citizen.  The best comparison is being an economy flyer while knowing that the first class flyers are enjoying their flight. The lobster was under cooked and still a bit translucent.  The pork chops were okay.  The $6 homemade soda was good.  Other than that, I can't really recall much aside from the flow of dedicated wait staffs bringing dishes to the patrons enjoying their tasting menu next door.  It works like clockwork, like a well choreographed ballet.  One can't help but feel distracted and under appreciated when such ""class differences"" are so apparent on display.  It is made tougher when the tab is over $200 for two only to feel inadequate in comparison to the $600+ for two next door.  More importantly, the food simply did not live up to expectation.  My recommendation, either take your $200 and go elsewhere or go to Jean George for a truly luxurious and pampered experience.",0,0,0,Bill C.,"Queens, NY",1,15,0
3.0,3/4/2014,"NY Winter Restaurant Week.Salmon Tartare to start. Chicken and Potato dish for main.Jean Georges ""Signature Molten Chocolate Cake"" for dessert.Lets start by saying the service was wonderful. The 3 stars are for the service alone. Our server was helpful, charming, and best of all NOT uptight like many of the people in the restaurant. We also had several bussers and food runners who were all wonderful. My water glass was NEVER empty. Our wine glasses remained perfect. We even had a round of dessert wine recommended that was simply TO DIE FOR  amazing. However. The food itself was all over the place. The Salmon Tartare was delicious but the 'bread' it came on was toasted to a beyond rock hard chunk of disappointment which is a serious shame considering how amazing the tartare was.  My date had the Miso-ginger Hake for his main dish which was frankly overpowering. The level of ginger was just hiding a rather bland fish strip while sauteed greens sat sadly next door without any flavor. My chicken was essentially a gourmet wannabe fried chicken breast but the delicious potatoes and friend onion mix underneath actually created a solid dish even if it wasnt exciting.But now DESSERT. I cant even explain my disappointment. I looked at my date's Ginger cake dish with apple sorbet and was so mad at my choice. Chocolate Molten Cake should be delicious, moist, and wonderful. For something that is supposed to be a chef's signature it sure was boring, uninteresting, and frankly the worst part of the meal. A chunk of uninspired vanilla ice cream sits next to it without any regard for being a composed dish. I have absolutely nothing positive to say about this dessert. I know Restaurant Week is oftentimes more interested in quantity rather than quality but chef's should be seeing it as an opportunity to introduce people to their food who wouldn't otherwise have the chance to try it. I am not inspired to be back to Nougatine anytime soon. And if Jean Georges is so uninterested in my business at his more casual restaurant then I cant see why I'd bother going to his others.",0,0,0,Carolyn O.,"New York, NY",1,33,5

However desserts, we only had 2 choices for either lunch. love the sourdough bread that comes out first. Appetizer: Tuna tartare. really good! had a base of avocado and soy/ginger sauce which made it have a kind of sushi feel.  the avocado base was great. my friend got the calimari which was really good too. not too oily and unique spices. also the sauce you dip it in was very light and tasty.Entree: Parmesan crusted chicken - the parmesan crust was extremely good. loved the crispiness. However, the chicken itself was a little dry.Black bass was ""aight"" according to my friend. The sauce and potato were good, but the bass itself wasn't bad but wasn't amazing. the greens was a mix of cilantro, leek, dill, and maybe something else. It was interesting to have such a blast of flavors in your mouth, but it was good!Veal Milanese was really good. Tender and the sauce was on point. better than the chicken. however the portion size was a bit small. Dessert: Even though there are only 2 choices, it's okay for both are really good. Banana cake was good, but not as moist as I hoped. I also wish the salted caramel ice cream that comes with it was a little more ""salty"". However, the molten chocolate cake was AMAZING. So soft and perfect. The ice cream also worked really well with it. It was ""Madagascar Vanilla Bean"" but my friend couldn't taste the ""Madagascar"".  hahaha.

I thought I should give this place a try and so I came here with Z.We had the following:Amuse Bouche - A delightful trio of a soup, a salmon filled eggroll like and this other thing.

I was ready to lash out on the restaurant's hosts when a very nice staff member, who probably noticed our impatience and misery at the bar, reached out to us and made the effort to get us a table asap.

There's a perfect balance that is so subtle. At nougatine, you get the same great taste, texture and pairing, but it doesn't have that subtle perfection of a variety of ingredients.for service, it is incomparable.

Nougatine has a pretty sweet lunch prix fixe menu for $30 something dollars per person for app, entree and dessert at prix fixe portions.  I'm personally a huge fan of these as it allows you try more things on the menu and their lunch was an affordable price.    Everything I had was delicious which was the butternut squash soup, sea bass and almond tart.  The wait staff is also very knowledgeable and professional and did their best to avoid interrupting our discussions while serving.  lol but that also probably made the meal took longer as we were quite a chatty party.Overall, would come here for lunch again as its not too far from the office and they have a great selection I'd love to try.",1,0,0,Eileen J.,"New York, NY",40,185,0

Minor details for some people, but for such a renowned restaurant at a fairly high price point -- inexcusable.The three courses of the prix-fixe meal came promptly in succession, and as several reviewers before commented, were good. Nothing too memorable, but none of the courses disappointed... except for a big brown chunk (hopefully a spice?) hidden inside my friend's tuna tartare! I had the tuna tartare, the veal milanese, and their renowned chocolate cake.  All solid choices for this price point, but again, nothing particularly unique.  Of note, all the dishes are on the sour side -- for anyone sensitive to acerbic palates.Throughout the meal, again, our water glasses remained empty, and we had to flag down our waitress several times to fill them again -- in one instance, they only filled two out of four glasses and never came back to refill the other two!Maybe it was just an off-day for them, but a restaurant with this high of a reputation really should do an even better job of maintaining that standard, because I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone based on my experience.Summary: FOOD 3.5 stars, SERVICE 1.5 stars.

The avocado complimented the tuna well. It's also presented quite beautifully - The foie gras brulee tasted a bit oddly like pumpkin pie. After a few bites it was  cloyingly sweet and I couldn't finish it.- The slow poached salmon was beautiful. No negative comments on this dish.- The caramelized beef tenderloin was cooked perfectly and I was a huge fan of the accompanying habanero and basil sauce. - The dessert tasting included the classic Jean Georges molten chocolate cake (which is always great), a passion fruit sorbet (perfect balance of tartness and sweetness), and a fresh strawberry tart (good, but not memorable).Service:This is where I am more torn. Everyone was friendly, nice, and attentive. The sommelier especially was friendly and quite helpful. However, there were a bit too many mistakes for a restaurant of this quality. For example, it was quite awkward when one of the servers dropped and broke a plate during the middle of dinner service, leaving the dining room completely quiet and still for a few painful moments. Furthermore, one of the complimentary bites at the end of the meal was mistakenly covered in salt instead of sugar, which ruined the end of meal experience for me and my friends.Overall:Nougatine is a beautiful restaurant and is the more casual counterpart to Jean Georges.

This was the fancy dinner (though casual compared to Jean Georges) - the more low-key dinner followed the next night at Blue Hill.  Let me say up front, that the desert was the only thing to knock this from 5 to 4 stars.  Keep in mind, that these are New York fine dining stars, not to be confused with the four stars I might give to my favorite cheese burger joint.The interior is understated and handsome, with a light overall feel, attracting a well heeled clientele.  We sat near the kitchen, which was nice - the kitchen is a show piece!  My wife faced me in a booth-like recessed niche and this made the open floor plan feel more intimate.  Check out their website, which does a great job of conveying the design and mood of the restaurant.While I love a well designed restaurant, the food is what matters.  On that note, I'm more of a food appreciator than a gourmand, so I experience restaurants less analytically and more sensually and emotionally.   However, if you like to regale (bore) others with stories of your fabulous experiences, Nougatine will give you plenty of material.  After cocktails, (which we drank to the exclusion of wine to avoid a nasty hangover), my wife and I both ordered the tasting menu.  I've found this a good route at serious fine dining restaurants, since the chef usually assembles a meal with artfully complimentary courses.    The tasting menu was full of contrasts, from the clean and delicate tuna tartare to the autumnal foie gras brulé with spiced fig jam. The same could be said for the grilled hake - the best fish dish I've ever had - versus the caramelized beef tenderloin, which seemed to provide all the best flavors of the season in each bite (brussel sprout heaven).   Combined, the courses were individually wonderful, albeit rich.  I felt good after the meal, but the mix of strong flavors and large portions of fish and beef brought me to the edge of being uncomfortable.  It was a lot of a good thing.But the highlight was the hake, with a delicately crispy top sheltering a perfectly baked interior.  Normally, I can suss out ingredients, but this had such a beguiling collage of flavors (most savory, some slightly sweet, some a bit tart) that I could't tell what I was tasting.  I was forced to move from any sense of critical distance to simple profound enjoyment.  That is probably the highest praise one could give a dish of food.  My only criticism was the desert (enough to knock the review to 4 stars), which consisted of a mini chocolate melted cake, which was very nice, but the accompanying apple tart was only good, and the sorbet was painfully tart, with little flavor.  The staff was reserved but very attentive - almost doting.  With such a high emphasis on service, the two to five people serving and removing plates at any time could verge on intrusive, at least for me.  There was time for quiet talk, but make no mistake:  for most mortals, Nougatine is the show, not you or your date.   The restaurant seems tailored for business meals, an adult aged family, or small group of friends.Overall, a great experience.",1,0,0,Craig E.,"Corrales, NM",37,38,7
4.0,10/17/2013,"Hubby and I went here on Monday for our anniversary dinner.  We were early for our reservation so we sat at the bar and munched on the complimentary snacks which were quite interesting - a dressed popcorn, wasabi crusted nuts and another beer nut style snack.  Highlight of the evening was seeing Donald Trump in all his ginger haloed glory as we were waiting for the table. I admit I geeked out - definitely embarrassed my husband who said I was acting like a tourist when I snapped a quick pic lol...Anyway - the food.  Unlike many other places, the restaurant does not require everyone to order the tasting menu.  So we ordered one tasting menu (I'm a sucker for tasting menus) as well as the salmon and the calamari so we could try more dishes.  Overall the food was solid and the portions were very generous for a tasting menu - $88 was a steal IMO.  We were given complimentary amuse bouche - a tasty tempura bite. The standouts for us were the calamari (perfectly cooked), the tenderloin (tender, juicy and flavorful) and the tartare.  The Hake was also very well executed and much better than the salmon which I thought was lackluster.  I found the foie gras to be overpowering - too salty and too sweet at the same time if that makes sense and not enough brioche, but hubby liked it. The dessert trio was good, but I wished I got the signature warm chocolate  cake dessert which I've had previously and simply adore.Our server was attentive without being intrusive.  We were given a prime seat by the window overlooking the park. My only real complaint was that our anniversary was not acknowledged in any way, though I noted it in our reservation. However that was just a minor annoyance in an otherwise great evening.

4.0,10/7/2013,"I was looking forward to Nougatine after raving reviews in past years about their restaurant week deal. Then I got upset after hearing that they changed it this year to a much more limited option. I checked their RW menu online and although limited, it still sounded ok.While I took advantage of their RW deal, DH decided to order a la carte. I had watermelon gazpacho to start, it was light and refreshing but I'm not a big fan of gazpacho. Chicken was my main entree and it was so good! I also tried hubby's tuna tartare appetizer which I think is overrated and his cod as main entree which neither of us were crazy about. We shared the warm chocolate cake w/ ice cream and that hit the spot.The ambiance was gorgeous and their service was superb.

5.0,10/4/2013,"I seriously ADORE this restaurant.  I've been here three times now -- once for winter 2013's restaurant week with my bf, once for my birthday in Feb., and once this past summer restaurant wk.  SO DELICIOUS.Nougatine is so classy.  Getting a table by the window is definitely the prettiest view.  They also have a bar area as soon as you walk in, but the staff makes sure that area doesn't get too overcrowded/noisy, so it's very nice to carry on conversations in this restaurant.  The inner seating in the back also has the advantage of being closer to the kitchen of JG.winter 2013 -- (RW) we ordered tuna tartare and a soup for appetizer, and the salmon and chicken for entree, and the lava cake; we got another dessert but forgot what it's called...  I also ordered a bellini and that was delicious as well.  My bf wasn't feeling well, unfortunately, so we had to leave before our dessert arrived, but the staff was so nice and attentive that they packed up our desserts for us (minus the ice cream portion which cannot be taken out since it'd melt).Feb. 2013 (my birthday!): my friends actually initially made a reservation for us at Jean-Georges, but once we were seated and handed the menus, we realized it was WAY beyond our budget (they were all pre-fixe, which we didn't know, and NOTHING could be shared).  My friends being the wonderful people they were wanted to splurge and just suck it up and eat there, but I felt really bad and so I insisted that we leave (I think I embarrassed them haha).  I apologized to our wait staff and informed that we'd like to leave, but they were so nice and offered to check if there was space in Nougatine.  Luckily, they did have one free table for the 4 of us, so we went to eat at Nougatine.  There, we ordered tuna tartare for appetizer (only one I remember); and for entree we got the slowly cooked salmon, grilled pork chop, and I got the Gemelli to share with my friends.  It was yummy; I think I liked the salmon the best! Note: we were seated near the door and it was REALLY COLD!  I'd recommend dressing warmly if you'll be going here in the winter!Summer 2013: (RW) went with my family on Friday at 9PM; it was the busiest I had seen them (and there were hella Asians around us LOL) The service wasn't as great as the first two times, but the staff was still very friendly and attentive.  We got the Skuna Bay Salmon Sashimi (not on RW menu; but it's worth it!) It was 4 pieces and it was paradise.  Each roll was CRUNCHY and the salmon was seasoned to perfection.  I seriously wanted to order some more but decided against it since we had so much other food...  DO NOT GET THE GAZPACHO SOUP! It tasted like frozen blended marinara sauce; I didn't like it at all.  My cousin got the salmon done medium-rare and it was really yummy! I didn't realize you could dictate how well it was cooked before.  I got the fried chicken, and it was really good -- super crispy layer on top with juicy chicken :D  My mom got the skate fish and it was yummy, but I liked my chicken more.  Dessert options were once again the classic molten lava cake and some sort of peach thing with sorbet; desserts were not my highlight this time though.My dining experiences tend to be shaped by my opinion of the service, and I must confess that Nougatine has consistently offered me impeccable service.  I really love this restaurant, and I hope that one day I'll be able to dine at Jean-Georges.",0,0,0,Jing Jing G.,"Manhattan, NY",88,65,12
3.0,10/2/2013,"Disappointing meal. Boyfriend and I came here on a whim because of the fantastically priced pre-fixe menu during lunch. Tuna Tartare: fresh, pretty standard... avocado and fresh tuna. Beautiful presentation and well seasoned with ginger soy. Boyfriend thought he had a hair in his so we returned it but they told us it was tuna floss from the meat. Fine, felt bad.(Off pre-fixe)Foie Gras: First bite, interesting. Second Bite: Okay, kind of sweet. Third Bite: Cloying, tiring, too sweet, the foie gras became lost in the sugar. Pan-Roasted Bass: Good, well-seasoned but not spectacular. Stewed Tomatoes and flash-steamed beans. Boring. Oily. Salmon: Perfectly cooked fish but again, sitting on-top sautéed spinach and... sliced potatoes? Uninspiring. Good but nothing spectacular, again. Quite oily as well.Dessert: The only redeeming course on the menu.Molten Chocolate Cake: Very chocolatey and rich. Ice cream was good. Definitely an eyelash on the plate. Like, definitely. Like, but I was over it at this point. French Toast: Wonderful stone fruit (peaches, nectarines, etc) and I'm such a sucker for crème fraiche like, I can't even. A pre-fixe meal is supposed to entice a diner to try other options on their regular menu. This was not an inspiring or enticing meal. The only impression I received from dining here was that they were trying to modernize classical French dishes and failing: pretty dishes fall flat and anything from the standard menu is over-priced.",0,0,0,Karen C.,"Brooklyn, NY",215,181,52
3.0,9/29/2013,"I had dinner at Nougatine for the first time recently on a Saturday night. It was a special evening as it was the first meal my husband's brother & sister-in-law enjoyed during their first visit to NYC. Our table was ready within minutes of our reservation. Our server was professional, yet warm and her recommendations were spot on. The food was superb. So why only 3 stars? What would've otherwise been a stellar dining experience was marred by the sommelier. Our server asked if we needed help with the wine list and we demurred, knowing that with only 1 wine connoisseur among us, a sommelier was not called for. To our surprise, the sommelier presented herself at our table nonetheless. We listened politely to her as she waxed poetic about wines which were no doubt fabulous, but beyond the palate of most of the folks at the table. When she finished, we thanked her and told her we needed a minute. She seemed a bit taken aback that we weren't inclined to take her up immediately on an astronomically priced, but no doubt amazing bottle of wine on the spot. She returned to our table a few minutes later and when we informed her we'd prefer just an ordinary bottle of Willamette Pinot Noir, made no effort to hide her disgust with our choice and turned on her heel to go. We thought we'd seen the last of her because no doubt she wouldn't deign to open said bottle of wine. In fact, she returned with the bottle of wine and asked us to confirm that it was in fact what we had ordered. She made it abundantly clear that ours was not only a misguided but offensive choice. She literally gave us the stink eye as she poured it. I've visited Manhattan many times, and dined at many esteemed restaurants there, as well as in Paris, San Francisco, Barcelona... But no matter how expensive or ""haute"" the cuisine, I have never been subjected to such treatment by what was clearly an arrogant, small-minded sommelier.",0,0,0,Rebecca R.,"New York, NY",163,25,2
2.0,9/21/2013,"So to preface, this is my first review, and it seemed it needed to be done. A hard thing to do in NYC is find a kid friendly place that isn't a TGI Friday's, when we would like a nice glass of wine or champagne or just better food. We were told by our concierge this would be a great place for lunch with little kids, if we could get on the terrace. We did. In all fairness I was a little under dressed but certainly we didn't look like hobos. Sat down with a 10 month old, our big concern was the sun, well they put us in full sun with wide open tables in the shade. Strike 1. Then we order our drinks.....then we ordered our food....then we got our bread.....then we got our drinks 20 minutes later. Our server didn't know how to pour a beer, so that was frustrating but we can deal. Next we ask to move because it was very warm and really we were worried about the baby. The move was good. We were in a good shaded spot and things were looking up. Apps come out, food is tasty. I had the calamari and it was really top notch. Then we waited a while before we finally got our meal. The food was cold and mine was wrong. We then ordered a bottle of champagne. At this time there are three tables on the terrace that are occupied. We timed it, it took 18 minutes to get a bottle of champagne. We had finished our meal by then. Cold food, really poor service. Very disappointed. I would fear going for a nice dinner based on this and would probably never go again. Waste of a great location.

4.0,9/21/2013,"My family and I absolutely love Nougatine for breakfast. We are often there at least twice a week. I have no idea what they do to their eggs here but I have never had a better scrambled egg- buttery, soft but not too wet, just amazingly delicious. Could it be the Feather Ridge eggs they use? Perhaps but whatever it is, I haven't been able to recreate them at home. The crispy potato wheel which accompanies the egg dishes is amazing as well- crispy, buttery, delicate but very satisfying. Amazing value considering it is only a couple of dollars more than a regular diner but the atmosphere is much nicer. Good tip- you can substitute a bagel and cream cheese for your bread option for no extra charge. I also love their lunch. They have a prix fixe menu but you can also do a la carte. Absolutely one of the best cheeseburgers out there. This is not an enormous burger with everything falling out of the bun but a more refined, delicate, juicy, perfectly balanced cheeseburger with their amazing Russian dressing sauce. Their fries are pretty perfect as well. It sounds odd but it is a much nicer, way more delicious, high- end version of a Big Mac meal.  Only things to be aware of- service can be hit or miss. Sometimes it is amazing but sometimes it is inexplicably slow- I have found it has little to do with how busy they actually are and more with certain servers. Also, since it is located in a hotel, they automatically add a 15% tip to your bill so check your bill!",3,0,0,Christina S.,"New York, NY",56,288,0

The dining room is much more formal, but the captain in charge of our table (head server) was incredibly knowledgeable, and awesome.They did not have the pea soup, sadly, it was a spring offering. I don't recall the appetizer, scallops, being that good, sad to say,, but the braised short rib was decent, but really not out of this world. My favorite was the desserts. We got the vanilla something to share, with the warm chocolate molten cake. It was supposed to take 20 minutes or so from when we ordered, but because we were in a rush, the captain got one to us really quickly (less than 5 minutes). I'm sure he snatched it from another table, or maybe the kitchen had an extra made... but still, totally appreciated!Also, there were little home made chocolates for the table, and you are always welcome to ask for more, and they are so good about it. Love the service and the special touches, not so much the appetizers and entrees. Dessert is out of the world, as is the service.

This was followed by the most delicious corn ravioli I have ever tasted.  The most delicate of pastas, embracing sweet pearls of corn - dipped in a bright, fresh green sauce that was just the essence of summer.

Although once we got there on a Monday afternoon, we had to wait 15minutes and were given a table in the back of the restaurant by the kitchen (not too much to complain about then). Until, our waiter introduced himself, he was as rude as can be and did not smile as long as we were there. He rushed us to order and ended up forgetting to bring us our 'homemade sodas' in which I had to remind him after our main meal came. The food was a waste of Michelin stars. My sister ordered the calamari for starters, salmon for entree, and warm chocolate cake. The calamari was great with the chipotle dip but how hard is it to make fried calamari? And my local deli makes a good chipotle mayo spread. Not impressing! The salmon wasn't cooked well, and the sauce was bitter. I got the shrimp salad which was good but nothing out of the ordinary. The chicken was blah, and the sauce was bitter. We also ordered Black cherry-yuzu soda and passion fruit soda. I had to change the passion fruit soda for another black-cherry because it was not drinkable. It bugs me to know that this restaurant has any stars. The place is pretty cold, marble floors, leather chairs, wooden tables and panels on the wall. Again, not impressive. A manager walks around constantly and stood behind me annoyingly a few times.

I asked isnt it supposed to be Lavendar? The pound cake first off was hard, not moist and soft at all, the berry compote was really good and they topped it off with an ice cream that I have no idea what it was but it was good as well.  They only miss on dessert was that the pound cake was dry and hard and not LAVENDAR, it was butter pound cake.  Frankly an Entenmanns pound cake would have knocked it out of the ball park.  Now throughout the entire lunch the staff was very attentive always refilling the water, bringing more bread and making sure the dishes were cleared the moment we were done.  Except for when it came time to leave.  I had to flag someone down to get a check.  The hits far surpassed the misses so I would definitely give them another try.",0,0,0,Andreina J.,"Montague Township, NJ",2,30,5

The hostess was very nice, checked in with us if we wanted a champagne, we both had a drink already, I had a comped champagne after she talked to us. We thought it would be nicer if they comped us for the drinks at the bar. And when we eventually sat down at 10 pm, I asked if the post-theatre menu was available (I wanted to try the tuna tartar), but unfortunately, the waiter told me that it was not available because of the restaurant week even though their website didn't clarify that. So I ordered from the restaurant week menu. My hubby ordered the wine, and the waiter tried to confirm if I would order any drink for dinner, we both clarified that we would have a whole bottle of the wine .... then the service was getting better ... The ladies sitting next to us ordered from the Jean George menu obviously got a different level of services, which made us very uncomfortable. They also had a trophy wife kind of look as well. Nonetheless, we will probably give it another try. We had lunch at Boulud Sud the same day, the experience was totally different. We have to say ... so far, we had never had a bad experience at any of Daniel Boulud's and Danny Meyer's restaurants. Next time when we will go to the opera, we will probably choose boulud sud rather than Nougatine. Nonetheless, we had a good experience at JoJo last week.",0,0,0,Billy K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,0
1.0,8/9/2013,"After a very disturbing experience at the restaurant over a month ago,I sent an email to the General Manager, Alex Wolf. He never responded, so I am posting my letter here for others to read. I had wanted to give him the courtesy of reading my note and replying privately, but his lack of response just confirms their sub- standard customer service... in spite of their delicious food.July 2, 2013Dear Mr. Wolf;Last Wednesday, June 26, 2013 was a special day for our family. We were celebrating a graduation and a birthday, so we wanted to do it with panache and chose Nougatine as the venue.The food was superb.There were other issues, however, that left an unpleasant aftertaste.As a top-tier NYC restaurant that presumably values constructive feedback, I offer it here:I made the reservation via OpenTable, was required to leave my credit card information to hold the table,and was contacted two days before our scheduled time to confirm. No problem.1. The day before our scheduled time, I was contacted again to confirm the reservation, and this time was asked for an email address so a document could be sent for me to sign, offering further proof that we were coming.This was highly offensive. Never before have I been asked to 'sign an affidavit' (my words), before dining out.What next, my first born son, I thought to myself? Suddenly I didn't feel like a valued guest. The person who called me could hear my hesitation, confusion and umbrage, so she decided to check with her manager to see if they could forgo this formality.  S/he agreed, so there was no email/document signing.2. We arrived at the restaurant a few minutes late for our 8:30pm reservation and apologized to the hosts, who told us that our table was in the process of getting ready, so we weren't late, and suggested we take a seat at the bar.  We waited patiently at the bar for 20 minutes before my son asked about the status of our table-- this was at 9pm.4. Then we watched a table being set for 4 people (we were a party of 5), and again had to ask what was happening, as we assumed that table should have been ours.  We watched as a series of people were given instructions on how to complete the set up of the table.10 minutes later we were finally seated and handed menus.5. Within seconds of my opening the wine list, the sommelier, Andrea, said that she'd seen I was reviewing it and might she be able to help. I hadn't even begun reading the list, so asked her if I could have some time before seeking her opinion.6. Another woman then approached the table and indicated that since we'd been waiting so long, they wanted to send over some ""snacks,"" and did we have any allergies/aversions? (She was the first person with whom we felt we were being treated with kindness and concern.)  They arrived and were appreciated, and delicious.7. Our waiter, Brian, was excellent, seeming to have some clue that we were aggravated, but handling us with great care and allowing us to relax in his presence so we could enjoy our meal.8. Andrea worked hard to help me find a wine that was right for us, and sensed that my budget for a bottle was not in the $100+ category, so she brought me the unabridged version of the wine list. One item caught my eye, the Viognier, but I was surprised to see that it was priced at $52 on one menu, and the very same bottle at $70. When I brought this to her attention, she said, ""That's very embarrassing, but the price is $70.""   In my experience, whenever an item has two different prices in a store, the less expensive one is honored. I didn't object but was disappointed in her reply.9. Once the wine choice was settled, I noticed that everyone had received a piece of bread except me. Perhaps my plate was obscured under the Wine tome, but nonetheless, it's a detail worth mentioning. Sadly, the experience of dining at Nougatine did not rise to the standard of the food.I, and all of our three adult children have worked in restaurants (in Washington DC., San Francisco, Marblehead, Salem and Great Barrington)-- in the capacity of hostess, waiter, line chef and sous chef,and we all saw myriad ways in which we could have, and should have, been treated better by the 6+ people we  interacted with (excluding those mentioned).My husband and I, long time NYC residents, know what it's like to have the best of both. Again, the food was perfect, so hats off to you for your success in the back-of-the-house but the customer service was so lacking that it marred the entire experience.  With kind regards,Debbie I",0,0,0,Debbie I.,"New York, NY",259,5,1

2.0,8/4/2013,"I have been a loyal customer of Jean Georges (everything from the flagship to JoJo to Perry Street) for a number of years. Generally the service has been very good as has the quality of the food. However, I recently went to the Terrace at Nougatine to try out the restaurant week menu. The experience was extraordinarily disappointing. Service was very poor (we were consistently ignored and I frequently had to ask two or three times for things as basic as water, bread, and the check). The bread was stale and wasn't fresh even after I asked for a replacement. The quality of the food was mediocre, reflective of a restaurant week that isn't in keeping with the usual caliber of the restaurant. The main dish of chicken lacked flavor and the appetizer of watermelon gazpacho soup was only so-so. I expect Jean Georges to provide me with an exquisite experience whether I am there for a full-priced meal for a client function or whether I am there for a casual restaurant-week meal out with a friend. I am very disappointed and I think Jean Georges may be falling into the same trap of selective service that has made Daniel's flagship lose one of its NY Times Stars.

4.0,8/4/2013,"This was the last dinner I had during my visit to NY, and with my limited budget for traveling, I just had to squeeze in a fine dining experience, and what prompted me to choose Nougatine over Le Bernadin (the lounge) was the fact that there is no dress code requiring a blazer.Having a late night dinner here, I found the staff to be remarkably friendly (hostesses, and wait staff), something one would expect from fine dining but don't usually get in places out here in Los Angeles.  I loved the ambiance -- the chicness and simple design and architecture, makes this casual dining spot a wonderful place to take your time and enjoy your meal.  Since this was the week of the heatwave, I opted for some lighter fare:  Foie Gras Brulee and the Lobster Burger.  The meal began with a nice amuse: a sweet corn and jalapeno fritter nestled on top of a basil and pea emulsion.  Nice little spicy bite to kick off the night. FOIE GRAS BRULÉ, ROASTED STRAWBERRIES, AGED BALSAMIC - Foie gras mousse infused with macerated strawberries on a slice of brioche and topped with caramelized sugar and a side of strawberry balsamic reduction.  This one of those dishes where you'd think to yourself, ""I'd be winning to pay more just to get a larger portion...""  The tartness of the strawberries and the sweetness of the caramelized sugar both work to offset the super richness and the creaminess of the foie, and the flavors all are enhanced in your mouth with every bite.  LOBSTER BURGER WITH GRUYERE, GREEN CHILI MAYONNAISE, YUZU PICKLES. Those pickles were out of this world... sweet and slightly tart.  They added a wonderful umami-ness to the dish.  It was very flavorful with good bits of lobster throughout the patty.  It was also light and refreshing to eat.  Perfect for this night.  It came with French fries, but I had them substitute it with a side of Mesclun greens instead.Simple late night dinner, but I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  Next time back, I will have the tasting menu in JG....",3,0,1,Sklar T.,"Monterey Park, CA",1291,862,11021
4.0,8/2/2013,"We went a few days ago (7/31/13). Had expected to enjoy the restaurant week menu but instead decided on the tasting menu due to the limited selection on the restaurant week menu. A little pricier, but definitely worth every penny. John David, our server, was so knowledgeable about the food & it's ingredients the  techniques & its pairings, that we thought he might be a chef posing as a waiter. The Foie Gras was so good (I don't even really like foie gras in general), the salmon was cooked to perfection, the radishes complimented to tuna tartar so well with the ginger soy sauce. And of course, the beef was tender and spicy (there was habanero in the sauce) & delicious. Met Jean Georges himself (!!!) while he was walking back & forth thru the restaurant. Discussed the meal, appropriately showed my excitement to meet such a brilliant culinary artist. He was friendly & humble and was apologetic for the fact that we were seated by the door that kept letting in gusts of air when opened. So apologetic in fact, that he sent us 16 (yes, 16!!!) desserts to try.

Decor is classy but casual, not too modern or memorable. The service is a bit over the top, being greated by men wearing full suits was a bit ackward and only necessary for the wealthy yet insecure crowd. However, the table service was attentive and helpful. I had the watermelon soup, skate, and chocolate cake with ice cream. The watermelon soup was extremely refreshing but a bit too spicy for my taste. The skate was incredible as was the chicken I tried a bite of. Desert was also excellent.

4.0,7/29/2013,"My mother's birthday was coming up, and since none of her children really live at home anymore (and wouldn't be around for her special day), I decided to take the day off and come to NYC to take her out to lunch. I had to choose a special place, and after much searching decided that Nougatine would be perfect. We arrived for our 1:15pm reservation and were immediately seated inside since the weather was grey and threatening to rain at any moment. We could somewhat see the open kitchen and the chefs there preparing each dish. My mother loved the interior design, very sleekly modern but without feeling cold despite the use of grey throughout the room. Even though it was Restaurant Week, I told her to order whatever she wanted so we went with the a la carte menu (yes more $$, but its my mother's birthday!). To properly celebrate, we both ordered drinks - I had a lovely, light glass of prosecco and my mom had their cucumber mint martini (delicious and STRONG). She wanted to share dishes, which I was perfectly happy to do, so we ordered three appetizers, the tuna tartare, kale salad, and foie gras brulee, and one entree, the cod. We had the tartare and foie gras to start, and the tartare was delicious and light, creamy avocado mousse beneath the fresh, raw tuna that practically melted in our mouths, and the ginger-soy sauce had a slightly kick from the ginger that was fantastic. The foie gras brulee was fantastic - the salty, creamy foie gras had bruleed strawberry slices on top, and when I cut a small piece discovered more strawberry pieces inside! The sweet-salty combination is my favorite, and this dish is that to a T. Although I think less strawberries inside would've been a little better to get more of the foie gras flavor, but the balsamic reduction helped in that respect.The cod and kale salad came next, and both were delicious. The cod was so perfectly cooked, it could've masqueraded as Chilean seabass, and the yuzu-miso glaze on top added a nice amount of sweetness. The roasted zucchini and maitake mushrooms were delicious in their simplicity. The kale salad was a revelation, and from now on I'm shredding kale that same way for salads. The lemon parmesan dressing had a spicy kick from the jalapeno pieces scattered throughout. Yum! We were too full for dessert, which was fine since we had just eaten like queens. The service we received was great, water refilled without asking and food came out in a timely manner.

4.0,7/23/2013,"I need to make a check-list of all the Jean-George restaurants I've been to in NYC because I am seriously losing count. That being said, Nougatine was definitely by far my favorite of the bunch in terms of flavor.My friend Brittanie and I decided to treat ourselves to a fancy lunch at Nougatine for no particular reason. Nougatine is located basically within the Trump on Central Park West near Columbus Circle. We had predetermined that we would have the prix fixe for $32 which for lunch is honestly the best way to go- you're seriously saving yourself $20.To start, I had the Tuna Tartar (Avocado, Spicy Radish, Ginger Marinade). The tuna red was bright red and that marinade was fantastic. It was tangy and complimented the subtlety of the fish.For my ""main"" I went with the Crunchy Baked Organic Chicken with Glazed Market Carrots since I was having a weird craving for fried chicken. The chicken had a fantastically crunchy coating on the outside and juicy meat on the inside- no dry meat here! Like the tartar this dish had another amazing glaze sauce that made me want to pick the plate up and lick up every last drop. I don't care if it's not appropriate restaurant etiquette! To end with, I had to go with the famous molten chocolate cake. Fluffy cake on the outside, hot molten center on the inside that just oozes once you cut into it. I really wanted a glass of milk after that much chocolate intensity.I enjoyed my lunch treat here at Nougatine immensely and will have to come back when it's warm to enjoy the outdoor patio area! Definitely a must try.Note: Do not go here if you have a very limited amount of time for lunch... service is more along the lines of ""let's take your time while we create delicious food for you"" rather than ""let's get these girls back to work"" which is fine except when I really do need to get back to work!",18,7,10,Leslie D.,"New York, NY",1565,656,1217

Dessert of the valhrona chocolate cake was a perfect decadent end to the meal.  The only issue was when I asked for more still water, the person refilling brought over a cup of hot water...communication issue maybe?  But then when she came back to refill my cold water, she also poured the same water into my friend's glass of sparkling water therefore diluting it.  Although she offered to bring a new sparkling water, my friend didn't want to impose and declined.  But at $7 for a small bottle of sparkling, I would've expected that they would know to check before pouring.  Please note that sneakers and shorts are not allowed even though this is the more casual side.",1,1,1,Joyce Z.,"San Leandro, CA",336,943,8415

The food and the service disappoint and I wouldn't go back.We went for dinner on a weekday, and ordered glasses of wine and the 5-course tasting menu ($88/pp). We had hopes for a comfortable, casual, but nice dinner out. However the food and service were lackluster and the whole evening felt like we were eating at Jean-George's 7-year old kid sister's restaurant. The two of us with for dinner, wine, and tip came out to around $265. You can do much in NY for a similar price-point and ambiance/experience.SERVICEBasically, don't talk the talk if you can't walk the walk. With the snooty reception at the hostess desk, I thought I would be in for an evening of impeccable French service. I was very wrong. It took almost 10 minutes to get our drink order in. After I asked for the five-course tasting menu, my server asked me what else I would like to order. I had to ask her if the tasting menu was insufficient food..? She didn't ask how we would like our salmon and steak courses prepared, and we had to grab her before she ran away without taking our preferences. In general, the servers (lots of them) move around looking like they don't know what to do next. It's hectic, unorganized, and is a detriment to the dining experience. FOODThe two courses I would eat again are the tuna tartre, and the dessert (molten chocolate cake, rhubarb tart, and passion fruit sorbet). These tasted good, and were presented well. The ugly duckling of the tasting was the salmon. I am not exaggerating when I say it looked like a piece of salmon covered randomly with vegetables that came out of a frozen mixed-vegetable pack (see photos). It looked like...something you slap together when you get home at 11p after a long day of work and you just threw together leftovers from the fridge.  There were green beans, lima beans, long slices of some white and orange vegetables (like pre-shredded from Trader Joe's or your Chinese take-out), snap peas sliced in random diagonal shapes,  asparagus and green beans chopped in varying lengths, all just poured on top of the salmon in a semi-deep bowl. I know I'm harping on this, but it just looked ridiculous coming from a kitchen with the name ""Jean George"" on it. Just in general, the salmon and steak came out luke warm (not freshly cooked), and the steak was poorly seasoned (strangely sweet and uneven peppering) - like airplane food. The fois gras appetizer was okay.If quantity is what does it for you, however, you won't be disappointed - the portions are as large as the food is untasty.",7,4,0,Kimmy T.,"New York, NY",20,97,79
5.0,5/5/2013,"It's fantastic!!! Definitely one of the best for the lunch price in NYC. Go for the prix fixe menu, and try the sweet pea cheese soup. The most creative and tasty soup I've ever had. My friend recommends tuna tartar as well. As for the entree, the pork (from the a la carte menu) is a little bit hard, but the sweet sauce and cabbage make up for that. The cod is nice, perfectly cooked. I'd say that if you're in the mood of chocolate, try that 'cause the vanilla ice-cream is a little bit creamy.Very nice vibe, on the first floor of trump international.

I expected more unique choices, not just your basic ""one fish dish, one chicken dish"" etc. I did enjoy my lobster burger with frites, but my husband's gemelli (pasta) was just OK and so was the tuna tartare. The couple at the table next to us returned the foie gras to the kitchen, saying that it was ""disgusting"". The wine list was ridiculously priced, for the most part, but I will say that the two bottles we tried at the bottom end were both quite good (there were 4 of us!!).

The caramelized beef tenderloin with spinach gruyere crêpe was good and the flavors complemented each other but it wasn't the most memorable dish. Overall, I would recommend going here for brunch.

5.0,3/25/2013,"After poring over Yelp reviews in a desperate attempt to figure out where to take my mother to lunch last weekend, I stumbled upon Nougatine, a restaurant that sounded both fancy and affordable, and is only a few blocks away from my apartment. Reservations were already fully booked, but we figured that if we showed up right when it opened at 12, we had a chance at getting non-bar seating.Luckily for us, we were right! Stepping into the narrow entrance, we were greeted by three immaculately dressed people standing behind a small table. They told us there were definitely seats at the bar and maybe a few tables left, had someone take our coats, and then one of them brought us to our table (probably because we were dressed decently well, seemed like people in jeans were seated at the bar).After being seated at a table overlooking the park, we both decided to order the $32 prix fixe lunch. I had the Tuna Tartare and my mom ordered the Duck Confit. The tartare was pretty. I loved the nice touch of the radish slices on top of the tuna, which there was more than enough of. I wasn't expecting the spicy kick, but enjoyed my dish. My mom's Duck Confit though was definitely the winner. The duck was perfectly crispy and the lentils were perfectly seasoned and so delicious. For the entree, my mom had the Roasted Red Snapper and I had the Sauteed Skate. I was once again surprised by the slight spiciness of the skate, but enjoyed it. The brussels sprouts added the perfect textural and flavor balance. My mom's snapper was also delicious and I thought the texture was done particularly well. Then came dessert! I ordered Jean-George's signature Warm Chocolate Cake and my mom had the bread pudding. I'm actually not a huge fan of molten lava cake, but could still appreciate the pleasing aesthetics and taste of it. While eating it, I thought of an old episode of Master Chef where the chefs had to bake the perfect molten lava cake, a rather difficult feat. Cutting into mine, I know that it would've definitely survived the elimination test. The ice cream rolled in cookie crumbs was delicious, though I'm pretty easy to please on that front. I personally am not a fan of pineapple tasting desserts, but my mom really enjoyed hers.All in all, Nougatine did not disappoint! The food was great, the service professional and attentive, and the wait was just the perfect length of time.

2.0,3/3/2013,"Came here for Restaurant Week Winter 2013. My experience here was - what a joke! As soon as I stepped in the restaurant, I just remembered I had been here 4 years ago for RW as well, and boy it wasn't a great experience. Since my friend highly recommended, I walked in with an open mind. After we checked in, they took our coats and we stood in the lobby area waiting for our table. I couldn't help but noticed there's this lady at the entrance securing the door to the dinning area. It was a windy cold night, so if the front door to the lobby was opened, the door to the dining room would force open by the wind also. So the lady was there to make sure that the door was secured and no one get slammed by the door. And I almost became the victim when I went out to use the restroom. Can't they just install a door closer? It's so dangerous!!Ok, let's talk about the food. We both had the butternut squash soup. It was decent, nothing memorable. The portion was too big, I didn't finish it because I didn't want to ruin my appetite. Also, because I saw another dinner was having a really nice piece of salmon, and I also ordered the salmon, I couldn't risk getting too full to enjoy my main course. Then, our salmon came. It looked nothing like the other diner's. His salmon was definitely not from the RW menu. It looked like my dining hall salmon from college, where you grab your own tray, pick your biggest piece of fish, and wait in line for the cafeteria lady to pour you gravy. I'm not exaggerating, please see my photos. It absolutely did not look appetizing. A huge piece of salmon (two servings) sitting on top of some soupy sauce (the sauce actually tasted good, had a little acid in it). The yellow stuff was mashed potato and butter, yes, melted butter. There was also white stuff (protein) on the salmon, isn't that a big no-no? The brussel sprouts on top tasted like cabbage. Whatever, let's just eat dessert. We both ordered the molten chocolate cake, but the waiter brought out one molten cake and one banana cake, that was a surprise. He said he'll bring us another molten cake and we could just enjoy the extra one. My friend wanted to take pictures of the desserts so I was anxiously waiting, the chocolate smell was so intense that it made my mouth water. Finally, I got to eat it, but the flavors weren't there. What a disappointment! It smelled so good, how could it taste so bland?? To my surprise, the banana cake was absolutely delicious. I was so grateful that the waiter made the mistake of bringing us the wrong dessert, or else it would really be a waste of the night. To sum it up, I will never come here for the RW menu again. They don't take it seriously. I also dislike the RW menu at JoJo. Anyway, when I have become rich one day, or when I have tried all other restaurants in NYC, I might consider trying their regular menu. * Jean-Georges appeared in the dining area that night.",0,0,0,Nicole L.,"Manhattan, NY",14,10,9
5.0,3/1/2013,"My brother took my sister and me here during restaurant week and I was absolutely thrilled. I think when we came here, they were training a waiter or something, because there was slight confusion in presenting our amuse bouche, but it didn't really distract us from our meal. Other than that slight confusion, service was excellent, friendly, and informative.The amuse bouche (?) was a little puff of something, which I remember to be warm and comforting, as well as some sort of miso tea. Delicious.Our appetizer was some sort of tartare (don't remember the name), but it was delicious. The fresh herbs and the lime juice really shone without over powering the fish, and I sopped it all up.For the main course, we all ordered salmon. It was medium rare - the inside was just barely raw. I loved it. It was silky smooth, and the spinach and passion fruit sauce just blew me away. I loved how well balanced each dish was and found nothing too overwhelming.For dessert, my siblings got a molten chocolate cake each (which just looked amazing), whereas I got a cinnamon roll with ice cream. The cinnamon roll was a little  dry and I was unable to finish it, but the ice cream was tasty. The chocolate cake my siblings got just oozed out chocolate and I was jealous.I love how it's a more affordable restaurant by Jean Georges, yet the service and food does not diminish with the price.",1,0,0,Sarah K.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",471,264,25

3.0,2/26/2013,"BEAUTIFUL RESTAURANT. The decor was spot on. It was clean and bright, but warm and welcoming at the same time. The tables near the window had a great view of Central Park and the Time Warner Center. Too bad the sun/glare made sitting there really uncomfortable. We actually asked to be moved soon after we were seated. Luckily, the restaurant hadn't filled up yet, and they were able to move us to a more comfortable spot in the restaurant. Service here is impeccable. Very polite (not really friendly) and super professional. They take your coat at the front before you even walk into the dining room. We came in for lunch and took advantage of the pre fixe menu. At $32/person, it's a steal! Each meal comes with an appetizer, main course, and dessert.What we ordered:Shrimp Salad: Delicious! The flavors and the textures were phenomenal. The shrimp was so fresh, and the champagne vinegar dressing was addicting. It was such an amazing combination of flavors in this seemingly ordinary dish. One of the best dishes we tried.Tuna Tartare: Gorgeous plating. It was served with this ginger dressing and chili oil. I didn't really care for this. I've had much better tuna tartare at other restaurants. The dressing didn't add anything to this dish. Meh. Looked way better than it tastedSnapper: Great dish. I loved the leeks and sweet garlic lemon broth. The fish was really tender and the flavors were great. Slow baked salmon: Not the best. The ginger chili sauce wasn't very special. The salmon was a little dry. Didn't care for this dish at all.Jean-Georges warm chocolate cake: Served with really yummy vanilla bean ice cream. Super rich dessert, but very delicious!Bread pudding with roasted pineapple and condensed milk ice cream: Definitely the better of the two desserts we tried. The bread pudding was rich but not overly so. The pineapple added a really nice tartness, and the ice cream was dreamy! Probably my favorite dish of the day!Overall, a really pretty restaurant with some hits and some misses. 3.5 stars, but I am rounding down because there are just so many delicious restaurants in NYC.",0,0,0,Emily C.,"Los Angeles, CA",651,447,315

1.0,2/22/2013,"My husband and I were just at Nougatine tonight and were greatly disappointed by the dismal food quality. First, the butternut squash soup was extremely salty, then I had to send back the crunchy baked chicken not only once, but twice due to the extreme toughness of texture and the very hard, dried out shell, as if it came right out of a microwave. the dressing was so sour to the point I cringed. My husband's roasted beef tenderloin completely lacked flavor; there was only grease and garlic. We were both so turned off that we skipped dessert and left. With sending dishes back we never had a manager come over to our table for feedback nor did we receive any type of apology. The bill was also certainly charged at full price. With this embarrassing experience my husband and I will never recommend any of our out of town guests to any of your restaurants... We would send them to David Bouley, Daniel Humm, Dan Barber, but never ever again Jean Georges.Kudos to the nice waitress who tried to rectify the situation even though it was ultimately the kitchen's fault.",0,1,0,Varuca S.,"Manhattan, NY",8,22,42

The service from beginning to end was impeccable with a formal presentation of each course// DRESS CODE // They do not enforce the jacket requirement for lunch anymore, but men should still wear a collared shirt and no jeans. Half of the male patrons at the restaurant were wearing full suits for lunch and it was a Saturday. // FOOD //      + Amuse bouche: Carrot puree which was incredibly refreshing      + Tuna ribbons with sliced radishes, avocado mash, and soy ginger marinade: My favorite. The delicate cuts of tuna were wound into a beautiful display and the ginger marinade which was poured on by your server at the table complemented the fish wonderfully      + Hamachi with yuzu avocado sauce and shredded radish: The hamachi sashimi was so fresh. The yuzu made the avocado mixture very tart which I loved and the presentation was beautiful      + Fish on summer vegetables: The fish was buttery, fresh, and incredibly succulent     + Parmesan-crusted organic chicken with spinach: Loved the texture of the fish which was crunchy on one side and incredibly soft and tender on the other     + Complementary desserts: Vanilla bean marshmallows, assorted chocolates, and macarons with raspberry cream: I do not care much for marshmallows but it was fun to have them cut and served to you from a huge glass jar filled with sugar. The macarons were bite-sized, delicate, and had the perfect texture.

2.0,2/15/2013,"Had to get this out of the way. So last night was Valentines day. One would expect a nice dinner with good service at an establishment such as this one. Hassle free and pleasant. No.First of all, made the reservation on Opentable, they require a credit card to hold it, no problem. Then a few days before the 14th got a call from Nougatine saying I must fill out and sign and send to them a guarantee form allowing them to charge me like 100$ if I don't show up. First of all this is a bloody inconvenience to have to print, sign and scan and it HAD to be done before the end of THAT business day. Am I supposed to drop everything so I can give them peace of mind that no matter what, they will get some kind of cash out of me. So we show up at 8:30. Table not ready we join the growing waiting crowd at the bar that is overfilled with customers trying to have a pleasant dinner without being bumped into by servers and managers. It's ok, Wouldn't mind having a drink, that's what they expect you to do. 15 minutes goes by, 20, 30. I'm getting a little upset, my fiancee is in Heels, no place to sit, hostess told me ""Just one more moment"".So finally after 45 minutes of waiting we sat down. Not the best way to start the night. Also a hostess offered a party of 3 a round of drinks on the house, but not us, or anybody else that we saw. Maybe we didn't wait around long enough like a bunch of fools?So a fast positive note. Food was excellent, wine was excellent. Service - Not. Either this place is under the workers union or something, but those servers clearly couldn't give two shits about if you are enjoying yourself or not. But whatever..Time for the check, I didn't ask for it, it was put on the table. I was still finishing my wine and they had the nerve to ask me FIVE times if they could take it. I think I had the right to take my time at the table after waiting around for 45 minutes. And the nerve that the lady in grey had to say that people are waiting! So now it's my problem that they overbooked the place? That I should bend over for them? People don't dine anymore, they just eat. Dining is an experience and a process, conversation, laughter discussion. But no. More and more upscale restaurants just herd you around like goats snatching at your wallets smiling at your face and spitting in your back after they think you were rude to them for trying to enjoy oneself. All in all, food was excellent. Tuna tartare, red snapper delicious, soup and lobster fantastic.

4.0,2/8/2013,"Me and Ms. E went here for lunch. Lunch is considerably cheaper than dinner, which is good because the economy hasn't been all that favorable for primates in the last year. As happens in establishments like this, the waiter felt a lot better than us mere mortal lunch guests. Maybe this was also because His Holiness thought he knew about wine, which he didn't. Or at least not about the the bottle he recommended to us. In short if you go here for lunch, the appetizers are truly great, and better than the main dishes. Next time we'll probably substitute mains for a second round of appetizers. The tuna tartar is excellent, and so is the duck confit.

5.0,1/23/2013,"Came here for Restaurant Week and my total experience was amazing.  This restaurant is probably the best RW restaurant I've ever been to in all my years of dining during RW in NYC.Right when you walk into Jean Georges, you feel like someone special.  The host welcomes you with a polite smile and immediately takes you to your table. The service was a bit slow at first, but picked up later on.As if RW wasn't enough, we got a complimentary amuse bouche which consisted of a fried risotto ball and broth on the side that had bits of bacon in it.Appetizers:-Butternut squash soup with black trumpet mushrooms: this soup was amazing.  it was creamy and delicious. It had bits of butternut squash that just added a little extra to this soup.-Tuna tartare, avocado, spicy radish, ginger marinade: Very fresh and delicious, although we were all wishing that it had sesame oil in addition to the ginger marinade (#firstworldproblemsforasians)Entrees:-Slowly cooked salmon, brussels sprout fondue, truffle vinaigrette: AMAHZING. Since it was RW, I was surprised at the size of the salmon.  It was fairly large, but perfectly cooked.  When I thought of brussels sprout fondue, I thought it was a creamy sauce made of brussel sprouts, but it was shaved brussel sprouts.  I LOVE truffles and the truffle vinaigrette was perfect in bringing together the taste of the salmon, brussel sprouts and the mashed potatoes together. Needless to say, we all scraped every morsel off our plates.**There was also a chicken entree on the RW menu, but we all ordered salmon.Dessert:-Jean Georges' warm chocolate cake vanilla bean ice cream: Light, warm, delicious.  Perfect with the vanilla bean ice cream.-Caramelized banana cake, crunchy praline, caramel ice cream: I love anything with bananas on it.  It had real banana slices on top of the cake and the caramel ice cream went splendidly with the cake.-Butterscotch pudding with creme fraiche and shortbread cookies (complimentary): it was pretty foodgasmic.  It had a layer of caramel goodness on top of the butterscotch pudding and a scoop of creme fraiche on top.At the end, they gave us some chocolates and ginger/citrus jelly candies.  I absolutely love how they give us more than what is offered on the RW menu.

3.0,1/20/2013,"I went here for a weekend lunch with a group of 5 and was the last to arrive. They told me my party was already seated and that I should check my coat and would then be walked to my table. Very fancy. The staff was ultra polite, barely cracking a smile. Once I was seated, I looked around and scoffed at the fact that there were a couple of people wearing jeans. After being warned by the friend who made the reservation about the dress code, and having a couple people drop out because they were nervous and a bit incensed at this requirement, I couldn't believe that the rule wasn't fully upheld.In any case, my friends already had drinks and when I looked at the menu, I was shocked at the prices. Considering the lunch prix-fixe price of $32, cocktails cost  nearly 2/3 of that. The server came around and explained everything in a clear and pleasant manner and then took our orders.I selected the Butternut Squash Soup with Black Trumpet Mushrooms, the Crunchy Baked Organic Chicken with glazed market Carrots and the Warm Pecan Cinnamon Bun with Espresso Ice Cream and Crème Fraiche Frosting. When the first course came, the server announced what we had in front of us and I found the soup presentation, being poured at the table, neat. The portion was on the larger side for a starter and the flavors were at once sweet and savory. Once we were finished, the server asked if she could take away our plates, which I found to be quite genuine. The entrees arrived and I was very shocked at how small mine was, especially since the soup had been big. There was a tiny piece of golden brown chicken sitting on top of, no joke, five pieces of glazed red carrots. Five. I cup them up several times so I could have a piece of carrot with every bite of chicken. The sauce was sweet but had sharp mustard-y notes which I found too strong. The chicken was moist and the crunchy part was quite good. The dessert was appropriately sized, I felt, and tasted great. I did find that I kept having an empty water glass in front of me and had to flag someone down a couple of times.  Ordinarily this wouldn't be a big deal, but considering the type of service they are trying to achieve, it was unusual.Overall, I enjoyed my meal but found myself needing 2 slices of pizza within two hours!",1,0,0,Diana Z.,"New York, NY",63,35,38

I felt the need to do this because never have I ever had such bad service in a named restaurant in New York. I took my visiting family for brunch hoping for a relaxing and quality family time, instead, it was a big disappointment.Getting seated - great, but always make reservationsMenu- great selection of prix fixe dishes, brunch menu is pretty regular no surprisesDrinks- freshly squeezed OJ were good but it's only half a wine glass (quite small for usual OJ portions, but no complaints about taste). Can't say about wine because my family doesn't drink.Food- as i remembered they had great food for prix fixe.  I would highly recommend the duck confit, red snapper with sweet garlic sauce, and the chocolate cake. The flounder was fantastic also.Service - OUR WAITER WAS HORRIBLE!!! He was rude and had an attitude. He spilled water on the table and instead of cleaning up right away, he just said sorry and left to service other tables, never came back.  I had to ask another person to take care of it.  He was also very unprofessional or maybe simply too lazy to walk around the table and keeps on rudely reaching his arm over the table to place the plate settings. I complained about the waiter to a gentleman in suit, he promised that the service for the rest of the meal will be great, but it didn't happen.  The service was still slow and he still had the attitude.  I ended up leaving a 18% tip anyways because I didn't know if the servers split tips and didn't want to harm others.  All other servers were great and smiley EXCEPT for ours. Atmosphere - great location, nice view of central park by the windows. However, there was a table of tipsy looking women who talks/laughs extremely loud.  We didn't say anything until it started sounding like we were in the middle of a Flea market.  Noise level did not improve after we complained.

I sat at the bar, since I had no reservation.  The bar was a great place for people watching.  I was able to presence JG making his entrance, greeting and chatting with the gentleman sitting next to (he must be a regular customer), and walking into the open kitchen, turn around, and survey the Restaurant from his ""mission control"" area.Later on, I realized that I was at the JG-Nougatine.   Jean Georges (the 3-Michelin Stars) and Nougatine share the same location and entrance.  Even though there are 2 kitchens,  supposedly the Chef is the same.   Half of the place is dedicated to the ""formal dinning"" being Jean Georges, and the other half a little bit more ""casual"" Nougatine.  The two dinning areas are adjacent to each other.  It is like an airplane with First Class and Business Class.I am definitely coming back.  I wished that I lived in NYC just because of JG.(1) Appetizer: Tuna Tartare w/ avocado.  Fresh, soft/buttery and creamy with light/refreshing flavors. (2) Entree: Roasted Snapper, broccoli rabe, leeks & sweet garlic lemon broth.  The snapper was cooked perfectly - moist and flaky.  The sweet garlic lemon broth was a revelation for me.(3) Dessert: JG warm chocolate cake, vanilla bean ice cream with chocolate shortbread crumbs.  I am not an ice cream person, but this ice cream made me a convert.  The vanilla taste was exquisite.  The ice cream did not feel heavy or too sweet, but rather fresh.  And most importantly, the chocolate shortbread crumbs complemented the ice cream flavor and texture marvelously.",2,0,2,Ana C.,"Pasadena, CA",108,129,453

4.0,11/25/2012,"If you're planning on going to Nougatine, don't circle around the Trump Tower a few times like I did as I tried to locate the restaurant based on my Google Maps directions. Pro tip: it's inside. I came to the restaurant as a result of Yelp friend Jordan S. as I was in town and wanted to meet up. When I had finally found the place and him, we stepped into the pre-function area in front of the hostesses and I felt a tad bit of unease. Why's that you say? I best describe it as a scene from a dystopian film where the service staff is straight-backed, clad in nondescript, stiff black uniforms, pale in complexion, and adorned with bright red lipstick except in this case, it wasn't a movie. I'm not saying they were unwelcoming but their low, dulcet tones made me suspicious of entering a sterile, conformist world.I digress. Let's just say that there were much too many staffpersons with all the same distant (but still courteous) demeanor that made me wonder if this was the world of those upper-echelon diners. The ceiling-to-floor windows by which we sat allowed for an ample amount of photograph-friendly lighting (though whipping out a camera to snap shots of the food seemed a little faux pas) but deeper into the restaurant were some more dimly seating arrangements. I'd say the look was a tad minimalist with a hint of ""What are you doing here if you aren't in a certain tax bracket?"" Have I gotten across yet that I felt like I should be more elite in society than just a Yelp Elite?Anyhow, if you take away that overhanging feeling, you come down to the food. My Google Calendar told me I was there for brunch with Jordan but feeling disinterested in the brunch options, I (and he) chose the $32 prix fixe three-course lunch. As compared to the other menu options, this was quite the deal. After putting our orders in, we sat with some slices of bread and I played briefly with my coat check number. The conversations around us made me conscious that I was here for a one-off meal instead of being a regular in their society. I find so much amusement in these situations though - it's fun to poke fun.All of our food was brought out by two waiters (so much service right?), one of which explained the dishes while the other set them in the appropriate interaction in front of us. I say interaction because my starter was the butternut squash soup with Shiitake mushrooms and when the bowl was set in front of me with its artfully arranged microgreens and tiny cubes of mushrooms, I was surprised by the ruination inflicted upon the delicate fungal tower as one of the waiters poured a steaming flood of the butternut squash soup itself over it. I sadly missed my opportunity to photograph the beauty before the storm but alas, there was no forewarning. The soup itself was less creamy than I expected of a butternut squash soup and a tad too salty but I did quite enjoy the mushroom pieces and bright taste of the greens. Jordan's tuna tartare sat upon a bed of creamy avocado (floor level was a ginger marinade) and was topped by delicately sliced radish. I jabbed at the dish by calling it tuna on guac but it was merely in jest as the tartare was very fresh and soft, the avocado flavorful but not overbearing on the star of the show, the radish crisp, and the ginger marinade sweetly spiced. Curse the goodness.The entrees came next of which mine was the crunchy baked organic chicken with glazed market carrots and his the cheeseburger with crispy onions, Russian dressing, and a side of fries. Again, a bougey meal is no fun unless you can cheerfully insult your atmosphere so my first remark on my chicken was that it was covered in cereal (see: Rice Krispies). I kid though - it was fantastic. The crunch on the chicken was phenomenal and the juiciness of the meat trapped beneath the crispy exterior made me wish I had had so much more on my plate. I did away with the chicken quickly and worked more mindfully at my glazed carrots but they, being excellent as well, were dispensed of in short time too. Jordan's cheeseburger did not bear the brunt of my bite but he did enjoy it well; unfortunately the French fries did not withstand the elite test seeing as we both found them too similar to fast food fries.Desserts arrived in all the pomp and circumstance I'm sure was required. My sweet finish was their black mission fig financier with cinnamon ice cream, spiced almonds, and fig jam while his was Jean-Georges' warm chocolate cake with vanilla bean ice cream (way to make the dessert description as monotone as your waitstaff...). I was glad to have had the cinnamon ice cream to offset my dessert as it was sweeter than desirable; overall, a light end that closed off the meal well. The warm chocolate cake was airy but still heavy in flavor and the ice cream perfect. Overall the meal at Nougatine was success and I'll definitely remember the juiciness of that chicken; maybe next time I'm around, I'll feel more comfortable there.",3,3,3,Minerva T.,"Pflugerville, TX",234,331,1863

The best dish is the tuna tartare - but it is minimally different from hundreds of others across the city (tuna tartare in the shape of a circle on top of an avocado purée) and far more expensive. The desserts here are good and reasonably priced ($10 each) - so perhaps a good place for coffee and a dessert - but no more.

The decor was less than impressive, reminded me of an airport, but the view of the park was gorgeous as we were there in November and the leaves were changing.  My biggest surprise was the bathroom!  It was dirty, smelly and just gross.  Very disappointing for such a fine restaurant.",0,0,0,Sarah K.,"Park Slope, Brooklyn, NY",0,4,0

How they do it boggles my mind. Salmon and chicken, you've had it everywhere but never the way its done by Jean Georges. Super moist and succulent chicken and salmon done just right. I found myself going back to the salmon bc of the crust and sweet chili sauce. Amazed at how good it was and how i've never had anything like it, even though yes, its chicken and salmon.

5.0,11/15/2012,"4.75 starsOn a cold, wintry, but still only a fall night, we entered the side of Jean-Georges which at the beginning looked like his red-headed step-child, an almost bare bottom, homely looking also ran.  But as the servers appeared and things started rolling along, my expressions cracked more and more with the ""O"" face smile, and we lived happily ever after. The amuse bouche of a soy-marinated salmon and also a warm shot of celery root soup with a cranberry cream froth kicked off the foreplay. Appetizers:  The tuna tartar was so PURE, so melt in your mouth outstanding, served with a fabulous ginger sauce with paper thin sliced radishes atop drizzled with chili oil to add just a touch of heat.  The foie gras was silky, the smoothest, the creamiest, served with a caramelized fig top and a side of fig jam you really did not need as it would have taken over the self-identity of the decadent liver flavor.Entrees: The perfectly tender and temperatured pork chop was grilled (or hot roasted) with prosciutto seared right to the top, on a bed of mixed ultra-flavorful mushrooms and related rich mushroom-y sauce, which with a touch less salt would have been the best pork chop dish I have had in years.  The flavors jumped right off of the plate at you.  Even though it was very filling, I wanted more it was SO good.  The salmon over bok choy was really really fresh, tender and cooked perfectly.  A wonderful presentation just topped off these dishes.Desserts: These took us over the brink. The extremely flavor-filled warm apple tart tatin with ice cream, and the butter scotch pudding, with butter and scotch as two separate words as the dessert was served in two separate layers of creamy indulgence.The servers were very professional and courteous, and most of all they were there when you needed them.Now I need a nap!",8,8,7,Brian H.,"Township of Lower Gwynedd, PA",67,329,0

4.0,11/9/2012,"Nougatine is a bit of an oddity for Jean-George Vongerichten; a man who shamelessly, playfully melds cuisines, pandering to the younger crowd? At times, surveying the dining room, one cannot help but wonder why. Minerva and I remarked that we were by far the youngest, as evidenced by our severe lack of furs and egregious amount of hair remaining on our heads. The elongated bar, sweeping down the length of the room towards the kitchen, while impressive from the consideration of an architect or interior designer, serves more to bisect the room into the haves and the have-nots. The have-nots in this instance being those viewed as undeserving of the ample light afforded by the massive windows at the immediate front of the restaurant, sequestered as they are to the place beyond the runway. Essentially, the long, narrow walk simply felt too dramatic for the space itself. It felt even more dramatic given the flitting nature of the service. We were greeted by four hostesses when we arrived, shown to our table by one with another waiting in the wings, and asked for our coats by the two of them nearly simultaneously. Too much service (yes, there is such a thing) renders one uncomfortable. When there are so many servers congregating in the aforementioned narrow path, eyeing the room with a distinct lack of subtlety, the uncomfortable feeling can become pervasive. I am not entirely sure if this state of affairs was a temporary one, as when I'd visited in the past, Nougatine's front of house and service in general felt far more cool, approaching effortless. If it was additional staffing as dictated by the canceled marathon, then it is a small oversight. If it is a new direction in which the restaurant is going, it feels a bit foppish. Foppishness that is not aided intrinsically by its confines: Trump Tower. Thankfully, however, as at another Jean-George restaurant, the nouveau, hip appearance belies the familiarity and substance of the cuisine. The two of us decided to forgo the traditional brunch menu, and opt instead for the prix fixe lunch, which at $32, is no longer the steal it once was, but is still more than fair. For my appetizer, I elected to enjoy the tuna tartare, enjoy being the optimum word. I have yet to meet a better rendition. The finesse with which it is plated has lost a step, but the fine grain of the tartare is still in a class of its own. The simple ginger, sesame and soy marinade that accompanies it is not quite as world-beating, but its presence is nonetheless a welcome one, particularly when the avocado foundation begins to collapse; creating a richness you won't want to leave on your plate. Minerva's butternut squash soup, unfortunately, was a bit too salty for both of our palettes, leaving the bright medley of fall funghi and vegetables submerged in an inhospitable broth approaching the salinity of the sea. A shame. An in all likelihood, an outlier. However, we were not in the mood to send it back to the kitchen, as we joked that doing so would probably send our neighboring diners into a fervor at our apostasy. As a simple caveman at heart, I had ordered the burger, and a soda. Of course, since this is Jean-George, the soda was composed of yuzu and blackberry. It was as wonderful as it sounds. It also fared beautifully in offsetting the surprising saltiness of the fries. I never thought I would encounter something so close to those slung from beneath the golden arches in so upscale of an environs. The burger on the other hand stuck closer to its bourgeois setting.  Though its crispy onions and Russian dressing screamed proletariat, the final product was sufficiently refined to pass muster in our surroundings. The beef was perfectly cooked, as to be expected, and the cheese melted to an appreciable level. The one element I could have done without would be what felt like three trillion sesame seeds, but I could be underestimating. Each bite left my plate looking as though I were trying to plant crops. Sadly for whoever saw that dish at the conclusion of my meal, I was ravenous beyond caring. Minerva chose the far more dignified half roast chicken, a dish that I believe is available at every JGV restaurant, and of which I have never seen a poor version. Moist as always, lurking beneath a skillfully toasted, cereal (grain, not Cheerios) covered crust, perilously ensconced by a languid pool of bitter, salty, acidic sauce - a sauce which only drives the eater to slice swirl more of said inferred chicken within it, pungent and potent though it may be.I had been puzzling over how to fit Nougatine into Mr. Vongerichten's opus: his failings(V Steakhouse), his background(Jojo), his triumphs(Jean-Georges) and his experiments(Vong). It was only over dessert that Minerva deftly summed up my silent musings. Upon seeing our desserts, the careful, calculated manner with which they were crafted, she sighed ""How can we eat with all this drama?"" and with that, my vexation ended. Nougatine is his new star.",7,4,7,Jordan S.,"Manhattan, NY",865,273,672
5.0,10/31/2012,"I like this place.  A lot of places do not allow you split a prix-fixe meal ($78) with your significant other, but this place allows it.  I'm impressed.  Maybe they don't allow it over on the formal dining side of Jean George's, I guess I'm glad I chose the more casual yet still classy Nougatine's instead.  The highlights of my prixe fixe included:Foie Gras: Best foie gras I've ever had in my life.  The top had a caramlized sugar on top which made it that much more delicate.  The fig jam that it came with really melded all the flavors inside your mouth.  Hands down, this was the best dish at nougatine!Tuna Tartare: Tasty and contained slight flavors of 5 spice.  This seems to be Jean George's signature spice as a few dishes had that ""5 spice"" flavor to it.Beef Tenderloin: Quality of the meat was top notch.  Mouth is watering as I type lol.Salmon: Cooked perfectly, but it didn't really stand out to me.  It consisted of a LOT of asian flavors and ingredients such as bok choy and chili oil.Pork Chop: We ordered this in addition to the prixe fixe.  The pork chop was tender, juicy, and grilled perfectly.  Need I say more?Dessert Trio: The chocolate cake, sorbet, and butter scotch pudding was a great way to end the night.  I will definitely visit this restaurant again next time I visit New York.  Just a note though, if you don't ""request"" the check, expect to sit there all night.  I guess they have more of a hands off policy here, which I don't mind because you definitely don't feel rushed.5 stars.",1,1,0,Kelvin C.,"Brea, CA",176,1162,1147

2.0,10/18/2012,"First of all, let me set the scene. This was a prix-fixe, pre-theatre menu and a birthday treat for my wife. So, a major disappointment in such an open-plan restaurant with views of Columbus Circle and the open kitchen to be given the only table that was hemmed in with a wall on one side and a partition forming the ""aisle"" entrance to the ""big"" Jean-Georges next door, where guests awaiting their own seating lounged and ""chatted"". They might as well have sat at our table! And, we were only the 2nd party seated that evening, at 5:30 pm!After the 'amuse-bouche' and the appetizer, we waited nearly 20 minutes for the main course. When I reminded the waiter that we were going to the theatre, his reply was: ""Well, it's not until 7:30."" He had just assumed a show time and let the meal be timed around that; he had not asked. Our show time was actually 7:00 PM. The manager said, ""Well, we are a bit rushed now."" So were we, practically gulping down our main course and dessert and getting to the theatre just as the bell for curtain was ringing.The amuse-bouche and appetizer were delicious! The tuna tartare was extremely fresh and flavourful. The dessert was a delightful surprise of creamy, melting chocolate inside a pastry, served with ice cream. Unfortunately, these were offset by a piece of chicken that was ""just chicken"", baked in a ""crust"" that was burnt in places and served with carrots in a very tart and bitter ""sour sauce"". No time to ask for a piece a bit less overcooked.All-in-all, not much of a ""treat"" and, based on the Vongerichten reputation, a major disappointment. Not the sort of intro that will encourage us to try his more upscale offerings.",1,0,0,Jim B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,21,0
3.0,10/17/2012,"Having been at Jean-George's formal dining room last month, I expected Nougatine to also sweep me away with its flavors and presentations.  It turned out that I was a bit disappointed.  Nougatine was definitely good but maybe my choices weren't the greatest since I opted for the A La Carte menu instead of their lunch prix-fixe of $32.  Ordered:1. Foie Brulee- I got my foie fixe again which I will never complain about.  It was a tad too much for a lunch portion but that can easily be fixed with more bread baguettes to eat with. 2. Cheeseburger with fried onion strings and russian dressing- This was juicy and cooked to my liking: medium rare but I didn't feel like there was anything OUTSTANDING about this burger.  I felt like I have had better gourmet burgers before.  It also comes with a side of fries, which I felt like it was too salty for me.  I just needed some type of red meat that day and yes, I got it!I also got the chance to try my friend's fried calamari appetizer, which by the way comes with a superb basil salt, citrus & chili frothy sauce.  The sauce made the dish!  Lastly, the warm chocolate cake wasn't too rich like how they usual are.  Anything A La Mode balances out chocolate well.  Service was up to par as Jean-Georges.  Very friendly and attentive.  Our reservation ran behind but we were able to sit at the bar to start off with some brunch cocktails.  Also, it was definitely fun sitting by the open kitchen in the back of the room, where you can see where all the action and the art of putting the dishes together happen.  Definitely one of the better Michelin rated cheap eats to enjoy in NYC!",3,0,1,Kathy D.,"Sunnyvale, CA",2136,1124,541
5.0,10/16/2012,"After taking down the delicious frog legs, I was left wondering how to clean my sticky fingers. They brought a bowl, filled with lukewarm water with rose petals. I dipped my fingers in and laughed. This place is so good, it's hilarious. There is an energy and liveliness in the dining area of Jean-Georges that is unlike any other restaurant, including any other three-star Michelin. Perhaps its the intimate and gorgeous dining room. Or the large windows overlooking Central Park and Columbus Circle, with trees ahead trying to sneak a look. Or perhaps it's the general giddiness that overcomes anyone who gets a table here that fills the air.  Sometimes indecision leads to the best decisions. We got both the Signature Tasting Menu and Seasonal Tasting Menus.

There aren't enough adjectives to describe the dishes. The oyster cracker, tuna, and pea soup might be the best amuse bouche in all of Manhattan. I have never had better scallops. Or frog legs. The turbot is bested perhaps only be Chef Eric Ripert's Le Bernardin. The squab was shear perfection. But it's that darn finger bowl, that's when I lost it. Service is what you'd expect from a three-star Michelin. Jean-Georges is located at the ground floor of the Trump Tower, in Columbus Circle, mere minutes but fittingly walking distance from other giants, Per Se, Masa, and Marea. Their lunch special might be the best deal and steal in NYC. At the end of our dinner, we saw Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten standing at the doorway.

Come on, jean George does the best chocolate cakes, although I would definitely go to Jojo over nougatine to be honest. The Tuna tartare had A ginger sauce that kind of overpowered the natural tuna texture. the flounder was good paired with parsnip chips and lime, but overall it was a little too light or my taste. The chocolate cake, of course, was to die for. My friends all had the fig financier, which looked amazing too. Jean georges doesn't mess with his desserts, which makes me an even bigger fan.

3.0,9/30/2012,"This was to be my first visit to a Jean George's restaurant and i was quite looking forward to it when my friend suggested Nougatine for a Sunday dinner during my recent visit to New York. However I came away disappointed. Nougatine is located just next to Jean George's flagship restaurant at Central Park west. The venue is classy with a business casual dress code. We arrived at 7 in the evening ... our request for a somewhat earlier time slot having been rejected. The person who was waiting on us seemed to be new and not used to this restaurant. My friend was unable to drink and when she asked whether they could make some non alcoholic drink for her, she was merely redirected towards the juice section of the menu. Thankfully she had told them at the time of reservation that she was a vegetarian (the menu has almost no vegetarian item). So her food had already been taken care of. We didn't have time to try the tasting menu ($78 for 5 courses). We went for the a la carte menu. It started well. We got some kind of popcorn juice as amuse bouche. It was delicious. For starters, we shared a portion of artichoke with mustard mayonnaise, chervil and lemon. A full flower was served. It was difficult to cut through the scales to get to the edible heart. So it required too much effort to eat (relative to the enjoyment). A mistaken order on my part. My friend got Eggplant and peppers with puffed rice, and Squash and chanterelle salad, along with Silky tofu with black bean vinaigrette and Sweet corn and pea ravioli. It looked great. Unfortunately that's all I can say. She liked her food so much that I wasn't allowed to try even a single bite :(But I wasn't so lucky with my grilled pork chops with roasted potatoes and plum mustard. All the accompaniments, especially the plum sauce, were perfect. But the meat just didn't seemed cooked well enough. It was too tough in texture. The Jean George's chocolate cake was delightful, though the peach cobbler wasn't quite so good. We had ordered the cobbler on their recommendation. We should have stuck to the choices that we had made. The service left a lot to be desired. I was asked twice, quite unreasonably, whether I was done with my main course when I clearly wasn't. The chocolates arrived before we had finished with our food, and the bill arrived before we had even asked for it. It seemed that they wanted the table free (for another reservation perhaps) which was surprising since we had been there only for about two hours, which is much less than the time such dinners typically require. At only about $65 per person, the price was not unreasonable. But overall, the experience was mixed.

4.0,9/9/2012,"Without a doubt an interesting dinner.  Started on the wrong foot, but a responsive and friendly manager and a lovely evening with excellent food, made for a nice dining experience.Went on a Sunday evening for ""Fashion Plate Prix Fixe - September 2012"" lincolnbid.org/news/view…""Three Course Prix Fixe Dinner: $38.00 (Sunday - Friday only).""Arrived at around 7:30 p.m. and asked if they had a table outside and was told that they did (in fact, outside was pretty empty and it was fairly crowded inside).  We then asked for the  ""Fashion Plate Prix Fixe"" menu and the waiter had no idea what we were talking about.   He seemed to think I was thinking of Restaurant Week.   He then went to check and then came back and told us that they did have a $38 menu at that time but it was only available before 6 p.m. or after 10 p.m.  Somehow (at least to me) that does not seem to be ""Sunday dinner."" We were not very happy and asked to speak to the manager.  He left and was gone for some time.  In the interim, another server came up to us and asked if we were ready to order and we said we were waiting for the manager.  After a wait of approximately 10 or 15 minutes a very nice manager came over apologized for the problem and mentioned something about the prix fixe not normally being served outside.   We offered to go inside (which was actually much more busy as the outside was relatively empty), but he said outside was fine.  Frankly, this was kind of strange as the waiter who came over to us first was apparently totally clueless about the  ""Fashion Plate Prix Fixe"" (which was also promoted on signs in the neighborhood) and, as mentioned, had come back to us initially and said the only special was before 6 or after 10.Anyway, with that behind us, it was time to begin an otherwise lovely evening.  Nougatine inside is very contemporary and has a lovely decor.  Outside it has the luxury of a tropical resort (think Trump Florida perhaps).  But what is so amazing is you are in the middle of Columbus Circle looking at the TimeWarner center and Central Park South over a row of hedges. Definitely a great juxtaposition of views. That combined with a cool evening and the lights of the city and the setting was just perfect.Turns out that the prix fixe menu had no choices.  In fact, I had previously inquired by phone as to what the menu was, but the phone people had no idea so we went hoping for the best.  Well, we were offered a nice meal nevertheless. The appetizer was a Tuna Tartare, with avocado, spicy radish and ginger marinade.  Definitely not a favorite of mine, but my wife loved it and I enjoyed the part of it she did not eat.  She promised me her dessert.  Prior to the appetizer we were served an amuse bouche which was very good and  some good, but very basic bread.  It was not warm (which I am partial to) and was served with olive oil, which is always nice (and healthy too).  The entree was a Crispy Organic Chicken, summer squash, and roasted tomato vinaigrette (the later of which I passed on).  Lovely presentation and very flavorful.  The tomato sauce was spicy and  tangy.  Very enjoyable.Dessert was at least one of my favorites (and a signature choice of the restaurant)--the Jean-Georges warm chocolate cake, vanilla bean ice cream.  It is definitely a superb dessert.  Wish it were a little larger so more of the delicious chocolate would ooze out of it.  The vanilla bean ice cream was extraordinary.  Even if other restaurants today equal or exceed (on rare occasions) the warm chocolate cake here, the ice cream is usually an afterthought.  Here it is superb in its own right.  After tasting it, my wife only partially met her promise of giving me her dessert.The decaf coffee was served only with Truvia (for a sugar substitutes--no blue, pink or yellow packets for that lovely rainbow of colors in the sugar dish).  The service during the meal was fairly good, but I kind of got the impression that the initial problems at the beginning of the meal had a slightly negative impact on the service, but that is hard to tell.  Frankly, the last time I was here the service was somewhat indifferent and it was actually better this time.Still, a great night out with good food under the open sky (which started to drizzle ever so slightly as we were about to leave) made for a fine Sunday evening in Columbus Circle.",1,0,0,Randall S.,"Manhattan, NY",837,109,13

Seriously, this was good I was surprised they offered this on the RW menu.Entrees had the salmon and the roasted chicken. Salmon was good, juicy, huge.. Heh.. But wow, the chicken was perfect and i never order chicken! I'm more of a steak or seafood kinda gal. Crispy skin, yet so tender and juicy... Mmmmmm...... And again, the portions were generous.For dessert we had the chocolate lava cake, good but pretty standard. Also had the berry soup, very light and refreshing, a great way to end a meal.As if the free miso cod soup wasn't enough, they also gave free chocolates afterwards. I can't wait to go back to try their regular menu!If you're contemplating whether to come here or Perry Street, definitely come here. The food although very similar, Nougatine was the clear winner.",4,3,3,Tiffany S.,"Manhattan, NY",215,169,362

I had the parsnip soup, which was actually my favorite part of the entire meal. The skate I ordered was a tad too salty for my taste, but had nice flavor.

3.0,8/28/2012,"We went during the pre-fixe week; the food was amazing, but the service was not as good.We went at 6pm and were told that it was full so we were seated outside at 89 degrees, which was proven to be a bad idea. We ordered both the regular $78 pre fixe menu and the $38 special menu. The free appetizers: bread and the popcorn soup were fabulous, especially the latter. Appetizers: Tuna tartare: fresh and good (i was told)spicy yogurt soup: ew, it tasted like sour and spicy herbal medicine.foie gras: heavenly taste, just can't get enough. juicy, greasy on top of bread. Entree: Roasted Salmon: delicious and fresh (i was told again, i dont eat fish)Organic roasted chicken: big portion with crispy skin. tender and juicy.tenderloin: indeed very tender, could rival the ones in peter luger's (almost)dessert: chocolate lava cake and dessert tasting. not bad.two cups of wine as wellOverall the food was very good. However, the service of the manager and the lady at the front desk ruined everything! During our entree it started pouring so we had to go inside. But it was pretty full so we waited for her to seat us. We were the first table to go inside yet we were the last to be placed. The manager just kept ignoring us. When we questioned the lady (in a polite way) she gave us attitude and said because we came later than our reservation time so we had to wait. Excuse me, but you should not give customers attitude! Finally we were seated and our food was cold and we were in such a hurry because we had to be somewhere at 8. The service was friendly and courteous by other waiters. I would have given it a four-star had the lady and  the manager not ruined our experience.

5.0,8/19/2012,"I was actually impressed by their salmon.WHO MAKES IMPRESSIVE SALMON ANYMORE?! Very few places especially given that salmon isn't that incredibly difficult to make and there aren't that many variations of it.Came here for restaurant week and decided to give the menu a whirl. The plating was excellent - the color, composition & flavor balance actually stood out for both the salmon and the tuna tartare.Oh Nougatine, if you can make a boring dish stand out, I can't wait to try your full menu!",0,0,0,Siya L.,"New York, NY",70,26,0
4.0,8/19/2012,"The first thing to know about Nougatine is that it's impossible to find. My companion and I got to the address and found ourselves surrounded by horse-drawn carriages and street vendors. For a few minutes I looked for a ""Tavern on the Green""-esque location inside the park. Finally, we realized that entrance to the restaurant was inside the ""Trump International Hotel & Tower"", which of course is listed nowhere on their Web site. For those who don't know, Nougatine is sort of the ""Next Door"" version of Jean-George, which as of this date is one of the few restaurants to hold a New York Times 4-Star rating. While you need a fancy suit to enter Jean-Georges (as well as a second mortgage on your house), to enter Nougatine you just need to dress ""smart casual"" or ""smart elegant"", an oxymoron which apparently few of the patrons knew the meaning of: some were dressed to the nines while others were in jeans. I basically wore khakis and a polo shirt and felt right at home. As you enter the restaurant, you're taken to the bar-lounge area in the front, while the ""beautiful people"" are whisked to the more hoity-toity Jean-Georges in the back. I'll start with the caveat that this is a restaurant week review. I've always felt that Yelp should somehow separate the RW reviews from the regular reviews because I notice that RW reviewers tend to skew reviews down. The best explanation I can come up with for this is that the way RW used to be, a restaurant would put their best foot forward with their prix-fixe menus. These days, it seems that most restaurants just give you a ""value selection"" that leads to some disappointment and broken expectations. So take the rest of what I say with a grain of salt; had it not been restaurant week I would probably have notched it up a star. We were given both their regular menu and their prix-fixe menu. On the regular menu, appetizers will run you about $15-20, entrees average about $30-35, and their 4-course tasting menu with dessert tasting is about $80 (about half the price of the Jean-Georges tasting menu, but of course with choices like ""salmon baked with bread crumbs"" instead of ""lobster tartine"" and ""broiled squab""). We, of course, ordered from the RW menu.The wait staff we had was courteous and professional, although it was quite obvious they were the junior staff, probably in training to eventually graduate to the promised land of $100 tippers on the other side of the room. I counted a few gaffes, but because the environment was casual instead of reacting with horror we could have a nice chuckle over them. The evening started with a wheat sourdough bread which was excellent, followed by a shot of a very interesting palate cleanser consisting of a slice of cucumber with a dollop of guzu gel, along with a shot glass with a fascinating buttery gazpacho that contained miso and little bits of popcorn. Per our server, it was intended to create the sensation of a ""Persian pickle in your mouth"". I've never had a Persian pickle in my mouth, but I'll take his word for it. I ordered the ""Greek Salad"" appetizer, while my companion ordered the Tomato Gazpacho. The salad really didn't strike me as anything special that I couldn't get a a diner down the street. The gazpacho was good, but nothing special.For the entree, I ordered the Salmon baked with lemon crumbs, while my companion had the Free Range Chicken. The salmon was cooked to perfection, tender and juicy, covered in bread crumbs, and on a bed of swiss chard with sweet chili glaze. The interplay between the savory, salty, sweet, and bitter was interesting, although I could have done with a little more subtlety with the breadcrumbs. The chicken was fabulous; again, juicy and tender with a delightful crispy outside and covered with sliced radishes. For dessert we had the ""Jean Georges"" warm chocolate cake, warm because inside the cake oozes with warm liquid chocolate. It's a recipe that restaurants all over have tried to copy, but there's nothing like the original. The cherry cake was also very good, especially with the dollop of cherry ice cream. Overall, Nougatine offered a solid dining experience, a great location, nice views of the park, friendly service, and very good food. The little charges with drinks and coffee will add up very quickly, so you should still expect to pay a little more for the experience, but for the right occasion it's definitely worth it.",5,1,0,Steve L.,"Great Neck, NY",107,128,2
3.0,8/18/2012,"This place is alright. I came here for Restaurant Week, and when they handed me the menu I knew that it was going to be a very small preview of their menu, and I was ok with that. However, what I didn't know was that their menu, is also a very small preview! The menu, as in the full menu, barely has anything on it! Everyone at our table was like...is this all the stuff they have here? I mean, I would guess it's seasonal, but man, the selection is scarce.With that said the food is alright, or at least the stuff we got. The roast chicken was good, but nothing to write home about. One thing you do need to know, is that there's a dress code here. No jeans, no sneakers, and I'm pretty sure your shirt should have a collar. I had on jeans and pradas, and they said that we were ""ok this time."" So just letting you guys know.

5.0,8/17/2012,"This is my favourite lunch spot in the city -- the prixe fixe is a gift, a philanthropic act of public service. The Chef is always in, rarely not focussed on something in the kitchen. This is where the man works. The service is elegant, the room -- which just got a subtle, but alas not subtle enough -- minimal makeover is an oasis of calm off columbus circle. Floor to ceiling windows look into the green of central park. I've tried many things on the menu, the skate is memorable, but always come back to the basics. In fact, I now hardly veer. Tuna tartar with that ginger soy, the baked salmon that gave the man a name (with jalapeno and orange usually); and the the chocolate cake that made him famous. Their coffee is premium too. Not to mention their FRESH coconut water. I don't suggest trying the more formal dining room for lunch (I call that business class). The more casual cafe has a sexy bustle and a usually hip updown-downtown set. I stick to the economy plus cafe-room because it's more fun. Although the sourdough bread rolls in business and the fresh marsh mellow after dessert . . . make me want to reach for the phone and make a reservation just thinking of them.

1.0,8/15/2012,"Do Not Waste Your Money. Went on the restaurant week dinner last week. I am now at the end of my stay in NYC and nougatine was by far the worst dining experience of the whole trip. From being made to wait outside in the heat for 20 min (after our booking time, with no apology) to the completely impersonal service that we received, we were off to a bad start. From here, the night got worse. The 'Greek salad' starter was flavorless and something that I would expect at a friends BBQ with no cooking experience. The salmon entree was coated in a sweet chilli sauce that tasted like it came straight from the bottle. Very ordinary flavor combination with an overcooked piece of salmon. Definitely the low point of the night however came when my dessert was put down in front of me with a hair sitting on top. This would not be the end of the world if you are paying $10 for a meal and even then I would expect the waiter to be incredibly apologetic. Unfortunately, when you are at a 'fancy' restaurant paying a lot of money, i would expect much better. I never once received an apology. The waiter simply took it away and returned a few minutes later with another plate for me with a look on his face like I had inconvenienced him. At the end of all this my wife and I were hit with a bill for over $150 for a meal that did not even come close to comparing to the enjoyment we received from a $3 slice of pizza the next day. Avoid.

4.0,8/14/2012,"We came here for Restaurant Week and everything on the menu looked so delicious that we ended up ordering from the Tasting Menu and the Restaurant Week menu!Amuse bouche: warm miso soup with popcorn.  It was ok.  The popcorn was hard to get out of the tiny glass until I just ended up shooting it.  Then I almost choked on the popcorn.  My bad.  But it's free, so I can't complain that much.  Now, on to the main attractions:Restaurant Week Menu:- Greek Salad: Loved the mini roasted beets, but other than that, nothing exceptional.- Free range chicken: pan fried chicken that was crispy, flavorful and moist.  A healthy sized portion that had both white and dark meat and went really well with the pickled radishes and cucumber coulis.  The breast was still moist when I had the rest for lunch the next day!- Warm chocolate cake with vanilla bean ice cream.  Yum!  Molten lava cake with oozing warm chocolate served a la mode.   A great finish to a meal!The portions were good.  If we didn't get the tasting menu, I would have been able to polish it all off and it would have been perfect.Tasting Menu:- Tuna tartare: Fresh tuna atop some avocado.  The marinade was poured tableside so it wouldn't be swimming in it ahead of time and overpower the tuna and avo.  I thought that was a nice touch with the service and presentation.  The tartare itself was on par with what you'd expect of tartare.- Foie gras: Caramelized crust made it cripsy and sweet on the outside and rich and super creamy on the inside.  Top notch!  - Salmon:  Yum!  At our server's recommendation, the salmon was cooked medium-rare (which we thought was strange for salmon) but it was perfect.  I am not a salmon fan, but this was amazing!  The crispy lemon crumbs and chili glaze were the perfect compliments to the salmon.  - Caramelized beef tenderloin: Wow!  This entree really blew us away.  It was so tender that it melted in my mouth like butta and was so flavorful!  By far, the star of the meal!- Dessert sampler included salted caramel flan, red wine sorbet, and warm chocolate cake with vanilla bean ice cream.  The red wine sorbet was tart and really refreshing.  It was a nice, light ending to a heavy meal.  The salted caramel flan was extremely salty.  Blah!  We both had one tiny bite and couldn't take anymore.  It was overly salty through and through and had a crazy potent salty aftertaste too!  Warm chocolate cake was a mini version of the RW dessert and equally yum.The tasting menu was a lot of food!  If you come to Nougatine, the tasting menu really is the way to go.  You're getting to sample the best of what this restaurant has to offer.  Service was impeccable.  Our server seriously knew every little ingredient in each dish.Really enjoyable experience!  Highly recommended!",2,0,1,Sandee L.,"Discovery Bay, CA",235,494,105

4.0,8/8/2012,"Dined here August 4th, since I wasn't able to make a reso at JG less than 30 days out. But Nougatine is no consolation prize. It's wonderful all on it's own. I can only imagine what dining at JG would be like. My only 'complaint' would be our server. His smugness was palpable, but still polite. Such a peeve of mine when the 'help' gets uppity. And, I was shocked by the lacking in one major detail: No black napkins! I hate getting the lint on my black dress. The 'sommelier' was far more engaging. My friend loved the option to order 3 ounce tastes of various wines by the glass. It was fun to change it up with each course. We started with the tuna tartar and calamari. The tuna was a healthy portion, much larger than I imagined. It was perhaps the best tartar I have ever had and I've had many as this is my go to item. The paper thin sliced radish was the perfect texture compliment. The spicey ginger vinagrette completed a lovely profile of fat and acid. The calamari was good. The best part was the Sriracha aioli. What a great idea and it was perfectly balanced so one could taste all the flavors: lemon, garlic, chili pepper. Main dish was the black cod with a silky carrot purree, chanterelles and a corn 'salsa'.The colors and presentation were spectacular. The thin fillet of cod was more deep fried than I prefer. I like thicker cuts and pan roasted. It really needed a bolder sauce to be plated on, as the carrot puree did little. Oddly, my fave on the plate was the corn and chanterelles.  The big winner was my friend's entree: Grilled Berkshire porkchop with a cherry hot sauce. The chop was perfectly medium done and moiste. This chop was probably 2 inches thick with bone in! And, the cherry hot sauce was HOT, but so good and there were halved bing cherries along the plate. Hot and sweet!

4.0,8/5/2012,"My girlfriend had lunch here in July to celebrate a special occasional. Jean-Georges is a wonderful place to celebrate, as the staff really goes out of their way for you, without being pretentious about anything. The ambiance and decor of the dining room was also very nice, tho I imagine it would be a lot more intimate at night. From the moment we walked in and checked in at the hostess' stand, we were wished well, as we also were with every server who came to our table that afternoon.After being seated, we were brought menus and bread. The bread was brought around in a basket and we were allowed to choose from a few different kinds. The bread was also refilled during our meal, but not so much that you got full off bread before your meal arrived. After our bread was served, we looked over the food and drink menus. To drink, we stuck with water, tho I did have a glass of champagne before our meal. I can't remember what kind it was, but it was excellent and professionally served, with just a pour at first, before the entire glass was filled.As for our meal, we went with two courses. My girlfriend chose the Steamed Skate, which came with a New Onion Vinaigrette and Spring Vegetables, followed by the Beef Tenderloin. I chose the Sea Scallops w/Caramelized Cauliflower and a Caper-Raisin Emulsion, followed by the Parmesan Crusted Chicken, Artichoke Basil and Lemon Butter.Before any of our courses were served, we received an amuse - I really can't remember a whole lot about it, other than it was served in a shot glass (similar to what the amuse at Nougatine was served in) and had watermelon and cucumber on the side. The amuse itself had popcorn in it and was maybe a miso-ginger soup of some kind? I'm really blanking on this one, but it was quite good.As for our first courses, the scallops and skate were both yummy. Perhaps the scallops were a little thin and there were only three of them, but the carmelized cauliflower and caper-raisin emulsion complemented the scallops very well. As for the skate, it was a unique flavor - one that I was not used to, but I liked it. Skate may not be for everyone, but Jean Georges did an excellent job of preparing and serving it.Moving on to the main courses, the Parmesan Crusted Chicken - it was well prepared and yummy, but I found it to be rather standard and noting to rave about. My girlfriend's tenderloin, however, was on a completely different scale. She ordered it medium - I personally prefer my meat medium rare or rare - but even cooked medium, this was the most tender tenderloin I'd ever had. It literally melted in your mouth. Even if you wanted to chew this more, you couldn't, since it melted. It was even better than the tenderloin that is served at Nougatine.Moving onto dessert, we opted just to have one dessert - the Market Strawberry Tasting. Made up of a Strawberry Red Wine Sorbet, Lemon Verbena Chantilly, Vanilla Sponge and a Balsamic Meringue, this dessert was heavenly, phenomenal and out of this world. I really can't describe it - try it for yourself. Any shortcomings that were present in any of the dishes were erased with this one dessert.As our lunch here was celebratory, we were also served a chocolate moose cake, with a raspberry in the middle, complete with edible gold, with white chocolate that had well wishes written on it. This dish also came with macaroons that were so-so. The cake itself was shaped like a small gift box and delicious, but there was one small hiccup. Being full from our meal, we asked our server if it could be stored in the kitchen fridge and be picked up later, when we were heading home. They did oblige us, but the dessert was accidentally thrown out. However, they did make us a new one, on the spot, without question.Jean-Georges is very upscale and elegant. It's one of those restaurants where it doesn't seem odd that different people come to serve you wine, bread, appetizers, entrees or dessert. The staff also has a neat system which they use to call the bussers over to clear a table - they simply place their hand on their left lapel. Classy!One thing that does mystify me about Jean-Georges - and Nougatine, for that matter, is their dress code. Both restaurants say no jeans, sneakers, etc, yet when I had dinner at Nougatine and lunch at Jean-Georges, I saw jeans and sneakers in both restaurants. Do they not enforce the dress code?So, what is preventing me from awarding a 5 star rating? Well, for anyone who saw the documentary ""Jiro Dreams of Sushi,"" it noted that a restaurant that has a 3 Michelin star rating is worthy of a trip to that city just to eat at the restaurant. While Jean-Georges was exceptional in terms of food, service and ambiance, I'm not sure that a trip to NYC is warranted for their lunch service. It's probably more likely that they receive three Michelin stars for their dinner service. Not to say that lunch was by any means bad - it was exceptional, but I wouldn't plan a trip to NYC just to eat here.",5,0,0,John-Paul P.,"Madison, NJ",68,149,839

4.0,7/31/2012,"So basically, I embrace Nougatine as the much more affordable side of Jean George but I have to empathize with the reviewer who had to deal with the ""stuck up little prick"".  I think that was the same guy that blew my surprise Mother's Day brunch by leaving a message that we had to reconfirm the reservation on the internet and then DENIED that we had a reservation when I called up to reconfirm a reservation that I would not have known about had he not called.  What's ironic is that HE was the very same one that called to say that we had the reservation.So apart from the ""stuck up little prick"" I love the Prix Fix lunches at Nougatine.  The service is not as overwhelming as in the Jean George enclave where five people hover over you and annoyingly scrape up every bread crumb you drop.The best trick I learned to having a good lunch without a reservation is to pick a summer day when it is warm, but not sweltering and there is a light breeze. The terrace is a perfect place to have a much more reasonably priced but still stellar food.  The umbrellas provide adequate shade and the view of Central Park is terrific.  I wouldn't chance it on a day when it might rain because the umbrellas do not provide full coverage.",0,0,0,Susan B.,"Manhattan, NY",6,4,0
4.0,7/30/2012,"After doing my homework for NYC Restaurant week and reading the glowing Yelp reviews for Nougatine, I finally secured a lunch reservation. My high expectations were mostly met. The setting is beautiful- the restaurant is located in the Trump Tower next to Columbus Circle and Central Park. There is an elevated dining area that gives you a view of Central Park, as well as an deck for eating outdoors. Decor is modern and charming- with the bar looking especially well-done. The clientele was primarily business people and couples, which lent a relaxing atmosphere to the restaurant. Be aware of the dress code- it is not mentioned on their web site. No jeans, sneakers, or shorts!The service was impeccable. From the bread person and the person who pulled up your chair before sitting down, to the waiters, everything was perfect and impossible to find fault with. After making a bathroom trip, my girlfriend came back to find that her napkin was neatly refolded and she looked at it curiously, not comprehending as she wondered out loud who had refolded it so nicely. Our waiter had a great sense of humor and timing when bringing out our meals, which helped make it more memorable. But on to the real reason why you're reading; how was the food?We ordered from the restaurant week menu. The tuna tartare was outstanding. Fresh raw tuna was perfectly blended with avocado, radish, ginger glaze, and a mystery spice to add just the right kick. This was the highlight of the meal for me. For entrees, I ordered the crispy chicken, GF ordered the salmon. Both were of high quality. The chicken was moist, flavorful, had tasty skin, and nicely soaked up the pureed tomato sauce it came with. The salmon, while also good, was not quite on the same level; the sauce was tasty, but the fish was inconsistent. Some bites were delicious, others not so much. Portion sizes were surprisingly large by restaurant week standards.Dessert consisted of a warm chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream and a cherry cake with sour cherry ice cream, candied poppy seeds, and buttermilk jam. Of the two desserts, the chocolate cake was the clear winner. It was soft, had a gooey chocolaty center, and practically melted in your mouth. The vanilla bean ice cream was the perfect complement. The cherry cake was less impressive. It tasted okay, but definitely seems more like something you can find at a local bakery for a more reasonable price. The sour cherry ice cream however was great- it was gone within two minutes!While the food didn't quite blow me away like I was hoping, the location, atmosphere, and service are still enough to earn Nougatine a solid four stars in my book.",2,0,0,Ben H.,"Manhattan, NY",11,72,3
5.0,7/30/2012,"I just ate here for Restaurant Week. It was hard to find a table online, but after looking a few dates, an 11:45 reservation popped up! I've been to other Jean-Georges restaurants before and had always enjoyed the quality of food so I was looking forward to eating at Nougatine.As expected, everything was amazing. Service was top-notch. They accommodated my gluten-free request without complaint. I still ordered from the restaurant week menu. I had:- watermelon and goat cheese salad - really refreshing, with a mix of sweet, a bit sour and salty(the salad had olive oil with salt and pepper sprinkled on top). - roast chicken - delicious. they removed the panko breading for me, but the skin was so crisp, it still had that nice crunchy contrast.- sorbet. here was where they offered me the sorbet instead of the cake options in the menu. they gave me a very full bowl of sour cherry and strawberry and wine(?) sorbet. totally yum.Service wasn't rushed and the staff was very pleasant.

5.0,7/28/2012,"As the taxi stopped in front of the hotel, I was surprised to see someone open the door for me; I was then politely directed to the restaurant, where--as the first person of my party to arrive--I was promptly seated admist the perfectly set table and petite dining room.  As I waited, I glanced around the atmosphere and silently smiled at its beauty.Not long into my daydream within the dimly lit room and sunlight-filled windows, my friends arrived .  Soon, we were treated to complementary bread, which was a wonder in itself.  Each of us ordered off of the restaurant week menu, of which I chose the tuna tartare, crispy chicken, and chocolate cake for my three course finale to the end of the weekend.  Now raw fish is something I rarely eat, having grown up with parents who feared me getting food poisoning.  However, given the situation and classiness of Nougatine, I decided it was now or never, and I boldly--for the first time ever--ordered the tuna tartare.  After our waiters brought out the dish and pored the ginger marmalade, carefully circling the plated tuna to cover the entire dish, I took a big bite and was pleasantly surprised at the tenderness and freshness of the tuna, marveling the entire time on how I could not tell it was actually raw fish.  My only complaint is that the texture needed more variety; instead of avocado on the bottom, something crispy--something contrasting--should have been used.Always doing my homework on Yelp beforehand, many fellow writers mentioned that the crispy chicken was the best chicken they ever had, so there were high expectations, which were 99% met.  Filled with a sauce of roasted tomato vinaigrette and a layer of oil, the dish tasted like, what one friend called, summer.  Though usually I am not a fan of leavening oil on food, this worked and it actually did the magic of painting a picture in my mind (to which Vivaldi's Four Seasons played within the background); even two weeks later, I still imagine the refreshing nature of the dish.And the glorious dessert.  The chocolate cake came with the molten fudge inside still steaming, and the soft, rich complexity of mixing ice-cream.  The mixed berry soup, however unique in concept, tasted quite ordinary, just a notch above your classic fruit salad.  Throughout the meal, there were complementary little dishes, such as crunchy popcorn miso soup, some cucumber dish my mind refuses to recall the name of, and dried fruit / chocolate as complementary dessert.  Petite, delicious little pieces delighting my tongue, delighting me.",1,0,2,Buggy Z.,"Cambridge, MA",242,307,748
5.0,7/26/2012,"Jean Georges!! I love you.. Jojo and Nougatine.. they both never disappointed me!!! And thanks for doing Restaurant week that allows me to PAY LESS & have the same experience..Many restaurant's quality of food just goes down during RW.. but not at Nougatine by Jean Georges.. First start of..4 of us at the table ordered the Tuna Tartare.. I guess it definitely sounds more appetite than the salad on the menu.. This is the best ""tartare"" I have ever had.. I love tuna and avocado.. when they are match together = PERFECT!! The soft texture of tuna with a little sweet/sour/salty and also the avocado below it.. it's a really unique taste.. my friend prefer to have something crunchy below.. but I love it this way.. Nom Nom Nom.. I just finish it within seconds..Entree.. I ordered the salmon and rest of my friends ordered chicken.. at least I get to sample the chicken.. I actually prefer the salmon I ordered.. this is the best salmon.. it's better than the one I had in Jojo.. they served it with corn pancake below.. It's the best side for you after salmon.. It's lightly sweet.. Just the way I like it.. The crispy chicken was amazing too.. We were guessing what sauce is that.. perhaps balsamic and some tomato?? lol.. I don't know.. I don't really care because it tasted good as well.. One of my friends said that this is a really good dish for summer where you just want a light dish and enjoy the weather instead of something creamy.. I kinda agree..Dessert.. even though it's just a normal warm chocolate cake.. it was actually served WARM.. and you can see steam coming out from the cake.. with a scoop of vanilla bean ice-cream.. OMG.. HEAVEN!!! I had the cherry berry soup.. this was nothing special but it's a good dessert for berries lover.. something not so heavy after your entree..The chef welcome us with a shot glass of corn soup and cucumber with some sauce on it.. (the waiter explained it to us but I forgot).. the corn soup was amazing.. there's pop corn in it instead of the yellow corn.. It's really unique.. at the end.. we even had complementary chocolates & sweets at the end!! OMG.. Thank you!!Service was amazing as well.. They explained every dish to us and make sure that everything is ok on our table!!Getting A table is Difficult!!!! So just make a reservation as soon as they announce the participating restaurant!! You can't GO WRONG WITH IT!!! :D I will return to try their tasting menu some time..

All the dish was well-balanced and light.  The portion of the entrees was bigger than expected for a French restaurant and for restaurant week.  The crispy chicken was much better than expected.  My poached salmon was phenomenal though, with the perfect combination of sweet chilli glaze (that reminds me a lot of Vietnamese and Thai food) and Swiss chard.The dessert came like 20 minutes after our main course was done.  I believe the waitress forgot about us.  They were good, but i have had better desserts, so not very impressed.It was late and I didn't want to eat too much so I asked to have my food to go.  The waitress came back with a ticket so I can pick up my food from the front desk!  We can enjoy the rest of our desserts without having to worry about a food bag on our table.  That was one of the highlights of our night.  Other than that, the waitresses and waiters are attentive but not friendly.  We had good food, but the whole experience was somewhat underwhelmed.",0,0,0,Lan D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,18,0

4.0,7/4/2012,"3.5 but I round up.The good-Scallop sashimi on crispy rice is good. I'm a sucker for raw scallop though.Fois gras brule w/ strawberry is like pb&j on steriods. Kale salad, huge portion, and nicely done if you're down on kale.The boring-Pan seared cod was to be expected.  Decent, but wasn't knocking my socks off with the flavor.Soft shell crab, I have to say wasn't as crispy as I would have liked (as with the lobster), but it could be that I was dining al fresco on a 90 degree humid night and nothing stays crisp under those conditions unless you're frying with Crisco lol.The bad-Lobster was slightly overcooked. Anyplace else, that would be a smaller minus, but it's JG's place and they should know better.Amuse bouche had good mozzarella but the little cup of chilled pea soup with creme fraiche was over salted. Again, JG's place- they should know better. Would prefer none instead if they can't do one right.The terrace- outdoors. Remember that you are a stone's throw from the Park, the subway station, and the buses going up and down Central Park West. On a summer night, you will experience bus rumbles, flies, and mosquitoes. That last one, a lot. Better time would be early Fall.The Ugly-Donald Trump's building is one gleaming beast of bad taste. Sitting outside reminds one how ugly it could be. The dining area is obscured by hedges that were meant to hide the back of the big lit sign Trump International Tower.  Such a shame that Park view was sacrificed over a building sign.  The inside dining room is ok, though. BUT, one has to walk up the ugly gold railed stairs at the building's front entrance to get to the maitre 'd's desk, which actually looks like a hotel front desk in bulk and height.  Sigh. JG can't fix that, save for moving.Overall, probably deserves 3 stars for sloppiness rather than the 4 I'm giving, because of the ""they should know better"" factor. But even sloppy, JG's people manage to put out a meal that most NY restaurants would not be able to surpass.  I'd stay away from the entrees (although I hear the steak is fab) and make a meal out of the appetizers and desserts.

3.0,5/18/2012,"Perhaps I just walked in with too high of expectations, but Nougatine really failed to impress... I'm sorry Jean Georges, but so many of your restaurants are really hits or misses. While the dining room (or should I say bar room) is airy and beautiful, overlooking the same open kitchen that churns out food for the actual Jean-Georges dining room, the service at Nougatine is just not up to par. The kitchen was very backed up during our lunch on a Thursday, causing a lot of lag time in between courses, and the servers themselves were very aloof and unattentive. In fact, I almost had to flag down our server a few times just to ask for refills on water and to voice concerns about my food (but more on that later). What also upset me about the service was that an incident occurred in the kitchen where a server accidentally dropped a plate - the male manager immediately stormed in and scolded the poor girl. It doesn't even matter whether the kitchen is open or not (as all the diners could essentially see and hear his scorn), but I don't think it's appropriate to ever scold your staff like that... Not cool!Besides that scuffle, the food itself probably had more low points than high. Most of the appetizers we had: shrimp salad, fried calamari, tuna tartare, and asparagus salad ranged from being just okay to pretty bland. My shrimp salad comprised of just three shrimps atop boring mixed greens with a overly sweet champagne vinaigrette - it was unlike a typical $7 salad at any Japanese restaurant. My entree of sauteed bass was so terribly raw that I had a difficulty time cutting through the flesh and had to send it back. Thankfully the kitchen sent out another plate (except about 10-15 minutes after so that I basically ate my entree alone as the three people dining with me had already finished theirs). Both desserts on the prix-fixe lunch menu, chocolate cake and vanilla panna cotta, were pretty mediocre as well. The ""signature"" JG chocolate lava cake tasted no more special than any other molten chocolate cake I've had, and got quite boring after three bites. The panna cotta was well-made as to be expected from such a exclaimed establishment, but the flavors were pretty one-note; for some reason stewed rhubarb compote is just not special anymore, almost as pedestrian as strawberry nowadays. The one redeeming factor about our lunch was the complimentary dessert the chef sent out (as an apology for my undercooked fish entree), which was a sour cream cheesecake with hibiscus sorbet that was much tastier than our official desserts. Unfortunately everyone was too full (or just too fed-up) at that point to really enjoy that free dessert.Sure, $32/pp may be a pretty good deal for a ""fine dining"" establishment such as this, but I'd honestly rather take myself somewhere a little more ""casual"" for better food and much better service.",2,1,1,Cecilia Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",762,644,43
4.0,5/17/2012,"I had the honor of having dinner at this posh restaurant tonight. The place definitely has a unique 'one of a kind'  interior design. Modern, clean, trendy and a nice ambiance. The maitre d' was definitely making sure to keep up the sophisticated theme here, by welcoming us in a cordial, somewhat stiff manner. Then again I think that all of this is part of the 'Welcome to the amazing restaurant of Jean Georges-show.  And speaking of Jean Georges: He made sure to show his face in the restaurant a couple of times that evening, along with that charisma that he has. Of course we had to start with an interesting looking 'amuse de gueule', consisting of a shot glass containing a green fluid substance served alongside of a mini-cracker with a drop of something on top and underneath it. The bread that was served is okay, but nothing worth mentioning here, The appetizers.My friend had heavenly tasty foie gras as an appetizer. I ordered a tuna tartare. It was more of a tuna 'tarte' to me, given the vinegar-like taste of the dressing that it came with. I also missed something crunchy with my dish. Normally a tuna tartare is served with something that you can sort of scoop with. On the other hand, the foie gras was downright. phenomenal. Next: Main course.I had the black sea bass, and my friend went for a lobster burger with gruyere, green chili mayonnaise and yuzu pickles, served with a side of thin, crunchy, perfectly salted french fries. This time around I had the better dish. The sea bass  was served with some mixed vegetables, albeit a marginal 'you're in a chique restaurant, so small servings only'- kind of amount. The lobster burger was a bit chewy. It tasted 'interesting', but nothing to order again in the future. And then : Dessert.The desserts were amazing. We ordered Jean George's warm chocolate cake and the banana foster ice cream sundae banana brulee. Both desserts looked very esthetically pleasing, and both tasted delicious. Speed of service: Lentement. Take your time. It's French style ; ). At least you're not rushed out of the door here, that's for sure!  Be prepared to spend a few hours here. Would I go back here?

2.0,5/13/2012,"Underwhelming. We were received at the front of the restaurant by a few uninterested individuals who called themselves the maitre d'. Forced smiles and glazed looks. Tables were pretty close and a lot of movement from 2-3 different servers caused some disruption and confusion for the length of our meal. Appetizers were quite substantial portions. Our party ordered the pea soup, tuna tartare and foie gras brûlée. Pea soup was not great, tuna tartare was not great, and the foie gras brûlée was great up to 2 bites and quickly got really boring. I pretty much don't remember my entree except it was cod and it was salty. Some green stuff it was perched on and some more green stuff strewn over it. The other 2 entrees on the table were salmon and pork. Salty as well and in all honesty did not taste like there was much skill involved.

We walk in and there is someone immediately there to take your coats, the host and hostess were very sweet and professional. Our waiter was amazing, just very kind and sweet, and yet professional. There are always about 3 people hovering around, our water glasses never reached below half full and our wine glasses were refilled before we even got near the bottom, silverware was replaced between each course and the best part to all this, you barely even realize it's happening. The staff is amazing as to not even interrupt you in the middle of a sentence, it's almost as if everything was just magically appearing. The food was amazing. We did the tasting menu, which consisted of 5 courses. Started off with tuna tartar which was so fresh that it melted in your mouth. We then moved onto the foie gras (i'm not a big fan of that dish to begin with) which was good but not my favorite course, then came our salmon which was mouthwatering, then we moved onto the beef tenderloin which was very juicy and we ended our meal with the dessert sampler which was heavenly.I would absolutely dine here again.

5.0,4/6/2012,"I went for Restaurant Week in Winter 2012, and felt Nougatine at Jean Georges was nothing short of spectacular.  The service was impeccable; from the moment I walked through the door to the moment I left, I felt the staff was attentive to my needs.  The dining area is big, but not too noisy, and they have an open kitchen, which I always find interesting!They started us off with Amuse bouche - sweet potato soup with cranberries and apple - and a crème fraiche and cucumber.  At first I was disappointed when they brought it out, thinking it was the smallest Restaurant Week appetizer ever, but quickly turned my frown upside down when the waiter told us this was compliments of the chef.  I thought it was yummy as I am quite fond of sweet potatoes.Next was the actual appetizer - tuna tartar with avocado and a soy miso glaze.  Firstly, the portion size of the tuna tartar was huge!  Definitely not something I'd expect from a fancy restaurant (which I feel generally serve teensy portions).  Secondly, it tasted great - not fishy, and the soy miso glaze really complimented the tuna.For the entrée, I had the salmon with swiss chard and potato puree with sweet chili sauce.  The salmon was nicely done, with the sweet chili sauce being sweeter rather than spicy.  I didn't eat the swiss chard, but the potato puree was nicely done.For dessert I had the parfait (my friends had the chocolate cake which they said was earth shattering - but I don't like chocolate so the earth didn't shatter for me).  A perfect way to end the meal.",0,0,0,Cici L.,"Manhattan, NY",8,41,10

Then came the moment of the night, for me at least, Caramelized Foi Gras just blew me away, I can still taste it everytime I read my little girls Mrs. Wishy Washy and see that tasty duck. My wife wasn't a huge fan, but to me that dish overshadowed the rest of the evening. The salmon was delicious, by the time the tenderloin rolled around I was spent.

First off the positives, service is excellent (and our waiter was incredibly friendly, a refreshing surprise compared to similar establishments) and the setting is very nice as well. However, the food doesn't hold up to the reputation and the prices. Had the two scallop starters and while decent, the sashimi came with a strange and unfitting crispy rice cube. The duck, a staple of French food, was mediocre and the sauce awful. The cod was a good fish but the sides were a thorough disappointment. Perhaps most surprisingly, I found the dessert to be poor. Nothing special and probably below the standard of a normal French restaurant - trying too hard to be creative at the expense of being tasty. Even the cookies were weak.

4.0,2/10/2012,"Given the fame of Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten and his suite of restaurants, going to Nougatine for Restaurant Week (RW) was a no brainer. Although I was a little disappointed to see such a limited selection on the RW menu (only 2 options for each course), each one was prepared with careful execution, so they definitely went the route of quality over quantity. We were started off with an amuse-bouche which was a cremini mushroom drizzled with sauce paired with a shot glass of rich creamy chicken soup with tarragon. Hearty and delicious.For appetizers, my friend and I both chose the seared gulf shrimp with butternut squash, ginger, & basil. The shrimp were perfectly grilled and really yummy with the butternut squash purée. I was also pleasantly surprised that we were given 4 large shrimp, when the norm during RW is a measly two.For my entrée, I had to choose the salmon as I do not eat beef, which was the only other option. While I wasn't wholly excited about the description (slowly cooked salmon with braised carrots, olive, black truffle, and dill), the dish was better than expected. The salmon was cooked perfectly and quite flavorful. However, it was pretty small - no bigger than the palm of my hand. I was also not a fan of the carrots with the olive & black truffle purée (and I LOVE the taste of olives). It just tasted weirdly tangy - almost kind of sour. Dessert was pretty good as well. We tried the molten chocolate cake with vanilla bean ice cream and the upside down pineapple cake. I liked the pineapple cake better as it was a little more unique and the chocolate cake was the slightest bit crispy on the outside which threw me off. Appreciated that we also got complimentary tiny gelée squares with two small chocolate strips as an additional sweet after our dessert. As for service, one of the best things about going to a high caliber restaurant is the top-notch service and Nougatine certainly did not disappoint. We were asked if we wanted more bread without asking for it ourselves, napkins were folded if we got up, nobody rushed us with the bill, and my friend even had a metal cover covering her food when she left the table to keep her dish hot. Overall: Pretty good food, but felt the entrées & dessert were lacking some creativity. I would have given them a 3.5, but bumped up for the stellar service.Note: I immediately noticed there was absolutely no music playing in the restaurant which was a little disappointing.

4.0,2/9/2012,"Restaurant week menu? Or regular? Choosing which menu to eat from was quite the predicament last night. Both sides sounded appetizing however more in favor of the regular menu which had lobster burger, prosciutto wrapped pork chops, foie gras brulee, and fresh Maine lobster. As oppose to salmon and beef tenderloin. We opted for the RW menu for reasons unknown::: maybe cause our main purpose of going to RW is to take advantage of the RW menu?We started out with seared gulf shrimp with butternut squash, ginger and basil and their market pear, peppered goat cheese with frisee salad vinaigrette. The cheese on  the salad was a bit too peppery however when paired with  the pear you can hardly taste the pepper. The shrimp was delicious in  itself but when combined with the tangy, gingery butternut squash puree, it was a perfect match. We followed the salad and shrimp with their  slowly cooked salmon and braised carrots with olive black truffles & my medium rare beef tenderloin with garlic parsley and chili.  Let me start off to say how kind the chili sauce was. It is not in any way harmful to your mouth but rather sweet and mild, went very well with the beef. My experience at Nougatine had been a good one.

3.0,2/2/2012,"I recently came back here for Restaurant Week and, I have to say, I walked away very disappointed.  I want to point out before going any further that this review (and my previous one) relate only to their R/W menu and should not be associated with their seasonal a-la-carte menus.In any case, I am of the opinion that when a Restaurant--especially one as esteemed as this Jean-Georges establishment--elects to participate in R/W, they should put in their best effort to impress.  Unfortunately, this was not the case.This was supposed to be the highlight of our R/W week--we made the reservations a month in advance.  Upon showing up, we were met with the same polished, professional staff.  The Nougatine dining room was unchanged, and we were seated promptly.  Then things went downhill.  The entire meal felt very rushed.  Our waiter was not the most pleasant guy, and it felt as though he were trying to get us out of there as quickly as possible.  There was little time in between courses--as soon as one plate was finished it was whisked away and replaced by the next course.Our appetizer was amazing--the Tuna Tartare here is massive.  I love tuna and was very satisfied by the amount I got.  The avocado bedding was a nice touch and I was half full afterward.  Some digestion time would've been nice, but our entrees came out almost immediately afterward. I have never been so unimpressed with an entree at a prominently rated restaurant.  The chicken came alone on a plate with a few pieces of asparagus.  It was dry, tasteless, and overall unappetizing.  I don't know who decided to feature this on the R/W menu, but I don't think Jean George himself would've eaten it if you paid him.  If I had seen this as a backyard BBQ I would've passed over it in favor of a hot dog.  In fact, if I weren't paying $35 for that stale piece of poultry, I probably would have asked for some honey mustard dip.Halfway through the entrees, a waiter dropped a wineglass behind me and some broken shards of glass flew onto the table (one landed squarely in my hair).  After that, any desire to finish the chicken evaporated.For what it's worth, the other entree--the salmon--was delicious.The desserts were also very good, including the chocolate cake which I am usually not a fan of. My advice--skip R/W and just go for the seasonal a-la-carte.  Better yet, go for lunch pre-fixe at Jean-Georges, it's roughly the same price and a helluva lot better.",1,0,0,David H.,"New York, NY",41,80,53
5.0,2/2/2012,"Restaurant Week is a time of year that allows those who could not normally afford dinner at a fancy restaurant to dine without breaking the bank.  The real purpose of Restaurant Week is for restaurants to show off their skills at a reasonable price to attract future visits from those who can't regularly spend $150 on dinner. While some restaurants fall down in regards to this definition offering varying (often bitter) service and run of the mill food, Nougatine truly embodies it, offering top notch quality prepared with a delicate hand, and service that is pretty much unbeatable.Look away and your water glass will be refilled. Finish your bread and another piece will magically appear; it was that good.  And the food.... oh the food. From the complimentary amuse bouche to the finale of petit fours and molten chocolate cake, everything here gave me the ""oh my god this is amazing"" feeling I would hope to find at a Jean Georges restaurant.  The shrimp were cooked to perfection, the salmon was salmony without being fishy, and the flavors went together in a harmony most New York restaurants wish they could achieve.

4.0,1/26/2012,"Came here for a prixe-fixe dinner during Restaurant Week. Enjoyed it very much. We had made a reservation, and the hostess seated us promptly after showing us to the coat-check. Pretty intimate setting inside- not to loud, and not to quiet. The kitchen is kind of out in the open so that diners have a glimpse of the staff working. Our server was friendly, helpful, and made recommendations when requested. The wine list was pretty comprehensive, and the prix-fixe selections looked good. All three courses I ordered were delicious. On the salmon, though, the sauce was pretty sweet and syrupy in texture (overall a strange flavor). Probably would have opted for the dish sans the sauce if I were to order that dish again.Yep, I'd surely come back here sometime if I'm in the area.",2,1,0,K D.,"New York, NY",3,172,6
1.0,1/25/2012,"There are a lot of great restaurants in NYC. Nougatine isn't one of them. In fact, The meal I had there on Sunday, January 29, 2012 was one of the worst I've had in the city. I'm not one to slam places -- in fact, I initially wrote to the restaurant to convey my disappointment. They ignored the email. So I thought, ""well, an experience this bad that isn't going to be taken seriously, particularly at a place that can cost $150+ per person, should be avoided."" So, yelpers, consider yourself warned. Nougatine can be bad. Very bad. We were a party for 2, seated at 8PM. I eat somewhat regularly at the Jean-Georges restaurants (lunch in the main dining room is a standby, dinner less often, but a few times year -- Perry St. more regularly, and off and on at other places around town and out of town). My dining companion eats with regularity at Spice Market. This was one of the most disappointing meals I've eaten at a restaurant in New York. I'd go so far to say that the food was bad. I used to work as a line cook at a high end restaurant in Philadelphia, and have cooked in and run a variety of kitchens (though that was some time ago; I now work in a different industry). First, though, I must say that the staff were wonderful. Our server was attentive and responded to the fact that we couldn't eat our food. (Others who cleared our plates didn't ask why they were full, which was strange, because our appetizers and my dessert plates went back to the kitchen, almost untouched). We ordered, initially, off the restaurant week menu. We both had the tuna. It was unbelievably salty. And I like my food salty -- no doubt more than is likely healthy. Neither me nor my companion could eat more than half the dish. The food went back to the kitchen -- not bussed by our waiter -- without comment or question. Next we had the salmon. It was an odd dish. The salmon was overcooked (we'd ask for it medium rare to rare, it came out well done). It was rather flavorless -- such is farmed salmon, I guess. But the lemon crust was terribly salty. And the chili glaze was sickeningly sweet -- like what you get out of those cheap chinese food packets that come with quick and dirty take-out. The greens were undercooked. We each ate a bite, and couldn't continue eating. Our waiter, thankfully noticed and was so kind to allow us to pick a new entree. I had the pork chop. My companion had the lobster (we were happy to pay for any supplement for an entree we might enjoy, and did). Our waiter was apologetic and kind. The pork chop was fine. A little overcooked and the pork underflavored. But the mushrooms were terribly over-salted (it wasn't the prosciutto/pork -- it was just the mushrooms and the pan sauce they were in). They also had been poorly picked over. I stopped eating them after I had to pick a second inedible stem out of my mouth. The Lobster was mediocre. A little tough, and it was the one dish we had that was really under-seasoned (alhtough I think the butter with the bread was also unsalted, which made it a bit sweet and flat). It its price point, mediocre was really disappointing. For dessert we had the chocolate cake and some kind of praeline dish. The cake was fine; the ice cream had far too much vanilla (but was nicely sweetened). The praeline was terrible. I could only eat the garnish. The rest remained untouched. I'm not that picky of an eater -- I'm a big guy, in fact, too big. So for me not to touch an appetizer, half my entree, or most of my dessert is a bad sign. The amuse and the gelees at the end were the best part of the meal. And also the most interesting -- in general the compositions of each dish were incredibly basic and somewhat boring. All in all we walked out of Nougatine having spent $325+ for two (after tax and tip). And the meal was one of the worst either of us had eaten in the city. Nothing made us sick -- so perhaps not the VERY worst! But we couldn't finish any of our dishes because of how they were prepared. The dining hall was empty the night we went. Maybe it's because it was a Sunday and the Giants were playing. Or maybe it's because most of New York already knows what we found out tonight: that the kitchen is bad -- down right lazy, sloppy. And no one there seemed to care enough to do much about it. Trust me: don't go.",4,1,2,Shamus K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,42,1

5.0,1/22/2012,"Wow. Applaud-worthy from point of entry to departure. They took our coats at the front desk, even before entering the restaurant. Even with all of our shopping bags, scarves, etc, they were happy to check our belongings for us.We came here for Restaurant Week Winter 2012 and I ordered the tuna tartare appetizer, salmon entree, and chocolate cake dessert. The tuna tartare was one of the most delicious things I've ever consumed. The raw tuna came on a bed of avocado, served in their special soy sauce. It kind of tasted like a tuna roll and ginger dressing mixed together, and it was phenomenal. They definitely served it with too much soy sauce, but I think I said ""this is soooo good!"" after each bite. My salmon entree and dessert were exceptional as well. They were pretty generous with the salmon, and the kale that came with it was just perfect. The dessert consisted of a small chocolate cake, accompanied by a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top of some crunchy chocolate pieces. It was the ideal ending to a more-than-satisfying meal. I left full, but not uncomfortably full.",3,0,1,Kassy M.,"San Diego, CA",260,1352,639
4.0,1/18/2012,"delightful :)Although, I expected something more.. dainty, i did overall enjoy my dinner. I don't know what is with the other people's experience with waiting on tables, but my friends and I reserved a table for dinner at 7:45pm, but since we had nothing better to do, we decided to go in a little earlier and we were sat at 7:30pm! We all ordered off from the restaurant week menu. When we first sat down, I was sort-of intimated by the surroundings to be honest, but eventually things settled and I got a little more comfortable. The lighting was slightly dimmed but it was perfect. And where I was sitting, I had a good view at the kitchen while the chefs were at action. It was pretty cool watching them work while I was enjoying my meal. Before dinner was served, we were given sour bread to nosh on while we wait for our food, and I liked their sour bread. Nice, soft, and fluffy in the middle.For the first course, three of my friends and i had the tuna tartare with avocado, 'spicy' radish, and a soy ginger marinade. The tuna itself with the avocado was very good and the 'spicy' radish kinda acts like a tortilla chip to a sauce dip. (although not spicy at all, but rather more of a ""sting"" as a friend of mine friend puts it) The soy ginger marinade was pretty good at first, but then towards the middle of the appetizer, I thought the sauce started to get REALLY salty to the point where my lips were a bit chapped and burned. Nonetheless, it was pretty good, one of the best I had so far.---- by this time, I was already full...For my main, I had the lemon crusted baked salmon with potato puree, swiss chard and a sweet chili glaze. The salmon I like, especially the way it was lemon crusted. The swiss chard I like. The potato puree, ehh, I usually never care for potatoes. The sweet-chili glaze I did not like at all! The sauce was so.. lingeringly sweet.. and it was too sweet for me. I tried to brush it off to the side, but EH there was just too much of it. But I did manage to finish my entree. (hehehehehe. I was thinking of taking it home, BUT I figured jean georges was too fancy to let me ""BOX"" my food to go.)--- One of my friend had the chicken entree. I regret not knowing the details of the dish but she said it was good.AND, to finish the meal off... dessert. WHOMP -.-'I usually never order dessert at the end of my meal, but hey it was pre-fixe, and sometimes I should treat to dessert, although I know I will hate myself later. (But HEY, EAT NOW, REGRET LATER, & work it off at them gym TOMORROW!) ... so what do you know, I had the warm chocolate molten cake. EHH, nothing special, really.  Just the right amount of richness. I think of would of enjoyed it a little more if the chocolate was a bit more darker. The vanilla bean ice cream that accompanied it was DELICIOUS! I definitely enjoyed the ice cream more than the cake. I finished the ice cream in seconds, where I had pretty much left half of the cake untouched. I had to call a server to take my plate away because I always have a tendency to nibble on my food although at most, I have finished, but because its sitting there and I usually hate wasting food, I'll nibble at it till it's almost gone!Overall, I had a pretty good time. I enjoyed if not all of it, most of it.---- the only problem I really had, was I realized it did take a pretty long time till our entree came out. My friends didn't mention anything about the wait time, so maybe its just me and my impatience.. But we did finish dinner around.. 9:15ish pm",0,0,0,Jenn N.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",5,25,7

1.0,1/10/2012,"I had somewhat high expectations for this place after my parents had raved about it and everything jean georges. Still, I had a hint of reservations given the fact that it sits at the bottom of a building which has the name ""TRUMP"" plastered all over it. Everything trump, in my mind, is an overdressed and overpriced glob of ... Something. Boy, was I right.Let's start off with the service. Why were we kept waiting for 20 mins after we arrived on time for our reservation? I'm not entirely sure, but we weren't the only party waiting. After we were seated, we easily waited 20 minutes again for the waiter to come and take our order. In general, the waiters were not that attentive and not helpful. In general, i forgot the place had a waiting staff.Which brings us to the food. With Michelin and other awards plaques the restaurant has hanging in the lobby (which are quite misleading- none of them are for this restaurant, but for the other JG), you'd  expect the food to be like perfectly cooked unicorn meat marinated in awesome sauce. It wasn't. I ordered the fried calamari, and it was bad. It was way over seasoned, not crunchy enough, and lacking in edge. I've had way better elsewhere. I also felt that the plate seemed to have been sitting for a while before it was served, and there were parts of the calamari that seemed soggy, making it disgusting for a fried dish.For the main course I had the lobster burger, as i thought I'd try something different. Wow. What a bad idea. Everything about it was just bad. The bun seemed like it was pulled from a whopper. The lobster was overly greasy, it was not pleasant to eat. There was nothing there to balance the flavors in the plate, all i tasted was grease. The mayo didn't help this flavor profile at all. The pickles were also pretty run of the mill, it seemed like they were bought at a supermarket. In all fairness, two other people in our party ordered the chicken entree, which was decent.The desserts were OK, but then again there was something off about them. They were way too sweet. We had the apple tart and the chocolate cake. Nothing special about either. They served their christmas cake, compliments of the house, and unfortunately, that was the worst dessert of them all. I felt like we were eating the gingerbread man's sugary poop.Unfortunately, i'd recommed that you skip this one. Maybe it was an isolated experience. Maybe this place is love it or hate it. For me, I didn't like it. It's not worth the time or money, especially with service as ""meh"" as this one.",3,0,0,Carlos D.,"Atlanta, GA",1,3,0
4.0,1/7/2012,"I asked the bf to take me out on a nice lunch, and he surprised me with Nougatine.  Having eaten at Jean Georges, 3 months earlier for his birthday (had dinner) we knew the food would be just as good at Nougatine.  The food was great.  The service was poor.  We couldn't pass up the deal and got the 3 course prix fixe for $32.  Definitely a pricey lunch but one worth splurging on.  I had debated between several appetizers, but after looking at the regular menu on the side and comparing the prices, I chose to get the shrimp salad.   Honestly, I was very disappointed as soon as I looked at the plate, as the food wasn't visually appealing.  The only thing that I did say prior to eating was that there was a heap of salad.  The warm champagne vinaigrette with the shrimp was absolutely heavenly, one of the best salads of my life.  I'm not sure how the shrimp was cooked, but my bf and I felt that it was butter poached with a hint of truffles.  Amazing.  If I ever go to Nougatine again, which I do plan on doing in the future, I'll be sure to order that salad.  My bf got tuna tartar with a combination of ginger, chili, and soy.   After eating the tuna ribbons at Jean Georges, we knew this dish was going to be good.   It was just as good, but not as elaborately presented as the prior experience.  For the main course I got the chicken with mustard sauce.  It was crispy and flavorful, but also had its dry spots.  Served over some grains.  The entree was on the small side, but it was lunch, can't really complain.  Glad the mustard sauce was presented on the side of the dish, as I don't like mustard at all.   The bf got the red snapper served with zucchini ribbons/pasta.  He loved the fish.  Again, a light portion.  No complaints from him.  For dessert we got the almond parfait and the warm chocolate cake. Can't complain.  Both were sweet and just right.  My bf didn't like the texture of the almond parfait as it was a tofu like mushy consistency.  Served over a side of fresh fruit, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I didn't mind it, in fact I finished both his dessert and my dessert.  On to the service... I would have given the place 5 stars.  I took it down a star for the service. The front desk was very friendly, checking in with us every so often since we arrived early to our reservation.  We had no issues with them whatsoever.  After being seated, our server presented us with our menus and barely looked at us.  He didnt even ask us what we wanted to eat, rather he just stood there and waited for us to order our food.  The only time he smiled was when he gave us the check.  My bf and I thought it was comical but still was disappointed at the fact that he didn't attend to us very well.  Our reservation was at 145 and we didn't leave until past 4 o'clock.  For a place known for business lunch, we didn't think the service would be so slow.  I agree with other reviews that there a lack of continuity in the service.  It would be nicer to see the same waiter rather than have 4-5 different servers.  If the food hadn't been so good, I would have complained how slow the food got to the table.  They need to learn how to smile! Service aside, the food was excellent.  The total meal- tax  and tip and one non alcoholic beverage, cost 90 bucks.  For a place that pricey they need to definitely work on their hospitality.",1,0,1,joanne m.,"New York, NY",8,42,4
2.0,1/2/2012,"My fiance and I took advantage of a rare weekday off and had lunch at Nougatine last week (having heard the prix fixe was a great deal for $32). We arrived for our 2:30 PM reservation, were seated and served two bloody marys promptly. My fiance started with the near-ethereal shrimp salad (with avocado & champagne vinaigrette) and I had a decent frisee & goat cheese salad. Unfortunately, things went downhill from there. I was delivered the wrong entree, which was brusquely removed without comment until a half-hearted apology several minutes later. The entrees were fine but not special. Desserts were split: the Jean-Georges chocolate cake was straight-up delicious, but the poached pears with nougatine and (overly) salted caramel ice cream was limpid and boring. My biggest disappointment here was the service. We did not have one consistent waiter, but rather 5-6 different people who presented themselves throughout the course of our meal.

Honestly, living a few blocks away, I really should be eating here much more often.We decided to drop in last night for the prix fixe and I was once again blown away by the exquisite meal I got.  I went with the tuna tartare, a slow cooked beef filet and my girl got the fried calamari and roasted cod with sauteed eggplanet. And let's not forget the amuse bouche duo of potato and Parmesan soup and fig and mozzarella.The amuse bouche was great. I always love that they get you started with something small and immensely flavorful. It's an aspect of the meal that gets sadly overlooked at almost every restaurant.I've ordered the tartate quite a few times and it always blows me away. Not only is the fish fresh and succulent, the marinade they serve it with has amazing depth; the subtle hints of ginger, chili, and soy are delightful. My steak was also stellar. It was served over a small creamy bed of whipped potatoes and along side roasted brussel sprouts. Both were simple, flavorful and delicious. As for the meat, I always thought quick cooking a steak at high heat was best, but these guys at the Nougatine have really got this slow cooking thing nailed down. It couldn't have been more perfect. They also crusted the steak with bacon and roasted garlic which was not listed as a component on the menu...so I was really pleasantly surprised when I started to dig in. The Mrs. also loved her meal as well as her house made passionfruit-lime soda. I actually got quite a few tastes of the cod and calamari and both were quite good, though the calamari could have been served a few degrees hotter. Fried food is always best when piping hot.To close out the meal, we got the marzipan cake and coffee. The cake was incredible, very delicate and flavorful, though the coffee was a bit average in my opinion. Luckily, coffee is one of the rare low points at the Nougatine.All of this came to $102 for the both of us which is incredible value if you ask me. My three course prix fixe was just $38.If you eat out in the city a lot, you'll know that it's easy to drop $100 on meals which are average at best.

The food served here should only be acceptable on a bad episode of Chopped.I came here with four of my family members to celebrate my sister's birthday. Since it was a special occasion, we all opted for the $68 tasting menu. I was looking forward to my first experience with JG and after reading other Yelper's reviews had high expectations. We were seated promptly in the center of the dining room. The service was very slow and we waited about 15 minutes to place our order. We placed drink orders and other requests with different waiters throughout the meal and kept having to flag down random waiters who passed our table. Very frustrating.Once our courses began arriving, my perception towards the meal shifted quickly from being excited about the meal...to being hopeful that the next course would be better...to laughing about how awful everything was. Like I said, the flavor combinations they had were straight out of an episode of chopped. Literally... there had to be some sort of ingredients basket in the kitchen that they were forced to use. What comes to mind the most was the salmon dish we had. Picture this: a decent salmon filet on top of a bed of spinach with jalapeno SLICES in it covered in an overly-sweet, orange sherbet sauce. Gross! The worst part was every dish had some sort of fatal flavor flaw. There was no part of the meal that was remotely tasty. Even the flourless chocolate cake tasted like it came out of a box.

After our meal, we asked the hostess if JG gets bothered when people ask to meet him and she said no... he loves meeting people who enjoy his food. So we got to meet with JG and he was as charming as can be. My crush on JG and his food has only grown stronger after this experience....",0,0,0,Esther K.,"New York, NY",202,365,81

2.0,9/15/2011,"I had high hopes for this place, especially since this was the fanciest restaurant we tried on this visit to the Big Apple.  Boy, was I disappointed.We had a hard time finding the restaurant, as it doesn't exactly match up to the street numbers on Central Park West, and no one was picking up the phone line when I called, but it is located just inside the Trump Tower.Our party of 3 was seated at a corner table close to the open kitchen.  Our waiter was aloof and distant, as was his attentiveness.  Our order was taken much after the party who sat down behind us, and bread was brought out way after theirs, and only after I asked about it.  The only positive part of the experience was the 3 course prix fixe for $28, which is a great value.  I wasn't expecting my watermelon goat cheese salad to be exactly that, watermelon cubes with curls of goat cheese around it, but it was.  A few flecks of peppercorn also adorned it; it was interesting and somewhat refreshing, but I wouldn't order it again.  My skate entree was small, and there were just too many flavors going on with the bitterness and sourness of the peppers, eggplant underneath the fish, and sauce.  I much rather would have preferred the fish and some plain veggies.  Chocolate lava cake a la vanilla bean ice cream was dessert and definitely the best course.Overall, service was excruciatingly slow, and the pace of the food was as well.  I remember thinking, ""how long does it take to prepare 3 salads?""  Our wait for the first course was easily an hour.I don't recommend it and not coming back.  Adios.",1,1,1,Tricia D.,"Glenview, IL",548,1226,3944

First of all, you get a wide variety and selection to choose from for lunch and i believe that they have an all year round RW menu which is awesome..(about $30 for a 3 course meal selection). Second of all its the best place to really impress almost anyone because not only is the place really classy  with a great ambiance looking at central park but it proves to people that have the wrong impression of fancy places that the portions are not always small and tasteless but could also be average size and extremely delicious. i had for first course :the tuna tar tare- ""divine"" very well presented, sooo tasty i swear i licked my whole plate shamelessly.... or second course: i had the skirt steak recommended by the waitress: very very tasty. my friend had the lobster burger which i took a bite of #heaven#...extremely flavorful and they were very generous w/ the lobster for dessert- had the best chocolate cake EVER...it melts in your mouth and the ice cream with it...tops it off...the best!!!. my friend had some strawberry cake with icecream..i watched her scream in delight!!!!

2.0,8/21/2011,"From a recent visit for dinner, I'm surprisingly disappointed from the experience.   Having only been here for RW previously, I expected the regular menu to be much better, or at least as good.  Starting with appetizers...SHRIMP SALAD:  I remember being delicious last time so I wanted to try it again this time.  It came with generously portioned shrimp and avocado.  I enjoyed it, though the shrimp was smothered in a creamy sauce that was slightly sweet.  I could have done without that.  Overall a nice appetizer to start with if you like shrimp and lightly SEARED FOIS GRAS:  This came with a nice raspberry reduction of some sort on top. I enjoyed the two tastes together - the decadent fattiness of the fois gras actually did well with the sweetness of the raspberry.  Very nice.  Sadly, entrees is where they lost it.  PORK CHOP:   My friend ordered this and it turned out to be very, very dry.   It was probably among the worst I've had in a restaurant of Nougatine's calibur.  We speculated that because it was so late perhaps we got the very last pork chop that wa sitting out. Who knows. RED SNAPPER:  My snapper fared a little better than the pork chop.  It came with roasted tomatoes and zucchini, whic I tend to like.  It was decent, but very ordinary compared to the amazing red snapper dish right next door at JG.  The sauce in this dish was very brothy, light, and somewhat bland.  I don't mind light dishes, but this lacked real flavor.  It pretty much tasted like the ingredients that were listed out on the menu.Dessert was also strange.  We ordered the RASPBERRY CHEESECAKE SUNDAE, which turned out to be a shortbread cookie with a tiny amount of cheesecake buried under a mound if whipped cream, topped with a few raspberries and stick-shaped meringue.  It was not very tasty, and definitely NOT a $12 dessert.   Their soda was also excruciatingly sweet, though I do like their Organic Avenue pressed juices.All in all, pretty let down by Nougatine.   My previous RW experiences here were actually better both in terms of service and food, even though the RW menu is limited to 3 entree options.   I'm not sure I've ever been so harsh or dissatisfied with a JG restaurant.   I still like the other JG restaurants, and will plan on revisiting the others before coming back to Nougatine.",0,0,0,Lu H.,"New York, NY",1218,411,1977

It was a pretty cozy area, probably would have been romantic if we went for dinner.We each ordered something different so we could try as many dishes as possible.Before ordering food we shared a Fresh Fruit and Herbal Soda - Black Cherry-Yuzu. It was a little too overpowering with the herbal taste.For appetizers we got the Shrimp Salad with Avocado, Tomato, and Champagne Vinegar Dressing and the Fried Calamari with Basil Salt, Citrus-Chili Aioli. Entrees: Slowly Cooked Salmon, Warm Potato Salad with Sugar Snap Peas and Horseradish and Grilled Tenderloin of Beef with Spinach and Gruyere crepe. Desserts: Summer Berries, Lemon-Verbena Ice Cream and Jean Georges' Warm Chocolate Cake, Vanilla Bean Ice Cream..The Shrimp Salad was delicious, the shrimp itself was cooked to perfection and was covered in the most delicious dressing. The Fried Calamari was quite interesting, with a hint of a potato chip flavor. The aioli, while good, had a bit too much of a kick to it for my palate.The Salmon was probably the least favorite dish out of all the dishes we ordered. It just had a flavor that did not go down for either of us. The Steak was cooked to a delicious medium rare. Tasted wonderful with the spinach underneath. The crepe was too cheesy for my tastes though as I do not like cheese enough to eat an entire stuffed crepe of it.... Otherwise PERFECT entree!The Summer Berries came out as a sort of  chilled fruit coup with the lemon-verbena ice cream on top. It was interesting as I've never had anything like that before. The Chocolate Cake was a really tasty dessert, a nice finish to the meal. The chocolate cake had a nice gooey center while the vanilla bean ice cream was very flavorful.

3.0,7/22/2011,"I had dinner at Nougatine this past Thursday.  I had heard great things about the restaurant from numerous sources.  When I arrived, I realized it wasn't my first time there, rather I had gone there on a firm lunch in 2008 but thought the name was simply Jean George.  Anyhow... when I ate here years back I thoroughly enjoyed it and it stood out as one of my favorite dining experiences in Manhattan.Fast forward to Thursday... I'm a bit ambivalent about my experience at Nougatine.  Perhaps it was all the hype of reviews and my prior experience there, but everything was just okay, not mind blowing.  I can admit... however... that I tend to feel ambivalence toward the pricey French restaurants in the City... except The Modern (of course--because it's pure edible ingeniousness).I initially planned to order of the Restaurant Week menu... but who wants to go to a well known restaurant and just have chicken or salmon.  Instead, I ordered the Calamari for appetizer and the Salt and Pepper Lobster for my main course.  The Calamari was just okay, perhaps I should have ordered something else... the are several innovative first courses that peaked my interest and I suspect they would have been more enjoyable.  The Lobster included very substantial claws -- they were HUGE.  This was definitely a plus.  They were lightly breaded and served with a picked cabbage, scallion and some other greens.  It was very light and the vegetables balanced out the dish that would have otherwise been heavier because of lobster was breaded.  The flavor was just okay.  I found the flavors to be a bit too understated, a bit to subtle... dare I say bland.  Perhaps.... but tasty nonetheless.  We passed on dessert, nothing pulled me.  I ordered a Ginger Margarita and it was nothing special.  The service was good and sprinkled with condescension, as expected.  There was a large group at the bar that was a bit raucous and that took away from the ambiance.",0,1,0,Tanisha C.,"Brooklyn, NY",233,184,192
4.0,7/22/2011,"The most memorable part of lunch? Our cool and collected server. I wanted some input on the RW lunch menu, and she was more than happy to divulge. Should I get the arugula salad with spicy corn vinaigrette or the shrimp avocado salad? She's looking down at her notepad and assuredly says ""shrimp"". Ok, I'll have the shrimp. I'd like a fish entree. What do you recommend? ""The skate's good,"" she begins writing on her pad. Skate it is. And I assume I should get the chocolate cake? She smiles.She came by to ask how I liked my (actually her) selections for lunch during each course (not too intrusive but actually very kind of her). The shrimp and avocado salad came with an orange creamy dressing, not a vinaigrette as listed on the menu, but a tangy and almost cheesy sauce. The shrimp were chewy (great texture), although the greens were not of the greatest integrity. I do wish it had more avocado and mushroom. I can see how the sauce could steal the show for diners.The skate took a little getting used to (it's described as slowly cooked, a fall off the bone type of texture if there were any bones) with a light cilantro sauce, black beans, and bits of avocado infused with ginger. The cilantro and ginger did give the dish an asian flair.Lastly, the valhrona chocolate cake (valhrona chocolate is absolutely divine. get the caramel milk chocolate if you like to indulge in pure sweetness or the dark 80% for character and boldness) was a bit unimaginative but was served warm with a soft and melty interior and a side of vanilla bean ice cream.

4.0,7/21/2011,"I can always tell when I'm outclassed by a restaurant when the wine-tasting feels awkward.  I like wine, and I like to think that I have some ability to distinguish the good stuff, but if I'm being honest, I really don't know shit about it.  And at some restaurants, during those awkwardly quiet 7 seconds, you can just tell that everyone knows it.  Though I guess that's to be expected when you order the cheapest bottle on the wine list.  And when your waitress walks in on a story about a guy who was practicing a medical exam that turned into borderline sexual molestation (Not me!  Or anyone with me!  I swear!).Anyway.  I digress.  Classy or not, I still love me some good food.  So let's get on with this Restaurant Week review, shall we?First off, the amuse bouche - a cucumber soup and a crouton with goat cheese and something I can't remember  (was it some sort of marinated cherry tomato?) - was AWESOME.  Loved the cucumber soup, it was refreshing but had a bit of a bite to it, tasting somewhat carbonated.  You have my attention, JG.For a first course I had the tuna tartare, which was good but not mind-blowingly so.  The tuna itself was super-fresh, and I really liked how it paired with the avocado, both texture and taste-wise, but for whatever reason I wasn't too crazed for it.  Though I will say that the ginger marinade that it came with was absolutely outstanding.For my entree I went with the salmon, which was served on potatoes and spinach in a passion fruit sauce.  This was FANTASTIC.  The salmon was cooked perfectly, just so moist and flavorful.  The passion fruit sauce/marinade was SO GOOD.  It somehow managed to provide a really deep passion fruit taste without seeming overpoweringly sweet.  I found myself lapping up every last bit of it with some leftover bread that I had.  And then with my finger.I also tried a bit of my friend's chicken, which was just absurdly good as well.  Probably the juiciest chicken I've ever had.  I'd still stick with the salmon, but definitely wouldn't have been disappointed with this one either.  Also, the serving size was pretty friggin massive.Finally, I of course had to go with the warm chocolate cake for dessert, and it didn't disappoint.  Perfectly baked chocolate cake with a glorious, glorious molten center.  As a lover of super-dense chocolate, I actually could have gone for an even denser, more buttery cake flavor/texture, but I was really impressed with the fact that this was so damn chocolatey and still managed to seem somewhat delicate; it wasn't so overpoweringly dense that a person who isn't unhealthily obsessed with rich desserts wouldn't be able to enjoy it thoroughly.As good as the food was, the service didn't quite match up, as it was pretty clear that we were written off as Restaurant Week punks almost immediately.  Our waitress seemed to be progressively more pained by her interactions with us as time went on, and by the end of the meal she was barely even saying a word to us when she came by the table.  I get that this place has truly earned its snarkiness, but this is a bar room, it would be nice if they could loosen up a bit when faced with a more casual group.So, I'm torn on my rating here.  If this weren't a place that I expected to deliver top-notch food, it would probably be five stars.  But for the kind of place it is (and for the amount of money I'd be shelling out if it weren't RW), it's borderline between 4 or 5.  I'll round down for the service, acknowledge that coming here and getting the tasting menu might have made this a 5-star experience, and look forward to finding an excuse to hit up Jean Georges itself someday.",7,8,6,Jordan J.,"New York, NY",46,109,2

I loved that we got to sit next to the seemingly clean, open kitchen where we could see the cooking magic at work. We also sat behind the producer of Karate Kid and some soap opera actress lady who had me wonder whether she could even chew properly with her overly botoxed face.

Watermelon & Goat Cheese Salad - I don't know I may have a skewed view on this dish.  These two are seriously my two favorite things in the world and I just couldn't see how the two could work together.

5.0,7/16/2011,"I had many wonderful experiences at Nougatine, so it was finally time to try Jean Georges. The dining room is rectangular, white, open, airy, with large windows and has a beautiful modern chandelier with an octopus like design. I was presented with David Mellor cutlery. We started off the evening with two glasses of Doyard champagne, which were expertly poured. The plates have the JG logo in gilt in the center. There are multiple prix fixe options depending on the number of dishes. I opted for the three dish prix fixe and chose caviar egg (extra charge), foie gras with olive lychee and brioche, and beef tenderloin with squash, Parmesan cheese, and hot sauce. The amuse bouche included cucumber soup, salmon, and a piece of fillo dough topped with goat cheese. The caviar placed in the egg shell was amazing. It was such an interesting idea to serve it this way. Under the caviar, inside the egg, was a mix of medium and well done egg yolk. My companion had scallops with a mustard like sauce which were very well executed. The snapper with artichoke hearts was also great, but I found the sauce to be too strong and heavy tasting compared to the other dishes. I would suggest skipping it. My foie gras dish was amazing! Adding lychee to it was such a novel idea. There was also Persian rose petal powder, which is something I have never tasted before! I also really enjoyed the beef with squash, cheese, and hot sauce. Please be warned that it is spicier than the other dishes on the menu. The beef was carved at our table. Lobster with gnocchi was perfectly executed. For desserts, there is a choice of four flavors including strawberry, rhubarb, cherry, and chocolate. Each flavor then comes in a dish divided into four parts. Mine was the chocolate flavor which consisted of the Jean Georges chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream, white chocolate sponge, banana and peanut butter ganache, and liquid bitter chocolate. The rhubarb menu consisted of almond financier, rhubarb souffle, rhubarb gelee, and a strawberry and rhubarb soda. The desserts were superb and the choice depends on whether you are a chocolate lover or not. Afterwards, they bring a jar of marshmallows and cut two pieces for the table. There is also a small silver dish of fruit pates and macarons. A set of four chocolates was also brought to us, which included various fillings including peanut butter and mint. Coffee and tea come with La Perruche sugar cubes which was a nice touch.

Jean Georges is the high line with Nougatine and Terrace being the less formal offerings. As much as I like to get all suited up to go out, there is something to be said about being able to enjoy a luxurious setting in jeans. The quality of the food here is top notch as you would expect, the room is well appointed but not gaudy and the service is attentive and precise.The Dinner Tasting menu was good.  It offered a variety of flavors (although many were to the sweet side) and was appropriately priced at around 68 bucks.  Looking back at previous meals at Nougatine however, I think the lunch tasting is the better value, for less than half, you get about 60% of what you get for dinner (3 courses as opposed to 5) AND the choices are just about the same as whats offered on the a la cart dinner menu.So if you like good food but don't want to get dressed up for dinner, this is a great option to have, but dollar for dollar, I'll take their lunch any day of the week.",0,0,0,Jonathan S.,"New York, NY",41,159,19

On the other hand, there was a live tiny slug sashaying across a leaf in my salad today at lunch that may possibly haunt me from touching another organic salad for several years. The lunch menu is fantastic and I love all the prix fix options I have tried. The food is fresh, well portioned, delightful, thoughtful, and beautiful. The service is impeccably professional, the ambiance modern yet refined. I thoroughly enjoyed the molten chocolate cake and the salmon over spicy spinach. I delighted in the house made berry soda. And the shrimp and avocado salad was fantastic (and large) - up until halfway through my dining companion screeched STOP! Don't eat that!!The staff handled the situation quite well and comped me the lunch as well as bringing over the complimentary sodas. They were very apologetic about it. I just feel very bad for the poor kitchen hand who may suffer the same fate as that tiny slug.

5.0,6/3/2011,"I'll admit that part of my infatuation with Nougatine has to do with its fantastic name.  I imagined a confectionary setting and food that was light on the palette but genius in its combination of flavors and textures.  I was not far off the mark.We stopped in for dinner late last night and were seated in a cozy niche across from the bar but with views into the kitchen.  Even at 10:00 PM, the room was buzzing and the tables were filled and I quickly realized that I too wanted to linger.  Nougatine is extremely comfortable.  The atmosphere is warm and casual  and the space is suffused with a luminescent glow cast by the creamy-tiled flooring (a flooring which, as other reviewers have pointed out, totally resembles the eponymous candy!  I loved it).Our  meal began with two light and savory amuse-bouche: a shot of velvety carrot soup and a crunchy square toast topped with spicy radish. Next I tried the tuna tartare.  This was outstanding - pureed avocado topped with chopped pieces of ruby red tuna which absorbed the spicy ginger marinade and melted immediately in your mouth - all finished once again with peppery radishes.  I duly devoured it.  For my entree, I ordered the slow-cooked cod served over black beans and avocado and a ginger-truffle sauce.  This was also fantastic: perfectly cooked and wholly addicting. Unfortunately, for dessert we ordered the intriguing but problematic Hisbiscus-infused rhubarb tart which came topped with creme brulee; while it was tasty, we couldn't help but notice the remarkable similarity in flavor it bore to Skittles (the red kind).  We ate it anyway.In all our experience was lovely.  The service was good and and while the contemporary decor is not particularly memorable, the room does provide a glimpse into the admirably spotless and shipshape Jean-Georges kitchen (with its rows of copper pots and bustling be-toqued staff).Nougatine has the added benefit of being only a few blocks from Lincoln Center, making it an ideal pre- or post-theater spot for dinner or drinks.  There is even a prix-fixe dinner menu ($38) which runs from 5-6:00 and after 10:00 (last night's selection included the tuna tartare appetizer, the grilled striploin beef, and Jean-George's redoubtable chocolate cake with vanilla bean ice cream).  We'll definitely be back soon.",3,3,1,Anna M.,"Manhattan, NY",17,50,2

I fell in love with this place last time I was in NYC and had an even better time this go round.  We went to a few restaurants on this trip at around the same price point and this was probably the best we had as well as a great value.  I had the foie gras to start (sorry PETA), then the black bass for my entree and the carrot cake for dessert.  My friend got the tasting menu, which consisted of basically a full serving of each of the following: tuna tartare, foie gras, salmon, striploin, and a mix of desserts.  Favorites? the tuna tartare & my bass entree.  BOTH were amazingly flavorful and perfectly cooked (in the case of my bass, at least).  The foie gras was tasty, but the bruléed top was a bit much for me.  The salmon was also very flavorful and tasty as was the beef, but there was just something so perfect about the flavor and crispiness of the bass skin and the combo of flavors & textures in the tartare.  Both really impressed us.The desserts were pretty tasty too as were the drinks we had: a cucumber martini--interesting and slightly spicy--and a ginger margarita.  The carrot cake was moist, but the carrot ginger sauce was a bit too potent for me.  My favorite dessert, though, was the lemon mille-feuille.  Very tasty stuff, all around!",0,0,0,Joshua S.,"Gibsonton, FL",196,73,19

Two of the three main courses came were very good (skate and chicken), the pork chop came and it was very over cooked.  My guest returned it and just ordered the asparagus appetizer to replace it and that took another 10 minutes to arrive.  The final insult was we asked for the email of the manager and we were given the wrong address.  I am not sure what happened but it was a very bad night for the restaurant and it did not live up to any of our expectations.",2,0,0,Ronald L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,0

5.0,5/13/2011,"The service staff at Nougatine understood that customers have different needs and demands. Upon  entering the establishment you are greeted with a warm smile from the reservationists ,""Good day, welcome to Jean-George may I take your  name to confirm your reservation"". After confirming your reservation, a guess checking agent  steps(coat check)  up to receptionist desk,  introduces themselves offer to take each individual outer belong  and bags, You are presented with an  number place card to retrieve your belong after dining. You are then dispatched to the host who accompanies you through the dining room to your assigned seating. If you are a female your chair is pulled out and pushes in a cordial manner. She then presents your menu, smiles and bids you fare well until your next visitation. The Waiter greets   you in warm and pleasant tone, good day, do you care for one of our specialty beverage or (Sparkling, tap, distilled) water. He departs to put in the order. A back server shows up at the table, smiles, asks permission to place bread and butter on your plate. When the waiters bring back beverages, he clarifies specials for the day, culinary technique on menu items ordered and continue serving  tables.  Associate(s) at Jean-George makes you feel as  an extended part of their family. For example, if you need clarity on restroom locations or a brief history of establishment quirky saying, each member spends the time to explain, they are well rounded in their craft. When your food is ready to be served, the items are placed at a side station; your waiter inspects it for correct ingredient mise en place, cleanness and cooking temperature. Servers present meals in synchronized manner, each explaining the dish with passion and clarity. When a napkins fell down the closes workers picked it up, replaces it with new one, apologizing as if this mishap's happen while passing by and asks you if you are enjoying your meal then departs. Dessert presentation is the same for above. When payment is made the Captain on duty   comes over, greets you with your personal belongs and bids you farewell. In my opinion this is what one  considers  or expects when  dining in a establishment  that bears a name  like Jean-George, white glove service  presentation accompanied by sterling silver trays .  You don't get it at  Nougatine ,  though they try to replicate the service  you get ( dining at  Jean-George  a lot more expensive) for a reduced  rate  when eating in front .  In conclusion, this was one of those meals I never wanted to end. The time you arrive,   you are greeted by hostess that are extremely cordial, prepared and professional. The dining room staff who are agreeable and attentive, they recognized our needs when we were seated and    were fully aware of menu ingredients. Concluding with the captain on duty, presenting petit fours, complements from Mr. Vongerichten. The atmosphere in the restaurant was cozy, bright, spacious and airy. Tabletops were graced with freshly cut white annual delphinium flowers  and delicate glass stemware Everything we ate  was so delicious. My appetizer, shrimp salad was actually prawns that were marinated in a lite soy sauce then seared, the inside was juicy and sweet. The tuna tart are I had was the main course was simply amazing. The ginger marinade sauce was enough to give you the heat of the chili but sublimed enough not to overpower the tuna. I was well pleased. For Dessert, I challenge myself in devouring the individual chocolate cake that was filled up with Tons and tons of warm fudge. It was thick and gooey . One of the incredible things about Mr. Vongerichten food preparation is that you can literally taste all the elements and how they complement each other, The years he has spent in Thailand paid off.   This meal was a good value at $28.  I must admit if I had the unlimited resource to dine out on a daily basis, Nougatine would be the location to empty my pockets. Haven eaten at numerous fine dining institution in New York City   there are only few where you can get an appetizer, entrée and dessert under $30.  Nougatine is an excellent value, with outstanding service and very good food!",0,0,0,iremain g.,"Ankeny, IA",1,1,5

2.0,1/28/2011,"GF and I went last night for RW. She ordered from the RW menu and I ordered from their regular menu.Her shrimp app was just blah. The flavors didn't really work well together, but edible. My brussel sprouts were god awful. The srouts themselves were super salty and on top of that, the big chunks of bacon made it inedible. I seriously make much better brussel sprouts than this.Her tenderloin? Salty as hell and tough. It was strange because it was cooked just ight - medium rare - but very tough. They must have used poor quality beef.  Her sauteed broccoli was the saltiest thing I've eaten in my life. Ugh.My lobster burger? Surprise surprise. I felt like I was pouring a box of salt down my throat. I took out the pickles in the burger but that didn't help as the pattie itself was incredibly salty.  The fries too, of course, were drenched in salt.We don't normally like to complain about food, but I think the waiter noticed that we weren't too happy, so he brought a dessert for me on the house, which was very nice. She enjoyed her warm chocolate cake with ice cream, which thankfully was not salty.Maybe it was an off night or the head chef had a serious cold, but that was the worst $150 meal I've ever had in my life.  Or maybe someone accidentally knocked over a box of salt in the kitchen? Who knows, but by the end of the night, I had drank about 5 glasses of water.The best thing about the place was the view and the bread.",1,0,0,Kevin C.,"Elmhurst, NY",103,113,9
3.0,1/25/2011,"Maybe my experience wasn't the typical Nougatine experience because I went for Restaurant Week. The dinner menu was a typical Restaurant Week menu, nothing out of the ordinary. I got the shrimp appetizer with butternut squash and toasted pumpkin seeds, the grilled striploin of beef, and the warm chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream for dessert. They also served us complimentary amuse bouches (a Gruyere pastry puff and a shot of potato leek soup with chive oil) and desserts (jellies and chocolate-covered candied orange peel). The food was fine, but everything was a little bit salty for my taste. I will mention that we had excellent service though - our water glasses were always filled, and the waiter brought over a complimentary dessert (chocolate and hazelnut fondant with black currant sorbet, which was average) for my friend because her appetizer had pancetta in it (she doesn't eat pork and the menu doesn't mention that there is pork in the dish).

3.0,1/15/2011,"Take this rating with a grain of salt because the food selections my mom and I made were not JG's most popular and most well-known dishes. I have been to Nougatine a year ago and seeing the VIP status of passing through 'Noug' to get to JG, I wanted to raise my game as well. After months of fighting for a desirable lunch reservation and cancel some last minutes ones (before I were charged with a late cancellation fee, which is 48 hours in advanced, FYI), my mom and I finally made it in this afternoon. Since I have heard wonderful reviews about JG, I was really looking forward to being pampered by great service and bread. Yes. You give me a caliber bread basket (looking at you Del Posto even though I didn't enjoy my measely vegetarian plate), you got a hold of my credit card. Unfortunately, the bread choices weren't my fav. Today, they were serving Swedish nut bread, sourdough, and ciabatta roll. I prepare my bread to be nice and warm and sadly, these weren't. The nut bread was a bit too sweet to start off a lunch course IMHO and because it has honey (true vegans don't consume honey, but I don't mind), I had my fair share of sourdough, which was nice and tangy. Not bad. Since I have already notified my dietary needs on opentable, my amouse bouches were all vegan. There was a spoonful of chopped edamame beans dressed with chili oil and sea salt. Yes. Too spicy and too salty. The broccoli soup was served warm, which tasted like, well, warm green soup. The pickled radish was my only favorite. I also cannot believe I did this, but I ordered an 8 oz of green juice for $8. I savored every single drop of this greenish. Not much vegan options on the winter menu, sadly. The fall menu had the asparagus, avocado salad, which was taken out of the winter menu. But I see so many asparagus and avocados in the supermarket! So, I had a simple green salad as my first course. Really fresh and bitter greens. I wished I had requested some avocado, too. My mom went for the black sea bass sashimi. Fish was fresh, but the dressing was a bit salty. Guess that's when the bread come into play. Mom made the wrong entree choice of choosing the veal scalloptine. It was so meat heavy from the veal and the ham and yes, the poured on sauce was also salty. Perhaps we have a very light palate. The kind waitress 'veganized' the butternut squash soup for me. It was both savory and sweet. I am not a soup person, but it was good. To balance off the saltiness from the veal, my mom decided to conclude our meal with the late harvest dessert plate. The pumpkin ice cream was the best part - an intense pumpkin flavor accompanied with a hint of ginger. The sweet potato cake was dainty and warmed. The plating presentation was not the most creative (everything was in separate component), so the presentation was not very cohesive. And to round off the lunch marathon, like everyone else had mentioned, we were presented with two cut cubes of vanilla marshmallow, 4 petit fours and 2 macaroons. By now, we could not finish anymore food, so we packed them to go. We walked out a grand lighter. Perhaps I am just a simple gal with a simple palate. This JG lunch shall be my once in a life time experience. Not a place I would willingly step into in the near future.",3,2,2,GarGuPi L.,"Flushing, NY",87,496,1696
5.0,1/6/2011,"This review is based on several visits over the past few years.I give this place 5 stars because of its consistency, location, and good prices. Their best steal is the $26 lunch prix fixe, a 3 course meal with a menu that changes daily.  If you go for dinner they have a $35 prix fixe that you have to order before 6pm. My experience has been that the regular entrees are much more interesting (for example, I love their endive salad bc it they add fresh huckleberries to it), and I particularly like their fish entrees. They also have a delicious shrimp salad (with big fresh succulent shrimps!).  I suggest not getting the tuna tartare- it is good but not that creative and not their best dish by far. I always enjoy the amuse bouche they serve - last time it was a cream of celery root soup that was warm but so so refreshing at the same time. It was accompanied by a tiny crab cake that was perfectly fried so that it wasn't greasy and made a great complement to the soup.I've always had impeccable service too.  One time I went during the theater rush before a show, and embarrassingly, one of the people at my table was really rude to our server (kept staring meanly at server while tapping her watch everytime the server walked by, told our server several times to ""hurry hurry hurry! do you understand that word?"").  Our server handled it beautifully-- not only did she make sure we were done with our meal and check 15min before the time by which we were hoping to leave, but she did not get defensive or offended at all, was genuinely polite and all smiles, and served us with both efficiency and elegance. I was really impressed (and the rest of our table left her a huge tip).As for location: anytime I have out of town guests, I suggest going to Nougatine because of the location. It's located in an older Trump building near the Time-Warner building, it's right on the edge of Central Park, and it's also pretty close to 5th Ave.",1,0,1,Park W.,"New York, NY",17,106,0

The atmosphere, as anyone could imagine, is a bit more stuffy.  Tie and jacket required (I think? Pretty certain they were) and service was more strict and formal.Everything was great.

1.0,12/16/2010,"You guys, what the hell is this place? I'm not even kidding, I wasn't expecting a ton. The restaurant is old, location whatever...but I wasn't expecting the level of meh we got. Both of us ordered the prix fixe menu, and immediately with our tartare, we both looked at each other and said, ""hmmmm this is pretty 90s"" , you know drizzle patterns on the plate, people were just discovering Wasabi, etc etc. As the meal progressed the dishes declined. I love Foie any way, so I was into the brule version here. Wasn't nearly my favorite presentation of it, but tasty none the less, the salmon? The salmon was a hot hot mess. We concluded it was essentially American Airlines business class food. Felt reheated, and boring. It was a ton of creme, some chilis, and some salmon. It was either Airline food at it's best, or the ""hottest restaurant"" in Omaha circa 1998. ""This is Jean Georges right?""The wine pairings were so gross and ill fitting I had to ditch them and just go with a bottle of something I knew I liked. Then comes the steak. Swimming amidst a crazy overpowering ginger broccoli puree it was essentially beef and broccoli done 'fancy' and by 'fancy' I mean not fancy at all just wishes it was fancy. It was over salted and you could barely taste the beef. The Broccoli was just steamed sitting on the side as my mom would prepare it. My friend said ""Ok, this is a serious situation, 20 bucks we get molten chocolate cake for desert, because judging from the lack of inventiveness up in this piece that is about the only thing they could serve""And what do you know. We get a mini molten chocolate cake with ice cream. Some tarte I really didn't like and blocked out of my mind and some passion fruit (whatever) sorbet. We left baffled and bewildered.

4.0,11/20/2010,"Nougatine was a wonderful, wonderful deal.  The prix fixe lunch ($28 for three courses) was simply a delight.  The restaurant is slightly more laid back than it's fancy-dancy (and FANTABULOUS) counterpart Jean Georges, but it was still necessary to remember one's manners.  The food was a pleasure, and the ambience is peaceful, but present.  I didn't find the service to be as harmonious as I expected, but they were very eager to please when asked.  I had the tuna tartare, the skate, and the pear dessert.  The tuna was fantastic; my only complaint is that they didn't give me a spoon so that I could slurp up the ginger sauce.  Don't worry - I managed with my fork and knife.  The skate was unique because it had some interesting spices, but was very delicious, and I joyed to find it piled on some chunky guacamole-type vegetables and beans.  The pear was a delightful finish to the meal and an appropriate fruit alternative to the uber-rich chocolate molten cake dessert (which was also very good, just like any other chocolate molten cake).  On the other hand, my partner had the strip loin and wasn't dazzled by the entree.There are a few flaws in the design of the restaurant itself.  There are only two bathrooms for Jean Georges and Nougatine combined.  One is a handicapped, and the other is a single stall smashed into a tiny room with a sink.  The line can get outrageous, and it gets uncomfortably crowded in the most uncomfortable situations.  Also, there was some issue with the doors that caused patrons to have to wait to enter and exit, and there was constantly a draft blowing through the dining room.  Additionally, there is no waiting area.  We were late, and had to wait for a table to be set.  I'm was very happy that they were still willing to honor our reservation, but we had to stand awkwardly in the shallow entrance-way while our table was being bused and reset.  There was so little room that I was continually bumped by the aforementioned problematic doors.  Finally, something was wrong with the spacing of the tables because my mother's chair was often bumped by the waitstaff.  All in all, it was a great experience and maybe the best deal in this city.  Given how a steak at Outback Steakhouse can range in the upper twenties (gag), this was $28 very, very well spent.",1,0,0,Marissa W.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,12,0

Nougatine fit the bill perfectly. While we were a little close to the table next to us, the room was beautiful and, while bustling, pretty serene.I ordered a ginger margarita, which was one of the best gingery drinks I've had. It wasn't too spicy or overpowering, but the flavor was there. The amuse was a shot of celery root soup (creamy and yummy) and a wild rice fritter, which was SO good. Would rather eat a bucket of those next time I got to the movies.The tuna tartare to start lived up to all the hype, though it definitely packed a spicy punch. The reduction around it tasted like a refined version of that delicious ginger dressing that comes on sushi-place salads---you know the one. Mmmm. I was so involved in the tartare that I've forgotten what my dad had...The cod with aromatic black beans was stunning. The brilliant white fish with a sprinkling of nutmeg and cinnamon contrasted on a bed of flavorful and moist black beans/avocados/carrots/crack, apparently. With my margarita it was like my own little upscale Mexican fiesta. My dad had the pork chop, which he didn't leave even a single speck of.

It's very bright in there, and I like the open kitchen.The calamari (yelp.com/biz_photos/Qd7Y…) was fried differently than most other places, and the touch of basil salt was great. The roasted organic chicken (yelp.com/biz_photos/Qd7Y…)was actually crispy, but also tasty and  tender. I didn't like the light mustard sauce that was under it  though. I tried some shrimp from my friend's shrimp salad (yelp.com/biz_photos/Qd7Y…)--- there were only about 4 pieces--- but it was delicious. For dessert, I had poached peaches with pistachio ice cream and hazelnut (yelp.com/biz_photos/Qd7Y…). I wasn't a fan of the peaches, but the pistachio ice cream paired with hazelnuts was delicious.

5.0,8/19/2010,"This was one of the most delicious lunches I've ever had. Well, I should say ""two"" lunches, since I went twice in 2 weeks. And considering the superb quality of food, it really is a great deal for lunch!! This Jean George restaurant is very airy and lets in a lot of light. The temperature of the restaurant is perfect (not freezing like many others). And needless to say, this place knows how to be classy. They have a lunch menu for $26 (not restaurant week) which I highly recommend. My favorite item from Nougatine AND Jean Georges is a simple little appetizer that made my taste buds jump in the air like a kid on a pogo-stick. It was the Shrimp Salad with Avocado, Tomato and Champagne dressing. As I type that I'm craving it right now. It was delectable.For the main courses I tried the Beef Tenderloin with Spinach and Gruyere Cheese Crepe... it was fantastic. The other time I also ordered something with beef, but I can't find it on the menu now (it was also delicious).For dessert both times I had the Jean Georges Warm Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream. I don't like cake... but I loveeee this! It's a molten lava cake and it just melts in your mouth. The Black Cherry Yuzu fizzy drink was also delicious - a little sweet though.

5.0,7/31/2010,"Dining at Nougatine was nothing short of a revelation. As a penny-pinching college student, I was feeling squeamish about my first high-end dining experience: what if they refuse to serve me once they notice my greenhorn expression and plucky enthusiasm? However, everything about Nougatine left me yearning for more. With an abundance of open space and seasonal décor, the interior of the restaurant was serene. And, right from the start, the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating.  My boyfriend and I originally reserved a table for 10:45AM, hoping foolishly to get an early, early lunch, since all later times were booked. To our dismay, breakfast was still being served at that time, but after inquiring, the hostesses graciously rebooked us for lunch service. In the same fashion, our waitress was sweet and down to earth, explaining the menu in depth and even going into to kitchen to answer our food-related questions. Ultimately, the star of my Nougatine experience was the food. The course selections were plentiful, diverse and tantalizing, despite being from a Restaurant Week menu. I began with a frisée stuffed artichoke that was meaty and fresh, accompanied by a mustard mayonnaise that was perfectly balanced in bite, acidity and creaminess. Within the mayo, thinly sliced gherkins added an extra layer of texture which contrasted nicely against the silkiness of the artichoke. My main course consisted of a luscious piece of salmon atop a warm potato salad and dressed with sugar-snap peas and grated horseradish. The fish was beautiful; it was cooked evenly without losing it firmness. The potatoes melted in my mouth but only after a surprisingly sharp tang of vinaigrette. The crisp peas topped off the dish by adding a sweet and bright aftertaste. Finally, I ended my meal with lemon verbena ice cream floating delicately above a chilled summer berry soup. The pungent yet sparkling flavor of the ice cream coupled with the complex taste of the soup (1 stone fruit, 2 berries and 4 types of currants!) left my palate cleansed and refreshed. Afterwards, I walked out of Nougatine feeling fantastic. I would definitely return in a heartbeat for more culinary enlightenment. Vongrichten has garnered himself one more fan (a big one!).",2,0,0,Yuhe C.,"New York, NY",70,150,10
4.0,7/31/2010,"I came here with some friends for lunch today, and I got the three-course prix-fixe menu. I chose the fried calamari with basil, salt, and citrus-chili dip, the grilled tenderloin of beef with a pesto sauce and carrots, and the signature Jean Georges warm chocolate cake with vanilla bean ice cream. The fried calamari was perfect - it had just the right amount of breading, and was really fresh and crisp. The accompanying dip was incredibly light to the point where it almost seemed more like a foam when I dipped the calamari into it. It had just the right amount of heat so that it wasn't overwhelming and complemented the calamari amazingly.The beef tenderloin was tasty - cooked medium as I requested, and had a nice texture and chew. It was also seasoned really well. I loved the doneness of the carrots - they were slightly crisp but not too much. The sauces that they came with, a pesto for the beef and some sort of creamy buttery sauce for the carrots, were also very tasty and paired well. The warm chocolate cake was very decadent ,and I loved the warm chocolate oozing out of the center of the cake. The mold of the cake was very attractive.I also tried my friend's red snapper (perfect doneness) and her fresh berries/ice cream dessert, and the flavor combinations were very impressive. One of the most stunning things about dining here was the presentation of the food. The colors on the plate seem to burst right off of it. I've posted four photos to share. The beef tenderloin and the berry presentation are incredibly colorful and tasty for the eye.The service overall was incredibly polite professional. Our water glasses were consistently filled, and we were asked multiple times how we enjoyed the food and our dining experience. I wasn't even allowed to open the door to go in between the lobby area and the dining area - there was always someone there to open it for me. The decor of the restaurant is a little fancy, but not to the point where it feels stuffy. Many people dining were in very casual clothing.The one annoying thing about dining here today was that there is only one bathroom for each sex, and only one stall! The women's line was ridiculous toward the end of our meal, and we had to wait a long time to use it. I'd lightly suggest to the management that they get a better (and much larger) bathroom. I'd definitely like to come back and experience the other dishes, as well as visit the Jean Georges restaurant right next door.",5,2,3,Yvonne W.,"New York, NY",99,396,219

Ordered 2 eggs any style - scrambled - with rye toast and fruit instead of potatoes. My companion ordered the omelet with wheat toast and potatoes. Everything was delicious and well presented. Keep in mind that portions are large - so you could easily split an entrée and maybe supplement with fruit or extra toast if needed. Heads up, gratuity is automatically added to the check - which I think is ridiculous and patronizing since I am perfectly capable of tipping in accordance with service.  Conclusion - very pleasant brunch place.

5.0,7/30/2010,"My Restaurant Week meal at Nougatine was the best I've had in recent memory. Everything I tried - from the tuna tartare with ginger dressing that literally melted in my mouth, to the tart lemon verbena ice cream served with an array of berries so wide I didn't know some existed (there are whitecurrants?) for dessert - had exceptionally clean and complex flavors. Undoubtedly some of the best food I've had in my life.Even though the food speaks for itself, Nougatine lacks nothing in the way of ambiance or service, either. The interior design feels very calming, with nice decorative touches like flowering asparagus on the tables.

3.0,7/29/2010,"It's quite possible we ate here on an off night. We have a huge crush on JoJo's, another Jean Georges restaurant, and so we had high expectations that we'd be impressed here, too. Unfortunately, these expectations fell a bit flat.For reasons too complicated to explain, I didn't have any alcohol with dinner, and I only ordered two appetizers.  So take my review with a grain of salt. The appetizers: tuna tartare and peekytoe crab.  The tartare had good flavor over a bed of sauce, although a bit unusual and strong.  Tasty, but unsettling perhaps. Hard to taste the tuna. The peekytoe crab was extremely fresh, but overly wet, and was topped with a spicy sorbet.  If you think this is one of those combinations that sound incredibly strange, well you win!  Strange. Not horrible, just weird.  I actually quite like weird, but let's just call it - this didn't really work.The salmon was fresh, although a bit undercooked (more rare than medium rare), but did have an extremely tasty, bold sauce. The crispy rice was interesting and I found myself unable to stop eating it off my husband's plate.Service was not up to par. It was basic service.  Not very friendly, not attentive enough . . . just not up to a Jean Georges standard IMHO.",1,0,0,Jenn K.,"San Diego, CA",80,505,8
5.0,7/26/2010,"Nougatine reminds me of quintessential New York.  Huge glass windows in the front of the restaurant that look over Central Park, a  bustling open air kitchen that serves food based on technique, panache, and quality and a finely crafted bar that serves classics as well as contemporary libations.Nougatine was my first experience at a Jean Georges establishment.  I felt butterflies of excitement in my stomach as I was walking up to the front entrance.  Once inside  I found myself in true contemporary elegance.  Everything was arranged perfectly...the tables, the artwork, the soft lighting gently floating down the walls.  The service was top notch, not a beat was missed.....everything that was ordered came out to the table seamlessly (and there were 6 of us at the table.)  We were served an amuse of  watermelon gazpacho with raspberries.  My favorite dish was the appetizer I ordered: the warm beet salad with aged balsamic and lemon oil.  The Caesar salad was excellent.  The crunchy baked free range chicken was delectable (highly recommend if you love chicken the way I do).  I was also able to taste the pan seared beef tenderloin, delicious.  All of the food fits right into the perfection of the restaurant.  I might sound corny but I felt as though the entire experience had a dreamy, ethereal quality to it!  I highly recommend if you are looking for a fine dining restaurant without having that stuffy, suffocating quality!",3,0,3,Noell M.,"Lafayette Hill, PA",34,101,0
4.0,7/26/2010,"This fine restaurant is located in the Trump building. I found this out the hard way, by walking all around Columbus Circle. When facing the building, the restaurant will be on your left. Don't try to enter through the hotel, the doorman will simply re-direct you. For Sunday brunch, the dress was a little more casual. Plenty of people were wearing sneakers and flip flops. However, there were a lot of people wearing casual dresses as well. The restroom is located outside of the restaurant, behind the hostess stand. The service was impeccable. I have gone to a couple of ""high-class"" restaurants, but this is the first restaurant to really deliver high class service. Servers were extremely amiable: The water refills were unending. Waiters pulled out seats for ladies. The hostess complimented my dress, etc. The food was very good (the service made it taste better). Our waitress took the time to explain each dish for us. I got the tuna tartare that had an avocado base and radishes on top. Although, I didn't care for the radishes, the avocado complemented the tuna very well. The sweet and sour sauce that was poured upon serving was delicious and added even more flavor to the dish. For my entree, I had the the roasted organic chicken with summer vegetables. The vegetables were artfully arranged around the chicken. The one complaint I have about the vegetables is that they were somewhat wilted and, I think, at some point frozen. They even looked microwaved. I hope that is not the case. In any case, the chicken was tender and juicy. The skin was very crispy and accompanied with a special butter. The chicken also sat on a sweet, creamy, off-white sauce that helped enhance the natural juiciness of the meat. Overall, a lovely place with lovely service. I would definitely recommend this place for brunch to impress tourists, first dates, and in-laws. Especially since the brunch prix fixe is only $26 (regular brunch). The a la carte dishes are also affordable (teens to 20s), considering the great service and food.",5,0,5,Stacy T.,"New York, NY",200,324,213

4.0,7/24/2010,"This was my first Jean George restaurant. I enjoyed the overall experience. I think my standards were a bit high, but upon deeper reflection, the food was pretty good. Every dish was unique, light, yet very flavorful - perfect for the steamy NYC summer. I went with the RW menu with an extra app on the side. Here's the breakdown ...Watermelon amous(sp?) - Basically pureed watermelon with some seasoning. It was free so automatically 5 stars in my book.Tuna tartare - I'm mixed on this one. It tastes like home (tuna sashimi with ginger dressing). I like it, but I don't think I'd would ever pay for the a la carte price.Slowly cooked salmon, with potatoes, sweet peas, and horseradish - I'm not a fan of horseradish, BUT I liked this dish. Salmon cooked perfectly, and horseradish added a good zing.  Berries and lemon ice cream - Good light summer dessert. I love berries, but I secretly wished I got the molten chocolate cake and vanilla bean ice cream.Foie gras with warm strawberries - This is the dish I will return to Nougatine for. My first foie gras was an absolute life changing experience. Caramelized strawberry on top of a soft melt in your mouth layer of foie gras with a hint of alcohol. Yum!  Overall, good food experience.

4.0,7/23/2010,"I'm holding this place to high standards because I've heard so much that I'm almost destined to over expect. The food stands at 3.5 stars, but seeing Jean Georges himself working hard at the kitchen and making rounds at the tables might just have tipped this experience over to 4 stars.The bite-sized toast that's part of amuse bouche was delightful. The appetizer was my favorite dish of the night - tuna tartare that was not over seasoned, but sat on top of a layer of avocado and mixed well with the ginger-flavored dressing. The organic chicken was roasted well, a simple dish which was satisfying. It was the kind of meal I wanted on a summery night. By the time the dessert and the second glass of wine were finished, we knew we had a good time when we decided that we wanted more happiness, in the form of a mojito, from the Stone Rose lounge across the street at Time Warner.Forget about the big name that's associated with the restaurant.

Somewhere halfway through the meal, we also ordered a bottle of champagne. My tuna tartar starter was amazing. And my friend's seemingly simple salad appetizer was delicious. The best part of the meal for me was the salmon. I don't think I've ever had salmon cooked this way (somewhat raw) and it was definitely the best salmon dish I've ever had. The potatoes went with it nicely. The chicken was also solid as was the beef. And of course, the warm chocolate cake desert was delicious.

Here's a quick breakdown of my overall experience. Food: 3 (Dessert: 5***)Service: 4.5Ambiance: 4Located on the first floor of the Trump hotel and in Columbus Circle, the restaurant has a pretty nice view. The decor of the restaurant is nice, especially since it has a business casual dress code. The service was fantastic. They have 2-3 waiters who constantly watched our table to pour us water and supply us with appetizer bread. On to the food. Each of us ordered an appetizer, entree, and dessert. I got the 1) Fried Calamari with Basil Salt and Citrus Chili Dip - the calamari was cooked really well. It was slightly crunchy with just the right amount of soft chewyness. However, I didn't quite like the chili dip because the sourness was a little overwhelming and it didn't accentuate the calamari. 2) Roasted Red Snapper with Broccoli Rabe and Sweet Garlic Lemon Broth - the snapper fish was roasted just right. It had the right amount of crunchy outer layer. Once again, I found the broth to be too sour as well. It was well done, but my mouth didn't get to experience a very rich fulfilling flavor. 3) For dessert, I got the Jean George Warm Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream - the dessert took them a while to serve, but it was the best part of my meal. the warm chocolate cake was just right, without it being too rich or sweet. as you delve further into the cake, you have warm chocolate pudding sauce oozing out. at the same time, the vanilla bean ice cream was equally amazing. it sits on top of the crunchy oreo cookie crumbs, which really adds on to the flavor and texture. overall, i think the food was great and the presentation was pretty well down. however, because of the reputation, i was expecting more and became a little disappointed.",0,0,0,Joyce B.,"San Francisco, CA",308,474,39

For me, those were the highlights outside of the green tea foam/kumquat component of the citrus dessert trio and the homemade marshmallows that are hand-cut at the table.Rhubarb seems to be one of the chefs' muses both on the savory and sweet sides. A broth/syrup of it nicely accompanied the foie gras brûlé. Rhubarb also made an appearance with strawberry for the mini macarons at the end and also was an option on the dessert menu.We happily sampled and swirled together the flavor combinations of the trout, cod, beef tenderloin, salmon and so on.

Creamy but light at the same time and the perfect way to start the meal.  It was actually quite a large salad and I was pretty fully after just this first course.  Calamari: My friend got the calamari so I was able to sneak a few pieces.  There is some sort herb in the batter that just gave it that extra kick of flavor.  While i was not a fan of the dipping sauce bit, the calamari itself was exquisite.  Red Snapper:  Maybe I was just too full already from the salad but it was only alright.  The broth complemented the fish well but I guess I'm just not that big a fan of snapper.  The broccoli rabe was good but the other giant scallion looking things were definitely not.  Not a fan. Warm Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream/ Creme Caramel with Orange slices: The only meh entree was definitely redeemed with dessert.  While the chocolate cake was delicious, the Vanilla Ice Cream definitely stole the show on that plate.  The fresh and very fragrant vanilla was unlike any other vanilla ice cream I've ever had.  The creme caramel was like a flan that just melted in your mouth.  Silky and smooth with just the right amount of sweetness.  It was a great lunch in a lovely restaurant and the perfect way to start our day.",0,0,0,Dee Dee X.,"Los Angeles, CA",99,136,35

The service is undoubtedly worse though, and overall it doesn't feel as luxurious. We all got the tasting ($68, pretty reasonable), and were pleased overall.Cocktails were nothing to write home about, but competent. We had a decent bottle of zin as well.Tuna tartar was quite nice. Wife ate the second half of mine (she gave me the puppy dog eyes; I had no choice).I got my revenge on the fois gras, which was too rich for her but I happily finished both of ours. Creamy, salty, very nice.Red snapper was perfectly prepared, but a little bland.Tenderloin was great, and the brussels sprouts made a great accompaniment.Desserts were nice, and my double espresso is powering this review.Service - like everything else - was entirely competent, but seemed to be coasting. Something has to set this apart from its big brother through the curtain. Our waiter did a nice job spacing out our meal, and we took our time. Bottom line: very competent on all regards, tasting was quite good, will return.",0,1,0,Alex E.,"Philadelphia, PA",3,14,0
3.0,3/27/2010,"Nougatine Tasting Menu ($68/person). We wandered into the Trump building out of the cold weekend night for our reservation. We checked our coats and were seated in less than 3 minutes.Theme, if I had to choose one: Salty with a side of meyer lemon...We started with a poached shrimp and celery apple soup amuse bouche that really prepared the palette for intense and subtle flavors.The first course is tuna tartare which is absolutely one of the best I've ever had. It sits on bed of avocado and is joined by a spicy radish ginger marinade. You have to go easy on the sauce or it overpowers the whole bite.The second and probably worst dish was Foie Gras Brulee and meyer lemon jam. Overly salty (becoming a theme) and just another martyr of foie gras (see my review of Balthazar). The textures were scattered and I would have gladly done without this dish (except the jam being the one high note).Our fish dish would be the Roasted Red Snapper accompanied by broccoli raab and sweet garlic-lemon broth. Great dish with incredible sauces. Second best dish out of the five.Last entree was a Pan-Seared Beef Tenderloin with miso butter and roasted brussel sprouts. Again the sauce is super salty, but works with the beef (especially if you like it rare).The dessert really stands on its own. I wouldn't mind walking into Nougatine, sitting at the bar, and just having a dessert platter with drinks. You can even get the larger J-G platter at the bar. Our final course was a dessert sampler with the highly acclaimed (and rightfully so) Warm Chocolate Cake with vanilla bean ice cream and the Sticky Toffee Pudding tamarind-cider sauce and meyer lemon sorbet.There are simple gestures expected of this top tier restaurant and the staff definitely proved them. Service was seamless. Water cups and drinks remained filled. I also recommend the Black Cherry-Yuzu specialty drink (non-alcoholic).",7,5,5,Will C.,"Queens, NY",2444,627,584

5.0,3/26/2010,"Went for the three-course lunch prix fixe for $28 (about the same price as Jean Georges, but you get dessert!)  The Tuna Tartare, Avocado, Spicy Radish and Ginger Marinade was amazing.  They finish it off with the broth tableside (waiter described it as Ginger, Chili and Miso Broth).  Loved the spiciness of the tuna and the crunch of the radish.Pan-roasted Cod, Warm cranberry beans, Leek vinaigrette was also very good, but could've used a hint more seasoning.  The Slowly Cooked Salmon with Braised Mushrooms, Poblano Pepper and Dill was perfectly cooked medium-rare was one of the best salmon dishes I've tried.  The Pan Seared Beef Tenderloin, Miso Butter and Roasted Brussel Sprouts was tender and seasoned well.  Miso Butter sauce was delicious.Yes, you can choose two entrees for your first two courses, so go ahead and order salmon and beef tenderloin if you so desire.As for dessert, the Citrus Creme Caramel is a great choice if you don't like overly sweet, but the Warm Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream is just too good to pass up!  The chocolate is just melting when you cut into it and I love contrasting flavors and temperatures.If you're on the fence between Nougatine and Jean Georges, the food is exactly the same.  There's only one kitchen for both restaurants and Nougatine used to be part of Jean Georges before they split it off into the more casual side.  You'll get the 3 Michelin Star experience without the high prices for dinner.  A must for any New Yorker or anyone visiting.",0,0,0,Adrian G.,"Mountain View, CA",34,53,217
2.0,3/24/2010,"I chose to eat at Nougatine last Thursday because it was such a beautiful day and the restaurant has such large windows. We were seated immediately. Our waiter who just got off the bitter, rejected actor train arrived. We let him know which appetizer we'd like while we perused the rest of the menu when he promptly told us that he would only take complete orders. Before we could answer he walked away. He must have walked up to Lincoln Center and back because we didn't see him for a good 20 minutes. Once he took our orders we didn't see him again until he dropped our check. The food was barely edible. The crab cake appetizer was bland. My date had the salmon which was noticeably fishy and I ordered the Crispy Coach Farms Goat Cheese fondue, pear and crystallized pecan salad. It wasn't fondue at all.... just dry goat cheese wrapped in phyllo. Bizarre. Anyway - the place was a bust but my date wasn't.

3.0,3/12/2010,"The most memorable thing about this meal was the blistering cold weather and the slow service but don't worry dear Yelpers, this isn't a terrible review. This is however, my least favorite of all of JG's restaurants.I'm not going to lie, this place is gorgeous. Located in the Trump Plaza in the heart of Columbus Circle, the floor to ceiling glass windows lend a view that's unparalleled. Not to mention it is by far the best pre-fixe I have ever heard of!Five star restaurant experience, Three course meal for under $30.In ANY economic situation, that's still unheard of!My tuna tartare appetizer was absolutely fantastic. Very fresh, perfectly diced morsels of melt-in-your-mouth tuna. My ""man I was dating at the time""'s butternut squash soup came beautifully presented, with the dressings at the bottom of a pristine, white bowl. The waiter poured the creamy buttercup-colored soup into the bowl without breaking a ripple and it was enjoyed by the two of us until the very last drop.The entrees were good. My salmon was cooked well and the crispy chicken, juicy and tender.The flourless chocolate cake was where I was less-than-impressed.It was warm- yes.It was gooey- yes.But....somewhere along the warm, gooey journey, the road curved to lackluster and I was left unimpressed.The service there was pretty slow. It took us almost 3 hours to finish a three-course meal. For once, my slow eating was NOT the problem. Lunch at Nougatine followed by dessert and shopping at Time Warner.

5.0,3/10/2010,"Both the formal Jean-Georges dining room and the less formal adjacent Nougatine at Jean-Georges restaurant are located in the Trump International Hotel and Towers building, right in Columbus Circle, across from Central Park. I have dined twice at Nougatine at the bar, and it has been a lovely experience on both occasions.  They offer both Nougatine and Jean-Georges menus at the bar, and I have opted to dine from Nougatine twice thus far.  I hope to try Jean-Georges' menu another time (it has three Michelin stars after all), but I have found when I'm dining alone it makes more sense to save that extra money for future special occasions where I might find myself splurging more.  As a matter of fact, the night I dined at Nougatine last week, shortly after I left the restaurant I was told that Cindy Crawford showed up (I guess there's only enough room for one beautiful woman at a time and I had to leave before she could enter... at least that's what I'll tell myself), sat in the formal dining room, but dined from the Nougatine menu.  I guess I'm not the only one keeping it real, haha.Now that I've got you all in the Jean-Georges mood, I can share what I ate most recently on my visit.  I chose to ""splurge"" and enjoy the Nougatine tasting menu which consisted of an amuse bouche and five courses including a dessert tasting ($68 compared to $148 for a tasting off the Jean-Georges menu).  I also enjoyed a perfectly-made (thanks, Justin) lemon drop martini with my meal and some yummy vin santo dessert wine with my last course.  First off was the amuse bouche which was a duo of peekytoe crab over creme fraiche, with green apple in the spoon and a shooter of apple and celery root soup with a touch of spicy oil to follow.  Very tasty... the crab/creme/apple spoon was fresh and mildly sweet with the soup having a more sweet but delicious follow-up, not a bad way to start the meal.Next I had their famous tuna tartare (which I had also enjoyed last summer at lunch).  It is served over avocado (such a perfect pairing), topped with sliced radishes, and surrounded by a pool of spicy ginger marinade.  The marinade has a very strong flavor, but it pairs really well with the cool and mild tuna and avocado, while the radishes add a nice crunch-factor.The second official course was Nougatine's famous foie gras brulee, which is served over brioche and then paired with a meyer-lemon jam.  This dish was probably my least favorite of those I tried.  I like foie gras, but I think the flavor was pretty overpowering and the sugar crust didn't really add much (in fact it almost ruined it for me).  I liked the jam though, and I did finish my plate (not gonna let perfectly good foie gras go to waste) but I probably wouldn't order this dish on its own in the future.Onto the fish course (my favorite)... last summer I tried their seasonal red snapper dish which was a highlight for me, and their current red snapper did not fail to win me over either.  It was sublimely roasted with an amazingly crisp skin, served over a sweet garlic-lemon broth and topped with broccoli raab.  I was tempted to come back another time and order this dish again on its own.  It was very very satisfying!Next it was time for a good, old-fashioned meat course: Pan Roasted Beef Tenderloin, Miso Butter and Roasted Brussel Sprouts.  The beef was cooked perfectly (which I think can be a challenge for a thinner slice of meat, but it was not over-cooked at all), the brussels sprouts were fairly charred, which imparted a very strong flavor.  I personally love brussels sprouts and I enjoyed seeing them in a fine dining establishment, and also cooked in a way that adds an additional layer of flavor and texture to the dish.  By this point I was so full, I sadly couldn't finish my food :(  Alas, I took a short break before dessert was brought over so I could make some room for what was sure to be something special...And onto dessert, a tasting trio: Warm Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, Sticky Toffee Pudding with Blood Orange and Tamarind-Cider Sauce, and Meyer Lemon Sorbet.  I couldn't finish any of the components (shame on me!), but I loved them all.  The meyer lemon sorbet was what you would imagine, a refreshing sweet-and-sour palate cleanser, done well as is expected.  The chocolate cake here I believe was the ""original"" molten chocolate cake (but don't take my word for it).  It is wonderful with that perfect bit of vanilla bean ice cream to play off the otherwise hot temperature of the dish.  Finally, the sticky toffee pudding was really delicious as well, nice and sweet, but not over the top.  With a chocolate element and a citrus element on the plate, it was really nice to have something different to balance out those two extremes in flavor and it didn't disappoint.  Yum!All in all, this was a really enjoyable experience!  I am definitely a fan of Jean-Georges and look forward to dining here (and at his other restaurants) in the future.",1,0,1,Victoria K.,"Cranston, RI",579,664,2519

5.0,3/3/2010,"Outstanding start to finish.  From the beautiful popcorn, wasabi peanut and spicy almond snacks at the bar....to the last drop of coffee, everything was delicious!!!!!!I cant get over the amazing 'winter' menu they offer as a holdover from restaurant week.  I hate to think of myself as going for an early bird special, but when you can get 4 incredible courses from the great Jean-Georges for $38, who wouldnt be ecstatic???Before our first course we were brought a taste of a cinnamon apple spiced soup, and a spoonful of crabmeat over creme fraiche.  It was a perfect starter, and completely woke us up and got us ready for the unbelievable experience to come.The first course was a choice between a butternut squash soup over black mushrooms with lemongrass, or tuna tartare. Yea, i probably should be sick of butternut squash soup by now-- it seems to be a nyc staple in the winter, but im not.  It was incredible.  But not as incredible as the tuna tartare over avocado-- one of the best tuna tartares I've ever had.  The ginger soy sauce that was poured around it was good enough to eat as a soup, but Im so glad that it was poured on the plate and not ""on"" the tuna because the pure flavor of the tuna itself, and even the flavor of the avocado proves how the quality of the ingredients selected demonstrate the skill of a chef as much as anything he does with those ingredients thereafter.Second course, possibly the best cooked salmon i've ever eaten served with hen of the woods mushrooms, and a crunchy buttery crumb covered plate.  I literally cleaned my plate it was so good.  I didnt try the shrimp salad that was the other choice for course #2 but I was told it was just as good.Third course was a choice between a Pat La Frida cheeseburger with fries (so good!) or a crispy roast chicken-- again, it ranks among the best chicken dishes Ive ever eaten.  Not #1 but damn close.  Anyone who thinks chicken is a dull choice for dinner has never had chicken properly prepared.  Finally, dessert.  Im not really a dessert person but when you're sitting in the signature restaurant of the person who created one of the most copied desserts in america-- you try it.  So I had the warm chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream, and practically floated away on it.  Dense creamy center, lighter than air cake with a touch of crispiness to the outside.   I heard the vanilla creme caramel was even better, but I was too focused on my chocolate cake to find out.Top everything off with a great capuccino, jelly candies and a chocolate coated lemon rind, a table full of good friends to share and enjoy it all with, and you've got a perfect evening-- and thanks to the early birdness of the night-- lots of time to digest.

5.0,2/28/2010,"This is one of the few highly rated restaurants in nyc that has truly lived up to my expectations! Genuinely amazing food, great combinations of flavors that are unique, and the prix fixe lunch is an incredible deal. The service was excellent, and they were very understanding as we ran about half an hour late. I went with 3 friends and we shared all 8 dishes:Roasted Brussel Sprouts - I was dead set on getting this after trying the amazing Beef Sirloin with Brussel Sprouts at Nougatine. In the salad, the brussel sprouts were more raw (I liked how crispy they were at Nougatine). The vinaigrette added the most flavor & paired really well with the pistachios. In retrospect I probably would've ordered something else as this dish was good but not spectacular.Foie Gras Brulee - the texture of the foie gras and (I think) the piece of crispy bread underneath was a perfect blend, and it went so well with the lemon jam (which was good enough to eat by itself). Excellent appetizer.Gulf Shrimp - WOW, the texture of this shrimp was amazing! I never knew shrimp could be anything except rubbery, but biting into this i was immediately astounded. The water chestnut added just that perfect bit of extra crunch. Plus the sauce was brilliant, everyone at my table loved it! One of the favorite dishes of the meal.Butternut Squash Soup - The other favorite dish in our first course! Everyone was raving about this soup and dying to go home and try to cook this themselves (not that any of us could come anywhere close to this recipe). The flavor was incredible and the soup had the perfect texture, not too thick or too thin. No complaints, and everyone loved this dish! We made sure to finish every last drop with the bread we were served.Salmon - The texture of this fish was done perfectly. The puree added a really good flavor. If you are a huge fan of salmon, get this dish. Otherwise, it was really good but not incredibly memorable.Red Snapper - We all raved about the sauce - it definitely played with my senses! Buttery, rich, slightly tart, salty, sweet - I'm not sure how to quite pinpoint it but damn it was good!Caramelized Sweetbreads - The sweetbreads were really soft & cooked very well. The sherry vinegar emulsion was a little too strong for me - it almost shocked me the first bite I took. Everyone else at the table liked it - maybe because I gave them the heads up. The candied pumpkin was DELICIOUS. Just go light on the vinegar and it goes really really well with the soft texture of the sweetbread & the sweetness of the pumpkin.Beef Tenderloin - We asked for medium rare and the beef was cook exceptionally well. The texture was absolutely perfect; your teeth slice through the meat with just the right amount of resistance - not overcooked at all. The potatoes, spinach, and puree were fine but nothing memorable. Get this dish if you are a big fan of beef as the meat was amazing; the rest of the dish was probably the most bland of anything we got at the restaurant.Unfortunately the prix fixe lunch doesn't include dessert but we shared two anyway:Chocolate cake - A MUST! The vanilla bean ice cream was absolutely amazing, everyone loved this. The chocolate cake was so warm, rich, delicious, gooey, and has a perfect hint of dark chocolate bitterness. Citrus - There was a green tea parfait with a lemon flavored center and a crunchy layer on the bottom with pop-rocks. The pop rocks were an awesome addition! The flavors of everything went really well together. It also came with an apricot (I think?) tart with a sorbet that went really well together as well.All in all an amazing experience. Our waiter knew everything on the menu really well, especially the wines, and the food was delicious.POSITIVES:- Excellent, excellent food. Must haves: Gulf Shrimp, Butternut Squash Soup, Red Snapper, Sweetbreads, Chocolate Cake.- Incredible service. Knowledgeable, patient, and everything was presented really well. - The prix fixe lunch is an incredible deal for such a great restaurant.- Very well decorated - simple/chic, calming atmosphere, lots of sunlight during the day, great view of the park / Columbus Circle.NEGATIVES:- Umm none?

But please order the cooked fish dishes or else you might end up with 4 shrimp on a pile of lettuce (salad) or a pile of chopped up tuna (tartare) or worse, a burger (*gasp*). The snapper was the best by far, seared perfectly topped with unique greens, in a delicate garlic lemon broth. Salmon with fresh dill over mixed mushrooms was also delicious (enoki, porcini, shiitake). Beef tenderloin was small and not as tender as I've had before, but tasty nontheless. Cod over cranberry, beans and viniagrette was good but definite 3rd to the other 2 cooked fishes.

5.0,1/26/2010,"Yum. Yum. Yum.  Perhaps because I read the previous reviews about people attending for Restaurant Week and not being treated so well, I had very low expectations, but this place blew me out of the water.  First, I was debating on going because I couldn't find a menu online, and low and behold, they post the full RW menu on their website.  My mom and I both had a really delicious butternut squash soup, garnished with mushrooms and chives to start. Previous to this we were brought a scallop, pickled green apple thing and a shot of celery root and green apple soup as an amuse bouche. For a second course, my mom ordered the mesclen salad with shrimp and I had a salmon and mushroom dish.  What astounded me were how big these portions were!  The salmon was the size of deck of cards, and this was only our second course.For the main entree I had their burger, which was perfect and delicious, and my mom had a cereal crusted chicken served with orange and lemon juice poached carrots.  Finally, for dessert, we had the chocolate cake and creme caramel.  No complaints there.  The service was great.  Every person we interacted with was kind and knowledgeable.  I really can't wait to find an excuse to go back.",2,0,0,Natalie W.,"Culver City, CA",38,246,23

I'm not sure why people go here for lunch during restaurant week because their $26 prix fix lunch is all year around, I guess, except during Restaurant Week. Everything was solid and delicious, and I definitely got my money's worth. No complaints but I didn't leave completely blown away either, so I'm giving it four stars as I expected juuust a little more from a Jean Georges restaurant. Here's what I had: Tuna Tartare with avocado, spicy radish, ginger marinade. - It was delicious, but I've had much better tuna tartare - seemed a bit borderline bland. The best presentation I've seen for a tartar dish tho. Slowly cooked salmon, braised (shimeji) mushrooms, poblano pepper and dill - The salmon was cooked perfectly, the sauce was delicious, but again, didn't blow me away.

What amazing food!I almost wonder if the owner realizes what a great deal the $26 prix fixe lunch is!We shared four entrees between the two of us, including salmon, red snapper, beef tenderloin and chicken. Each dish was exquisitely sauced and delicious. The neighboring customer's tuna tartare also looked excellent. Enough has been written on yelp about the entrees that I don't feel the need to add to the description. However, I do wish to comment about the service.We sat at the bar and enjoyed excellent, attentive service from our waitress. For example, the fish entrees were delivered first, and the staff waited for us to finish our opening entrees before delivering our meat entrees. Even though the service was unobtrusive, our every need was attended to: our glasses of Pelligrino were never empty (btw, there is a flat fee of $3.50 for unlimited sparking water). The empty dishes were removed with class, and the waitress brought us fresh cutlery for each dish including dessert and coffee.

I was pleasantly full and the meal did satisfy me until the appropriate, socially-acceptable amount of time passed before I should eat my next meal. I did prepare myself by over-eating bread though.

4.0,11/29/2009,"See photos for details;)  I admonish myself for being a wretched slacker, as this review is from Sept. 30th.Per Se has been my much-desired, creme de la creme restaurant to try for years, but as Jean Georges had just won the James Beard award in May, when my best friend Peter promised to take me to eat wherever I wanted, JG topped the list. Enter a sunny September day, a paycheck to burn, and a promise to fulfill - egads! Peter took me to Jean-Georges!The Review:We had an 8 PM reservation but arrived not much after 7 and were promptly seated, much to our happiness, in a not-yet crowded dining room.  Overall: the food, environs, service, and above all, my dining companion, were exquisite. What I was not a fan of was being seated right next to the waiter stand - as your attention is constantly diverted to the waiters going back and forth and stopping right next to your table. Also, I did not like how one has to walk through Nougatine to arrive in JG or back through both to use the restroom. It just felt odd and awkward to me. Those would be the only negatives. The food was predominately wonderful, with a few subtle misses.Anyone who reads my reviews knows the amuse-bouche is probably one of my favorite things in the world, so when the waiter brought out three gorgeous amuse for us, each better than the next, I knew I was in for a treat.  The bite of snapper beat, and plum was creamy, spicy, and earthy all at once.  The tiny corn fritter burst with flavor as each juicy singular corn kernel crunched in my mouth, enrobed in succulent cream. The shot of tomato gazpacho followed with a delightful sweet tang. First course: I had the Autumn tasting menu and my friend had the standard JG tasting menu - which I must say - beat mine.Our first courses were both of the caviar and egg variety, mine was osetra atop a little sandwich of egg and creme fraiche between two caviar toasts. It was light and buttery with the caviar being almost too dominate. Peter however adored my dish and felt it combined all the flavors perfectly. On the other hand his Egg Caviar was delivered gorgeously whipped and placed back in an egg shell, topped with osetra. What a glorious amalgamation of flavors - vodka cream, caviar, soft boiled egg.  Just be sure to get it all in one spoonful!2) Hamachi sashimi vs Scallops! Peter found the hamachi sashimi to be one of his favorite courses. While I felt the lemony vinaigrette overpowered the fish, Peter loved the fact the vinaigrette ""beats you up"" then, ""like a dream became ethereal and the sashimi really came through, with the pecans added needed texture.""Scallops - tremendous. The cauliflower and raisin emulsion so perfectly saturated the rich flavor of the scallops that the tang and decadence culminated in a perfect dish. Peter, previously an anti-sea-food-ite, was in love. 3) Again, Peter's course kicked mine's arse. Why? He had the ""young garlic soup"" with frog legs. He actually was amused to find the frogs legs ""tangy at first then mellowed and really do taste like chicken."" I disagree - I think frog legs taste like grease and dark meat, whether they are sauteed by Vongerichten or deep fried in Alabama. However,  the soup, poured table-side, was fabulous: ""the taste of pure bliss.""  My dish was a risotto - lovely with mushrooms, and hints of cream corn and mint.  Somewhat unmemorable however, and looked a mess.4) Sea bass vs TurbotAgain, the turbot off the regular tasting menu wins, hands down. It was a very mild fish in a Chateau Chalon sauce, topped with a bit of an almost pico de gallo-like salad. Another one of Peter's favorite dishes.  My sea bass - The fish was subtle and meaty, but did not shine as sea bass can. Also we found the arrangement of tasteless eggplant puree and buttery poblano cream (underutilized) adorning my plate like a swollen vagina a bit... erm.. unattractive. 5) the Lobstahs. Both gorgeously presented. Mine came in gorgeous celery and ice wine ver jus but the texture was a bit slimy. Peter's was of a much meatier texture in a very good fenugreek broth.6) Squab w/onion compote and corn pancake. The compote was delicious but this came with the smallest portion of foie gras I have seen in my life. :(  The squab, while prepared perfectly - Peter couldn't get passed the fact he was eating Pigeon ;)     My venison was again perfectly prepared with excellent broccoli raab and cabrales foam. Peter noted a coco flavor and said he could eat a ""whole slab"" of this.7) Peter opted for a cheese plate here, and snagged a ""bleu"" from Rogue River Oregon that he found smokey, much like gouda, and terrific.8) Desserts, indeed. Peter's chocolate tasting was nice, aside from the lava cake (of which I am never a fan). My 'market' was inspired and fun - esp. the blueberry fizz. This is already too long so I will just say - wonderful night, excellent meal, good service, you won't be disappointed.Now that it's winter, maybe I should go back!THANKS Peter!!!",4,3,3,Valerie J.,"Sheboygan, WI",152,296,3312

2.0,10/18/2009,"Two disappointing dining experiences in one week. whaaa! I've eaten in the main dinning room here and loved it. I was completely unhappy with our time here. The amuse-bouche was the best thing we had all night. I ordered the calamari for my appetizer and it came out fried. There was NO mention of ""crispy"" or ""tempura"" or anything of the like. When they brought it over they could see I was not happy, but didn't seem to care. Also, I barely touched it and our waiter didn't even ask why? I had the Salmon for my main, which was fine. Not great, but fine. My husband ordered the Lobster and it also came fried with NO warning. He barely touched the Lobster and again, no question of his satisfaction of the dish. We eat out a lot and we both have much bigger eyes then our stomachs. Almost everywhere we go, our server will ask, ""Was everything okay with your dish?"" And usually, the answer is ""Yes, we're just stuffed!"" But, here-no one seemed to care if we were happy or not. Our waiter disappeared for such a long stretch that we asked to order dessert from the busboy. In the main dinning room, the desserts are the highlight. Here, they seem an afterthought.

We commented on how it's interesting that Jean Georges' is rated with 3 stars on the Michelin Guide but this place isn't, especially since the food is from the same kitchen. The food - I ordered the grilled pork chop with asparagus and he ordered the tasting menu which consisted of tuna tartare, foie gras, snapper, beef tenderloin and a dessert tasting. I think the only UNIQUE item was the foie gras, which was so buttery smooth and interestingly enough, caramelized so that it had a pleasant and light sweetness to it. All the other items were very average items without distinct signature flavors. Too bad because the food was good, just not unique for the cost. I also ordered a glass of wine - which was not bad about $4.50 for a half glass. =)The price - Well, it's not bad for a French restaurant. The tasting menu was $68 and my entree was $28. But...being the voracious eater that I am, it doesn't sit well that so much money was shelled out for such a small portion of food. I guess I'll have to chalk it up to experience! The La Rochelle in Tokyo, Japan oddly enough, had a better tasting menu and at a cheaper price...but then again, you'd have to go to Japan...The ambiance - A very mellow and seemingly ""after work hangout"" place. It is a bit loud (because it's basically Jean Georges' bar) but not overly so that we couldn't hear each other. It seems like a good place for a group hangout.

I got the tuna tartar appetizer which was good but not nearly as good as the calamari that my friend ordered. We both agreed that the calamari was the BEST we had ever had. I think a lot of other people agreed too because when we went back on Sunday and tried to order the calamari they told us they had run out over the weekend!

The pacing (12-15 minutes between each plate) made the dining experience that much more enjoyable as we never felt rushed.After trying numerous prix-fixe menus at upscale dining establishment only to be disappointed by either portions or choices,  to find a tasting menu that has an extensive list of items that I'd want to try (including the signature beef tenderloin and chocolate cake recommended by Yelpers) was quite exciting. The tasting menu ($68) included:Tuna tartare with avocado and radish - the strong ginger marinade was quite overwhelming, and the tartare wasn't particularly fresh tasting. Okay, but nothing memorable.Fois gras brule with cherry yuzu compote - a wonderful combination of texture and taste; tastes of the compote and fois gras are distinguishable as you are choosing and neither compromises the other in any way.Red snapper with lily-bulb radish salad - perfectly cook without the toughness that comes with each bite for typically prepared snappers either at Thai restaurants or Malaysian places.Grilled beef tenderoin with garlic, parsley, and chili - tender, juicy, done medium to medium-rare. Portion is quite reasonable even for a tasting menu. Chili sauce added a nice kick to each bite. Excellent.Warm chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream - soft, silky smooth goodness that melts in your mouth.

I originally had made a reservation of 4 but 2 friends bailed, so the restaurant was able to accommodate us a bit earlier at 1:10PM.  Being a bit stressed about finding the place (which is located in the Trump Hotel) and 2 friends bailing on us, we both needed a drink by the time we got there.  He ordered a Bloody Mary and I ordered a Bellini.  Both were good.  Although the Bloody Mary was so good that my bf and I ordered another 2.  The Bloody Mary wasn't salty like most other places and had a refreshing / bit bitter kick due to the fresh capers in the drink.  Fantastic!  We were off to a great start.Both of us were in a weird mood for food being that it was around 1:10PM and we hadn't eaten anything all morning... so we ordered some breakfast and some lunch.  We ended up getting the following:1) Eggs Benedict (breakfast) - good as expected  yelp.com/biz_photos/Qd7Y…2) Foie Gras Brulee (appetizer) - it had Cherry Yuzu Compote.  I would totally order this again.  The Foie Gras melted in your mouth.  I can't even begin to describe.  yelp.com/biz_photos/Qd7Y…3) Pre Fixed Lunch (Grilled Beef Tenderloin, Slowly Cooked Salmon, and Warm Chocolate Cake)  We ordered the Grill Beef Tenderloin - medium rare.  Most places would cook it medium whenever we order medium rare.  This was a delightful surprise.   It was cooked perfectly to the way we liked it.  The Salmon was cooked to perfection as well.  It wasn't fishy tasting and cooked just done so that the fish was really soft.  It's almost as if they had just killed the salmon and cooked it in the kitchen.  The fish was super fresh.  For dessert, we got the famous Jean Georges Warm Chocolate Cake w. vanilla bean ice cream.yelp.com/biz_photos/Qd7Y…yelp.com/biz_photos/Qd7Y…yelp.com/biz_photos/Qd7Y…Funny thing was that my bf and I always order 1 dessert to share.  The dessert there was so good, we actually asked our waiter for another dessert.  He recommended the Strawberry Vacherin (with Anise Meringue, Lemon Ice Cream, and Lavender Almonds).  Again fantastic.yelp.com/biz_photos/Qd7Y…Additionally, we also got 2 Fresh Fruit and Herbal Sodas (Passion Fruit-Lime and Black Cherry Yuzu).  Both of which were good because they weren't sweet.  I'm very much into the delicate natural flavors and everything we ordered was just that.  yelp.com/biz_photos/Qd7Y…Our total bill came out to about $150 (excluding the tip), which includes about $50 in alcohol (Bellini & Bloody Marys).  It definitely was worth the $ for the quality of the food and service.",8,4,9,Jocy C.,"San Diego, CA",1456,1318,5707

5.0,8/6/2009,"Nougatine provided me with, quite simply, the best dining experience I've ever had. Sound like hyperbole? Perhaps, but not really. If you're in the market for food of absolutely unmatchable quality, there is no need to spend a lot of money and eat in a stuffy dining room filled with elitists. Let me explain.I have eaten at several of the country's top restaurants, and fresh off Le Cirque two weeks ago, I decided I wanted to give Jean Georges a try. But after a bit of research, I learned about Nougatine, which was touted as the less stuffy and inexpensive version of the culinary temple that is Jean Georges. That sounded good to me. And I figured it would be pretty quiet on a summer weekday night at 9 pm, so the service would be attentive.As I walked into the bar area and dining room of Nougatine, though, I noticed that it was packed. The more casual, modern decor and lack of dress code made me feel comfortable instantly. There were people in suits and people in jeans sitting side-by-side, and no one at the restaurant seemed to care. The dining room, packed to capacity, was loud in a good way -- not overwhelmingly noisy so that you couldn't hear yourself talk, but not so quiet that you could hear conversations from neighboring tables. We were seated at a table for two near the open kitchen, which you can peer into from almost any spot in Nougatine. While some might consider a table near the kitchen less than ideal, I found it actually quite pleasant. You cannot hear anything from the kitchen, and the kitchen space itself is beautiful -- it is in fact a treat to look inside and catch a glimpse of the food being prepared so intricately. My first huge surprise was the wine list, which featured a bottle of what turned out to be excellent white wine from France for only $27. The bottles simply are not marked up like they are at a typical upscale restaurant. The waiter was kind of enough to keep the bottle on ice for us throughout the night and always returned to the table for a refill at just the right time. The first course was an amuse bouche: a bite of sashimi in a spoon, tomato gazpacho in a shot glass, and a piece of sourdough bread. The plate was beautiful, and the food on it was delicious. For appetizers, the salt and pepper calamari and caesar salad were both outstanding. The dressing on the salad had a nice bite to it, and the salad itself was very big. The calamari was lightly fried to absolute perfection -- it was not at all heavy, yet full of flavor. All of the portions here were surprisingly large, especially considering how small they tend to be at similar restaurants.For the main course, we ordered the chicken and beef tenderloin. Though it seems almost like a cop-out order, it was probably one of the best chicken dishes I've ever had. It came with a Parmesan jus, poured out on the plate table-side by the waiter, to give the dish incredible flavor. The beef tenderloin was prepared wonderfully -- the meat was extremely tender and extremely good. In addition to good portion sizes, the restaurant spaces out the time for each course perfectly, so that the next course arrives just as you're craving for it peaks. Such was the case with the warm chocolate cake and vanilla bean ice cream for dessert, which served as the absolute perfect finish to the perfect dining experience. The extremely inexpensive bill at the end made the complimentary sweets at the end of the meal taste even better.The unpretentious, brilliant service provided a truly comfortable atmosphere that felt luxurious but not obnoxious. The quality of the food was beyond superb -- at the very least, you will have a very difficult time trying to find a tastier, more satisfying meal. There was not a single flaw I could think of -- not even a minor, trivial error. Easily the best value around.",2,0,0,Drew A.,"New York, NY",0,6,0
4.0,8/2/2009,"This may have been one of those meals that I never wanted to end.  Everything was so delicious!  It was restaurant week so our table did the prix fix meal.  I ordered the warm beets and the salmon.  My girlfriend ordered the shrimp salad and the cod.  My brother ordered the salt and pepper calamari and the salmon and his girlfriend ordered the goat cheese and the cod.  The salt and pepper calamari was the best.  The batter was very light and fluffy and they whipped the sauce to keep it light as well.  I also enjoyed the shrimp salad, the shrimp was actually giant prawns that were seared on the outside and very juicy on the inside.  My beets were good but less inspiring than the other appetizers.  The salmon was cooked perfectly and the miso soup was a nice complement.  The rice cakes really made the dish though.  It tasted even better when I soaked them up with the soup.  The cod was cooked well, it had green olives and I'm not a huge fan of green olives unless it's in a martini but it was still good.  For desert, we ordered the warm chocolate cake and the strawberry salad.  Both were delicious.  I really liked how chocolate sauce drizzled out of the cake as we ate it and ice cream offered a good mixture of warm and cold.  The strawberry salad was nice and tart but the strawberry sorbet kept it sweet.",0,0,0,Brent G.,"San Francisco, CA",120,110,0
2.0,7/31/2009,"I know that Restaurant Week brings in the riff raff that normally would not frequent Jean-Georges or Nougatine, but was not prepared for the dismal and unprofessional service and the food just not being up to par.First the service : we had to repeatedly ask for water to be refilled, more coffee, a Diet Coke (never actually delivered), ice for the water, a knife - it went on and on. Once our order was taken, the waitress never once returned.On to the food : the appetizers were not bad, all parties ordering the honeydew and goat cheese salad. Nice presentation, though not that exciting.The entrees left quite a bit to be desired. There was a bitter taste that was present in all three - the snapper, salmon and the shrimp salad.Though the portions were quite minimal (to be expected), we did not even finish what we had.Dessert was the best, and after having complained to the maitre d' about the service we were compted two extra desserts from the a la carte menu.Noted that a number of yelpers had similar experiences at Nougatine.

3.0,7/19/2009,"Went here for a restaurant week lunch with my good friend, and overall we were pretty satisfied by this modern cafe. Our waiter was friendly enough, but incredibly distant and even a little cold.  I could be completely assuming here, but he gave the impression that he'd treat us more warmly if we ordered a la carte.Regardless, the food won us over.  I started out with their honeydew melon salad, decked out with clumps of goat cheese, bits of lardons, endive, and a drizzle of passion fruit dressing (the best part.) My friend was in love with her tuna tartare, which came with avocado, radishes, and a ginger marmalade that really enlivened the whole dish.Entrees were slightly less stellar but no less tasty.  My friend really enjoyed her medium rare beef tenderloin, which came with garlic, chili and parsley (and potatoes too, I think.) I'm not too enamored by steak, but it was good. The same went for my roasted chicken dish - luckily it was moist (though the second piece was riddled with fat,) and crispy.  However, my disappointment reached untold levels when I saw that the ""ricotta gnocchi"" consisted of exactly three cylindrical pasta shapes similar in character to mini marshmallows. I decided to skip the straight forward offerings for dessert and go for the a la carte selections, finally settling on ""Rose Macaron."" Unfortunately, it was more sparse than I would have hoped. A single pink macaron was topped with a vanilla parfait, and served with berries, berry coulis, and a few scatterings of candied rose petals. The flavor of rose was almost entirely absent, and I left wishing I had been like my friend and ordered the molten chocolate cake - a crusty, gooey ode to all that is wonderful in this world.

1.0,6/15/2009,"I visited NYC recently with my wife.  Nougatine was recommended by a very trusted friend of mine and fellow Yelper, Paul K.  There were 5 of us, all of whom had not seen each other in several years (except for my wife and me obviously).  We were thrilled to be together again and had lots about which to talk and laugh.  We all had the $35 prix fixe dinner -- a superb value and the quality of the food was that to be expected from a 5 star establishment.  Sadly, it is there that my praise ends.  Our waiter set a tone with us that put us ill at ease from the beginning of the meal.  I had brought a small, Sony Webbie camera that I was using to shoot some stills of the group and of the room.  Before introducing himself and while other servers were filling our waters, he very coldly said, ""You're gonna have to put that away.""  It was like one of those moments where somebody does something really awkward in one of those 80's party movies and the record player needle grinds off the vinyl.RRRR!!!!!Everyone at the table got quiet and just sort of grimaced as he proceeded to introduce himself and list the specials as though he hadn't just been a bit of a dick.  Then one of my guests who had expressed some minor annoyance at the lack of bread at the table asked, ""Well could you at least bring us some bread?""""After you order,"" he responded with the same condescending tone with which he just scolded me.""We'll need a second.""  I said, ""so you can just go ahead and bring it now.""The waiter spun around and left without a word.Then we spent the next several minutes debating on whether to just grab a manager and insist on a new waiter or if we should just trash this place on Yelp for service.  As you can see, we chose the latter.  These were friends of mine that had not seen each other in years, had so much to talk about and so many reasons to get new photos together, and yet all we could talk about the rest of the evening was how we had been treated at the beginning of the meal.  We were not happy.  The rest of the dinner was fine, but it just goes to show how one little comment by an insensitive waiter can destroy the mood of an evening -- especially in a ""5-star"" restaurant.  My friend called the next morning and told the day-manager about our experience and he was appropriately embarrassed and apologetic.  I'm sure this was an isolated event, and would still generally recommend the place, but unless I hear from my friend in NY that they invited him back to prove their competence in service -- gratis, of course -- then I'm gonna write it off as one of the many restaurants in NY that merely wishes to be perceived as having class and does not care to actually back up that perception.I'll be waiting on a phone call from my friend before I bring the stars back.",9,5,5,Nick S.,"Dallas, TX",144,85,1
4.0,6/5/2009,"So this restaurant must be getting a lot of press. My friend first recommended this place when she saw it featured in a budget travel magazine. Then I saw it later in my So-cal AAA magazine. The big draw - the prixe fix specials going on indefinitely for both lunch ($25) and dinner ($35). It's kinda hard to find though. It's actually on the first floor of the trump building near Columbus circle and central park. There's no sign, just Jean-Georges's (the chef) name in tiny, transparent lettering on some columns around the building. We had made a reservation at opentable.com the week before so there weren't any problems when we got there. Think everyone who goes there has a reservation - it's not the type of place you can just walk into. Oh and don't forget to dress up a bit. We all wore jeans with dressy tops and still felt pretty underdressed.So the service was not that great. We were waiting on one person so the waitress wouldn't really serve us until he arrived. So finally we asked for menus to peruse and drinks and just to start without him. They have one guy just going around asking if you would like bread and placing one piece on your plate if you do. No bread basket - is that how they do it at fancy restaurants? The prixe fix menu is wonderful. You get to choose two entrées and a dessert from a list of about 15 dishes. There's appetizer type dishes like calamari and salads but you could opt to get two main dishes like I did. I tried the snapper and beef tenderloin. The snapper was succulent and flaked right off which I love in a good fish. And the beef was tender and not dry at all. The portions are tiny - I was satisfied for the most part at the end but not stuffed. Guess they have to do that since it is so inexpensive. The presentation was fabulous though - almost too pretty to eat. For dessert, I had the ginger chocolate one. It was basically ginger flavored fudge. You could definitely taste the ginger so I don't recommend it if you're not a fan. I think the other choice was a citrus sponge cake, if you want to play it safe. Also they changed waiters on us in the middle of the meal and isn't it common courtesy to let us know? But nobody told us, we just had a different person all of a sudden. So that kinda confused our new waiter too since they give you different sets of silverware for each course. He gave us dessert utensils before we even got our second course. Also they're supposed to explain the dishes to you when they serve each course and they just plopped the food down to us for the first course. They did it for the second course and dessert.

One poor woman's job there was just to open/close the door. Apparently she was rude to my sister's boyfriend when he tried to walk in to meet us.

Negative stars! He also didn't really care to explain items on the menu.FoodThe menu was varied and everything sounded unique. We didn't drink anything special, and ended up eating tons of bread while we waited for our absent server. A complimentary shot of  asparagus lime puree + prosciutto on the side came out as a palate starter, and that was very tasty and unique, though salty. For our main course, my sister's boyfriend had the roasted chicken w/ ricotta gnocchi + mushrooms. The chicken was nice and crisp on outside, and juicy on inside, but the ricotta gnocchi looked and tasted like dirt. We did not care for the texture at all! My sister had the slow-cooked salmon which was cooked to soft perfection. The potato puree and shredded carrots were very tasty. I ordered the red snapper w/ radish, miso sauce, sea beans and ginger. It was way salty. The ginger was so overwhelming, and the sea beans just didn't go with the fish. The side salad my sister and I shared was very tasty w/ the lemon vinaigrette topping, pear and fresh greens, but the salad overall lacked sauce/complex flavor throughout.Overall, the food here is not worth how much you pay.

The first time, Jean-Georges came to our table to say hello and sent out a dessert sampling that was out of this world. The second time, Johnny Iuzzini came to the table to say hello and sent out plates of chocolates, pastries and marshmallows in addition to our dessert. In all honesty, I'm sure the experiences I've had have led to my raves as much as the quality of food, but I think that is important.

5.0,4/19/2009,"Nougatine was the highlight of my most recent culinary tour of NYC. And by culinary tour, I mean the only thing I did on my trip (or so it seems) was eat and drink my way through the city. The $24.07 prix-fixe lunch menu here was genius, and a nice way to experience what Jean Georges has to offer without going broke. It's too bad it wasn't a nicer day; I dined here last Saturday while it poured rain outside. But nonetheless, my table right by the window afforded splendid views of Central Park and the tulips planted in the large planters outside.I started with the salt and pepper calamari, which was really good. And for the main course, I had red snapper. I finished with the spiced cake. My friend had the tuna tartare, the beef, and the chocolate dessert, so we did a bit of sampling from each others plates. It was all wonderful, albeit the portions were small, but for a prix-fixe menu, it was somewhat to be expected. In my opinion, this was a great and affordable way to sample an otherwise pricey restaurant. The service was impeccable and attentive, but not stuffy, and the food delivered like the menu advertised and my preconceived notions expected.",2,0,2,Kyle M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",8,30,2

Service was very attentive.i had the Pinky Toe crab cake with lemongrass champagne mango for appetizer and Red snapper with Lily bulb radish salad white sesame and lavendar.  Love eating crab without having to work for it. The snapper was moist but crispy on the outside. Portions were generous (was expecting smaller given the shi-shi nature of the place) and really tasty. Sampled a friends shrimp salad which was great too.Our party of four shared two bottles of wine (a super tuscan and pinot noir) that were also nice.  Their molten cholocate cake is done superbly.   Definitely worth it for a nice evening.Will be back.,1,0,1,Calvin s.,"New York, NY",188,32,32

1.0,4/9/2009,"An absolute disappointment. My second visit to this restaurant was a drastic change from my first encounter. I called ahead to make sure my reservation at 6:30 wouldn't hinder part of my party from getting the $35 prix fixe that runs from 5:30-6:30pm. The receptionist said that it wouldn't be a problem. I arrived 5 minutes late, waited 15 minutes just to find our table was given away and was sat right next to the entrance, where my seat was partially obstructed the entrance. In addition, it took 15 minutes for the waiter to realize we were ready to order. The waiter refused to give us the prix fixe menu because it was past 6:30 and referred us to the manager. The manager approached our table without introducing himself and said, ""What's the problem?"" As I spoke of my grievances, he responded by saying, ""And is this my problem? It is already 7pm, which is past 6:30 and our prix fixe only runs until 6:30."" Obviously, it is a manager's problem when a customer is not satisfied with their service and the major part of us ordering at 7pm is due to their service.After I had to fight to get the prix fixe menu, he said that he was doing a favor for me by granting me to order the prix fixe.  Should be grateful to the manager for encountering such horrendous service as I entered the restaurant? His attitude was especially rude, non-accommodating and demeaning. I do not expect a manager of this kind of restaurant to treat their patrons in this manner.Unlike other guests, I wasn't automatically given to my table as we were seated, and throughout the dinner, I had ask for a refill for every empty glass of water while some waiters were looking off to space. But when we paid, they were overly attentive, quickly getting the checkbook as we closed it. And there was no sign of appreciation, no thank you, no nothing as the waiter ran off with the check.Even though the food was good, but a tad salty. Nothing the food could do that would compensate for the service.  I would not be returning to this restaurant.",3,1,0,julie g.,"New York, NY",4,26,1

I am from SE Asia and I definitely notice the ingredients in our cuisine being used in JG's cooking. You don't know how happy that makes me! I got a fish dish from the a la carte menu for $28.

THEN the first course came... tuna tartare with ginger sauce. I was in SHOCK (the trend was to continue throughout the course of the dinner). The portions were huge and it was DELICIOUS! (well, I'm not surprised but it wouldn't be the first time restaurants cheat on the portions for these ""special promotions"").

3.0,2/5/2009,"Nougatine is a renowned establishment in the Michelin rated Jean-Georges' restaurant empire. Jean-Georges is known for his daring combination of bold flavors and his ability to create a uniquely textured dining experience. His dishes play to all your senses; smell, taste, vision.But chalk one up to the critics of restaurant week. There are no choices in the dinner menu though it does seem to change everyday so make sure to call ahead. You're might be better off visiting for lunch as that menu has a myriad of food choices. Either way, good restaurants at this caliber shouldn't be hit or miss.Our meal started off with the chef's amuse, a shot of creamed fennel soup with a drop of basil oil paired with fresh crab meat over a crispy wanton skin. Already you have Jean-Georges signature texture. The perfectly crisp wanton skin with carrot brittle mixed into soft delicate crab meat. This all paired amazingly will with the creamy and smooth fennel soup which was bursting with the fresh flavor of fennel. Details make a dish and while the food tantalized my taste buds, the drop of basil oil in the soup wafted through my nose and I was in heaven. It was like taking in a breath of fresh forest air after the rain.Unfortunately, things feel back to earth with a crash. The butternut squash soup had too much cream. The salmon dish that came out next looked visually stunning but was absolutely tasteless. The salmon lacked its natural sweetness giving me the impression that it wasn't all that fresh. I can cook up a better salmon dish any day. The beef was dry and the sauce overbearing. I wasn't a fan of the texture either; too much going on in this dish.The dessert was a sampling of all their signature sweets. All good but each with flaws I couldn't pass up.

4.0,1/21/2009,"For two glorious weeks in the dreadful doldrums of winter (exclusive of Saturday's), NYC Restaurant Week takes Gotham by storm.  Over 250 participating restaurants charge $24.07 for a prix-fixed lunch and $35 for a prix-fixed dinner.  Considering the tumultuous economy, Restaurant Week is an affordable excuse to experience that otherwise pricey French spot you've been dying to try.Allie and I had a reservation at Jean Georges Vongerichten's Nougatine, located within the same space as Jean Georges (at the Trump International Hotel and Tower).  After being seated immediately by the gracious hostess, I couldn't help but gaze out the floor to ceiling windows and admire the snowy view.  Located on ground/patio level, Nougatine overlooks majestic Central Park.  The atmosphere in the restaurant was cozy, bright, spacious and airy.  Tabletops were graced with freshly cut white roses and delicate glass stemware.The menu revealed that, despite Restaurant Week, Nougatine has a nightly $35 prix fixed dinner.  Having learned that tidbit, I knew that I would be in for a great experience.  Allie and I proceeded to order the $35 menu, which included an amuse bouche, three savory and one sweet course.Our meal began with the chef's amuse: A shot of delicate fennel soup paired with a fried wonton skin that was topped with fresh crab meat and carrot ""brittle.""  I was pleasantly surprised by how perfect the flavors of fennel and crab came together.  The next course was tuna tartare: Atop a bed of smashed avocado was a hearty portion of fresh, ruby-red sushi-grade tuna topped with lightly marinated radish slivers.  The richness of the buttery avocado meat was a great accompaniment to the fish.  The radish slivers presented a crunchy texture to the otherwise soft dish.Following the tuna tartare was another fish course: Straddling a mound of spaghetti squash and a shallow pool of soy broth sat a large filet of skate wing.  Having never tried this fish before, I was impressed by its subtle, creamy flavor and texture.  My only complaint was that I found the smoky aftertaste of the soy broth too powerful for the delicate fish.The entrée was our final savory course: Two bone-in chicken quarters were placed atop broccoli rabe and a flavorful lemon truffle sauce.  Since the bird was cooked with skin and bones in tact, the meat was unbelievably tender.  I rarely order chicken as a main course, but this dish has convinced me otherwise.  The dessert tasting included a citrus semifreddo, homemade vanilla bean ice cream and molten chocolate cake.  I found the semifreddo too cold and the texture to be overly crunchy, plus it was not sweet enough.  The cake, on the other hand, was outrageously decadent, especially when combined with the ice cream.  Warm melted chocolate slowly oozed on to the plate with the lightest pierce of my fork.  Our check arrived with a small saucer of homemade pate de fruits (my favorite) and chocolate covered ginger.  But perhaps the sweetest part of our meal was seeing Jean Georges, one of the world's most celebrated chefs, proudly circle through the lively crowd and dining room.",2,0,1,Lindsay F.,"New York, NY",376,277,184

The service is weird to awful.  And the food is uninspired.  My first visit was odd, service was slow and the food was decent.  I figured it was an off night so I went back a few weeks later.  The second visit was a total disaster and I almost left after the appetizer... yes, everything was that bad.  The waitstaff was clueless and every dish was way too salty.  (As a sidethought, can you send a dish back for being too salty?)Anyhow, I am not going back.  A one-star rating feels a little harsh, but there are many great places in this neighborhood.  I wouldn't waste time and money here.",3,0,1,Diane A.,"Manhattan, NY",30,145,0

4.0,8/4/2008,"Went here for Restaurant Week after hearing rave reviews about 2 entrees, 2 desserts, and seeing pics from my friend's digcam. Everyone is wearing a white button down with a black vest/pants and a gold tie. Hostesses wore jackets. Saw servers bring dishes outside the restaurant..odd. You need to put your credit card down for parties of 6 or more. I was served the salmon 25minutes into the meal.

5.0,8/3/2008,"Came here for my very first restaurant week event ($35 for a fixed three courses and dessert + tax/tip) and I must say I was probably spoiled. Started with a delicious cold cucumber soup shot with a small bite of tomato/cheese and then had an interesting watermellon gazpacho. I wasn't particularly a fan of it gazpacho, but everyone else seemed to enjoy it. Next up was a melt-in-your-mouth salmon with asparagus, mushrooms, and delicious ginger sesame sauce. After all the overcooked salmon deli lunches for work, this was a pleasant reminder of how good it could be. The last entree was a slightly overcooked, but still delicious filet with garlic sauce, sugar snap peas, and parmesan cheese in tiny cubes. Desert came as a sampler - a peach tart with a light pistachio flavor and a mouthwatering melted chocolate cake a-la-mode. A couple of little jellies came with the check. Overall, the service was excellent and the pace relaxed. Wonderful experience, but... why was there only a single occupancy restroom (one male, one female) for the entire restaurant?

4.0,8/1/2008,"Diane and I went for Restaurant Week and while the 4 course prix fixe menu did not sound bad, the fact that there were no choices (unlike other menus where you can choose between a couple of appetizers and entrees, this was a set appetizer, followed by set entrees and dessert) made us decide to just explore the regular menu instead.  Prices are very decent for being Jean-George with most entrees in the mid $20-30 range and so we started with the Foie Gras Brulee.  Diane went with the skate and I went with the short ribs for our entrees.  We finished dinner with the rhubarb tart.  The foie gras brulee is very interesting.  It combines textures as well as flavors.  The crackling hard brulee top against the smooth butteriness of the foie gras is a fantastic combination.  There is also a layer of fruit jam mixed in that gives a tartness that contrasts well against the sweetness of the caramel and the creaminess of the foie gras. The sauteed skate was great and very healthy and quite possibly the perfect dish for the summer.  Flavors are very subtle.  And with a glass of the Lirac, a medium bodied grenache white, Diane was set.  The short ribs were fork tender though I found the vinaigrette actually not as interesting as it sounds.  Also, it was just slightly oversalted.  The rhubart tart was good for a really hot evening, bringing a bit of tartness to cleanse our palate at the end of the evening.The service was good though I did find the constant shuffling of waitstaff through Nougatine, into Jean Georges distracting.  The clientele on a Monday night was male heavy (read: I was the only lone female sitting by the bar for a while) and this is the type of bar area where the older bankers/exec bring their 20-something year old girlfriends to make out with.  Really disgusting!  All in all, Nougatine is very nice for a dinner right by the park.  It doesn't quite achieved the level of greatness you can find in this area of the city but for the price, it does very well.",1,0,1,Mog C.,"Hoboken, NJ",172,411,92
3.0,7/31/2008,"Considering the (tiny) price difference (for lunch, at least) with its higher-end neighbor (Jean-Georges), you should really always go for the gold and skip this place. I made the mistake of coming here thinking it would be a little bit like J-G, but it's much more bland and boring food. Presentation is so much less nice, also. It's not a bad deal at $24 for a three-course meal, but I don't feel compelled to go back - if I'm in the area, I'll do the $28 prix fixe at J-G, thank you very much (I would however probably need a reservation).",0,0,0,Alexander G.,"Manhattan, NY",9,214,0
5.0,7/30/2008,"I came here last night for restaurant week and I LOVED it. Nougatine was hard to find at first (in the Trump tower). The decor is cream-toned covered in warm lighting with the right touch of trendy. We had an 8:30pm reservation and got seated around 15-20 minutes later. The staff was very attentive and patient; the waiters explained our dishes and were knowledgeable about the food. If you choose to do the restaurant week menu, each person gets 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, and a dessert tasting dish.Amuse-bouche: A juicy cherry tomato with soft, whipped goat cheese and a shot of cucumber soup (looked like green gunk but tasted clean). Delicious! Appetizer: First presented as a large bowl with fresh cubes of vegetables and fruit - then the waiter filled it with a small pitcher of watermelon-chili gazpacho. Interesting - a little muddled because there were so many flavors mixed together. My taste buds got  a little confused by this dish. Probably my least favorite of the night, but still fun to try.Entree #1: Salmon with asparagus, oyster mushrooms, and lemon-cream sabayon. Salmon was slow-cooked and was very delicate - paired perfectly with the sabayon, which was tasty but not overpowering. My favorite of the night.Entree #2: Petit fillet - cooked medium rare. Juicy, tender and a lot more meat that you expect. Cubes of parmesan and snap peas were great compliments to steak. Dessert: A mini-warm molten chocolate cake with vanilla-bean ice cream juxtaposed with a roasted-apricot over pastry and pistachio glaze. The cake was great and I loved the uniqueness of the pistachio glaze. The apricot was too tart for my taste and I found myself puckering up while eating it. Before our check, the waiter presented us with complimentary chocolates and turkish delights! We didn't feel rushed at all - the waiters brought out food at the right times and kept an eye on us without feeling overbearing. In between the entrees, they continued to fill our plates with warm bread and butter. I left the restaurant satisfied and my taste buds happy. Restaurant week redeemed itself with Nougatine.

4.0,7/22/2008,"This is a review for a restaurant week dinner at Nougatine. (see pictures...)For its RW value: 6 starsObjectively w/o price factor....... 4 starsNot quite heaven, but close. I think there were several moments throughout dinner that I absolutely loved the food, but it wasn't every moment. I don't expect a perfect meal for restaurant week, so I definitely thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Nougatine. I think Nougatine probably gives you your best bang for your buck RW meal. Seriously -- you get an amuse bouche, appetizer, TWO entrees, a dessert duo, and a little plate of sweets at the end. It wasn't tasting menu sized either -- everything was appropriate portioned, so by the end, I was STUFFED.Standouts of the evening:- Molten chocolate cake!!!! omg, this was heaven on earth. Every bite... I'm salivating at the thought already. If I weren't surrounded by waiters bustling around the restaurant, I would have licked the plate clean. CLEAAAN. Thank god it was a small slice of heaven -- otherwise I would not be as small at the end of the night. :[- THE BREAD. I'm a carbaholic and that first bite was the best bread of my life. The crust was shattered every time I took a bite... and it was piping hot... sooooo gooood. unfortunately, my second piece disappointed but when the bread's good, it's fantastic.- Watermelon w/goat cheese: I was shocked at how such a simple appetizer (strange combination too) could taste so good! The goat cheese melted on contact and even my boyfriend, who doesn't like watermelon, really liked this appetizer. It's 7 (little) bites though, literally.Good but flawed dishes:- Salmon w/ crispy rice over miso-yuzu: the ""crispy rice"" killed it for me. Everything else about this dish I loved. I wish I had more miso-yuzu broth to sop up everything in because it tasted so good. The salmon was a little overcooked for my taste, but it was still tasty. The crispy rice though didn't mesh at all with the dish... You can call it crispy rice, but please cook it before making it crispy!- The parmesan crusted chicken was too salty, though tasty. I feel like the second entree is an ""experimental"" course the kitchen is playing with and we're the guinea pigs. It wasn't on the regular menu and next week's second course (beef fillet) isn't on the regular menu either. I really, really wanted to give Nougatine 5 stars for the many points in the meal that made me deliriously happy, but the fact that the two entrees were the two weak points makes it hard to do so. It's fantastic value and a great opportunity to taste some food prepared by top chefs.

Given the reviews, there seems to be a difference. Also, just to clarify, the ""casual restaurant"" outside JG, through which you walk to get to the main dining room, is officially a different restaurant (Nougatine), and the food there is nothing like what's served in the main room (I've eaten at Nougatine -- it's good, but it's not JG)",1,0,2,Bruce C.,"San Francisco, CA",2,295,4
5.0,5/28/2008,"I had a special reason to make reservations at Jean-Geogres, V's favorite restaurant, for Sunday brunch: I wanted to take her there to celebrate our engagement! Technically, Jean-Georges doesn't serve Sunday brunch, but the ""bar area"" outside the main dining room, Nougatine, serves food from the same kitchen, and with equally impeccable quality and service.I had proposed earlier in the day, at Central Park's Belvedere Castle and continued the surprise with our brunch reservations. Of course, we started our meal with a bottle of champagne - the most modest on the wine list - which was still very good (and much much better that whatever I bought for New Years).We started off with appetizers. Being that it was such a special occasion, I chose foie gras. This was the biggest piece of foie gras I've ever had, and it was different that I expected, being bruleed on top rather than cooked through, meaning it wasn't very soft or warm through the whole piece. Still it was super rich, certainly a bit extravagant, but a great start to the meal. I really could have shared it with several people, but V had her own great appetizer, a squash soup with cremini mushrooms. We were confused when the soup was served, originally thinking it was a very unique take on 'soup' as the bowl came with some chunks of squash and pieces of mushroom, but no liquid. A moment later, the server brought a little pot of the soup and poured it in the bowl. The dish was not overly sweet and it was great for a cool winter lunch.For our main course, V tried a black bean and avocado dish with cod. It was light and almost tangy with a bit of lime in the sauce. The fish was tender and flaky. I had a grilled pork chop that was a very unique preparation. Poured over the top was a strong rosemary honey sauce, that eaten on its own was just about overpowering, but when eaten with the chunky ""papaya mustard"" and mini brussel sprouts was a perfect combination. Definitely a well conceived meal and preparation.Nougatine definitely excels in its level of service, which helped to make this meal worth its high price. Our server was knowledgeable and friendly, and very attentive, refilling our champagne flutes and timing the food service. Really this didn't all come down to just one server either, there is probably a greater than 1:1 ratio of staff to guests at the restaurant. I counted 4 or 5 staff just in the entry area! Plus, beyond the service, the location is great, on the south west corner of Central Park at Columbus Circle. We got a great table at the window, to enjoy the view, that really enhanced this ""New York moment."" This was certainly a wonderful meal and a great place to celebrate our engagement.

5.0,4/12/2008,"Undoubtedly the best breakfast (note - not brunch) in Manhattan.When I lived in NY - and my then boyfriend now hubby came to visit me, this was his go-to place for breakfast.  I can't recall how many times I ate here, 7:30am on a weekday, put him on a cab to JFK, and walked across the park to my office.  I remember those days with much affection.We relived that moment last week, when this time it was MY turn to get on a cab to go to JFK.  With a yummy breakfast like that and impeccable service, you feel so content and the bumpy ride to JFK does not bother you.Anyway, about the food.The breakfast is a standard menu, eggs, pancakes, bagels, etc.  But each dish is prepared with JGV - compliant level of attention to detail.  The pancakes are the fluffiest in the city.  The bagels are handmade onsite and come with the best lox and cream cheese.  The orange juice is to die for.The atmosphere is serene and mature, the guests during breakfast hours are mostly guests at the Trump Hotel, so they tend to be an older crowd having quiet breakfast meetings.  The service is impeccable.And, breakfast comes down to approx. $20-$25pp including everything.  Not bad for the quality and service you get.  If you go to nearby Le Pain Quotidien on 58th, you get rude service and have to sit in a communal table, and end up paying about the same.I've also been here for dinner, not as impressed with the food as I am with their breakfast, but still very, very good.",5,0,1,Yu T.,"San Francisco, CA",55,170,30

However, upon arrival we were told by the server that they needed at least 24 hours notification for vegetarians. Ugh. So she went off to ask the kitchen if it would be possible. I also ordered a glass of wine and one of the soda's. The glass of wine came, but the soda never did. Nor did the server ever return to let us know if the kitchen could accommodate my wife. Ugh.The food arrived. Great looking amuses for us both. Delicious. Appetizers: I had the tar tar and my wife had....the same dish as her amuse, only bigger and messier looking. Ugh.The rest of the courses proceeded smoothly, with most dishes never rising to the tongue titillating teasing tortuously good levels that makes one go out and spend the amount of money on a meal like this. The foie gras was great, but underwhelming. The beef not as complex as I would have liked, but the desserts were magnificent. My wife's entrees were similarly underwhelming.

5.0,10/15/2005,"Jean Georges sister restaurant, La Nougatine, is quite possibly the home to the greatest meal I have ever had. Since Jean Georges is closed on Sundays (along with most A-list celebrity chef restaurants in Manhattan) La Nougatine was the choice for my 22nd birthday recently. I dove into the tasting menu which included a succulent blue-fin tuna tartare, califlower cheese soup, halibut, a veal dish that was beyond anything I'd ever eaten before and a dessert assortment worthy of the most serious sweet tooth critics. Plus, since it was my birthday they sent over a delicious chocolate souffle to cap off the evening. A glass of champange, a bottle of red wine, a glass of dessert wine and the evening was done. While the bill was...astronomical...the experience was to die for.",0,0,0,Tara S.,"New York, NY",5,98,0
