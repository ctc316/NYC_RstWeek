2.0,5/1/2019,"I was so looking forward to having brunch here two weekends ago. Sadly, it did not live up to my hopes. We had a reservation for the end of the brunch rush so maybe it was just timing, but every dish was underwhelming. The deviled eggs were rushed in presentation - definitely not the like the photos on here - and a bit runny. The Mac & Greens were okay, but nothing special given other options in Harlem. My friend and I each ordered Mama's Breakfast Pie but somehow only one was delivered to the table. Our waiter was extremely apologetic and offered to have another prepared but we decided we could split one. I was glad we did because we couldn't even finish one. The skillet wasn't hot so the egg didn't cook. Now I like a runny egg, but not a clear and gelatinous egg white that makes me fear getting sick. Once we scraped off the egg, the rest of the dish was difficult to eat. The brisket was a large slab at the bottom that was hard to cut and didn't have any real flavor. On top of it, the coffee was cold. Hopefully, it was just an off day, but I won't be back for brunch. The flavors weren't there and the rushed, undercooking really put a damper on our special day.",0,0,0,Karri W.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,5,1

Salad was a small portion-felt like it was a side salad. Shrimp and grits, were fair. I left hungry and went across the street to Whole Foods.

The food subpar but the true caveat is the security took our barstools after a certain time. The idea of removing my seat while drinking and after spending over $70 is absurd.

The wait was only about 15 minutes!We waited at the bar and got a few cocktails- Yes, Chef made with vodka, which was bright and flavorful and the Harlem Mule made with scotch, which was an interesting take on a mule. Both were priced at $10 for happy hour (normally $13). We were seated within the 15 minute window we were given upon arrival. The food was excellent! We were very happy with everything we ordered. We shared: Yep! Chicken & Waffle- crispy chicken skin, delicate soft slightly sweet waffle, and amazing dipping sauceCornbread- crunch outside, soft inside, delicious butterHot Honey Yardbird- Sooo amazing! It brought me back to the south with the perfect crispy skin with so much flavor packed in the tender meat of the chicken. This is in my top chicken dishes I have ever had! The garlic mash was also great.Mac & Greens- perfect blench of cheese and greens! I love mac and cheese and this did not disappoint! It was a bit oily but worth it!The service was pretty good. We did have to wait a little while to get our leftovers wrapped and grab the check. But other than that- the service was alright.

3.0,4/23/2019,"We came here Easter Sunday for dinner.  There was a jazz/blues band performing so that created a nice ambience.  We started with the corn bread (3/5) which was large enough to share and was just OK. We've been to many bbq/southern/soul food joints that served better ones. It came with strawberry butter so that helped.  We then had to get the famed honey fried chicken (4/5) which was very good. Not too sweet from the honey and not overly fried and fairly moist.  Decent size bird. We also had the shrimp and grits (3/5) which was OK - again, other joints do it better.  We had the brussel sprouts (3/5) on the side which was tasty but rich.  Service is excellent.  As a celebrity chef's restaurant I would not expect less.  However, I would expect a bit more from the food.",1,0,0,Jazz C.,"Manhattan, NY",2,150,546

1.0,4/19/2019,"Upon arriving I was greeted by one of the rudest hostesses in Manhattan. I told her I was waiting for one more she responded with an eye roll and a comment ""we'll see if we have anything whenever they get here"".   The restaurant was EMPTY. We were seated shortly after my friend arrived at none of the open tables but a shared table in the back. I asked if we could sit outside and with another eye roll from the hostess we made our way outside.  Our bright faced server was lovely but she had the entire outside patio as her section and she couldn't keep up. Our drinks were empty the entire time. The corn bread was delish! My shrimp and grits were also good till I found a raw piece of shrimp... and then a chicken bone!!! A chicken bone? In shrimp? Dessert was ok, but I'd go somewhere else.  During our meal a non english speaking couple came up to the patio and sat down (not realizing they had to go inside to be seated by the hostess) That same hostess came out and yelled at them causing quite the scene. I hear people rave about this restaurant and I don't know what all the fuss is about. You can get good soul food a lot of places in Harlem for a lot less And I  bet they have nicer hostesses. I probably would have rated this place better if it wasn't for that hostess. I get that kitchens have slip ups like that and servers are over workers. But being rude to patrons is just dumb.

2.0,4/16/2019,"Staying in Harlem on a vayK/business trip and thoroughly enjoying the history and the vibe of this historical place.  We had decided to save the best place for last: Thee Red Rooster! After a very long day of museums and near misses we were ready for  the final feast! After a short walk on a brisk night we arrived and inquired about our reservation but before I accepted the seating I was overwhelmed by the Rude Rooster decibels Of pure loudness! It was deafening, brash, and worst than a 4 o'clock crowing on a work farm! I asked to be served outside in the patio with hopes of removing myself from the LOUD environment but the answer was ""no way"" we're not serving people outside.

The mule was delicious - it's one of the few mules that can stand alone without alcohol, with bits of ginger and the addition of basil. My husband said his negroni was good as well. For an appetizer I got the burrata salad - also delicious, and I loveddddd the beets. My husband got the chicken and waffles and enjoyed it. For an entree my husband got the Obama Short Ribs and he could barely talk through his smiling. I got the Brussels sprouts and the cornbread.

4.0,4/7/2019,"Had this place on my to do for years. But after being vegetarian for the past two years I had almost lost hope I'd ever be able to try this place so I was super excited to see they had added a vegetarian entree on their spring menu. It was the cauliflower mofungo, so I quickly made a reservation for 3 weeks later (earliest available for a 7:30 dinner time). The vibe is exactly as I expected very hip and lively. The crowd is very diverse with a mix of locals and definitely tourists who you know had never stepped foot into Harlem before. The service was amazing and so were the drinks. The food however left a little to be desired but could have been because it's so hyped up. My boyfriend had the scallops to start and we split the famous cornbread. The cornbread was good but I mean I wouldn't say it was worth the hype. My bf liked the scallops but for 2 for $19 it was just ok. He had the yardbird and I had the cauliflower. I would say the ""mofungo"" was misleading as it was basically half a head of cauliflower with some ragu type stuff (they call it stew) underwear. Still very good just not what I was expecting. My bf liked the chicken but said it wasn't anything too different than what he had in the past. He did say the collard greens were the best he's ever had. In total for the two appetizers, 4 drinks and two entrees our bill was about $150. It was worth it for the experience but not sure if I'd do it again.",1,0,0,Cristina I.,"Manhattan, NY",78,25,4

2.0,4/6/2019,"Had brunch this morning with friends and I've got to say that I was really disappointed. The Bloody Mary was fair- super traditional w/o any garnish. We got the deviled eggs, corn bread and coffee cake to share. The corn bread was the best of the three. The deviled eggs were ok but the black eyed peas mayo was a really off putting color- not appetizing at all. The coffee cake was ok-- super dense and moist, almost like a rum cake, but a little under cooked. Paul Holiday would not have been impressed. I got the Miss B's Biscuits and Gravy, which was pretty awful. The eggs (there were 3, which was also a surprise) were so undercooked that there were pools of clear liquid in my dish and I was not expecting the gravy to be a thick red sauce (it doesn't indicate on menu that the gravy is actually tomato based) that covered both the biscuit pudding and fried chicken making them indistinguishable from each other.  It was nothing like I had expected/was craving. If you look at pictures on yelp, photos of the same dish show brown gravy and a piece of bone in chicken -- not the red sauce I got which was served on top of a boneless thigh. I feel like I was misled. I barely ate it. My friend liked her yardbird but the other dishes (Rooster Slam and kale omelette) were pretty unmemorable.The service and environment were pleasant, however, I found the host and/or seating policy to be annoying. We had a reservation for 4 but a friend was running late- the host told us that if we wanted to sit, we would have to order food for the 4th person, which I thought was a little ridiculous. They didn't indicate they would give up our table and if she had not made it, it's not like they would have seated us elsewhere- a table for 3 is the same as a table for 4. I had been wanting to check out Red Rooster for a long time, and now that I have, I am in no hurry to go back. There are plenty of better places in the hood.",1,0,0,Sarah G.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,124,8
4.0,4/2/2019,"Red Rooster has a new sleekness of a cool art cottage.   The horseshoe bar in the front room has a funky mosaic cracked tile bar top.  The walls are covered with random paintings evoking a folk art sensibility.   A mural of Nelson Mandela in psychedelic neon colors is on one wall. The crowd was buzzing at happy hour.  We had the $7 house wine special and shared the Mac and cheese $9, which was a huge serving, and satisfyingly drenched in butter, and baked with a crunchy topping.   It was really good.  It made us both think of our grandmothers. Smack dab in the middle of Harlem it feels a bit more touristy than local community.  Entrees are in the $25 and up range, which is a little pricey for comfort soul food but the atmosphere is nice and I'd recommend it for a nice dinner with a friend or a casual date.  The place gets loud.  Service is quick and efficient.It's right near the 1 train stop on 125th.",9,4,8,Scott L.,"New York, NY",5000,2399,4298
5.0,3/31/2019,"I love everything about this place!! Best make a reservation so you'll be seated promptly. I made one for 2:30 and got seated once I told the hostess we were there. This place is definitely popping with the music, full bar and amazing art and decor.The staff is kept super busy with lots of tables to manage so water was a bit slow but tolerable. Food:Since we were only two people we couldn't order everything on the menu even though I considered it. We got the fried chicken with mash potatoes and collard greens. DELICIOUS! The flavors were on point. Chicken was cooked with perfection. The hot honey crispy layer added the additional wow factor. The mash potatoes and gravy we great on its own OR when you ate it with the chicken. Everything on this plate just worked!Deviled eggs. Classic done right. I loved the crispy capers that added the extra crunch. Definitely worth making the trip up to Harlem. ALSO prime location right off the 2,3 train station.",2,0,1,Jessica C.,"Queens, NY",143,257,170
1.0,3/31/2019,"I had a very bad experience and would like to CALL OUT CHEF MARCUS SAMUELSSON TO DO A BETTER JOB with this restaurant. Instead of judging other chefs on Chopped etc... perhaps, Chef Samuellsson, you should take a minute and evaluate your own establishment.  Chef Samuellsson should be ashamed of himself. I just went to Red Rooster this evening (march 30th for a 6pm reservation) and spent a considerable sum of money. My fiance and I left upset and disappointed. We should have gone to another trendy establishment nearby instead.  The experience started off okay but quickly went downhill after appetizers. Here is my feedback:The mediocre:  Great decor, and music. The bar area is lovely. The walls are amazing. Love the artwork. The greeter was nice but the manager had an attitude as he sailed around with a lofty, self important air. The way the manager behaved should have been a clue of the horrible experience we would have. Cons: 1. The Salmon was okay, but be careful. There are fine bones in the salmon which could get caught in your throat and cause a lot of problems. 2.  As it was a $30 piece of fish, we alerted the server of the danger. The server was unbelievably rude. A few minutes later, a man, not the manager (the manager  acted like we did not exist) told us that because salmon is a fish and fish have bones, bones come with the salmon.  He went on to say that bones are part of the meal.  (See pictures)We were pretty perplexed by this response. Noting our emotional struggle, he at least offered to bring us something else. At this point we were disappointed in the quality of food and service but decided to give it another shot. 3. So we tried the half fried chicken with mash and it was RAW!  Again, we advised our server of the raw chicken and she walked away while we were talking. Then she came back to explain that the chicken has an artery and that the artery pops after it is cooked and that's why our meat is pink. (Really dude????) The man who acted as the manager, said the same. Also, had the chicken been cooked we would have eaten it, but let me advise, THE CHICKEN IS FLAVORLESS!  The skin is crispy but the chicken was not well seasoned. 4.  The apps were okay but not worth the price. We had crabcakes, which were bland but after we squeezed a wedge of lemon on them they were edible. We also had the cornbread. It's nothing special. It was dry and mealy. The strawberry  butter that came with it was flavorless. 5. The food is not hot. Seemed like they precooked it and placed it in a warmer. It is lukewarm and does not feel fresh. This was a blah and horrible experience. PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY.  I want my global community to have a great experience and this place does not provide that. It sucks. Chef Sammuelsson should be ashamed of himself. Don't waste your money here. But if you don't believe me, dont take my word for it. Go ahead and waste your money. Now I understand why this is a three star restaurant. Please DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!",0,0,0,Anasha K.,"Framingham, MA",7,21,12

4.0,3/31/2019,"On my recent visit to NYC I was told I should visit Red Rooster Harlem. I was so excited and had high expectations. Although the food was good I guess I expected a slightly different experience. Let me start off by saying the staff was phenomenal and even though we were walk ins, they never got nasty when we asked for an ETA on our table. With that being said we did wait a little over an hour for our table but I guess that's to be expected. As far as the food is concerned it was good, full of flavor but I just hoped for more. So for starters I ordered the Marcus cornbread. When it came out it was different for the photos I previously viewed on yelp and to be honest it tasted like a ""boxed"" or pre-made version of cornbread. Kind of like something you would get as a side dish at a chain or fast food place. The only difference was the butter that was paired with it. If definitely helped but it wasn't anything special. The rest of my meal was pretty good, full of flavor but I can't say the meal was what I expected.

1.0,3/25/2019,"DISASTERMy chicken was bleeding and no one cared. I was told about this restaurant from one of our paralegals. I excitedly to  booked for my husband and I for Sunday, 5pm. We came in from Brooklyn (we live close to JFK) I was told that they hold the table for 15 minutes then it is given away. Ok, no problem. We arrive and they offered us outside seats. My husband said we would rather wait. In about 2 minutes we were led to a table, yaaayy right? NO! Our server was prompt and we had sparkling water in immaculately clean glasses. We ordered wild, wild, wings, corn bread, yardbird, tiff's jerk chicken and the mac and greens. The corn bread came promptly followed by the wings. We couldn't decipher the music but to hell with it we were about to enjoy this meal. After a little wait, our meals arrived looking delicious. My husband let me taste the jerk chicken and I assure you there was nothing authentic about it. It was NOT jerk chicken, it was similar to bbq chicken. My yardbird was served with collard greens and something withy onions and peppers...no succotash..unless I don't know what succotash is.  THEN THE HORROR HAPPENED i cut into my chicken and blood started running, so much blood, too much blood.  I lost my appetite. I found the nearest server and told them what happened. I was told to hold on then my plate was taken away for scrutiny. It was on a counter and everyone came over and they talked and laughed while i watched from a distance then...the plate went missing. No one came to apologize. When my server returned to check on me I informed her of the issue. She apologized, I asked why a manager was never informed. Eventually the manager came over and apologized letting me know the chicken was....COOKED...OMG!!! It might have been cooked BEFORE but when it came to me it was ALIVE. He said I must have cut into a vein. Shane, you were sweet trying to fix the situation but good God almighty please do no insult my homemade cooking skills. I did not order medium rare chicken. When my plate came back to me it was obvious they took the same pieces and threw them back into the fryer... the chicken was harder than the life of a single mother with 6 kids(video won't upload). Shane asked if it was ok and offered whatever I wanted on the menu, he truly tried to patch things up but I was sick to my stomach and had everything bagged up. We got the check minus the Yard bird meal. As we were about to leave the greeter tried to sell us or ask us to donate to the CD's they were selling apparently for the ""BAND"". No thanks. I was deflated, hungry and wasted about $75 on everything else.  BEFORE I WAS ABLE TO SUBMIT THIS REVIEW....I just want to confirm that my husband and I might be suffering from food poisoning.

Definitely recommend the pork chop and crab cakes, and I would've probably eaten another two orders of cornbread if I could.  Lively atmosphere and fun, but pretty loud if you're trying to catch up with an old friend.",0,0,0,Carmen C.,"New York, NY",2,59,8

1.0,3/22/2019,"This was the worst restaurant I've ever been to in my life. NOT JOKING. First the service was abysmal. It took us 1 hour to get our entree's and 30 mins for dessert. All the while nobody came up to use to tell us what was going on until like 40 mins into the service. The 'optional' coffee they asked me if I was getting was in a very small cup and I only found out it cost 5$ after I got the check. And the food was mediocre at best. The shrimp and grits tasted very bland and the chicken wasn't special either. The only good thing they had was a chocolate dessert and that was about it. And in the end It cost 70$ for that. 35$ each just for lunch(Before tip).And it wasn't like we were the only ones with a problem. The couple next to us got their appetizers and entree's at the same time 50mins into the service. All in all I would never EVER recommend this restaurant to anybody, and shame on the restaurant for charging 5$ on coffee that's made to look as if it's 'free'!",0,0,0,Yu Tzu C.,"Museum District, Richmond, VA",11,1,0

It was a small family gathering of people who wanted to sit and catch up as we had not been together in many years. Probably our fault for not knowing what to expect from 9:30 dinner on a Monday. As for the food, everyone seemed to enjoy it. I loved my crab cakes and collard greens. The collard greens were amongst the best I've ever had and the sauce on the crab cakes make them particularly yummy. My meal seemed overpriced for its size but the quality was good.

3.0,3/12/2019,"The food was excellent, but what really kills the rating are the inane prices for the portions served. Also, they're ALWAYS busy, so service is on the slower side. A friend and I ordered a yardy and mac + cheese to split between us since that seemed to be the general consensus of the reviews. The yardy was amazing. The fry on the chicken is perfect, and the meat itself is juicy and tender. However, you can't taste the legendary hot honey that sounds appealing, but is nowhere to be seen. Underneath the chickens are mashed potatoes and some greens. The gravy and mashed potatoes were incredible. Highly recommend dipping your chicken into it. The dish is surprisingly small though, I shared with a friend, and we were both still kind of hungry, despite finishing the dish. The mac & cheese was pretty good! So cheesy, you can barely taste the veggies. But if you don't eat it while it's melty and fresh, the dish will eventually taste like nothing but salt. We also ordered the funky nassau for dessert. I can't even really describe what this was because there was such an assortment of flavors, I just know that pina colada and avocado ice cream both made an appearance. Additionally, the music switched from a DJ to live, but either way, it's just way too loud to hear other people talk, especially if you're a little hard of hearing. If you want to be a bar/club, fine, but maybe at least put some degrees of separation between that and the restaurant? Overall, it wasn't a /bad/ experience, but I can't justify going here again. For my friend and me, it came out to nearly $80ish, and with no leftovers! There are literally dozens of other places in NYC to get fried chicken that meets the standards of this place, but at WAY better prices. Don't trust the BuzzFeed video, they just fired a bunch of their staff anyway.",0,0,0,Gerrie L.,"New York, NY",540,86,53
4.0,3/11/2019,"I'd give this place a solid 3 stars but I'm giving 4 because while I made a reservation for 5, I was sneaky and invited 7 without changing my reservation and no one batted an eye. I promise you: no more deception took place during our time here.First of all, I loved the decor. Old photos, books and bookshelves line the walls. I even saw published works from food writers and author friends of mine. It was like coming into someone's home. I did NOT love being squished into a corner and having to share space with a dj and his booth, but I guess that's how they do in Harlem.While everything was well-prepared and flavorful, it was all VERY SWEET. I feel sorry for anyone who thinks this is how all Southern food is prepared because everything from the macaroni and cheese to the broccoli was tinged with a cloying sweetness. I ordered the signature 1/2 chicken (Yardbird)which came with mashed potatoes, a spiced gravy and collard greens. I got a side of macaroni and cheese because I'd seen it on TV. In fact, I saw Marcus Samuelsson prepare the chicken on tv and I knew I had to have this dish. The chicken was super fantastic; crispy skin, wonderful glaze clinging to it and fresh. Dipping pieces of it in that gravy was paramount to the whole experience. Some friends got the whole Yardbird with biscuits, red velvet waffles and a whole host of other items that they shared with everyone. We also got cornbread and that cornbread could beat ANYBODY'S grandmama's cornbread any day of the week. Hands down. A friend got a lamb dish and while I did not regret my chicken choice, I was jealous of my friend after having a bite of one of the chops. Portion-wise, the lamb was skimpy and when I looked at the price, it was pretty steep. Now, the green beans and the broccoli were served straight up raw. Not ""lightly sautéed"" or ""blanched""... they were straight up RAW. AND inedible. Zero stars, I do not recommend.We did, however, have excellent service and I could not have been more pleased with that part of our meal.

2.0,3/11/2019,"Found this place to be way over-hyped. We made a reservation on Open Table for saturday morning. Unfortunately, due to plans changing we had to switch to Sunday. I called and the automated message system, which said reservations are allowed except Sunday, but for ""Gospel brunch"" they are accepted for 10 am and another time. We wanted to do 10 am anyway, so I called to make the reservation. I was then told they didn't do reservations, but I pointed out what the automated system said. The person on the phone said ""oh for gospel brunch"" and proceeded to change my reservation from Saturday to Sunday for me. When we got there, we were seated upstairs, which was not gospel brunch. When we asked about it, they said they are no reservations on Sundays, but I pointed out we were able to make one over the phone for gospel brunch so that didn't make sense. It wasn't even a glitch because we had spoken to a person. They told us that was wrong, which was disappointing. They need to be more clear when reservations are allowed and when they're not and what they are for when you can make them, since clearly there is misinformation about what applies to when. We 100% had a reservation on a Sunday, so shouldn't it have been for gospel brunch?The service continued to prove to be sub par. It took a long time to place our orders, the food took a while (we all finished our coffees before the food order was even placed) and were served an entire incorrect meal. They put 4 different plates down on our table, none of which we ordered. This at least gave us hope that our food was almost out, but after they removed the mistaken order it took another 18 minutes for our food to come out. The empty coffee glasses weren't cleared when we were served our food and continued on the table throughout the meal. A dirty dish was placed in the middle and not only did no one stop by to ask how everything was, the dish remained there even when one more plate was brought over. They just flat out were not attentive in any way.The food itself wasn't that great - some dishes we liked (the mac and greens, biscuits and gravy) but others were no good. The chicken and waffles was too spicy for my sister to eat so she wasn't able to finish her meal (it did not indicate spicy on the menu) and the baked eggs I got were so tasteless that I didn't enjoy it at all.

The Yes, Chef cocktail (vodka, fresh mint, ginger, honey, pineapple, lemon, berbere) was one of the best tasting drinks I've had in a while! The pineapple really shown through and the Berbere had the perfect barely discernible spicy kick. There were beautiful colorful furnishing all around the restaurant and motivational quotes on wooden tiles on the wall. I would put this place overall at 4.5 stars. Only because I feel the service could be a little sharper. We had to ask for the check twice after a long lull.

We were able to come in and wait maybe only like 10-15 minutes compared to others. We were seated at a high top bar type table that's right in front of the kitchen, so if you're not okay with a lot of activity near your table, don't sit here. I ordered the kale and cheese omelette with fries and my friends both got the yardbird. The omelette was good. I don't think it was anything super special, but it was tasty. My friends felt okay about their yardbird, one said that hers was slightly undercooked in the middle, but still was okay. The Mac and greens were good as well, I would order them again.Our waitress wasn't attentive at all. She stopped by and when we asked for a few minutes to keep looking, it's almost as if she disappeared. We know that it was a busy brunch time, but it was disappointing to say the least. Another waitress saw us in somewhat distress and jumped in taking our orders, answering questions, making sure we were okay, and the gentlemen that refilled our water was always timely. Those two really were the ones who served us in my honest opinion. Our waitress brought our food out and that was it.

The decor was lovely and imaginative, and we came on Fat Tuesday, and there was a live band. I came with 3 other co-workers and we ordered enough food to have us in a coma.

I love the mix of savory and sweet Helga's Meatballs - wasn't a huge fan of the pork-beef combination mixture but the sauce was great Marcus Cornbread - the lingonberry butter was great but the cornbread itself left much to be desiredEvery Day I'm Brusselin - includes brussels and okra. A bit oily in my opinion but tastyMac and Greens - this was a miss for me. The Mac and cheese seemed a bit oily and heavy on the cheese, but not saucy, just congealed. Also there was just about no Greens in the Mac so idk what was up with that My entree: Hot Honey Yardbird - absolutely amazing. My coworkers chicken was definitely much bigger than mine but I was still served a lot of food and struggled to finish it all.

But then when I noticed her make eye contact with me and skip me over to accommodate someone behind me (twice), I realized she was just playing favorites and ignoring me.  I then asked my date to order because it looked like she was more receptive to male clientele  as I had witnessed her skip past me to take the orders of a few guys behind me.  Fine, I decided to just put in my orders with my date then to avoid the trouble.  My date ordered a glass of wine, seltzer with no ice & Titos with a splash of lemon juice.   I got the wine and he waited a ridiculously long time for a Titos with about 5 or 6 huge lemon wedges & tap water with a whole lot of ice.  Not what he ordered.   As he tried to explain to her, she turns her back on him mid-sentence, grabs our glasses and dumps them in the sink.  Without an apology or even a smile, makes us wait almost 20 min this time and she was clearly furious.  At this point, we want to leave.  We could've racked up a nice tab if we had felt comfortable enough to stay and enjoy the music but this bartender was so rude and not to mention, would stop in the middle of payment transactions and counting money so that she could sing along and scream to the lyrics, shakin & gyrating to the music while we're waiting 20 min for a glass of water (which requires no ingredients or mixing) as if she was a patron there to enjoy herself too.  She also was smacking her mouth so hard & fast with chewing gum maybe, seemed like she could've been under the influence herself which would explain her erratic & hostile behavior.  Then she made us wait an exceptionally long time for his credit card after she'd taken our empty glasses without checking to see if we wanted another round or ready to close our tab...  just let us sit there as the minutes dragged.  Someone from management should really have a conversation with her about what her interpretation of customer service is.   Was really such a poor experience and doesn't represent Rooster well at all",0,0,0,Emily S.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,16,3

There were few highlights, like the drinks and the deviled eggs...everything else I had was nothing to write home about. We ended up getting the Fried Bird Royale...the chicken was EXTREMELY salty, even after taking the skin off!....the chicken meat was still salty. The biscuit was pretty dry, the baked beans were also salty....really the whole meal was just a major disappointment.  It could be that they had an off night, but I hardly doubt it just because almost everything seemed off.",0,0,0,Alex D.,"North Miami Beach, FL",4,21,89

5.0,3/3/2019,"There is not a single thing that I would change about any dish I tried here. We started with the chicken and waffle appetizer; be warned, this is seriously spicy! I love spice, so that was perfect for me, but it might be too much for people who don't eat spicy food that often. It's only one chicken thigh on one waffle, but it was large enough to share between two. As for entrees, the hot honey yardbird was amazing. The breading is perfectly seasoned and the skin is crispy. The gravy and garlic mashed potatoes were also super flavorful. The jukebox fish fry was delicious as well, although I thought the hot honey yardbird had stronger flavors. I got hot sauce on the side for the fish fry at the waitress's recommendation, and that was definitely the way to go. I wish I knew how they made the hot sauce; it was thick, creamy, smoky, and definitely went well with the food! Both dishes were piping hot and clearly had come straight out of the fryer. We came on a Saturday night with a reservation and the place was packed, so definitely keep in mind that it might be hard to get a table without a reservation, especially on a weekend night.",0,0,1,Carly L.,"New York, NY",195,293,260
5.0,3/3/2019,"The Red Rooster is more than a restaurant, it's an experience. Taking in the ambience is a challenge to describe in the best way possible. The innumerable local and historic influences weave into a beautiful tapestry of culture which is beyond pleasant and positive in energy.From a culinary standpoint (and as a native to the south) the take on southern classics is executed flawlessly. Each dish excites and pleases all areas of the palate.Top chefs may be able to handle the cuisine, however the openness, love, and hospitality sets the Red Rooster apart. A huge aspect of that is the legendary welcome and energy that Roxxy brings to every patron's visit.

Roxxy was really gracious educating us about the local art and the ways in which the restaurant paid hommage to the Harlem jazz clubs of the past. We will definitely be back soon to hear live music!

4.0,2/28/2019,"Came in here for a quick bite to eat for lunch before I had to catch a train. I know about the hype for this place and figured I finally needed to give it a try. First off, it's much bigger than I thought. Didn't realize there were so many areas, (i just sat at the bar this visit) but the bartender was saying they always have a DJ, or downstairs is live music, and Sundays is gospel. That's pretty fun. Secondly, the decor here is lovely. It's a bright, airy restaurant filled with plenty to look at. It gives it a very homey, comforting feeling, with bold colors and fun decor. Loved the MLK coat closet, and the bar was beautifully decorated as well. I ordered a drink, the Chefs call...which was a jalapeño infused vodka mixture with some run and coconut milk...it was delicious. Just enough of a kick, mixed with a little sweetness...well balanced and delicious. I ordered the cornbread, figuring I had to try...it was good, but I wasn't wowed. The butter was delicious that came with it, I would've liked to take that home :) I also ordered the scallop and crab ceviche, and this was delicious. The sauce it came in was spicy and flavorful, and the crispy chips it came with were the perfect compliment. I could've done about ten more orders of this! The bartender was very kind, and everyone that I noticed working were also on point kind.

They text you when your table is ready so you're able to walk around if you want!There were 3 of us and we decided to split the biscuits and gravy, chicken and waffles, grits, and brussels sprouts. Each of us had a different favorite dish, so I think it speaks to how good all of the food is! The brussels were more creamy, and the biscuits and gravy definitely had a little bit of a kick. The biscuits and gravy was a little bit chicken light, but since we had it in other dishes I was not upset. Overall I really enjoyed the flavors of each of the dishes and I think we had the perfect amount for a group of our size. Our server was really helpful and answered all of our questions, and gave us feedback on our initial order (too small) and made recommendations (order other things) that we took.

We were INCREDIBLY upset because we have been wanting to go to this restaurant for years since it's so ""famous"". We were so disappointed! Maybe we had too high of standards?? Ugh. I really wanted to love this place. As of now, Amy Ruth's is definitely top #1 southern food restaurant in Harlem and tbh all of NYC! Honestly, there's no excuse for the food being cold. The kitchen should have known better than to serve cold food. Especially with the price of the food. We told the waitress and her excuse was that they had a rush of people coming in.

We got the for 2, road bird royale dish. It has a whole fried chicken,  2 small waffles, 2 biscuits with honey on them, pork and beans, macaroni and cheese with collard greens mixed into them and pickles (pickled radishes, regular pickles, etc.). The food looks great and tastes good enough.  It looks better than it tastes. It's good but not great. Nothing special. Also and this is the reason for the 2 stars, the chicken was under cooked. I was eating a piece of the breast and when I got close to the bone, it was pink and bloody. I had the waiter come and he took it back to the kitchen where they bumped up the temperature according to the waiter. The problem is that I'm 5 months pregnant and eating under cooked chicken is very dangerous for me and of course it is dangerous for anyone. I should have called the manager and had a fit but I have to avoid stress. It was also a celebration dinner and I didn't want to ruin it. I know, it was silly. The  for 2 food package costed $76 and for that price, it should have been at very least thoroughly cooked. The service was good and everyone was very nice. One weird thing was that they bought the food with the whole chicken out and said that he bought it out so that we can take a picture and then he will take it back and cut it up. So the pictures show both the before and after of the chicken cutting. Listen, it's a nice place but the food is just ok so I don't plan to return.

My girls and I were looking forward to our brunch- good food, good company, good vibe. Red Rooster did not disappoint.We started with the cornbread and lingonberry butter. Perfect blend of moist and sweet! I had the Shrimp and Grits, (without Chirizo). Flavorful with every bite! Slightly spicy, creamy cheesy grits and pops of okra, onions and tomatoes made this a hit. We shared the macaroni and greens. Creamy with just a hint of collard greens. I washed it down with Rooster Punch, (a really good Sangria punch). It went from a glass to sharing a pitcher! I decided to top it off with desert. The Banana stuffed donut in creme was a pleasant surprise. Once I put my fork in it, I was a little bummed that it wasn't warm.

It wasn't OMG delicious, but it was exactly what we were expecting. Where the restaurant fell down was service. We waited over an hour and 15 minutes to get our food. Every single table around us had already eaten and several were already turned for the next seating. Our server was polite and very sweet, but we had to ask for coffee refills twice. And when they finally realized that they had spaced our order, they offered to bring us a bowl of salad as an apology for waiting. SALAD! Our entrees came with salad... we didn't need MORE SALAD. It was an epic fail. And we barely got an apology from our server and the worst part was we were not offered any explanation or comp'd items. Just the offer of a free dessert or comp'd drink would have gone a long way.

Anytime you make a reservation and get greeted with such a lovely smile from the moment you walk in, its a plus! I mean the hostess was just so friendly from the moment we arrived and from the moment we left, she showed us such good hospitality. I treated my daughter for lunch because shes doing her best in her last year of high school. So I thought to treat her with what she loves best, ""FOOD and her MOM""!  When we arrived the hostess looked up our reservation, and told us that we could wait a couple of seconds while they got our table ready. So we took the opportunity to look around and take pics of the place. Its a nice restaurant with so much color and artwork to admire, and pictures everywhere, all over the bathroom wall, just really nice. They even have a supper club located downstairs from the restaurant. Its closed off of course, its only for late nite thangs, lol. What I appreciated most about Red Rooster was that out of all the restaurants for restaurant week, this one was the only one who served a three course meal for lunch and dinner. Also all of the staff that we encounter was pleasant with smiles on their faces, you know the kind like how the McDonald's workers suppose to have but dont. They seem to really loved what they do.  Now as for the food, 5 stars for everything! You see the pics. It was all delicious. The highlight of it all was that we got to see the man himself, Mr. Marcus Samuelsson. He was so cool and down to earth. He walk around and spoke to some of the guest. He came over and offer some advice to my daugther about her future, and that lovely hostess of his even took a picture of all of us together. This was the best lunch of my life!

3.0,2/3/2019,"I was really looking forward to this date night dinner. Red Rooster had long been on my list. Tuesday 8pm dinner: while tasty, the pork ribs portion was a little on the small side for the price. Date said just OK, and he knows BBQ. The beef short rib was large, tasty but over sauced. Roasted veggies were way overdone, something you might see very late in evening. On the plus side: the cornbread was outstanding. Obamatini was very good.

I suspect they were behind in their yardbird prep as it was served very hot.

3.0,1/29/2019,"We called ahead to determine the wait, as we were coming from fairly out of the way. However, they refused to give any type of estimate which is weird. We tried to do a walk in at 12:30 on a Saturday, but the wait was an hour to an hour and a half. We sat at the bar for about an hour and a half when I finally approached the host to see what the wait would be since I hadn't received an update. Even in person and after waiting an hour and a half, the host was unable to give any type of estimate. I asked ""over 15 mins, under? Any type of info?"", but they couldn't provide that either. We ended up eating at the bar while waiting since it had taken so long. I never actually received a text that our table was ready, so who knows what was going on. I'd suggest making sure you have a reservation or go at weird times. Food:-Breakfast pie: 5/5 I was hesitant to order this because I wanted to get chicken, considering the restaurant. However, it was amazing!-Yardbird 4/5: So tasty but could have had more creativity and crunch on the skin-shrimp and grits 1/5: came COLD and friend couldn't eat it-donut pastry 2/5: good but nothing exciting. Could have gotten it anywhere in the city. All in all, I'd return with a reservation as it may have better service for the table rather than bar.

4.0,1/27/2019,"There was a time when I would have given the Rooster 2 or 3 stars but they have really stepped it up in the kitchen. The last two times be gone, the food has been really good.  Seems like they might've gotten the feedback and changed it up.  Last time I traveled to NYC, I went twice (which tells you something).  The chicken and waffle small plate was to die for.  Great chicken and light flavorful waffles.   I also tried this salmon dish that was super flavorful.  The person that I was with had the steak which was cooked to perfection and served with a maitre d butter.  Honey cornbread has also consistently been their signature.  Now for the just ok dishes: jerk chicken was marginal at best and needed more jerk to ever be classified as something from an island, the yardbird dish is also just ok.  You would think that because I liked the chicken and waffles that I'd be a fan of the yardbird.    It's definitely not bad and maybe pretty good but I wouldn't go back for it.  Overall, I will continue to go back because I can find enough dishes that I like and the vibes and live music are good.",1,0,1,Anitra M.,"Cincinnati, OH",3,30,14

5.0,1/26/2019,"My friends and I stumbled upon Red Rooster after having a horrendous experience at Sylvia's next door. Once we entered Red Rooster we were promptly greeted with smiles and seated right away. The establishment is aesthetically pleasing with beautiful artwork, freshly grown herbs in a cute little green house, the vintage full body mirror near the entrance is a nice touch. You can just tell that there was some thought put into making the place feel welcoming. Our server Latia was amazing. She gave a quick history lesson about the restaurant and the founder, told us about the live music that was happening later that evening (we couldn't make it), she was attentive and patient made the experience even better. Several servers would stop by to refill our water, clear the table, bring out silverware. We never felt neglected or overlooked. Even the manager stopped by to ask how was the meal! A+ in the service department.Now onto the food. We ordered Marcus' Cornbread it with a side of some kind of berry butter (I can't remember what it was called) the cornbread was yummy, you got a small portion for $7 however, who wants to fill up on bread right? The Crispy Bird sandwich was huge! I wasn't expecting to have two pieces of chicken. It was fried to perfection, the perfect crisp and seasonings, the pickles were perfect no complaints with this sandwich! I just wish I could have eaten it all for $21, you certainly get your money's worth on this meal. My friends ordered the Hot Honey Yard Bird, apparently it was really good. They both cleaned their plates. One did mention that the pickle added to the chicken didn't go well with the flavors of the greens and mash potatoes. We also had an order of the Chopped Harlem Meatballs, which were tasty, the cheese, sauce and potatoes came together well. Not pictured is the the Harvest Squash Soup which was yummy as well. Now let's talk about the dessert, it misses the mark. The peanut butter bar had potential to be great however, I think it was frozen or just too hard. We also ordered drinks the sangria and Harlem mule, both were good and potent! Overall would we return? Absolutely!",0,0,1,Pam Y.,"Chicago, IL",0,4,10

We got seated almost immediately even though we didn't have a reservation, at lunchtime on a Friday!We wanted to eat family style, so started with the deviled eggs; I would definitely recommend those! They're light and flavorful and we ate it up quickly!For entrees, we shared Hot Honey Yardbird, Brussel Sprouts, and Tiff's Jerk Chicken. We also received the shrimp and grits on accident, but they let us keep it anyway!I'm honestly not a huge fan of shrimp and grits, so won't review. I LOVED the Hot Honey Yardbird. The skin of the bird had crispy texture that was both sweet and savory, and the meat itself was cooked well. What pulled it all together was the mashed potatoes it lay on top of. Though the dish itself would seem heavy, it didn't feel like too much at all. The jerk chicken was also pretty good! There's a good kick to it and the tortilla at the bottom is also enjoyable. After awhile, it got to be a little salty. The Brussel Sprouts were crispy and roasted with a cheese throughout it. One of my friends thought it was too cheesy, but the other two of us liked them.So, overall:Hot Honey Yardbird: 5/5Brussel Sprouts: 4/5Deviled Eggs: 4/5Tiff's Jerk Chicken: 3/5Between eating the deviled eggs and our chicken dishes, our waiter came by and replaced our plates and silverware to clean plates, forks, and knives, but not before wiping down the table in front of us.

2.0,1/24/2019,"Finally made it back to Red Rooster (went when it opened  and found it just okay so wasn't rushing for a repeat)....and I won't be back. We were a party of two and got seated quickly.  After being seated I went to the bathroom and my dining partner ordered (we already knew what we wanted--the fried bird royale). Within 5 minutes (no lie) of me returning from the bathroom, the food was on the table (red flag number 1). I hadn't even received my drink order (am Obamatini--was delish) but we had a full meal sitting in front of us.  Before the food arrived (meaning at the same time I ordered my drink) I mentioned to the waiter that I wanted the sauce for the chicken on the side...well that message wasn't communicated to the kitchen quickly enough (no surprise since the entire meal was at the table in a few minutes) because the chicken came with sauce on it. It was eventually replaced after some hand wringing by the staff. In addition to the chicken not being served the way I asked, the rest of the food was COLD. The second platter of food comes out (again in a very short time frame) and the chicken was served correctly and was cut into pieces (the first time we received a whole chicken).  This chicken was good (not great). The mac and greens (not sure why it's called this because there were very little greens to be found) was still cold but the beans were warm (a little too sweet for my taste but at least they were served at the correct temp and I can def. see how they would be appealing to others who don't mind the sweetness). The biscuits and sweet potato waffle bits were also cold (and the waffle pieces were greasy and limp). For $75+ for the set I don't think it's too much to ask for a hot meal. While I understand biscuits might need to be made in advance there's no reason a fresh waffle can't be put on the iron when a meal is ordered, and for the life of my I can't understand why the pieces were greasy and limp?!?!?!?   Also while waiting for our second meal to come the table, the busers start clearing off the entire table (wiping it down with a dirty cloth) and prepping it for a new party (did no one notice we had just sat down).  It's a business, tables need to be turned but this was ridiculous. So in short, we felt rushed, the food was mediocre at best, the drinks were good (the other person in my party had an IPA beer which was enjoyed), the server was okay, the host was very welcoming but a little over the top talking up/promoting the Superbowl party--telling us when we arrived and left about it, and the atmosphere was so loud it was hard to have a decent conversation without yelling. Marcus needs to get back to basics and train his kitchen staff....at the end of the day we spent about $120 for a VERY mediocre meal/experience.

4.0,1/18/2019,"Hands down, one of the best meals we had on our trip. We came on a Monday right around noon and were seated right away. There are two real reasons we came: to try Marcus Samuelsson's food and because the Tasty ""Worth It"" guys made this one of their stops for fried chicken. Here's what we ate:Cornbread - served with lingonberry jam, you'll definitely want the jam. The cornbread is fine by itself, but the jam gives it another layer of flavor.Hot Honey Yardbird - Nicely crisp on the outside, this chicken was so juicy but I think I liked the potatoes and collards that were served with it more so than the chicken. I mean, don't get me wrong, the chicken is good, but there are so many other spice notes going on at the same time with the sides.Mac and Greens - This felt more like a pasta rather than your usual small-noodle mac and cheese, but it was very creamy and absolutely comfort food. I wish the top were a little more crispy since there's a layer of cheese, but it was still tasty.We were seated quickly, but the service was fair. They frequently filled our glasses with water, but our waitress was hardly seen.

I think the value is ok, I wouldn't say it's necessarily overpriced, it's probably priced about right.I got the Madama Petal drink (ordered less sweet) and it was super yummy, but you can't taste the elderflower or rose cardamom.. maybe that's because I ordered less sweet? It tasted like yuzu only, but I'm obsessed with yuzu, so it worked for me. We got the fried chicken and waffle appetizer which was yummy, but not mind blowing. But we had to try some friend chicken since they are known for that. Then I got the pumpkin soup which was currently being subbed with carrots instead of pumpkins. It was good, and I believe it was vegan, for those of you looking for that route. Then I got the burrata and rainbow radish beet and it was just ok. My coworker for the burger and he did say it was really really good. The fries were EXCELLENT. The server was so sweet too, she noticed that my coworker wasn't eating his burger bun and she wanted to make sure he was happy, to which he explained he was just trying to eat a littler healthier and she stated that they can actually do the lettuce wrapped burger if you want, so you can note that!

The decor is super cool and the staff was very friendly, however the service left something to be desired. We waited more than 30 minutes between our main meal and desserts, even after asking our waitress to check on desserts. We decided to do one of the brunch prix fix deals they offered, which included an appetizer, entree, and dessert for $29. We started with some harvest pumpkin soup (that was way too sweet) and the remix salad (the dressing was a total miss and there were too many sweet toppings like grapes and cranberries). My main dish was the shrimp & grits, which was by far the best dish at our table. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the grits were super flavorful. My sister's fried chicken was also tasty, but the collards were slimy and the garlic mash was clumpy. My mom's pasta was heavy and I was surprised it was even on the brunch menu.

3.0,1/7/2019,"So 1st let me start off by saying it literally took about 10-15 minutes for me to even PLACE AN ORDER!!  About 3 ""waiters"" walked pass me ..only to tell me they weren't ""waiters"". Then once the actual waiter came, it took like 20 minutes to take my order and then another 20 to bring the appetizer. What makes matters worse ? There was a couple that sat down next to me- and got there orders placed right away. Maybe I shouldn'tve been by myself ? I came here to meet up with co-workers for an impromptu Christmas party. Once I got downstairs to the club area, the vibe was very chill and laid back. There was good music playing and the place was dimly lit. At first, it seemed like I wasn't getting to far with the bartender downstairs BUT they both turned it around and was very courteous and attentive. Even when there was a super rude, somewhat drunk female that tried to jump in front of me to order her drink- the bartender politely told her I was there first. Overall, my co-workers and I ended up having an amazing time! Although my co- workers also complained about the service upstairs, we managed to end the night on a good note. Note to staff- you really have to work on the waiters upstairs. There shouldn't be 12 waiters walking around and only 5 of them takes orders. This is unacceptable.",2,1,2,Uneka H.,"Rahway, NJ",83,286,1129
4.0,1/5/2019,"This is a must do experience for brunch. The first time I came was for the gospel brunch which was a very unique and fun experience. This time was for Saturday brunch. The service was amazing, along with the food. I highly recommend the yardbird but it is big, so it is perfect to share with a smaller main or one of the sides. The Mac and cheese was my groups side. You definitely leave here feeling stuffed. I would give the restaurant 5 stars for quality of food and service, but very confused that when I made a reservation for Saturday brunch I was told there would be a live band. I was even told to move up my reservation to 1 pm so my group could hear more of the music. Definitely a bummer that live music is only on Sunday's when they don't take reservations.",0,0,0,Megan R.,"Manhattan, NY",257,4,3
3.0,1/3/2019,"I was super excited to  visit this upscale eatery in Harlem because of Marcus Samuelsson's reputation. The Good:The ambience is superb. The staff were very attentive and welcoming. When I  walked into the restaurant, I was immediately struck by its trendiness and decore. The pictures and artwork caught my eye and transported me to another world. The music at the bar was really good. The Not So Good: My husband and I ordered the fried cat fish, greens,corn bread, shrimp and grits, and crab cakes. With great anticipation I bit into the crab cakes but was soon disappointed because it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. It wasn't breaded well and was missing the moisture and consistency I was hoping for. The cornbread was good but it wasn't spectacular. The fried catfish however, was flavorful and fried to perfection. The greens were also flavorful as well. The shrimp and grits were just okay.All in all, the quality of the food did not justify the expense, but the general feel was nice.

4.0,1/2/2019,"I've been wanting to come to Red Rooster for a decade now. It was literally my first Yelp bookmark. And I was lucky enough that it finally happened, as my first meal of 2019! First things first, I was blown away by the service. Everyone from the hostess to the waitresses are absolute queens. Second, the ambiance is the standout feature here. The decorations took my breath away. They are so colorful, interesting, and cultural that they might bring you to tears, actually. Third, the food is very carefully crafted, plated, and infused with taste. I had the beet salad appetizer and the salmon entree. The salad was different, with its weird lettuce and beets. I enjoyed trying it, but it didn't take my breath away. The salmon did though! It melted in my mouth and was such a win! It comes with a bed of kimchi rice, which had the perfect amount of spicy aftertaste. I also tried the shrimp and grits, and it was delicious, but had a tad too much salt for me. The portion is tiny, so if you're starving, skip it. Fourth, the shrimp and grits comes with a complimentary pumpkin spice cake and ice cream! It was so cinnamony and just sweet enough! Fifth, the coffee comes in a small teacup and they refilled it once. They also have almond milk if you need. Last, they had a kink where none of their bathrooms or sinks were working while I was there. That was annoying and I hope they fix it soon. It's a solid 4-star restaurant that is absolutely worth the trek!",5,0,3,Darya S.,"Manhattan, NY",978,2060,1393

That was one thing I did not like about the restaurant because of the little space. Hopefully in the future they will open up a much bigger restaurant. I do have to say the bathroom was very cool with all the little pictures hanging up around it so that was one aspect I like. Also, if you go there for brunch or lunch they only give you a menu for that time so you will have to choose from only that menu.

Maybe it's just me, but this should be taken off the menu immediately. I understand that restaurants often take risks, but this should have been common sense.

Upon entering the restaurant we was greeted by the staff and they quickly seated us. There wasn't any seating in the bar area, so we couldn't take advantage of their happy hour specials. Which was jacked up because our table was in the bar area, but their happy hour specials only apply for the costumers seating at the bar only.We selected to go kinda light since we was eating all mourning & afternoon on our tour. We ordered two appetizers with water to drink, and the bill was over $31 without the tip added. The staff was very courtesy and professional. The restaurant was very clean and maintained. There was plenty of seating and I could tell that they could accommodate small and large groups.

Most of it is marketing. The place is overrated and overpriced! But what actually shocked was service: person sees me sitting with a child and asking basics like ""is this spicy?"" and ""How large is the serving?"" and ""It's 430pm, we're not really hungry"" ... and so forth.... They didn't bother to accommodate to the child or me at all. I loudly and clearly said my child had chosen the meatballs and that I wanted another appetizer and was still thinking IF we were going to have entrees. Then I hear that I am supposed to order it all together because the kitchen people don't like to take broken orders? Or something along those lines... (whatever it is the kitchen people's preference is) And who the hell is the customer here?? -- I take a deep breath as we were having such a good day up until we stepped in this restaurant. Why ruin it? I let my guard down and said, well ok then, I'll take the recommended special. Ends up that I get undercooked spicy meatballs, which go to waste! The main course (recommended medium rare) comes pretty raw, as in chewy-raw, rubbery almost -- seems like the kitchen people were in a rush -- and don't take me wrong I do like seeing blood in my steak. So when I say raw, I mean it! And when I say chewy and rubbery, im not pleased with what I'm chewing. After good ten minutes trying to find a good soul to bring me a steak knife --- coz I had been given a butter knife ... yeah go figure --- I try to share my food with my child, who is also a blood sucker... but neither of us can take it.   At that point child's and mom's delight were gone.

When he opened the Red Rooster, I knew I'd be experiencing a restaurant that would have his influence but it's roots would be in New York. That is how I would describe Red Rooster Harlem.I walk into a beautiful restaurant decorated for the holidays. There is a couple in front of me with luggage in tow. I asked them, going anywhere exciting? I'm told they're here from LA on vacation. They saw the Rockettes and now they want to experience Red Rooster. Very impressive.We're seated and shown menus. I was in Nashville over the summer and tasted the Nashville ""Hot Chicken"". Hot sauced up, it was good but I'm thinking the Crispy Bird Sandwich is a total different experience.Starting with Deviled Eggs, this was a different take on what your neighbors make for the backyard BBQ. Fried capers?! Man, this was a nice spin on the traditional dish.My Crispy Bird Sandwich comes to me. From what I've read about Marcus Samuelsson, this chicken isn't soaked in Franks Hot Sauce. Its topped with Doro Wat. Doro Wat is a fiery, bright red and flavorful Ethiopian spice blend. His family spices are now on my plate. It was very good and something I never had before, it went well with the chicken. It's something that elevated the dish entirely, as a chef would prepare in his own restaurant.Even the french fries were cheff'd up!

Regrettably, we did have to wait about 25 minutes before we were seated, which was not fun. Once we sat down, our waitress immediately came over and said hi. This was a great theme of the evening -- our waitress was always super attentive and friendly. There were never any moments were we were wondering where she was or where we went long without getting something we needed.We ordered the beets, the salad, the deviled eggs, the yardbird, brussels sprouts and the Obama short ribs. The appetizers were great. I don't know how Red Rooster managed to make a deviled egg taste complex and exciting, but they did. And the ""drunken grapes"" in the remix salad were seriously amazing. Also, those Brussels sprouts are ADDICTIVE. They are so crunchy, but also creamy, and ridiculously tasty.When the entrees came out, we were shocked at their hugeness. The Yardbird was DELICIOUS. Super crispy, juicy on the inside, and a lot of fun to eat. However, I was very disappointed with the Obama short ribs. It was basically just a big swirl of fat in way-too-sweet sauce. Like, gag-inducingly sweet. I ended up sending it back and ordering the salmon. Again, I was impressed with how kind our waitress was. I don't often send back food and felt really embarrassed/bad, but she was super nice and understanding. The salmon I got was nothing incredible, but tasted pretty good. I liked the crispy skin on top of it. The ambience is lovely, but if you go on a jazz night it's definitely kind of loud. The food is a lot of fun -- I would definitely recommend getting the hot honey yardbird & the deviled eggs & sprouts. If you like sweet/fatty meat, the short ribs could be for you (a lot of other people seem to love them??). And the service is great -- the restaurant is busy, but you never feel like you have to flag down your server or like you have gone too long without seeing her.",1,0,0,Riva L.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",454,266,170

It's always lovely to have an upscale eating experience with a laid back feel. So let's get into particulars...It is a place to see and be seen, if that's your thing. The food is typical NYC pricing, but more reasonable. It's worth it, you won't regret it.D.I.V.E.R.S.I.T.YEvery day you go is a good time but brunch is especially special. HUGE shoutout to Yves and Roxy for making this Harlem transplant feel welcome. The staff is awesome but those two stood out especially well.

3.0,11/24/2018,"My kids, who are 20-something Ethiopian Americans, were excited to try this restaurant owned by Marcus Samuelsson-- the famous Ethiopian Swedish chef. The positive: Friendly greeting and fast service. Overall, the food was very good (we sampled ribs, Jerk chicken, Lenox burger, deviled eggs, meatballs, cornbread w pumpkin butter, Brussels sprouts, chicken wings). The negative: The chairs are rickety and uncomfortable. There is not enough space between tables, so the wait staff kept knocking into my chair the whole meal. The wings were undercooked. All of us at the table agreed. The waitress tried to convince us that it was the brining process and just the vein near the bone was red and brought a chef / manager over to tell us the same. But the flesh was translucent and no one could finish a wing because of it. Worst customer service handling that type of issue ever. Plus, and this is a small thing, after we ordered apps, the waitress asked sweetly, ""Would you like cornbread for the table?"" We said yes, but then it was charged at $5 for one small round of cornbread. Bottom line: To me, there was a cheap quality to this upscale restaurant (I consider $30 for a burger upscale): efforts to pad the bill and tussle to get something inadequately prepared -- and uneaten -- off the check that detracted from an otherwise pleasant, casual, satisfying meal.",0,0,0,Kathy W.,"Chicago, IL",119,9,0

This year my family and my boyfriends family flew from California to have Thanksgiving with us at Red Rooster knowing the food was going to be SLAMMING (per usual).  And didn't want to spend money anywhere but in Harlem(We both have been living in Harlem for years now). We all came starving and ready to indulge in Thanksgiving Pre Fix meal. First course: 4 of us got the soup, we laughed when it came out because the soup hardly covered the bottom of the bowl...? It was maybe enough for three tablespoons. The other 4 of us got salads and it was maybe enough for three bites. Corn bread: VERY dry. Not Red Rooster's usual cornbread and had no taste. (Also had to ask for it to come out 3 times). Super disappointing because I had been talking about it all day. Main courses: all tasted great, but portions were small. Short rib came with NO SIDES. Just a slab of short rib....super disappointing as we were all super excited for this meal. Dessert: Good, but waited 20 extra minutes for our coffees to come out. We ordered (3) espressos and (2) coffee's. Once we asked for our bill and it came out we saw they charged us for (7) express is and (4) coffee's. So we then had to get the bill revised.

Although the meal came before hearing Samuelsson speak, I found myself underwhelmed by both the food and the man.I've lived in Chicago for a couple of years now, and tasted incredible soul food priced better than this. We ordered the yardbird, mac and cheese with collard greens, Obama short rib, cornbread, and meatballs, and found them good but not particularly special. The Yardbird's skin had a nice honey flavor to it, but the inside of the bird was pretty bland. My brother loved the mac and cheese, which I would say was probably the best dish of the night. But the cornbread, meatballs, and short rib were very underwhelming - I've had better elsewhere for much less. I don't mind paying money for good food, I actually love it, and I love supporting chefs of color, but this was rather disappointing. Especially after hearing Samuelsson give flat answers to questions around his relationship with the community in Harlem given its gentrification, I wish I had just taken my brother to Sylvia's instead, which I've heard is a much older institution, and has better food.

I have great respect for Marcus Samuelsson, his vision, creativity and initiatives, but at least last night things were somewhat a disaster kitchen-wise and dining-enjoyment wise. The restaurant now has a band playing at the bar most nights during dinner (probably to lure a larger lucrative bar crowd)--so loud it can be heard out on the street with the restaurant windows and doors closed and of course it blasts throughout the adjacent dining room as well.  This made it impossible for the four of us who were having dinner to hear each other AT ALL.  We were trying to celebrate a birthday but had to do so in silence or by shouting into the ear of the the person inches away from us.  The waiters couldn't hear us either and as a result there were mix-ups in our orders, two of us were served entrees 20 minutes after the other two, the plating of an hors'd'ouevre was so sloppy as to be laughable. To add to the mayhem, the food was not outstanding or particularly good (the sauce on one dish was cold), and we all left relieved to be out of there. The place was also overbooked: every table taken with a waiting line by the hostess stand even for those who had booked ahead. Mayhem.",1,0,0,Terri B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0

You only get three for $18.00 and they were small but you can taste the crab. The mac and cheese had collard greens in it. The price was $9 which can be shared for two people. It was extremely cheesy the way I liked my Mac, the only thing was the noodles could have been boiled just a little but more for my taste. The honey hot yardbird was amazing. The yardbird is huge, moist and seasoned perfectly. The honey gave it a nice taste and it was fried very well. Cutting into the yardbird was easy and soft. It wasn't salty at all and I'm highly recommending it. The decor is amazing and screams culture. The bathroom was nice and cool, had paintings and was spacious.

The waitress told me that the eggs on Mama's Pie would be runny, but they were hard. There wasn't a lot of meat in the dish. For dessert, we shared the coffee cake (which is in the appetizer section). The cake was dry and seemed stale. I had to ask for some of the waffle syrup to drizzle on it. The waitress was nice enough but she never asked us how our meal or our dessert was. The busser stopped refilling our water.

We (just two of us ) waited for 1.5 hours because we didn't make reservations, which was totally expected, no biggie to us. Once inside we were at on of the worst tables. The cafeteria table where you seat next to total strangers.  At least it was not the cafe table near the bathroom. Still not bad but, after waiting you don't want to be at that table near the food line and near strangers. We order deviled eggs & side of mac/greens to be brought out as appetizers with our drinks. I got the house ginger beer it was the worst ginger beers I ever had. We only received the deviled eggs. They were good. We both ordered the biscuits and gravy. It took 45 minutes maybe more. Two women we sat down next to ordered there food the same time we did. They were able to eat then sat and talked for another 25 minutes before our food arrived. The food line expediter a carmel complexion woman with blonde crochet braids clearly skipped us again and again. Our waitress spoke to her twice about our food. A bus guy even spoke to the kitchen.  Everyone that came in after us including larger parties received their food before us. They even ordered the same thing.  Had we not waited for 1.5 hours we would have left. Shitty experience. I feel as though we were initially skipped by the food expediter because she did not like our waitress because they could be heard arguing. We were right in front of her and she continued to get everyone else's food out, expect ours. Maybe she has a problem with female couples you can only jump to conclusions as to why she did what she did. Petty behavior at the expense of patrons is just wrong. Finally got the main meals. The mac and greens never arrived. My meal was nothing to jump for joy. Biscuit was dense. My gf's chicken had a lot gristle she kept having to remove from her mouth.

5.0,10/8/2018,"I've been to Red Rooster twice, and each time it has proved to me why it is such an important staple of the neighborhood. The ambiance: stunning tribute to Harlem and the culture around it. You really need only step in the doors of Red Rooster to feel the appreciation and respect owner Marcus Samuelsson has for the area. It is something easier felt than described. The service: the service here is a bit slow. However, the restaurant is also *always* busy and packed. If the rest of the experience wasn't so stellar, this would bother me more. The food: Incredible. Consistent. Flavorful. I highly recommend trying the small plates - which include a crab tostada, deviled eggs, and cornbread - to start off your meal. They are the cheapest thing on the menu, but packed with flavor and a wonderful homey feel. I don't generally care for deviled eggs, but I practically licked the plate clean. The cornbread is unctuous and rich and served with a delectable savory jam. I got the lamb chops for my entree, and when one of them arrived overdone, the waitress promptly removed the chop and returned with a properly cooked one. Everyone else I was with enjoyed their entrees as well both times I went. We didn't have room for dessert, but the drinks throughout dinner (we tried their punches) were great.

For charging as much as they do, I think a pleasant server who has a better response to the size of a side dish than it's a side. About how big? How many people does it usually serve? I mean I know you want everyone to get their own side, more money spent, but be reasonable. Our table spent close to $100 for extremely poor service, average food, and having to remind the server that all our food didn't actually come to the table. So while waiting for the remaining food, the rest got cold. I asked to speak to the manager, TWICE, but I guess they don't actually care about their customers because the manager never showed his/her face.

I initially wanted to give it three stars cos I was not super impressed with their food (it was featured on Buzzfeed's Worth it series though!!) but I give it four stars cos the drinks were delicious and the staff were very hospitable.I came here for a dinner date (definitely make reservations beforehand cos it was packed!) and it's on the more upscale end for the neighborhood. We were also the youngest people there (most of them looked like adults in their 30s to 40s who just got off of work). Our table was just getting cleared off so we ordered drinks while we waited - while you can carry your drinks over, they don't deliver and the tab doesn't carry over so you have to close it out before you sit down as an FYI. I really La Botanica and my friend got a Brownstoner. His drink ended up being really strong but mine was very refreshing and not as strong (maybe cos a lot of ice?) but I still liked them nevertheless.We ended up ordering the crab cakes, Malcom lox toast, and the yardbird to share. We wanted to order the special but they had already run out. I really liked everything as they were quite tasty but not super memorable. The crab cakes needed the sauce as it was a bit dry. The toast was great but the bread could have been more crispy. The chicken was also very moist but I was kind of disappointed by the lack of crunch and flavor in the skin. For me that's always the key to really good fried chicken. Also, the yardbird is a little bit difficult to eat (esp for a first date) since it wasn't broken down but my friend cut it up for me. I think other people ordered a set where the chicken came in pieces so that might be the way to go!To finish, we shared the five spice donut which was really amazing! We've never had corn ice cream and we loved how it tasted with the warm donut. The party next to us (we sat across from each other at the communal table) ordered the s'mores dessert which looked super decadent but I was already too full so the doughnut to share was perfect.Presentation of food is on point and drinks are delicious.

Interupting mine and my dates conversation too much for my liking. Even if I had a few bites left. Getting to a few bites I ordered chicken and waffles and received half a waffle and one piece of chicken. I dislike spicy food and both the waffle and chicken had a spicy kick and I was not forwarned. Btw Waffles do not cost enough to give only half. I never have seen such a thing and one small piece of chicken that sat over this half of a waffle. Cornbread was hard and just dry. Smh I was still hungry and the prices were too high to order anything else. Also I ordered a Margarita. The first was blah second worse. Loved the ambiance, the restroom was clean and classy. Don't like the smocks the waiters wore. It makes them look dirty or in a butcher shop all bloody. It just doesn't go with the service or flow of the restaurant. Would I recommend Red Rooster probably not first on my list. If asked about it I would say it was ok. Everyone has different taste try it if you'd like.

We were late for our 7 pm reservation because several members of our party were delayed, but the hostess kindly let us hang out at the bar and move the rezzie back to 8. First of all, let me start off by saying that the drinks are expensive but fabulous. They have something for everyone, let me assure you. The atmosphere when you walk in is an energetic one. People are excitedly talking, the DJ is blasting hip music, and you feel like you're in this cool Harlem social club. Then finally we were seated in a booth and we proceeded to order. The food is phenomenal. It's got a southern flair but always with an interesting twist - chicken and waffles with red velvet waffles, shrimp and grits and chorizo, Mac and greens rather than the standard Mac and cheese. We devoured almost every bite until we couldn't stuff any more down. The desserts were also yummy but definitely were not the star of the show. I would most recommend the Obama Short Ribs.My only complaint is that our waitress was rather surly and not friendly at all.

I appreciated that the decor reflected a lot of history and culture, and the staff were all friendly.Food: Mac&Greens was amazing, very different from any other mac and cheese I've had. the noodles are fat and hollow, like paccheri, the cheese is gooey with a perfect golden crust on top, and the collard greens just add something different with each bite. Maybe a little reassurance that what you're eating is not all just carbs and cheese. Hot Honey Yardbird. They pretty much fry half a chicken and plop it down on a bed of collard greens and pickled onions and mashed potatoes with gravy. The sides were a little sweet-savory, all delicious. And the chicken was so juicy. I didn't think it was hot at all, but I picked up on the honey and some curry that they rub the chicken with before frying. Left so satisfied and full.

It came out beautifully and they allowed us to take pictures before they carved it. Since there were three of us I asked if they could bring us an extra biscuit.

My costly meal which came in small portions appeared delectable but tasted subpar, some over cooked &  some under cooked.

It was supposed to be Rooster Donutsvanilla donuts, mango cream, fresno chile, lime glazeSounds good right? We didn't get that, What we got was A plain donut (not donuts) with a blueberry topping that tasted like they were frozen blueberries with popcorn and some sort of odd tasting salt.

All the people who helped us out that night were very friendly and helpful. However, the part where I was left disappointed was the food. My family and I got the fried bird royale. Though on the menu, it says it's for two people, it can easily feed three to four people (the three of us had leftovers). The crust on the chicken is really crunchy and tasty, but the inside lacked flavor and for the majority of the pieces of chicken I had were dry. The biscuits and red velvet waffles were alright, but I will say the mac and greens were delicious. We also got corn bread, and that was incredible.

Upon entry into the red rooster on the morning of 8/8/18 at approx 1230am, we were stopped by 3 security officers at the outside entrance. We were immediately asked for ID. Which i had no problem, especially during todays times. Then he asked to search me (male), not my wife. Again, i had no problem. Prior to the search we observed 5 people enter on the other side, 3 were males, they showed their ID and they were allowed entry. I asked why they did not get searched. The Security officer had no response. I then looked at the situation and realized that they were Caucasian males and i was a middle aged African American. I asked the officers why this occurred and what was the difference. The supervisor of the security officers who had glasses aggressively responded in a negative and aggressive tone, Refused to give his name nor would escalate to a manager.

The hostess was very gracious as my friend was  little on the late side for the reservation time. Once she arrived we were promptly seated on the outside patio. They inside dining room tends to be a bit loud. We started with the deviled eggs, which are a must try. They're served with chicken chicharron and caramelized onion. The onion add a nice sweetness. Next we ordered two glasses of red wine. Now I understand red wine is served at room temperature, but when it's 98 NYC degrees outside the wine should definitely be kept in a temperature controlled room, which it was not and was served to us at what seemed like 75 degrees. No beuno. For dinner I had the Obama short rib and my friend had the jerk chicken. The rib was a heaping portion that's served with veggies, a biscuit and a few pieces of lobster. The accompaniments were great and the short rib was tender, but the sauce it was drenched in was very sweet and kind of threw the entire dish off balance. Although not spicy, my friend enjoyed the jerk chicken. She was it the leg/thigh quarter was juicy and flavorful. In my opinion, the rousing bar scene is the real reason to visit.

3.0,9/3/2018,"Here is the 3-1-1: Food: Going into the infamous Samuelsson restaurant my taste buds were ready to go. As the menu had many options we decided to go with the famous fried chicken which was described as a whole chicken deep fried and accompanied with red velvet waffles and truffle mac & cheese. But before the chicken was brought out we had the crab cakes which were full of crab meat and minimal breading which made it a really great bite of crab. The waitress also recommended the corn bread which was ok but felt like wasted calories. As the chicken came out in its whole, we were all very excited but once we took the picture the waiter brought it back to the kitchen to cut up and when he returned the chicken was darker so we did not ask why but we all assumed that the 1st chicken was a show chicken and that what we ate was just fried chicken pieces that make to order; however the pieces were tender and packed a jerk type flavor profile. The mac & cheese was very heavy in cheese which is not a bad thing so if you like cheese with your mac this works. The waffles were light and paired well with chicken as well. We also ordered the shrimp & grits which balanced with the chicken as the creaminess of the grits help offset the fried goodness. Unfortunately, the executive chef listed on the menu was not Marcus but he taught his chefs well.Service: Friendly staff and very attentive with follow up and making sure your drinks were never empty and I mean the water as well the booze.Ambiance: Getting there early is a plus as the live music does not start until 8pm and then it becomes very lively and hard for conversations.",0,0,0,Irwan A.,"South San Francisco, CA",39,136,88

The food is rich and a combination of Scandinavian, African and American cuisine. As expected it is inventive. Nothing like Samuelson's earlier gigs at Aquavit, but more in way of elegant comfort food. We loved Helga's Meatballs. Juicy, full of spices and fresh herbs. The Langston's Crabcakes were made with ground crab meat and flour and/or egg filler. They were overcooked, hard and dry. Stuff you can buy at a low end grocery store. The cornbread was fresh and served with marinated plum tomatoes and mayo. I could do without the latter two. The drinks were fantastic though!

The salad consisted of a few leaves of lettuce thrown on a plate with nothing else, period. We asked three times for salad dressing. They finally brought it. Ridiculous. We asked for ice four times. I don't think the guy would have brought it had I not stared him down. Again, ridiculous. Not sure how this place stays in business. Maybe it's the live music and the drinks? It sure can't be because of the service or the food. It was our first and last time here.",0,1,0,Jeff T.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",141,30,40

2.0,8/27/2018,"We had a wonderful server.  She couldn't do enough and was very apologetic. The food was very disappointing.  It was restaurant week and we went for lunch. The fried chicken is famous and I have been waiting to try it.  First, my friend was served the wrong appetizer from the kitchen.  When he explained that, he was told to keep what was brought and they would still bring the appetizer (soup) he had ordered.  Well the soup never arrived.  We finally told our server when the main course arrived.  She brought the soup.  My chicken was almost non existent.  Maybe because it was restaurant week or lunch or both, it was such a tiny piece.  It was a chicken leg and part of a thigh but it was mostly bone.  I had to pick it over to get any meat at all..totally unsatisfying.  After that there was another mistake with food.  I was comped my coffee which was nice but neither of us would return to this restaurant.  Sometimes hype is hype.  I don't want to spend almost $50 including wine and go away hungry.",0,0,0,Nancy S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0
5.0,8/26/2018,"Went here for brunch and the place was hoppin'! Red Rooster is very crowded and loud on Sundays, especially with the live jazz band, but it makes for a fun and lively atmosphere to enjoy your brunch. My husband and I got the chicken and waffles which were delicious. The chicken is smothered in a spicy sauce that has the right amount of spice without being too overpowering. We also ordered cornbread which had a nice light and crumbly texture. The cornbread was paired with whipped butter and tomato jam which was so good. We walked in with no reservations and waited about 45 minutes for a table, which wasn't too bad since we could listen to the live band while we waited. You can also leave and go for a walk around the block and they will text you when your table is ready.",0,0,0,Lisa S.,"Alexandria, VA",0,2,0

The appetizers were great- we had the wings, cornbread, crab cakes and Goddess Josephine salad. Everything was delicious! Then dinner came.. needless to say, we were all disappointed. I ordered the Pasta Pescatore and it was not great. It was cold, very little seafood and just overall not worth the price.

3.0,8/23/2018,"I was really looking forward to dining at this well-known establishment but ended up extremely disappointed. I ordered the Fish Fry entree. Batter was too thick and the hot spice overpowered the fish. In addition, the black eyed peas were underdone. The best part of the dish may have been the collared greens because they were not overseasoned (actually underseasoned), which was a welcome break after trying to give the fish and peas a good try. My husband had the yardbird; it was definitely the better entree. Mashed potatoes and gravy were deliciously creamy. The fried chicken was pretty good although it didn't remind me of the fried chicken I was raised on in the South. I'm giving three stars because the service was outstanding despite the disappointment of my order.

The restaurant is spacious and there are posters everywhere.We began with their cornbread which was so buttery, so moist, so delicious, it was honestly so good I would be so happy to go back just for that.We got the chicken and waffle next which was so intensely flavorful, and had that perfect golden crispiness it was to die for.Lastly, we got the Obama Short Rib ($80). It was really cool to taste a part of history but it was definitely not something I would order again.

5.0,8/19/2018,"As a gal from the south, I am often under impressed with restaurants (especially in the north) that aim to make southern food. However, you can tell that Marcus Samuelsson maintains a great deal of integrity in the back of the house to ensure that the flavors of the south come through in every dish. A side as simple as collard greens (which I normally am not a fan of) becomes a memorable and delicious treat that, if it were socially acceptable, you'd lick your plate afterwards.  I restrained myself to the delight of those I dined with.  The atmosphere is fabulous with the lively band...and service is impeccable.

5.0,8/15/2018,"I came here for lunch by myself for restaurant week. I've been dying to try Red Rooster for a while since I have heard many great things about it but never had the chance to go. I decided to try it out for lunch one day since it was restaurant week and I am so happy I went. The food, the service, the staff- everything was amazing. Annalise was my waitress and she was very nice. She was super informed about everything on the menu and helped guide me with what to order. I opted for the restaurant week menu. For my first course I had the meatballs which I loved. They were a great size (not too big which was good considering I had my second and third course coming). I also ordered a side of cornbread since she said it was very popular. It was served with a sweet honey butter and was the perfect combination. For my main course I had the mushroom pasta. I was a little weary about ordering that as opposed to the chicken or shrimp and grits. I felt like those items are the most popular, but after having meat for my appetizer I didn't want it for my next course. Annalise explained the way they make the pasta and how it's Ethiopian influences give it a nice kick. It's also made with a tomato based sauce as opposed to a traditional cream based sauce (how most mushroom pastas are made). The pasta was absolutely unbelievable. It was one of the best pastas I have had in a while. It was rich, flavorful and just truly amazing. For dessert I had the pineapple upside down cake which I loved but could only have a few bites since I was so full from the pasta. I was very happy with my experience. The restaurant has a really relaxed vibe and seems very causal but the food they are making us really amazing. I will definitely be coming back and bringing more people.",0,0,0,Violeta C.,"West Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",8,14,7
4.0,8/13/2018,"I visited during restaurant week because I was a fan of Marcus Samuelsson, the chef and owner of the place. The restaurant was busy, but wasn't too crowded. It had a lively atmosphere with a laid back vibe. An interesting thing we noticed was they had an area where they grew their own herbs, most likely to be used in their dishes. My girlfriend ordered the chilled corn soup, shrimp & grits, and tiramisu. I ordered the helga's meatballs, yard bird, and pineapple cake. It took a while for our orders to arrive. But being it was the lunch time rush, we patiently waited and entertained ourselves by checking out the decor. The corn soup and meatballs came first. The soup was creamy and slightly spicy, similar to a curry sauce. It was served chilled and we could taste some sort of dairy in it, perhaps coconut milk. The meatballs were served in a tomato sauce with ricotta cheese and garnished with herbs they grew in the restaurant. We thought the meatballs were a bit salty, and would've been better if it came with some bread. Next came the shrimp & grits and yard bird. The yard bird was extremely crispy and served with garlic mashed potatoes and succotash. I'm normally not a fan of mashed potatoes, but these were great. They were creamy with a nice garlic flavor that went well with the chicken. The succotash was good, slightly salty and paired well with the potatoes and chicken. I tried my girlfriend's shrimp & grits. The shrimp was cooked perfectly, well seasoned, juicy and flavorful. It went perfectly with the grits which had a slight spice to it. She tried my chicken and commented on how crispy and juicy it was. Of the two entrees, she liked the yard bird the most. I thought the shrimp and grits were great, but ultimately have to agree that nothing beats Marcus's famous fried chicken. Lastly our desserts arrived. The tiramisu was cold and the pineapple rum cake was warm. Both desserts were great, not too sweet and was a great end for the meal. Of the two, we felt the rum cake was slightly better because we thought the tiramisu was too hard and frozen. The cake was moist and had a nice soft rum flavor to it. Overall, our experience at Red Rooster was great. The staff was very attentive and friendly. The portions were perfect for a midday lunch, and we left satisfied but not stuffed. It was a wonderful experience being able to step into Marcus's restaurant to experience his food for the first time. The price was reasonable, but still pricey for being a lunch time meal. But being a restaurant ran by a famous chef and being well known, it was expected. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is a fan of Marcus Samuelsson or good food in general. Especially if they can get a decent deal such as during restaurant week.",1,0,2,Ken C.,"New York, NY",2,31,23

Man were they hungry.I decided on getting The Uptown Ribeye which was a 28 day dry aged ribeye which came with hennessey-glazed peaches, mustard greens, and chimichurri. Really tasty and made well. We also split the Fried Bird Royale which came with buttermilk fried whole chicken, mac & greens, biscuits, red velvet waffle, hot honey, pickles, and foie gras butter. Definitely some of the best fried chicken I have ever had in NYC.Everything was soo filling and then they brought out dessert for my birthday with a candle even though I didn't want it from being soo full.

3.0,8/12/2018,"Where to begin, like any other tourist I found my self conflicted between this place and Sylvia's. After deciding that Marcus Samuelsson's brand might provide the kind of food and experience I was looking for I ended up there. Upon entry there wasn't anyone at the host stand, five or so minutes later we were seated outside after our indoor table was taken by another host? Our host walked us outside and this followed another ten/fifteen minute wait before a server even came to the table. We got water and a new server came took our drink order and waited another 15 minutes for the drinks. She returned for appetizers those came out in good time (deviled eggs- the crispy chicken skin was a nice touch but haphazardly thrown together or wiggles around in transport) fairly basic in flavor nothing special. We ordered the fried yardbird royale with buttermilk fried whole chicken, mac & greens, biscuits, red velvet waffle, hot honey, pickles, and foie gras butter. After over an hour there we paid no attention to what arrived at the table. We even commented on the thoughtfulness of the chicken being split on to two plates. We waited for our server and the second drink I had ordered but nothing. All the sides promised never arrived so we began eating hoping they would come eventually as we ate. Our server finally came only to tell us that we got the wrong dishes and it was meant for the table next to ours (a shock since they got there minutes after we got seated) I thought the plates would be taken off and our actual meal would be arriving but that never happened. We ordered two of sides that were supposed to come with the original meal and those got comped but the incident ruined the experience. Our server was very nice and accommodating with in her authority. Before leaving I went to the bathroom and was greeted by a security guard at the entrance of the main dining room. That threw another wrench into the experience. You'd never expect to see security guards at a place like this.The highlights of the restaurant would be the honey hot chicken (not spicy) moist and crispy, the red velvet waffle is Buttery and flavorful, the Mac and cheese is also delicious. The vibe in there feels like a posh local Caribbean bar with lively music and cocktails so that was fun.

2.0,8/8/2018,"I visited with four colleagues and two of the five of us ordered from the restaurant week menu. I got the impression that they have received comments/complaints about the portion size of food from the special menu because the waitress told us, on two separate occasions, that the portion size was much smaller than the usual menu. Since it was lunch, we were fine with the reduced size. Our cocktails, which were rather boring, were comped because we waited so long for them; a nice surprise. The waitress was very pleasant & service was efficient & friendly.  Note that they will not seat you until your entire party is present even though we had a late reservation (2:30) and the place was relatively empty. I was excited to try the food  given the chef's fame & expected something special. Unfortunately, I was completely underwhelmed. The individual ingredients in the salad promised a pop of flavor but somehow, it was boring & tasteless. My friend enjoyed the meatballs. We also had the shrimp & grits. It was passable but nothing special. She was not kidding about size - 3 medium shrimp. The pineapple upside down cake lacked the usual caramel-like coating and had no rum flavor but the coconut cream that accompanied it was very good.

5.0,8/5/2018,"Our meal at Red Rooster was far from perfect but it's when things don't go right does one find out how good a dining establishment really is. By now, everyone knows that this is a restaurant owned and operated by a celebrity chef but for it to keep going as strong as it has, the experience needs to be top notch.  The family came for a birthday so we went all out.  We ordered chicken and waffles, meatballs, deviled eggs, corn bread and salad for appetizers.  Corn bread was really good (tomato jam was perfect complement to the sweet bread), meatballs were good but a tad salty for my taste but the chicken and waffles was seriously out of this world.  One large crispy leg served on half of a red velvet waffle with the best sweet and hot sauce made everyone really happy.  It's really enough for an entree if you're so inclined.  Entrees were also good but was where we had our major issue.  Yardbird was crispy and succulent, the Obama short rib was just so-so (they overcooked the rib so it was a tad dry) but where we got burned was the seafood festival jambalaya.  The jambalaya is a dish for 2 and for 75 bucks a bit of a splurge.  It comes with clams, mussels, shredded fried chicken, lobster and soft shell crab.  It looked delicious but when we took a bite, we realized that the rice was severely undercooked.  It was crunchy and therefore inedible.  Disappointed, we spoke to our server who was instantly concerned.  She asked if we wanted to send it back but since we had waited a long time for our food, we declined and just decided to eat the seafood (which was cooked perfectly).  Shortly afterwards, the manager came by, apologized profusely, and had the dish removed from the bill - no muss, no fuss.  We also got some sides that were pretty good - broccoli was sweet and spicy, mac n cheese was also really good, street corn would've been better if it wasn't on the cob.Service here was exceptional.  Anyone who complains clearly has no understanding how crazy a service can be in a restaurant this busy or is entitled on a level reserved for trust fund babies.  Our server was polite, prompt and made what could have been a terrible experience, good.  The prices here are a bit steep but the portions were pretty large so its justifiable.  You shouldn't leave hungry.  Red Rooster gets 5 stars not because the meal was perfect but because they knew exactly what to do when someone's meal isn't.  Will definitely be back.",6,1,2,Howard H.,"Flushing, NY",128,733,1680
2.0,8/5/2018,"What a disappointment!!! This place is NOT FOR LOCALS! I came here after seeing Marcus Samuelson on chopped. I love his personality and style but unfortunately this place is bad representation of what he stands for. First off, the service was inattentive. While we were at the bar waiting to be seated the bartender almost charged us for someone else's meal.The host asked us to wait until 2 to be put down on the wait list, meanwhile he went ahead and sat other people, with the same party size, who arrived after us. The host had an attitude and cared very little about customer service. Once seated, it took a while to take our order in. Our empty glasses (fromPrevious beverages) were not removed until about halfway through our meal. The busboys kept passing by, looking at the glasses which we had cornered and ignoring it. Our food was cold. We had to send some dishes back and ask for freshly made ones (they tried charging us double for one of the meals we sent back) -The biscuit was extremely salty & the pulled chicken was actually pulled skin -The lobster roll it's a complete waste. It was mostly fries  and bread, and very minimum, super minimum lobster, so minimum that I had a hard time finding it. -The Mac & cheese was bad, the pasta was overly cooked and it felt short from the traditional Mac and cheese by having 0 flavor. The fried chicken was good, might be the only dish I recommend. Overall, this place is overly price. The quality of the food is not worth the cost, at all. The only reason why I give this place a 2 Star is because I did love the ambiance- Jazz music, decoration and our waitress ""analisse"" who tried her best to give us a better experience.

When I reserved the table last week, I had requested a table that was in view of the live band but not close to it; so, when I saw that our table was right beside the live band, my guests thought we wouldn't be able to eat in peace or talk to each other - WRONG! We could not have been placed in a more perfect spot! The food was excellent; I had the chicken and waffles, and tried one of my friend's chicken wings. I really liked that they put hot sauce all over my chicken without my having to ask! I ordered the peach pound cake for dessert (the dessert menu is really creative, and I may stop in Red Rooster a few more times just to try every one), and, when the server brought it out with a lit birthday candle, the live band (The Raheim Walker Project) serenaded me.  AND if things couldn't have been more perfect, I received another peach pound cake slice with a lit birthday candle immediately after the impromptu serenade (double the wishes!!! My friends and I shared them).  The atmosphere was wonderful, and even though the front of the restaurant was packed, the staff and patrons were courteous, dancing and in a mood to have a good time with no drama; it was relaxed fun for adults... just good juju all over the place. Oh, and when my guests showed up late, the hosts did not rush me; in fact, one helped me find an outlet to charge my phone and he watched it for me when I rushed to the door to greet my guests and take pics outside (I didn't ask him to; he just did because he's a thoughtful person).

4.0,7/30/2018,"Making up my own rating 4.5 -- the food is good. Slightly overpriced in my opinion, but mostly worth it because of the taste and the ambience of the whole place. I had the cornbread, chicken and waffle and tried my friends' Mac and cheese with collard greens and chicken with biscuits and gravy. I think I liked either my dish or the Mac and cheese the best. The live blues/jazz music were great and the decor plays homage to some of the history of Harlem and the African diaspora. The reason I'm docking a star is because despite making a reservation we still had to wait almost 30 minutes.

2.0,7/27/2018,"I always look forward to visiting Harlem's, Red Rooster. However, after my recent visit, I am disappointed and $80 poorer for the experience. Obviously, it remains a happening place. Unfortunately, the quality of its cuisine and service, has waned as its popularity grew. The noise level is disturbing as well. I couldn't hear the person directly next to me at any point during this visit. Although I'd planned to order from the Restaurant Week menu, my guest and I ordered from the regular menu.What a mistake! At least, we wouldn't have wasted as much money. Not one dish was satisfying. Over-salted EVERYTHING...even the signature appetizer, Helga's Meatballs was tepid and not up to par...In addition, our waitress went AWOL, messed up the drink order, and didn't even reappear to pick up the check payment. There was no bread, cornbread or anything brought to the table. We ordered Helga's meatballs, usually sublime and delicious. They were disappointing, barely warmed in a congealed sauce with a strange glop of what appeared to be cottage cheese and something crackly that was inedible. I decided to try something I had had before: Shrimp and grits. It came with four shrimp & maybe two tablespoons of badly, over seasoned and salty 'grits' on a huge platter...In no way, did it resemble the entree I've had before...& $80 dollars later, I'm very, very disappointed...a total waste of money.

Upon tasting it, there is a minty freshness that is mixed with lemon & what is called berbere. I can compare it to a paprika-tasting seasoning that was sprinkled on a slice of lemon. The warm seasoning on the lemon pairs extremely well with the freshness of the mint. It offers a different yet balanced flavor.Spice Road Mussel Pot: Talk about perfectly flavored! Its is a touch spicy with curry, fresh with lemon, salty from mussels, & sweet with coconut milk. This is outrageous & is just the appetizer!Ol' Dirty Porcini Pasta: There is a tolerable heat that is coming from the sauce on the pasta. The mushrooms add that meaty texture to the pasta without there being meat in it. I've never had fava beans that are in the dish before today. They add a bite to the dish.

The food was delectable. The fried chicken was crisp on the outside but quite juicy and succulent inside. Trust me, even the breast was very juicy. How could I forget the collard greens and beets concoction. That was to die for. I had a red sangria which was nice.  The shrimp and grits with okra was tasty dish as well.

2.0,7/23/2018,"So, this may be one of the first truly negative reviews I have written, but our night a Red Rooster was truly disappointing. We have been following Marcus Samuelsson for years but for a variety of circumstances never made it to RR before. Driving in to Manhattan just for dinner and to celebrate special occasions, we were expecting to have a positive experience. We knew that RR is literally the antithesis of Aquavit. Where one is serene, minimalistic, and every attention to detail worked at, Red Rooster is loud, busy and kind of haphazard, the last point being one that is unacceptable no matter what style of establishment. Some reviews have knocked the waitstaff, I am not certain I can fault ours. She was nice, reasonable attentive, and helpful. However, she could not make the kitchen perform and/or was not really in touch with the flow of our meal. In her defense there were managers on the floor and hosts/hostesses as well, all of which are supposed to be on top of service. Our appetizers came out so fast we wondered if they were meant for another table. Then after waiting for our entrees for over an hour when one of the managers came over and apologized - and when I asked if our order had been lost he responded, ""we had a large private party and the Kitchen got overwhelmed"". News flash, if you cannot handle large parties without letting the service slip to all the other patrons, don't book them. He delivered a serving of the ribs ""so that we have something to eat"" except two of our party were not rib eaters. It took another 15 minutes for our meal to arrive. Worse then the Kitchen was the seating. Had a fire official been there he would have shut them down. Literally - I almost took a photo so send to the Inspectors. They added chairs to the side booths which resulted in a bottle neck that was so severe my son was getting bumped continually as it was the main route to the kitchen. He was so miserable I had him change seats with me, and even with moving the table and swinging the chair around beyond reasonable I was still getting hit every time as there was still no room for the staff to pass. It even seemed that some of the waitstaff went out of their way to hit me in annoyance, though ours was the seating the restaurant was designed for. I raised this with the manager who preceded to ignore me and who did not offer to move us. It appeared that these tables were accommodations to the same private event - some sort of spill over or continuation, and we were clearly the second-class citizens of the evening. There was no attitude or intention of ""trying to make things right"" on the part of the manager. To the food, mostly good interesting takes on classic items. However, my wife's salad was gritty as if it hadn't been washed, and her pasta portion so meager that we discussed if they had run out as a result of the ""big party"" and they didn't have the heart to bring us any more bad news. I will also add that towards the end of the evening is was clear that no one was attending the restrooms, they were a mess. Disappointment is the difference between expectation and reality, and we certainly didn't expect a set of negative experiences. Highly disappointing.",1,0,0,Andrew P.,"Pearl River, NY",0,12,0

Pros: He ordered the chicken and waffles. I tried the waffle and it was great. I skipped the chicken because it was what he wanted (didn't want to rob him of his chicken). I ordered the French toast: perfection! crunchy outside and soft inside (not super gooey)Biggest con: we waited 1.5 hours for food. We put in our order with a bartender, who disappeared after we placed our order. We kept asking the wait staff about our order or the location of the bartender. Nothing. No one checked back with us. Finally we see the bartender--he returned from break to inform us that our order was not put in. (Say what?)

I've had amazing $5 fried chicken in Knoxville, TN and unbelievable on in a random supermarket in Virginia. For $76 I expect something outstanding - however the chicken on the inside was raw at some places and a lot of the meat straight up uneatable so I ended tossing it. Nothing about this melting in your mouth goodness I was craving. I can clearly say even Popeyes fried chicken is better... The sides were OK, yet very mini for the $76 feast you would expect. The crab cakes were tasty, however I'm pretty sure they gave both of us some stomach upset the next morning... My ""Obamatini"" was way too spicy to feel the flavor.

4.0,7/15/2018,"I had known of Red Rooster for years but never really had a burning desire to go, mainly because I can take or leave Southern cuisine. However, my brother had always wanted to try it out and chose it to celebrate his latest birthday with the family. That being said, I was excited to try a new restaurant (for me at least) and see if it lived up to the hype. Red Rooster is a pretty popular spot in Harlem, mainly due to the fact that it's owned by celebrity chef Marcus Samuelsson. While they have traditional lunch and dinner service as one would expect, we went for their weekend brunch which is served every Saturday and Sunday from 10am to 3pm. Approaching the restaurant, they have a number of tables for outdoor dining, followed by a large semi-circle bar area inside. Behind the bar is the main dining room with an open kitchen serving at the centerpiece along the back. Like most Manhattan eateries, Red Rooster isn't large but doesn't feel cramped. The decor has a red aesthetic with pieces of art reflecting R&B music and culture along the walls; it was busy but not overwhelming. Because we were there for brunch, they had live music playing in the bar area which was a cool backdrop. I didn't notice any prix-fixe option, just apps/entrees/desserts like a traditional menu. There were 5 of us so we decided to split three apps: Marcus' cornbread (we ordered 3 of those due to the small size), chicken and waffle, and deviled eggs. While I didn't try the eggs, the chicken and waffle was nicely seasoned and had good flavor. The cornbread was tasty as well, it was pared with butter and this sweet onion chutney which complimented it well. The bread was served nice and warm which is *always* a plus. For my main I had the NY cheddar and kale omelette. Oh my - the eggs were fluffy yet held in all the filling, and the kale was sautéed nicely with the cheese to come up with a really good omelette. It was served with warm potato salad which had a cheese base - different and tasty. If that wasn't enough, we ordered two sides for the table: the grits and mac and greens. There were totally decadent - the grits were smooth and creamy, the mac was in a cream/cheese base paired with greens - excuse me while I jog 5 miles to burn it off UGH. We decided to split four desserts: the cinnamon roll, doughnut, crumb cake, and chef's selection pastry (in this case, chocolate mousse on top of shortbread). I was kind of underwhelmed by all of the desserts - they weren't necessarily bad, but they paled in creativity and flavor when compared to the apps and mains. Service was great - our waitress was super friendly and on top of her game. The entire process was very streamlined which I really appreciated; I've been to many restaurants where coordination among the staff is off and believe me it makes a difference. Overall, while the food didn't blow me away, Rooster delivered the goods. I'm always weary of trendy spots like these, but the food was quality and atmosphere was welcoming, so it's a yes from me.",15,4,7,Jason M.,"Bronx, NY",474,719,3173

I became intrigued about this place after I went to Sylvia's (and hated it don't go to that restaurant). As a fan of buzzfeed I also recall seeing this restaurant on an episode of ""worth it"", but the truth is, it's just an okay restaurant. The decor is amazing, it's loud and colorful and definitely makes an impression. I didn't have a reservation so I had to wait for about 45 min, but to be fair, I should have been more prepared and called ahead so I'm glad they were able to accommodate me. I got the Hot Yard Bird, it was okay and kind of soggy underneath because of the cabbage. The thing that struck me the most was the fact that I ordered everything the people on Buzzfeed ordered and everything seemed much different. I can't help thinking the only reason the food looked that amazing and delicious online was because Marcus made it himself. And oh, the restaurant was rated a ""B"" for sanitation when I ate there.

4.0,7/4/2018,"It's never a promising start when you have to flag down your waiter to order. I realize its busy but let me set the scene for you: walked in and waited for a table for one. Theres quite a line for a the hostess stand but I wait. Think she wanted to stick me at the bar, but I waited so I want to eat at a table now. Wait is estimated at twenty minutes.Within five minutes I was placed at a communal table at the end near the wall. Two other couples are there facing one another which is totally fine. Waiter comes by, takes the food order is the middle couple, and leaves to the kitchen. Couple of minutes roll by, he comes back, and takes the food order of the other couple, and leaves. The whole time, I'm trying to make eye contact to let him know I'm ready. I've been ready to order since I was on the subway train car. Finally dude comes back to drop off some cocktails and FINALLY he notices me and I order. Not a favorable first impression to be honest. Ordered the fried yard bird which is $27!! Good grief, are they importing the chicken from Kentucky? Just kidding. Let's get to this meal. First impressions? It's HUGE. Half a bird. It's excellent. Very juicy throughout with a crispy sweet skin. Since it's my first meal all day, I try to eat it all. I fail miserably. The mashed potatoes and dirty gravy were excellent addition with it. The succotash I wasn't a huge fan of. Too tangy for my liking.Overall, I thought the entree was great. Great for $27? Meh, maybe if it included slightly better service. Think it's probably a crapshoot for service with this place. They're really popular and can probably get away with it. Good luck and get the fried yard bird. p.s.

1.0,6/27/2018,"Hi Sheena,Thanks for your reply to me.First off, if there were a private event happening and you were closing early, then it should have been reflected on your website.

In any case, I arrived at your restaurant at 6pm and didn't see anyone there in a rush.Furthermore, your host should have informed me that you all were closing early on Monday and that there would be a time limit for eating instead of telling me there was a 10-minute wait, then, 30-minutes later, being told that I'd have to inhale my food in 50 minutes and be out of your precious eatery.

3.0,6/25/2018,"I'm a little torn writing this review. We  secured a reservation for a fairly large group of 10 including two young kiddos.  Customer service was great, everyone was very patient and accommodating.  We ordered the Red Sangria for 4 which had plenty of servings in there that you can actually stretch it to 5-6 glasses if you wanted.Since we were a large group, we decided to order from the ""It Takes Two"" side.  We asked our waiter if some of the items on there could accommodate a few people.  He said the items on there could feed a max of 3.  So we ordered two Fried Bird Royales, a Jambalaya, and then 2 regular entrees: shrimp and grits and the Obama short Ribs.  The food was excellent and you did not have to wait long.  It was probably the best fried chicken I ever had.  The crust on the outside was perfectly crusted and crispy with a sweet glaze of honey.  The meat was incredibly juicy and tender with a little kick to it.  The mac and cheese was baked with collards.  The  red velvet waffle was ok.  And the biscuits were delightful.  The jambalaya had an incredible soiree of seafood which included mussels, lobster, shrimp, and soft shell crab.  The short ribs were so tender and flavorful and incredibly rich!  It was topped with lobster.  The meal was fabulous.  The following is the reason the review is a 3.  Now we knew we were going to be dropping a lot of money since we ordered quite a bit and not on the cheap side.  However we wished the waiter was a little more honest with us in regards to the ""It Takes Two"" menu.  Maybe it is required for their wait staff to advertise it for 2-3 people but honestly it could have fed 4 people easily as it was a whole chicken.  We were also not made aware that the water we ordered came at an extra cost.  We thought we were drinking regular tap water however we were billed for 3 bottles of ""distilled"" water.

2.0,6/25/2018,"Red Rooster used to be amazing in the early days. Sadly, it's really gone downhill so I really felt I had to write. Let me say first that the staff was for the most part really wonderful. But as for the food at a recent dinner -- first of all, the iced tea had two ice chips in it; I had to ask for extra ice. An inauspicious beginning to a meal at a Southern-style restaurant. Also, the iced tea was flavored (with a berry tea) but we weren't told about that beforehand. Next came the Green Goddess salad. The lettuce, which was supposed to be iceberg, was not crunchy at all but was sopping with dressing. We got grilled asparagus with romesco sauce--it was undersalted and the sauce did not really complement the asparagus. It wasn't the worst dish ever, but was nothing to write home about. Lastly, came the salmon, the thought of which still makes me queasy, a day later. It was a very thin piece of salmon, rather crispy on one side, with the crisp side having soaked up too much oil. It was served on a few spoonfuls of vegetables. This was $31. So disappointing. Marcus, where are you?

3.0,6/23/2018,A-Ok is exactly how I would describe this place. From what I hear its quite beloved but after my brunch experience I'm gonna have to say that it by no means lives up to the hype...though judging by a lot of these reviews that's not really a secret. We got reservations for Sunday brunch and maybe it's just our naïveté (it probably is) but we were not expecting a buffet nor were we expecting a gospel choir to descend upon us mid-brunch. They were extremely talented but it was deafening and I could not finish my Bloody Mary fast enough. It was pretty funny watching the unsuspecting Swedish tourists bob their heads and nervously clap along to a gospel choir from Harlem though. Obviously the chicken was good but honestly I can't even remember what else I ate and my grandma from the South could blow it outta the water. For $60/person before tip for a buffet brunch and a Bloody Mary I was expecting more.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯,0,0,0,Jamey G.,"Queens, NY",0,35,4

Or else they're gonna complained it's some wack chicken like fast food. This place told me it's a 45minutes wait.... my jaws dropped like Deadpool. I guess their chicken is drippin' juicy good. Just hit me up when you're ready. Let's go on to the food...Appetizers: Corn bread will make your date dance like you're in the club. She took that plate, and said ""it's mine!"" PG on this plate. Can't say no. I'm no loco.  $6 for this plate, I'll pay Benjamin for this without a doubt. Malcom Lox Toast got my taste buds yelling hot. It means nothing to ya'll. But my girl finished this like it's ice cream. I'm weak for spices. I'm sure their Salmon is wild since it tasted similar to Alaska King Salmon. For $9, I would like another piece of toast. Main: The yardbird for $27 you get a big piece of thigh (size matter) and white meat. It reminds me of Korean Fried chicken. But here their spices blend in with their slides of cabbage, and mashed potato w/gravy. Juicy licking good.The other main is their Blackened Catfish. I don't recommend this plate. It came out more dried. Juicy matters here. But the plate for $29, I'll probably get something else. If your lady loves chicken, called a reservation.

5.0,6/14/2018,"Thank you to the staff at Red Rooster for a 5 star experience. Red Rooster is one of those rare restaurants that you can pick up and put anywhere in the world and it would thrive. The fact that Chef Marcus Samuelsson chose Harlem is genius. After seeing Chef Marcus on several programs and after reading about his journey I knew I had to visit. I loved every minute of my experience. Restaurant Week afforded me the opportunity to try some items that everyone must try on their first visit to truly understand and appreciate what this experience was. Helga's Meatballs, Yard Bird, and the donuts all for $29! You can't go wrong. I also had the cornbread which was $6. The maple butter syrup needs to be sold at Whole Foods...its that good. The jam that accompanied the corn bread was so so good. Perfect combination. While Lauryn Hill's Ex Factor played in the background I enjoyed the meatballs. Excellent. Exactly as mentioned in all of the reviews.Yardbird with collards and a sweet potato purée. Just enough. My next visit will require a side of the collards. The chicken was perfectly cooked and while not a fan of dark meat this was excellent. And to top things off my donuts were presented for my upcoming Birthday which I casually mentioned to the waiter when we discussed this being my first time. How thoughtful and great presentation. Service was excellent. Equivalent to Mortons, Peter Lugers or any other 5 star experience you may have had. David was my waiter and he was outstanding. I can't say enough about the entire staff. I dined early and within minutes there were locals, tourists, single diners, and lovers who came in. The ambiance, the art, the decor was better than the food. The attention to detail is perfect. I'm so happy I came early to appreciate it all. I can certainly see why there would be a wait and airing outside in Harlem is divine you need to dine indoors to be visually stimulated during your visit. Even the restroom was gorgeous.

I felt that this restaurant delightfully combined flavors from Ethiopia as well as the American deep south. The service was pretty standard, but I loved the artistic aprons donned by servers.  We started with the Cornbread and I was impressed, although it was not groundbreaking. I was mostly impressed with the tomato jam!  For Entrees I ordered the Fried Chicken and it was really good. It exceeded my expectations because the flavors were quite complex, the chicken was slightly sweet, with notes of anise?, and a subtle spice/ pepper note. It was not plated the best, but it came with mashed potatoes (yum), delicious gravy, and tangy greens (which reminded me of collards I get at Ethiopian restaurants).  It was a wonderful experience and I appreciated the food we had, I would definitely dine here again.",2,1,3,Felice O.,"Noble Square, Chicago, IL",176,80,13

We paid $12 for a mimosa while we waited for our table. We were the first table in of the day and the bar was really sticky and already had things spilled on it. We over heard the bartenders talking about how mad the management was and the ""dumb talking to"" they got. We got to our table and I ordered an iced tea and it was awful and our table AND chairs were also sticky. Our server also took our order and never paid attention to us again. We were there for about an hour and a half but finished in less than 30 minutes. Ugly Things: They had a ""B"" health rating. Y'all can do better.

1.0,6/10/2018,"If you like paying $50 for possibly tainted food for two, this place is WORTH IT as featured on BuzzFeed.I can only describe my experience as absolute chaos. Came for brunch on Sunday and had to wait in line for fifteen minutes just to talk to the hostess. I was told the wait for two would be thirty to forty minutes, and they would text me when the table was ready.Forty minutes later, I'm back to check on the status of my promised table. There were two furious ladies in front of me who already had been kept waiting thirty minutes past their original reservation time. The hostess tries to look up how progress has been on my table, and can't find my name or number and just tells me to wait. About fifteen minutes later, my party is seated - leaving the two ladies, who had reservations before us, gaping in anger. There's no shortage of empty tables though; I guess they're using that Wall Street mentality of restricting supply so that the resulting demand resembles something out of The Purge.Waitress was friendly enough. We were told that there was no more lamb stew so the breakfast pie would be made with chorizo. This seemed like a rather poor substitution, so we got the duck hash and the yep chicken and waffles. I spent the rest of my meal reminiscing about all the other brunch places I'd ever gone to and how each of them, including IHOP and even taco Bell, did it better. The duck hash consisted of three slivers of very dry duck, about six pieces of fingerling potatoes, something so spicy that I'm feeling it in my stomach two hours as I write this review, some pickled onions, and two eggs that can only be described as cooked medium well. I kid you not, they managed to ruin eggs- not sunny side up, not cooked thoroughly, just this atrocious in between that feels like the world is a lie. Also if there had been any less duck in my dish, I could've sued them for false advertising... but I guess by putting in a Costco sample's worth of duck, they avoided that potential legal action. The chicken and waffles were also highly disappointing. The waffle had degranulated under the chicken and was a mushy mess that resembled baby puke if you'd been feeding your child straight beets. The chicken was literally just a chicken quarter slathered in Buffalo wild wings Asian zing sauce. To add insult to injury, apparently the kitchen hadn't even bothered cooking our chicken all the way through. Apologies for the rather disgusting picture, but after discovering a stream of blood coming out of the chicken, we dissected the rest of it apart to reveal that literally the chicken had not been cooked through at all. Oh yeah, and last thing - you can see the food preparation going on from the back window, and I highly recommend you take a good look to mentally  prepare you for any potential food sickness later on. While on my way to the bathroom, I saw a guy reaching into the metal food containers with his bare hands to sprinkle different components onto customer's food. This included the pickled onions for the duck hash, and sprinkling some type of herb on a chicken dish. Then he turned around and walked into the storage room, where chairs and other stuff are kept, and after a few minutes, came back in to continue throwing his skin cells onto people's food without washing his hands. Verdict: absolutely no organization, undercooked chicken, questionable sanitary practices, and ridiculously stingy portions (for the duck hash at least) - it's hard for me to believe a chef runs this place.

The staff was sharp and quick witted - not afraid of a little banter. And the food...off the hook! The soup of the day was a cold roasted corn soup and so good we started eating it before taking a picture. The Mac and Greens should be a meal in itself but is a side - soooo creamy and cheesy and the collards and crispy garlic topping (at least, I'm pretty sure it was garlic) put an already awesome classic over the top.But the best was the Fried Yardbird. The high quality of the chicken was clear from bite one. The warm spices (was that anise I tasted?) brought a comfort food to the level of bliss. We asked for a side of Rooster sauce - if you like hot sauce I suggest you do the same. Every bite was crispy on the outside, succulent on the inside.

The server although she was ok did not take our wine order in timely manner so it arrived after meal was served and was slow to refill. the food runners despite being polite missed the fact that asparagus was missing on two meals and forgot to provide utensils for our dinner so we were in awkward position of staring at our dinner. your back of the house manager checked on us and ""found "" the missing asparagus but didn't offer anything but an apology. plus we expected more from your food-it was inconsistent and made two of us sick.my aunt had to leave early and one of my sisters spent the day in bed nauseated all day today. plus your bartender would not acknowledge my sister so it took forever to close the tab at the bar.this was a very disappointing experience and it is very sad that we had to endure such a bad dining experience. you cannot give us our time back or the time we spent getting to your restaurant to and from brooklyn and you cannot make my sister or aunt feel better.

3.0,5/28/2018,"Review from 11/28/2016Visited Red Rooster on a Monday evening, and was surprised to see it as busy at it was. While we were technically able to get a table right away, the place was really buzzing with activity the whole evening (especially at the bar and at the live music area), so I'd surmise that almost any night you go, it's gonna be crowded.Wait staff is quite attentive here, so that was nice. Me and my friend each ordered one appetizer, and one side. For me, the chicken and waffle + collard greens. For him, the wings + side of corn bread.I felt like the chicken and waffle was roughly the size of a small entree, so I was surprised when I saw it, since it was in the appetizer section. The collard greens were pretty good... not too sour. As far as collard greens go, they were pretty nice. As for the wings, I tried those too, and they were decent. Probably nothing incredible, but not bad.The great thing about this place though is the energy, and the fact that they have live music. The food experience is pretty good, though it is quite expensive. However, if you want to visit a place on 125th that is fun, and has a charged atmosphere, I think this is the place to go.",4,1,8,Matt L.,"New York, NY",108,694,604
4.0,5/28/2018,"A Solid 4 Stars! Definitely a hot spot for Harlem locals. My boyfriend and I reserved a table for Thursday evening and we had an amazing time. We had a short wait while our outside table was being cleaned. The inside of the restaurant was beautiful. Very vibrant colors and Al Green playing in the background. Once our table was ready we ordered the cornbread and white sangrias. Both yum. We ordered the chicken and the ribs. Loved both. The spices and honey was such a unique twist on fried chicken. The bbq sauce on the ribs was also amazing and so tender. The ONLY reason I have to give this place a 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the sides. I wasn't impressed about the Mac & cheese, although it's the not classic Mac & cheese I am use to the greens included into the mac threw off the taste for myself. Also the ""sides"" that came with the chicken.. mash potatoes and cabbage? Both blah.. luckily the meat + drinks + vibes were enough for us to enjoy ourselves.

Cornbread was nice and moist without being greasy or heavy - it came with delicious whipped honey butter.

If you find yourself in Harlem it is well worth visiting. The lunch menu offered both a la carte options as well as a prix fixe lunch menu for $29. Since we had lunch only a couple hours ago I didn't think I could have a three course meal. I was torn between the Oh Boy! Cauliflower which was a miso glazed cauliflower and the Mr. Bojangles Lobster Roll. Thankfully I was with my sis who is my favourite person to share food with so we ordered both and shared. Both were fantastic! I especially loved that the lobster rolls were sliders and had a pickle and old bay potato chips in each one and the fries were fantastic.

They also must have used under-heated frying oil because the batter did not adhere well and was very greasy. The taste of the chicken was interesting, though, and I thought there was something like fennel or Chinese 5 spice in the batter--that was nice.

2.0,5/5/2018,"After much fanfare I decided to try the Red Rooster on a busy Friday night . I popped in with friends and were sat at a table . First let me say that the place is cute with outside and inside seating . The bar area precedes the eating area and the place was jumping with overflow of  agood  diversity of customers . There are no reservations needed so people line up at the hostess desk and they signal you through your smart phone when they have a table . The atmosphere is raucous and festive but the noise level was close to intolerable and you had to shout to speak with table-mates . With the outside temperature close to 90 the air conditioning inside was inadequate and made for an uncomfortable stay . I only wish that the food quality would make up for the shortcomings of the place . I was surprised at the skimpinessof the menu which is one page .  They don't  provide a bread basket , don't offer any soups and the desserts don't appear on the menu . Considering the chef's fame , the food offerings are uninspiring and simplistic . You're not going to get wowed by culinary excellence . A friend found the crab cakes merely acceptable and the rib entree wascharacterized by  inedible fat and grizzle ; clearly not a good cut of meat . All who ordered red meat were disappointed and much was returned uneaten . Another friend liked the blackened catfish . I played it safe and ordered the garlic mash potatoes and deviled eggs . Both were good . The wait staff tried hard to please but needs some training in table etiquette . A server handed me my plate over other people's heads , instead of walking to my side . That was just plain rude . In another instance , the server placed my utensils on the bare table instead of a napkin or plate . I wouldn't trust the cleanliness of a table top in a public place . By the end of our meal the noise level was soannoying that I was  eager to leave . Despite the jazziness and decorof any place , it's the food that one comes to enjoy most . If that  isunsatisfactory , then the place doesn't pass muster .",0,0,0,Gerard N.,"New York, NY",0,31,0
4.0,5/4/2018,"After watching the BuzzFeed Worth it episode on fried chicken, I had to give this place a try. It didn't hurt that its competitor in the Worth It video was literally a few shops up the street, so I could give them both a try and determine which one was really worth it in my opinion. I would definitely recommend making a reservation as it looked like this place was totally poppin'. We made a pretty last minute reservation and then actually ended up changing the time later on. The hostess was so accommodating despite being super busy, so I really appreciated their kindness with that situation. We also ended up actually getting seating before the actual time of our reservation which was a nice surprise. I went with four friends and we ordered the Bird Royale to share which came out to be $76. This meal came with a whole buttermilk fried chicken, mac & greens, red velvet waffle, hot honey, biscuits, pickles, & foie gras butter. This is on the ""it takes two"" menu, but it was plenty of food for the four of us (although we were all girls and we didn't come in super hungry, so that's something to consider). I felt like it was overall a huge amount of food though. The sides were all so delicious. The mac'n'cheese was gooey and cheesy and the biscuits were so soft and warm with the hot honey. In terms of the chicken, it wasn't dry at all and it was super tasty! It's not the traditional fried chicken skin that I was expecting, so that took me by surprise, but it was tasty in its own way. It's hard to describe, but it wasn't as crispy as I like my fried chicken and it was a lot more seasoned. Like I said, super good! But not what I was expecting. Oh! Also, when you order this meal, your chicken literally comes out of the kitchen with a flaming sparkler on top... LOOL So that was a surprise. Overall, I'd say definitely give this place a chance as the food was delicious and the overall experience was  good. Don't forget to make a reservation!",4,0,0,Dana L.,"Irvine, CA",430,94,74

We had the yard bird and the most delicious cornbread. I was SO obsessed with the sweet cream butter. I wish that I could have taken a block home and eat it with all things. The chicken was coated with just the right amount of seasoning. The mashed potatoes was a bit on the watery side and was way sweet, but everything worked together so beautifully. If you ate the mashed potato, greens, and chicken separately it would have been not as good, but together, it is truly perfect.

Orders taken quickly and food came out shortly after.No issues with orders placed by wife and son. Their food came out really quickly - plates were hot and food was really good!I ordered the Chicken and Biscuit entree. The plate was cold when the server set it down. The gravy had cooled significantly and the biscuits were hard and crumbly. The chicken was absolutely terrible by all standards. Most of the ""chicken"" was actually chicken skin. Lots of tendons/ligaments and bones.It legitimately looked like the chefs had taken scraps of chicken from previous diners, smashed it to form some kind of chicken base, then put it on a plate.I notified the server that the dish was terrible.

1.0,4/26/2018,"Seriously embarrassing, Samuelsson. Shame on me for going to a cheap celebrity chef moneymaker restaurant with sparklers in the chicken instead of a bonafide flagship. I only blame myself. This is a garish Harlem Applebees with the over the top decor, overly reduced salt and sugar laden food and cocktails. I live in a podunk southern town and I don't why I felt compelled to buy this horrible shit they called food when you can do much better on cornbread and, well, pretty much anything in the middle of nowhere. I had the salmon, was warned multiple times that it would be served medium, which it wasn't. I have made crispier skin myself in a cast iron, and I really can't describe the broth other than salt. It was just bad. I felt badly for the staff. Poorly managed. We were seated half an hour after our reservation time, and peope were greasing wheels to get in. Joke is on them.

I placed my order and it never came, and when I mentioned to the waitress, she just rolled her eyes and said she will take it off the bill.

3.0,4/21/2018,"I wasn't entirely happy with my experience here. I know the restaurant is owned by a celebrity chef. I've seen him on Chopped and he has such a lovable personality. Can't say I received the same warmth from his restaurant staff. So I made a reservation at 4:30 for 4. We go in a bit early and a Male worker tells me we should come back at 4:30. Um, okay? We come back at 4:30 and I tell him our entire party of 4 isn't here. He says he can't seat us till the 4th person isn't here. This person is known for being ridiculously late. So I tell him no, we want a table now without the 4th person. So he tells me that he's seating us for 3 and when the 4th person comes, they can't sit with us because that seat isn't available any longer? What??? I made a reservation for 4. I asked for 4. That person is running late. Why would that seat be revoked just because they're running late? 4th person comes and server seats her. Male worker comes back and makes a big deal of it. My friend talks to him saying that our server said it was okay. So apparently we're seated an a reservation only table and he had brought over another party of 2 to sit with us. It's a table that can fit 6. Why make a big deal about a person running late? The food was DELICIOUS. Wings were so juicy and flavorful. The mac and cheese was so creamy and hearty. The jerk chicken portion was massive. My chicken was blackened a bit much for my liking. But the flavor was spot on. The dessert we got was good but not worth $12. On to my next comment, WHY THE HELL IS EVERYTHING SO EXPENSIVE????? Yes everything was delicious, but why am I emptying out my wallet for a meal? So me and my friend get appetizers, other friend didn't. Our server not once asked us if we wanted everything out together at the same time or appetizers first then the entrees. So me and my friend are sitting there watching our food get cold while all of our stomachs are rumbling. No way would me and my friend start without the 3rd friend getting his food. So our server causally walks by after an hour asking if we want our entrees now. WHAT. THE. HELL. We waited an hour thinking that the rest of the food is coming out one by one. So we say yes we want the food. Right. Now. I shit you not, for the next 20 mins everyone ate in silence shoving their faces. The food was remarkable. But that's it. Prices are too high.

My only qualms with the place is that it is difficult to have a conversation when there is live music -the three times I've been there, it was deafeningly loud. My second issue is the fact that they crammed as many tables and chairs as they could into the space. If you're a plus sized woman like myself (size 18/20) or even larger, be prepared for small seats. And if you sit at the tables in the back, they're all pushed together and your arms are literally a couple inches away from the stranger's sitting next to you. Although I personally don't like coming here, my friends and family love it. Is it worth visiting at least once? Yes. They really do have excellent cooks behind the counter.

One last thing, the male hostess at Red Rooster turned us away like he was working at the hottest spot in Harlem.  This is absolutely not the case.  Check the Yelp reviews.  The food is average and their customer service is less than average because the customer is always wrong.  Please do yourself a favor and eat elsewhere.",2,0,0,David W.,"Toronto, Canada",0,15,13

The Uber ride from mid-town to Harlem was about $26 bucks...not bad but easily accessible via the subway as we learned for the $3 ride back.I'm gonna get the bad out of the way upfront as it's somewhat minor.  Our server (BR) was not very good outside of her great smile. She was mildly rude, not very informative, and just short in general with her style.  Her style did not represent the overall service as every single person we interacted with outside of her was phenomenal. The one other thing that bothered me was no free refills on iced tea.  Really?? Why?  It's water seasoned with a tea bag. This paired with our bad server left us.... thirsty. But on to the Good....which is really REALLY GOOD.Oh the ambiance.  Yes, yes and yes.  The walls, the scents, the people, the music.  5 STAR!!The flavorful food.  It's funny, because, the place is small in an intimate way.

I got the lamb shank which was served sizzling in a cast iron skillet and was really good. Mom liked her shrimp and grits enough. Brother thought the burger was okay. Girlfriend ordered the mushroom pasta and was not feeling it at all. Unappetizing texture and REALLY spicy. My daughter got the Yardbird.

I even called ahead of time to let them know it was my husband's birthday and to bring out the birthday desert for him. Let me not jump ahead..our waiter David F didn't seem to enthusiastic to serve us. I guess, we are not the desired color for this establishment. It took him over 15 minutes to get to us. Now the drink guy was awesome. He kept checking on us and even started to take our order. My husband put his order in..then it was time to put my order in. I asked to speak with our waiter because I am a vegan and I needed to try to figure out what was vegan on the menu. Anytime I go to a restaurant, I can make up something. Anyway, it took him long to come over because again he never wanted to wait on us in the first place. So David comes over and basically doesn't help me all. No empathy whatsoever. His answer was everything on the menu has butter. He goes away.I see somebody next to me with fries. Sheesh he could have suggested that or something. Not one suggestion. Throughout my husband's meal, he never came over and checked on us. The only person who came was the drink guy (nice guy with dreads and glasses). I own 2 retail stores...one in Harlem and Brooklyn.

1.0,4/8/2018,"I live in Harlem, am a former restaurant owner, and the Rooster has been a second kitchen for me for years even as the service has deteriorated over the last several, a problem we have always been willing to overlook because of the quality of the food. Yesterday, my wife and I went with friends who had also been there before. I have never experienced such an embarrassing and second-rate level of service. (The seating staff and bus people are great, however . . . very attentive, and we were seated right away.) We ordered salads and entrees to be split. Our dining partners ordered the Ol' Dirty Porcini Pasta, the folks at the table next to us having told us how good it was. After the salads, which were fine, we waited 50 minutes to get our entrees. Ours, the Taco Truck, was an overly greasy, overly cooked and overly sauced mess, but was presented okay and was filling at least. However, the dish ordered by our partners was cold. It took 10 minutes to get someone to return the item to the kitchen. No more than 60 seconds later, another dish masquerading as the one that was ordered showed up. It was warm, but was not prepared as expected and looked nothing like the entree that had been served to the neighboring table and had first showed up cold at ours. Our friends took a few bites and pronounced it barely edible. It took another 20 minutes before a person I believe to be the floor manager came over and asked how we were doing. He took away the dish without offering a replacement, or a glass of wine or even indicating that we would not be charged. Meanwhile, our waiter had no idea how the dish was supposed to have been prepared. Finally, our friends had to ask the floor manager to make sure we were not charged.

4.0,4/8/2018,"Just returned home from visiting New York, this was my son's first time there  and I wanted to make sure we made a visit to Harlem to see the Apollo.  While we were there we decided to take a chance and try to see if we could get a table at Red Rooster, we didn't have a reservation so we thought it was a long shot.  The hostess was very nice and told us it would be an hour wait, since we didn't have much to do we decided to wait, and lucky for us we did because a table opened up on about 20 minutes.  I love Marcus Samuelsson, I've watched him on The Food Network for years, so I was so excited to finally have an opportunity to try some of his food at the famous Red Rooster.  After looking at the the description I knew it said not good for kids, but we decided to try anyway, my son can be a picky eater so I hoped there would be some options for kids, there were several kids in the restaurant at the Time so I was hopeful, but no such luck, no kids menu or choices on the main menu.  Luckily my son decided to try the biscuits and gravy, which came with pulled fried chicken, a fried egg, and a small salad, he has an egg allergy so asked for no egg and they were able to accommodate.  We also ordered the corn bread appetizer, which comes with honey butter and tomato relish, the hot honey yard bird, the mac n collard greens and the Lenox brunch burger.Corn bread- very small portion (especially for the price, $6), not much flavor and I'm not a fan of adding corn to the corn bread mixMiss B's biscuits and gravy-  I took a sample and the gravy was very flavorful and the chicken was delicious.  The biscuits were on the doughy side and a little hard so not my favorite, but my son loved it so I have to give a star for that.The Lenox Brunch Burger- which comes with a fried egg, onion, avocado spread ( not stated in the description on the menu) cheese and bacon.  A member of my party ordered the burger well done ( he's a teenager so don't judge ) but the burger was done medium well and as stated it also had avocado, which he hates, they were nice enough to make a new burger and not included the avocado on the new burger.  I took a bit and the burger was juicy, even cooked well done, and a great size.Hot Honey Yard Bird-  definitely the star, the chicken was juicy, the skin was crispy and well seasoned and the portion was generous, half a chicken,  one negative, the garlic mashed potatoes included with the entree, they appeared to be mashed with both and not cream and they were lumpy, not smooth so they were not my favorite.  I actually asked to substitute the potatoes for the mac n collard greens, but I was told they don't substitute sides, another negative for me.Mac n collard greens-  very large portion, very cheesy, but having the collard greens added to the mac n cheese really didn't add anything to the dish so they were just ok.While the food was good and we enjoyed the experience for the price ( for a party of 4 our bill came to $135 before tip), having the lack of options for kids and not allowing substitutes for sides would make me rethink a return visit on my next trip. I can appreciate wanting dining out to be an adult experience for the dinner hour, but during lunch or brunch lots of people do have their children so it would be nice to have kid options or portions for them during those times.  All in all I can mark this off my New York bucket list.",2,1,1,Keisha S.,"Kennesaw, GA",6,8,6

5.0,4/7/2018,"On our last day in NYC we had a brunch reservation at Red Rooster. Our reservation was at 10 am which is when they open. We arrived a few minutes early and thought we had to stay out in the rain till they open ... but to our surprise they had the doors open for people to walk in and sit in the bar area till the staff was done with their morning meeting and it was time for restaurant to operate. I thought this created a friendly, family like environment and it was nice that we didn't have to stay out in the rain! I have to say that the food is pricey but then again it's the price to pay when there's a celebrity chef involved! I've watched Marcus Samuelsson on food network for years now and I appreciate his art so I was game! The ambiance is different than any other place I've been too, from having a band in the bar area to the staff dressing super casually but with intent and the friendly welcome from the manager. The semi open kitchen gives a sense of excitement to someone waiting for their food. We ordered the deviled eggs for appetizer, and for main we got the chicken and waffle, shrimp and grits and Miss B's biscuit and gravy. The best deviled eggs I've had in my entire life! It was so light and fluffy and the crispy duck and onion jam added a nice sweet and salty flavor and crunch to each bite, a definite winner. The chicken and waffle was to die for! Super juicy, tender, crispy and flavorful chicken leg with good waffle and that hot honey chili sauce had me going crazy. I'm not a big fan of grits but this was some good grits! Also they did not skimp on the shrimp! The churrizo added an amazing flavor to the stew and the okra was a unexpected twist in the whole thing. What can I say about the biscuit and gravy?!!!!

2.0,3/29/2018,"So I decided to venture again into Harlem for some soul food (tried Sylvia's the night before) and give red rooster a go. The place was more upscale/ ""bougie"" than Sylvia's (family, warm). We ordered Devil eggs, cornbread (not complimentary), mac n cheese and the Yardbird. The devil eggs were 6.5/10 not much to complain but also nothing special. The cornbread at Sylvia's was by far more superior and they were complimentary! The mac and cheese was 1/10, it just didn't taste good. (We barely touched it and had it to go, gave it to a homeless person down the street.) Finally, the Yardbird. The flavour was good, and the crunch was there. However, the breast meat was dry and rough (just like popeyes or kfc). The best part were the mash and greens that came with it. The service was also slow. Trust me when I say this, walk other 10 steps and just go to Sylvia's. The OG just does it better in every way; better food, better service, better atmosphere.

The lead singer even came up to our table and sang to my friend, who was celebrating a birthday and was the reason for our visit. It's in the heart of Harlem, so a good area to walk around (and walk off some of that food you just ate) and explore.

They were good, but it would have been better if they charged us a little more and served it with white meat. A leg and thigh hardly gives off enough meet to eat with the waffle. We also ordered the cauliflower. It took forever and it was terrible. We sent it back. It tasted boiled and we didn't like the flavor at all. Would not recommend the cauliflower. Lastly, we got the shrimp and grits, by far, the best thing we ate. Delicious. One other thing to be aware of. I ordered an ice tea. I got two refills and got charged for all 3 glasses of tea. My ice tea bill was $14.50. Personally I think that it's tacky and low class to charge for every ice tea. Especially because no one else on earth does.",1,0,0,Gina S.,"Pasadena, CA",3,142,6

3.0,3/21/2018,"I was really craving some fried chicken and was recommended by some friends to come here. I had actually heard of Red Rooster from the Buzzfeed Worth It series, and despite a few lackluster reviews on Yelp, I still decided to.give it a shot.The prix fixe lunch menu is pretty good. For $29 you get a soup or salad, a choice from 3 entrees, and the cupcake of the day. I went with the house salad and the fried yardbird (of course). The salad was pretty good. Some kale, arugula, toasted chickpeas and cashews. It was pretty flavorful but also kind of oily and salty. The main course was, of course, the fried chicken. It was just one whole chicken wing, served on top of some mashed potatoes and cabbage. The fried chicken was really good. Super crispy skin, yet still tender and juicy on the inside. There was a nice touch of honey on the outside, which was great. The red cabbage was also extremely tender. The mashed potatoes were whipped to perfection, and the gravy was not a traditional beef gravy. It was sweeter, and I don't really know how else to describe it. It was really good.That's all that was good to the meal, however. The cornbread we ordered separately was dry and flavorless. The cupcake at the end was also tough and dry. They tried to save it with massive amounts of cream, both on top and in the middle, but it just did not work for me. The atmosphere is spacious and the service was really, really friendly. Definitely props to the waitress we got. The price of a regular fried chicken is $24, so it seems to be more cost effective to get the three courses. However, I didn't really feel like the salad or the dessert added much for me, so I would get just the chicken if I were to come back. With that said, however, I would rather check out other fried chicken joints before coming back here.",6,3,2,Austin T.,"Bellevue, WA",200,425,341

2.0,3/20/2018,"I have a lot of respect for chef Marcus Samuelsson and what he's brought to Harlem but unfortunately my expectations for my first dining experience at Red Rooster were definitely not met. My boyfriend and I came to the restaurant a little before lunchtime on a busy Saturday and decided to sit at the bar for faster service. The service was good and the food came out fast. But by that I mean a little too fast, like under five minutes... I questioned whether they just heated up some food or prepped the food way ahead of time. We shared an order of cornbread, which came with honey butter and tomato sauce, and we ordered the hot honey yardbird. I heard so much raves about the cornbread, but the version we got wasn't moist at all. For the yardbird, I pretty much only enjoyed the gravy and greens it came with. The skin was crispy, but the meat was rather dry. For a whopping $27 for two small pieces of chicken, I expected something way more juicy and tasty. I hope something can be done to ensure better and more consistent food quality.",4,1,1,Mary T.,"Washington, DC",391,110,425
2.0,3/19/2018,"I have to agree with ratings and say completely Over-rated and unsatisfying ... My boyfriend and I walked in on a Sunday right after the brunch service was over ... The host tells us the kitchen will reopen for dinner service in about an hour ... So go to the bar to kill time ... Drinks were okay ... Deviled Eggs were great ... Mac and Greens were dry and pretty bland, nothing out of your ordinary. After about 45 mins I walk up to the host to ask if she needed my name to be seated once the kitchen reopens, as a lot of people started coming in.... She then tells me there's no tables available and we wouldn't be able to get a table .... Horrible customer service if you ask me !....  You couldn't tell me this 45 minutes ago when we first walked in. Extremely irritated when your hungry and  the bar only has about 5 appetizers to order.  We decide to order chicken & waffles at the bar (our only seating option after 45 minutes) ...

5.0,3/18/2018,"A friend once casually remarked that Red Rooster is the best fried chicken in New York. Challenge accepted!  The first thing about Red Rooster is that it's always packed. I could only get a reservation for 4:30pm. But the bar was already packed, there was a line waiting at the door, and we could feel the heat coming from the kitchen. The atmosphere was lively, and they were playing Motown hits set to a modern beat. And because of our reservation, we were ushered to our seats quickly, and drink orders were taken promptly. The dining area is a little cramped, but I think it just adds to the intimacy of the environment. We started off with deviled eggs and the chicken and waffles appetizer.  The deviled eggs were creamy, tangy, and superb. The chicken was a tad spicy, with crispy skin and juicy meat on top of a waffle that was a little soggy, but served as a nice launching pad for some delicious chicken. I had the fried chicken dinner and was amazed at how crispy the skin was and how evenly cooked and moist the meat was underneath the skin. Even the white meat was moist. How did they do it? In addition to being spicy, the skin tasted of pepper, salt, and other earthy spices -- a perfect combination. It was served with some collard greens, flavorful but not salty, with crispy bits of real bacon, and a puddle of ""dirty gravy"" which is a dark gravy with bits of meat sprinkled in. There was also a serving of real mashed potatoes, buttery and light. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I couldn't finish it. The food was so rich and there was so much of it, I lifted my head to offer my son a drumstick, and he was polishing off his ribs and licking his fingers. Without asking anything, he responded, ""can this get any better?"" I traded my drumstick for a rib, and the meat literally fell off the bone and melted in my mouth. The sauce was tangy but not too sweet and it paired well with his pickled veggies. The photos and decor evoked the days of the Harlem Renaissance and I could feel myself transported to a time when no one would think twice about such rich food. But the biggest surprise was the cornbread. The first thing you'll notice is that it looks more like thick Texas toast rather than a square of dry, mealy pone. Then you'll be amazed at how heavy each slice is - like a brick!  And after taking your first bite and tasting the real pieces of corn in the bread, you might think it's heavy because there must be a pound of butter in each slice. I'm not sure you'd be wrong, but it was the richest, smoothest, tastiest piece of cornbread that I've ever had. Our waiter came over and said ""I think you might be done given your posture"" and we realized we were all sitting back holding our bellies. Was my friend correct?  Absolutely - but then again, I'm not sure that I've tried all the fried chicken in New York City. So until someone turns me on to anything better, I can safely say Red Rooster has the best fried chicken (and ribs, and deviled eggs) in NYC. And definitely the best cornbread in the world!",0,0,0,Paul J.,"Bethesda, MD",7,123,0

My worst nightmare came true when I took a bite into the drumstick and discovered raw blood. I immediately spit out the chicken at the bar and called for the manager. A few minutes later the Asian female manager arrived to address our issue. I explained to her that the chicken was raw and filled with blood. She quickly told me in defense that no one had gotten sick in two years. So she took the remains of the chicken to the chef. He told her that a vessel broke and there was nothing to worry about. I told her that the chef cannot assure me that I would not get sick, nor can the chef give me medical advice. I must truly say the manager did a spectacular job defending the red rooster and attacking the customer as if we were guilty. In the end Red Rooster offered a couple pieces of cornbread and a small dessert for a completely horrible and traumatizing experience. The bartender also offered me a drink on the house and ended up charging it to the bill. I feel that the correct course of action should have been a complete waiver of our bill.

2.0,2/11/2018,"I decided to come here after seeing this restaurant featured on one of Buzzfeed's worth it videos for fried chicken in NYC. I'm not sure how Red Rooster ended up winning because this was totally NOT worth it. First off, the music is way too loud. It makes for a very unpleasant atmosphere. In order to talk to your friends/date or even to the waiter to order your food, you have to basically shout at each other for the other person to hear you. Otherwise you are sitting there quietly and scoffing down your food so you can hurry up and leave to give your ears a break. Also, even though we had a reservation, we had to wait about 20 minutes before we were seated. Now the main reason we came was for the fried chicken so we both ordered the hot honey yardbird ($27). It came with garlic mash and cabbage. I tried the dark meat thigh/leg first. Normally, you would expect this piece to be juicy but certain parts were dry. It must have been over cooked but it wasn't too terrible. When I went on to eating the white meat, the whole piece was so dry that I didn't finish it. The hot honey on top was not spicy at all, it just tasted like honey. $27 for dry chicken? To be honest, for the ambiance, price and quality, I rather have Popeyes.",10,7,1,Connie T.,"New York, NY",281,129,308
4.0,2/11/2018,"Red Rooster is a nice brunch hub on 125th Street. Make sure to make a reservation. The bar area is a comfortable place to grab a cocktail or two if you're waiting for your party to arrive. They also have a small but good draft list, with a strong leaning toward locals. 5 Boroughs IPA was on offer, which I happily quaffed for the duration of my meal.The menu is definitely one of the better ones you'll see, with a nod to southern fried cooking. We started with cornbread, which was probably the most memorable part of the meal. It was hot, wholesome, and melted in your mouth, very much unlikely standard cornbread or hush puppies. The chicken dishes are outstanding, though orverpriced due to the celebrity factor. My shrimp and grits was spot on, with perfectly cooked, soft grits. We had three kids in our party and they were satisfied with their thick french toast--a feat not easy to pull off.Service was pretty good for such a busy brunchery. Halfway through our meal a singer swept through the room, serenading us and selling CDs.

Catfish was great--perfectly seasoned and cooked, and I liked the bed of broken rice and wilted greens. Ribs, I think, were a bit overly sweet but not to the extent that I didn't enjoy eating them.

1.0,2/4/2018,"Now let me preface - my friend and I were catching up for a girls brunch and some QT. My gripe isn't necessarily with the staff, as it's their job to be courteous and ensure that patrons are having a good time. But we must've had every single busboy come to our table to refill our water or ask us if we need anything. It actually took away from my friend and I being able to have a conversation. Then, someone who I can only presume to be the Manager comes to my friend and I and says that essentially our time is up and they have another party waiting for our table. Cue the looking around at empty tables and booths, and no line at the maitre d' OR bar. This to me, makes me think that perhaps all the busboys asking us if we needed anything else was because they were trying to push us out. Now mind you, it's not as if we had paid the bill and was sitting there idle. My friend still had her entree on the table and we didn't yet have the complimentary cupcake that they served us mid-meal. Then there's the bill which comes with a charge for still water. This would've been fine, had the busboy/waiter asked ""Sparkling, still or tap?"" at the very beginning, to which we would've said that tap is fine. We answered with still which came in an already opened bottle, so understandably so - we assumed this was in fact tap water. When we approached the Manager with this miscommunication, she then 'educates' us that at this establishment, they charge for still water. Yes, I'm aware. I'm not some gutter rat who's never been out to eat before. At most restaurants however, the still water comes sealed and is opened at your table so you know it's in fact, a bottle you're purchasing. The food isn't bad, but everything made it unenjoyable and not an experience I'd like to partake in again.",4,4,1,Stephanie M.,"Brooklyn, NY",132,52,99

I frequently had to look around and STICK MY HAND UP for my server and I cannot begin to tell you how long it took for me to get my plates cleared. I pride myself on patronizing black and brown businesses especially and I expected more from a reputable establishment. Everything just took forever and not in a crowded way but in an I have other people to tend to kind of way. Getting a drink too forever even after I was told hold on by the bartender and STILL received no drink. Saw this lady in the yellow coat touching tables and was ignored when I motioned repeatedly that I needed someone ANYONE really. The HOST  do NOT get me started she's literally the worst. Like either be a complete bitch or be happy the fake awkward in between isn't working. The food was amazing and promt everything else could use a thorough look over.Okay sooooo.... I went back to Red Rooster for NYE.... Sooo they had EVERYONE crammed in the front area INCLUDING those who had purchased a ticket for the event they were sectioning off. I understand needing to get ready and maybe not wanting the artist to wade through the crowd but.... it just could've been executed better. For instance the artist had security they could've accompanied them, or at the very least you could've utilized EVERY employee to create a path for them. Either way it made for a drunk and fussy crowd. The evening was overall a success mixed crowd. AGAIN the bartenders while moving quite quickly I saw a number of patrons looking to each other like will we EVER be served and I felt them. It limited the number of beverages I purchased  by two at least for sure. Now I will say the experience downstairs was completely different. The bartender was attentive and prompt with drinks. The (in house I believe ) DJ was banging and the manager that night was touching tables greeting guests like no ones business. I guess they can handle smaller groups better or maybe everyone was just happy they weren't crammed in that itty bitty space idk. Either way a few more hands on deck wouldn't hurt.WITH ALLLLLL THAT I am raising my three starts to four. I do enjoy the atmosphere here sincerely and the food IS amazing while the drinks ARE strong.

But the drink straight tasted like hot sauce, it wasn't your typical Mexican michelada. The amount of beer also didn't do much for me and I had gone there at 10 am for brunch, empty stomached. So I got another drink that was a pretty orange gradient.  Honestly, still empty stomached and a second drink still didn't do anything to me and I'm a small person at 4'11 and thin.

Juicy chicken with lots of flavor. Garlic mashed potatoes and pickled cabbage were great accompaniments. Had a side of the mac and greens, which was one of the best i've ever had!

Crab cakes were also unexpectedly tasty; generous amount with plenty of crab and was paired with a creamy sauce and tart tomatoes. Biscuit soup was flavorful and creamy but over salted while the salad was underdressed. On to the main event: the chicken was good not great and it was quite a measly portion, even for being part of a prix fixe. Quite tender and juicy but the highly touted hot honey sauce was skimped on - I could taste a mild sweet flavor but not much heat. Braised cabbage was alright, mashed potatoes were good.

1.0,1/15/2018,"Sat at the bar by myself, ordered soup and half sandwich entree. Waited 45 minutes while everyone around me who sat and ordered after me all got their food. In the meantime I ordered 2 beers and about half through my second beer the same bartender I ordered my food from asks if I'd like anything to eat! Then I reminded her I had already ordered. She remembers and says she'll talk to a manager. 5 minutes later food came, no manager, and no apology.  I assumed one beer or something would be comped for my extensive wait for just a soup and half sandwich. Nothing, and still not even an apology. And before I could even sign my check, the bartender snatched the pen away to give to someone else. Seriously??!!  Seemed like it was amateur hour.

I did the fixed price 3-course menu. My selections were kale salad, mac and greens, and the only dessert choice was donuts. Things started off well as the salad was delicious, but the entree was just mac and cheese -- I thought there'd be more ""greens"" / substance. The donuts were heavy and did not seem restaurant made.

2.0,1/9/2018,"I honestly question if the BuzzFeed staff can be trusted to judge food after trying this. I planned my entire weekend trip around going to this restaurant. Staff wasn't very nice, but it was dinner time on a Saturday so I assumed someone had already tested their patience.Pros: the side dishes are all amazing. Genuinely loved them all. So did my mother in law and husband.Chicken and Waffles. MIL got it as her dish instead of a meal, she doesn't eat big portions, and she loved it. We took a small bite to taste and it was very flavorful. Waffle was very fluffy.They don't cheat you on the alcohol content of your drinks. I ordered the Tortuga Punch. Two of those bad boys will have you smiling.Cons: I did not realize it at the time but there was apparently supposed to be some sort of honey drizzle on our chicken that we did not receive. What we ate was by far the blandest fried chicken that has ever been conceived. Not a pinch of salt touched that meat. Maybe not even black pepper. The chicken was cooked beautifully but it just tasted so sad. Music was absolutely too loud to hear anyone speak unless they were in your face or yelling.Tables are very small. Almost no space for food and drinks to fit. There were only 3 of us at the table, so just IMAGINE if we had been 4.The price is excessive. I've had dishes at similar style venues that tasted better, came with bigger side portions and were significantly cheaper.I won't be going again.

The food: the best thing we ordered was the shrimp and grits. We split it as an appetizer and it was a great choice. I don't always like grits and I liked those grits. Definitely order the shrimp and grits if you attend this restaurant. I also LOVED the Brussels sprouts.. even more than the Mac and cheese!! We also ordered the flaming bird. It's cool because it comes out with fire on top and it's great for a snap story or Insta but I felt like the chicken needed a sauce or honey.  It came with Mac and cheese, which I have no complaints about, and biscuits, which would have been better if they came out hot. Having been to the south many times, a cold biscuit is disappointing. Overall, I liked everything but it was too loud and pricey.  Would come back if friends wanted to go but otherwise I don't think I would make the adventure up to Harlem.",0,0,0,Marlee S.,"Queens, New York, NY",609,15,19

2.0,1/1/2018,"This review is painful to write because we are huge Marcus Samuelsson fans. We went to Harlem just to try his food. The experience was mixed. The kitchen's execution of the menu was inconsistent and the service was poor. The Glogg, his own mulled wine recipe was great. It was full of fruits and nuts and it was delicious. One person in our party waited over a half an hour at the bar for his drink. The bartender was great at putting on a show but not at getting things done. Our party of four was seated in the bar at a table for six. After we ordered, two beautiful women from Harlem were also seated at the table. While it was awesome to meet them, it made it impossible for the wait staff to reach us to deliver food or clear. We had to help them, it was just too cramped and uncomfortable. We tried the cornbread, crab cakes, Mac & greens, biscuits and gravy soup, the fried yardbird, and the shrimp and grits. The cornbread and crab cakes were great. The Mac and greens had no greens, others who ordered it were also looking for greens. The Mac & cheese aficionado at our table thought it was great without greens. The major disappointment was the soup. The four servings came out of the kitchen at different times and they were inconsistent. One was thick, some were runny and white. The last one that came to the table was cold. The yardbird was heavenly and the shrimp & grits were good. We ended with the doughnuts which were too dry to finish.

From the beginning though, the overall experience here needs some work. The service up front was very rude and they were just disorganized. I saw yelpers with similar experiences so I know I'm not alone, but all of us with reservations after 7 were still waiting 15-20 minutes after our time. This more than likely stems from the fact that they don't do a great job of portioning out your orders with long waits in between apps and entrees. I chalk this up to management gaps.Now to the food, which I actually thought was great. The corn bread and deviled eggs to start were phenomenal and we also ordered the crab cakes which had great flavor. For our entree we ordered the yar bird which I thought had really unique and delicious spices in the breading.

2.0,12/26/2017,"I came to Red Rooster expecting to be impressed.I first found out about Red Rooster on Buzzfeed's Worth It Series, where it promoted itself as a fresh take on comfort southern food. A prime example of classic southern soul food happens to be Sylvia's Restaurant which is on the next block over. Being a big fan of Sylvia's, I was certainly looking forward to seeing what Red Rooster had to offer.Atmosphere- It felt as if everything was incredibly crowded. From the decorations on the walls to the manner the tables were set up, I struggled to find it pleasing to the eye and not feel claustrophobic. Great energy though.Service- Perfect. Everyone was incredibly courteous. Bartender up front was pretty cool.Now on to the food, what really matters-I ordered the Fried Yardbird along with the Baby Kale Salad, Donuts and Cornbread. I will start with the cornbread because that's what came out first. Cornbread is pretty hard to mess up. A simple warm cornbread with sweet butter is always tasty. I can't call Red Rooster's cornbread genuine. It's almost a combination of french toast & cornbread. I certainly see the potential for such a dish, but this certainly isn't it, I struggled to finish it. The Baby Kale Salad didn't stand out in any way, I could've made some at home. The Chicken- This is where I expected to be blown away. At first glance the Yardbird was much smaller than I expected. It came on bed of mashed potatoes and braised cabbage. At first bite it certainly had great crunch and texture. The chicken meat itself was juicy throughout. Taste wise, the Yardbird struggles to stand out. All of the different flavors just don't compliment one another. It's as if they are all fighting one another, a battle which my taste buds were not fond of. Nothing else stood out.Every restaurant should have that one reason as to why you'll be back. Red Rooster didn't have it for me.",5,0,0,Bruno T.,"White Plains, NY",213,6,4

They were pretty much winging it and although the songstress was lovely I should have stayed upstairs especially when there was a $20 cover charge. Now to the environment, it was pretty dark so you could not see your menu or food many patrons were using their phone's flashlight to see both. Eating in the dark is not delightful. Now to the food that I have been hearing about... tonight was an off night. First I am very sensitive to smells and the area smelled like a sour dirty mop smell near the bar and dissipated as you got acclimated or when I was seated not sure. The table was sticky which is s NO NO. The appetizers: Crab cake was delicious and mussels were extremely small in size and difficult to enjoy due to the light situation. The meal was not good. Jerk chicken lacked seasoning, lamb was not enjoyable, mac and greens were not tender a bit more than al dente. Drinks were so so.

4.0,12/18/2017,"I can't not be a fan especially when THE Marcus Samuelsson comes out at the same time as your dessert and wishes you a ""Happy Birthday."" THAT was magical.So we first saw and heard of this place through the Buzzfeed Worth It series on fried chicken. It seemed like just the type of place that I would want to try.When we arrived there were already a lot of people at the bar and in the restaurant in general. Luckily, my husband had made a reservation so we were able to get seated right away. The food:We ordered the fried chicken and waffles appetizer, the hot honey yardbird, as well as a side of cornbread and mac & greens. We both really liked the chicken and waffles app. The chicken was a small drum and thigh, hot and juicy and covered in a hot/buffalo-esque sauce, topped with pickles and pickled onions. All of this was on top of a sweet half waffle. I'm not sure if the batter for the waffle was sweet to begin with or if they soaked some syrup into the waffle, but it was sweet and not soggy. The cornbread was like two slices of a loaf, not too sweet, but a little more moist than most corn breads with pieces of corn in it as well. It is served with a sweet honey butter and tomato jam. The sauces were pretty tasty as well as the bread, but I don't think I will order that again.The hot honey yardbird was also delicious- crispy, juicy and flavorful (2 drums, 2 thighs or wings... not sure, but they were pretty small) atop braised cabbage, garlic mash and gravy, and drizzled with honey. I think it is a bit overpriced and I was expecting it to have more of a kick than it did like the appetizer. It was a pretty sweet dish and I wish there was more of a spicy element to balance it all out. Everything on the plate was delicious though. For dessert, we got the Harlem Geisha tart, the lemon-yuzu curd with the toasted meringue was the perfect balance of sweet, creamy and tart. It was supposed to be on a matcha sponge.. but I didn't taste matcha at all and whatever sponge was on there was a bit crumbly and really dry. The atmosphere and service:I love the vibe of this place. It felt almost like being transported back to the disco/R&B era and even a little jazz bar-like. It was very cool and a bit homey. The staff were all nice and there were a lot of people walking around filling glasses and taking away unwanted plates. Our waitress, Petra, was super nice and genuinely seemed happy to be there and be our server. She made me smile the moment that she greeted us. On yelp, it says that the noise level is moderate, but I would say that it's pretty loud. There are a lot of people in the bar area, the music is pretty loud and a lot of people in the dining area. Our table wasn't very large, but it was very hard to hear my husband and have a conversation without raising my voice a bit. All in all, the food was good, a little overpriced, but well-made, the atmosphere cool and laid back, but a little loud, the service, attentive and warm, and with the chance of meeting Marcus Samuelsson, I would definitely go here again!",0,0,1,Jane C.,"Manhattan, NY",301,91,127

Our party of 3 was seated at a table which you share with other guests aka strangers. I am not a fan of this type of seating since it can be ""too close for comfort.""  It would have been appreciated had upon booking the reservation, this type of seating was mentioned.  I was seated at the head of the table, where there was a lot of foot traffic behind me. When I asked the hostess if I could switch seating, she gave a curt ""no.""  I was not upset at what she said, but how she said it.  Needless to say, the people who did sit next to us were pleasant. I could not imagine, if otherwise.  More importantly, the food was amazing. We shared appetizers - cornbread and crab cakes.  I had the jerk chicken as my entree. It was seasoned perfectly, spicy but not too spicy.  Upon ordering, we were told they were out of one of the appetizers which was okay but then later, more of the dessert dishes were unavailable, too.

2.0,12/14/2017,"My friend and I, both being first time guests, came to the Red Rooster with very high expectations given the credentials of the owner. I was utterly disappointed to say the least. Upon arrival we were both greeted with a smile and did not wait long for our reserved table.   We were provided water and then the wait began. 15 min later our drink and appetizer orders were taken; the restaurant was all out of mussels, so we needed another minute to decide, which one would think our drinks would have come? No, we did not receive our 1ST DRINK until AFTER receiving our dinner. Two things: any good establishment would notify the wait stuff what they are out of so that the customer can be given a heads up; do not make me wait 15 min to take my appetizer order to find out that you're out. Also, receiving drinks AFTER dinner has been provided is simply ridiculous. On to the food....My friend and I do not eat pork but really wanted the catfish; we were told they do not do substitution but we could BUY another side dish???? Really? So everyone eats pork? No they do not, please allow substitutions. She ended up getting the catfish and ordered Brussel sprouts, I got the yardbird....big mistake. The chicken came to the table lukewarm and the skin was very battery, did not taste fresh at all. I had a plate full of honey that instead of being a garnish, was the staple of the plate. Another fail.  Let's get back to drinks and service......I waited patiently for our waitress to come check on us...did Not happen, and yes I still had my first drink glass, bone dry. I finally stopped our waitress and asked for another drink. My drink again took a very long time to receive and at this point I was done. Funny thing is the two groups that the owner stopped to see were very well taken care of and accommodated. Interesting. Basically I could have spent $150 elsewhere and in the future I will.  Goes to show that being owned by someone famous does not mean good service.",4,1,1,Paul T.,"Cincinnati, OH",3,3,1

Red Rooster is passable-ish. The pros: Our waiter was very nice. The Mac n Greens appetizer is pretty good, although a bit too salty. The sweet mash and collards sides were very tasty, and had that Moroccan spin that I think I heard mentioned in the Buzzfeed feature. Atmosphere is super hip looking. The cons: While the food wasn't bad, this place DOES NOT live up to the hype!  It was not worth the hour-long wait and snooty seating policy (even with a reservation), the crowds, and shady bartender who told me and my party that they were ""out of"" a specific cocktail we wanted to try while we waited, only to get to our table and order the same thing without a problem. How can you act that way to customers when you're a male bartender wearing a giant rhinestone necklace, non-ironically? We also tried the (signature?) Hot Honey Yardbird dish...meh. Not bad, but the chicken wasn't anything to write home about. And there was barely any Hot Honey sauce on it, which kinda makes the whole dish. I would go back here, but only during downtimes.

Once we were all there we were told to wait there wasn't a table ready yet so I'm not sure why they kept acting we were going to lose our reservation when there wasn't even a table ready. Then once we were seated we were threatened with the fact that the kitchen closes at 3pm. Thanks.We of course got the yardbird. This is tasty but not $27 tasty. Two pieces of chicken and some sides for that price is crazy. Cornbread was ok. One piece of chicken and a waffle for $17 seemed overpriced too.

1.0,11/21/2017,"Stopped in w/ a friend Sunday nite 11/19 to listen to some live music & a grab drink. I ordered a prosecco, my friend ordered a rooster royale, I paid $25 cash and thought we could chill... My prosecco taste awful like perfumey- after one sip I asked the waiter to confirm what he gave me and he stated ""its a new champagne we're serving"".  I reminded him that I ordered a prosecco and to that he responded  condescendingly that he was doing me a favor by ""hooking me up"" with champagne which was "" better"" than prosecco. At that point he engaged a debate with me when I complained about being served something other than what I ordered. He insisted that he did me a favor upgrading my prosecco to champagne. My argument remained the same, serve me what I paid for & don't try to deceive me, bc clearly the champagne he served me was not good which is why I immediately noticed the bad taste. So when I demanded he serve me prosecco liked I ordered that's when he said they were out. So I asked to see the bottle of champagne he served me & it was some generic Brut you can buy in CVS or a supermarket. He tried to defend the BS saying they are all the same, which is not true. Furthermore, prosecco, cava & champagne are all listed on the menu separately at different prices- bc they are not the same. He didn't have prosecco & thought he could pass off a cheap champagne & I wouldn't know the difference. But any sparkling wine drinker knows an inexpensive champagne is far less pleasant to drink than an equal or average priced prosecco.  You really can't go wrong with a prosecco, the taste is similar regardless of the price but a cheap champagne will never taste as good as any prosecco or more expensive champagne.  If the bar was out of prosecco he should've told me that not try to deceive me with some cheap nasty champagne & try to convince me it was the same. He denied me the right to choose what I consume bc if he were honest about not having prosecco, I would've ordered something different. And he didn't substitute my prosecco order by giving me the champagne they sell for $19 per glass, he gave me the cheapest bottom champagne they had bc he didn't think I'd know any better.  They should be ashamed of themselves for even having that nasty azz champagne at all! Anyway, I was so heated I had to leave bf I started breaking up some bottles at the bar & get arrested. My friend only got to have one sip of her drink bf the drama popped off , so neither one of us were able to enjoy the drink I paid for. I didn't even bother to ask for my money or anything I just walked out bf I got violent bc what I wanted to do was hurt something. I did go back to speak with mgmt bc I want my refund, I also sent an email to someone named CASEY LEGLER, she was supposed to call me back over an hour ago, I'm still waiting and getting very pissed.

I ordered the yardbird (fried chicken) which was very disappointing. The flavor of the chicken was bland; I would have rather gotten some Popeyes chicken. It came with mashed sweet potatoes but it was very little smeared on the plate topped with a few greens. Not at all what I was expecting for $30. My boyfriend ordered the ribs which were better flavored but still just mediocre. Plus it only came with about 4-5 small ribs and no sides. Again not what I was expecting for $30.

The hostess quoted us a wait time of about an hour and a half and said we would not be guaranteed a spot since the restaurant was closing at 3. Luckily, we were able to find a spot at the bar. The bartender was very to the point and you had to be a little persistent to get attention but I could totally see why. The bar was full and there was people vulturing around waiting to get a seat.  My friend and I ordered the cornbread for our appetizer. It was light and tasty. It came with butter and some sort of salsa. The salsa kinda threw me off but it actually turned out to mesh really well with the cornbread. For our entrees we ordered the yardbird and the shrimp and grits. Both were delicious. The yardbird was both crispy and tender. It definitely was sweeter than it was hotter. Now I came for the fried chicken but in my opinion the shrimp and grits were the star of the meal. The dish was dynamic, packed with flavor and didn't feel forced. By that I mean it had a lot going on but it all worked together. If you go I would highly recommend it. Overall, a fun experience! I did see that during the week they have a lunch special where you can order a preset menu where you choose one app, one entree, and one dessert for $25.

But beware, after a while the spice builds and it becomes very spicy. -Corn Bread - MUST get. Super delicious with actual corn in the bread. Also, that whipped butter is so delicious! -Honey Honey Yard bird - You should definitely get this if its your first time here. Its one piece of white meat and one piece of dark meat. I loved the side of pickles that it came. My friends enjoyed the collard greens that it came with. -Roasted Brussels sprouts - We needed some veggies and got this. Did not disappoint but also a little heavy for a veggie dish. It had cheese and garlic aioli on top .",1,0,1,Sara Y.,"New York, NY",65,161,88

4.0,11/9/2017,"Red rooster is an extremely loud, but fun restaurant to have dinner. The service is friendly, but not very attentive. Appetizers:Crab fritters: delicious. The portions are TINY for the cost, but still tasty. Wings: the wings surpassed my expectations. They had a nice bite and crunch to them and a great kick. Some people thought they were too spicy to eat, but I thought it was great. Chopped salad: I wouldn't order this again. I appreciated the freshness break from all the heavy food, but wasn't impressive.Cornbread: yummy! Portions weren't huge for the $6 price, but I'd eat it again. Dirty rice: 2 beautifully cooked and succulent shrimp on top of a bed of dirty rice. Winner winner! The dumplings entree was delicious, albeit a bit salty. The rest of my group had the burger, the catfish, shrimp and grits, and the jerk chicken. Everyone was happy with their picks, but my friend said the jerk chicken needed more spice. Desserts:Geisha tart: think deconstructed fancy tart. It was good, but not mind blowing. Josephine's dream: delicious decadence in a cup. I loved the crisp crunch from the pecan toffee and the panda cotta helped cut any lurking cloying decadence. Great pick! Overall, I'd come back. The price has me a bit wary, but the food was overall good.",2,0,0,Valerie N.,"Manhattan, NY",13,362,463

I came here before and their chicken and waffles changed so much! I remember it as fried chicken with fresh spices, and syrup on the side. Still love the ""yep, it's chicken and waffle circa 1930"" though! It was marinated in spicy sauce and I think syrup. It was cooked well and was just spicy enough for my taste. Extra points for those few slices of pickles. I love the grits. It came with four big sized shrimps and it was covered in stew and sausage.

4.0,11/6/2017,"Very popular hot spot in Harlem and I can see why. Amazing dishes and exciting atmosphere! Inside is great, but I always love to sit outside when it's possible, especially in the cooler evenings. There are some street walkers right outside and one time one of them touched my arm asking for money or food while I was dining. It was uncomfortable, but that's why there's a little garden fence around Red Rooster. I did have an experience where a table of 8 arrived 30 minutes later than my table and received their food before we did. After asking about it, we still didn't get our plates until a little of an hour. It was very inconvenient as it was very late at night, but the manager was cordial and offered us a deal that made me feel like he appreciated us and makes me happy to return. I would hate to have a horrible experience enough to never return so I'm glad that hasn't happen. I want to continue to enjoy the mac and cheese, the music, the people.

4.0,11/5/2017,"Been here before but this review is for Sunday brunch:I wish they took reservations to make life easier but they don't. The wait for brunch is long so just prepare for it and embrace it. The line you see when you walk in, YES, it is the line you stand in to put your name on the list to get a table so no need to waste your time or hold up the line by walking past everyone in said line to ask your question if this is the line you should stand in to get a table. If you have a reservation they will text you so please don't cut in front of people patiently waiting to ask how much longer til your reservation, if you are on the list they will get to you so be patient and quite annoying people by coming to the front of the line as if 20 other people aren't already standing there.... you see the line... people are not invisible.Now, aside from some of the super annoying patrons who don't respect personal space, know how to say excuse me, or try to squeeze in or through small spaces they can't fit the actual restaurant experience was lovely. The patience and professionalism of the staff did not go unnoticed and should be rewarded because some of these folks were acting beyond privileged and important lol. The wait for a table was 45-60 minutes (this was around 12:30) so we snagged a seat at the bar and by the time we got the text our table was ready we had already ordered our food (the wait was just under an hour as the hostess predicted) the bartender Campus was great we didn't order any drinks but watched how he calmly ran the bar and was seemingly attentive to everyone.What we ordered:Yard bird French Toast Mac & GreensSide of Bacon  (LOTS of bacon unlike other places who skimp we had at least 6 strips)Everything was delicious THANK GOODNESS because if not the wait would've been for nothing. They also had a band playing on the day we went (Sunday) and they are good so don't be surprised when you see the man with the tip bucket come around lolSide note : beware of the cloth napkins they will leave lint on your clothes especially if you're wearing black or something that will catch the lint :/Will definitely be back, maybe for dinner or breakfast on a weekday.",0,0,0,Miss D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,48,2

4.0,11/5/2017,"Brunch on a Saturday.  I highly recommend reservations because this place gets packed.  This is a fun spot with a live DJ, you can dance or grab a cocktail at the bar while wait until you are  seated. Overall the food is great.  I highly recommend the Yard Bird.  The drinks, they were ok. Desserts you should pass.   Now for the details below. I do not frequent Harlem much but after seeing a bzzfeed on best fried chicken and Red Rooster received the most votes I was curious to try.   I got some friends together to catch up because the more people, the more dishes we can try.  I had made reservations for Saturday brunch the prior week, everyone arrived within the reservation time.  They will not seat you until your entire party has arrived.  We waited an additional 20 minutes and there were a few empty tables.  I'm not sure why or how 3 hostesses can't get it together to seat people.   I brought it to their attention to ask how much longer and we were immedialty seated.  I guess there is no communication between them?We were a party of 4 and seated in a small table that is more comfortable for 2 so we were a bit tight.  Drinks-$13 The Savoy- vodka, lemon, agave, muddled grapes- I was not impressed, it felt watered down.$11 Rooster Royale Punch-white sangria - white wine, grapefruit, tequila, lime - My friend seemed to enjoy it.Food-Corn Bread-  this was lovely, served toasted with honey butter and tomato jam.  I loved the tomato Jam. Wish they would have given more of each.Short Ribs was the Braise of the day- served a few veggies under the short ribs with 2 fried eggs on top.  The Short Ribs were lovely slow cooked with a delicious sauce with a hit of jalapeno for some heat.  I loved the sauce, but I felt the dish needed a little more sauce and I wished there was something like rice or mashed potatoes under the short ribs.  I needed a carb.Shrimp with grits- This was a good dish.  I'm not a fan of grits but my friends really enjoyed the creamy grits.  The 3 shrimp were cooked to perfection and the gumbo stew was delicious.  Buy only 3 shrimp... Yep Chicken and waffle- The chicken is smothered in RR hot sauce.  The combination of spicy with the waffle was good.  The waffles have maple in the batter just the right amount of sweet. Yard Bird- THIS IS WHAT I CAME HERE FOR.  This fried chicken was so good, even the breast was juicy.  The chicken was well seasoned through out the chicken and there is a hint of honey in the sauce, we loved it. It is served with a little mashed sweat potatoes and collard greens. Dessert- cupcake of the day was vanilla with vanilla ganache.  This was a small cupcake and the cake was dry. Honeybun- meh.. not horrible but nothing great.",3,0,1,Dynomite h.,"Brooklyn, NY",16,31,29

After looking at the minimal options on their brunch menu we then continued to ask for white meat in substitution for dark meat and was told the white meat would of be 6 dollars EXTRA on our bill in which their meal options were very pricey. After hearing the extra charges 2 of went to Sylvia's to see more affordable options. While the 2 of us went to observe the other options the 2 in the Red Rooster were kicked out of the restaurant. So, I conclude if you are ever in Harlem I highly suggest Sylvia's the food and chicken are very good, the service is much better, and the food is at an affordable price.",0,0,0,Brianna H.,"Chandler, AZ",23,1,0

5.0,11/1/2017,"I was very VERY Pleased with my experience at Red Rooster.  First off, I will say that I was very shocked by how crowded it was for a Monday evening. My boyfriend and I came here with our son around 7pm and had a 40 minute wait (so I highly recommend booking a reservation). If we knew the ambience of this place, we probably would have left our son home or came to eat earlier. Since it was so crowded, we went to Starbucks on the corner and came back once we received a text that our table was ready. Now I am not sure if it is like this every night, but while we was there they had a DJ and violinist at the front entrance near the bar. A good mix of jazz / R&B/ hip hop played throughout the night. Behind the bar was the actual restaurant, with every table full. I noticed that some people had family styled plates and were sharing their food, while others had personal entrees. We ordered the shrimp & grits, honey yard bird, and mac & cheese. All Of It Was Amazing!  We enjoyed our food so much that the people next to us asked what we ordered and ordered the exact same thing! LOL,  and they too enjoy it! I have no complaints with Red Rooster, and for all our food, 2 glasses of wine and a lemonade our bill was around $100.

4.0,10/30/2017,"Ambience:The ambience of RR reminds me a lot of an ADD human...a lot to look at, loud and scattered, with electric energy. We came on a Saturday night with late reservations (like 1030pm) and it was bumping. The front portion of the entry way has a club like feel with people dancing and DJ music and behind the front bar is a large but crammed dining area. But while I found the environment a bit unusual, the food was phenomenal. Food:Not quite sure what the Yelp category listing title of Southern/Scandinavian means but essentially it's gourmet southern food with flavors that go beyond butter. We ordered the cornbread, mac n cheese, the salad, and the fried chicken with sweet mash.First off, cornbread is dense and delicious with a side of tomato jam. GET THIS. I was ready to be disappointed by the mac and cheese because I usually find gourmet mac to be caloric but tasteless. Not at RR. It was really good. The salad was fresh but expensive for the quantity. Fried chicken was large portioned and the crusting has a slight kick to it. Doesn't say it in the menu but it definitely has got a thin layer of heat embedded in the skin why is fine by me.Service: Waiters were friendly but service was a bit like the ambience, inviting but scattered and busy. We had to remind them to bring our drink order a few times but overall not terrible. Would come back again!

3.0,10/30/2017,"Red Rooster has a lot going on at once. On this Saturday night, as soon as u walked in there was a packed main bar with a DJ playing very good music. I couldn't even tell if there were any seats, that's how packed it was. It took forever to get a drink. Right behind the bar is a very nice dining area with stairs going down to the club area. I was waiting on line in the main area to go downstairs so I got the chance to scope everything. When my friend called they told him that the club area downstairs opened at 11. We waited on line well until after 1am for them to say they were only letting bottle service in. The downstairs area had tables, a dance floor, and another bar. Unfortunately, the DJ downstairs was not as good as the DJ upstairs which was disappointing. And my mimosas were better upstairs but we had fun anyhow. It was $380 for a bottle of Hennessy. I don't drink Hennessy so I ordered my drinks from the bar and I paid $13 for mimosas and $15 for a glass of pinot Grigio. In about an hour, it was packed down there for the whole night.

It was just me and my girlfriend( 2 PAC voice). We came in and were greated very hospitably. The manager who brought us to our table was Chris Keys. Very charming personality and very professional. Chris checked on us a few times and invited back for a Jazz brunch but we save Sunday's for football and sleep.  I would absolutely recommend the shrimp and grits.

The waiter takes a photo of us with the chicken then takes it back to ""cut it"" I'm writing this review as I'm still waiting for the chicken to come back. The people next to us are asking where is the freaking chicken!!! It has been a good 15mins without lying still no chicken. Are they making a new one? So far experience isn't great.

There were still some fathers left on the chicken drumett as well as on the thigh skin side, a real turn off.The sweet mash tasted like a wired combination of pumpkin spice, some cinnamon and sweet potatoes kinda tasted like a desert instead a part of an entree.All in all the chef did a lazy job of creating the required flavor combinations.Left the restaurant with out finishing my meal.I am surprised at eater.ny for endorsing a sub par menu item as one of the best places for fried chickenNot on my to go to restaurant list .",3,0,0,Umer A.,"Brooklyn, NY",13,132,189

1.0,10/14/2017,If I could give this place a zero I would. Not for their drinks or good. Only had the drinks never had the food cannot attest. What I can attest to is the treatment of their guest by their Maitre D (bald head with beard) and their violent security. I witnessed security beat a man within inches of his life one night. (The ability to upload video is not present and photos wouldn't do justice to the violence witnessed.) I then chose to grab a drink months later thinking maybe the violent security had been let go after the altercation I witness months prior. I grab two drinks at the bar and then proceed to this party that they have on the lower level. I approach the Maitre D asking about why the line was being held after multiple people have exited the party and we are waiting now 35minutes. (1:45am) Instead of being treated with respect I was told the conversation would not proceed because they were at capacity. This was same gentlemen that questioned if the party I was joining was already inside as I approached him. If your at capacity why does it matter if the party I am joining is inside? I proceed to ask for a card to their establishment and he proceeded to advise me he was going to get security to escort me out and I could not come down stairs to the party. I'm not sure if race was the cause or if the fact I was with people who patronized the bar versus bought a bottle was the problem. Needless to say security asked me to leave and proceeded to be rude and disrespectful as I exited. All because I asked for a card to their general manager.

3.0,10/13/2017,"Well... I'm never looking at a buzzfeed video the same way again.Came during lunch and dead set on the yard chicken. Got the prix fixe which entails an appetizer, entree, and donuts, and bought the Earl of Harlem for a nice afternoon kickback. We also got the corn bread because why not, it seems essential to the whole soul food experience.In order:Cornbread: pretty good but slightly dry. Maybe it was out for awhile.Salad appetizer: I don't know if it's because I've been in love with this vegan girl but salads are growing on me.Soup appetizer: Why did I get a salad? The squash soup was delicious. Like a light thickened syrup.Yardbird: Served on a bed of pureed squash, it really adds to the sweet/savory complex. The flavor was evenly distributed, it didn't feel like it was slathered on. The skin however, was very tough! It might've been necessary to keep the juices in but it kinda ruined the experience.Donuts: Eh.

2.0,10/12/2017,"First off we were explained that they were out of: all beers on tap and several of the bottled beers. Perhaps the tap was broken, then go and get some cases of beer.  Then they were out of a bunch of dishes - this was at 7 PM. Second - very loud and made even worse by the blaring music. If you already have bad acoustics why make it worse. We would barely talk. Third and most important - the food with one exception was disappointing. Maybe our expectations were too high given this is a chopped judge's restaurant. The appetizer Caribbean fish was super spicy which we should have been either warned or asked if we like very spicy food. There is no bread at the restaurant, only cornbread to order. We did not want sweet bread. Service was okay. I don't recommend the dumplings with short ribs. There was no meat. maybe they put some short ribs bones to make the sauce? The dumplings were actually chewy dense potato gnocchi. For $24 it was an appetizer portion which didn't matter since it wasn't good. The saving grace was the honey chicken. Skin was crispy and chicken was moist. The sweet potato mash was too sweet, maybe filled with  sugar? two hours so we didn't stay for dessert. Wasn't expecting it to be good based on the meal.

Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. The menu was very limited in my opinion, I asked if there were other menus, our waiter told us that was it.My husband ordered a burger, and said it wasn't bad, but not nothing special and felt it was a bit pricey. I ordered butternut squash bisque, it was delicious, buy my gnocchi with pork not so much it sat heavy. It was not a bad experience, but I expected to be wowed by a place that everyone talks about.

2.0,10/10/2017,"So I was pretty excited of this place after watching Buzzfeed. But it didn't live up to the hype. Enviroment: So-soFirst, the decor is nice but music (and live band) was way too loud. The service is slow (but I did went on a busy night - not including the 45 min wait time) It took about 20 min before someone took our order. Food: Disappointing Corn bread was very ordinary. Nothing special. Mac and cheese was the highlight and for that, I gave it 2 stars. Ordered the Hot Honey chicken - large portions (can be shared by two ppl with sides). But it was neither hot or honey sweet. Chicken was also very dry. Skin wasn't crisp. I had to wash it down with so much water. The sweet mash have a woody smokey taste to it - so it ruins the overal flavor. And lastly - do NOT order soda. Because, it takes like water down diet coke - with slight alcoholic aftertaste as if the glass wasn't clean properly.

3.0,10/9/2017,"This started out as a six-star (out of five) review because we have loved Marcus's cooking since our days eating at Aquavit in Minneapolis, own his cookbook, have read ""Yes Chef"" and loved our visit to Red Rooster on our last trip to NYC. We had a reservation at 5:30 and got there exactly on time. So far so good. Minus one star: the beer. I ordered the evening's special IPA and they were out -- at 5:30. When our party of four ordered a second round, we were told they were out of every beer except for the two kinds we had ordered previously. Hmmm. Minus two stars: One couple ordered the taco truck, a meal for two for $60. It came with five small tortillas. Now first of all, why would a meal for two come with an odd number of tortillas? They asked for more tortillas and were brought five more. When the bill came, they were charged $9 for the 30 cents worth of tortillas that should have been provided in the first place. Has Marcus fallen on hard times to the extent he has to charge $9 for five small tortillas?Minus 3 stars: After we had been there for an hour and 40 minutes, we were politely asked to leave because they needed our table.

Red Rooster's fried chicken was the worth it winner, so I decided I would drop the $27 and check out this infamous dish. It was a huge portion, but the dish didn't really remind me of fried chicken. I love the extra bits of fried batter goodness that surround the chicken  and unfortunately the layer of batter on this chicken was so uniform  ( which some people might like). The flavors were bold, and a lot sweeter than expected but almost too crazy for me. But I have to say, I definitely have had better fried chicken for cheaper (for example, Jacobs pickles in upper west side). So would I come here again, probably not.

The entrees were delicious but our server neglected to tell us they came with no sides. Since that server was unavailable, we ordered less than we would have liked and had unbalanced meals - especially for the price point. Overall, I cannot rate a restaurant well that seems to have such a tough time getting out of their own way.

The best fried chicken I ever had! Unlike the fried chicken I've had in the past in the South, there is a perfect amount of batter ( a thin crunchy amount). In addition the battle was well seasoned and not the least bit greasy 2) shrimp and grits-- another delicious choice! The shrimp was well seasoned and nothing to write home about. The grits on the other hand...just simply wow! Not too salty and with the right amount of cheese3) corn bread-- crispy and solid choice . Came with a special butter spread which was light and buttery.4) Mac and greens-- good but nothing special l.

We were greeted by a friendly server and I attempted to order a beer on tap but was informed that none of the taps were working. Great... so I settled for something bottled. We then decided to order the meatballs and cornbread to start. I have read raving reviews on both starters so I was pretty excited to try them. You can learn everything you need to know about a restaurant and chef based on a few staple items, one of those is cornbread. The appetizers reached the table before we were served water or my beer. We dug into the cornbread first and was immediately disappointed. It was dry, crumbled easily and a tad tasteless. The meatballs were a relief, as they were moist and full of flavor. Finally the beer reached the table half way through the appetizers. I've learned from experience to cut my losses early and move on as soon as I see any indication of decline or unsatisfactory behavior. The cornbread told me everything I needed to know...if you can't make cornbread right you probably can't make chicken. Call it what you want, but I know cornbread, seasoning and fried chicken. This wasn't going to cut it. Since this restaurant is a stop for many tourists and people star struck by the owner, I get why the reviews are so great.

3.0,9/10/2017,"I had watched Marcus Samuelsson in a couple of Anthony Bourdain episodes and was super interested in trying out his Harlem restaurant even though I'm a vegetarian. Ended up coming here on a Friday night a few weeks ago with a group of friends - there's a small area outside, a pretty large and busy bar area, and then two levels of formal seating further inside. There were several tables open when we arrived around 7, but the inside seating area was only for reservations, and we were told that the wait would be 2 hours starting from when the rest of our party arrived, but that we should check in when they did.When the rest of the party arrived ten minutes later, we were immediately seated in a four-top outside, though we ended up having to carry over our own chairs to help the hostess set up the table - a little bizarre! We started with the corn bread, which came with butter and tomato jam. The bread comes warm, and is sliced per the size of your party - so, so good, warm, and buttery. The condiments were good, especially the jam, but the bread itself was perfect on its own. Even though you're about to eat a hearty entree, I would definitely recommend the corn bread. The other people in my party ordered the famous fried chicken and the lamb dumplings. There isn't a vegetarian option on the menu, but the waiter recommended pairing the succotash and the mac n greens. These were pretty good - the mac n greens, despite the name, is not at all a lighter sister to mac n cheese. This is a heavy dish - I couldn't get more than a few bites in. The succotash was crunchy, heavy on the oil, but also good for what it was.  I heard good reviews for the chicken, and really good reviews for the lamb. If you're coming here though, you should definitely try out the chicken at least once, though the table seemed to agree that the lamb was the best entree! The service was okay, it was sometimes hard to get the attention of our waiter, and we ended up waiting about twenty minutes before we could call him over to order. The atmosphere was pretty loud, even outside - and by 9pm, there was a DJ setting up inside, so I can only imagine how loud it gets in the indoor seating area! Definitely a fun place to grab drinks and hang out, though hard to have hear each other given the volume of the music.",0,0,0,Nivedita S.,"New York, NY",357,43,1
5.0,9/9/2017,"SummaryIn my first excursion into the heart of Harlem, I found what looks to be a gem of a hotspot.  A lively bistro serving up some delicious comfort food, fantastic cocktails, and great music.  The crowd was quite good looking as well!  Highly recommend this fun spot.  Bonus is the jazz lounge downstairs I'll have to return for!The FoodComfort food.  Plain and simple.  The crab fritters were full of chunky lumps of crab served with a light cream sauce drizzled atop, yum!  The wings had just the right amount of kick with enough sauce to make you lick your fingers, the spicy pickles giving the dish a nice extra touch of flavor.  The yardbird was phenomenal.  I expected a ton of breading and ended up with a perfectly fried skin that barely had any of those pesky carbs.The DrinksThe bartender certainly knows what he's doing.  His takes on the martini and cosmo were quite flavorful.  They could use more of a selection of beers, but what they had was great (we had Six Point).The AtmosphereFUN!  Everyone was so friendly and inclusive.  A few people walked by and encouraged our group to get in there and dance.  The great part was that no one was trying hard at all.  Just all having fun.",1,0,0,Paul H.,"Manhattan, NY",193,347,178

We got there at about 4:10 and we were told that if we wanted dinner we'd have to wait at the bar until 4:30 to be seated. Ok.My girlfriend attempted to order the mussels, but they were out. Well, ok. I asked for a beer list and was told that they didn't have beer, neither bottle or draft, at the moment. Oh, ok. I had the Aunt Maybel's Dumplings. They were good, but I wasn't wowed. My girlfriend had the salmon. It was just...ok. Everything was just mediocre, including the service (long wait for drinks/water despite there not being many people there).

3.0,8/23/2017,"Disappointed. I've had this place on my mind for a few years now, and was excited to find myself in the area and able to stop in.We were able to get a table at 4:45 on a Tuesday without a reservation.  The staff were trying for friendly? High end service?? Apologetic? Not sure but it didn't really come off well- or comfortable.There seems to be an undercurrent of them not getting along. I had a very small $5 iced tea that I couldn't taste. My husband had a mixed drink that I don't recall the name of that was good, and late, and at $15 I don't like to see a good portion sloshing out into a tray on its way to the table.Cornbread!! Wow! Very good. 2 thick generous slices with sweet soft honey butter and tomato jam that tasted so summer fresh!Deviled eggs- 3- SMALL-not freshly made for sure- not like the pictures at all.  Solidly cold all the way through in an unpleasant approaching frozen way.The chicken skin crisp was only a crumb on top. Yard bird- and....wait...where is the sweet potato and greens???? Oh! Of course it's that little smear underneath the chicken- you can almost see it. What there was of it was VERY good! The chicken- one leg quarter was quite seasoned- too much for me- bright red powdery- the other not enough and a bit soggy.  The meat was tender, flavorful and well cooked.Steak- it's hard for me to comment because my husband ordered it well done and I don't care for that-but I didn't like the taste either.  The topping tasted of burnt pan and. Lack pepper. There were a few pink pieces that displeased him but I ate them.  Unimpressed. He usually gets a better quality of overcooked steak.  This was quite tough. Unremarkable cup of fries either over seasoned or without. We decided to skip dessert. Also: it was hot.  It was hot outside- and it was hot inside- hotter- outside there was a breeze- inside not so much.  I think that played a part- we left sweaty and glad to step outside.

He was happy with everything. Our waitress pointed out the dishes that were gluten and dairy free and I chose the ribs, aka. the BBQ Ribs Block Party with a side of Street Corns (no cheese).

5.0,8/17/2017,"Had one of the best meals I've had in 15 years in NYC here last night.  For me, it lived up to the hype.Arrived at 6pm and sat at the bar to eat (dining solo that was my plan, I wasn't ""stuck"" in the bar area as others said).  Bartender was top notch, asking what she could get me within a minute while remaining attentive to all of the customers at the a relatively-full bar.  (I'd say it was consistently 85% full.)Ordered the chicken and waffle appetizer and collard mac & cheese side, and together I had more than enough to eat.The chicken and waffle was superb.  A crispy-on-the-outsides, fluffy-on-the-insides half waffle with a few pieces of savory chicken atop hit the spot.  Not traditional fried chicken that you have to smother in syrup, but the chicken seemed to be already cooked in the maple-y glaze.  Excellent.Collard mac & cheese was equally on-point.  It was enough that it could have been shared between 2 people as a side.  I, however, devoured every last bite.  Even if you don't think you like collards, you will like this.  They are really minimal compared to the mac and cheese itself - as if some mom hid them in there to get their kid to eat their veggies.  Creamy mac, a perfect crispy top, and well worth it.  Again, excellent.To drink, I had the Rooster Punch, basically red sangria.  It was great.  I would say it was slightly overpriced for what it is (at $11).  It should be $8-9, and at the bar a happy hour special would be nice.The atmosphere and decor hit the nail on the head.  The restaurant was vibrant, well-appointed, and had an energy that is hard to find downtown.  The people looked good, the crowd was diverse, and the music was loud but not too loud.Overall, one of the best meals I have had in NYC.

5.0,8/15/2017,"Red rooster is always my ""To-Go"" spot now since I live in the Bronx. I'm always in Harlem now, and I love this place. I went here on Sunday which was live music night, and I had a ball. Rooster never fails me. I ALWAYS have a good time. I finally got to try some of their food, and got an appetizer of the deviled eggs, and the mini crab cakes. I bought the food was pretty good. I had the ""Harlem Punch"" and I thought it was ""OK"". The only reason why I said that is because the bartender put too much ice in the wine glass we were being served. I'm big on drinks, and service so I know a good drink you're not supposed to taste the alcohol. However, I didn't and I had 3 of them lol..

3.0,8/14/2017,"Basically, they took traditional black dishes and whitewashed them. This approach appeals to tourists/white folks who want to 'experience the hood' in a 'celebrity chef-owned restaurant' kinda way, and the newly arrived gentrification gang. Okay, so....Shrimp & grits (best dish of the meal) was lacking in meaningful portions of shrimp, the 'gumbo sauce' it was sitting in was tasty (should've been darker & smokier) but had no visible signs of other gumbo ingredients, as advertised on menu. Maybe they puréed them in? ‍ I dunno, but $19 demands more than 3 shrimp on the plate. Grits were well done. Mac & Greens -- just no. Trying to combine 2 standards into one dish, doesn't work. If you're going to serve collards, serve collards. Come correct. And Mac & cheese is a stand alone dish. I know restaurants like to jazz it up these days with lobster & other bullshit, but newsflash, it ain't broke, don't fix it. Cornbread - they tried, bless em. Deviled eggs - perhaps the most ridiculous dish. Serving size for $9 was 3 egg halves, with a half teaspoon of whipped egg product mousse. No tang, no texture, no paprika?? Def not your family reunion/cookout deviled eggs. My advice regarding a true black culinary experience, for all you travelers coming to Harlem, there are any number of holes in the wall, buffet lunch spots and take out joints that serve up classic dishes, authentically and at a reasonable price, just ask a local. NOW THE GREAT STUFF - the drinks are dope, definitely worth the price. The staff are super sweet, very good at managing a crowded dining area, servers step in and out for one another so that diners are never left waiting or wanting, they get 5 stars for service! The space itself is beautiful, vibrant, funky, uplifting, artsy, warm and welcoming. I live in Harlem and pass RR all the time and it's never empty, so they're doing a few things right. They know their crowd/market and they're sticking with that formula. The food isn't bad, it's just that when it comes to certain culturally significant dishes, I've definitely had better and at a much better price. I mean, grits is one of the cheapest foods out there!

The rib meat was also a bit Fatty and served Luke-warm. We had two sides to share which were each approximately one cup. Everything was well seasoned, but not extraordinary and certainly did not warrant the price tag. Two others at my table ordered the blackened catfish which they enjoyed, but, once again, the serving size of the fish was very small - sliced thin more like tilapia then how catfish is usually prepared and served. The wait staff were very nice, but the service for the drinks was especially slow. A couple of times we thought they had forgotten to put in the drink order because it took so long.  The atmosphere was very festive which was nice.

You can say I was very excited to try this place ever since watching Marcus Samuelsson on The Taste, I've grown to become a huge fan of his. Ambiance: ****Cute decor. Love the photos throughout the restaurant and the restroom. Imparts a very homey and familial vibe peppered with Harlemesque decor accents. The bar is a cool spot. Food: *****/***1st Visit: Helga's Meatballs were amazing. Very tasty with the sauce, lingonberry jam and the pea shoots and nuts, giving it a nice crunch. Presentation was wonderful. The Fried Yardbird was delicious and the sweet potato and collard greens complemented the dish nicely. I ate every last bite, pickles and all! Dessert of orange and jelly preserve-filled doughnuts were scrumptious. The cinnamon sugar reminiscent  of a churro.2nd Visit: Okay, not sure if it was that our reservation was at 3p, which we then found out is also the time the kitchen begins to close, hence the poor quality, presentation and service? Anyway, I'll stick to food description here for now. I ordered the Caesar Wedge w/ cornbread crisp. Refreshing crisp bites, and the dressing was good. I couldn't eat the raw anchovies because of a health condition but they left it on there anyway. The hubby raved about Helga's Meatballs. I ordered the shrimp and grits. There were three large pieces of shrimp smothered in the grits you couldn't tell there was shrimp in it at first. On my first visit, I was impressed by a nearby shrimp and grits display, making me want to order it this time around. If you saw my dish, it looked like a bunch of sauce covering god-knows-what. But, I have to be honest,  it was very cheesy and tasty. Onto Hub's Yardbird. It was just undercooked inside, with a soggy, oily skin. For all of us home chefs, this usually means the chicken was fried before the oil became hot enough or served too quickly without letting the oil sufficiently drip through a resting grate. You could also see the inside was underdone, with bloody raw bits near the bone (The Hubby survived though, no food borne illnesses here). From watching Samuelsson on The Taste yelling at plenty of cooks' undercooked chicken, I know it certainly would not fly with him to see something so disappointing being served at his establishment. The Hubs was very unsatisfied, he wanted to go to Sylvia's across the way for reliably good fried chicken come dinner time. Dessert for us both were the house doughnuts. This time, they didn't taste as good. Just ordinary, nothing to rave about. Service: ***/**Service is okay. You will get what you need, but don't expect them to check in until after you're midway or almost done with your meal. It seemed perfunctory, which I suppose, is the service for most Restaurant Week patrons. Having lived in NYC for almost a decade, I'm blown away these days by amazing service than I am mediocre service, as unfortunately, that's what we've come to expect.

1.0,8/3/2017,Went here for lunch during restaurant week with a co-worker for her birthday. I had been here only once before and it was descent. Today I was mortified! It was the worst experience ever. On first bite of My salad it tasted like DIRT and to cover up that flavor it was terribly spicy ... the waiter said it was the fire spiced pecans but it tasted like a Tabasco dressing!!! How in gods name could you ruin salad??!! But nonetheless they did. My stomach was immediately upset and I ordered cornbread to help calm things down a bit but two thin slices came out stale and cold. My friends entree was pulled pork on two burnt pieces of white bread with orange BBQ potato chips. My catfish sandwich entree tasted like dirt once again and was covered with yet more spice and jalapeños maybe to kill fishy smell and flavor. On the side more of those hard wood BBQ chips my friend had. Horrible !!! If I woulda known I could have bought two bags of honey BBQ chips in the dollar store and a mc fish sandwich and saved my hard earned $75 BUCKS!!Won't dare ever go back or recommend this joint! You gotta be on crack to eat here! One star only for friendly service.,2,0,0,Jennifer B.,"Yonkers, NY",103,115,36
3.0,8/3/2017,"Nice restaurant, but average food and service. The meatball appetizer was bland and caused some stomach discomfort for each of my party. The crab fritters were tasty. The shrimp & grits were good, but the presentation was not visually appealing. The chicken & waffle appetizer was nice. The jerk chicken was flavorless. The cherry pie was a pair of tartlets, not a slice of pie. The service was mediocre. There was plenty of staff, but there was more interaction amongst themselves, and not attentive to guests.

1.0,8/3/2017,We drove all the way from Silver Spring Maryland to celebrate my sisters birthday at red rooster Harlem because chef Samuelson he's her favorite but what can I say this visit was very disappointing. After we arrive we were told it was a wait it was OK it was short then we were seated in the main dining room or excitement was palpable we've heard so many pleasant stories about this restaurant.After we were seated we waited about 5 to 10 minutes for server to come over once you arrive you can tell that he wasn't pleased that he had to take care of us but we went ahead and ordered appetizers they wet tasty. Again we waited for the server to return so that we could order our salad and entree choice this times it took him over 20 mins to return. I wasn't sure if he knew we could see him because he kept walking past our table constantly never acknowledging us so finally he arrived we ordered our entrée and we decided that we shouldn't be treated this way so we asked him to send a manager over and at that point we told Manager we actually didn't want him to serve us for the rest of the evening because he basically ruined our visit to the location and it was my sister birthday celebration The manager understood and  took care of us for the rest of the evening but at this point to visit had gone down hill there was no return.Our salads and entrées finally made it to the table the food was tasty but the evening in my eyes it was ruined already so we really didn't enjoy yourself as much as we thought we would they sing happy birthday to my sister we paid the tab and we left.

I can't believe there are still some bars that don't.  It is also worth mentioning that their decor in there is great!   The bartender came by to get me a drink and they were good!  Their happy hour deals are $6 rails & wine, beer and $10 specialty drinks until 7:00 at the bar.  My friends eventually arrived, and we ended up deciding to eat somewhere else.  I enjoyed my time at this place and would return again when I'm in Harlem.",1,1,2,Andrew P.,"Greenbelt, MD",329,379,576
3.0,7/30/2017,"When you arrive you can feel the excitement in the air at the Red Rooster in Harlem. It starts with bustling movement of the neighborhood and those dining outside. As for me and the other person dining we chose indoor dining. Where the energy of outside made its way into the main dining room and bar.  Once inside you will find a large room with a full bar and another with a large open concept dining room, you could clearly see into the kitchen.Once inside I gave my name as I had a reservation that we were 10 minutes early for. Looking at the size of the crowd and the host stating they will call us shortly it's clear they stick to the schedule. At the time of our reservation we were seated with menus. We were promptly offered water options bottled or tap. After asking a few Menu questions the server immediately informed us 3 entrees listed were not available. It was only 6pm?! My thought is, attach an amended menu. This may be better than saying 'sorry I have tell you we don't have this, this and that.' We wanted to order the 'yardbird' meal for two but the macaroni and cheese is served on top of the collard greens. If you ask them to serve it separately you have to pay for them as separate side dishes. Hummm!! I don't mind my food touching but there are times when one item over powers the other and the taste is lost. I ordered the individual fried bird meal it has, collard greens and whipped yams. After receiving my order I understood why they suggest you pay for the sides separately. Its done to mask they give you small portions and if they were separate it you would see the minimal amount that you receive. I must say fried bird(chicken) is flavorful, crispy and moist. My dining partner found egg shells in cornbread, it was quickly replaced. I tasted the cornbread its ok but not special enough to pay $6 for two slices. During our dining experience a band arrived which stepped up the already lively environment. Food and live music, a good deal I'd say. Overall the food is seasoned well without being salty.

Lots of people standing around the front door where there is a bar making it difficult to simply walk in or out. There are more people standing around outside as well. The music was extremely loud. Trying to dine and have a conversation was challenging with the noise level of people trying to talk over the music and the music blasting. There was a man walking around with a camera for a fee (I don't know how much). It's as if the restaurant is trying to be a club/ lounge. Overall I had a good time with good company.

The wings had great flavor, but the meat was a bit dry.  Shrimp and grits are very nice, not many shrimp, a ton of grits. The whole bird finally came out with sparklers, but went back Ti the kitchen to get cut and did not re appear for 10 plus minutes.  One it arrived, the crust was crisp and the meat was juicy and flavorful.  The chicken came with biscuits and mac n cheese.  The mac n cheese was unreal, couldn't stop eating it.  The biscuits came with nothing to smear on so the guy told me he could bring some sort of flavored honey which gave it some flavor.  We ordered waffles on the side to eat with the chicken and that was a highlight.  We ended with the filled doughnuts which I did not like the filling of and we also had special cake that the waiter said was spicy cake with butter cream.  Not sure about the spicy part, but the buttercream made the cake.  In retrospect, I think I would order the yard bird and waffle on the side as I think the individually fried chicken pieces look like they have a better crust to it.  I will be back.",1,0,0,Zachary E.,"Tenafly, NJ",11,38,142

1.0,7/19/2017,"It pains me to have to write this, but I do. I live in Harlem. Have been in Harlem for 10+ years, just up the street from Red Rooster. I remember when it opened, and Marcus Samuelsson was saying all those things about finally having a ""destination"" restaurant in the neighborhood; I agreed. Husband and I waited a few months for the craziness to die down, went for his bday, all was great. Samuelsson coming around asking everyone how the food was, etc. - great food, great service, great atmosphere, all good. Have been a couple times since and no complaints.Until last night. Went with a friend visiting from out of town, she was super excited to try it. We had reservations and were seated right away. Got water right away. Then...  nothing. About 20 mins later waiter shows up and asks if we're ready to order. I asked if we could order drinks first and he says ""hold on"" - walks away, comes back a couple minutes later w/out explanation. We order drinks - one cocktail, one wine.20 more minutes, nothing. Another waiter comes by to ask if we want to order; we say we'd really like our drinks first, pls, it's been a long wait. Eventually drinks arrive. We order food. Fine...sometimes these things happen. App comes, food is amazing, but I'd like another drink. Order it. Finish app. Table cleared. People sitting at table next to us order and receive their entrées. I still have no drink. Also no entrée. It's been another 20 mins waiting on one glass of wine. Eventually catch eye of waiter and inquire where my drink was; he wanders off and eventually comes back with it. No apologies or anything, even tho I explained this was the 2nd time it took 20+ minutes for a drink. So I'm getting a little annoyed but am not going to let it ruin my dinner with a friend I rarely see. Food eventually comes and is fine. Manager then comes over to apologize and says next wine will be comp'd - I say great, thanks, normally I'm not a complainer but 2 times was a bit much. I'm grateful for the follow up and am now thinking all is good. I order another glass of wine (which, thankfully, comes in reasonable time).Bill comes.... No comp (tho I didn't realize this til they'd scanned our cards). I see manager in the corner speaking to the restaurant's musician - walk over, wait patiently near him for him to finish, he completely ignores me. I then walk around and find waiter, tell him what happened. He speaks to manager. Manager eventually comes over and says it will take ""forever"" to re-run the cards, that they have to void the system, type it all in again, that the 2 charges will appear on our accounts for several days, that they often have major issues with the credit card companies, yada yada yada... Like, clearly, he does NOT want to re-run the card and comp the drink as he said he would. I tell him ""well, you did say my 3rd wine would be comp'd"" and he tells me ""well, yes, but I meant that you needed to order it from ME and you didn't, you ordered it from the waiter, so that's why this happened."" Mind you, he NEVER told me this, and even if he had ... isn't the point of a comp to try to make an unhappy guest happier? And if so, isn't blaming said unhappy guest for not requesting the comp in the ""proper"" way just a tad bit counterproductive?? He tells me I can order a 4th glass from him - and he will comp it. It's 10p on a Tuesday night, we have work the next day, umm.... No, we're not going to stay here and risk a hangover b/c you can't be bothered to re-run a credit card. He gets quite pushy about the additional drink and I finally just told him to go away and I just ate the cost of the 3rd drink b/c it wasn't worth arguing with him anymore.Every other time I've been to RR, Samuelsson has been there interacting with guests. This is the first time he wasn't there. It is VERY clear the rest of the staff just stop giving a you-know-what when they're left on their own, and it's the guests who suffer.

2.0,7/6/2017,"Disclaimer: This rating is strictly food based and I'm hurt bih. Genuinely hurt. I am an enormous fan of Marcus Samuelsson, so I had to visit the restaurant. The first million times I've gone, I've never eaten anything. It was strictly for the two step. I recently made a visit to my home and wanted to make sure I ate here while I was in town.I booked the reservation, which was a smooth process. Everything was confirmed by phone two days prior to the reservation and our  table was ready when we got there!!!! How it's supposed to be. TAKE NOTE VANDAL!! First off, the ambiance in Red Rooster is just phenomenal. It is not over done, it is interesting, well designed, relaxed and very welcoming. I've never been somewhere and felt that level of comfort. The crowd is mixed and mature, which is one of the primary reasons why this is the place I love to party at.I ordered Helga's Meatballs, the Jerk Catfish, my cousins ordered the Island Catch, the ceviche taco and the cornbread.The meatballs were hittin'. They were moist, extremely flavorful and set off with just the right amount of ligonberry jam. I was satisfied. My Jerk Catfish was not a jerk at all but a very nice fellow as he had no spice or flavor! I started to get up and request a damn habanero so my life can be okay. It sat atop a bed of jasmine rice mixed with coconut milk or some other stuff. It was JUST OK. Imagine. The Island Catch was really great. The olives on it were very fresh and the fish was perfectly cooked. My cousin did not enjoy the taco since the shell was warm and ceviche is traditionally cold. Now the corn bread........... I have his books at home and in The Recipes I Cook at Home book, this cornbread is in there. I've made it and it's hittin right, why did it taste different at the restaurant. I almost didn't detect any corn kernels or cheddar. It was a little spongy but it was still okay. It was served with a sweet butter, which was amazing and a tomato bacon jam, I could have done without it.Overall.....I do not think I will eat here again. I may give it a second try but I will always come for the life that it gives. It is still one of my most favorite places to be and I still love me some Marcus!Just tell those fine ass chefs to stop messing up the recipes!",1,2,0,Crystal F.,"Atlanta, GA",10,84,0

I thought the portions were fine as well. The reason I'm only giving this 4 stars is because of the extremely slow service. Our waitress was very nice, but the food took forever to come out. In fact, the family next to us was getting extremely frustrated by how long it was taking that they almost left! We had 2pm reservations and didn't leave the restaurant until 3:30.

I debated whether or not I should take them, but figured it would be a nice place to say they have visited considering it's popularity. ANOTHER fail. Our food took 40 minutes to come out, even though we had also ordered appetizers, everything came out together. The Yardbird chicken was undercooked and lacked flavor. The manager did check in with our table and offered complimentary dessert (we end up leaving before it came out because it took extremely long) and to recook the chicken (it still came out pink and).

The mac and greens were very underwhelming. Not very flavorful. The highlight of my meal were the dumplings. I savored every bite of it. The ragu was explosive with flavor and the dumplings were the perfect texture. I'd go back just for that.All in all my experience was great.

I love patronizing local businesses in my neighborhood but RR is definitely not that.In short ,the service is hit or miss, food is hit or miss and music is terribly loud.

1.0,6/19/2017,"I live around the corner from Red Rooster, so eat there a few times a year. My friend and I decided to have brunch there yesterday, not realizing it was father's day so it was much more crowded than usual. No problem with that. We put our names on the list for a table, but ultimately got seats at the bar. They had one bartender working, ON FATHER'S DAY. That one guy was responsible for taking orders from, delivering food to, and pouring drinks for everyone at the bar. There was somebody else behind the bar, who only appeared to be pouring sodas and water. So the bartender was clearly overwhelmed, through no fault of his own. My friend and I both ordered a new item on the menu: short rib chilaquiles because it sounded delicious. We also ordered the cornbread, which has always been good. What we got was cornbread that was so dry and hard, that we literally couldn't cut it with a knife. It really looked like it had been sitting under a heat lamp overnight, after it had been sliced. The short rib chilaquiles didn't actually have any short ribs in it. My friend and I each had a sliver of meat in our scrambled eggs. The corn chips underneath were soggy and inedible, as both of our dishes had clearly been sitting for too long before we finally got them. It was really awful. There was nothing good I could say about the food this time, other than the fact that the eggs were cooked well. But I could have cooked the organic eggs I had in my fridge well myself. On top of all of that, there are 4 air conditioner vents right over the seats at the bar. They were dripping heavy amounts of condensation down on us. So now we find ourselves eating terrible food in a light rain storm. My friend and I wanted to get out of there quickly so that we could have drinks (and food) somewhere else. I handed my credit card to the bartender and told him that I wanted to pay the bill. And then I waited, and waited, and waited. The next time I got his attention, I reminded him that I was still waiting to pay for the bill, and let him know that the food was terrible. He told me he would get the manager. As you may have guessed, that took a while but it was crowded so I get it. She did immediately zero out our charges, but she really wasn't interested in anything I had to say. I was trying to give her feedback (very politely) to help, but she was hearing none of it. Worse than that, she had an attitude. She insisted that the soda/ water pouring (bar back? - I don't know what that was) person behind the bar was a second bartender after I suggested that they needed more staff on FATHER'S DAY. Anyway, I gave up on giving constructive feedback after it became clear that the manager didn't want to hear it, and wasn't going to do anything to improve the situation. It really was the worst dining experience I've had in a LONG time. Unfortunately, Red Rooster has been steadily slipping for about a year and a half now. A few months ago, my friend got severely undercooked chicken.It's too bad, because the food and the service really were excellent for the first couple of years it was open. I don't ever see Marcus Samuelsson there anymore, so that may be why it's slipping.At any rate, I don't think I will ever go back at this point.",1,0,0,Debby A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0

It was listed short ribs as the first ingredient on the menu and when my dish arrived, it was a plate of nachos tossed in tomatillo sauce with scrambled eggs.

Jamaican husband approved. We did not like the Aunt Maybel's lamb dumplings at all. They lacked flavor. When the server, Fabiola, asked how was everything and we told her we didn't like the dumplings, she said ""oh"" and walked away. The runner came and took our non-eaten plate and asked how was it.

Their Mac and greens which was an amazing Mac and cheese with Swiss chard mixed in. The chard waa stirfried with a faint maple syrup which was the perfect accent to the savory bite of cheeses.  We also got an order of cornbread cause really you can't have southern without corn bread. It was served with a sweet butter and a tomato jam(which is loads different from ketchup)  Service- 5/5 was great really really quick, friendly and attractive ;)  The staff had a great energy!

When we ordered dessert, the description did not match what was delivered. When we pointed that out to the waitress, she merely took it away. No apology. No offer to bring us another dessert.

I was told it would be a twenty five minute wait for outside seating and forty minutes to an hour wait for inside seating. I settled on waiting for a outside table since the weather was pleasant. I got my grandmother a seat at the outdoor bench and came back inside with my thirteen month old daughter in-hand to order a beer for the wait. The bar maybe had fifteen guest including a couple with a stroller around my daughters age (this is not a lot of people at this bar) and was being attended to by two bartenders. I stood there for five or so minutes being ignored till I finally got the bartenders attention, she could not tell me what beers she had on draught. At this moment the host approaches me and aggressively tells me that I can't have my daughter in my arms while standing at the bar ordering a beer. As a veteran NYC beverage director I know this is not true and that I was not putting the bar's liquor license in jeopardy as told by this host. At this point I had enough of feeling like the establishment was doing me a favor at stopping by for brunch. I collected my family and left! I went across the street to Corner Social where I was greeted warmly and with smiles and we had a delicious brunch at a fraction of the cost of Red Rooster.

Being a fan of both fried chicken and Marcus Samuelsson, Red Rooster was the first stop. Before I get into the review, I have to clarify that the drinks were AMAZING. The Harlem Mule was delicious. ANYWAY. Not only was the restaurant under construction; which limited space and caused tons of noise - but the menu was cut in half. They advertise delicious tacos and chicken and waffles, among other things - dishes I had been desperate to try. They were eliminated from the menu. I tried the cornbread, and I come from a southern family, so I know cornbread. It felt distinctly old - hardened in a way that indicated it had been sitting out for some time. The service was abysmal - it took us an hour to have one drink and one appetizer - 20 minutes alone to get our check - and it was NOT busy. We were one of maybe 4 parties and there were at least 6 servers on the patio. Either way, I feel like I just found out Santa isn't real. I admire Chef Samuelsson so much and his grace and skill on screen did not translate in his restaurant. I was so profoundly disappointed.

The grits mix mash underneath lacked any kind of flavour profile nor an ability to mask the fish's brine. Highly disappointing. 0/5 starsYardbird - crispy enough and with the syrup drizzle wasn't bad (what wouldn't?) other than the skin looking like they were overdue changing the deep fryer oil. The collard green ratatouille underneath seemed like an unnecessary way to fancy up a dish that should be simple. 3/5 starsSide order of biscuits - even the honey butter couldn't compensate for how dry it was.

The music level is perfect as you navigate between it and the crowd noise. There is also outdoor seating that was popping when I went with good people and good weather My reason for 3 stars is the food I ate. While the cornbread was delicious, the other side we ordered were not worth the cost. $9 for a small order of French fries, and the wild winds were not tasty at all. The mac and greens were good but only a handful for the price. The bottom line is that it is a great place to go with friends after work but I would eat elsewhere if you are just coming to hang. I'll add that I did not have the entrees which looked good, so my food comments are directed toward the appetizers and cost of them.

4.0,5/23/2017,"The food was absolutely incredible. We went with a party of 7 and everyone raved about their meals. I was the only vegetarian in the group and was actually able to find a lot to eat, even though the main entrees are not vegetarian/vegan. I highly recommend the mac and cheese, corn bread, sweet potato soup and the donuts. The succotash was good as well. The server was friendly and knowledgeable but definitely slow on service and forgot to bring a refill for my iced tea, not a big deal, but little things like that can add up. The reasons I am downgrading to 4 - they wouldn't seat us until exactly 1pm, our reservation time. We got there at 12:40/12:45 and we didn't mind waiting a bit but we went back, I checked my watch, at 12:58 and they said we had to wait until 1. I thought they were kidding but they made us wait about 90 more seconds to take us to our seats. Then, the wait times for apps was nearly an hour and our drinks came afterwards. There was another long wait that I didn't time between our apps and our meals. After being seated, we were there a total of 2.5 hours for lunch, and not because we're a chatty group. They did bring out complimentary corn bread when my meal was delayed even longer than the rest of our party and then again they brought out mini donuts to apologize for all of the waits at the end, so that was nice. All in all, I would recommend and I would go back but I would also love them to read this for the feedback about the service to take into consideration.

4.0,5/19/2017,"I will admit that I got sucked into the hype.  I told my husband to bring me here as a Mother's Day lunch the day after Mother's Day (Monday) because Lord knows there was nothing available for the actual Mother's Day.  Even though we got there 20 minutes early we still had to wait for our 1:00p.m. reservation.  We were seated at 1:07p.m.Food Breakdown:For appetizers we had the crab fritters and cornbread and it was outta this world.  The crab fritters sauce had a spicy kick to it (it should come with a warning about that for people who are not into that kind of thing) and the cornbread had little bits of actual corn kernels in it.  It was served with butter and tomato jam but skip the tomato jam.  As for beverages my husband had soda and I had the Harlem Punch which gets the Goldilocks Award because it was just right.  It wasn't just juice and it wasn't straight up alcohol.  I would have had another one if I didn't spend $36 already without getting to the entrees yet.Speaking of entrees, we both decided to have the famous Yard Birds and taste-wise, it really did live up to the hype but it was much smaller than what I thought it would be.  Pictures are misleading.  Even my pictures cannot conveys how skinny this meat is.  The Yard Birds came with sweet potato puree and collard greens.  This is my third time tasting collard greens and I have discovered that I am not a collard greens person so I can't really give an opinion regarding that.  Thank goodness we ordered a side of Mac N' Cheese and I was pleasantly surprised.  It was not too soupy or too cheesy but be warned that it is mixed with a little bit of collard greens.Finally for dessert, I had the Banana Pudding and I found it a little sweet for me but also pleasantly surprised again considering I am not a banana dessert person.  My husband did not have dessert.  I think he could not afford to spend one more dollar here.Pros:-Great tasting, flavorful food.  Will not be disappointed.-Good service.-Wonderful atmosphere and environment.  The place is nicely decorated and there is a lot to look at while waiting for your food.Cons:-Very touristy...let's get real, this is not ""real Harlem.""  Normal Harlem folk can't afford to eat here.-For a soul food place there was no pie on the menu for dessert.  But they have donuts...because when people think of Harlem food, they think of donuts.-The bathrooms are adorably cute but there is only two separate unisex room stalls for the whole restaurant.  Come on!  Alcohol serving restaurant with only two stalls.  There should be a movement for this.-TOO EXPENSIVE: crab fritter appetizers is $17; cornbread appetizer is $6.00; 2 yard birds a whopping total of $56.00!; Harlem Punch alcoholic drink was $13.00; Mac N' Cheese was a side but $10.00 and desert was $12.00.  Everything including tip for 2 people was $150.00!!!!!  This is outrageous.Tips:Reservations highly recommended.Observations:Don't come here for a salad!  You can get a salad anywhere in New York and it will be just as expensive.Conclusion:Great food, wonderful experience but too expensive to come back again.",4,0,0,Bronx B.,"Bronx, NY",2,61,17

2.0,5/8/2017,"Coming here was on my bucket list.  So imagine my excitement when in my recent visit to NY last month, this was our very first stop.  It was during lunch hour on a weekday so getting a table was no problem, although even then there was a nice sized crowd.  The restaurant in and of itself was very eclectic and the atmosphere felt great.  We had our 15 month old daughter with us and everyone was in there eating her up so we made a lot of friends.  That's kinda where the excitement ended for us.  The food was very underwhelming.  For an appetizer, we have the crab balls (or croquettes; forget what they were called) but they tasted more like salmon than crab.  For an entree, I had catfish with crab meat and my fiance had the infamous fried chicken.  My dish was flavorful, but again the crab was lacking and my fiance's chicken was under cooked.  Coming from MD, our disappointment in the dishes featuring crab is one thing, but uncooked chicken is clearly something else entirely.  The drinks were disappointing as well.  One, we were not told that there were no free refills (we had regular and mint lemonade) and two, I specifically ordered mint lemonade and it was no more than regular lemonade with a sprig of mint floating at the top; I tasted no mint at all.  Nothing was muddled and added in to give this drink a true mint flavor.  To add, the lemonade didn't appear to be freshly squeezed; another disappointment.  In most cases, I only order water wherever I go, so that, with my ""mint lemonade"" was enough for me, but my fiance kicked back at least 3 or 4 lemonades not knowing he'd be charged for each one; imagine our surprise when the bill came.  We didn't dispute or make a fuss, but good customer service warrants a notification to patrons that there are no free refills, even if it's on certain drinks; we shouldn't have had to ask, although I wish we had.  For us when the service is great, but the food is lacking, we will return, to try other dishes and hope for the best.  But the food was just so disappointing that we can't justify coming back.",0,0,0,Christal W.,"Lanham, MD",1,60,4

2.0,5/2/2017,"Overhyped*.  The food is tasty, but the menu is less compelling & more expensive than it was when I first fell in love with the 'hood.  Service has gone downhill.I get that ""atmosphere"" is part of the appeal, but they've taken it too far over the last year.  It converts to a high-octane club earlier in the evening (and on more days of the week) than before, ruining it for locals who just want a nice meal.  The waitstaff also seem to have shifted focus, and not in a good way: while their uniform styling has gotten more & more outlandish (insert joke about ""pieces of flair""), their knowledge of & care for the actual product has gone way down.  Twice now I've had guys who seemed to have been pressed into service for the weekend rush w/o any training about what's on the menu.As for said menu, the overall ""upscale soul"" concept is intact, but some old favorites have disappeared without adequate replacement.  In particular, I have to call out the lack of carb-y options on the brunch menu.  I'm an eggs-for-breakfast type myself, but for most of my dining companions, it simply doesn't count as brunch until the pancakes/muffins/etc have arrived and been drenched in some kind of syrup.  To this end, Red Rooster used to serve a killer french toast dish (topped with chocolate ""gravy""), among others...where have all those options gone?  The closest equivalent is the Yardbird & waffles, but even that trends toward the savory -- in a good way, IMO, but not one that will satisfy a sweet tooth.Bottom line: they do not deserve the crowds clogging up our sidewalk nor the queue of double-parked cabs blocking our street.  For a better execution of the same upscale fusion vibe, please patronize The Cecil instead.  For equally good South-inspired food w/o the pretentious vibe & pricing, try Boulevard Bistro.  For authenticity (and way less $$), prefer Sylvia's or Jacob's or anywhere else really.  This place has always flirted with bougie bullshit, but now it's gone off the rails.*2.75 stars, rounded down due to effusive grade inflation from tourists",9,3,3,Richard B.,"New York, NY",152,43,0

Now on to the food.I got the chicken and waffles, and split the mac and greens, corn bread, and collard greens with the table. The mac and greens were delicious and packed a solid amount of flavor. The consistency was great and there was enough cheesy gooeyness for me to enjoy. The corn bread was good as well, more cakey than I'm use to, but delicious nonetheless. The collar greens were flavorful, but were on the saltier side. I feel a bit conflicted about the chicken and waffles. The chicken was great, good crusting, juicy in the middle, had plenty of flavor. The waffle on the other hand left me a bit disappointed. Personally, I felt as though it needed to be less light and needed to be thicker and heavier.

So cool! We had reservations, which I highly recommend, and we're seated immediately, even though it was Easter and there was a line of people anxiously waiting for tables.

I checked the schedule and it looks like that's the norm every day/night with the singers changing daily! It was wonderful and I can't wait to return to hear the next set!We had service as soon as we sat and had many fun drinks to choose from. I picked a mix of a Bloody Mary and a beer, and my table mates got a spicy beer, a regular Bloody Mary and a gin drink with grapes muddled in it that she loved!Then...ooh! The deviled eggs. We ordered 2 orders because you get 3 halves in an order and with the 4 of us, we were about ready to fight over who got to double up! They sat in this spread that we kept tasting and couldn't figure out- so we asked and it's fried chicken skin ground down to a paste! Seriously they need to bottle that!Next, we couldn't pass up the yardbird (fried chicken) and 2 got it with waffles and 2 with collards and sweet potatoes!

My french toast was very dry, literally dry slices of walnut & raisin bread. I ate a quarter of it and gave up. The apples were really good, but there were maybe only 6 little pieces of that. Our table of 4 had 3 disappointed peeps, 1 who was happy had the chicken and waffles. The gravy that came with the chicken and waffles was really good. Needed salt and pepper and 2 different waiters had to hunt for it because supposedly the restaurant only has 1 set, that took a few minutes after the food was already out. Coffee was mediocre and kinda old tasting. The brunch menu is VERY limited, maybe 6 or 7 items and on the high side. The atmosphere was fun, live music/singing, although it's fairly dark and very loud inside, plus you cannot see the band because of how everything is set up. You can only see them from the bar. Outside area seemed really nice, but you cannot hear any music there. It's like 2 different places. Wait was TWO hours, is what we were told.

They promised to make it right and gave us a couple of free desserts - which we appreciated and enjoyed. Our entrees - Fried Yardbird, Shrimp & Grits, Two-Five Strip Steak and Low Country Cat(fish) - were all good, but somehow just missed the mark and felt like assembly line, hype-fulfilling efforts.  By the end of the meal we simply didn't feel like we'd gotten real value from the not-inexpensive experience.

I think where it missed the mark for both my friend and me was the food. I had the double smash burger and she had the salmon. My burger was tasteless and frankly the meat tasted a bit stale. My friends salmon on the other hand was salty and overseasoned. So the food just wasn't its strong point. Overall, I think I would go back for drinks and maybe even for dancing, but we won't be back for the food.",0,0,0,Annette R.,"Manhattan, NY",3,12,0
5.0,4/12/2017,"OMG! What's not to love?! Have you seen this place? I was bought and sold with the ambiance, frickin' amazing decor, and copper bar top alone! But don't worry, I controlled myself enough to make a fair assessment. Final decision: Red Rooster is my jam! I wish I could transplant it to Florida for happy hours with the girls! They'd love it here! Mom and I stopped in, whilst on a Harlem day stroll, for craft cocktails a few hours before our dinner reservation elsewhere. She'd said something about this place being owned by a famous chef on Food Network so, we decided to give it a whirl! When in Harlem, right?! Once I arrived, I wished we'd decided to stay and dine. Yohan, our bartender, was excellent and offered great recommendations for us. We opted for a Moscow Mule, the Obamatini, the Rooster Punch, and Jam Jar (THEY HAVE JAM JAAAARRRR!!)! ... OMG! Yohan's cocktails were killer, and oh-so crafty! (Just the way I like 'em!)But, get this! ... While sitting at the bar, Teresa, the kindest woman known to man approached and said hi! We chatted, talked about Florida,  I told her we were in town for my Mom's birthday, and then she basically disappeared. Yep, it all happened so fast. She disappeared-- only to return with cake, a flare, and a personalized message on said cake; while clapping and singing happy birthday! I mean, really? Who does that? After the impromptu celebration, I found out that Teresa is the executive pastry chef at Red Rooster (which made it all the more special, because I'm sure she's a busy girl and the thought of her randomly coming up to me at the bar to be kind and just say hi-- right?!) At that point, ""my cup runneth over!"" EXCELLENT people, and excellent time at Red Rooster Harlem! Who could ask for anything more?!",84,46,82,Juliet H.,"Mobile, AL",5001,829,6881

4.0,4/8/2017,"I typically don't waste time writing a full length review for a place that already has over 1,000 reviews because unless you know me, you are probably never going to see this anyway.  Nevertheless, I did want to throw down some thoughts about Red Rooster which I had the pleasure of eating at for the first time last night.So when I first walked in, I was a bit shocked to see how packed the place was.  This was a Monday night at 7:00 pm. - not exactly your heavy traffic period -- but I guess the normal rules don't apply at Red Rooster.   The bar which is situated at the front of the place was packed.  There were no seats available and I would have had to break through a few lines of defense in order to get the bar tender's attention, so I didn't bother.   The amount of the people in the room - and the diversity of the crowd - let me know that this was someplace special.  People in suits were as common as people in jeans.  It was quite a sight. When my GF showed up at about 7:25, we made our way to the hostess stand and advised them that we were there for our 7:30 reservation.  Fortunately our table was ready for us.The wait staff quickly arrived to take care of our drink orders and present us with our menus.  A few moments later they returned to ask if we had any questions ----  we didn't because everything looked great!For our meal - we ordered the corn bread (self explanatory ) and the Harlem Mess (double fries ranch fries, beef chili and melted cheese curds) as our appetizers.    Both was amazing.  For dinner we had the Shrimp and Grits (self explanatory) and Helga's Meatballs (consisting of braised cabbage, fried red potatoes and bacon-lingonberry jam).  ---  again amazing.We also ordered a side of the Mac & Greens (Mac, cheddar , Parmesan and Collard Greens)What can I say other than the food and service here is fantastic.  We were completely stuffed by the end and unfortunately didn't have any room left for desserts.  Hopefully we make it there on the next trip.If I have one complaint about Red Rooster it's the ambiance ---  the place is extremely noisy and the tables are all very close to another. You have music playing through the speakers and you can hear everyone talking as one big glob of sound.  I had to ask my girlfriend to repeat herself on multiple occasions because I honestly couldn't make out what she was saying.  I will never understand why creating this type of atmosphere has become so popular.  Whatever happened to dining in a place where you can actually have a real conversation?   I guess I'm just old fashioned in that regard. Overall however I loved this place and both my girlfriend and I agreed that we will definitely be back.",3,1,1,Marc L.,"Sea Bright, NJ",21,463,395
3.0,4/5/2017,"I've been twice.The first time for a Vogue private event where we had the entire bottom floor. It was beautiful, we even had a live jazz band. Marcus Samuelsson was there to greet us & chatted with us for a little bit. Dinner was fantastic, open bar with fabulous drinks. The second time was with my hubby & another couple. It was a bit of a nightmare. We had reservations but we ended up waiting for an hour before we were seated. There was a live jazz band playing which was fantastic, but very loud if you're waiting by the bar area. Also, it was very crowded, so it took a while to get drinks. Such a hassle in a trendy restaurants like this & there was no one there to do crowd control. Chaos!Both times, food was Aaamazing! We had the chicken & waffles and the signature fried yard bird. Waffles was crunchy on the outside & moist on the inside. Fried chicken was fabulous, the best fried chicken intown. Perfectly fried & delicious. The mashed potato is so tasty, yummy. We also tried the mac & cheese and the street corn both delish!!! This place is expensive but the food is worth it. The food is 5 stars. Food for the soul! But there's no excuse for making your paid customers wait an hour after their reservation. Have respect for your customers time. I don't care if you're a hot spot or not. Also, it was chaotic & crowded at the bar area with everyone waiting for their late tables for an hour. Not what you want to see at an expensive restaurant.

5.0,3/26/2017,"Let's clear up some common misunderstandings held by some Yelp reviewers about the Red Rooster.First, Red Rooster is not the typical soul food restaurant. True, it has fried chicken and cornbread but it is so much more... a varied menu offering, an important community resource, and a great entertainment center.Second, prices are entirely reasonable when you consider the quality of the food, the welcome, and the live music, jazz in the restaurant and gospel singing in the downstairs club on Sundays.Cornbread, deviled eggs, and chicken sausage were excellent starters.Our main dishes included the Fried Yardbird and the Chicken & Waffles which both had some of the best chicken I've ever had... meaty, tender and perfectly cooked. I only wish that the seasoning had included more berbere, the Ethiopian spice mix that the Chef has popularized through his early cookbooks and which is a staple in my kitchen.Our visit went easily to the five-star level based on the fabulous teen-age gospel choir performance at the Sunday brunch in the downstairs Ginny's Supper Club.Just imagine... terrific food, reasonable prices, attentive service, and Broadway-quality performers.

5.0,3/21/2017,"My hats off to Chef Samuelson for a delicious meal! We made reservations for 3 for Saturday dinner at 6 pm, which is highly recommended as the wait time was 1.5 hours without.Being cold and dreary outside, we decided to order a feast and started with the Marcus' Cornbread and the Winter Vegetable Gumbo. The Cornbread had a denser texture than your typical cornbread and tasted more like cake. But the tomato jam paired nicely. The Gumbo was sadly nothing to rave about. I wished that it would have come out piping hot as the lukewarm temperature did not offer that respite from the cold outside. The collared greens were so-so as well. I wished that it would provide more of a flavor kick or a textural contrast.The stars of the evening were The Low Country Cat and the Fried Brussels Sprouts. The jerked catfish was so flavorful and tender. While I could not discern the lump crab, the cracked Carolina rice and the llama beans were in a decadent, tangy, and sweet sauce, all perfumed ever so slightly by the fresh cilantro. Needless to say, I wiped this dish clean!The Brussels Sprouts were fried to perfection! It wasn't greasy at all but super crispy with a light char. It was dressed lightly in a bourbon barrel aged fish sauce, which balanced out the fish sauce to the oak flavor. I also tried the Meatballs, which was stellar! Very moist and hearty, my boyfriend loved this dish.Finally, we finished with the Supa Sundae, which the description does not do it justice! It starts out with a coffee crunch on top with some kind of a shortbread/wafer/granola in the center while being enveloped in berries and cream, mascarpone ice cream, and a cherry sauce. The bruleed banana was so tasty as well.What a memorable meal! I can't wait to come back.",6,2,4,Jenny P.,"Arlington, VA",231,723,753

What I received was a shitty burger that you could buy for $6 at a greasy spoon diner.The bun was mushy and wrinkly as if it had just been microwaved. The toppings were squashed beneath the burger, creating a soggy mess. The fries were undercooked, and barely seasoned.  Take a look at the picture advertised and my picture.

2.0,3/15/2017,"I have been a patron of Red Rooster since it opened in 2010.  After several visits not of my choice I must say that the restaurant is overrated.  The only dish I have ever enjoyed here is this shrimp and grits.  The yardbird has always been hard, dry, and bland.  I've never experienced a meal here where I or the individuals I was dining with were truly satisfied.  The cocktails are mediocre and I've seen much more creative mixology elsewhere.  The rage is all about the ""bar scene"" which leaves a lot to be desired.  Unfortunately what makes this restaurant so unbearable is the pretentiousness of the patrons.  If you really want to enjoy this restaurant go before the sunsets and avoid dealing with Harlem's self appointed elite class that push each other at the bar and scream in each other's ears.  I've seen better social graces at a baseball game then I have at this place.  Harlem is full of wonderful restaurants where civility is the norm and grandiosity is not, perhaps check some other place out before coming here.",0,0,0,Joshua H.,"New York, NY",72,25,4

I understand they needed to turn tables but if I made a reservation way in advance, I don't expect to be kicked out by the hostess. On top of that, the service was incredibly slow. Our waitress barely came to give us menus, and we had major delays getting drinks throughout the whole meal. She basically stopped showing up at the table while we were being served. We waited over a half hour between finishing our meals and getting offered dessert menus.  It was so slow that once we had been there for two hours, a man that looked like the manager came to see if we needed coffee or dessert.

The cornbread was hard itself the side sauce would have been great with the right cornbread. The mac and greens could have been more tasty and flavorful. It was trash. What was the turn off was the beer sauce they put on the chicken and waffle nasty, I hated it and by that time I was ready to leave, and to top that there were bits of stuff floating in my and my fiancés water.

After almost a two hour commute (1 hr car ride and another hour on 3 different trains) just to get there we got to the restaurant. We waited a while at the bar to get drinks but that was OK. The hostess and the manager at the restaurant were very nice and pleasant and this is why you are getting one star and I wish they had a separate rating for service and food because you would get ZERO.Our waiter came to our table to take the order, never asked if wanted drinks and asked us if we wanted some cornbread for the table and we said yes, in fact we said yes to cornbread twice never knowing that we were going to be charge six dollars for two pieces of cornbread for a total $12, I would think your waiters would inform your customers that there is a charge for the cornbread and seriously six dollars for two slices of cornbread that's a little absurd!Our appetizers came and they were  good and then we waited for dinner for 30 minutes. The waiter never came once to tell us where the food was and when he finally did come he said it's being plated now just as a server behind him was bringing it to our table. My husbands dinner was fine but only just fine for a 36$ entrée but both of my orders were terrible, the macaroni and cheese greens was so cold that the cheese on top of it was congealed. I also ordered the chicken and waffle, the chicken was completely overcooked and dry and what's with the half of a waffle? The waiter never came back to see how everything was and when he did and I told him how bad my food was, I never even touched the mac, it was so gross looking and I had only taken one bite of the chicken, he didn't even seem like he cared. Instead of offering me something else he said, well I'll get the manager, the manager came over she was very pleasant and told me that she was embarrassed the way that food was served to me and apologized for the waiter and the kitchen. The waiter was not on the ball that night the table next to us ordered appetizers and got their meal first, so it just wasn't us.Since it was my husband's birthday the manager gave him dessert on the house and me a glass of Prosecco which I appreciated but it didn't cure how hungry and angry I was when I left your restaurant. The night was ruined we spent a lot of money for just drinks and add dinner and transportation to get to your place it's an expensive night but the part that annoyed me was traveling 2 hours for lousy service and poor food.

1.0,2/22/2017,"THE MANAGEMENT DOES NOT RETURN CALLS OR EMAILSI have been a patron of Red Rooster since opened in 2010.  I frequented the restaurant for dinner many times, for cocktails/small bites and on occasion - Ginny's Supper Club on the lower level.I've always enjoyed the atmosphere, the eclectic nature of cuisine and the cocktails. However an experience I had late-night on Thursday December 22, 2016 left me with a terrible impression of Red Rooster's management. Thursday December 22, 2016, 6pm: I meet my friend at Red Rooster for  pre-concert small bites and cocktails at the bar.  We leave about 2 hrs later to attend the concert.  Thursday December 22, 2016, 11pm:  We return to Red Rooster for nightcap cocktails at the bar and remain until last call.  Last call (which is sometime around midnight) I get up from the bar to use the restroom, placing my jacket (folding it) on my barstool. I come back  5 minutes later to find it gone, and immediately report it to the bartender who  then informs the manager Erik W. I explain to him it's a particular designer label, very intricate design and expensive.I call a car service, because I have no coat to wear home. The car arrives to pick me up, no sooner than few blocks from Red Rooster,  I get a call my jacket has  been found. I rush back to retrieve what I think is my jacket. I get home it late and I put the jacket in my closet nothing anything of it.  I got to work that Friday December 23 - when I come home - I look at the jacket and realize it's the same design, but not mine- it's very tattered/heavily worn/has pils all over the arms and has a cigarette lighter in the left pocket. Also my coat is a midnight navy (looks off black) and this coat is very dark black color. I take the coat back to Red Rooster Saturday December 24, early afternoon and leave word with a lady there to inform Erik W with my name and telephone number.  I also email him. I proceed to the 28th Precinct to file a police report and follow up to see if there is any camera evidence showing someone ""taking my coat"".I've sent several emails to Red Rooster, to Erik W and also mailed a letter.

2.0,2/22/2017,"We went to Red Rooster on President's Day based off good reviews my Cousin read about.  We were told there was a 10 minute wait which is extremely reasonable. But we waited 10 minutes for them to decide to push two tables together that were open when we got there.  We were seated in a glass wall inlet guarding the stairs.  It was a terrible spot as I elbowed the glass (ouch) and my daughters chair kept sliding into the glass.  We were sitting for 10 minutes before a waited came to acknowledge us and this took prodding on my end with the hostess.  And then we were unsure who our waiter was because we had 2 that kept coming to talk to us and even at the end we received two of the same bill from each wait person!  I had the chicken and waffles.  It was a half a waffle and limited meat inside the chicken. I had to say Sweet Chicks is so much better.  It was advertised as hot chicken but had barely any spice at all. It also came sitting on a weird green sauce that I was not alerted about- not a fan of that!  Also, no one came to check up on us about our food so I didn't get to ask for more syrup since they were not very generous with it.  With a 5 year old with us, this menu was a challenge to order anything for her!  I would not go back here again.",0,0,0,Holly W.,"Lincoln, RI",24,356,371

2.0,2/17/2017,"This was our second visit to Red Rooster and we were quite disappointed. Now with 1 drink, 1 app, 1 entree our check average was around $60 per person for a frame of reference. I'll start with the pros; the ambiance was fantastic, the service was on point, cornbread changed my life and the cocktails were delicious. The hostess was also organized professional and got us seated in a timely manner. The reason I felt this experience was 2 stars was solely from the entrees and at this price point there needs to be improvements . The two entrees were the strip steak and the pork chop. The strip steak had no seasoning to the meat. The plate was served simply with the steak and some roasted potatoes. The presentation was extremely poor and the plate overall was extremely bland. To be fair it was cooked perfectly but from my experience it was a low quality cut of meat. The pork chop overall was a better composed dish then the strip steak. The red cabbage was fantastic on the plate and complemented well adding a burst of flavor. Again it tasted as if there was zero seasoning which was disappointing considering that the cut also appeared to be of low quality. Overall I think there is so much untapped potential that can be attained here. At the price point the quality of the meats needs to be held to a higher standard. I highly recommend the strip steak plate be recreated or 86d from the menu. The presentation doesn't need to be fancy but at least make the meal appear more appetizing. Steps of service need to be reviewed and fine tuned.",0,0,0,Jack K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0

Red rooster is reflective of his passion and genius but there are a few things that were surprising.I'll talk about the positives first.The staff is diverse and that is heartening. The decor and ambience is sunny, rich, colorful and inviting, similar to the food :)I tried the red rooster scramble, the corn bread and the French toast The scramble has a LOT of cream in it. Too much I'd say and it is difficult to taste the subtle egg and seasoning flavors being overwhelmed by the cream. It may have been just my batch but will have to try again and see if that's a consistent issue.The French roast is soft, fragrant and delicious and really doesn't even need syrup (a bit on the v sweet side).The corn bread though is a must try! Soft, aromatic, super fresh. The honey butter also is unique and goes well with the corn bread.

1.0,1/26/2017,"I will preface this by saying this rating is not based on the food. I LOVE the food at Red Rooster and the lively environment, so when my sister made her first appearance on late night tv last night we wanted to celebrate and I thought Red Rooster would be perfect. I made a reservation for 8pm and we had a party of 5. Two of us arrived at 8 but the other three were running late. The hostess could not seat us until everyone arrived, totally understand that if it's your policy. I personally don't get the policy bc we would have ordered drinks while we waited especially since seating around the bar was all taken. But no big deal. When the rest of our party arrived we informed the hostess who asked us to wait, did not give any indication how long we would wait. After about 20 min one person from our party asked her how much longer our wait would be. Her response ""I don't know, your party was 35 min late"" with a really bad attitude. When asked so you have no idea how long it will take she says ""no"", again with attitude. We get we were late, that happens sometimes and we had no problem waiting but just an idea of how much longer was not unreasonable especially since as a hostess your job is to estimate waits and to be friendly. 10 more minutes passed and we asked again and got the same response and attitude. At that point we decided to leave because she was so rude. We left to go to a another spot and the service was fantastic! 10 minutes after we left Red Rooster I received a text that our table was ready which means when we asked the hostess how long the wait would be the table where they were going to seat us had their check and she could have just said the wait should not be too long.

We hovered for not too long before we got seats at the bar. I ordered a classic drink called ""Savoy"" because it was happy hour. It was really good! It was sweet but you could still get a hint of vodka. I appreciate tasting some of the liquor in drinks because I want to know that there's actually liquor in it. (AFTERNOON MENU) Me and my friend ordered a bunch of small dishes to try many foods. We got cornbread, mac & greens, wild wild wings, and mashed potatoes. Everything was so good, but my favorite had to be the wings. They were done just so right--a good kick, crispy, saucy, etc. Mashed potatoes were as creamy as they get. I loved the tomato jam that came with the cornbread. The mac & greens were delicious too. I really have no complaints other than it's a bit pricey.The atmosphere is great.

Our waiter would zip by us and not even acknowledge when we were attempting to get his attention. I saw that the fried chicken was amazing, but it isn't even an entree option, so I just had to order it with some sides and make my own meal. (that kinda irritated me) However, the chicken was really good and the my co-workers fish of the day was amazing. But another party member ordered the chicken wings and was not pleased at all.  The menu needs more options.

However, as much of a fan as I am of Samuelson, I will not be coming back for the food- I will come for the vibe. The price point and quality of the dishes seem to be at odds with one another. I had the shrimp and grits. Honestly, I could have probably made it better myself. The ham in the dish seemed like a soggy add on. The shrimp had no real seasoning or flavor and the grits were really poorly done. They were just soggy- the consistency was not good and they tasted like cheap instant grits that were underdone. I was very disappointed in my meal. For a $30 entree, I was unimpressed. I'd say it was just that particular entree, but someone I was with had the was duly unimpressed with her entree- an appetizer size entree with a high price point.

I went to Red Rooster for dinner on a Thursday night and this place is poppin'. Great vibe, great mix of people, and great waiters. The hostess acted like she couldn't be bothered by us since we were late for our reservation, but we tried to call hours ahead to have it moved back because I was stuck at work. But hey, we were late, I wasn't going to make this a big deal!We started with a nice appetizer spread. The cornbread, crab bread, and the chicken from the chicken and waffles appetizer were PHENOMENAL! The waffle I didn't like, but everyone else in my party did. It seemed mealy and wet to me so I wasn't a fan. The biscuits were alright, I wouldn't order them again because the cornbread is just way better, but the chicken liver jam was definitely something new and exciting to try. All the appetizers had a spin on classical dishes and weren't just another restaurant's version of an old classic. So having food that I felt i had never tasted but really enjoyed made this experience great. The dinner entrees we ordered were the lamb and dumplings entree and the shrimp and grits. The portions are generous without being overwhelming. The shrimp in the shrimp and grits were huge! The shrimp and grits weren't the best I've had (but i""m biased because I make the best shrimp and grits, but fiancbae still likes to try when we go out!). The lamb and dumplings entree was different so we ordered it and it was an above average entree. The sauce was uniquely flavorful, the ricotta wasn't overwhelming, it had African spices and yet the simplicity of Scandinavian food came through still. The dumplings were alright, I didn't love their texture, but the lamb was falling apart and melts in your mouth. There were quite a few fatty pieces on my plate and I wish that weren't the case, but aside from that everything was great. We also tried the mac and greens which was a mac and cheese dish with grandma's collard greens baked right in. now I wouldn't think to do this, but I'm glad that Marcus Samuelson decided to have this side at his restaurant.

I rated Red Rooster three stars because the restaurant itself was clean and well decorated, I was seated immediately upon arrival, the bar/bartenders at the front entrance were amazing and service was friendly and not rushed.  With respect to the food, it is edible at best (and highly overrated). As a party of 2, we ordered the Deviled Eggs, Cornbread and Fried Green Tomatoes to start. The eggs were so salty (and I enjoy salt) to the point that we were unable to eat them. The Fried Green Tomatoes were flavorless (dipping sauces were fairly well done) and cornbread was just OK (Amy Ruth's serves a better cornbread). For entrees we ordered the Fried Yardbird and the Shrimp and Grits. The Shrimp & Grits was hearty and had good flavor, but I have definitely had better (for a cheaper price).  Then Yardbird was actually unacceptable. The chicken skin appeared to be crispy, but it was actually battered to death and fried to a burnt crisp. I began to peel it off hoping for juicy chicken underneath, but instead, the chicken was flavorless and rubbery.  After two bites, I couldn't eat it anymore. The sides (greens & mashed potatoes) were tasty, but nothing to write home about.  The Fried chicken should have been the star of the dish, but it totally fell flat.

I always have a great time, it's an added bonus when you run into Marcus Samuelsson. The times I've eaten at Red Rooster, I have gotten the Chicken and waffles. I've also tried the truffles for desert and of course the corn bread. I must say the food is on point. Upon eating there for the first time, a girlfriend and me sat next to two guys visiting New York for a business trip, they ordered the hugest ribs I've ever seen big enough to share, that they did, they were delicious.

2.0,1/2/2017,"Three of us went here at 5:30 pm on a Tuesday night. We were off to a bad start when, after being seated, we were ignored by the wait staff for over 15 minutes. Then, it took over 30 minutes to get cocktails to our table-- ""the bartenders are real busy,"" we were told. Remember, this was a Tuesday night. As for the food, I love everything, my significant other is super-picky, and the third person is a vegetarian who avoids fats and dairy. So, I loved my food: I got the brown butter biscuit (with chicken liver butter, and chunky ginger-chicken jam) as an appetizer, and the shrimp and grits for the main course. I was very happy. My significant other got the  much-touted $26 Helga's Meatballs, said to be a  specialty of the chef-owner's grandmother, and did not find it special, or worth $26. The vegetarian got the ""Upstate to Uptown"" salad, and was quite happy. So, two out of three of us liked our meal, but the service was real slow overall, and on a Tuesday night. Really, if we had gotten our cocktails 30 minutes sooner, we might have even ordered a second set, but hey. Finally, we wanted to try the beers on tap with our dinner, which were listed both on the online and printed menus, but our waitress told us there were in fact no beers on tap available. Have to add, the noise level was so high, I could not hear what anyone was saying, including the waitress.

4.0,12/30/2016,"I wanted to love this place because of Marcus Samuelsson's origins as an African who grew up cooking and enjoying Scandinavian cuisine at Aquavit.  However, I can probably find better soul food to comfort me at a lower price.  The yardbird chicken is juicy and tender inside, but the cornmeal crust was overcooked to a burnt crisp.  The fried brussel sprouts would have been addictive with its sweet sauce had it not been for the saltiness and being fried to the point of a black crisp.  I wish I had larger portions of gravy to dip the chicken in.  The sides of mashed potatoes and pickled greens were solid, but just nothing to rave about.  The seats are tiny along with wobbly tables.  So, try not to carry too much stuff or bring a hook for your bags.  Lines move quickly and the staff is helpful.  I wish I could give it 3.5 stars, but being located in Harlem doesn't help unless the food is amazing enough to draw you there for the trek.  So, I'll have to come back and try the other items (e.g., pot pie, meatballs, dumplings) on the menu.",2,0,0,Jenny L.,"Millbrae, CA",181,994,983

This was one of those dishes that reminds you about everything food can be: unpretentious, bursting with flavor, perfectly cooked, and leaving you with a desire to lick the plate.  I've eaten a lot of chicken and waffles in my time, all throughout the south, and this was the best I've ever had. They were simply incredible. After that great start, my high hopes were a wee bit deflated.  Aunt Helga's meatballs were perfectly good but lacked any pizazz. The tres leches cake wasn't really tres leches, but rather a pound cake with a milky frosting, saved by a few strategically-placed passion fruit seeds. The coffee and donuts were a stronger dessert, but I would have appreciated warm donuts, not room temperature ones. Service was average. Despite being Christmas Eve, there was no extra holiday cheer to be found. Our waiter was attentive, but very impersonal.

Finally came after like 20  minutes, we pretty much order drinks and food. Can't remember the drinks but we got the Fried Bird Royale. We were pretty excited since it was our first time going there and the restaurant owned by famous chef so the food had to be good.Well all of expectations was crush once we had the food. I don't know if they gave us a bad batch but I kid you not there wasn't an ounce of seasoning on they food. The chicken was dry and flavorless the mac wasn't that good either. So being someone that likes a lot more flavor than salt and pepper I had  to put on the food, I ask the waiter for hot sauce he ask how I preferred it, we told him hottest you got. After getting it hoping it would help with the no flavored food, the hot sauce tasted like salsa. I was like he messed up and probably gave me the one not that hot, so I told him and he said ok I'll get it for you, and came back with the same thing. Couldn't even finish my food.

My partner asked the waitress for hot sauce because the food was so bland and was told they didn't have any. The waitress said the chef wants customers to just use his hot sauce. The waitress brought the chef's hot sauce over to our table and it had garlic in it. My partner is allergic to garlic and pointed at the Sriracha and said to her why did you tell us you had no hot sauce and he wanted that instead because he is allergic to the garlic in the chef's hot sauce.

4.0,11/25/2016,"I'm in sales and one of my clients used to be in Harlem. On a whim one day, I stopped by Red Rooster and got take-out for my husband who loves soul food, fried chicken, and Chopped. I got a Yardbird for him (classic fried chicken,) and some mac & cheese for myself. OMG, we were blown away. So much so, that when we found ourselves bored on Black Friday, we decided to take a 160-mile round-trip drive for dinner.And we were not disappointed. Husband again had the Yardbird and I ordered the soy-glazed salmon. He devoured his chicken but, sadly, my salmon was far too salty. After the 2nd bite, my tongue was burning and my throat wanted to close up. Thank God we still had some of the awesome cornbread left. The waiter was very accommodating and switched my entrée out for herb-roasted chicken and that dish was perfect. Succulent is a weird word but the only one I can think of to describe the dish. 3 hours later and I'm still trying to process what ingredients were used to make those flavors. Service was amazing, attentive, and wonderfully friendly. I really don't like salt, so won't hold the salmon against them (although the soy crust and broth tasted like it was cooked and served in brine).  But the chicken was great, service was amazing, and their mac & cheese is to die for. Definitely worth the trip.  Oh, and I got a serving of mac & cheese to go for lunch tomorrow. Thanks, Chef Marcus!",0,1,1,Brigid F.,"Brick Township, NJ",5,46,0

3.0,11/25/2016,"I was so excited to come to New York and eat at Marcus Samuelson's restaurant. I have been waiting for this and made a special trip from AZ to New York just to eat at his restaurant. The service was stellar. Appetizers and cocktails were pretty good and what I would expect from his menu. The cornbread was fantastic! The best I've ever eaten. However, I and the other two people in my party were quite disappointed with the entrées. The mac & cheese with greens was pretty good. My son had the catfish which was good as well but nothing super spectacular. I had the famous Yardbird. What a disappointment. When I come to a restaurant and lay out $160 for lunch, I'm expecting something to really wow me. I want to eat food that I can't make myself.  The crispiness of the chicken was really great but it had absolutely no flavor. The two sauces that it came with weren't much help. The greens had absolutely no flavor whatsoever very bland and the mashed potatoes anyone could make. I first fell in love with Marcus Samuelson on Top Chef Masters. Watching him cook was like someone creating art. The way he described his flavors and the things that I saw him do with food I could almost taste how exquisite it was. I have followed him and read his book and he definitely has been one of my favorite chefs until now. Maybe if he had a little bit more of an upscale restaurant it would be different and I could enjoy the chef Samuelson that I have come to admire.   Overall, I don't think I would come back here and eat again.  So sad because I had been really looking forward to this for a very long time.  I really wanted to meet him and I'm so glad that he did not show up today. I would've hated to tell him to his face that the food was not all that great and I prefer the chicken and catfish at Cracker Barrel over Red Rooster.",0,0,0,Val J.,"Glendale, AZ",57,13,2

Brought my Mom here for lunch during her visit to NYC for Thanksgiving. From the moment we walked in we felt at home and cared for by the gorgeous staff. I had the soup and half sandwich (crispy bird) lunch special, and she had the prix fix, salad and catfish. We started off with some cornbread at the suggestion of our waiter. Both meals were just the right size for lunch and delish!  One caveat my soup wasn't all that special - I've had better apple and sweet potato soup, -- but everything else including the cornbread made up for it. The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is that we had an unusually long wait for our entrees - a bit annoying. But all in all a fantastic experience, keep up the good work!

My friends and I went for drinks and apps after spending a chilly night at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade Balloon Inflation event expecting phenomenal food and exceptional service; we got neither. First, the hostess Ashley was BEYOND rude; there was no space at the bar so when we asked to be seated in the dining area she curtly said, ""No, that's for dining only. There are open space tables by the bar, go there."" When I asked if we could be seated if we found no space and she looked me right in my eyes and said, ""NO.""Luckily, we found space sitting with some nice guys from Australia; the waiter came running towards us to stop us from sitting and told us that if we wanted to sit there we had to talk to the hostess...uh, hello? I thought it was an ""open space""??? We didn't feel very welcome, but we ordered anyways bc we figured the food would make up for the poor service.We ordered the Sweet Potato & Apple soup, the cornbread with a zesty tomato paste and honey butter, and deviled eggs. The eggs were DIVINE, we ordered them twice; however, they were WAY overpriced: $8 for an egg and a half..? But the soup was BEYOND BLAND, and the cornbread was tasty but DRY as a bone. A huge disappointment, especially for the price.The music was hot as they had a DJ and a live percussionist, but we weren't there for the music.

1.0,11/8/2016,"TL;DR: 3 star food, minus one star for not honoring reservation and one more for bad customer service after the fact.Ugh...I don't even know where to begin with the awkwardness of this night. It's like a tale of two restaurants....there is The Red Rooster bar, and then The Red Rooster dining room where the food is supposed to happen. We made reservations 6 weeks in advance, and arrived 30 minutes early, which I blame myself for. I Initially loved The Red Rooster bar's fun weekend vibe on a Wednesday night. The Cocktails were delicious, and the locals were charming and honestly fun to hang with: I was a fan of this gentrified hot spot. As soon as our reservation time came up, we checked back in to see how long our wait might be. We were told 10 minutes. We were told 10 minutes again 30 minutes later, and again when it was an entire 90 minutes past our reservation. I wanted to walk out, but thought better of it, because my parents were trying to treat me to a fun birthday dinner. By the time we were seated, we were famished. Instead of a tale of two restaurants, Red Rooster became more like Jekyll and Hyde. Our server was an odd mix of down home friendly and condescending aristocrat, which I dismissed as authentically southern. He was told it was my birthday, and he smiled petulantly. He asked us if we were familiar with the menu (I love soul food, but did not know Samuelsson's menu) and he suggested the fried chicken. We ordered fried chicken, shrimp and grits and mac and cheese. The cornbread, which arrived before the meal, was fine. That's about all I can say for the food. The shrimp and grits I ordered literally made me have a coughing fit, and I couldn't eat more than 2 bites. I let our server know, and he did nothing to try and make it right. Okay, fine. I leaned over to try the mac and cheese my daughter had been pushing around her plate. It was, just as the NY Magazine stated ""viscous and bland"". How can you mess up mac and cheese? And the fried chicken was over-fried. I'm talking beyond golden and into russet brown with not much flavor on the outside, and dry and stringy on the inside. In all honestly, I feel that our server wrote us off the moment he sat us, because he knew we were frustrated with the 90 minute wait beyond our reservation. From that moment on, our goose was cooked, and our chicken was over-fried.... Perhaps the stars were particularly maligned, or perhaps The Red Rooster is resting on it's laurels and letting it's long lines give them a false sense of security. Maybe, I'm just spoiled because I live in Portland, where the Country Cat's and Screen Door's fried chickens are faithfully delicious and consistent. Maybe I'm just disappointed that we waited 2 hours (I'm only keeping The Red Rooster accountable for 90 minutes...we chose to come early for a pre-dinner cocktail) for sub par food and okay service. Maybe they read my tweets about the long wait and decided to teach  me a lesson. The never replied to any of my tweets, btw...despite conversing with other tweeters during that time.The funniest might of been when the server brought out a birthday celebratory dessert and placed it in front of my sensory-challenged (autism) over-tired daughter...this after he looked at me with his petulant smile and said ""Happy Birthday"" not 40 minutes earlier. It was an off night to be sure, and I'd like to try again, but after waiting 6 weeks and 120 minutes, I'm just not sure I have it in me.",6,0,1,Beth M.,"Portland, OR",425,167,192

I ordered the Booyaka Smash Burger and the cornbread. My cousin ordered the crispy bird sandwich. My cousin really enjoyed the crispy bird sandwich. My burger was a good burger and obviously, the meat was of a high quality grade, but all in all, I thought it was just ""okay"" especially considering the fact that it was $19. I liked the shoestring fries...nicely seasoned. And everything was a nice presentation. Now..to the cornbread. It seems that people really love the cornbread, but I'm from the real South...and Red Rooster's cornbread is NOT cornbread. If anything, it is ""cornbread pound cake."" If that's what you're into, that's fine, but it's not cornbread. So for the real cornbread lovers out there, you will be disappointed. But to be fair, this restaurant does not package itself as producing authentic southern cuisine, but rather, offering an upper scale ""fusion"" or yeah, something to that effect.

Service 4 (because they acknowledged mistakes), food 3, drinks 4.Came here for brunch with a group of 6.  We waited 30 minutes at 1:30 pm on an Sunday which wasn't too bad.  There's a upstairs and a downstairs area. The upstairs is the main part but we had a seat downstairs, which honestly I preferred because the live soul singer upstairs was way too loud and I couldn't hear my friends speaking over it.A few of us ordered some bloody Mary's to start, which were very good though I couldn't really taste the vodka.  I got a Michelada for my second drink, which could've used more beer (was basically just the Bloody Mary mix, a little beer and no vodka).Service was pretty good with a few bumps. We ordered 2 corn breads and 2 deviled eggs for the table.  They brought 1 corn bread and we flagged we had a second. They brought it very quickly thereafter.  Cornbread was delicious and sweet and the butter was a nice complement.  4 of us got chicken and waffles, 1 got shrimp and grits and 1 got the rooster eggs.  We never got the deviled eggs so we flagged this for them after our entrees came out, they brought them not very long after and comped them, which was a nice gesture.  The deviled eggs were very good, I recommend them. They were more mustardy than normal and had a chickpea flavor, which I thought was interesting.The chicken was perfectly fried. Some of it was dark meat, which though juicy is not my preference.  The portion size was smaller than I was expecting. You get 2 pieces of fried chicken and half a waffle, which for Harlem and the price is less than I had though. Though I'm tiny so it was a fine size for me, but if I could eat more I would've been disappointed.  The dish was very good, though got a bit soggy towards the end.My boyfriend (who has a gluten allergy) thought the shrimp and grits were very good. The grits were unique in that they were in a spicy tomato broth so was pretty tasty. The shrimp were deveined already which made it easy to eat.Overall, this place has been on my list for a while, but never made it until now because it's so far uptown.

4.0,10/25/2016,"Near the end of a recent walking tour of Harlem my guide embarked on a discussion of soul food, pointing out a couple of restaurants worthy of a visit due to their historical significance.  Sylvia's and Amy Ruth's were mentioned but I had my eye on a different place.  A more expensive, less authentic place, to be sure, but the heart wants what the heart wants (thank you, Woody Allen).  After reading Marcus Samuelsson's autobiography, ""Yes, Chef"", I was left with a hankering to visit his very personal Harlem creation, Red Rooster.  It'd be a make or break deal for me as I'd finished the book not feeling the love for this self-made man.  Some things in his history made me question his character, knowing full well that it's none of my business to do so.  Still, if you're going to put it out there, it comes with the territory.  This could've gone one of two ways:  I could've liked Marcus Samuelsson even less had Red Rooster been a disappointment or I could've come away with an improved impression of the man if I felt favorable towards the place.  In ""Yes, Chef"" he went into great detail about what he was trying for with Red Rooster and I've got to hand it to him; the man got what he was aiming at and it's pretty damned joyous.  Marcus Samuelsson, Red Rooster redeemed the impression your autobiography left me with.  There really is no other way to describe the colorful, eclectic decor with which Red Rooster is outfitted.  It feels like the vision of a very talented designer who was given the go-ahead to create a fun, beautiful, colorful environment.  The decor though, wouldn't matter in the least were the food or service not up to it but in that department, I have little to carp about.  I've never before had Fried Chicken & Waffles (blasphemy, I know) but I have every belief that Red Rooster's version is the cream of the crop.  If a picture says a thousand words, just look at that image I've attached.  This dish was as tasty as it is gorgeous and the pickled turnip topping added the ideal dose of je nai se quoi.Ditto for the Deviled Eggs topped with Duck Salami.  I wasn't at all taken with the Green Tomato & Peach Salad ($15) and felt like the kitchen should rethink the dish.  The flavors not only didn't meld but they seemed a tad unpleasant.  Still,  with the experience as a whole, this was easy to overlook.  Nearing the end of my meal here there was a shift change and new staff came aboard in the bar area.  Just seeing the outfit that the new bartender arrived in put me in my happy place.  It was like having a direct link to the latest in creative fashion; San Francisco has a lot going for it but nothing like what that man was wearing.  You need to come to Harlem's Red Rooster to see that.  I dined in the front (bar area) in the late afternoon and thought this place was sort of overall fabulous.  Sylvia's and Amy Ruth's might be more authentic and cheaper but Red Rooster is its own thing and it's a pretty gloriously fun place to drink and dine.",16,7,10,Tracey A.,"Marin County, CA",319,1324,1680

Reception was warm and welcoming, never getting flustered by the large influx of customers coming inside. We never felt forgotten as we stood waiting for our table. The restaurant was quite generous with a few complimentary items due to our short delay in seating. Server didn't rush us to order or finish our meals.

I also ordered the Rooster Punch which was extremely watered down and bland. I ended up swapping it for an average mojito. We arrived around 8:00 PM and we were told that there wouldn't be indoor seating until 11:00 PM. My cousins and I opted to sit outdoors although it was about 60 degrees outside. Our food was served lukewarm and our waiter wasn't very attentive considering he didn't have many tables. The only good thing that I can say about Red Rooster is that the live music is spectacular. Of course it was muffled since we were seated outdoors but as a music lover, I was extremely pleased. The singer, band and violinist were very talented. Will I give Red Rooster another shot? Probably not. I heard many good things about this place and I've been wanting to visit for over a year. Aside from the live music, I was not impressed at all. To put the cherry on top, we split the bill between two different cards and the waiter put the wrong amount on each card.

3.0,10/13/2016,"Our reservation was for 9pm and we left with plenty of time; however, we were going to miss our reservation time because of the glorious NYC subway system.  They were very accomodating to our issue of getting there. When we arrived, the hostess (who was very sweet and friendly) was able to seat us earlier than out new reservation.  Our server was very formal and polite as we ordered our first round of drinks (which were quite good) and appetizers (which were alright... but not as fabulous as we had anticipated). We then ordered our enteers and our second appetizer (the olive platter, which never came out of the kitchen).  We also ordered two main courses, the shrimp and grits and the meatballs.  We believe that the shrimp was a bit over cooked, the sauce on the plate was fabulous in terms of the flavor and texture, and the grits were slightly dry.  As for ""Helga's Meatballs"", we thought they were excellent in regards to flavor and texture and layering of the dish was on point; however, we were not fans of the addition of the of caramelized pickles. When we ordered out entrees and second app, we also ordered the olive platter; however, we never received it due to our waiter forgetting to put them into the computer system. The two desserts we ordered were good, the la Isla Bonita and the Supa Sunday (sundae).  The tres leche cake in the former was quite flavorful, but it was quite dry as well.  The latter had the appearance of a basic sundae; however, the usage of homemade whipped cream and toffee like bits but a unique twist on the classic sundae. On the topic of desserts, we found price discrepancies between our two menus.  One had the Supa Sunday priced at $13 while the other had it priced at $12.  Even though it is not a big deal, they should still have consistency in their menus and should always honor the lower price.  As we were doing our yelp interview, we were going back to the online menu and found that even that menu varried between the one we had looked off of just 45 minutes earlier. Even though our waiter was crisp and clean, he was also a bit slow on service through out the evening.  At times, we had to interact with other servers to get the attention of our own.  But when he was at our table, he was very respectful and attentive, even though he was never the one filling our water glasses. We thought that the ambiance was wonderful and very personable towards the consistency of the restaurant. However, the music coming from the bar area was overpowering to the point where you were unable to hold a conversation with the company around you. Even though there were some mid-point issues, the consistent freshness of the ingredients was definitely a high point of the evening.In conclusion, the atmosphere and food itself was fair to its priceing, but the ambiance and service was mediocre.",0,0,0,JZ T.,"New York, NY",0,6,36

When you can go up the street and get a good bucket of chicken for $10.00.  And then you have the nerve to give me a half of waffle!!! A HALF.  I couldn't get one whole waffle!!! For over 20 bucks.  That was all the food there was.  I was so upset.  (There is also no refills which always bothers me when restaurants do that because when you have children free refills are a must) I will never go back there. The food was nothing what I expected and felt it was a complete rip off.  We ending up eating somewhere else later that night because we were all still hungry!!!  We went to a popular eatery around our area where we got several whole waffles (pancakes, eggs, sausage and free refills) and they were really, really good!!",0,0,0,S M.,"Uniondale, NY",0,16,0
3.0,10/6/2016,"If only Marcus had embellished the recipes of his menu items as well as he did his resumé, Red Rooster would have a much better rating. I find it borderline shameful how a celebrity chef with so many awards and accomplishments can proudly own such an underwhelming establishment. I won't get into all the specifics because I went as a group for brunch a while ago and we tried a variety of items. I kid you not, every single thing was bland. Every. Single. Thing. Hopefully things have changed now, but I'm not that interested in finding out. The pictures have apparently been through a new level of photoshop because... seriously. If only I could've eaten the pictures instead of the food, this might've been a 5 star review. The fact that they have some kind of lounge downstairs during the later hours is interesting. And at least the service was decent -- nothing exceptional but given the fact it's a spacious area, it wasn't too bad. Reservations are pointless though; the wait is still ridiculous whether or not you call ahead. I think this place is relying a little too heavily on the owner's celebrity status... which is so not okay.

Wish I could have enjoyed the conversation with my friend as well. That being said, the music was great!Food, in my opinion, was overrated. I'm sure it was great back when this place first opened up, but as they've gotten to be one of the most popular restaurants in the city, I think it may have gone downhill. I had the Fried Yardbird and my boyfriend had the Pumpkin Gnocchi. Both came out lukewarm. I assume they had been prepared long before we got there and were sitting underneath the heat lamps that are visible to the dining room. The cornbread was fabulous though!My favorite part of dinner here was the cocktails, specifically the Yes, Chef. Very fresh and a good amount of alcohol for the $14 price tag.

The place itself looks great, nice music and fast paced. When my friends and i first got there the hostess greeted us kindly and sat us all the way to the back, when i say the back i mean literally next to the kitchen near the restroom. I don't know who would want to go out and expect to be seated near the kitchen with servers in back of you, thats very tacky and unprofessional. We then processed to ask the hostess if she can switch our table and she said no problem but that their would be a 45 minute wait, great. When we finally got seated and ordered our food, our meals came out instantly. i don't understand how a whole chicken ( the yard bird) can be cooked in under 2 minutes. It seems as if the food is pre-made or something just sitting in the back waiting to be served. Also, aside from the food arriving in seconds it was cold. What a disappointment. i was really excited for this place but it let my hopes down. It was also very pricey, 70 dollars for a low quality meal and one beer is unacceptable. We also asked the waiter about the downstairs part of the restaurant and she said we will be charged 15 dollars for entry, i don't understand why i would pay 15 dollars to go check out a downstairs area when i already had a meal in the restaurant. if i had an option ill rate the place zero stars.",2,0,0,S D.,"Bronx, NY",88,13,3

3.0,9/21/2016,"I guess being a foodie and also being of Ethiopian descent like Marcus Samuelsson,  I really wanted to love this place but I don't know if I see myself coming back here. ***FYI the food here is not Ethiopian, but Marcus one of the creators of the restaurant is Ethiopian born and Swedish raised.When we arrived, our table was immediately ready and our server (I think his name was David) came right over to take our drink order. I had the Rooster Punch, one of their sangria options and it did not disappoint! After some drinks we ordered the Wild Wild Wings appetizers. Unfortunately, this was the worst part of our meal. Being from Western NY, I've been spoiled with good wings my whole life. Wings that are thoroughly cooked, hot, crispy, and flavorful. While these wings were in a delicious sauce, they were not very crispy and in my opinion were not cooked long enough. Next came the entrees. I ordered the Helga's Meatballs while my husband ordered the Leo's Dumplin'. The meatballs were good but not anything special. The mashed potatoes were flavorful and were what really stood out in this dish. My husband's gnocchi on the other hand were delicious. If you do find yourself here, I'd highly recommend this dish. The gnocchi were light and the sauce flavorful with a little kick. Definitely one of the highlights of our meal. We ended our meal splitting a dessert, the coffee and donuts. This was probably the best part of my meal. The donuts were drizzled with Nutella and served with dulce de leche ice cream in a glass. The ice cream was kinda melty and I realized, that it was probably served in a glass instead of a bowl so that it would be easy to drink. Much like having actual coffee and donuts. Overall, I had to give this place 3 stars and I could definitely see why someone would give it less. In fact, if it wasn't for the good service, amazing sangria, gnocchi, and dessert, I'd probably give this place 2 stars as well.",2,2,1,Giz R.,"Rochester, NY",21,30,133

2.0,9/13/2016,"The food at Red Rooster is uniquely American, meaning you will not find anything like it in any other country, and it bears little resemblance to anything people actually eat in this country. It's not that the complex taste combinations are unpleasant, but they are unexpected, and the three dishes we had seem to lean heavily on a particular combination of sweet and sour flavors that wasn't totally satisfying. Perhaps its that I never really liked sweet and sour, or maybe it's just that I grew up in the south so I know that curry isn't really something you use to season ribs. But either way, if you are so daring as to experiment like this, you certainly don't try to pass it off as soul food. This place wasn't for me.  I had out-of-town guests and I wasn't sure what I was telling them about the city by bringing them here. The chef is trying too hard to do something... anything...

The food was amazing, not too greasy. I ordered the wings to start. The cucumber complement was different but refreshing. My server had great recommendations, she described each dish to me so vividly I could picture it in my head. Some servers see just a one top come in and immediately give less than great service, however, this wasn't the case at all. I then ordered the kale Cesar salad. For $16 it was a very small portion, so if you're really hungry do not get this. If I could recommend anything I would say just to stick to one server per table.

5.0,8/22/2016,"I like to eat a lot, so trying different restaurants is something that I enjoy and I was definitely looking forward to eating here.  So for starters we had crab bites and cornbread. The crab bites were delicious and the cornbread was amazing. The cornbread was cut in the shape of a slice of pound cake and it was a thick as Texas toast. It came with honey butter, which I slathered all over my piece and tomato jam which I also spread on my piece of cornbread. I will reiterate, the cornbread was amazing. For dinner we had ""Squash the Beef"", which is a dinner for two that consists of skirt steak, short ribs, kimchi salad, eggplant and some kind of pancakes (sorry I don't remember what kind they were). I was worried that the meal for two would not be enough food because we were both very hungry and we both love to eat. Boy was I wrong. It was more than we could eat. The skirt steak was tender, flavorful and had a good char on it.  The short ribs were delicious and humongous, as one passerby seconded my claim when he walked by and said ""look at the size of that"".  To finish off our dinner we had coffee and doughnuts for dessert. The doughnuts are house made and filled with chocolate. It also came with dulce de leche ice cream and espresso, which our server poured into the ice cream table side. I don't Yelp much, but this is by far one of the best dinners that I have ever had. As a side note, our evening started off on a super super super high note. As we were standing at the hostess station which is located on the side of the bar after you enter the restaurant, I spotted Marcus Samuelson walking up the stair to the main level. He was wearing a hat and he noticed that I noticed and recognized him. I guess my big smile gave it away.  He then proceeded to walk over to me and my girlfriend, shake our hands and say hi to us.

3.0,8/22/2016,"I have eaten at Red Rooster several times, but I must say I was disappointed in the servicethis last dining experience. My friend and I went here for Saturday brunch. We were seated on the patio on a very hot day. After being seated, it took our sever over 10 minutes to greet us, and bring us water. Did I mention it was a hot summer day, and we were sitting outside? Before he left the table, I was in desperate need of a refill on my water. It took him about another 10 minutes to refill my water, and finally take our order. My appetizers, kale salad and crab bites, took 25 minutes getting to the table (after my server was not paying attention to detail, and brought me the wrong appetizers).I am a patient person, but I thought it was a long time especially when kale in being thrown in a bowl with dressing and croutons. My dirty dishes sat in front of me for 30 minutes, and my server did not ask how I enjoyed the meal. In fact, I rarely saw the server. If it weren't for other servers and bus boys, this would have been a really bad experience. Other servers noticed my empty glass, and would refill it, and also take away by dirty dishes. It took another 30 or so minutes for our entrees to be brought to the table. From the moment we sat down until our meals were brought to us was almost an hour and 45 minutes. This is way too long. The server never asked how we enjoyed our meal, instead he just brought us the check (the wrong check. He brought us the tab for the table next to us). The food was really good, flavorful, and hot (temperature). Red Rooster's prices are not cheap; therefore, the caliber of service should match the food prices. I tried to give Red Rooster another shot the next day. I ordered chicken sausage to go, so I could go home and make my own Sunday brunch. On the menu, it is priced at $7; however, I was charged $9.80. This was not including the tip. I do not know how they calculate tax.

It's become a tourist spot with mediocre service and food! I can't and won't be returning! I dined there last evening. Got to the restaurant 30 minutes early to check in on my reservation for two. Informed the hostess (a fair skinned lady with some ""locks"" and an accent)that we needed a quiet space because we were celebrating and I wanted to hear my friend as we talked.Got there for our 5:30 reservation and we were offered two options - 1. On the end of a crowded communal table nearest to the bathroom or 2. On the other end of a more crowded communal table right in front of the kitchen door (servers coming in and out with food)! I guess she didn't understand what quiet met...?So...nicely I went back to the hostess and said, this isn't going to work for us. She was annoyed and basically said that's all they had and she needed to worry about later reservations. Why...we were a current reservation??! After seeing a few open two tops, I insisted and she responds to me in a nasty and inpatient tone, ""fine, I'm not going to fight with you""! FIGHT...oh I was so damn pissed! If my friend wasn't excited to be there, I would have walked right out! Or maybe fight the girl since she thought I was looking for a fight instead of a decent seat in this overpriced mediocre restaurant! About 15 minutes later, I see her seat another couple in those same seats I rejected and within 10 minutes, they asked to move! I know y'all want to maximize the space but customer comfort and a great experience should be the most important thing! No one should be seated there!Now onto the next...My friend, a vegetarian asked for a side of Collard Greens (one of the few things she CAN have off the menu). After being told no by the server (because the Chef didn't have enough) and the manager (who said they were out), we were offered a side of ""succotash"". The ""succotash"" was tasteless pease and carrots! Gross. My friend had the tasteless Mac and cheese and ""succotash""!! We had to return the food! Just tasteless, bland, overpriced food that has been geared towards accommodating the tourist palate!I will NOT be returning!

1.0,8/21/2016,"My friend invited me out to eat at Red Rooster to experience the true Harlem and soul food.  Red Rooster was lively and trendy but a bit overrated and pricey when it came to the food. First, the host wasn't very accommodating when it came to our seating which we had 5:30 reservations for. She gave us two options at a high table where there's community dining. One near a rest room and the other near the kitchen which was a very high traffic area. My friend had arrived 30 minutes early to assure our seating and ,also, informed the host that there was a vacant table that wasn't occupied. The host informed my friend that the table was reserved for a 6 pm reservation...um ok? But our reservation is for NOW. Fortunately, a kind server did inform the host,again, of our dissatisfaction at which point she came over and stated ""I'm not going to argue with you..."" and seated us at the vacant table.     I'm a vegetarian who does frequent non vegetarian restaurants, for many of my friends aren't vegetarians, and can successfully navigate through a menu and find an entree that I can fully enjoy while enjoying my company and not inconveniencing any one. Unfortunately, that was not the case at Red Rooster. I ordered a salad from the appetizer selections and a side order of collard greens. We were informed by our female server that that wasn't possible due to a shortage of greens and unless my entree came with it I was unable to order it as a side. She did suggest I try the mac and greens. The mac and greens entree was very visually appealing but lacked taste and the ""soul"" in soul food. It left my palate searching for that extra bite which I didn't get. We were also brought a side order of succotash which was lacking in its main ingredient, sweet corn. It looked like a bag of frozen peas and carrots on a plate and left over corn kernels that they salvaged from another dish. There wasn't the main attraction of yellow with her best friends green and red as her side kicks. I didn't bother to try it after being disappointed with the tasteless mac and greens. Overall we paid for my friend's order of wings and 2 drinks which totalled to 42 dollars.

Blackened catfish was cooked to perfection with just the right amount of spice in it!

Order your own. We also tried the shrimp/calamari hot rice which was just as good and not spicy in the least.For dinner, we shared the pastor pork and the meat was so juicy and tender it literally slid off the bone.Highly recommend this place!",0,0,0,Tiffany F.,"New York, NY",99,40,155
3.0,8/16/2016,"This is a hard review for me to write.  And truth be told I was leaning more towards 4*s than 3*s until i hovered over the star rating on Yelp and saw 4* ""Yay I am a fan"".  Factor in how loud the place gets and I am not really sure I am a fan. Our party of four was seated promptly to a 1/2 full dining room (quickly filled) at 6:30pm on a Monday night.  Service all night was almost perfect and ALWAYS friendly (almost other than spilling water and wine when pouring and servers taking food before all done.  VERY minor though.).  I love the bustling atmosphere and the whole restaurant was well decorated.  I will say that the tables are small, too close together and chairs uncomfortable.  And while I know we are in a heatwave here in the northeast, it was extremely humid and warm in the dining room.On to the food.  We ordered the chicken and waffles appetizer along with the crab cake bites.  The chicken and waffles was very good.  Not really killer but good.  I found the waffles much better than the chicken.  The chicken was fine but not memorable.  On the other hand, I thought the crab cake bites were excellent.  Not a ton of filler, excellent flavor and the aioli beneath was a perfect accompaniment.  The wild wings were fine.  Good flavor and well proportioned.  My issue with them were they were luke warm, at best.  For the entrees we had the steak frites, blackened catfish, shrimp and grits, Helga's meatballs and a gnocchi dish.  The flat iron steak for the frites was spiced with a coffee rub and was tender for a flat iron.  But it was over cooked.  The ox marrow pudding and mustard been cream the was below the steak was great.  The blackened catfish was well cooked but super spicy.  I'm fine with that but those adverse to spice may find it off-putting.  The side succotash was excellent.  The shrimp and grits were disappointing. Four meager sized shrimp (ENOUGH WITH LEAVING ON THE TAIL SHELL!!!  That practice is so annoying and completely missing the purpose.) in creamy grits that had partially seized and were not really all that warm.  And it was supposedly accompanied with piri piri and Frogmore stew although I'm not sure either were discernible.  Was the Frogmore stew the brown gravy ladled over the shrimp and grits and was the piri piri a rub on the shrimp?  They tasted good, but nowhere near great.  Helga's meatballs tasted great.  Personally I found the meatball a tad dense but the others in my party loved them.  The combo of the mashed potatoes and braised greens worked very well along with the pickles on top.  And finally the gnocchi dish (I apologize for not remembering the name).  I found this dish very enjoyable albeit small.  The texture of the gnocchi was excellent, a bit more toothsome than I expected but I loved it.  The sausage was a bit too blackened for my taste but they worked.  Desserts were a bit of a mixed bag, like the entrees.  The blueberry hill had good flavor but a rock hard crumble.  No, seriously, ROCK HARD.  The Ode to Pops was fun to eat, almost like a deconstructed amores, without the chocolate and add ice cream.  And finally the coffee and doughnuts.  These little doughnuts were more akin to a doughnut hole and filled with a coffee creme I think.  And the dulce de leche ice cream & mocha to dip them in was fantastic.  This was the most successful of the three desserts.  No seriously, that crumble was that hard.  Holy cow!The one thing I have to ask is does this restaurant garner the crowds if its in midtown without MS name attached to it?  And the resounding answer is no.  It was good, don't get me wrong.  But for all the hype bestowed upon it I expected a LOT more.  And the volume level is crazy loud.  Very very hard to cary on any sort of conversation.  Then again maybe I am overly critical as it has withstood the test of time up in Harlem.",0,0,0,L.

4.0,8/14/2016,"Have been wanting to check out this spot for quite some time and was not disappointed. The Executive Chef's moving and inspirational background is enough to draw quite a crowd to see how this Ethiopian born, Swedish raised mastermind has somehow crafted the city's best Soul Food. Our appetizers, the mac and greens and wings were out of this world. The fried yard bird was perfectly crisp, incredibly juicy and served with delicious hot sauce and nutmeg-packed gravy. Helga's Meatballs were the best take on Swedish meatballs that I have had since actually being in Sweden - delicious. The Shrimp and Grits plate was bursting with flavor and the shrimp were perfectly cooked. Our waiter was extremely friendly which is always a treat when dining in NYC: made lovely recommendations and delivered our drinks, dishes, and bill in a satisfyingly timely manner.The only complaint that I do have is the noise level was ridiculous. The live brass band in a southern soul food oriented restaurant sounds like a phenomenal idea, until you add in the high ceilings and unflattering acoustics of the venue - once the band went on break, it was still very loud with conversation but no longer too loud to think. In addition, the grits that were served with my entree were barely warm but the hot temperatures of the greens and shrimp atop made it a forgivable factor.",0,0,1,Sarah S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",36,26,109

5.0,8/1/2016,"I finally got to experience Red rooster as it should be,  It was very crowded on a busy Wed night, but we made our way to the hostess Elzelia, she assured us that we could sit outside, as it was a gorgeous evening.  We waited about 10 minutes and then we were led to a great table. We were greeted by our server Jaime, who was fantastic. Since she overheard we were celebrating birthdays, ( both one past and one to come), our evening started off with complimentary champagne.  The menu is a little extensive so we relied on our server to guide us, I had the Mac and greens with lobster, and we had a serving of hot wings, corn bread and scallion pancakes filled with goat meat and pulpo.  Although this was my first time here, Jaime was very attentive and patient with the many questions i had, even thought it was a busy server station. We got very lucky as both Selim ( the assistant general manager) and Kaysilyn ( General Manager) were both there that evening, working the room. One of the things that i noticed, was that this was not just another spot in Harlem, concerned with turning tables and Zagat ratings... This was a place with soul, with heart, quickly evident by the way both Selim and Kaysilyn greeted guests and diners on a first name basis, and not only that, by the traffic that came through to just to say hello. This truly made me aware this was much more than just food, it was ambiance, it was community,  it was comfort without the extra calories. By the time our food came, both my birthday partner and I were quite amazed at the order within chaos, that the servers seem to handle... whether from outsiders looking to just sit, to the every day traffic, the handled everyone with professionalism, courtesy and a smile. We ordered a huge pitcher of the Spiced rum punch... that had just the extra kick needed to work up a sweat... Although i must admit... my friend thought it needed an extra kick, which the server gladly obliged, and brought the bartender over to add an extra shot.  When it came time for desert... I was done.. but i needed to enjoy the full Red Rooster experience. As our desert came, we were surprised with  not candles but firework flames and the whole crowd singing happy birthday. I was floored. Thank you to all of the establishment that put in the true work to make a difference...

Due to religious reasons we couldn't add the lobster to the mac & greens like everyone else recommended. Those mac & greens were pretty bad. The macaroni itself had no flavor and the greens tasted like they werent cooked fully through and also had no flavor. My mother sent hers back but I kept the dish. The wings however, were really meaty and flavorful. My mother also liked the salmon a bit but thought it was a tad overcooked.

I was told know ""we don't do that here"". I was a bit confused for a $17 omelet I couldn't add meat.

The wings were bland and didn't have much of a taste.

This is not your grandma's Mac&Cheese recipe, it has greens, it has some heat and it's made with big pasta and lobster chunks (if you pay the additional $9 which seems a bit steep) if I go again I would probably have just the original Mac&Cheese since its flavorful and rich enough on its own.  I'm not sure what the dressing was on the arugula salad but being someone who's obsessed with arugula I loved it!Now for dessert they give you 3 beignet-looking doughnuts so fluffy and filled with chocolate sauce... Simply delicious!",1,0,0,Sofia R.,"New York, NY",5,64,24

1.0,7/6/2016,"I recently moved to Harlem after getting married, and ever since I moved into the neighborhood, all had been hearing about was Red Rooster, so I had relatively high expectations.So on the fateful night I had invited a good French buddy of mine and his wife to a dinner in Harlem. My buddy, a long time resident of the city,is a person really into his food and had introduced me to quite a few famous, and good restaurants around the city over the years. So, I figured I would reciprocate and introduce him to something new...How I wish I hadn'tThe start was good. Without a reservation we were able to get a shared table pretty much immediately. Then our server came up, who was quite cordial and seemingly on the ball, especially when I had explained my wife was vegan, which understood, can be a challenge in a soul food restaurant...but a majority of the restaurants in NYC can accommodate one way or another, and there definitely were some dishes that could work.So that's where the good service ended. Orders for drinks were taken, but it was probably a good 20 minutes before we got our drinks. And my bourbon cocktail was ""meh"" and mostly ice in a small cup. Then after another long wait, the food came. I'm a huge gazpacho fan, and they had what seemingly was an interesting twist on a classic with pickled watermelon rind, the Gazpacho Verde. It was boring and unexciting, and about a half ladle-full in a large shallow soup bowl. You know how a person must tilt the bowl of soup to collect the last delectable spoonfuls...well, that was from the start, and it was far from delectable.  My friend and his wife ordered some chicken dishes for their starters...wings, and chicken and waffles. They seemed under-enthused, but didn't complain. Which led me to believe it was not great.My wife on the other had had ordered the charred broccolini, which was a $13 for half-bunch of broccolini that would cost 2 bucks at Whole Foods, dumped with a random amount pickled peppers (yeah, I get it, it is a restaurant and they have overheads). And then was the 20 minute or so wait for the main dishes...we gave up on ordering drinks at this point.By which time my wife was definitely not happy since she barely had anything to eat. Then she got her meager serving of the gazpacho sans the crema to make it vegan. I had ordered the Fried Yardbird which was dark meat fried chicken with mashed potatoes and greens. It was okay. It was very greasy, but at that point of time, I was hungry enough not to care. The flavor was nothing to write home about, and white mace gravy which was listed as the second side, or ingredient, or whatever came served in a thimble.By the time my wife finished her 3 spoon-fulls of gazpacho, she was like, ""I can't just eat this"". We had already asked our server at the beginning to give us the lowdown on dishes that could be vegan, but like I said, the good service ended about 5 minutes after we sat down, A reasonable vegan option wasn't presented until my wife decided she was going to be starving, and it was at that point that it was suggested to do some udon noodle dish that was on the menu that could be done vegan, or the other option was a salad.Overall, the whole experience was mediocre at best. Definitely not living up to the hype.The service was enthusiastic at the beginning, then quickly tapered off. And the food was nothing to write home about considering the semi-celebrity chef status of the owner.I may, or may not give the spot another chance. Overall, an unexciting experience. I'm sorry, an amateur chef could have been much more successful over what was offered at Red Rooster. It was like a headless chicken aimlessly flapping around all over the place.",4,0,0,Gok T.,"New York, NY",47,16,2
1.0,7/5/2016,"Every single person in our party of 5 was very disappointed with this restaurant.  The spiced catfish was overly salty and the accompanying grits reminded me of a salty and lumpy version of Elmer's paste/glue.  Someone in my party ordered the Fried Yardbird and offered me the drumstick.  The drumstick was very dry (unacceptable especially for dark meat) and the fried skin was a heck of lot more chewy than crunchy, kind of like chewing on burnt leather.  Another in my party ordered the Uncle Tito's Udon Noodles.  The octopus in this dish was overly salty and the brisket was dry.  Another in my party ordered the Steak Frites and complained that the steak was way too chewy and grisly.  The last entree in my party ordered the Mama P's Fried Fish and she thought it was mediocre at best.The service was equally disappointing.  After being seated, it took at least 10 to 15 minutes for the waiter to take our drink orders.  Throughout the meal, service continued to move at snail's pace.  We ordered 2 desserts to share.  The second dessert came out almost 20 minutes after the first.  By then, the person who had ordered the second dessert had already finished her cup of coffee, and was not offered another cup.I though giving this a 1-star review was a bit harsh, but I truly feel this restaurant, based upon my experience, is worth less than an apathetic ""Meh!""",3,1,0,Charles L.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,26,0

I ordered the El Jefe. Which should be short ribs wth black Kale and eggs on top. What I got was a skillet full of potatoes (potatoes were not listed in the description) with a tablespoon of short ribs and a kale garnish. This was in no way worth the $17.

But I t took well over 30 mins (after food/ dishes had been cleared out) to get our check.  Server was floating around but just wouldn't stop by to close things out.

We quickly got seated once everyone arrived. The decor looked very nice and eccentric; kind of 60's - 70's speakeasy/ down home at the bayou style decor and ambience. Very appealing to the eye. The service was cool. Since I heard the food was great, I decided to go. I did review some pics on Yelp before we got there but what I ordered didn't look like pics of what everyone else ordered that ordered the same thing. For example, as an appetizer I ordered the fried green tomatoes; which in other people's pictures the tomatoes were whole round slices fried perfectly. I got cut up tomato chunks on a bed of arugula, watermelon and some sort of meat, which I didn't expect, not sure if it was pork or not because it didn't say so on the menu, but at any rate, they were just ok to me. I also ordered the cornbread which everyone seemed to rave about. I thought it was good. It seemed more like corn cake to me, plus it had whole corn kernels in it (not sure how I felt about that). The honey butter and tomato spread were really good, so overall good. As my entree I ordered the Mac and Greens. That was really good. I was only able to eat half and actually ate the rest as leftovers a few nights later. They say if food tastes amazing as leftovers it was a good dish.

4.0,6/12/2016,"I've been to Red Rooster so many times over the last four years.  What I love the most is that it draws one of the most hip and diverse crowds I've seen anywhere in the city.  Young and old, black and white and everything in between, college students in jeans and old ladies in pearls and furs.  They all flock to Red Rooster.  I've had a lot of the food, and it's all pretty solid.  By that I mean you should enjoy your meal, but the food alone isn't usually anything to write home about.  Some favorites include the wings, shrimp and grits, cornbread, and at brunch, the barrio biscuit, which is basically biscuits and gravy.  Cocktails are also solid, and I particularly enjoy Strivers Rowers, Bourbon Negroni, and of course you can't pass up the Obama-tini, on name alone.Try to get a table outside or upstairs.  The bar is usually packed, and the communal tables aren't really large enough to seat 6 adults eating dinner... you will be uncomfortably close to your fellow diners.  And downstairs in any business feels sad to me, because, well... underground.  Upstairs or downstairs, you may be lucky enough to catch a show.For me, Red Rooster is always a good bet because you'll have solid food and drinks surrounded by cool people in a cool spot, and that's a NYC institution for ya!",3,1,3,Dione D.,"Atlanta, GA",104,606,455

We asked her about something on the menu and she acted like she wasnt sure but managed  a half ass answer. The she says well what about some drinks would like to order drinks. Duh we did that already. She said oh they must be at the bar and she left. At that point we decided to leave as well.

3.0,6/6/2016,"My boyfriend and I came here after a trip to Bob's Furniture and before I went to work. He had been raving about it for some time, so I was pretty excited to finely try it. I've gotta say that I really enjoyed the old school clothing that decorated the high walls of Red Rooster's swanky space. The restaurant was really well designed, and I bet could put a smile on just about anyone's face.The service was also very friendly and helpful. They responded quickly to my boyfriend and I's requests, and were very professional when handling our complaints.Which leads me too the complaints...I ordered the mac n 'cheese and unfortunately had to send it back twice for the same issue; it was cold. I had suspicions about it when the first order arrived. It's served in a cast iron skillet, which normally means whatever is being served in it will come to the table still bubbling. My mac n' cheese came to the table looking lifeless. Lo and behold, the dish was barely warm. Our waiter was really understanding when I told him, and quickly replaced it with another, however that one was even colder than the first. Ooops! Embarrassing mistake. Thankfully the third was boiling hot and really quite tasty. I really loved that it was served with an arugula salad, which offered a nice fresh and slightly bitter break from the super savory and cheese macaroni. Back to good stuff! My boyfriend ordered the yard bird, and the few bites I had of it were really delicious. The hot sauce and bechamel served with it were really great additions. I loved how the bechemal was made simplely and had a delicate taste of nutmeg. (A lady next to us ordered the same dish and said the bechamel tasted like vomit, and I think she just didn't understand the classic use of nutmeg in cream sauces). The hot sauce was GREAT. The base seemed to be roasted red pepper, which gave the sauce a sweet and smokey flavor. I could put that shit on anything. Hehe! Also, the chicken stayed crispy for a really long time. Even after 20 minutes of sitting, it was crispy on the outside and juicy inside. Very impressive.Overall, Red Rooster did provide my boyfriend and I with a tasty meal and a lovely space to enjoy it in. Their mac n' cheese mistake was a star killer, but honestly, when they finally got the dish hot, it was very good.

4.0,6/4/2016,"Red Rooster is the famous Chef Samuelson's restaurant and also one of the most well known restaurants in Harlem.  I've been holding off on writing a review for Red Rooster for awhile and think it's because I'm still somewhat mesmerized by my experience. The place has some serious character. It is not everyday that you enter a space that is authentically eclectic. Though many places try to capture the essence of a rarity, they often fail miserably. Samuelson's design team nailed it from the menu to the staff to the design.The most important question on the table is, ""What's the food like?"" The short answer is that the food is here is great.  On the menu, you'll find some typical soul food clichés such as chicken and waffles, which we didn't dare order considering the masterpiece that we had just a few days earlier at Amy Ruth's. However, I imagine that all the menu items are exquisite. Their menu offers a mix of different cuisines, all blended deliciously. What Chef Samuelson does well is add multiple complexities to basic dishes such as Lobster Mac & Cheese, which is what I ordered. My husband had the fried yard bird and raved about how much he loved it for days. Reservations were honored upon arrival. The staff is diverse and most seemed pretty welcoming. We even saw Chef Samuelson's wife dining at the table next to us, which means that she must be a fan of the food too. There's not much in terms of vegetarian options lists on the menu, but I'm certain that the restaurant could whip up a specialty upon request.

Well, I really wanted to love this place but unfortunately didn't.  The service was mixed.  There was a gentleman manning the front/outside area and honestly it seemed as if he thought he was El Jefe, himself.  Holding court, controlling who went where and when, gossiping with passers by, etc.  After the lovely hostess grabbed us to sit in a prime outside seat he screamed ""ma'am, ma'am"" at us and it wasn't clear if he was talking to me or our hostess.  He then proceeds to stop us from sitting with no explanation or apology for whatever miscommunication occurred. And very publicly, mind you.  10 minutes go by and we sit in the same seat the hostess went to seat us in originally. Umm, OK.On to the food.  We ordered a ton of it so as to maximize the options.  Mac and cheese, fried green tomatoes, glazed carrots, Brussels sprouts, Deviled eggs, and catfish.  Everything had promise but was one note.  The sprouts were way too sweet and the Mac was bland and the carrots were too spicy.  The tomatoes were a huge disappointment as they were too fancy (deconstructed) for their own good and was a tiny portion. In all, the flavors weren't balanced.  The table service was slow but our waitress was super sweet.  Perhaps RR should consider asking the gentleman at the front to take a few tables to help out rather than taking on a ""mayor of Red Rooster"" role which doesn't seem to really help anyone.Marcus, you need to spend some time at this restaurant as they clearly need you.  Everyone we spoke with that lives in NY that has been to this restaurant has had the same kind of experience as we did.

3.0,5/28/2016,"I have frequented this place a lot (not by choice - many friends that visit me in Harlem usually have this place on their bucket list). Food is always a hit or miss. Lately, it's been more of a miss than a hit. Hostess can be embarrassingly rude and passive aggressive which is very disappointing. Many times I've been lied to about the wait by the hostess and often overlooked (even with reservations)!

2.0,5/28/2016,"Well, where should I start? My friends from out of town decided to go to red rooster for brunch. The brunch menu was very limited and over priced. But we were not concerned with the prices. Our main concern was the quality of the food and service. We waited 20 minutes to order, which the restaurant was not busy at all. When we finally got our food after another 30 minute wait it was not that good. The manager apologize and gave us a free desert with a damn teaspoon of ice cream and cake. No one at my table enjoyed their meal. The chicken was dry and over cooked. The rooster scramble was a joke! It was a cold cut of ham slices with scrambled eggs. Too much for deli meat. Short rib brunch item was good but not that great for a brunch. Sometimes simplicity is the best.

ONLY came to appease family members, otherwise, I would've kept it moving.Chicken & waffles were lukewarm. The waffles tasted like ""curry"" & the chicken was HARD & lacked seasoning; crispy though. The Fried Green Tomato Appetizer had a ""quartered"" triangle of a ""piece"" of tomato (3 in total), not even worth mentioning, atop of pimento cheese (decent). The dish was cold, as if it sat waiting to be picked up for at least 20 minutes. The plate had an equally quartered piece of DRIED pork (2)  and 2 pieces of watermelon that have seen better days. Then, a sacrificial tablespoon of Arugula dropped in the middle.We also had an Entree of Chicken Wings, equally as bad as the chicken from the Chicken and Waffles. Needless to say, if it weren't for the drinks  (Ziggy & Sauvignon Blanc) and the trendy atmosphere (celebs were on deck) this place WOULD NOT BE WORTH a drive-by. Service was ok. The host was accommodating of our party of six. The waiter, however, seemed aloof. He had to be called often. The Manager was conciliatory and comped the Fried Green Tomatoes.

1.0,5/25/2016,"Pretty much a loser experience from start to finish. Really bad service, cold food, mediocre flavor and steep prices.Really wanted to like this place but no go. The server was pretty much nonexistent at our table. When we were finally able to order, the server told us our choices were not good - but not in a helpful, friendly way, more in a hard upsell kind of way. By the time our food was served, all of it was barely warm. I said something and my plate was taken away. In the meantime, everyone else else in the party ate - and then finished - their entrees. I was able to sample the various dishes and, while OK, we all agreed we'd had much better. With still no sign of my food, I asked that my order be cancelled. I really didn't want to keep sitting there and didn't want to make everyone else wait just to watch me eat. In the end, the entree showed up anyway but, by then, my appetite was gone. Turns out the server's upsell was just that - she had claimed that the portion size of one dish was very small but turned out to be pretty generous.Also, throughout this whole experience, we watched a table that was seated about the same time next to ours get the star treatment. Server was very attentive, took orders quickly, and, in fact, was passing out their dessert menus while we were still waiting for mains.The manager came by to apologize before we left but, by then, the whole thing was a little sour and we just wanted to get out of there.

2.0,5/24/2016,"This review is solely for my upstairs bar experience. I've been to Red Rooster a few times. I've managed to always linger by the upstairs bar as I attempt to have a leisure night in Harlem. It is..IMPOSSIBLE to get the attention of a bartender at this place. Maybe it's just me. Maybe other's have great luck with getting a cocktail. Time after time I have come to this establishment and had to have waited 20 minutes + for a bartender to finally acknowledge my presence. Is it too many locals hanging with the bartenders sucking up all their work flow time? Maybe. I'd like to think that I know how to navigate a bar, but when it comes to Red Rooster -- I just can't ever seem to slide on in and get a beverage in a decent time. The ambience is nice, the crowd is probably one of the biggest draws here. A group of beautiful patrons who are really just stopping by for live jams or dj sets. The front bar area can get a little tight and throughout the night you'll end up dodging waiters bringing food orders through the crowds, etc. I mean, that's fine.

They went out of there way to accommodate our every request (even offering to bring spoons for our toddler to pay with and opening the door to the restaurant for us to enjoy the music). However, I thought the brunch menu and food was just ok:1) they didn't have any French toast, waffles,Or pancakes in the menu, which is odd for a restaurant 2) the chicken and waffles entree is only served with chicken thighs, no other chicken piece is offered, which was disappointing3) my husband ordered egg whites (a healthier option) and they were floating in water and oil, however they did taste good4) shrimp and grits were tasty, but not the best ever5) the Mac and cheese is baked with collard greens. It tasted ok, but it is so rich. I could not eat the entire serving, it was just too rich. 6 the corn bread was drowning in butterAll and all, great ambiance, outdoor seating is available, there is a live jazz band on Sunday's but the food is mediocre at best.

First time had dinner, not bad but very small portions. Second time yesterday for late lunch, menu was very limited and since I'm health conscious my only option was to get the blackened catfish. The fish was good but served over kidney beans? Thought that it would be served over green beans, I tried not to eat the beans but the catfish was served over them so it was almost impossible to avoid a few. Unfortunately, It didn't sit well in my stomach, in a matter of minutes after I ate, my stomach started cramping, I was nauseas all night and I'll let you fill in the rest, it's now morning and I'm still nauseas with stomach cramps. I feel like I'm food poisoned, I'm not sure what was in the beans or if the fish wasn't fresh, I also had white sangria and a little corn bread since all I could eat was the small piece of catfish.

Having had no reply from Mr. Samuelson's corporation in a month, and now seeing ""how wonderful"" the place is in recent  online media, it is time to comment. We had been enchanted by the chef's life story and commitment to uplifting the neighborhood so made plans to go to Red Rooster in our first NYC trip in many years. We also planned the occasion as a birthday celebration for our daughter.Upon arrival  on April 13th, we were impressed with the whole feel and charm of the place and enjoyed unique cocktails. Then we waited and waited and waited ...for our weekday 8 PM reservation we we seated at 9:30 having stood for an  hour and a half as ""in groups"" of 2,3, or 4 walked by to be seated. At our table, we were asked how we were by a clearly disinterested server, said we were hungry and frustrated, and we were literally told ""that's too bad""! 2 of us ordered the much heralded fried chicken - fatty, dried out, with white water that passed as gravy, overcooked greens, and tasteless potatoes. Obviously all had been under a warming light for who knows how long. Another member of the party had shrimp and grits- the shrimp were rubbery and there was something in the grits that caused a significant allergic reaction for the guest. We asked several times for the dish to be removed which it was not.As this was a birthday ""celebration, we asked for something for the that person-complementary cake was provided but then given to the WRONG PERSON!Two other comments- the table behind us was in a raunchy alcohol fueled mood with a continuous stream of obscenities- no effort made to shut them up as there was certainly $$$ being thrown around.

So why only 2 stars?    I have a lot of experience with restaurants of just about every cuisine, high end to fast food. An establishment such as Red Rooster should be skilled enough to serve a table equally. What do I mean? We were a party of 4 ordering the same thing, salmon, sadly on my suggestion. We get the entrees and one person A in the party has 2 normal sized pieces of salmon, persons B and C have 1 piece each that is 1/2 the size of 1 of Person A's TWO pieces of salmon whereas her companion had a piece that was the equivalent of 1/4 the size of ONE of her companion's pieces?

Blerg!! we dropped them our cell number to hit us up while we low key went around the neighborhood to other restaurants to put our names on their lists too to see who would open up first. after about an hour and a half, it was Red Rooster. woo hoo. they had a live singer blowing some vocals into a mic for our entertainment. i don't recall her name or anything, tho. too hangry to pay attention at that point. staff was pleasant despite the huge crowd. none of the above really matters, though. none of it. the food however, that's why we're all here amirite?! i'm happy to say the food here was fantastic. we started with 3 orders of cornbread. they serve it with a side of whipped honey butter (pronounced 'hwipt'). it's about as close to heaven as my godless, sinner ass is going to get to...and i'm ok with that. the cornbread was thick (but not dense), slightly sweet, and a little corny (not unlike my ideal woman...i'm currently taking applications, ladies! slide up in my DMs), slather it with that butter and you just might swallow your tongue. for the main, 5-6 in our party ordered the chicken and waffles. high five to the chef cause he just about made the best gotdamn waffles i ever had the pleasure of sticking in my mouth. it was super thick so i assumed it was going to be cakey and possibly dry. nah, B! this had a crunchy outer layer that gave way to an airy center. crunch then air. drizzle with some sizzurp or if you a boss, order some of that whipped (say it right) honey butter. word to action bronson cause FUCK THAT'S DELICIOUS. what about the fried chicken, tho? moist. that's what's up. i usually don't fuck with breasts...ahem. but they hooked it up here. batter was crunchy but didn't overwhelm (which can happen if you have a heavy hand). i drizzled more sizzurp on this. the weakest part of the dish was the red-eye gravy. i've never been a fan of coffee grounds in anything so i was already not gonna like that. this one meal took up most of our afternoon so we had to forgo some of our other sightseeing but i regret nothing (mainly because i've been to NYC before. lol). i'd come back again for sure (though i'd try to come as early as possible, next time).",13,13,14,Ivan M.,"Seattle, WA",543,332,450

They could.  As we walked, niece decided she needed to eat some fries too and her dad couldn't think of a reason fries would cause her any issues.  I did run back in to see if they cooked them in peanut oil and they do not.  Bear in mind, I had not looked at the menu or asked about allergy ingredients because I was unaware that my niece was going to eat any.  Totally MY bad!After the first two fries, my niece started feeling extremely ""funny"" and did not look good.  We ran home, she got sick, bro-in-law gave her an epi, and we contemplated whether a run to the hospital was needed.  She fell asleep soon thereafter and her hives/ swelling/ blueness started fading.  But it was a pretty scary situation.Once things calmed down, I called RR and the wonderful woman (unfortunately I cannot remember her name) was extremely apologetic and spent 1/2 hour on the phone with me determining what we had ordered (""Uptown Fries"") and what the cause of allergy was.  She even walked down to confirm/ speak with the chefs.  Turns out the fries are mixed with parmesan & herbs.  So we confirmed the cause of my niece's violent and scary reaction, and I learned a lesson I'll not soon forget.  Always ask, no matter what, when out with Dear Little Niece.But I'll never forget the extreme thoughtfulness, compassion, and professionalism of the phone call!",0,0,0,Arti N.,"Seattle, WA",133,305,217

The theme carries throughout the entire place, even down to the uniform of the servers.Upon entry we were seated and served water by a disconnected server.

My girlfriend inquired how the egg was cooked for the EL Jefe and was asked ""What do you want, scrambled?"" While waiting for these items a table was seated next to ours. They were greeted completely different than we were. They were offered different options for water. I had to glance over to make sure it was the same waiter as his demeanor had completely changed.My entree, the El Barrio, was bad. It was essentially like eating a biscuit covered in marinara. The mole was very tomato-y (not a word, I know). The other entree the El Jefe was actually great and was completely eaten.  I was disappointed so I did not order dessert, and I ALWAYS order dessert.

The waffles and chicken will melt in your mouth, you better be hungry if you order the burger,  the blackened catfish will give you a smile, the mac and greens will make you sing and you can sing if you want to, the fried chicken is some of the best I've tried and the shrimp and grits are a must to tryI was there today for a delicious brunch and left my credit card so I almost had an excuse to go back for dinner but I'm skipping dinner tonight I'm still full!

My friend and I stumbled on this place and were really impressed with the quality of the cocktails (these bartenders are most *definitely* 'mixologists') and the food was awesome, super flavorful! We were a walk-in on a Saturday, so we got a... less than desirable seat next to the DJ (read as: extra, extra loud). You know, one of those tables that's almost always open because guests change their mind once they get there? It is what it is lol.Food service was quick despite it being SERIOUSLY packed in there and even drinks weren't too long of a wait.The entire staff was soo well-dressed and stylish!

1.0,4/10/2016,"Worst hostess ever! I went with 2 friends of mine that were visiting NYC and I think this has to be one of my worst dining experiences in the last 2 years that I've been here. I have friends who often come here for drinks but never eat, and after our dinner I now understand why. When we came in, the hostess told us that there was a 45 minutes wait. We said OK, grabbed drinks at the bar, and waited at the back. 45 minutes in I go check in with her, and she tells me (with attitude) that she knows we're here and that she told me there was 1hr30 wait. At this point we're all like OK, we've been waiting so let's just wait.  About 20 min later (so it's 1hrish), my friend goes to double check and says: you told us 45min, then 1h30, which one is it? Then the hostess says we're next in line and that we will have a table in a few. About 2hrs in, still no table but we keep seeing people finishing their dinner and leaving. So we decide to be obnoxious and to go stand right in front of her (since apparently that's what's needed). When she sees us coming, she lies (!) and says that's she been looking for us and couldn't find us.  How?When? Like we were staring at her and the line all the time.  Anyways, she finally finds a spot to squeeze us in and we order our dinner.The most disappointing part is that the food was average. My grits were watered down.  The chicken that my friend had was OK. We left the dinner feeling like the cornbread and the wine were the best thing on the menu.  I was so excited to eat there, and was thinking about bringing my family when they come visit in the summer - but with all the restaurants that NYC has to offer, we will go somewhere else.

We told them that we had theater tickets at the Apollo.They were barely able to serve us one course and take payment in the hour and a half we were there.

3.0,3/30/2016,"I have always wanted to try Marcus Samuelssen's food since I seen him so often in the Food Network's show.  So after I moved to NYC a month ago, I finally found time to try one of his restaurant.  The Red Rooster is located near Sylvie's - one of the long time soul food restaurant in the area.  Red Rooster is a bit more hip. The place was jam packed on a Tuesday night.  The vibe is good. The service is good, and hostess is good too.  Now when it comes to the food, that is why it got a three stars for me.  I ordered the Rooster Burger and asked for medium rare - it came as rare.  My dinner pal ordered a steak and ask for medium rare too, it come as medium.  The kitchen got it wrong both times.  I told the waitress, she offer to take it back to the kitchen and change it.  I travel all the way up to the 125 street to try the food, although the area is a lot better than before, plus it is a week day, I did not want to wait for a re-fry.  So I am a bit disappointed that the kitchen cannot get the meat right.  For a $37 dollar steak it is not too much to ask for the kitchen team to get it right.  The fries was too salty as well.  Although the burger seasoned well.  However, the appetizer, Beet Salad with a Smoky Blue Cheese dressing was fantastic.  The beet was fresh, and smokey favor of the dressing really compliment the greens.  Also for dessert, the daily cake special, last night was coconut cake was good.  It was not too sweet and moist.  Although I think the creme was not necessary.  I thought the plating could have been a bit better.  Our cake came lying side way rather than sitting properly on the plate.  On the bill, it stated that the restaurant prefers master card, and if you pay by master card, you get a present.  Nada!  Nothing, I did not bother to ask.  So there are good and bad about this place.

I was able to book a res the night before which was great. At 5:30 on a Sunday, almost every table was full as was every seat at the bar. The ambience is really really cool - lowkey vibes, good music, etc. As for the food, I am a BIG Dino BBQ wing fan - to me there is nothing better but I thought these wings would give it a run for its money - they didn't. They were good, maybe 6 out of 10 - just not hot enough for me. For my meal I got the mac and greens. It wasn't bad - I'm really not a fan of mac with ziti so that wasn't preferable. The pasta itself also had a plastic-y taste moreso than delicious cheese so that was unfortunate. One thing I will say was that the cornbread was BOMB. Best I've ever had.

Since then, I've (tried) to come back just to sit at the bar for drinks, but as many Harlem-ers know, this place gets swarmed with tourists and is possible to get seating at!Today was definitely one of the best dining experiences I didn't expect to have. My Mom and I had a 5:30 reservation, but we got off a flight early so we decided to come in for drinks at the bar. I felt bad because, especially it being Easter, I knew the staff was trying to prepare for the next shift. The bartender offered to make me something to my liking as we munched on those crispy, salt and sweet chips at the bar. The hostess was very sweet and accommodated us to a table (even though it was still an hour before our rez.) But, the greatest delight was the waiter, Hass, that we had. He graced our table with cornbread (which we wouldn't have ordered otherwise due to the preconceived notion that it's usually too heavy) but it was so light and fluffy, even with the heavy-cream butter. We already knew we wanted the infamous Marcus Samuelsson (who graced the restaurant with his presence!) shrimp & cheddar grits (a perfect portion to share with 4 perfectly seared shrimps dolloped in piri piri sauce) - as well as the beet salad. I honestly did not expect superb service, but everything from plating, to silverware, was on its A game.

You won't get in unless you make a reservation, and your best bet would be to make one on a weeknight.Atmosphere: Loud, trendy, hip, cluttered but in a good way. All the hosts dress impeccably.Food: cornbread is soft and warm, and perfectly paired with the tomato jam and honey butter, although not enough honey in the butter if you ask me. I opted for the hot chicken and waffle as my main course, while the man friend got the fry bird. I usually get nervous with tangy spicy sauces doused over fried chicken with the fear it would be too salty, but this hot chicken was on point. Perfectly moist meat with a tangy kick, that went perfectly well with the waffle and beets. I could hardly taste the syrup but I didn't even mind it because the dish alone was bursting with flavor. The fry bird was delicious as well, very moist chicken. We ordered the crispy kale as a side and man was it pleasant to the palate. The crisp taste of the kale mixed with the sweet apple and walnut was like an umami burst. Then for dinner we shared how about them apples, which is a bourbon custard (like creme brûlée) with gingerbread and sour cream ice cream. That ice cream sounds weird, I know, but it was tart and nutty and out of this world. Such good flavors all around. This place is hefty on the wallet though, we paid about $40ish per person for dinner.

1.0,3/19/2016,"I'll start by saying that the food is pretty good and the atmosphere is really nice. The issue I have with this place is that it seems to always be behind. Now I get that it's a popular place but you'd think that they'd take that into account when taking reservations. I made reservations for dinner with my boyfriend and didn't get seated for 30 mins past our reservation. I don't see the point of having a reservation if I'm still going to wait half an hour to get seated, and the place is not that big so it's not like there's space to stand around and wait.We get seated and it took a long time for the waiter to come by and take our drink orders. Then it took longer to get our food order. Then the food took like 40 mins before it came out so we were just sitting there with our drink for a good chunk of time.Idk if it's an issue with the kitchen or the waiters. The waiters seem to all be just standing around talking and relaxing instead of trying to make things run smoothly and with a place that has the volume of people coming in and out you can't take the time to socialize with coworkers.This isn't my first time there, the first time we went was for our anniversary and it was the same situation. This is a real shame because the food really is good and the prices aren't bad. I would love to go back especially since I live close by and this could be a nice spot to go for drinks and dinner from time to time but I can't deal with the wait times so that'll be my last time going there.I would give it more stars because the food is good, but the quality of the service is so lacking that I can't give this place more than one star.",3,1,0,Andreina M.,"New York, NY",43,11,1

4.0,3/13/2016,"Another place I went for a birthday, at which time I had lots of fun. I had been there before only for the dining, which was okay (the drinks were really good though). I was drawn to the (relatively new, at the time) venue because I had seen Chef Samuelsson, the owner/founder, on several cooking and competitive cooking shows, and the dishes he made always looked good (and tasted good from what the people who tasted these dishes on the shows said). However, the food in this restaurant seemed experimental and weren't really the same types of dishes I saw on the shows. The first time I was there, the waiter seemed to have a bit of an attitude; I ordered a salmon dish, which he told me was raw, but when it came it was smoked (pretty much lox). Apparently he didn't understand that smoked fish is not raw. The dining area was also a bit too crowded for my taste; thank goodness the women sitting sitting next to us were cool and we ended up engaging in pleasant conversation with them. The dish didn't move me at all. The next time I was there (for my birthday), we went to the downstairs lounge area, which I didn't even know existed, at the suggestion of a friend who knew management and met us there. I ordered a modified version of kimchi, which I did not like at all (and I like kimchi), but my date liked his dish (I cannot recall what it was; maybe it's in one of the pictures we took) and mine, so it wasn't wasted. My date felt bad about it, but I didn't make a stink because I was enjoying the company. The reason I gave the restaurant 4 stars: beside the not-so-good (but not-so-terrible - I've experience much worse) waiter we encountered during the first visit, the rest of the staff was awesome and super-friendly, and I loved, loved, loved the lounge area and the whole experience, especially the second time around. The first time wasn't bad either, but I imagine if we didn't sit next to such pleasant people. That was one of the best birthdays I've ever had.

We started with Prosecco, surprisingly good, and then jumped right into a couple of Southern Comfort dishes. I had my Swedish aunt over for her 50th birthday so I wanted here to try some stuff from my neck of the woods. Hot chicken with waffles... Wow! Like being back home in Nashville. Perfect balance between the spicy heat and the maple syrup sweetness. Top of the line! The size is perfect for two people to share. The fried green tomatoes was equally fab. Served with pimento cheese, crisp and tasty. For entrees we tried a number of things. The Mac&cheese was excellent (don't forget to add Lobster, the Lobster part is generous and really makes this a meal)  Helgas Swedish meatballs was equally delightful. I tried to make my stepdaughter agree with me that my own Swedish meatballs was as good but.... Well all I can say is that this is a solid choice for entree. Creamy, smooth mashed potatoes comes with it, only missed some lingonberry jam. Some in our company went for steak, one came out well done instead of medium rare... but they fixed that mistake somewhat fast. Mama P's fried fish with golden rice was on the other hand cooked to perfection. It had a perfect crusty surface and was still juicy inside. The dish is served with chili sauce, not too spicy, just Asian flavorsome.For dessert I have to say, have the doughnuts!!! We tried a couple of other alternatives too, but I will not mention them, because you MUST have the doughnuts. No pressure. HaI had pre ordered and paid for a couple of bottles of bubbles that where to be served upon arrival as a surprise, however they were not there and I had to ask for them and wait for them to arrive which took a bit of the fun out of that, they where also supposed to be delivered with a greeting card, never saw that one.

I wasn't a fan of the tomato jam but cornbread was fantastic just by itself. Dense, buttery, and so filling. I knew I was off to a great start.I had the yardbird. The portion was huge- I could have easily split it with 2 other people.  I barely got through one of the two pieces of the fried chicken. It was fried SO well- the only other place I've had chicken fried this well was in Nashville. Amazingly-seasoned, it required nothing else.  Creamy-buttery mashed potatoes with greens were a perfect sides to the chicken. Fun, hip ambiance, good service, good food.

I loved the cocktail they made and the burger that I had was excellent. I never hang out in Harlem because I always think it is too far but this restaurant would make me go back to Canada...I mean the north of Manhattan. We had a surprise during the evening. The Chef Marcus Samuelsson came to his restaurant and we had a big fan at our table who wanted to took a picture. I am sure that as a Kitchen Celebrity he is asked a lot to get photographed but I felt ( and other Coworker too) that he was very distant and didn't really care of us. I would have love him to exchange a little bit more with us as we were a table of 16.. . Anyway, The food and service was good and I also liked downstairs with the musicians.

I loved the color scheme too.We arrived a little after 9p.m. to a packed house. There wasn't anywhere to sit in the place so we ended up standing nearly the entire time. The band was INCREDIBLE. I can't recall their name but they were really good. I'd go back to NY just to see them perform again if that says anything.

The locals were all really friendly as well. I went with a group of friends who live in NYC who said they stopped going to Red Rooster because it's so expensive but I didn't order food so I can't really comment on that.

4.0,2/22/2016,"It seems like it's hip to hate on this place right now, and I just don't know why. I had a really good, though not transcendent, meal at Red Rooster this past Saturday night. It was crowded, as one is led to expect, but the lively atmosphere around the bar only enhanced a fun, hip ambience. Chef Marcus Samuelsson, who dresses very much like Tom Baker's incarnation of Doctor Who, was in attendance and treated a number of fabulous looking patrons to a generous schmooze. The hip looking waitstaff was attentive and knowledgable about the menu.We started off with the cornbread, which is really bonkers in moistness and intensity of corn flavor but if I found out the nutrition facts I'm sure I'd jump out a window. We also had the gravlax (gotta get at least something Swedish) which was very good gravlax but just that.I had the infamous fried yardbird, which is an excellent fried drumstick and split breast with ribmeat combo. This is not special, different fried chicken. It is very normal, but very moist and crispy. It gets a lot of points for raw competence, and is a reminder that not all good food needs to be weird. It was served with two excellent sauces, one of which was tangy and red and the other creamy and aromatic. I have no idea what was in either of them or even what they were supposed to taste like, I just know that I ate both with a spoon at various junctures. The mashed potatoes and collards that come with are also both normal and competent.I dined with three companions and was lucky enough to try their entrees. The Broadway Drunken Noodle is a fun twist on an undefined south/southeast asian stir fry noodle. It's a little oily and a little sweet but the flavors are good, if not inspiring. It comes with a braised short rib that is good like all braised short rib is, but the star of the show is a sweet, tender octopus tentacle that you will enjoy unless you are insane. The grilled salmon is pretty good, moist and tender, flavorful, but it's just a salmon filet.The main misstep of the evening was the blackened catfish, which was boring and mushy, but really, no one should ever order blackened catfish anywhere.To drink, I had the Ziggy Stardust, a Margarita-ish tequila cocktail that tastes like sour candy. It's fine. My dining companion had the Obamatini, a much more interesting drink with pineapple ciroc and a hot pepper something something component. Fun!I see a lot of people on here complaining about the prices. I mean, is this joint kinda overpriced? For sure, but I don't think it purports to be anything other than an expensive restaurant. I am sure this is not the best soul food place in Harlem, it is just the one that is an expensive restaurant a few steps from the train.

5.0,2/18/2016,"Living up to all the hype, Red Rooster delivers. Although I succumbed to the unreasonable pressures of an unnamed dining companion to get the Harlem Chowder for Two, which was a noteworthy seafood epic best described as a monster paella without the rice. Good, but seafood is not the correct play here. Instead, the Fried Bird Royale for Two was insanely good. Not your typical buttermilk and battered southern fried chicken. This bird was expertly seasoned with a magical concoction (which included some curry powder?), then dropped in a fryer whole and brought to a perfectly crispy and juicy state. See my pics of both. The cornbread was beyond any I've tried, albeit the butter quotient was off the hook and worthy of an American Heart Association warning.Very hip urban Harlem atmosphere, throbbing music and a great buzz from the patrons from neighborhoods well removed from Harlem and even NYC.Service was good, even dealing with a very demanding member of our party (also who will remain unnamed).

1.0,2/12/2016,"Food -- Stay away. Overhyped, overpriced and unimaginative. The mac and greens were served after being under a heat lamp so long that an oily pool formed and all the pasta stuck together (and not in the creamy way). It lacked depth of flavor and was one note. Barely edible. The shrimp and grits was a shockingly small portion (for $30!) of both shrimp (very small -- think maybe the thumb of a small ten year old child) and the grits were mainly cream and had no texture. Lastly, the migas were overcooked eggs with a heavy tomato paste based salsa (almost like a jar of supermarket salsa).Service/atmosphere -- The space is bright, well appointed and a good size. Service was ok, but I'm surprised they served the oily mess of mac and greens to us.

My restaurant week lunch did not disappoint. First of all, the space itself is beautiful. Even in a city with countless stunning restaurants, Red Rooster's modern decor, which honors the history of the neighborhood, was quite impressive. The food, of course, was delicious. I ordered a wonderful black bean and ham soup with celery-apple cream (the accompanying grilled bread made the dish), and my main of ""Swedish"" meatballs with mashed potatoes was quite tasty as well. The star of the meal for me, though, was the dessert--unassuming mini sweet potato doughnuts that tasted like the culinary child of a sufganiyot and a pumpkin empanada.

We took the subway. .. super easy and direct.  Pretty much walked out the station and there it was (lots of other cool bars and restaurants in the same area too)As you enter the Red Rooster you could be mistaken for thinking this is just a bar, as a huge C shaped bar takes up the whole space.  The eating part of the restaurant is actually further back.

4.0,2/10/2016,"Internationally influenced new American comfort food.  The bar's winding u-shape occupies the front of the house and feels like a friend's cozy loft with high ceilings, bookcases and black heritage ephemera gathered from years of international travel and musical interest.  A floor to ceiling back bar wall separates it from the sit down dining room and open kitchen decorated like an upscale luncheonette.  Overall, the vibe is cool upscale uptown-local, downtown vibe best kept secret jazz dinner club (even though the secret is out).  I kinda felt like Harlem is the coolest (and one of the last cool) neighborhoods in NYC.  I wandered down Malcom X Blvd after and mazed at the brownstones.  As a Makers Mark Manhattan drinker, I was not a fan of the specialty bourbon cocktail 'Bourbon Negroni' but received a buy back at the end of the night which was a nice old school tradition rarely occurring now a days.  The crowd is all ages, mixed race/couples, hip, friendly and dressed to impress.  In honor of Mardi Gras, there was an energetic Jazz Quartet that brought out the boogie woogie in the crowd.  Service was friendly, attentive but possibly a tad overwhelmed once or twice (but remained cool) and dressed more for dive bar (I'm female, and late forties so I expect price-to-service matching experience).  Servers were dressed more in keeping with the trend of the experience.Hostess is excellent as well and there is a coat check (thank goodness as I had winter coat and work bags in tow).  The ""Yard Bird"" fried chicken was really good, but served in the skillet atop a cutting board and a little hard to manage.I highly recommend a visit, I'll definitely be going back as I work in the neighborhood every few weeks.",0,0,0,Kelly S.,"Short Hills, NJ",3,48,18

Delicious! We ended up with a pitcher of red sangria (yum!).

They have excellent cornbread, and last time I was here the Barrio Biscuit was delicious. I'm not sure what happened to them between then and now, but unless today was a fluke, they have definitely gone downhill. I ordered the same dish as last time, the Barrio Biscuit, but this time the ""mole"" tasted like canned tomato sauce. For $16 I got a couple of ordinary biscuits covered with what appeared to be canned tomato sauce, canned corn and pickled red onions, and one fried egg. When I asked the server where the ""apple sausage"" was, she said that it was ""in the sauce"", which was clearly untrue unless they had grounded it down to a tasteless, impercebtible mush. The drinks have also gone downhill (my Red Eye Rooster mostly tasted like Valentina hot sauce), and my roommate said the burger he ordered had no flavor. When I stated I was unsatisfied with my meal, the server offered to change it for something else, so I ordered the deviled eggs, which was $8 for 3 overcooked egg halves. I would not complain if this place were not so overpriced and overhyped, but I could have eaten the same thing for a quarter of the price had I ordered biscuits from Popeye's and poured a can of tomato sauce over them. I will not be returning here anymore, which is pretty sad since I live so close.",0,0,0,Naomi H.,"Manhattan, NY",2,1,0
3.0,1/30/2016,"DISCLAIMER: As a foodie, when people are ranting & raving about a restaurant, it's bound to spark my interest. This was the case with Red Rooster. For about 2 years, it has come up time & time again as a must-try and as such has been on my list for quite some time. With that in mind, I must admit that I found it to be a bit overrated. Between the high prices & small portions, it wasn't as amazing as I hoped. Nonetheless, I enjoyed my experience. My partner and I came during the Restaurant Week lunch and were extremely satisfied with the meal & service. We both started off with the lentil soup which came with savory toasted garlic bread that had a nice ""kick"" to it. For the 2nd course, I had the mac & greens which was delectable and he had the salmon which was also very tasty. The 3rd course was Red Rooster's famous doughnuts which were delicious and obviously freshly baked. All of that considered, there are certainly similar establishments with budget-friendly prices so if you're not caught up in the hype, I'd say you could pass on it. However, if like myself you're really curious about the famous Red Rooster, I would recommend visiting during Restaurant Week or with a voucher.",3,0,0,Janai S.,"Bronx, NY",1,43,2
1.0,1/29/2016,"I went to Red Rooster for the first time today with great excitement. I heard so many great things about this place. My meal was not outstanding -which was happy to overlook because I spent more time talking to my date. We ordered 3 courses and all but the last came out in a timely fashion. We ordered donuts which they took 20 minutes to bring out. Again, I was willing to overlook the 20 delay because I was engrossed in a fantastic conversation. However, I became inflamed after the donuts came out. As an apology the manager had a single glass of white wine given to my date. Given to my DATE!  I called the host over just to be sure the wine was not misdelivered. She told me point blank that the manager wanted to comp him (my date) with the glass. I was humiliated by this action. Perhaps management should note that when they comp a table with a gentleman and lady sitting at it it's bad form to give the drink to the man and blow off the woman as she calmly smiles and points out the slight.  I WILL NEVER GIVE RED ROOSTER A DIME OF MY MONEY.judging from the apathy of the staff, I doubt they would care.",2,0,1,Hope C.,"New York, NY",151,5,0
5.0,1/28/2016,"If you haven't started thinking of Harlem as a destination for fantastic food, you really need to check out Red Rooster! Granted, it's much more high brow than its immediate surroundings, but as soon as you step in the door, you're immersed by so much culture and the entire place smells mouth watering! Bar seating is first come first serve and the complete menu is available, but we had made reservations for the dining room.I didn't know what to expect in terms of flavor and portion size, so we probably pestered the waiter far more than the average table (thanks, David!) He told us that the corn bread would be more than enough to match our Shrimp and Grits and Yard Bird entrees. Every bite from beginning to end was packed with taste and spices and food-gasm greatness! By the time we were done, it was late enough for the in house band to start playing, and we just sat there and chilled while finishing off our pitcher of red sangria.

After minutes of waiting and no waiter to even put a glass of water at our table we decided to move ourselves by the bar. Once again the kind hostess approached us and ask if everything was ok and apologized for no waiter. The bar staff was super friendly but didn't really know the menu or ingredients. The cornbread is to die for, one of the best I've ate, I ordered the Mac and greens and I've never in my life have seen so much grease in my life I was unable to eat it because it was soaked in at least  a cup of visible oil at the bottom of the cast iron skillet that it comes in and the skillet is not deep.

However, the waiter was extremely rude for the first 45 minutes we were there. He couldn't have made it clearer that he was not happy to be waiting on us. He seemed to warm up after a while so maybe he was having a bad day but we're pretty easy restaurant patrons who went out of way to respond positively to his negative attitude.  Any other patron wouldn't have left a tip. I think it took over an hour and a half to eat and pay. We weren't in a hurry but would have gladly vacated the table much more swiftly if we hadn't had to wait so long. I ordered the shrimp and grits. It was a pretty small portion for the price even by New York standards but my biggest complaint is that it was completely cold! The redeeming factor is that it did have good flavor but not exactly enjoyable since it wasn't heated through.

4.0,1/22/2016,"Finally! I've finally made it to Red Rooster....it's only taken a few years. But anyway, I came here for the Restaurant Week lunch menu this past Tuesday. We ordered the squash salad and the best part was the soft braised squash and the sliced pears...the vinaigrette was too over powering and I felt there was not enough feta (hey don't be stingy with the feta!). I am a huge fan of the roasted salmon, even though I didn't order it (my husband did and I basically ate his food and mine!). The salmon had a lovely crispy skin and was just plain yummy! This is why I gave it a 4-star and not a 3! I ordered the meatballs and mashed potatoes but I only liked the buttery mashed potatoes...the meatballs were ok and I just really didn't like the braised green cabbage they put underneath. The donuts are a signature, I guess??? I really wanted more of that sweet peachy stuff that was the filling inside the donuts...I felt like I was being teased....'oh here's just a taste, but you'll have to come back for more'...is it just me that daydreams about my food talking to me??",1,0,0,Amina-Louise J.,"San Diego, CA",94,160,480

2.0,1/20/2016,"Came here on a recent weekend for a $45 prix fixe brunch. You best believe it better be on point for $45. This didn't include alcohol, so I'd suggest you stay away from that or your bill will go up up up!The chicken and waffles was delicious, though the portion looked paltry compared to the other dishes like the mac and cheese and the meatballs and mashed potatoes. The cheese on the mac and cheese was very very heavy. Bring your lactaid pills.The corn bread, meatballs, grits, and chicken sausage were all very good. I would recommend the food here to anyone.The 2 stars comes from the part at the end of the meal where they charged the birthday girl for those who were unable to attend the meal. We had reservations. Sure, they will reimburse her later they said, but for a person to bring $900 worth the business to a restaurant and then have to have a conversation at the end of the meal saying they would be charging her and then reimbursing her is an exercise in repetitious insanity that I do not understand. I cannot stress how idiotic this is, and urge them to change it. I will not be hosting a similar meal in the near future for this reason. Short sighted, and unprofessional. Why would you leave someone and their guests with this as a last note as they leave?By the way, this all only came to light after we noticed the discrepancy on the check. Apparently they didn't know how many people they served. If they can't keep track of that I'm wondering what else they're not paying attention to. How clean is the kitchen, for instance?The individual servers did a fine job. A commendable job, even. The management needs  improvement. The policies need improvement, whatever the fuck left a sour taste in our mouths at the end of the meal needs improvement. Fix it. I'd stay away here until they do or you'll be liable for money.

5.0,1/7/2016,"What a great night at Red Rooster! We made a reservation with friends for New Year's Eve. We showed up to a great DJ who played lots of funk, retro hip-hop, and jazz. The vibe was immediately welcoming and on point. The hosts sat us within about 15-20 minutes of our reservation, but we did not care because everyone was in such a celebratory mood. We were sat at a nice table near the open kitchen in the intimate dining room. The only slightly off thing about the night was that our waiter seemed a bit aloof. Perhaps he was having an off night. Either way, the meal was great. I enjoyed the Rooster Punch (red sangria) and one of my friends enjoyed the Obamatini. Before we even got the food, Marcus Samuelsson himself was walking around smiling and greeting tables. He came over to our table twice to say, ""Happy New Year,"" shake our hands, and ask how everything was going. So friendly and welcoming. I've had other friends who've been to RR multiple times and also saw him there, actively overseeing his own restaurant, even as a celebrity chef. I thought it was nice that the RR staff passed out NYE horns, hats, streamers, champagne, etc., so that everyone could take part in the countdown at midnight. My husband and friends ordered off of the prix fixe (and they enjoyed things like a short rib salad, a BBQ lamb shank entree, a crabcake app, the duck entree, etc.) I thought it was very cool that I was allowed to order off the regular menu, albeit with limited options. But I was happy to order the corn bread for the table (AMAZING with the sugar butter), the chicken and waffles appetizer (very good and a fairly big appetizer), the mac and cheese for us to share at the table (fairly good), and the Swedish meatballs (good) with mashed potatoes (with cheddar I think, and delicious!)

We have eaten grits all over this country and have never had such a tender & creamy offering. So delicious.

This place is awesome - it's a gem, not only in Harlem, but in New York in general. With eyes bigger than our stomachs, my friend and I ordered: cornbread, deviled eggs, sunchokes (they were seasonal), gravlax and two entrees. Yes, we were subsequently rolled out a-la Violet Beauregard in Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.-Cornbread: delicious! Served with a tomato-y jam and honey butter, it was perfectly baked, soft and flavorful. Do not miss out on ordering this!-Deviled Eggs: Three come in an order, and so we got the chicken skin mayo on the side for my friend to try. Even without the mayo I didn't feel like my egg was missing a thing. Plus, it wasn't heavy like so many deviled eggs are.Sunchokes - again, these were a seasonal special and they were cooked and seasoned really well (albeit a teeny bit greasy, but I didn't mind.)Gravlax - my friend loved the lightness of this dish. It cut through a lot of the heavy egg/cornbread food we were chowing down on.For my entree, I opted for the mac & greens. Unbelievable! While the portion is definitely heavy,  it was extremely flavorful. The mac and cheese was good on its own and when added with the greens, I couldn't stop eating it. Due to the amount of food I had already consumed, there was more than enough for me to take home.My friend ordered Helga's Meatballs - a contemporary spin on Swedish meatballs.

5.0,12/19/2015,"Red Rooster did not disappoint. We went on a Friday night with no reservations, fully expecting a crowd and a wait. We ended up snagging two seats at the bar and loved every minute of our experience. The bartenders were wonderful. Attentive and entertaining. We started off with a couple cocktails-- The Harlem Mule (awesome) and a Negroni (a bit sweet for my liking, but still a solid drink). We noshed on the deviled eggs (so so good) and corn bread (which was basically a vehicle to get the honey butter and tomato jam in my mouth). For dinner, we went for the special fried fish and it was out of this world. We also got the mac and cheese and krispy kale, both awesome. We rounded out the evening with a couple more cocktails. The Brownstone was the best cocktail of the night (nutmeg infused bourbon is apparently a thing!). All in all, an incredible experience. Worth every penny.",0,0,0,Chase G.,"Charleston, SC",423,8,12

The succulent wings were right up there with the best I've ever tasted. I needed one of the warm towels they brought to the table after we we done. I might have embarrassed myself by licking my fingers clean without the towel. For dinner we had the salmon dish and meatball dish. The salmon was perfectly cooked and tasty, but came with a weak vegetable side. Luckily, I had enough mashed potatoes with my meatballs to share. The meatballs were perfectly cooked delicious meatballs. We also ordered cornbread on the side. The cornbread was so good that we ordered more to take home.Chef Marcus Samuelsson's food does not disappoint at Red Rooster. I also like his green teas, and they are cheaper to buy from his restaurant than online. But I had to buy the teas from the bar which turned out to be a hassle.

The menu is brief but has enough options to satisfy whatever you are craving. My table settled on the squash salad, meatballs, salmon and a side of broccolini. The service was friendly and the food came out pretty fast. The squash salad was the perfect balance of sweet and tangy. I loved the freshness of the greens against the warm sweet squash and pickled apples. The broccolini was the most amazing veggie I have ever tasted! It was grilled with a slight smokey flavor that took away all bitterness usually associated with broccolini. The meatballs will literally melt in your mouth.

4.0,11/25/2015,"My bf had been dying to eat here for over a year and we finally made it to the Red Rooster. We had a reservation for six and the restaurant was super busy and there was an hour wait for those without reservations, so I highly recommend making a reservation.  I liked the restaurant's vibe and decor. We had the pork rib appetizer and it was probably my favorite part of the meal.  I usually am not a huge fan of ribs,  but these were crispy and had a great sauce. We also had the cornbread, which is absolutely fantastic. So much regret,  I should have ordered two plates of ribs (I don't think my bf was as crazy for these as I was, whatever).For our meal, we got the yard bird for two as did many other people. The chicken isn't greasy or dry,  but I wasn't a massive fan of the breading.  The breading is very crispy but kind of thin and not seasoned well (some people seem to disagree). The breast part suffers from a low breading to meat ratio but my bf and I really enjoyed the dark meat (usually he doesn't like fried dark meat,  he's wrong but he's learning the severity of his mistake). My bf loved the waffles and I preferred the biscuits, and we both fought over the mac and greens. I don't think I'd get the yard bird for two again, not that it was bad, I just think there's probably some other awesome dishes to be tried. The drinks at this place are sort of strange... let me try to explain. Between the two of us we tried five different cocktails,  none of which were extremely delicious. You will find strong flavored and boozy drinks that you can tell are made with care and good ingredients and have had a lot of thought behind them. They weren't bad by any means,  just different.I enjoyed the service,  everyone was very friendly. A server accidentally spilled some of a drink on my boyfriend's suit,  accidents happen and the staff were very responsive and gave him tonic to try to help.  I have had a similar experience occur at other restaurants and they would offer to have it dry cleaned (even if you don't take the offer its at least offered). With the reputation and level of service (not to mention the fact that the drink did stain) I thought it was strange that they didn't offer to have it dry cleaned. Meh. I think it's easy for people to give this place a bad review bc they may have extremely high expectations and it is pricey (which isn't necessarily fair). I thought the food was good,  nothing was close to unpleasant. I do think it's a little over-hyped but I'd gladly return and get more ribs and try other dishes. My bf definitely enjoyed it more than I did (in comparing our own ratings I gave it a 7/10 and he gave it a 8.5/10).Tl:dr solid food, maybe a bit over-rated but I would def come back.",0,0,0,Britt M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,52,0

My friend I ate with already wrote a review, but this was such a bad experience (which we paid dearly for $$$) that I felt I had to share. The hostess seated us without any menus- thankfully after 10 min the table behind us gave us theirs, though it took another 10 min for us to get the lunch menu. Our server took forever (despite us being her only table at the time...) and though I can't speak for my friend's food, I ordered the fried chicken sandwich with the mayo on the side, she assured me it was only ""a little mayo""... My sandwich arrived sans all sauce (it took the staff three trips to just bring my friend his soup, bread, and spoon...) the chicken was fried well and nice and crispy, but it was completely devoid of flavor and had so much mayo all over it that I couldn't eat 80% of it. Also, I have never been somewhere where they basically put an entire cilantro plant, stems and all on my food. It was actually comical how big of a pile of cilantro was on my plate. I've worked in celebrity chef restaurants for years and this have been fortunate enough to eat at a lot of amazing restaurants with famous chefs, this was honestly the worst experiences (possibly because I was so excited to come and eat here, I set the bar too high...) apparently the donuts are amazing, but anyone can throw batter into a deep fryer.

To start I had the cornbread, nice sized slices and the flavored butter made the already wonderful bread even better. As a main course I had the shrimp hog & grits. And it. Was. Ahh-mazing!!! A bed of the smoothest grits I've ever had, topped with greens that reminded me so much of home I almost called my grandmother just to say ""hi"".  Atop the greens, perfectly seasoned shrimp, shallots, pickled onions and hog bits. I loved the presentation, everything stacked. I was full by the end and sad the food was gone. To drink I had the Strivers Rowers, a yummy raspberry, sage, peach, bourbon, honey and prosecco concoction sent from somewhere amazing. For dessert I had the brownie sundae. It says it's for two people but if you are full or dining with someone who doesn't have a real sweet tooth it may be too much to finish.

This fried yard bird was cooked like the chef did just that. It's was too wet and fatty. The skin was not crispy. The only thing I enjoyed was the shake that they give you to sprinkle on top.

4.0,10/16/2015,"Red rooster is the take on soul food from famed chef Marcus Samuelsson, the space occupies two floors and is very spacious and airy with a multi curved bar at the entrance. And the restaurant is jam packed. The ambiance and crowd are of a mix of locals and some outer neighborhood diners eager to sample a taste of their menu and uptown experience. As far as the concept, I would define it as a successful business, it caters for the feel of the moment and permits yourself to actually spend several hours in the space. Due to live music downstairs and full dining upstairs. Food is as you can imagine very well  executed, and offers you a large range of options, from your southern specialties like chicken and waffles, shrimps and grits to more continental entrees like their dry - aged ribeye with bordelaise.Service is casual but precise and the staff has a trendy flair, prices are on a upper side but not exhorbitant. Bar offerings are a combinations of very well crated house cocktails as well as an affordable international wine list with a focus on new world's wines. If you scored tickets to the Appolo for a show, this probably the best place for a pre show dinner or post show drinks in the vicinity.Harlem is by far my favorite neighborhood in the city...",2,0,0,Jacques R.,"New York, NY",469,112,59

4.0,10/9/2015,"This was a random girl's lunch on a Wednesday afternoon so we decided to go to Red Rooster. We arrived about 4 pm to find out it was a 30 minute wait for a table of 3. The place was packed with a variety of people. The bathroom decor was very classic. But the 30 minute wait turned into an hr wait and an hr and half later we were seated at a high top table with 2 other guest. If you don't want to sit next to people you don't know request another table. The stools were very uncomfortable after awhile. But the bookshelf was decorated with old books, pictures, spices, it felt very home like as if i was in someones living room which i loved. We were seated directly behind the dj booth so it was very difficult to hear each other but the music was great. Our server wasnt very helpful, he took our drink orders and 20 mins passed and we had to flag someone else down to get our drinks. So this young lady decided to be our server for the rest of the night. She was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. I ordered the corn bread for starters, it was dense but good with pieces of corn in it. I also ordered the sangria which i was told was a pre made punch which tasted more like juice. For my entree i ordered the yardbird, which is dark meat fried chicken with mash potatoes and i ordered a side of mac n cheese.

1.0,10/9/2015,"WOW. What a huge disappointment. Yes the fried chicken was good, but not any better than KFC. The deviled eggs were weird, why give 3 halves of 2 eggs, where did the fourth half go? The eggs were sitting on a roasted pepper (?) humus (?) that was grainy and heavy. The corn bread was OK, but it had what I assume was candied pieces of actual corn that literally stuck to every tooth in the back of my mouth. I had to pick and peel them off (apologies to my date). No bueno. For entrees we had the chicken (sure it was fine) and the blackened catfish which was the greatest offender. The catfish was smothered in spices that were mushy and turned to a paste in my mouth, the fish was watery and flavorless, and I bet it was frozen. Overall, waste of money and waste of time.

I finally was able to try the fried yardbird (they fry it twice) and its a tasty piece of dark meat.  I would have preferred a little more salt but the hot sauce went with it just fine.  Buttered pickles were the perfect compliment to the chicken.  A side of mashed potatoes and collard greens (spicy) and i was in for a full lunch.All in all this visit was a great one.  A house cocktail and Red Rooster Doughnuts with Sweet Potato filling were out of this world.

3.0,10/7/2015,"Great food; poor execution.  Though this restaurant blew our taste buds out of the water, it was the service that left much to be desired.We arrived a bit late for our reservations but we were luckily seated as two spots had opened up at the chefs table in the back.  We were greeted by A waitress and we gave her our drink orders and appetizers.  First round of drinks did not take long--and yes chef and their red sangria.  Hubby didn't like his yes chef drink too much--he didn't care for the bebere spice.  Food:  We ordered the shrimp and dirty rice as an appetizer, their beef kitfo, shrimp and grits and the pepper steak.  All dishes were great! My personal favorite were the shrimp and dirty rice--sure it tasted like dirty rice however there was something in it that I just can't put my finger on as to what particular spice they used.  Either way, it was delicious!  Although my husband loved his pepper steak, they advertised that it came with potato croquettes--which he noted there were no potatoes of any kind on his plate.  A quick mention to the manager (she was making rounds) and she brought out a plate of French fries...Definitely not croquettes from what I googled but he was satisfied nonetheless.  Service: The service started off ok.  When we were seated at the chef's table, we were moved about 10 minutes into the service.  They had a party of 7 that would need room and they offered us another table and drinks on the house.  Who would turn that down? Well we were seated at the other table and drinks were on the house.  But somewhere in our seat change we were forgotten about as far as our dinner was concerned.  The reason is because we witnessed two groups who had come in AFTER us get their entree's BEFORE us.  Wasn't very happy at all considering the price paid overall I expect better service than that.  I know no one restaurant is perfect, however, the higher the price the higher my expectation is.  We brought it up to our waitress, which to be honest we weren't really sure if she was our waitress or not.  We had our food 15 minutes later (they had to remake it I guess).  Other than that, our waitress, whoever she may have been, was pretty much non-existent.  She came by to make sure we got our food (it wasn't the same girl we approached who had brought out our food), and then when we wanted our check to leave.  I've had better service at Golden Corral.Restaurant itself:  Pretty hip and fun.  Noisier than what I am used to but I didn't really mind that.  People were just having a good time and it seemed to host an easy going crowd of folks. Attire of everyone there appeared to be casual--there is no need to dress up unless you are into that sort of thing.Overall, I enjoyed our food journey.  However, the drivers of that journey (the waitstaff), need to be retrained or something.  I can see me coming back to this restaurant in the distant future for the food and ambiance alone.",6,0,0,Marie R.,"Chesapeake, VA",26,285,228

1.0,9/28/2015,"I'm confused why anyone with taste buds would enjoy this place. Not one, but three different friends later confirmed they also had awful food here. I ordered the blackened catfish. Blackened catfish is supposed to be cooked with a spice rub. It's a pretty basic dish. I didn't realize it was even possible to screw it up. The fish seemed like it was poached and then on top was some sort of bland gravy type sauce. What the heck is that? It had absolutely nothing to do with blackened catfish. The deviled eggs were basic. Nothing special. They were the kind of thing I can and have easily could make at home. But that's the problem. When you go out, you want something special and different. Not the case here.My friend ordered the shrimp, hog and grits, which was also bland, bland, and more bland. I just DON'T get it. I can only think Marcus S has a lot of connections and good PR. And the hype has brought people here. Unfortunately as is the case for many restaurants in NYC it's more about hype than good food. I grew up with an Indian mother who cooked food from scratch every day (from Italian to Thai to Mexican to Indian) using something I like to call ""spices"". I can only surmise most people did not grow up like that. If you are the former, you will NOT like this place.

It was also ten bucks to go downstairs to the supper club but the music was good. Didn't know the DJ name but he/she was on point. The drinks were flowing and strong! (A cocktail was 12 bucks).

5.0,9/18/2015,"This is absolutely the best meal I've had in North America in the past year.The food was so good that I think I almost cried and that's no lie. To start, I had the cornbread. I'm not a huge cornbread fan. I either love it or it's the most disgusting thing on the planet.  Normally, I wouldn't order it but, I wanted a starter to get a feel for what the meal could be like. It was perfect, moist and delicious, and the apple-butter spread went great with it. There was also a marinara type of spread available for more adventurous palettes.As a main course I ordered the Yard Bird. This consisted of a leg and thigh and a side of mashed potatoes and greens.  My first taste was of the mashed potatoes and they had more flavor than I could have even began to imagine.  There was an light garnish of, I assume, fried onion straws atop the greens and potatoes.  Next I tasted the greens which I'd normally never eat out in public, nor at home, for that matter, thinking that they'd be bearable to palette as well.  They did not disappoint. They weren't overpowered by flavors of meat as is often typical of ""southern style"" cuisine. They were instead simply fresh and seasoned well enough to be flavorful but still remind me that they belong to the plant kingdom. As for the main portion of my entree, the chicken was great.  The skin was well done, almost blackened, but in a flavorful way, not the burnt charcoal flavor type way. The meat of the chicken was moist, juicy, even, in some spots especially on the thigh.  It was perfect.  The portion size seemed small at first presentation but was actually well balanced.  However, I wasn't ""starving"" before I showed up but I was definitely full upon completion of the meal.To drink I had the Harlem Mule.  Great drink; I highly recommend it.Dessert, I ordered the fudge brownie.

The cornbread sort of made up for the Mac & Cheese but I still wasn't impressed. I've had better cornbread. It was moist, soft, and hot.

A microcosm of the social forces shaping Harlem, Red Rooster itself was notably separated along racial lines; while the bar/front of the building was packed with well-dressed Black patrons enjoying a spirited happy hour, behind the divider in the restaurant proper sat a majority Upper East Side white and touristy population sampling soul/Swede fusion. That distribution persisted throughout the course of the night.No shame in sitting at the communal table - all the better to see the lovely dishes leave the kitchen. Winners include the Yardbird - deep fried chicken thigh and drumstick, as well as the cornbread. Interestingly, the peanut chicken was breasts and wings, allowing the procurer to buy whole chickens! Swedish meatballs with lingonberry sauce were above average, but there's not much that can be done to sexy up Swedish meatballs.Shared the table with European tourists, who ordered the Yardbird after seeing our delight.

The service is friendly but slow. The place is big so it seemed to get backed up easily. But chef sent out fried chicken while people were waiting.I had great sangria, the water melon said was great. So was he beef kitfo. Our favorites were the fried chicken and the deviled eggs though. The menu options are pretty unique - so it's for adventurous eaters who like a lot of flavor.

3.0,8/25/2015,"Red Rooster is a go-to place for anyone visiting NYC for the first time. It's got a great ambiance and there's always a good crowd. However, I do feel like their menu could be much better. With the legendary and affordable Sylvia's right next door, you'd think that RR would step up their game a bit. For one, there weren't very many vegetarian options on the menu. Secondly, the food that we did end up ordering was just ok. For the price that one pays at this lovely establishment, you want to rave about it. My sister and I went to the jazz lounge downstairs which was nice, however the drink service was slow. Again, RR is a solid stop in your list of NYC things to do, but just don't have super high expectations.",0,0,0,Tiffany W.,"Queens, NY",50,100,145
5.0,8/25/2015,"I stopped in here at noon on a Friday and left impressed. Overall it's my kinda place. Nice feel, nice vibe, nice clientele. Similar to the DC-area Busboys and Poets, the look and feel of the place just rub me the right way. There's outdoor seating and inside the area is split between a bar area in the front half and seated dining in the back half. My bartender was very nice and suggested and even offered me a sip of a rooster sangria I didn't consider. All three of the rooster sangrias were great with the Rooster Punch maybe being my favorite (They're all great). I got the chopped chicken salad, which would make you think it was a mayonnaise-type chicken salad but wasn't. It was light and tasty and I really liked it (the egg and avocado were a nice touch). The place is easy enough to get to and the location isn't hard to find. I imagine it's a busy and popular place so I'm glad I went when I did. The bartender even offered me a survey card to fill out, no doubt sensing my positive experience. I said good things about her and the place.

Got here and it wasn't that busy at all, so I checked in with the hostess and asked if we could sit outside and she said there was a 15-20 minute wait, which was super odd as there were plenty of seats outside. We went to the bar to wait for our table and I have to say, the bar staff was completely oblivious. For the 20 minutes we sat there, not one single bar staff addressed us until I asked for a menu. We were ready to order a drink but no one (including the bartender who handed me a menu) came to take our order, so we decided to just order drinks at the table.After that, we were hoping that the service would be better at the table and it was! Our waiter was super friendly and accommodating. I ordered a Bloody Mary and my boyfriend ordered the Yes Chef cocktail. His was extremely refreshing and the Bloody was OK. We ordered wayyy too much food because we have zero self-control:- Chicken & Waffle: the chicken was delicious - extremely juicy and flavorful and the chicken liver butter that came with it was sooo yummy- Helga's Meatballs: these were mediocre but the mashed potatoes that came with them were quite good (especially with the fried onions on the top!)- Mac & Greens: mac was good, greens was unnecessary (tiny arugula salad)- Corn Bread: really good - loved the honey butter and tomato jam!Overall, the food and table service was pretty good.

I shared the FRIED BIRD ROYALE for two its a whole fried chicken, mac and cheese, greens, and waffles with liver butter. The chicken was way too salty. The mac and cheese didn't have a crust and after a few bites I decided it didn't taste good enough to warrant the calories. The liver butter was really good and waffles are hard to get wrong. This did not make up for 80 % of the ROYALE being terrible. On a positive note dessert was amazing we got the RED ROOSTER DONUTS. Little pillows of heaven are the best description. They are benya style donuts served with sweet potato cream and cinnamon sugar, truly finger licking good. My friends who got mix drinks where also happy.

It was all well composed and interesting. I would, however, skip dessert as while good they weren't as interesting as the main courses.Service was acceptable, though it took 15+ mins for our first drink to arrive. The appetizer courses actually beat it even though we ordered them significantly later. Which is a good mark for the kitchen staff and a bad mark for the bar staff.It ended up being ~$75 each after tip & tax for one drink and two courses, which was acceptable.

Walking in, we couldn't stop taking in the decor- a colorful mix of eclectic pieces creating a homey yet hip atmosphere. Marcus and his staff was nice and friendly and they were so kind to my auntie who owned the original red rooster decades ago.  Table cornbread was plentiful and hot, however not really to my taste. I've never had cornbread with the  kernels and chili flakes(?). To start, I had the chicken wings and they were finger lickin good! Just the right amount of spice. My brother had the chicken & waffles- definitely a winner. My sis had the sangria and it strangely tasted like vodka. I also tasted the gazpacho which had such a vinegar taste to it I'm glad I didn't order it. We all shared the mac n' greens which was quite disappointing. I personally don't care for soupy ziti noodle mac, but this menu is certainly a far cry from the comfort food of chitlins & biscuits of yesteryear.  Dessert was an assortment of cookies, pickled peach cobbler (tasty), chocolate & coconut truffles, and carrot cake with chocolate ganache and salted caramel icing. After everything we had coffee and they poured champagne-the coffee is beyond delicious! Good and strong-a great way to end our visit. That being said, with the prices I wonder if there are many regulars, but I'm sure it's a hit with the tourists. 2 stars for food and one for showing my auntie a great time :)",3,1,0,Ashley G.,"Hillsborough, NJ",4,25,84

The cornbread was awesome! I thought the jelly complimented it well and it was sweet/spicy.The mac and greens was a very interesting dish with vegetarian collards. They say ""eat your veggies"" and this is one way to do so! In my mind this dish tasted very similar to ""spinach and artichoke"" dip.

Taking advantage of the frenzied bbq preparations on the 4th of July, my mom and I stopped by Red Rooster for brunch, and just as expected, it was fairly empty. I've heard that there's often a wait so I was lucky to be immediately seated.The decor was hip yet welcoming, and during our wait my mom and I busied ourselves looking at the cute diagrams and recipes on the walls. I loved the view of the kitchen; I appreciate that level of transparency in a restaurant, it's comforting. As far as the food goes, I was quite pleased. The cornbread starter was moist and the accompanying tomato jam was a great addition. I ordered the grilled jerk pork with eggs while my mom had the chicken & waffles. The pork was great, but being Jamaican I was somewhat disappointed that the jerk flavor was almost nonexistent. It came with an apple slaw and potatoes, both of which were good, but not mind-blowing. However, I did fall in love with my mom's chicken & waffle dish. The chicken was perfect, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The pork gravy that it came with was the clincher, though. The combination of flavors was awesome and if I ever go back for brunch I know exactly what I'm having. Service was on point, and it probably helped that the restaurant was fairly empty at the moment. I'd love to go back to check out the dinner scene as there wasn't really anything else on the brunch menu that caught my eye.

5.0,7/23/2015,"Red Rooster is a perfect example of why I've made the best choice for myself in 2015: to become a serious, hardcore foodie. Because THIS is what it's all about. My honey and I came here for Restaurant Week (Summer 2015) and ordered from the Prix Fixe menu. Wait...I'll stop right there. Let me talk about the ambience first. As you walk up to the establishment they have outdoor seating which is splayed out in a beautiful, classy manner. We arrived there early (before they opened) and we were treated with two glasses of water as we waited outside for them to open. As soon as you walk in there's a beautiful horseshoe bar with beautiful art and pictures displayed on every wall. The place was smaller and cozier than I had assumed it would be (which I am totally okay with and actually appreciated). Though, we did see stairs that may or may not have lead to another dining or showroom area. Regardless of that, the size of the place was great. My baby ordered the Watermelon & Heirloom Tomato salad to start off, followed by Blackened Catfish followed by their Red Rooster Donuts. As for me I started off with their Charred Tomato Gazpacho that literally blew my mind and got me legitimately angry as to why I do not incorporate any gazpacho at all in my life. I followed that up with their Helga's Meatballs with the donuts hot on its trail. We were beyond satisfied and impressed with EVERYTHING we had. Marc Samuelsson should be proud of this restaurant. And I'm pretty sure he is. The staff, by the way, was absolutely lovely and were accommodating to the fullest. Within half an hour of the restaurant being open there were a ton of people already packing the place. So even though you might plan to one day get there early a reservation is definitely recommended. And if you're going there in the evening for dinner then calling ahead of time and reserving a table is a must. All in all it was a FANTASTIC place which we're going to make sure to visit again very soon.",1,1,1,Em P.,"Brooklyn, NY",36,68,157

The bar and dining rooms are very cool. The corn bread was delicious, not sure what flavors are in there but they are yummy! I was a little disappointed that the food didn't come out piping hot. The eggs were hot, but the sausage and potatoes were just barely hotter than luke warm.

1.0,7/17/2015,"I honestly don't know how this place thinks that they are offering a premier dining experience. We walked in and we were greeted by the hostess who informs us that our party of 4 won't be seated because the other 2 people with us are parking the car. Me being from Houston, I thought this was completely ridiculous! Hello lady.... It's not like you have a parking lot in the back. Did you see the parking situation outside? Finally we were seated at ""the cocktail tables"" in the bar area and when we inquired about the happy hour they told us we had to be seated at the bar to take advantage of happy hour prices. Hello! We are in the bar area, less than 2 feet away from the bar!So I got creative and decided to go to the bar and order drinks to take advantage of the happy hour prices. The host quickly approaches me and tells me I can't do this because I'm receiving service at the table. She calls her manager for back up who tries to uphold this ridiculous policy and I politely informed her that the bar tender knew I was not sitting at the bar and charged me HH prices and that's what I was paying. Long story short this establishment is the equivalent of an AppleBees in Houston , and they treated you like you walked into a 5 star establishment and didn't deserve to be there.....Not!

Red Rooster's decor also bears mentioning: it walks the fine line between classic and unique, homey and classy. In this way it was one of the most memorable dining experiences I've had in the city. For dinner my partner and I had the cornbread (very tasty), the meatballs, and the shrimp and grits. We also enjoyed a pitcher the Rooster sangria but will probably just opt for a bottle of wine next time as the pitcher was a bit heavy on the ice.

4.0,7/14/2015,"I kept hearing about this place and finally got around to going.  We were a group of six and had early dinner reservations (6 pm).  I loved the look and decor.  This place could be a casual dinner with friends, a fancy dinner with a group, a couples date, a quick stop at the bar.,etc. We started off with drinks.  I'd heard about the Obamatini and recommended we tried it- Ouch..., super spicy. 3 people that ordered it ended up sending it back. I actually enjoyed it.  They were nice enough not to charge us for the returned drinks.  We also ordered the Sangria which was pretty good.  Then we moved on to appetizers.  We had the Wild Chicken wings, the shrimp with dirty rice, the cornbread, and the chicken and waffles.  Everything was pretty good.   Cornbread was delicious.  If I had to pick only one appi- it probably would be the chicken wings though.  They were really good.  So moving on to dinner, we ordered the Mac and Greens with Lobster, the BBQ Pork Chops, the Yard Bird, and the Three Pepper Steak.  Everything was really good.  Really nice flavor.  The collard greens on the BBQ Pork Chops were delicious- they were soaked in the sauce so it really gave them a great flavor.  I wished there were less collard greens on the Mac and Greens. While I do like them, I was tired of eating them by the end of the meal.  We also ordered dessert.  We had the doughnuts and Chocolate almond tart. They were good, but not great. Overall is was a great experience.  Now I could say I tried it.  We don't live nearby so I'm not sure I will make the hike again, but definitely recommend.",0,0,0,Lady W.,"Hillside, NJ",0,13,0

3.0,7/5/2015,"I will start off saying the food is good. The service could have been WAY better for how hyped the resturant is. After waiting 20 minutes for our drinks (which happen to be 5 minutes before our food actually came out) I was looking around for our waiter (who was no where to be found) and another man helped us (his name was Richard). Richard went straight to the bar and got us our drinks, no wait at all. After the first round of drinks we ordered a second, my boyfriend's drink was not what he ordered at all. Richard over heard us talking to the waiter about it and came by and stepped in and personally made the drink for us (which was way better than the first time). He did a waaaay better job than our waiter did! He even wrapped our food up. He deserves a promotion if you ask me! I think with out Richard I would be raisin this place 2 stars. BUT on another note. This place is extremely hyped up. Price are extreme. Food is good (mac and cheese and greens are mind blowing ). The drinks are expensive and small with not much liquor in them. Did I mention everything is hella expensive ?! Service is eh okay (Richard helped make it okay rather than eh). It is also wicked crowded.. always! Over hyped. We came on a Friday. Ooooh, and we sat at a table for 6 with two other random couples (really awkward and not delightful). Expected a lot more from this place.

Unfortunately the catfish fell short and was a bit flavorless over a bed of watery cow peas. Our coconut grilled chicken was pink and undercooked, which was promptly replaced by the manager on duty.

Main courses included: shrimp n grits (creamy grits, shrimp and bacony stuff that I can't describe but made it great). Wild bird fried chicken that tasted amazingly fresh like there's a barnyard in the kitchen and served with mash n collard greens. Lastly we had a pork dish in a coffee infused bbq sauce with pork cracklings on top- good on its own but frankly I was so full that I really paid it no attention.

Not only will I not be going back, I think your hostess, Sherri or Cherie should be fired. Since when does a hostess grab the bill with the customers cash?

The watermelon heirloom tomato salad sounded interesting and I tried it, but was just OK for me. If the watermelon was chilled, it would've probably tasted better.

2.0,5/31/2015,"This place was nothing to write home about.  It has decent, though not excellent, food, and is somewhat expensive.  The whole place loses points for environmental and service problems.First, the food.  Our party of four ordered 1 Yard Bird, 1 Chicken with Waffle, 1 grilled fish, and the Triple Double Burger.  The chicken dishes were tasty, as was the fish.  Not the best we've ever had, but not disappointing.  The burger was terrible.  I wanted to sneak into the kitchen with a thermometer and check their freezer, because the meat tasted foul and borderline spoiled.  The french fries were excellent.  The bottled beer was tepid.So based on the food itself, it would have been a three point five star experience.  It was pricey, and not spectacular, but it was good enough.  However, the environment and service was pretty bad.We were there on a Saturday in the early afternoon, and there were quite a few open tables.  It was very hot and humid outside, and they leave the front doors open.  The inside of the restaurant was boiling hot and sticky, and they don't seem to run the air conditioning.  There's a large standing fan blowing into one corner of the dining area, but all it's doing is pushing the damp air about.  So we were physically uncomfortable.  But the real problem was with the server.He was an accommodating chap who I'll call ""Frank.""  Frank was 10 pounds of personality in a 5 pound bag.  He danced, he sung, he called us ""family"", ""sister"", and ""brother.""  He touched us, shook hands with us, he did everything but efficiently take and deliver our orders.  I don't want to shake hands with someone who's busy handling dirty dishes when I'm about to eat something with my hands.  I also don't require entertainment from the server.  I prefer quiet professionalism, not someone practicing his shtick for the tourists.  By the time the meal was over we just wanted to be out of there so that we didn't have to sit through another performance of Frank the struggling actor while we contemplated dessert.So while Frank was a massive irritation and a failure as a waiter, there was another waitress there who seemed like the type we'd have preferred.  Alas, it was not to be - we were seated in Frank's section.Would we return?  No.  It wasn't good enough to warrant a return trip.  The food was decent but expensive, and the atmosphere and service were just plain bad.  Go to the famous eatery one block away for an overall better meal.",1,0,0,John T.,"Kenilworth, NJ",0,21,0

2.0,5/24/2015,"Simply stated: overpriced and overrated. Had the blackened catfish: not hot and mediocre at best. The grits were actually tasty, but they only put about three forkfuls on the plate (honestly), so I wound up ordering a side of grits. The side portion was good, though I'm not convinced $8 worthy, but they were lukewarm.  My girlfriend ordered the cornbread, and I probably liked that better than my entire meal.The service was dreadful. I've debated on actually posting the waiter's name to forewarn folks but I settled on keeping it to myself. So...the waiter: He never, not once, ever came to the table to check on us during our dinner. The only way I managed to get him for my grits was through another employee that was preparing a table next to us. When our waiter came to the table, he didn't say anything...just sort of gave me the ""what do you want and make it quick"" look. At the end of the night, he just dropped off the dessert menu. He did the same with the check when he was ready for us to get out. I don't know. Maybe I'm just being particular...sensitive even, but it just felt like we were interrupting him from waiting on us, though that's the job. Lastly, the bathrooms were FILTHY. Overflowing trash can, hair in the sink, almost empty (CVS brand) soap, I had to go in the cabinet to get paper towels after I washed my hands, and one toilet roll was empty. Never again.

2.0,5/19/2015,"Another lovely dinner ruined by awful service. I live in the neighborhood and so very much want to support Red Rooster, but I've been three times in the past year and have left feeling underwhelmed each time. Last night was the deal breaker for me. I took some friends who were visiting from out of town and really wanted to try this place. The hostess was very sweet and friendly, but our waiter was so rude and arrogant, it was almost uncomfortable. He didn't greet us at all, just filled up our water and said ""You know what you want?"" Uhm, excuse me? Are you the waiter or just a strange gentleman wandering through the restaurant talking to customers? I asked if there were any specials (which there had been the previously times I came) and he answered, ""No, just what's on the menu."" After asking for a few more minutes, he returned and again rudely asked, ""Ready?"" Thanks for being so welcoming!We ordered the beef tartar to share, as well as the yard bird and the chicken and waffles. The tartar was great, but not really tartar. Most of the meat was cooked, and sort of tasted like chili-- very flavorful, but a bit misleading. The chicken on both entrees was cooked perfectly. The meal wasn't amazing, but was tasty enough to come back if I wasn't so disappointed in the service.I should also mention that the other staff in the restaurant-- the hostess, the bus boys and the guys who filled our water and wiped our table-- were very friendly and accommodating. They asked us how we were, delivered our order and drinks, asked us how the food was-- all of which I realize is a lot to ask from one server alone (sarcasm). At one point, after our server disappeared, I got up and went to the hostess stand to ask her a question. Our server immediately appeared then and hovered right behind me, clearly upset that I had usurped his fictitious power. Clearly he wasn't too busy to watch his tables, he just had zero interest in doing his job and providing an enjoyable dining experience.I might come back for drinks in the bar, but I'm calling it quits on dining at Red Rooster. It's such a bummer to take out of town guests, who are totally enamored with all things NYC, to a restaurant that ends up being such a disappointment, especially when there are so many great, affordable and welcoming restaurants in the city. Customer service should not be an unreasonable expectation: it's an insult when a restaurant thinks it can get away with promoting a celebrity chef and celebrity prices, but not provide the most basic components of the dining experience. My advice to anyone venturing up to Harlem: skip the glitz and glam of Red Rooster, and head up the block to Sylvia's.

The decor was like a cross between soul food, diner, and ritzy Harlem. Let's start with the cornbread... dear god... the cornbread... order it immediately and slather it in that honey butter. And then get more honey butter. We also had the deviled eggs. They were definitely good and much better than your average deviled egg, but not the standout of the meal. We split the El Jefe first. If you aren't having lamb for brunch, you're doing it wrong. It was an elegant twist on a scramble. The lamb was perfectly tender and was so amazing with the egg and potatoes on top. Give it a chance! The real star of the day though was the french toast. If you order nothing else, order the french toast. First of all, it's HUGE. Like... picture 3 bricks of french toast, perfectly crispy on the outside and perfectly cakey on the inside. But most importantly... nutella and whipped cream. Ugh.

2.0,4/30/2015,"This place is overhyped. We had played with the idea of going here ever since it opened, but it was always booked up. Finally, a few weeks back we made a reservation far enough in advance.The decor inside I would describe as tacky. The chairs are upholstered with jeans, complete with butt pocket still on them. The prized dish, the fried chicken, they call 'yardbird.' If you ask for the fried chicken, they will remind you that it's called 'yardbird.' This would all be fine, except the food isn't that good.In our group, two had the chicken (yardbird), two had the pork chop, and two had salads. I can't comment on the salads, as I did not try those. The pork chops, which the waiter recommended, were not very popular with anyone who tried them. They were too sweet, and there was not much else memorable about them. The yardbird was pretty good, but not worth traveling for. I will say that the cornbread was moist and fantastic.We had a few pitchers of the sangria, which was the first I'd ever tasted with no alcohol. We're talking 5-6 glasses of it each and none of us could be sure it wasn't just fruit juice. We later found out it cost 64 bucks a pitcher.All in all it was a let down. We bought into the hype and ended up paying $600 before tip, or a hundred dollars a head, for food that felt like it deserved about a third of that.Oh well.Also, a thought after dining there.

4.0,4/27/2015,"I feel like Red Rooster is one of those restaurants with a mental diagnosis, in a good way.  Like possibly schizophrenia.   There's just so much going on...There is definitely something for everyone here.  The place is located down the block from Sylvia's in Harlem the brain child of Chef/Restaurateur Marcus Samuelsson venue.  His menu boasts of home-cooked favorites from Stockholm (like... Swedish meatballs) and Harlem (traditional.....mac and cheese, fried chicken, oxtail stew).  You definitely get a warm and cozy feeling when you enter and dine here. A plenteous ""gospel"" brunch is served on Sundays---but be aware, there are no reservations for Sunday brunch---it's first come first serve.  This will pose some difficulty for parties of 2 or more, especially since at about 12 pmish, the wait can go for as long as 2 hours.  Not sure how you all may feel about that.  At any rate, should you want some music and libations, Red Rooster has an after-hours nightclub down stairs.  This place is definitely a one stop shop kinda venue.  While I prefer to migrate to other locations in Harlem, for some added adventure, it is nice to know in the back of my mind that I can always come here for brunch, dinner, and libations.....",3,0,1,Luarnie B.,"San Francisco, CA",755,143,46

Our friends had the chicken and biscuits as well as the bacon which they raved about!For my main dish I had the lobster mac and cheese, it was really amazing with a good amount of lobster making it worth the extra $9. My hubby had the meatballs with mashed potatoes which he raved about. Our friend had the yard bird which I sampled and  it was def one of the best fried chickens I've ever had.  This was my first time in Harlem, this restaurant was definitely worth the trip.",0,0,1,Clara H.,"South Orange, NJ",102,298,89

However, the Fried Yardbird was terribly overcooked.  There was so much trapped grease that it was almost inedible.  It came sitting on top of some bland mashed potatoes and very vinegary collard greens.  The lobster mac'n'greens was too salty, the texture of the cheese was gritty and it was just not good.  The grits itself had a weird texture like no other grits I've ever had...ugh what an expensive disappointment...never going back again.",5,1,1,Christina D.,"Jersey City, NJ",212,264,973

Well, due to what I do, I often travel up to Harlem, and before I work with a small restaurant for the soul food, unfortunately the place closed down, and I started bringing my group to Sylvia's, which I thought long and hard, because of many bad reviews, but I thought I will give it a try, but it was a mistake unfortunately. I walked pass Red Rooster many times, and often saw so many people there on Sunday afternoon, so I decided to bring them a group. Wow, Wow, Wow. Let start with the restaurant, they have upstairs and downstairs, you first walk in, is a bar area, no reservation require, first come first serve, and to the table dining in the back, which I believe reservation is require because they are very busy. Downstairs is the gospel choir on every Sunday, they have 2 shows, 10am and 12:30pm, I think, we went to the 12:30pm show, it was amazing!! Upstairs you order from the menu, the food is better then I expected, downstairs is the buffet, and because is soul food, they are very heavy, so make sure you save your stomach. I will definitely go back, and bring them more business.

When we finally sat down, the music was so loud that we couldn't hear each other at all. We had to wait for our food and eat without speaking to each other. My BFs mom wanted to treat us to dinner, and this was my choice, so I was pretty embarrassed to bring everyone to a restaurant where we couldn't even speak. I got the Yard Bird which tasted exactly like shake and bake from the grocery store. Kennedy's fried chicken is better and 1/5th the price. My boyfriend got mac and cheese which was good, but not 18$ good. His mom got meatballs which were fine, but nothing special- the ones you get from Ikea are just as tasty.

I started off with the Yes, Chef cocktail - minty and refreshing. Then a side of corn bread which lived up to the high expectations set up by other reviews here. The portion is generous, so it might make sense to share. The blackened catfish arrived when I had barely started eating the corn bread, so the timing was a bit off.

I ordered the sangria which was delicious and the Mac and cheese was fantastic. My guy and I shared the cornbread and enjoyed that as well.Now the bad stuff. We saw our server maybe four times throughout our meal. He walked by us about 15 times without checking in on us. He did not give us our food or ever check back to see how we were doing. At least 4 times he walked by my empty glass - eventually we asked another server to tell him that we wanted more drinks. About ten minutes into the meal two workers got in a very heated argument right by our table. It lasted for a few minutes and was very uncomfortable to witness.My guy ordered the yardbird. He was looking forward to this all day. Unfortunately, it was dry and just...chicken. Nothing extraordinary at all, especially not for $27. Our entrees came out unbelievably quick - too quick. The whole experience felt rushed. We were so excited to order the doughnuts but they were a sad bunch - heavy and kind of tasteless. The inside filling oozed all over and not in an appealing way. I ate one and would have sadly preferred a fast-food doughnut hole over these any day. The whole time we were there we kept trying to see the positives because we really wanted to like this place, but the bad parts definitely out-weighed the good.Overall this was a big disappointment.

My better half had the rooster punch, which was excellent, and it seemed that everyone in the restaurant was drinking it.The black kale salad was very good, but was a little light on the advertised bottarga. Fried yardbird was incredible. Succulent, not greasy. The collared greens were delicious, and great potatoes.Helga's meatballs were really really good. The cabbage and lingonberry was an excellent flavor, and again, really good potatoes.Desserts left nothing to be desired, and they even had Calvados on the drink list.The only complaint is that there is something disjointed about the service. A lot of time spent with empty drinks wondering where the refills were. Like really long waits. We ordered another round when the food came and the second came while they were clearing the dishes, and we ate slowly to wait for our drinks.If the service was more efficient it would be 5 stars, it is a bit annoying to eat with no drinks and really lessened the experience.

The dining room was bright and lively, and the live jazz music just added to the ambience of the restaurant.We started with the cornbread, which was served with honey butter and tomato jam. It was so light and perfectly, crumbly moist, and adding the honey butter and tomato jam on top of the cornbread just made it that much more delectable.We both ordered the spiced sweet potato and apple French toast with a side of smoked bacon and pork sausage, and when our entrees came out our jaws dropped. And when I had my first bite of the French toast, topped with the cinnamon whip and dipped in the maple syrup, it was a flavor explosion. The crispy sweet potatoes on top added a nice crunch to a wonderfully fluffy French toast. The pork sausage was also a burst of flavor, juicy and with a hint of rosemary. The smoked bacon was succulent and perfect when dipped in the maple syrup.All in all, the trip was definitely worth while. I just can't believe we waited so long to go.

The chicken was perfectly tender (not dry in the least) and smothered in a delicious, creamy peanut sauce. I also had the cornbread - which was great, and accompanied by a nice tomato jam. The cornbread is served as two large slices that are good for sharing among two to four people depending on how hungry you/your group is feeling. Several people in my group ordered the Mac 'n Greens, which appeared to be a great dish - a very creamy mac 'n cheese with plentiful greens in the dish and served with a colorful side salad (one of the healthiest iterations of mac 'n cheese I've ever seen). Sip - my group ordered a bottle of the Jam Jar Sweet Shiraz. It was a great, sweet red wine and I recommend it.Enjoy - the restaurant is well located, almost on top of the 125th stop for the 2/3 express trains.

I was surprised at how quickly I was able to get a table for 3 people on a Sunday morning based on the restaurant's reputation but we were quickly seated. The restaurant has a great decor with live music band in the corner. The music was chill with an ambiance to match. My wife and I ordered the fried chicken and waffle and Helga's meatballs.  The meatballs were awesome. Really loved the lingonberry sauce. The fried chicken/waffle was great although I actually preferred the red eye gravy with the fried egg that was on the side of the entree. For the fried chicken, I would have preferred if they had given a bone-in piece of chicken rather than a boneless piece. But everything was still well-prepared. Based on this first visit, I'd love to come back for another meal, especially dinner.

Regardless i was happy to see this time around they did offer a dinner option. Service was really pleasant and helpful. Soup was delicious had a moussey-whipped consistency very flavorful and light for something i wouldve thought would be so heavy. Helga meatballs were delicious but the bites i had of my friends Mac & Greens was delicious. The pasta was cooked perfectly and there were 2 dimensions to the cheese - a cheese sauce that was creamy yet light and the melted cheese on top. Awesome.

Place was hoppin!Went on a Friday night during restaurant week, but it seemed like most people there were more regulars and were ordering off of the regular menu. It was packed at the bar and hard to get noticed, but service was always friendly and warm.I tried a bunch of things, all delicious but here are my standouts:1. Obamatini - get this drink! It's spicy, fruity, tangy, and it creeps up on you. Plus it's fun to order an obamatini, amirite?2. Cornbread - if you like cornbread, you have to try this. So fresh and it comes with a tomato jam that is really out of the world. I've never had cornbread w tomato ""sauce"" flavors and now I will crave it.3. Fried chicken - just get it. It's crispy and delicious, end of story.The blackened catfish, gravlax, and sweet potato donuts were on the restaurant week menu and all were good but I wouldn't order the donuts again. They're just not my thing and somewhat unimaginative compared to other dessert offerings. I do recommend the catfish tho, that was fresh and yummy.Downstairs is Ginny's supper club and looks like a cool, dim and hip place to grab a drink.

3.0,3/6/2015,"At long last, my friends and I had a chance to try the near legendary Red Rooster! We went for dinner on a snowy evening and indulged in some serious comfort food. And given that there was no Marcus Samuelsson sighting, we needed some comfort. We shared everything so we could all experience the goodness--devilled eggs, cornbread, yardbird chicken, mac 'n cheese and the pork shoulder. All were delicious and could have probably given us a heart attack right there, but it was worth the splurge. Both the devilled eggs and the mac n' cheese were stunningly creamy, rich and delicious. And while I'm not a fried chicken connoisseur, if you're gonna do it, this is a solid choice to splurge on (but maybe not the very best ever), although with a breast and a drumstick in a serving, sharing among 3 of us was less practical than we thought. Live and learn. The one thing that was truly disappointing was the service. Once we declined our very dapper waiter's suggestion of ""SHOTS??!"" the first time he came over, he seemed to lose interest in us. The busboys and runners were more attentive and enthusiastic than he was. He didn't check on us to see how the food was or how our drinks were, explain what the sauces were accompanying the yardbird, and, even when our drinks were drained, I had to do that eye contact/chin thing to flag him down while he was just standing around to get a 2nd round of beverages. The only time he showed any level of enthusiasm for us again was when he came by asking if we wanted dessert and pitched ""SHOTS????!"" again. Puzzling.",1,0,0,Carrie W.,"New York, NY",0,24,0

You almost feel like your eating in a big family dining room. Enjoyed the music while eating as well. The food was amazing! The fried yardbird was the best thing I ate. The accompanying sauce literally brings you back home as if your mom cooked for you and I enjoyed that. We also had the Mac and Greens, CornBread, and Tristen's dish (had to try this to support Tristen) shoutout to the Taste! Oh and the warm doughnuts rounded out the meal! Supported Harlem with some Sugar Hill Beer to accompany the meal. I'm already planning my next trip to try Helga's Meatballs!

Upon arrival, the hostesses and bartenders were exceptionally accommodating  with checking our coats and serving drinks while we waited for our table. But when we sat down to our table, that's when the service  disappeared. Our server took more than 10 minutes to approach our table and ask us for a drink order. Then we waited another 10 minutes to get our drinks. We weren't in a hurry, so we didn't focus too much on the long wait. But when we finally had her attention, she simply asked if we were ready to order,  without any explanation of the menu or suggestions. She was just an order taker - a huge pet peeve of mine - that's not service.  We ordered deviled eggs , cornbread, peanut chicken, and the burger. The cornbread was delicious, but all the rest was far below  expectations. We didn't eat the peanut chicken at all after the first bite, and we just had a couple of bites of the burger. Our server never returned to check on us after we got our food to make sure we liked everything or ask if we needed anything else. We just asked for the check and decided to give up. On the bright side - upon leaving,  the manager asked how everything was, and my husband said ""It was okay.""  She could tell we were unhappy and insisted we share our experience with her. We explained, and she insisted we  let her make it up to us, offered to refund our $, and offered to have us back again. She made a great effort to turn us around. We didn't take her up on a refund. We ate some of the food and we enjoyed the drinks. And we told her we live so far away, that we probably just wouldn't be back. But she gave us her business card and asked us to reach out personally if we want to return. She did all she could, except walk around and check on tables during the dining experience.

I've been wanting to come here ever since I moved and I'm so glad I did.The interior captures the heart and soul of the area you are eating in -- Harlem -- and the music only added to the atmosphere.  I came with 5 of my girlfriends (one who is gluten-free) and we decided to skip drinks and go straight for the food. The entire staff was so friendly and accommodating and our waiter made sure to check on every item of food that was brought out for my gluten-free friend (even going as far as to bring her a complimentary bowl of pickled vegetables so she didn't feel left out when we had our appetizer...which brings me to the cornbread. I mean you simply can't do it any better. It came with delicious honey butter and tomato jam and it disappeared almost the moment it hit the table.  Great way to start.  We all wanted to try everything so our waiter decided we just do it family style.  Warning about this.  Only do it this way if you don't mind sharing and picking at things with your friends.  It's not conducive to sharing with associates or acquaintances (i.e. kinda hard to share a piece of fried chicken unless you don't mind picking off the same bone as your neighbor) but for our purposes it was perfect and I got to taste a little of everything. We ordered to shrimp & rice, mac & cheese greens, seafood spaghetti, yardbird, and sides of brussel sprouts and Parmesan fries.  Sides: good but fairly standard. wouldn't say I would come here simply for the sidesMac & Cheese: delicious take on a classic. comes with an arugula salad and the creamy, thick cheese is mixed in with greens that gives it a nice twist.Shrimp & Rice: definitely a favorite of the table (although I'm not much of a seafood person so I can't personally comment on both this and the seafood pasta)Seafood Spaghetti: comes with a lot of different seafood mix-ins (again, seafood isn't my favorite in general) but the pasta was cooked and seasoned perfectly and my friends seemed to really enjoy itYardbird: crisped and fried to perfection with a delicious side of mashed potatoes and collard greens. reminded me exactly of all the authentic southern cookin I grew up withOf course the moment I saw that cinnamon-sugar doughnuts were part of the dessert menu it wasn't a question of if but how many I would order.  We got the doughnuts, the sundae bar, and the smores to finish off our wonderful meal and could not recommend one over the other -- they were all so mouth-watering.

I'm not going to make a big fuss with the Bloody Mary simply because this isn't the St. Regis but I will however make a big fuss over my catfish sandwich. So you're schlepping to harlem for some good modern soul food cookin and what should you expect? I expect my catfish not to be soggy that's for one. Two, I didn't expect a 2/3 ratio of breading and old bay vs fish. I could not find the taste of catfish. I could have been served fried breadcrumb sandwich for all I know because I cannot recall a fish in there. Lastly, it was bland.

(Keep your coat on though, because they can't keep the cold wind out of the bar.....)Maybe this place was once inventive but now its been watered down to mayonnaise soul food and you'll quickly notice there are not many locals around, except at the bar.You will quickly see this place is all about tourists and luckily for management, they are oblivious. That means you'll have a hard time getting a table and the front desk, while sweet, is also clueless about finding you one. Luckily for you, they just might be doing you a favor and leaving you a soul survivor.The Yardbird is OK, the catfish is OK too, though hardly inventive. The chicken salad is a mess with ugly chunks of meat. The signature meatball dish - five bland balls on a bed of sauerkraut with a lingonberry type dip for $21 is a bit of a joke. Any grandmother anywhere could knock the socks off this - and do it for free.The one dish that received a divided review was the Mac 'n Chesse.

There were live singers, and they were singing all the jams from the late 90s and early 2000s. I thought to myself this was going to be the hit of my night. However when the Menu came, I kept flipping it over, begging for something great to present it's self. I found nothing that screamed soul food. So I decided to get the Mac and greens, just so I can say I ate something here, and it was a way I would not have to spend a lot on something I knew I might not like.The over priced mac and greens would have been nice if it cost 9 dollars. My friend had fried chicken that we believed to be fried in cornmeal ( she said is was the worst friend chicken ever) . By the look of the plates around us, nothing resembled soul food.

4.0,2/10/2015,"The Red Rooster was the first ""fancy"" restaurant I ate at after relocating to New York.Really great Americana cuisine is what's on the menu. You can tell that the Red Rooster is a trend-setter. Marcus Samuelsson, the executive chef, was asked to cater President Obama's first state dinner, and it's evident that his cooking style has set trends on a very large scale. Before I moved down from Toronto, Canada, I was amazed at the prevalence of gourmet BBQ and American comfort food that was popping up across the city. Gourmet mac and cheese, and catfish and grits seem to be very en vogue everywhere, and that's exactly what we got at Red Rooster - probably where that trend gained traction.What the Red Rooster does better than almost any restaurant is this:1) Incredible, warm, genuinely friendly staff. This was pretty much the best service I've had in any restaurant.2) Cocktails. The cocktails were inventive and delicious. I particularly enjoyed the Earl of Harlem.3) Atmosphere. With gospel brunches, live jazz, and eclectic décor, the Rooster is inventive and exciting without feeling clichéd.And yes, the food is very, very good.

2.0,2/7/2015,"My companion and I came to red rooster on a Saturday night and the place was popping. We were seated towards the back on the restaurant, very cramped into the walkway and another table. No biggie since it was so crowded right? I looked around after we ordered and the restaurant was half full. We didn't have to be cramped into that little nook. Per the waiters suggestions, we got the blackened catfish and fried yard bird. The yardbird came with a leg and thigh and they looked crunchy and delicious. My companion tried cutting into the catfish but the meat wouldn't separate. It was like cutting into a steak! We both tried it and it was cold and rubbery. It was undercooked. For a $27 dish, we were not going to keep the cold fish and decided to send it back. We never send things back to the kitchen in fear of getting spit or snot on the new entree.  We ordered the burger as the replacement meal and the burger was nothing to write home about. Average burger. The yardbird came with collard greens and mashed potatoes and again, nothing speculator. When I was about half way through the thigh, I noticed pink on some of the meat and tossed it aside. When I got neared the bone, it was all red and the meat around it was pink to red. I complained to the waiter about it who took it back to the chef and said it was the blood from the bone and it wasn't undercooked. I know my chicken and when it's undercooked and that piece of thigh was undercooked. Marcus Samuelson, I don't think you would accept undercook chicken when you judge on the spoon.

5.0,2/6/2015,"We went here today for my birthday lunch and were so impressed by how awesome the food was and how pleasant and accommodating all of the staff were. The hostess immediately checked out coats when we walked in, and when we told her it was my birthday she upgraded our table from the shared table with other guests to one of the larger tables for two. Our meal started with comped glasses of champagne (which isn't normally my favorite, but whatever they serve was very tasty). Our order was taken promptly, and the hostess had told our waitress that it was my birthday.We ordered the cornbread to start, and it was super dense and moist and awesome, and the tomato jam that comes with it was great too. I got the Yard Bird, and my mom got the Mac and Greens. We split a side of roasted Brussels sprouts and a pitcher of the Yes Chef cocktail. Everything was excellent - the chicken was some of the best fried chicken I've ever had, and the gravy and hot sauce it came with made it even better. The collard greens and mashed potatoes it came with were also excellent. My mom's Mac and greens was super cheesy and delicious, and she really enjoyed the arugula salad that it came with, although I didn't try it. The Brussels sprouts also rocked, but we definitely ordered too much food. The waitstaff brought out a special birthday dessert for both of us, again on the house. It was their signature dessert, small donuts on top of sweet potato cream. These were awesome, too. Everyone who worked there was friendly and helpful, and definitely worked hard to make my birthday lunch special. We definitely want to come back for Gospel Brunch or on a night with live music. Definitely don't miss this place.",1,1,0,Richelle P.,"Saint Louis, MO",25,68,7
4.0,2/5/2015,"First and foremost, do yourself a favor and secure a reservation before you trek up to Harlem. Otherwise, you'll be waiting [at the rather nice] bar for a decent amount of time.  Unfortunately, this happened to me. Luckily, my friend and I found two spots at the bar. The drinks are expensive, but they're tasty. I had the Obamatini [$13], yes, that's really what it's called. I loved it, the black pepper flakes made it spicy, but it was also slightly sweet as it's made with vodka, pineapple and grapefruit. Perfect combination. What you really should know:Red Rooster falls somewhere between a restaurant and a club, or at least a lounge. The front of the restaurant, otherwise known as the 'bar/waiting area,' is extremely LOUD. The DJ booth is situated right next to the standing tables reserved for walk-ins. I, literally, felt every beat of music surge through my body. I had to scream in order to talk to my dining companion. It definitely detracted from the excellent food we had. Food: Wild Wild Wings [$11]: We saw these pass under our nose a few times, people order food at the bar with abandon. I loved the inventive spin on hot wings. The pickled vegetables are amazing and the sauce on the wings are delectable. It's less hot and more tangy. The first bite, however, did taste like bile right after you throw up [sorry]. Corn Bread [$4]: There were two pieces of corn bread, they were both rather large. You definitely want to use the butter, otherwise the corn bread can be a little dry. The butter is sweet which complements the bread very well. You can leave the tomato jam on the side, it tasted like stewed tomatoes and just didn't work. Mac & Greens [$18]: De-lic-ious. This dish was a cheese explosion, every mouthful was a cheese party. The rigatoni are large and serves as a vessel for the molten goodness. There were pieces of bacon, I kid you not. There was a salad on the side to cut the heaviness, which it is, of the mac and cheese. Good call. Dessert:Doughnuts [$12]: The doughnuts may have been the highlight of the meal. They are served warm and dusted with sugar. The inside is made with a sweet potato filling which keeps this dessert from being a step away from a cavity. Service was fair, it was quick at the beginning and slowly declined as the restaurant filled up.The bill was very reasonable at about $80 for two people with a decent amount of food. I was sufficiently stuffed.  I would come back in a heartbeat.",10,1,1,Felisa F.,"Brooklyn, NY",52,198,192
2.0,2/4/2015,"First, I a HUGE fan of Marcus Samuelsson. I couldn't wait to try this restaurant! The ambiance and the look of the restaurants is interesting, I am hoping that since we were on the bar side that is the reason why it was so noisy. They have the option to sit at the bar or the high tables (looks like a high picnic table with stools) so be ready to sit close to strangers! It was absolutely FREEZING in the restaurant; it almost felt like the heat bill didn't get paid. I had numerous drinks and still felt cold. Please put the heat on. As far as the service, our waitress was nice no complaints there, we were sitting at one of the ""picnic"" tables  for quite some time now and kept on ordering drinks. So it's not as if we were just taking up 2 seats, when we were told by I guess maybe the hostess/manager that  these seats are for people having dinner or we have to move to the bar( but yet the bar is full so what are you saying? ). Why did they seat us there then, its ok when there is no one in the restaurant but when it gets busy you move your customers although they are not ready to leave?  I actually thought that was rude, I would not expect that from this restaurant.   Lucky for her, we were just about to order food so we told her that's what we were just about to do. She leaves and as we are waiting for our food now, she comes back and asks us to move at the end of the table so she can sit a people...UNACCEPTABLE , at that point, I really felt like just leaving! I was really turned off. If it wasn't for the good company, it would have really put a damper on my night. The food was ok, I had the Fisherman Spaghetti, I actually was expecting more flavor and taste. The person with me had the fried chicken, which I couldn't wait to taste..and I was so surprised that it lacked seasoning. The fried skin is really what somewhat saved the chicken, the meat itself lacked salt. Overall, I must say I am disappointed about my experience here, not sure that I would go back, If I ever have to, it will not be on the bar side for sure!",2,1,1,Ms. L.,"Mount Vernon, NY",0,4,0
5.0,2/3/2015,"This place is seriously good. I'm not sure how they only have a 3.5 rating. My friend and I got the corn bread as soon as we got there because we were ravenous. The honey butter and tomato jam were both so delicious. If that butter came in a jar, I would probably eat spoonfuls of it. We were looking at the appetizer choices when the amazing angel woman next to us recommended the Caribbean Bacon, which we honestly glanced over and did not think much of. That Caribbean Bacon made the night and meal. The sweet angel was right. It's unbelievably good, and the bean tomato sauce has a pleasant kick to it. If you decide to pass on the plate, you are doing yourself a great disservice.For our main entrees we ordered the yardbird, and blackened catfish with grits. Both were delicious. The yardbird chicken was so crispy and fried to perfection It was accompanied with this amazing gravy, cooked to perfection collard greens, and smooth and creamy mashed potatoes. The skin had so much flavor in it, and you could see all the different spices being utilized. The blackened catfish with grits was a standout too. The grits were so creamy and the chutney relish on the fish tied the plate together while giving you a pleasantly sweet surprise. Lastly, we ordered the brownie sundae for two, which of course was amazing, but arguably a little too sweet. I think the peanut brittle pushed the sweetness a little over the edge, and trust me, I love my sweets.The atmosphere is great for any occasion, and the servers were friendly, professional, and very knowledgeable. You could argue the food is a little over priced, but the food definitely makes up for the price. MUST TRY and very much worth the trip!",0,0,0,Linda S.,"New York, NY",219,109,26

I am such a fan of Chef Marcus Samuelson and was so excited to eat at his restaurant but my expectations were far from met.  I came here for brunch with two friends.  ALL the way from the west village I trekked to try out this place.  We started out with the cornbread and grits which were SO YUM and YUM!!! If you come here def order these two items.  For drinks we had a bloody mary which was not that great, and a mimosa for $12.. really?  For our main meals we had the migas, omelette and catfish sandwich. An Omelette for $14 dollars that doesn't even come with hash browns and just tastes plain?  I should have stuck with the cheap diner in midtown.  The catfish sandwich was SO SOGGY and did not taste good at all my friend barely ate half of it.  The migas were not bad although the hashbrowns were overwhelming with strong cumin flavor.  Needless to say I will not be back any time soon.  I give 5 stars for the cornbread and cheesy grits, but one-two stars for the rest of the meal.",3,0,0,Lauren A.,"New York, NY",237,239,442

I don't understand the reputation- not at all what I was expecting.Service was poor. Hosts were sweet but the server made us wait at least 5 minutes for an offer to get a drink. Ordered a salad at the same time as ordering a drink. The salad came before the drink! The salad came maybe 1 minute after ordering it and the drink maybe 4 minutes after that. And there was a fried egg on the salad- how was it all so fast? The salad was fine. Cornbread croutons though a nice touch are better in theory than in practice. My dirty martini was somehow sweet.Then we ordered the fried yardbird, mac and greens, and the meatballs. And I swear it was all on the table less than 5 minutes after ordering it. THIS IS NOT A PLUS! How on earth can they be making things fresh? Is it a reheat operation they've got going on? So strange! The chicken was delightfully crispy.

Ordered the rooster doughnuts for desert and had to send it back. They forgot the filling. It was corrected immediately and was a nice treat to wrap up the evening. I would have given a four star, but the simple errors kinda let me down with the cornbread and oversight with the doughnuts.

1.0,1/5/2015,"I was so excited have lunch here, as I'm a huge fan of Chef Marcus Samuelson, but things did not turn out the way I expected. We arrived and a very nice hostess let us know that the wait would be about 30 minutes. We went the day after New Years, so it was a bit busy with tourists and locals home from work. We were able to find a seat at the bar so we decided to eat there instead of wait for a table. Big mistake. We sat down and on the counter was a used napkin and two glasses. There was one bartender and she seemed busy so we waited patiently. After about 10 minutes we asked the couple next to us if we could take a look at their menu. The whole time I tried to make eye contact with the bartender to let her know we were there, but no dice. It took the bartender 15 minutes to come by and and clear off the glasses and napkin. We did not get a greeting. She did not wipe down the counter but just asked us what we wanted. We were starving so we gave her our food order and she turned away to help another customer. She never came back to ask us what we wanted to drink and after another 10 minutes I flagged her down to get a couple of waters and sodas. About 10 minutes after that, she came by and double checked our order with us. I thought it was odd, but thought that she might just be making sure she got it right. Looking around the bar, I could see lots of people needing attention and looking a bit irate. Although the bartender was not sitting around doing nothing, she certainly wasn't hustling as much as she could be. Went to the restroom while waiting and there was no toilet paper and trash all over the floor. Additionally, I did not see any managers in the restaurant during lunch. We saw one gentleman in a grey suit that came into the bar area - saw the complete mess and walked out like nothing was wrong. Didn't see him again or I would have flagged him down to complain. From the time we sat down to the time we got our appetizers (deviled eggs and a salad) was around 45 minutes. So when the bartender was ""checking up on us"" was probably when she placed the order.  A couple who was seated at a table behind us had already finished their lunch by the time we got our first course. After finishing our apps, it was another 20-25 minutes before we got our main dishes. My lobster mac and cheese was great - my husband ordered the catfish sandwich and they brought out blackened fish instead. Took another 15-20 minutes just to get his fried catfish to him. While I was eating, my husband noticed that the bartender was picking up placemats off the floor of the bar and placing them on the counter for customers to eat off of. It was definitely gross and we were happy that at least she didn't try and give us a dirty placemat. Finally he got his food (same time I asked for the check because I knew it would take awhile) and we were able to leave soon after. The restaurant gets one star - and that star is for the food. The food was good but the experience was terrible. The name of the bartender on the receipt was Jhwanda - she definitely should be not be working there.",5,1,0,Natalie B.,"Manhattan, NY",4,4,0

You actually can have a reservation here and be seated when you made it for. Shocker, right? It's one of those things that I have learnt about this city. Reservations just mean you are on the list.

My boyfriend and I went to celebrate our anniversary and he happened to mention this to the host when they were seating us. From the moment we sat down everyone who worked at red rooster made us feel at home and special (especially our incredible waitress stacy)!!!!They treated us to champagne to begin and after we enjoyed the chicken and waffles (a must order), the Mac and cheese, the cornbread and the broccolini - it was time for dessert. Stacy brought us lattes (again on the house) and then when we asked her opinion on desert, she ended up bringing out both deserts we asked about. Not to mention - one had ""happy anniversary"" written in chocolate fudge on it.  We've never had a dining experience like the one we had tonight at red rooster.

By doing this we ordered things we never thought we would enjoy, but honestly this is one of the best meals we have had in a while. We ordered the Carribean Bacon, Kitbo, Fried Chicken, and shrimp and grits. For dessert we got the smore bar and since it was my birthday they gave me  some of their signature donuts.

The restaurant highlights elevanted American comfort food with ingredients sourced from local farmers.To kick off the evening, we started with an array of appetizers. I also got a rum punch that was served family style for the table. I don't recall what was in it, but it was tasty. The cornbread was incredible, served with honey butter and tomato jam. The Chicken & Waffle was served with chicken liver butter and bourbon maple syrup. The Black Kale Salad was served with a fried egg, black garlic dressing and bottarga (salted, cured fish roe). The Deviled Eggs are served with chicken skin mayonnaise. My favorites were the cornbread and Deviled Eggs. The Chicken & Waffle was ok and the Black Kale Salad was interesting - unique flavors for sure! For my entree, I got the Mac & Greens, made with NY Cheddar, Parmesan and Collard Greens. Other people at my table got the Shrimp & Grits, Shrimp & Papaya, Fried Yardbird and Roasted Salmon. I loved the Mac & Greens - so delicious!!

All 2014 visits.In summer this place was hopping, the drinks were great, food excellent and an amazing vibe even though it was as loud as other reviewer Samanta C comments. (I am agreeing with her on many points after my third visit.)They were serving homemade pickles this summer and I was dreaming about them when I visited again in November. On the downside they weren't serving the pickles (off the menu for winter) but on the upside it wasn't over 100 degrees inside the restaurant. Also, we were within walking distance to The Apollo Theater which made this a great choice for a pre-show dinner. I've had the shrimp and grits three times now. It always perfectly prepared with a lot of complexity in the ""sauce"". The portions are shrinking, though. And did the price go up too? Hmmm...I'd probably go there and order it again anyway. It's a great preparation. (It's better than my recipe and I'm a little sad about this fact.)My son had the Lobster Mac N Cheese. Also expensive and tiny. But, hey- it's Lobster and he loved it. Then we both ordered $12 desserts. I ordered Pineapple Upside Down Cake. After seeing so many other things delivered in cast iron I was I expecting to get a warm gooey cake served in its own tiny little pan. Sadly, I received two corn sticks, sort of warm, and some ice cream. My son ordered the cheesecake. The portion was also small and the presentation looks like it was really designed for sharing. Get an appetizer and skip dessert. So the portions were small and prices high. Welcome to NYC.  But, the place has everything else going for it. The mixed drinks, which I'd had on other occasions, are always inventive. The club downstairs is such a unique way to end dinner and everyone is friendly and having a great time. Yes, I've tried the fried chicken. It is worth the raves. When you call to make a reservation the people are so helpful on the phone. I even left my credit card there once by accident and the staff were wonderful about getting it back to me. I will be back and I probably won't be able to wait until they are making pickles again.

I would hope that on a less busy evening they might show a bit more personality. The servers moving around seemed to be more friendly and welcomed us and invited us to tour the restaurant as we took it all in. The overall atmosphere of Red Rooster won me over from the start. Although slightly cramped in spots due to the crowd, the place has a great energy and a great setup. I appreciate how the dining room is fairly separate from the bar area due to the shelving holding liquor. The bar held a DJ on this evening which was nice and not overbearing. He played good music at a reasonable volume for dinner/early evening. I actually didn't even notice him right away. I was told that on some evenings, live bands play, which I'm sure would be amazing. We ended up ordering food after a few cocktails and everything was delicious. We had a kale salad, hearth roasted brussels sprouts, and the shrimp and grits.

They said it would only be ok but he couldn't order when he got there.I was a little confused with that. I ordered my meal, and he came in just as the appetizers came out. He asked if he could order an entree, no, the kitchen was closed for people dining where we were, even though it was steadily sending food out to the people eating at the bar and outside.He had to sit there sipping water.

5.0,10/21/2014,"Our Sunday brunch at Red Rooster was by far the most memorable, best meal of our trip to NY... but before that happened, I'll back up and give a bit of history:We had the honor of meeting Chef Marcus Samuelsson once before... It was summer 2011 and he was in Arizona doing a cooking demo and dinner at The Sanctuary.  He made such an impression with both my husband and I, that we had ""a meal at Red Rooster"" on our bucket list ever since.  I'm happy to say we can cross it off, but at the same time, I do hope we will be able to return and do it again during future visits to NYC.So now back to our meal:From the moment we entered RR, we saw happy people and felt amazing energy all around... both from the staff and from other guests.The service from the hostesses, bartenders, servers and runners was all stellar.  Every person we interacted with was incredibly friendly and attentive.  Thank you Marisa (who happened to wait on us that day) and staff.The live music was fabulous.  The woman singing on the main level literally walked around the dining room and brought so much joy to everyone, it was remarkable!  She was awesome (as were the musicians in the band).  I didn't see first hand, but my husband walked downstairs to see live gospel music as well.  I guess there is not a bad seat in the house!I don't believe you can go wrong with anything on the menu...I had the Migas and loved it, Jared had the Yard Bird (fried chicken) and said it was the best he's ever had, and we had a side (which was huge by the way) of chicken apple sausage.  That sausage is not to be missed... I'm not even a huge sausage person, but I loved it!  We ended up trading some of our sausage to the table next to us and got some cornbread in return.  It was also delicious!   Jared's dish came with some collards, which I ended up eating, and I loved those too.We were full from all of the above, but since it was our last meal of the trip, we figured we should end with a bang (and something sweet), so we ordered not one, but two desserts: the cheesecake and the butter cake.  Both were good!  It's worth noting that RR does not serve alcohol on Sundays until noon.  (I'm assuming that is the law).  So if you're a bloody mary or mimosa type, plan accordingly.  Even without alcohol, you cannot go wrong with Sunday brunch at RR.  Do it.  You will not regret it!  Five fabulous stars!",11,5,5,Gabi M.,"Phoenix, AZ",3699,1987,3334
3.0,10/21/2014,"3.5 stars .... Review For lunch onlyAt the heart of Harlem, Red Rooster offers new America Dishes with some soulful twist. Offering you dishes such as mac and cheese lobster, chicken and waffles, pulled pork, fried fish, fried chicken sandwiches. I love the decor of the place. Elegant but not pretentious. They have a pretty well stocked bar, but when here for lunch so I can't comment on their drinks. I had the chicken chopped salad (too much dressing in my opinion but the hostess told me she would have switched it and made it right if I had told her, which was very nice), I also had here the salmon, and their friend doughnuts. The salmon was cooked to perfection and the doughnuts was not overly sweet.  Now the dishes did not impressed me very much, but I did like the attentiveness of the hostess, the welcoming atmosphere. I think I would consider coming back for dinner.",0,1,0,Cathy M.,"Manhattan, NY",107,57,97

First few times a had great service, my friends visiting from overseas enjoyed the bar, and restaurant however the last time I was there the service was terrible. We were seated at the front of the restaurant near the bar, it took 15 minutes for someone to take our drink order, 3 glasses of Syrah. 15 minutes later still no wine. Cue waitress, and a reminder. 3 glasses of lightly rose colored wine appeared. I asked the waitress are you sure this is syrah, its very light. Waitress responds I believe so. Definitely not syrah however the waitress was not accommodating to my inquiry. Another server approaches, I enquire about the wine, she checks with the bar tender - sure enough the wine is a rose. Staff can't tell the difference between rose and a syrah?I've raved about this restaurant to friends and recommended it to everyone when they came to town for my wedding.

As we got seated I still was surprised to see the menu, didn't expect southern comfort but it was interesting. We all shared the cornbread (very sweet) and delicious deviled eggs. I had the shrimp and grits which was excellent, two of us had the salmon and they loved it but two friends had the mole chicken and unfortunately they didn't like it. There was a mishap with one order so we got a dessert on the house: peach pie, which was yummy. We truly liked the service and staff, the food is good if you like southern food, but then there is the music. WAY too loud. We were feeling like we were eating in a nightclub.

We had to wait about 45 minutes for a table, which was fine, as it was Sunday we expected a wait. We had cocktails at the bar and were able to listen to the lovely gospel singer that was performing. She was just so precious:).We had Brunch and were able to try and share 4 dishes.The Shrimp and grits were amazing, especially the texture of the grits were just perfect, the French Toast was good. I loved the sausage that came with the scramble and the cheesecakes was a yummie guilty please after already splurging.Our server was friendly, efficient and engaging throughout the whole brunch experience. The hostess that put my name down was kind but honest about the wait. I appreciated that.I have to say i was somewhat hesitant to come back and bring friends following my last experience, but I am so glad that I did. It just goes to show that despite he unfortunate past experience they were able to redeem themselves in my eyes, by providing a laid back Sunday brunch experience, with just the right amount of everything.

3.0,10/11/2014,"This is my second time dining at Red Rooster.  The quality of the food in preparation, presentation, and flavor was outstanding at the initial experience in July 2012.  The presentation of the food remains excellent, however, the quality in taste has lessened.  I expect a restaurant in NYC owned by a celebrity-chef to stand out in some way from other establishments. The history of its name and decor of the building are wonderful, but the actual product needs improvement. Flavor from taste enhancers (salt, sugar, spices, etc) should not conceal the core ingredient of a dish.  I tried the apple delight after brunch, but could not detect apple in the dish.  History can make an establishment unique, but given the price of the menu cannot sustain a business. The staff is extremely polite and courteous, which is wonderful.  I am supportive of the owner-chef and wish to see the restaurant do very well.",0,0,0,Antoine T.,"Atlanta, GA",2,42,2

4.0,10/3/2014,"I have a good time every time I go to Red Rooster. I've been going off and on since they opened 4 years ago. I usually take someone that's visiting Harlem for the first time and we have a blast listening to the live music, meeting new people at the community tables, dancing downstairs before it became Ginny's and even meeting Marcus in person. The food is pretty amazing with great influences from many countries. Never had a meal here that I didn't like. And the atmosphere is A+.Unfortunately, though, sometimes the music is blaring and I have to move to outside seating to enjoy myself. Another con is that some of the items are pricey - $30 for a small bowl of Shrimp and Grits (4 peices of shrimp) - is something a friend ordered and shared. I have to say it was possibly the creamiest bowl of grits I've tasted in my life, but $30 is more than price gauging in my opinion. I would say this is one of those dishes that possibly only tourist consider buying. Being that I can make this at home for $5 makes this price laughable.",14,12,12,Latasha M.,"Manhattan, NY",67,12,57
5.0,9/30/2014,"Yes, Yes, Yes!!!I've intended to go to Red Rooster since it opened. It's all of 3 subway stops away. Just never worked out... until tonight, when my wife and daughters took me to celebrate my __th birthday.Was it worth the wait? Yes, with a Capital ""Y-E-S""!First - the decor. You walk in and just get a feeling that this is ""home."" The bar is beautiful. The crowd (6:30 on a Tuesday evening in September) was lively. The background music was just right. The dining area with the open kitchen... tight, but just enough room to keep things cozy and comfortable.Next - the service. The hostess/manager was extremely accommodating. She sat us with only 75% of our party there!  That doesn't happen in New York City. Our waitress: she can teach a master class in hospitality.  Marcus, if you're reading this, please give her a raise and have her talk to all the rest of your staff (I believe her name was - and I'll mess up the spelling was ""Finalia"" - I know that's a mess, and I apologize.) Her recommendations were all 100%, from my cocktail to dessert.  And she just had a charming personality, chatting with my kids (13 & 8), and just making us feel right at home.  The manager came over a few times to check in on us as well.  You just don't see that on a regular basis. THANK YOU to the entire staff (including the poor fellow who was on his hands and knees wiping up a spilled glass of water, so we wouldn't slip!)The food. Totally as expected.We started with the Deviled Eggs.  Okay, actually, we started with the complementary corn bread, with the freshest and sweetest butter ever. (It was like ""butta!"")  On to the eggs. Creamy and delicious.Main courses:I had the blackened catfish - over succotash and jalapeño creamed corn.  Fish could have been a bit larger portion, but the overall flavor was perfect.My wife had Helga's meatballs.  I want to meet Helga. Man, those were delicious!  Might be worth a trip to Sweden!My 13 year old had the house special: the Fried Yardbird.  Crispy on the outside, moist on the inside. Delicious sides of mashed potatoes (must have had a full stick of butter in this portion!), and greens. Wow.My 8 year old went with the Shrimp and Papaya Salad appetizer.  This was the one flaw in our meal.  Shrimp was delicious, but the papaya salad had a bit of a ""kick."" Wish we were told about that - as she wouldn't have ordered it. Of course, we had enough food between the remaining 3 of us that she certainly didn't go home hungry!Finally dessert.  Options galore. We were choosing between the  ""Peaches and Cream"" (Peach Cobbler with Buttermilk Ice Cream and Blackberry Sauce, ""Black Bottom Peanut Pie"" or the ""S'More Bar"" (devil's food cake,graham crackers and toasted marshmallow Ice Cream"".  Our waitress said Peaches & Cream was her favorite.  Who were we to disagree?  Wow and Yumm.  And of course (because we REALLY needed them), she also brought over a basket of fresh baked donuts with a sweet potato filling!)About half-way through our meal, a terrific Salsa band started playing up front.  That just added to the festive atmosphere.To Marcus Samuelson and Andrew Chapman: sorry it took us so long to make it to Red Rooster.  Trust me: it won't take me 3 years to return (after all... we haven't tried Brunch yet!)Thanks to the entire staff for making this a very memorable birthday.

A mix of old school R & B played in the background. We waited at the bar until our table was ready. The French Martini I ordered was PERFECT! The bartender shared that it was his favorite too, which is probably why he made it so well.  Fortunately, we only waited about 15 minutes for a table. To our surprise, the two of us had to share a table with four others, two parents and their teenage children.I enjoyed the food, although the vegetables were a tad bit salty for my taste. The macaroni and cheese mixed with collard greens were tasty. The steak was too small, but good. All in all, my favorite dish were the wings. They had a kick of spice and were flavorful. We had to request for ""wings only"" because the original dish was ""wings and oysters"".....yuk.Would definitely visit again to try other dishes, and have some wings and a French Martini.",0,0,1,Brooklyn H.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,34,53

The waiter then old us that only half the menu was still available which limited our choices. I ordered a burger which comes with jalapeño cheese and bacon. I asked that it not be on bread and to have salad instead of fries. When the burger arrived, it was on bread but the waiter (who was not the one who took the order) promptly took it back and replaced it. The bacon and cheese were excellent and the burger cooked as ordered but I'll take the burgers at Burger Bistro and The OxCart in Brooklyn over the ones at Red Rooster because there they are a big bigger and juicier. The salad looked nice but was small. I also saw the Watermelon tomato salad that my friend talked about having had last time.

I found the Yardbird to be bland and uninspired. I'm sure that better fried chicken can be found around the corner on 125th for 1/4th the price.

I ordered a white sangria (was missing the fruit) and my friend a Ketel One and ginger ale. We waited and chatted. Everyone at the bar appeared to be enjoying themselves. The service could have been a tad quicker. We attempted to check out Ginny's Supper Club downstairs but that area was packed as well.  There was a live band playing which  we want to go back and see play. The table was ready around 9:30 PM. It was a bit of a wait which we found a little annoying. But Red Rooster quickly made up for it. Once we were seated the first thing we noticed was the warmth in the restaurant. It wasn't particularly hot outside. However with so many patrons it was definitely warmer than it should have been.  We were asked to place our orders rather quickly. Luckily we had both scouted out the menu before hand and knew exactly what we wanted!  We both ordered: -the Yardbird (crispy fried chicken with a side of mashed potatoes, and greens)- a cornbread to share- the grilled Mexican sweet corn-complimentary deviled eggs (on the house because of the wait)Everything was delicious and hot when it came out. We were both impressed at how quickly the food arrived to the table which was great because we were both starving once we arrived. We ordered another round of drinks and a manager came to check on us which was very thoughtful. The only drawbacks were the size of the tables (very small and felt a little cramped sitting so close to other patrons), the wait (which was made up for with the free appetizer), and the temperature in the restaurant. That definitely needs to be worked on.I look forward to my next Red Rooster experience!",3,2,1,Cortney W.,"Brooklyn, NY",652,433,1393

I got the blackened catfish. Oh my goodness, it was so delicious. The fish was excellent but the creamed corn bed was outstanding. Never tasted anything like it. Everyone else was pleased as well.

1.0,9/2/2014,"WALLET THEFT IS A COTTAGE INDUSTRY At RED ROOSTERAfter 21 years of living in New York, I had MY WALLET STOLEN for the first time ever at Red Rooster.  I was at the bar and someone lifted my wallet from my purse.  Management did everything in their power TO PREVENT ME FROM CALLING THE COPS to report the theft - I have renters insurance and needed a police report to file with my claim.  Management said, ""No, no, no, let us call the cops, they will be here in a moment.""  The leaned on me HEAVILY to prevent me from calling.  I waited and hour for the cops who never showed and while I was waiting a bartender had her phone stolen at the bus stop after finishing her shift.I finally walked to the precinct and reported the theft.  The cops to me that purse and wallet theft is RAMPANT at Red Rooster.  They told me that pick pocketing crews target Red Roosters customers and that the local precinct receives at least one complaint per day, and that many other complaints go unreported.Management actively tries to prevent victims from reporting the crimes.  They don't want to be known as a place where customers are targeted and robbed regularly, but that is what this place is.  After all kinds of promises from management to review tape (there are security cameras everywhere) and follow up with me I never received any communication from them.  I would have at least liked for them to say that security reviewed tapes and passed info along to detective, but they didn't.  As long as Red Rooster can keep the flow of tourists coming through the doors the theft victims are just collateral damage for whom they have no care or concern.I would say don't go, obviously.  If you do go, don't be surprised if you because parted from your wallet.",4,3,0,Collen M.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,35,2

I have to come back to try other things!We ordered the corn bread and the shrimp ceviche for appetizers. The cornbread was made perfectly sweet and soft. It came with this read sauce that complimented it well. The shrimp ceviche came with plantain chips and this dish was perfect! For my main meal I had the catfish which was perfectly seasoned and cooked. Melted in my mouth. I will definitely recommend it. For drinks we ordered a pitcher of Red Rooster sangrias.

3.0,8/30/2014,"I am so NOT impressed by Red Rooster. I had been trying to go there with my girlfriend and when we finally managed to get a reservation, our experience was below our expectations. First of all, i don't see the point in making a reservation when you get there exactly on time and still have to wait 25 minutes to be seated. We were a party of three and after that annoying wait we got seated in the back section right next to the kitchen doors. Not to mention the table was a picnic table that we obviously shared with people we didn't know and one of us had to sit on the edge of the table, in the hallway that led to the kitchen. The hostess came shortly afterwards with three glasses of champagne and apologized for the wait. We were not feeling comfortable in that place at all and when i asked our server if he could move us to another table, he did absolutely great and accommodated us to a much better table. I can say that he is the one who saved the day. But another server took care of us from there and she was okay. There aren't a lot of options on the menu. The food was good but not impressive at all, and way too pricey for that matter. I have had more delicious salmon filets in other places in Harlem for much less. Honestly, Red Rooster is overrated, to me. The decor is nice and all, but it is not all that. I am not going back there and quite frankly, i would not recommend it. I would give it 2.5 stars if i could.",0,0,0,Abdul S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0

3.0,8/25/2014,"Came here on a Sunday with a friend and no reservation, but it was 5:30, so we were seated in the bar area with communal tables almost immediately. Nice ambience. We sat next to each other and made friends with the nice older lady sitting across from us who was visiting on business from Chicago. We weren't super hungry, so we shared cornbread, deviled eggs, watermelon salad and meatballs. We also got the donuts for dessert.As someone else mentioned in their review, our starters (or ""snacks"", as the menu calls them) hit the table before our drinks did. I really hate that. I've worked in food service. That's totally avoidable. And we ordered beers, not fancy cocktails that take forever. Cornbread was good. The seasoned butter was delicious, but it's butter, so it's always delicious.The deviled eggs were quite good. Get them.I thought the watermelon salad was meh, but my friend loved it. It had watermelon, heirloom tomatoes, mint, cilantro and aged feta. The mint and cilantro combined really nicely, but I wanted more acid to cut all the sweet. I liked the meatballs, but I think Lean Cuisine Swedish meatballs are delicious, so I probably shouldn't be trusted to be discerning when it comes to Swedish meatballs. My friend thought they were meh. My friend loved the donuts, which had a warm sweet potato filling. I didn't really like them. I'm not a big fan of foods that pop in my mouth. Take that as you will. Overall, I'm glad I went and I'm used to spending on good food in NYC, but $85 for what was effectively one person's meal (2 beers, 2 snacks, a salad, an entrée and a dessert) should have included at least one thing that really wowed me.",1,0,1,Brandy E.,"South Bend, IN",0,14,1
3.0,8/24/2014,"LOVED the ambiance soon as I stepped through the doors. Service, and more importantly food drops it down to 3 stars. I would rather come to the bar to enjoy the live music and a good cocktail than eat a full meal.When the bf and I walked up to the hostess (Sunday, 1:30pm, sans res), she quoted a 20-minute wait for a 2-top (even though she said 30-min to the guy in front of us...). 30 minutes later, she comes to apologize for the table taking an ""unusually longer time to finish"". 40 minutes later we finally get sat. The waitress brusquely asks bottled or tap and then 5 minutes later the busboy comes to ask the same question. We got our starter and entrees before our cocktails even made it to the table. She never came back until we asked for the check. Service was not unpleasant, just a bit spotty and not the friendliest. BUT I just loved the atmosphere. Jazz music playing and memorabilia cluttered on ubiquitous shelves. A lively soul singer started warbling ""I can't give you anything but love"" and as I sipped and listened there was nowhere I'd rather be. We enjoyed 2 lovely cocktails: harlem shake (starr african rum, coconut milk, pineapple, mint, lime) and strivers rowers (raspberries, sage, peach, honey, bourbon, prosecco). The different jugs of infused bulleit bourbon on my right was a nice touch and I liked the shape of the bar. It just felt different from every other rustic-y restaurant I tend to go for and reminded me of New Orleans. Food-wise it was a big letdown. The cornbread was not very moist and didn't really taste out of the ordinary. Jack's Chedbred is still solidly my favorite purveyor. The triple-double burger looked VERY promising at approximately 6 inches tall but the flavor just wasn't there. My helga's meatballs were just okay as well. Love that Marcus's Swedish influence is present especially with those delicious lingonberries, but I liked everything about the dish except for the actual meatballs.

Our waiter came by and asked if we would like cornbread (not a free item by the way!) as we browsed the cocktails menu and sure, why not, right? Boy, those were some good cornbread with butter and tomato jam. I got the lenox lighting slush drink (vodka and melon that day $10) and the boy got gin and tonic ($12). They are pricey, but strong. For appetizers, we got the grandpa's gravlax and mexican street corn. The corn was not worth it - $8 for a single cob. You can get a better deal of the corn (with chili powder) at cafe habana on prince street. Just saying... However, the gravlax was amazing. The apple pieces paired so well with the salmon and mashed avocado and peas. For entrees, we got the famous yardbird and catfish. The catfish, in my opinion, was better. The skin on the chicken was hard and the meat was more on the dry side. The catfish was flaky and tender like a perfect cooked fish should be. The succotash and creamed corn underneath the fish was so tasty! We were full at the end of it all, but we ordered dessert anyway - peaches and cream. I'm still thinking about the dessert.

I ordered it well done and it came out cooked perfectly! There was a little kick to it, but it wasn't what I would consider spicy. It was seasoned perfectly and probably one of the best salmon dishes I've had. The red rooster donuts were out of this world! I've never had a lighter, fluffier bite of heaven than this. They were little round spheres covered in cinnamon laying on sweet potato filling and there was this heavenly homemade whip cream on the side. Omygosh please order this when you visit!!!

5.0,8/13/2014,"One of my favorite classes I completed in grad school was a class called ""Strategic Innovations"", which I actually took this past May and June. One of my textbooks, ""The Medici Effect"" by Frans Johansson, profiled many people, namely Marcus Samuelsson. in the chapter titled ""Sea Urchin Lollipops and Darwin's Finches"", the author discusses Samuelsson's unexpected placement and rise within the kitchen of Aquavit back in the mid-1990s. He was successfully able to break down associative barriers when it came to the culinary arts and create exciting dishes. He melded what he learned from traveling the world and could combine traditional Swedish and Scandinavian cuisine with ingredients and flavors associated with other countries, such as India or Japan. This man was a master then, and a trip to Red Rooster proves that he still has that magic touch.I was not aware that Samuelsson was the founder of Red Rooster until just recently, though I've known about Red Rooster itself for quite a few years. I literally exclaimed, ""Hey! I learned about him in school!"" when I made the connection. (Ha!) Luckily, this restaurant is a participant of NYC Restaurant Week, so I was able to snag a 1:30 p.m. reservation on a Wednesday. (Lucky me, I was off of work on a week long ""staycation"".)  We arrived...and it was PACKED. I was not expecting that for a weekday lunch, but lo and behold, even with a 1:30 reservation, it was still another ten until we were seated. Eh. No matter.The menu pickings for Restaurant Week were a little small, but those few choices were still hard to pick from! The beau ordered the chilled spiced tomato soup, and I opted for the salad with grilled peaches. Both were satisfying; the avocados coupled with the crunchy bread bits on the soup were a delight, and my salad's lemon dressing was bright. As for the entrees, he ordered the Mac & Greens, and I opted for Helga's Meatballs. Finally, I was seeing some of that Swedish influence in that Southern food. Those meatballs were some of the best I've ever had, served on a bed of sautéed cabbage and carrots in a delicious butter sauce. The lingonberries were a perfect accompaniment to the meatballs, a tart cranberry-esque flavor countering the richness of the meat. The mashed potatoes with fresh chives and sautéed shallots were as good as mashed potatoes could get, a shining example. The beau's Mac & Greens had one of the best cheese sauces I've ever had, and the addition of collard greens to the mix was a really enjoyable flavor combination. I know some people can take or leave them, but I really felt this worked well; it's certainly more flavorful than just adding spinach or broccoli. Finally, the meal was ended with freshly fried sweet potato doughnuts served atop a sweet potato cream with a dollop of vanilla-flavored whipped cream on the side. By that point, I was about to ask our waitress, Kimberley (excellent waitress, by the way), where the beds were, because we both needed to take food coma naps immediately. Backtracking a bit, we also indulged in their famous cornbread with honey butter and each had a glass of the Rooster Punch. By the end, we were more food than human. Simply put, I had one of the best and most satisfying meals I've had in ages. I had a great appreciation for Marcus Samuelsson after learning about him in my class, but now my appreciation goes even deeper after trying what he's crafted. This place is worth the hype (normally high non-Restaurant Week prices be damned!), because you'll get some extremely innovative and delicious meals. Hats off to you, Mr. Samuelsson!",3,0,2,Allison C.,"New York, NY",215,1638,450

5.0,8/12/2014,"MY FAVORITE PLACE IN NY.I've dined here about a dozen times over the last three years and I cannot think of a better restaurant in terms of food, ambiance, and service.  Although you can get reservations via Open Table, I recommend grabbing a seat at/near the bar.  The vibe in the front is amazing every night of the week, since there is usually a musician or DJ of some sort.  While that might seem disruptive if you're trying to have a more intimate meal, it really only adds to the experience!Since Red Rooster is my ""go-to"" on Friday nights, I suggest getting there around 8pm, enjoy a cocktail (or few), eat dinner, and listen to the live musicians at the front.  Then, around 11pm, head downstairs for an unpretentious night of dancing...and even more drinking.  The music is UNREAL.  All of the best hip/hop, R&B, and old school 90s you could ever ask for!  I would also highly recommend going to Gospel Sunday Brunch on any Sunday throughout the year.  Gospel/jazz musicians are again in the front, so if you didn't get a reservation, just pull up to the bar.  Same menu, but better vibe than the traditional seating area.Although the drinks and food here are priced a little high, it is 100% worth it!  Definitely get the cornbread and the fried green tomatoes!",1,0,0,Roshni N.,"San Francisco, CA",17,20,0
4.0,8/12/2014,"Nice change of pace for me and the wife from our usual Midtown/Dowtown ventures. Solid cooking and great flavors seem to abound here. What's funny is that some of the prices on the entrees are rather high, but the really great appetizer of fried oysters and hot wings was a steal at only $11 for 6 wings and 5 oysters. Their special rooster sauce on the wings is a combination of typical wing sauce and jerk sauce- that's what my guess is anyway based on what my tastebuds told me- and is pretty damn good. I was actually quite full from my app and struggled through my fried catfish sandwich, which was also good, but not as good as the appetizer. It was perfectly fried in a cornmeal batter and was served with some slaw on top on a toasted brioche. No dessert- too full..next time. Service was great.",1,0,0,Rich J.,"Yonkers, NY",85,537,159

But on to the food: Appetizer: Tomato Soup with Avocado See now I'm not a fan of tomato soup in general so I personally didn't enjoy it. But for anyone whose a tomato soup lover I'm sure you'll like it because when I tasted it, it wasn't all that bad. Entree: 1. lobster Mac and Greens. Ohhhhhhh my gosh, was that heaven in my mouth. Might have been Slightly over salted but ohhhh my gosh it was deliciouss ! I would go back just for the lobster mac and greens. My sister ordered the:2. Applewood Grilled Salmon This was mouth wateringly (is that even a word... Oh well) delicious. I love everything little thing about it. The green sauce thing (no idea what that was), the beans.. Everything was SO good. And finally.... Drum roll please Dessert: Donuts.Not just ordinary donuts but donuts with a sweet potato filling. Now when I read ""sweet potato filling"" I was a bit skeptical. But HOLY Goodness you guys, it was soooooo good. The best part of the meal id say. The warm donut, the sweet potato filling, the side of homemade whipped cream that was the perfect amount of sweet. God. I'd could live off of that for years. If be morbidly obese, but I would be happy. They have chicken an waffles as another option for the entrees in the restaurant week menu but I don't eat non halal food, but if I did, I would so order that.

3.0,8/8/2014,"My girlfriend and I had lunch here recently.  We split the catfish sandwich and the brisket sandwich.  Both of them were very good.  The brisket sandwich came with some mixed vegetable which I believe were pickled.  They had a very strong taste which neither of us particularly liked.  There is no way I could picture eating the whole dish of those vegetables.  The service was sub par as the menu was not clear about what came with the sandwiches.  We asked the waitress and she read us what it said on the menu.  Since it didn't really say any sides with the sandwiches we just wanted to know if we needed to order separate sides.  It became very clear that she didn't know as she was trying to read it off the menu and then she said that the brisket sandwich came with fries and the catfish sandwich came with pickles instead of finding out for us and telling us what actually came with them.  When they came out the brisket came with pickled or marinated vegetables and the catfish came with chips and a salad, so she was entirely wrong in what she told us.  Anyways, the sandwiches themselves were very good but I felt overpriced.  So, I am glad we went and I would definitely say give it a try, but I am not particularly jumping at the opportunity to go back.",0,0,0,Trevor B.,"White Plains, NY",18,101,33

4.0,8/4/2014,"*Dinner Review*I previously came here to go to Ginny's downstairs.  This time, I came for dinner.  Although I've been curious about trying out the food because of all the buzz (and more so recently since it's now one of my local restaurants within a few blocks from my home), I was a bit *iffy* because the reviews I'd heard from friends were always either:  ""It's great!"" OR ""It's overrated.""  Clearly, I didn't feel compelled, other than my own curiosity.  Came here unplanned on a Saturday night.  As soon as we were looking at the menu, a friendly and sharply dressed host came up to ask to ask us if we had any questions and if we were interested in dining.  We said yes  - the inside tables were packed, so we sat outside on a nice summer night.  The bar area was nicely filled with a mixed crowd.  The service here - unlike most other Harlem establishments - was on-point!  About a minute or so after we sat down, our server came by with menus.  She let us peruse the offerings for a few minutes and came by to take our drink and food orders.  She was nice and had a smile.The drinks were strong and yummy!!!!  The food was delicious.  We had the cornbread as a starter.  It came with softened butter and tomato salsa.  Never thought of salsa with cornbread, but I tried it and I was pleased.  We both ordered the chicken and waffles since neither of us was very hungry.  I love Southern food - and I haven't had chicken and waffles in a while - so I was looking forward to it.The meal included one piece of fried chicken breast - no bone.  It was sufficiently tender - but not juicy.  Would have been happier if it was juicy.  The flavors were good though.  The waffles tasted as if they were freshly made.  It came with maple butter and syrup.  I really liked the meal.  After we paid, the server brought us a tin container than held sachets of chocolate-and-nut tea.  That was a nice, creative, and unique end to a meal - rather than boring mints.  (My friend left his tea on the table - so mad at him b/c I could have taken it.)  I had the tea today and this is clearly gourmet-type fresh tea leaves.  It had an essence and mild chocolate flavor with notes of nuts in it.  Just superb!  The verdict?! - It's great!  Definitely NOT overrated.  I'll gladly return for another meal!",4,0,1,Jenn A.,"New York, NY",73,459,122

4.0,8/1/2014,"3.5 stars.  Bumped them up to 4 because all members of staff inside the restaurant have a sense of style that will shame whatever you happen to be wearing that night.Tip: Family style is the only way in which to enjoy this meal, folks.  For the appetizers, we had the corn bread, lamb tacos, and watermelon heirloom salad.  Each of us had a slice of cornbread, but if I were to do it again, I probably would have opted for half. I'm not such a huge fan of lamb, so I only had a piece, but it was super tender.  The mains, we had the mac n cheese, shrimp n grits, oxtail parpardelle .  The Yard Bird is pretty hard to share, but if you are with good friends, you should just tear into it.  For the drinks, we had a pitcher of Yes Chef--super good, though on the weaker side.I came here with a party of 5 people, one of who was the birthday-girl, so she (obvi) didn't pay--and it came out to about 60 dollars per person.  Pretty reasonable, considering the mountain of food that we ordered.    And for the birthday girl, they gave her three small truffles with a candle stuck in one of them.  That was nice of them!If you live south of 125th street, though Harlem seems like a trek, the restaurant is basically two steps away from the 125th street station, so it's super convenient.",0,1,0,Alison L.,"Atherton, CA",103,615,61

4.0,7/26/2014,"Red Rooster Restaurant...July 2014 - 4 Stars: my first trip to Harlem...and a memorable one to boot. The chef Marcus Samuelsson (Ethiopian born and Swedish raised) has had a fascinating life journey from the old country to the top of the cooking world. His memoir - Yes, Chef - was an interesting tale of a hard-charging and extremely competitive chef. The story begins in Ethiopia where Kassahun Tsegie was born, contracted TB, was orphaned and adopted all before he turned three. From there he was raised as Marcus Samuelsson by his adoptive parents in Sweden, and went on to battle his way through kitchens across Europe and the United States until he rose to the top of the pile, earning a number of awards and high ratings at Aquavit in New York when he was but 24 years old. The Red Rooster is his first independent neighborhood-based adventure and opened in 2010. What was really fun was that this area of Harlem is gentrifying, and places like the Red Rooster are driving the trend. This was a happening place - really part of the New York restaurant scene. The customers came from all walks of life and ethnicities...and that is part of what made it fun. It was a real melting pot of people. If you had reservations about going to Harlem, you might want to rethink that and give this restaurant a try. We thought it totally worth the trip. We arrived on the day of the World Cup finals, and the place was humming. There was a big screen TV outside to keep those waiting for a table occupied...and another in the bar area. If you plan ahead, make reservations and it will save you lots of time. The Red Rooster is mainly a huge room on the first floor, split between a full-service bar area on one side of a divider and the eating area on the other side. The kitchen is sort of semi-open so you can see some of what goes on. There is a small separate dining area in the basement called Ginny's Supper Club - which is a lounge with live music and soul food that was not open when we were there.  The food in the main dining room of the Red Rooster was very nice and just a bit from the usual to make it even more of an adventure. For example, two in our party had Fried Yardbird ... all dark meat that has been brined, fried with a light but crunchy breading, served with white mace gravy, mashed potatoes, and butter pickles. One of us had Helga's Meatballs, these could have been a tad lighter but they had a nice even taste. The last of our party had Shrimp & Grits...very flavorful and it just might have been the pick of our table. All in all the food was very nice, served quickly, and the wait staff was attentive. As an aside, I had read the Chef's book and brought it along just in case he was there...he was and he kindly signed it for me. He was also kind enough to have his picture taken with our group. This place is Marcus Samuelsson...it lives and breathes his presence. He works the crowd a couple of times a day, while his assistants run the kitchen. He is the rain maker and the big draw for the Red Rooster. This place was solid three-star food in a five-star happening place - I give it a four-star rating and would love to return.",7,1,4,Rick B.,"Orland Park, IL",33,806,440

Served with a bourbon maple syrup with a very intense bourbon flavor, and a bitter/meaty chicken liver butter. Loved every bite. The chicken was pretty salty, but the flavor was worth it. My entree was a catfish sandwich which may have been a restaurant week special; I'm not sure. Great soft bread, pickled veggies, lots of flavor, very delicate and flavorful fish. Also pretty salty, which seemed to be somewhat of a theme. Even so, it was delicious. Dessert were doughnuts and green apple sorbet. Crazy good, on both counts.

1.0,7/10/2014,"I've been here twice, when it first opened and again this past Sunday for brunch. I really wanted to like this place but it always disappoints miserably.  First there was a really obnoxious singer, actually using the term singer is a bit generous, as far as I could tell she was squawking off-key at an obscenely high volume into the microphone. It was so loud it was hard to make out what the ""song"" was (or think straight) but it was jingle bells.  I find Christmas songs slightly annoying during Christmas time but downright offensive to be subjected to them in July!!  We almost left but then the squawker announced she was going on a break.  Which was good because besides the infernal racket she was making, she was also panhandling!! I think I've had better experiences from the really talented singers on the subway -whom might I add are a lot less pushy than this disaster of a person. On to the food: Meatballs - I would have assumed a Swede would at least know how to make meatballs.  They were really only so so. Small and dense with no particular flavor.  The only saving grace about this dish were the mashed potatoes which were delicious. Deviled eggs - again nothing specialBloody mary - really the worst bloody mary I've ever had. Cheap vodka and poor quality tomato juice.",11,3,1,Rachel A.,"Manhattan, NY",116,187,363

There's outdoor seating, wonderful eclectic art, responsive and friendly staff, terrific people watching, energetic but laid-back vibe. We were seated promptly at 7, just as a fantastic jazz band started to play. Unexpected bonus!I'm embarrassed to say that the two of us managed to consume the following dishes all by ourselves: cornbread, fried chicken and oysters, deviled eggs, the yardbird and meatball entrees, and some succulent, decadent dessert called black-bottom peanut pie. Everything was yummy except we would rate the meatballs lower on the scale ... more ""meh"" than ""yeah!""We also found good variety and price points in the wine list, and felt we got more than our money's worth overall. The servers were knowledgeable and mostly attentive. We did have to wait a few beats longer than we might want to for refills from our wine bottle and for some dishes to arrive, but, hey, we had plenty of eye candy to take in (on the walls, the view of the bustling kitchen, the beautiful people everywhere) and that wonderful jazz band playing in the background.

4.0,7/7/2014,"I usually spend my Sundays in my old neighborhood of Harlem. Recently met up with a friend for brunch past Sunday afternoon & agreed on Red Rooster since we heard so much about it. *Pro Tip* This is a Harlem restaurant once visited by President Obama during his NYC visits. The only obvious result is long waits and limited availabilities.  Try going off peak and plan ahead. Treat this place like any other NYC tourist spot. ( Katz Deli etc..)Like most, I heard Obama dined here and seen Red Rooster appear in many articles.  I told my friend to meet up at 2pm but I arrived around 1:45 to put our names down for a table. A table for 2 is about 45mins on a Sunday afternoon and the place was packed.  If possible, one of your guests should arrive early and put your name on the list to ease the waiting time.  Fortunately it was a beautiful day so we killed time by chit chatting and walking around in H&M.  Upon returning to the restaurant, we ordered sangria at the bar and enjoyed the live music. Sangrias were typical and nothing special. Also they were $10 each, so not down with those prices.  The band was wonderful and had excellent energy. Everyone at the bar seemed to enjoy the performance as well.  Certainly not overbearing at all so you can still talk to your friends as well. We were seated a little before 2:30pm and immediately knew what we wanted to order.  (Another plus of a long wait, figure out what you want to eat! ) I had the fluffy 3 egg omelette and my friend ordered the Gail's Bloody Mary eggs (Both A OK for vegetarians if that applies) The food arrived in a timely manner and was excellent and well prepared. The food here is hearty so you won't feel like you need anything else after.  The staff was also excellent.  All smiles, constantly apologizing for the wait, accomodating and thoroughly explained the menu.  Keep it up! I rarely see happy servers during brunch! Decor is a bit eclectic with a mix of African & African American art. Nicely done and not too crazy. Also very casual place as it seems to be a Harlem tourist attraction if you can't get into Sylvia's..Overall, Red Rooster is a pretty great restaurant.  Date spot or Happy hour? Certainly not. But if you have a family or friend visiting who loves american, hearty southern food and not afraid of Harlem then take them there.  Would definitely return again and when in doubt just call ahead to avoid any headaches.

Both of us were coming from NJ and LI. She suggested the Red Rooster. Good choice. We got a seat as soon as we came in and wsd attended to immediately.  We both ordered the Red rooster punch - a sangria. It did not disappoint!  Not too sweet and just enough kick to it.

We put our name down to be seated outside, and we were told that we would be seated in a few minutes, but another pair who came after us was seated before us, which peeved me greatly, and the service in general was probably slightly below average throughout the entire meal.However, the food was very good. To drink, I had the Bourbon Negroni, which had a nice fruity flavor as part of a solid drink. We split the beaten biscuits and red eye gravy, which was nice and meaty and went well with the tasty biscuits, as well as the fried yard bird, which had a good crisp to its skin and was tender on the inside.

This may be because of my enthusiasm and anticipation after reading Marcus Samuelson's ""Yes, Chef"" two years ago, but I doubt it. I'd like to think that I would have caught onto his fusion of his own cultural experiences immediately.  We dined during the World Cup and there was soccer paraphinalia everywhere. A jazz band played as the game broadcasted on a tv just above their heads.  I sense everyone felt the same because we struck up a jovial conversation with the table next to us who offered me one of their deviled eggs (super good) after I lamented not ordering them in the first place. The menu caused me to furrow my brow a bit as I decided amongst all the options. We settled on shrimp ceviche, the dirty rice app, lamb tostadas and catfish.

Overall,....ehh.We came to dinner a few nights ago, and something must have been going on in the kitchen. My uncle received his entree 10 minutes before our drinks came. Then the chef sent out two appetizers, 'with his compliments', instead of the appetizers we had ordered. The free appetizer salad looked like the kitchen threw it together. At least the second free app, the shrimp papaya salad, was tasty.20 mins later, I received my order. My mother and another uncle waited for another 30 mins for their food. No one came to clear the table so by the end of the evening I had about 6 plates stacked on top of one another. The manager, however, was great with addressing the problem and the server tried his best with a smile.

On top of this, we ordered a second drink (first was at the bar) right before our appetizer came, and it took oh, about 40 mins for it to arrive. I could have taken the train home, put some drinks in a sippy cup, and been back up to the restaurant in the time it took to get two drinks, which by the way wound up coming after the main course was about 3/4 finished. We would have cancelled it, but our waitress was bogged down with 10 other tables of Swedes and Germans with their kids, out for a nice meal at 10pm......She should have comped our drinks, since we made it crystal clear we weren't happy.

5.0,7/1/2014,"I'm surprised by all the harsh reviews of this place.  In all fairness though, we didn't try the main dining experience.  So I'll add that this just a review for their Sunday Gospel brunch.  I'm a fan!We casually wandered into the Red Rooster around 10:30am this past Sunday.  I had heard fantastic things about the all-you-can-eat gospel brunch they offered.  I wasn't sure what to expect...and I ended up loving it!  The hostess gave us a big smile and informed us that for brunch they could offer us a cozy booth and that we'd have the table until 12:30 - I felt like that two hour block of time was generous and perfect.  I had a suitcase with me since I was heading back up to Boston.  The hostess offered to store my suitcase away while we dined.  I told her I'd put it away myself and to point the way since the suitcase was embarrassingly heavy.  But she sweetly insisted on taking it for me.She then brought us downstairs.  It's dark and dimly-lit.  There's a nice brightly lit up little stage.  The whole place had an old school, wonderfully retro feel to it...instantly whisking you away to another era.We were told the performers would go on in about an hour or so - we had plenty of time to grab our food and get started.  The little nook where they had the buffet set up felt very intimate.  It almost felt like we wandered into someone's house for a nice little brunch.  I immediately spotted deviled eggs - it really was a party!  They had chicken and waffles, bread & butter pickles.  Pasta with greens, buttermilk mashed potato with a delectable (sausage?) gravy.  They had a spring mix that had an amazing, amazing ginger-lemon dressing - I went back twice just for that salad alone.  They had madeleine-shaped cornbread (so fluffy & soft) with a delicious little tomato jam/chutney and honey butter as accompaniments.  They had these fun little Swedish-style meatballs with lingonberries.  Gravlax.  An array of desserts.  All goodness.  All delicious.  The food was anything but a typical brunch fare.  It was eclectic and thoughtfully prepared and yummy.Then the singing started around 11:30.  A beautiful line-up of fresh-faced singers with amazing voices - the youngest singer was 14 and the oldest were in their early twenties.  Would explain the crazy energy you felt when they were belting out their tunes...they were dressed all in white and had big voices that just filled the room with such a positive vibe.  Singing so good you almost don't feel bad that you skipped church that morning!  Singing so good it nourishes your soul!  Someone had a birthday in the crowd - they brought her up and sang her the sweetest rendition of Happy Birthday.  She looked tickled and everyone cheered for her.  The performance was too short for my liking but I suppose they can't go on forever ...The buffet price is a bit steep at $40 for an adult, $20 for my 7 year old.  (And babies are, of course, free.)  But I figure that you're factoring in an invigorating performance into that price.  I would come back here again & again!  And I only found out post-dining here that this restaurant was opened by Chef Marc Samuelsson.  Another bonus!",1,0,0,Terry K.,"North Andover, MA",99,28,0

The menu is small, but definitely interesting. Bottom line, the food was pretty weak. I had lamb tostadas, and if I didn't know it was lamb, I wouldn't have been able to tell you whether it was beef, pork, or lamb - way, way over-seasoned. Entree was more of the same.

It was a piece of spongecake with glazed strawberries with a side of strawberry sherbet. Had I been paying it would have been sent back to the kitchen. The cake was bland and tasted a bit stale.Overall the food was good and the resturant is a pleasant atmosphere. However the wait staff had a terrible disposition and were very unfriendly.

2.0,6/15/2014,"I brought my friend from out of town because she wanted to experience the ""NYC scene"". I usually hangout Uptown and Harlem is definitely poppin'. Red Rooster is very popular spot. I thought the ambiance was nice and my friend was LOVING the ambiance and the ""beautiful"" people  she saw. We were not able to get reservations, which I now know I must call HOURS earlier not two hours before. We sat at the bar because it was too cold outside to eat. I was slightly annoyed with people reaching over me to order and receive drinks. But what annoyed me more was the food. Let's be real, the food is expensive. In my opinion, too expensive for Harlem. If you are going to charge alot of money, the better be spectacular. I ordered the jerk pork chop and my friend ordered the oxtail parradelle(sp?). My pork chop was....pitiful.First off, the cut of the pork chop was poor. It reminded me of the cheap assorted pork chop pack you would get from the supermarket. My chop was not the normal quality chop that I've come to expect from restaurants that usually serve the center cut pork chop with one curve bone at the end with a palm-sized piece of meat free of fat or sinew. That is not what I received, it was full of sinew. Aside from the poor cut of meat, the seasoning was NOT jerked. I have West Indian friends and relatives so I know what jerked anything tastes like. My chop just tasted like they threw some allspice and something else and grilled it. There was absolutely no heat, no carmelization of the brown sugar (because there was none). Then I realized that I paid $29 bucks for this sad chop. So with a poor cut of meat with no real seasoning, I was disappointed. At first I did not really make a stink because my friend was enjoying the place so much. But then one of the bartenders came over and asked me how was it, I think she noticed the look on my face of discontent. I told her frankly that I really wasnt feeling the pork chop. I didnt expect to send it back because I had eaten some of it. But she graciously took back the chop and offered to bring me back another meal of my choosing. I appreciated it and decided to go with the burger. I figured it couldnt be hard to mess up a burger. The burger was OK. Nothing special and probably just a regular hamburger meat. I've had much better burgers at bars for much cheaper prices. I think the other bartender was slightly annoyed with us because we weren't buying a bunch of overpriced drinks. I actually wanted something to drink but when I saw the prices and limited selection for the wines, I opted out. I'm not a super penny-pincher, but I've paid these prices at other locations in NYC and received my money's worth, especially with meat. I paid $29 bucks at STK Midtown for a steak but OMG was that steak good and worth the price.Another thing that annoyed me was the side dish that we ordered. It was sauteed kale for $8 but the dish was so small I think it should have been half of the price or $6 at most. It tasted OK but not worth the money. My friend said that her meal was tasty but OK. I think she wanted actual pieces of oxtail in the pasta instead of shredded meat. My friend loved the space and the people but I don't think I'll go back. I was really disappointed. I would recommend that you go if you have money to waste on drinks and you don't really care about the quality or price of the food.  i really wanted to like this place.",8,2,0,Mel D.,"Brooklyn, NY",22,62,13

3.0,6/14/2014,"This is a 3.5 star review.First of all, this restaurant DOES take reservations (I've made them) - there is a Red Rooster in Maryland that I accidentally called first (not looking at the area code) which is very small and does not take reservations.The cornbread is the best I've had (my husband said that too - and he doesn't typically like cornbread) -- silky, dense texture with kernels of corn and faint honey taste throughout. My husband started with the spring salad -- fresh, crisp greens, pickled baby beets, shaved radishes and a ginger/lemon vinaigrette.  Nice salad, nothing special.My brother-in-law loved his deviled eggs -- creamy egg filling with the perfect amount of mustard heat.  I stole one and concur.My dirty rice and shrimp was outstanding -- a sweetness to the tomato sauce in the rice and the shrimp were fresh and perfectly cooked.  Didn't care for the grilled romaine lettuce leaves but did enjoy the yogurt sauce.My husband's oxtail pappardelle was just okay.  Nothing special.My brother-in-law enjoyed the meatballs, but the star of that dish is the mashed potatoes (I had to order a separate side of those myself -- they're sooo silky and buttery with fried shallots to top -- I found them to be better than the famed mashed potatoes at Atelier Robuchon in Paris).My blacked catfish was very good, fresh fish, perfectly cooked, but my taste, the rub had too much smoked paprika and clove ... seemed a little out of balance.  And, I really didn't care for the grits -- they seemed to sticky to me ... were definitely underseasoned (and I couldn't even tell there were ""cheddar"" grits ... I literally just looked up the dish online so I could accurately describe it and was surprised there was supposed to be cheese in the grits ... the menu type describing the particulars of a dish is so small I couldn't actually read it at the restaurant).  The side of mashed potatoes made up for the underwhelming grits.We shared the ice cream sandwich for dessert, a soft(ish) slab of pecan maple surrounded by chocolate cake with a blueberry sauce (with whole blueberries) and whipped cream.  Nice.The service started out well -- one of the managers came over to introduce herself and ask whether we'd dined there before (no).  But then a deep-voiced and stylish server appeared and simply asked ""are you ready""?  We were, but it would have been nice if he had taken the time to introduce himself and ask whether we had questions (particularly since we had told the manager we hadn't been here before ... perhaps he could have told us some of the more popular/better dishes ...).  We also told him we were celebrating my brother-in-law's birthday (I saw a dessert appear at another table and thought it would be fun to embarrass him slightly).  We placed our orders and didn't see our server again, except in street clothes on his way out the door.  The shift change was not kind to us ... we were left in the dust and when our new server finally arrived (also very stylish), he was friendlier but no more attentive.  And, the birthday thing was lost in the mix ... so, no candle with the ice cream sandwich.The wine list is nothing special.My brother-in-law and I said we'd come back ... my husband, not so much.",1,0,0,Dana R.,"Seattle, WA",45,470,0

I had the Harlem mule which is with bourbon and basil and lime and ginger beer. Very good. We started with the dirty rice and shrimp and the vegetable jar. Shrimp was delish with a nice cool yogurt sauce. Vegetables were pickled and came with a green sauce and carrot sauce. Both really tasty. Then I had the fried yard bird which was enormous, crispy and juicy. Great light but tasty breading with an awesome and unique spicy hot sauce. The mashed were silky and so yum. Collard were ok. My girlfriend had the meatballs which were delish as well and suggested by our waiter. His suggestions of meatballs and dirty rice were spot on. Then we had the pistachio sponge cake with sweet cream cheese whip lemon curd and rhubarb sorbet. I enjoyed it.

Impeccable service. The only error was a mistake on the bill (actually undercharged us initially). Glass was never more less than half full. Food was good but overpriced. $18 mac and cheese? $12 for 5 mini donuts? Paid for the atmosphere and the quality of service, not the good.

4.0,6/9/2014,"Arrived on a Thursday with reservations. Sat at the bar for about 30 minutes until our table was available. The DJ onsite was excellent and the interior was really nice. The doorman was very friendly & attractive too :) The cocktails were tasty- we had the Savoy & the Yes, Chef. Once seated we waited just a bit too long for our waiter to approach the table. I'm not one to complain but I was wondering if we had been forgotten for a moment. We started with Chicken and Waffles, deviled eggs and cornbread. The appetizers were excellent! For dinner we had the Fish & Grits (salty and a bit small), Uptown Steak Frites ( center of meat was tender the edges were extremely chewy) and the oxtail pappardelle (really good! more pasta than oxtail but very tasty). For dessert we had the pineapple rum bread pudding big enough for 3 to split. Overall for Chef Samuelsson's restaurant It was great but not excellent- our waiter could have been more on point, friendly, and offer more descriptive suggestions/responses- appetizers were better than entrees.

2.0,6/8/2014,"I'm a new Harlem resident and went to the Red Rooster with high expectations.  The ambiance and live music were great, and the service was not bad, but the Yard House Bird I ordered at $27.00 a pop was a disappointment.  For that price you get a virtually tasteless over fried thigh and leg with a skimpy portion of mash potato and a dash of greens reminiscent of a Swanson TV dinner.  This they call American comfort food?  I won't be going back, the cool ambiance was not enough to make it a satisfying experience for me or my spouse.",1,0,0,Wilfredo B.,"Manhattan, NY",147,27,2

1.0,6/6/2014,"Before I begin I would like to state that I just made this yelp account to leave this review in the hopes of preventing someone from wasting their time or hard earned money here. I wish there was an option to give a half a star because that is exactly what I would rate this place. Don't get me wrong, it is a nice looking establishment and the decor is very eclectic, but the food is mediocre and there are not that many options for their midnight brunch. On top of the gross food, you have to yell to be able to hear the person next to you because the music is way too loud and obnoxious. To top it off some of the servers are rude and it took forever for them to actually sit us down and take our orders. Also you can barely tell who works here from the patrons because there is no uniformity amongst the workers.I don't understand why or how they find it acceptable to charge $7 for a beer that I can get a 6pack of for the same price if not cheaper. The portions are small, and when we arrived they no longer had wings available. I am very disappointed with my experience here. The only way someone could enjoy this place is if they come already drunk or under whatever influence they prefer. Management should consider clearing out all of the seating area and opening up a dance club, considering they allow customers to dance in between tables and the food is horrendous. They would save a lot of money if they did that. Thank me later.",1,0,0,Kiana S.,"Brooklyn, NY",20,1,0

The rest of my party received their food had to wait 10 min before I got mine. Needless to say, their food was cold at that point. The menu pricing for the type of food they serve is outrageous.

My husband ordered 3 different types of beer on their menu and they came back 3 times apologizing 'cause they were out. He then had to ask ""what DO you have...?"" Apps: I had gravlax (house specialty) and it was dry and uninteresting, with a sweet mustard that could've come from a bottle. My husband  ordered the fried wings and oysters. Oysters were taste-less. The wings were so so spicy, they were almost inedible - and I like hot. Onto mains. I had the worst mac & greens with lobster EVER. Barely any lobster. No greens or caramelized onions visible (both on the menu description) It was Dry. No flavor. The mashed potatoes that came with the Swedish meatballs were the best thing we had. Finally we had expressos and the cookie plate. The menu said assortment of cookies. Our plate had 2 kinds only, seemed to have been made by the Keebler elfs. .

Every. Time.Here's the straw that broke the camel's back: A few nights ago a bunch of us had dinner.  Now, the outside hostess Jill could not have been better.  A total pro, and super attentive, and I made sure that I told her how much I appreciated her help.  Anyway, the waiter took our order, and the runners brought everything out pretty quickly even though they were at capacity.  The problem is the waiter didn't come back until we were done eating...not to check on us, or take another drink order.  When he did come back and asked how everything was, I said ""Well, I have to be honest, I'm not too happy that you never came back after taking our order.""  His response was ""Would you like to talk to my manager?""  No apology, nothing...just attitude.  I said that I didn't see a need to speak with a manager and wondered why he suggested that.  His parting words were ""Well I don't know what you want from me.""  At that point I was absolutely going to talk to a manager, but we were running late and needed to get to our next destination.Another annoyance: They have a live band, which can be really great if you like that sort of thing.  When the band is taking a break, they play tracks through  speakers outside, which is also fine.  The night I was there, they kept the recorded music playing through the speakers while the band was playing.  We asked two different people to turn the music off , as our table was right under the speaker.  Both times the person said ""I'll take care of it.""  Never turned it off.

5.0,5/27/2014,"Unbelievable restaurant. A must visit for anyone who lives or is visiting NYC. Where to start?Atmosphere - From the minute you walk into the main bar area, you feel the buzz and excitement. You have a 60+ year old dj spinning actual vinyl in the front window, with dozens of people enjoying a drink at the bar as they await their table. The crowd is incredibly eclectic ranging from local Harlemites decked out in their finest attire (the style at this restaurant from the clients to the employees is IMPECCABLE) to foreign tourists, to downtown yuppies to fashion models. The music and mood is upbeat, a sign of the renaissance that is occurring uptown.Service - On point. Our server Mia was on top of everything, from filling up our water to making sure we had everything we needed. She even threw us a complimentary appetizer AND side dish and was pleasant and cheerful throughout. Everyone else, including the doorman was polite and professional to a T. Hats off to all of you.Most importantly...THE FOOD. Wow! Everything we ordered we split between 3 very hungry men to give you an idea of quantity which was never lacking. Started with the cornbread and the fried chicken/waffles to start. Our server Mia also gave us a complimentary order of the pickled vegetables. The cornbread....is sublime. Thick, crumbly, soft...literally melts in your mouth. The sauce they give you with it is the perfect complement. I was at a loss for words and actually didn't want to share any of this. The chicken and waffles were also incredible; definitely order both of these. I am not a pickles fan but my other 2 friends are and they couldn't stop raving about the vegetables either.Mains - we ordered the Oxtail Pappardelle, the Fried Yardbird, and Helga's meatballs with a side of collard greens, grilled asparagus. The fried Yardbird was superb, and huge. We easily split that 3 ways; chicken was soft, tender and the seasoning was just right. The oxtail was actually the standout, and these 2 I recommend without reservation. My one friend liked the Meatballs a lot which were soft and not overdone and great overall but the other 2 mains were just tough company to be in. If I went again I would get the same mains and maybe switch the meatballs or something else but it is a house specialty so I would recommend getting it if it was your first time there. Both sides were superb although most of the mains came with a side of collard greens so the extra collard greens we got were a bit much but thats our fault, cant take points from the restaurant for that.This meal without drinks without tip ran us about $30 each with some coffee at the end to prevent instant nap. We were all very full but not uncomfortably so. Honestly, one of the best dining experiences I've had in the city across a wide range of restaurants.

We (my family and I) waited 30 minutes for a table in the middle of the afternoon while several out-door tables were available (and still are as I type this almost an hour later), only to be piled on top of another couple at one table. The food, which did come out quickly, was the of the most average quality. I had the mac and greens, my sister had the same with bacon, and my mother had the triple-double burger. The sides are certainly nothing special, almost tasteless. The beer menu is nothing to be proud of, though the other drinks may have been good. The staff was either rude or very slow, and the ambiance was only mediocre. The art on the walls reminds one of a highschool student art show. To be clear, that is not a compliment.

2.0,5/18/2014,"I am sad to be writing this negative review - I've lived in the neighborhood for years and have been going to Red Rooster since it opened.  The last two times I've gone, however, have been increasingly unpleasant.  I'll share my experience tonight below in more detail, but in short, the appetizers and mains are generally still solid (e.g. mac and cheese with greens has always been and continues to be amazing), while the dessert is hit or miss (the rhubarb dessert is good, the carrot cake is bleck, and the sorbets are  generally unidentifiable - they just taste like frozen sugar, not a real fruit).  Cocktails are 4-5 stars, depending on what you order.  Wine list is 1 star - see below for more info.  Service is 2-3 stars.Okay, so about tonight:  we were seated 25-30 minutes after our reservation time.  That would have been excusable - stuff happens and it's a small dining space - but the manager offered another small group (who had arrived at the same time and was waiting for a reservation at the same time) a complimentary prosecco while ignoring my husband and me.  We were standing right next to the other people, so it was awkward and started off the night on a sour note.  Determined to put it past us, we ordered our food and a red wine, but when the server brought out the bottle, it was a very young vintage - they said they had run out of the vintage listed in the menu, so were substituting the younger wine (while still charging the same price as if it were a more expensive vintage).  We then ordered a different red wine, and the same thing happened.  We assumed this was a profit-making pattern whereby Red Rooster hoped its wine drinking customers wouldn't pay attention, so we finally gave up and my husband just got a cocktail and I (finally!) got my glass of prosecco.While the wine fiasco was happening, the manager (the same one who didn't offer us champagne) came over and said she was going to have to move us, but could she offer a free dessert to make up for it? We said OK and moved, and my husband went on to order a dessert.  When the bill came, they had charged full price for dessert.  They didn't charge for our drinks, on account of the wine fiasco, but they were unapologetic about the long wait, having to move us, etc. While the food is still generally good at this place, the bad service makes this not a worthwhile place to spend your evening.  This is even more true now that Harlem has so many great restaurants, many of which have great service, creative and high-quality food, and better prices than Red Rooster.",0,0,0,Chelsea K.,"New York, NY",73,10,0

We were greeted by a hostess who waited 10 minutes to seat us though we had reservations and the dining room was mostly empty.We agreed to the corn bread immediately when asked if we wanted any and it was pretty good. Our waiter was pleasant and informative. We had some cocktails and ordered two of the recommended appetizers to share. The lamp ribs were fatty and overly blackened; the shrimp and dirty rice was good but nothing to write home about. One of us commented that the lamb appetizer was not a good omen.Two of us had the fried chicken and two of us had the catfish. The fried chicken (yard bird) was heavy and filling but nothing special nor were the sides. The catfish was relatively bland and uninteresting as were the accompanying sides.

However, the menu outside advertised a Harlem Chowder for Two, which sounded delicious. We thought it would be what it said: a nice big bowl of 'CHOWDER': a thick soup or stew with a milk or tomato base. Some people might criticize us for not asking for the specific details---- but what we got was a whole bunch of shelled seafood just thrown onto a giant platter filled with some kind of salty juice and a few pieces of really burnt toast scattered on top. We were sitting low and this humongous platter was elevated so high that it was uncomfortable to get anything off of it, plus it sat between us blocking any conversation from happening. I don't even know how to explain this: it was just a disaster. In the shallow platter, the broth quickly got cold and we were stuck having to crack open lobster tails and pick mussels out of shells, etc., etc. NOT what we expected at all. It simply was not a chowder. Not to mention the bad taste that was left in our mouth from the burnt toast.  So, we basically blew a hundred bucks and left wishing that we had just gone to McDonalds instead.

5.0,5/13/2014,"***UPDATE***Remember when I said I had 1 complaint about Red Rooster; the oh so uncomfortable chairs?...... THEY JUST GOT NEW CHAIRS! Seriously. I couldn't believe it. They are cute and comfy - problem solved!Also, I've now been here a few times for lunch and have to say that the food quality and overall experience is way better at the weekend dinner rush. On the brighter side, they updated their Doughnuts. Now it's the cinnamon sugar dusted doughnuts on top of the sweet potato instead of the filling on the inside. It's a prettier presentation & better dessert because you get more of the sweet potato! Excellent decision!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If there was a Pulitzer Prize for waiters, Ryan would be a definite recipient. His passion for the food, description of the cocktails, and recommendations for pairings were incredible...so much so that my family feared to order without his expert opinion by the end of the meal.Speaking of cocktails, Red Rooster has some of the best I've ever had in my life. I would honestly love to try every single one of them. I wish I lived closer so I could frequent the bar... although maybe it's more of a good thing that I don't...  I got the Sag Harbor Hills (hendrick's gin, mint, cucumber, benedictine). It was so refreshing. I'll have to report back on the other drinks that were ordered because I tasted all of them and loved them equally. Being a Manhattan fan, my dad had, I believe, the Brownstoner (nutmeg-infused bulleit bourbon, cherry heering, st. germain) and lovvvvedd it. My mom and sister enjoyed theirs as well, but then my mom copied me on her second :)Ryan suggested some appetizers that wouldn't be too heavy with our meal choices. We ended up getting: Oysters & Wings, Dirty Rice & Shrimp, and Salmon Tostadas. The Salmon Tostadas were my fav. and there were 5  bit-sized pieces, which was good for our table to share. My sister loved the dirty rice & shrimp. My mom wasn't a fan of the oysters, but I didn't have a problem with them. Wings were bangin. duh. I think the salmon was the winner all around though.I got the Blackened Catfish entree (cheddar grits, mustard greens, pickled onions, comeback aioli). It was amazing!! Very southern tasting like a combination of seafood I've had in Ft. Lauderdale and New Orleans. The blackened seasoning didn't overpower the fish and accompaniments. It was perfect! My dad got it too and was raving about it.I am not usually a chicken person. I am not usually a fried person. But my mom's Fried Yardbird dinner was seriously amazing. I would order it for myself next time.My sister almost ordered the Lobster Mac & Cheese, but our waiter suggested that it was a little too heavy to have as an entire meal and suggested we get a smaller portion for the table to share. Thank God he said so! It was delicious, but even with the smaller portion we still ended up having leftovers to go. She had the Oxtail Pappardelle. For dessert I had the Sugar Hill Chocolate Cake with blood orange sorbet and citrus crunch. I loooved it! Sometimes I get nervous ordering chocolate cake because too many places get it wrong - not here! It paired nicely with the cappuccino I chose from Ethiopia (there is a process for ordering coffee: 1. choose region 2. choose type). The blood orange sorbet is delicious and I wish I had some right now while writing this review. My family shared Red Rooster Doughnuts with the sweet potato filling and cinnamon sugar. My mom and dad split the Ice Cream Sandwich - very fun! I liked my dessert the best though! To top it all off, Ryan brought us Bourbon infused with orange peel and vanilla. So we chilled out a little more before we returned home. Bonus points for not having to wait at all. I had booked my reservation 1 month in advance (I seriously set an alarm on my calendar because I have been trying to get reservations to this place for years and always call too late). & more points for the meal not being crazy expensive for the quality of the food, drinks, & service. Very impressed!!There was a private party going on downstairs (Ginny's Supper Club), but there is often live music. We also found out that you can make reservations for a buffet style brunch while enjoying a youth gospel choir at Ginny's (you can't make reservations for brunch at Red Rooster). We will definitely be back for that! There's also a midnight brunch!!!Note on atmosphere: It is more modern and trendy. You can see into the kitchen. I pictured it more loungey with dim lighting. Not complaining, just explaining.I do have 1 complaint: the chairs are very uncomfortable! You have to lean back too far to hit the backrest so there is practically no support. They are awkward to hang your coat/bag on as well.

5.0,5/11/2014,"Between service, menu options, food, and ambiance, it was a no brainer for me to give this place 5 stars. We came to celebrate my mother-in-laws birthday and it was quite perfect.We had an 8:30 reservation but didn't arrive until 9pm. We were seated quickly. I loved all the pictures and art on the walls. We had 2 servers to our table. One sweet girl and a very friendly and eager waiter named Brian. They were both amazing but Brian was particularly personable. He kept coming over asking if we had questions about the menu, which we did and he was quick to answer them. For starters, my fiancé ordered the carrot ginger soup, which was very good. My future father-in-law ordered the lamb ribs were to die for. So tender, juicy, and delicious. My future mother-in-law ordered the grav lox and it was perfection. My future sister-in-law ordered the chicken and waffles and the chicken liver butter was perfection. We ordered the deviled eggs and corn bread and I put the liver butter on the cornbread and it was awesome. Just as we were finishing up our appetizers I spotted Marcus Samuelsson and my heart skipped a beat. I was so excited. He definitely saw me taking a picture of him so he came over to our table and introduced himself and it was so awesome. For entrees my father-in-law and I both ordered the fried yard bird. I don't eat chicken legs so I substituted an extra thigh for $5. The thighs were HUGE. No exaggeration.  The best fried chicken I've ever had. The brine was perfection. The chicken was tender and juicy. The potatoes and collard greens that came with the chicken were great too. The gravy was a little sweet and went well with the super spicy hot sauce. We both really enjoyed it and I have lots of leftovers!My fiancé ordered the pork chop and he loved it. It tasted more like steak. The sausage paired with it was great too. My sister-in-law had the mac and greens with maple bacon and it was amazing. Definitely what I'm ordering next time! Portions for everyone was very large until my mother-in-law got her plate. The plate was large but portion didn't match the price tag. None-the-less she did enjoy it.For dessert two of us ordered the donuts with sweet potato filling. They were perfect. Filling didn't overpower the perfectly fried donut. My fiancé ordered the ice cream sandwich and it was so good.One of the most delicious comfort food restaurants I've ever had.",4,3,4,Shira F.,"Massapequa, NY",381,381,1085

The service was great and the clientele was a mix of locals and tourists. We tried an assortment of dishes- our favorites were the oxtail pasta and the salmon tostadas.

5.0,5/6/2014,"We've eaten at some of the best places in NYC, including a few restaurants holding Michelin stars, and I would say this is one of the best all around upscale meals I've had.  The place was packed on a Tuesday night.   We had a reservation but had to wait for a while.  However the staff was very gracious about it, and we were comped 2 drinks for our trouble.  This was a really well appreciated gesture in a setting where really they were so packed that they didn't have to try and placate us. The cocktails, btw, were amazing.  Not overly sweet, with complex composition.  The ambience is also really fun and engaging. They had live music for most of the evening which was also fun.  It was just loud enough where you could hear it well and dance but you did not have to shout to hear your friends speak.  Now, the food was INCREDIBLE.  We had the chicken and waffles and the fried oysters and wings.  I'm not sure what kind of batter they used to fry those oysters but they were off the charts.  The wings were great and they gave us hot towels afterwards. the chicken and waffles was also great. It's hard to describe these dishes well because they sound like items that are so commonplace and yet somehow spices and flavors were combined to make these ordinary sounding dishes taste really unique and special.  The kimchi lobster roll was an unexpectedly light treat.  Lobster wrapped up in a pickled cabbage with a kimchi type aioli.  The triple double burger was huge and also amazing.  Perfectly cooked patties with a flavorful sauce , cheese, and veggies.  The fries were good but somewhat standard especially when considering how all these other items were transformed.  For dessert we tried the Swedish cloud, a rhubarb based tart like base with a cream cheese/ice cream cloud on top. Served with what I think was a rhubarb sorbet.  Perfect light ending to an all around excellent meal.  As for the bill, yes it's somewhat pricey, bu t honestly compared to most nice places in NYC it's a great value for the money.

5.0,4/30/2014,"Came here on a Sunday with a group and had a very good experience. The place was packed with live music. Loud but not annoying. One complaint that I have is I don't like when restaurants have reservations and they're not ready to seat at that specific time. I'm sure it's logistically complicated and all, but for the life of me I just can't accept it. Anywho, the food was excellent with good portions. The fried chicken was very crispy on the outside (to the point, I wasn't a huge fan) but the inside was moist and just perfect. The mash potatoes that came with it were some of the best I've had. Fish/Grits plate was also a standout with some excellent, soft grits. Would definitely make the trip to try this again",0,0,1,Lu H.,"New York, NY",294,570,1967
4.0,4/27/2014,I have wanted to eat here for a long time. I didn't have a reservation for one on a Saturday night (it was packed even at 6pm) so I waited about 15 minutes for a seat at the bar. I really love everything about this place. The hostess was lovely and friendly and the bar tenders were the same even though they were managing a lot. The prices are very reasonable for a nice restaurant. I ordered the oysters and chicken as an appetizer and the Mac and greens with lobster for the entree. With two glasses of wine I paid $48 before tip. Not bad at all. (I think I wasn't charged for one glass of wine though). The appetizer was great and Mac and greens just ok. Please note however that I don't really like Mac and cheese. I never have but I still try it from time to time to see if things have changed :). The men next to me were very friendly as well and we ended up sampling food from each other's plates. I really had a blast. I often eat alone because I am more foody than a lot of my friends.

4.0,4/19/2014,"I came here once for the club downstairs, which was nice. I'm 22, so the crowd there was a bit older than me. But this review is for the restaurant. Came here last night and asked the guy at the podium for a table for two. He asked if I had a reservation, and I told him I didn't, but he said that was okay. After waiting for a few minutes, he apologized for the wait and thanked me for being patient. I really appreciated that since I really hadn't even been waiting that long and I understood given it seemed packed and I had no reservation. About 5 minutes, we were seated by a really sweet hostess, and greeted by a nice waiter who admittedly seemed overwhelmed. Now given the initial trajectory of the evening, I might have given this place three stars, but they managed to turn it around.We ordered tacos and buffalo wings and a drink. Very simple dishes that seem easily prepared. It took forever and a day to come, especially the drink (why? The bar was right there!) When the people next to us who had been seated after us got served before us, I decided to speak up. I couldn't hear what the guy said but when he left, I said ""in 10 minutes, if we don't get anything, we're leaving."" A few minutes later a waitress came over with a glass of champagne and cornbread. In response to my confused expression, she told me it was on the house. Awesome! A few minutes later, our meals finally came. And when my date ordered his second batch of buffalo wings (which were great and came with a nice, sweet sauce), they came out SUPER fast along with an extra entree for me - also on the house! For this, I give this place four stars. The service was great from beginning to end, and I appreciate them understanding my concern about the wait, and doing something extra.

3.0,4/19/2014,"Aside from the staff being so attentive and helpful, I was not impressed with this place given all of the hype.The menu was ""okay"" but I've seen better in other restaurants in the city and in the boroughs beyond Manhattan - the prices for appetizers are just as pricey as the entrees?! The menu confused me as to what audience was being served - is it southern comfort style? General American? Not sure. The corn bread that they are widely known for was bland (dare I say tasteless) and I almost choked on corn - people shouldn't be too literal by adding corn to cornbread (keep it simple).Ok moving on to the ambiance - I liked the open seating arrangement and the option of having a private party downstairs as well as seating at the bar if you don't want a table. The place is bright and full of energy. The only annoying thing is the constant shouting from the kitchen and I know why this is done - to alert the wait staff - but it irks me and can be distracting.All popularity aside, Red Rooster is for the tourists and fans of Marcus Samuelson.

5.0,4/15/2014,"I finally had the opportunity to visit Harlem's Red Rooster Restaurant! Been wanting to check out this new spot for some time now and today being such a beautiful day in New York I decided to ditch my usual Downtown dining and head Uptown for an early dinner. Although I loved the vibrant decor due to the amazing weather sitting outside trumped any indoor option. At first glance of the menu I was excited to try just about everything but decided on the Oyster & Wings along with Corn Bread as an appetizer and for my entrée the Lobster Macaroni & Greens. In what felt like no time the appetizers arrived and literally as they were cleared from the table out came our entrées. Both were amazing, everything down to the Corn Bread had it's own special twist to it which made eating all the better. Literally enjoying every last crumb I accidentally spilled sauce on my white blouse. As I attempted to clean it myself our server Latoya appeared with a cloth and club soda to assist me. The fact that she was so attentive and helpful even with the restaurant nearly full honestly blew me away. Aside from the tasty menu every staff member seemed so vibrant. Walking to the restroom which I found absolutely adorable I was greeted by other staff members who I felt at any other restaurant probably wouldn't have spoke.  Everyone there down to the couple seated next to us who offered to share a bottle of wine and food were super nice.  As we sat and ate ""people watching"" added to the experience. We even got a chance to see the owner Chef Samuelsson casually walk by and smile. Beyond pleased with my experience at Red Rooster I waited around to meet one of the mangers (Lisa) to tell her about our server & her wonderful staff. All in all the atmosphere and energy of Red Rooster is truly a bonus. Leaving I was upset for ever prolonging this visit! ...Oh yes, the Club Soda worked it's magic my blouse was saved!

The pickled veggie that came with it was too salty to swallow.  I was hungry but I couldn't finish them. I took the mac and cheese home to mix it with some plain pasta and then it was OK. Maybe the flavor was just too strong for my liking. My friend ordered the Fried Yard Bird and it was good, but I don't think it is worth the price.

It just seemed more genuine, low key, and non-needy.Food (5) - My wife and I came with another couple. I don't remember what others had but I had the catfish (5 - on delicious vegetable succotash).

The service was exceptional but the food was just average and the music was kind of flat. Probably won't come back unless its to eat upstairs which we haven't done. Our appetizers included mac & cheese (unusual spices, tasty but not your typical gelatinous starch which I actually enjoy), kale (pretty bad), corn bread (too heavy/dense - l like it flaky and crumbly), and garden salad (very good, vinegar/pickled vegetable flavor). I had the catfish (too spicy, couldn't taste the fish) with a side of mash potatoes (so-so, I like mine thicker and chunkier - these were lighter and fluffy). My friend had the salmon (big portion but not very good). For dessert we had the sorbet which was a nice contrast to the heavy meal. I did enjoy the environment, Very diverse crowd.

3.0,4/11/2014,"The husband loves soul food. Brother and his gf also in town for the twentieth time. Looking for new places to take them to constantly. Oh and we had our 2.5yr old daughter. (yes I know, we're THAT couple.)Started with the jerk bacon, and corn bread. The flavor of the  bacon and pickles were good. The jerk seasoning was not over powering and the pickles contrasted the flavors well. but the beans and eggs were ok. The thick bacon would have been better if they were crisper. The corn bread was good but on par with most decent soul places. The tomato jam was savory but too cold for my liking. The sweet butter was good but adding alot if butter to buttery cornbread can only go so far.We ordered the roasted chicken which was text book prepared. So basically it was good but nothing amazing.The mac and greens. Where were the greens? Was it the sparse greens in the pasta? Or the arugula salad with cauliflower and carrot pickles? The pickles were great. The salad overall cut the heavy cheese and pasta well. It also wasn't macaroni, it was orchietti(sp?). but in the end it looked and tasted great. But maybe they should call it something else?Meatballs were on a bed of kraut, with a sweet light pickled cucumber slices, lingonberries, and a side of gravy stewed with different types of potatoes. Daughter loved the meatballs. The lingonberries were sweet instead of a little tart like I was expecting. But overall the dish was nicely executed. The lady entree was the pork loin. Portion size was large. Again text book executed. But with the apple and celery mash they made it a great dish.Last we got an order of donuts. Two - somewhat ""burnt"" (over done) and the other 3 were good. Came with a side of vanilla whipped cream.Overall I'd give this place 3.5 stars. The food was good and well prepared, good sized portions, good service, but a tad over priced and nothing amazed me.Next time we might try the supper club downstairs, but will probably have to have to get someone to watch the kid, or go when the band is not playing.Btw, the staff was great..super friendly.

We chose the 3-course Prix Fixe lunch on a Monday afternoon, at a reasonable $25 for the huge amount of food that you received. In fact, that would be my major criticism: too much of a good thing. I had the excellent mac & greens, preceded by a nice, fresh salad and three donut-holes for dessert (sorry I can't recall the correct name!). The mac & greens was way too much food for something so rich and 'heavy.'  My wife's meatballs were also a too-large portion. Both were delicious.Don't get me wrong I like to get value for my money, but unless you're a twenty-something, I don't think you'll be able to finish everything on your plate!

Before leaving for New York, I already decided I was going to be adventurous in my eating (you know, skip the burger and go for the lamb instead), so I went with the market greens salad (had the right amount of dressing and no iceberg lettuce!), apple wood smoked salmon (cooked to perfection) and the Red Rooster donuts (filled with sweet potato), just took the meal over the edge!My sister ordered the cornbread, and we quickly asked for some more. I will go out on a limb and say that is the best cornbread I've ever had (sorry mom!) She also ordered the mac & cheese and greens with added bacon - because everything is better with bacon. Unfortunately, they didn't add the bacon, but brought some on the side. It was cubed and had sooooooo much flavor, but I can only imagine how fabulous it would have been had the bacon been baked in with the dish.As we are all sharers, I got to sample the oxtail pappardelle (love the wide, flat noodles and the oxtails were melt-in-your-mouth good), and the preserved lemon aleppo chicken, (it came with a side of chicken mole which was paired with crepe-like pancakes). Both were absolutely delicious!I love the setup - walk in the door and you are greeted by the bar area (I can only imagine how fun happy hour must be here), while the dining room is directly behind. The bar is designed where you don't even hear what's going on while you are seated for eating.Finally, as we were discussing the restaurant's owner, Marcus Samuelsson, in he walks and heads right over to our table, shakes our hands and goes on about his business!From the greetings by the hostess to the fantastic service provided by Naomi, I must say that Red Rooster made a great impression and I will definitely add this to my ""always to go restaurants"" when I'm on the East Coast.",1,0,1,Denice R.,"Oakland, CA",43,91,159

I came here with my mom for lunch on a Friday after she read Marcus Samuelsson's book and decided she had to try Red Rooster. I made a reservation a few weeks in advance and was told that I might be seated at a communal table. I called the restaurant the day before and requested not to be at a communal table. They said they would try their best and we ended up getting a nice table for two. We started with cornbread which was absolutely delicious and came in a generous portion. I ordered the fried yardbird and my mom got the red snapper. The yardbird was HUGE! I guess they're making sure you really get your money's worth because it was enough meat for two. It was pretty good but not mind-blowing. The best part of the meal was definitely my mashed potatoes, which my mom and I agreed were the best we'd ever had. Perfectly buttery. I wasn't crazy about my collard greens--they seemed a little bland for my taste. My mom's dish was really well flavored and she kept raving about the black eyed peas which she never eats. We were both stuffed after the entrees so we didn't get the doughnuts but the couple at the table next to us did and they looked so good! The bill was $96 (we each had a glass of wine too) which seems pretty steep, even though we ordered off of the normal menu and not the lunch specials menu.

We tried the fried yardbird and the fish and grits along with cornbread, and it was all delicious. However, the rest of our dining experience was really just unpleasant:(1) Ridiculously loud music. There isn't a single seat in the restaurant that's even remotely sound-proofed from the throbbing live music in the bar. Don't go to Red Rooster if you expect to talk to anyone else in your dinner party, because you won't be able to.(2) Awful wait. We had an 8:30 PM reservation on a Monday night, and we were made to wait 45 minutes with only the scantest apology. Why should it be so difficult for a popular place that's been open since 2010 to manage their reservations properly on an off-peak night?(3) Crowded. Once you fight your way past the bar and are finally shown to your table, you'll likely be bumped into by waiters as they constantly squeeze past the closely packed tables. My chair must have been kicked half a dozen times by passing servers.(4) Mistakes with the food. I found three bones in my fish within the first few bites. If you're paying $30 for a filet, you expect it to be pretty clean.I'm not sure whether I'd go back or whether I can honestly recommend this place to friends, because the food really was very good. If you do go, be prepared for what will feel like eating in a night club, including the wait and all.",1,0,0,Doris H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,0

1.0,4/5/2014,I had a bad experience at red rooster last saturday.  The host told me there was a 20 minute wait and then proceeded to sit 4 groups of people whom arrived after i did.  On saturday they do not take brunch reservations so i thought this was strange.  I noticed all the tables that were sat were all white tourists and honestly felt the host had racially profiled me.  After i noticed this a member of my party (white) went to ask about the wait at which point the host said there was none and sat us right away.  I am very sad to share this news as i love to support my neighborhood and great places but cannot stand for a restaurant that would allow such a disgusting act.  I had been to this place many times with my white husband and received great service and now will never go again.  In my opinion go somewhere that celebrates harlem instead of exploiting it as a cultural experience for tourists while shunning those that live there.,2,1,1,Maria N.,"Atlanta, GA",54,2,0
4.0,4/4/2014,"While visiting my best friend for the weekend, she made it a point to take me to some place she thought I would enjoy. Of course, I mean restaurants. Now, I am not a city person. I don't get a hype from visiting downtown and I don't get swept up by the grandeur of New York. Its fun to visit, but the mere presence of a restaurant in NYC doesn't automatically make it great. This place earns it own stars. On this particular day, we stopped for lunch at the Red Rooster. It was within walking distance of her workplace and she had nothing but good things to say about it. Trusting her opinion, while starting to form my own, we stepped into the Red Rooster and I felt excited. The place is swanky. I will give it that. The staff is alive with pep and eager to please their guests. Looking at the menu I had no idea what to order, and she had no idea what to recommend. It all sounded good. She did however promote the corn bread which I will turn around now and do the same. Its very good.I settled on ordering the Jerk Chicken, mainly because I had it one time in a carryout container that this very friend had given to me from some restaurant unknown, and that it was so good I am determined to find out where it came from. While this particular Jerk Chicken wasn't as good as my original, it was very satisfying. Even its presentation was memorable. *I couldn't help but notice the group of women sitting next to us. About 4 or 5 of them all taking pictures of their meals in unison, a trend I seem to have started among my own friends.",0,0,0,Daniel G.,"Harrisburg, PA",109,222,3019
2.0,3/31/2014,"I didn't know what the buzz was about, but hearing about this from various sources, I became excited for the chance to finally try this place. Celebrity fame from chef Marcus Samuelsson, and Obama created quite the word of mouth.I was in the neighborhood this Sunday with the GF, and we decided to give this place a try. It has been on the to go list for awhile. No reservations were available for Sunday, but we were told we could get a seat at the bar.There was no line per se, but it was more of a free for all. Sasha and I saddled up to the other side of the bar, and stood over a couple from France who were enjoying their Sunday brunch. We ordered a tasty beverage (The Earl of Harlem) and proceeded to wait  while other people who chose more wisely sat down before us.The wait was not to bad however as there was live mediocre music playing, and the atmosphere was festive. Time flew by, and we finally got our seat at the bar, after an hour. While we were eating, I got a decent view of the food, and decided to try the hamburger which looked delicious. My poor GF, a vegetarian, had less of the menu to choose from. She decided to try the Gravlox. I didn't get to try the meatballs, but they looked delicious as well.We also wanted to try the cornbread, but the bartender talked Sasha out of it. because of the pancake that came with her Gravlox, which is a shame, because I bet that is a must try!By the time we were seated the crowd had dwindled, and the bar was not that busy. That is what made it so surprising. It was basically impossible to get the bartenders attention. From the water with no ice, to the teeny bit of ketchup, and the 20 minute wait for more ketchup (I actually got up, and asked a bus boy myself), the service was atrocious. The bartender looked unhurried, and un-busy, yet it was almost impossible to get served. The bartender serving us, was prompt with cleaning anything on the table, and seemed to hover at the cash register avoiding eye contact with every single patron.The food was tasty, and I enjoyed it, but it was tempered with the wait for any service, and the feeling of being marginalized as I spent 15 minutes leaning over the bar trying to get anybody's attention. Perhaps if I came here with a table, the service would have been more alert, but having my food get cold as I waited for ketchup and water to go with my meal was very frustrating. If the service had been more alert, there is no doubt that this would have been a 4 star review.The hamburger was juicy, and moist, and a very good choice. The Gravlox, was nothing special, but a good appetizer. The french fries were pretty un-special, even with the Parmesan, and thus the ketchup was even more important. Finally the salad was fine, but I would have liked more dressing. However, I never got the chance to ask.When it was time to leave, I managed to get the women bartenders attention, who seemed more friendly, and more attentive then the guy serving us. We got the bill, which also took a bit of time, and Sasha looked it over. I noticed that the price was wrong! The Earl of Harlem was listed as 13 on the menu, but we were charged 15. I flagged down the bartender, and pointed this out to her. She shrugged, and told me that was the price in the computer. End of story. No apologies, or suggestions to get the manager. I couldn't believe a highly recommended place would operate this way. I decided to tell the hostess, just to alert the staff off the mistake on the menu if nothing else. The hostess asked me who the bartender was, which made me uncomfortable. I didn't want anyone getting in trouble, and she was... the more friendly bartender.. The hostess walked over to the bartender and asked what happened, then returned to me, and said.. ""That's what the computer charges"". After a pause.. she offered to get the manager.The manager seemed concerned, and handled the situation spectacularly. He said the menu needed to be fixed, and offered to give us a drink on the house. We were ready to leave, so he decided to give us his card, and said if we came back we could each have a drink. After our experience here, I am not sure when we will be back, but I believe this was handled well. In fact it makes me want to go back.I usually don't penalize a place for the service or the employees, but at a venue like this with a good reputation I felt something was lacking.If I go back, and get that drink, or go when it is less crowded, and sit at the restaurant, then I will update this review.",6,0,0,David R.,"New York, NY",170,144,1

1.0,3/27/2014,"I'm sorry but this place was a disappointment. My mother and I caught dinner here after work one evening, and we had really high hopes for the place! Especially me, as I had met Marcus Samuelsson just a few months before (and we actually saw him there chatting it up in the dinning room the night we went too). Anyhow, let's cut to the chase. The atmosphere and people are great!.... but the food. The food. The food was nothing special. :/ As my best friend who lives in the area likes to put it ""It's a place where people go to be seen, it's less about the food.""We ate downstairs, my mother ordered fish and grits (which was 37 something dollars LOL)  and I ordered a burger (around 20...eh, but OK). I personally thought the fish and grits were over priced (considering the portion, preparation/ presentation and taste)...and I wasn't even paying!!!!! Although the presentation of my burger was great, and the bun seemed fresh, my burger was nothing to be wow'd by, AND about half way through it I decided to do away with the bun and only eat the burger and fries. Red Rooster gets 1 star, a thumbs down, and a thanks but NO THANKS from me....not because of the ridiculous prices, but because there was a HAIR on my burger. No joke, this is why I could only give 1 star. (IMAGINE IF I HAD NOT TAKEN THE BURGER APART?!? Til this very day it grosses me out)Marcus was in the dining room, while there was hair on my burger. I was in disbelief, shock...what ever. We will not be going here again, UNLESS it's to have a couple of drinks and soak in the good tunes. I know this is based off of ONE visit, but seriously.

3.0,3/19/2014,"3.5 stars is probably more accurate to my overall review of Red Rooster but that's only because:1) I left Hoboken 1.5 hours before my actual reservation just to ensure I was there timely since I knew getting to Harlem would be a hike, and still somehow waited 10 minutes after my reservation time for my table. I understand you can't kick people out of their table but then again- what's the point of making a reservation?2) we were sat at one of those communal tables. How come other parties of two got their own table with personal space? Felt like I was cheated in a way. Maybe this is me being too ""American"" but the couples next to me were annoying and I didn't care to listen to their conversations but had no choice otherwise.Food wise and customer service wise- everything was good. The yardbird is as good as everyone raves about. The skin of the chicken is beautifully spiced and perfectly crispy. The mashed potatoes on the side were the best mashed potatoes I've ever had and I even loved the greens. The best part of the restaurant is the decor and the ambiance. I felt transported when I entered- it is like an experience. Great lighting and wall art and bookshelves of cookbooks and little knickknacks gave it an intimate feel.I'm a huge fan of Marcus Samuelsson and mostly wanted to support him by dining at his NYC location.

Seriously, I felt like banging my head on the table in frustration trying to get attention from our waiters on both visits. I even went up to the bar to try to get my own drink and couldn't get the bartender's attention.

2.0,3/12/2014,"We decided to check out the Red Rooster as an alternative to our usual short list of local dining spots (and after I read an essay in the NYT by its owner, Marcus Samuelsson). I made a reservation for a Tuesday evening the week prior. I almost canceled my reservation because, after booking by phone, I received a confirmation via email that stated, ""Please note that your reservation might be at our communal tables."" No mention of this had been made when I spoke with Rashida, who took my reservation. I was a bit annoyed (I'm taking my gf on a date at a fancy-schmancy trendy spot and we'll have to share a table with strangers--seriously?) so I called the restaurant and told them I wanted a table for two and NOT a communal table. I was told, ""we will make a note of your request"". I replied, ""I'm glad you're making a note of it but will I have a table for two or not?"" ""We can't guarantee that but I've made a note of your request"" came the reply. I was ready to cancel but my girlfriend, being the good sport that she is, said ""nah, let's go and check it out, it's supposed to be great"". So we went. We arrived a couple of minutes early for our reservation and were told that they were running behind. It was a Tuesday night and the place was absolutely packed, both the bar in front and the tables in the back. We were seated 30 minutes behind schedule (not acceptable) although they did offer us some nice cornbread on a plate, which we had to eat standing up as there was no place to sit. All of the staff, from the doorman, the hostess, and the coat-checker, were solicitous to a fault. The food was solid, if unspectacular, and  when I'm paying close to $30 a plate, I'd like to be dazzled. I had the jerk chicken which came with what were billed as ""tostones"" on the menu. Tostones are fried green plantains. The waitress explained that they were not, in fact, classic tostones but RR's variation of them, which are actually platanos maduros (i.e. ripe and sweet). They were delicious, coated with cornbread, but unfortunately they were very skimpy in quantity with just 3 or 4 small ""tostones"" on the plate. The chicken was moist and tender. Portions were just right for a single serving (unlike many places that give you so much food that you have to request a doggie bag). The HF had the grouper with cheese grits, which she enjoyed but wasn't floored by. She LOVED her drink though--the Obamatini, a spicy cocktail made with Aquavit.We topped off the evening with a shared slice of chocolate cake that was much more to the HF's taste than mine; I like dense rich and moist cake and this was lighter, though still good. All in all, between the expectation that you will share a communal table (whether you like it or not) and the tardiness (what's the point of a reservation?) being seated, it will probably be our first and last outing to the RR.",2,1,0,David O.,"New York, NY",7,63,3
4.0,3/10/2014,"Great atmosphere, this place is always bumping!  Of course this is much of the appeal/fun of the Red Rooster, but the food is good too.  My suggestions: Starters -- Their corn bread gets taken to the next level with a side of sweetened butter and spiced tomato chutney.  The fried green tomatoes are good enough.  Sides -- The mac and cheese is delicious.  The collard greens are amazing.  The menu option that combines both into one dish, however, is not that good.  Main Course -- The fried chicken (or yard bird) is a solid choice.  But don't bother with the steak... seriously, just don't (it's tasteless and overpriced, even if they do serve it with a tasty hollandaise sauce... and don't get me started on the pitiful, cardboard-esque, formerly-frozen french fries they serve with the steak... an embarrassment to bistros everywhere).  Dessert -- I've only tried their sweet potato doughnuts, which are good, but nothing special and not worth the extra money or calories (but of course this didn't keep us from eating them all).  Drinks -- Great wines, good beers, and lots of cocktails, as you would expect.  All in all a good choice for a night out.",0,0,0,J B.,"New York, NY",0,28,2

4.0,2/27/2014,"After stepping into this Harlem jewel at noon, with its French-café ambience whose walls were filled with art pieces and mostly-black-and-white photography, I felt appreciative to have made it to book my seat a few days in advance, especially after witnessing the ""house"" being half full at this hour of a weekly working day.  My feeling of appreciation doubled after having been warmly greeted from almost every staff member who happened to be in my way from the reception till I reached my communal table, safely.  The thankfulness gesture was still to escalate after discovering the Southern cuisine was having a lunch prix-fixe for $20.14--and not the $25 that was announced for Restaurants Week 3-course lunch, as it coincided with Harlem's Restaurants Week, too.  ""What a steal!"" I whispered.The open kitchen was on fire, and so was my appetite. I was wondering what my very first encounter with the cooking of the celebrity chief Marcus Samuelsson, one of Food Network's Chopped judging panelists, was going to be for my craving.  It was noticeable the prix-fixe menu's items were derived from the Restaurant's regular menu.The Market Greens Salad and Coconut-Cauliflower Soup did not fail my high expectations.  All vegetables were allowed to keep their true selves untouched.  However, the addition of nutty flavors, with sweet-and-sour chopped apples created elegant attire to an otherwise predicted outcome.  The mussel broth of the Apple Wood Smoked Salmon felt light as air, with absolutely unparalleled richness of flavors.  The tenderness of the salmon, topped with what it seemed as a hollandaise sauce and mustard seeds, was handsome.  The Mac & Greens was another classic the kitchen knew how to celebrate to the dish's full capacity.  It was very hard to even guess what to expect from the only dessert choice appeared in the simple-looking menu.  Doughnuts the dessert dish it was.  Admittedly, I felt belittled for lowering my expectations of this one kind of available-in-almost-every-American-simple-coffee-house dessert, when I should have raised the bar high for being taken by an absolutely happy surprise for all the dishes I had tried by this point in time.  The white-sugar coated small balls of dough hosted a magic filling within that was nothing but sweet potato cinnamon cream, which--by the way--made me close my eyes to enjoy the dreamy journey into what generally taken-for-granted dessert.As love was what began this experience, it was exactly what ended it up; every member of this restaurant on the way out made sure to effortlessly greet and ask if the time spent was enjoyed.  Did I have a special time?  Absolutely.  Would I repeat the experience all over again?  Of course; that goes without saying!  (Review of The Red Rooster-Harlem Lunch Visit on Thursday, February 20th, 2014).",3,0,1,Victory O.,"Manhattan, NY",5,15,217

We replied that perhaps we were, but at the moment we just wanted to get in, get seated at the bar and take it from there.  We were rudely told we had to wait another 40 minutes.  This is not the way to treat your customers and is very unprofessional.  We are professional men who were presentable, approachable, and just wanted to relax and enjoy some music.  Our money was not worth spending here this night and perhaps moving forward.  We left and went elsewhere.  My wife, mother, sister, and I visited this restaurant when they first opened and my wife and I have also visited from time to time on various occasions.  We have noticed the service is unprofessional, and they are greedy and steer you towards bottle service in order to be seated, otherwise they remove the chairs from the bar and you are left to stand, leave, or just hang around uncomfortably.  The place can get extremely crowded upstairs at the bar and you better be spending or you will be standing downstairs or be embarrassed when they begin to remove chairs right while you are seated and maybe snatch the chair right from under you.  Whether you are buying individual drinks, bottle service, or just dining; this shouldn't be contingent on whether you are allowed in the restaurant altogether.  They suck for this!",0,0,0,Jeff B.,"Bronx, NY",0,1,0

First time here:I was in NYC on business and had a free night to jump on the subway and head to Harlem based on a recommendation from a friend that works at C-CAP. I was by myself so I wore my stretchy pants in anticipation of a pig out. Started with the cornbread which was good, but then tried the second bite with the red sauce that comes with it and WOW was that an awesome flavor combination.  Had the Caribbean bacon as another appetizer which was also excellent and tasted best when everything in the dish is mixed together to make a complex flavor. Had the Yardbird for the main course. Nice crust on the chicken and comes with two dipping sauces. This dish was good but I was not blown away. My favorite was the gravy, but you can hardly ever go wrong with gravy. Pretty stuffed by this point (I wish I really was wearing stretchy pants) but made it through half of the pineapple bread pudding. This dish was good but again was not blown away.

2.0,2/11/2014,"Red Rooster makes you want to sit up straight and tuck your napkin in your shirt throughout the meal. A friend and I casually stopped by while walking through Harlem so were dressed pretty casually. The moment we got into the door the hostess very enthusiastically came towards us asking if we had a reservation. We didn't even think about this being a reservation spot at 1pm in the afternoon. They had more than enough open spaces though and we were seated. She just seemed so excited we were there and ""being too nice"" is a weird complaint but it was almost creepy/fake nice. We were sandwiched between a tourist group of midwestern white women and a young professional trio. I know white people love Harlem now but it's so strange to feel outnumbered in a soul food-esque/inspired place. The service here is almost too well trained where it feels like being served by robots. ""Pardon my reach"" was repeated every time the server had to pick up a plate or leave a drink like I know you have to be in the vicinity of the table to serve me, relax. It was just hard to relax when the hostess, the bus boys and servers are soooo tightly wound. The food didn't make things better. I had the groper fish and grits and cornbread. My friend had the yard bird with Parmesan frites and collard greens. The fish and grits was a pretty small serving but the yard bird was a nice size. Not soul food sizes but better than fancy restaurant/tapas sizing. The cornbread was the best thing with a tasty tomato jam I think. Fish was good but so lightly seasoned it didn't really leave an impression beyond 15 minutes. The greens were actually more memorable and probably a great vegan choice. I had a bit of my friend's dish and the chicken was bland even though I heard rave reviews about it. The parm fries were literally just plain fries with some sprinkled shredded parm. Nothing special. None of this would of been as bad if it wasn't so pricey. They had steak on the menu and it was only like $5 more than most entrees. Hmm...chicken or steak with only $5 difference? I hate to say ""for Harlem"" like it isn't worthy but still...they prices for Harlem are a bit unreasonable.They didn't serve hard cider so the server suggested a great muddled hot wine. Hands down one of the best drinks I've ever had. So the servers do seem knowledgeable even if a bit robotic. If I ever feel like having Red Rooster again i'll just head to Tribeca to spend the same amount of money for better food with more relaxed service.",5,3,0,Michelle S.,"Brooklyn, NY",47,142,75

I have no complaints about the service, food, or drinks --- they were good, just not blow-your-pants-off good. And while I love Marcus Samuelson, I just wanted better.This was my 2nd time at Red Rooster. Learning from my first experience a few years ago, I came for dinner right at 5:30pm when they opened. If you don't make a reservation, it is next to impossible to get seated at a normal dinner time. (Last time, my friends and I waited 2.5 frustratingly long hours because so much of their dining room is saved for reservations only). Regardless, we were promptly seated (for 2) at a communal table towards the back, in front of the open kitchen. The entire place is clean and rustic, and watching the food get prepared is cool, but it appeared as though the only table for walk-ins were the 2 wooden communal tables at the back of the restaurant. Nearly every other small table was non-occupied and yet we were seated there... hmmm...Nonetheless, the service was never lacking - from the hostess to our waitress to the bus boys - everyone was professional and attentive. The manager even came out to greet every table. We ordered the cornbread as an appetizer - came with 2 warmed slices accompanied by honey butter and tomato jam. Honey butter = excellent, tomato jam tasted like... well, tomatoes... and completely overwhelmed the taste of the cornbread. We shared the Mac & Greens and Fried Yardbird as entrees - both good, just not blown-away great. My friend liked the mac n cheese with collard greens better than the fried chicken... I thought the mashed potatoes that came on the side hit the spot. We both agreed the fried yardbird skin was awesome (crispy and crunchy), but wished the chicken meat inside was hotter and more flavorful. The spiced seasoning gets tossed on the outside of the skin, but the actual chicken meat was kind of bland. We also ordered the Red Rooster doughnuts with sweet potato filling - like last time, they came in a mini fryer which is super cute. Nothing to complain about there. 7 mini fried balls of dough covered in cinnamon sugar with amazing homemade whipped cream. Kudos. Overall, the restaurant is charming and classy. We may have been a little under-dressed, but never felt out of place. Service and food were excellent, just not memorable. I really, really wanted to love it but I'm not sure I would trek all the way to Harlem to eat here again.

5.0,2/6/2014,"Wow, I was really really happy to finally try Red Rooster after wanting to try it for so long.  During this same trip to New York, hubby and I were burned by another famous chef's restaurant (Butter), so I was slightly apprehensive, but we were both wowed by the experience from the moment we stepped in the door.We came on a Tuesday night but it was still packed and very happening, with live music going on for Latin Tuesdays.  The band was off the rails good, and had people moving in their seats and bobbing their heads in the bar area.  We had some drinks and enjoyed ourselves while we waited for our 3rd person for dinner. The drinks were very good and the music set the mood for a fun, classy evening out.   Well, our third person did not show and the restaurant was running slow that night, so we waited quite awhile for our table.  I was starting to get antsy but was pleasantly surprised by the GM, who came by and gave us both delicious slices of cornbread!  That was a great touch which was unexpected and very welcomed.  It soothed our hunger pangs until we were seated about 10 minutes later.  Once we got seated we had a very friendly waitress and busers who helped us have a great meal.  We continued to be wowed by the service, ambiance, and the food was just amazing.  We tried the chicken and waffles, pickles, the roasted winter vegetables, and the Harlem chowder.  The chowder was a tremendous dish in both the presentation and the depth of flavor.  I cannot believe how much seafood we got for $72 for the chowder, it says it's for two but I really think it can feed 3-4 with other dishes on the table.  This was one of these perfect dishes that I still think about.  The real shame is it doesn't come with a huge bowl of rice so you can eat that with the amazing broth!  I can't wait to go back with some friends to share it with them.I could not have been more happy with our experience here!  Great job Chef Samuelson and team at creating and upholding standards and for putting this gem in Harlem!   5 star service and amazing food.",1,1,1,Jialing W.,"Santa Monica, CA",73,185,75

5.0,1/26/2014,"Errmagoodness! I had to resurrect my Yelp account for this.The short of it: It's clean, lively, and just-right-bourgeois. The biscuits-and-gravy dish ranks high among the BEST B&G this Deep South native has ever had, including those in the Deep South. Instead of themed cuisine, the eclectic menu seems like all the chef's favorite dishes to make, which is just the way I would have it. The hype is justified.The long of it: With all the hype surrounding Red Rooster, I went there with my brow of skepticism raised higher than The Rock's brow of whatever-it-is. After an experience at the also-hyped Amy Ruth's left me entirely underwhelmed, I fully expected the same thing here.First things first, this place is clean. The dishes, the utensils, the floor all sparkled. I didn't check the bathroom, but I could tell by how the waitstaff behaved that there was an all-around expectation of cleanliness. As someone who prefers to die of natural causes or be raptured rather than perish because of a communicable disease, I was pleased. So I stayed.I went for Sunday brunch as a party of one and sat at the bar (because brunch ain't brunch without cocktails). I ordered the biscuits with red gravy. I'm a purebred Southerner, so I was reluctant to order this item because too many restaurants interpret the biscuit as something that should be dry and hard and think of the gravy as cornstarch-thickened saltwater. But I saw someone else get it, and greed overtook reservations.It took a minute for the bartenders to realize that I was ready, but the food came quickly after I ordered. Otherwise, they were quite attentive despite all the patrons vying for their attention.The dish was perfect. I mean, perfect. The biscuits, two of them, come topped with eggs and smothered in a red *sausage* gravy. The eggs didn't look real, but I'm hoping they were because they tasted so. The gravy was tasty, perfect consistency and not too salty. Most importantly, the biscuits...errmagoodness, the biscuits!...had the perfect density--moist, not wet--with a crisp outer layer. I just had to drop the mic, er, napkin and go into a praise break.I had a pot of Ambessa breakfast tea, which was nice. I'm not big on breakfast tea, but I had to do something to forestall onset of the itis.To top it all off, the bartender gave me a cup of the mulled wine to try. It was a fantastic red with cinnamon, nutmeg and other spices. Truly delicious. They should bottle that.This place can get crowded. But this is a celebrity restaurant in Harlem with good food, so one has no legitimate reason to be disappointed about that. There is also a very old school live band in a corner near the window singing in all the historically black genres and gospel, and thus giving the restaurant a firmly Harlem identity.All that to say, it's not hype.

As it came closer to noon, the place became louder and much more crowded.  We had the cornbread, which was yummy, and the crab cocktail which was served in a mini-mason jar. That was yummy too. My uptown bloody mary was just eh. The grilled shrimp and grits were great. There was no room in my tummy for dessert. The decor has a vintage feel with photographs and art throughout, even in the bathroom. The staff were attentive and I adored their ensembles. I didn't like paying $5/bottle for plain old water. Really... All in all, we enjoyed ourselves and finally crossed this place off our list.",0,0,0,Monica B.,"Santa Clarita, CA",1,108,39
1.0,1/21/2014,Pretentious! Best way to describe this place. We had high expectations of this place since the owner had so much accolades. I had chicken n waffles. The waffles were of eggo quality just a different look. Very blah dish. My friend had Mac and cheese. Being vegetarian he thought this was a safe option only the bits of pork and taste of lard was a clear NO NO! We won't return. Better food on a food truck,1,1,0,Melinda C.,"Brooklyn, NY",24,13,3
4.0,1/20/2014,"Top notch & 1st class! This was a Saturday afternoon impromptu visit; a friend and I was hanging in Harlem and was feeling peckish.   Although, we passed many food joints - it was the Red Rooster reputation that allowed us to continued a forced quarter mile south walk on Lenox Ave.  On a side note, been to Red Rooster location, Ginny's Super Club (located on the lower level), but never ate at Red Rooster itself.  Upon entrance, the environment was mellow, folks chilling at the bar counter... our lovely host, gracefully seated us at a comfortable corner booth that shielded the foot traffic entrance and she attentively checked our coats.  We were given the brunch menu, which ended at 4pm. Our professional and efficient waiter, Ryan, was just the right amount of talkative.  Like most, you're offered to start with drinks - one of my minor pet peeve about Winter is finding a cocktail to complement the season that doesn't involve ice and coffee.  When perusing the menu, there it was ""Harlem Toddy:"" a spot on drink mixed of Jack Daniel honey, Starr african rum, earl grey tea, spiced coriander syrup.  This warm glass of deliciousness put an ear-to-ear smile on my face. For my meal I had the ""Beaten Biscuits & Red Eye Gray"" served with a fried egg - ultimate comfort food, confirmed Ryan.  The buttery biscuits are topped with minced seasoned sausage and a fried egg. I ate it slow to savor every bite and moment. We were able to sit way past the brunch end time, without feeling hurried to move forward as there was a changing of the wait-staff and dinning area. For example, my friend's friend join us 30 minutes post ordering our food and past the closing of the brunch timetable, without hesitation her order was taken, served fresh and ever so appetizing looking.   Although dessert is a must have, I was to full and it wasn't even a conversation to do a takeout dessert, which I currently regret x days later.",0,0,0,Laverne W.,"Jersey City, NJ",56,74,128
1.0,1/19/2014,"If you're looking for authentic, amazing Soul Food don't go here. You're better off going next door to Sylvia's OR going down to 114th Street to Melba's. My experience at Red Rooster was EXTREMELY disappointing. This place can't decide if it's a club or a restaurant. The music was so loud, I couldn't even hear the person sitting right next to me -- and I'm 26 so it's not like I'm losing my hearing. On the Saturday night when I went it was for a friend's birthday. The friend happens to be a Senior Producer for a well-known show that often has celebrity chefs, and while I wasn't expecting special treatment, I at least thought this would mean we'd see Red Rooster at its best. But, instead, the experience was lackluster mainly due to service and salty overpriced food and cocktails. To start -- our server offered cornbread as though it were complimentary, but it's not. And he hardly ever came to the table to see if we'd like more wine or cocktails. There were seven of us at the table and he (along with the restaurant) could have made a TON more money off of us if he had simply asked us if we'd like more drinks. When the cornbread was brought to our table, along with the deviled egg appetizer (which has a sauce underneath the eggs that is way too salty!), there were no individual plates given to us so we could actually eat the appetizers. When my boyfriend asked for small plates for the table, the server only brought two (again, there were seven of us). After apps, we had the market green salad which was a delight. It's bright and not overdressed with salad dressing. Afterwards, our main courses came out. I had ordered the Mac N Greens with lobster. The dish was cold in the middle as though they're either making them the day before and putting them in the freezer/refrigerator and NOT assembling it to order. I realllllly didn't want to be THAT person who sent food back, but I really wanted my food to be at least warm. The server took it back to the kitchen and in the meantime I ate a few of the sides that had been ordered for the table to share. One of the sides that was ordered was the Roasted Root Vegetables. Not sure what happened here, but they were sorry excuses for a root vegetable plate. They were diced up so tiny it looked like baby food and surprisingly I kept coming across bites of overcooked AND undercooked vegetables -- kind of ironic considering Marcus Samuelsson gives people a hard time about that on the Food Network's show Chopped. So I moved on to the grits -- another side ordered for the table. They were probably the highlight of the meal (other than the salad) although they were a bit too salty, too. But at least they had an earthy flavor to them from whatever cheese was used in them. Again, ironic that so many dishes were too salty since Chef Samuelsson reprimands contestants on Chopped for doing that. When my dish finally returned, everyone else had already finished their meals (and during this time the server didn't come by once to update me on how much longer it might be). Also the dish was an entirely new mac n cheese, an effort I appreciated but all I really wanted was the one I had to be heated up in the oven for just a few minutes. Sadly, the mac n cheese they brought me wasn't the right one, either. I had ordered the lobster version, and they brought me the maple bacon version with three pieces of lobster claw meat right on top. I didn't want to be THAT person to send it back again so I just kept the plate this time. But I couldn't get through more than a few bites because the bacon was TOO salty which is why I never originally ordered bacon in my mac n cheese. The waiter never came back again to see if the dish's temperature was to my liking -- something servers even at an Applebee's would know to do. One of the other people at the table ordered the steak, and when asked what she thought of her dish (it also came with fries), she said the fries were better than the steak. Again, disappointing. Desserts were ordered for the table, and they were also sad. The doughnuts with sweet potatoes in them were ice cold. The chocolate cake was dry. And the apple oat dish tasted more like over sweetened oatmeal. BUT the Guatemala coffee was good! (Definitely get that if you're looking for some espresso at the end of the night!). TAKEAWAYS: The service is downright disappointing. The food is, for the most part, too salty. And for what you get, this place is WAY overpriced. I'm the kind of person who loves everything from hole-in-the-wall places to nicer restaurants and I can say that I have had better service at a roadside mom & pop place than I did here. I don't mind paying more for something fabulous, but this was anything but fabulous. If you're looking to go to a restaurant from one of the Food Network chefs in NYC, you're better off going to Alex Guarnaschelli's restaurant Butter. With service and food like this, I'd be surprised if this restaurant sticks around..",0,1,0,Lainie F.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,44,18

The food took a little longer to come that I wanted it to (it was a Saturday night in the city to be fair) but when it came it was so worth it. I had the macaroni and greens and it was delicious. The salad it came with was a little salty though. Even the lemonade was delicious. Afterwards my family and I went downstairs just to see the environment and it looked amazing.

The place was packed despite snowstorm Hercules coming down quick! The vibe was incredible! Had a couple of very good drinks at the bar. Ordered half the menu and loved everything we ordered!  We even had the chance to meet Chef Samuelsson and Chef Ludo, who happened to be there previewing their new show, Taste!  Chef Samuelsson is the nicest guy. Very down to earth and seemed genuinely interested in making sure we were enjoying ourselves. He surrounds himself with an equally amazing team!

4.0,1/9/2014,"Came here for a birthday date night. Had to make reservations well in advance for a Friday night, when we arrived there were a slew of people waiting in line and spilling over to the bar (or maybe they were just there for drinks). Since it was a celebration, I wanted to reserve a bottle of champagne in advance to be waiting at our table. I was in contact with Lidia, who responded within a day of my request and sent me the wine list, and I emailed back with my choice. I didn't receive a response for a few days and followed up again, but still did not get a response. I should have called earlier, but I only remebered the day of - I spoke with someone who confirmed my reservation, but they had no record of the champagne being ordered. Apparently a form pre-authorizing the charge for the bottle was supposed to be sent to me in advance. They did not charge me over the phone but noted my requested. When I checked in, the host confirmed the bottle and passed the message along to our server, who confirmed with me again and promptly brought it out for us. While I wanted the champagne bottle to be a surprise for my date when we arrived, given the crowds in the restaurant, this was probably not possible to have it set up in advance, but I wish that the order would have arrived as a discrete surprise. The confusion may have been in part my fault since I changed the reservation date like 5 times, but I would have been sure to prepare the pre-authorization form had it been sent. ANYWAY, that was pretty much the only small complaint that I had, which is really my own fault for making things complicated. Oh and also that they ran out of cornbread! Given how cheap it is to make cornbread and the insane margins it must have, it boggles me that they were not in stock, but we were able to try other dishes instead.We started with the braised goat tostadas which were really great, small portions but each bite was incredibly flavorful, and also the dirty rice and shrimp, and mac and greens as a side. They were out of the cornbread to my dismay, since we longingly watched the couple next to us enjoy theirs. Main entree we got was the Fried Yardbird - a large, juicy bird, not your average overly dry fried chicken. We rounded things out with the Red Rooster sugar donuts, which they put a candle in the ice cream for the birthday. Overall, definitely a good recommend for a special occasion, though the restaurant itself is pretty casual. Prices are on the higher side, especially for Southern food, but the quality of the food was great and, other than trying to reserve the champagne, the service was great as well. In retrospect, would not ordered the bottle, since the one bottle ended up being more than the total of all our food, and would have opted to try a few of their cocktails instead.

4.0,1/3/2014,"Went on a Sunday night without a reservation.  It was pretty busy and we expected to wait in the bar for a table.  The bar was 3 deep.  There is really no accommodation for waiting.  Its not comfortable but we waited anyway.  We eventually got seated in the bar area not at the bar to order dinner.  We were immediately attracted to the 'chowder'.  The description on the menu did not do it justice.  It was a masterpiece of seafood artistry so succulent, well prepared and beautifully seasoned when Marcus came over to the table our mouths were too full to respond.  I get the complaints about the 'attitude'.   The staff is not hospitable at all.  There is a feeling of 'do we fit in here?""  and I am not the type of person who ever feels out of place anywhere.  But Marcus is so charming and so genuinely pleased to see people loving his food, it actually makes up for the snobby attitude and lack of charm of the staff.I recommend only making reservations to get a table in the dining room.  Eating in the bar area is on very hard uncomfortable stools and in the winter there is no place to put all your stuff or at least no one offered to take out coats.  It was a juggling act you dont mind when having a cocktail but no through an expensive dinner.I liked the food a lot.  I want to go back.  I'm a fan of Marcus.",3,0,0,Susan H.,"New Brunswick, NJ",66,73,21

2.0,12/16/2013,"I want to like you, Red Rooster, I really do. But I feel like you are just the Justin Bieber of the restaurant industry. Needless to say, I fall for the hype every time. I get that you have the backing of a celebrity chef, and your Sunday morning brunches with a live jazz band are pretty bad ass, but your food fails to impress and your nightly bar service is mediocre at best. The first time I came was wayyy back in the day when you guys opened. I was tired on my weekend bar scene over at the Corner Social and had to switch things up. When I walked in, my eyes immediately were lit up by the site of your bar. What a pretty mecca of wood, brass, and alcohol! Really, the bar is a sight to be scene. However, I never got to even try a drink because your bartender ignored my friend and I every second he could. After that, I promised myself I was done and the hype was just hype.However, a few months ago, I gave into you only because I was going on a date and the gentleman asked me where I would like to go (that means I wouldn't have to spend my hard earned cash). Since you are right down the street from my place and it was possibly the last nice day of the year (yes, I fell for your outside patio), I decided to give y'all another go. This time, I got to see the live jazz band and almost wished I had sat inside to enjoy some music with my brunch. For drinks I ordered a Bloody Mary and my date ordered a mimosa. I did not try the mimosa so I can't comment. What I will comment on is that the Bloody Mary, which was supposed to come decked out with pickled vegetables, was very basic. I have been on flights where the airlines have served a better Bloody Mary. Next up was the food. I ordered the Smoked Trout and my date ordered the 3 egg omelette. Again, can't comment on his but I can say mine was not worth $16. I can see around $12, but $16 for a wimpy piece of fish and some garnish which was supposed to be a herb salad? No, don't play with me, Red Rooster.Anyway, the bill for the two of us came for around $70 with tax and tip. And like I said before, I would not waste my own hard working cash on it. Its sad because whenever I tell any out-of-towners that I live in Harlem they always ask about the Red Rooster. I want to brag and flaunt that we have some of the best food in New York, but I just rightfully can't. However, I will return because I believe I should give dinner a shot before I write you off.

3.0,12/13/2013,"The food deserves 4-5 stars but a few things took away from that.Took my date here as a birthday lunch treat and we decided to order off the prix fix lunch menu. Found it strange that they sat us up front despite all other customers being seated in the main dining area in the back. In the beginning, though, i thought it was nice to have the whole front area to ourselves. However, midway through our meal, despite there being many open tables, they seated other guests at our long table. If it wouldn't have caused a scene, I absolutely would have objected. That was not at all how i envisioned things and I did not like having to share the table. Before we started eating, they asked if we would like some corn bread for the table. I assumed it was complimentary and accepted. When the bill arrived, we had been charged for it. I find this to be extremely sneaky and again, had it not been a bday celebration, i would have opened my mouth and said something.Otherwise the food was very good. Way too much for me to eat in one sitting so i brought home leftovers. My bf and I both opted to start with the sweet potato soup, which was very good. For the meal, he had the salmon (delicious and topped with raisins) and I had the mac and greens, which had a small side salad and macaroni and cheese made with gouda cheese and I believe spinach. They also served little donuts as dessert. I'm not a big donut eater but I thought they were good.It's pretty expensive so I probably wouldn't come back on just an average day. Maybe for another special occasion but I certainly won't be sharing tables again!",0,0,0,Arielle S.,"Manhattan, NY",417,335,0

3.0,12/6/2013,"3 - 3.5 Stars.Had a part of this review saved from last Thanksgiving (2012), and never finished it...but think it's worthwhile to share some thoughts on this trendy, overpriced restaurant. So here it goes...A visiting friend and I came here for Thanksgiving dinner after there was unfortunately a mess up with my reservation at the packed Sylvia's next door. We debated a bit about if we should try Red Rooster, with me knowing it would be overpriced and a totally different style from laid-back, traditional Sylvia's. Anyway, we decided to give it a shot (I really just wanted a Thanksgiving-style meal and since Red Rooster was offering something along the lines of that...then so be it.) The wait surprisingly wasn't long...although I do still remember a hipster guy who took my name down, and me standing awkardly waiting as there isn't really much set space while you wait to be called. Also remember the service here being very whatever or blasé...not very ""warm"" for sure...but who expects that here? The Thanksgiving plate was $28...which is quite expensive...especially for the amount of food you get. We also ordered mashed potatoes and cornbread on the side -- they were both good quality and tasty, but nothing that is memorable or stands out in the long run. I tend to prefer carved ham for Thanksgiving, over turkey because turkey tends to be dry dry dry. They only had turkey, and I wasn't expecting otherwise. I don't remember this turkey being particularly moist or amazing, but it definitely wasn't bad. I do remember not having many slices though...By the end of the meal, we were both decently full, but not STUFFED, which was alright. The two of us were SQUISHED (really, could barely move arms and no room for purses or camera, phone, or anything) in a communal table, between two couples who did not seem to be very pleased at all...especially the older couple on my left seemed to be having the worst time with each other. It was a bummer, and of course being that close to each other, we could all hear whatever each was saying. I guess they weren't in the holiday spirit, and I think this experience didn't do much to help that. Friend and I did notice though that the couple to the right of me ordered the exact same dishes as us (Thanksgiving plate + mashed potatoes and cornbread).Anyway, there are so many good restaurants across NYC that I wouldn't bother coming here again, unless their prices lowered and portions expanded. For what it really is, this is just too much of an attempt at being current, trendy, and well, came off a bit pretentious.",1,0,0,Tiffany L.,"Oakland, CA",25,183,14

4.0,11/26/2013,"I had been trying to get a reservation for about three month.  Although their were available times none matched when I was able to go.  This past Saturday the wife and I were in Harlem for a Baby Shower.  After the Baby Shower I decided to drive down 125th Street.  I caught the light at Lenox and 125...then I looked left and booom the sign for Red rooster.  I say to the wife - I'll pull up in front, you go in and ask if they can seat us.  Can't hurt...although deep down inside I did not think we'd be seated.  She goes in and comes back out smiling, ""Hostess says she can seat us in 15-20 minutes.""  I find a spot walk in and after 20 minutes of people watching and taking in the decor - the hostess signals over to me for our table.  YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY HAVE A RESERVATION THOUGH.I loved the decor - it actually went with what I expected a Marcus Samuelson establishment look like.  The wait staff and workers were nicely dressed and very friendly.  The crowd was cool, trendy, touristy and all together very NYC.Although the menu selection is not very large, what they do offer all sounds amazing.  We started with Chicken and Waffles.  What!!!  These were amazing....the waffles were nice and fresh and the chicken was nicely cooked with a wonderful crunch.  The portion was perfect to share.  In addition, we got the Fried Green tomatoes and Corn Bread.  Corn Bread was ok.  But the fried Green Tomatoes had a buttermilk ranch dressing and bacon.  Holy Bacon and great tasting.  They were lightly breaded and cooked perfect.  The dressing and bacon are a nice touch.  (I try this every where I go.)  After sharing three apps, we decided to share an entree - Mac and Greens.  Cheese, Collard Greens, Bacon and spiral pasta...bubbling hot.  It was amazing.  Came with a small side of pickled veggies...very tasty and a wonderful compliment to the Mac and Greens.  Bacon in two different dishes...love it!   The service was good.  Our waiter was very attentive as were all others.  My water glass was constantly being filled up, drinks and apps came quickly.  We were not pressured to get up and leave...although the front at this point was packed with people.  Its a nice spot to have a date or double date.  A lot of the dishes I would definitely go back and share!",0,0,0,Jose B.,"Queens, NY",49,57,20

5.0,11/24/2013,"I'll preface with this: I was sponsored to go here (industry/vendor event) and would probably go back at least once a year (didn't know the prices since it was a custom menu for us). However, their drinks are actual mixed drinks with FRESH juice. The yardbird is great. Cornbread is the real deal.I tasted someone else's mac and cheese though and a bit too much onion for my taste. I like my mac and cheese onion free but to each his own. I noticed they are very particular about keeping your table clean and constantly filled with water or whatever drink you are having. Waitstaff is nimble and didn't knock into me once despite me having the end seat on a large table jutting out into the aisle.They host good talent so if you are there on a Thursday 7-11pm there will probably be a musician there you may recognize. Patrons seem to be mostly a 40+ crowd. Good place to take a partner for anniversary date when you've saved up some money to splurge I imagine. I didn't see the prices but I imagine between a party of 2 it could easily be a $300 night.However, this is the one instance in which I would say it's worth it because they truly deliver on the ambiance, unlike other high priced establishments which may have good food but terrible service and decor.It seems a lot of the bad reviews would be regarding the sticker shock - But that's where prudence comes into play.

4.0,11/20/2013,"We went there on a Friday night. We booked ahead of time, but then 2 friends decided to join us. We were lucky enough to be able to add them to the reservation last minute (we tried to add them a couple of weeks before but that did not work - I suspect people book ahead and then cancel last minute when they get the reservation reminder). Anyway we ended up being 4.The place is incredibly loud and busy, something I would expect in a club/lounge kind of place more than in a restaurant, but once you sit down and the food starts coming it seems quieter. Maybe the table are well positioned, maybe your are more focused on the food... don't know it noise stopped bothering me once I sat down.We ordered some incredible fried green tomatoes and a delicious chicken and waffle that we shared. The sauce on the fried green tomatoes was a garlicky ranch-type sauce with just the right amount of kick and it paired beautifully with some sweet and perfectly fried green tomatoes. The chicken and waffle had great balance. I had chicken and waffle once before and thought it wasn't a thing I understood: sauce and waffle to sweet seemed to clash with the chicken, but here the balance of sweetness worked out perfect.For the main course, I shared the yard bird with a friend and the boys got the catfish and the fish and grits. I tried a bite of the catfish that was cooked to perfection and was surprisingly un-greasy.Also I tried the grits: good, soft, creamy.. from what I understand exactly what grits should be, but I still prefer my polenta (I am a polenta fundamentalist so take this judgement with a grain of salt).The yard bird was amazing. Don't know how you can fry a duck and make it taste so lean! I would order that again without thinking about it twice!We then had dessert. The donuts (thanks to the server suggestion) and the apple and fennel thing. The apple and fennel thing was OK, but the donuts were amazing. We fought over the last two even if we were stuffed and the donuts were cold by then.We also had good wine, attentive service and some good after dinner drinks.

The best part of the day was the Gospel music...it filled the space with excellent energy and the lady who was singing was a doll! We ordered a variety of dishes...the standouts were the crayfish grits and the collard greens (also a great option for vegetarians as they are not cooked in/with any meat). These dishes had good flavors, but they could've been hotter...my pet peeve is eating lukewarm food! My entree was called the Harlem Fry; they refer to it as a baked eggs but I would say it's closer to a frittata. It had very little flavor and was kind of dry. Usually, baked eggs are baked in some type of broth/cooking liquid, which allows them to absorb flavors. The food was okay. I wouldn't go back for brunch, especially since I live downtown and it's somewhat of a trek. However, I would be willing to give their dinner a chance to see if perhaps I just ordered something that wasn't very special. The other thing that perplexed me was that it is a Marcus Samuelson restaurant...considering his past restaurants and the fact that he has no background in Southern cooking, I found it somewhat strange that he was trying yet another concept that doesn't seem to align with his culinary background.",0,0,0,Gregory G.,"New York, NY",0,5,0

4.0,11/7/2013,"I arrived at Red Rooster Harlem half an hour before our booking time on a Monday, so went to wait at the bar while my husband was parking the car.  I requested a chocolate martini - not on the menu - and was told that it was ""No problem!""  And clearly it wasn't.  The chocolate martini that arrived was tasty, well balanced, nicely chilled and definitely generous.  I ordered some 'Red Rooster Nuts' and received a *very* generous bowl of warm, spiced nuts, interspersed with dried cranberries and cracker wafers.  The bowl was large enough to take to the table when we reached our reservation time, and we continued to nibble them throughout the evening.I started with a very nice caesar salad - crisp with just the right amount of dressing - with corn bread croutons.  The croutons, while nicely toasted on the outside were a tad sweet for me, but the salad itself was so nice, it made no difference to the overall standard.  My husband had braised goat tostadas, which were a perfect serving size.  The goat, in my opinion, could have been a tad tastier, but my husband had no issue with them and enjoyed them thoroughly.For my main course I had the 'Mac and Cheese with Lobster'.  I admit - I buckled and ordered a second serving of lobster which, as it turned out, wasn't necessary, but was enjoyable none the less!  The mac and cheese was perfectly cooked, the sauce creamy and rich without being gluggy, and the lobster was very nicely cooked.  My husband had 'Helga's Meatballs', which were delicious.  We had the buttermilk mashed potatoes and cow peas for sides and loved the potatoes, without being wild about the cow peas.  In retrospect, we wish we'd tried the collard greens.For dessert I had the doughnuts with sweet potato filling, served with clotted cream which I spread on each bite and was generous enough to last to the last doughnut (my main gripe about ice cream and cream is that its often too meagre in its serving size to make it to the end of a dessert).  The sweet potato filling didn't seem necessary to me, tho the creamy center was unexpected and made the doughnuts even more moist than they already were.  A lovely dessert, all told, though my one suggestion here would be for the doughnuts to be served with a knife, so the cream can be spread more easily.  As it was, I used my spoon - effective despite being a little clumsy.  My husband had the pear crisp with the cheddar crust.  This comes with peanut butter ice cream and he requested vanilla instead.  When the original peanut butter arrived, he mentioned it to our waitress, and it was swapped out with no issue. The pear flavor was very pleasant, and the cheddar crust gave it a nice bite.  We finished with the brandied dark chocolate truffles, which we couldn't justify, but had anyway.  The wines were excellent (we tried the riesling and the malbec by the glass), and the nuts from the bar were enough to last as a nibble to the end of the meal.There was no question, however, that the star of the meal was the service.  From the female bartender, to Jamie, our lovely waitress, to Don, the maitre d', our welcome was warm and attentive, without ever being over bearing.  When our desserts came out of synch (mine somewhat before my partner's), and then with the peanut butter ice cream rather than the vanilla, all the desserts - including the truffles - were taken off the bill.  We didn't expect that, but were impressed by it, as it indicates a genuine commitment to service.  The gentleman who held the door for us to show patrons in and out was a nice touch.I would definitely go again.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant.  I enjoyed the food and the entire experience was relaxed and easy.  And if you go - ask for a chocolate martini!",0,0,0,Kareyn S.,"Harrison, NY",1,6,0
1.0,11/5/2013,"Holy Tourist Trap, Batman! Did I really select this as our brunch destination? (smack)   Seriously, this celeb-chef owned establishment left me absolutely baffled!First, the highs: The Bloody Mary: Peppery and Strong enough to numb/soothe the rest of your experience here (if this review didn't already send you racing toward an alternative).Then, the midpoints:The design of the restaurant - ooh, you so fancy! Honestly, the prim and proper chicness of this place reaffirms that sometimes the look of restaurant has no direct correlation on the quality or taste of its food.The service - the best attempt at trying yet failing. The staff is dressed well and try to maintain a level of arrogance as they move about the restaurant. Unfortunately, the operation is completely disorganized and undisciplined with multiple random people asking you for your beverage order (even as you sip your coffee and bloody mary while they ask), plates and glasses crashing about, food appearing in front of you that was meant for another table, and/or your table companion, and napkins being rolled up (as someone gets up) like a 3 year old would do it. Seriously, do it the right way (by not getting your hands all over the napkin, you know, the professional way?) or just leave it alone.Finally, the nasty bits:The coffee: Wait, really? You're serving me a no-refill cup of Maxwell House for the price of a Venti Caramel Frappuccino? Oh, I know it's from a bodega can; I used to use them to train new folks in my old Starbucks days so that they could understand the difference between something good and something crappy.The food: batched and pre-made to the max. Everything from our salads to our omelets to our (salty) yard bird was pre-cooked and just awaiting final assembly when we ordered it. Seriously, the food is lukewarm. The cheese or sauce that smothers it is what's hot. And how does a Top Chef All Star think it's okay to smother fried chicken pieces (that should be eaten by hand) on both sides in sauce? Chef, really, when was the last time you were forced to eat a drumstick of fried chicken with a knife and fork? I know, I know.. I could use my hands and wipe them clean later! If only the waiter didn't clumsily fondle my napkin when I stepped away to the men's room.The cornbread: Really? You're pulling a fast one on me Red Rooster! Asking ever-so-politely, yet so casually if I want some cornbread to mop up my salty entree - as if you were asking whether or not I'd like a refill on my tap water -  without bothering to tell me that those two slices were going to cost me practically as much as my alcoholic beverage.

2.0,11/4/2013,"Came here Saturday by happenstance (we were going to try Sylvia's but I didn't want to go to a touristy place) for early dinner around 5:30 with my fiance and I was excited to try a Marcus Samuelsson restaurant for the first time.  They would only sit us at the bar or at the communal table by ourselves in front of the open kitchen.  Cool atmosphere, great design.  I noticed that people had stolen a few framed pictures from the wall in the chic bathroom- really, people??Sitting in front of the kitchen, we could observe all of the delicious looking dishes coming out, ready to be served.  We ordered a bunch of apps and sides- -the fried green tomatos, -a side of mac and greens, -wings, -chicken and waffles, and -corn bread and -hovel beerWe saw a fried green tomato dish ready to go out but was sitting there under the heat lamp for a while.  We didn't realize it was due to be ours ours... everything arrived at the same time, and we were disappointed to be simultaneously inundated with all this food rather than have it coursed more appropriately.  The tomatoes that had been sitting under the lamp were cold, and deserved to have been served to the table *immediately*, as the appetizer it was ordered to be.  The mac and greens were just meh, nothing special, and the chicken and waffles combo we've never tried before were just not for us (the waffle part) but the chicken was great, though small on portion.  The wings were a solid B, very interesting, and the cornbread was most and felt full of butter.  Overall, this is a very expensive restaurant for the neighborhood and I wasn't blown away by the food.  The service was friendly, except for refusing to seat us at a two-top (that was allegedly unavailable, but was seated sans reservation 5 minutes after we sat down), and the ridiculous lack of coursing.  I wouldn't make the trek up here again to spend $9 (!!!) on a draught beer and overcooked pasta, and small fried chicken serviings in the mecca of fried chicken.",2,0,0,Cynthia L.,"New York, NY",0,41,10
1.0,11/3/2013,"My friends and I had been looking forward to eating here since last summer when we attended Chef Samuelsson's lovely book signing event at the Strand.Sadly, we were very disappointed by how we were treated at Red Rooster and did not even get to try the food. Many of the complaints here on Yelp seem to be about service, and our experience is yet another.We walked in around 3:30 on a Saturday.  There were a few empty outside tables and a tall table near the bar.  We walked up to the hostess who said we should sit at the tall table.  As we followed her and our menus to the table, she asked us to wait until it was cleaned before we sat.  So, we waited...and waited...and waited.  There were quite a few staff members walking around, and taking to each other but no one cleaned our table.  A bartender finally asked us if he could help us, we explained what was going on and he said ""well, I'm sure someone will clean it.""  We waited some more...a second bartender asked us if if we needed help...at this point we were quite hungry and wished to sit as we had walked quite a bit.  He went over to the hostess who went to find someone to clean our table.The bartender did apologize and asked us to be patient, someone was coming soon to clean the table for us.A few minutes later (we had been waiting for about 20 minutes at this point) a group of five people came in.  A second hostess came up to us and said we should sit at a table near the bar that already had three other people sitting at it...they had been there eating the entire time and were not at all finished.  We explained that we had been waiting for the other table to be cleared and she said the table were were waiting for was not our table, as it was clearly a table meant for more than just three people (there were four chairs at the table).  We left.  We will not be back. Chef Marcus, we wanted to try your food, you are a sweet, kind man; perhaps you should give some lessons in manners to your staff.",1,0,0,Sue F.,"New York, NY",15,120,3
4.0,11/1/2013,"I wish I could give 4.5 stars since I can't quite say it was a 5 star experience but it was awesome all the same.  We were a very large party of 7 and the place is really small and very busy.  We had to wait about an hour for a table which isn't that bad considering we were there for brunch.  They even had live soul/jazzy/blues music and a fabulous singer who walked around the place singing.  We started with some bloody marys (so good!) and cornbread (also great) and then had a variety of dishes like the Migas, French Toast, Harlem Fry, Red Line Burger, and the Fried Yard Bird.  I had the Harlem Fry, which was tasty but had too much egg for my tastes.  I would have liked either less egg or a bit more of the hollandaise sauce.  The fried oysters on top were perfectly seasoned and cooked though.  The highlights were the French Toast which came with a selection of dipping sauces like strawberry sauce and nutella and the Fried Yard Bird.  They can make some seriously delicious fried chicken here.  I'm knocking off the half star because our waiter forgot about us for a while.  Not too bad since the place was extremely busy and we were a big table.  I'd recommend heading here for some delicious soul food.",0,0,0,Holly M.,"Austin, TX",5,93,0

I ordered the yard bird and it caused me to be sick later on that evening.. not cool. My dinner companion had the Mac and Greens.

It was extra disappointing because I thought the dish that carries the restaurant's name would be excellent, but it seems it is completely the opposite as everyone really enjoyed their food.  The service also wasn't great - our waitress came to our table only after we waved her down to ask for the menu. We had to wait another 8-10 minutes before she re-appears, but to answer a question the next table has. She said she would come to us next, but she just left.

5.0,10/28/2013,"I just had a magical evening at the Red Rooster. I live in San Francisco, but am in  NY periodically for work, and I have been itching to try this place. I have enjoyed reading Marcus Samuelson's books, and really appreciate his vision of African (and African American) food traditions as rich, beautiful, interesting and scrumptious. I called ahead and was told there was room at the bar. We cabbed up from midtown, and the place was Packed. No way there was a table, no way we could get food at the bar... But it was a warmish fall eve (at least this San Francisco girl is used to 55 degrees). So we ate outside. I guess the servers were pleased with or pioneering, because the manager came and chatted with us, and then a bunch of the other tables filled up. Somehow we made friends with the manager and the servers - they were amazingly friendly! Charming, warm, chatty, just awesome. And then mysteriously we were sent out whole host of extra sides on the house, and everyone kept checking on us. Incredible service! Felt like we were part of the neighborhood. And most importantly, the food was amazing. We had pickles, tandoori fish, grouper and grits, corn bread, greens and deviled eggs. A feast! Such interesting flavors. My father was southern and my kids are Ethiopian, so I know something about both traditions - such wonderful flavor integrations! The fish and grits were my favorite. Rich, tangy, fresh. Delectable.

3.0,10/25/2013,"""I think James Brown is playing at the Apollo."" Make a reservation. Otherwise you will be seated at the bar, the ""Speakeasy"" in the basement, or at one of the communal tables along the wall. Sit ANYWHERE other than the communal tables. You will literally be rubbing elbows with your fellow diners and being subjected to their little quirks and quacks. I was forced to listen to the nasal conversations of my compatriots. Does everyone have adenoids these days or is this some kind of new regional speech pattern? I don't care what it is... it's insufferable. And I also watched this lady remove every piece of fried batter off her Chicken and Waffles. It was sacrilegious. Being a party of 1, I was placed in-between two other parties. Once drinks and appetizers and entrees start coming out, there really isn't space for 6 people at these damn tables. And of course I get the only stool without a back so I ended up sitting on my coat and perching my purse on the top of my feet. *sigh*. But the Fried Yardbird saved the day. And the Starr Punch was pretty good as well. Don't be shy about getting at that Yardbird with both hands. The napkins are nice and thick. Add little dips of the hot sauce for flavor.The Mac & Greens were underwhelming. I kept adding the accompanying paprika to it, all for naught. I was told it was a blend of spices.... it was paprika. Having asked to keep the mashed potatoes off my order since I was getting the Mac side, I would have liked to have seen that reflected in my bill. It was not. The staff is super friendly, but there's really nothing they could do to make dining at those damned communal tables any better.",9,10,6,Karen S.,"New York, NY",462,430,866

2.0,10/21/2013,"I was so looking forward to dinner at the Red Rooster but ended up leaving feeling incredibly disappointed. I'm not sure if we just went on an off night or what, but I doubt I'll be back.The night started off when we arrived for our 9:30pm reservation on the early side and were told we'd be seated closer to our reservation time. That was totally acceptable so we headed to the bar to enjoy the live blues music. When 10pm came and went things started to go downhill. Not only was the hostess and her manager incredibly unapologetic but we didn't end up sitting down until well after 10. We were still super excited for the food but found that fair to average at best. Yes there were a couple standouts - the cocktails were great and the corn bread was out of this world. The Swedish meatballs were also delicious and unique, but that's where the fabulousness stopped. The fried green tomatoes were good, but not great and the fried chicken and waffles were fine ( the breading was interesting but the waffles were ordinary) as were the roasted nut appetizer and Parmesan fries. Good, but nothing special. I wouldn't waste my time with the Mac and cheese, as you can find a similar dish at a certain cheese shop in the west village that knocks it out of the park, and the burger was just plain over cooked. Really, my biggest issue was that I've had better versions of many of the dishes we tried at other restaurants in the city. Normally this wouldn't bother me so much but for a restaurant that has received so much hype and is on the pricier side, I was just so surprised by the experience. It's also worth noting that the restaurant was LOUD. I'm all for live music and initially thought it was really cool, but when it's 11 o'clock on a Sunday night and you can't can't carry on a conversation with your family over the noise, there's a problem.",1,1,1,Kyle B.,"New York, NY",2,16,0

4.0,10/19/2013,"Yum-a-lum! Let's dive right in with the cornbread. GET IT! It somehow has the texture of a spoonbread but can be (gently) picked up with your fingers. It is the most texturally fascinating piece of cornbread I have ever had, and I must pause my reviewing now to see if its recipe is on Marcus Samuelsson's website.................IT IS!!!! I hope it is as good!Next matter of business: the other food. Here's what we got and how we liked it:-Shrimp and grits: a little hard to get the shell off the shrimp, but it was a nice, hearty entree-Mac and Greens: I know this has been a dish of controversy on Yelp, varying between the ""best mac and cheese ever"" and ""way too soupy."" It was definitely a saucy mac and cheese, and the greens in it did little to make it feel healthier, not that that is the goal. The greens on the side were simple but were made interesting with the pickled vegetables. Super Scandinavian-meets-Soul.-Smoked Trout with an herb salad and pumpernickel: This was awesome! I love smoked fish, and it was not the dried out, pounded stuff that is sold in subpar markets. It is top notch, moist, smokey, fleshy fish, and a good portion of it, with dill and other perfectly suited herbs. It reminded me of my family's Swedish inspired dinners at Christmastime.-The Market Greens Salad was actually really good too! Usually market greens just mean overpriced arugula with a vinaigrette, but somehow this salad had substance.The food was probably three stars, but I could not get over the atmosphere. Between the friendly service, cute family photos in the bathroom, and live latin band at the bar telling all the super-square tourists that they should be dancing, not clapping, I was thrilled and will happily grant a fourth star.

4.0,10/10/2013,"I took myself out to dinner at 10 PM on a Friday night. The front of the restaurant was pretty packed with bar-goers, but there was plenty of seating available for the dinner service. As others have mentioned, seating is at long communal tables - I ended up squeezed in next to a couple on a date, which was luckily not as awkward as I feared. The whole place was super loud (the DJ was really blasting the music).Service was a bit hit or miss - they were very nice and responsive to questions when they came around, but often went missing for long periods of time.I ordered Helga's Meatballs, on the advice of my server. The meatballs themselves have great flavor; the cream sauce is exactly what you would want to accompany them - warm, rich, and just a bit tangy. The lingonberry sauce was also great, and went very well with the mashed potatoes. The red cabbage was braised till tender, with plenty of fatty pork pieces throughout. The entree also comes with crisp cucumber pickle slices, for a much needed contrast with the soft/fatty texture of the rest of the dish. Well worth the price, overall.Drink-wise, I ordered the Earl of Harlem (whiskey, earl grey, spiced coriander syrup) - it had a mildly spicy finish, but didn't overwhelm the palate. It's definitely spendy at $15 (and probably should be $4-5 cheaper), but has a great combination of flavors.Overall, fantastic food/drink. There's some pretty good people watching in the bar area, though I can see how the noise and cramped quarters would be frustrating for a party of 2 or more.",0,0,0,Sue S.,"Chicago, IL",0,8,0
4.0,10/5/2013,"This place serves some delicious soul food alright. Everything about this place mixes classy with homey, high-brow with low-brow, from the the plates right down the food itself. The portion sizes here are huge, even the sides. When we all came here to celebrate. We started off with the fried green tomatoes. The  tomatoes had a nice crust, not too thick and not too thin, and were topped with a creamy sauce and cooked bacon. Then came our entrees. I ordered the Mac n' Greens as a side dish portion and the Cornbread. The Cornbread was absolutely the best cornbread I have ever had in my entire life. It was more cake-like with a delicate crumb and a nice fluffy texture. The cornbread was served warm, and it was so buttery and just perfect. It's also served with maple butter and tomato jam. I wasn't a huge fan of the tomato jam, but I loved the maple butter. I probably could have been happy wolfing down two plates of that cornbread alone. The Mac n' Greens was also really delicious. It was exactly what a good mac and cheese out to be. Perfect al dente cooked pasta, I was addicted to these pasta corkscrews, with a creamy bechamel sauce, and a nice crust of cheese on top. The collard greens were the perfect justification for this decadent meal. The side dish portion I found to be very large as well. Other members of our party ordered the famous Yardbird. I tried part of the drumstick, and I have to say that this was some pretty good fried chicken. The chicken was moist with a shattering well seasoned crust, but boy was that a large piece of chicken. Another companion got the Burger, but opted for a side salad instead of the french fries. That side salad cracked me up, because it was huge. It was the size of a large regular side, but it looked delicious too. The service was speedy and attentive, as well as friendly. They were also very accommodating about making changes for the food. Of course we had to have dessert, so we ordered the Passionfruit Tart and the Red Rooster Doughnuts. The Passionfruit Tart had a chocolate cookie base with a passionfruit custard. Instead of the raspberry sorbet we opted for the passionfruit ice cream, which was so delicious. The ice cream was so creamy and not too sweet. It had a really great passionfruit flavor too. The Red Rooster doughnuts were yeast doughnuts soft and chewy with a sweet potato filling and covered in cinnamon sugar. If you couldn't tell already we obviously had a lot of fried food that night, but we're still up and kicking. I was more partial to the Passionfruit Tart, because I just love the combination of sweet and sour. But both desserts were great.

Based on other reviews, I decided to stick to apps because they portion-heavy. I got the fried chicken and waffles (one boneless breast with collard greens, one waffle, bourbon infused maple syrup, and a weird fruity butter) while my friend went with the yardbird entree (two pieces of dark meat with mashed potatoes). We split the fried green tomato app (three medium slices) and the cornbread ""snack"" (two small slices).  Everything was delicious!  The chicken was perfectly crispy and seasoned well. The meat wasn't dry despite mine being boneless and white. My only complaint would probably be the cornbread as I tend to like mine with a crunchy crust and soft interior. The slices we were served were almost pound cake-like and had no crust to speak of. I did appreciate the whole corn kernels throughout the bread but it could've been better. Overall, even without a reservation, we were immediately seated.

I apologize for my persistence, my friend has been dying to come to the restaurant for years, so I wanted to be absolutely certain that there was no way of celebrating her birthday at Red Rooster however, I was not aware of your establishment's policies. Might I suggest that this policy be reflected somewhere on the website or communicated with clarity to your staff so that they might be able to relay as much to your patrons or potential patrons? As of this afternoon these are the various responses I have received from your staff regarding this event:1. Yesterday morning a young man kindly told me (after I told him the date and size of our party) that it must be sent through you despite the fact that it was not a private event2. After sending an email and receiving no reply at the end of the traditional business day, I call again. The young lady who answered the phone this time informed me that you had left for the day. After explaining my situation to her she told me I would have to leave a deposit, fill out paperwork and a pre fixe menu would need to be established (which was fine with me) or we could risk showing up (the 15 of us) but then we would risk having to wait an undetermined amount of time. 3. I call again this morning to be told that you are currently running the brunch but would be back in your office between 2:30 - 3:00. I work as well so I was not able to call during this exact window of time, I called at 3:30 after the appropriate vetting (spell my name, what is my email address, did I email you already etc.) the same person who answered the phone informs me that you will return my call at some vague time in the future (um she'll probably call you back this afternoon). I'm sure given the track record you can understand why I immediately felt like this was an exercise in futility but I thank her and take my leave.4.  Immediately following my last phone call, I call back not in the hopes of actually speaking to you but in the hopes of getting a definitive answer about your establishment's policies. I was lucky enough to reach the young lady who told me in no uncertain terms that you do no seat parties of 8 or more for brunch on the weekends as no reservation are taken for weekend brunch, the maître d would only be able to tell us if he has seating once we take the chance of the 15 of us showing up on Sunday, and the only way we could be seated is to come on a Monday or Tuesday. So much for the contract and the deposit.I realize that Red Rooster has gained what must be a following of epic proportions but I for some inexplicable reason thought it would be a combination of the customer service and the food, I stand corrected.

Had the mac & greens and cornbread for an entree -- solid enough, but nothing spectacular, so this was a little bit of a letdown given this is a high-end pricey restaurant. Then I shared the sweet potato donuts for desserts -- on a least one previous occasion these were sublime, but last week they were just okay, kind of like glorified DD munchkins. Another drop-off was the service -- I recall at least one other time the service was perfect, this time it started out fine but got slow, which is a turnoff given the $ signs. We were seated outside which was okay but it kinda lost something atmosphere-wise vis-a-vis inside.  SO all-in-all this is a good place, I won;t write them off based on one somewhat disappointing dining experience.

5.0,9/20/2013,"I believe I originally heard about this place on NPR (maybe The Dinner Party Download), and the combination of gourmet southern cooking with some Swedish flair was definitely something that I wanted to try. The Swedish side may have been a little light, but the ambience of the restaurant, the service, and the food were all first rate.A large outdoor seating area in front gives way to a large bar once you enter the restaurant. The dividing wall between the bar and the restaurant itself has many glass bottles filled with various fluids, all brightly lit and creating a nice backdrop for the U shaped bar. On the far side, the jazz band performed beautifully - not a note was off, and while it was loud from the bar area, the volume was just right for a lively dinner atmosphere in the restaurant. Once you make your way back to the seating area, you see that the kitchen is open - perhaps a bit loud, but it gives you a great view into the beating heart of the restaurant. Of course, it also gives one the opportunity to take a look at many of the food options before they're brought to their tables.We ordered iced tea as we looked at the menu, expecting them to pour us some Nestea or premixed Lipton. Not so. Each cup of tea took 10-15 minutes to arrive, apparently brewed, mixed, and chilled as needed. The results were fantastic - and this is not something I would ever have expected to say about iced tea at a restaurant.We ordered the Fried Green Tomatoes, Crab Cakes, and Cornbread to start. The cornbread didn't have the crust that I'm used to seeing on skillet cornbread, and given the shape, I can only assume it was baked in a traditional pan. I prepared myself for a dry and crumbly product, only to be greeted with a moist delicacy that almost melted in my mouth. Given the sweet flavor and good moisture of the final product, the lack of crust can practically be overlooked. The crab cakes suffered from a similar predicament - good flavor, consistency, and internal texture, without the ever so slight edge one expects on the outside. This leaves the Fried Green Tomatoes, which were undoubtedly the star of the appetizers. Crunchy outside, moist inside, not too salty, and a joy to chew on with just a bit of the sauce and a smattering of bacon bits; I could eat these tomatoes for a whole meal - and I generally give most of my tomatoes to my girlfriend.The Yardbird and Jerk Chicken came next. The Jerk Chicken stands out in my mind - the yucca mash was unique, though not particularly memorable, but the chicken was moist and flavored with the sweet and tangy broth it came in - obviously, the pineapple came to the forefront, but not so much as to make one conjure up memories of Hawaiian pizza, but more like honey roasted turkey. If only honey roasted turkey tasted so good. The chicken is served with skin, and despite sitting in the broth, the skin was, for the most part, still crisp. Not sure how it was done, but it added to the experience. The Yardbird however, was no delicacy. A honkin' half a chicken, deep fried and gravied, sitting next to a pile of mashed potatoes that would pay for an Idaho farmer's boat payment (do they have lakes in Idaho?). As American comfort food as a meal can get, and yet, still surprisingly good. Unlike fast food fried chicken, it managed to feel significantly less greasy than it looked - mind you, not that it felt healthy, but it definitely felt better than half a deep fried chicken had any right to.We had the Sweet Potato donuts for dessert. Dunkin Donuts sized munchkins with sweet potato filling, crusted in brown sugar, and served with fresh homemade vanilla whipped cream? Yes, sir, I would like some more. A little bit chewier than I would have thought, but definitely a delicious end to the meal. The vanilla whipped cream was so good we kept the cup after the donut plate was taken away.If you're looking for a lively environment and some great food, Definitely try this place.",0,0,0,Eric C.,"Manhattan, NY",46,32,0
3.0,9/19/2013,"3- 3.5 stars.  Been wanting to come to Red Rooster for a while given all the hype, and given how hard it is to get a table!!  BF and I had some RR food at the Googa Mooga food festy; some banging roasted chicken and mac and cheese. I have to say, the food I had there was better than what I had for full on dinner on a Thursday night.  We had a rez for 4 at 6:30 which took a while to get- thanks to public tranpo- I was 30 min late but fortunately, there was not much of a wait on the waitlist that we got to sit outdoors at 7pm anyway.  Seems like most of their seating is outdoors!  Nice to eat outside, but if you prefer views of the swanky bar, inside is better. As for the food- they change up their menu quite a bit (and they were walking around with passed appetizers not on the menu- like duck confit and whatnot which looked...okay.. just a strange concept to pass stuff around), but we shared the market salad (WAY too salty, but good and nutty- greens, onions...whatever's seasonal), the house pickles.. eh.  i've had better. It was almost too soggy and vinegar but perhaps it's because I mostly had okra and carrots.    The other couple we dined with had the goat app, which I think they enjoyed.  For mains, bf and I split a side of cornbread, which was really good (though could have been better if it came up in a skillet :D), loved both sides of the whipped butter and tomato jam.  The bread was warm, and the right mix of sweet and savory.   I got the famous fried yard bird, which was a huge potion that Big Eater Me couldn't even finish.  Love the dark meat as it made it so juicy, and plump.  I also appreciated the fact that it was not overly fried and too greasy, so they probably used the right frying temperature.  But the chicken itself was not fried with a ton of seasoning- they gave me some paprika (?) stuff to sprinkle on which didn't really make an impact.  The side of gravy and mashed potatoes were just ok.. really not chunky, or creamy, or anything remarkable. Bf had the jerk chicken which was plump piece of half chicken - very juicy and actually much more flavorful than my own chicken!  It was typically jerk chicken- sweet (which I don't like) but was cooked well and melted in your mouth.   The other couple had the fish grits (reportedly VERY good), and the mac and greens (looked ok.. I've seen cheesier mac from them before that has burnt edges around it... yum. That was not this mac. ) It was not super cheesy nor did it have a ton of flavor... it was mild. A side of brussel sprouts were also present on our table- didn't try them but they looked really good; roasted with bacon. It's hard to mess up sprouts though.. so *shrug*. For desert, we had the sweet potato doughnuts which we all said could have been more ""sweet potato-y"" the actual sweet potato, I think, is whipped down to a cream filling, which was nonexistent in some of the doughnuts.  Came with a whipped butter (I think) which was again, ok-standard, didn't add too much to the doughnut. All in all, it added up to some $50 pp which is what you can expect for the city at at top chef place though I'm sure the locals probably find that absurd and we felt we could have made our money's work for us more elsewhere.  We did have drinks- a few draft beers (nothing too crazy),  and cocktails- I had the savoy (not much of a vodka taste..but fruity, which tons of grapes inside), and BF had the Brownstarter (came in a martini glass, had a cherry-bourbon taste).  Service was decent (our server very nice, but they were a bit slow).RR has been up here forever and yes the Obamas come here and yes they don't take reservations easily but personally, I think the novelty has worn off. Sort of the case for Marcus S as it seems because heck does anyone like eating at Aquavit these days?  But honestly, even the dining partners we had said RR's been better as they've come a couple times.  Something was definitely missing.. maybe we had an off night but the food was so standard that I don't know if it will ever warrant a second visit given the hassle of the commute up and the wait system. However: to the patrons who dined with us and may be reading, we loved, loved the company so the night was a happy one. :D",4,0,2,Stephanie Y.,"New York, NY",878,1242,25
2.0,9/17/2013,"I think I was just disappointed because of all the hype over this place. Maybe it used to be better but so not worth going to now. I planned my boyfriend's birthday dinner here because he's been wanting to go and loves southern soul food. Besides the fact that we had 8pm ressies and weren't seated until 9, the food was not that good, especially for the price. He got the yardbird which was decent but you can't really screw up fried chicken. I had the catfish which was insanely small and not even cooked well. Also was supposed to have corn and tomatoes with the black eyed peas but really it was just a tiny soggy piece of fish over a bed of mushy peas. The peach cobbler seemed promising and looked tasty, but seemed to be drenched in some sort of liquor. And that isn't too pleasant when you want a sweet dessert. Not alcohol. The only good things were the cornbread although expensive and our waiter was very nice. Although he led me in the wrong direction with the catfish.

2.0,9/15/2013,"So I'm hanging out in Harlem and after church today we couldn't wait to head to the Red Rooster for brunch, specifically in search of some fried chicken and waffles - boy was I disappointed.  First, they have neither of these items on the regular menu, but they do have them on the buffet downstairs in the Ginny's Supper club.  The buffet featured items such as duck potatoes, deviled eggs, fried chicken, waffles, french toast, chicken apple sausage, meatballs, and a host of salads and desserts.  I consider myself a pancake and waffle connoisseur so I couldn't wait to taste the waffles.  Basically, everything on the buffet line was ice cold.  Sausage - cold, waffle and french toast - cold AND hard, potatoes - cold.  Notice a trend yet?  The servers were very nice and we told them that everything was cold, but not sure what efforts were made to improve it.  There was a nice little teen gospel show during brunch, which is the only thing I truly enjoyed.  So all in all, for $50 per person, I would NOT recommend this place for the brunch,",0,0,0,F D.,"Chicago, IL",6,52,30

People complain about prices but the cost is in line with a fine dining establishment offering a great ambiance with a fresh take on all that makes Harlem so cool (scene, fashion, jazz...)Service was average -- waiter seemed bothered to serve us. My cocktail was not to my liking (way too sweet) so I ordered another and was charged for both. No smiles or pleasantries or attentiveness.

I went with some friends on a Sunday for brunch and without a reservation we were seated relatively quickly after being able to sit for drinks at the bar. I'll give this place star points for the setting and ambiance: it's pretty trendy (bougie) compared to many of the classic Harlem and soul-food inspired restaurants in the immediate neighborhood.I tried the red-eye gravy and biscuits, and my friend ordered the fried yard bird (this restaurant's pièce de résistance). Both were pretty good: the red eye gravy was salty and spicy with cubed bits of crispy pork that went well atop the warm biscuits. The yard bird included well fried chicken and a huge helping of mashed potatoes. We shared a side of cornbread, which was also pretty appetizing (but if any restaurant ever screwed up cornbread it'd have to be the end of it). I doubt I'll ever go again, but I might recommend it to someone visiting the area.

5.0,9/8/2013,"I am a huge fan of Red Rooster and of Marcus Samuelsson. Three of us had dinner there last night at 5 pm, which was the only time I could get a reservation for the entire night! It was a little strange because we were finishing up around 7 pm and there were still plenty of free tables so I'm unclear why we had to take the 5 o'clock time slot. Regardless, we made sure not to eat much before hand so we were starving by 5 anyway.The service was also great all night. They let us take as much time as we needed and they didn't push us to leave even after we had paid the bill. It was a very pleasant, relaxed dining experience.The cocktails were great. I had the Yes, Chef (vodka with berbere spices) and my boyfriend had the Fig Bourbon Negroni...very strong and interesting tastes.The appetizers were incredible: the caribbean bacon was my favorite. It came with a fried egg, the best baked beans I've ever had, and pickled cabbage. The ""bacon"" was more like pork belly than bacon. The only issue I had with the appetizers were that the sizes were HUGE. Next time I go back to Red Rooster I will probably get two appetizers rather than an appetizer and an entree because it was a ton of food.The entrees were excellent also: we had the jerk chicken, Helga's meatballs and the Rooster noodles, which was a very unusual dish: ramen noodles in broth with pork belly, crab and massive shrimp with the heads on. We shared the peach ginger cobbler for desert and it was fantastic and they put a candle in for my boyfriend's birthday.

2.0,9/4/2013,"When the New York Times reviewed the newly opened Red Rooster in March, 2011, Sam Sifton praised it as a melting pot. ""It is that rarest of cultural enterprises, one that supports not just the idea or promise of diversity, but diversity itself."" He called the food ""good."" Sadly, both qualities have declined over time in inverse proportion to chef/owner Marcus Samuelsson's fame. His successful autobiography, ""Yes, Chef"" has served as a magnet for visitors, and perhaps distracted him from quality control. Certainly, the front of house is in trouble, from the surly and disorganized hostesses to the near-incompetent serving staff. Only the bartenders seem immune to the negative spirit evidenced by everyone else visible to customers. I've eaten at the Red Rooster numerous times and the standards seem to slip with every visit. From the most glorious Thanksgiving dinner I ever had to barely edible is a long fall in less than two years. On my most recent visit, the dishes veered from over spiced and salted (the fried chicken appetizer) to flavorless (the ginger peach cobbler). The pimento cheeseburger was fine, but I kept gazing longingly at the Harlem Shake down the street, where a whole meal costs as much as a single dish at the Red Rooster.Once Harlem residents were core patrons, but now the Red Rooster is crowded with tourists, perhaps seeking the lost diversity or a glimpse of Marcus. There's no excuse to treat them - and us - with impatience and sometimes incompetence. Just getting seated is a ordeal. Is the patio reservable, or first come, first served? Depends on who you ask. And if you dutifully reserve, then others are seated in your stead.The other night we received the wrong food and the wrong bill. We were refused refills on iced tea. Water glasses remained empty and a runner wandered around with our dessert trying to find its rightful destination.Marcus may have a license to print money, but it sure isn't fun to be sucked into it and spit out the other end.",4,2,0,Irene S.,"New York, NY",14,79,26

My sister and boyfriend ordered the crab cakes that were extremely salty. They did not want to return them so they ate what they could.  I ordered a shrimp salad that was just ok. For entree I ordered steak and frittes which was pretty good. For entree, my sister and boyfriend ordered the blackened catfish which was extremely salty also. This time they said something and the waiter himself said he gave it a taste and it was salty but they couldn't do anything about it because it was premade. So they opted for something else they really didn't want. They tried to make it better by giving us 2 appetizers for free but unfortunately they were not good either.

The chili cucumbers were refreshing and tasty, but not quite as much kick as I was hoping for. The highlight was, for sure, the deviled eggs. I don't know what the hell chicken skin mayonnaise is, but it is a fugginthunderboltmiracle. Entrees were the meatballs (very good braised cabbage and mashed potatoes, I'm not really a meatball fan, generally, but these were a good example) and the jerk chicken (the jerk flavors weren't as popping as what you'd get in Flatbush, but the meat was moist and delicious). Then we had the ginger peach cobbler for dessert, which was a fine, noble dessert. Service was friendly and knowledgeable, all in all it was a damn fine meal.HOWEVER. And this is a big goddamn however. Their service was *fast*. As in *rushed*. Reservation was at 7. We had appetizers by 7:10 and entrees before 7:30. We took our time eating, trying to enjoy ourselves or whatnot, but by 8:00 we were finishing dessert and wrapping up. I got up to use the restroom at 8:10 or so, and by the time I got back to the table, the staff was MOVING MY WIFE to a tiny table in a corner because they needed our table for incoming customers. Literally all they had to do was wait for me to take a whiz and we would have asked for the check. In fact, when I got back to the weird dunce table they stuck us in, the only thing I did was flag down our waiter and ask for the check. For realz.If they needed to get a party in to our spot, if it was so important that they had to move customers that were sitting in front of empty plates, that means they were running that party late. Which means they'd booked them for 8. After booking us at 7.Now, I don't know what kind of economic pressures this place is under, but I'm pretty goddamn sure that if you're the type of place that's charging nearly 30 dollars a plate, you shouldn't also be the type of place that's flipping tables every hour.",3,5,0,Daniel D.,"South Orange, NJ",1,15,0

2.0,8/29/2013,"My friends and I were so excited to try Red Rooster and heard about all the hype but when it came down to the food, it was mediocre at best. We ordered the chicken and waffles with bourbon syrup and deviled eggs for our appetizers and I must say the syrup was disgusting. It seriously tasted like they poured bourbon on my waffles. The fried chicken was alright but quite tasteless. The deviled eggs were nothing special.We also ordered 2 plates of the Fried Yard Bird, one plate of shrimp and grits and the Blackened catfish for our entrees. Let's start off with the yard bird; the chicken was still yet again tasteless but it was too late to change the order. The mashed potatoes with gravy were decent but the sauce that came with the chicken tasted like watered down buffalo sauce. For ~$30 a plate, i expected much better tasting fried chicken.The Shrimp and grits was the best out of all 3 entrees and was decently flavored with plenty of shrimp and the grits were smooth.The blackened catfish was a tad spicy but way overcooked and dry. The mexican corn side dish was DISGUSTING! It was so overpowered with lime that it was pretty much inedible. For $8, you get one piece of corn drenched in lime juice and a large container of lime flavored butter (YUCK!).We were so unimpressed by our meals that we didn't even order dessert. That is pretty sad considering we always order dessert when we go out.All in all, we will never be back.

4.0,8/27/2013,"There are some definite LOVES:- fried chicken- shrimp and grits (I could've licked the grits off the plate -- so creamy and buttery)- Caribbean bacon (fatty and crisp)- brown beans (deserves it own line, it was so good)- corn bread (buttery, flavorful, needed 2 orders)- collard greens (salty, tangy, just the way it needed to be)Not-so-loved:- in general some of the sides like the waffles came out cold. Not sure if it was a one-night only thing but it almost dropped the 4th star.- sweet potato doughnuts were too heavy. Not light and airy like I like my doughnuts to be.

2.0,8/26/2013,"I expected a lot more from this place.  So hyped, I think that it was average and that the soul of this restaurant that was meant to revitalize Harlem is lack luster.  This is my vision of what I would build if I wanted to get other ethnicity's uptown and put on a show of ""Harlem"".  Living here I find this a little offensive.  Thought the bartenders were messy and need to realize that everyone can see what you are doing at all times.  So if you stick your hand down your pants to tuck your shirt in you should at least wash them.  They we also eating and drinking in the middle of there shift.  One of them actually poured her green tea from a Starbucks cup into a rocks glass, then over the ice bin filled it with ice and it overflowed into the ice bin for customers.  She seemed unconcerned about the episode.",0,0,0,Micheal M.,"New York, NY",0,18,0
5.0,8/22/2013,"I worried that after all the hype and how much I had heard about Red Rooster that it wouldn't quite live up to everything, but it more than exceeded my high expectations. The restaurant and outdoor seating area are like an oasis - there is great music and friendly people to greet you. The space inside is cleverly laid out, with a large figure 8 bar, a glass shelf partition, and the dining area behind. Also, somehow everyone who comes here is beautiful and well dressed, just a side note!My friend and I arrived early for our 7pm reservation so we got a few drinks at the bar. The bartenders carefully and expertly prepare each cocktail - I haven't seen a drink so meticulously and lovingly prepared in a long time! I opted for the house wine, which was surprisingly good. Once seated, our cheerful and friendly waitress told us the specials; unfortunately my friend and I had been very focused on the menu all day and had already made up our minds about what to order.We started with the cornbread: moist with a delicate crumb and actual kernels of corn. The honey butter and tomato jam were wonderful complements. We each had an appetizer of the chicken and waffles. I am no fried chicken connoisseur, but this is by far the best I have ever had: the breading is thick and crunchy and the chicken moist and tender. The waffles are light and fluffy and accompanied by a boozy bourbon maple syrup. We were also brought a poached oyster crostini and cucumber salad, compliments of the chef. For our entree we had the mac and greens. The mac and cheese part of the dish is a symphony of orchiette suspended in the most delicious, silky, sharp cheese sauce. I was in heaven. And even though I am not the hugest salad girl, I absolutely loved the mixed greens and vinaigrette the accompanied the mac and cheese. We could not manage dessert, so in the future I will remember to save room.Between the ambiance, service, food, AND a Marcus Samuelsson sighting, it was a wonderful night and one of the best meals I have had in a long time.

4.0,8/19/2013,"Harlemites are full of style and swag... Red rooster is a direct reflection of that. I have been here a few times before but today, I really wanted to take note of my entire experience. I went for dinner with a friend and we were both incredibly happy with our experience. The food: We shared a Red Ceasar Salad with Yardbird (Rooster talk for chicken) the Blackened Catfish. I would rate the Salad a 9/10 and the Catfish a 6/10. The chicken is fried so that obviously swagged out the salad and yet nothing was greasy and the dressing was light and perfect. The only reason I don't rate it a 10/10 is because I'd like to save that for something that blows me all the way away. The catfish was really good but I have had better catfish so its nothing i would tell my friends to go try. On a totally different occasion, I had the burger here and I really liked it because it was hearty and the bread was toasted...mmmm..mm. I'd rate that a 7/10 only because I recently had an UMAMI burger and my palate now requires ridiculous things out of a burger. The ambiance: It is gorgeous!!!! The pictures are beautiful, the lighting, the colors...everything is comfortable, cohesive and tells a story. The service: The staff is not only nice but super helpful and friendly. We didn't know what porkbelly was and one of the waiters (who wasn't even serving our table) stopped to explain exactly what it was and how it tasted.

The decor and the layout are both truly amazing and welcoming. The bar is really neat and the bartenders are pretty swanky. The atmosphere is spectacular, and while most people are fashionably dressed, it has a truly relaxed, happy, and fun feel.The staff was excellent. Our waiter was great, and the host at the door was quite charming. I mean, complimenting my tie will always win me over, but I really liked the staff regardless.My party shared the crab cakes, corn bread, and fried green tomatoes.

It is like when you are in love and nothing around you matters but that person. Red rooster has that effect. It cuts out the clutter of the Harlem jungle/ 125th st mess.  (Junkies, Hair braiders, Crazies, Beggers, etc. ) HOW TO BEHAVE:It is the ultimate Brunch spot in all of Uptown Manhattan. Do not miss it! Look posh-casual  in your Sunday getup because you may spot and chat up a celebrity. As I did both times. Marcus Samuelson and Tatiana Ali of Fresh Prince of Bel Air. Cultured tourist with manners! Lots of tourists here from Europe, and other American cities who are so friendly and sweet!FOOD :The food is divine. I enjoyed the cornbread with tomato spread and honey butter. Which I will say was not a great pairing as  the bread is very absorbent and the flavor gets lost in the bread. I had french toast. The first bite I felt like my body was going to float like a balloon into the heavens. Never had such transcendental culinary experience in one bite. Eggs with cheese. No Bueno ! The eggs were too much. It tasted like cheap supermarket eggs. The portions were too much as well. BAR:We never brought anything from the bar. My love enjoyed some type of fruit beer which was brought with a beer glass. There is a band singing there. Which is good, but  I don't like how the pressure you for tips. My sweetie tipped them generously but I would have not. WAITER:Expect some runway model sexy waiters. We were fortunate to get a real hottie.

They have tons of square footage and the tables aren't right on top of each other. The service was impeccable. Our waiter was attentive without being annoying. My friend and I split a pitcher of the Yes Chef cocktail - it was refreshing and well made. We started with the cornbread (moist, delicious, great spreads) and the fried green tomatoes (light breading, plated with a small wedge salad). Both were fantastic. We went with the yardbird for an entree. It was perfectly cooked, the coating was light, crispy and flavorful. A shaker of spices & a side of hot sauce came with the chicken, which only made it better. For dessert, my friend got the sweet potato donuts, at the recommendation of our server. They were unique and delicious.   Overall, this place wins for great ambiance and excellent execution all around.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is the price tag. In the land of soul food, this is for sure the pricier fancied up version. Think of this as the classically trained cousin of Amy Ruth's; equally delicious in a less traditional way, more expensive, but worth it. It'll definitely be a go-to spot when out-of-towners visit.

I tasted everything that my table ordered - so here's my review:Cornbread, which came with honey butter and a tomato spread - cornbread was coated with butter, it was good but definitely did not need to be coated with butter before being served. Both spreads were good.Salad with goat pate and pecans and some other stuff - excellent! Dressing was great.Pulled pork sandwich with blue cheese slaw - excellentmeatballs with mash potatoes - the meatballs were great. Came with some cabbage, and some red (pomegranate sauce) which was also good. Mashed potatoes were pretty standard.Chicken sandwich in Cajun mayo, which came on a biscuit  -  Biscuit was good and it was a very creative way to service chicken salad. The chicken salad however was awful. There were huge pieces of bones in it and very little chicken - all mayo. It was inedible. The whole thing sat in front of me uneaten. Management must have noticed b/c the manager (I assume she was) came over and asked as to why I wasn't eating it. She offered to bring me something else (which I declined at that point b/c I had shared with everyone else and was not longer hungry) and she took the item off my bill. I have never had anyone notice when I didn't eat the food at a restaurant like that and offer to take it off my bill - so while I would have preferred that the dish was actually good, I at least appreciated that. Red velvet cupcake with ice cream - this was the dessert for the price fixed meal (it was restaurant week). The serving itself was tiny. The ice cream was good, and it had some cookie crumble on it. The cupcake however was stale.The prices were really expensive for what it was. In sum, some good, some bad - great service.

4.0,7/24/2013,"We went on a Monday, and the vibe of the restaurant was great -- FOR US.  On Mondays, it's a bit different experience, though... the bar is a Harlem hotspot.  Live music and a JAM PACKED bar... The band was playing jazzy covers of R&B and Hip-Hop songs.  Personally, I loved it. My head was bobbing the entire meal to the band... And, as a special unadvertised feature, a Caucasian couple we're doing a swing/ two step to the band all night.

It came with honey butter and tomato jam, the latter of which I thought was a strange pairing for something so sweet.For entrees, I shared the Fish & Grits and the famed Yard Bird* with my sister.

I really thought at least the dessert would be something that we could end on a good note with, but it was just terrible!

We were two people eating and they automatically added 18.5% without indicating this on their menu or verbally conveying it to us. The same happened to a Swedish group of three (3), next to us.  When they asked the server about the automatically added gratuity she told them that it was customary. When our tab came around and seeing the same scheme being applied one more time, I asked another server to bring this to the attention of the manager. He came back and told us that it was a mistake. Given the fact that it happened more than once it seems to more of a rule than a fluke. Service in general was pretty mediocre. ""Our"" server disappeared after taking our order.

I ordered the jerk chicken, and lets me just say this...it was not jerk chicken in any way. It was more like bake chicken. For a appetizer I ordered the shrimp and dirty rice. And ill say the shrimp was great....but the rice was bland, and hard. I've tasted more flavor from liptons box rice. Now for the service...

2.0,7/9/2013,"OK, so I'd heard great things about this place and loved the look of it, as I'd walk by at least once a week. I decided to take the mom out for a pre-birthday dinner and this was our place of choice.Immediately we were welcomed with warmth at the entrance as we had the option of sitting inside or out. We opted for inside as it was blazing hot out. Since we didn't have a reservation, we were offered a private table for two with no wait. The decor was funky as we expected, but still felt homey. Our server offered many suggestions, and we eventually went with the crab cakes and dirty rice for mom, and the chicken and waffles with cornbread for me. My chicken had a unique flavor, but was COLD. I don't like scalding hot food and this wasn't warm, but so cold. I was so disappointed because it had potential to be great. My waffles were even worse as they were tough. The syrup was runny and VERY BOOZY.  Might enjoy if you're into eating your liquor and getting drunk in 5 minutes. Mom's dirty rice started out OK, before she was attacked by salt. After three bites, she said it wasn't edible. Thankfully we had a darling server, and he replaced that with some grits & shrimp. Mom enjoyed the cheesiness of those a lot more and was satisfied. Her crab cakes were a different story though. They were definitely panko-y crispy on the outside, which was nice. But the flavor was very meh. Mom thought it was full of breading, but I was convinced they used canned salmon as a binder. We really didn't enjoy our meals. The overall experience was OK, hence the two stars. The live music and vibrancy of the place almost made up for the fact that the food was so wack. Plus I loved the service, as even those who weren't directly serving us would constantly check on us and refill our glasses. The chef even came out to visit as we were deciding on what to order.

4.0,7/2/2013,"From the moment we walked in I was excited. I'd heard great things about this place from foodie friends downtown and local friends who frequent the bar for appetizers. I was pleasantly surprised by the decor; it almost felt like I was at a friend's house who happens to have really cool art and comfy chic taste. The bar area has a nice amount of seating and the center round design encourages patrons to gather around instead of making a long line down the bar. The cocktail list was nice - it had a nice array of base liquor choices with some funky mixology spins. I had the Earl of Harlem which was nice, but nothing too special. The hostesses were really lovely; personable and knowledgable. We sat down knowing we wanted to try as much as possible so after a quick review with our server we set the ball rolling with corn bread, oysters rockefeller & caribbean bacon. The corn bread was nice and moist, the oysters were really delicious set atop a small bit of creamed spinach & hollandaise, a lot of flavour and very fresh tasting. The caribbean bacon was awesome; tender and plated with kraut of some sort, amazing beans with shredded pork and an egg sunny side up. The trick of this dish is you have to eat all the components together, don't pick each part on it's own, everything really complimented each other. It was my favourite of everything we tried. While we were taking a breather between courses the band kicked off by the bar area. The vibe of the restaurant totally changed. The music was brilliant exhibiting a little bit of everything from funky jazz to tailored covers. A really nice addition to the already great atmosphere. Main courses were jerk chicken which was good, rooster noodles and a side of shrimp grits. The noodles were the only thing I didn't love. It lacked something for me and I can't put my finger on it but the texture of the noodles wasn't the best and the broth needed a little more of a kick. There were a lot of pieces to the soup and maybe a little too much in the end. The shrimp grits were the best grits I've ever had!! Out of this world. Superbly filling but worth fasting the next day for! The service was fantastic from hostesses to server to back-server. Ambiance was lively and comfortable. I would recommend highly & can't wait to go back again.",2,0,0,Devon P.,"New York, NY",9,42,12
2.0,7/1/2013,"My husband & I were big supporters of Marcus Samuelsson when he was on The Next Iron Chef & he is one of our favorite judges on Chopped.  We went to the NYPL when he spoke about & read from ""Yes, Chef"" where he signed my copy.My husband enjoyed his griddled salmon & gazpacho & I enjoyed my taste of it.  We also enjoyed the mashed potatoes (my husband is from Dublin & he is hardcore about how potatoes should be cooked).However, I'm sad to say that my food was pretty disappointing.  We sat near the kitchen & were able to see what food was ready to go.  We shared the red caesar & knew that ours had been sitting at the counter for awhile.  I guess the romaine was soggy because it had been grilled & sat for awhile.  We found the bottom piece of a romaine heart which was supposed to be discarded in our salad.The crab cakes were like the salad; they were nothing special.  Their texture wasn't right & they were a bit too bready & not crabby enough which I find the issue with most crab cakes.  They were slightly dry so we had to ask for lemon to make the crab cakes a bit better.The Rooster Noodles were good in theory, but not executed well.  First, my dish was sitting for awhile so it didn't come hot.  I think ramen should come hot.  I saw three bowls of Rooster Noodles being served right away & they looked piping hot.  I was a little jealous of that.The noodles are described as ""pork belly, crab, head on shrimp, teff ramen.""  The head on shrimp were delicious.  There was one very tiny piece of pork in it and no crab at all.  There were pork chicharon in the dish that were partially burnt (totally black & ashy at the top center of them).  Is that supposed to be the pork belly?  Either the broth seemed to be missing flavor or I came with expectations that were too high? Probably both.The table was also very sticky.  We sat at a communal table & I touched the parts of the table next to where we were sitting & the table was sticky at that portion as well.Although our food didn't come out right away, the staff was very friendly.  The bartenders were very cool & we enjoyed the ""Yes, Chef"" cocktail.  The cocktail could use a little more Wodka though.If we ever decide to venture up to Harlem again, I am not sure we would go.  If we do, I should probably try the chicken & waffle or the yard bird because the kitchen seemed to lashing out a lot of orders of these.In the end, we still like Marcus Samuelsson, but we're not sure about Red Rooster.",38,30,33,Jennie A.,"Brooklyn, NY",96,138,76

5.0,6/24/2013,"Took my mother here for a special dinner since we do not get to see each other often (5/23)...My mother has a very basic palate and hates trying new foods. She wanted to eat at a 'soul food' restaurant and I was already groaning inwardly...I was raised in Harlem and grew up eating at a bunch of soul food places, and the food is dull, unimaginative and uninspired for the most part. Nothing that your grandmother can't do better, 100% of the time...plus I've been a vegetarian for 5 1/2 years, so soul food is usually a pass...However, I've heard of RR and felt like it could be an unspoken compromise with my mother, so off we went...as we went in, my mother whispered, 'I have heard it's hard to get a table here without a reservation...' We asked for a table for two and the host said she could only accommodate us at a bar high top...um not acceptable as my mom is nearly 60. Then she said, 'Well I can also accommodate you at a very small table in the corner over there...' This was her exact wording. Note to host staff, if you are offering guests a table, use wording that doesn't make the offering sound inferior, even if it is. Even though the table was in the corner, I've dined at restaurants in Manhattan with considerably smaller, more uncomfortable tables...it really wasn't that bad, but treatment left a bit of a bad taste.Server greeted us promptly and courteously. I know we didn't have a reservation and weren't dressed to the nines but I know my food and have dined in a lot of fine establishments, and I appreciate good service. Tried a tequila based cocktail, two different kinds of bitters were in the ingredients list and I was concerned because of the often heavy medicinal quality of bitters but it wasn't off putting. I also tried a glass of the pinot noir. We ordered: cornbread, fried green tomatoes, and wings as starters, mom had the steak for her main, I had the mac n greens with sides of the mushrooms and asparagus to share. Cornbread looked odd to me, but it tasted very good and the honey butter was delish. Fried green tomatoes were the best fried green tomatoes I've ever tasted. I ordered it with no bacon, of course, but the batter was very flavorful and the tomatoes were fresh and firm. My only critique was that the tomatoes were sliced a tad too thick. Obviously I didn't taste the wings but mom said they were very tasty, and although she claims she hates yogurt she found the yogurt dipping sauce equally tasty.Onto our mains...I was on the fence about ordering the mac to be honest, I was kinda disappointed that this was the only veg option as I like to eat vegetables and not a bowl of dairy. Also mac and cheese even when good can be a monotonous, heavy dish. Boy was I wrong about this one, there were herbs, greens, peppers, every bite was really intriguing...it even tasted great when I brought it home and ate it cold later. The side salad was a refreshing counterpoint as well. It was a béchamel based sort of mac and cheese which isn't traditional like your grandma's baked mac n cheese, but both can taste good if executed properly. The side of asparagus was very good and the mushrooms were EXCEPTIONAL. I really enjoyed the addition of fresh herbs. I must caution that all this food contained a generous amount of salt, so if you are salt averse I would be wary. I was just glad I didn't have to use my shaker, which just about never happens. Most importantly my mother who complains about everything was happy and satisfied.The manager Don stopped by our table and greeted us warmly.Happy that RR is in here, adding a bright spot to the bleakness that is 'soul food' in Harlem.",4,0,0,Candice W.,"ASTORIA, NY",229,47,7

The service was excellent and the server's recommendation of an iced cappuccino was on the spot. The food was OK, the pulled pork sandwich had an unnecessary amount of blu cheese and the bbq sauce was over spiced and mild. The side salad was a nice addition. The fries were awful and reminded me of grade school cafeteria fries with old parm cheese on them...The French toast excellent and had a nice accompaniment of syrup and jams.

This was by far, hands down, one of the top ten meals I've had in New York. The Rooster's ambiance and space was great - live jazz in the front room, a huge dining room and open kitchen. Our service was amazing - our waiter really took care of us. The food at the Red Rooster is pure comfort food!  The menu has something for everyone and hints of all of Samuelsson's influences - Swedish and Scandinavian with Caribbean and African touches with influences from the south and soul food. For dinner, we tried a variety of appetizers and entrees. The standouts were the following: - Dirty rice and shrimp - Caribbean bacon and egg - Mac & Greens - Gouda, NY Cheddar, Comté, Collard GreensHelga's Meatballs - Lingonberries, Braised Green Cabbage, Dill Potatoes (A must have!

2.0,6/15/2013,"I went here today for a celebration with my husband. We are a fan of the chef from watching Food network but have never actually tasted his food so were excited to go to his restaurant. First, the wait time for the table was really short, we went for an early dinner so the place was full but not packed. We requested a table inside and was placed at a table near the back, when we requested a change of table the hostess got all snotty saying she wasn't sure if the other tables were reserved and would check to let us know. Needless to say she never returned and we ended up getting up and moving to another table ourselves.Second, the food....mediocre at best, i've made better with left overs.We had the fried yard bird and jerk chicken with cornbread appetizer. The jerk chicken would have been edible if it wasn't bloody (who eats or serves bloody chicken). We had to have a new plate and even then it was closer to rare on chicken than I would like. On the other hand the fried yard bird was too over cooked (or actually over fired), very very dry...no wonder they had to cover it with gravy. The mash potato was alright, the mashed yucca okay as well. The cornbread probably was the best item we got! The atmosphere wasn't bad and when I went to the bathroom it was clean. Needless to say, out meal came to close to $100.00 including drinks. So would I return...Hell no!....waste of money, it is too damn expensive for the mediocrity created.

The staff was friendly, young, and energetic. The food was superb, plentiful, and fairly priced for the most part. And the atmosphere is very cool, laid back, and casual.I came here for lunch on a day off and made the trek out to Harlem from where I live much further downtown. Red Rooster definitely is a wonderful addition to Harlem, which is slowly but surely becoming nicer and more gentrified. I was seated right by the open kitchen, over looking the chefs hard at work. I was amazed at how they were running the operation like a well oiled machine. The head chef was there (not Marcus Samuellson) making sure every dish was plated to perfection.Here was the order, and yes it was ALOT of food. But it was my only meal of the day so I decided to splurge.StartersCornbread with honey butter and tomato jam- Holy crap!!! Absolutely the most buttery, best, delicious cornbread I have ever eaten. At $4, this may be the best bite in the city pound for pound. 2 thick slabs of what is essentially cornbread in pound cake form, studded with whole corn kernels and a perfect balance of sweet n salty. Slather that baby with honey butter and just close your eyes as you are taken to heaven. I didn't think I would like the tomato jam, but it actually worked well. But trust me. The honey butter is where its at. A MUST order. Caution: You don't realize how rich and buttery it is until you scarf down the first slice and you start to immediately feel kinda full. Top 10 plate of 2013 so far.Fried green tomatoes over iceberg lettuce, bacon pieces, blue cheese dressing. This was something I was curious about as I hadn't had fried green tomatoes many times in my life. Three large tomatoes were nicely battered, fried well, and dusted with a cajun spice. They tomatoes themselves were good, but the lettuce they sat on was bereft of dressing. Need some more blue cheese for this dish. Overall, good but I would have passed on this to save more stomach space in the future.Main course was the reason I have wanted to come here for years.The fried yard bird and white mace gravy, with buttermilk mashed potatoes, pickles, chili dipping sauce. OMG! I don't know what kind of chickens they are using here but they are on some serious steroids. I got the largest chicken thigh and leg I have ever seen in my life!!! They were huge and the 2 pieces they give you equate to 4 pieces anywhere else. Seriously. The batter on these was how I like. Rather thick, exceptionally crispy, and contained some different spices- definitely cumin, maybe cinnamon, and some chile powder. I have to say though, the gravy was a bit overpowering for me. Thankfully, they didnt put too much on, but the spice they put in there is strong. Honey is a better topping. They also give you a spice can on the size to add more. The meat itself was so juicy, piping hot, perfectly cooked and I loved every bite of it. The mashed potatoes were good, but a sprinkle of the spices they gave me made them even better. The sauce they give you on the side is very spicy, and in my opinion unneeded. Some of the best fried chicken I've ever had though here definitely.And to add more calories- A side of mac and greens. It was orecchiette pasta loaded with many cheeses and some collard greens were mixed in. Superb, superb, superb. Rich as hell but awesome.The meal was incredible. But please do yourself a favor before coming here. Go on a juice cleanse, come hungry, and know that you will have to wheel yourself outta that baby!The only negative is that for those of us who live downtown its so far away.

2.0,6/1/2013,"There is a massive dichotomy between the five star service and the one-star food.This place would have gotten a 3 & 1/2 stars if it was based on the initial hour of our dining.  We were able to get a seat for 4 without reservations on a busy Saturday at opening, with great hosts and service. The appetizers (dirty rice w shrimp, oyster, shrimp & grits, etc)  were fine, though flavors of the dirty rice failed to really meld together for the most part and it was simply a taste bland rice with a nice piece of shrimp.  The (Obama-tini) was excellent with a mix of fruitier flavors and a dashing kick of spice.  Unfortunately, it was just downhill after that.The main courses were admissible.  I shared the ""special"" New York Steak for Two - with a churri sauce, short-rib sides, asparagus, and fries.  Save your money and avoid this ~$90 monstrosity of a dish.  Ordered medium rare, the steak did come out as ordered, but the steak was sliced  probably before it was allowed to sit.  Juices had run out, drying the meat, and caused the steak to cool too fast.  The sauce was literally flavorless.  The cut of the meat, unfortunately for us, must have been an older cow. Worst of all, the silver skin was not removed.  This equates to a something that was REALLY tough to chew.  The side of short-ribs, was really blended beef short rib meat, made adhesively into a meat ball with BBQ sauce, and then deep fried/oven-ed.  What a waste.  The beefy marinated flavors were lost in sweet sauce and oil. I don't want to say anymore about this failed fried ball of sloppy joe.Finally, I think the chef/cook who handled this order over-compensated the lack of flavor on the steak, by dowsing plain table salt ALL over the fries (more salt than fries).  Everyone at the table agreed about the dichotomy of the steak and sides.  This was one ""special"" that should have never made the menu.Furthermore, a friend had ordered a Mac and Cheese and it was runny/soupy for something that had been in the oven (think wet casserole ugh).  The butter and cheese looked like a failed emulsion of oil and water. Typically, before I review anyplace, I give them two tries (for prosperity and consistency). But this is one place I wont want to try again without some changes from Chef Samuelson.  I wanted to like this place, and the caliber expected was not uncalled for, especially with such a price tag.  Let us not forget, we are talking about ""soul food"" none-the-less.In short, the service was superb!.  Food was mostly terrible garbage.  The price was definitely UNFAIR for the quality.

Morimoto is the only Iron Chef that matters!).Tour buses have been dropping loads of tourists in Harlem every weekend of late.  A bus goes to Sylvia's.  Another goes to Londel's.  It's a weird, particularly white scene at these spots.We came to Red Rooster early (~11:30a) to beat the crowd, nabbed outdoor seats on the nicest day to hit NYC all spring and sipped on creamy lattes while listening to a soulful lady croon jazz table to table.An order of $4 cornbread with bits of yellow corn was served with whipped butter and tomato jam.  The cornbread was on the dry side, and benefited from a heavy pour of tomato sauce across the top.  I'd skip this though - Amy Ruth's cornbread is much tastier and complimentary !An order of the Yard Bird was quite a looker of a plate with two pieces of dark meat, mashed potatoes and housemade hot sauce.  The skin was one of the prettiest shades of crimson I'd ever seen - completely speckled with spices like cumin and paprika.The chicken, brined in buttermilk, was juicy, the skin thin, crisp and spiced with the flavors of the Middle East.  The unique take on fried chicken was fun, and coupled with the lady crooner (singing Old McDonald to a two year old for everyone to hear), and the warm spring day, it was a nice little brunch.  That hot sauce is some good stuff.The scene is lively, the outdoor seating clutch for people watching along Lenox, but I'm still a little unconvinced on the food for now !",3,1,1,Han C.,"New York, NY",147,397,80

3.0,5/25/2013,"I came here for my b-day dinner and was relatively disappointed.  I've followed this chef since Top Chef and the food that I had at his restaurant was subpar and didn't meet expectations.Came here with a group of 4 people and we were lucky enough to get a table despite not having reservations at around 7:30pm.  We took a very long time with ordering drinks but the wait staff was extremely polite and helpful.  I would give them 5 stars for service.  They were trained very well and definitely attentive.  Our glasses of water were never half empty.  We had the obama-tini and Radeberger Pilsner.  The obama-tini is good if you like your drinks sweet with a little spicy kick but for the experienced drinkers, it would just overpower your palate.  The beer was alright, it was clean, not very biter, and light, just as described.For appetizers, we had the oysters rockefeller, fried chicken & waffle, dirty rice & shrimp, and steamed buns.  Out of all the appetizers, the best were the oysters.  I was quite surprised when it arrived because it didn't come in a half shell.  The sauce was excellent in balancing the oyster taste.  The fried chicken & waffle was decent, only because the chicken was better than the waffle.  I loved how the chicken was made and seasoned.  I could eat that any day.  The waffle just sucked.  It was very plain and tasteless.  The dirty rice & shrimp to me was just a twist on an Indian/Thai fusion dish.  Presentation was so so and the flavors were bland.  The steamed buns were alright, at least the pork belly was better than the one I had in London.  However, the skin on this pork belly wasn't crispy at all. I was disappointed.For our entrees, we had Lenox Steak for 2, chili lacquered pork chop, and mac & greens.  All of the entrees were disappointing.  The steak had an amazing presentation but the meat was cut too early, meat didn't have time to rest, and was sitting under the heating lamp.  Came out a little dry and chewy.  The pork chop was dry, and that's probably due to the thickness of the pork.  The sauce wasn't flavorful enough.  The mac and greens were so so.  Lets just just say the mac at SoCo is much better!I wouldn't come here again.  I've also heard that this place is a hit or miss.  I wouldn't recommend this place.  If you must come here, just eat the appetizers and forego the main course.  For the amount of time you have to wait to get seated and the hype surrounding this place, it really doesn't meet expectations.We even had a cake and they wouldn't let us eat it there nor even put it in their fridge.  Most upscale restaurants would at least put the cake in the fridge for you and charge you a fee for eating/cutting the cake in the restaurant.

4.0,5/19/2013,"Given the criticism behind the restaurant, namely Eddie Huang in his NYO article, I can't say I disagree with it all. For a restaurant trying to make a positive impact on the community, how can you justify spending $28 for jerk chicken or $17 for a po boy, especially when most of the people along 125th Street can't afford to enjoy the food themselves?Still, I think what Marcus Samuelsson is trying to do here is admirable. In opening a restaurant with Southern, Swedish, and Ethiopian influences and themed nights for each night of the week e.g. Gospel Sunday Brunch, Latin Night Tuesdays, Soul & R&B Fridays, he attempts to bring a bit of art, culture, and diversity to his restaurant-goers. He also hires staff from the local community and hosts events such as free cooking classes for kids.People can argue that it is restaurants/businesses like these that gentrify neighborhoods, but it also draws celebrity-chef-crazed tourists out of their comfort zones, beyond 61st Street, for once. (It's okay to be a minority! Embrace it!) On the flipside, this restaurant allows (upper-class) Harlem residents a taste of fine dining mere blocks away, rather than needing to go all the way downtown.That said, fully aware of the accolades that Samuelsson has collected over the years, I was quite disappointed in the food. No mind-blowing moment, no explosion of flavors, no lives were changed. But our server/bartender was fabulous! We decided to eat our food at the bar, which I highly recommend. Not only did we get to watch her technique, Athena was an absolute doll in answering all our questions about mixology, the restaurant, and the neighborhood. In fact, when we mentioned that the Yardbird was too raw for us at the end (we didn't want her to take it back into the kitchen), she still took the plate and came back with a complimentary sampling of desserts for each of us!! Totally unnecessary since we weren't dissatisfied. (She also explained that the Yardbird is cooked in a brine that keeps the color of the meat, but in actuality, the meat is cooked well -- Good to know!)Irregardless of how ""authentic"" the food is or how much ""value"" I might not get from any future visits here, I would still come back to support the ""Empire of Marcus Samuelsson"" and remind myself that there is more to NYC than SoHo and Greenwich Village. I definitely plan to try out more local spots around here - next up, Spanish Harlem, anyone?3.5 stars for the food, 5 stars for ambiance, 5 stars for service.PS; the restaurant also has a takeout window (called ""The Nook"") for coffees, teas, sandwiches, and pastries by their pastry chef, Deborah RacicotPSS; the Earl of Harlem Cocktail (Alibi Bourbon, Earl Grey Tea, Spiced Coriander Syrup) was INCREDIBLEEEEE",6,2,7,Jess C.,"New York, NY",591,305,582

The fried yard bird was a little dry on the outside but the inside was moist. The spicy tomato sauce that comes with it compliments it well. The mash potatoes are cheesy and creamy delicious. However, this was prob my least favorite dish of all the things we ordered. The jerk chicken was surprisingly moist for a white meat and was pretty flavorful. The yuca mash was borderlining on salty. The pineapple and apple relish was a welcoming contrast to the yuca. The catfish and grits had an awesome sauce; the catfish itself was kinda spicy and borderline too salty - and we had 2 fishbones so be careful! But the grits were awesome.I ordered the rooster punch which resembled a nice sweet sangria but the drink you must must get is the obama-tini - sweet flavorful blend with a nice bam in the end. Will probably come back just to get the obama-tini.The reason why my review is bumped up to a 5 is because of the atmosphere - the live jazz music, the lighting/ambiance, decor and the friendly wait staff - all those make me feel really happy to be in there and is a great set up for special occasions or an awesome night out with friends.

However, as a swedish person living in the US who knows both American cuisine and swedish cuisine very well I can say that the food is a somewhat confusing mix of both and doesn't reach top quality level.

We had Aaron and he is simply the best.  All of the staff was great.  Friendly, knowledgable and accommodating.  Truth be told the food was good not great but the service is some of the best in the city.",0,0,0,Chris G.,"Jersey City, NJ",9,7,0

3.0,4/4/2013,"Marcus Samuelson's Harlem hotspot can be touristy, but I wouldn't consider it a trap.  I stopped in for a drink with a friend after a workout, because what better way to kill a good workout than sipping on a cocktail? Upon the bartender's recommendation, we ordered two Brownstoners; a nutmeg-infused bourbon martini, affably named the ""Harlem Manhattan"" by one of the regulars sitting across from us. These drinks completely ruined our workout... in the best way possible! Because we're obviously health nuts, we split a market greens salad. The pickled beets in the salad paired with the goat cheese and pecan purée was delightful. Goat cheese just makes everything okay. The prices are a little high, but that's to be expected at a popular NYC restaurant. The quality of the food and service were worth the price and the Brownstoner was a great recommendation.

The meatballs definitely had the Swedish influence with a lovely flavor complexity.I also LOVED my drink: the Obama-tini! So spicy-sweet.

Now the bar on the other end- Unless you can snag a chair it's annoying. The bartenders are incredibly inattentive. On multiple occasion I've seen them chatting with other staff, or simply doing busy work, or worse not doing anything while you have been standing there for 15 minute WAITING for a drink.  It's a tiny bar with TWO slow bartenders...Very disappointing.  But hey try the Reisling...Its delicious.

3.0,3/31/2013,"Finally here. Yesterday evening, the hubs and I just happened to be in Harlem (coming from AC) and the hunger pains hit us. Of course, at the top of my bookmarks was Red Rooster. The 2 guys hosting were very attentive and gracious. Thankful they had space in their closet to accommodate our luggage (yeah we showed up with a large carry-on + duffle bag)There was an hour wait for dinner but this was understandably at the height of Saturday evening. The bar area was packed. Great for  people watching. I liked the large decor separating the bar from the dining area.  Decor was fresh and modern, particularly liked the family memorabilia in the bathrooms.On to food. The Fried Yard Bird had a nice crust on top and juicy on the inside. Still it tasted pretty basic, wasn't a standout, certainly not for $28.  I did  enjoy my blackened  Catfish and Grits. Came in small portion but the sauce was everything. Cornbread was indeed unique, sweet/salty and moist accompanied with a great honey butter tomato sauce. Overall, I feel the food did not live up to the name or the price.Despite them having enough servers and help,  our service was lackadaisical. The particular waiter we had that night committed many faux-pas. His breath being one but that's a little too subjective. He  failed to mention any specials going on (overheard them from another table). Our entrees came before our drinks. He also assumed we weren't having dessert (Had to ask for the dessert menu). Not impressed with him but the rest of the waitstaff seemed very efficient.Impression from one night: 4.5 stars for ambiance. Best people watching at a restaurant.3 stars for food.

1.0,3/25/2013,"Red Rooster has always been on my list of up and coming Restaurants in the New York Food Scene that I have wanted to come to especially since Chef Marcus Samuelson has worked so hard to make it a destination worthy of traveling to.  We are a Food consortium  from Baltimore, New Jersey, New York and Long Island. Made reservations three weeks for a group of 10.  We had three birthdays to celebrate and were eagerly wanting to do it over dinner. All that was available was 11pm. We took the reservation but asked if something opened earlier to move us to that time frame. During this last week we were told it was canceled and moved to a waiting list for 8pm. After calling again we were moved back to 11pm and told that the Chef cooks till 1am and that the dinner menu would be available. We arrived as asked and taken downstairs to the supper club. The music was great, but the only menu available was tapas like items that are precooked and microwaved . The waitress was friendly but had so many tables to manage. After several attempts to get clarification on what type of food service was available manager Jeff Ruskaup got involved . He informed us the kitchen closed at 11pm and would try to see if the Chef had anything left over.I want to say that everyone  was very friendly. After assessing the situation we felt that we needed to go. We went down to 116th street to Amy Ruth's and were taken care of immediately. Their overnight menu had hot complete dinner and breakfast entrees all prepared fresh.My concern about Red Rooster is that while it is enjoying tremendous popularity and no lack of clientele, the communication of what and when is available is not known by the staff. As I said the staff were very friendly. If the options were clearly made available we would of planned accordingly. Celebrity Chefs have done a lot for the food world and made great contributions. They have to remember that places with their name and involvement will always reflect on them when communication breaks down and expectations are lost.

For the dessert, the mudpie was accompanied by dollops of chocolate pudding and whiskey-caramelized bananas, a warm contrast to the chilled pie filling.  The bananas were by far the star of this dish.The music, food, atmosphere and service made this an overall great experience.",1,0,0,Velina L.,"New York, NY",283,558,9

4.0,3/8/2013,"""Yay! I'm a fan"" is damn right. Definitely worth the trek uptown, be it for date night, group dinner, drinks, or just a change of scene. I look forward to creating an excuse to return in the very near future.Our group of six went on a Tuesday night, boldly without a reservation, and only waited about 15 minutes to be seated. Risky business and I wouldn't tempt fate again because the place stayed consistently packed all night long. On a Tuesday.Food:Since we were a group we made the judicious decision to order entrees and apps for the table. Cohesive teamwork and problem solving at its finest. How else to enjoy everything?*Jerk chicken was my personal favorite, and guessing everyone else's favorite since it was polished off first. Generous chicken breast, very juicy and tender, flavorful, sweet, and tangy jerk sauce. Not understated, not overstated.*Helga's meatballs were also delicious and would've made for a prime entree for one, but in a group setting they were more plate dressing. When I return I think this would be my entree of choice. At least coin flip with the Jerk Chicken.*I'm not much of pork person, unless it's pulled and in sandwich form, but this pork loin was particularly soft and succulent. And what loins on this pig! Very thick and went around the table for a few extra servings. Nice apple glaze to it because what is a pork loin without an apple garnishing of some kind? Actually, maybe, possibly could have used some more glaze. Really surprised with how tender this cut was.*Fried chicken was a generous serving. Two legs per plate. Like the jerk chicken, the meat was especially tender, practically dripping from the bone. The skin was fried to hell, in a good way, at first. Really had that overpowering fry/salty/sodium overload by the end.For apps:*My choice was the parmesan fries and they weren't anything special. Standard shoestring fries, tossed in parmesan cheese. I'd hit reset on that order if I could.*Crab cakes were quite tasty with generous portions. And I don't even like crab cakes.*I stayed away from the shrimp salad and deviled eggs only because I was saving room and I'm not an egg fan. Presentation was nice. Shrimp were of the popcorn variety.*The corn bread was also good, but tough to not have good cornbread. Honey Butter, mmm. It was also kind of foisted upon us. Drinks:*A pretty diverse cocktail menu. The Uptown Sour was a bit heavy on the sour mix.*The Obama-tini was the hit of the night. Some interesting flavors and some serious kick courtesy of the pepper flakes. I could see Barry and Michelle enjoying these on a night free of the kids, the dog, and Cantor.*Beers looked grossly overpriced...Dessert:*Maybe you didn't see the damage we did in the first few courses. Next time, sweet potato beignets, next time! I swear it.Service:*Attentive and friendly. Very welcoming. *Bussers were also great, clearing dishes and wiping things down at the exact moment they needed it.Appointment:*Not much else to be said about the atmosphere that hasn't already been state by other Yelpers. Very unique, inviting, and soulful place. Despite it being crowded, it was never loud. *I really enjoyed checking out the 3D mural on the wall to the left. Lots to look at it and a copy of Dave Eggers' ""What is the What,"" too! Loved that book.*There was a Latin jazz group revving in the bar area. Nice complement to the night, but I'm sure it would've been a bit much if I were seated in that part of the restaurant.*Can't wait to post up on that patio come spring.*Marcus himself visited the table.

If you would've asked me a month ago what I thought of this place (this review is for the sunday brunch at the supper club) I would've said that it's a fun touristy thing to do. $39.99 is a decent price for an all you can eat brunch and the gospel performance. My boyfriend and I decided it would be a fun thing to do with his parents this Sunday- so I called to make a reservation. Apparently they now have a ""new"" reservation system where you can only dine for an hour and then you are asked to leave because they reserve the next time slot. So if you have a 12:15pm reservation you are asked to leave at 1:15pm. Who in their right mind would think that's a good idea? Who eats brunch and watches a performance in an hour??? This has to be the tackiest move I've ever seen a restaurant make. I unfortunately cannot back out of going this Sunday but I will not be patron after this.

1.0,2/12/2013,"Hated it!  I'm pretty sure it has nothing to do with the restaurant itself and more with the pretentious, obnoxious crowd.  Nothing on the menu seemed appetizing so I didn't eat there and probably never will.  The drinks are over priced and not worth it and the bar tenders ignore newbies and focus on their regulars.  Just my opinion, take it with a grain of salt, i couldn't bring myself to give this place a decent shot because of the crowd.",1,1,0,Salma M.,"Jamaica, NY",12,189,52

She gave me a gift certificate for a free meal for my friends and insisted we allow her to make it up to us. We accepted and the second time around was much better. The service greatly improved, but I suspect it is because they knew we had an issue  the first time and they did not want a repeat of that disaster. We were seated almost immediately and the food was not over salted this time. All in all it was a big improvement but the place itself is more about being a ""scene"" rather than a restaurant.

5.0,2/10/2013,"This is a brunch review.Five people.  Saturday, the better day for brunch without a reservation.  Got a table in the bar area right away by a gracious hostess.  Seating is on high bar chairs on communal tables (I think), since we were five, the table was all ours.  For brunch this seating arrangement gives it a casual, yet stylish and most appropriate ambience. I wouldn't have sat inside if they paid me.For drinks the spicy bloody mary was bloody good, the bourbon negroni (absolutely perfect concoction) was sooo good I had to have another and .....Got two corn bread plates (hot off the oven, porous and very accomodating for the honey butter which melts right into it and tomato jam) be careful you could ruin your appetite with these and daily market greens (not boring at all especially since u get pickled beets, sherry vinaigrette for that tartness and gooey delish pecan puree for the sweet tooth, amazing). Those were our shared starters. Now onto the mains.Helgas meatballs (signature dish,  ever since discovering lingonberries and swedish meatballs in Ikea it was not to be resisted and proved to be amazing with braised cabbage and dill potatoes), Spiced bacon with some beet relish (thick spiced bacon had jerk spices wowee!), Baked Macoroni and veggies and delicious cheese tasted terriffic, Scrambled eggs come with mozarella and tomatoes and a spicy chicken sausage (heavenly when done soft), French toast was fine. Coffee is really good too.  I gave it five stars because the food had a great blend of salt, sweet, tart and spicy, for my taste just amazingly perfect.  But this earned it 4 stars the other star went to our server, Joann and the great morning ambience of the bar room.Best damn brunch in the city!",1,0,0,Riz H.,"KEW GARDENS, NY",5,60,6

We started with the corn bread, which is good but nothing to write home about. They have a shrimp appetizer which was tasty but very small and not very original in any way.The entrees we ordered were the Yard Chicken and Sea Bass. The chicken was undercooked and still had blood running in it and came out very soggy. The sea bass was tasty but the side dishes tasted like something from a diet frozen meal. Very disappointing, I think the only seasoning added was salt. Overall, we payed almost $140 for two people(drinks not included) and ended up going to the teriyaki chicken place afterwards because we weren't anywhere near full, mostly because one entrée was inedible.Just a side note, the chef shouting out orders was really entertaining for about 5 minutes, after that I wish he would just shut up. :)",4,2,0,Douglas V.,"Hillsdale, NJ",82,15,3

No signal underground so I couldn't call. 2 train was late. All the things could go wrong, went wrong. They held the reservation. Told them that I have a 8 PM show time to attend to and has about an hour to eat. They served the dishes quickly, expertly, and absolutely amazing. Jerk chicken was great. It reminded my time in Jamaica. The pickles was a pleasant surprise, it hit the spot. Never had pickled okra, and boy, it was amazing. I think the restaurant is underrated, not overrated.  I want to try their version of fried chicken next time. Yes the staff seemed to all look like models dressed in waitstaff in disguise. I will come back, in a heart beat. Hopefully 2 train won't be late next time. I'm told that Marcus has a restaurant in Stockholm.

4.0,1/25/2013,"Red Rooster caught my attention mainly for the huge buzz that it's gotten since inception. Originally there were mixed reviews about the menu but no one could deny the ambiance. So after letting the initial hype pass, I gave it a chance. Upon walking in, the coat check and host were extremely warm and friendly. I was alone and lucky to get seated straight away without reservations. I recommend getting reservations as it's popular spot and they fill up very quickly. The space is well thought out, colorful  and full of strategically-placed afro-diaspora artifacts like posters, 13inch tube tv playing repeats of soul train, mini sculptors etc.. And that was just the main level. the performance space downstairs knocked my socks off! It felt like Josephine Baker was going to come running onto the stage. The space is fit for the best of performers and patrons alike! Well lit and full of drama! After my mini self-tour, my server Abdul introduced himself and then the fun began.. I started my taste journey with a cocktail called the Brownstowner... Let's just say I was ""stoned-er""! Stoned - in a balanced way. The flavor was perfectly spicy with bourbon and cinnamon and then sweet with some red thing. It was just right! For a starter, I ordered the Taco/Tostido thing which was just delic. There were three mini taco like pastries with three different fillers. Beef tartar filler was my fav. Salmon/fluke filler second and then the third was a blur but it balanced the plate. It gets better.. So as i'm sitting waitng for another dish, out comes some more servers with tastes of dfferent things on the menu. You know all the things that you didn't get to order because your mind was set on something else but the glutton in you wants to taste anyway. Well someone answered my prayer. For $7, I could try another small plate - yay! I chose the veal meatball. it was over before it started - YUM!Last, I had the shrimp dirty rice... Speechless...

The butternut squash soup is divine and the salmon with meyer lemons shows just how good the ubiquitous salmon can be when done with care. My girlfrriend got the market salad, which she enjoyed, and the meatballs. There really was no connecting theme for the meatball plate, but she enjoyed the flavors anyway. The problem is that the service is terrible! Slow, distracted, and confused. No one could keep our orders straight, we had to flag our waitress down every time we needed something, it was like we were invisible. My friend said this is how it has been every time she's gone.

It's mac & cheese with some greens.   I wasn't expecting them to re-invent it somehow, but my issue lies in the fact that EVERYTHING WAS SO BLOODY SALTY! EVERYTHING! The crab cakes especially and were therefore, inedible. We kept joking that they were obviously trying to give us hypertension, but it was quite disappointing.  There isn't much seasoning involved in the food, so the least they could have done was ensure I didn't burn my taste buds with salt.

That dish was the highlight of our night, so deliciously tender with juicily succulent meat that was extremely flavorful and fried to a perfect texture. Only issue we had with that dish is that we wish they gave us more mashed potatoes (only came with a tiny portion on the side). Some of the other items we ordered were the dirty rice w/ shrimp (a bit bland, could have definitely used more seasoning), mac n greens (tasty but not exceptional). We also ordered a side of cornbread (which if you are a fan of cornbread, is a must-order!). It came out piping hot and so good, only thing was it didn't come w/ the tomato jam so we didn't get to try that =(. Apparently they had run out already boo.

4.0,1/11/2013,"There's two separate issues here, the lounge downstairs and the food. First and foremost, RR is awesome and one of my favorite spots in NYC. As someone who grew up in Harlem in the 90's, it's great to see a place like this where adults can come to have a great time and listen great music. If you haven't been here, get here soon.Now to start with bar and lounge scene. When you walk in it feels like a local bar where everyone knows each other and are just kicking it having good conversation. The bartenders are extremely outgoing and definitely add to the already upbeat soul vibe. There is seating both upstairs and downstairs, but the downstairs seating is where the action is as they DJ starts cranking out music after 10pm. They'll eventually clear the chairs at the bar and turn it into a full out lounge/club. Not sure how it is on Saturdays, but on Friday's they go with a lot of 80's and 90's R&B which is a favorite of mine. The crowd is a more mature one so if you're 30+ you're guaranteed to have a great time.The only thing that messes up this place is the food. I had an order of ribs and cornbread and both of them were very basic. Given that it's a mainly soul food menu, I was expecting much better, especially since Sylvia's has lost its step over the years form a food standpoint. The cornbread tasted like it was re-heated and the ribs were nothing special at all. My cousin had an order of chicken and waffles and the waffles were actually ice cold, suggesting that they re-heated them. They def need to work on the food here, it's a very popular spot and I love it, but the food runs the risk of damaging a great reputation.Otherwise, this place is awesome and I'll continue to pop in here on random Friday nights when I feel like getting it in!",8,1,4,Kevin M.,"Princeton, NJ",770,911,1675
4.0,1/10/2013,"The BF and I went here for lunch right before we left NYC, and I'm glad we made it out there. The restaurant is very cute, it has a lot of natural light, which I like very much. The food was absolutely delicious. We shared three things: The cornbread, the butternut squash soup, and the yard bird. The cornbread was dense and delicious with bits of real corn in it. It came with a tasty sweet butter and an interestingly spiced tomato jam. I preferred the butter, but the jam was good too. The soup was also delicious. It was smooth and creamy with the perfect amount of spice. Lastly, the yard bird was also amazingly good. It is dark meat chicken that is soaked in buttermilk for 3 days. Now, I don't like dark meat...usually....but this was the exception. The meat didn't have that gamy flavor that most dark meat has. The breading and fry was perfect. The outside was crispy and the inside was juicy. They serve it with some seasoning in a silver shaker. This stuff is soooo good! I have no idea what it is, but it was the perfect spice to put on the chicken. The mashed potatoes that came with the chicken were creamy and complimented the chicken well. The hot sauce that came with the chicken was alright, but, I must say, the seasoning was enough and the hot sauce was unnecessary. We were very full at the end of the meal.

3.0,1/7/2013,"2.5 stars. Even if I am on the neighborhood, I hesitate I will be eating at Red Rooster again. But because I had such a wonderful time, because the service was excellent and because I have to admit it, I am bias on a live jazz situation... the extra star does not feel like an excess. Truth is, there was a couple of wonderful items on our plates. First, the tomato jam coming with the corn bread. Honestly, I am very confuse because it looked and tasted to me like a handful of roasted peppers with a hint of ginger I believe. Nevertheless, just because of that it was almost pleasant to eat the corn bread. Second, the mussel broth in the Harlem chowder. Equivalent to me to a mussel distillation with a hint of spice from the entire sea, as it was so flavorful that created certain addiction. Other than that, things were pretty average and even inedible for me. The corn bread tasted almost exclusively butter. And texture wise, it was soft bread.  Closer to a cake actually.  If this is how corn bread is suppose to be, then it must be that I am just mistaken by the wonderful ones I got in the past ... sorry if I am getting corn-y here. The collar greens were good. Nothing special. Good and nothing special by the means of almost bland. But I got more disappointed because I was expecting something unique. The menu claim no other than Collar greens with mustard and Kale..? We order the Harlem Chowder for two. It was actually a large portion, more than satisfying for 2 people. A wonderful mussel broth (remember a few sentences ago?) with prawns, clams, scallops and mussels (on their own shell) roasted lobster, corn pieces and potatoes. All the seafood was really overcook and it wasn't that flavorful, particularly the lobster. The clams were good, quite good I have to admit it. But the potatoes were almost raw. Have you ever try that? I don't understand either. But alright, to be completely fair the sides dishes coming with the chowder were above average. We choose the tofu salad and the crab salad. I liked specially the tofu salad mainly because of the peanuts that gave it an special touch. And yes, I am also still thinking on the raw potatoes. Once again, I don't get it either. And alright, maybe another half star because I actually like some fusion elements on Red Rooster dishes.

2.0,1/7/2013,Surprisingly disappointed. I've read reviews on the Red Rooster from all types of publications and all were glowing. Unfortunately my experience was much less so. The staff was polite but inattentive. The food was lackluster at best and the wine had obviously been opened for much too long to be served. To finish I had the hot chocolate that was over spiced. I think the owner should spend more time overseeing the kitchen.,0,1,0,Andrew B.,"Manhattan, NY",1,21,1
1.0,1/6/2013,"after once being told that there was a 3 hour wait for a table...after once meeting Marcus Samuelsson at a random market up the street...after reading countless neighborhood blog entries about how wonderful it is...RR is one of the most overrated establishments in harlem. I had the fish and grits. while the fish was tender and moist and seasoned well, the grits were awful - loaded with anonymous cheese and barely any grits! The random 'salad' placed on top had no flavor. My BF had the jerk chicken which was surprisingly sweet and contained a spice my palate has never encountered. Being west indian, from Brooklyn, I know what a real jerk chicken tastes like and that was NOT it. We also had the punch, which the BF described as ""kool aid with vodka"" - fitting description.Pricing is a little bit off, with an average of $25 per entree, which wouldn't be so bad if the food actually tasted like it was crafted/made by an award winning chef! all hype and no action.The saving grace? a trip to Ginny's, right downstairs -- the party was JUMPING and just about made up for the awfully yucky experience at dinner.",1,1,1,Vit C.,"Brooklyn, NY",15,81,31
4.0,1/4/2013,"Hype, hype, hype. The bane of the chef's existence. Marcus Samuelsson has a reputation to deal with, although I have to say that he doesn't seem to mind the attention. The night we were at Red Rooster, he and his entourage entered the restaurant to a flurry of camera snaps and commotion. I have it on good authority that Marcus is generally very kind to patrons; however, it might have been an off night. His impatient smile and strangely distant demeanor were hard to ignore. Ultimately, it's not the chef; it's not the camera flash; it's not the service or the music or the decor that matters. It all feeds into the experience, sure, but it's the food that counts. Red Rooster falls between a 3 and a 4-star review for me. It's a pricey place, and for some small flourishes, it's certainly worth it. The fries in garlic aioli or the traditional, Southern grits; the blackened catfish and the fried chicken - for this, Red Rooster exceeds expectations. A restaurant should be more than flare, and it was for these entrees. The other selections, vegetables and seafood and grilled chicken options, it wasn't worth the dollar bills. I'm sure that with a rep and report like Samuelsson's, he has as much concern for a Yelp review as the mayor of the city has for the enraged street seer proselytizing around the corner in Harlem. I love that there's a genuine effort to revive Harlem, not just gentrify it. I love that Red Rooster seeks to bring a culture and cuisine to the city that can't be found on the average stroll. The Southern touch and the mood-leveling tone of the place is all to be applauded. It needs something more, though. Something a little more accessible, more inviting. Not just a surface change, but a menu change. A few more entrees, a few more standard selections. I'd go back. Even in a city like New York, with so many options and so many reasons to save your money, I'd go back. But I'd run back if the menu altered even a little bit. I trust Marcus, and I think he knows it's not quite there yet, either. I think it could be; I hope it will be.",4,0,1,Clint W.,"Houston, TX",79,149,162

(i love dark meat so im not complaining, but could it at least be giant pieces of dark meat? can the drumstick not be the size of a lollipop?)service is sweet. restaurant itself is nice. but i wouldnt trek an hour from brooklyn to come here again. unless they have a fried chicken sale, in which case i will be the first one in line.",1,0,0,Crys Y.,"Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, NY",44,63,0
3.0,1/3/2013,"After wanting to eat here for a long time, my friends and I finally decided to make the long trek from Brooklyn to Harlem to sample the gold hand of Marcus Samuelsson.Let me break it down like this:GOOD:1. Decor is really clean and airy. Slightly exorbitant in a Vegas-like manner but it was nice. Huge bar, high ceilings. Bathrooms were really cute with interesting photos.2. Service was spot-on. The four of us sat at the bar (no wait! ) and were served by two really friendly bartenders. They were attentive without being overbearing. 3. Good music and loved the little TV that was playing old episodes of Soul Train.4. Food was good. I loved the spices that were used on the fried chicken and the biscuits and gravy with pork sausage. Not your everyday fare. Not the best fried chicken or biscuits and gravy I've had but happy to have tried them.BAD:1. Priced out. This place would have a higher rating and future frequent visits if the food wasn't so expensive for what you got. Two pieces of fried chicken with pickles should not be $22, it should be $16. Two slices of cornbread should not be $4. 2. Cornbread was yuck. Totally dried out to the point I didn't want to eat it anymore. Did love the honey butter and tomato compote it was served with though.3. Busy. We got in early so we didn't have to wait but mid-entree, the waiting area was packed, which meant there were people standing extremely close to me while I was munching on my fried chicken. Come early.So that's it. If you have cash burning a hole in your pocket, then come here. If not, save the hour train ride for somewhere else.",2,0,0,Michelle Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",169,329,15

2.0,12/25/2012,"I could talk about Marcus Samuelsson's stellar reputation. Or the ambiance of the restaurant.  Or the length of the wait, or even the politics of gentrification vs. revival of the neighborhood.  But why go into any of that when there's such a glaring issue that ruined this place for me.The real issue is that the food wasn't very memorable.The yard bird wasn't very flavorful, and some parts of it even tasted burned.  The truffle mac n' cheese was decent, but I've had better for a more reasonable price.  The bloody mary was hot yet somehow also bland--not a very complex taste, and not strong enough (and I'm really a lightweight).  My favorite part was the cornbread, which was warm and buttery and enhanced really nicely by the honey butter and tomato jam. I've gone back in a large group and sampled the food of my tablemates, and nothing really stuck with me.  It's just...okay.  The first time I went, I thought, okay, maybe I just choose incorrectly, but 1) the yard bird is supposed to be one of their specialties and 2) having gone back again to sample many different dishes, I'm convinced that the food isn't as impressive as I'd like it to be.  (For brunch.  Maybe the dinner or lunch would be different, but the menus seem to change only slightly.)So if you're really just looking for food that blows you away, in my opinion, this isn't really it.  (Now, the ambiance, the celeb chef, the politics...that's all another story, and for some people, that might bump this place up a star or two.  But for me, the food was so mehh that all those other aspects of the restaurant just didn't matter.)",1,0,0,Esinam B.,"Manhattan, NY",5,25,0
4.0,12/25/2012,"Over the last few years Chef Marcus Samuelsson has become one of the most sought-after food personalities. A media darling, he's had his fair share of sincere praise be it from the Obamas, newspapers, or the Internet. While naysayers may scoff and consider the space an expression of restaurant imperialism, Red Rooster is an important addition to Harlem; reviving, as opposed to gentrifying, a vibrant neighborhood deficient of the food burgeon that is synonymous with New York City.The space is expansive and bright with a substantial bar. But it is also colorful, retaining elements easily attributed to a Harlem aesthetic. Notable is the art, a gallery of frames assumed to be of Samuelsson's family, decorates the bathroom's walls and a bird wearing red canvas sneakers will undoubtedly bring forth a smile to wondering eyes assessing the space.The food, of course, contributes wholeheartedly to the experience. The Bloody Mary here is smokey and spicy. The cornbread lives to the hype. With actual pieces of corn, it comes warmed with butter and a fragrant tomato spread. The mac and cheese is fine, easily recreated and even perfected at other places. However, the fried chicken is uniquely brittle, moist, and delicious. The catfish which comes with creamy shrimp grits and collard greens is outstanding. Order the parmesan fries to share, or just for yourself. They are more salty than cheesy, a subtle, but delightful update on the fried potato.

2.0,12/23/2012,"Red Rooster is hit or miss, and a recent lunch visit was definitely the latter. The Swedish meatballs (which my wife and I have had a number of times before) were terrible--they tasted of an acrid ""smoke"" flavor redolent of the ""liquid smoke"" you buy to fake homemade BBQ. The market salad was made up of unremarkable and overly refrigerated greens (and lacking any detectable dressing) crammed into a small bowl, which made it impossible to cut or mix around. It reminded me of the salads at Ikea or a college cafeteria. I love having Red Rooster and Harlem and have enjoyed Ginny's (downstairs), but I must say that, unless I hear from friends that the food has taken a major turn for the better, I won't be spending another $60 for a below-average lunch.I hope it was an off-day!",1,0,0,Walt N.,"New York, NY",0,53,1

I had the coconut rice and lentils and peas which was not very good at all. The combination of the pomegranate, fresh cilantro, and some of the peas or beans that were bitter was not good at all.

3.0,12/4/2012,"3.5- Thanksgiving mealMy friend and I went for Thanksgiving dinner, since we were both away from home and didn't want to cook. Our original reservations didn't pan out, so we went to Red Rooster. We were informed that it was maybe a 30 minute wait, and we decided to just go for it. Coat check seemed a little disorganized, and we didn't want to deal with it.Surprisingly, we were seated within 5-10 minutes, but at a communal table. We weren't asked whether or not we wanted a table to ourselves or if we wanted to share, which was a slight negative. We sat between 2 couples that didn't seem in the best of moods, despite the holiday cheer. Seats were fairly close to each other, so I can understand (since I felt it too) the unhappiness at having to share a table with others on a holiday, because you don't feel like you have any privacy. Tried to put it behind me,and focused on the meal.Here is what we got:Cornbread ($4)- decent, came with a side of butter and cranberry sauce.Mashed potatoes ($8?)- best part of the evening! So rich and creamy that we weren't able to finish it on top of everything else. Thanksgiving plate ($28)- good, but I was a bit stunned by how much it cost. But since it was Thanksgiving, how can one not have Thanksgiving food? I thought the string beans were undercooked, but apparently that's how a lot of the chefs prepare them? Didn't quite like those. I wasn't impressed at first by the size, especially given the price, but it filled me up enough (not even close to oh-man-why-did-I-eat-so-much??, more like I-am-pleasantly-satisfied.)Overall, good.

Enjoyed the lively bar scene which was energized by three efficient and friendly bartenders. Tiffany, in particular, is a pleasure to talk to and get recommendations from.   Signature ccocktails ARE too expensive for a neighborhood restaurant. Wine list really uninteresting, short on breadth and real quality for money. Beer selections are better. Appetizers are a mixed bag but if you are looking for a hearty app in lieu of a main course, try the jerk bacon and eggs - soulful, substantial and well done BUT at $18, it is close to the price of an entree. The sides are good deals and we enjoyed the cornbread and the collards.    Dirty rice and shrimp and gravlax are pretty good but also expensive for apps. For entrees, I'd go back for the bunny chow. The real disappointment was the yard bird. Head Samuellson interviewed about his reinterpretation of the classic and it sounded great. What arrived was a sodden lump (no crisp at all) of well cooked meat on a bed of indifferent mashed potatoes (could've come from a box) with a little metal cup of bread and butter pickles (no big whoop) and some red sauce.

3.0,11/26/2012,"I really enjoyed dining at Red Rooster this past weekend for lunch however that probably was because I was not the one paying.The establishment is very well done and the service is great however it suffers from a few flaws:1. The cocktails are too expensive. These cocktails are good and thought out but the price point is something one would see downtown. The bloody mary was also quite bad. Much better bloodies abound throughout this fair city and at $13 it is a complete ripoff.2. The food is too expensive. Most of the stuff on here is at least a few dollars over what I'd expect at any eating establishment. Much less one that is in Harlem and prides itself on being 'comfort' and soul food. Comfort food and 'expensive' shouldn't be together. The Red Rooster Burger, while delicious, is $19. That is nuts. It's beef on bread with more fried potatoes next to it. Maybe I'm missing something but $19 seems a bit much. The crab-cake and shrimp shorty are both cheaper which also seems odd to me(both very tasty).Also, we came for lunch and I noticed there were two items over $25 and a few more over $20. Where am I, at Peter Lugers? Lunch should be a lighter, cheaper version of dinner (IMO). anyways I am kind of rambling now but you get the point. Samuelsson has marketed this place VERY well. and a lot of attention to detail went into the interior and it pays off. The food is good, the drinks are good but the price throws me for a loop. They must be doing something right though because the place is quite a popular destination. For a long time I had this review at four stars but I decided to bring it to 3. I did this because this restaurant embodies what I dislike in the new york dining scene - an establishment that procures most of it's business based on it's marketing or being the 'in' place to be (or the 'it's expensive so it must be good mentality). Thus, people go there just to say they went to it and the entire thing just becomes a parody of itself, much like how I feel the entirety of Manhattan island is becoming (the fall of local ethnic/awesome grub in favor of tourist destinations).",2,0,0,Zach S.,"Brooklyn, NY",32,242,0

This restaurant would seem to prove me right.At brunch at 1:00 p.m. on a Saturday the restaurant had plenty of people but wasn't full, so our part of two sat right down. We sat at a community table with two other parties of two. Seated in the middle, it seemed strange at first, but we got used to it.The brunch dishes themselves were good, but perhaps not the absolute best. The scrambled eggs were just that. The red eye gravy had a nice saltiness to it. But the biscuits, the corn bread and the parmesan fries were what really won me over. The biscuits were nice and crisp on the top and soft and flaky throughout with a wonderful buttery flavor. The corn bread was more the texture of a moist corn cake rather than bread. The fries are skinny and a bit crispy with just the right amount of parmesan.They seem to be known for their bloody marys, but my mimosa might have been the best one I've ever had.Can't wait to come back and try dinner, where I think the food will really shine.",1,0,0,Sara G.,"Manhattan, NY",102,243,14

We were seated quickly, and it filled up rapidly after that, so I'm glad that we did arrive as early as we did. Started with the Yes Chef cocktail (mint-infused vodka, lemon and lime juices, ginger beer, and a bit of berbere spice), and it was delightful, though more summer than fall/winter. There was a prix fixe Sandy relief menu, which included a(nother) cocktail (which the boy drank), then I subbed gravlax for the shrimp (such that I wouldn't die from shellfish allergy), roasted duck (one of the more perfect ducks I've had recently) served with curried lentils and mustard greens, and a pecany cupcake with excellent ice cream. The boy had a white bean and asian pear soup, and coconut rice with curried peas. Our friend had the jerk bacon and egg (I had a bunch of it - pork  belly, brown beans, sunny side up egg - nom), meatballs, and a slice of mud pie, and we all split an order of cornbread for the table. The meatballs were a bit on the lukewarm side, but flavorful enough. The cornbread and the jerk bacon and egg were definitely the highlights.

5.0,11/6/2012,"So I finally made it up to ""The Rooster"" to eat in the actual dinning room. Yes, it was as good as I'd expected it would be. Marcus Samuelsson does not cease to impress me. The vibe is bright, urban, and overall reflects the general spirit of Harlem.I've been reading Samuelsson's ""Yes, Chef,"" ($14.98 on Amazon.com) so my date who lives in the area thought it only appropriate I experience the real thing (Yes, I just plugged a book in a Yelp review). Samuelsson himself was born in Ethiopia and then adopted by Swedish parents, so both countries have a heavy influence on the menu as well as a Harlem soul-food style. We started with drinks at the bar while enjoying the beats of the live Jazz band (I hear this is a nightly occurance). I almost didn't want to leave the vibrant bar scene to go sit at our table, but it was so packed (this was a Tuesday too not even a Friday/ Saturday night) we couldn't find two seats. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves and entranced by the music. You can order food at the bar too... that is if you can find yourself some elbow room. The bartenders whipped up some mean cocktails - these bad boys are both delicious and strong. I had the Brownstoner, with nutmeg-infused Buffalo Trace, cherry heering and St Germain. However, all of the drinks sounded delicious and equally as lethal. Onto the food (ohhh the food!!). We started with the corn bread, which may have been some of the best corn bread I've ever had. It comes with honey butter and a tomato jam which compliments it wonderfully. I had the famous Fried Yard Bird. The chicken was so good and crispy and the meat itself just melted in your mouth. it was just as good as the rest of the things I tasted. The mashed potatoes and bread and butter pickles were also excellent. He had the Jerk Bacon and Egg as an entree (it is big enough to be a meal, believe me he would have been grumpy if it wasn't). I was lucky enough to snag a couple bits and was quite impressed. It may not be the type of place I head to on a weekly basis, but I will certainly be back. It's one of those restaurants that not only gives you a great meal and a solid night but you leave with that ""Oh I love New York"" feeling as well.

3.0,11/5/2012,"4 stars for the ambiance, 2 stars for the food, comes out as a 3 star rating. Let's start with the good first: went there on a Sunday and apparently that was a very good choice, because RR sports a great live jazz/ blues band in the bar area, making for a super lively crowd. The layout is perfect, allowing people to get drinks and dance around - or sit down and eat with a perfect view of the band, as in our case. The bad, i.e. food (and this should be a big deal for a restaurant that the NYT claims to be one of the best in NYC - but then again we all know that they understand zilch of food): cornbread was nice, especially the tomato-based chutney - but not free; white bean, kale, and Asian pear soup - completely unseasoned, had to add both salt and pepper, and definitely could not taste any Asian pear whatsoever; lamb bunny chow - doesn't do justice to the original South African bunny at all, very little flavor given by the curry, useless egg on top; curried rice with fava beans and peas - probably the best, this comes in a huge portion and is quite flavorful, but best indicated as a side to share. Wine list is horribly expensive and very poor in quality. So if you're into an expensive, funked-up version of soul food that doesn't really deliver, then this is your place...

I wanted to love it, but unfortunately there was a large slip in service.We went on Halloween and arrived at 5:45 on the dot for my 6:00 reservation. My boyfriend and I were very promptly seated, so let's assume we sat at 5:47.  The dining room was mostly empty since it was early. Here is where the slip up was. Nobody greeted us until exactly 6:10. Not one person said hello, we'll be right with you, or offered us water. It was bizarre. I'm not at all uptight about service, having been in the restaurant business for years. However, 23 minutes until someone approached us?! It was actually offensive. I'm not sure if there was a miscommunication between the staff on which server had which section, but it was pretty bad. My boyfriend and I actually thought we were being approached a few separate occasion and then the staff member would just pass us by. We were at a very visible spot- the center of the dining room, surrounded by almost all empty tables. In the meantime, a four top who was seated after us went through the entire process of being greeted, watered, ordering and receiving drinks, and ordering their meal.When our server arrived ,I didn't say anything or take it out on him, as it simply may not have been his mistake. If I had noticed a manager on the way out I may have said something. It was just so strange to feel invisible.As far as the rest of the evening, our server was friendly and helpful. Cornbread was delicious, as was my fried yard bird. My boyfriend's pork loin was quite chewy, so I'd recommend to maybe opt for something else.

Our genteel servers were attentive and service proceeded at just the appropriate speed -- not too slow and not too rushed.We decided to share two entrees: the yard bird and the mac and greens, dirty rice appetizer, and cornbread as side family-style between three of us which worked out really well. It would have been a bit too much chicken and a bit too much mac 'n cheese to eat all by myself. Chicken was flavorful and juicy. I didn't need the extra Shake 'n Bake provided, but my friends liked the extra kick. I really loved the cornbread -- served warm with honey butter and studded with whole kernels of corn and possibly red pepper? Aha, marcussamuelsson.com/rec… says it's Aleppo flakes! I didn't like the dirty rice with shrimp.Finally, the dessert menu was seasonal and creative. We had the Vermont maple cheesecake with concord grape marshmallows and smoked butter pecan ice cream. Yes, it was just as delicious at it sounds.I'll be back again as soon as I can. Reservations are a little scarce with the only openings at either 5pm or 10pm. We had to go at 5pm on a Sunday.

So myself and my two cousins decided we would have dinner, first for starters I had the crab cakes although well made with plenty of crab meat they were a bit salty, for my drink I had a glass of wine which wasn't even filled to the level it should have been.  I decided to have the Berbere roasted chicken,nay cousin had the Hearth Roasted Whole fish, and my other cousin had the Fried Yard Bird.

The cornbread came first and the menu said it was supposed to come with tomato jam and we didn't see anything red on the plate! We asked the waiter who apologized and said he had just learned they were out...minor service flaw on their part for not telling us, but not the end of the world.The chicken was delicious and comes with hot sauce and some cajun spice to add on top if you want. It was a little hard getting the meat off the bone with fork and knife, but it was good. Next best was the mac & cheese...classic. The greens were just arugula which was ok, and the dirty rice & shrimp wasn't as tasty. Kind of bland. We also shared the cheesecake for dessert which was delightful (comes with grape marshmallows - very cool!) though I wish it had more crust since that was my favorite part!Service was really good though. Waiters were attentive but not intrusive. At one point my jacket fell off my chair and a different waitress (not the one serving us) picked it up and let me know it fell.

The food won't blow you away. It feels like a ""destination"" for any tourist or downtown NYC resident who's heard of Marcus and wants to ""experience Harlem"".The last time I visited (tonight) my friend and I shared a couple of apps/sides and two entrees. First, the corn bread, which was pretty tasty and buttery. We inhaled it since we waited over an hour for our 8pm reservation. Thank god for the corn bread. We also had the wings, which were meaty but doused in too much spice. My friend and I really like spice, but we were both chugging our water & drinks and fighting over the cucumber garnishes to fight the flames.The market salad was fresh but under-dressed and pretty boring. Pass. For our entrees, we shared the catfish and grits. How can this place go wrong with catfish? Well, it was cold and rubbery. The ""bunny chow"" lamb sandwich was the highlight of the meal, in addition to the thoughtful and attentive service.All in all, check out Red Rooster if you want to switch up your routine and want to see what the fuss is all about.

3.0,10/2/2012,"I am on the fence about this restaurant. I have been itching to go since I heard Marcus Samuelsson opened a place in Harlem. But with a six-year-old, it has to be the right time. That time came last weekend when friends flew in from California and wanted to explore Harlem. I suggested the Red Rooster for brunch. There has been so much hoopla about this place, that I expected to be swept off my feet and brought into culinary heaven. Well, I wasn't, but it could very well be that my expectations were too high. Let's start with the pluses. Love the atmosphere. As others have written, the vibe is cool and hip. Walking in, you feel like the coolness of the place transferred to you, making you swagger when you normally shuffle. You can get drunk on that feeling. The staff was similarly cool and very nice. Our waiter offered suggestions and gave us his favorites. It's nice when the staff have tasted everything on the menu and can speak intelligently about the food. The ambiance was relaxed, comfortable, not rushed at all. The music wasn't too loud, and the tables were far enough apart so you can have a normal conversation. (Keep in mind, this is brunch, however.)Now for the food: a little disappointing. The waiter spoke so highly of the lamb hash that he convinced me and my friend to order it. It was unusual, which is not to say good. It was very spicy and saucy. The poached egg on top was overcooked, so the yolk wasn't runny, which would have helped mitigate the spiciness of the hash. The lamb and the sweet potatoes in the hash were just the delivery system for the aggressive sauce. The beets did not add anything to the dish. It was sprinkled on top as if it was an afterthought. My other friend had the jerk bacon and egg with brown beans. He didn't eat it all or mentioned it was good or bad. I take that as it was so-so. On a better note, the cornbread starter was excellent.

First, we walked into a great vibe with soul music spinning, tons of people watching and hip decor.  Second, the food was outstanding.  We started with the oysters and and order of cornbread for the table, delicious!  Then for an entree I had the Fried Yard Bird, which I loved.  This is not your typical fried chicken, the outside is crisp and not greasy and juicy chicken on the inside.  Everyone at the table really enjoyed their entrees.Red Rooster is a little pricey, but it's definitely worth saving your pennies and making a trip up there!",1,0,1,Nicole P.,"ASTORIA, NY",80,151,9
4.0,9/30/2012,"This was a wonderful choice for a Sunday brunch! I'll own my tourist credentials up-front - I was in from Providence, RI for the day and thought that some soul food in Harlem would be a nice start to the morning. Some friends recommended Red Rooster, and although we were a little worried we'd be in for an impossible wait we decided to risk it. It was a great call! The place was busy but not ridiculously so - I sat at the bar enjoying a(n amazing) cocktail while waiting for a friend who had misjudged traffic, and by the time we arrived there was a table ready for us. The cocktail might have been the highlight of my meal. I asked the bartender for his recommendation and he suggested the Yes Chef - a mix of vodka, ginger beer, and pineapple with a hint of berebere to give it some kick. I loved how different it is from my usual drinks (I'm glad I went with something other than a Bloody Mary!) and it was wicked strong, to boot. We shared an order of cornbread with honey butter and tomato jam as an appetizer. If I were going to change anything about our meal I would have had us order 2 so that there would be more to go around! I still can't decide which topping was more delicious - the honey butter was rich and just the right amount of sweet, but the tomato jam was savory and had a really nice depth of flavor. I might have to go back and order some more before I make a fully informed decision. I went with the fried yard bird for my entree. My only disappointment was that I wasn't able to substitute grits instead of the mashed potatoes for a side. I would have been happy to accept an upcharge for this, but the server indicated that this wasn't a possibility. I wasn't hungry enough to order a side of grits in addition to the mashed potatoes, so no grits for me :( I've usually found that restaurants are quite accommodating of similar requests and still don't quite understand why I couldn't swap my carbs, but hey, chef's prerogative right? Anyway, the bird was tender and juicy and had some nice spice to it. Not the best fried chicken I've ever eaten, but definitely worth a try.",0,0,0,Laura S.,"Charlotte, NC",292,347,54

I had the bloody Bloody Mary that tasted very alkaline and like old, diluted V8, lukewarm because it only had one bloody ice cube the size of a tomato in there. Couldn't finish it & moved to wine. The lamb with fried egg was clumsily displayed and just lame. The berbere chicken had no berbere. Ummm...why on earth are you calling it that then?  Olgas's meatballs were ok, but Olga would probably be disturbed by the weird sauce the meatballs came with -- just yukky!

Okay, now that we have that out of the way...I was really excited to eat at Red Rooster, as it was probably the most interesting place I had planned to eat during my NY trip. I immediately knew I'd get the fried yard bird, no question about it. The bird was really crispy on the outside with a really well seasoned skin. The mace gravy was so rich and interesting, I loved it. The housemade hot sauce was incredible and cut through the rich bites of gravy, dark meat chicken, and mashed potato. The sweet potato donuts were a big let-down, though. I expected them to be light, fresh, and hot. Instead, they were heavy, not fresh, and pretty cold. If they were hot and straight from the fryer, I'm sure they would've been better. However, the vanilla cream on the side was fantastic. The restaurant has such a great atmosphere to it, it looks really nice and plays such good music overhead. All the waitstaff was professional and kind, something I really appreciated. My waitress had no qualms about splitting a check 3 ways for 3 people, something I always feel bad asking them to do!I loved going to Red Rooster, but the price was probably too high to justify going back again.

3.0,9/20/2012,"Just like a bad after dinner coffee can sour a great meal, so too a poor reception before a meal leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth. Full disclosure: we were running a few minutes late for our 8:30pm Monday reservation.  To be courteous, I called the restaurant as we were walking from the train only to be curtly told that tables are only held for 15 minutes, so D and I made a run for it.  Out of breath but relieved, we arrived at 8:42pm.  But, they're running behind and our table will not be available for another 25 minutes.  Something tastes funny when I mention that it would have been nice to be told this on the phone!  However, a live band and a big bar with lots of cocktails to discover calmed us for the moment.  Wrestling thru the other delayed reservations, we tried the Big Easy (Lovely and lemony, although wish it was a little sweeter) and the Yes, Chef (Yummy and strong).  Drinks in hand, we grooved to the female singer who made rounds around the bar and restaurant and the swooned to the male singer.  After a half hour, I checked in with a host to be informed that not only were we still waiting for the other patrons to ""finish up"", but that two 2-tops were also waiting ahead of us!  With rumbling tummies, we kept on toe-tapping and were finally shown a table a little before 10pm.  I understand waits - but it wasn't right to keep leading us on without even a kind word or a comped glass of wine.Sitting at our table with a view of the kitchen (at least for one of us), our sweet waiter shortly appeared.  Marcus and his wife were making some rounds to the regulars, which seemed to just delay things a little bit more.  But enough complaining - was the food worth the wait?  Probably.  The food was delicious and comforting, and just different enough to make it interesting.To start, we had to share the corn bread - absolutely perfect, just sweet enough and filled with juicy corn kernels.  Couldn't stop slathering on the tart tomato jam accompaniment.Appetizers were the 5 Spice Duck Salad (a house specialty it appears), which surprisingly based on some fave ingredients, did not have me squealing with glee; perhaps the proportions or the slightly over cooked duck.  Second app was the Smorgasbord - since I can never resist a tasting dish - and pretty perfect for sharing it was, with just about two of everything, albeit a thimble portion of each.  Highlights included the house cured gravlax (although I wished it was cut a little thicker) and the tiny ceviche tacos.Entrees were the Mac and Greens - probably one of my favorite foods - for which they did a respectable version, and the Bunny Chow, our favorite dish of the evening - their take on the South African dish featured lamb stew on an open bun with ricotta on one side and fried egg on the other.  Flavor packed, and fun to rotate different combos in each bite.We also shared a perfect Saison on tap as well as the ""new"" White Peach Sangria, which was good, albeit a bit of a misnomer since it tasted more like strawberries than peaches.Believe it or not, I couldn't manage dessert, although the look of the sweet potato doughnuts (and the looks on the faces at our neighboring table), we may need to trek back to Red Rooster, although hopefully at an earlier hour.",1,0,0,Sheryl F.,"New York, NY",24,18,25

4.0,9/13/2012,"Maybe I wanted to like it too much after just reading chef Marcus Samuelsson's recently released autobiography, ""Yes, Chef"". But something about the meal was a little bit underwhelming.I kind of groaned from the get go, when I saw that the prix fixe menu for $45 includes an autographed copy of his book. Thankfully I read it for free on my phone so I skipped his cheap ploy to hawk his book along with the weakest selections from the menu for too much money.Anyway, the food here is pretty good, but it's a little overpriced for what you get. We started with the Corn Bread with Honey Butter and Tomato Jam ($4), which was actually pretty awesome. Nice and soft and buttery, this was the one dish that was definitely worth it.For the entrees, we got the Fried Yard Bird with white mace gravy and mashed potatoes ($22). I'm not as big of a fan of dark meat for my fried chicken, which is another reason I wasn't so impressed with this dish since it was all dark meat. The skin also wasn't particularly crispy, which was also kind of a letdown. It did taste good though, and the mashed potatoes were nice and smooth.We also got Helga's Meatballs (with lingonberries and dill potatoes) ($18). These were delicious, but there were only 6 tiny meatballs in the dish, which was again disappointing. I wasn't a big fan of the potatoes, and they seemed like they were way too hard.We ended the meal with the Sweet Potato Doughnuts with Cinnamon Sugar ($8), which were actually really good, so the bookends of the meal really salvaged it for me.I enjoyed the atmosphere very much too.

I was only disappointed in that my salad only came with ONE lonely tomato which is sad for a salad called a Heirloom Tomato Salad. The boyfriend ordered the creamed roasted corn soup and it was complex and really brought the roasted corn flavor. For the entree, I ordered the salmon and it was cooked to perfection- medium well. It was soft, tender, juicy with a pink center and came with a perfect side of tangerine, fennel slaw. Dessert was a baked peach on a tart and ice cream. Yumm, yummm.

When I questioned the reason for our delay I was told they seat according to the number of guest. Beware guest, they seat according to the number of your party.

It's like WTF are we in a school cafeteria, or canteen. I was blown away. I did not expect to share a table in an upmarket establishment.The food and service is another storyno bread or complimentary eats before dinnerfor the price, the food is not a WOW factorover priced, not savory, and something I could do at homeThere are many other places in Harlem where you can get better tasting food, worthy of Red Rooster prices, but they are affordable. The place is a upscale hangout spot, with an upmarket ambience similar to Applebees, noting classy about this place. Don't believe the hype.",0,0,0,Sonwabile A.,"Newburgh, NY",0,14,0

2.0,8/16/2012,"Red Rooster didn't live up to our lofty expectations -- and in fact would probably not have lived up to modest ones either. We were seated 15 minutes after our reservation (and even then only an outside table was available). The Savoy cocktail was excellent, but we ordered the mac and greens entree as an appetizer, and it was only so-so. The mac half was creamy but a bit bland, and the greens weren't the greens we expected: a raw salad completely overwhelmed with salt. We couldn't figure out the concept of the dish, whether the halves were supposed to be eaten separately or apart. Both ways, the dish wasn't anything great. The yard bird, which we had seen recommended, was mediocre; I consider myself to have a decent palate, but it just had a strange combination of tastes. As for the steak frites, I wouldn't order that for half the $37 price. Billed as a T-bone, it came out looking more like a sirloin (it seemed like a diner-quality cut of steak) and was tough and overcooked to boot. It was drenched in this succotash that was entirely unappetizing, even nauseating. I tried two bites, and then my girlfriend sent it back (I don't have the fortitude for that). To their credit, they replaced it with the smoked salmon, which was fairly good, but by that point we had completely soured on the restaurant.The live music was great, and the ambiance in general was nice. But the service was poor (our server was nowhere to be found -- it was a server for an adjacent table that came to ask about the food and dealt with the steak, and our server didn't even follow up to see how the salmon was), and the place was so crowded that I don't think I'd even consider going back just for drinks and live music. It seemed like everyone in the bar area -- packed in just about literally shoulder to shoulder -- couldn't get a bartender's attention.For a $110 check (including tax and tip), there are plenty of other places I'd rather go.",0,0,0,Brett K.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0

5.0,8/16/2012,"I decided I needed to write a post since many recent reviewers have commented on serious problems with the service at Red Rooster.  I mentioned this to my waitress after a meal of impeccable service from host to bartender to waiters to busboys, and she explained to me that they have a new manager who has been working very hard to train the staff and address all service issues.  From my experience, I must commend them on their efforts, because we had a fabulous meal and experienced none of the problems described in recent reviews!Went as a party of 3 on a Tuesday night at 9pm to celebrate a birthday.  Arrived 20 minutes early, anticipating a delay in seating after reading reviews on Yelp.  Checked in, ordered a round at the bar (the drinks were STRONG, creative, and a major highlight all night, btw), and right at 9pm we were seated at an outside table (we were told it would have been an extra ten minutes to wait for an inside table to be bused; we appreciated that they remembered us and our reservation time and gave us the option).Others have described Red Rooster as crowded and ""scene-y.""  This is not untrue, but the crowd was very friendly, not pretentious, and the live jazz was wonderful.We ordered the cornbread with honey butter and tomato jam and a ""smorgasbord"" appetizer, that included grilled shrimp, liver mousse crackers, pickled onions, and a few other items I can't recall.  The cornbread was delicious, but my only criticism for the whole evening, is that it should have been complimentary, as no free bread is provided.  Rather than charging $4 for cornbread/honey butter/tomato jam, the bread and butter should be free, and then I would happily pay $2 for a side of the tomato jam.  At this price point, it seems a little strange to not be given bread, olives, or some sort of amuse to begin the meal.  The smorgasbord was all around delicious.  One of the shrimps came undercooked; we pointed it out, it was graciously removed, and within 5 minutes we had a replacement shrimp brought out on its own plate.  I always appreciate when a place correctly and quickly addresses an issue!For entrees we got the yardbird, roasted chicken, and I got two apps, the heirloom tomato and watermelon salad and the jerk bacon and egg.  Everyone was very pleased, and we actually felt the portion sizes on the entrees were quite generous (I'm confused by the reviews that said they were too small?  Sure, they weren't the size of the plates at Amy Ruth's, but that's not why you go to a place like Red Rooster).  The roasted chicken was moist and well seasoned.  The yard bird was ridiculously moist, the skin VERY crispy, and while the mashed potatoes served with it were pretty bland with just some salt, they were the perfect counter-point to the delicious and very spicy dipping sauce.  The heirloom tomato and watermelon salad was the surprise highlight of my meal:  cherry heirlooms, big chunks of watermelon, basil, mascarpone cream, avocado cream, oil, salt and pepper.  As the mascarpone and avocado blended together, the dish just got more delicious.  The jerk bacon and egg comes on a bed of baked beans.  Beans were perfect and not at all mushy.  The jerk bacon was quite salty, so if you have an aversion to salt, try something else.  With my light salad and tart drink, I rather enjoyed it.  However, my egg was more over-medium than over-easy, so perhaps if the yolk had been able to run over the bacon and beans, it would have cut down on the salty aspect.  I didn't mind enough to send the dish back for a new egg, and ended up cleaning the plate!For desert we split the sweet potato doughnuts and some good strong coffee.  All in all, the meal certainly exceeded my expectations and I would absolutely consider bringing other friends back, even if just for drinks to begin or end the evening!",0,0,0,Christie C.,"KEW GARDENS, NY",1,16,2

2.0,7/31/2012,"We're very familiar with Chef Marcus Samuelson from his days at Aquavit & have always enjoyed his food.As we had some friends from St Martin visiting, we decided to take them to the Red Rooster.Arriving at the restaurant, we were impressed with the decor & thought that had gone into the design. We were seated promptly but noticed that the tables were extremely close to each other.Took a look at the menu & placed our order with Abu, the server. After some time, we asked where was our food, as the table beside us arrived & ordered after us, yet they had their food. We were assured that it was on it's way. From there on the evening went down hill. Service is poor, with waiters constantly bumping into you, as everyone is jammed in so tightly. I can forgive poor service, if the food is great but this is not the case. The food is mediocre at best &  way overpriced.  When we left the restaurant, having spent over $250, we looked at each other & said never again. I was so upset, I called the next day to complain. I was told that the assistant manager Therese was not there & would I like to leave a voice mail. I said I would, but the problem is her voice mail is full. ( I'm told that David the general manager left some time ago!!!) I have called back numerous times since, still voice mail is full, so I asked that she call me back. Needless to say, I'm still waiting to hear from her. It's obvious that Marcus Samuelson & his backers have invested a fortune in this restaurant.

2.0,7/30/2012,"As my mother always said to me growing up, ""I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed...."" I was very disappointed with Red Rooster. After all the accolades, the celebrity chef, and the strong word of mouth, I expected a lot better than what I got. At the least, I expected a good restaurant, if not great. Red Rooster really missed the mark. I'm going to try and keep this review on the shorter side, so here are the bullet points-Weak and over priced drinks. $14 for a gin and juice signature cocktail at the bar, that had barely a thimble of booze in it. Also, the bartender spilt half of it while making it....-Crappy draft beer selection. I think 4 beers on tap, and they were an odd selection. The bottle selection was very solid, but also way overpriced. $8+ for most of those bottled beers is insane... particularly in Harlem. In case you're curious, the wine list is also laughably overpriced, even for normal restaurant markups -Long wait times. Made a reservation for 730pm, got seated at 750pm..... on a Monday. Some would say that's a sign of a popular and good restaurant, I'd say that is very poor management.-No bread plate or anything similar. Reservation was 730, seated at 750, first food sighting (the appetizers) was at 820pm.... that's a long time to wait for food. A freaking roll would have been nice-Crowded restaurant. The tables are physically very small, and you're right on top of the people around you-Boring and overpriced food. The meatballs were ok, but nothing great, especially for $23. Go to Meatball Shop in LES or West Village, you'll spend $10 and get far tastier food. I got the roasted chicken, and it was really bland. There was no flavor to speak of, very boring, and I've honestly had better roasted chicken from the take-out at the supermarket.All I can really say is don't be suckered in, this place felt like a tourist trap (in Harlem some how...)

The staff lies, argues, confesses, then insults and lies again.2. The wait staff brings the wrong drinks, twice3. We are offered a free app which we didnt order, then charged for it when the bill comes. Then our bill was charged incorrectly twice more. I felt like we were on candid camera it was all so bad! So we arrive about 10 minutes early for our reservation. No one was ahead of us we were informed by our hostess, and our table had just paid so we should only be a moment. Jump ahead 15 minutes. No a few more reservations have arrived. 3 of them the same size of our party (2) and all 3 seated. We wait, politely another 10 minutes - then approach the hostess. She states:"" I didnt seat anyone ahead of you"" I point them out. She says, 'well, maybe but you are dressed so nicely I thought you should wait for a better table"" - seriously!! So you lie, deny it, admit it, then insult us? She then proceeds to offer us a hsared table at the bar - or nothing.We ask for the manager and keep waiting. We see a table come available, and ask the manager for it. She gives us that table and says : "" I apologize for the wait. I will take care of you.""As soon as we are seated 2 hors d'eouvres come out and are stated to be ""compliments of  the chef. Thanks for your patience.""Okay - so mistakes happen. the hostess is a bitch. But the manager wants to fix. I appreciate that.Our server seems nice, takes our drink order - then comes back 10 minutes later and says he forgot what we wanted. So now it is 7:30 - and we have no drinks - nothing.Our server comes back with our drinks - but not the wine I ordered. I politely explain I ordered the Syrah rose. He said ""oh, yeah"" and left - immediately brought the right wine.We order: The jerk bacon & eggs, and the pickles as apps - then my friend orders the yard bird, I want to order the catfish & grits - but ask if there is any cheese in it - or any way to have it without cheese. I am told there is cheese and it is already prepared. I say okay - I cant have dairy - so I will have the roast berber chicken.So our food arrives. The Apps are AWESOME. I think the jerk bacon and eggs is the best thing on the menu and enough for a real meal.The yard bird was good - the sides are strange - and unnecessary, Now - my berber chicken is sitting in a milk bath!!! I waive over another waiter - and ask what is this: pointing to the liquid in the bowl - he says ""milk' and walks away.Okay, at this point its after 8 - and everything else had gone wrong I knew there was no point in sending it back. So I ate a few bites from the top and left it at that.The waiter asks if we would like a refill of drinks - we do - again the wrong wine comes out.He brings our drinks, clears our plates and suggests dessert - he of course suggest every dish with cream in it. Enough already.So the bill comes - and there are the charges for all the hors d'oeuvres (including the free ones) and the wrong drinks plus our drinks.So we call the waiter over (now its 9pm) and point out the bill problems. He apologizes, syas he will take care of it and rings us back a bill with the 2 free hds off and all the drinks removed from the bill. We pointed this out and thanked him for taking care of us so we dont leave feeling bad.Well guess what - my friend's card comes back and they have run the bill with all the drinks back on - now that is actually called FRAUD!!!!!! WTF??Luckily we had reservations downstairs for the jazz show - and that was awesome. Samuelson walked in - and I tried to speak with him but he was not interested. Too bad. I am a chef.

1.0,7/21/2012,"Where to begin...The A/C was broken, and it was 90 degrees outside.  We sat on the sidewalk because it was unbearable inside.  An unfortunate circumstance, but it was a harbinger of the experience to follow.Our server came to take our drink orders, and my fiancée and I thought we might have a cold draft beer to beat the heat.  The server said that were out of a couple beers.  Cool, it happens.  So she went to check on which ones, comes back and says every tap is down.  Again, it's unfortunate but maybe they're having a bad day.  We decide not to drink alcohol, and our server becomes visibly frustrated.  She takes our order, brings our drinks, then disappears.Now to their credit, the bus staff were very attentive.  They kept our waters full and our plates clear.  But I digress...We ordered the Yard Bird and the Catfish.  Much to our surprise, the catfish was not fried.  Interesting concept, because every delicious catfish dish I've ever eaten is fried.  As expected, it was bland and devoid of texture.  The mashed potatoes were subpar.  The fried chicken was an abnormally large leg quarter.  Too large.  $25 for fried chicken and they couldn't give me a little bit of white meat?  Throw a wing in or something.  The breading was ok, it was spicy and salty but not much else.  The best thing we ate was the tiny ramekin of pickles that came with the chicken.  Oh and I nearly forgot, the cornbread was SIX DOLLARS!!  For ONE PIECE!!So we finished and we were just sitting there, now for a total time of over one hour.  Our server was still MIA, so we called a manager over.  She apologized and comped our iced tea and cornbread, which normally would have been nothing but it saved us almost $15.  Absolutely absurd.The worst part?!  How could it get any worse?!?!  We both got sick!  This was our last big meal in New York before we moved, and it was a complete and utter DISASTER!!  And to rub salt in the wound, if you call to complain, they won't even let you speak to a manager!

Dark wood and candle lit, huge bar area, some communal tables, semi open kitchen. Came here on a Tuesday night with live band music playing; thought the entertainment was great but coupled with the packed house, the noise level was through the roof--don't expect to carry a conversation over your meal or drinks.The food was average.  Cornbread was great thanks to its accompaniment of addicting honey butter.  We tried the Catfish & Grits, the Fried Yard Bird, both enjoyable but forgettable. Side of Collard Greens was subpar.  For dessert, chocolate custard/cake with red velvet ice cream--just ok, very heavy.Not worth the trek up to Harlem.",7,3,2,Shelley W.,"Palo Alto, CA",121,39,27

There were also crazy toppings like sombody puked on your steak. (not described in the menu) I wanted to change it but who will do it since the wait staff was nowhere to be found.

This was my second favorite dish of the night followed by the mac & greens. Smothered in melted gouda..... cheese lovers, this is a must. While the berbere roasted chicken was moist, there was not much flavor to the meat. It could have been seasoned some. For dessert, we tried the sweet potato doughnuts. They were just alright.

The chicken was crispy but not greasy and the dish was definitely nicely seasoned. Our waitress was very friendly and checked up on us twice. We were surprised that the corn bread was extra money.

The first time over a year and a half ago, it was just the best chicken I ever tasted--unusual flavors, spicy crisp small pieces but three of them and meaty and tasty through and through. The portions got larger but the taste more erratic and ordinary. Also the mashed potatoes the other night were syrupy and not fluffy. The meat came out just piled on them. Not really that appetizing. On the other hand, my friend had catfish and said it was really excellent. Our desserts were pretty nice as well, though the cornbread is like cake and not authentic. The drinks are fine, though all the bourbon suits winter better than summer and there weren't many summer style drinks.  Unfortunately, the air conditioning can't handle the room and open kitchen and it was suffocating on a very hot night. I'm afraid When a disc jockey began to spin tunes, it was so loud one couldn't talk.  This is a really nice place with a good vibe.

We made reservations for lunch, and even though half of our party arrived on time, and there were more than enough tables available on the outside patio, the hostess tried to sequester us in the corner of the restaurant that we had SPECIFICALLY asked not be seated in. After finally getting our outdoor spot, we had to wait over an hour for our food to arrive. Meanwhile, the tables around us who had been seated AFTER us had already finished their meals. When our food had finally arrived, they had brought the wrong orders. I had ordered the fried chicken caesar salad and yet they brought me the yard bird. When my correct order arrived (another fifteen minutes later- a total of one hour and fifteen minutes of waiting time), the fried chicken and poached egg that came on top of the salad were both extremely cold. Nothing less appetizing than a cold egg. Not to mention that my friend's potatoes that came with her meatballs were completely uncooked- we couldn't even stick a fork through it. Thankfully our waitress was very kind and courteous, but I was extremely disappointed in how the management handled it. The manager had come over to our table several times to reassure us that they hadn't forgotten about our food, and I had mentioned the cold egg and chicken, as well as the uncooked potatoes, and yet we never received a full apology. In addition, I fully expected to be comp'ed my entree at the very least for the fiasco of an experience. The manager promised to comp my friend's meal on account of the cold potatoes- but when our bill arrived we had been charged for everything. Instead- they sent over a plate of completely under-seasoned and un-interesting donut balls for dessert. Unfortunately, I would avoid this place at all costs. Not worth the time, money or calories.

Upon arrival the hostess stated it would be up to an 1hr 15 min wait. Having solely making the trip out to Harlem for this place we braved out the wait. Unfortunately, after waiting over an hour and a half our patience withered ( there is only so many drinks you can have while waiting on a near empty stomach). Luckily, the bar staff was friendly and so were the other patrons waiting, which made the long wait more bearable. Finally about an hour and forty fives minutes after arrival we were seated at a hightop table next the bar in which we shared with another party of 4, not what we were expecting afterall we did wait longer than projected. Thankfully the food saved the experience. We ordered the two sides of greens yard bird, sea bass with grits, and the roasted chicken. All of our dishes were excellent. I have never been a fan of grits and I took a liking to these. One side of greens would have been sufficient for all three of us to share, and they were just ok, I would have enjoyed them more with a little kick of heat. Our waiter was attentive and curteous, answering any questions we may have had. After the wonderful culinary experience I excitedly placed an order for sweet potato donuts and was very dissappointed. They were dry from being overcooked and bland (guess they are a hit or miss), but the whipped cream that accompanied it was a good pairing.

We were super excited about this one.Now mind you, the waiter and hostess were SO super nice and friendly. If it was based solely off of that, 5 stars. We came for a birthday and was about a half hour late for reservations but they seated us quickly on a busy weekend night. Also, the waiter was more than happy to take a bunch of birthday pictures for our table too.I like the atmosphere too. Fun, hip, trendy.Now onto the food.For drinks:The Dillio - Very good and strong. A bit too strong for me but I enjoyed it.Rooster Punch - Umm, it's sangria. It's ok, not too strong.. more like juice.The Savoy - Yum! Light, fruity, refreshing.Small's Paradise - Probably my favorite. Tastes girly but has a strong kick.Appetizers:Corn bread - So overpriced. $6 for two slices of cornbread. Now if the actual cornbread was good.. that's a different story. It was more like a pound cake slice with cornmeal. I like my cornbread more grainy I guess. However, the honey butter and whatever sauce it came with was good. Still doesn't justify $3 per slice though.Dirty Rice and Shrimp - The shrimp was really good! The rice however, was so so dry.Fries - Mmm.. my favorite of the meal. That's never a good thing though. Thin, crispy, flavorful.Entrees:Fried Yard Bird - The entire table got this with the exception of one. So overrated. So unfortunate. It just tastes like regular fried chicken. Yes, it was good. But what makes it special? I don't understand. It wasn't as flavorful as I'd like. They gave a shaker of seasonings though for this.. but still... something was missing.Roasted Chicken - This was pretty damn good! A nice surprise. Very juicy, flavorful. Everyone agreed this was far better.Desserts:Sweet Potato Doughnuts - Again.. Overrated? I don't get it.Cheesecake - YUM! This was good. The sherbet it came with tasted exactly like a mojito. Also, the sauces with the cheesecake went really well together. Was a nice surprisingly light dessert.Overall, not worth the trip to Harlem. We all walked out of there like...

From the greeter, to the busboy, everyone was so nice and prepared to help. Pulling out chairs, refilling water, quick service...it was like being in customer service heaven.The place is so swanky....I love it...its is a gorgeous restaurant and very social and happening...(however the bathroom was like the Sahara Desert for some reason...but anyways)The food.....the food was ok. It wasn't that great to be honest. It was too gourmet for my taste....it was just the way they combined various food groups wasn't working...And I went for lunch and the price was $$$$$$$$$. And if I am going to pay $$$$$$$$$ then I want delicious gourmet food and it wasn;t worth the price.Food overrated, but I think it is fair to go here just for the experience...at least have a $16 drink at the bar :D",5,0,1,Shanee S.,"Brooklyn, NY",120,65,1
5.0,5/31/2012,"After reading some of the reviews I was a little bit hesitant about coming here. However, since the reservation was so hard to come by I figured it was worth a shot. Boy am I happy I did - this was one of the best meals I have had since living in NYC over the past three 1/2 years! I do not know why people have anything negative about to say about this place. Yes, you're going to have to wait a few minutes to be seated  and yes, the bar is packed so you may have to wait 5 minutes for a drink - it is a busy restaurant! And why you would go to a fried chicken place and order a steak boggles my mind - which at the end of the day is why I ignored the negative reviews and went anyways. If you go to Red Rooster and you do it right (aka bourbon cocktails and yard bird) you will not be let down! In fact you will wake up in the morning and say damn, that was so good I need to write a yelp review and share the awesomeness with everyone.

5.0,5/30/2012,"What a delight! I had a great experience at lunch today at Red Rooster. The New Orleans jazz inspired atmosphere is casual and welcoming, and the host as well as my server were incredibly friendly and engaging. I sat alone, and my server made conversation as well as those who sat near me.The menu was typical of Southern comfort food and soul food, but with unique presentations and recipes. The price, considering the type of food, is pricey. I found the most unreasonable charge to be $6 for the cornbread and butter. Come on! My grandma could make that for a dollar. Given the price of the entrees, the restaurant should provide the cornbread. I'm from the South, and I can make a lot of cornbread for $6. I passed on it simply on principle. The Fried Yard Bird was OMG amazing. Quit thinking about your waist line or those clogged arteries. I know good fried chicken, and this is off the charts good fried chicken. I want to go back and try the catfish too, but I was very happy with my yard bird choice.I enjoyed a nice cocktail of peanut-infused bourbon and ginger, but again the $15 price tag was a bit more pricey than it should be.

Fast forward to my dining experience and guess what, nothing had changed. My party waited for one hour to be seated for a 9:30 reservation, the crowd made it difficult to stand and generally get a handle on what was going on and the remainder of my evening , oh well. I am certain that having a waiting crowd that remains to take in the whole experience is a good thing for any business so hooray for the Red Rooster.

3.0,5/20/2012,"Maybe if Red Rooster was rebranded as a great jazzy cocktail lounge that happened to serve food, it would get 5 stars in my book.  But as a restaurant, it merits only 3.  Great cocktails; great decor, music, and overall vibe; but mediocre, misrepresented food.  Cornbread with honey butter and tomato jam - fine and dandy. Cocktails were great, I loved my Spicy Lady - innocently pink-hued but packing some subtle, smooth heat.  The food - - Tacos and tostadas were actually delicious, but TINY. Garnered remarks such as, ""what is this?! food for ants?! ... it needs to be at least... THREE times bigger!""  But seriously tiny. I guess the most impressive thing is that they must be making the tiny hard-taco shells from scratch, as I can't imagine ones that small selling commercially.- Yard bird was pretty tasty, and came with a can of ""extra seasoning"" which smelled like a mix of bbq spices and paprika.  Again, not remarkable and certainly not worth the hefty price tag.- Grilled cheese with meats. The grilled cheese was too bready, with not enough cheese and melty goodness. The meats were alright, but not sure how the two were supposed to be enjoyed together.  Came with lingonberry jam and wet (soaked in something?) raisins.- Coconut rice was run of the mill, dry rice with mangoes, coconut, and herbs. - Truffle fries had NO TRUFFLE FLAVOR.  We searched and searched for it - until there were no more fries left (alas, tis the nature of deep fried potatoes) - but no flava to be found.  Bad Mr. Samuelsson, bad.- 5 Spice Duck Salad was pretty tasty.  Fatty duck breast was flavorful and juicy, but was unimpressed with how little work they did to try to render out the fat and get some crispness on the skin.Service was unremarkable.

However, when our reservation time arrived, there was a huge line of people waiting for their tables at the same time, and there were three clueless women hovering over a computer but not doing much else. Once we were seated, it took a while before our orders were taken but the waiter seemed honestly apologetic. Anyway, the experience went way up from there. I had advised the restaurant of my food allergies when I made the reservation. The waiter was not only aware before I said anything, but had already consulted the chef and said he would double check after I ordered. That NEVER happens at other restaurants. The food was amazing. We ordered the corn bread and  jerk bacon & egg for appetizer, and I had the meatballs for dinner.  Everything was delicious and very filling.

2.0,5/18/2012,"We went to Red Rooster on May 12 around 4:30 pm to see whether we could have a drink on the terrace -- there were three or four people out there.  The waitress said we we could sit  outside but we would need to buy the drinks at the bar and bring them out.  No problem! We got our drinks at the bar and sat out on the terrace.  It was a beautiful day and we were enjoying our drinks.  Around 5 pm a hostess came out on to the terrace and told us that the tables on the terrace were reserved and we'd have to leave.  What? Really? Oh yes and then she scurried off to eject other patrons.  Once  my husband and I  recovered from our shock and gulped down the last of our drinks we stepped next door to have a drink on the terrace of Chez Lucienne.  We ended up having a very tasty dinner at Chez Lucienne and in the two hours we were there never saw the terrace next door at Red Rooster fill up. Why was it SO important to give two paying customers (who were almost done with their drinks for crying out loud!) the bum's rush? Unfortunately the answer is a profound lack of understanding of customer service which is becoming as much of a Red Rooster trademark as their tasty bourbon cocktails. My  husband and I have lived in East Harlem for 25 years, own a home there, raised three kids there and are really thrilled at the prospect of great restaurants  within walking distance.  We really want Red Rooster to succeed, but we are a bit weary of  being treated so poorly.        The  visit described above was my third attempt.  I had gone there months earlier for a drink with a friend and was again disappointed.  We found a seat at the lovely bar and waited for one of the three bartenders to take our order.  After five minutes (a long time when you consider that there were three bartenders and everyone at the bar had drinks -- they'd already been served) and I finally asked to see a cocktail menu.  We ordered drinks, which were delicious, and then waited and waited for another appearance of a bartender.  After 15 minutes we finally flagged one of the bartenders down, got our check and left. Again, we went next door to Chez Lucienne where we sat at the bar and were waited on by a much more responsive and friendlier bartender (Jason) and shared an appetizer (which Jason had them split on to two plates in the kitchen) and had a much better time.     Well I tried a second time to enjoy Red Rooster which was getting great reviews but I was again disappointed.  My daughter and her husband had just closed on a house in Connecticut and we wanted to celebrate -- this was July.  I walked over to Red Rooster and asked when they could accommodate four. I was told it would be 45 minutes.  I walked home and returned 45 minutes later with my husband, daughter, and son-in-law and were told it would be a few minutes. We stood outside on the terrace waiting.  I should mention that my daughter was eight months pregnant at the time and no one during the twenty-five  minutes we waited,  offered her a chair, a glass of water, nothing!  We were then seated and the service was adequate, the food delicious but the meal was overshadowed by the abysmal treatment while we waited.  My husband was ready to leave after 10 minutes of waiting and talked about the poor customer service all during the meal and vowed he'd never come back.        I am taking the time to write this in the hopes that Red Rooster's management or Marcus Samuelson will address this issue because I cannot believe that they will survive if they don't treat their customers better and Harlem deserves restaurants with great service as well as delicious food.",4,0,0,Elizabeth N.,"Manhattan, NY",1,6,0

My.  Goodness.Get it.  Just get it.  Deep fried dark meat chicken covered in gravy, chili powder, served over mash potatoes and a side of housemade hot sauce.  Unreal.

3.0,5/13/2012,"Sunday Brunch was relaxing, fun with modern decor with a few hits and misses.Definitely could have passed on the cornbread.  Tasted a bit over done with a brittle texture. It was more corny than a nice balance of corn and bread, if you get what I mean?This is why it is always good to specifically ask for what you want before you place your order because you can get highly disappointed.Three Cheese Omelette- I am used to a combination of melted cheese together in a bundled egg crust. I got scream cheese and slightly melted cheese. The portion was good, but the flavor was so so.Scrambled Eggs with tomatoes and french fries with truffle oil. We were under the impression that the tomatoes would be sauteed into the scrambled eggs to create a nice mix of flavor, but instead we got a casserole boat with mini tomatoes and a side of the scrambled eggs in another plate. It felt so piecemeal and lacked the wholesome combination we were expecting.Service was good. The decor was modern and chic. The crowd was a mixture of races and ages a nice melting pot representative of NYC The Bathroom was the highlight for me as it was a pleasant surprise. I felt like I stepped into a time capsule in someone's apartment.

4.0,5/13/2012,"Came here on a Friday night and had a 7:30pm reservation, but didn't get seated until 8pm. Fortunately the scene at the front bar is so hopping and the crowd is so sophisticated and diverse, I didn't mind at all. I have to admit, the expectations bar was set pretty high, and Red Rooster met it in some ways, exceeded in others, and disappointed in a few as well.The service - 3* at best. What's the point of a reservation if you wait 30min? And no apology either. Our server was hard to understand and didn't explain the menu very well. Also, he never came by to check on how we were doing after we'd gotten each course. But he was very nice when he was around.The ambiance - 5* cute and hip decor, a great mix of people - harlem's upper crust mixed in with visitors from downtown. lots of models as well. if you're a young, single gal, be prepared for men prowling at the bar.The food - mixed reviews. I would come back for the appetizers, sides and desserts and would probably try different entrees next time. The dishes:Cornbread appetizer - 5* the honey butter and tomato jam went surprisingly well together. The cornbread was so moist and delicious. I could see myself sitting at the bar and just ordering the cornbread with drinks.Crabcakes w/curry aioli - 2* they had good flavor with the aioli but weren't a stand out. they were a bit mushy, without much shape, no crust on the outside, which would be forgiveable if they tasted great but they were just ok.Dirty rice and shrimp - 4* Really enjoyed this dish. Very unique twist on dirty rice and the shrimp was cooked and flavored perfectly.Yard bird - 3* i had high expectations for this dish but it just had too much paprika for me and wasn't as delectable and savory as i was expecting. I also don't like that it only comes in dark meat, no exceptions. 5* for the mashed potatoes which were pure perfection and the awesome white mace gravy that comes with - I would come back and order this side stand alone. Fish (sometimes bass, this night it was catfish) and grits - 2* it was just ok. but i'm also a shrimp and grits snob because i lived in New Orleans for 9 years. It just wasn't up to par for me. I also don't think fish holds up to a saucy grits dish as well as shrimp does, IMHO.Sweet potato filled donuts - 3* donuts are good warm and the fresh whipped cream that comes with is awesome. However, there is barely any sweet potato filling, which tastes like it has the same seasonings as pumpkin pie filling. basically its like eating cinnamon and sugar donuts. good but not inspiring.Chocolate fudge cake - 5* I don't know if this is normally on the menu because its not on the online menu but if you see it, get it. Best chocolate cake I've ever had. So moist. So delicious. It actually goes really well with the fresh whipped cream that came with the donuts. The ice cream that came with was just blah. But that cake. It was as moist as a cake can be without turning into a molten cake. So overall a very satisfying meal, and at the end, Marcus Samuelson came out to make rounds at all the tables.

3.0,5/1/2012,"I'm always skeptical of places that try to class up comfort foods by putting an eclectic spin on them to try to make it more upscale. Fancy soul food is something that I'm not used to but I figured I would give this restaurant a try after seeing the many ""reviews of the day"" that Red Rooster got. After dining here, I can see why the reviews are a mixed bag. It was a very pleasant vibe of ebony and ivory trendies when we walked in here around 5pm on a Sunday. That's the time that dinner started, however they were not ready to serve it and we all had to wait a bit. Reservations were for 5:30p because that was the only time I could get when I made the reservation four days in advance. We didn't seem to mind the wait because it gave us time to take in the cool set up of the place. The whole look of the establishment had sort of a modern bucolic theme where a rooster walking around on the streets of Harlem might go unnoticed. What didn't go unnoticed was the amount of time we had to wait just to put in our order. I understand that dinner started at 5pm so I can cut them some slack if they weren't ready on time. However, they sat us around 5:30pm. We then preceded to wait for a crazy 20 minutes before flagging the water server down to notify our unidentified waiter. Recognizing the service issue we decided to put our entire order in. Lord knows we had more than enough time to look at the menu. We ordered two drinks: Rooster Punch and Small's Paradise, which were both pretty good. Heard the Yard Bird was the thing to get here so we ordered that for one of our entrees as well as the Pork Loin and the Mac and Greens. It was kind of strange that cornbread did not come with any meals so I figured we would suck it up and just pay the extra $6.00 for it. Can't have southern food without cornbread, right? The cornbread was very good but I thought it would have been more of a basket rather than just two pieces, especially since it wasn't complimentary. The fried Yard Bird was very tasty but it was just a thigh and a drum. Could have used some more parts in there. I never really order ""fancy"" fried chicken because somehow you always end up getting short-changed. The Pork Loin, on the other hand, was huge but not very flavorful. Either it was too thick a cut of meat or it just wasn't cooked right. It wasn't bad by any means, but it just did not seem tender enough. Pork Loin done right should melt like butter. This did not. The Mac and Greens had a good tasty cheese but it was a little too soupy. Not a thick sauce. Few times have I ever been impressed from a Mac and Cheese that is offered only as an entree rather than a side. I respect what this place is trying to do by taking old recipes and trying to add a little more quality to them. Giving people another reason to take a trip up to Harlem is a good thing.

When I say this salad is almost slap your mama good, it really is! All the ingredients mixed together make it a great meal. I also had two glasses of pinot just because I can lol. They also had some spiced wine brewing if that is your poison. On  a prior visit I had the macaroni and cheese which was pretty good as well. My godmother had the shrimp dish (I can't remember the name for the life of me) and that was really good.

3.0,4/24/2012,"Came here on a Sunday night with a friend who wanted to explore the restaurants of Harlem.  She had heard some good things about the restaurant and were both in the mood for some down home southern cooking.We walked in and it was super packed and so there was only seating at the bar or a few tables outside (for a warmer night it would be a great option though not much of a view).  We opted for the bar and were greeted promptly by our waitress.  She was super friendly and great some good suggestions on the drinks (the brew their own bourbon... a must try).While the meal was decent, I don't know if the cost was justified for what my friend and I ordered (-1 star).  The second is that although our waitress was really friendly and helpful, I did feel a bit rushed when it came time to order and pay the bill, but kind of neglected in between except when the busboys kept coming to take our plates when we were not even finished... I had to eventually give up on telling them I was still working on my plate and let them have it... I am not the worlds slowest eater, but by the time we got our meal the restaurant had died down a bit so there wasn't a real need for us to hurry ourselves along (-1 star).With so many restaurants in that area I might venture to explore other places when it comes to food, but if you need a great bourbon drink, Red Rooster is your spot.",1,0,0,Anita A.,"Columbus, OH",36,173,32
2.0,4/24/2012,This place is busy the three times I've there and I don't know why. The drinks and appetizers are good but the actual meals are tasteless.  And the hostess seems not to care that another costumer has just walked in and doesn't smile or try to sit you.  You have to chase them for attention.

4.0,4/20/2012,"Full review blogged. With the day bright and sunny but having been underground for the better part of half an hour I was surprised to find the restaurant already busy and bustling on my arrival but on checking in my reservation was confirmed and I was led to a table only to discover five minutes later that I'd missed a call while en route - my friend was stuck only 2 minutes from his home and thirty minutes away thus leaving me on my own, a situation that given the soon-to-be jammed packed dining room led my server to suggest a seat at the bar if I'd be willing - an offer I accepted given the similar style of chairs and closer vantage of the music - and with that my water was filled, menu presented, and coffee ordered.Having already explored the online menu in the days leading up to the meal and with no changes to be noted it took some time before I could place my order because the computer system is based on seating and there was some sort of glitch, but when my eventual server, Kimberly, arrived everything went smoothly and bearing in mind that I had a train ride to Jersey I told her it was fine if everything arrived at once - a suggestion that made her laugh as I ""...ordered a lot.""With the musicians setting up and tuning up the restaurant went from half full to jammed packed by 10:30am and although the bartenders were not yet allowed to serve alcoholic beverages they were put to work with non-alcoholic cocktails, juices, and concoctions thus leading to my Ethiopian Fair Trade going empty far longer than I'd have liked, but on commenting to the young man before me this was remedied quickly and the cup remained full for the rest of the morning as he personally kept an eye on it since the crowd prevented my server from being able to.As plates are individually ordered there were four dishes in total and beginning with the ""main course"" of Fried Yard Bird with Dark Meat, White Mace Gravy, Mashed Potatoes my first impression was a good one - the thigh and leg coated with a golden brown and flaky batter full of pepper and spices, the meat tender and juicy, and the potatoes whipped to just short of smooth.  Noting here that I generally prefer white to dark meat and that more gravy would have been preferred, the one flaw of this dish was the fact that there was quite a bit of bone and fat to be reckoned with, but overall everything was well prepared and although perhaps a bit pricey, also quite good.Not one to eat a big meat dish in a vacuum, bites of the chicken would be divided by a pair of side dishes, both ordered a la carte and portions of both taken with me for a snack during the hockey game.  Beginning first with the 'Breakfast Basket' featuring Sweet Potato Bread, Walnut Banana Bread, Lingonberry Muffins, Mini Croissant, and Mini Pain au Chocolate I found this concept fascinating as it took roots in both American Southern cuisine, Nordic flavors, and French technique - all obviously part of Samuelsson's repertoire - and pairing the basket with locally sourced honey, whipped butter, and currant jam it was truly a well designed plate.For the second side dish - just order the ""Corn Bread, Honey Butter, Tomato Jam.""  I don't care if it is $6 while The Dutch gives it away for free, these thick and buttery slices are absolutely outstanding with just a touch of sweet and plenty of savory augmented nicely by both the butter and the surprisingly addictive tomato jam - a condiment somewhere between ketchup and jelly with a light sweetness and briny finish that worked beautifully with the pork-imbued smokiness of the bread.My final bite of the morning was recommended by the bartender as a ""must"" - the Devil's Food Cupcake with Caramel, Pretzels.  Noting now my love for cakes and cupcakes in general but that dark chocolate is generally not my first choice, at a cost of $4 this small cupcake at first seemed a bit pricey, but after one bite I immediately understood the recommendation because beyond the dense cocoa cake and salty-sweet combination of caramel and pretzel there was a surprise...a Bourbon Cream center that poured forth lending a whole new dimension of flavor and texture to the dish - to date it is amongst the best cupcake I've ever tasted.With leftovers boxed up to go and the bill settled as the band moved on to songs that included audience participation I made my way through the multicultural crowd of all ages and to the restroom before departing and with the bathroom decorated in black and white photos there was one item that stuck out to me - a letter from a young girl that summed up my thoughts on Red Rooster entirely.  Sure the food isn't 100% authentic and of course there is a degree of commercialism that you expect from any celebrity chef, but what Samuelsson is doing at Red Rooster should be commended not only because of where it is but also because of what it is - good food and good service in a great atmosphere where some may have never considered venturing before.",4,1,2,Michael U.,"Las Vegas, NV",3078,4440,99503

The collard greens were too bland, and the salad had too much dressing and none of the chicken tasted fried.

2.0,4/18/2012,"Red Rooster makes a crucial mistake that many NYC eateries and restaurants do: They take food that at its core is fundamentally simple but delicious, and they try to make it bourgeois and overpriced.  As my boss (who is from Alabama) said when we had lunch there, ""$6 for two pieces of corn bread?  Are they insane?""  Sure, the corn bread came with butter and tomato jam, but surely the quality of the food isn't enough to warrant the prices they charge you.",3,3,3,Yvonne L.,"Sunnyside, NY",92,151,363
1.0,4/17/2012,"This review is solely about the terrible customer service.  I've heard nothing but great things about this place and went for the first time last night.  We asked to be seated outside and the host said it would be about 30 minutes.  We told her we would sit at the bar and have a drink while we waited for a table.  We ordered two beers which were pretty good.  As we sat, and sat, and sat, we noticed that about 5 tables were now empty outside but the host never came to get us.  My dinner companion went to the host station and asked how much longer the wait would be and it became obvious that they forgot about us.  The server immediately sat us at one of the many empty outside tables.  My dinner companion waited at the bar to close our tab and pay for the drinks for about 25 minutes and it was not very busy as I sat waiting for her at our table.  The bartender completely ignored her and then brought the bill and just left it even even though my friend had her arm stretched out trying to hand the credit card to her.  She then waited another 10 minutes for the bartender to come back and take the credit card and swipe it.  By the time my dinner companion finally closed the bar tab and joined me at the table it had been at least 30 minutes.  (and the bar was not busy)  We then sat and sat and sat.  No one came to the table.  A bus boy stopped to pick up my empty beer glass but didn't even offer to bring another.  We sat for another 30 minutes and could not believe that no one came to the table.  We finally just got up and walked out and went next door to Chez Lucienne and had a delicious meal.  I have never experienced such terrible service in my life.  We were literally ignored.  I'm sure the food is amazing.  It certainly looked that way and I would know since I starred at the menu long enough waiting for someone to come by ...",0,0,0,Chuck B.,"Manhattan, NY",260,16,2

Two minutes later, the waiter brings out the exact same plate; the chef had just put the fish back on the fire for a minute. It was still completely and bizarrely tough. So tough that my knife couldn't cut it. It more like shredded the fish in a disgustingly fleshy way. No fish should do that.When I complained to the manager, he said ""That's just what mackerel is like."" That's just a lie.Luckily, they didn't make us pay for my entree but we split the other one.

5.0,3/17/2012,"I've been looking for an excuse to go here. Then, my wife finished a novel, our roommate had an anniversary, and we had a few extra dollars we could spend. So we call some friends, and had them meet us there.We waited for a table in the bar, which was very busy without feeling crammed. The environment was friendly, and we ended up in a number of casual and friendly conversations with others at the bar.I admit that I was mesmerized by the drinks the bartenders were building. They were imaginative, and delicious. One of the members of our party doesn't drink, and the bartender cheerfully built a ginger beer-based cocktail with fig-infused, muddled grapes which was marvelous and refreshing.We were seated in the front, near the bar. We shared the snack nuts, which were infused with sour cherry and had little bits of injera. Nice munchies! The service was regular and attentive. And the food? WELL!!First, the Mac and Greens. Amazingly rich and smooth, the pasta just perfect. The greens were not what we expected, but that isn't to say they weren't good. Expecting a classic collard greens, what arrived instead was a salad of collards, mustard greens and kale. It was a great complement to the dish.Helga's Meatballs were delightful. Arriving in a small iron skillet, they had a nice sauce, and the ligonberries were fruity and sharp without being overly sweet. The bed of cabbage captured the juice. The little side bowl of dill-stewed potatoes was wonderful.As others here have mentioned, the Yard Bird is spectacular. The skin was to die for. Unfortunately, the order was a bit too rare near the bone. However, when we called attention to that concern, there was no argument or issue: the waiter whisked it away, and returned shortly with a fresh, complete order that was cooked perfectly.The steak frites was amazing. My wife and I are big fans of a classic steak frites and this one was beautifully seasoned, with a nice layer of peppercorn. The bone marrow was astonishingly good, and the crumble of crab cake to hold the richness was a great medium. Besides - who can resist the pleasure of getting a nice big cracked bone sizzling with fatty richness on the plate?Well, after such an astonishingly wonderful dinner, how could we not have dessert? We chose the three non-alcoholic desserts. We were encouraged by friends to try the sweet potato donuts, which were light, dusted with sinnamon sugar, and disappeared all too quickly. The rooster cheesecake was also light, and the citrus yogurt sherbet was tasty.  And the chocolate tart? Crumbly, with a buttery red velvet ice cream. Definitely worth sharing!The place was hopping on Saturday afternoon, and remained that way as long as we were there. We had excellent service, and were never rushed out. But once our orders were taken, they were filled quickly. And the one ""problem"" dish was taken care of quickly and without fuss.Finally, I cannot say enough about the music mix. Eclectic and enjoyable. The best way to describe it would be to say it was truly a celebration of Harlem. I think we heard hip hop, jazz, soul, funk, disco, salsa, boogie, and classics. Definitely noticeable, but not so loud as to demand that we all raise our voices in order to be heard.Red Rooster will definitely be on my list for future celebrations. Plus, we found out that we can call ahead to find out when Chef Marcus Samuelson will be in the kitchen, which is definitely an added plus for the foodies!",2,0,2,Karen T.,"Flushing, NY",37,55,4

They redefined the dining experience in Harlem and hopefully new establishments will follow suit.I will preface this with - you don't come to Rooster for the food, you come for the people. The food is fine, but it's not the reason I return. I've been to Red Rooster for brunch and dinner, but the best dish I've had was an appetizer on a random Tuesday night at the bar. They had a cajun seafood and grits dish that was absolutely perfect. I don't think I left a single morsel on the plate.The fact that I was at Red Rooster on a Tuesday night, however, is more important than the appetizer. They had a live latin band nestled in the front of the bar and I got to salsa dance...in my own neighborhood! This is something I at least have to go to the UWS to do...and usually even further down than that.There's always something happening at Red Rooster - from a neighbor's birthday party, to an Obama fundraiser, to the downstairs party, to Marcus Samuelson standing outside chopping it up (talking with) locals.This is new Harlem.",3,0,2,Ro W.,"Philadelphia, PA",143,22,1

3.0,3/14/2012,"After hearing about this place from the press and reviews, my friends and I decided to check this place out.  We were excited to see what tasty soul food would be like, and in the middle of Harlem, we figured it would be legit.Overall, the food was decent.  I had the yard bird, which was well prepared, over a good mashed potato and gravy combo.  The jerk bacon and egg was also very good, definitely a fan of the pork belly.  However, the dirty rice and shrimp was actually pretty poor, the shrimp was nothing special and the rice was actually not good texture wise.  The dessert, the chocolate tart offered, was rich and delicious.The service was also very good, with waiters who were cordial and knowledgeable about the food.The BIGGEST drawback about this place is that it is expensive for what it is.  I don't mind dropping a few extra dollars for a nice meal, but this was a bit too much for what it was.  If it were around 10 dollars cheaper per entree, it'd be perfect, but as is, it just wasn't worth it.  I probably won't be coming back unless it's paid for.",2,0,1,Douglas K.,"New York, NY",392,23,0

5.0,3/12/2012,"From down the block, we could hear the energy of the live jazz band, which surprised us not only by how good it was but more so because of the crowd it drew on a Monday night. As expected, the place was packed with a vivacious and diverse crowd that was no less animated than the restaurant itself. Paying homage to Harlem's rich history and culture, the interior is colorful and contemporary, decorated with art symbolic of the community and conveying a casual atmosphere that puts all guests at ease.The menu was also eccentric, with influences of American, Ethiopian and Swedish cuisines as well as traces of Indian. Many of the dishes included unfamiliar ingredients, but they all sounded equally tasty and intriguing, including a good selection of seafood entrees. After some deliberation, we decided on the corn bread to start, which of course was fantastic with a homemade honey butter and jam, followed by dutch bass over grits for me and Red Rooster's infamous fried yard bird (fried chicken) for the bf. If I say I was pleasantly surprised by my dish that would be an understatement, as I was blown away by the tender fish on the mound of the creamiest, cheesiest and dreamiest grits I've ever tried. Note, that's a big thing for me to admit considering I hate all cereal and porridge-related things. The kicker for mine was the accompaniment of chorizo, salsa verde and capers, which gave the dish a tangy, spicy kick that I adored. The yard bird was also deliciously juicy and crispy atop luscious mashed potatoes, but like all things on the menu, it strayed from the traditional fried chicken by incorporating hints of cinnamon and other Eastern spices. As full as we were (amen again to big portions!) we couldn't resist the warm, gooey sweet potato donuts served with fresh whipped cream to close out the evening.Read more at: nycnovice.wordpress.com",0,1,1,Kristen L.,"New York, NY",157,17,0
3.0,3/12/2012,I ordered the grits for brunch. It had shrimp and crab in it and it was delicious except there was only one piece of shrimp in it.. Am I being greedy?  Well over all it was good.. The seating in the front is a strange situation-- you share tables with other folks.. And that's usually cool if the table is spacious. These tables are not. You sit elbow to elbow with other folks and are forced to listen to their conversations. I think you can sit privately in the back though. Siddity.,0,0,0,Arasi B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,0
2.0,3/7/2012,"I ate at Red Rooster last friday night and I have to say, I really liked the food. Why then you say...why are the stars so low? Well let me tell you my friends. Service in the age of celebrity chefs and come to my little bushwick restaurant in the middle of nowhere and get served by a guy who doesn't care you're there is not in right now. I don't want to go back to Pete Well's experience at The New York Times but the man has a point. But I digress...let me explain.We got to Red Rooster excited. I mean I live in Cobble Hill but I came to this place in Harlem with bells on excited about the comfort food. We were greeted nicely. Bartender was awesome. We loved the decor. We got seated promptly and we were really happy. Then the waiter came over. I had already looked at the menu online but my girlfriend asked the waiter what he would recommend, she said she was thinking of getting the mac and greens. He replied that the 100 dollar steak for two is what he would pick. DUDE, SERIOUSLY? The most expensive thing on the menu? My girlfriend was cool though and said nah, I'll have the mac and greens. I had the yardbird (because of so many good yelp reviews).Food arrives in 7 minutes. Really, it was that quick. We were like awesome, let's dig in. Now the waiter never came to ask if we were doing well. He didn't deliver the food. He didn't even take the food when we were done. The next time he showed up was to give us the menu for the dessert. My girlfriend again asked for his suggestion and again the guy picks the most expensive thing on the menu. DUDE! We say hell with it and we order that. Then 5 minutes later he shows up and asks if we could move to another table so that they could merge the tables for another group. We say that's totally ok and we move even though we're weirded out. This is fine dining right?The waiter doesn't bring the dessert and in fact we have to flag it down because the runner with our dessert is confused when we're not at the right table. The dessert was pretty good (not awesome) but yeah, there it is. We pay and we're done.The food? Stellar. But the service...come on! Remember when great restaurants used to have the waiter deliver the food and explain to you what the dish is made out of? They give you a little information and the whole process seems more enjoyable. This is missing and Red Rooster, guys, you have to do something. Cause your food is good!

3.0,3/7/2012,"Upscale restaurant in Harlem.  Beautiful, hip place full of beautiful, stylish people of all races.  Great service and wait staff.  Food was well-executed, but have I had better at like establishments? Yes.  Is it still worth trying Red Rooster? Yes.I went to Red Rooster for brunch on Sunday.  We got there around 1 pm and had to wait about an hour before we got seated.  Not a big deal, as we jumped on some bar seats when people left, got some cocktails, and listened to the live gospel music.  The bar area is chic and light-filled during the day.  The people watching is fabulous.  Once we got a table, we ordered the corn bread, yard-bird chicken, bacon and eggs (can't remember the name, but it was more interesting that what I just described), biscuits and red-eye gravy, and Helga's meatballs. The corn bread came with a yummy honey butter and tomato jam.  The fried chicken was expertly cooked but a little skinny.  The biscuits and gravy were to die for -- maybe literally, as we probably gained 10 lbs. eating them, but it was worth it.  The meatballs were tender and well-seasoned.  I didn't try to the bacon and egg combo with beans, but my tablemate really enjoyed them.The service was great, and the wait staff was very attentive.",0,0,0,Ninette E.,"New Canaan, CT",21,47,16
3.0,3/5/2012,"Red Rooster is good, not great.  And because I was expecting great, especially from a Top Chef Master, let's say I was a little disappointed.I was really excited to try out Marcus Samuelsson's Red Rooster when I moved to New York because I was a big fan of Chef Marcus from his stints on Top Chef Masters and The Next Iron Chef.  So, on a whim and with a craving for some delicious Harlem fried chicken in our bellies, my friend and I ventured north via bus, farther north than either of us had ever traveled before in Manhattan.  Red Rooster, as a physical restaurant, truly is a gem in the heart of Harlem.  They've really done a great job with the space--modern but not in a cold, detached sort of way.  It kind of reminded me of what a fancy parlor in the South would look like.  We were seated at the communal tables next to the gigantic book shelf filled with cookbooks, knick knacks, toy roosters, and even some sneakers.  This definitely added to the homey feel of eating in someone's personal kitchen.  While waiting for the food, I perused the cookbooks on the shelf--and this was probably my favorite part of the meal!  Books from Eleven Madison Park, Avec Eric (Ripert), Rao's and a photo book from Annie Leibovitz made the time pass quickly.When the food arrived (we started with the corn bread, each ordered the Yard Bird, got a side of chicken sausage and truffle fries):*Corn bread was dry.  Best part was the honey butter.*Yard Bird was good.  I've had better southern-style fried chicken in NY at Peaches in BK.*My friend said his chicken sausage was good*Truffle fries were ok simply because it had truffles.  But the fries themselves were dry (seemed like they were frozen) and they used truffle oil instead of real truffles.Overall, I wouldn't say that Red Rooster is ""BAD"" by any stretch.  However, it certainly isn't all that great either, considering it's pretty pricey for a restaurant in Harlem.  I say that sadly because I was really hoping Chef Marcus would wow me with the type of dishes he cooked on the tv shows.  Maybe he wasn't cooking that day in the restaurant or maybe my expectations were just too high.  That said, I probably won't be coming back here anytime soon.  Maybe I would in any other city, but there's just too many great options in NY to go back to an ""OK"" restaurant a second time.  I certainly hope Chef Marcus opens another restaurant that can highlight his great talent more than Red Rooster does.",1,0,0,Tayson H.,"New York, NY",755,13,10

I'm glad I wasn't the one paying for it.  It was very good but not worth the $130 tab (that includes the tip that was left for the waiter).  So what if it is by the much lauded chef Marcus Samuelsson and President Obama has eaten there on a number of occasions?  For me, in the end, it is about the food and the service.  The food was tasty but not great.  Cornbread with a choice excellent honey butter and a tasty tomato jam.  The market salad we had was under dressed but I liked the ingredients.  My roasted chicken was too salty.  The desert, a chocolate tart with a dollop of red velvet ice cream and a couple bits of peanut brittle was the highlight of the meal.  Our waiter, Malik, was very friendly, informative, not pushy at all but attentive.  At the end of the meal he took the time to escort us downstairs to the new impressively decorated dining area that has not yet opened.  I loved the ambiance and way the place is decorated.  There was a wonderfully eclectic mix of diners.  I would go back again and try something different.  Anybody want to take me?",3,4,0,Robert E.,"Chicago, IL",34,33,16

3.0,2/28/2012,"This place really isn't worthy of the Aquavit affiliation, but whatever. Decent Southern food if your wallet feels like being sucked dry. Came here for lunch with my boyfriend and a couple friends. Cornbread to start, which like everyone said is tasty...but I didn't care particularly much for the tomato jam (was kind of watery and goopy), and I wish it hadn't been pre-buttered. I was annoyed by our waitress, who quaintly recommended the most expensive dishes on the menu, strongly hinted that we get AT LEAST two sides along with our entree, cornbread, drinks, and an order of the mac 'n greens to share. Seriously -- how much can we eat? But we sort of listened to her and got a side of truffle fries, which turned out to be a waste of $9. They're thin and crispy and pretty standard...nothing special at all. The yard bird was pretty tasty - the skin was crunchy and the meat was tender, but I ordered the bass and grits. Two fillets of bass atop a bed of creamy grits and a blanket of salsa verde. I like the grits' texture and the spices in the fish, but I wouldn't make a special trip again for it. My boyfriend ordered the shrimp and dirty rice, which was described to us as more of an Indian dish: basmati rice with almonds and curry...than a Southern plate. It was also decent, but quite small and dainty for being the most expensive platter on the menu. Sweet potato doughnuts were pretty good. They're like munchkins with warm sweet potato puree inside...kind of wish Red Rooster had pie though!

4.0,2/28/2012,"To be completely honest, I didn't know the name Marcus Samuelsson before coming here.  On my recent Harlem trip, a couple of people recommended it to me and it was funny because my friend's house was half a block from it.  Lucky.We entered for brunch around 10:30.  This is certainly one bright, open, and hopping spot.  The staff is comprised of beautiful people, the main bar is quite large and well stocked / designed (in my opinion) and the dining room was full but it didn't feel cramped.  I was not shoulder to shoulder with anyone which was cool.We started with the cornbread which came with butter and a tomato jam.  I stuck with the butter mostly as I wasn't a big fan of the jam.  I definitely liked the flavor and texture of the cornbread.My entree choice, the lamb and sweet potato hash really blew me away.  I was expecting a hash but what actually came served was basically a curry with a fried egg on top.  The lamb was perfect, slowly cooked and tasted of the wonderful sauce base that it was sitting in.  The sweet potato chunks were soft and also really grabbed the flavor of that curry.  The brown sauce it was all sitting in really popped with flavor and had a touch of heat.  I couldn't have asked for a tastier meal.Our server, while nice was a bit pushy for my taste.  She kept using her pen to point out things on the menu and there was a little bit of high pressure salesmanship happening here.  Their brunch is not cheap or outrageously expensive so I don't understand why she kept pushing us to order more.Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Red Rooster and I can see why people in the neighborhood like it.  While inside, you get the feeling that they are trying for a Harlem renaissance and I support that ideology.",1,0,3,Vinny P.,"Philadelphia, PA",465,802,29
2.0,2/26/2012,"I've been here twice now. The first time being A-mazing (Summer, 2011), the second time (Winter, 2012) is the rating scheme that I'm using for the review I'm currently writing. I LOVED this place the first time, could not have been better. I felt transported into a new world, a true Harlem renaissance. The second time, not so much, and I'm afraid that this is the restaurant that this place has turned in to. From the moment we stepped into the place it was as if my friend and I were on a high speed conveyor belt. This place is popular, perhaps too popular to give the common folks decent service. We were in and out in under 1 hour. Not that a Saturday night provides fertile ground for audible conversation anyways. The din was a few decibels short of human pain threshold (okay, that's an exaggeration, but DON'T go on a Saturday, even if it's the only night you have off, if that's the case, well...there's always ear plugs...) I don't mean to sound grumpy, I just had such high expectations, and the space is really fabulous, albeit not the most acoustically robust.  Anyways, on to the food. The market salad was WAY overdressed. I'm not even sure if there were greens down below all of that dressing. Dirty rice and shrimp were actually quite nice. Deliciously spiced, lovely texture with the basmati and almond. For entrees (which were served immediately after our appetizers had been picked up) were pretty ""Meh."" I quite liked the blackened catfish which was tender and well spiced, but the fried yard bird was quite literally COLD IN THE CENTER! Someone's didn't attend their microwave 101 class in culinary school, or something. Okay, I understand that the kitchen must have been over-stressed on a Saturday night. It was VERY busy, but 24 dollar fried chicken needs to be heaven on a plate. PERIOD.Anyways, it was my friend's birthday so we went with their famous sweet potato doughnuts for dessert. Sadly these too were cold on the inside where the creamy filling needs to be warm and oozing with pleasure. These are doughnuts for crying out loud!As my experience in the Summer of 2011 was quite the opposite (pre-yelp membership, so sorry about the lack of review) I sincerely do hope that this restaurant has cycled back to their previous glory, but I do fear that with this kind of popularity comes an unexpectedly cold center.",1,1,0,Samantha C.,"New York, NY",230,79,13

The menu is an interesting fusion of Marcus Samuelssons version of soul food and pickled swedish veggies and the rest of his culinary background.   The mac n' cheese was divine, the pickled veggies actually very very good and cut the richness and the salad was excellent.  Cocktails were inventive and really tasty and well made!

They say that there is someone out there for everybody and I guess it's the same deal for restaurants.

4.0,2/13/2012,"My hubby took me for my birthday dinner, since I'd just finished Chef Samuelsson's autobiography, Yes, Chef, and was completely enchanted by his amazing life story.I was in love with the place from the minute we drove by looking for a spot - the outside facade and glance in to the hoppin' bar area were so inviting - especially on a flurrying, freezing night.  Walking in confirmed my initial ""like"" with fantastic, warm colors, a live Jazz band (Sunday night!) and a warm, friendly hostess (is this NYC or not!!??).  We sat for a bit looking around at the rest of the patrons - everyone was just so attractive and not-too-trendy, and the waitstaff all the same, it was a pleasure.  I can't say enough about at atmosphere - I didn't stop smiling over it the whole time.Unfortunately, our seats were moved after a few minutes to push tables together for a table that ended up not being used, but the staff was nice enough to remedy that with a free order of the scrumptions, chewy-with-crunchy-outside, steaming-warm cornbread.We skipped the overpriced drink menu, and dove into the food, starting with the dirty rice and shrimp appetizer.  I adored the unique mix of spices, crunch, sweet raisins, and cool yogurt.  It was unlike any flavors I've had, so very hard to describe.  The one sour note was that my husband got some kind of pepper or something massively hot, and was gulping water and eating the rest of the cornbread to recover (and he can do hot).  Something must've been left in after cooking.For entrees, he had the salmon with citrus sauce and long beans, which he loved, and he isn't always thrilled with salmon, so that was nice.  I found the peanuts+citrus a bit unusual for me to reconcile.  I had his grandmother Helga's swedish meatballs, and they were perfect - so homey and rich, with wonderfully sweet, tangy lingonberries, refreshing pickles, and a side of immediate-transport-to-sweden (I imagine) potatoes with cream and dill.  I was very happy, and he loved mine, as well.As a side we had the roasted squash with fried sage.  It was, for some reason, just okay.  Nothing special, we didn't even eat that much of it.  The best part was the pureed pumpkin with pumpkin seeds.For dessert I voted for the rice pudding, which was a very interesting take, with cold, thick rice pudding, heavenly pineapple in rum, and crumbled macaroons (that part I didn't love).  Really enjoyed overall, and a nice lightly-sweet finish to the evening.It didn't hurt to set the scene that Bill & Hillary Clinton were dining at a nearby table with a bunch of folks, and we were sitting even closer to a table of Secret Service, chowing down!Overall, it is a little overpriced, but I loved the complete package and would go back.",4,1,2,Jenny L.,"Fort Lee, NJ",5,57,0
3.0,2/12/2012,"George brought me here as part of my birthday celebration in December. We came in a little bit early for out 10 pm celebration on a Monday and the place was really hopping!  Live jazz, a bar full of people eating, sipping cocktails, laughing and talking, this was the place to be in Harlem! We sat at the bar and had a few cocktails while we waited for our table.  The singer could really belt it out and I could see how people in the area loved hanging out here.When our table was ready were were called back to the seated area.I have to say this was different from the area out front near the bar.  It was also really nice, but the vibe was different.  We sat down and ordered the cornbread and honey butter we were offered, which thanks to yelp, I knew was not free!  We already knew we wanted the yard bird as a main, but at the recommendation of the waitress we added the dirty rice and shrimp and the uptown steak. Everything was pretty good but the yard bird I have to say is the best.  It was juicy and perfectly fried.For dessert we had the malted chocolate tart and the apple caramel sundae and both were the best. The reason its a 3 star review is because the price is out of proportion to the food, as its good but not good enough to justify the price tag.  Also it is not insanely creative.  I have seen Chef Samuelsson cook on TV and I feel he is capable of belting out a more interesting menu.  I would come by if I was in the area for sure but to venture out again?  I dont know for sure.  I'm on the fence.  A 3.",0,0,0,Lama B.,"Brooklyn, NY",229,592,50

4.0,2/8/2012,"It's an uncommon thing to see a restaurant serve solid food and drinks across the board for drinks, appetizers, entrees, etc, and last night Red Rooster hit the mark for each and every thing we tried.The cocktail menu is not overlooked -- there is a good variety of unique drinks and flavors, including my favorite, The Spicy Lady, which includes jalapeño/rosemary syrup and tastes like jalapeño soda.For appetizers, we tried the cornbread with butter and tomato jam, and although the tomato jam was not my thing, the butter and cornbread were warm, soft, and delicious.My friend and I shared our entrees for dinner -- we tried the Fried Yard Bird and the Mac & Greens. The bird was great with the sauces provided, and I enjoyed how the mac tasted distinctly cheesy, but not overwhelmingly so.If our stomachs weren't so full post-entrees we would have gone for the sweet potato donuts, as we've heard good things about them from others who have been to Red Rooster, but we decided to save that for another time.The only downside to this place was that it was super crowded and our reservation was late by over 30 minutes, even on a Tuesday night. Granted, this was the day of the Giants parade, so that may have been a factor, but it did not excuse the glare we got from the women up front when we asked about the status of our reservation. The extra round of drinks on the house while we were waiting did make things better though, and we appreciated that they noticed our extra long wait and did something about it.All in all, I really enjoyed this place and have already made reservations to come back!",1,0,0,Liz K.,"Berkeley, CA",5,76,2

They weren't bad, I just wasn't a fan of the flavor or texture, but the other sides on the plate still made it a tasty meal. The yard bird was really flavorful, well seasoned. The dirty rice and shrimp is definitely my favorite, I loved the crunchy curry leaves in it. This dish is why I give it a high rating. Their red snapper is supposed to be really good, so I will go back to try that at some point.The decor is really cool, but the chairs are rather uncomfortable to sit in, at least for me, because you can't lean back in them.I like the restaurant quite a bit, but I don't see myself going here often because 1. it's really out of the way 2. the food is super-rich. If you're calorie conscious at all, you can't make a habit of eating here regularly.They only take limited reservations, and leave most tables open for walk ins.

1.0,2/4/2012,"Here's what I sent to Ted Rooster after my experience there:---Dear Red Rooster team,I usually vent my culinary disappointments or share great experiences on Yelp but I believe this warrants a more personal and direct approach. I apologize in advance for the length of this email. The tl;dr version is: the food was really not up to par.To put everything into context, my fiancée and I are getting married on October 27 and decided to treat ourself with special dinners at places we have never been in the city every 27 of the month until the wedding date.We had heard, read, seen many great things about Red Rooster Harlem and knowing the reputation of Mr. Samuelson as chef made us really look forward to the evening.We had a reservation for 5:30PM as there was no other choice on Open Table. I am still not sure why as two thirds of the seatings were empty until 6:30PM. But it did not matter; we were very excited about our meal. We even studied the menu online.If you don't mind, I'd like to start with the positive points of the evening. The service was amazingly attentive and friendly and the cocktails were well executed.The downfall of the night came from the food, which is never good at a restaurant.It started when we discovered that the country ham and cured duck breast on the online menu is not in the actual menu anymore. Instead we decided to go with the Mac & Greens. Being huge Mac & Cheese fans, we couldn't wait to taste the deliciousness of Gouda, Cheddar and Comté. Instead we had some overcooked pasta and a few greens swimming in a curdled cream broth that was not cheesy or stringy. The salad accompanying it was okay, not really great.I then chose the Fried yard bird. The meat was tough, overcooked, dry and yet not crispy as the gravy had been poured over the skin. The mash potatoes were nice.My fiancée, decided to go with the Maya shrimp over the steak. That was the final blow of the night:- The shrimp were over-seasoned, overcooked, dry and tough.- The plantains were literally inedible (dry to the point they couldn't be chewed)- The oyster cream sauce did not make it to the plate.It seemed as if the plate stayed under the heating lamp for a long while, which is surprising as we were the 3rd diners of the night.At that point, we just wanted to pay and leave so we skipped the dessert. I can't imagine going through another disappointment with the sweet potato doughnuts.Once again I want to apologize for the length of this email and wanted to know if, after so many of our friends had some of their best meals at your restaurant, we came during an off-night. It is hard to express how disappointed we were with the food, especially after paying a substantial check.I appreciate you reading this and hope you will take my comments to heart.---They didn't care to reply to it so it's going on Yelp.",27,8,4,Alexis M.,"Brooklyn, NY",18,105,6

2.0,1/27/2012,"The atmosphere is downtown, great decor. We arrived with no reservation. Since this is the new hotness of restaurants it takes a good two to four weeks to get a reservation at a decent time on Saturday night. So we arrived at 6pm. We sat at the bar for cocktails with the promise of a table in 45 min. The drinks were weird concoctions so I picked blindly and was happily surprised -- something with vodka ginger & mint.As promised we were called to our table in less time than we could finish our drinks. We had time to review the menu at the bar -- they give you the opportunity to eat at the bar if you don't want to wait --so when we sat at the table, we knew what we wanted: for appetizers we had dirty rice with shrimp & crab cakes, for entree we chose the white striped bass with okra.Once at the table, they offer regular bread or corn bread. We chose corn bread because they said it came with a spicy sweet tomato jam. Strike one. The so called jam was not sweet nor spicy nor jammy. Tasted like plain old tomato sauce. And to make it worse, when we got our bill, we saw a charge for the cornbread!!A little disappointed we waited for the appetizers. These are great portions. Can be considered entrees. The crab cakes were served with arugula, grapefruit, pomegranate seeds and a spicy creamy sauce. The mixture of all those favors were def a party in your mouth! Yum! Score! The dirty rice and shrimp? Strike #2. The rice had a tomato base making it red rather than dirty and the flavor was edible but not memorable. Wouldn't choose that again.The entrees fish was perfectly cooked and the okra was in the traditional dirty rice rue but the rice was not. Again the rice in this dish failed.For dessert the bourbon ice cream pecan pie sounded fantastic. I also got a latte. The latte is in the top coffees I've ever had in my life. The pecan pie's crust was soft, flaky and the filling was just perfectly sweet. I questioned the waiter about the ice cream. Bourbon flavor was non existent. Strike #3.As we were leaving, the bar was busting at the seams and a line of people negotiated with the hostess for a table.

4.0,1/24/2012,"Please note that my earlier review was for RR's opening night.Since opening night I have been to the Rooster a few times: brunch, dinner, drinks...once I even hit RR for lunch on a snow day for a burger.The drinks at the bar are delicious, and the bartenders are quite nice. There aren't many bar chairs so be prepared to stand on a busy night (ladies with high heels you are forewarned!) and rub shoulders with strangers. I don't recall what it is called, but I highly recommend the drink with muddled grapes and agave. Dinner: You will need to plan and make reservations. If you drop in for dinner or brunch they will try to seat you, but it can be a very long wait. The food is not served in huge portions if that's what you are looking for. The crab cakes, dirty rice, meatballs are all good. The mac and cheese is excellent! If you love fried chicken, the Yard Bird Chicken is also tasty. I also like the burgers - they will serve a proper rare burger if you ask. Brunch: The eats are all great. There is is a gospel group that performs on the weekends.The scene: Downstairs there is dancing (I think on Friday and Saturday), but I haven't been... even though I live in the neighborhood!

Of course at 9:45pm on a Friday night it was PACKED to the brim. We put our names down and were told it would be an hour. I expected as much without reservations for a Top Chef spot. While waiting to be seated, we ordered from their impressive cocktail menu, starting with the Rooster Punch which is way stronger than your Aunt Consuelo's sangria (you could really tasted the wine and it was delicious). My date had the Bird, which had hibiscus tea in it and I had something with muddled grapes and vodka, quite yummy. An hour later as promised, we were seated. We ordered the Jerk Bacon and Eggs, which was spicy and comfortingly delicious. We also had Shrimp and dirty rice which was much more Indian in flavor than I was expecting, but it was tasty. For our entrees we ordered the Fried Yard Bird, and the Mac and Greens. The yard bird was juicy and spiced nicely with curry and a kick from the spice shaker on the side. But the mac and cheese was divine. It had one of my fave cheeses, gouda (SO GOUD!), with arugula on the side, the orrechieti were the perfect vehicle for its cheesy unctuousness. We ended the meal with the fried sweet potato doughnuts, which were soft and sweet. I feel like they were filled with spiced apple butter and there was a vanilla whipped cream on the side.

3.0,1/8/2012,"I really want to love this place.  I live nearby and I love the vibe and the bartenders (and cocktails).  Unfortunately, the dinner we had last night was weirdly disappointing.   Our enthusiastic waiter recommended the cornbread and a ""chowder"" for two, explaining that the chowder is really a spicy tomato broth with tons of seafood, including a whole lobster -- more a variation on bouillabaisse than a traditional chowder.  The cornbread was pleasant, with a shape and texture more like poundcake than cornbread.  The chowder was tasty, but the whole lobster was nowhere to be found -- we got a tail and the body, but no claws.  When I asked the waiter about this, she seemed embarrassed and went to check with the chef, then returned to say that he assured her that he had put the claws in the dish.  She then fished out a tip of a claw -- all shell, no meat -- as evidence.   She said the the chef couldn't give us the missing claws because there were no more -- this at about 7:30 pm -- and gave us some extra shrimp instead.  The dish was good (and the shrimp were very good) but I remain unsettled by the missing lobster and the particularly strange way the chef handled it.   I fear I'm going to be suspicious whenever I return.",0,0,0,LE F.,"New York, NY",0,58,1
5.0,1/8/2012,"I went to Red Rooster with my girlfriend through the Mastercard promotion, and we had an amazing experience. For some reason Yelp had mixed reviews, but I always wanted to try Marcus Samuelsson's restaurant, and very glad that I did.We ordered the crab cake appetizer and Mastercard added jerk bacon and egg as well as cornbread and tacos & tostadas. So we had a large sampling of the app selection. Everything was quite good. Jerk egg was a personal favorite. For dinner I had the blackened catfish and my gf had the Sweedish holiday plate. The holiday plate was unbelievable. People at the table next to us got the Harlem chowder for two, and that just looked ridiculous. Massive amounts of all kinds of seafood. Definitely trying that next time.Mastercard also hooked up a desert, which was some sort of chocolate panna cotta, which did not disappoint.Overall amazing meal, great ambiance, and quite affordable for a celebrity chef restaurant.

4.0,1/4/2012,"The foodie in me loves when friends refer me to places they deem top notch. Last night while on my born day food crawl my friend had us venture to Red Rooster in Harlem, headed by Top Chef Master Marcus Samuelsson. I'll be the first to say I'm not a big fan of comfort soul food, but the dishes we tasted this night were quite delish. The night began with their version of a 'Gin & Juice'. The West Coast side of me was like man whatever' when I saw it on the menu, but after one sip 3 more were ordered. As my friend pointed out, them seem to get better each time (personally I think that's with any Gin based cocktail).Apps ordered consisted of: Oysters with Ginger Mignonette, Lump Blue Crab Cakes (pic above), and Jerk Bacon & Egg. I will say the Oysters needed a dash of salt to really pull you into the sea, they were stripped a little too bare for my palate. All in all, the apps were tasty and not too heavy. For our shared entree we had the Blackened Cat Fish & Black Eyed Peas, it wasn't the best catfish I've had but it was good. All around it was a great experience, and for a Tuesday night the spot was alive. Tuesdays are Latin Tuesdays at Red Rooster they celebrate the Latin flavors of Spanish Harlem.

4.0,1/2/2012,"A party of five for a mid-week prime time gathering is a perfect time to experience Red Rooster. After the first couple round of cocktails, I have to say that my favorite is the Earl of Harlem. Bourbon with Earl Grey tea made me feel regal.  Small's Paradise and the Savoy also frequented our table. For appetizers, we split an entree order of Mac and Cheese, and order the ""snackable"" sized portions of nuts with injera, the olives, pickles, and the (must have every time) corn bread! The tomato jam has hints of chocolate and chipolte pepper that complements the spirits, as well as the bread. Those that ordered and hoarded the pumpkin and turnip soup and crab cakes had handlebar smiles afterwards.I really wanted a steak. I inquired about the steak from our waiter. He passively did not endorse it. He did recommend the Catfish. Upon imposing the question about the steak, the eye contact confirmed it. If the most expensive entree cannot be endorsed by the waitstaff, who works for tips and check averages, in terms of gratuity, do not ""Go"" and do not collect $200.My Coconut Rice and Peas entree, however, was lukewarm. The Blackened Catfish and Yard Bird i tasted were dry. Maybe because, this was a packed house product. Maybe it was the qualitative best of the cooks this evening. Whatever it was, the entrees were lackluster.As were the desserts. Our sweet potato doughnuts were dry in the inside. The sweet potato goodness came out like a worm from an apple. The Black and White Mud did not stand out. It could have been store bought for all we knew.But the libations, ambiance, company kept, and timing of the food hitting the table plus the attentive and honest service was first rate.If your party is a more foodie crowd, they might not have the best of times there during peak hours. The food did not meet my expectation.  Drinking and snacking crowds will want to camp out. But reservations are abundant here.

4.0,12/25/2011,"I highly recommend Red Rooster for its drinks, snacks and scene. But dinner at this celebrity chef restaurant? Not so much.While our waiter was charming, the food was shockingly mediocre. As a $15 appetizer, the dirty rice and shrimp was just a few bits of seafood on a bed of brittle rice. At least the $22 fried chicken was decent (it's listed as ""fried yard bird."") The only thing mildly exceptional about it was that the chicken was free range -- which you don't see too often in restaurants that specialize in variations on soul food. But at these prices, we deserve something extra!A better bet is to just stick to the bar, which is insanely busy but great people watching. Plus, the drinks both look and taste good, especially if you like your cocktails on the sweet side. My favorite so far is the $13 Rooster Punch: Red wine, Navan liqueur, pear brandy and mango puree. By the way, some folks were nibbling appetizers or even chowing on entrees at the bar.

2.0,12/25/2011,"I came here on Christmas Eve bc my mother was in town from Oklahoma. I thought the food would be somewhat familiar, and that it would be festive. It WAS festive and lively, and the servers and bartender were really great. My problem is primarily the food. My mom and partner had the yard bird, which seemed great--they loved it. I had come in to have the Swedish meatballs. No luck. So much for it being a signature dish. For some odd reason, that wasn't being served that night EXCEPT as part of a multi-course pre-fixe that I didn't want (this was NOT the $25 Swedish Holiday Plate that I now see on the web site, which would've been fine). Sadly, I chose Steak Frites instead. This was shamefully sub-standard, particularly for $35. I mean, seriously. It was like having a frozen Stauffer's Salisbury Steak. Finally, there are a variety of fancified cocktails with infused liquors of various sorts that in the hands of someone else may well be fantastic. Not here. These cocktails, mostly $12-$13, are mostly just sweet bombs. This isn't cool for this level of a place. If they had a few classics perhaps, to fill out the menu a bit, that might be a step in the right direction. But the bartenders need to LEARN and TASTE their drinks. This area (cocktails) could use some real improvement. And seriously--they've got to STOP serving that shameful steak and the pitiful 3 potatoes that pass for ""frites."" Otherwise, again, RR is a festive place, and I'd go here again to hang out at the bar, or perhaps for breakfast if they ever start that. Great to have a nice place in the neighborhood.

4.0,12/22/2011,"So I was surprised that this earned only three stars. I will explain and perhaps the circumstances make a difference. I was meeting a friend because I am actually living in California and back for the holiday season. It was a Monday and we had no reservations. There was an hour wait for a table so we ate at the bar. Our bartender was the sweetest and gave great recommendations. My friend was able to check her giant work bag, she's a lawyer. I had the turnip spicy soup and the mac and greens. My friend had the dirty rice and the salmon. Everything was delicious! Nice mild to medium spice in the soup and a nice balance of sweet with raisins and savory flavors in the soup. I wanted the mac and cheese to be a little thicker. More cheese less creme, but despite the creaminess it was super delicious. He uses shells for the pasta not actual mac. The pasta holds the sauce like little cups. Very nice to the tongue. I tasted the dirty rice and it was super savory. The salmon was ordered medium and that was good because the clean flavor of the fish balanced the sweet and savory flavors in the sauce. We ended with the Pumpkin cake which was as light as a souffle. It was paired with cream cheese ice cream. This ice cream is super rich, which was fine for me, but too much for my friend. I think they should pair this with cinnamon ice cream or corn ice cream with cinnamon, Puerto Rican style. It was kind of like a deconstructed pie because there were these crunchies that tasted like really really good pie crust. There was even a nice pumpkin puree on the plate. Simply delicious. Now the band was VERY good. I must say we were seated quite close to them so we felt the cold when they were setting up because they kept opening the door right behind us. They did apologize though. The singer's voice was quite velvety. Just wonderful. The brass and strings were really great and of course the drummer was divine as well. When I say strings I include both the bass and the keyboard. Although the keyboard did not make as much of an impression, but we did not get to listen to the entire set. The brass players moved around the bar so everyone could enjoy and hear. They were very playful and fun. One negative was that the greeter told us that we cold sit at the bar and then let some other people take the spot at the bar as we went to sit down. Luckily two people were about to get up so we just sat next to the other ladies. Another girly plus is that the bar has hooks for purses and coats. We even saw the chef walk in, but he did not get a chance to come to our side of the bar.  Overall a great experience and close to multiple modes of transportation and shopping if you want to make it a day in Harlem.",0,0,0,A C.,"New York, NY",0,7,0
3.0,12/22/2011,"I have mixed feelings about this place.  Can we first discuss how cool it is to have a Southern Comfort food restaurant with a gourmet twist in the middle of Harlem? When it comes to the food, I would happily give five stars.  The mac and greens was perfectly decadent with Gouda, Cheddar, and Comte.  The greens complimented by adding bitterness to balance out the heavy creaminess of the pasta.  Other items we tried were the crab cakes, the yard bird, the whipped sweet potatoes, and some sort of pumpkin dessert.  I was definitely satisfied with the food and walked out having eaten way more than I intended.A major let down of the night was service.  Our waiter acted more as an order taker than as an active participant in the service.  He seemed irked when I asked him for recommendations and there were a few times when my dinner companion and I wondered if he had forgotten about us.  Another downside is the drink menu.  No doubt, the mixologist gets points for creativity and selection... lots of house infused liquors and handmade cocktail syrups.  Unfortunately, they didn't quite pull off the execution.  I tried the Dillio, made with Peanut infused Bourbon, Canton, muddled dill, and fresh lime.  It's not that the cocktail wasn't good, because it was drinkable but it just didn't wow my tastebuds like the description makes you think it would.I'd recommend trying this place on a weeknight when the servers may be a little less distracted, the food is worth it!",4,2,1,Alicia W.,"Austin, TX",115,78,19

3.0,12/8/2011,"I really, really, really wanted to like this place. I have been talking about going here for months now and finally, on a last minute invitation, stepped in on an otherwise dull Tuesday with friends. Though I can't say enough good stuff about the atmosphere (beautiful decor; even the bathroom is replete with character!), I find myself having little [good] to say about the food.I first heard about Red Rooster many months back when I was reading an article on it in the American Airlines in-flight magazine (lol). I was impressed not only did Rooster make it into the mag, but Samuelsson served up the Obama administration's first White House meal! How could the food suck, right?! Well, while I wouldn't say that my actual experience with the food sucked, I wouldn't say that is was worth the money or hype. We started with the corn bread, which was nothing short of SUMPTUOUS. I'll give them a hand for that--that has got to have been the best corn bread I've ever stuffed my face with. 5 stars there, save the tiny portion. I thought I would have been remiss not to order their special, the fried yard bird (aka fried chicken), but as it turns out, I think I should have stuck with my initial instinct to try the blackened catfish. The chicken was good, but not great. I expected magic here after all I had heard about this place!! Instead I got a healthy serving of much-appreciated dark meat with barely-above-average seasoning on it. really, I'd say that the colonel's recipe is tastier, though Rooster's is definitely less greasy and I didn't exactly walk out wanting to commit suicide for my gluttony. But still, I expected more from Harlem. We also got the mac n' greens. With mouth-watering words like ""NY cheddar,"" I did not think I could possibly go wrong with this one. Alas, like some of my fellow yelpers' comments, I found the mac to be runny, almost soggy. Flavor was good, but it didn't have anything particularly special about it either. No crunch. No special spice. Just some oroccheitte swimming in a sea of liquid cheese and an occasional vegetable here and there. Again, not terrible, but not White House worthy.Dessert: We got the black and white mud (love that name!), which was supposedly like a chocolate+cheesecake moose. Eh. I should probably have stuck with my first inclination to get the  sweet potato doughnuts, though I can't vouch for them at this point: As I have noticed, this place tries to create gourmet versions of simple junk food, yet fails to quite hit the note that distinguishes it from just plain, run of the mill junk food to high falutin' junk food. I'd say that the bar was the best part. Great live music, fun diverse crowd, good drinks. I think I'd go back for there for drinks, but as far as fried chicken and mac n' cheese is concerned, I'm stickin' to KFC and Green Table, respectively! ;)",2,1,0,Duncan G.,"New York, NY",47,125,0

We decided to try it out for Sunday lunch.It is super-easy to get to on the train, and we were there in no time!Even though we were there at 11ish, it was packed, and we needed to put our name down for a 45 min. wait, not having dreamt we would need to book!OK, we got a table; it was a 6 person share table with high stools near the front, next to the (big) amplifiers for the live music. Live music for Sunday lunch? Yes, but more on that later.Had checked out on-line the lunch menu, and also the brunch menu, and mentally decided that the brunch menu was the go.  Unfortunately, for us, the waiter denied the existence of a brunch menu, and gave us the lunch menu.This has a weird non-cohesive selection of dishes which did not scream lunch to me.My friend ordered what was essentially swedish meatballs, and I ordered the seared salmon on a bed of green beans, with a jus of some sort. We got some corn bread while we waited for the main event. Don't bother with this little money-spinner; it adds nothing to your meal experience.We wanted to talk during our meal, but this was impossible as there was an undeniably gorgeous black caberet-type singer (yes, at Sunday lunch!) at our elbow belting out some great music which would have been fab at 12pm, just not noon! She was being filmed, so she pulled out all stops, and was loud, loud, loud!, not in a good way.  So no conversation...I looked longingly at the still full outside terrace and wished we had waited for a spot there. The French couple at our shared table looked a bit non-plussed by it all as they picked over their hamburgers.The meatballs arrived, followed sometime later by the salmon. The verdict on the meatballs was just OK; I had a taste and knew I could make much better without trying too hard. Rather ordinary and definately overcooked we agreed.The seared salmon was WAY PAST seared, overcooked and rapidly heading towards dry! The bed of beans, few in number I might add, had started to shrivel, and the jus; not sure what that was, other than brown in color.In retrospect I should have sent the salmon back, as I do know what 'seared' looks and tastes like. I didn't, as we pretty much wanted to eat,  leave, and find someplace quiet for coffee and maybe some dessert.This place does not have to try real hard, and doesn't, as the diners keep on coming, for the moment anyway....I might give it another go at another time down the track, but for now its just 2 stars from me!",0,0,0,Glenn T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0

Did not have reservations, but got there at 6 on a Saturday night, and had to wait 45 minutes to get seated in the front section reserved for walk-ins. The seating area there is cramped - 6 stool seats to a table so we were sharing the table with two other couples. I would prefer more space, but the entire restaurant was pretty packed with a ton of people waiting for seats, and at the bar, so it didn't seem that bad. The energy of the place is great, and the decor brings a homey warmth.On to the food: we ordered the spiced pumpkin, turnip soup, yams and sweet potato puree, creole red grits, collard greens, and the Swedish holiday plate (includes meatballs, Jansson's Temptation - a potato gratin with herring).  We enjoyed everything we ordered, but really loved the holiday plate, and the puree, and I love all greens so the collard greens were a hit with me. As other diners have noted, the menu is somewhat an odd mixture of items, like Swedish meatballs and collard greens, but that didn't really bother me. We really loved the apple carmel sundae dessert - the combination of the bourbon caramel on the cinnamon cream on apple sorbet really worked and was not too filling after a big meal. One thing - I think they charge too much for their drinks - esp the beer and wine. They are charging $13 for a glass of wine when you can find a bottle of the wine for about $10 -15, and $9 for a Weihenstephaner Hefe Weiss seems high.",0,0,0,Christine N.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,10,0

I love when the kitchen is exposed while you dine, it always gives me a feeling of something freshness and gret chef-work. The shared table (which most aren't) that I sat at - pretty cool and unconventional, the music playing in the background had me snapping fingers at the table, the bar in the front was pretty cool to hang out at and the service was on point, but not spectacular. That all would result in 4 stars. The food...just a bit disappointing. If I ever hear about Mac n' cheese with greens cooked together that has a strange resemblance to velveeta cheese it will probably be in a nightmare- totally messed up 2 of my favorite dishes. Moving on, we ordered the crab cakes as an appetizer- acceptable, grits with chorizo- delicious, yard bird- ok. Is this the worst meal ever? No way!!! Ofcourse I'd eat here again, but is it worth the crazy rave reviews...I don't think so! After dinner, we headed downstairs and there was a cool lounge and great dj. It seemed to attract an older crowd downstairs, but everyone was a having a great time, a no- fee coat check was offered and although it was as good as lots of clubs that you'll pay a cover for, there was no extra fee.

3.0,12/3/2011,"Oh dear, Oh my.  So sad that such a world renowned and stunningly beautiful (albeit totes irrelevant) chef would have such bland food. First let me wind it back (like Beyonce) and talk about my apprehension with coming here. When I read about the C rating in the paper , my eyebrow went up and then when I read my fellow Yelper reviews I was really turned off, however we were in Harlem and wanted to check it out.  It is hands down beautiful inside.  There is a partition that separates the bar area in the front to the dining area and kitchen in the back.  We came around 11pm Friday night and it was super packed. They told us that the next available table would be in an hour and that the kitchen closed around that time so there was no guarantee that we would be able to dine that evening. We decided to try our luck and put our names down and have  a drink at the bar.  About 20 minutes later we were told that there were available seats.  Sweet.  I didn't think that the service was superb but it was pretty good.Now on to the food.  We ordered the yard bird (bland), mac and cheese (runny..convinced it was white shells velveeta), with collard greens (good), grits (really good) and the squash (pretty good). Considering all the hype, the food was really underwhelming.  We were seated at a shared table right by the kitchen and it was nice to see a diverse group of chefs at their craft or sha'll I say Kraft macaroni and cheese.  I kid, I kid.We headed downstairs to the lounge where there was a DJ spinning good classics for a crowd whose mean age was about 75.  I kid, I kid, again, but they were definitely an older demographic but I couldn't hate on them gettin' their dance on.So Red Rooster, cool for a drink and a dance with your grandpa.  Not so good for really delish food sadly.",10,13,7,Donna A.,"Brooklyn, NY",416,486,212

They really need more waiters for brunch. Everything took a ridiculously long time to get to our table. Makes no sense that the starter corn bread came out after our entrees and even worse, we got our cocktails midway into our brunch entree (both items ordered immediately after being seated).  We had the corn bread, hearth baked mac and greens (split as a taster among 3 ppl), the fried yard bird, lamb potatoe hash and the red rooster burger with truffle fries.The best best best out of all the entrees had to be the fried yard bird and truffle fries. The bird was ridiculously juicy, skin super crispy, and the meat had an enormous amount of flavor. Definitely will return to eat JUST the fried bird and truffle fries again.

2.0,11/27/2011,"I wanted to love Red Rooster and plan on going back to hopefully have an amazing experience, but for my first visit I have to give it 2 stars (that's being generous). This review is based on a dinner sitting in the lower level which I'm attributing to the terrible experience. My brother lives in the neighborhood and was excited for our parents (visiting from MN) to try Red Rooster. We were celebrating early birthdays and this was our ""special"" dinner of their trip. We arrived early to a bustling restaurant and bar, we found 2 seats and started with a few great cockails- I had ""The Earl of Harlem"" and we were loving the scene, the bar and dining room are gorgeous. The hostess led us downstairs to be seated in what looked like a banquet hall, it had none of the warm atmosphere and cozy bistro-like design of the upstairs. It was dark, low ceilings, no decor really, the tables are the kind you would rent for a wedding with cloths over them- very unimpressive. We mentioned this was odd as we sat down and the hostess told us ""it's for restaurant overflow"" funny since we made the reservation about 6+ weeks ago. We decided to get over in hopes that amazing food and service would follow. 45 minutes after ordering our drinks (this is not an exageration) they arrived, we ordered several ""snacks"" which arrived and disapeared before the drinks- the tuna tacos and the pickles (which were pickled vegetables not pickles regardless they were good). Finally the server acknowledges the unacceptable delay and sends a manager over who apologizes for the service. Next we ordered the ""ham"" which was really a delicious grilled cheese with gruyere and thin ham on the side with mustard and onion jam and the shrimp with rice. Fast forward to TWO HOURS after we were seated (this is not because we were leisurely enjoying multiple courses or drinks) our entrees arrived. We had tickets to a jazz club after and were late. Everyone enjoyed the entrees but they were completely overshadowed by the poor service. Again the manager came over and she offered to have us back for drinks and assured us this was not typical service and they were just trying this lower level out, nice gesture but not a good excuse. When the bill came were were charged for 2 dishes we didn't even order- which turns out the manager had tried to send over as a complimentary appetizer, however when the runner brought them he didn't say so and we said we didn't order it. So not only did we never receive the free dishes, we were charged for them! I will give it another try but urge anyone to make SURE when making a reservation that you will be seated in the main floor dining room. Hopefully they realize the lower level is not up to par to consider it an extension of Red Rooster. Yikes!",3,1,0,Amy J.,"Minneapolis, MN",16,75,0
2.0,11/27/2011,"We were really excited to finally try Red Rooster and were surprised when we showed up without a reservation and were seated right away. However, the much anticipated visit left us unsatisfied. The food was mediocre at best and it came out so fast (yes, that can be a bad thing) we didn't even have time to enjoy our cocktail. We drove all the way to 125th street for a 45 minute dinner. Bourbon Negroni cocktail: strong and tasty, 4 stars.Mac n' Greens: loved the idea of having smoky greens mixed into my mac n' cheese but it really didn't do anything special. Portion was small and I've definitely had better mac n' cheese. The side salad was the best part with a beautiful heirloom carrot, 3 stars.Red Caesar Salad: red because it has red romaine leaves in it. The description said a smoky vinaigrette and honestly this Caesar dressing didn't taste any different than the kind you get in a packet at a fast food chain. The whole salad was drenched in this dressing and covered in a blanket of finely grated cheese. No croutons or romaine hearts to break up the richness of the dressing and cheese. It also came in a diner-type bowl, which made it even less appealing. I get what they were trying to do but the salad was so bad there was nothing ironic about that. This was recommended by the server, not sure why, 1 star. Red Grits side: this was supposed to be a side of grits with chorizo, crab and shrimp. It was tasty but swimming in some sort of broth, so not your typical grits. Chorizo was nowhere to be found but I guess that's what was giving the grits their red color. I'll give this 3 stars.Sweet Potato Donuts: these are filled with sweet potato cream, the dough isn't make with sweet potatoes, just to be clear. The filling was cold, which I wasn't expecting considering these supposedly just came out of the fryer. They were just fine, 2 stars. I can see this being a decent place to stop in for a weekday dinner if you live in the neighborhood, but don't make a trip here from Brooklyn and expect an amazing Saturday night dinner.",0,0,0,Cregsty B.,"Chicago, IL",4,31,3

This place attracts a diverse mix of people - young, old, black, white, Asian, Hispanic, eclectic, conservative... you name it, it's in there and most of the people I've met there were friendly.  I usually don't like to go out alone, but Red Rooster is one of the few places where I can go to by myself and not feel strange or uncomfortable.  There's always someone interesting to talk to there!",0,0,0,Adrienne M.,"New York, NY",55,66,5
4.0,11/24/2011,"I'm being forced to start this review with a disclaimer.See, my boyfriend is a backseat Yelper who would rather interfere with my reviews than just write some of his own. And he emphatically feels that Red Rooster deserves five stars. According to him, the Yard Bird is ""perfect"" and his meal, as a whole, was ""surprising and exceptional."" But I wouldn't go that far. We came in a group of four (and weren't footing the bill ourselves, score!) so we gave into our gluttonous inner-selves and ordered plenty of food: corn bread with tomato jam and honey butter, crab cakes, Yard Bird, chicken Brunswick, mac n' greens, yams and sweet potato puree, and sweet potato donuts. And wine. Lots and lots of wine. (I actually wanted to try one of the infused-bourbon cocktails, but the man who was footing the bill ordered bottles of wine and I was soooo not going to complain.) I didn't try the crab cakes or the sweet potato puree (which has bacon), but I thought everything else was good. There wasn't anything that I'm going to wake up in the middle of the night craving, but it was all very satisfying. The highlight of the meal, to my surprise, was actually the little salad with pieces of okra (I think the okra was pickled?) that came with the mac n' greens. It was refreshing, tangy, and absolutely necessary to lighten up the cream-and-cheese laden pasta. I also loved the cornbread with tomato jam, but I do recognize that the price was high for the serving size. To be honest, I might have given Red Rooster three stars for the food alone. But the friendly and attentive service, the great atmosphere, and that yummy little salad kicked it up to a four.Hopefully I'll come back someday for the bourbon, but when I'm in the area I'd actually rather eat down the street at Mobay.",1,1,0,J K.,"New York, NY",225,161,134
5.0,11/23/2011,"We wanted to eat here and were able to get a 5:30 reservation last Wednesday night (I called a week in advance). We don't usually eat that early (!), but very much wanted to try it. We come to the city a number of times a year for business and pleasure. I checked the menu and it looked wonderful and then I checked Yelp and almost cancelled. Unpleasant staff, mediocre, over hyped food. Oh dear! Decided to keep the reservation and am writing to say thank goodness I did. It was one of the best meals we've had all year AND one of the best overall dining experiences from the moment we stepped in the door. Christian Post, the beverage manager, found a terrific microbrew on draught, Pearl Organic IPA, for us and gave us his card with all the particulars. Also helped select wine. The cornbread with honey butter and tomato jam is justly fabled and so rich, we could only eat one slice with everything else served (we were trying a lot of things). The Yard Bird was moist and the dash of cardamom in the crispy crust's seasoning was perfect. We learned the chicken, Long Island Red, is soaked in buttermilk and then put in a pressure cooker before the final hot bath. How anyone could describe it as dry is beyond belief. The mac 'n cheese with greens (collards and kale) was as far from Kraft's as you can get--complicated flavors from the blend of cheeses, but also true comfort food. Other diners were similarly pleased and this is one of the things that made the meal so special. It seemed everyone in the room was happy, big smiles and you could see people sharing bites.

And I don't even know where that line is - I just felt like referencing it in this review.Caveat: I heard from other members at the table that the steak was too tough and not tasty. I couldn't really pay attention to them over my own chowing down on the various parts of chicken that were on my plate. Seriously good fried chicken, seriously.I would go there again any Sunday night...or any night of the week. But the jazz made it an especially great atmosphere.

2.0,11/21/2011,"My BF kept talking about this place and insisted that if we were ever in Harlem, we should stop by for a bite to eat. Since he is the all-knowing of everything hip and cool, I let him take me on a late Sunday afternoon. Unfortunately, we had just missed lunch and was informed that the kitchen will be closed until 5pm to prepare for dinner. The hostess took our names and we waited at the bar. The bar was pretty cool. To the left of the bar were long wood tables. There was a huge bookshelf against the wall filled with books and nicknack  that looked like you were in someone's home. The  neo-soul music playing added a very cool vibe to the front of the house.Record-scratch- Ok. This is when stuff started to get real. A pretty pissed off customer approached the bar complaining that she has been waiting an hour for her food (she also stated a rep for Remy-Martin was part of her dining party and she was embarrassed - lol). As extra as she was, her sentiments were echoed throughout the night. It seemed there were alot of pissed off people who either walked out or was in the process of  reprimanding the staff. My BF and I were planning our escape, when the hostess came up to us and told us our table was ready out side. We were seated and waited about 15 minutes for waiter to take our order. I ordered the yard bird and my boyfriend ordered the salmon. We also got the sweet potato as a side dish.We were given complimentary cornbread with tomato jam that was decent, but not all satisfying. My yardbird consisted of a thigh and drumstick with collard greens hidden under the thigh and a smear of hot sauce on the side. The chicken was above average. The hot sauce tasted like tomato sauce and cayenne pepper. The collard greens were ok.My BF small salmon fillet was decent. The sweet potato was a big disappointment. I kinda felt there was so much that could have been done to make the sweet potato more flavorful rather a small amount of syrup and a garnish of bacon.

Not a hello, not a u can't be here. NOTHING! So we're looking at each other like, ""wtf do we do now?""

No. ""Ok, well u might want to put your name on the list so you can be seated as soon as possible"".. WTF!? When was she going to tell me that I can put my name on this list SHE NEVER MENTIONED!?

We opted out of that. If some1 came over to me while I was eating and told me I had to get up or leave bc some other person was here to eat I would have thrown a fit.

She asked if we wanted to start with some corn bread prior to giving us our menues. Of course we said yes. $5 later for the two pieces of corn bread that I could have done with out. She was too busy trying to explain to us that some broccoli naturally grows yellow and purple she didn't mention we would be charged for the corn bread. She could miss me with the science lesson. (I still don't believe that broccoli wasn't injected with any dye but whatever!)We had the dirty rice and shrimp as an appetizer. Tasty, but the spoonful we both had was not even satisfying. So now I had dirty rice in my teeth, maybe one shrimp in my stomach and my appetite was only getting larger.Only two fish options.. hmm.  I guess everybody else was having the bird they picked up out of the yard. That's fine. I had salmon and the funny colored broccoli. My best friend had the catfish (she loves catfish!) and some funny stuff. The salmon was tasty and I ate that colored broccoli. I don't care what gave it that color and I KNOW it wasn't natural like Dr. Sabrina tried to tell me. The cat fish was also tasty but soon the taste got a little strange. Some type of sauce or something they had on it. You couldn't eat too much of that. THE PORTIONS ARE EXTREMELY SMALL! All the money I'm paying.. feed me! People kept watching us the whole time. Staring, like we shouldn't be in there. It was so annoying. When we finally got the bill, about $80, there was some funny business, too! They took the card and the cash (we were splitting). Charged all on the card. FOOLISHNESS! Trying to keep money we didn't give them. We left unsatisfied. Still hungry.. we ended up at apple bees.

The seasoning was rubbed heavier in some places and very lacking in others. I ate it but didn't think it was sensational. One of my friends had the fried yard bird and she too said it was just ""ok."" How sad when the fried chicken at a highly raved about soul food restaurant is just ""ok.""

I've been there about five times in the last few months, including for two Monday night dinners, with live jazz.Last night we arrived and immediately were offered a table outside. That was a coup. The table had a perfect balance of street watching (who's that getting out of the Bentley? The 1%) on one side, and jazz on the other. It took a while to get an actual waitress, and more time for the cocktails. The table next to us did not get served at all for about 15-20 minutes. Listening to their wedding plans was excruciating. Really, a photo booth? How original. We fired back with an obnoxious phone call to my sister. We ordered three cocktails: the Smalls one, the Spicy Lady, and the negroni.  Inexplicably, the Smalls was spicier than the Lady. Both the smalls and the negroni were quite strong, spice- and liquor-wise. Spicy Lady was the most balanced.The cornbread rocks. The turnip soup was very tasty, I believe with balsamic vinegar. The green salad was alright, but a bit salty for some reason.Yard bird looks and tastes great. My father, unaccustomed to southern food, ate it all up. The striped bass suffered a stretchy skin, which made it difficult to cut and a little unappetizing, but tasted savory and a sweet mix of soft baby cherry tomatoes and veggies.

She gave me an attitude for fucking up my drinks...  So now my mouth is dry and I'm hungry..... still waiting for an hour... we finally get seated in the back.Problem #3- The menu should be CHOPPED. ITS A KIDS MENU.... There is nothing southern about the menu. The cornbread is a fusion of Jiffy Corn Meal Mix and Masa Tamale mix that tasted like it had been exposed to refrigerator air. I've had better cornbread from my easy bake oven.  Marcus should make the executive chef decision to work more often on the line before this ROOSTER TURNS BLUE. (RIP RED ROOSTER)Problem # 4 -The food taste like someone made an EGREGIOUS ERROR during preparation. I'm sure this stemmed from lack of training and understanding of Marcus's vision because I know AFRICAN BORN, SWEDISH RAISED, AMERICANIZED MARCUS would never serve soupy and under-seasoned anything. My so called cheesy  grits runneth over. I mean running over literally.... on the side of the plate and cheese gone missing... (JUST NASTY). We were so disappointed that we got comped desert.... and that was nasty too...PROBLEM #5 -The decor and ambiance is that of DINER, DRIVE -INS AND DIVES with no GUY FIERI.....it  just doesn't  match the price of the food.

2.0,11/13/2011,"I loved the biscuits, they weren't hot but were still delicious. My food was decent but for the price of the dish and reputation of the restaurant I expected more. The beans were a tad watery and the egg yolk was runny, not the greatest combination. The pickled cabbage was flavorful and definitely was a great addition to the plate. The jerk bacon was really pork belly rubbed in allspice. Although it was a nice cut of meat, I've had better.  The Fried Yard Bird recommended by our waiter as the best item on the menu, was the prettiest i had ever seen on a plate until i tasted it.The chicken's amazing crispy crunchy exterior gave way to perfectly cooked meat with no flavor at all, devoid of salt or any type of seasoning. The negligible dollop of hot sauce and gravy did little to really take away from the lack of flavor. The kale was bland, sparse and cool. The shake was basically paprika which I was not interested in shaking on my chicken after the fact. The cornbread was disappointing at best, and my cappuccino was more like a latte. The service was friendly but slow. It hurt to see chef Mike seemingly effortlessly churn out chicken platters to the pass beautiful and most likely as flavorless as mine.I would go back just to see if maybe it was a bad day.",0,0,0,Denise D.,"Bronx, NY",30,127,15

3.0,11/5/2011,"I am giving the Red Rooster a three star rating. Two stars are for ambience and decor. One star is for the food and service. We came to the restaurant wanting to like it. Harlem is a charming place and needs more restaurants like the up market Red Rooster. Unfortunately the missteps with the food and the confused service will make me not want to eat there again anytime soon. I may go again, just to the bar area, for drinks. The cocktails were expensive but very good. The food, on paper, seemed interesting, but in fact was weirdly executed. We were fortunate to get a brunch seating without reservations. A young pregnant woman took our orders promptly and then disappeared. She showed up again only at the end of our meal to give us the check. In between, we were served in spurts by the bus boys and cooks. The man who appeared to be the manager seemed preoccupied with everything except the guests in the restaurant. The first odd thing is that bus boys and cooks brought out our appetizers and entrees all at one time. There was not enough room on the table for all the plates. They then said they would take the entree plates back and put them under heat lamps while we ate our appetizers.I order Helga's Meatballs which were covered with a tasteless foam. Why the foam, I do not know. The meatballs were ok but not worth the price. The dish was over salted. My friend's mother ordered the Lamb & Potato Hash. She kept complaining the dish was salty and tasted strongly of cinnamon. My friend ordered the Rooster Scramble Eggs and said it tasted good but nothing special. I venture to guess the problem lies with management on the floor and in the kitchen. The cooks who served us seemed to be hard working and caring guys but they may not have a feel for the type of cooking they are doing. They may be use to comfort food/soul food cooking. However, the menu presents a twist on this and they may need guidance in order to execute the menu properly. I suspect there was no one in the back controlling the quality of what went out.Again, the guy who appeared to be the manager was not managing the floor.

1.0,11/2/2011,"I can't really review the food, because of the 4 times I've been here, we've only been seated for dinner once. This last time, my GF and I stopped in early on a Tuesday, asking what the chances of getting seated were. We were told if we came back in about an hour, we could probably be seated in 20-40 minutes. I should have paid more attention to the word 'probably'.After the usual cooling of heels at the bar, checking with the host, cooling heels more, re-checking with the host, he then promises me that the next two-top has my name on it. I bully my way to the dining room and see that there are only 3 two-tops in the place. (WTF? Shouldn't a restaurant have at least a third of its tables dueces?) Anyway, one of the 3 has a bill on it and the couple looks like they may be leaving in the next 10 minutes. Back to cooling my heels at the bar again. Since no one from the restaurant is making any advances to us about the table I know is mine, I fight my way back to the dining room where I spot another couple being seated there. 2-1/2 hours after I first spoke to him, I go back and ask the host, ""what happened to the table that had my name it?"" He tells me that although the table was indeed mine, he gave it to Commissioner Kelly who had suddenly come in without a reservation.I understand that this is a no-win situation for me and the house absolutely did the right thing--give the table to the A-listers. But the annoying thing is that this type of service (or not as the case may be) appears to be the norm at Red Rooster. And I will not be putting myself in the position of receiving that abuse again.Having said all that, I still really want Red Rooster to be a success because it's good for the neighbourhood.

First of all I arrived at 5:55 for our 6:00 pm reservation. The hostess was rude and could not find my reservation. She finally finds it and tells me she will seat me shortly. After 20 minutes I go back and ask if there was a table yet and she asked me if I had checked in with her previously. Seriously? I read that this nonsense has happened to many other Yelpers so I was not completely shocked it happened to me but you would think they cold get their shit together and get their reservations right. Come on. Yes you are beyond popular now so act like it. After we were finally seated I was not impressed with the food. The portions are really small and overall the food is not that great. I will admit the corn bread was tops as well as the dirty rice and shrimp. Again though I felt like I got a bite of each and it was gone. Unfortunately the entrees were not great. My pork loin was way overcooked. It was dry and barely edible. The others at the table had the striped sea bass, and two orders of the meatballs. All of the food ordered was uninspiring.

You'd think this dish would be impossible to mess up but this version made me realize that every other one I'd had before was a pale shadow of Red Rooster's.  We also loved the other apps, in particular the dirty rice and shrimp - if you don't get this you're missing out big time - the smoky char on the shrimp and the crunchy rice are really great.  The mains sadly didn't live up to the apps. The meatballs, while leagues ahead of lean cuisine or IKEA versions, seemed somehow too safe.  I'll also say that the drinks disappointed.  The ingredients on the menu sound awesome: earl grey, spiced coriander syrup, peanut-infused bourbon, jalepeno/rosemary....but I was left uninspired by any of the drinks we ended up with.  None of the exotic ingredients came through.  Perhaps they were just going for an exceedingly balanced drink but why bother with the crazy infusions if the flavors are so muted?  Finally, as others have noted the service was uneven and rude in one instance.  The hostess couldn't find our name right away and made us feel like we were imbeciles.  So when she found our names, no apology, no ""yeah I guess you guys weren't idiots after all...""  This isn't the welcome that customers should be getting, regardless of price point.",3,0,0,Adam C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",218,146,12

Marcus Sameulson has dabbled in several failed restaurants since Aquavit and I'm hoping year 2, Red Rooster will come together.My friends made reservations a month in advance for my birthday and you would think making reservations would guarantee a seat at the time you requested and confirmed.Unfortunately, when our party arrived,  there were no tables available.  I understand it's Friday night in a hip restaurant but the wait shouldn't last more than 1 hour.Our hostess, pleasant and professional, tried her best to appease my friend who was a little upset about the run around on the wait time.""Just another 15 minutes.""  or  ""We're still waiting for a table of four.""Waiting at the bar was a nightmare since you get a mish mash of clientele. A group of women after I asked them politely if they can let me in so I can grab my drinks refused to move.  Another gentleman (if you can call him that) bumped me as he squeezed his large frame to place his drinks instead of asking me to move aside.  My friend had to talk to him as I gave him the death look.You can't blame the restaurant much for the shitty clientele that night however, I was not impressed with much of the menu that was offered that night.I ordered the Grilled Pork Loin and although the serving size was immaculate, there's not much to write about it.  Is this Southern comfort food where you would at least have some inspiration to infuse some spices in it.  I felt l was eating a bland meal.My friend, who offered to share part of her blackened catfish, definitely had more flavor in it and wished I ordered it.  She's always spot on with ordering the best dishes so next time we go out, she'll just order all of mine.However, drinks were pretty good yet you can't go wrong with Bourbon.   I had a couple of Browntoners: which were nutmeg infused bourbon with Cherry heering and St. Germaine.  I think the others had East of Harlem, which consisted of bulliet bourbon,  earl grey tea, and spiced coriander syrup, and the Rooster Punch which was the red wine, navan liquer, pear brandy, and mango puree.We ended the night with Whisky Fudge, which I thought was the most inspiring dish of all but again, you can't go wrong with Whisky and Fudge!Would, I come back?  I would give it a few months and see the menu in the Spring/Summer since supposedly they have suckling pig.",3,0,3,Neline S.,"New York, NY",177,422,208

I ordered the fried yard bird and it was very fine, and although I'm not a huge fan of an all-dark meat chicken dinner, I understood the premise and thoroughly enjoyed my meal. The cheese grits were ridiculously cheesy, and delicious. All washed down with a Prohibition Ale or two, it was a fine birthday brunch.Our server sounded European and a little frazzled by the crowds.

What he's offering isn't good soul food at a reasonable  price and giving back to the community as he said in several interviews.

Taking as much money as he can from the small portion of the NYC landscape that can afford to pay his ridiculous prices for food that is marginal at best.

The only thing I can agree with some other reviewers is that some of the food is a little over salted, but this is supposed to be southern comfort food- which is typically on the saltier side, so I didn't mind.After hearing that the portions were on the smaller side, we ordered a ton of food- bad idea, the portions are huge.Snack:  Corn Bread with Tomato Jam and Honey Butter- perfect startApps: Country Ham- this is basically a glorified gouda grilled cheese with onion marmalade. the country ham is similar to a prosciutto, but a bit smokier. the two spreads were great. We would have been better off with out this app, not because it didn't taste great, but because we had too much food.Mains: Fried Yard Bird- this was the two biggest portions of thigh and drumstick portions I have ever seen. The Shake and hot sauce are a great combination and the chicken is crisp on the outside and tender in the middleGrilled Salon- Miso glaze, citrus broth goes together perfectly with the light peanut crust.Sides: Creole Red Grits- this was the one dish I think was too salty, but when you combine crab, shrimp and chorizo into grits I guess you should expect a salty dish. I thought it was pretty good thoughYams and Sweet Potato Puree- had a very interesting taste and was not too sweet.Dessert:  Apple Caramel Sundae- nice twist on a classic with the apple sorbet, very good.DISCLAIMER- we don't typically eat this much, took half our mains and sides to go.Overall I had a great experience, the atmosphere was great, the crowd was diverse (lots of tourists), the presentation of the food was well done.

It all started with some corn bread, yes that's right, good ol' cornbread and honey butter-- 2pieces.  So me and my best friend had our cornbread and honey butter.  I don't like cornbread but I ate it because I was starving.  Before that we had arrived to red rooster around 3pm.  We walk in and nothing.  Literally nothing happens. There were people at the oversized bar having cocktails.  No body said a word to us as we stood there.  Finally some guy, who clearly takes his sexuality to the max (I don't care who you sleep with), comes over to us and stares.  A woman accompanying him asked what we were there for. What the eff do you think were there for? I told her we wanted to be seated and she said we'd have to come back at 5 when dinner was being served.  Fine.  So me and my best friend walked around Harlem starving.  We had saved our appetite all day with the intentions of having lunch.   So we get back at 4:50.  We walk in, stand there again and no one says anything to us. 4:55 rolls around....still nothing. 4:57...4:59...5:02. now people start walking in.  They fly right around us.  I walk up to the hostess stand and let her know were back _as if she didn't see us) and that we'd like to be seated.  This DUMB BITCH asks me and my friend if we have a reservation!! I thought boy this lady must be high.  The next thing were told by the sexually frustrated hostess guy is that he can only seat us on the side tables because if  he put us in the restaurant part we'll have to leave by 6pm to fulfill peoples reservations.  This could have been prevented earlier.  Clearly we didn't have a reservation if we were there with the expectation to be seated at 3. If the asshole hostess told us we would need a reservation, or at least let us know how they operate at Red Rooster, it would have made the overall experience a tad bit better because it only gets worse from here.Now we finally sit. AND back to the cornbread.  Our waitress Sabrina (before we could even look at menu) asked us if we wanted to start with a drink and some cornbread.  We said we'd just take some water and yes to the cornbread.  We ordered our appetizer: the dirty Creole rice. Small portion but it tasted real good. It was jasmine rice with shrimp.  Next we got our entrees. From The 6 meals they offered we could only have two since neither of us eats meat.  My bestie got the salmon and I got the catfish.  The entrée portions they serve aren't even the size of a normal appetizer at any other restaurant. Our pieces of fish were soooooo small.  That's all they give you; a piece of what ever type of protein you order and some other crap that's not even edible, really...the chef told us.The whole time we were there we kept getting these looks like we just weren't good enough to be eating in Red Rooster.  Hello?!?! We're in effin Harlem, home of the clap. My money is just as green as the next guys.  They left the from door right open, parallel to the stupid side table we had to sit at, and closing the door was a big problem. Ok...time to go.  No thank you Sabrina, I would not like to waste any money on dessert, we'll take the check. Check comes (here's where it got ugly).  First I see a $5 charge for cornbread. Now at this point I'm ready to get all full blown gangsta because I'm angry.  We didn't even want the cornbread. She asked if we wanted some cornbread to start like the shit was free, so obviously were gonna take it. I know its only $5, but it's deceiving and we hadn't even received menus yet.  What got me most angry is that my friend put in cash and I put in my debit card.  She charged the whole thing to my debit card and then wouldn't bring back the cash. Instead she wanted to refund the whole amount and recharge me for original price.Seriously I don't know what the fuck goes on here. I've never been to a place that was more unorganized with such a rude staff. Our 80 something dollar bill was such a complete waste of money.  We could have easily eaten a whole other meal after that (which is what let us to Applebee's shortly after). We left Sabrina ZERO tip. I will never bring business back to Red Rooster again, nor will I give them a good word!",18,28,1,Sonny G.,"Queens, NY",2364,435,1223
3.0,10/12/2011,"Damn, Jim. If this is your idea of affordable, I need to get on your money making schemes. While I can afford $10 for 2 baby croissants, 2 baby slices of pound cake, and 3 muffin bites, I don't know that it's even reasonable for what it is. $4 for 2 slices of cornbread (small)? in Harlem? where such things are in such abundance? I can afford it, but why? We stopped by for brunch at 11:30 on a Sunday, no wait, seated immediately between 2 ugly couples (stay outshinin', what can I say? It's a rock star lifestyle being this sexy), and presented with 2 dinner menus by the hostess wearing patterned nylon. GIRL, can you do anything right? Took 5 minutes for our waitress to come. We started with cornbread, which was average. The honey butter was a nice idea for someone like me who likes to add some additional sauce/spread to anything possible, but cornbread really shouldn't need that. I had the fried yard bird. When I propose popeyes at 11am, my boyfriend looks at me like I'm mentally handicapped, but this morning he was all, yeah, get the yard bird. I mean, whatever's necessary to justify eating fried chicken before noon, I can do it. The chicken was delicious and the hot sauce and gravy were both really nice additions, but the collard greens? Have you ever had bland collard greens? I am a veggie loving kid and never protest greens, but I did not eat the greens here. I'm not sure it was even salted. C'mon son. He had the French toast, which was also good. The bread was almost pastry like and very substantial portions! I enjoyed the nutella whip, but again, those garnishes feel a little affected. I don't know that they were all complementary.Coffee was 2.50 and refilled once. Not badOrange juice from the bar tap for $4? egregious.

He's a NYer so he'd already been and was kind enough not to comment until I checked it out myself so as not to taint my review. So here it goes. Bar scene 5 stars. I've never seen such great specimens for people watching clustered around one watering hole. Fabulous. Food I'd give it about 3 stars. I may be biased because I know home-cooked soul food. This is definitely a fusion. I had the blackened catfish and the black eyed peas. The catfish was just... meh. The black eyed peas were so good I ordered a bowl. I tasted my bf's Yard Bird (friend chicken) and it was pretty good as well. So solid 3 stars for the food and 5-star bar scene. I'll be back.,0,0,0,Tamara W.,"Los Angeles, CA",47,82,31

1.0,10/1/2011,"I almost never write reviews, but I was so disappointed by my experience at Red Rooster that I feel compelled to. My date and I were excited to check this place out and were fully expecting to have to wait, especially considering we did not have a reservation. When we got there the hostess quoted us 45 minutes which we were completely happy with. After an hour and a half, the bar was packed to the brim and we went up to the hostess stand and expressed that we totally understood that they were busy but wanted to know if we had a chance of getting sat in the near future because otherwise we would try somewhere else. We were told they had a place for us.... so we fought our way through the five deep bar crowd after the host and landed at ""our table""...a communal cocktail table in the middle of all the chaos. Such a disappointment after waiting over an hour and a half. We had to yell to hear each other and our server...the bar crowd next to us was extremely rowdy - we witnessed one man black out and fall over as well as a fight start to break out. While we were trying to eat, people continued to put their drinks down on the table, which was not only gross but also really limited the 1 ft by 1ft of space we were granted. Our ""neighbors"" at the table were asked to kindly get up because they had been nursing drinks for over 3 hours (asking someone to get up in this situation is completely acceptable) and they started to argue and yell obscenities. As far as the food went, the cornbread was about the only good thing of the night. Otherwise, the crab cakes were mediocre at best, the salad had potential, if it had been dressed and both the catfish and the salmon were nothing special. We declined dessert in an effort to leave as soon as we could. I work in the f&b industry, at one of the best restaurants in manhattan.

Just could not get past the overly salted chicken.  I would also consider a small dollop of something creamy (mashed potato, mac, or parsnip puree) with the chicken as the greens were not enough to satisfy the soul and balance the saltiness, if that is how they do it on the regular.  I know bowls of sides are available but $23 for a thigh and a leg, one could smack lil extra love on the plate.  Everyone is a damn critic today but I think I'm making sense.  Want this place to be successful!  About time we had a place to chill at in the hood.  3.5 stars in the end, I'll be back to give it another whirl as that catfish dish looked proper.",0,0,0,Dimitri S.,"New York, NY",63,230,336

3.0,9/17/2011,"Restaurants like Red Rooster are beginning to get on my nerves.  It's not necessarily that the food is bad in any objective sense.  My blackened cat fish was fairly spicy (though someone from New Orleans would ask for another coating of the spice mixture, assuming it had been forgotten) and well cooked (the gentleman sitting next to me at our communal table thundered, ""No sushi, you hear?"", and there was no danger of that with the well-flaked catfish) and it sat atop a bed of flavorful collard greens and black eyed peas.  (although what the cold, doughy, almost inedible fried pickle was doing next to do I couldn't tell you).  My drink, ""The Brownstoner"", the kind of astringent cocktail I always order, was a credit to the restaurant, and it's too bad that my wife's otherwise excellent roasted pork loin was a few degrees to the stringy side of done.  So what's my problem?  Basically that I don't understand why places have to be so twee and overwrought, so scenester without substance.  Take, for example, our $9 ""snack"" of ""tacos and tostadas"" we ordered to nibble with our cocktails.  For such a price, one would expect at least a somewhat substantial dish, enough to share. What we got was literally two quarter sized tostadas topped with a dimeful of fish, and similarly tiny crisp tacos.  What am I supposed to do with this?  Why is it $9?  Similarly,why are those without reservations left to teeter on shaky high table near the bar?  Do only people with reservations rate comfort?  And why is a cocktail at a restaurant in Harlem $13?  I can go to specialized cocktail places for a superior drink for the same price, no? It just all sits wrong somehow, poisoning the otherwise competent food.

So we decided we wanted to sample a little bit of everything, so we got the chicken and waffle pre fix that came with chilled yellow tomato-coconut soup and strawberry shortcake-cookie desert, the shimp and grits, crab cakes and a bottle of wine.The apps were simply delicious, the soup was really tasty even when it is served chilled like a gazpacho. The crab cakes were the best, and the shrimp and grits although small in portion had great taste and texture. The chicken and waffles were disappointing. For $35 (pre fix)The waffle was too crisp and overcooked, dare I say burnt? The chicken was good, but not out of this world, no where near hill country's mama els recipe...but the sauce at least was homemade and spicy-delish. We asked for more sauce to make up for the burnt crispy chicken. I feel like the executive chef pays attention to the sides and they train some idiot who burns the entrees. The syrup for the waffle was good too, love and attention with maple and bourbon, not sweet at all - try it!For the prices of the entrees, I'm surprised they dropped the ball on entrees. Not worth the $$$$I even saw marcus the chef-owner saying hello to some folks, and it confused me for a second because maybe he wasn't watching over our waffles and that's why the were burnt....All in all, I will return but only order the sides! If I want chicken and waffles I might as well go to sylvia's next door...",2,2,2,Sarah Z.,"Manhattan, NY",33,44,19
4.0,8/19/2011,"I really wanted to like this place more than I do but, they drop the ball when it comes to entrees. If you go in for drinks & apps, you will love this place. Their is an incredible vibe full of happiness, success, & excitement. The bar is happening & you'll definitely see a celeb, politician, or some one you recognize. But, hey, where else would you see all of them gathered at the the same time uptown? Like the NY Times writer said, I saw a diverse crowd in regards to ages, incomes, ethnicities, fashion, locals & tourists, singles, families, etc. Great mix that you couldn't get better anywhere else. Everyone was laughing or smiling & having a wonderful time. I've never seen a restaurant except, at the tony ones in Soho in the 1990's with a better type of energy. It was simply electric.  I went down there, yes, I'm further north in Harlem, with a group of 5 and the drinks at the bar were a little slow. They were busy so, I understood. Mojitos were very good.  A lot of people were eating at the bar which is a good sign. The bartender suggested a few apps for us to try at the table. We didn't have to wait long for our table, another good sign. A glimpse of Marcus Samuelson wadling through the dining room upped the excitement of the evening. The server was excellent. She was patient & answered all of the questions we had about the menu with aplomb. She was extremely professional & utmost courteous. We really felt welcomed from the moment we entered the door to the time of our departure.   We had the crab cakes- too die for, the country ham (my favorite), & dirty rice & shrimp. I can't remember the other 2 apps. For entrees: I had the lemon chicken, hubby had the steak frites, someone else the catfish & we were all slightly disappointed. Other people have told me that the entrees were dull, boring, over cooked, not up to par, etc.   My suggestion, stick with the apps since the entrees dissapoint. Marcus needs to make a choice: lower the ante on the apps because they were so very good or my & everyone else's suggestion-make the entrees stand out (give them some va va voom). I'll definitely return hoping that the entrees are better next time around.",2,0,0,Elizabeth T.,"Manhattan, NY",346,24,6

The bass and the chicken were the best.To end it all, we ordered the summer shortcake... drizzed in amaretto. Delish!  The bill was about $150 total (w/ 1 more cocktail added) + tip.  All in all the food was really good and I'd come back.  We liked the atmosphere, but the service was only so so which is why I took away one star.",0,0,0,Jennifer L.,"New York, NY",22,38,4

3.0,8/9/2011,"I want to like it. I've said that before... I wonder if the chefs of the restaurants I want to like would come to my job and give me a good review because they want to like me? Prob not. I'm hovering between a 2 and 3 stars because some of the things that happened were OK and some meh. My friend and I got there at 3:30 last Sunday. I had looked at the website which said that brunch is served until 4. When we arrived the waitress told my friend that brunch ends at 3. When she told her that it said 4 on the website, and saw the looks of confusion on our faces, she said that brunch was still being served until 4 at the bar. OK.We sat at the bar and had a nice enough server. His mom was sitting next to us at the bar. She was nice I guess. He took our food order and then our drink order. The food came out in less than five minutes. before he could give us our glasses of house wine (the house wine was listed on the menu at $7 - I'll come back to that).The obvious problems that arise with food that has come out quickly because it obviously has been sitting there and clearly would have been thrown away had we not come in arose. Our food was pretty cool in temp. I had an omelet that was supposed to have spinach in it - that's what is listed on the menu. It had chives in it. I like chives so I was OK. My friend had cinnamon raisin French toast. It was also cool but tasted OK otherwise. While eating a server came up and asked if he could clear our plates. We told him no thanks and kept eating. Once we were finished eating our plates sat and sat and sat. The server we had had left with his mom he left her plate right there too...interesting. The hostesses asked if we had dinner reservations. We're the same two who just wanted brunch an hour ago so no...thanks though.When we went to pay we were charged $8 for the house wine despite the listed price of $7. The server comped us one glass and said that there were some old menus floating around. That was nice enough but I expect to pay listed prices so really it was the least he could do. We hung out there so long waiting for our plates to be cleared that I started to get hungry again. I realized that's one of the side effects of eating an omelet with a tiny biscuit. The lack of potatoes or any starch to anchor the meal left me hungry. We ended up leaving and going to Dino BBQ and eating again. I don't eat a lot so the fact that I had room for a whole other meal two hours later says a lot. All in all I'll probably try again for happy hour. Maybe dinner. Service was scattered but I guess I was served most of what I wanted so I'll stick with 3 stars. If they mess up though...2 ** it will be.",3,0,0,Mama G.,"Manhattan, NY",3,19,5

3.0,8/7/2011,"On a recent trip to NY, I decided to hit up Red Rooster.  I saw Marcus Samuelson on Top Chef Masters and lived for Harlem in 6 years, so I was excited to try out his flavors as well as see what the spot was doing to my old hood.    The 3.5 stars that this place has got at the moment pretty much hits the nail on the head.  I came on a Wednesday afternoon and sat outside and took in the wonderful, bustling ambience of 125th street in Harlem.  No joke, some dude robbed the store next door to us, ran off, and came back 10 minutes later handcuffed by undercover cops.  Current Harlem and all it's idosyncracies, gotta love it.  Back to the food . . .  I started off my meal with a bowl of watercress soup with chilled crab and a cocktail called the brownstoner.  F---ing amazing.  The cocktail had nutmeg infused bourbon, cherry heering, St. Germain.  Get this drink, cause it's awesome.  The soup was phenomenal as well.  They always say you can tell how good a chef is by the way he prepares a soup, and this soup was fantastic.  My next course I ordered the lamb and sweet potato hash.  Now, I will segway at this point to talk about service, which was a very weak point.  While my server was earnest, the service was just bad.  The couple next to me had finished their yard bird by the time my food came.  I finished my food, and still no one had come to bus their plates.  I had to stop a bus boy and order a glass of wine halfway into my entree, because my server hadn't been over in 10 minutes. My server came over, I ordered a glass of rose (assuming he'd get me the $7 house rose, but when I saw my bill, he charged me for the $14 glass of rose) That aside, my lamb and sweet potato hash was better conceptually than in its delivery.  Solid dish, but nothing memorable.    For the dessert, I ordered coffee and doughnuts and they were fantastic.  Soft pillowy doughnuts, filled with a deliicous coffee cream.   When the bill came, I brought up the issue of the rose with my waiter, and he quickly changed the bill to the $7 glass of Rose.  That aside, the $14 glass he gave me was awesome, and if you like rose, it is well worth it.  The restaurant is trying to be like downtown/ midtown NY spots and it well has the potential too, but it's service needs to get more sophisticated.  It's 3.5 star rating is pretty accurate, but I'm giving it 3 stars because i want to see them take it to the next level.  This place has the potential to be the premier Harlem spot.  Some of their dishes had flashes of excellence, but it falls short in other aspects.

2.0,8/3/2011,We went here for my birthday - it took nearly 6 months to get a reservation. - we had been trying since it opened. We were going to be late (very late) for the reservation because of a family emergency but they assured my husband that they would accommodate us. I guess it depends on what they mean by accommodate......After waiting more than an hour they seated us at a bar table. My husband complained and they said they would move us in 5 minutes and they never do. I guess accommodate means BS - all they did was BS us - if they had said they did not have a table (because we were late) we would have lived with that. The service was nonexistent. Appalling actually - except for the person who comes by and asks if everything is ok - The food was pretty bad - Red Cesear - what the heck is that supposed to be.

3.0,8/2/2011,"Red Rooster is trendy spot in the heart of Harlem that specializes (purportedly) in a more refined version of soul/comfort food. While aspects of this were certainly evident on the menu (mac n cheese, fried chicken, grits, etc.), the overall theme/concept of the place seemed a tad confused to me (oysters, crab cakes and steak frites all make an appearance as well). Because the menu didn't really come together in any sort of cohesive way, my expectations were a bit jumbled: Should I expect fine dining, or just well executed southern fare? Unfortunately, Red Rooster missed both marks for me.Realistically I think this place probably deserves a 2.5/5.0, but I'll be generous because of the great ambience and overall vibe of the place...We started with the corn bread which was, as most have previously stated, awesome. Warm, savory, and delicious. I didn't particularly care for tomato jam, I think this dish is best paired with simple butter.We then moved onto the chilled yellow tomato soup. Instead of being a refreshing dish befitting of a muggy summer night, the only real discernible flavor was that of the spicy sambal- everything else was effectively lost and as a result the flavor profile was very unbalanced. I then moved on to the fried yard bird: Despite the rather clumsy presentation that was more befitting of Fred Flinstone than urban professional, this dish was relatively successful for me. Skin was very crispy and not particularly greasy. Could have used a bit more seasoning, but a seasoning mix is (oddly) served in a separate shaker along with the rest of the dish. And then, we move on to the red grits: I wish I was articulate enough to describe just how salty this dish was. After looking at the menu online for purposes of writing this review, I just discovered that there were apparently crab and shrimp in the grits... In all seriousness, I had absolutely no idea that this was the case. Literally this thing tasted like a pile of salt. I'm really not sure what else to say.In general, I find it odd how binary the ratings on this place are... some give it 5 / 5, others 1 - 2 / 5. Given how supposedly talented and experienced chef Samuelsson is, I wonder if the success of the dining experience is mostly predicated on whether or not he's working the line that particular night... I have a near-impossible time believing that he would taste the grits that were served to me and give the server the thumbs-up for pickup.  Just a thought... maybe I'm still bitter about paying $10 for a glorified salt lick.",2,1,0,Steve D.,"Boston, MA",1,10,0
5.0,7/30/2011,"We opted for an early Saturday brunch today to avoid the crowds and enjoy a breezy outside table on a swanky lenox corner. One of the highlights was the moist buttery corn bread served with home made tomato jam (which reminded me of chutney) and fresh buttter mixed with olive oil.  The mac and cheese is a signature dish and looked fantastic, but we didnt try it.  I ordered the meatballs with foam, mashed potatoes and sauerkraut, which were delicious and surprisingly not heavy. Perfect portion size.   This is NOT the place to order an omelette (it was so so) as the entrees were far better than the standard brunch items.  We sat next to owner Marcus Samuelsson, who is a hip guy and was being interviewed about the business, which is clearly one of the trendiest in Harlem.  There was a great dj as well.",0,0,0,Jeremy F.,"New York, NY",218,8,25
3.0,7/30/2011,"My mom was dying to go to the restaurant, so we made reservations an entire month in advance. I was really hoping it was going to be a fantastic experience since we had to wait so long just to go. The front of the restaurant is very nice. We went for dinner on Friday night arrived at about 6:45, our reservations were not until 7:30 pm so we had to wait around for a bit. There was no seating at the bar, this place was paced. Nice scene for after work happy hour, or just to socialize and have drinks before moving to another location. When we finally were able to sit, I was surprised by how small the seating area was. Certainly not enough room for all the people who frequent this place. We sat towards the back kitchen area. I was very surprised to see a communal tables. We had to sit in the middle of two different groups of people. A couple on one side, and three older women on the other. All of our food on one long table. I was really not in the mood to socialize but I knew I had to because I did not want to appear rude. However, the people were very nice, and even offered to share some of their food and drink. Very nice. But I didn't not want to share my food or drink, but I felt that I had too since they offered it to me. The food was Ok. Not really impressed. I have defiantly had much better tasting cornbread, I think I can make my own cornbread and it will taste better. I had crab cakes, dirty rice and shrimp, and a side of sweet potatoes. The only thing I really enjoyed was the rice and shrimp. It is really good, and the tiger shrimp were cook to perfection. I did not like the sweet potatoes at all, would not order that again. My mom had the yard bird which she enjoyed, collard greens looked a bit dry, I think my mom's collard greens are a lot better.

Our server, Natalie was awesome.Friendly, attentive and not only explained the menu but had thoughtful suggestions and recommendations. We went with the corn bread (fabulous tomato jam) and the tacos and tostados. These were bite size but soo flavorful. I had to have the yard bird and hubby went vegetarian with the garbanzos n veggies. We couldn't agree on dessert so we had the black and white and the sweet potato filled donuts. Crazy yummy. I had the Paradise cocktail which was fantastic and I would have had many more but the price was prohibitive. They had added something called the Harlem Chowder for two to the menu that looked phenomenal. A paella pan filled with seafood that I am going back for.Hubby felt the price was excesive for the portions but I will definitely go back to chill at the bar during happy hour and to have that seafood dish before the summer is over.

5.0,7/18/2011,"I went for brunch on a Saturday and loved absolutely everything about this place!  The food was fantastic, the service was quick and pleasant, and the atmosphere was laid back and comfortable while still fairly sleek.Between my food and that of my companions I was able to try a good number of dishes and loved each one more than the next.  The mac and cheese with collard greens was very satisfying, and came with a bright salad on the side to balance the heaviness of the pasta.  The scrambled eggs are light, airy and perfectly seasoned with fresh herbs.  The cornbread is amazing- not too heavy, just slightly spicy (warm, not hot) and wonderful with the honey butter or the tomato jam.  The two stand outs from our table, however, were the lamb and sweet potato hash, which seemed almost like a blend of a hash and a mild curry, as well as the biscuits with red eye gravy.  These were unlike any biscuits and gravy dishes I have ever had in my life- not heavy or flavored only with pepper as with your typical white gravy, but instead had a deep, complex and layered flavor.  To me, Red Rooster also seemed a good value for your money.  Some dishes are served in smaller portions than others, but the portion size of the smallest (the lamb and sweet potato hash) was still plenty large enough not to quite finish, while that of the largest (the biscuits and gravy) was easily large enough to share among two people.",2,1,0,Amanda R.,"Chicago, IL",5,54,0

4.0,7/12/2011,"FInally got over to eat here for a birthday brunch. I had a preview tasting with Epicurious a year ago, so I knew sorta what to expect fried-chicken-and-mac-and-greens-wise, but I wanted to see the place, and dine in the space.Waiter, Ephraheim, was real cool. Funny. New Yorker tip-desperate, but in a cute way. The way the bus boys rolled their eyes at him, I figured he was eccentric. Pick him if you can.Nice that you can see the kitchen, and its dedicated cooks, preparing, shouting, dealing with heat and kitchen drama. Kinda felt bad they had to work, while I sipped on a drink.I ordered a Spicy Lady cocktail. Gin, jalapeno/rosemary syrup, lemon juice and creole bitters. Don't frown, it was awesome. Pink, with a nice lil kick, and livened me up for the rest of the meal. $13 seemed a lot, but for the originality of it, and brunchy appropriateness, I didn't mind.Bread on the table made me mumble under my breath about starch and carbs, but I did manage to cut off a piece of cornbread. Lovely perfection. Heavy, buttery, yet light and able to work with the honey butter or tomato jam on the table. I could see it   on plate in a puddle of maple syrup, but that's probably my own diabetic dream. The lingonberry mini muffins, mini croissants and other breads, I didn't try, but I did see 2 people at my table fight over a croissant.My main dish was the Lenox Smorgasborg, to which Ephraheim gave me a hi-five. fabulous gravlox sprinkled with caviar and red onion, smoked trout salad on a mini bagel, creamy n yum-yum, country ham sliced thin like prosciutto with a plop of country mustard, and pickled veggies, baby carrots, okra, onion. It was a perfect summer brunch-ish dish, everything done well, and with attention to flavor and texture.Free whiskey fudge was brought to the table, and not many people liked it. It was too bitter, sorta grainy, and the nuts didn't add anything to the taste. A couple of folks at my table told the waiter to keep that off the menu, and filled out a comment card about it. yikes!I had a scoop of chocolate ice cream. My reward for being carb savvy, and to end my meal with a smile. HEAVENLY. Best ice cream I've had in years. I'd go back just for the ice cream. I do not know what made it so incredibly good. just get it. It was $3, but I'd pay $10.BTW: The restroom was sooo nice! felt like peeing in my fashionable grandma's house. painted all antique white, auto-flush, pedestal sink, and piped in music. The walls had old photos from the 60's, 70's just taped up, no frames, of people, who knows who they were, not sure anyone knows, I never asked, but I instantly thought I would do that in my own bathroom, cuz it added such a homeyness, and warmth.Nice place.

4.0,7/11/2011,"Let me start by saying that I am usually not at all a fan of chicken.  I will eat it, if I must, but to me, it is the vanilla ice milk of meat: uninspired and rarely memorable.  Let me also add that as a semi-sheltered Asian girl raised in the Midwest & now living in Hawaii, my exposure to Harlem has been limited to the Globetrotters.  On Scooby Doo.  (Sad, I know).  With that being said, when my fabulous friend Rebekah suggested we have brunch at Red Rooster in Harlem during my visit to New York, I was intrigued.  And when both our charming, but verbose waiter and Yelp reviews recommended the Yard Bird, I knew I had to try it.  So Rebekah & I split the Yard Bird and the Mac & Cheese (& greens).  The Yard Bird has single handedly changed my entire opinion of the potential of Chicken.  It was brined, pressure fried and AMAZING!  It was juicy, flavorful, and unlike any chicken I've ever had.  It was served with gravy & hot sauce- both of which totally added to the experience.  The Mac & Cheese & greens were also delicious, the corn bread was mind-blowing and the drinks were s-t-r-o-n-g! The service was good, the people watching from our outdoor seats was the best, and my view of both chicken & Harlem have forever been changed.  I only knock off one star because they never brought out the shrimp for Rebekah's Bloody Mary, but otherwise the whole experience was DIVINE.",1,0,1,Jennifer T.,"Honolulu, HI",81,11,42
3.0,7/11/2011,"Liked the restaurant alot.  I was pleasantly surprised with the size of the wine list and after dinner cocktail list.  The food was very good (I suggest the crabcakes, snapper, collards and coffee donuts).  The atmosphere is pretty cool but it is definitely still in the 'NY Hotspot' period where it is too crowded (Saturday night).  This leads to the only drawback where we felt quite rushed while eating.  They were obviously trying to turn their tables due to being so crowded.    I would make a return visit but will definitely wait for the initial hotspot period to die down.  If you live in the immediate area, you should definitely put this on your dining list for lunch or weekday dinner to avoid the crowds.

Do yourself a favor and end with the sweet potato donuts and coffee & donuts. Both were out of this world.The cocktails are a bit too expensive in my opinion, but there's a lot of variety. The beer list is also surprisingly large. Service is pretty average, but you won't feel like complaining about it.

I'm sure I even overheard a hushed conversation about a meeting with some guy called Barak.Had the yardbird which was nice, not overloaded with extras. Just well cooked chicken with a damn tasty crust. The sweet potato doughnuts oozing with cream filling however were incredible. I could eat three or four servings and then happily head off to meet my maker. Really nice service. Cool interior. Hip crowd.

3.0,7/8/2011,"I was soooo looking forward to this place, despite some so-so reviews from acquaintances.  My friend and I sat outdoors.  No reservation was needed, although it was quite busy and lively, especially around the attractive indoor bar.  Being originally from Harlem, and having experienced soul food, it takes a lot to make soul food wow me.  Although I was not displeased, nor was I wowed.  To start, we had the crab cake appetizers.  They were very tasty, and well-seasoned.  Definitely not for people who like their foods bland.  My friend ordered the blackened catfish and black-eyed peas.  The fish was prepared appropriately, and placed atop the peas.  The problem was that the collard greens were cooked to a mush.  I suppose this was intentionally done, but I like to recognize what I am eating, and overcooking and reducing to a forkful of brown/green is not good.  The cornbread was delicious, but the tomato jam did not do anything to complement it.  The grilled asparagus was a bit dry.  The fried cheese patty that accompanied it was too flavorless to add anything to the asparagus. The creole red grits were good, but although I could TASTE the shrimps, I couldn't SEE them.  It was as if they had been pulverized!  Perhaps if the grits had been cooked to a thicker consistency , the dish would have tolerated shrimps with some integrity, instead of having just imagine they were in thereI know its not cool to criticize Marcus Samuelsson's restaurant, but I have to call it as I see it.  Some people and media sources are making a bit deal out of Red Rooster not because of the food, but because it supposedly is bringing downtown folks (hum, does that mean white people) up to Harlem.  But Harlem has many fine restaurants and they will remain enjoyable no matter what ethnic groups come to them.  Having a diverse crowd may be comforting for some people, but it does not make a restaurant more cool or chic.  So if you want great, memorable food, I don't think this is the place.  But if you want a Kumbaya moment, and want to feel way-cool, this is the place.",1,0,0,Wendy R.,"Goldens Bridge, NY",6,14,0

Place smelled amazing (cinnamon bourbon, I think?) but I went there to eat, so the scent doesn't fool me. Had 7:30 pm reservations and had to wait over 30 minutes to be seated. Service seemed contrived- everyone was trying too hard or not nearly enough. Nicest (genuinely) person there was the sweet gentleman who cleaned our table. Ordered Hearth Baked Mac and Green= greasy and flavorless...where was the gouda?? I also got the impression it was sitting under a heating lamp. The greens were not cooked, more like a salad of mustard kale (just in case you're thinking collard greens). Boyfriend had the catfish, which tasted great, over black eyed peas, but the portion was measly. No need to skimp on catfish, it's not that expensive! Corn bread was amazing!! Definitely get that and slather on the honey butter. The couple next to us seemed displeased as well...complained about their chicken and also didn't like the mac and greens.

Seating in the restaurant is odd and poorly laid out (too much space is given to the bar at the front of the house and bar dining); it was also loud, very warm, and too brightly lit for dinner. Our three week reservation netted us communal seating in-front of and in the flow of kitchen traffic.  to compound things, I am recovering from a shoulder surgery and wasn't in any condition to have staff shuffling around behind me all night long. The host allowed us to seat side by side which seemed to fix things.  We ordered.  Seemingly fine.  Five minutes later, somebody came over and coldly told us that we weren't allowed to sit there and that the communal table was ""only for sitting across from each other"".  Further we were told that we could finish our drinks but that they were going to move us. [note: train your wait staff on not creating problems.]We got up and left.  Life is too short for terrible dining experiences and rude staff.  Fortunately, Chez Lucienne is next door.  I'd been wanting to try Chez Lucienne for some time.  We had a great meal and a vastly better wait staff experience.  My wife had a delicious steak fritte and me a nice poulet roulade.  Topped off with a sane Paulliac.  So, the lesson to be learned is if you aren't vibing the hyper-publicized, vainglorious swing of Red Rooster then know that dining sanity is just next door.  As a Harlemite, I no longer have need for careless upscale restaurants.  I can get my taste of ""downtown"" over on FDBlvd.-1 Red Rooster.",2,0,1,Eric L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,16,4

I had to send my food back to the kitchen three times, the wine did not arrive until we almost done with our entrees, the service was erratic at best, the previously scrumptious blackened catfish, cold and unappetizing.  It was clear that when busy, or they have a large party (there was a party of about 14 also dining) the RR is unable to cope with the stress. The third time I went, sat at the bar - food was alright. Not as great as the first time but nothing to complain about either.

Most of the super negative reviews are just a bunch of Haters. There is a ton to like here. Don't dock a restaurant 2 stars because you made a reservation a month out and expected the moon.

Granted that's not saying much as there is very little competition. Please do not mention 67 Orange (holy crap that place is WAY overrated). Red Rooster focuses mostly on their infused Bourbon's and has some great originals. Personally, The Dillio is the best thing on the menu (Peanut Infused Bourbon, Canton Ginger, Lime and Muddled Dill). Close runner ups include the Brownstoner (Nutmeg Bourbon, Cherry Herring and St. Germaine) and Big Red Rooster (Cinnamon Bourbon, Dolin Rouge, Averna and Orange Bitters). The Peanut Bourbon is amazing though, and I had a Peanut Bourbon Old Fashioned made off menu that was just awesome.Cons - It's a restaurant bar, and as such the variety of bottles is somewhat limited. Earl of Harlem Cocktail looks like it's stirred but it's a shaken drink with Lemon that is not mentioned on the menu. Drinks are downtown pricey but not quite at the level of a good downtown cocktail bar.FOOD:Pros - Food tastes pretty bangin! First of all, the Fried Chicken Caesar is a total revelation with Smoked Vinaigrette and a Runny Egg on top.  Also love the Fried Yard Bird. Good Fried Chicken with an almost candied crust. The Mac & Cheese is delicious. The cornbread is unbelievable. The Meatballs are very tasty as well, and I love the lingonberries that come with it. Best of all is probably the Whiskey Fudge for dessert, which is intensely packed with flavor and topped with Macadamia Nuts. We also enjoyed the Coffee & Donuts. Overall, not one miss on taste.Cons - Yes, it's pricey for the portion sizes. The Meatballs (you only get 6) and Cornbread (2 pieces) are probably the biggest offenders here. Definitely coming back when I hit the neighborhood. If nothing else, I would come here repeatedly for that Caesar, Peanut Bourbon, Mac & Cheese, Cornbread and Whiskey Fudge.",30,9,20,Ryan M.,"New York, NY",392,259,53

Although we were only at the bar section, the dinner plate items look good. From one dinner claiming that we have to try it sometime. Marcus came from Aquavit which I enjoy and now Red Rooster got it going on! On top of that, Marcus himself came out to greet the customers which I think is splendid! Totally a place to hang!

2.0,5/23/2011,"While the ambience, energy and live music were outstanding, the food was lost in the middle of an identity crisis. Is this restaurant a diner? Soul Food? Fine Dining? Our table ordered the entire menu and while some dishes were very good (short ribs), some were frankly inedible (mac-n-cheese, collard greens, striped bass). Everything seemed to have an unnecessary and detrimental flourish, while some items were plated on diner dishes and some were composed formally. In addition, it would have been nice to get a basket of hot, steaming biscuits when we sat down. Instead, we got two miniature pieces of hard bread and a bizarre and unappetizing chickpea spread. A restaurant sets certain expectations when advertising itself as ""soul food"". If it fills these expectations, great. If it changes one's perception with its creativity, even better. Unfortunately, Red Rooster neither delivered a comforting soul-food experience, nor any sort of innovation or creativity. Mediocre fried chicken with a sumac tomato sauce is still mediocre fried chicken.",0,0,0,Jacques L.,"New York, NY",2,16,0
5.0,5/22/2011,"Red Rooster is one of the hottest restaurants in town.  A reservation 3 weeks in advance will still have you eating after 9pm, and even then you may get ""bumped"" by a celebrity patron.  In our case, it was Questlove.  In all honesty, these are not the kind of places that I am inclined to like very much, but this place offers up amazing food at a really affordable price, so like every mere mortal, I anxiously await my turn in the very long line to eat here.  It really is worth the effort.  The restaurant is small, and the space is nearly evenly divided between the animated bar up front and a choice collection of tables (some communal) in the rear all set before an open view kitchen.  The bar doesn't require reservations, so it is considerably more crowded.  The clientele are generally well-heeled, smartly dressed, and squarely middle-aged.  The bartenders mix up an intriguing list of cocktails, that are delicious and worthy of attention.  The eponymous ""Big Red Rooster"" ($14) was surprisingly smooth and astoundingly good.  Who can error with cinnamon-infused bourbon?  Add to that Dolin Rouge, Averna Amaro, and orange bitters, and you have an instant classic.  Eventually we were called to our seats, and had a gander at the menu.  It is notably short, but the selections are strong.  We decided to begin with 2 appetizers:  the oysters with ginger mignonette ($10) and the corn tacos and tostadas ($10).  The oysters were fresh and delicious!  Interestingly enough, they were served with a surprise vodka shooter which I have not encountered before.  Better yet were the tacos and tostadas.  They are quite small and easily managed with a mere two bites apiece, but what amazing bites!  The yellowtail and salmon contained within were very fresh.  It's strange, the preparations were conventional, but the taste was anything but.  That is what is great about a skilled chef, able to make the most of every bite.  Great texture and flavors throughout, leaving you wanting more.  For the main course, I had the blackened catfish ($23).  This was an exceptionally well crafted dish that was engaging on several levels and looked beautiful.  The catfish had great color and texture and was well seasoned in such a way as to enhance the dish without obfuscation or dominance.  It rested on a bed of black eyed peas that were mixed with celery root.  Great idea.  Another surprise?  The use of fried pickles.  I loved the delicate walk between comfort food and fine dining exemplified in this dish.  The flavors harmonized, and it was simply a joy to eat.  Clearly with this run-up, dessert could not be missed.  So we decided to share the Black and White Mud ($8).  Even this was amazing!  Chocolate cookie crust, chocolate fudge, vanilla fudge coming together to make for a rather rich dessert.  That much would have made it good, and perhaps forgettable.  Garnish it with coarse sea salt and candied ginger, and it becomes wondrous.  Honestly, my first bite registered a sweet, rich dessert, then there was a second wave with the salt coming through, and then two seconds later, that wow moment when my mind registered the dish as a whole.  Oh my goodness, this is really quite good.  How do you top an amazing meal with amazing cocktails?  Well, Marcus Samuelsson himself came over and shook my hand and posed for a photo with my girlfriend.  We also saw him actively working in the kitchen which is a rarity for known chefs these days.  As good as it gets folks, reserve a table at your earliest opportunity.  Strongly recommend.",18,10,18,Jim U.,"Washington, DC",690,1303,3044

5.0,5/20/2011,"This is the hot spot in Harlem where you find a cosmopolitan variety of trendy up and comers mingling at the front bar.  It was packed and hard to get a reservation at a decent hour (we got a 9pm reservation that we made weeks in advance). I can see why there is so much buzz for this place. It's quite the hot spot.  As we waited in the bar area to get seated, Questlove from The Roots zipped by with his date and got seated.  Then I looked to my left and bam Chef Marcus Samuelsson was there mingling and mixing with the diners.We were seated and settled on a few appetizers (the oysters were my favorite!) also the tacos were pretty good too, albeit small, but perfect for snacking.  I skipped getting the Yard Bird and went with the catfish and black eyed peas and I am so glad I did! It was like a flavor explosion in my mouth!!  I cannot even describe how amazing everything tasted. I was really impressed and to top it off, I got to see Chef Samuelsson in the kitchen (we sat right in front of it) as he was tasting food and inspecting it before it went out.  Now, who wouldn't love actually seeing a celebrity chef working in his kitchen. That was a plus and maybe the food tasted so good because of it.We also decided to get the mud pie for dessert and let me say, this is perfect to share and just fantastic. The mix of texture, sweetness to savoriness was on point.  As I was about to take a bite of my dessert, who comes to our table but Marcus Samuelsson himself. I gush and say what a fan I am of his, he shakes my hand and graciously agrees to take a photo with me. That basically made my night.  Of course, I'm going to give it five stars! Food was not only living up to expectations, it sort of went beyond it and the icing on the cake was to be able to give my compliments to the chef in person.  Highly recommended!",7,6,6,Natasha U.,"Washington, DC",283,615,413

The service was amateurish, but that was nothing compared to the food coming out of the kitchen. The grits were lukewarm at best, and flavorless. The ""jerk"" bacon was not very jerky. The ""mac and greens "" were swimming in cream, but not much cheese. Worst of all was the sweet potato puree that tasted like it was boiled in Hawaiian Punch.

4.0,5/17/2011,"I was privileged to have a wonderful culinary experience at a new restaurant that hadn't even opened to the public yet. I know, cool right. To think that I considered not going in order to focus on my half marathon training. That thought left my mind quickly when I considered the Chef that's name is a attached to this gem in Harlem. Here's a hint, 2 words, Ethiopia and Sweden.   Most recently, Chef Marcus Samuelsson, born in Ethiopia and raised in Sweden is best known for his winningthe Top Chef Masters on The Bravo channel. He isa world renowned chef, and the youngest chef to receive a 3-star review from The New York Times (at age 24). The fact that his name is connected to anything related to James Beard(named ""Best Chef: New York City"" by the James Beard Foundation) was reason enough for me to make the trip from Jersey to Harlem in rush hour traffic.Needless to say just knowing those little tidbits, I was not missing this Monday evening event. It was a star studded event with Cicily Tyson in attendance and Chrisette Michele performing, to close out the evening. But I must say, the star of the night was Marcus Samuelsson's food.Though the space is not finished, with exposed drywall, and unfinished walls, the place was jumping with excitement and anticipation. The evening began with cocktails served in the basement of the restaurant. Mini-mini fish tacos were passed, as well as shooters of what tasted and looked like butternut squash soup. Following the cocktail hour we took our seats and the food experience began. I have shared the complete menu for the evening below. I could go on and on about this food, but what you need to know is that if you are in Harlem when Red Rooster opens, you need to visit.Red Rooster will be a space that is unique to several of the other restaurants in the area.There will be a breakfast cafe, communal table, horse shoe shaped bar, and grocery. The basement will house a jazz, gospel open mic type experience as well as cooking demo's and classes.The executive chef of Red Rooster is Andrea Bergquist bringing experience from other famous eatery's like Tabla, Merkato 55, and Gramercy Tavern.AppetizerCrab CakesLump blue crab, spiced mayoPickled BeetsManchego, spinach hazelnutsM'hudi Sauvinon Blanc 2008EntreesFried Yard BirdWhite mace gravyRoasted SalmonApple cider glazeOne World Pinotage 2008SidesHerbed Couscoussmoked Collard GreensMac and Greensroasted CauliflowerDessertAssorted Red Rooster Dessertsred velvet cupcakes, donuts dusted with cinnamon sugar with banana fillingSeven Sisters ""Odelia"" Bukettraube 2009Taste big Dream BiggerFoodieengineer",0,1,1,Alycia M.,"Bloomfield, NJ",212,72,30

2.0,5/17/2011,"The overpackness of this restaurant, we came right before it got crazy.  Though they didn't want to seat us at their regular dining room we had to sit at the bar area, squeeze in between two groups of people, and sit like 6 inches in between them @ one table.  It was weird because I was on a date with my lovely boyfriend and I'm sitting next to 2 older ladies on one side and a father and son on the other side.  I guess I should bring out the awkward sex talk in front of these ppl haha.Other than that, coffee-OK, I had the mac and greens, which was decent, mac & cheese I've had better. But the Greens were good with a mustard vinaigrette. My boyfriend had something like lox and cream cheese on a piece of flat bread, pretty amazing, but wayy overpriced.  It was like 2 little pieces made up pretty.  Then I wanted dessert, I got the fudge.  UGH literally the size of pennies and I paid so much for it.  It wasn't bad, but you couldn't taste it!!

5.0,5/16/2011,"After an urban hike in the wilds of Riverside Park, my amiga and I were hungry for a bite to eat when I suggested we continue our walk to the Red Rooster. Grabbing two seats at the horseshoe-shaped bar just north of 125th Street, we immediately ordered a couple of beers (Sugar Hill Golden Ale and Southampton IPA) and started soaking in the atmosphere at this Harlem eatery. The walls were adorned with art and mementos reflecting this neighborhood's role in American and African-American history -- while certainly powerful the decor was subtle enough that it didn't knock you over. Five stars there. After ordering a couple of dishes to share, we chatted with the folks sitting around us, which included a family of three generations and their 91-year-old matriarch, who told us the secret to staying young is having some bourbon (Jim Beam, to be exact) while watching ""the ponies run at the Kentucky Derby.""Our food arrived and we both agreed that the Fried Yardbird (2 giant pieces of beautiful fried chicken) and Helga's Meatballs served with truffle fries were winners. As my chica said, ""If you weren't here, I'd dive into the meatball gravy and sip it with a spoon."" Fully satisfied from a great meal and dining experience, we laced up our sneakers and headed back into the wilds of NYC.

3.0,5/15/2011,"Glitz, Marcus, and a cornucopia of cuisines...Red Rooster's got it all, and after dinner here, I had these impressions:1. It's worth taking the subway up to harlem for a visit (or multiple visits) to RR. RR is not the case of a restaurant that seems unique b/c it's the only one of its kind in its neighborhood. It's unique b/c it's the only of its kind in new york...just look at the menu. While RR's price point is more midtown/downtown than uptown, I couldn't think of a place that had the amalgam of soul, swedish, ethiopian, and fusion dishes that RR did. RR gives you the opportunity to take a comfortable first step into a cuisine you may have been curious to try...and yet if you're not in the mood, it still has mac and cheese, doughnuts, and FRIED CHICKEN2. There's a definite buzz here on a saturday night...there's a reason why we had to make a reservation almost a month in advance. I walked in and the attractive semi-circular bar in the front was packed with people waiting hours for tables to open and to catch a glimpse of marcus doing his thing in the open kitchen. The buzz also had its drawbacks, the biggest being that despite our reservation for 8 people, we still had to wait an hour and deal with unapologetic hostesses. 3. The must-eat dish is not the fried yardbird. We shared several dishes including the fried yardbird at dinner and the one that sticks out to this day is the chicken and the egg...pulled chicken, spicy sauce, seared foie gras, and ethiopian injera bread served in a cute cast iron plate with a fried egg on top. it was the one dish where the fusion of cuisines unanimously succeeded, and the flavors of all the elements were as bright as the bulbs shining in the front of the restaurant. An unforgettable dish that outshone the fried yardbird (which was solid), the mac and cheese (a little too crusty and dry), and even the small doughnuts stuffed with sweet potato creme.",3,0,2,Eric K.,"New York, NY",62,159,26
4.0,5/9/2011,"Red Rooster's strong suit is definitely its atmosphere. The vibe is relaxed and cozy - it's a great spot to enjoy a dinner with a couple of good friends or a significant other - especially if you don't get uptown much (which I don't).Despite the fresh paint and shiny, unscratched bar, Red Rooster still possesses a weathered aura that conveys authenticity and sincerity. It had me hooked long before I took my first bite. For example, our waiter was very attentive, but not super-friendly, and that was absolutely fine. About the food: it's delicious. The pork belly with fried egg was expertly executed, it arrived atop a mound of savory pink beans and pickled onions. The crab cakes app featured two extra juicy, tasty patties. The braised short rib was delicious if a little small (the most pricey entree). I tried the yard bird with a side of shrimp and grits. The chicken was really moist, but not particularly flavorful. I had better fried chicken at Pies n Thighs, and much better fried chicken at any number of ordinary fried chicken places. The shrimp and grits was actually billed as ""shrimp and grits and chorizo,"" but there was no sausage to be found/tasted.Dessert was straightforward and scrumptious, and the house cocktails are really cool.

I had read a lot of reviews prior to our dinner date so I basically went there with very low expectations....and the experience was worse than what I expected. We ordered the corn bread which looked more like pound cake but tasted quite good. My husband had the yard bird which I had suggested to him based on the yelp reviews I read and I had the meatballs. My meatball dish was small. I think there were like 5 tiny meatballs in a pool of what looked like melted butter, a tiny scoop of mashed potatoes, about two forkfuls of red cabbage and about a tiny spoonful of lingonberries. This is suppose to be an entree!! Never mind the size of the dish, it wasn't even that great! I'd take Ikea's Swedish meatballs any day!!! My husband's fried chicken dish on the other hand was rather tasty. However, for twenty some what dollars, they could give a little more collard greens. As a side dish, we got the mashed yams....OMG, worst side ever. Tasted like it was mashed with Sunny D juice!! Yuck! So after we finished our entree, I was absolutely disappointed and did not want to give dessert a try but my husband insisted on giving it chance. We ended up sharing the warm apple pie and regretting that we did not just get the check instead. Crust was thin and dry and the cheese on it made it taste like a bagel.

3.0,4/18/2011,"Was looking forward to trying out Marcus Samuelsson's newest endeavors...  but a bit of a disappointment.   Kudos to him for establishing a ""down home,"" comfortable, neighborhood American bistro in a place that really needs one.  Unfortunately, the food was surprisingly mediocre--in fact, a bit church supper-ish.  If a top chef master is going to do ""down home,"" he better make sure it's top quality... and top tasting...  but it's not.   Alas.  Let's hope that they ramp up their menu a bit... and make it worth the trip.",1,0,0,Clara B.,"Providence, RI",0,31,9
2.0,4/17/2011,"I had the opportunity to have lunch at Red Rooster today and I was not very impressed. The decor was great but the food was mediocre. Upon entering the restaurant myslef and a friend were notified that the dining area was closed (at 2:45pm) and that we would have to sit at the bar (first come first serve) which meant that we would have to ""stalk"" people for their seats. The hostess finally seated us in a separate section (after waiting 15 minutes - not bad). We both ordered a burger with fries which arrived in 25 minutes. When my friend asked the waitress for extra ketchup and mayo it took her 15 minutes to retrieve it. This was the same wait time when I asked for a glass of pineapple juice. I wouldn't visit this place again. Hopefully they will improve and add more dishes to their menu.",3,0,0,Nikki H.,"Brooklyn, NY",46,278,226
3.0,4/16/2011,"Umm.. I thought Red Rooster served soul food, but apparently Red Rooster uses the term ""soul food"" loosely. The menu does have traditional soul food items like cornbread, mac n cheese, collard greens, and black eyed peas, however all of these items lack actual soul.  First of all the mac n cheese and greens come mixed together ( where they do that at) and the black eyed peas tasted a hot, gritty mess. Trying not to be biased I decided to order an entree in addition to the sides that my table was sharing. Via the waitress suggestion , I order the salmon and  one of my friends ordered the red snapper. Both fish dishes were bland, small, and just plain trifflin. The red snapper was dry even though it came drenched in a ""spicy"" tomato sauce and the salmon tasted like straight water. Like can I get a lemon to add some flavor or somethin. I will say that the  atmosphere at Red Rooster was on point. Nice mix of people, great staff ( especially the host), and the overall vibe is classy. Chef Marcus Samuelson was there. He came by and greeted are table which was pretty cool.Needless to say I won't be coming back to Red Rooster anytime soon.

2.0,4/16/2011,"My review is based on my brunch experience at Red Rooster only. Maybe the dinner experience is  more enjoyable.  Brunch is one of my favorite things to do on the weekend so, I thought I'd give the Red Rooster a try. I was highly disappointed. I had a goat cheese and spinach omelet and a side of bacon. The Omelet was supposed to be made with 3 eggs but the size was more like 2 medium eggs and it came with absolutely nothing! No salad, no potatoes, no garnish, nothing, Anyone who eats brunch at some of the nicest spots in the City can attest to the fact that it is standard that omelets are all accompanied by  something.  The ""maple"" bacon tasted like a regular bacon and I am almost 100% positive that the maple was not cured in the bacon but, it was actually drizzled with maple syrup. OMG! The bacon was $7 for a side and it was literally 4 small strips, not enough to share as I thought.  I hate to make money an issue but, I can't wrap my head around paying $17 for bacon and 2 eggs. I do know that a good Brunch on average is around $20 bucks which is fine, if the value is presented in the meal.  I'm afraid if my experience is the norm, that there will be a lot of one timers, at least for the real Foodies. Sorry, but I hope someone is listening. This place seemed at first to be a welcoming change to the limited restaurant choices in Harlem but, it can't stand on good looks alone.",1,0,0,Dolores B.,"Manhattan, NY",1,2,0
3.0,4/14/2011,"Ate at Red Rooster finally - never thought I would get in due to all the buzz and Obama visiting that week, but arrived at 5pm last Saturday, party of 3 and got table. Harlem definitely needed a full service, quality restaurant like this, one that sources quality ingredients, but casual atmosphere. The weak spot for me were the main courses on the menu. Very basic selection (other than Swedish Meatball variation), and the 2 I tried disappointed.  They let the fried chicken cool too long and it lacked flavor, and in particular that bacon-like taste that a good fried bird has. None of that chew-on-the-bone crispness either.  It was nicely cooked in the sense that it's crisp outside and moist inside, but no flavor other then subtle spice blend put into batter. My friend's fried catfish also lacked soul. It was cooked well had no perceptible seasoning , maybe it's the Swedish version? Prices are a bit on the steep side for the mains, and they do not come with any accompanying dish. We had the spice cake dessert, which seemed out of place on the menu. This just tasted like sugary cake, no spice or other flavor in it. Now the positives: loved the collards mix, the unique twist on mac&cheese, salads were fresh and nicely dressed, interesting cocktails and well stocked bar (good for bourbons), the hosts were very friendly and proactive - did not expect that. The atmosphere is beautiful and bustling especially upstairs by bar area. We were seated in basement dining room, and it was nice, but definitely would have preferred upstairs.  Perhaps the other more Swedish dishes are hits that I did not experience, but the more ""southern-style"" dishes need to be kicked up a notch. With that said I will give Marcus and his team credit for trying to do something different, and being creative. I hope they can perfect the menu more.

4.0,4/14/2011,"For last Sunday's dinner festivities I chose this as our group's destination. Getting a reservation for 7 was actually not hard, but I did call a month in advance. The restaurant definitely had an uptown vibe. The over all lay-out and decor was very hip and urbane. I was a little annoyed that we had to wait about 20 minutes even though we were on time for our reservations. But these things happen and as long as the service is good, I can deal with it. Our server Joe was very nice and friendly. I really liked that he was adamant about not making any specific food recommendations. He reasoned that everything is good and that we should order what caught our eye on first glance.For appetizers I got to try the crab cakes (Originality: 4 stars, Presentation: 3.5 stars, Taste: 4.5 stars), the Gravlax (O: 4.5 stars, P: 5 stars, T: 5 stars), and the lobster and watercress salad which had an unexpected but pleasant spice to it (O: 5 stars, P: 4.5 stars, T: 5 stars). For the entree I got to try the Uptown steak frites (O: 3.5 stars, P: 3.5 stars, T: 4 stars) which was a really great cut of meat but wasn't seasoned as excitingly as his other dishes; the Yard bird (O: 4 stars, P: 3.5 stars, T: 4.5 stars) which is Samuelsson's take on Southern fried chicken; and Helga's meatballs (O: 4 stars, P: 3.5 stars, T: 4.5 stars) a more classic dish. We were so full so for dessert I only tried the whiskey fudge which was really good! (O: 4 stars, P: 3 stars, T: 5 stars)The cocktail selection was interesting and tended on the boozy side. I was very happy with my Negroni.Over all, the food itself averaged on 4 stars but the service is great and the atmosphere is fun. And there's also the fact that Obama himself has dined here.

3.0,4/14/2011,I think we missed out on something spectacular coming here for brunch instead of dinner.  Or so I can tell by the reviews.  We were definitely not blown away by this Harlem hot spot's meal.  I had the baked eggs with mozzarella and tomatoes.  The eggs just tasted like a tiny cast iron skillet of hard boiled eggs with 2 tiny pieces of stale baguette in it.  The tomatoes and mozz on the side with some balsamic was tasty - together though?  Not so much.My wife had the chicken nuggets and french toast.  She liked the nuggets fine - said they were nothing special fried chicken - but the toast was a bit much.  Service was great though and we were expecting quite the line.  From 10a to about 11:30a  on a Sunday there was no wait and empty tables.  Maybe everyone was waiting for the clock to strike noon for the alcohol to start flowing?  I don't know what we missed out on but next time I'm in Harlem I think I'll hit up the oldie but goodie Sylvia's one more block away!,3,1,1,Lindsay S.,"Chicago, IL",75,547,21
3.0,4/14/2011,"Being that both of us hail from the South, Rachel and I decided that it would only be fitting to kick-off our weekend with an early Saturday morning brunch at Marcus Samuelsson's recently-opened nouveau-Southern, Red Rooster Harlem.  ""Early"" and ""Saturday"" are two words that should never be used so closely together in a sentence but, due to the fact that President Obama had visited the restaurant earlier in the week, I thought that a pre-noon arrival would be necessary in order to avoid a potentially heinous line and/or wait for a table.  We settled on 11am. In true Lunch Belle fashion, I arrived at the restaurant about 15-minutes early and, to my surprise, Red Rooster was not nearly as crowded as I had imagined it would be.  Since Rach and I did not have a reservation, there was no need to approach the hostess and inform her of my arrival.  Instead, I made a bee-line to the spacious bar and ordered a caffe latte as I waited for my guest.    Just as I began to get comfortable, Rachel arrived.  As I paid my ""bar tab,"" she approached the hostess stand and inquired about a two-top.  Coincidentally, we were seated at a communal table, located just inches from my original bar stool. ""You know,"" Rachel admitted, as my head was buried deep in Red Rooster's brunch menu, ""I've already been here for dinner.""  I glanced up in shock - as if she'd just announced that she was going to move to Las Vegas to pursue her lifelong dream of becoming a show-girl.  ""What?"" I exclaimed.  Rachel reassured me that, despite having previously dined here, this did not change the fact that she was eager to sample the 'Rooster's a.m. offerings.  ""OK Rach, but I don't want to hear about your dinner experience until after we're done with brunch.  Fair?""  She nodded.CornbreadI've never had cornbread shaped/sliced like pound cake, but this presentation made quite a bit of sense.  I cut my portion down the middle and, on each half, spread a thick layer of the accompanying ""dips"": honey butter and tomato jam.The cornbread, itself, was very heavy and dense - almost dry.  The tomato jam was incredibly fragrant, though not in a positive sense (or shall I say ""scents"" - hahaha) of the word.  There were too many combative ingredients and textures.  The honey-butter, however, was an excellent pairing with the savory bread.  Rachel and I butter knife-fought over the last spreadable serving.Hearth Baked Mac & Greens I took one look at the skillet-baked macaroni laced with ""greens"" and turned up my nose.  And this was pre-bite, people!  ""What the hell are 'greens' doing mixed-in with mac & cheese?  Who does that?""  I asked Rachel, as if she had all of the answers.  She looked at me and shrugged - with an expression similar to what I probably made when she told me that she had 'already been here for dinner.'  For $14, I thought, this entree was an ample amount of food for a relatively low price.  Plus, I was not expecting a side salad to accompany the mac & cheese, but I was happy that it was there, nonetheless.  Seeing more greens - whether or not they're doused with dressing - still makes me feel *a little bit better* about ordering a-la-lumber jack.It wasn't until I took my first bite that I realized just how compatible these ingredients were!  If you're familiar with the Indian dish, Palak Paneer, then you are more than aware of just how sexy cheese and spinach is when combined.  Well, ""Mac & Greens"" takes this sexiness further.  Try 1000 times further.  Imagine, if you will, the pairing of orecchiette (ear-shaped pasta noodles) and wilted greens, enveloped by a gooey melange of three cheeses (gouda, NY cheddar, and comte).  After being folded in to a cast-iron skillet, this hearty blend is topped with seasoned bread crumbs and placed under the broiler for some well-deserved ""sun bathing.""   I'm telling you, folks, this dish is out-of-this-world and worth the trip to Harlem, alone.  Nuggets & ToastHaving had the opportunity to sample some of Marcus Samuelsson's fried chicken at an event in October, I was really looking forward to his Nuggets & Toast (Nuggets = fried chicken chunks.  Toast = French toast).  Visually, the ""nuggets"" semi-resembled Chili's Chicken Crispers which, I'll be the first to admit, I love.  Unfortunately, and very unlike that of what I tasted in October, this particular chicken was tasteless, greasy, and flecked with random bits of dark meat.        ConclusionAside from the mac' & greens, would I run back to Red Rooster?  No.  There are too many other restaurants in Harlem that I want to check out.",3,0,0,Lindsay F.,"New York, NY",376,277,184

4.0,4/11/2011,"Soul. Rhythm. Vibe. Marcus Samuelsson doesn't need to prove anything to anybody. Over the past fifteen years, he has been one of the most respected toques in Manhattan winning multiple awards and accolades for his magnificent tenure at ""the"" destination for Scandinavian cuisine in New York City, Aquavit. This was followed by a triumphant win on Season Two of The Bravo Network's TOP CHEF Masters. Yet, with the fire still burning inside, he decided to leave his safe havens in Midtown and MePa to set out on an ambitious project resulting in the revival of the Harlem outpost of The Red Rooster opened in December 2010. Mari Uyehara of Time Out NY cites that the original Red Rooster ""located on 138th Street and Seventh Avenue was a soul-food classic; a smoky, low ceilinged den with red lighting and a neon jukebox which served as a gathering place for Harlem greats such as James Baldwin, Duke Ellington and Adam Clayton Powell Jr."" The new Red Rooster made headlines recently as President Obama hosted a $30,000 a seat charity dinner which just adds to the current fervor. Chef Marcus has resurrected this scene with a perfectly designed, and airy room lined with shelves of eclectic trinkets ranging from vinyl records to tennis rackets as well as a gallery of noted local artists including Philip Maysles, Lorna Simpson and Laine McNulty. Upon entering, you will be greeted by a number of friendly hosts. On this past Saturday night, the congenial Adrian greeted me and my new ""foodie"" cohort,  Dominique. Adrian was generous with his time and gave a full tour of the dining room as well as the club and lounge that reside downstairs for late night revelries. The bar was bustling with a motley, yet stylish mix of Harlem locals and anxious pilgrims up from Midtown and further distances. The cocktail menu is loaded with signature drinks including the Cocoa and Vanilla infused Lenox ($15) with its earthy blend of bourbon, Dolin Rouge, Averna Amaro and Orange Bitters and the refreshing Savoy ($12); a simple, but wonderful concoction of Vodka, Lemon Juice, Agave and Muddled Grapes. There is also a very interesting selection of reasonably priced ($7-12) small bottle and conversely expensive ($18-24) large bottle beers originating from various locales such as Spain, Oregon, Germany, Denmark, Kenya, Sweden and yes, even New Jersey. I chose the crisp and effervescent draught German Reissdorf Kolsch ($8) and tossed it down with a smile. But fair warning; be sure to give yourself ample time before your scheduled seating to get served at the bar. On any busy night, there is usually a bit of a wait to get served for those positioned on the outer perimeter looking to sample the drink menu. Samuelsson's dinner menu, under the supervision of Executive Chef Andrea Bergquist (Merkato 55) is a motley, yet well executed mix of influences spanning the flavor profiles of his life (Ethiopian, Sweden, French and Southern Comfort). You will experience the terroir of East Africa and the Caribbean in his wonderful Dirty Rice and Barbecued with Aged Basmati and Curry Leaves ($12) I would happily pay out of pocket for the Corn Bread with Honey Butter and Tomato Jam ($5) over a free basket of plain 'ol bread any day of the week. The Southern standard of Pulled Pork, Rainbow Slaw and Lemon Aioli ($9) just belted out multi-dimensions of flavor. The Blue Corn Tacos and Tostados stuffed with Yellowtail Ceviche, Salmon and Avocado ($9) lacked the punch of seafood essence that I would expect to enjoy. The bountifully portioned house special Fried Southern Yard Bird Chicken ( $21) with White Mace Gravy and Hot Sauce had great tangy spice and texture, but the dark meat was woefully a bit on the dry side. The adequate Swedish ""Helga's Meatballs"" ($17) came with a rapidly vanishing and irrelevant foam topping and a side boring lingonberries completely void of any describable taste. Our server Elton showed some genuine care and enthusiasm in tending to us and overall the wait staff seemed well trained and had a friendly attitude. Although, Dominique and I both agreed that we felt somewhat rushed. They were noticeably quick to pick up our plates before we were ready to let them do so. The main dining room did get a bit loud at times with the soundtrack playing a pleasing head-bobbing medley R&B and soul familiars ranging from Chrisette Michelle to Soul II Soul to Keith Sweat. For dessert, Dominique had a favorable opinion of the Black and White Mud Cake with Chocolate Cookie Crust ($8). My Vanilla Latte Coffee ($4.50) paired brilliantly with the luscious and surprisingly light Spiced Pudding Cake with Apricot and Black Currants ($8). One star for the diverse menu, another star for the attentive yet hurried service, two more for the dynamic decor and outstanding smooth, clubby atmosphere. Dinner for two with tax and tip was $145.",2,0,2,The Jedi Foodi E.,"New York, NY",333,107,515
3.0,4/10/2011,"I really wanted to like this place. I so wanted to like it I am still giving it 3 stars and also because I think it is nice that Harlem gets to jazz up its dining scene. But, uh, the food is well, not that good. Im sorry! I feel terrible typing it even. I ordered the fried chicken and the meat was a low quality. Not terrible but below average. It was also dry and the strangest thing was there was hardly any meat to eat! I turned it round and round and contemplated eating the bones! The greens that came with it was such a small portion I didnt see them at first, the chicken leg concealed it. I was of course hungry after that so I ordered a side of cauliflower and boy was it old and strechy. I then ordered a shake because I coudnt take it anymore and just wanted calories. It was ok. The waiter said it was like a ""Wendy's frosty"". That didnt do much to make me want to order it but they withheld food for an hour so I was game and slurped the frosty down. I paid about $65 with tip. Anyways, I think true to Manahattan fakeness people come here to be ""hip"" or in proximity to a famous chef or be seen. Pretty pathetic. They line up around the bar and pose. And New Yorker's have the nerve to speak about Californians! This is why there is hype ongoing about this place. I live in the neighborhood. I was hungry. I wanted to find a place to eat because we simply do not have many places to eat around here. I mean how many red velevet cupcakes and cups of greens can a person eat? So folks, it was not the best Im afraid. Im sorry Red Rooster, I wanted to like you and I think you are ok but the very rude guy that takes reservations is not a plus and the waiters that think they are Obama's right hand man do not help either. All that aside, dont go hungry if you insist on trying this place. I know we all have suggestions but why cant they just get better quality meat, serve larger portions and do something to the fried chicken to make it taste unique? Serve a little unusual salad with it. For $1 of supplies they could make it much more pleasant. Where is this man's business sense? The vegtables should be fresh not dry and strechy. oh, geez, I hope something changes here because many people frown upon the food but just keep trying to wish the food to improve. The chef has the upper hand, I hope he doesnt think he can ride on his likeability forever.

2.0,4/7/2011,"Red Rooster is a restaurant very much in need of getting its legs. As a newly opened establishment, it is currently suffering from some serious jitters.Honestly, if I were rating the food alone, I would be giving 5 stars. I found none of the blandness or under-seasoned fare described in some other negative reviews - rather, everything except dessert (a rather dry chocolate cake) was a home run in terms of flavor. Unfortunately the service and simply the restaurant itself leaves a lot to be desired. Met the GF here a few nights back - she had put our names down and sat at the bar, the hostess having told her that the full party must be there before she could reserve a table, but that the wait would be around 45 minutes (I was confused as to why there was a wait at all, as the dining room was almost completely deserted, but we'll get to that later).So fine. When I arrived I approached the hostess to let her know that the rest of our party (me) was here. She busily chatted with a friend for about 5 minutes at the hostess stand. I patiently waited for her to finish her conversation, after which she then turned around and walked into the dining area, where she milled around for another 5. It's not like I was hard to miss, standing at 6'2"" directly in front of the hostess stand. Finally I was able to let her know I was there and joined my GF at the bar. The cocktails were interesting, but unbalanced. One in particular with fresh muddled dill was nice if you like dill and only dill, as you wouldn't know anything else was in it. Standing at the bar I picked up on several things by overhearing the servers' comments as they came and went:1) The restaurant and bar are both currently understaffed. 2) Many customers dislike and send back their cocktails, even when made to the specifics of the recipe.After 80 minutes of waiting, the GF decided to check on our table. The hostess said, ""Sure! There's a table open right now!"" Ok...so did she have our name down or not? The ""table"" mentioned, was in fact two stools at one of the communal bar tables. We never confirmed it, but I can only guess that the dining room is actually for reservations only. It would be nice if they let you know that when arriving. I'm as happy as the next person to eat at a communal table, but these were so packed as to not even fit each diner's plates. One previous reviewer's description of a ""mechanical bull of a bar stool"" is really pretty accurate. The stool I sat on had a solid 2 inches of vertical wobble.Service was full of holes throughout the night. Huge gaps of time between courses (35 minutes between app. and entrées), no bread for the two of us, multiple failed requests for water (to the point where our neighbors to the left were also trying to remind the servers on our behalf), a trashed set of leftovers that was supposed to have been boxed up, multiple errors on the bill, etc. etc. All in all we spent 3 1/2 hours (not including wait time) on a dinner that should have taken 90 minutes tops.I will say that the servers have a major challenge with the communal tables, as they are packed so tightly that it is very hard for them to get to the inner seats. I actually felt bad for our waitress - she seemed genuinely embarrassed about it. No restaurant should try to pack so many seats in as to be virtually unable to physically serve all their guests. Finally, I will mention the prices. As good as the food was, it simply and truly was not worth the cost. My plate of shortribs, while delicious, was $32. These are short ribs we're talking about - a humble cut of meat, that is not hard to get, and which was certainly not prepared in any sort of insanely lavish manner. And they are not even the most expensive dish on the menu. The food was great, but it simply is not special enough to warrant the prices. No, despite how some are describing it, Red Rooster does not serve Soul Food (maybe a distant, rich third cousin to Soul Food that only met Soul Food once when it was little) so I did not expect cheap prices. But consider this: our meal, with two app.s, two entrées, one side, one dessert, two cocktails, and an ass-load of physical discomfort and poor service came to over $200 with tax and tip. For the same price, one could enjoy a four course lunch, plus dessert and drinks at Jean-Georges.Sorry Red Rooster, I think next time I'll go to the 3-star Michelin restaurant instead, which, oddly enough, carries much less pretense.",9,4,1,Darren M.,"Manhattan, NY",4,64,10

But i have to say that the food was not as good as it could have been. It seems like they're trying too hard. My friend had the Mac n Cheese, and it was probably the worst I've ever seen or tasted. I had the fish sandwich, which was pretty good, but they forgot the fries that are supposed to come with it. The thing that made it worse is that after bringing the food, I couldn't flag down a waiter for fifteen minutes. I tried. I really did. So by the time I got someone's attention about the missing fires, I was done with the sandwich and my friend had already finished eating. So we just paid the bill and left, and decided it wouldn't be worth another visit. Oh well. I hope the service and food get better at Red Rooster. The neighborhood really does need it to be good, as there are few other options nearby except Sylvia's.",0,0,0,josephina p.,"Manhattan, NY",0,12,2
3.0,4/5/2011,"Red Rooster -Harlem, NY (review) A spot in Harlem that you have to make reservations for months in advance to get into unless you don't mind riding a mechanical bull of a bar stool.  Ok so it's only a little wobbly.  This place is aesthetically exhilarating, from the vintage barn design to the beautiful people who line the bar and those that keep the restaurant running.  Lets just say they know how to pick their hosts. The food is two notches away from greatness. The establishment itself is somewhere you will want to experience. Trust!Rating: Two (out of 4) breath-on-the-back-of-the-neck hard nipples.  Everything felt right but didn't end perfect. I'd give the Rooster a second date. *avoiding MANY rooster jokes here.Ordered:Oysters, crab cakes, red grits, fried yard bird, chickpea dumplings.The crab cakes were eaten like we were two fat kids grubbing on fried twinkies behind the McD's. It took moments and they were GONE.  Moist crab meat pieces, not overwhelmed with bread crumbs, lightly seared on each side, sitting in a little avocado spread and pieces of prickly pears. No time for a photo.Oysters, ya they were raw and paired with a mango + grand mariner shot (very ""top chef"" of the chef) but they were nothing to write home about. And wouldn't order again with that price. Fried bird was juicy but the crust was lackluster, as was the overall taste.  You're in Harlem! Step up the game on the fried chicken.  Just sayin'.Chickpea dumplings, I see where they were going with this, but they never arrived at the destination. Dry, no no, very dry dumpling pieces.Red Grits!  Um Yes, please and thank you.  Pieces of shrimp, cheese, a couple pieces of chorizo, tomato puree added the 'red'.  This was TASTY!  Woooweee!  Order that twice!resource: noshawarmano.tumblr.com",0,3,0,Nuna C.,"Manhattan, NY",116,177,170
4.0,4/4/2011,"It's really hard to judge this place as I never thought in ONE MILLION YEARS that I would ever get a table here. Luckily, I know someone that knows someone that know someone. A friend used a big in and we went for an extremely early dinner (yes, that's what an in will get you). The place started off hardly crowded and by the end of our dinner, circa 8pm, it was packed.We started with the red caesar salad. Then I got the mac 'n greens and she had the blackened catfish. I rarely order a dish as decadent as the 4 cheese mac 'n greens but it was amazing. Very rich but not to the point where I could only eat 4 bites. I ate most of it. My friend said she really liked the fish but she hardly ate 1/2. I tasted it and it was super flavorful - maybe a bit overpowering on the spices, Marcus. We had the mashed yams (sans bacon) on the side and THAT was dessert worthy sweet and smooth. My biggest complaint is the service. For that price, I would expect impeccable service. My friend was served her iced tea before we even had water glasses. They were not very attentive but the waitress was extremely friendly and helpful in explaining menu items. So it's not that it was bad service, it just should have been 10x better at this caliber. Honestly, my favorite part was the people watching. You could tell people come from ALL over (the city and otherswise) to eat here and I really like when a place draws all kinds. i think I need to try brunch here.

We had the crab cakes, fried chicken and meatballs. Crab cakes were more New England style, not lump. They came with a nice accompaniment of sauces on the plate. The fried chicken was great, juicy with a lot of flavor and generous. My partner liked the meatballs. The donut dessert was fresh and tasty. I'll be returning to sample other items on the menu.

I finally had to ask the staff where our table was.  The lady promised she'd ask and get right back to us.    Then she went on break, never having said a word.  I walked up to her replacement and we finally got seated.  We sat at the table for 15-20 minutes, without a server or even a glass of water.   Nothing.  It was like we didn't exist.Finally we got a server, who offered us something to start.  We indicated we were ready to order and he seemed affronted.  We ordered two appetizers, two sides and our 3 entrees.  After about 30 minutes, we heard the kitchen staff ordering up our entrees.  Our server had never returned after our initial order.  Our water glasses were empty at this point.  And we had seen hide nor hair of our appetizers.Finally we flagged the manager down and she was very apologetic and nice.  We got our apps.  Literally 1 minute later our entrees came out - servers literally shoving our apps aside so they could stuff the entrees on the table and when we objected the server said 'We're busy, you're going to have to work with us here.'  It was 50% empty and these tables are not large enough for that kind of thing (which is normal in NYC, space is at a premium, that's not a dig).  Huge disappointment.  My roommate had ordered a beef entree rare, it was literally burnt and well done.  My other roommate ordered the chicken and french toast and the bird was as dry as the Sahara.  I ordered the gravlax sandwich, and got a plate full of open faced stuff and little bits of bread and topping.  It was tasty though.  We had to remind them to bring our sides of greens and mac and cheese.About halfway through dinner, we finally got the bread that you normally get when  you sit down to eat...with some olive oil on the side.  It was dry and the olive oil was tasteless.  Everything was tasteless really.  Had to ask for salt and pepper.  SO BLAND.In apology they brought us a single serving free dessert for the table of 3 diners.  It wasn't bad.  The pickles (Italian style) from the appetizer were the best part of our meal.It was insult to injury to get a full price bill for that service and we didn't even eat half the food brought to us because it was just that bad.  We just let them take it away.We will never, EVER, go back.  I can't recommend that you stay away far enough.  Just horrid.  Horrible service, very middle of the road food, and WAY overpriced.",2,0,0,Pen B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0

2.0,4/1/2011,"Rating for my visit: 1.5 stars. This is a review for the bar and general ambience of this restaurant. Given the number of negative reviews and the number of poor reviews we have received informally, from friends and acquaintances, we had not yet decided when (or if) we would try the food. The sudden and very recent five star reviews, and the comments about ""haters"" in particular, indicate desperation. Unfortunately, it is now even less likely that we will visit this restaurant for dinner ! But if we do, I will update my review and provide a fair evaluation. On the evening we visited for a before-dinner cocktail, the service was astonishingly unprofessional; breathtakingly bad. The pretentious smugness of the hostess staff is almost interesting to observe. Indeed, it would be a kind of comedy if it were not entirely horrifying at the same time. Worse, my significant other had a drink (La Marqueta ? or similar) that was absolutely undrinkable, sweet in an odd and unpleasant way. There is a kind of ""celebrity"" feeling about this place that I do not, personally, appreciate or find interesting at all - all hype, no product. Lots of determined posturing and who knows whether anything is behind. I will watch with interest in the hopes that they will get everything together over time. Note: It is not at all likely that a taxi driver has ever visited Red Rooster. One might therefore take such recommendations with a grain of salt, as they say.",1,0,2,Harlem r.,"New York, NY",0,77,0

And when NYC cab drivers mention something good, no one should take it lightly... They are almost always on point. I visited the Red Rooster two nights ago with two friends of mine after hearing about Obama's appearance. I ordered the Chicken and Egg as an appetizer and the Seared (or grilled?) Salmon as an entree. Extremely happy with what I ordered - the chicken and egg dish was pretty unique, the liver added some flare to it that made the entire plate well-rounded, and the salmon was simple, cooked beautifully, and complemented with a smokey flavor that I can't quite describe.

2.0,3/31/2011,"Not sure what all the hype is about. Went with friends from Chicago who were super excited to dine here. Marcus has a burger joint in Chicago where one of the members loved the food so much she made attending this restaurant as a ""must do"" when she came to Manhattan. Bar space is nice and the Big Red Rooster cocktail was amazing! You must try it...nice and flavorful and a little strong. Worth the $14 bucks. The dining space was not as full as the staff will try to make you think. They have plenty of dining space on the lower level so I am not sure why they close reservations for walk-ins. Complimentary bread is served but don't get excited about it...its a half slice of lightly toasted dry azz texas toast served with butter. The thick triangles are served per diner...three people...three pieces. We ordered the corn bread, grits, and three entrees:chick pea dumplings, hearth mac n cheese, and the yard bird. The chick pea dumplings are small gnocchi pillows of chick pea with spinach and tomato sauce ...plate did not look appetizing and did not match the description. From the description I thought it would be a dumpling or ravioli filled pasta not a squishy lump of pressed chick peas with no flavor...yuck! The dish also had small crunchy balls of something that tasted like Kix cereal but resembled corn nuts. I sent my dish back and none of my friends liked it either. My friend ordered the yard bird which she said was dry and unseasoned. It's described as fried chicken but don't expect a crispy battered piece of chicken it was more like fried and then steamed. Underneath the chicken was a very small amount of greens. The grits were gummy and had small diced tomatoes in it...not good either. My friend sent her yardbird entree back because it lacked flavor and she found a long strand of black hair on the plate. The mac and cheese is a white cheese sauce that isok....but not very good as a main entree. There are greens in the sauce-like collards and it was served with a small lettuce salad. The cornbread is the size of a slice of pound cake but was drenched in way too much butter so it made the bread soggy...the tomato relish served with it was terrible. We were all disappointed with our dishes. The space  is nice and inviting... I would go back for drinks but I would not go back  for food at all.

4.0,3/27/2011,"So, I've been waiting for this place to open for quite some time and after waiting a month for my reservations to come up, tonight was THE night.  Right down the block from Sylvia's, Red Rooster invites guests with their prominent red signs.  Upon entering, the large bar beckons those waiting for tables to your right and directly in front of you are the hostesses.  The interior decoration is modern, warmly lit, and surprisingly wide open with tall ceilings making for a very welcoming space.  Along the walls are various pieces of art and murals of course the rooster is a recurring theme.  We were seated at the bank along a communal table right in front of the pass.  Allowing us a full view of the kitchen and it's surprising calmness.Given the fact that I had the entire month the view the menu before actually eating here, I knew what I already wanted.  A fried yard bird, gravlax, corn bread, and sweet potato doughnuts.  Everything almost turned out as planned except I ended up getting the blackened catfish in order not to order the same dish as my dinner companion.First out were the gravlax, cornbread, and of course the standard bread that every restaurant gives out.  The gravlax was laid atop a rye cracker and cream cheese, topped with pickled shallots.  Combined  together made for a delightfully subtle appetizer.  In sharp contrast, to the Scandinavian dish, the cornbread was a more in your face southern soul food.  Dense, very gritty cornmeal (good thing) and loaded with butter, accompanied with the tomato jam making for a perfect savory bite.  I definitely avoided slathering the butter on the bread as it became quite overwhelming.The blackened catfish came out next, laid on top of black eyed peas and collard greens.  The catfish's natural flavor was definitely covered up quite a bit by the seasoning and black eyed peas/collared greens.  I do wish that catfish flavor came out a bit more, but I can certainly understand why some would be put off by it.  A mouthful of the hot peppers, slaw, collared greens, and catfish together was absolutely delicious.  The catfish had a nice light heat in the seasoning and boy could I eat an entire bowl of those collared greens and black eyed peas, they were incredibly flavorful and hearty.  The sweet potato filled doughnut holes was paired with a vanilla creme and lemon sorbet.  My palate definitely favored the doughnut and vanilla creme combination rather than the acidity of the lemon and the sugar.  Dinner was also accompanied by a bourbon negroni and an americano coffee.  The negroni was worth the $13.00 as it was loaded with booze (hate it when they water down my drinks) and the coffee was a nice dark roasted flavorful cup.  It still didn't beat the best coffee I've ever had (Desert Truck Works) but a good cup none the less.  So I was worried about all the negative or so so reviews of Red Rooster.  But I believe they set the bar far too high and of course were sadly disappointed.  Yes I've had much better food from the other famous chefs, but  I don't categorize this as fine dining.  It's comfort food and in that I think it does well.  So, I  give it a solid 4 stars as a place I would definitely return to.  The prices are reasonable, the atmosphere is nice, and the crowd is eclectic.  You have families coming here for dinner, couples on dates, and really a nice mix of New York.  Whether it's the interracial family sitting at the booth, the gay couple enjoying the night out, older couples in the 60s, to the younger crowd in their late 20s.  Also a nice touch is the bathrooms where there are family pictures further emphasizing that this is where you can get some good quality home cooking.  Although I will mention that the arbie sitting on top of the mirror in the bathroom was a bit weird.  Unfortunately, I did not get to see Marcus Samuelsson, but my girlfriend did only after a few minutes after I left to get the car.  I guess that'll have to wait till next time!",5,0,2,Phil L.,"Seattle, WA",167,876,249

Very juicy and my friend was happily eating away.  The oxtail and dumplings eaters (myself included) were not so lucky.  I never tasted more bland food in my life.  I had to pour so much salt on the dish just to add a bit of flavor.  I almost asked the waitress for seasonings so that I could try and create the taste this dish is supposed to have.  The oxtail fared no better.  I will say however, the social scene at the restaurant is great.  For a Sunday evening, the place was crowded like a Friday night.  While I was very disappointed with the food, I would return and hang out at the bar and enjoy a drink with friends.  If you want better food head north 129th/Lenox to Jacob's.  If you want a great place to have a drink Red Rooster is the spot.",0,1,0,Whitney B.,"New York, NY",1,11,0
3.0,3/25/2011,"As many of you may know, Red Rooster is pretty much the hottest restaurant in NYC right now. So as you can imagine, I was pretty excited to check it out! The food was definitely very good, but, I didn't think it lived up to the hype or to the chef, Marcus Samuelson's stellar reputation. However, the space was was great---very open feeling with a funky, modern, yet homey design aesthetic. The restaurant and bar have a great vibe going on, very upbeat and friendly. Sam Sifton's review in The New York Times was spot on to emphasize the restaurant's vibe and diversity of its patrons over the food itself. Here are my thoughts on the food. Drinks were very good--they have a specialty cocktail list and a good selection of wines by the glass and beer. I had the first cocktail off the list, which was a refreshing and tart gin concoction. Then I had a glass of white wine, which I liked. For an appetizer, I had the red caesar salad with bottarga. I liked the fact that they used bottarga as a play on parmesan, and I enjoyed the pleasantly fishy flavor of the salad. However, I felt that the salad was underdressed and could have had a smokier flavor (the description did say it was smokey, afterall). My friend ordered the ceviche trio, which was very good, and tastier than my salad. Her parents had the homemade gravlax, which looked fantastic, but I didn't get to try it. For my main course, I had the fried yard bird, and I have to say I was pretty disappointed with it. I was expecting fried chicken with that yummy deep-fried crust, but no such luck here. Don't get me wrong, the chicken was tasty, and it came with this really yummy spice mixture that you shake on. It just didn't taste like fried chicken to me. My other complaint was that it didn't really come with anything on the side. Just a few bites of collard greens, which weren't anything to rave about. Dessert stole the show though. The sweet potato donut holes with bourbon whipped cream were so delicious and unlike anything I'd ever had. So despite my disappointment, I'd be interested in going back to Red Rooster and ordering differently. I also think the bar looks great, and would love to go back and hang out there for some drinking.",2,0,0,Sarah T.,"ASTORIA, NY",11,29,0

SERVICE: I made a reservation for me and my gf about a month in advance. I arrived 10 minutes early and was told that we would be seated soon. Soon became 55 minutes later! I politely asked the hostesses once or twice during my wait when I would be seated, they rudedly responded ""you will soon be seated"" and acted as if I was bothering them. If these rude hostesses could not handle a small crowd on a Monday nite, they should be fired.  The manger eventually came over and apoligized and said he would comp. some corn bread and dessert. Finally seated our waitress was very polite and helpful a little slow but felt that there wasn't enough wait staff to handle the dinning room. 2.

Chicken was juicy but the skin was so so, not to bash here but popeyes chicken has better skin. Collar Green when not cooked right are bitter and these were bitter.Oxtail with Plantains-- was good  and tender but nothing special and for $26 I was expecting something special. Not to knock again but I can drive out to jamaica, queens and get the same order for less than $10 and the plantain was hard and over cooked.Dessert:     Condensed Milk Flan with Coconut Ice Cream- Flan was good but average, coconut ice cream was great.3.

2.0,3/21/2011,"Until things are more organized, well stocked and fully staffed with attentive people, my original review of the Red Rooster is being downgraded to a 2 star. Since my original visits as a bar customer I've tried to go for brunch and was very, very underwhelmed by the experience. The 1.5 hour wait was expected so we went planning to get a drink and possibly eat at the bar. The duo of singers performing in the dining room were off key and whiny. Jazz brunch to me means a nice standing base or a piano, whiny overwrought vocals do not relax me into a lovely Sunday. One bartender is no where near enough for this busy bar on a Sunday brunch. But if he'd been moving fast and paying attention he would have been able to make it work. Instead, head down and ignoring almost all his customers at any given time, our bartender waited 10 minutes before asking if we wanted a drink. When my friend said he didn't want the champagne they listed, the bartender suggested prosecco. When our drinks came, the bartender plopped down a wine glass and announced that they were out of prosecco so here's the champagne"" Never asked if he wanted something else, and just put it on the bar (and the bill.) My bloody mary was dressed with a tasty shrimp and juicy olive, but when I tried the drink itself it went down sour and without any kind of depth of flavor. In a restaurant known for it's spice combination this was a major bummer. We didn't get water, or place settings, or napkins, and he never checked in on us again. We didn't finish. We paid and left and went to brunch at Native, where we were welcomed with open arms, fantastic food and great drinks.

2.0,3/21/2011,"The good: The space is wonderful! Kudos to someone who finally figured out that the waiting/hanging space should be large so you don't get bumped around drinking and waiting. The bad: The food is mediocre at best. Anything that's good is because it's deep fried or has syrup on it. I've said it once and I'll say it again: everything tastes good fried with syrup on it. We had the nuggets with toast and the sweet potato lamb hash. It was uninspired and really just oily. I mean it tasted good, but this isn't fine food. The lamb hash was little cubes of beets, sweet potato and the cheapest part of a chewy lamb sitting in some oil with a cream sauce. It tasted like left-overs. Ok, I guess.  I had a vodka drink that had muddled grapes in it. Again, it was fine, but not finely done with any great care or effort.I feel like this is another restaurant that doesn't have the chops to create quality food with care.  Instead, they are using deep frying as an out and calling it soul food or American Traditional; and serving it in a beautiful space so we think we're getting some amazing new take on American food. Who knew sloppily prepared, oily, uninspired cooking was an American tradition? Thanks for opening in Harlem though. The space is incredible and the neighborhood could use this beautiful place to draw people in. Please go back and work on the menu and recipes. You're a celebrity.

The service was terrible, the kitchen lost our check and we waited for some of our order until the rest was cold. The waiter didn't have a busser to refill water glasses and coffee cups during a very busy brunch, and the entrees were too small, expensive, and incomplete as a meal. I feel hungry thirty minutes after eating and spending $100 on brunch for three people. Also, the rude hostess was a complete idiot. After waiting a half hour for the refill of my coffee, I asked the passing hostess if she could get me more coffee. She gave me a nasty self-important look and said ""NO, but I'll find you a server."" But she DIDN'T. I waited another 20 minutes for my waiter to come back to the table. I guess he was on a break with no one covering his tables. When a restaurant doesn't pool the tips among the staff, no one helps anyone else. That's when the kitchen lost our order and we had to start over. On a better note, the breakfast bread basket was great, along with the honey butter, and the fries in truffle sauce were delicious.

It came with a sprinkler on the side that I could smell had some Ethiopian spices (berbere) in it, which I thought was an interesting touch. My friend happily picked it at it til there was no meat left! But like me, she was still hungry afterwards. I think the ambiance and vibe impressed me more than the food.

2.0,3/19/2011,"It was a beautiful Wednesday early afternoon when my boyfriend and I decided to go and grab a late lunch at the ""famous"" Red Rooster everybody was hyped about. My boyfriend had suggested it because he had heard that Marcus Samuelsson was the chef there and according to reviews his food is ""amazing"". Well what we got was far from amazing and more like robbed for our money. I don't ever complain about money when it comes to good food, ambiance and drinks. But this place is just for show and drinks in my opinion. Back to the food..my boyfriend ordered the Fried Yard Bird and was super excited about it. (Note: he never gets excited over new ""trendy"" restaurants) The meal is suppose to come with collard greens and instead he got what looked like a tea spoon of it and it was hidden under the chicken. The chicken itself was flavorless. The only thing that had flavor according to him was the skin, which had been heavily seasoned.  He was definitely not fond of his meal. I ordered the salmon with asparagus. Side note: I LOVE salmon! Therefore, I was VERY excited to see what this famous chef had up his sleeve. Well, lets put it like this...after getting my meal the actual presentation of the dish was horrible. I tried not to judge my food until I actually had a bite. That is until I actually tried to dig in and realized that my salmon was still RAW!! Now, please note I have gone to restaurants where they have asked me how I like my fish cooked. They never asked me this but either way I don't think I was at a sushi spot. After trying to get the waitresses attention for like 10 min (she was too busy talking up a storm to some girl) I told her that I thought my fish was under cooked. She looked at it and realized how bad it looked and immediately apologized and took my dish away. We also asked her if the Fried Yard Bird came with a side dish and she said it did and look at my boyfriends plate confused. She said ""it comes with greens..is it under your chicken?"" When he picked up the chicken she was speechless when she saw how little he got. She then went back into the kitchen to get my fish fully cooked and get him the rest of the side for his main course. Once I got my dish back I honestly hated it! The fish had no flavor what so ever. And my asparagus looked and tasted like they had given me the scraps. Now, if this meal was $1.99 I would understand but for the price I can't believe they would have the audasity to serve something like that. The only reason why I even gave it 2 stars was because the only thing that was good about this place was the drinks and the decor. Thats it.So, if you are looking for a decent drink in Harlem and want nice decor research other places but if this is your last resort then at least you can get a good drink here.",0,0,0,Val G.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,6,0
2.0,3/18/2011,"I really wanted to like Red Rooster. I did...really. Very Much.The ambiance was really lovely. Beautiful hard woods and high ceilings make for an open and inviting feel when you first walk in. The bar is sleek and large...with ample space for large groups to hang out and wait.Which is good...because wait you shall.I really can't knock the staff too much...the bartenders were adequate...although I am still flummoxed as to how it can take nearly 15 minutes to get a cup of hot tea when the place wasn't THAT busy at 11:20 on a Sunday morning. They weren't serving alcohol yet. Anyway...On to the food.At the bar, while we waited for our table ( and again, not complaining about the wait, we ASSUMED we'd be waiting at least an hour, and we were right ), we ordered a basket of breakfast bread.This was probably the highlight of the meal, in hindsight.I particularly liked the mini muffins with lingonberries. Nice touch.Once we were finally seated in the main dining room...it was like bedlam on steroids.WAY too many busboys and runners...too few members of the waitstaff. This lead to us getting 5 cups of coffee delivered for a table of 4...and only 3 of us ordered coffee.Our waiter was friendly, quiet, and absolutely in-over-his-head. Just before taking our order, he had knocked over something liquid filled and scream-inducing at the table next to us...Our meals were bland and really unimpressive. Their ""Nuggets and Toast"" might be intended as a play on Chicken and Waffles, but they tasted like dry batter and wet bread. Saving grace there was that my wife was given a little bottle of Red Rooster syrup to take home.I had the Baked Eggs and Mac 'n Greens. Bland, tasteless, and not how I ordered them. The Eggs were ordered soft...they came out close to the consistency of hard boiled. The eggs were served in some kind of weird ""sauce"" that I'm assuming was supposed to be a custard of some kind...but it was mediocre at best. The Mac 'n Greens were oily and not creamy, but the added bitterness of the greens were truly appreciated to cut all that grease.Our friends had the burger ( served medium rare, ordered medium well ), and the blackened catfish sandwich ( meh...fish seemed fresh, but the blackened seasoning frankly wasn't blackened enough ). The overall seasoning theme of the food here, seems to be ""timidity over taste.""One note about restaurants that don't have salt and pepper on the table. STOP.IT. I hate asking for it, and if you're going to be that pretentious about it, damn well make sure your food is seasoned properly. I was desperate for flavor...my taste buds were craving actually tasting SOMETHING...but with the craziness of the service, I opted to just dive in, eat fast, and get out.Sure, we could have sent things back and asked them to be redone...but it was so bat-shit crazy in there, we just wanted to get a move on. Let's face it, even if we sent stuff back...would it really have changed THAT much?The restaurant itself WANTS you to stay...to sit back and relax and sip a nice cocktail or two and enjoy your meal.The service however, screams Cheesecake Factory during dinner rush. In, out, on to the next table...This place has a decision to make...embrace what you seem to want to be; an upscale take on classic soul food, catering to an eclectic and diverse cast of characters from the neighborhood and beyond...Or accept what it seems like it's actually becoming; a tourist destination, 80 blocks too far to travel to really be worth it.",7,4,0,Mike B.,"Brooklyn, NY",52,99,0
3.0,3/17/2011,"Oh, Marcus Samuelsson, how I admire you so. I've wanted to try Red Rooster since I first heard Chef Samuelsson was building a new restaurant in Harlem, and I wanted even more to love everything about it. Sadly, after having dinner there last night with my friends, I discovered while there is a lot to like, there isn't nearly as much to love.The bar at the front is very trendy and lively, surprisingly crowded for a Wednesday night. Chef Samuelsson was actually walking around and greeting various customers around the bar while we were waiting, and at one point he was a foot away from our group. I froze like a total fangirl as he brushed past us, but I always find it very cool when a famous chef is actually in his own restaurant, saying hello to people. Once our table was ready, we were led downstairs to a separate dining room, which offered a very cozy feel.Our waiter was friendly and fabulous, and tried to be as helpful as he could with the menu. He asked if we'd like to start with some corn bread, and we figured we might as well while we wrestled with our menu choices. Being from the south, I have certain expectations when it comes to corn bread, and Red Rooster's version didn't disappoint. It was very moist and full of flavor, the tomato jam was interestingly savory and spicy, and it's impossible to argue with honey butter.After some debate my friends decided on the mac and greens and the chickpea dumplings, and, being in the mood for the ultimate comfort food, I went for the oxtails. (My favorite Filipino dish is kare kare, which is oxtails in peanut sauce.) I actually was fairly pleased with my dish, as it came out with three huge pieces of oxtail on a bed of what I believe was pureed plantain, as well as a grilled piece of plantain and a few plantain chips. The braise was simple, juicy and comforting, which was all I was looking for when I ordered the dish.My dinner companions felt very differently about their dishes. The chickpea dumplings were underwhelming without much flavor, and the mac and greens were a huge disappointment. I took a bite of the mac and cheese to see what my friend meant when she said it was the worst mac and cheese she'd ever had, except for maybe Velveeta. Initially it tasted like mashed potatoes, but as I chewed I could see what she meant: It wasn't creamy or cheesy enough. I could see the idea behind using more subtle cheeses, but the execution was lacking. Mac and cheese should never be that flavorless. She managed to eat all of the greens, which she said were okay, but she got through maybe 1/4 of the mac and cheese, buried it in salt in hopes that it would improve the flavor, and finally gave up.She let the waiter know how displeased she was with the dish, and he was very understanding and apologetic. He mentioned that the menu was still a work in progress, and that they'd actually had complaints about the mac and greens early on but had tried to make some improvements the week prior. He took her dish off of the final check, said he would pass the world along to the executive chef, and brought us each a piece of whiskey fudge on the house, which was delicious, rich and with a great salty/sweet combination.Overall it was an underwhelming experience, but we chalked it up to the fact that it's a risk you always take when you try a new place in New York, especially one that's so new and still in a discovery/experimental stage. It's quite possible that had we ordered two different dishes, the experience would have changed vastly, but alas, it was what it was. I appreciated the way the waiter handled things at the end of the meal, and since I thought my dish was fine, I'd say three stars with some definite room for improvement. I'm hoping over the next year the menu will evolve and we can give it another go.",1,1,1,Leizl M.,"New York, NY",239,78,6

3.0,3/16/2011,"I made reservations for lunch for my husband, son and I for last Friday afternoon.  The staff was very warm and welcoming and the restaurant was beautiful.  With a 1pm reservation the restaurant was comfortably full when we arrived but got pretty packed midway through our lunch.  We spotted a few local celebs among the bar crowd so it was kind of fun to feel like we were in an ""it"" place.On to the food...the lemon roasted chicken on a bed of couscous was eagerly anticipated.     I had strong memories of lemon chicken  from a college study abroad trip in Morocco in mind when I decided to order it.  While the couscous was amazing, each piece of chicken was  over cooked and dry.  I was very disappointed because I had a very light breakfast in preparation for a satisfying lunch.  When Marcus came around and shook our hands, I almost told him about the chicken, but I decided to let it go.  Maybe this was a fluke since the man at the table across from me, ordered the same thing and cleaned his plate.  My teenage son ordered the shrimp and dirty rice and loved it, cleaning his plate.My husband ordered the yard bird and was pretty underwhelmed.  I think that all of us were pretty surprised that the item arrived as just a few pieces of chicken on the plate with gravy, but no vegetables or anything accompanying it.   I may not be accustomed to fine dining, but it seemed pretty unusual.  A few days later, my husband admitted that the chicken had an adverse affect on his stomach.  I should have made this comment initially, but the offer of cornbread when we sat down threw us for a loop.  Soon after our beverage order was placed, a waited asked us if we wanted cornbread.  I responded ""yes"" since I assumed it was like a bread basket; standard.  He didn't ask us if we wanted an appetizer, but bread.   I was surprised when my husband mentioned that there was a charge for the bread.  In general, I don't mind paying for bread if I want it, but I don't think it was offered in the most straightforward way.  Finally, before we got our food, we were so impressed by the beauty/vibe of the restaurant that my husband, a very unassuming but senior faculty person at Columbia, suggested  that  he would suggest the restaurant for weekly theory seminar dinners (where they entertain visiting speakers).  Since two out of the three meals we ordered weren't great, he decided that he'd refrain from suggesting the restaurant as an option for these dinners.  Unfortunately, he just didn't want to be responsible for suggesting a restaurant whose food was inconsistent.  This being said, I will try it again on my own and hope that the I'll get luckier next time.",1,0,0,faith M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,0

We wait 10mins just to have our glasses filled with water, after ANOTHER 15mins we decide to leave. I approach the hostess and tell her about the situation and she says ""Oh my god really?

I have had better at Atlanta's airport! I had to add a ton of salt and still the strong taste of nothingness was overwhelming. It was fairly crispy though.The Mac and Cheese ($18 or so at lunch) was not what you'd expect. It came swimming in a pool of grease, and not that little bit of buttery, cheesy grease that's in the homemade dish at Christmas. No, this was a mistake, as if they accidentally emptied the deep fryer onto the dish! This dish is ok when you combine the vinegar covered greens with it, but I wouldn't order it again.

Charles's Southern, even Wells' was better. Compote that came with? Tasted like canned tomatoes. Fried chicken? Good spices but overall came burnt, far too crispy to be good. Gravy?

We started off with some personalized drinks - the drinks we wanted off the menu weren't available, so the bartender made us something off the top of his head. Pretty good. Also pretty awesome that he was kind enough to whip up his own concoction based on us describing what we thought tasted good. After being seated, (be prepared to wait, even with a reservation...) we started off with the cornbread, spinach and crab soup and pickled beet salad. WOW. The amalgamation of seemingly random flavors totally blew me away. Who would have thought - pickled beets? Yep. Awesome.For the main course, we ordered the red rooster burger, blackened catfish, and fried yard bird. The burger was cooked perfectly, and the fries came out in this cute little decorative fryer. With an extra bottle of cajun spice, we just dumped that all over the fries to give it an extra kick. The catfish came with black eyed peas that complimented the main dish perfectly. The yard bird was fried chicken taken to a whole other level. The food is supposed to be an inspired mix of southern/ethiopian (if I recall the waiter saying) and the flavors tasted like they were coming from all over the place, but melding very nicely together. We thought we were finished after the main course. We were SO full. But, gotta try that dessert! We split the condensed milk flan, sweet potato donuts, spiced pudding and ice cream.

To begin:the reservationist told me not to worry about getting a reservation, that they would make sure to seat us. I figured with such a brave statement, they couldn't possibly leave me waiting in Harlem for long, right?WRONG!An hours worth of waiting was spent in the nearby Marshall's. Which I believe is where they bought all the random stuff that covered the walls in the Red Rooster. After finally sitting down, I found the chairs to be ridiculous. I was sat with two other couples on a small table, and these ""chairs"" would tilt forward and back, but not...you know....just be chairs. The first apps were the dirty rice and tacos. I believe they meant to say ""mini"" tacos but couldnt fit it on the menu. These tacos were maybe 2 inches wide, and the flavor was not memorable. The dirty rice was at least surprising, though a little toothsome. The macaroni and cheese uses NY cheddar, which is a mistake. The whole flavor the Mac and Cheese is kind of dull. The accompanying salad is pretty plain.I found even the desserts to be borderline awful. The beignet's were advertised as being ""sweet potato"" derived, but tasted ""just normal"".

1.0,3/1/2011,"If I could give this place less than one star I would!! I've been hearing all of the buzz about Red Rooster and wanted to try it. I've eaten at Acqavit a few times and in most of the finer restaurants around the City so I thought if I can go to Harlem and get top notch food without trekking downtown then I'm all for it!  Well, Red Rooster is by no means top notch. Actually, it's below notch.   Lets talk about all the bad things because they are REALLY BAD: (1) if you don't have a reservation don't bother going.  They will seat you in what I term the ""coach"" section, which is essentially a cafeteria style 6-person table away from the main dining area, next to the entrance where you are seated on chairs that can only hold one butt cheek (I'm a size 2 and I had trouble staying on the chair).  I have no problem eating with strangers, but this was too close for comfort. When the last two people joined our table (they had to take the two middle seats), one of them immediately said ""is this the place where we wait to be seated in the dining room"". Once her friend replied ""no"", she said ""this is like the middle seat of the airplane."" Problem 1: if I'm going to be seated in the ""coach"" section then I shouldn't have to pay ""first class"" prices  (2) the food!  Only one word describes it...HORRIBLE. I initially ordered the blackened catfish and my husband ordered the salmon. I took one bite of the catfish and it was so salty and tough that I couldn't bear to stomach another bite. I immediately sent it back and then ordered the red snapper. The red snapper was by far the most disgusting piece of fish that I've had EVER! It arrived surrounded by what looked like clear, but chunky vomit with floating pieces of burnt cauliflower.  The fish was rubbery, had an awful taste and definitely wasn't fresh. Again, one bite and I was done. I couldn't believe it, but It was worse than the catfish!!  I may have vomited if I ventured to take a second bite.  My husband's salmon was edible, but just ""regular"" in his words. I tried it and it was indeed regular, nothing particularly special about it. After sending back the second plate the manager, trying to be discreet as possible, apologized for the food. He even admitted that he was ""looking into"" what happened with the fish, which leads me to believe that he tasted the red snapper and had one of those...wow this is gross moments!  The GOOD:(1) Our waiter--Joseph! Awesome! Once my husband found out that we would be seated in what he termed the ""coach"" section he was disappointed. He unsuccessfully tried to get us moved to ""first class"", by explaining that it was my birthday, but he couldn't. Joseph immediately said that he would make our time there special.  And I have to say, if it wasn't for Joseph I wouldn't have anything good to say about this place. He was very attentive, kept the mood light hearted even though he could tell that I was very disappointed. He was a truly excellent waiter. He ordered the cornbread for us (for free) because he really wanted us to try it. It wasn't bad. I also got free champagne and a slice of cake. (2) The decor and ambiance was really nice. It is very vibrant and probably a good place to go for drinks only.",2,2,0,Jenay G.,"Teaneck, NJ",3,2,4

4.0,2/23/2011,"A missed opportunity to go to Aquavit recently and seeing Marcus Samuelsson win Top Chef Masters urged me to give Red Rooster a try.  I like the decor and ambience of this place--vibrant, posh yet comfortable.  I can easily go here just for drinks (read further for disclaimer though).With a reservation, we were seated in the main dining area within 10 minutes.  The menu is a foreigner's take on American comfort food with the exception of ""Helga's Meatballs,"" but hey, no complaints if the food is good.  We got the oysters with ginger mignonette to start, and it came with a lemon vodka shot that went exquisitely well with the oysters.  The plating was quite deceiving as the oysters were plated on top of ""edible sand?""  It had the look of sand, and being curious if it was edible since it was on a plate, I took a dab to try--it was edible but just bland (like super fine unsalted bread crumbs).  Be warned: not everything on the plate at Red Rooster is edible.  Regardless, it was a good and fun dish.For entrees, I got the dirty rice & shrimp, and oh maaaan!, that was pretty darn good.  Curry-flavored rice and jumbo shrimp, I wanted more.  Also got a side of black vinegar cauliflower with sesame, sumac, and pine nuts, and they were incredibly easy to eat with lots of flavors and crunchy cauliflowers (that might be a personal preference).  Bf got the barley entree with sunchokes, salsify, and soy broth, and he was quite taken away by it.  To end our meal, we shared the spiced pudding with apricot and blackcurrant (MY FAV!!!!) sorbets.  It was a great end to our meal...Sigh, onto the not-so-good parts, the service and the drinks.  We had mediocre service even though it appeared that there were many servers and busboys around this not-so-big dining area.  Our water glasses stayed empty for the most part, the food took a tad longer than usual to come, the waiter forgot our drink orders until we were done with our entrees, and the bar ran out of some of the drinks and made some burn-your-throat-as-you-drink cocktails.  I got the ""Bourbon Negroni,"" and man, it was incredibly hard to drink with so much alcohol that just didn't taste good.  Bf got the ""Brownstoner,"" and while it was slightly easier to drink, it was bitter and potent.  Thank goodness for the spiced pudding to lessen the blows of those drinks.Perhaps the bad service and drinks were an one-time incident.  The good food there is enough to lure me back for more adventures (hopefully for the better).",1,0,0,Judy C.,"Munich, Germany",124,707,136

5.0,2/15/2011,"Hand down, this was the best brunch I've ever hand. In any borough. City. Country. Planet.   And that's not just the cocktails talking (though they are good enough to merit that kind of hyperbole).At every step, they found a way to delight and surprise:Bread basket came with some ridiculously yummy honey butter.  Baked eggs came with home made embedded croutons.  Waffles and toast turned out to be french toast.  In fact the menu is downright modest.  Warning - this means that many dishes have ingredients not listed on the menu (fair enough, and when one arrived with a pesto made from a nut someone in our party was allergic to, our waitress brought her a new entree a few minutes later and didn't charge us even though we hadn't asked).  I've only had the one brunch but it was clear at every step that an intense amount of care - and joy - had gone into ever step of the experience.Oh one other brunch note: the gospel duets were cute, and somehow both thoroughly unabtrusive and yet also a hell of a lot of fun to watch.  But maybe that sort of duality is routinely possible on whatever magical planet samuelson comes from.  Put your hands up!",0,0,0,andrew G.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,33,0
1.0,2/15/2011,"My husband kept insisting that we try this restaurant because everyone he knows who've dined there raved about the food. We went early on a Sunday evening. Bad idea!!! First impression: the front of house staff were rude and full of themselves. I made him leave. He begged to try again a month later, and the second time it was even worse! He had called to see about making a reservation and was told that they were booked, but if we arrived early we could have first dibs at the cocktail tables. He was told that they opened for business at 5:30. We arrived at 5:26, and people were already there. Wtf? My husband approached the host stand, and was told that they were checking on the status of the cocktail tables, which were ALL unoccupied. She never returned. Mind you, there was enough staff around to assist in this matter. After waiting for about fifteen minutes for her to get back to us my husband approached ""the greeter"". In mid conversation he ignored my husband after someone else arrived. The lady that was supposedly assisting us was just standing there! RUDE AND INCOMPETENT! They must not know how to multitask.

As a uptown resident who lives and works in the same neighborhood, sometimes you just wanna stay local and have a great time with your people....Red Rooster is a sad attempt at something, just don't know what it is. After a 2hr wait for a table on a friday night, and a $80 tab at the bar, the food was WACK. Anybody who's raving is just a fan of Marcus Samualsson. We all ordered something different, so we could taste each other's food. I had the salmon, my friends had the oxtails, and I forgot the other dish but it was fish. All lackluster!

3.0,2/13/2011,"Went here for brunch on a Sunday afternoon and didn't wait long at all for a table.  We were sat right next to the Kitchen.  The ambiance was nice, good decor, and a nice diverse crowd.  Also, there was a gospel duo there too singing.  It was a nice touch.They brought out some bread which was soft and good.  We didn't order any appetizers but did a basket of fries, which were good but $7.  On to the entrees, my friend and I both ordered the nuggets and toast which is a interpretation of chicken and waffles.  This dish is a failure, we had to send our first plates back because the chicken was hard and old, seems like the nuggets were under a heat lamp for 2 hours prior.  The toast and chicken were drowned in syrup.  The syrup was good but I would have preferred it on the side. The 2nd dish was fresher but was bland.  My wife ordered the chocolate waffles which she said was average at best.  My other friend ordered the shrimp and grits and loved her dish.  She loved her bloody mary as well.  The waiter, busers, and the manager were great as the service was impeccable.  We sat next to the kitchen and unfortunately, one of the cooks dropped some honey mustard and it splattered all over my friend.  Luckily, the manager came and took her to the restroom to help clean her up.  They also comped our bill $20.Overall, I was really impressed by the restaurant itself and the service.  The food, not so much.  I know it was brunch but the menu items could use a refresher.  This is a soul-food fusion type place but the concept didn't seem to work well for me.  Some things keep need to be kept simple.  I've been to a similar restaurant on the south side of Chicago and the ambiance was the same, but the food was much better.I'll definitely return for dinner though. The service impressed me and i'll like to come hang out and have some drinks as well.  I want to see this restaurant succeed.",1,0,0,Roy L.,"New York, NY",125,250,0

3.0,2/10/2011,"So far Red Rooster is like that perfect-on-paper guy/gal that you keep dating, just hoping that this time there will be fireworks.  You know, the one who's well-educated, well-read, attractive, polite, charming, and totally into you, but who you can't seem to fall for.First, the perfect: The decor and people watching are fabulous - everything that is wonderful about our crazy, gentrifying neighborhood.  1. I could spend an hour in the bathroom alone, admiring the old photos on the walls & just chilling in the quiet spacious space.  2. The staff is attentive, friendly, accommodating, and plentiful. 3. Marcus Samuelsson came over to say hi on my second visit.Now, the sad part: The food I've had so far is just ok.  1. The Baked Eggs are awfully dry and the chorizo tasted like kielbasa (too sweet & not at all spicy - and really isn't that always the problem with those perfect-on-paper types?).2. The Fried Chicken Caesar Salad had tiny scraps of dry, leftover chicken in a pile of bitter greens (although I was excited by the poached egg on top).  3. It's pricey.Here are my caveats: I've only been to Red Rooster for brunch and have a feeling I didn't order what this place may be great for - steak, burgers, grits etc.  So I'll give it another shot for dinner, but otherwise will stick to coming for cocktails and people watching at the curvaceous copper bar and quiet time in the beautiful chandeliered bathrooms.  I'm not ready to give up on our relationship just yet!",1,2,0,Sarah W.,"Somerville, MA",12,9,0
5.0,2/10/2011,"OK - so after reading some of the reviews, I almost didn't even go to Red Rooster.  There were complaints about the decor, the staff and the food.  From the second I walked into the place, the staff couldn't have been any more attentive in trying to find me a seat, in stopping by my table to see how everything was going and in general, distinguishing this place from the others.  If I could give the staff ten stars, I most certainly would.  Service from when we walked into the door, to when we were served to when we asked for our check was amazing.  Even on the way out I was asked by everyone how my experience was.  One word:  Fantastic.I went with two other people and we pretty much shared everything we ordered - almost Italian family style.  We started off with the Pickled Beets, Dirty Rice and Shrimp and the Spiced Duck Liver Pudding.  Everything was above par, but the Spiced Duck Liver pudding stood out and was by far my favorite.  I am actually not going to go on and review each dish, because everything was fantastic.  Perhaps some of the negative reviews come due to the fact that this is atypical Harlem dining.  The flavors are not in your face, but more subdued and complex.  After reading the reviews that some of the dishes were bland, I was initially set to agree, however, in taking my time and really tasting the food, everything is extremely flavorful and it seems almost as if the flavor comes in layers.Anyhow, I couldn't recommend this place any more...... it's pricey, but you get what you pay for!",2,0,0,Vin F.,"Chestertown, NY",28,45,2
1.0,2/6/2011,"Very disappointing experience.  Had read reviews and were excited to try it out.  Called in advance and were told if we arrive by 5:45pm we should be able to get a table without too much of a wait. Arrived then and waited at the bar for a table.  When they finally offered us a table it was in a boring basement that is nothing like the main dining area.  We asked if we could wait for a table in the main dining area and the hostess said it shouldn't be too long.  The hostess never once came up and gave us an update while we waited and spent $$$ at the bar on drinks.   Another party came in after us without a reservation and was seated at a nice table in the main dining area.  When I asked the hostess why they were seated before us she said since that table is near the bar it is considered part of the bar. We would have loved to have that table but they didn't have the courtesy to offer it to us after waiting almost 3 hours.    Mr. Big Shot ""marcus"" came out of the kitchen on occasion to ""Paris Hilton"" the red carpet and glad hand patrons for some photo ops.  He came up to us for a handshake. I let him know that we were excited to try his food but were getting frustrated with the staff on how they were handling our wait.  He was so unprofessional and condescending, just said ""Socialize and enjoy your wait"" and then ran off so as not to have to deal with any ""problems"".  VERY LAME and surprising response from a business owner.  I was shocked and disappointed how he handled this.  Make me suspect that he is not really the owner of the place... just a puppet for publicity for other deep pockets behind the scene who really run the place (poorly).  Shams do not last in NYC and I think this one will be revealed eventually.  At 9 pm we gave up and went to get a burger at Mels on the upper west. After spending 3 hours there I cannot comment on the food since I never was able to eat it.  But I can comment on the ""vibe"" of the place.  Nice decor, but very calculated like a Madison Ave interior design firm with restaurant credentials applied their ""formulas"" for a successful hip restaurant.

4.0,2/5/2011,"This is for Katherine Zapf...The tomato jam was sweet and had what tasted like ethiopian flavors and then mixing it with the honey butter made the cornbread sing!  I had the spiced duck liver pudding, which was nothing like I thought it would be...smooth, light and decadent.  (yes, i sneaked my finger in there to not waste any of it.)  geoffrey did the corn taco and tostada...lots of light levels of flavor with a tasty crunch.  They were exactly what appetizers should be.  My blackened catfish was so freaking fantastic with a mild, yet substantial spice that was savory yet balanced with maybe a nutmeg or cinnamon?  (again, im tasting a lot of ""world flavors"" coming out of it)  The Uptown Steak Frites had mushrooms and of course french fries that sat over a rich truffle flavored bernaisse sauce.  (yeah, go ahead and slap me, it was good!)  For cocktails, get The Cat's Meow, but ask them to make it a little spicy.  Woof!  Atmosphere is warm and comfortable, it feels like a place you could just hang out, our server was extremely attentive.  As a new place, they are still working out some kinks. (some spoiled yuppy kids were whining next to us about not getting enough attention...I hope they had a nice ride home on the Path train!)   Overall, we had a great experience and were pleased with very accessible dishes that were elevated by the new flavors in them.  Im hoping the initial hype dies down a bit, since I would love to make it my neighborhood go-to place.  Right now, it's like impossible to get a table.",0,1,0,James P.,"New York, NY",125,64,3
3.0,2/3/2011,"Clarification: the food here is great. Really, really great. I live a few blocks away, and ever since I moved to Harlem a few months ago I've been excited about Marcus Samuelsson's restaraunt. No joke, the food in Harlem is not of the variety/quality I enjoyed when I lived downtown. So I've been to Red Rooster four or five times since the opening, and two things remain consistent: excellent food, abysmal service.The first time I went, I sat at the bar. Actually, this was probably my best overall experience. My friend and I ordered cornbread and the lox & lax. Both items were really good-- the tomato jam is a great complement to the cornbread, and the mustard-fennel-lox flavor combination is really excellent. He ordered a beer but I tried the Cat's Meow, which is a gin drink with lillet that's really nice, if a little sweet.The second time I came I went for the whole shebang. My friend traveled up from the East Village in the driving snow for our 10:00 reservation. At 9:55 the host calls my phone twice (?) to make sure we're coming. We arrive at 10 on the dot, and are seated immediately. Then the service mishaps begin. I've worked as a waitress in NY restaurants, so I'm relaxed and understanding and not usually fazed by small or even not-so-small service issues. But no one gave us menus for 10 full minutes, when I finally made eye contact with the 5-6 servers milling about and asked for the menu. My friend and I love sparkling wine, so we ordered a bottle. The waitress seemed totally confused by my order, having me point to the bottle twice and then going to ask the bartender for about 5-10 minutes to make sure he had the bottle. He confirms that they do, she takes our order, and everything seems cool.Except she forgot about the bottle. Our appetizers arrive some ten minutes later and we still don't have our drinks. The food itself was reallllllly great. We got the lump blue crab cakes and the cornbread (again). The cakes were light and flaky but also substantial. We're just about done our appetizers when the bottle finally arrives. Oops.The entrees came out as soon as the appetizer plates were whisked away. My friend ordered the oxtail, which was sublime. The meat was so fatty and tender. The only problem would be that it was almost too rich, she couldn't bring herself to eat the whole serving. I obliged to help her out. i ordered the shrimp and red grits, which was also delicious. Its a pool of creamy red grits with 3-4 shrimp on top and chunks of spicy sausage. I'm a sucker for grits, but these were excellent. By the end of our entrees the waitress had been MIA for awhile and our glasses were in need of a refill from our bottle, which was nowhere to be found. We asked another server to help us out. He looked around nervously and said he'd find our waitress. Eventually, she returned and filled our glasses. We placed a dessert order for the sweet potato donuts, which are in and of themselves worth the trek from the outermost reaches of any of the boroughs. So moist, so delicious, so perfect. The experience would have been perfect if it weren't for the server's inattentiveness. The most frustrating part was that the restaurant was emptying out, its not like we came at prime rush hour. We like eating later, since 10:00 reservations are easy to get anywhere at the last minute. I've been back twice since that dinner and tried a number of other things on the menu. The lemon-roasted chicken with the excellent cous cous is a great choice. The service has been slightly better these other times. As in, someone occasionally popped in to check on us. My roommate went there with her boyfriend for brunch and likewise had a terrible service experience. She's allergic to wheat. She asked the server to help her choose something that would adhere to her gluten-free diet. This is probably not all that uncommon of a request, since everyone seems to be allergic these days. The waitress suggested she try a certain egg dish (not sure which one), and when it arrived at the table it had chunks of bread baked in to the dish. Oops. Definitely worth the trip to Harlem. The food, the ambience, and the crowds are A+. Hopefully the servers can start pulling their weight, too.",0,0,0,Jacqueline J.,"Manhattan, NY",5,13,0

4.0,2/3/2011,"Like modern museums and new American food? Well, this is the place for you! Last week, my coworkers and I had lunch here to celebrate our birthdays. From the moment I stepped in, I couldn't believe the amount of art/history displayed at the restaurant. With so much to see and marvel over, the space felt like a homage to Marcus Samuelsson's persona and the Harlem Renaissance. It's crazy but food became the last thing on my mind. Let me paint a quick picture. The restaurant is set up so that the semi-circle bar is located in the front. Next to the bar are cafe-like seatings bordered by an ""antique show"" bookcase. The bar's liquor wall serves as a divide between the front and the back dining space, a French bistro/speakeasy style dining space with an open fire kitchen. As far as the food is concerned, the limited lunch menu was a stark contrast to the library of artwork on display. We ordered the meatball and current dish, the hamburger with truffle fries, the gravel-ox sandwich and blackened cod. The meatballs and the burger were the best of the bunch. For dessert, we ordered the flan, yes, it was creamy but the best thing about the dessert was the complementary amazing coconut ice cream! Loved that we also got one dessert on the house-- warm sweet potato donuts. The size of donut holes, each bite gushed out some yummy sweet potato cream/syrup. Mix it with its sidekick lemony sorbet, well, you have another a la mode concoction. Great drinks and service, decent food and very charming bathroom, this place is a refreshing addition in the neighborhood. It's worth checking out as long as you don't mind the overstimulating decor and likelihood of dining with Harlem's powerhouse and New York's political staff.

2.0,2/2/2011,"Great ambiance, friendly staff, novelty restaurant in Harlem.  However, the brunch is just OK.  I had the Caesar chicken as a starter, the baked eggs with tomatoes and mozzarella.  The baked eggs were bland and dry. What a disappointing and amateurish dish.  The tomatoes and mozzarella were drowning in a vinaigrette dressing - tomatoes were soggy. Coffee arrived spilled on the saucer and it took 30 mins to arrive.  For desert the spice cake was delicious but ridiculous as it was the size of a half lemon.  And the ice cream for $3 is all of 4 teaspoons and comes in a butter/condiment bowl - TINY, not even a quarter the size of a regular single scoop. As much as I wanted to, I sadly was not impressed with the flavors, creativity, presentation or value for money.  I will go back for lunch or dinner to give it a second chance.",1,0,0,Ericka M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0
4.0,2/1/2011,"Red Rooster is a great addition to the dining out options in Harlem.  Chef Samuelsson happened to be there on Tuesday, February 1, 2011 when I went with two friends to celebrate my birthday.The vibe and ambiance there are warn, nice and immediately upon entering the restaurant the aromas engulf you.  Curry and cinnamon stand out in my memory.  But also the greeting from the hostess and coat check attendant made me feel immediately welcome and ready for our 45-minute wait (which ended up being only a 30-minute wait).  The wait was worthwhile because Chef Samuelsson was making rounds in the bar area and we got to meet him; always a nice addition.  If you can, sit at the chef's table where we were lucky enough to score.  From here you see all the kitchen action which ran surprisingly smooth considering how packed the place got in the 30 minutes we had been there.FOODAppetizers: the tacos and tostados with yellowtail were divine as was the dirty rice with shrimp. We also had crab cakes but I have to admit they were delicious but didn't send me over the moon, but none ever have.Entree: I had the blackened catfish which had just debuted on the menu the day before.  It was delicious with capers and black eyed peas and cabbage/slaw topping.  What I love about the food here is the perspective taken on the concept of these traditional dishes.  Dessert: How could you not love sweet potato doughnuts?  These were more like doughnut holes with a sweet potato creme filling with whipped cream and lemon sorbet.  DIVINE.We also had a chocolaty delight of a cheesecake, mango and blackberry sorbet.I can't wait to go back and definitely recommend everyone to visit at least once for yourself because some of the reviews are quite harsh.  Just go knowing the dining experience won't sent you to the moon but you'll glad you visited 310 Lenox Avenue.",0,0,0,Rudy M.,"New York, NY",1191,41,24
4.0,2/1/2011,"Definitely a big step in the right direction for Harlem!  I have now been to Red Rooster twice, both times for brunch.  Based on my first trip I would have given Red Rooster a 5 for atmosphere, a 3.5 for service, and a 3 for food.  I did have  the pleasure of meeting  Marcus Samuelsson which was a huge treat!  Happily, Trip 2 turned out to be a much better experience.  Here's my rundown: Round 1:   I ordered the wood-oven baked eggs with chorizo and onion.  I expected this to be more like a fritatta with the ingedients all inside.  Instead, the eggs were served in a cast-iron pan with the chorizo and onion on the side.  The eggs themselves were a bit tasteless and overdone.  The chorizo and onion added a bit more flavor but didn't blow me away.  I was a little disappointed to find out that Red Rooster doesn't serve iced coffee, which to me is a brunch staple.  On the good side, I sat at the communal table and had the pleasure of meeting a fascinating patron who kept me chatting away for well over an hour.Round 2: We got there a few minutes before 11 and were seated within a few minutes.  We ordered the bread basket, shrimp n grits, and the waffles.  The bread basket was not very impressive and almost seemed store bought- a bit of a disappointing start to the meal.  Still no iced coffee- hoping that changes soon.  But then on to the shrimp n grits and waffles.  These were both delicious!  I couldn't have been happier.  Although my experiences were mixed, I am rooting for this place to succeed as it brings a whole new life to the Harlem food scene.  The atmosphere is fantastic and there are definitely some spectacular food items on the menu.  Maybe Red Rooster will consider a suggestions box to enhance the experience further.",0,0,0,Leah G.,"New York, NY",15,22,0
2.0,2/1/2011,"I wanted to love Red Rooster so badly as one of the reviewers mentioned due to what I heard of the Executive Chef and am desperately looking for fine cuisine in Harlem.  Unfortunately Red Rooster missed the mark big time! My family and I attempted to first have brunch on a Saturday but was cooly received by the hostess and was informed they were no longer accepting walk-ins and not to bother to put our names on the waiting list because brunch would be over by the time a table was available.  The hostess then went on to say if we come back for dinner we would be seated immediately at 5:30pm.  We arrived at 5:30pm ready to consume a tasty and savory meal but the meal was anything but  that.  We ordered fish tacos and the cherry nuts as appetizers which arrived after our main course selections of red snapper, oxtail and Mac and cheese...truly bizarre.  The waiter apologized profusely and comped the appetizers.  As far as the food a 2 star at best.  The snapper was underwhelming and mildly seasoned, for $26 I was expecting the snapper to burst with flavor. The presentation of the oxtails was very poor: three fatty pieces of meat with a slab of plantains and no sides.  My sister mentioned it was rubbery and poorly seasoned as well.  The free appetizers were unfortunately lacking too. The  Fish tacos were not seasoned and the fruit and nuts should be dropped from the menu.  The wait staff was courteous but the hostesses were aloof and unfriendly.  The food presentation overall lacked the joy and polish you would expect entrees priced above $20 to possess.  Also although the decor was hip and cool, the management of this restaurant from how people are seated, meal presentation, lack of cohesion in cuisine (confused cultures represented in the entrees) need a complete rehaul.  With all of the great restaurants in Manhattan I would not return.  It is such a shame since the chef has gotten so much buzz.",1,0,0,Pauline M.,"Yonkers, NY",22,9,0
4.0,2/1/2011,"The restaurant gets five stars for ambiance.  It has tables for folks with reservations and a Community table which accommodated those of us who did not, and didn't want to wait.  The staff was friendly, helpful, and professional.The food was good, but not really right for my palate. The yard bird was spicy as advertised, but I think I would have liked it better with a little less heat.My dining companion had the shrimp and grits and felt that there was not enough grits. It did look a little sauce heavy. The thing to remember is that this is not going to be traditional soul food.  It is Chef Samuelsson's take on soul food. Not a bad thing at all.

2.0,1/31/2011,"There was sooooo much hype around this restaurant I just had to get here!  The ambiance was really nice and the service was great as well.  Unfortunately, I was hungry and that is not what I went for.  I went for great food.  Wrong location.  I ordered 3 things from the menu.  The tacos, the shrimp and grits and the cauliflower.  I was disappointed by all but one, the tacos.  I don't understand how shrimp and grits can really be destroyed like that and CAULIFLOWER... I was floored.  I make it better at home with salt and pepper and for about $11 less and I'm a pure amateur.  I was so disappointed by this visit.  The food was BEYOND flavorless.  Please don't believe the hype.  The only way I will return with the intention of buying food is if they make some adjustments in the kitchen.  So so sad.  I wanted to LOVE this place. *tear*",0,0,0,Nichole W.,"New York, NY",64,23,3
2.0,1/30/2011,"Ever since I'd heard of Marcus Samuelsson's new place in Harlem, my mouth has been watering anticipating the delicious flavor of the yardbird.  Apparently anticipation is all that I would have.The yardbird was spicy without being flavorful and that hurt my tongue, my heart and my dreams...I wish I could say something better about the chicken but it was bland beyond all hope.  The hearth baked mac and greens were low on tastiness though the idea of them, gouda, pasta, greens baked together, seemed yummy.The warm apple pie dessert was a win for the taste buds.  Though it wasn't earth-shattering , it provided a dependably pleasant end to a meal I really could have done without.I will have to come again and try other entrees or just check out the bar.  The decor is incredible and they eye candy is quite nice.  I got to see Donnell Rawlings aka ""Ashy Larry"" and Cicely Tyson throughout the evening.I will definitely give it another go or 2 as it settles in beyond its newness.",2,1,1,Theresa L.,"Bronx, NY",409,19,9
4.0,1/30/2011,"Being a lifelong New Yorker, I've seen many celebrities and have hardly given a second look at most of them.  But when I saw Chef Marcus Samuelsson, dunks and all, going around the bar and shaking hands with patrons (totally shook hands with him!), I admit I was kind of star struck.That's probably because cooking shows make up half of my TV watching.  Also, the restaurant was handsomely designed and decorated--among other things, the rustic shelving had an ABBA vinyl and a playboy featuring Pam Grier.  Not out of place given Samuelsson's background and excellent taste.  Basically, he had me at hello.The food was good! and I say that heartily.  Even though the portions were slightly scant, the dishes were comforting and complex interpretations of soulful classics.The fried yardbird had a flavorful skin, moist meat, and was well-seasoned.  The Swedish meatballs and mash, named after his grandmother, blanketed me in warmth.But yo, the foie gras ganache was fucking ethereal!  I was and still am at a loss of words to describe that unearthly dish of salty, sweet, and creamy.  One taste of this dish, and it'll be head-slappingly obvious how Chef Samuelsson married a supermodel.Our server/bartender was totally cool.  He kept hooking me and my friend up with cupful after cupful of Glögg, a hot aromatic Swedish drink made of wine and spiced with cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves.  They also carry Hitachino beer, and if you're in the know about your Japanese beers, you'll have just nodded in deep approval.Even though Red Rooster is headed by a celebrity chef, the prices are quite reasonable.  Two appetizers, two entrées, two drinks, (and unlimited Glögg) came to around $50 each.  And that's WITH tip.  A generous tip.Tell me that Harlem is having its second renaissance and I'll tell you that Marcus Samuelsson is among those leading it.",6,1,1,Sei S.,"Brooklyn, NY",16,25,0
5.0,1/29/2011,"Love it. The staff go out of their way to make it feel neighborly and neighborhoody. Yes, it is expensive, as I would expect a Marcus Samuelsson restaurant to be, and Yes, I wish portions were bigger. But the food was spectacular. Clearly above what most restaurants, even good ones deliver. And for a restaurant with this high quality food, it is probably the least pretentious restaurant I've been in. Usually supremely designed food comes with over-the top pretentiousness. The staff to diner ratio is probably like six to one. This is the best thing to happen to NYC dining in a long time, not just to Harlem. It's kind of like a ""Cheers"" but with better food and staff.",1,0,0,Dj J.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0
5.0,1/28/2011,"This place is fantastic in all respects and praise Jah, it's two blocks away from my home. Marcus S. knocks it out of the park with this one, coming off of the declining Aquavit and an unsuccessful African inspired joint near Union Square. This is a keeper y'all! And yeah the Yard Bird is a touch bland...so is the fried chicken up the block at Sylvia's....so why not branch out and try, oh, anything else on the menu, cos it's all good. Sure they're packed all the time, sure it's tough to get a table, sure the staff is working hard, it's a NYC hot spot, but I've never been treated with anything but respect and reckon they're doing a brilliant job.

2.0,1/28/2011,"Ok, I live in Harlem and had to check Red Rooster. I went there for lunch in a Thursday. The hostess wasn't friendly and although there were seats for two people inside, my friend and I was put in this tall tables with uncomfortable seats. I asked her if we could seat by the normal tables, but she said only if we were more guests. Ok. (For my surprise, when I went to the restroom (oh, their restroom is lovely, by the way) I saw this giant table where some groups of 2 were sitting. There was no excuse to leave us in those terrible seats. Anyway, let's go for the food. The menu was not impressive, we tried a sandwich pork and the meatballs. The meatballs were tiny! The sandwich, was open and pretty small. Not worth the money. The food was pretty good though, but definitely not a place to go if you are hungry. And I don't mean starving, just normal hungry during the day, by lunch time, having had a good late breakfast. My glass was dirty. I mean, really dirty. I had already asked the waiter to change my glass, for no ice, so I didn't even bother to ask for a third glass, and didn't finish my drink.When we arrived, the restaurant wasn't full, but it took ages until someone came to take our orders. And there was a lot of staff in that place!Finally, the environment. Definitely the restaurant is cute and cool and trendy. The music was too loud though, but the ambiance is fantastic.To sum it up, go for hanging out with the ""cool people of the block"", for a snack with the price of a full mean, and expect a so-so service.",3,0,2,Katemari R.,"Porto Alegre, Brazil",167,6,0
4.0,1/28/2011,"I was skeptical at first because I have been hearing so-so reviews of the food here. Mainly that the fried yard bird was bland. I was smart enough to not get that and instead had the Red Snapper: best decision ever. This may be the best red snapper I have ever had; it was seasoned to perfection. The only complaint is that for the price, the portion size was small for Red Snapper. The size was what I would expect for Chilean Sea Bass.I had Oysters for an appetizer and was not impressed. They were no briny at all, and when you are paying $8 for three, I would expect them to be very good.For dessert, I had apple pie which was quite good, but not amazing.The wine list is quite extensive; likely the best list in Harlem, and that's including the numerous wine bars popping up. I had a '08 Oregon Pinot Noir which was excellent and fairly priced.My date had the oxtail, which was fine, but I have had much better for a  third of the price from random West Indian takeout restaurants.Basically, my 4 stars is for my Red Snapper and my wine selection. I can't really vouch for anything else on the menu. The decor is nice and there is an open kitchen, which you don't want to sit right next to because the expediter in there is yelling the whole time. The staff is attentive and generally helpful. When I was choosing my wine, the sommelier was nowhere to be found, but he ended up bringing out my wine and then was all over the place (maybe he was on a break when I was ordering).",2,0,0,Jabari H.,"Brooklyn, NY",38,14,0
4.0,1/28/2011,"The 4th star was earned being that the ever handsome Samuelsson passed my gaze 5 times in the 2 hours I was there.I went on the 19th and the food was OK, but I definitely believe in time, the food will greatly improve. I had:The beef patties (OK. The filling was good, but the crust was a little underdone)Shrimp and Red Grits (Disappointing. While the shrimp were perfect, the grits were watery and bland.)Warm Apple Pie (Awesome! Loved the cheddar crust)My friend had the pumpkin donuts which were amazing.

4.0,1/26/2011,"He was tall. Black coat and black muffler were matching with his skin color. He was enthusiastic when having conversations with diners next to me. He talked about males' participation and females' support (about something) and (that something) would get better so they should never stop. Powerful and sincere handshakes, then he went off to another table. Then another energetic conversation, then another table greeting...  It seemed like he knew everyone at Red Rooster Harlem. It was almost like a civil right movement scene from 1960s.He was not Marcus Samuelsson, a chef at Red Rooster Harlem. Just a diner from Harlem. I think this summarizes the core value of Red Rooster Harlem. This one month old restaurant was taken by neighbors already. You can feel the ownership and pride of neighbors of this place very easily. It's not pretentious one, but joyfully genuine one. It was the first night of 2011 Winter NYC Restaurant week there. Monday, but packed, packed, packed. Surprisingly, I was not annoyed by this crowd, rather excited to feel that I have become a part of the neighborhood. Oh, the sweetness of accepted membership. Red Rooster Harlem has an open kitchen. Most of the staffs are African Americans except some Las Vegas looking White managers. Diners are mixed. We saw a sweet black family celebrating grandma's birthday, a dating black couple, a group of mixed colored youngsters enjoying their youth, middle aged white people checking out the place...While we were fascinated by lively vibe of Red Rooster Harlem, the menu arrived. For Restaurant Week, they have only one dinner menu. You don't have any option to choose. The Restaurant Week menu is pickled beets and hazelnuts (arugula, manchego), hearth baked lemon chicken (couscous, almond, pomegranate), peanut & chocolate (caramel ice cream). It's $35 as you already know. (For lunch, they have their own pre-fix menu which is $17 according to a  receptionist)  Fresh bread was accompanied with warm chickpea puree with aioli. Ethiopian spice was sprinkled on top which made it yum and comforting ; and that was the first and last time we heard the word 'Ethiopian'. We kinda expected to hear the word often because of Marcus Samuelsson, but that was it.Beets were little square bites with mayo and salads. Well seasoned, but beets could be cooked a little longer. It was too crunchy to bite. Overall, fine but nothing special. Baked lemon chicken sounded a little disappointing at first. Too common for Restaurant week menu, you know. However, tender, juicy meat was so delicious. Crispy outside, meaty inside, lemony taste were supporting each other. ""Did they roast this?"" husband asked. ""I don't know, but whatever they did, it's yummy"" I answered, sort of. Later a manager told us the chicken was prepared in the open flame oven. Hot, it is. About 900 F. That was the key to this juicy meat. Raisins were sweet, and couscous was crunchy, but we're not huge fans of those. This roasted barley ($16) was not on the Restaurant week menu. It was a homey, comforting vegetarian menu. We loved it. Roasted barley with roasted root veggies, brussels sprouts, pearl onions in a lemony, salty taste soup; it truly wowed us. Only complain would be peanuts. Do you know that smell of old peanuts? Yep, I smelled that. Other ingredients were fresh, though. If they caught that little detail, I would give this 5 stars. Dessert was peanut & chocolate with caramel ice cream with a slice of banana and nougat. As I kept digging it, I couldn't help thinking 'next spoon will give me a heart attack....' No wonder it was too sweet for husband. Marcus Samuelsson (wearing blue shirt) was busy working at the kitchen. He looked very focused. That was generally true for staffers. Our server seemed knowledgeable about menus; he was confident answering our questions. When our neighbor diner found a little plastic in her ice cream, a manager came and apologized and offered a new one. That was a formal part of it. Then a server visited her again asking about the favorite ice cream. They had a short, but giggly conversation about their childhood ice cream memories. Now THAT was an informal but more intimate part of apology which worked way- better than the formal one.  Bar area was packed, too. Red Rooster Harlem divided the place into two sections, bar and dining, equally.Look at this crowd. Were they discussing the future of Harlem? Or just enjoying a cold winter night with drinks? Whatever that was, it was so energetically lifting. And the loudness seemed like inviting me saying ""What's the hurry? Come, join us!""*Update : On nycgo.com, restaurant week menu is available.

2.0,1/25/2011,"It's nice at an iron chef restaurant, that the chef is still humble enough to greet the diners.  The ambience was great as were the appetizers.  However, every aspect of service was uncredibly slow and the entrees were ridiculously small even though they were basic items like fried chicken.  Loved the crab cakes and cornbread which were tasty  (but not unique) and were reasonably priced.  The Yard Bird entree for $18 was a joke which amount to less actual chicken than a McDonald's 6 piece McNuggets.  No piece of breast was included, just 2 tiny legs slightly bigger than the pieces you would get if you ordered wings at a common bar.  The atmosphere had so much going for it: tall ceilings and an airy open floor plan, music the perfect volume, not so loud you couldn't hear the people at your table but loud enough to drown out the other diners, tables spaced a nice distance apart, friendly servers, etc.In summary, as long as you're not too hungry and go for the ambience you won't be disappointed.",1,0,0,James P.,"San Francisco, CA",121,4,0

Unfortunately my bro and I didn't have reservations so we were told by the hostess that the wait was (are you ready?) two hours!!  I was NOT about wait that long, but wasn't too salty since it WAS a Saturday night in NYC and IS a new spot.  Alas, the hostess informed us there was a lounge downstairs we can go to to wait on a table and that bar food was only being served down there.  We accepted it and went downstairs.Down, down the stairs....We get there and it is a modestly beautiful setting with another dining area in one room and the lounge in another room.  There is a DJ who was on point - playing 80s and 90s music.  The lounge is perfect if you're on a date and want to relax with good music and good diverse company.  We ended up ordering wine (Chardonnay and Cana) and some apps. I had the taco ceviches and my bro had the mac and greens.  The food was good, however, the portions were very small - they only gave two tacos!  And I love ceviche so was very disappointed.What was even more disappointing was how overcrowded the tables were in the lounge.  Since the hostess was sending the reservation overflow downstairs, the seating started getting limited.  And we sat on couches with two couples and we didn't have enough space for our food.  The server gave us a chair (yes, chair!) to accommodate our order.  I was appalled.  Why have a chair!?!?!?  And not have small end tables just in case this happens?   All in all we had a good time and will return to dine in the restaurant.",0,0,0,T H.,"Manhattan, NY",8,50,3
3.0,1/22/2011,"2.5 stars at best. I wanted to love Red Rooster so badly. The food, however, was underwhelming. Pluses: The atmosphere is like frantic orderliness. I went to Red Rooster for Saturday brunch.  The kitchen is open and you can see the chefs preparing the various entrees. And well over a dozen members of the waitstaff were buzzing throughout the restaurant. The decor is well executed.  It sort of replicates a farm or cottage, but with a modern edge. Not a detail is missed in ensuring.We arrived without a reservation at 11am and were seated promptly.  The rush came around 12:30, so I would strongly suggest arriving before noon if you don't have a reservation. They have coat check!Minuses:Boy, was my meal BLAND. I have the Wood Oven Roasted Eggs with the Mac & Greens.  The consistency of the egg dish was somewhere between a poached and a hard boiled egg.  Croutons are baked with the eggs.  As for flavor, it was wholly absent.  I could taste a little something where the croutons had been burnt. As for the Mac & Greens, the pasta shells and greens are baked together creating this soupy and tasteless ABOMINATION. Maybe if the dish had more cheese, the greens more flavorful and the casserole baked for longer it would have been more enjoyable. But I was deeply disappointed and asked for the salt. I still have hope for Red Rooster.  Marcus Samuelsson was at the restuarant and appears to be very committed to the success of Red Rooster.  When a guest (not with my party -- I was eavesdropping) sent his food back, Samuelsson approached the waiter to find out what the issue was and personally returned the dish to the kitchen and spoke with the chef who prepared the dish. I was personally impressed by this. I will at least give it one more go.",7,3,4,Tanisha C.,"Brooklyn, NY",233,184,192

When we finally got a table, the waiter never offered us the standard table bread.  When the food finally came, they didn't even know it was ours. After a few minutes, the waiters who had walked passed us, realized it was our food. We ordered, the chocolate waffles (which were cold and blah!) and the Nuggets and Toast. French toast was deelish but the nuggets were hard as a rock.  For the price, the food didn't live up to the hype, was average and it sucks that the brunch menu is Al la Carte. The waiters weren't attentive at all; they never asked if we wanted anything else and gave us the bill before we were ready....Guess they could tell by our faces, we were DONE. Wasn't worth the money for cold average food....in fact when we left, we headed to Applebee's because we were still starving and the food chain was actually disturbingly better.

4.0,1/21/2011,"I was lucky enough to attend the Friends and Family event at Red Rooster Harlem, which occurred just prior to the grand opening and allowed me to sample a variety of menu items.  Initially, I began the evening with cocktails, enjoying the Savoy with its vodka, lemon, muddled grapes, and agave, but particularly falling in love with the heavier Brownstoner.  Its unique nutmeg-infused bourbon was blended with tart Cherry Heering and aromatic St. Germain.  After a few of these mixed drinks, we were able to transition to a table in the bar area to enjoy the cuisine.  The Corn Bread ""Snack"" was thankfully more on the bread-side than resembling a sweet pastry.  However, it maintained the perfect amount of moisture and was not overly dry.  The cornbread was accompanied by a sweet honey butter and a tangy tomato jam.  The earthy spreads were composed of the freshest ingredients and truly enhanced the nutty flavor of the bread.  Continuing our passion for this Southern yellow crop, we opted for the crisp Corn Tacos & Tostadas, which were stuffed with a refreshing ceviche made from fresh yellowtail, salmon, and avocado.  As the meal progressed, I finished my most recent cocktail and decided to order a glass of the 2009 Italian Ca' Donini Pinot Grigio, which was fragrant and well-balanced.  We continued our tasting with a plate of Helga's Meatballs.  The tender beef possessed the perfect exterior sear and was served atop a bed of buttery, smooth mashed potatoes.  A Swedish lingonberry sauce was drizzled over the meatballs, inviting us into Chef Samuelsson's heritage.  A side order of Yam and Sweet Potato Puree sounded too enticing to pass up, as they were infused with the bold flavors of bacon and horseradish.We then proceeded to dessert, where we feasted on the Warm Apple Pie with its flaky crust made from sharp cheddar cheese.  The apple filling was tender, yet firm, unlike the gooey gelatinous mess often found within.  The apples gave off a powerful aroma, as if they were freshly peeled.  A homemade vanilla whipped cream was a creative winter alternative to ice cream.  The Whiskey Fudge dessert might have come as a smaller portion, but the dense chocolate and chunky macadamia nuts made it an even more decadent treat.There is also no way for me to forego the chance to praise our sweet server.  While the staff was clearly still learning the ropes, she made every effort to entice our palates and keep us engaged in the experience.  Her energetic demeanor and helpful suggestions were greatly appreciated.  As a satisfied visitor during the Friends and Family event, I am sadden to see the mixed reviews for this stylish space.  I found Marcus Samuelsson's home-style cuisine innovative, yet steeped in tradition.",2,0,0,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640
1.0,1/19/2011,"After hearing about Red Rooster for months, (even before it opened) I was sooo excited to dine here.  I made a reservation for january 17th at 8pm (my birthday) for 2.  We arrived a few minutes early and were seated within a few moments, the hostesses were very pleasant.  I think they may have been the best part of the experience.  Our waiter came over within a few minutes, introduced himself and asked if we wanted water and cornbread for the table, (I had to ask him to repeat himself 2x because he was speaking so low).  This was the only time he asked if we wanted something to drink...never once asked if we wanted wine or a cocktail.  About 10 minutes later he took our order, crab cake app, yard bird, mac n cheese & collard greens.  After he took our order he took the order of the people sitting next to us.  20 minutes later he asked if we had received our crabcakes, no we hadnt.  Our crabcakes came to the table (they were very basic) and a few moments later the couple next to us got ALL of their food.  we waited another 30 minutes for our entrees to come out, and when they did I was VERY disappointed.  however tender and juicy the chicken was it was tasteless.  The mac n cheese was not mac and was waaaay too salty, and the collards were just ok.  I expect to be blown away by a ""celebrity chef""  who maybe instead of greeting diners every 10 minutes stays in the kitchen and actually cooks.  The waiter, never reccomended anything, never came to ask if everything was ok, and when we were done with our meal he never asked if we wanted desert and or coffee...ummm hellloooo it was my bday (and they were told that), of course i want desert, but we just got the check and got the heck out of their as fast as we could.   If Chef Samuelsson had come and greeted us after we had food on our table he definitely would have gotten an ear full.When i read the reviews on here I really should have listened to my gut and gone to The Palm like i initially wanted to.   So, listen to your gut, me and the other reviews...we unfortunately are not lying.Horrible, and I will never go back.  Not even to have a drink at the bar which looked quite lively.",2,2,0,Lily R.,"Manhattan, NY",138,12,5
4.0,1/19/2011,"Ever since I heard about Red Rooster opening up I've been waiting on pins and needles for a chance to visit this place. It was definitely worth the wait.Me and a friend got to visit Red Rooster the other night. It's a bit out of the way for me, but it's literally right outside the 125th st. subway station. The decor for me was a little confusing. I really couldn't tell what kind of look they wanted to have. The shelving by the bar filled vintage like books and props gives a more homely feel, yet the dining area felt more modern. The choices of art work on the wall, though nice, felt they lacked any kind of recurring theme.The service was quite friendly and charming. Our waitress was always very attentive, and continuously approached our table with a welcoming smile. Even the servers that weren't working out table were very nice. As we decided where to start with our appetizers one of the waiters slyly walked by and recommended we try out beef patties first. And boy was he right...The food was amazing. Per one the waiter's suggestion, we tried the beef patties first.  The crust was fluffy and tasty, though the filling was a little sparse. The verde sauce on the other hand was perfect. I was quickly hoping we would be able to score a bottle of this. The sauce and the crust more than made up for the skimping on the meat area. We followed that with the cornbread. I'm using not one for cornbread because I feel that it's usually pretty dry, but the cornbread here felt more like a cake. Add on the honey butter and tomato jam and it's a winning combination. The red causer salad was quite delicious. I'm usually not one for salad, but I couldn't stop eating it.For entrees we ordered the mac & greens and the fried yard bird. I'm  very particular about mac & cheese. I feel a lot of times many restaurants try to hard by smashing in as many cheeses as possible. Red Rooster opts for only 3. Which is the perfect number in my opinion. The gouda, cheddar, and comte was a fitting combination to go with the collared greens mixed in. The yard bird was just as tasty. It was fried just right. While the skin was nice and crunchy, the meat was incredibly tender. The white mace gravy just added to it's already rich flavor.For dessert by the advising of our waitress we tried the spice pudding. I'm not a big sweets person, but this was so slightly sweetened that I gobbled it all up. It had a great texture and the flavor reminded me of the the Filipino dish babinka. That's a good thing. It came with apricot and black currant sorbet, which complimented the pudding nicely.The only real bad thing I can say about Red Rooster is that it doesn't have much of an identity yet. I'm not sure it knows if it wants to be this new chic restaurant or a little more homely. I'm sure that will change once the hype dies down. Overall this was a satisfying dining experience.",6,0,2,Donald K.,"Jersey City, NJ",232,99,6
1.0,1/18/2011,"The best thing about this place is the way it looks. everything else is a complete fail. My friends and I went on a Monday night with prior reservations and we still had to wait for a table. It took 25 minutes to get the drinks we ordered, and one of our friends never got her drink. Dinner menu is pretty small, pretty hard to choose from given that its only a few options to pick from. when the food FINALLY arrived it failed all exceptions. Salmon was not pleasant, oxtail gross, lemon chicken was ehh, and mac and cheese never arrived. Sweet potato was good tho. service was extremely slow!!! the decor was nice and that was about it.

It took no time for us to get seated, but it took an hour for our food to come after we ordered, and all the dishes were cold, because they have been sitting on the counter for a while. The staff didn't even show a hint of apology. Are we suppose to pity and understand them for being so disorganized since they only opened up since late Dec?

3.0,1/16/2011,"I'll admit that my damn curiosity is what brought me to Red Rooster. Having heard about Marcus Samuelsson's culinary prowess for some years, I wanted to see for myself whether his new establishment focusing on comfort food would live up to those heightened expectations. We walked into Red Rooster on a Saturday night around 6:30pm knowing full well that we would have to wait it out, since we didn't have reservations. The crowd of enthusiastic patrons sitting at the bar and standing near the entrance confirmed it for me. That, and the hostess warned us that the wait would be well over an hour! The first hour was okay, as we huddled near the impressive curving bar that took up maybe half of the restaurant space. The bar itself appeared to be staffed by helpful bartenders. I later noticed that they all had mohawk-inspired hairstyles, which was incredibly fitting given the restaurant's name!The second hour, however, was a bit more painful, as the hostess continued to be a little vague about how much longer the wait would be. We later learned that some VIPs (maybe critics?) had entered the restaurant, which probably bumped our names further down the list. Having invested nearly two hours into waiting for a table, we decided to stick it out anyway. We met Marcus, as he made his rounds throughout the bar area. He was definitely gracious, warm, and personable. Well, we were finally seated at 8:30pm. We shared a table near the bar/front of the restaurant with another party of 3, which was fine with us. It actually reminded me a little of the way you have to share tables in Chinatown dim sum restaurants, but the similarities end there. We started with some corn bread and spiced duck liver pudding. Now I'm not a fan of butter at all, but my friend claimed that this butter was melt-in-your-mouth good. I tried a little on my piece of corn bread, and I'd have to agree. The duck liver was also very tasty, but I'd imagine not everyone would enjoy it. For entrees, we ordered the baked mac and greens, fried yard bird, and helga's meatballs. We also had sides of collard greens and yams/sweet potato puree. The yard bird came with this shaker of special seasonings that we couldn't quite identify. If I had to choose between the three entrees, I'd go with the meatballs. Our waitress was sweet and made useful suggestions here and there. She sold us on the peanut and chocolate dessert. The centerpiece was this peanut/chocolate candy bar. It came with a scoop of ice cream, a dab of peanut butter, and some slices of bananas. The dessert was a nice way to end the evening.Ultimately though, nothing really blew me away. Given the amount of time we waited, I was hoping to have an outstanding meal. I guess the corn bread was perhaps the best part - I could've had three orders of just that! I do want to give Red Rooster another go though, so perhaps next time I'll make reservations ahead of time to avoid the mind-numbing wait.",2,0,0,Julia Y.,"Manhattan, NY",28,70,25
2.0,1/15/2011,"We live in Harlem just 4 blocks from Red Rooster. No one wants Red Rooster to do well more than us--how else are we going to get our friends to make the trek uptown? We are sad to say that tonight was our third and probably final visit. Each of the three times the wait was beyond reasonable. Can deal with the wait--though not thrilled about the lack of apology or acknowledgment for the wait.The appetizers came--not bad--certainly not delicious....then we waited and waited and waited. No one even came by to offer an explanation.Our wine was very good. Our entrees finally arrived, 3 out of 6 were cold. One was just plain awful. One friend said the meatballs were delicious and one said the chicken (yard bird) was wonderful yet she did not eat much of it ??? One friend could not even eat her shrimp and grits--said it was cold and salty. One side order of cauliflower was yummy but the second plate of it was overly salty and without the balsamic sauce it was supposed be served with. Of four orders of crab cakes--two were good and two not so good---how does that happen? The waitress was lovely though seemed as if she really had her hands full.The handsome blond manager (partner we are told) came by the table. He was less than sympathetic and in fact he was down right impolite. He suggested that his staff was inferior and pretty much told us not to come back if we were unhappy. I am giving two stars instead of one--because I do hope they get their act together, it is a lively space with good energy.  The chef is admired and adored and talented--the neighborhood needs a fantastic place!The handsome blond said that we should not be grading them on three weeks open--but shouldn't they be putting their best foot forward--if not now then when?

4.0,1/14/2011,"I am torn between a 4 and 5 star. The food was excellent, but the service was AMAZING. The restaurant was packed from the moment we arrived for our 7:30 pm reservation until we left around 9:45 pm.The restaurant is location right outside of the 2/3 at 125th St. When you walk into the restaurant there is a large bar area bustling with people. It took approx. 30 minutes total from the Village to arrive via subway. The hostess is just past the bar, and is super friendly. We were sat about 10 minutes after 7:30. We were attended to every step of the way. Never an empty water glass or a need left unattended (not that we had that many needs). Our server was Aaron, and I will request him again next time I go. If you make a reservation request Aaron he was just nice, helpful, and had some great menu suggestions. They have been only open for 3 weeks, but you would have no idea. There didn't seem to be any kinks with the service or food. Chef/Owner Marcus Samuelsson even took time to come out and shake everyone's had and thank them for coming. My mom lives out of state and is a huge fan because of Top Chef. Even though it was embarrassing I asked if I could take a picture with him for my mom. He was so nice and had no problems letting me take a picture with him. Items we had: 2 Lenox Cocktails Served in a Martini Glass - Cocoa- & Vanilla-Infused Bourbon, Tawny Port, Rhubarb, Maraschino - I thought the cocktail was good just a bit strong for me, but my friend LOVED his drink. Corn Bread with Honey Butter, Tomato Jam - YUMMY!! The tomato jam was awesome. Shrimp with Red Grits (Shrimp, Basil, Sausage, Poached Egg) - this is the dish I had, which I enjoyed. It was just the right amount of food not too much and not too little. The shrimp tasted steamed. They were served in the middle around saucy red grits. There was a cheese crust next to the poached egg. Great flavors and not a heavy dish. Fried Yard Bird (White Mace Gravy, Hot Sauce & Shake) - my friend ordered this, which I tried. It was quite tasty. There were 3 pieces of chicken with gravy. The Shake is a mixture of chili powder and Ethiopian spices that is comes on the side in a shaker like salt or pepper. 2 beers (1 Rooster Special and 1 Keegan's Mother's Milk) - the rooster beer is an amber beer that is brewed specially for the restaurant, and mother's milk is like Guinness. 1 warm apple pie with a Soft Cheddar Crust and Vanilla Whip - yummy apple pie with a top and bottom crust served with some whip cream very good. The crust was a bit difficult to cut, but it still tasted good.",2,1,0,Alicia S.,"New York, NY",13,36,17
4.0,1/13/2011,"How wonderful for Harlem to have this beautiful restaurant open on Lenox and 125th St. Sylvia's is just up the block and the historic Lenox Lounge down the street.  A highly anticipated opening, Red Rooster is excellent. The interior decor is lovely -- in the style of a French bistro. You first enter the bar area -- and what a stunning bar. Circular, expansive and comfortably open. You are immediately directed to the host which is a sign of the level of service to come -- attentive and friendly. The dining room is a bit noisy but full of energy. There is an open kitchen -- basically a long counter where the waiters submit orders, pick up food, slice bread -- and on the other side the chefs work their magic. There are a number of tables that run adjacent to this counter -- and for some, this may not be the most desirable seat in the restaurant as it does get noisy. The food is the main attraction.  They start you off with delicious bread and a hummus like spread. The menu offers a nice selection of appetizers including the shrimp and dirty rice which was delicious. For our entrees, I ordered the seared salmon with citrus salad and apple broth. It was delicious -- light, nice mix of textures, and flavorful. My friend ordered Helga's Meatballs served with lingonberry and loved it. I skipped dessert but my friend ordered the fudge with hazelnuts -- and loved it. The restaurant is booked ahead for weeks but they do take walk-ins at 5:30pm for a first seating. I will definitely go back.",1,0,1,Nancy F.,"Manhattan, NY",2,10,0

All the dishes were wonderful, no complaints on anything. The presentation as well as the taste were superb. If I had to choose a favorite, it would be the Red Snapper, it actually impressed me.The cocktail selection was better than wine selection.3. Lastly, parking was easy to find.

4.0,1/11/2011,"This place was hopping on a Monday night. Immediately upon entering we were greeted by an employee who ushered us over to the hostess stand. We were informed the wait would be well over an hour for our party of two but considering how long it took us to get up to Harlem we decided to stick it out. The bar is very large and getting a drink was easy. When two people jumped up from the bar, we were delighted to find out we could just eat at the bar and not have to wait to sit down. We had egg foam martinis (both with spiced rum and the standard house gin). Ask for this with rum! It tastes so much better, compliments to Sway from MTV for ordering this special concoction before us. The cocktails were outstanding.Before I dive into the food I have to compliment Marcus Samuelsson on the awesome job he has done!He was so nice and friendly in the restaurant you would never, ever believe he was an Iron Chef or Top Chef Master. He literally walked around the restaurant all night shaking peoples hands and saying hello and asking if everything was up to par. Seriously!?! Where else do you get service from a celebrity chef like that. Tell me cause I want to know. We ordered the fried chicken, collard greens, cornbread, crab cakes, ceviche tostadas, and some sorbet.The cornbread comes with some sort of marmalade that really hit the spot when combined with a thickly buttered piece of bread. The collard greens were nice but I have to say the ceviche tostadas fell short. The ceviche itself was good albeit small and the tortilla tostada crunch didn't mesh well with me. I would rather have had a larger portion of two different ceviches in a martini glass, etc. But maybe that's just me.The fried chicken was very good. Better than Blue Ribbon good! I really gotta hand it to him, the crispy skin and leg meat were incredible.The best dish of the night was hands down the crab cakes. I knew this right away when I noticed my girlfriend was not talking and instead just inhaling the crab cakes. They were outstanding. The spicy sauce, lightly fried crab combo really did it and the portion was very generous for an appetizer.The crowd at this restaurant was out of control. I have never seen so many celebrity sightings and avant-garde homogenizing going on in one restaurant ever , no less in Harlem! Samuelsson really has something special going here. All in all this was a great meal and will 100% be coming out of my way to come back here.The bill for 3 drinks and all the food above was right under $100.00 with tip.",1,0,0,Matt M.,"New York, NY",29,186,4

I have never encountered a more pleasant...pleasing....& genuinely kind staff at an establishment - more than I have experienced here at Red Rooster. - And 5 stars for being able to meet Chef Samuelsson- as he greeted each table and it was an ABSOLUTE treat...as I've admired him for over 15 years. For the main attraction - the food - is where my review falls a little short....My fellow diners are a tough crowd (Veteran females chefs and restaurant owner)...At the end of the evening - their responses were ""Pleasant service but sluggish"". ( our mains took over 30 minutes).......""flat flavours""...""under seasoned""...""exceptional cocktails"".... Enjoyed by all were - Oysters, Crabcakes, Nuts with Sour Cherries/Injera, Cornbread, Fried Yard Bird, Hearth Baked Mac & Green, Oxtail, Grilled Snapper - Desserts - Sweet Potato Doughnuts, Black/White Mud & Coconut Flan .... - I found the crabcake to be lightly seasoned....but enjoyable.....The cornbread was delicious - so good.....we had 2 orders....the tomato jam is really delicate and the sweet cream butter is delightful......My friend was disappointed with her oysters - said they were tasteless.... The nuts/cherries were indeed spicy..warm...and we did enjoy!!......My snapper was delicious - as the sour tomato broth and barley pearls were very light....actually too light in my opinion....I thoroughly enjoyed my main - and everyone agreed that it was the best main on the table.... Oxtail was bland for my friend....I tasted the broth from her dish - and it was lacking punch....and quite simply...Salt...a little bit would have brought it up.....although her meat was very tender... For the Yard bird.....again...tender...but lacking flavour - even with the accompanied shaker of seasonings.... would she order it again? not sure...... For the Hearth Baked Mac & Green.... I found it to be delcious....for its simplicity.....I caught some subtle notes of cinnamon/nutmeg in there....but again....lacking in flavour for the others... However, they did find the carrot/greens paired with the pasta to be well seasoned and delicious.... Our servers assured us that we had made very fine selections...to really get a feel of the menu...but at the end....nothing wowed us...nothing grabbed us ....nothing truly sparked us to say ""hmm.....I need to come back for this!""...... Although I will say that the Sweet Potato Doughnuts were divine.....and my cocktail - the ""Gin n Juice""....was amazing......strong, citrusy and bright!... Coming from Brooklyn up to Harlem with high expectations....only to be let down with flat flavours is not what we expected - BUT we made sure to pass our thoughts on to the comment cards - as the staff mentioned Chef Samuelsson reads each one personally....

5.0,1/10/2011,"The wait was worth it.  The 125th street 2/3 Subway stop in Harlem now has a good restaurant *not* operated by a pretentious idiot (see my review of Chez Lucienne, which, for now, still hangs-on next door to Red Rooster).  Fear not, downtowners, you can come back to Harlem and eat without being insulted.The first thing that struck me as I walked in this place for Sunday brunch was that every beautiful woman in Harlem must have wanted a table when I did.  This place reeks of money, both in decor and clientele, but lacks the pretense which usually accompanies such an investment, to the credit of those responsible.  It is thoughtfully designed, the food is outstanding, and the service top tier.  Marcus was at the door when I arrived, and the General Manager introduced himself before I left.  If this place is not a huge success, that will be because of something I didn't encounter on this visit.Having worked in the restaurant business for many years, and having been heavily involved in the opening of  three restaurants during my career, I know what a task it is to get that done.  For that reason, I generally don't visit new restaurants, particularly not those with as much buzz as this one generated.  Why?  Generally things are effed-up, many mistakes are frequently made, things are poorly-planned and it can really ruin you on a place that may end up being pretty good once they get their sea-legs.Bravo, Red Rooster.  You're getting it right.My companion order the steak and eggs, I had the shrimp and grits.  The food is Southern Soul Nouveau, if there is such a category (there is now), and the genius of Mr. Samuelson is brightly evident.  The cornbread app was served with a tomato chutney that I now have to re-create for myself at home.  I could have made a meal of that dish alone.  My companion's steak was expertly prepared rare, as she wanted it (a rare enough occasion alone--a rare steak actually served rare), the shrimp with my red grits were *not* overdone (another frequent error) and the presentation was beautiful.The bar serves a number of delicious cocktails designed around infused bourbon, we sampled The Lenox, The Big Red Rooster (they must have been tempted to call that The Big Red Cock, but wisely demured), and The Brownstone.  One of those was comp'ed because it came a few minutes late, also the sign of a business dedicated to the customer's experience.I will be back, frequently.",2,0,1,Richard D.,"New York, NY",55,55,0
5.0,1/9/2011,"Red Rooster of Harlem NYC is PHENOMENAL! I had dinner there tonight and I will definitely be going back.  After walking in and being greeted by the hostess she promptly took our coats. My dinner reservation was at 6:30 and I was seated immediately. Our waitress (Onika) was helpful and took our drink orders without delay. I had the signature drink of Red Rooster the- The Big Red Rooster which is a cinnamon infused bourbon, doulin rouge, averna amaro and orange bitters. Whoa! It was a fabulous and strong drink served in a martini glass.I ordered as an appetizer the red caesar salad made with Bottarga, smoked vinaigrette with shavings of parmesan cheese. My husband ordered the crab cakes which were AMAZING! My main entree was the shrimp and red grits and I LOVED IT! I don't eat sausage and Onika (waitress) was able to ensure there was no sausage added to the dish since I don't eat it. My husband ordered the Fried Yard Bird which is fried chicken with a special twist to it. Can I say DELICIOUS? You may want to order one of the side dishes to go along with this entree.Halfway through dinner guess who came out to greet the patrons? none other than Chef Marcus Samuelsson!!!! I almost choked on my shrimp. He shook hands with everyone in the restaurant and showered us with his million dollar smile.For dessert I ordered the sweet potato donuts. The mini donuts are coated with cinnamon sugar and have a light sweet potato filling. The donuts were served with fresh whipped cream (with vanilla bean) and lemon sorbet (delish).The kitchen is open with full access for diners to see Marcus and his staff work wonders.  The entire waitstaff was amazing.

3.0,1/9/2011,"The anticipated grand opening of Marcus Samuelsson's new Harlem eatery, Red Rooster, is officially open and has delivered in more ways than one. After close to being three months of a delayed opening, Red Rooster which is located on 310 Lenox Ave in Harlem, NYC, lived to surpass my expectations. Before leaving my pad I went online to see if anyone else on the foodie web was going to dine at the restaurant tonight as well. Then it came to my attention on Eater.com that Red Rooster and chef Samuelsson were getting bashed on by guests leaving comments on the opening night. Someone even said ""He won't be in the restaurant unless there's a photo shoot. THis place will bomb, just like almost everything else he says he's going o do. What a hack, what a poseur."" Haha, well guess what Guest #9? Marcus Samuelsson was in the hizouse, and cooking, and visiting tables, and even had time to take a picture with yours truly. =) So, get this...I arrive to the restaurant around 5:30pm and the bar is practically full. As soon as me and my friend walk in we were greeted by none other than Marcus himself. I must say that the hostesses were very kind and helpful. Our coats were checked in then we grabbed a couple of seats at the bar, ordered a couple of drinks, and just absorbed the ambiance and decor. I have to give it to them on the design! The entire restaurant has is filled with style and vibrant colors. The bar is the shape of an ""8"" and copper topped. The display shelf behind it is filled with levels of classic antique statues, liquor bottles, plants, jars, and copper wares. My eye even caught an old-school film camera sitting on one of the top shelves (neat!). The beverage list is short and sweet. We indulged ourselves with orders of their fig & pear infused bourbon concoctions. A few minutes passed by and then we were kindly guided to our seats in the dining room. Right away I was are struck with the cool black & white wallpaper design they have on the wall facing the open kitchen. The ceiling lights, along with decorative items around the walls and by the pantry door way area, were of a shiny copper finish. The window size of the open kitchen is great. You can see all the cooks preparing your meal and even a cool open flame grill sat in the middle of the kitchen that gave the dining room audience more added eye candy. Our server was super kind and pleasant and set the mood nicely (Rocking pastel orange & blue bistro aprons btw!). We ordered snacks, apps, salad, sides, entrees, dessert, oh my! The Beef Patty with Salsa Verde was tasty. You get two pieces of mini puff pastry and ground meat inside which was nicely seasoned. The Salsa Verde gave it a nice acidic kick to it and complimented it well. The Yellow Corn Fish Tacos that came with Yellowtail Tuna marinated with lime (ceviche style) and avocado had a refreshing taste and crisp crunch to it, but could have used a better presentation. The Gravlax with Purple Mustard was awesome! Cured correctly, presented nicely, and the purple mustard was -ugh!- wonderFUL. The Red Caesar salad with grated Bottarga and smoked vinaigrette was executed great. It was not overly dressed like most Caesar are; this one had an awesome flavor profile. The Fried Yard Bird that came with white mace gravy, hot sauce, and collard greens was delicioso! My friend actually couldn't do the knife and fork thing anymore, so he just grabbed his piece of the bird with his bare hands and started tearing it up! (That's how a true bird is eaten!) My 10 oz Prime NY Strip steak cooked to medium was, well, cooked perfectly. The truffled frites were over salted. The mouth-sized pieces of pickled seasonal vegetables were out of this world. And I'm not exaggerating. When you come here and get to the desserts, please try the Black & White Mud with Wafer Crust...you'll thank me later. I might be sounding like I just ate a three Michelin star place, but the bare truth is ... that I didn't have to. Nonetheless, tonight was an awesome experience. Reason being? Maybe it's the fact that I sat next to great people who love food and got to talk to them or maybe it was our server who was pleasant throughout our dinner. Maybe it was the kitchen staff doing a great job and our food arriving on time or just maybe it was shaking hands with one of the owners and exchanging a few words with him. Regardless of all the hype, rumors of chef Samuelsson not showing up, delayed openings, etc, etc...my expectations of this new Harlem eatery was well surpassed. Harlem needs more places like Red Rooster, or maybe Red Rooster needs more places like Harlem. Either way, you can't go wrong if you want to celebrate the roots of American cuisine.

I had a bourbon infused fig and pear martini.  If you are a ceviche lover you will want to choose the corn tacos for starters.I recommend the Shrimp and Grits for an entree.  I am not a beef or pork eater and I was very happy the kitchen could accommodate my dish without chorizo sausage.  My dessert choice was was a pear and cheese plate served with red wine ice cream and clogg.  My plans are to try out Red Roosters brunch next.,0,0,0,Khadijah H.,"New York, NY",136,10,2
4.0,1/5/2011,"I went with a small group on New Years Eve and we had a great experience. We sat at the curving bar and tried several phenomenal cocktails. The Apollo ( I won't look at ginger the same way!) and Gin and Juice (not your average gin and juice) were our favorites. The staff is very attentive and the bartender clearly cared about what he was producing. The plan was to just drink but the rooster is an experience for the senses. I found myself looking the food as it went to my fellow compatriots at the bar. The aromas were fantastic and I couldn't resist hitting the bar menu. Marcus being in the house and coming out to greet us didn't hurt either. I ordered the mac and cheese which was great but could have used a bit more salt. My friend ordered the chicken  appetizer which was out of this world. I will be back very soon and I can't wait to try their main menu. Yes, you go for the food but once your there its the energy that makes it work. Great ideas and talented people.",0,0,0,Amy T.,"New York, NY",4,16,0

4.0,1/3/2011,"I have to say I was very excited about going to Red Rooster as I have been waiting for it to open for quite some time.  I went to the early seating on New Years Eve.  The restaurant is quite attractive particularly for a Harlem venture.  The only drawback I saw was there wasn't alot of seating for two, mostly four tops.  I had the salmon and my dinner guest had the steak-frites.  We both really enjoyed the food.  My salmon was a delicious blend of the fish, mashed parsnips (which I luv) and apples.  The flavors blended together beautifully.  We both had dessert, I had the pudding which was phenomenal and my guest had the apple pie which for some reason they kept pushing at all the tables close to us, but it wasn't so good.  The food runner that brought out the apple pie stated that next time we should order it with ice cream, a la mode.  Why didn't our waiter suggest it then?On to the personnel.  There were in fact a lot of people working that evening and most of them were extremely nice and personable.  The first gentlemen we enccountered at our table poured water into our glasses and spilled water on the table.  Didn't say sorry or attempt to wipe it up even after I pointed it out to him.  Mr. Sammuelson came by and shook everyone's hands and thanked them for coming out, nice touch.  Although most of the people working were very nice we had possibly the worst waiter I've had in a long time.  Not sure how he got the job.  He was so inattentive.  The others made up for him but when I go again ( and I will) if I'm seated in his section I will probably ask to be moved. Good luck to Red Rooster and Mr Sammuelson I hope you're around for a long time and welcome to the neigborhood.",1,0,1,Patrick M.,"New York, NY",3,23,1
3.0,1/3/2011,"This place earned a 3.5 stars in my opinion, but yelp can't accomodate that yet.Stopped by here because of its famous chef and was nicely surprised.Lots of BBPs and definitely a lot of waitstaff. The main issue I had with this place was that the staff seemed butter-fingered; our seating was delayed because a waiter broke a wine goblet right at the place we were supposed to be seated... Maitre D was nice about it thought and apologized..Less than 30 mins later, another waitperson broke a plate.. again beside our table.... made us consider moving in case something flew out of the kitchen given our close proximity to it.On a positive note, our waitress was super nice and accomodating thought the kitchen was almost closed.We ordered an assortment of dishes:Fried yard bird - excellent fried chicken! crispy on the outside, very juicy on the insideCrab cakes - tasty, tasty, yum!Oysters - wish they served some lemon / hot sauce with thisBeef patties - tiny scrumptious bites of flaky pastry and delicious fillingDirty rice & Shrimp - most disappointing of them all.. the shrimp was great but the rice tasted like wood shavings or something... tasteless yet overpowering at the same time.Drinks were strong ( heavy on the alcohol) but fair.Decent experience overall and great ambience.",1,0,0,Teju A.,"Mountain View, CA",35,142,2
3.0,1/2/2011,"**BRUNCH REVIEW** I really wanted Red Rooster to be a 5-starer...really, really, really wanted it to be because of Marcus Samuelson and it's in Harlem, my new neighborhood. However, it was three stars at best. I was here for brunch with three friends on New Year's Day without a reservation at noon. The staff was great, took our coats and sat us down at a table promptly. The restaurant itself is beautiful- open kitchen and I'd say it sits about 70-90 people. There is large bar area were I believe you can order food. There is also a downstairs area but it is not open as of yet. I agree with Steven S. the restaurant does have a folksy feel and Marcus, the owner and chef, was there greeting everyone and shaking hands. The managers were also fussing about checking on tables. After awhile, I was a little annoyed with the fussing because they just kept walking about with no purpose...but I got over it. Also, there was a random woman singing in the main dining area WHICH was a bit out of place since the the restaurant is going for a more classier feel. a little weird but okay. I passed on the $13 mimosa but our table ordered the Breakfast Basket, which was an assortment of muffins and pastries. Pretty good and there was enough to share among the four of us. For the main dish, I ordered the Nuggets and Toast which is fried chicken nuggets over french toast. The chicken was over cooked and dry and because the nuggets were on top of the toast vs. on the side, the mixture of the salt on the chicken and the syrup that they put on the toast was not the best mix of flavors. I would not order this plate again. On a brighter note, my friend had the steak and it was cooked well and flavorful! No worries Red Rooster, I will be back but for dinner this time and hopefully I can give you the 5 stars that I wanted to.",3,0,0,Tarra T.,"Chicago, IL",99,236,166
3.0,1/1/2011,"Fun and energetic atmosphere, though perhaps a tad too noisy for anyone who enjoys a close conversation over dinner. Red Rooster definitely boasts a staff thoroughly-experienced in providing quality service...shaking hands with the chef was also a nice touch. Sadly, I must confess I found the food a little overpowering for my liking. Delicious the first few bites, weighty and over-saturated for the remainder. From the collard greens and corn bread to the main dishes of lobster-shrimp grits and fried yard bird, my dinner reminded me of a sort of culinary blitzkrieg: initially, it feels as though your tastebuds are getting punched in the face, but in the end all that's left is an odd sensation of unsophisticated heaviness on the palate as well as the stomach. I'm not even criticizing the inherent greasy nature of Red Rooster's comfort-food inspired menu, and had an idea of what to expect in that regard. Rather than collectively presenting itself as one seamless dining experience comprised of complimentary ingredients and seasonings, all the flavors encountered in each dish seemed to be in coarse competition with each other. My boyfriend and I wondered if this was simply an artifact of Chef Samuelsson's Top Chef days, in which you only had a one-bite opportunity to wow someone. Regardless, I can't support the hype despite how genuinely I was hoping to. Still a lovely restaurant, but not a five-star.",0,0,0,Anna Y.,"New York, NY",21,47,18
4.0,1/1/2011,"Popped in for a cocktail early on NYE and the place was hoppin! I have to say, the cocktails were fan-ta-bu-lous! I LOVED the ""Apollo"" with sage and yummy ginger, perfectly balanced and frothy with egg white. Then the ""Gin and Juice"" with orange MARMALADE??? ... these cocktails not only took me on a tantalizing tasty ride of deliciousness, but also took me down musical memory lane... watching my cute mohawk-sporting bartender work was not only entertaining as he lit orange zest on fire and shook and stirred himself into a tizzy, but educational as well! I loved the vibe in this new ROOST in Harlem... I will be back not only for the cocktails, but also for the Chix and Dix app... delicious chicken nuggets if I have to call them that, but amazingly seasoned and spicy with a calming yogurt dipping sauce. Not so spectacular was the Mac and Greens... the Mac lacked seasoning and cheesiness and the greens were more like a cold garnish which should not have been served in what appeared to be an iron skillet. We were expecting something HOT and got cold dry leafy stuff with pickled onion... not so palatable. I will say, however, that the Mac went really well when swabbed together on my fork with a hunk of CHIX! Way to go Marcus, and welcome to Harlem!",0,0,0,Amy C.,"Manhattan, NY",70,2,0
2.0,12/30/2010,"So.... I'm shocked at the reviews prior to mine. I can only guess that the reviewers don't have very much experience with authentic soul food? I went yesterday and we had they oysters, crab cakes, yard bird and oxtails. The best thing were the raw oysters. The food in general was bland and disappointing. The crab cakes did not taste like they were made from fresh crab, they were dry and missing that sweetness that fresh crab has. The best thing about the dish was the sauce. The yard bird had perfect crunch but was lacking in flavor. The oxtail dish smelled delicious but had no flavor. The oxtails were sort of tough and flavorless and the sauce, what little there was, did not have that rich depth you expect. This was worsened by the fact that the dish came with 2 oxtails and 1 sliver of plantain for $26 (oxtail is a cheap meat!). The ambiance of the place is great, but currently it is better for drinks than food. Chez Lucienne next door has (much) better food. You can get better soul food...almost everywhere in Harlem and even the chain Manna's has better oxtails. I was and still am excited about Samuelsson's new venture and I hope the quality of the food improves. It can begin by introducing chef Bergquist to salt.",0,0,0,ife s.,"Manhattan, NY",5,23,2

4.0,12/25/2010,"Hype or no hype, I've been waiting for Red Rooster to open for months, which is a first for me for any restaurant above 14th Street, as they say, and I live above 170th, so I'm not one of ""they"" and this opening is therefore doubly-pleasant.And it's great!Exuberant, attentive staff (friendly and helpful but not overbearing, totally approachable and professional), eclectic food (think Ethiopian/Scandinavian/Soul Fusion), and a bright, gorgeous, sort of haute folksy space. A little bit of a downtown ambiance in an uptown space, though the huge front windows are a friendly and unexpected touch for both this neighborhood and this city.My father, partner, and I went in for a late afternoon Christmas dinner. Two of us waited for the third at the curvy, swooping, copper bar which has wines on tap, expensive house cocktails, numerous beer selections, and a separate menu if you want to munch on fried chicken nuggets. It was amusing to watch the well coiffed manager manage all the little details. He clearly runs a tight ship.Once seated, we were offered but declined a $75 fixed menu. No problem with it, just wasn't interested in the options, but such a thing may be a common occurrence on special occasions. Instead, we ordered the fried chicken, the salmon, and the red snapper with collard greens and yams on the side. My father, who almost never likes anything, thought the fried chicken was great. My partner and I concurred that the salmon, too, was excellent, and I myself don't normally like cooked salmon, but the way they serve it here is fresh, slightly tangy, and not at all fishy. My red snapper was fine, too, especially the spicy tomato broth base it sat in--very unique--which I wish had been more thoroughly infused into the fish itself. The collard greens were powerful stuff that we couldn't finish. The yams/sweet potatoes were divine and near perfect.I am tempted to revise up to 5 stars and may very well do that on a repeat visit in the near future. They are clearly serious about quality at this place (delaying the opening several months says as much), so it's worth keeping an eye on. Given its location, I'll definitely be back soon. Might even come here regularly to drink, it's so convenient.On a personal note, the highlight of the evening was when Marcus himself came out to ask how we were doing and thank us for coming. He was even happy (I daresay delighted) to pose with us for a photo. And the highlight wasn't just that he did that, but that my father recognized him from the Food Network and was himself delighted by the experience.

From the opening chickpea puree served with the bread, all the way through to the sweet potato donut dessert (sounds odd, but fantastic), practically every item on the menu is something you've never tasted like this before but will want to return for. The Fried Yard Bird - especially with the shake-it-on-yourself spices - is crave-inducing. Interesting cocktails, too - the Brownstoner is a nice nutmeg-infused bourbon twist on the Manhattan.
