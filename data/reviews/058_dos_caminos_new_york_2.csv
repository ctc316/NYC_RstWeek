2.0,4/20/2019,"I've been here a handful of times and it seems to get worse with each visit. I will say the brunch is great - I had the French toast and it was delicious. Their guac is good as well. However, the service can be slow & it is hard to get your waiters attention. Most recently my meal had a random piece of chicken in it which was offputting since I am a vegetarian. Please PLEASE do something about the bathrooms - they are always in a horrible state - dirty, unflushed toilets, and one time there wasn't a single piece of toilet paper in any stall. You really lose your appetite after seeing the state of the bathroom. I also find this place to be overpriced - there are better Mexican spots in the city.",0,0,0,Devon K.,"New York, NY",5,9,0
2.0,4/19/2019,"REALLY POOR EXPERIENCE.I went to this dos caminos and was told that it is a great place with amazing food. But the experience was poor and disappointed big time.I don't know where to start. Our server was really amicable and sweet but this place was clearly understaffed as the food took ages to come!We called for 3 coronas and saw them at the bar, kept outside and waiting for someone to bring them to us...FOR 20 MINUTES. The coronas became warm. Even the food came unbelievably slowly and all the tables around us were waiting for their food. The guacamole is good but definitely overpriced, as the case with the rest of the food.I called for the chicken quesadilla and honestly it was pretty good, and the reason why I give this place 2 stars instead of 1. I came with my sister and girlfriend, both of whom are vegetarians. My girlfriend's dish had a piece of chicken in it, which ruined her meal completely. MANY customers are really finicky (and fairly so) about what they eat, so to find a piece of chicken in a vegetarian dish is REALLY putting off. Thankfully my girlfriend is from USA and vegetarianism is a choice for her, but if it's out of religion then I know many a customer who would create a racket and potentially sue the restaurant.They did give us free churros to compensate for the mistake. And the churros were AMAZING (another reason for a 2 star rating instead of 1).However another off putting experience was the cleanliness (or lack of) of their bathrooms. Urinals were unflushed and flooded and my girlfriend told me unflattering tales of the female bathroom too. A really really off putting experience, especially when you plan to resume your meal after using the bathroom.Unfortunately I don't think the staff is to blame completely (other than the horrific chicken experience) but management must take action.",1,1,0,Mrinal T.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",106,13,0

Food wasn't bad, tbh, but service so slow and basement is so dingy. Worst of all, as we were leaving a mouse ran across the restaurant floor.

3.0,4/2/2019,Good guacamole and chips. I ordered the chicken quesadilla and couldn't finish it. It was average. Everything was super expensive. Fits a huge group (I came with a party of 20+). Each person ended up paying around $50 though,0,0,0,Emily C.,"Great Neck, NY",282,13,0
1.0,3/30/2019,"This place has gone downhill big time with slimy, unprofessional staff and impossibly slow service. I used to come to one of the locations a few times a year, and even took a cooking class at the Park Ave. location once, but this last visit was a disaster. I've read several reviews mentioning an active mouse problem to boot. So my advice would be to stay away from the Third Ave. location!I arrived at 6 p.m. on a Friday night and was told there was a 40-minute wait for a table. It seemed strange because there were definitely tables open on the top level. I asked if I could eat at the bar and they told me there were some bar seats open downstairs.When I walked into the lower level it was very loud at the bar and quiet elsewhere...because about 60% of the tables were empty. I sat at the bar and ordered my dinner right away along with my drink because I was hoping to eat quickly before catching a show across town. I asked for a margarita and cheese enchiladas. I told the bartender I can't eat the rice and beans, but I wondered if I could substitute a bowl of the street corn. He said he needed to check with the manager because there may be a $2 or $3 upcharge. I said OK, that's fine, but if it's more let me know.Enchiladas came out 15 minutes later, but when I cut into them it was clear they were chicken. I told the bartender and he said he would fix it. The corn came a few minutes later...except it was a tiny piece of corn on the cob, not the bowl I had asked for. I figured this was why the upcharge was only $2 or $3 instead of the bowl and being hungry with no enchiladas in sight, I went ahead and ate it. After finishing the corn and hanging out for another 10 minutes, I asked the bartender if the enchiladas would be out soon and he said yes, he marked it as a ""rush order."" Well, another 20 minutes passed and no food and now I was in a time crunch. Since the bartender was doing a whole lot of nothing, never checking in with the kitchen on my meal, I asked to speak with a manager. I told the manager that this was a bad overall experience starting with seeing all of these tables being vacant for 40 minutes at this point. He said they were for ""reservations."" Well any good manager knows the optics of telling people there are no tables available while they stay empty for almost an hour (and by the time I left after an hour, only one party was seated) is insulting to anyone's intelligence and illustrates poor management. You should flip the tables over to waiting parties after no-shows don't arrive within 10-15 minutes. Manager 101. The one good thing he did was go retrieve a dish of cheese enchiladas from the kitchen. Now why didn't anyone else do that 20 minutes earlier?I had to shovel my food in my face and ask for the bill now that it took 45 minutes to get my food. Imagine my surprise to see on the bill that the bartender was indeed the one who entered my order incorrectly to start with and then charged me $8 for the corn. I asked him why he didn't tell me it was more than the $2 or $3 he quoted me? He said he thought he did. Effing liar--I told him I couldn't believe he didn't comp a single thing on my bill after screwing up my order, making me wait 45 minutes for my food and then charging me $8 for a tiny piece of corn.  No remorse. It would be nice if someone in this restaurant took some ownership and responsibility. I'll never return and will be sure to let people know about the mouse infestation, wish I had known sooner.",0,0,0,Chris A.,"Nanuet, NY",0,5,0
1.0,3/30/2019,"Honestly, one of the worst restaurant experiences I've had.Once we sat down, our waiter politely came over and asked my table if we wanted chips and guac. Sure, sounds great! A lot of Mexican and Spanish restaurants give chips as a starter. That is, until you're charged $16 for it. You don't offer something to someone and then charge them without telling them it's actually an appetizer and not just something they give to every table. That just leaves a horrible impression.Then there was the actual meal. $23 for the surf & turf steak and shrimp tacos, three of them that are literally the length of my index finger. I barely got through one of them because the shrimp was so disgustingly rubbery. Overall, a waste of money.Surf and Turf Tacos (0/5)",0,0,0,Krysi S.,"Staten Island, NY",28,34,58
1.0,3/29/2019,"What a disappointment! I had originally sent what I wrote below as a private message, but received no reply from the restaurant. I feel duty bound to let other diners know of my experience. I was a huge fan of brunch at Dos Caminos. Especially the chilaquiles. This past Sunday I ordered the chilaquiles and when they came out the eggs were overcooked. It took over ten minutes to flag down my waitress and I let her know of the situation. I wait another fifteen minutes, flag her down again and ask where my eggs are. She said someone was supposed to have brought them out. A server comes out a couple minutes later and this time the eggs are nearly hard-boiled. I flag her down again and finally, the eggs come out as they should have. I had to wait nearly an hour for my food and was not offered any compensation for my clearly disappointing experience. Also, I saw a mouse crawl up the window well as I was leaving.",0,0,0,Adrienne S.,"New York, NY",5,27,0
4.0,3/26/2019,"The question I always have about Dos Caminos is if the experience lives up to the name.  I hear about Dos Caminos as a cool trendy place to hang out but wasn't sure if the dining experience was all novelty. I came for a business lunch with some colleagues on a weekday. We walked right in and were seated in the back corner area of the restaurant. It is a spacious restaurant with a long bar. We weren't drinking but it looks like a cool place to get a drink.The lunch menu had all the heavy hitters.  We had to start with guacamole but it comes already done so not sure how fresh it is but it tasted good. The three salsa's that came when the guacamole came out were also pretty delicious. I don't know if it was part of the meal or part of the guacamole appetizer. The salsa I loved the most was the mild one. Great flavor. For lunch, I went with the chile rellenos. I really enjoyed it. There isn't a ton of heat to it but the flavors work. There is a lot going on with the dish but the combination of chile to filling worked. It is a hearty dish so don't come expecting to watch your calories but they were well worth it.  My friend orderd the burger well done but it was still pink. I know chefs hate when people order meat well done but the customer is always right!In the end Dos Caminos lived up its name. It was not just a novelty but a place you can get some good food. I don't know how authentic the food is but who cares it is still good. Will definitely be back.",23,8,21,Nicholas G.,"Hoboken, NJ",4369,1076,2695
1.0,3/24/2019,"This resturant sucks. First they take over 15 mins to bring our group drinks and I ordered water. Then the food takes over 30 minutes for simple dishes and to make things worse we told the restaurant in advance that we wanted separate checks for each individual in our group and management stated on the phone that would not be an issue. Why when the bill comes they make things worse and argue that the check has to be on the same bill and we go back and forth with the manager at the night (bald guy with glasses) he stated that ""its too much work to separate everyone's orders"" what kind of resturant states its too much work. -_- then don't take big groups or agree to what the customer wants. The food wasn't even worth the price point. Half the people complained about under cooked food and its true for some of the dishes to give you small portions those prices are definitely not worth it and i would highly recommend people avoid this place.the wait staff kept avoiding our table and was rude, didn't want to bring us utensils and we had to keep bothering the hostess. Even with the bill we told the waitress how much to charge each card and my card was still charged more than it was supposed to. Never again will I come here, sub par food, too high of a price point, rude wait staff, crap management. And they still get things wrong the whole night with long wait times. I wish there was a no star option -_- there is much better Mexican food in other places throughout nyc and it being worth it.

1.0,3/22/2019,"Met a friend at the bar on a Tuesday after work (3/19). I should've suspected something when I asked a couple if they were leaving, so I could take the seats and got a very terse ""Yes!"" We waited at least 15 minutes to be asked if we wanted a drink, never asked if we wanted a second round (we were there almost 2 hours), waited at least 30 minutes for (cold) tacos and guac (when I mentioned they forgot the quac, it was brought out a few minutes later and chips tossed at us) and never offered a glass of water. A bartender came by and told us they were very backed up, out of this, out of that...for 2 straight hours? Why wasn't management made aware of this? Other patrons on our end of the bar got the same treatment, but said they were still leaving a 20% tip when I asked them.

2.0,3/16/2019,"Came here for a quick drink while waiting on a friend, before heading out for the night. At the bar, I ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio wine.  Ambience was chill and the bartender was nice. However, unfortunately the bartender gave me the wrong wine (Sav Blanc). When I pointed it out, she tried to insist that I ordered the Sav Blanc, and stated that they were out of the Pinot Grigio either way. To me  A.) I'm definitely aware that I ordered a Pinot Grigio (as I am not a fan of Sav Blanc), and  B.) if you were supposedly out of the drink I ordered, wouldn't you tell the patron before deciding to pour an entirely different drink for them? It could've been her honest mistake, but to play it off as if the patron was wrong was a bit off putting for me. The difference in price in minimal, but it's the principle of the matter.

2.0,3/7/2019,"Where to begin with this place... Came here for lunch with a party of 10 around noon and was promptly seated. First of all, they already gave off a bad impression when they charge $28(!!!) for a ""large"" guacamole app, which the waiter admitted only is made from 2 avocados. Highway robbery. My colleagues insisted on getting this and as expected, didn't meet expectations. Two people also ordered Cokes, which were soooo flat that you would think it came from a 2 liter bottle opened 2 years ago. 1 hour later, our food eventually came out. There weren't even that many people in the restaurant so who knows why it took so long. Food was average to below average. My fish tacos were decent, but not fried enough and luke warm. The accompanying rice and beans were astonishingly flavorless. Overpriced Tex Mex food is one of my least favorite things on the planet (the ingredients could not be cheaper), but bad tasting overpriced Tex Mex is even worse. After taking about 1.5hrs for a below average lunch that cost ~$30pp, I HIGHLY suggest spending your time and money elsewhere",1,1,0,Ricky Z.,"New York, NY",230,186,94
4.0,3/6/2019,"Delicious food always. Been here many times to pick up lunch to go (Meal Pal) but I've also dined in as well. Service is always with a smile by the staff and they always pause to greet or acknowledge you. The menu has plenty of variety even for the vegetarian. The drinks and happy hour specials is a big draw in this Midtown East location. On the corner of 50th and Third, you can't miss it.Cut to the chase, must try dishes:- Baja Fish Tacos, generous portions of fish and the slaw is tangy but sweet. Doesn't over power the fish at all. - Enchiladas Verde, chicken enchiladas with meat so tender and juicy you'd think it was a fresh chicken back there. Sauce is incredibly delicious and the queso tastes as good as it smells.- Tacquitos, crisp rolls and deep fried...great for a small snack or appetizer. I just wished it was bigger.- Taco salad with beef is a favorite in my office. Good balance of meat and ingredients. It is a generous portion. The ambiance is lively and fun.  Decor gives good vibes along with the music. Drinks don't disappoint either. Very good Happy Hour crowd. Note: if you see a line out the door at lunchtime, it's either Baja Fish Taco day or the normal Meal Pal peeps.

1.0,2/3/2019,"I could give this place 0 stars if possible...FIRST, it started off with our waiter who was so impatient to take our orders, even though the place was empty! This was 1pm on a Saturday and we came for brunch as a last resort since all other places had long waiting times. Perhaps this should've been our first warning. I ordered the salmon and avocado eggs benedict, which came with a choice of drink/cocktail. The waiter tried to hurry off before I could even order the drink that came with my entree. I had to nearly run after him to let him know I would like the bloody mary. BIG MISTAKE. The bloody mary tasted like 1/3 shrimp cocktail sauce and 2/3 tabasco sauce. It literally burned my throat and stomach when I drank it. It also came with a lemon, no celery or olive garnish. I tried to be accommodating and asked if I could have a glass of tomato juice to water the offensive drink down. BIG SURPRISE. They did not HAVE tomato juice. The MAIN ingredient in a bloody mary!!! So what was the drink made of? Suddenly it made sense why it tasted the way it did. The waiter bashfully explained it came from a pre-made mix....so basically ""just add water!"" bloody mary. Not what I expected. Then, the waiter brought out my other two friends' meals. They looked fine, good even, and happily started eating. I didn't mind, I thought my food would arrive shortly. ANOTHER BIG SURPRISE. My food did not come for another 45 minutes. I kid you not, 45 minutes. The waiter felt very badly and kept apologizing because even he realized it was absurd. My friends finished their meals and another fifteen minutes passed before my food arrived. THE FOOD was thrown on the largest plate I've ever seen. Please see attached photo. It looked like no one even knew they offered this meal. Horrible presentation. But whatever. I just ate it and thought I would put the experience behind me. The food was mediocre but wasn't disgusting or anything. My two friends did relatively enjoy their meals. BUT ALAS, four hours later while I was doing some shopping, I regretfully had to reenact the scene from Bridesmaids. The only other person in this tale who is more of a victim and suffered more than me on this Saturday afternoon, was the person who had to clean up the public restroom I used. I will never forgive what they did to me. But the only way they could try and rectify this situation is by comping my meal and paying one month's salary of the person who cleaned said bathroom.

The deal is really good. 2 hours from 11:30-4pm. $18 ADDITIONAL for bottomless booze and with the amount of mimosas and screwdrivers you drink it's definitely worth it.

To start, the chips that came with the guacamole was half done, so they weren't crunchy. The tacos were bland and the bottoms fell out. The chicken in the empanadas was either over cooked or leftovers from earlier meals.

Ambience is cool, low key,with a very chic undertone to the vibe. Food is delish- drinks on point. I ordered a margarita in the rocks- at this location I requested a little sweetener because it was a little more sour than I like.

4.0,12/31/2018,I made a reservation here for a holiday brunch with my friends. The brunch special is pretty good- 18$ bottomless drinks with the purchase of an entree. We had a table downstairs and it slowly filled up. We started with the guac and it was fabulous! The servers were pretty busy so the drinks came slower at first but our waitress hooked us up with a bottle of Cava & pitcher of mimosas so we were set! For lunch I had the grilled fish tacos. They were pretty good- I like my fish a little more blackened but overall the quality of the food was good and the portions were pretty good sized as well. I would definitely recommend!

It took dinner over an hour to arrive as it arrived at 8:40pm probably an hr after ordering. When we did get the food several things were missing so I pointed that out, but most of those items never did arrive.  As time wore on I asked for the bill and stated that some items were never served so please remove them from the bill. when the bill showed up those items were not deleted but now we were so pressed for time that I had no choice but to pay they bill and stiff the waitress on the tip.

I like dipping the chips into the melted cheese and the portion is decent as well. As for the Short Rib, I didn't like it as much because it's more to the sour side with a tint of spicy flavor lingering after each bite. I gave this place a 3 Star because the food takes way too long for it to arrive. We placed our order at around 2:15pm (sides and main courses) and it took 15 mins for our coke to come and then another 15mins for the Guacamole and Melted cheese. I remember sitting there chatting with my coworkers for a long time and we saw that it's already 3:15pm but our food still didn't come yet so we had to ask.

1.0,11/26/2018,"Food Poisoning + SLOW service = Don't go hereI booked a brunch with friends for this past Sunday, and we were seated downstairs. It wasn't busy, but seems there was only 1 server for the entire place and it would take 15-20 minutes for him to come by and check on our table each time. We were doing the bottomless brunch ($18) and would have empty glasses and no sight of our server (or any other servers) for gaps at a time. One of the guests of my party ordered 2 diet cokes in between drinks because he wasnt a heavy drinker, and they charged $4.25 PER SODA (no refills) which is kindof silly for soda, but we didn't make an issue of it. Day of, the food was good (tasted good, large portions) but unfortunately, half of my dining party spent that night and the next day sick, puking, using the bathroom, etc, and it wasn't from drinking. The shrimp quesadilla and burger seemed to be the main problems here as the guests who ate these were sick all night/day long. This is severely unfortunate because I've always been a big fan of Dos Caminos and now will never come back to this location and possibly avoid all locations going forward.

Their playlist rocks & keeps you entertained as you eat. The service is great as well- the bar tender was sweet and served us quickly. The only complain I have is that they didn't serve us the free chips & salsa that Yelp said that they would. We ordered the Jalapeño margarita, lime margarita & tried the free prickly pear shots you get when you check in to the place. While the drinks tasted good, they were not very strong and definitely lacked in the fact that they were over $15 a piece. I expect stronger & bigger drinks for that price.

""hello welcome to Dos caminos do you want guac? large medium or small?"" so strange, truly. After the guac came and he asked if we wanted anything to drink, I requested a lemonade which they were out of. I stuck with water, like the rest of the table. I had to seek out the bus boy (?) to fill up my water twice and each time he told the waiter who IN TURN told the bus boy to fill our waters. The dynamic was so strange I wanted to pull the waiter aside and inquire about it.Anyway - with or main entrees which took OVER AN HOUR to come out, I ordered a combo chicken/steak fajita and only the chicken came out. I say it like that because when I asked the waiter he said ""they didn't bring out the steak?!"" would it not be on the same griddle??? I also had to ask when we got the bill because once our food came he was nowhere to be found. They took off the $3 up-charge for the combo fajita but gave no apologies for the poor food quality/service. The chicken fajitas were terribly dry and I would NOT recommend them to anyone.Long story short: terrible TERRIBLE service, average food, not worth the trip.

Our drinks took 30-45 mins to arrive the waiter came to apologize and said they were short staff at the bar and said that the restaurant would do something for us. Our food arrived 10-15 mins later, I noticed that my food did not come to order( I ordered a norteño cheese crisp with steak MW)  and I alerted the server he apologized and showed me the receipt that he did put it in correctly it was the kitchens mistake, that was fine I waited  for my plate by the time my plate got to me I was so hungry and the table was almost done with their food I had the first bite and it was ok. Before taking my second bite I looked at the meat and it was completely raw, it seams the kitchen. Just flipped the meat to make it looked cooked, I was honestly disgusted. I told the server that I did not want to be charged for the meat as I was not gonna eat it but that I was gonna remove it and eat the rest, as I removed the meat and tried to eat the food I just felt disgusted by the red meat and could not eat it completely ruined my dinner. The server apologized and I could see he felt bad.

My yelp check in got me a free mini prickly pear frozen margarita and it was perfect on a hot sticky City day. We split the chicken tacos since it came with 3, and added plantains (if these are on the menu it's a guarantee I will be ordering them) and the ""burger fries"" (these come with crema Fresca, cotija cheese, and a not so spicy mayo sauce). Everything was good!The restaurant is HUGE and the basement is unbelievable. Great place to relax with a group of friends.

We arrived ahead of the lunch rush today around noon, when at least 60% of the basement dining area was empty. We put in our order for our meal shortly after and. I understand that it was our server's first large group, which was why the ordering took about 20 minutes to be placed for a group of 13 people. What pushed our team over the edge was the fact we waited over 90 minutes for our main entrees, and there was still no solid estimate as to when our food would be ready. According to our server and management, the kitchen was ill prepared for the Restaurant Week crowd and was really backed up. I would even be understanding of this, but what really angered me was the fact that other tables who came after us (including other large parties) received our food ahead of us. After investing 2 hours of our time and still without an estimate of when our food will be ready, we had to leave and get back to work. It was supposed to be a work lunch, and I don't understand how an establishment in Midtown East that constantly services an office crowd can expect people to spend 3 hours at an establishment during lunch.

3.0,6/2/2018,"I was craving Mexican food recently but not sure of where to go so my friend recommended we check Los Caminos out. When I first got there I was struck by how big the restaurant was. It was a bit on the dimmer side and the bathroom was in an awkwardly secluded area but it was still nice. The greeter was very nice. He had seated us at the tall chairs/tables but since I had my backpack with me I preferred to sit at the booths and he very quickly accommodated my friend and me to what we wanted. Our server came up shortly after and was very friendly as well. She gave us some recommendations so we decided to order the queso fundido, dos enchiladas and Oaxacan shrimp quesadillas. QUESO FUNDIDO-Was absolutely delicious! However, the tortillas they gave alongside the queso was really dry and not good. Thankfully they also give chips with it if you ask for it; however, the chips are very salty so make sure to have lots of water handy! DOS ENCHILADAS: Not very good at all. The mole was ok, but just did not enjoy the taste of the enchiladas at all. OAXACAN SHRIMP QUESADILLA- Another food based disappointment. Did not like the taste also the made it like a pizza and not really like the kind of quesadilla I'm used to. All in all, though service and the ambiance were great the food was a great disappointment.

We actually had to get up and find our waitress because we waited over 15 minutes just for her to take our order after she dropped off our drinks. I understand that the restaurant does get busy, but we were a big group and had told her we were ready to order in a few minutes after she gave us our drinks. Regardless, the drinks were strong, but delicious. I'd recommend the prickly pear cactus frozen margarita - strange name, but yummy taste! If you're someone who, like me, easily gets table envy (ie other tables food induced a bout of jealousy) then hold that envy down by ordering the sizzling arachera. It tastes amazing, pairs well with the fresh tortilla and lettuce/sour cream, and releases an envious aroma of sizzling meat and onions (not to mention the sound of that sizzle - nice!)I'll give this place one more shot - one night of bad service doesn't make for an awful restaurant, most especially when the food is so dang good.",0,0,0,Czarinah L.,"Neptune City, NJ",559,43,94

1.0,5/21/2018,"So I went to dos Caminos to celebrate my birthday on the weekend. So many things wrong with the restaurant- I wish I could give it 0 stars but unfortunately to write this review I had to give them 1. When we got there we decided to do a bottomless brunch for an extra 18 dollars on top of an entree price (which seemed like a good deal). We ordered our drinks and they took forever to come out. I mentioned something to the waitress and she said they are short staffed and the bartender was backed up (STRIKE 1). We ordered our food which took an okay amount of time for it to come out but when the food came out, here comes (STIKE 2)- the quinoa and rice were totally raw, the bacon guacamole had no bacon, the steak was burnt and they forgot the chicken in the chicken quesadilla. When the manager came over, he asked how everything was, I told him, he was somewhat apologetic but this was the point you say ""what can I do for you?"" There was none of this! Instead they brought us one of their prickly pear drinks, which was a nice effort but they were disgusting. There was 7 of us and not one person drank the drink. When we received the check, we noticed that the bill did not have any of the entrees taken off that were inedible, not even a percentage off (STRIKE 3). Well once again, I asked to speak to another manager, I repeated what I said about the food and he rudely responded by saying ""well did you not eat it?"" (STRIKE 4) Well manager, I actually didn't because the food was disgusting! Not only was the food terrible, the management there is terrible, not a costumer friendly restaurant at all. We didn't even get an apology. And to top it all off, he took of some of the food but condescendingly add to the bill ""did not like"" (STRIKE 5) - sadly, I rather have the issue of not liking the food, but unfortunately we couldn't even eat most of it- disgusting. I would never go here again. This is probably the worst restaurant I have ever been to. Please get it together, maybe train your management, to be nice to their costumers.

Service- I've been to their downtown location a few times, the last time I visited was in the Midtown East with a group of 12. one of the members in our group was Canadian and had a Canadian ID which according to the waiter was not acceptable to serve alcohol to, they required a passport and another form of ID. We spoke to the manager, who could not accommodate us either. They expected us to commute back downtown to obtain the proper identification. This made for a very hostile brunch- NEVER GOING BACK",0,0,0,Gigi V.,"Manhattan, NY",80,14,0

We started with the guac and chips which were decent. There weren't many vegetarian options on the menu so we went for the vegetarian tacos, vegetarian quesadilla and some fries.

4.0,10/6/2017,"I've dined in Dos Caminos many times and have always enjoyed my experience. More recently, I've been getting takeout meals from Dos Caminos via MealPal and they're always pretty good (although portion size is a bit small to me). This review today, however, is not about my experience. The following review was written by a colleague of mine who ate my lunch... I worked from home today and forgot to cancel my meal on MealPal, so rather than letting it go to waste, I offered it to a coworker with the only condition being that he write a Yelp review about it for me. Here it is:----------------------------------------------------------""Today, I was tempted to try Dos Caminos, under the wise tutelage of a good friend and associate. As I made my way to the quaint corner upon which the Mexican grub establishment has staked its territory, I doubted if I truly was in the mood for a spicy beef, guacamole, bean and greens bowl I had ordered. Upon entrance, I regret that I had ordered pickup, rather than sit-down. The place looked vibrant and welcoming. I reluctantly received my bagged lunch, and unfortunately was on my way back to the office kitchen to dine in relative squalor when compared to the outside tables Caminos has set up to enjoy beautiful Fall days such as today. My weapon of choice, a fork. My cleanser, water. My cleaner, a simple napkin. I was ready to eat (I had swished with Listerine after my morning coffee and breakfast sandwich, so no lingering plaque or vestiges of food would taint my culinary experience). The first fork dug into the beef, pivoted to collect some beans, stabbed into several greens, then swiped along the guacamole. I let the food sit in my mouth for a second or two, then begun chewing to release the juices of the meat. Well textured and cooked, I was pleased with my purchase from the very first bit. The second bite did not disappoint either.However, the strength of the spice became a bit overwhelming at times. I do not entirely fault Dos Caminos for this, as my spice taste buds have lain dormant and unexercised over the past couple of weeks. Simply put, I wasn't prepared for the HEAT. Unfortunately, the location of the spice-laced goods were on top of the beans, and rubbing against the Guac in copious amounts. This made my objective of spice separation a bit like the Legendary setting of Halo campaigns... Unless I had hours to spare, I was not going to come anywhere close to 100% completion. Alas, I relent.Serving size was respectably ordinary. The ratio of each component could use some balancing, evidenced by the mush of guacamole after the final forkful of meat had left the bowl (contrary to Chipotle's insistence, Guac should not cost extra judging by Caminos' opulent usage).To Dos Caminos, I say well done, but work remains. A solid 4 of 5 stars. And this is a true 4 stars, not 3.5 rounded up due to Yelp's medieval rating system that makes human beings feel incapable of specific evaluation (a topic for another day). I view my meal as the first bite I have taken out of the Dos Caminos menu. I will return, I will order, and I will devour.

If you want to feel like a valued customer for dropping $20+ per person on an entree alone for lunch, don't come hereI came here for lunch today so excited and left so disappointed. As many others have pointed out, service here is appalling. In order of biggest offenses, our lunch today included:-being served cold coffee. Not lukewarm, not an 'I prefer it hotter.' But cold. C'mon this is obviously a no brainer. -hostess at the entrance was rude. We had a reservation. We asked to sit outside. She keeps my mom waiting for 10 minutes, telling her it should just be 5 minutes while they check outside for a table. I come in to join her and ask why she hasn't been seated yet and that's when the hostess updates to oh we're still checking. Um no, the door outside is right behind you. Checking should be quick. Don't keep guests especially those with a rez waiting. Another no brainer-slow service just the whole time The naked bowl was good as it always is.

First of all, happy hour is from 5-7 and they will only serve you at the bar table which I was unaware of. The bar area is not that big to accommodate everyone tying to get dibs on the happy hour since the prices are too good to be true. The margaritas were mediocre as well as the sangria. While I was standing around due to the lack of seats I heard the bartender give an attitude to atleast 2 people but that's none of my business. OK now let's move on to the subpar food. Since it's $6 why would you not order a bunch of stuff? So that's exactly what I did. Guac and chips were good (which is pretty hard to mess up) but the empanadas....What. Was. That. I wanted to stop ordering after I had that but i wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and got the enchiladas....It was just as bad as the empanadas.. sigh.

At the table we had the Dos Enchiladas, Pollo Tacos (naked), and the Caesar salad with grilled shrimp. Each were portioned just right.

Our waitress was attentive and knowledgeable when I asked her several questions about the menu. Negatives: The taco tortillas completely fell apart. Had they used the common flour tortillas that probably wouldn't have happened. With the guac, it was okay. I asked for no spicy and it had some spice -_- I ate it because I didn't want it to be thrown out. We also ordered mac and chorizo which was probably the best choice we made.

I always get the grilled grapefruit margarita - it's unique and not too sweet. Regarding entrees, you can't go wrong - favorites include the shrimp quesadilla (which is open faced and super cheesy,) the salmon and the fish tacos. Brunch - their brunch is underrated but definitely one of the best deals in NYC. The brunch specials are $16-$21 and include a coffee and drink.

We split guacamole for the table which was excellent. For dinner I had the steak fajitas which were great and just the right portion.

I went to this restaurant around 3:30 pm last Friday--not a busy time for the restaurant. I needed to take my staff for a lunch after a long day of non-stop work. I called and asked if they had a full menu as we wanted dinner--They said, Yes! When I got there, as we were waiting the manager (tall red headed woman) asked the hosts ""What is this?"" giving my staff and I a face like we were bothering her. We were seated near the bar (not a table), but a stool table where all the noise was and were given bar menus. When I asked if we could be seated at a formal table with menus, we were told they did not have a dinner menu until 5 pm. At that point, we were so hungry that I decided to stay--big mistake. The guacamole I ordered had a rock in it. A pink rock, not a lava rock. I told our sweet waitress and she got the manager. The same red-headed manager came over and basically proceeded to point to the Lava Rock Pedestal and told me that the rock came from there and that it is okay ""it won't hurt you"" Keep in mind that the rock I bit on was the size of a pea and I thought I was bleeding. I had to spit it out and ask my table if I were bleeding. She then proceeded to walk away and didn't apologize or ask to replace the guacamole.  I was seething at this point and told the waitress that the manager's response was unacceptable. She got a second manager who then said that the rock actually came from the kitchen where they mix the guacamole in bigger batches. I explained that the previous manager had been disrespectful and dismissive--she was talking super slowly giving me a lesson on guacamole- I said-- Guacamole doesn't have rocks. He offered to remove a guacamole and some drinks, but we did not want the drinks. The red-headed manager returned to say "" I am sorry if you thought I was dismissive, how about we get you some drinks.  I said no, we didn't want drinks and wanted to tell her that we just didn't want to pay for the Guacamole with the rock, but she wasn't listening and walked away and came back with shot-size margaritas. I asked for selter water and so did other people, giving up on her non-listening skills. we got our entrees and found a piece of plastic in the shrimp--at that time, we told the waitress and the same manager came back and said he was embarrassed and that they would also remove the entree from the order. We just wanted to get out of there. I have had previous work lunches here with 10-15 people. Never, never, never again. Never!!!!

We also had the the ceviche sampler which came with 3 types: Tuna Estilo Japones, Red Snapper De La Calle and Lobster Apasionada. Out of the 3 samples, Lobster Apasionada was the best one. The Tuna was overpowered by the soy sauce and he Snapper was god but Lobster was sweet, limey and delicious. For my main entree, I had the Sizzling Arrachera. It's a grilled skirt steak with caramelized onions that comes on a sizzling hot plate accompanied with a side plate of pico de gallo, guacamole, beans and tortillas.If that wasn't enough for a main entree, we had to dabble with a few side orders. The Mac 'N Chorizo, Refried Pinto Beans, Sweet Plantains and Street Corn (off the cob). All hit the spot! Out of those 4 sides, the Mac 'N Chorizo and the Sweet Plantains were a must.

This location is no exception.Lots of business folk from the area congregate here at the bar.  I always like the margaritas, beers and wines but the bartenders never really mentioned any Happy Hour specials and the drinks are kind of pricey.

I may be spoiled by my favorite chain - Jose Tejas.Dos Cominos doesn't put chips and salsa on the table which for me is much more of a pro than a con, because I have no self control.Pro Tip: check in for a free Prickley Pear shot!",0,0,0,Gigi A.,"Manhattan, NY",132,936,5685

4.0,6/30/2017,"I've visited this location about 4 times prior to my last 2 visits. However, the last 2 times I came have been to try the brunch menu and take advantage of the bottomless drink special...Bottomless Margaritas?? Why not?? My boyfriend and I came here 3 Sundays ago and had made reservations for 1pm which weren't needed because there was more than enough seating both inside and out. The weather was absolutely brutal that day so we decided to stay inside and enjoy the AC. We immediately ordered the frozen margaritas on the bottomless brunch menu which you can not go wrong for $18..2 hours of unlimited Margaritas. They tasted so refreshing but the bartender is definitely generous with the alcohol serving because 2 Margaritas later I had to throw in the towel and call it a day. My later visit which was the following week for Fathers day, I decided not to order the Margaritas since they packed a punch and went with the mimosas. Those also were given a generous serving of champagne and refreshing OJ...I was able to put away 5 glasses with no headache lol. My mother who is not a drinker, went with a Mojito which she enjoyed but didn't finish because it was a little too powerful for her but she really enjoyed the taste. Both my brother and my father indulged in the bottomless Margaritas and were more than satisfied....they did the job for the boys. I think it is an awesome idea to offer bottomless margaritas for brunch because their are only a handful of places that offer that special.  Now lets start on the food ..for brunch with my boyfriend, we both ordered the steak & eggs off of the brunch menu that was accompanied by hash browns & refried beans. The dish itself was delicious however the serving of steak was rather small. Thankfully enough we ordered guacamole and chips as a starter which was mouth watering and full of flavor. The steak was cooked to perfection as I ordered it, medium well but could've used a tad more seasoning. Everything on the plate meshed well together for the most part but I feel that if I didn't have the guacamole as a starter, I would've left hungry. I did return back the next week because I boasted to my father about the bottomless Margaritas as well as the tasty food so off we went to brunch for Fathers Day! For a starter, I insisted that we order a large guacamole and for the entrees both me and my brother went with Dos Enchiladas while my father went with Tour De Tacos and my mother ordered the special item of 3 tacos on the menu for that day. The enchiladas that my brother and I ordered were amazing. They were overflowing with perfectly seasoned chicken and cheese inside while covered with refried beans. I am unsure of the name of the tacos that my mother ordered, but they were massive and came in a trio. There were generous slices of steak inside with salsa and other ingredients. Now for the plate of the hour.....Tour De Tacos...my fathers plate. For the price of this plate ($39) I expected bigger sized tacos but I guess we paid for the quality of the food rather than the quantity. However, this long serving of 8 tacos consisted of 2 of the same taco which were steak, fish, beef and chicken. This plate can definitely be shared by 2. My fathers taste buds were more than satisfied for once. I must say that I am delighted that on this return that none of us ordered from the brunch menu because our servings were a lot more bigger but the taste remains the same. We also decided to sit outside because the weather wasn't as hot as it was the last time I came with my boyfriend. Our server was quick and very knowledgeable of the items of the menu which made it easier for us to make a decision on what to get. The summer is upon us and I will be returning again!",3,1,3,Janine K.,"East Elmhurst, NY",287,118,1165

1.0,6/18/2017,"We recently had dinner at this restaurant. Our family of eleven included five children. We were seated in the lower level of this restaurant. Our first complaint is about the noise level. Music is played at such a high volume that people, even just across the table, had to yell in order to be heard. Our waiter took an order for Guacamole, to be served while we read through the menu. This order never arrived and we had to reorder. Once we placed out dinner orders, we waited one hour to be served. More than one dinner arrived cold. Due to initial long delay and the fact that we had several small children with us, a decision was made to eat the food cold rather than suffer an additional long wait. One, in our party, ordered a dinner salad appetizer. This order was not brought until the main course was served and was, therefore, refused. Between the extremely loud and uncomfortable background noise, the very long wait to be served and the general lack of quality service, there is no way we can recommend this restaurant.",0,0,0,Ken T.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",0,55,0
3.0,6/15/2017,"I had a co-worker in town and we wanted to go somewhere good. We heard a lot of great things about Dos Caminos so we decided to try it. I made a reservation for 12:15pm through open table and got seated immediately upon entering. The greeter was pleasant and nice. Things started off really well.Once we were seated our waiter came over to provide us with menus and waters. This is where things started to trend downwards. We did not see our waiter game for at least 15 minutes. When he finally came back we all got in our food order as well as chips and guac for the table to share. By this time half of our lunch break was already over.I went with the chicken quesadillas with a side of sour cream. The server also provided us with beans and rice for the table to share. My dish was overall fantastic. The chicken was very moist and delicious. If you come here i HIGHLY recommend this dish. The guac and chips were amazing as well. We went with the medium spice and it had a nice little kick. Not to overwhelming where it took away from the guac Overall when it came to the food, things were great. It just sucks that we had to scarf it down to so we were not late going back to work.Outside of the food however, the experience was terrible. This is because we rarely saw our waiter and had to wait an absurd amount of time to ask for anything. When your in the middle of a work day, time is crucial. If the service level was much higher I would have given  this place a 5 star.Overall, I would come again but hopefully the service will be a lot faster.",1,0,0,Peter L.,"Jersey City, NJ",215,124,174
3.0,6/14/2017,"Like many other Yelp reviewers have said, bring on the half stars! This is one of those restaurants which I feel deserves a 3.5. I have been to Dos Caminos (various locations) multiple times. It has always been a solid meal... not great but not bad. I visited this location most recently for brunch with a group of friends. We ordered the guacamole to start. They always bring out a hot batch of chips with a trio of different spice level salsas. I have to say sometimes this is the part I enjoy the most. The guac is good but like many hip Mexican restaurants it is SO expensive. I mean really 30$ for a large thing of guacamole seems a bit excessive to me. The brunch is nice because in includes either a cocktail, coffee or juice. I had the Lemon Blueberry Pancakes (16.00) with a blueberry compote and lemon-lime sugar. It was a HUGE stack of pancakes I think there might have been a total of five or so. I love sweets and I mean LOVE but to be honest these were way way too sweet for me (and everyone else who tried them). I found myself digging into the middle of the stack to try and get some that weren't drenched in the sugary syrup. It was quite disappointing given how good these pancakes were. They were delicious but couldn't' be fully enjoyed because they were masked by the overload of sugar. I think there are plenty of better restaurants in NYC but there are also plenty of worse restaurants.

4.0,6/6/2017,"This was an amazing dinner to say the least. we had a large party of 20+, but had a dinner table all to ourselves (also available are large parties, small booths, and tables for as small as 2 people dining).We started with appetizers - chips and guacamole. The guac was authentic and had large chunks of avocado- personally my preferred style, as well as other sauces. Then salad was served- nothing amazingly special but it was good- the Empanadas for Platano- great vegetarian dish- had black beans, queso añejo and the plantain's sweetness definitely complemented the inside well.For my entree I had the Salmon a la Plancha- the salmon was cooked perfectly- the roasted spaghetti squash was a bit too sweet but eaten with the salmon and ""mole coloradito"" it definitely worked to make the salmon more than your typical dish. The dessert though- I tried the dark chocolate tamal. Basically a chocolate lava cake- which was amazing by itself- but the mandarina sorbet gave it a delicious citrus flavor that you could dip it into. Great and would definitely recommend this restaurant!Only because of the very large party as well as it being a networking event, the dinner service went slower than normal- took their time serving each course- but don't think that is the norm for regular dining experience.",0,0,0,Emily G.,"Atlanta, GA",468,118,193
5.0,6/2/2017,"This place was recommended to me by my sister who happens to work in the city and frequents this establishment all the time. My friends actually spent Cinco De Mayo here recently as well. They both had great things to say about their food and drinks. My sister couldn't say enough great things about the happy hour from 4pm-6pm (they also have late night happy hour from 9pm till closing). So we made it a point to hit up happy hour at 4pm (happy hour only at the bar and lounge area) to make sure we had seats especially since it was on a Friday evening. We started off by ordering our first round off drinks which were the el camino margarita with passionfruit and a prickly pear frozen margarita. Our bocaditos were two orders of the tacos duo and sharable chips/guacamole. Our first round of drinks were strong and they were delicious! The tacos were very flavorful with great sauce accompaniments and meat inside the tacos were savory. The chips/ guacamole came with three types of salsa which were pretty standard with the order and good too. Our second round of drinks were another passionfruit el camino with passionfruit for me and my sister ended up ordering a frozen margarita with strawberry; both were excellent and we were both feeling the alcohol at this point. Our third round was a Tecate beer with a salt rimmed glass with lime juice poured in with the beer for me and my sister ordered a prickly pear frozen margarita; which was another hit with us. Our fourth round came down to ordering the free prickly pear shot you get when you check in at the restaurant through the yelp app which was awesome! The service was pretty good despite the rush in from other patrons and our bartender Chloe was amazing. She was very attentive and apologized when things got crazy around 5:30pm for the dinner crowd. She didn't have to apologize but she kept us happy and always asked if we needed anything else. I really appreciated that one of the managers walked over to the bar area and asked everyone if they were enjoying their meal which I don't see very often in NYC. Just for service we ended up giving Chloe over 22%.The atmosphere was casual yet very intimate at the same time which I appreciate since I had my own idea of it being a dive bar. Not only we met with wonderful staff but enjoyed quick conversation with other patrons who also were there for their first time and/or frequent customers that happen to work in the area. Over all, I couldn't have left any happier. The tacos, chips, salsa hit the spot and the drinks were delicious. Happy hour prices were reasonable.

1.0,5/24/2017,"Heartbreaking because I generally liked this place but my last experience was so unfathomably bad I swear it could have been on one of those prank shows where they see how far they can push you.Came here for brunch pretty late in the afternoon, so it's not like it was crowded. Inside was completely empty. We were seated outside. It's quite a while before our server comes and fills our water glasses, but maybe they're in between shifts, so whatever. She doesn't come back until 20 minutes later to take our drink orders. Since it took her so long to come take our drink orders and we had no idea when we'd see her again, we order everything at once: three brunch drinks, guac for the table, and three entrees. She makes some comment like ""Alright, let's just get it all out there I guess."" A little rude, but maybe it was just a joke that came out wrong.20 minutes go by and we still don't have our drinks or chips & guac. Nothing. I guess she finally noticed because our drinks came about five minutes after that. Five minutes later she comes by and says, ""You ordered guac, right?"" Yes. You took that order. 30 minutes ago. At this point people who came after us have drinks and chips in front of them at the very least. So we say yes and she says she'll bring it soon. She comes back about 7 minutes later with guac and a basket full of chip fragments. I don't think there was a single whole, unbroken chip in the entire basket. But we're starving and a little frustrated so we do our best to munch on fragments.10 minutes later she's taking the orders of the table next to us, and as she's leaving says to us, ""Haha, you really got the bottom of the barrel on those chips, didn't you?"" and claims she'll bring us new ones, which at this point we had no faith in happening but it was also an irritating comment to make since she didn't seem to think they were a problem when she brought them out originally.So to recap, at this point we've been at the restaurant for an hour and have gotten one round of drinks and a handful of chip fragments. And yet we STILL hadn't complained at this point, holding out trying to assure ourselves that the food will be totally worth it.10 minutes later, the entrees are delivered by someone else -- not our server. One of them is cold and one of them is incorrect. We send the incorrect one back (after all, $20+ is a little steep to just put up with getting the wrong thing), and I assure my lunch companions to start eating, as I'm sure the correct dish will come back soon. It didn't.15 minutes go by and I still don't have my entree, so my boyfriend finally caves and goes inside to ask to speak with a manager. They tell him the manager will be right out and send him back to his seat, where we sit for 10 minutes and no one comes (not even someone with my food.) So we get frustrated and go inside to again, ask for a manager. The hostess goes downstairs, comes right back up and says the manager will be right up. Five minutes later we're still waiting to speak to someone, so I go downstairs and say surely there must be a manager somewhere in this restaurant, right?The manager doesn't look me in the face the entire time I'm telling him how our experience has been. He tells us to hang on, and then just kind of stands there for five minutes, and then asks us to show him where we were sitting because apparently our server's name and ""outside"" wasn't enough information. We go outside to show him and a different server, with whom I haven't interacted at all, tells me that my food is on the table now and he comped it and the guac while shoving a bill into my hand. He asks if I want it wrapped up and I say no, at this point it's been over 90 minutes and I just want to leave.So we ended up paying $50 for 90 minutes of sitting, three brunch drinks, 6 chip fragments, and two mostly untouched entrees. We could have just gotten up and left without paying and without saying anything at any point in time and I'm sure no one would have even noticed, but we were trying to do the right thing and at least somewhat salvage the experience. What a slap in the face. I am absolutely never going back.",0,0,0,Courtney L.,"Astoria, New York, NY",0,2,1

The highlight of the meal was the Street Corn.  Had I known it was going to be that delicous I would have skipped my meal and ordered 3 of those - absolutely delicious.I have to say that for the price we paid it could have been alot better.,1,0,0,Kim O.,"Yonkers, NY",67,190,2

We were able to sit outside in the nice weather.  Our first problem was our waitress did not like to be bothered, which is a very big problem when you are a waitress, she also kept sunglasses on the entire time she waited on us.  Dos Caminos brunch special is where you get a meal as well as a beverage.  I ordered a margarita and asked to pay the $1.00 up charge to make it Mango, which I have done multiple times before at this restaurant.  The waitress immediately told me that I could not do that, it is not possible, there is no way to ring that up.  I proceeded to tell her I have been doing it for months (at that very location as well).  She was extremely nasty and augmentative about it.  Finally she left to ask the manager (which surprise it was allowed).  The drink I received however was vile. It basically looked like someone poured thick mango syrup all around the outer edge of the glass and then dumped in a regular frozen margarita (which was a white color).  I have gotten frozen mango margs from this place dozens of times and I have never received one like that. Basically whoever made it was lazy and could not be bothered to mix it properly.  I drank two sips and it tasted just as disgusting as it looked.  My coffee I ordered I had to ask for three times and it took over 25 minutes to get the first cup, and asking for a refill it took another 15 minutes (after asking another waiter) to get it for me.

You get your drink, which is delicious (and generally pretty strong), but then you don't know here to stand.  Your table is finally ready, so you go to the back of restaurant and sit.  You order the  guac.  It's really good.  You then order your food.  The food tastes good, but is super overpriced for the amount of food they give you.  Therein lies the issue.  The service is great, the drinks are strong, and the food is tasty.  However, the overall experience is average and you end up being disappointed with the amount you pay for what you get in return.  Still, it's one of the few Mexican restaurants in the area, and when you're starving at 8pm on a Tuesday and craving Mexican, you're sometimes willing to put up with the inconveniences.  Sometimes.",0,1,0,Johann J.,"New York, NY",6,12,0

4.0,4/30/2017,"I'm normally not a huge fan of this type of chain restaurant specially because there are so many other options in city, but Dos Caminos has always been consistent and have a great location. Classy, casual, and delicious all at the same time. The atmosphere is what makes this place a cozy, classy spot. There is an upstairs area with a bar and a larger downstairs area with a bar. The guacamole is absolutely fantastic. For lunch, I ordered the tacos, naked style. For context, the tacos come two different ways: naked (bowl style) or classic (corn tortilla). I'm not a huge fan of corn tortillas, so the bowl was the way to go. The bowl came with grilled veggies, beans, avocado, a vinaigrette dressing, beans and rice on the side, plus lettuce, quinoa, pickled peppers, and pico. Vegetarian end note: Hear out the specials as they have some good ones. And definitely try the vegetarian tacos and enchiladas with squash, avocado, etc. Prices are definitely on the mid to higher side but the atmosphere and food quality is worth it.

Host and waiters were nice and attentive. We ordered the guacamole and chips because they were obviously promoting it. It did not disappoint. The small is pretty large. Good for two-3 people. I ordered The baja tacos which had grilled skirt steak*, tecate battered rock shrimp, sriracha aioli, bacon guacamole with the corn tortilla. It was amazing!!!!! Best choice ever.

Also: is Mexican food supposed to be very acidic? Since whatever I had, the PH levels were equivalent to the aftertaste of vomit. I'm not kidding. I wish I was kidding.

In fact, when you go to a BR Guest restaurant, you are pretty much guaranteed a professional and solid experience.  I went to a late brunch and I was surprised that the quality of the food had gone down a lot. The soft tortillas were thick and rubbery and the food presentation was terrible.  I couldn't even recognize what other people had ordered since it looked like a pile of slop.  I wish I took a photo. The side of rice was flavorless and everything was the same flavor of spiciness. In addition, they ran out of Bloody Marys during the bottomless brunch.  I'm not sure why they couldn't make another batch but I was told they ran out of ingredients.   The two hour limit for the bottomless brunch is moot because each drink takes 30 minutes to arrive.BR Guest is starting a frequent guest program but I think they would be better off concentrating on their food and business management.",0,0,0,Yumi K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,15,1

4.0,4/2/2017,"Dos Caminos is one of my frequent stops for Mexican food for three reasons - it's very close to work, it's next to a subway line, and their guacamole is everything. As a matter of fact, the best part about Dos Caminos is their chips and guacamole. The chips are always hot and crunchy with just the right amount of salt. The guacamole is fresh, creamy, and made to order to your preference.  You could probably get by on a meal of just chips, guac and margaritas and be more than okay - the portions are really that large. If you have any room to fit anything after eating the chips and guac, they have great food and desert options. I tend to get the fish tacos or take a chance and get one of their daily specials. Everything is always fresh and tasty. I took off one star for the service as it can be hit or miss. One day you'll go there and the server is fun loving and engaged; the next time you'll go there the server barely remembers to refill your drink.  During peak times, I would make a reservation if you don't want to wait as it is always crowded. I have only seen it empty mid morning or late at night.

After we sat down, it took five minutes before our waitress came over to ask us if we wanted water. When she came back with the water, she asked us if we wanted to start with guacamole. Then it took her ten minutes to come back with it. In the meantime, we were frantically trying to wave her down to place our orders, but she was nowhere to be found. We ended up placing our lunch order with another waitress. Then when appetizers came for some of us, our original waitress, Brianna, was still nowhere to be found. One of my colleagues needed a spoon and another didn't even have a setting. When we finally waved her down to ask for a spoon, she said she was ""looking for"" one, and disappeared. We sat there for another five minutes before she came back. She also claimed that she ""misread"" the handwriting of the waitress who took down our order when we pointed out that we didn't get one of the appetizers we ordered. She said she would put the order at that point, but that it would take at least ten to fifteen minutes. By that time, it was at the end of our meal and we just wanted to leave.Throughout our meal, we would have to wave down other waitstaff because our waitress was nowhere to be found.

Our original waitress came over, saw that Tasha was clearing our plates, and just walked away without helping her.It was overall one of the worst lunch experiences I've had in NYC.

Ceviche was a bit too salty, that I would have to keep on drinking water; chips were alright, but come on, how could you even mess up with that?? For main course, I opted for the pan seared chicken - this one was actually not bad. Chicken meat was tender and well seasoned. Last piece of advice - stay away from the coffee, as bland as a cup of water...I guess it was just hard for me to like Mexican food in general.",12,8,9,Elaine H.,"San Francisco, CA",1221,1748,5633
2.0,1/5/2017,"I'm giving this establishment 2 stars just for the look of the restaurant and the music. So, my friend booked this place for her birthday party two weeks ago. When we arrived to the restaurant they already seated some of the guests which is great in my opinion but they had the tables set up completely separate from each other. A couple of us had to fix the tables so we could all be sitting together. It wasn't the end of the world but I do not see why three girls dressed in heels had to set up the tables properly so everyone would be together. They gave out free guacamole and chips to everyone sitting while we waited for our food. Next thing, the menu was some sort of group pre fixe for the party, a sharing menu. Everyone had ONE BITE of everything for the appetizer. So there was only one plantain empanada for each person and one taquito, just one of everything and then a huge salad which had way too much lemon in it for everyone to enjoy. Then comes out the entree and my GOD they tasted off. The salmon had no flavor, the vegetables where severely over cooked and mushy and enchiladas where so sweet omg. They only good thing was the shredded beef and then again there were only a couple pieces. Then for dessert we had tres leches, ice cream and something else. I was so annoyed by this point I didn't even bother to try dessert. Drinks were expensive but it is NYC so whatever and sodas were included as part of the party package. Now the final icing on the cake, the $1400 bill that included over $200 in tax. Now after we took off the drinks since people had to pay separate for, we ended up with about $1100 that had to be split between 15 people. Now I am not a ""cheap"" person at all but we all left paying at least $73 for food AND WE ALL LEFT HUNGRY. $73 wouldn't be bad if my belly was at least somewhat full but nope we were all hungry after we left. In the end I would never recommend this place for a party. Maybe regular dining would be better but this was a total rip off and I will not be returning.",1,0,1,Natasha C.,"Rosedale, NY",123,20,62

1.0,12/27/2016,"The host staff was incredibly polite and professional. The atmosphere is laid back and kind of interesting. At the bar, while I was waiting to get seated, I was provided with an El Camino margarita. It was just an ok margarita. The flavor was substandard, and it was small. My companion stated to the bartender that prior to ordering a drink, she would like to taste mine first. The bartender never came back, and by that time, I received a page indicating that my table was ready. I couldn't get the bartender's attention to order another drink, or even pay for the one that I had already received, so I proceeded downstairs to the second host station. We were seated immediately and courteously. After looking at the menu, I was especially enthralled by the ""Baja"" tacos. After waiting more than fifteen minutes, we still hadn't had anyone come to take even a drink order. As we were discussing leaving the establishment, our server finally arrived. My compatriot, informed the server that we needed a minute. We were left alone for a moment, and I was told that the person that had finally come to serve us had been standing behind me at the server station socializing for a good portion of time that we had been ignored.

This place is has absolute terrible service and let down considering some very positive experiences for years at other dos caminos.

Had to ask for multiple things we ordered including chips and salsa, daughters orange juice, salsa and taco dish.  Also, ordered a jug of Sangria which we always do from Dos Caminos and this had NO fruits at all. A terrible experience from start to end. We were told the waiter was overwhelmed but there was only one or two tables being waited on. Plus were told that kitchen had run out of some of the beans and other things hence some dishes wouldn't have that included; rather, the little bit of rice and beans available in the kitchen would be given to us to share.

1.0,12/4/2016,"Yesterday night I went out with a few people to celebrate my cousins birthday. We had reservations for 745 but there was ridiculous traffic so we called to change it to 815. We were told it was fine and they'll see us soon. When we got to the restaurant around 8, the hostess greeting us said they haven't had reservations for more than 3 hours and couldn't find our name. I was beyond aggravated. When I was finally about to ask for a manager, she mysteriously found out reservation and didn't even offer us an apology for saying we had none. After we finally got seated, our waitress came by and asked for our drink order but she only took one persons drink order for a party of 5 and instead of asking around the table, she just left. She was gone for half hour. Didn't even check up on us. My whole party was very frustrated. She finally came back and I asked for a coke. Pretty simple right? She didn't come back with the coke for 20 minutes. We decided that the next time she comes back, we're just going to order everything so she doesn't disappear again. The food took forever to come. I ordered the traditional Guac and trio salsa. The Guac was really good! My boyfriend ordered the shrimp enchilada and said it was very soggy and he didn't enjoy it. At the end of the dinner I asked for the check and the waitress said she placed a dessert order for the birthday girl and said ""but if you guys don't want it, it's fine. I mean it's free but if you don't want it."" Her tone was so rude and was as if she was doing us a favor by giving us something ""for free"". I didn't appreciate her whole service. Her name was Chloe because I made sure to check on the bill. We still gave her a well beyond 20% tip though she didn't deserve anything.

My friend's vegetable tacos were hard to eat, since the vegetables were cut unevenly and uncomfortably. We also got dessert, which was good, but my friend was brought a dirty spoon and had to request a clean one. The waitress also forgot that I requested a second meal to go, and I had to request it after she brought the check. The asada tacos I requested to go were more fat than meat and were almost inedible.

4.0,11/16/2016,"The morning of UFC 205 we set out on a mission to attempt to remember where our favorite diner was located.  After roaming around and not finding it, we stumble upon Dos Caminos which had a nice brunch menu.  The goal was to fill up our stomachs so we wouldn't need to eat a ton of food at the fight later in the night.  The ambiance of Dos Caminos upstairs is half bar, and the other half has some tall chairs and tables for patrons to dine at.  Downstairs, where the restrooms are, they have a lot more tables to serve people.  The setting downstairs is a darker more romantic/classy vibe and would work great for an evening.  It took a while to get service, but since we weren't in a rush it wasn't a big deal.  However, the lack of promptness from our waiter wasn't as attentive as we would've liked, but I was fine being patient especially since downstairs looks huge.We ordered the pomegranate+butternut squash guacamole to share.  My fair lady ordered the tostadas which were two taquitos but she mentioned they were stuffed with a lot of meat.  She also ordered some type of entree off the brunch menu that didn't look appetizing to me, but she said it tasted okay.  The guacamole was good, and I wanted to follow that up with enough food to fill my stomach.  So I ordered the pumpkin pancakes, and the french toast off the menu.  Usually I eat a lot and its no problem for me to finish 2-3 entrees plus an appetizer or two if I go out eating.  Well their pumpkin pancakes and french toast were soaked in syrup.  I had a tough time finishing it all likely due to the heavy layering of syrupy goodness or the fact that I got 5 pancakes.  Which in most restaurants is rare to get that many in a pancake dish.  The banana french toast which also tasted and had good flavor and a large portion size.Eating our meals at Dos Caminos left us pleased and happy, I do know I will remember the location for future meals in NY.  I also know I won't order my usual multiple entrees since one entree and an appetizer could've kept me going.  The decor and tv's upstairs also creates a unique environment for the restaurant.",0,0,0,Eric W.,"Jessup, MD",3,28,8

4.0,11/2/2016,"My four stars are an average: 3 for food and 5 for service.  One bartender, really.  I'll explain.After being disappointed by Korilla (see my last review), we set out a few hours later in search of yet another deli.When I'm on the hunt, I've usually got Yelp open on my phone and I'm usually looking up as many restaurants as I can while also taking in the sights and sounds.  I discovered that Dos Caminos offered a free prickly pear shot to Yelp Elites.  We did an about turn and headed straight for Third Avenue.Sorry, bubala.  We'll see you next time.  My field needed watering.I'm a whore.Dos Caminos is a beautiful restaurant.  That put me on guard immediately.  I've never been to a restaurant that was done up like a geisha that also served amazing food.  But that didn't really matter because I only went in for the shot.My stomach was already in knots from partying all over the greatest city in the world the night before but I was feeling ambitious so I showed the bartender my Yelp app and she gave me the shot.  One whiff confirmed that I'm not a hair of the dog person.  I gagged and pushed the shot glass towards Miss K.  She had had a lot to drink the night before too but it doesn't affect her.  It's her heritage; vodka is like creatine for her Irish liver.  She took the shot, loved it, and ordered another drink while I looked at her in disbelief.I sat there, miserable, wondering whether the cooks would let me stick my head under the broiler and give me sweet relief.  In the meantime, Aishlinne, the redheaded bartender, and Miss K were becoming friends.  How the fuck is she so chatty after a night of drinking, I wondered.  I was just glad that no one was talking to me.To distract myself, I looked at the menu.It was a creative menu, with items such as a Mexican fondue with chorizo, shrimp quesadilla, and a handful of brunch items on it.  I went back and forth between these before deciding on the skirt steak and eggs, an item from the brunch menu.  Brunch seemed like the perfect antidote to the pain of having my brain gang banged.This cost around $20 but the sliced steak was just a little bigger than the size of my palm and the fried eggs and hash brown were about the same size.  There were a couple of crisp tortillas and a bowl of beans and tomato-flavored rice on the side too.While I was too cranky to give credit where it was due at the time, it was, all things considered, a decent amount of food.  The only change I would have made would be to make the steak bigger.  It had a robust outer crust and it was a perfect medium on the inside.  The egg whites were firm and the yolk was just a little runny.  The hash brown was incredible and so were the rice and beans.I was reluctant to admit it because I have a bias against glittery restaurants but the food was actually good.  Powerful flavors were where they needed to be and subtle flavors were where they needed to be.Meanwhile, Aishlinne was demonstrating why bartenders from Ireland (and I don't mean Irish-American) are the best in the world.  She was pouring, mixing, shaking, and being interesting and friendly at the same time.  We can make jokes about it but the Irish are to bartending what Navy SEALs are to combat: Elite.Unless you're an elite wanker, you can expect warm service without a drop in the quality of drinks.  As I began to feel better, I piped in with a few one-liners and she even laughed at those.  Something about her old-country charm must have rubbed off on Miss K because she started to charm every server in her vicinity.  By now, I wasn't so much baffled as proud.Aishlinne and Miss K now have each other's number and they're going to hang out when Aishlinne comes to town.  Aishlinne paid for two of our drinks.Amazing.To recap, the service was everything you'd hope for.  It was quick, welcoming, and helpful, mostly thanks to Aishlinne.  The food wasn't the best brunch I've ever tasted but it was good enough to make me curious about the other menu items.  Miss K got a salad with chicken and chorizo to go and it was really good.  Seared chicken and soft chorizo on fresh leaves is a simple but effective combination.I can't believe I'm saying this but I might check in to Dos Caminos again the next time I go back to New York.",3,4,3,Prateek S.,"Boston, MA",118,186,721

My friend and I walked in around 615 and asked for the hostesses for the menus. We were provided with the menus for happy hour and dinner. They asked us which menu we wanted to be seated for and we asked for the happy hour menu. They told us we had to sit at the bar, but the bar was full so that was a little confusing. I expected a bit more guidance to say something like ..""looks like the bar is full...here's what you can do."" We eventually just asked to be seated for dinner outside. We walked out where a waitor greeted us and i asked if we could sit at a specific table. He said it was fine and the hostess came out of the restaurant to  guide us to a different table. He and I told her we wanted to sit at a different table and she looked a little annoyed but luckily that was the end of the interaction with her.Once we were seated, the only annoying thing was a wobbly table, but we got over it because everything else was great. Two men waited on us and they were extremely friendly, helpfuly and pleasant. Made for a perfect choice for a wind-down evening after a stressful day. Food was good.

2.0,10/5/2016,"I really wish I could give this a higher rating but sadly I must stick with 2 stars. My friend and I were visiting NYC and looking for a convenient bottomless brunch. We stumbled upon this place since the drink menu looked good although the entree prices were on the high side. As it is a beautiful day outside, we sit on the patio which was nice and spacious. We start with the butternut squash guacamole. This has butternut squash, pomegranate seeds, sunflower seeds, and probably some other things I can't recall. All the toppings were just sitting on top of the guac versus mixed in. Odd but ok. The guac was $14/15 and was okay tasting but not worth the price. Next I order a chicken quesadilla and it comes out VERY oily. Literally you could see my plate covered in oil. I could barely eat it. The server was very nice and asked several times how the food was but I wasn't in the mood to have them remake it so I didn't mention it at the time. My friend ordered steak tacos and asked for the steak to be cooked medium rare and the server mentioned it's cut into thin strips so it's cooked well done. When they come out they are well done cubes. Definitely not what she was looking for. The prices were extremely high for poor food. My quesadilla was $18/19 and her tacos (came with 3) were $18/19 as well. If the food wasn't so bad and overpriced, this place would get more stars. However, I thought the drinks were really good. I started with the prickly pear marg and it was strong! I moved to straight champagne after. The server was very nice and constantly checked in. That's why I'm rating this 2 stars versus 1.

3.0,9/26/2016,"I have been to this Dos Caminos location may times as well as other locations. Most recently, I went on a Friday night with 3 of my girlfriends. We ordered drinks and shared a few entrees. We sat outside trying to enjoy the last of the nice warm weather. Besides the bees flying around all of our sweet cocktails it was nice sitting outside watching all the people walk by.The service was EH. Not sure if our waiter was new or just doesn't know the menu but we asked him a few questions and he didn't know the answers or gave us incorrect answers such as does the steak entrée come with the rice and beans. His response ""no"", actual answer, yes they do come with rice and beans. He also hardly came over which was a pain when we wanted to order another round of drinks and couldn't.I tried a new drink instead of my go to Mexican Star which is always delicious. It was a grilled grapefruit margarita that the waiter promised would be amazing. It was alright. I liked it better when all the ice melted haha! We ordered a chopped salad. It was alright, don't think I would order it again because there was nothing special about it. The skirt Steak Asada is my go to at DOs Caminos. It never does me wrong and that night it was delicious like always.

Made a reservation on OpenTable but didn't even need one (the entire downstairs area was empty). My favorite part of this restaurant is the decor. Steel gates separate booths and tables into sections, the bars are dimly-lit, and there are funky things to look at on the walls. They also have clean bathrooms but they're tucked away in private party rooms so there's that.Our wait staff was pleasant. I say staff because we had 3 different waiters during the course of our meal. They gave us water but never asked if we wanted anything else to drink. The guacamole is good and medium spice was just the right amount. Thing is they offer it to you like it's going to be free and then ta-da! it's $12 on your check. I had the ""naked"" fish taco. It was hearty and filling but could've done with a bit less quinoa. Again come here if you're desperate for something in the area.

For those who don't know about MEALPASS, I would describe it as a lunch subscription service where you pay a set amount ($120/month) to get 5 meals a week from different restaurants in the area.  You choose the MEALPASS dish and pick up at the designated time. This was actually my first time trying MEALPASS,  I chose a chicken salad from here, the salad was described as having corn, beans, tortilla chips and onions. Once I arrived at the restaurant is asked the hostess where I could pick up for MEALPASS and they asked my name and gave me my meal.  I really liked that there was very little waiting, and the food was ready for pickup. The salad was as described,  I would have picked better greens and added more veggies, chicken was seasoned well.  Overall, the salad was good and the ease of picking up was extremely easy.",0,1,0,Elianny S.,"Astoria, NY",159,368,1449

We got the lobster guac to start off which was different but really good. I LOVED it. I also loved the three salsas they give you in the beginning of the meal to dip with the crispy tortilla chips. The orange spicy one was by far my favorite out of the three and my boyfriend enjoyed the green mild one.

2.0,9/1/2016,"We should have known to leave as soon as we were sat in a cramped corner table completely out of the way in back of the restaurant. Our party of 5 didn't have enough room for anything without being on top of each other. We started with chips and guac which was pretty good. The mango cucumber margaritas were okay, pretty small for the price. As we waited for our entrees which took almost an hour after our app, we noticed this huge disgusting looking roach crawling on the floor. We threw a cloth napkin over it and went to tell the manager, who played it off as a ""water bug"" saying it was no big deal..disgusting. The food was heavy and greasy and just gross. Our server decided to wipe the table down while we were sitting there with one of the cloth napkins and knocked over my drink all over my new white pants. She was in no way apologetic and said ""I'll get you some soda water"" and came back with a dab of it on a napkin. Are you joking? As someone who's been a server for quite sometime this was not appropriate. She heard someone say it was my birthday and brought out a piece of cake with a candle in it, I'm guessing to try and makeup for what happened. She then disappeared and didn't bring more soda water for me to try to get the stain out of my pants. The manager had sent us out a round of the prickly pear frozen shots which were good but she knocked it all over me so that didn't really work out.

Came here with some girlfriends for happy hour and were told we had to sit at the bar to order drinks even though we were planning on staying for dinner. The happy hour is vey selective as far as drinks  and it is a short time frame (4-6:30) but I am glad they have happy hour food specials. I ordered the white sangria ($6) and the guacamole ($6). The sangria was small and nothing special. I was pleased to discover the guacamole was a large portion and also came with a variety of salsas. That being said, the guacamole tasted very bland, which was a disappointment.What was the biggest let down for me was the poor service. After happy hour we got sat by the hostess and it took atleast 10 minutes to get created by our waiter. They were busy, so I understood that. But the amount of time it took to get our drinks and food was outrageous for what we ordered. (The taquito appetizer, the cornbread, and a plate of veggies and 2 more sangrias). It was another 10/15 before we got our drinks and atleast 20/30 min before we got our food.

I ordered a full entree beef short ribs with an alleged creamy Mexican risotto whatever that is.the pork rinds appeared fresh but once again had a layer of salt added as did the overly mushy plantains that were soggy sad and drenched in salt was the chef having a bad day?? Everything just had an over abundance of unnecessary salt that was so not needed.When my entree arrived I was instantly disappointed it just looked so greasy sad and forced. I don't know why I didn't take a pic but it was a plate full of ""greasy"" rice with bacon bits thrown in, no corn black beans peppers onions nada so what exactly made it Mexican? And I had 3 pieces of short ribs that could all fit into my hands strategically thrown on top of the ""creamy Mexican risotto"".And the short ribs had sesame seeds sprinkled on top huh I didn't get it? why I didn't get it and also didn't know if my ribs were bbq or blackenedAs I was famished I wanted to taste it with the hope it would taste way better than it looked, nope it didn't!  The ribs were COLD but the risotto which I realized was just white rice cooked in a creamy sauce was warm besides the fact that it was extra chewy, extremely chewy as a matter of fact.  As hungry as I was it wasn't worth it not in the least.I called the very nonchalant waiter over who was completely clueless that we weren't enjoying our food as well as the fact that he can't be completely oblivious to the fact that the food isn't so great here.Anyway I called him over and informed him that the meat was extremely tough and chewy and his response was yes it can be like that at times let me know if it's too toughhuh pardon that's what I am doing now Normally I send food back and get something else or just ask for it to be removed from the bill but based on the level of service or lack thereof as well as how everything else tasted I didn't want anything else from the kitchen and just wanted to get out of there.And not once did thd waiter stop by to ask how everything was and the place was empty!we finally asked for the check and the waiter had the audacity to ask if we wanted doggie bags for our food hmmmm no if it had been good I think we would have eaten it I left all 3 tiny chewy short ribs on my plate as well as majority of the rice It was blatantly obvious that neither of us had barely eaten or touched our food so why would I want to take it with us. Any attentive and observant waiter would have totally noticed and gotten that and tried to make amends some how!....urghhhhhhhhhhhhI was just confused as to what food you all were rating when you have gave this place 4 & 5 starsI would never recommend this place or ever go there againI could have just gone to Chopt and gotten an expensive salad but knew it was going to be awesome!!never ever again",2,0,0,Tj J.,"Newark, NJ",27,27,17

We went to this location for a late lunch. The main issue that differentiates third ave from the other is quality control. The menu is the same so I ordered the same dish (mahi mahi tacos). The ones that I got at third were TERRIBLE. They were so soggy. I don't know if it was the lettuce or the tomatoes but the entire dish was just sitting in the water that had seeped out of the taco, which made them cold. Not at all like the order in flatiron. Additionally we ordered the Mexican city street corn side dish, like we did in flatiron. It was so underwhelming. There was almost no seasoning, no heat, no salt.

4.0,7/8/2016,"Delicious. There was some confusion with the menus and I initially picked the steak but found out I had ordered off the wrong menu :-( our server was quick to offer me steak quesadillas, since I told him I was really in the mood for steak. They were delicious - it tasted like a steak had been grilled, sliced fresh and made into perfectly cooked quesadillas and not some rubbery chewy over cooked steak. Chips and guac was delicious and so were the three salsa's that came with it. Didn't get a chance to try the margaritas, as I was on a lunch break from work, but I left feeling stuffed and satisfied. Salads that some co-workers ordered were huge and looked good - many others in my party raved about their dishes including the ceviche.

W​hen we asked the waiter about it, he called over the manager.  The manager asked to see the coupon again and did agree to switch the ​pitchers​, but it seemed like an inconvenience.  We were also frustrated that water was sporadically dripping down from the ceiling.  When we mentioned it to the waiter, he said it was just condensation.  If it only dripped once I wouldn't mind, but the water dripped multiple times onto my shoulder and head, and once into our guacamole.  ​The guacamole and tacos were pretty good, but the overall experience wasn't great.  The Gilt coupon was a good deal, but the staff didn't seem to understand it and we felt like an inconvenience.",2,0,0,Caroline H.,"Manhattan, NY",180,157,163

Major plus in my book because I love a happy hour drink as much as the next person, but food is my first love.I like the atmosphere/decor. I think it is fun and a little different. It has outdoor seating which is great for the summer. Also I really like that you see a diverse crowd of people there.Other pros:The food taste goodThe small guacamole is rather largeI've gone back again and plan to go back later this month - which is rare for me.

3.0,5/19/2016,"It was rather late on Mother's Day evening by the time we showed up for dinner. We rather naively thought that more places would be open late, but, no. We chose this restaurant because it was literally a block from our hotel, and looked inexpensive. If you're dining here - especially if you're dining at night - be warned: the dining room is dark. The table of ladies next to us all brought out their cell phones for the flashlight capabilities, it was so dark. I'm not sure if they're setting a mood or trying to hide something, but reading the menu is nearly impossible in that lighting. Our waiter that night was kind of brusque, but they had seated a few tables in his area right before closing, so maybe he was upset by that. He clearly wasn't amused by us, or by the food allergy in the group, but at least he took the time to go over suitable menu options with us. Our first order of business was to get the drinks squared away. We were in a Mexican restaurant, so of course we had to order margaritas. Duh! I thought I ordered the prickly pear version, but what I got sure didn't taste or look like it. Not wanting to argue, I stuck with it. It was sweet, not overly alcoholic. Pretty watered down, actually. For dinner, I went with the night's special, which was a brisket beef nacho platter. It was okay, but there was an off flavor - I think it was the layer of refried beans at the bottom - that permeated the dish. The beef topping the nachos was either overcooked or very old; the texture was hard and crunchy, and it was bland. I couldn't finish the meal - not because I was full, but because it didn't appeal to me. The chips that were untouched by beef, sour cream or beans were pretty good, though...It did what we needed at the time: provided food and drink.

It was nothing special. And the chips were too salty.I ordered vegetable tacos, which had no flavor whatsoever, and were so hot that I could not finish even one of them. It came with rice and beans, which were not very good.

2.0,4/5/2016,The food wasn't the best. The experience start off negative when I was given the dinner menu instead of the lunch menu. I ordered my food and it wasn't until the food came to the table that we realized it was the wrong item. The waiter was nice enough to have the kitchen prepare what I ordered even though it wasn't on the lunch menu. I ask for my steak medium but it came to the table rare.

4.0,3/28/2016,"Four Stars because they FINALLY got a boozy brunch aka AYCD cocktails. This place is pretty good but wayyyyyy too $$$$ for mexican food IMHO. I'm from TX, land of the $5 Mexican plate that comes with enough food to feed a small family. Not so coincidentally, it's probably the fattest state in the US...but that's beside the point.  Food is good. Margs are on point. However, when I eat Mexican food, I should not have to wonder if I'll need to wash dishes to cover my meal when the check comes. I think their old brunch deal came with one drink, and all the ones after that were like $13 or whatever they charge. I like to get DRUNK at brunch and pricey cocktails don't fair well with those plans. YAY FOR AYCD BRUNCH!  Okay rant over. Good food. Good drinks. Good brunch deal. Coming any other time?

4.0,3/14/2016,"Came for the first time during the last day of restaurant week for lunch. The menu offered an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert for only $25. Cocktails not included and ranged from $13-$15.  I tried the Gran Diablo (delish) and the passion fruit cocktail (large glass pretty good).Even with the restaurant week menu you can see the place is pretty pricey. There's a millionaire $45 cocktail. Wut. Is that made with Jesus juice? Appetizers:""Caldo"" Chicken soup with huge avocado slices and chickpeas. YUMMMM. Great flavor. Guacamole: standard flavor, huge serving though and they give you three differing dipping salsas.Entrees: First visit I had the short ribs torta. Meh. The pickled cabbage wasn't fresh and it needed more vinegar. The bread was too large and not toasted how tortas usually are. Sweet potatoes fries were good but the gravy poured over them was eh. Should've served it on the side. It got dried out and clumpy on the fries. For my second visit I had the skirt steak and rock shrimp tacos. The flavors were great but this dish was soooo greasy that it felt heavy - despite the small serving. Maybe some greens could've lightened it up a bit.Dessert:That coconut rice pudding though!!!

2.0,3/14/2016,"Unfortunately this was a pretty awful experience, from the unprofessional ""welcome"" we received from the hostess to the disappointing service we received from the bartender. A small group of my friends and I went to this location on a Saturday afternoon, a recommendation by me from having a very pleasant experience at the location on Park Ave. There weren't too many people in the restaurant but the hostess told us there was going to be a 20 min wait (although there were visibly a few tables that were open), so we went to the bar to seemingly enjoy the happy hour that was going on. The bartender took about a solid 5 minutes to approach us, and didn't even make eye contact before that. The slow service was likely due to the fact that she was the only bartender on a Saturday afternoon during happy hour... so she had to not only make the drinks for the patrons at the bar but also those seated throughout the restaurant. The small group she helped right before us ordered two beers and a margarita, and the bartender gave them the beers before going to make the margarita. Upon serving the margarita, one of the patrons mentioned that she gave him the wrong beer. The bartender took the beer back, asked the patron if he drank out of it and he said no, then SHE PUT THE BEER BACK IN THE FRIDGE. This is like health code violation 101 and that group plus my group made a comment to her about restocking the opened, served beer and she ignored us. Now to our experience: we all ordered the same thing--pre-made sangria--and she brought us 2/3 (probably because she could only carry two from one end of the bar to the other) and said she'd be right back with the other. She then proceeds to the next set of customers, takes their order, cashes another group out, then decides to go to the other end of the bar where she already poured our last pre-made sangria and brought the last drink over to us. We were pretty much fed up with the bartender and asked the hostess how much longer could we anticipate waiting before we were seated and she looked at me with an attitude and said ""I said 20 minutes"".... although a significant amount of time passed from when we initially entered the bar. I understand that working at a restaurant can be pretty frustrating, but your customers should never receive this sort of service. That being said, I will never return to this location and will never recommend it to anyone. Moreover upon reading a few other reviews, it seems like management needs to have a chat with their employees and explain the importance of good service.",1,0,0,Alysa M.,"Chicago, IL",2,30,1

2.0,2/21/2016,"We ate here as my friend was craving for Mexican food, she wanted some churros. But it wasn't a good choice...Guacamole: served with a trio of salsas and warm corn tortilla chips. The chips are warm but you have to eat them quickly because they cool down fast. We prefer the guacamole with lime, so we had to ask for lime to put in the guacamole. There was a lot of chips and avocado is very filling, after the guacamole, I was quite full. Shrimp al ajillo: red chile, marinated shrimp, soft corn tamal, mojo de ajo (garlic gravy). I didn't like that when I bite into the shrimp, there was a sound between my teeth as if there were sands in them. Unless it's the seasoning, but it makes me cringe. On the other side, the corn tamal was good, very sweet. Despite the red chile, this is not a spicy dish.The main dishes come with achiote rice and black beans puree.Coconut rice pudding: mango sorbet, pears. I chose this because it has fruits in it, which makes it refreshing. But it's not an exceptional dessert. The waitress forgot to give us utensils for the dessert, so my friend told me to put my face on the pudding. But I don't eat like a barbarian. :PChurros on the side: it's not listed on the dessert menu, the waitress mentioned it since my friend only wanted churros. It's 4 sticks with chocolate sauce. The churros are hard, and coated with a lot of sugar.

We were also both thankful for the Yelp Check-in frozen Prickly Pear treats. The overall decor and ambience here is dim, sexy and quite nice. Much nicer than the locations on Park Ave or Soho. The food across all Dos Caminos' locations always remains consistent...consistently disappointing that is. Then again, no one likes the food here if they're actually looking for authentic Mexican food (or has good taste in food...yeah, I said it). Dos Caminos' cuisine is more like a fusion of slightly Latin things with anything else they can fuse it with.Dos Caminos also makes the WORST mac and cheese I've ever had. It's seriously underwhelming and bad in all ways. The one food item that I WILL rave about here is their Queso Fundido Chorizo dip. Then again, how do you mess up anything with melted cheese, seasonings and chorizo? (Well...throw in wheel-shaped pasta and they manage to destroy chorizo mac n' cheese, but yeaaahhhh...).Last time here I also decided to celebrate my boyfriend's half-birthday (bwahaha!!!) and much to his surprise, they brought over warm chocolate chip cookies with lit-up candles and we all sang him 'Happy Birthday'. Poor guy. I'm a trip, lol - but we got cookies and they were the best thing we consumed here after the cheesy dip.I think this is the nicest of the NY Dos Caminos locations - the downstairs part at least. If you absolutely must go eat at one of these locations (with all the amazing options to be had in the best culinary city in the world) - then I guess this one would be eat.

4.0,12/30/2015,"I went to dos caminos on a Wednesday without a reservation. The first hostess was very dismissive and upon entering told my party of four that we would have to wait for 35-40 minutes and that she would text me when our table was ready. So we decided to wait and went to a few stores around the area to kill some time. We went back to check on our table, 40 minutes later and the hostess rudely told us that she thought the wait would be shorter and that she would text us when our table was ready. After waiting a total of an hour and 15 minutes I decided to approach the other hostess Sydney (I hope I got her name right), she was EXTREMELY professional and apologetic. She quickly called down stairs and we were seated two minutes later. She really changed the whole vibe of the restaurant and I thank her on behalf of my party!! Once we were seated we had the mild guacamole which was so fresh and delicious. I had the chicken tacos which were also very good with a spicy kick (which the waiter kindly warned me about). I had a spicy drink (I don't remember the name) but it was tasty. Armando was our server and he was also great, and very attentive to my friends and I .

2.0,12/29/2015,After going to the Dos Caminos on Park Avenue I was disappointed with this location. The day I was there for lunch they did not have the item I was yearning to eat! When it came time for desert I tried something new on the menu.  I was disappointed. The whole meal was overpriced. The service was slow. The place filled up for lunch quickly. It was warm weather so the doors were open. I was annoyed by flies the whole meal. I was sitting inside! Even though this location is more convenient I won't return. I'll go to Park Avenue for a quality meal.,5,2,3,Marianne W.,"New York, NY",5001,1224,22079
3.0,12/27/2015,"I had never been to this specific location but still sticking to my usual solid three star review for all the Dos Caminos chains and franchise. I also still stick with my initial feelings on this place: It's great for a drink or three, a free prickly pear shot with your Yelp app check in, and an appetizer or two. Not really much beyond that. Recently came with a friend that was only in town a few days over the holidays. We went with the cadillac margarita and the grilled grapefruit margaritas to start. Both great and unique in their own ways. Splurging for the Millionaire marg was tempting but its also a $50 drink in a regular sized glass. Instead we opted for a flight of tequila at the end of our sub-par meal. Normally, I see tequila tasters in snifter glasses. These were served in regular shot glasses which confused my dining companion as he proceeded to chug his tequila like a shot instead of sipping them as one does. Lolsies. The food: Their guacamole is actually pretty solid. I've had better but this is still quality. It better be for its $14 price tag. We also split the bocadito trio in figuring that it was a good option for trying a wider variety of foods: two pieces of their chicken taquitos, baja lobster tostaditas, and plantain empanadas. Nothing was particularly bad. Maybe the plantain empanada was a bit weird. The baja lobster thing was the tastiest but it was also small enough to be consumed in one bite of tasty mayonnaise lobster delight. The other two bites went not entirely finished and quickly dismissed. Actually, we both agreed that our side of brussels sprouts (even though they were very plain and just roasted) were probably oddly the best thing we ate that night. I've also had their queso fundido once before and that's pretty solid. Bottom line is that its over-priced, tiny portions, and not entirely fantastic food. Come for the drinks and the company, eat somewhere else.*Edit: Nearly forgot that we also split the ceviche sampler: A trio of the tuna chino-latino, red snapper, and baby octopus. The personal favorite of the three was the snapper as it held the most acidity and had the best overall flavor with a good hit of cilantro. The tuna was a pretty pathetic disgrace - literally two flat pieces of tuna submerged in a vessel of soy sauce with sesame seeds. The octopus, while unique, wasn't texture-wise really my thing but it tasted better than I had anticipated. The ceviche even being disappointing was really what set the bar for yet another reason why Dos Caminos sucks.",2,0,1,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",843,1384,11457

But the service was slow and the food was nothing to brag about for the price. We ordered 4 orders of guacamole and that alone was 98$. The portions were small. The over priced entrees come with small family style bowl of rice and bean for people to share. I ordered the roasted chicken breast which came with a small serving of brown rice and a small chicken breast for $20+. The only tasty part of my experience was the chorizo Mac and cheese which was cheesy and tasty. I ordered two drinks the mango margarita and the prickly pear drink and both were weak not enough alcohol for as much as they charge. The things I liked was the guacamole and chips it had very good flavor. I also like the flavor in the pulled pork tacos. Our waiter was super overwhelmed considering it was a few of us. A good tip would be if someone makes a reservation for a group of people have enough wait staff for them. Our waiter Antonio tried his best. He did offer the birthday people dessert.

4.0,11/21/2015,"So my fiancée and I were craving margaritas...I mean, Mexican (hehe) and we decided to come here. The decor is very rustic with low lighting which made for an unexpectedly romantic ambiance. We were immediately seated without a reservation and upon my Yelp check in, we were brought 2 shots of their prickly pear margarita. It was sweet and tangy but a little on the heavy side since it was frozen. For drinks, he had the Hop On Or Die Mexican IPA which was a little strong for me but after all, it's an IPA =\ I had the Cadillac margarita which was very good. I'm not a fan of complex or sweet drinks, especially when I'm eating. We ordered the spicy guacamole which came with 3 salsas and warm chips. The guacamole was not spicy at all! Part of me wants to believe that the waiter did not hear my order but we found tons of jalapeños in the guacamole so I'm not sure about their heat levels. The salsas were great! The spiciest one found itself into my guacamole and the mild ones were great with the chips. For our entrees we ordered the grilled chicken dish and dos enchiladas. The grilled chickenwas seasoned to perfection with a fresh salsa and Mexican rice. I loved the enchiladas verde but the mole sauce didn't do much for me since I don't usually enjoy sweets.

When I ordered my entree (vegetable tacos) I specifically asked for there to NOT be onions in them because if there are, it'll basically be almost inedible for me. The waitress took our order and then came back a few minutes later and asked, ""the onion thing, is that a preference or an allergy?"". Um....what the fork does it matter? I don't want onions in my meal. If i'm paying $15 for an entree, I deserve to enjoy it. I told her how much I hated them and then she commented, ""but there are onions in the guacamole"". I just don't understand why it's a problem to leave out an ingredient I hate. Due to my firm insistence, the server said ""okay okay, sure, no problem"".

Even so, we waited by the hostess stand for about 10 minutes waiting for someone to greet us and sit us down. We finally flagged someone down and got seated. After we were seated, it took another 15 minutes for the waiter to take our order. We also checked in within that time and got a free shot, which again, took forever to come.Finally, half an hour after we ordered, our food finally came. First up was the guac. It was good, not great, but good. We also got the Mac & Chorizo dish. This was probably my favorite dish from the entire meal. It was a tad bit too oily/greasy, but the mac, melted cheese and chorizo were delicious. For the main course, I ordered the carnitas tacos. These were gross. The tortilla was too thick and very bland. The carnitas were okay at best. We ordered dessert as well - blueberry shortcake that I shared with my coworkers. This was my second favorite dish. I've never had a dessert like this before.Overall, food is probably 3 stars (just average), but the service deserves a 1 star.

4.0,9/23/2015,"Dos has multiple locations around the city, but I've only tried this one. I've been here for Brunch, Lunch, and Dinner. In my opinion, Brunch is the best time to try this place.  I can definitely get crowded, but their Mexican fusion style incorporated with breakfast fare is simply amazing.For drinks their grapefruit and organic margaritas are my favorite. Both are a bit on the sour side, but the tequila is smooth and refreshing.  The guacamole is a must! I'd recommended getting the smaller size, even if you're with a group of 3 or 4...they add 3 additional salsa with the chips and the guac is extremely filling. The fish tacos, quesadilla, and chopped salad are great lunch/dinner options, but my absolute favorite is the smoked salmon and avocado benedict (only at brunch time).Service is also great! The waiters/waitresses are attentive and very knowledgeable...especially about the drink menu! The drawbacks for me are that they can get pretty crowded, so waits are often longer. Also, the happy hour is limited and only available at the bar. In my opinion, offering happy hour at the dinner tables is a great way to keep people drinking...at $14 a marg, my wallet cuts me before my friends have to.",1,0,1,Marelle C.,"Manhattan, NY",192,154,0

Tonight I found the service pretty atrocious. Upon walking in, we decided to get a drink from the bar while we waited for a table. The bartender was uninviting, and served half thought out tequila shots (tough to not think of salt and lime with shots). Following our shots there was no follow up, asking if we wanted anything else, and even was cold when we asked about other drinks.

I called Dos Caminos prior to our arrivals to inquire about drink specials and told they had three bars that all accommodate happy hours. Upon our arrival, we were advised by the not so welcoming hostess that there was one bar opened, one bar closed, and the final bar in the lower level closed for a private party. Although disappointing, we stayed as many coworkers were meeting us there and they would have no way of knowing a new location. We squeezed against the railing of the main bar as servers with massive trays paraded back and forth. Two bartenders IN NO WAY engaged us to take our orders. One coworker brave enough walked up to the rubber serving area and was SCREAMED AT that she needed to clear the area. The servers pick up there drinks in that spot. I observed a group of at least 7 women standing in the same area and they said nothing to that group. There was no where to stand as 2 out of 3 bars were closed. Food: We ordered the plantain appetizer which has sauce ;which is super spicy. If you are looking for a nice after work spot. DON'T COME HERE! You will be treated as a nuisance to the bartenders and the hostess' will engage in their own conversations rather than greet you or tell you bye.

Prior to writing this review, I actually gave the restaurant the benefit of the doubt and just assumed we got one bad waiter the first time and chose to go BACK for another try; however, we sat in an entirely different section and got the same experience. The first time we ate at this location, our table waited for approximately 1 hr and 15 minutes to get our food. Meanwhile, the server did NOT come and let us know the status of our order. The second time, we sat outside and the waiter didn't even get us water for about 10-15 minutes! Then when he came over to our table, he was really rude, as if he didn't want to wait on our table. He also didn't refill the water. LASTLY, when our food came out, he didn't come to check on our table to see if we needed anything; my husband ended up attempting to order queso from another wait staff which never came out until we complained. When we finally brought the issues to the waiter's attention, he tried to blame us for ordering from another waiter( when he wasn't really doing his job). In the end, they ended up taking my husbands tacos off of the order. I will NEVER go here again. I eat out over 95% of the time.

There is a large seating area on the sidewalk. Then you go inside and there is the first floor as well as the basement. Since it was balmy outside, we decided to sit in the basement, where the ambience was nice. However, it did feel like a chain restaurant (think PF Chang). In any case, we ordered a traditional guacamole and chips. You get a great portion, along with three salsas of varying spiciness. Lots of chips too. This alone can fill you up.Then we tried the chicken tacos, which were mildly spicy and really delicious. You get three per order. We also tried the pulled pork dish with plantains. It was pretty good, especially the plantains, but the pork itself wasn't the softest pulled pork I had. It comes with tortillas, rice, and beans. Overall, still a very solid dish.In terms of prices, it's definitely on the pricier side for Mexican.

For starters, there were extremely strict cancellation procedures and not everyone was able to pay with a credit card due to Dos Caminos's policy, which is an inconvenience for most.My friends and I had a great time, but the service was awful: it took my friends 45 minutes to get our waitress's attention to simply ask for some water and our waitress simply forgot many of my friends' dishes. Yes, Cinco de Mayo is a hectic day for most Mexican restaurants; however, we received minimal to no apologies for the inconvenience. A few weeks later, I had went back to this location with a work colleague and faced a similar experience.

1.0,8/12/2015,"SO disappointed. (Long review, but I needed to share how bad this was.)We brought some Dutch family here for dinner during their one night in NY and were met with runaround fibs and horrible service.First: The hostess, who, when we inquired about outdoor seating, said nothing of the fact that they had many open tables for parties of our size in the downstairs dining room. Then, when we went over their 20-25 minute wait quote, lied three times saying that our table was being cleaned and setup - THEN finally, that ""It will take longer than expected."" a.k.a. the previous customers never left. After she rolled her eyes at me, we were then immediately seated at a table downstairs...Second: ...which was not cleaned. Glasses and napkins/utensils were being placed on a dirty table. No need for this rush as there were several other tables open that would fit us at that time. When we asked about one, we were told they were for private parties only. Hostess then went to seat us at the plated, dirty table with an un-wiped booth, before a waitress luckily came over and said ""NOT YET. THERE IS BROKEN GLASS."" We stood by while she returned to clean it as the hostess checked her cell phone under the other side of table.Third: The waiter - Robert - introduced himself under a mumble as if we had bust the door open after closing and kept him from his scheduled return to his newborn. Didn't bother to ask if we knew about Restaurant Week and the subsequent special menu. No eye contact. Throughout dinner. Pulled plates off the table that still had food without asking if we were done (WE WEREN'T.) Neglected to bring sever orders, including the Restaurant Week pre-fix dessert.

(She's Indian but she lives Spanish food) I decided that we should try Dos Camino since its Mexican Americanized food. At first our waiter came and was very sweet, he offered us water and gave us a menu of drinks. I told him I wanted something non alcoholic because I'm pregnant, so he suggested a Virginia margarita, so I got that. My friend wanted a refreshing drink but not too sweet, he suggested a drink with mango flavor which my friend was iffy about it cause she didn't want it sweet. He said he'll return the drink for her if it was too sweet, that he wouldn't mind. So the drinks came and my friend didn't like hers (that's when Luis's attitude just changed around) he changed the drink but what they did was add more alcohol instead of less sweeter!! So my friend just said that it was fine. We ordered guacamole for two, the chips were soggy, but the guac was ok. Then when our food came out (which we had 2 quesadillas, one veggie, one chicken) someone else brought the food out. We were waiting for our waiters attention because we needed some water but he was too busy taking care of (sorry to say this, I'm nor racist), the tables that were ""white folks"", that's how my friend and I felt because she's Indian and I'm Spanish and he didn't even bother once to ask if everything was ok. After a few minutes waiting I'm guessing that one of the managers saw me getting frustrated and gave our waiter a signal to see if we're doing fine. That's when he came and we finally had the chance to tell him that we needed water. Again, he didn't even ask how's the food. I asked for some sour cream and it arrived when I was almost done. My appetite just dropped to zero because of this Luis waiter that we had. (Mind you, I'm pregnant!!) When we finished we told him that our left over was to go and when he took out food he out both plates in the same bag (only a moron would do that) anyways, we asked for the check and left.

The Guac was out of this world ... but the rest of the food . was average. Tacos were .. OK at the most and the TRIO-TASTING OF CEVICHE was below average ... .. It tasted more like asian than true mexican.The Good: Excellent Guac - mild medium or hot, accompanied with 3 different kinds of sauce and tortilla chips. Free prickly pear frozen margarita shot if you check-in with Yelp. Good serviceThe Bad:Food is average .. and definitely not the best tasting / authentic mexican. And on top of that, their serving size is extremely small even when compared to other restaurants of the similar price / style in the city.The tacos came with rice and beans on the side ..  again average taste .. .. nothing extraordinary for the price.  The Trio-Tasting Ceviche costs $ 18, and is almost  close to just about 3 pcs of Sushi in size.Overall: Average Mexican Food ...

3.0,7/4/2015,"Stopped by late on a Wednesday night so this location was plenty empty. We wished to be seated outside, but were told that was not allowed if we were having entrées. No big deal, but keep in mind if you want to dine al fresco on a nice night.Started the night with octopus ceviche. A big citrus kick gives life to the usually tasteless octopus. The octopus was prepared well, having that ""crisp"" texture rather than a rubbery one. Good start with a Modelo.Followed with the Barbacoa de Chivo. The goat meat brought down what would have otherwise been a good dish. Great stew to it, but the goat just wasn't cooked right. The Dos Enchiladas was a Jekyll-Hyde meal. One enchilada was the highlight, the other the lowlight. The one lathered in the mole poblano sauce was far too Texican, reduced to overbearing sweetness and cheap smokey flavor.Conversely, I loved the enchilada with the green tomatillo salsa. It enhances the meat and cheese rather than overpower it. If I were to return, I'd definitely order this again and ask for the same enchilada instead of having it two ways.Lastly, you always have to finish with a tres leches cake. I wish I hadn't. Couldn't get halfway through it. It was a salted caramel variety, but the salt sure wasn't the issue. The lack of cream, replaced with far too much caramel made for one unpleasant dessert.",0,0,0,Phil M.,"New York, NY",26,75,54
2.0,7/1/2015,"This location is a personal favorite of mine.  Great drinks, awesome guacamole (spicy!), and respectable food.  Nothing near authentic Mexican, but still good.  Problem with this last visit is that the place was jammed packed and we were seated downstairs (versus our preferred outdoor seating).  We waited 45 minutes for our first round of drinks, that's just wrong.  The final straw for me on this last visit was the DJ and extremely loud music.  We have enjoyed this place so much in the past, but it's clear the management is trying to capture a different audience other than us 80s kids.  We took the hint and left before ordering dinner.  So 2 out of 3 visits have been memorable.  This last one not so much.",0,0,0,Ray S.,"Ann Arbor Charter Township, MI",3,32,13

He even helped us take a picture which was really sweet. We ordered traditional guac and chips. We devoured it! It came with 3 different types of sauce and they were all great! Recommend the guacamole! We ordered the cactus pear margarita and that was great too. It wasn't watered down so thumbs up! The food was excellent as well. He ordered the Mexican burger and said it was amazing! I ordered chicken tacos and I liked them too but I did wish I got the burger cause it looked amazing and he said it was spicy!

3.0,7/1/2015,"The food is decent at this incredibly popular after-work drinks and guac joint that has multiple locations throughout the city.  The space is huge but they manage to fill it up most nights.One of the highlights here is definitely the margaritas (there are several to choose from) as well as the guacamole, which is surprisingly good and comes with excellent tortilla chips.  After the drinks and guac, though, the food downgrades.  The chicken enchiladas are decent, but the tortilla was not so fresh.  Others had tacos and noted that they were ""fine"" but nothing spectacular.Dos Caminos is a good spot for a large group or a happy hour, but it would not be my first choice if I was in the mood for a top quality meal.",0,0,0,Adam G.,"Yorkville, Manhattan, NY",25,134,10
3.0,6/28/2015,"Not as good as the other location I reviewed. Service is nice but still a little slow and the food is a bit pricey for the portions they serve. I came here with three other people and they all agree with the three star rating. Although we liked the food, it wasn't worth the time we waited and the money. Chips and salsa were good to start and we were starving so those were gone really quickly. First to come to the table was my friend's salad which looked really yummy! I forgot the name but it had a lot of avocados. Another guy got the steak tacos which were good too but not enough to fill anyone up. The last friend got a burrito which he said was just average. I got the best dish which was the shrimp quesadilla. It wasn't as cheesy as I thought it'd be but it was the best tasting thing on the table and I even had extra to share with my friend who got the tacos. The shrimp was good and I liked how it was like a pizza.I came another time for drinks and guac during happy hour and those were great. For the people who don't like the regular price tag on the guac, I suggest getting the happy hour guac. Just as good but took a long time to get out again...drinks are strong and not too pricey for the city.

I would return for drinks and guacamole but that's probably it.I did a full tour of the menu so I feel like I should've came across something mind blowing. Guacamole - A nice spice, chunky and I do like their chips.Ceviches - I got the trio to try all three. If I had to pick one, I liked the tuna the best. It's a ""Chino-Latino"" crossover, lot of sesame seeds and a soy-lime marinade. The snapper had a bit too much flavor, to the point of overpowering. The octopus was, chilled cooked octopus. Baja Lobster Tostaditas - Imagine a lobster taco on top of guacomole. The taco shell however is quite small, too small for me. The shell was also a bit too tough, on one point it felt like I was trying to bite through a crab shell.Oaxacan-Style Shrimp Quesadilla - This sounded amazing on the menu. When I got it, I was disappointed. It wasn't as cheesy as I would have liked, it tasted more like a pizza in my opinion. Like the Mexican Pizza from Taco Bell but I think I prefer Taco Bell's.Pescado Tacos - The mahi-mahi is grilled nicely. A little too much slaw, a bit messy to eat. It was decent but didn't love it. For $6 a taco, ehhh.All in all, just okay. The venue is nice, the drinks look awesome and the guac is solid. I'd keep it to that.",1,0,0,Patrick W.,"New York, NY",226,178,709

We also wanted to order food and shouldn't have to have asked for either menu.... If you see someone seated don't wait to get flagged down. We ordered two drinks and the bar back left before we could even open our mouths to order the food. Had to flag the bar tender again and ordered two tacos. One was the chicken, the other was the surf and turf. Might have been called ""terra y mar"" but I'm not sure.... That one was pretty good. Three filled me up but I had also been drinking mimosas all day long and wasn't that hungry.We waited 5-10 minutes with the empty plates and silverware infront of us before they were cleared. We wanted to get another drink but again, we didn't even have time to ask for one because the bar back pretty much ran away from us. Keep in mind by now there are less people at the bar.... Not busy at all. You'd think we would have been catered to more properly but NOPE! After flagging down the bar tender AGAIN, he rolled his eyes when we ordered another drink because he wanted to leave and it was last call. I get it. But if you wanted to leave that badly maybe you should have paid more attention to us???? Just a thought. Also, there were still other people at the bar and tables outside and inside with people seated. Please don't roll your eyes at us for ordering a second drink. It's rude.Then he disappeared and we saw him shoving down food at the micros screen at another part of the restaurant. Infront of the manager.

Me and two friends had the grilled grapefruit margarita, the prickly pear frozen margarita, and the blood orange frozen margarita. All three drinks were EXCELLENT though my personal favorite was definitely the prickly pear drink. I love sweet drinks, and this completely hit the spot. The grilled grapefruit was a little too harsh tasting for me (esp. since my sister requested that it be made extra spicy) so maybe that's why. In general, I prefer really fruity and sweet drinks and this one just didn't feel right.We ordered the special orange chipotle guacamole and I was totally floored by the taste. So fresh and refreshing, perfect creamy texture. Chips to accompany were good, but nothing special. The three salsa sampler they give you with the chips is also delicious-- a personal favorite is the habanero one (an orange/pinkish color that looks odd to begin with but tastes delicious!) The waiter told us this was the spiciest one but it really wasn't too bad.Super trendy inside-- string lights (again, I'm a sucker).

I greet the bartender with a smile and a ""Hi, how are you"" and receive....silence. He was altogether pretty rude, at least to me. When another woman sat beside me 20 minutes later she got the megawatt smile, a menu without asking, a two-sip check-in.  He was definitely more focused on finishing his shift so he could go watch the basketball game at another bar. By the time my friend had joined me a female bartender had taken over. She was polite but again, not attentive. We sat with empty glasses for some time before being seated for dinner. She definitely could have gotten another round out of us. Our waiter was fantastic and provided the excellent service I wish we'd had at the bar. He was attentive without being pushy, moved our table to get us under the umbrella before the rain started, and kept the drinks flowing.

3.0,5/16/2015,"an alright spot, not somewhere i'd recommend though. * the guacamole was fresh and came with tortilla chips. we ordered the medium guacamole, which wasn't spicy in the slightest. also, the guacamole was flavorless. the chips were supposed be served warm but they actually weren't. which kinda sucked. there is a trio of sauces served with the chips but only the ""medium"" salsa was good. * we tried this cheese dip with chorizo. it was okay, it wasn't flavorful though. and it was extremely oily from the chorizo! it cane with three small flour tortillas, which actually wasn't enough for what came in the skillet. so we had to use leftover tortilla chips. which wasn't bad i guess. the lacking in flavor sucked though. * i ordered the ""dos enchiladas"" and it came covered in mole sauce and a different type of sauce. the chicken was roasted (and also dark meat?) and had zero flavor. zero. also, the enchiladas were rather small for what the price was ($19??? maybe more??? just not worth it) * the shrimp oaxaca, it's like an open faced quesadilla. and also, yup, lacked flavor. the shrimp was succulent though. so that's cool. * the margaritas were ""kind of weird tasting,"" so the people at my table said. * the outdoor area is nice. but if you come around 5pm or later, be prepared to hear the loud chatter of people getting drunk after work. super annoying. * the inside of the restaurant was really dark. has an upstairs and downstairs. * lastly, our waiter was horrible. kept the look on his face that he didn't want to be there. was not very polite. and didn't check in with us at all.",0,0,0,Kayla M.,"New York, NY",10,33,66
4.0,5/15/2015,Came here Friday night with some of my co-workers. The first thing that stood out was how fancy the place was. Very upscale looking place great to impress a date. We started with some beers and some fantastic nachos. We next moved on to the entrees we all pretty much had the tacos each getting different kinds. The final note was dessert which was salted caramel tres leches cake and we also had the fantastic Mexican hot fudge brownie sundae. So much food my belt nearly broke.

3.0,5/15/2015,"I had high hopes for this place and came with expectations of a great night, however, that was short-lived as my experience turn sour the longer we were there. I came with a large party for a company dinner and we had reservations so there was no waiting for that. The place is  big and extremely dark so navigating takes some time as they only have candles to light the way.We order our drinks and appetizers which consist of ceviche, guacamole, and chips. The guacamole was amazing and by far the best thing I had at the place. They do variations of their traditional guacamole and one includes bacon, chicharron, and pickled jalapenos which I would recommend. Nothing ever goes wrong with bacon. The ceviche was nothing special and only the tuna ceviche stood out among the three varieties that were given. Our drinks took awhile especially the two beers we ordered which took longer than the appetizers and entrees. I had the Skirt Steak Asada which was pretty good and definitely hit the spot with every bite considering how tender the steak was along with some sun roasted tomatoes to give that sweet and sour difference to my palate. The size was a bit smaller for my liking especially for a $28 price tag on the dish, however, I did enjoy it and was not left unsatisfied.The huge problem I have with this place that they did not hesitate to kick us out for a new group of quote ""hot girls"" and said we had to leave right now. We had no time to relax nor enjoy the rest of our drinks because they just kicked us out after we paid the bill. No better way of saying that entirely ruined my experience.

The server missed our starter - they forgot it but there was so much food we didn't even realize.

My tacos were definitely not fresh.My best friend ordered Chicken tacos and had to send them back because they were too spicy and had a funny smell. My best friend clearly states she wanted her tacos to be mild. She sent them back for empanadas that had plantains and dried beans. These were actually not so bad, but not so great. We could bear with this. The inside of the plantains had a little weird taste but the outside of the plantains helped eased the taste. I've had Mexican food before.

4.0,2/23/2015,"Prior to having a full meal at Dos Caminos, an old roomie of mine was a waitress at the location down on Houston. I could already attest to excellent guacamole and frozen margaritas. Upon learning that family would be in town and that we could be visiting this location, I was excited to try a full-on meal here. What we received did not disappoint.At 6:30 on a Friday, it was already hopping, and our reservation for seven, including three tall and lanky teenaged boys, were kind of crammed into a secluded booth on the lower level of the restaurant, right next to one of the restaurant's cash register computers. (What else would I call that? Hmmmm...haha...) This booth was much well suited for six people or less, so it was a bit of a squeeze, admittedly. That, however, would be my only complaint.We happened to go on a day in February in which the news declared, ""This was the coldest day in New York City and the Eastern Seaboard since 1993!"" When the waitstaff brought complimentary shot glasses of their spectacular Mexican Hot Chocolate over to us, we were all grateful and appreciative. DAMN, was it good, too! It was the perfect combination of sweet, bitter, and cinnamony. (If the latter isn't a word, it is now!) For appetizers, we got their famous guacamole and chips, which held us over well until our meals came. I went for the carnitas tacos, which were flavorful, not too greasy, with a slow-heat that I really noticed after consuming my last taco. My mojito also had me feeling a little tipsy about 1/4 of the way through. Thumbs up to that after a long work week! My family got various plates which they all loved, from the $36 8-piece taco platter for my 15 year old cousin (...you know, growing boys and all...), to the salmon, to the Mac & Chorizo. Our waiter was amazing and we got complimentary plates of luscious Tres Leches Cake with caramel and Apple Empanadas. As we left around 8 p.m., the place was filling up even faster, and I'm glad that we got there so relatively early. My younger cousins, who are a bit of the pickier side, really enjoyed their food, as well as their virgin mojitos, and that made me happy. We ALL were happy, thankfully. I'm glad I actually got to sit down and enjoy an excellent meal there. It was well worth it.",0,0,0,Allison C.,"New York, NY",215,1638,450
4.0,2/22/2015,Came here for happy hour and to warm up before a show. Yes they have multiple locations in NY so can be called a chain and their regular menu might seem overpriced but  the service at the bar was excellent and the happy hour menu was decently priced. When we visited cans of modelo were $3 and bottles of pacifico were $4. We didn't get a margarita but they all looked interesting and I will definitely be back in the summer for one. Anyways on to the food. We ordered the guac which was delicious even though the serving size is more of a personal size. I'd suggest sticking with the medium spice livel as the spicy was too spicy for us (I think I can handle spice). Appreciate the attentive bartender that saw we were struggling with our spicy guac and swapped it out for a medium spice guac that had no spice at all. If you're hungry you should definitely get the tacos as they were the most filling item - we got them with rice and beans. The empanadas were interesting but not as filling as the tacos.,2,0,1,Laksen R.,"New York, NY",315,406,26

I was already irritated when I arrived because of the traffic (all-star weekend plus fashion week equals disaster on the roads). But that all changed when I sat down & saw John's big smile. Let me back track; we sat downstairs in a little corner facing the bar. I loved this booth because we didn't have to worry about scooting our chairs in or ducking when the trays came by our heads. Even though he was under the weather, John had an awesome personality, didn't rush us, checked on us frequently until we were ready to order, and provided recommendations on menu items. The guacamole was just a tad too chunky for me but it was decent. My friend and I hadn't seen each other in 4 years, so the manager & John made it a memorable evening. Take a look at my photos to see everything we tasted. Everything was sooooooo delicious & hot (in temperature!). I'd definitely suggest the butternut squash soup on a blistery winter day. The chipotle corn I inhaled in 2.7 minutes. Even our runner with the pierced ears was awesome (and easy on the eyes ....hello handsome *wink wink*).Everyone was so friendly and accommodating. I'd definitely check out this restaurant when in N.Y. again. They had a dj playing a nice mix and the vibe was just full of flavor! Great place for groups.

4.0,1/7/2015,"To begin with, this restaurant is in a beautiful space. Brick walls, wooden shutters, low lighting, high ceilings, and an unusual triangular dining room made it atmospheric and cozy on a cold winter's night. The food is creative and tasty, while the service is eager if a bit amateurish. For a bocadito, my companion and I shared a trio tasting of ceviches which included tuna chino-latino, red snapper de la calle and baby octopus. All were spiced and marinated to perfection, although the chef was stingy with the accompanying crackers. We each had tacos for dinner. They were small, but there were three of them. I had the mar y terria, a surf and turf connoction with grilled marinated skirt steak, tecate battered rock shrimp, sriracha aioli, and bacon guacamole. I loved it. My companion had the carnitas, slow-roasted pork, green chile salsa, and pickled red onion. We passed for dessert and were disappointed to hear their espresso machine wasn't working. I suppose some would consider this restaurant pricey for a mere Mexican place, but considering the neighborhood, the ambiance, and the quality of the food, I have no complaints or regrets.One personal comment that has nothing to do with Dos Caminos but with our changing culture.

It's only to be paid back on their paychecks??? Since when is it okay to take cash involuntarily from a staff that relies on ...

As for the food, everything we had was good! I decided on the guacamole with shrimp, tomato & chorizo topping as my meal & it was delicious!

The food item that I ordered was described as being covered in a multi-ingredient sauce. As I have a dairy allergy, I asked for the taco to only include meat and the taco wrap. The order was brought out incorrectly. This incorrect order was followed by two other incorrect orders.They couldn't get the bill correct either. We were referred to a manager for our check concerns, and she was extremely rude and dismissive. When I was speaking to her about the concerns with the sauce and my allergy she interrupted me and said that I shouldn't have had a problem because the sauce didn't have dairy, ""I checked it myself"". It didn't even matter to her that I specifically requested no sauce and that's not what I received. She never apologized for the multiple mistakes - we were also overcharged for drinks.We ended up paying cash for the bill - even though the bar requires a card to pay the tab (which we don't have a problem with).  The bartender forgot to give us our card back once we closed the tab. We noticed that we didn't have the card about 30 minutes after leaving the restaurant and immediately called. We were told that the card was found and it would be stored for us. We returned the next day to pick up the card and was told by a DIFFERENT dismissive manager that we didn't have the card.

1.0,11/22/2014,Second time at a Dos caminos and first time at this location. Would have have it a 5 star although I find it way overpriced for what you get but the quality is good. Had a great night with my wife but was ruined by the waiter when it came time to ask for change. I don't appreciate waiters telling me that the amount in the folder should cover the tip. I don't know about anyone else unless you are rich to leave a 30% tip. Regardless of what I would have left. when I ask for change just bring it to me. I've been waiting tables for many years and would never do such a thing.inshould have complained to the manager but was so upset that we just left. Should have complained because these people should not be working in this field. Great way to ruin a great Saturday night out when out of town. Not cool.

4.0,11/13/2014,"Dos Caminos was delicious! The rest of the party I went with may not agree with me, but I was pretty satisfied with my experience here.We went for Sunday lunch because it was close-by, and we ordered two different kind of tacos, a breakfast quesadilla, and their chips and guac.The chips and guac weren't anything special, it was on the chunkier side and they didn't give very much. They came with three other salsas that looked really interesting in color, but flavor-wise weren't very impressive.The first tacos we ordered were Machacado tacos with pork instead of beef, and they were so delicious! There was definitely a lot of flavor packed into the little taco, and I was very impressed.The second tacos we ordered were these fish tacos with a slaw on top, which I wasn't a fan of. The fish felt underseasoned and I'm not a fan of pickled foods in general, so to me this taco definitely underwhelmed.The breakfast quesadilla was my favorite. I don't know what it was, but the quesadilla was very flavorful and filling. The cheese and meat inside the filling were very tasty, and the eggs were so fluffy. They even sprinkled some cheese on the outside of the tortilla to make it a little crunchier. It reminded me of a chinese egg roll, but with a Mexican twist, and becuase none of the rest of my party was that into it, I ate almost all of it.The downsides- the orange juice that came with the brunch menu items were very small and smelled a little bit like alcohol, the service was a bit slow, and the food was a little bit on the pricey side. The positives? Convenient, tasty, and the opposite of a hole in the wall (which I guess is both a positive and a negative).

3.0,11/12/2014,"This location is my favorite out of all the Dos Caminos in New York City.  There is seating on two levels and outside when the weather is nice.  Service is generally good, and unlike other locations there is plenty of space to move around (I'm especially referring to the midtown south Park Ave. establishment). My main concern and the reason for the 3/5 star review is that the food simply isn't good enough to warrant the price.  Nothing knocks my socks off (except for the decor of this location), and you can have better quality food at a much lower price at many other Mexican-style restaurants throughout the city.To give some concrete examples - The Iguana on Broadway and 54th has much better guac, and the same portion is 1/2 the price.  The place is in a worse location though and somewhat skeevy, which rolls up into my final thought below on only going to this Dos Caminos to impress an out-of-towner.Final Thought:The only time I ever go here now is to go to a ""nice"" place, which means friends from out of town are around, or a first date.",0,0,0,Michael S.,"Southaven, MS",14,86,2

The prices were a bit high, definitely not a place you can go for lunch everyday, but it was a nice treat.

3.0,11/9/2014,"I've passed by this place a thousand times, and finally tried it today.  It was okay.Given that there aren't too many choices for mexican food in Midtown East, I might come back here at some point.From a pricing standpoint, this isn't one of those places with $2 tacos, but isn't one of those fancy-pants Mexican restaurants (and I have yet to eat at one of those places with food that's better than the hole-in-the-wall taco places) with tableside guac service and $35 plates.  It's something in-between.The three of us ordered the breakfast quesadilla, the mahi mahi tacos and the Machacado breakfast tacos (which we asked to substitute carnitas instead of beef.)  With any brunch entree (and we ordered two), they give a complimentary drink (alcoholic or non-alcoholic), so that's generous of them.  1) Breakfast quesadilla was scrambled eggs, cheese and bacon / chorizo sandwiched between two heated tortillas.  I didn't think it was particularly special, but my brother loved it.2) A very boring, uninspired fish taco with creamy slaw and grilled mahi mahi.  Saving attribute was that the mahi mahi wasn't dry.  It didn't feel grilled (no grill marks, burnt taste, just white through and through), and instead felt steamed or something.3) Machacado breakfast tacos - highly, highly recommended.  Cheezy, eggy, meaty.  And it had a real explosion of flavor.  The only downside was that the corn tortillas didn't hold up the weight / juice of the contents, and the tortilla split as I picked the taco up.  First world problems, I know.The three of us spent about $75, including tip.Felt unauthentic and touristy.  Nothing here really blew me away, but service was prompt and friendly.  The other thing that made this place a bit of a drag is that it seemed slow.  The decor is probably better suited for late evening dinner...I can see this place having a completely different vibe at 9pm if I came in and ordered dinner instead of brunch.  Maybe I'll try that next time!",1,1,1,Calvin L.,"Chicago, IL",684,59,2

So one day, I decided to pony up a few more bucks for my typical lunch budget and give this place a try. The food was just ok. The food was a bit pricey. The waiter was helpful in bringing me what I wanted that was not actually on the menu. He brought me a guacamole serving for one when there is only a huge guacamole portion to feed four people on the menu. He was able to bring me a cheese enchilada when there was only chicken enchilada on the menu. I had to substitute because I was a vegetarian that day for religious reasons.However, after ordering, they made a mistake by serving me quesadillas, not the enchiladas I ordered. Therefore, I had to wait longer for my correct food to come out. I ate the food and the food was really nothing to write home about. I tasted better food at another cheaper Mexican restaurant down the block which actually offers a $9 lunch special with $2 margaritas.   The worst part of my dining experience is actually waiting for my check. There were countless restaurant staff walking by and I asked a couple of waiters but they never brought my check. I did not have all day because I had to get back to work. Finally, I had to get up from my table, find the waiter at the register so I can get my bill, pay and get out.

None of that fake, sugary margarita mix here. Everything at Dos is sweetened with blue agave and they always use the finest quality tequila. I had the best tacos of my life here, which were a combination of filet, broiled lobster, Mexican bernaise and avocado, which was out of this world. They also throw a fabulous brunch on the weekends, and I always love the pumpkin pancakes and veggie quesadillas.

Lighting was dim yet bright enough to see the food in all its wonderful colors. Plating was classy yet practical, with iron plates to keep the tacos warm.Service: We went around 9.30pm. It wasn't crowded, yet service took forever. I figured its too little wait staff to table ratio. Or simply bad planning since they wanted customers to occupy a certain area as the hours went on. So waiters in charge of other sections were standing around while our waiter took more than 15minutes to get our drink order, and another 10mins after drink serving to take the food order. Food took another lifetime to arrive. Good thing we were in carefree moods where time wasn't so much an issue.Food: Made up for the wait. The chicken in my Dos Enchiladas was well seasoned and tender, with a good mole consistency that didn't dry up halfway through the meal unlike other places I've been to. Tacos Carnitas was roasted well. It wasn't oozing with sauces and contents like from tacos stands. Honestly, I like the oozy tex-mex style, but my hispanic friends commented that the Dos Caminos version was legit. Their tacos had the right amount of well flavored meat and tangy sauces.

2.0,9/23/2014,"I had heard such good things about Dos Caminos, so i was very disappointed after my experience there. I really don't like writing back reviews, but i have NEVER had such a confusing and sub-par experience at a restaurant 1. we came with a group of 5 and it took the waiter at least 10 minutes to even bring our menus. When he finally arrived he rushed us to get out drink orders. It surprised me because we were sitting in the downstairs section which wasn't too full at all. I had never seen a waiter act the way he did, he seemed as if he was annoyed to be working. 2. we ordered chips and guacamole for 5-7 people, and it was tiny. The chips barely sufficed for 5 people and we asked for more plus the guacamole barely did it for 5 people...took our waiter about another 10 minutes. 3. as we were sitting downstairs my friend started getting bit by mosquitos and we requested to be moved to another section, they gladly moved us.. but when we finally moved our new waiter was never introduced, we had no idea who was helping us and we basically sat there confused.4. our orders arrived and there were many things missing. There was no silverware so we waited for that as well. We asked to speak with the manager and they offered us a free round of drinks. Our waiter barely showed up once we found out who he was. He actually seemed annoyed by us to have to deal with another table since we had to move. Then there was an issue with the check and having the free drinks. It was just such a hassle eating there.

3.0,8/17/2014,"Dos Caminos is a solid upscale Mexican chain. Appreciated having the ability to sit outside, though this place is huge and can easily accommodate a large party if needed. Most of their seating is commonly downstairs. However, make reservations in advance, as it's almost impossible to walk in and just get a table (they're on OpenTable). Drink: Had a mango margarita. The drink was good (definitely strong), but the mango flavor was a bit too fake for me.Food: My big complaint with Dos Caminos is the lack of variety in vegetarian options. They have one vegetarian taco dish, which is good but not extremely filling and doused in cheese (you can order without, but then it's even less filling). And for the price they're going to serve for a cheese quesadilla, it's a bit crazy to pay for that too. I ended up having 3 sides that they combined into one plate for me - lime-marinated grilled mushrooms (great, huge pieces of mushroom with terrific citrus flavor); refried pinto beans (got these for protein, they were fine and satisfying, but nothing to write home about); and sweet peas (had a nice chile flavor, but didn't feel worth the $5 price tag). The table also split the guacamole (i like that they let you choose spicy, medium or mild) - we had the medium and it had nice flavor without too much of a kick.Overall, service is fine, food that came out was good, but would like more variety and a bit more reasonable price tag - we left having paid about $40 each, which is a lot for lunch time, even with a drink.",0,0,0,Jackie W.,"Santa Monica, CA",148,209,3

The guacamole comes in mild or spicy .. We chose spicy and it was.  Could not have been happier.  They also offer three different salsas.  Mild, Medium and Hot.  All three were great.  While I am usually partial to the hot things in life - here I actually appreciated the mild tomatillo based salsa the best.  Finally - we had the pork tacos and chicken tacos for dinner.  I definitely recommend the former over the latter although both were very good.In all, I would definitely recommend Dos Caminos and look forward to returning here again in the near future.",1,0,0,Marc L.,"Sea Bright, NJ",21,463,395

3.0,7/31/2014,"It's been a couple of years since I've been to a Dos Caminos, and I just made my first visit to this location.  I wanted to sit outside and enjoy the great weather so settled on this place that was convenient for a friend.  The large outdoor seating is a plus.But Dos Caminos has changed since my last visit to the other locations.  Instead of a nice menu book that had some upscale dishes, they have dumbed-down their food menu to a one-pager, rubber banded to wood board.  The entrees are now casual, typical Mexican fare like quesadillas with attempts to make upscale (and charge higher prices) with one or two ingredients that seem more expensive.  They have a section just on tacos with all varieties from pollo, asada, carnitas, and seafood. The traditional guacamole is no longer made table-side or served in a molcajete.  Instead, it's brought out in a plastic bowl on a platter with the tortilla chips.  The guacamole was still tasty, but we were disappointed the table-side service is gone. Drinks are tasty like the magaritas and sangria.  I ordered the rib-eye steak Alambre skewer for $26 at medium temperature.  The menu description is ""ribeye steak skewer, applewood smoked bacon, cipollini onions, poblano chiles, arroz con crema, chimichurri sauce"".  The skewer came with about 5 pieces of steak that were about 1"" x 1.5"" cubes wrapped in bacon, cipollinis, mushroom, and what looked like green bell pepper instead of poblano.  I don't like bell pepper so I didn't eat those.  My steak was rare to medium rare and the pieces had more gristle and silverskin than meat, making it difficult to chew threw.  I love ribeye steak and like some gristle and fat, but this was inedible and I had to spit out one because it wouldn't break down.  Bacon wasn't crispy.  The cipollinis were hard because they were barely cooked and had little char on it, so I only had one or two bites. The arroz con crema was tasty and rich...decent portion, creamy and cheesy with corn.  There was no chimichurri sauce.  Two tablespoons of some kind of mango salsa that was almost pickled because the amount of lime juice used.  For $26, very disappointed in the steak.  Warm tortillas and a bowl of rice & beans came with the dish.  But my friend ordered the same dish and we were only given one bowl of rice/beans to share.  On our way out, we passed a single diner having tacos who was given the same size bowl for one person.  Feeling jipped.Because of the outdoor seating, drinks and guacamole, giving 3 stars.  But for entrees, the food has gone down.",0,0,0,Nicole D.,"New York, NY",20,346,225

It doesn't taste the best but a diner usually can rely on quick service and the same quality of food (average) each time you visit.Not this time. Is it poor management? You decide.I made a reservation through Open Table. When we checked in the Hostess asked two rounds of questions ""Do you have a reservation?"" not recalling she'd asked me that before because she was wearing an earpiece and listening to a different conversation.We were seated upstairs. The waiter had to cover our station and the station outside. This kept him sweating. Over our table. When he poured water the ice cubes poured out on the table, too. After 20 minutes we had to wave him down to take our order. After 30 minutes we had to find out where the food was.When it was served I asked him what the problem was, was it a problem in the kitchen? He answered that because my dining companion ordered a gluten-free meal it's Dos Caminos' policy that the waiter has to oversee the preparation of the meal's service, and the meal is prepared in a separate area from general meal preparation to prevent contamination. This takes extra time.That seemed only part of the problem. I respect the care management gives to allergy dishes and really appreciate it. But it seemed more that the delay was due to understaffing and putting too many responsibilities on the wait staff and hostesses.How was the food?

3.0,5/30/2014,"Definitely get the guacamole with different margaritas. Dined for a friends birthday and our waiter was really nice and attentive. We were also seated pretty quickly. The ambiance was dark, but beautiful. My rating is solely based on food. The food was okay. Ordered the fish tacos, plantains, and mini shrimp tacos. However, the three stars is due too how much they overprice. While the food was good I paid $20 for ordinary tacos and Mexican food. The drinks were quite strong, but I guess you can expect $15 drinks in midtown. Get the sangria pitcher if you plan to have more than one glass.

2.0,5/26/2014,"I recently went to the NYC Dos Caminos on 3rd ave. The atmosphere was great and the food & drinks were delicious. However it was a big pricey and the server we had was awful. I believe his name was Coran (or maybe Corey) but the way he communicated was just off. I too was a waitress and some of the ladies at my table once waitressed and his excuses were just strange.1- The order from when we arrived at the table, to ordering the drinks, appetizer, dinner, then grabbing the check was strange. We spent 3 hours at our table i think most of it was obviously waiting for the check, apparently we had to specifically ask for the check instead of the waiter asking if we were ready for it, I don't believe he even mentioned dessert. 2- Ordering our drinks he really stuck to the menu, however maybe that is what the restaurant policy is, which is oddly restricted. My friends asked for a specific margarita on the menu but ask for it frozen, not on the rocks. He shot back and said it ONLY comes frozen. I find this difficult to swallow when bar tenders can easily throw it in a blender. 3- Ordering our dinner my friend ordered the skirt steak. She asked for it between 'medium' and 'medium-well' He shot back and said ""well their is not button for me to push for the in between, you need to choose one..."" Why couldn't he just say ""Let me add that note to the order"". I don't really need an explanation of the buttons you press in your system. 4- Another order issue we had with the waiter was the request to have the skirt steak with caramelized onions, he said it does not come with that and didn't offer to add that as a note to the order or charge extra. Is it really that difficult to have that requested order placed in? I see the waiters problems were communication and learning how to problem solve in a special request. You don't need to explain your lazy excuse, it was just unnecessary. Also learn to problem solve so the customer feels comfortable in their requests. The requests we not at all difficult and could of been accommodated for. I might come back here, but it would be for the food, drinks and atmosphere only. If I even got this waiter again I would ask for a different one.",4,6,0,Shannon F.,"Glen Cove, NY",0,4,0

3.0,4/21/2014,"Just an FYI, this review should really be 3.5 stars, not 3.I'm a fan of the Dos Caminos chain and have dined at several of their locations.  What you get is a good Americanized-Mexican meal, at a reasonable price, in a good atmosphere.  This is more of a place to be seen and enjoy the company of friends than to have a culinary foodie experience.  It's a spot you go to with friends to split some guac, get some margaritas, and have a good time.  They even had a DJ at this location, which I'm not sure I've experienced at others.  My favorite part of this location is the outdoor seating they have in the spring and summer, it add a really relaxed and fun vibe to an already lively restaurant.I came to this location with a very large party for a multi-birthday celebration (there were almost 20 of us) and as always, Dos Caminos was more than accommodating to host a large group.  It is hard however, to get consistent service when you're at such a huge table, but that's expected.The drinks were very strong, guac was good as always, and the smoked brisket stacked enchiladas were decent (a few fatty pieces, but whatever, I'm not complaining).",3,1,1,Jackie S.,"New York, NY",1004,802,3287

4.0,4/19/2014,"This is by no means the best Mexican food I've ever had, but it does beat quite a few other so-called Mexican restaurants in New York City, where there's an apparent dearth of good Mexican food.  I've often heard of Dos Caminos described as overpriced, but I really think ""overpriced"" is an overused term.  By the simple laws of economics (price elasticity of demand), an overpriced business would not survive in a market like New York City, and this restaurant has been around for several years.  So let's accept it: if people are willing to pay the price for the food and service, then that is the fair price.  Let's also accept that not all Mexican, Indian and Chinese restaurants need to have a price tag of under $10 for the entire meal!The interior of the restaurant is welcoming; you walk through the bar area into a cozy dining area in the back.  Two staircases lead to additional dining areas, one on the mezzanine level that overlooks the bar, and the other downstairs on the lower level.  The restrooms, clean and well kept, are on the lower level.  There is patio seating outside, but I personally do not like to be sitting in the middle of the busy 3rd Ave traffic while I am trying to enjoy a meal.  OK, now let's talk about the food: - The chips and trio of salsa is complimentary.  The Salsa Roja (red) has a sweetness to it, the Salsa Verde (green) feels a little watered down in terms of spiciness, and my favorite is the Salsa Negra (dark brown), which is chunky and spicy.  - The made-to-order guacamole is nice, and you have a choice of mix-ins.   - El Mexicano Burger: what manner of man goes to a Mexican restaurant and orders a burger?  This dude here!  The fried jalapeno and the roasted tomato mayo on this burger give it a flavor that strips me of all shame, and I proudly devour a burger at a Mexican joint.  - The tacos: I mostly prefer them on whole wheat tortilla rather than corn tortilla.  If you don't specify that you want them on whole wheat, you will by default get them on corn!  The pollo tacos have a spicy salsa suprema, and the chicharon on top gives them a great crunch.  The pescado (mahi mahi) tacos have a crispy, spicy slaw in them, and these are the only ones that come on a different kind of tortilla, rather than corn or whole wheat.  The asada tacos are great, as are the mar y tierra (surf and turf: steak and rock shrimp) tacos, which have a creamy and spicy sriracha aioli (YUM!).  - Restaurant week menu: the crab empanadillas, the salmon mole and the lemon berry tart are not on their regular menu, so I had to make time during Restaurant Week to try them, and I was not disappointed.   - Brunch: the Machacado breakfast tacos, the spicy eggs benedict and the Dos Caminos Rancheros are the main highlights.  The grilled skirt steak and eggs are pretty good too.Try this place, y'all.  It's totes funzies!  [ah, but you'll have to hear all that in my accent!]",39,33,35,Kashif K.,"Manhattan, NY",1485,381,8670
3.0,4/17/2014,"Be VERY careful.   Two glasses of wine at dinner easily leads to two glasses of sangria, followed by a few cocktails at the bar (bartenders here can be surprisingly apt at making you a drink.  For example, if you forget where you are and try to order a dark & stormy, only to find they don't have any ginger beer, you might be presented with a very interesting and perfectly acceptable replacement - the ginger mojito).  The food is conducive to the above sequence of events.  Is it extraordinary Mexican?  No.  We all know (supposedly) that New York falls woefully short of the West Coast when it comes to this entire genre. Can you have a good time here?   Yes.  Unless you are prone to being comatose in cavernous rooms.  There is a large, boisterous, unapologetic space downstairs for group dinners.    What you see is what you get here, and you can enjoy the food (drinks help out here).  Just don't expect anything life changing.  And yes, get the guacamole.  You are already here.",3,3,1,Lu H.,"New York, NY",1218,411,1977

3.0,4/11/2014,"This is one of the most pleasant places to eat outside in midtown, The corner location is great for people watching. There are a few seats at ground level indoors but the large dining room is in the basement. The open space and the nice decor keep it from feeling claustrophobic, but I prefer to eat outdoors when the weather suits.Recent changes to the menu are not to my liking.  The chips now cost $4. They are served with three salsas, advertised as mild, medium and hot, but more like very mild, mild and medium. I am not a huge fan of the standard guacamole, which is not prepared table side and seems overpriced. The upgraded guacamole with roasted tomato and shrimp is more flavorful and worth the few dollars more. Note that if you order guacamole they include the chips and salsa. I also enjoy the queso fundido if I want something more substantial with my chips. The quesadillas, which used to be the go to item  for my co-workers, have been changed. Formerly, you got a mild dish with nice chunks of chicken breast. Now you find pulled dark chicken in a spicy chipotle sauce. My dining companion complained and they were good enough to make the ""old version"" for him, My favorite menu item was the build your own tacos of barbacoa or brisket served with rice &  beans and street corn. Those have also left the menu, although I was told a similar goat fajita can still be had at lunch.  I had already plumped for a brisket burrito, which was pretty good, although all the sauce and heat was concentrated at one end. It came with an interesting salad of spinach, onion strings and a bit of what I thought was dried tomato. Rice and beans came together in a small bowl for the table, a portion that could be bigger. Service on this visit was quite good, although there was an odd delay between the arrival of the chips (nice and warm) and the guacamole. The chip portion was generous so we contented ourselves with salsa in the meantime.This is a professionally run and staffed operation and my experiences have been consistent.

I had the luxury of having the ribeye steak n asked to have it medium but it came out more like well done. It was tasty enough but I would not personally spend $26 ordering it myself. One of my colleague had shrimp quesadillas n said it was really rich. We got assortments of desserts as well n salty caramel cake(?) was pretty good but the rest were okay- i think it was cheese cake n molten chocolate cake with ice cream. So so, nothing to be blown out of the water about. Drinks: i read sangria was good,  so a few of us ordered a pitcher but it was ever so disappointing. Tasted like a watered down wine, spiked with liquor. My neighbor had a skinny margarita and it seemed to be okay. However, the free shot of prickly pear shot that came with a yelp check in was tasty.

BUT both times, the service was sub par. For lunch, we were neglected and it was difficult to get a refill of water or the bill even though the restaruant was half empty.  During dinner, I think the server was trying to get us to leave - he asked us, by rudely interrupting the conversation at least 7 times, whether we were finished with our meal, which was odd because he asked us as we were clearly still eating (I was bringing food to my mouth as he asked), there was no wait as far as we could see, and we didn't stay there that long, maybe 1.5hr total for the meal.  My friends and I were so offended that we debated not leaving any tips, although we thought that would be too mean and ended up leaving standard level tip.So, ok food and drinks, not-so-ok service.

Seating is a bit tight and looks either updated or brand new. We went during lunch and they asked if we had reservations (huh?). It was busy and luckily we were able to snatch a table for 2 in the back as there didn't seem to be any left. The seats were tucked between a row of tables for 2 so it was tight. Advantage: Good way to overhear NYC talk from other couples. I ordered my usual Cadillac Margarita (sweet, powerful and delicious) and for the table, guac. Their guac is a staple and must be ordered on every visit. We asked for medium and it tasted like mild. Entree - I had the SMOKED BRISKET ENCHILADAS which were layered enchiladas of smoked beef brisket, queso menonita, chiltomate salsa, crema mexicana. it was good but I was little disappointed with the meat. It was fatty for the most part and some pieces were inedible. She had the POLLO ASADO 1which was roasted torreado-marinated chicken breast, three color chile rajas, cotija cheese. She was very happy with her choice. Prices - It's NYC so drinks are about $15 each and each meal was $20 or so. We opted out of dessert. Service - Good.

It's probably unfair that I'm basing this on one bad taco dish, but well when you pay that much for Mexican food, you tend to expect amazing entrees. The guacamole is the BEST. There is no comparison and its undeniable that it's tangy, fresh, flavorful and the hyper is worth it. The prickly pear margherita is good, not great. We were full just from drinks and guacamole chips eating so we ordered one entree of the chicken tacos. I know we should've ordered the shrimp or fish ones, but my boyfriend doesnt do sea food and we ordered this. That's still no excuse for a bad dish. Its dry, lacks any distinct flavor, and I could've made a better dish at home in 10 mins. The tacos arent great, neither is the chicken, and it doesnt come with salsa or sour cream or guac to jazz it up. Sad way of ending the meal. It's a fun place for guac and drinks I guess.

Our drinks took a while (not sure why, the place was barley half full at this time) and when they got to the table they were watered down as if they were sitting somwhere while the ice melted. The server never came back to ask us how we were doing so we didnt say anything about the drinks since we were too thirsty not to drink them. Then when the food came out they brought out the wrong dish so we had to flag down our server. We returned it and decided not to get another dish since at this point we were running out of time.

4.0,10/2/2013,"I dined at Dos Caminos for my bachelorette brunch with a party of 10, and I say with confidence that Dos Caminos provided one of the best group-dining experiences I have ever been a part of.From the prompt seating right on time with our reservation, to the great service, and the fact that there were NO dining/order/special request mixups, I have to say we were very satisfied. What is even better is that our waitress honored my Yelp! Check-In offer for the free prickly pear shot, and ended up making one for each of the 10 of us since it was a special occasion! We of course ordered the guacamole for 4-6, and it actually was enough for about 8 of us (might need more if you're dining with a group of ravenous dudes). They made it to order and modified it according to our spiciness preferences, so Spice Fiend Bride (me) ordered the extra side of jalapenos and habanero sauce. The chips were PERFECT and were served with three types of salsa that ranged in levels of heat. The hottest offering was definitely an awesome spice level, but was more heat than texture and substance. The tomatillo salsa was great!A pleasant surprise in any dining situation, not just in Manhattan, is when a drink (or TWO) are included with a meal. In this case, ordering from their Brunch menu meant that you had your pick of both an adult refreshment such as a mimosa, marg, bloody, or screwdriver, PLUS a juice or a coffee. Major win! the Prickly Pear Margarita was on the sweeter side, but not as bad as a strawberry or other fruity-type margarita.The brunch entrees were varied and plentiful, not only in choice, but also in serving size. They were an awesome take on ""modern"" Mexican breakfast entrees, such as Huevos Rancheros, Chilaquiles, and a benedict. I opted for the benedict, because it was served on jalapeno cornbread biscuits, and was topped with a chorizo hollandaise sauce. WOW. I added extra jalapeno on top and was in heaven.Again, the atmosphere was great, service was fantastic, bathrooms were clean, and food and drinks were well-received by all diners in my party! Would love to return to Dos Caminos to try more brunch or dinner next time I'm in Manhattan.",4,0,2,Megan C.,"Herndon, VA",531,659,558

There was some confusion as to when the bar would open--we ended up ordering one round and then re-located downstairs. I was under the impression that we would be sitting down and ordering food, but we did have an order of guacamole, which was rich and had a great hint of lime. For the night I stuck with the classic margarita, and my drinks were well made and strong. By the time 8 o'clock rolled around, the downstairs dining areas were filled up and more people had joined us at the bar. The bartender didn't mind us keeping separate tabs for drinks, and didn't rush us to order more. A bit nicer than the usually around the corner place for after work, and a bit more expensive too.

Then the pork chop. OMG that chop is soooo good! Nice size & flavorful. The soft chicken tacos are also very delish, and it doesn't hurt that Yelp seems to always have a drink special offer running here:).

5.0,8/25/2013,"I was prepared for disappointment walking into this place because of 1) prior reviews and 2) my love of great Mexican food as a former Californian. However, if you truly take to heart that this is ""modern"" Mexican food (read: New York's way of taking Mexican concepts and spinning them totally different ways), then I think this can be an amazing place. Also, I may be a bit biased from the fact that most of my dinner was a gift and so I wasn't as phased as usual by a high bill...Service: amazing. A floor manager came and checked on us. We (my boyfriend and I) were seated at a prime table, exactly where we wanted to be. And our waiter, Brian, knew all the menus very well and allowed us to pick his brain about every course. All his suggestions were flawless, and the timing of all the courses and drinks was perfect. And this was at peak dinner hours on a Saturday night.Food and drink: almost perfect. We started with bacon guacamole, which we mostly loved. However one of the fried ingredients wasn't quite mixed in all the way, so my boyfriend had to pound away at the guac for a while to make it not so fried and chunky. Our entrees--the special (brisket quesadilla) and the jumbo sea scallops-- were both excellent. The scallops were done to perfection and perfectly paired with coconut rice. I would consider myself pretty picky about food, and this was the best dish I've had in a while. Our drinks--rose sangria and a cruiser margarita--were all delicious. My only complaint would be that they didn't seem too strong at all. We split the margarita and had a whole pitcher of sangria, and I was barely even feeling a buzz...but they were very yummy compliments to a very yummy meal.Bottom line: if you're looking for your authentic Mexican food fix, you obviously shouldn't come here.

It is a bit pricey but well worth it. Once you sit you get served chips and three different types of salsa dip ranging from mild to spicy. Do yourself a favor and get the homemade guacamole it's delicious. As for food I usually just get appetizers, between that and the chips I'm full. My go to appetizer is the roasted plantain empanadas, have tried the quesadillas and taquitos both are good but stay away if you don't do spicy food though.

2.0,4/11/2013,"I'm all down for good Mexican food anytime/anywhere, and I was excited to try this place given that it's been around for so long, they have multiple locations, and I heard really good things about it.  I have to say that I was severely let down by my experience here though.I came with a friend who lived on the UES, and when we entered the restaurant, we were greeted not by an attractive hostess but by blasting top 40 music.  We had a brief wait (about 20 minutes) on a weekday evening, and I was looking forward to heading to the back or downstairs to get away from the blaring music...wrong!  We were ushered to our seats which were directly in the midst of the loud scene.  The music and crowd overwhelmed my senses and definitely affected my overall experience here.After we ordered food and drinks, I wish I could say that my experience improved, but it didn't.  We started the meal with overpriced margaritas and guacamole.  The margaritas and guacamole were standard...certainly not worth $14 for guacamole alone.  I had the fish tacos (mahi-mahi) for my main entree.  Again, I was let down by the tacos.  The flavor was lacking and the fish were dry.  They were small, but if they packed more flavor, I would have been satisfied.I don't expect too much from my Mexican food establishments, but if you're going to overcharge for food, I expect better service.  Maybe I just caught Dos Caminos on an off night, or maybe the other locations in the city offer a little better service and food quality.  I don't know if I'll ever find out though because I don't see myself returning here all too soon.",2,1,1,Logan J.,"Boston, MA",160,318,450

My friends and I proceeded to go to the outdoor bar next door for drinks whilst we waited for the text to arrive. An hour and 15 later there was still no text so I called them to find out where we were in the line and was told it would be 10 minutes before receiving the text. 20 minutes passes and no text so I called them again. This time a lady at the other end of the phone was extremely rude and told me they don't take reservations for specific areas (outdoors) and that my wait would be another 15-30 mins. At this point we went back to the restaurant. The lady changed my reservation in the system to indicate that I had only put my reservation at the time that I called her to check on it with the spiteful intention of making us wait even longer, the original hostess that I put my name down with pretended she hadnt seen me an hour an half ago and the 4 of them stood there laughing and staring at us like a bunch a malicious schoolgirls.

The tacos had a tiny bit of the famous guacamole and it was good. * Accompany Rice and Beans - We don't eat beans so we got double rice instead. The rice was a bit dry but had good flavor.

Salsa the consistency of nose runs.  Chips of baked plastic.  Second-rate house margarita.  If you can't get the basics right, why would anyone venture further.however, the service was actually top-notch.  Gotta give them that.

2.0,1/8/2013,"Dissapointed.Guac was so-so, kinda too salty for my tastes and not really memorable. Trio of salsas are nice and spicy. Got a bunch of different tacos. All dissapointing :( Not only was there too much taco shell in ratio to the filling, but the shell was terrible. It was too thick, flavorless, and kind of weirdly chewy. The different meat fillings were just OK. (pork belly special of the day, beef, and chicken) The highlight of my shrimp fajita dish was actually the saffron rice. Even the salted caramel cheesecake tres leches (?) dessert was just OK and i typically LOVE desserts of all kinds. Even my cocktail was gross!

5.0,12/13/2012,"God damn, I love NYC. This restaurant is everything that I love about the big apple and more. First of all as a disclaimer, I was with my childhood best friends who live in the city during this dinner, so I think my experience was perhaps slightly tainted by the amazing company and my utter excitement upon seeing them. HOWEVER, their freaking guac was enough to make us all stop talking to each other for a few seconds after not seeing each other for months. That means it was really spectacular. The pollo tacos are to-die-for...I couldn't understand why my friends were eating the meat out of theirs and leaving the corn shells, because these were equally as good (carbs and NYC must not mix, okay for this Connecticut gal). Again, I found myself eating more than my friends (there was one black bean and plantain empanada left for an inordinate amount of time and I ate that one up willingly). I also had a few of the Mexican Star tequila cocktails (and also cheerfully ate all of the floating strawberries, which my friends yelled at me for not waiting longer until they soaked up more of the liquor......seriously though, I ate everything.). My friend had some spicy cocktail with cayenne pepper vodka and passion fruit juice...it was scary delicious but clearly a slow-sipping type of drink. I will definitely be back to this place, hopefully very soon. It's apparently a super glitzy, trendy spot in the city (for my Hartford/Avon working and living, nearly every medium sized restaurant with dim lighting and paper cut-out lamps is a trendy spot).

3.0,11/3/2012,"Ready to binge on Bloody Marys and bottomless bowls of guac, Dos Caminos could've made mucho dinero off of my vulnerable, weakened, literally power-less post-Hurricane Sandy ravenous state this afternoon. Unfortunately, little did I know that getting a Bloody Mary refill, a lil' salt shaker, or even some tap water would be a mere impossibility due to the complete absence of service my two gal pals and I experienced during brunch today. ¡Qué peña! The food, the brunch deal, and the ambiance could've really knocked this review out of the parque. $13-15 for Tex Mex-inspired, creative brunch fare, including Spicy Eggs or Salmon Avocado Benedict (on chipotle cornbread - nice!), and a complimentary cocktail is one of the better brunch bargains in the city. More importantly, this place quite possibly has one of the BEST Bloody Marys I've ever had. Although my lightweight, empty-stomached self did not feel the slightest buzz, I didn't care, because this thing was damn bueno: pulpy, picante, and perfectly salty. I might've ordered another one, two, or six of these, had our server ever checked on us. We were psyched to learn free coffee was included in the brunch, too, and would've taken advantage of it had we been told this during the 50 minutes we waited in a barely 1/4 full restaurant for our food to arrive. My advice? Order everything you want for the duration of your meal the first second you meet your server, including condiments, all beverages, salt and pepper shakers, and even the check, and you'll want for nothing and leave muy contento, with your estomago and your wallet full.",2,4,0,Erin D.,"New York, NY",935,342,58

3.0,8/1/2012,"We came here on a Wednesday night, around 6pm, and the place was packed outside and at the bar.  Not so much downstairs, or at least not when we arrived.  However, we were told by the Hostess that they have a lot of Reservations coming in tonight.  We said that was fine as we were here for diner and expected a crowd. But then she tells us that we have to be out by 8pm due to the Reservations.Huh?  Wait, why would you sit us at a table at 6:30 that is Reserved at 8pm? What is wrong with putting us at a table that is not Reserved or asking us to wait for an open table?  This was very confusing but we agreed and off we went to be seated downstairs. The waiter came right away and I assumed this was going to be a theme of the night since we had only 90 minutes. He was very nice though and provided water and we ordered two other drinks and the famous guacamole.  The guacamole lived up to its name as it was really, really good.  We also ordered the 4 small empenada's as an appetizer at my friends suggestion.  2 of them were cooked perfectly but 2 were slightly overcooked. Kind of a let down considering the time table we were on.  As an entree, I ordered the surf-n-turf Taco's which were actually not bad.  I was expecting something amazing but I got something that was just good. The service was very good as the waiter was very nice and came by periodically to see if we needed assistance.  Also, he never rushed us even with the deadline approaching. The prices here weren't that bad either actually so I might want to give it another shot one day and maybe taste something different.  Big area for outdorr seating if you get there early enough and beat the crowd. Bar was nice but was filled when we arrived so we didnt have an opportunity to experience it. You can tell it was an after work crowd.On a side note, we left the table at 7:55 so we rock!  Also, I left my sunglasses at the table and after calling to retrieve them, the Hostess found them and I got them back without a scratch.",0,0,0,Erik H.,"Brooklyn, NY",56,252,6

We started out with a margarita (rocks & salt please...frozen ones give me brain freeze), a Dos Equis and an order of their famous guacamole, mild because I'm a huge pansy. I think they used to make it at the table in front of you but I guess they don't do this anymore. Bummer. But I'm fine with that because the guac was perfect...avocados were ripe and creamy with just the right amount of cilantro, onions, tomatoes, salt and whatever else they toss in to make it taste so damned yummy that you want to lick the bowl.I ordered the Mar Y Tierra tacos (basically surf + turf) and my date had the Asada tacos. His were quite good and the sirloin was cooked medium rare and very tender with a little bit of bite to it. But what about my tacos, you ask? Orgasm. For. My. Mouth. Perfectly tender skirt steak + crispy beer-battered rock shrimp + some kind of mouth-watering aioli sauce + BACON guacamole. BACON guacamole? Yes. BACON guacamole. My date had a bite of my dinner and wanted to order it for his dessert. We didn't want the tacos to end. Seriously the best thing either of us had eaten in a very long time.I didn't even eat any of the refried beans and rice that came on the side because I didn't want to interfere with the deliciousness of my Mar Y Tierra tacos.And to top if off, our waiter was on top of things.

1.0,7/10/2012,"loud music, terrible customer service, haughty staff, way overrated.AVOID this place IF you don't want to be scoffed at and be treated terribly by the staff AVOID.I was treated like a CRIMINAL by the bartender and restaurant staff here.Of all the restaurants I've been in Europe and the US, this has been THE WORST EXPERIENCE.Maybe they should get more intelligent, more classy staff that aren't bent on proving a point.Trust all the negative reviews everywhere (google+, urbanspoon, menupages, tripadvisor) about this restaurant, esp regarding the service.(story below, consult NY state law on underage drinking,  section 65-c 2b underage drinking allowed under parental approval in alcohol-selling premises. mind you, I turned 22 this January)I went here with my mother and were told to wait for our table by the bar, so I ordered 2 drinks for my mother and I. The bartender asks for my ID (he's the bald headed one) I didn't bring my passport (I'm visiting the states, not a US citizen) Fine, no problem. I understand I can look under 21, although I'm 22.But he then REFUSES to serve my MOTHER WHO IS 59 YEARS OLD. . Excuse me?? yes, my mother may look young but she CLEARLY looks older than 21. SHE IS NEAR SIXTY for crying out loud!IS HE BLIND? I kept telling him that we didn't bring our passport because it's unsafe and no other restaurant has ever asked us for our IDs let alone refused to serve my 59 yr old mother. He just ignores us. He then promptly serves an elderly man without asking him for ID.So my mom goes to the other side of the bar and orders her drink from another bartender with no problem, no ID asking. WHY is there a discrepancy in alcohol serving policy within the same bar? clearly the bartender was trying to prove his point and being discriminatory to us.Also, when my mother was halfway through her drink, she asks me to hold the beer cause she had to take something from her bag . To my surprise the first bartender comes around the bar, walks up to me. (we're standing at least 8 feet away from the bar!) Tells me I'm not supposed to hold the bottle. I HADN'T EVEN TAKEN A SIP FROM THE BOTTLE! He says, ""yes I know, I've been watching you."" Is this part of his job description to hawk on customers who forgot their ids?? (again what I was doing is not illegal, consult the ABC Law  65-c 2.b) He then proceeds to tell the security guard behind us to ""keep a watch"" out on us so that I won't hold/drink from the bottle. Talk about overreaction. I think this guy was on a power trip, so bent on proving his point.My mother and I were shocked at this treatment, firstly that he REFUSED TO SERVE MY 59 year old MOTHER, that he bothered to walk all the way from behind the bar counter to tell me off, and to warn the door guard. We were SO OFFENDED we decided to leave all together without eating despite the fact we had already waited 20 minutes for our table.On top of this, when we were leaving, my mother asked me to take the bottle to leave on the bar counter. But the second I took the bottle to do so, the door guard comes PUSHING ME with his body from behind, saying I am not allowed to hold the bottle. UNBELIEVABLE. I was just trying to bring back the bottle to the counter for my mom!Everyone at the bar around us started staring at us, obviously who wouldn't if a security guard starts shoving past you? I FELT SO EMBARRASSED and HARASSED. AND I HAD DONE NOTHING WRONG (again look below at law)My mother was so scared afterwards, she broke down and started crying once we left the restaurant. Why did we have to feel so HUMILIATED and RIDICULED?!The bartender was obviously singling me out. I've never been treated SO CONDESCENDINGLY BY A RESTAURANT BEFORE. I felt extremely mistreated.BY THE WAY, UNDER NEW YORK ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE CONTROL LAW SECTION 65-c 2b:""A person under the age of 21 years may possess any alcoholic beverage with intent to consume if the alcoholic beverage is given by that person's parent or guardian"" New York is one of 11 states that allow underage consumption on alcohol-selling premises with parental approval INCLUDING RESTAURANTS and BARS!So WHY was I being treated like a criminal by the bartender and restaurant staff?!It is ALLOWED BY LAW that an underage person can drink OR HOLD A BOTTLE if a parent allows it at a bar/restaurant. I didn't even drink the beer, I JUST HAD IT IN MY HANDS TO HELP MY MOM and the bartender freaks out, and the security guard starts pushing me as if I committed a crime. AND I'm 22 YEARS OLD, not even underage!Is this how you treat your customers?UNEXCUSABLE service I've never been treated like this at a restaurant/club/bar ever before even when I didn't have my passport. If they ask me for ID and I don't have it, then I don't get a drink, fair enough, I back off like I did here, but the staff would serve my 59yr old mother if she's with me.

I tend to like midtown or downtown (as in Park, Madison, 5th Ave, Tribeca or Wall Street) eateries, because they make an effort. And effort they did. The star of the show was the waitress. She was sweet, personable and had a good sense of humor. She had a fresh face and composure. Blonde. Happy. The food, on the other hand, was NOT memorable. Americanized Mexican food. Bleh.My friend and I ordered Guacamole (mild), Steak Tacos and chicken of some sort. If you're going to serve soft tacos, then do so without putting it in a metal holder. When all the juice drips to the bottom it makes it soggy. Come on man. The juice needs to drip AWAY from the soft shell. AWAY. I was not happy about it. I had white wine- I think it was a Chardonnay. Two glasses. It eased my pain. I was exhausted and hungry. But couldn't finish my plate of tacos. I did end up munching on the chips all night, which filled me up a bit.

Considering the price I would say a noche below mediocre at best. It wasn't that the food was disgusting or wasn't fresh but everything was just bland with no distinct flavors. How could you get a taco wrong?? I'd rather go to Chipotle (and that's saying a lot b/c I hate Chipotle!)I was really looking forward to the lobster ceviche but it was whack. I wouldn't even categorize it as ceviche, as there was no cilantro or lemon/lime juice. It was just a piece of lobster atop some random spices that were wayy too hot for my liking.

Yes... a chain owned by BR Guest, the same owners of Aqua Grill, Blue Water Grill and other non-Mexican dining establishments in this town. When I first found out, I felt cheated and shocked, kind of like how Phoebe must have felt in Friends when she found out that her artisan crafted dining table was from Pottery Barn. Dos Caminos may not be authentic but what does that mean anyway? It does a lot of things right and consistently so. I can always find a modern/trendy atmosphere, strong drinks and awesome guacamole there. Oh and there's a fantastic brunch deal.",0,1,0,C. L.,"San Francisco, CA",22,126,4

We were seated few tables in from the stairs on the lower level which was initially fine but then it started to get a bit drafty so, since the restaurant was still pretty empty (it was about 6pm on a Thursday evening) we had asked to be re-seated at a booth table. After the waitress checked with her manager to get approval to move us to another table, we thought she'd simply move us over to one of the empty booths that was located near to where we were sitting but just a little further inward & to the right of the restaurant.  Instead, she takes us to a booth located all the way toward the far rear left of the restaurant near the bathrooms.  I was not pleased with that move at all.  especially since there were other booth tables available closer to where we were initially seated.Anyhow, our waiter for the evening was nice and provided great service.  The food was okay but their guacamole was the best part of my experience here.  I would go back just for that guacamole and that green chile salsa.Great for dates & group/family gatherings.",0,0,0,Sunshine D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,20,0

Started off with a red sangria each - delicious.The host was polite and fast, bartenders were great and friendly, and our waiter was absolutely the best. Guacamole to start (seriously best guac I've ever had). They give you a pleathora of chips to go with it (so many that we ate so much and couldn't finish our dinner) along with 3 salsas - tomatillo, chipotle mild, and spicy. Dip your chip in the guac then the salsa and it is HEAVEN. we each ordered a margarita to go with dinner - he ordered some spicy chipotle margarita which was delicious and I ordered a passion fruit margarita.. which was a bit sweeter than I usually go for but delicious none the less. For dinner.... he had some sort of tacos and devoured them, and I had the shrimp quesadilla which happens to be char-grilled and open faced like a pizza. The most delicious combo of tomatos, light cheese, chipotle, mushrooms and tiny baby gulf shrimp on top. Simply amazing.... I will be back for sure. Ambiance is cool. Trendy, dark.

Freshly made and has some extra savory goodness to it that I haven't found in other guacamoles.

It is high end Mexican style food. They compose their dishes and they put some time and effort into making it worth your while. The Guacamole was literally one of their staple dishes (appetizer or not). If you come here you have to get this. It is very authentic and has a hint of spiciness to it (yes even the mild orders) They feel like they were hand mashed, mixed and composed for you in that moment you order it.  Me and my friend ordered the scallop dish and the trio of ceviche. I would have to say if I wasn't so full from eating all the chips and guac lol I would have probably finished my friends scallops because she can't take spiciness and they were delish. The trio of ceviche was ok. Its a very small portioned dish (quality over quantity, which i expected) but there was just too much vinegar based dressing for me.  We also got a lychee and prickly pear frozen margarita. They were good, but not the best we've had ; ) BOTTOM LINE: GUAC GUAC GUAC!SERVICE:The place is huge..I feel that there are different types of waiters focusing on their individual tasks. There's probably a drink water, a clean up waiter, and your normal service waiter. It was just all very confusing and I felt that they were sort of slow on taking the initiative and making us feel comfortable to the degree of money we were about to throw down. There is just a lot of seats and felt that they were can be overwhelmed on a busy night. ATMOSPHERE:This is probably where they get a lot of their stars. They really took the effort to make you feel special when entering this place. They put a lot of effort into their interior design and created almost a lounge bar vibe for after dinner service. The lighting is very intimate and romantic and even though the place is huge, the manage to partition the spaces well.  I really enjoyed the flare and pride they took into creating the space. It was probably my favorite part of the restaurant! and free jacket service! woot! SUMMARY:Overall..great place for a nice date or just to lounge at in my opinion.  Expect above average Mexican food and a good time.  Don't be surprised by some of their prices as they are going for that fine dining restaurant angle.",0,0,0,Jimmy C.,"Manhattan, NY",209,174,17

The waiter was extremely accommodating about it and sent it back and brought back a different one. It's a really nice place inside as well. Great decor, and surprisingly big. It has two floors, one on ground level and the other underground.The food I got was very good too - a cheeseburger that came with these amazing garlic Parmesan and chili-pepper fries. Their guacamole is also fantastic - as it should be since it costs $24 for just one order of it. You also get complimentary salsa chips with a variety of different sauces to dip it in. Overall a nice restaurant, probably better for lunch than dinner.

Then we met our server, who proudly annouced that he was actually just a musician and he was here because this job payed well. Love him. The guacamole was really good, and they replentished our chips often. But the portion of rice and beans was laughable. Family style my ass, it came in a small bowl that should be considered a side dish.My meal was okay, considering I ordered 1 of 2 vegetarian dishes on the menu (Vegetable Tacos). Too many mushrooms and too little tortilla. Our server kept the evening light with jokes about how he likes his job and how some customers can be douchebags. The dessert was the best part.

2.0,12/10/2011,"We visited this location last night for dinner as a make up for a disaster dinner at Dos Caminos (Park Ave) a year ago - customer service sent a $50 gift card to get us to go back and 'try it again'.  So we ventured to the restaurant to see how things have improved.We arrived and were told we'd have an hour wait.  No big deal though as we didn't make a reservation.  About 25 minutes into the wait, we asked how long we'd be and were told 20 minutes.  30 minutes later we asked again and the guy at the door said we'd be next because they ""couldn't find the couple ahead of us"".  A few minutes later we noticed one of the other 'maitre d's' looking around and asking every couple at the bar what their name was.  We were opposite the bar, literally 3 feet from the hostess stand, and she never once looked our way or asked for our name.  Finally, nearly an hour and a half into the wait, I went up to ask what had happened and was told ""we couldn't find you a while ago"".  I nearly lost it, as we had checked in twice during that time and were standing RIGHT next to the 3 matire'ds in charge of the seating.  Luckily, they quickly sat us.The meal itself was actually quite tasty and the service was pretty decent.  I'm not going to review the food here - I think there's enough quotes all over the site.  However, to end the night, we asked to wrap up one of our dishes.  As the bill came, the waiter didn't have the food.  We asked about it and he paused, then replied, ""oh, sure, it's right over there"".  And to no one's surprise, he came back a few minutes later explaining, ""someone ran off with your food"".  Nothing's worse than when a waiter/waitress lies to cover up a benign mistake.  How about, ""i'm sorry, I screwed up, but I'll fix it""?  Seems so simple.  Anyway, the waiter did generously offer to make a whole new plate (at no charge).So in the end, after 3 hours, we departed.  The meal was fine, but after two visits, I have to say that Dos Caminos is a complete disaster service-wise.  Rude, inattentive, and generally smug staff at the front of the house, and for the most part just a weak service staff - I get better service at the local McDonalds.  If 3 people can't remember everyone whose name is on the list, and then can't even go out of their way to ask every single person in their vicinity, who are clearly waiting to be seated, then they need a better system, or more competent employees.  It seemed pretty obvious to us that they intentionally ignored us as were weren't spending even more money at the bar.   So pass on the $100 dollar tacos and find a hole in the wall that gives you the real thing with a smile for a quarter of the price.",0,0,0,David E.,"New York, NY",39,6,7

It was the Friday evening after Thanksgiving, Happy Hour,  and the upper east side was relatively empty so I think that's why we lucked out.Request a booth because the benches are extremely comfortable and the tables are roomy. The music was too loud and not at all authentic. We would have enjoyed more traditional Mexican Style music but instead they were playing Eddie Money,Michael Jackson and others that did not fit the mode. It's clear Management wants to attract a young crowd and to create a lively party atmosphere but they do so at the risk of compromising the authenticity. Drinks were amazing. We had the El Camino and Cadillac Margaritas.We were surprised that we had to order chips and salsa for $5.00.The entrees were amazing but the menu was very misleading. My wife ordered the Camarones En Cazuela (Jumbo Shrimps) but they were disappointingly small with only 6 per serving.  I ordered the Jumbo Sea Scallops but they,too, were disappointingly small. And the serving size was 4 scallops.   Management should be told of this egregious misrepresentation and should have been more generous with the portion sizes all around. Shame, Shame, Shame.

I'm not sure if it was decorated for the holidays or if it always looks like that, but wow! Gorgeous lighting and pink, pink, pink everywhere. It was so bright and beautiful and happy -- seriously,  major props!Without hesitation, order the blue pomegranate margarita... one of the best I've ever had, and again, just so darn pretty to look at. I also loved the three different salsa selections that they brought straight to our table! The green salsa was the most flavorful and the heat went up a notch with each one. Our server was always there with refills and it was a nice touch to have the different choices. The house-made guac is also great but make sure to tell them to kick up the heat or it won't be nearly as exciting. You can also choose from three different types -- original. mango, papaya and habanero, jumbo lump crab-chipotle, or a trio of all kinds.I was super boring on this trip and ended up getting the Mexican chopped salad, but it was delicious and full of flavor. It was a decent size and loaded with grilled corn, poblano chiles, apples, pinto beans, green olives, tomato, onion, añejo cheese, crispy tortillas, and toasted cumin vinaigrette.

We decided to go there as I didn't do any research for backup destinations, clearly a rookie mistake. After frequenting the Park Ave location of Dos Caminos a few times for various business meals, I already knew their deal: it's cool for an expense account. The guacamole is their signature item and is a must to order if you come here. You are essentially paying for atmosphere and service. This midtown location has a upscale lounge like vibe downstairs complete with a Macbook DJ playing some early 2000s hip-hop. The service is attentive and will push those $14 margaritas on you. If these were one of a kind margs the price could be excusable, but they are just overpriced and watered down. On this particular instance I had the lobster ceviche and she had the red snapper ceviche. They were actually two of the better items I've had on the menu, however you are served INFANT portions. This was the smallest issued ceviche of all time and might as well been labeled as a tasting menu item. Dos Caminos is for those that might be scared to interact with Mexicans and rather have Manhattanized Mexican food rather than having the real deal.

The service was really good, waiters were attentive and nice. The only other comparable place I can compare it to is Rosa Mexicana, the downtown and mid town location and I have to say overall I prefer Rosa. The Guac was hands down not as good. I like how Rosa is chunkier and they make it in front of you. I just felt like Rosa's had a more interesting taste profile. Appetizer and sides were the Queso Fundido which was basically cheese and chorizos with tortillas. I must say it was the dish that I enjoyed the most, the chorizos was definitely what made it and you scoop it  up with I had the brisket enchiladas. which was okay honestly I was probably too full to taste much by the time the entrees came. I was pigging out on the guac, chip and pico when I got in.  One side dish that was a total failure was the ""cumin"" fries, they were normal shoestring fries with some kind of weak seasoning. Totally not worth it for 5 bucks. Their Blood Orange Margaritas on the rocks were pretty, good. It wasn't get wasted strong but it was a good balance. Dessert was the chocolate cake and pina colada cake.

They had a large outdoor seating area - contrary to the medium-sized one in SoHo and the non-existent one in Union Square. For me, that was a big plus!! If I were to go to any location, it would probably be here and just for their outdoor seating. They also had an extremely large selection of drinks, namely tequila of all varieties. (The selection of tequila was actually so large and appealing that it almost made me wish I liked tequila shots just so I could try it.) Like I mentioned though, the overall is somewhat average. I prefer my go-to mexican place in LI more in terms of food, and I prefer my made-at-home margaritas and guacamole more both for taste and price.

3.0,8/14/2011,"Young urban professionals looking cool were dining outside. Inside by the bar, they were enjoying their meaningful existences and privileged status as members of an upwardly mobile NY class. I was excited to be part of this scene.I was not disappointed when we arrived at our reserved table. We descended an impressive staircase to a cavern of a basement, with high ceilings and an array of stalactite lighting fixtures. Our table was in a nook, set apart from the main area. Meanwhile, music played: the cool beats of a DJed soundtrack that made me feel young, urban, and completely pro.Then I felt unsettled - it was loud, and too eclectic. There was some Cut Copy, then some noise-house-techno, then something to the effect of Journey. And then MGMT, and then remixes, and then other noise that made me not enjoy my guacamole to the degree all young professionals are entitled to.  But the white sangria hit the spot, as did the lime margarita. I was back to feeling successful and urban, chatting with my coworkers. I ordered the ribeye steak, which was edgy because it didn't look like a steak. Instead it was skewered like a kebab, with bits of tomato and small onions. Some sort of cream sauce paired with the rice as a side, effectively guaranteeing that I would be full.

The Cochinita Pibil warned it was spicy enough to warrant a second flaming skull (the most they give)... nope. Barely a hint.

However, this was not the case at Dos Caminos. My friend had reservations for my birthday dinner at 7 o'clock on a Friday night. We were promtly seated once we arrived - which was awesome! Unfortunately, everything went down hill once we were seated. Our waiter acted like he could not be bothered with us (with a built in tip, who would?) and disappeared for most of the night. We had to ASK for water refills. Okay, fine, it's Friday night and it's getting crowded, I'll deal with the horrible service. Then the food started arriving. First the guacamole; for $24, I expected something that was blow my mind good, instead we got a bland green mush of avacado. This was pretty much the prelude for everything that was to follow. The food was bland and dessert took 45 mins to come after they took away out entrees. My friend had also left a cake with the restaurant to ""surprise"" me with after out meal. They were very nice when they brough out the cake but that effort went down the drain when they served everyone tiny slices of the cake! There was still a good quarter of the cake left that they did not return to us - if they had, we would've given it to the staff but because they didn't, I demanded the rest of my cake to take home.

4.0,7/18/2011,"I've eaten her twice and both times were delicious.  I would definitely get the guacamole each and every time.  Honestly probably the largest portion of guacamole I've ever seen in a Mexican restaurant.  The portions for everything else on the menu seem to be a bit on the small side, which is fine. My recommendation is to get a whole bunch of apps and split them with whoever is with you at the time. The margaritas are also on the small side, but are still very potent and flavorful.  They're not watered down or full of ridiculous amounts of sugar like some other margaritas.  My favorite margarita is the Calle Fresca with the ancho salt rim.  The ancho rim is definitely what makes this margarita special and caused me to make it with my glass for the entire dinner.  No need to waste a single drop.  The outside seating is fantastic on a nice day.  It was too much for us to wait the first time, but the second time they told us that there was a 20 minute wait for a table and it turned out to be more like 5 minutes.

Some friends and I went there for restaurant week and nothing but the appetizer was good. We also ordered guacamole and it had no flavor. I have definitely tasted better. None of my party enjoyed their main course, I practically gave mine away because I was so dissastisfied. The dessert was disgusting. The ""flan"" is like soupy pudding from a box.

3.0,7/11/2011,"Mexican cuisine with the NYC twist!We went there on a Sunday evening, and although we had a reservation for a table outside, we still had to wait for 15-20 minutes. Since the evening was so lovely, we sat at the bar for some drinks. Unfortunately, the barman must have just arrived from another planet, because his attitude was just unacceptable. A coke without ice came with icebergs, and when we pointed that out to him, he was like ""Oh no problem. Let me pour it in the drain and give you another. A soda is still $4!"".  And by the way, don't bother asking for drought beers, since they have only bottled ones. Shocked!After our ""caliente"" reception, we sat outside and indeed the place is very nice. The mismatch was the music, which was mainly pop from the 80s. It wasn't that bad, as it recalled lots of memories and initiated exciting discussions. Our waiter was very polite, providing his input on some of our choices. We decided to start with guacamole, ceviche  trio, pork fajitas and beef enchilada. The quacamole was really nice and up to our taste. The accompanied salsas were nice complements, although I wish they were properly identified by the waiter (a mild one ended up being the hottest). However, the ceviche was lost! We waited for like 20 minutes, and we almost forgot about it. Then I brought it to the waiter's attention, who admitted that he didn't add it in the order! It came just a minute prior our main course (an appetizing dessert I guess). All dishes were very nice and unique. They had the traditional element, but the chef was able to bring some exotic flavors with the addition of fruits, veggies and spices. As for the ceviche, it traveled you from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific, with stops in Haiti, Peru and Japan!

3.0,7/4/2011,"3.5 stars. Dos Caminos offers typical upscale Mexican food. Where they excel are with the food quality and friendly service. What could be improved are their high prices and mediocre (and weak) alcoholic drinks. We spent $95 plus tip here for guacamole, two martinis and one beer, an order of tacos, a steak special, and a side of plantains. This was more than some of the nicer restaurants we visited, and not entirely worth the cost. The guacamole appetizer was delicious, but pricey. They don't make it at your table like at similar places. The table gets three salsas to share, and all were quite good. The table also shares black beans and rice, some of the best I've had.My carnitas tacos were quite small and a little bland in flavor. They definitely could have used more cheese. They probably would have been a bit more flavorful if I had added some of that delicious salsa. My hubby's steak special was the better of the two, served on a small sizzling platter with lots of melted cheese, peppers, and onions. He also got a side of really delicious Mexican corn and homemade corn tortillas.The side of plantains was definitely worth the $4.95 charge. They were crispy, thinly sliced, and drizzled with sour cream. Yum!What we really enjoyed was the nice outdoor seating. Although we visited in July, the temps were cool enough for outdoor dining, and the patio was very comfortable.I recommend Dos Caminos, but just expect to pay a bit more than at comparable places.",0,0,0,Andi M.,"Huntersville, NC",84,360,267

Filled up on chips, salsa, and guac before the entrees came, probably to my benefit. The picadillo empanadas was sweet, a little spicy, and kind of tasted like a meat pie in empanada pastry. Note to self - stop ordering fish tacos when not on the West Coast. The mahi mahi tacos were ok but nothing special. Overall the food is fine but it seems to have fallen off from a few years ago when Dos Caminos was a new place and on the cutting edge of new Mexican food.

Dos Caminos was suggested by Lizz K. as a desperate Plan B to accommodate 13 heads. Called them up and they had room for us, scha-wing! That's why Lizz is my homegirl, she's like Michael Jordan...CLUTCH!!!The place was quite big with 2 levels. Decor was hip and shi-shi with quite an awesome Hip-Hop DJ spinning, very unexpected. They have THE Tequila list so if you're a fan, ""1 Tequila 2 Tequila 3 Tequila Floor!"" might be your night. Our server was friendly and helpful, can't complain about him. The guacamole however was a let down, it wasn't mixed well enough so there were patches of salt with each scoop. My boy ordered the Ceviche and he complained it was a tad too limey but I liked it. Our entres however seem to have taken an eternity to arrive which cause us to munch more on tortilla chips than intended. Once everything came we weren't that hungry anymore. I ordered the smoked brisket enchilada which was a small deep dish of layered enchiladas of smoked beef brisket, chihuahua cheese, chiltomate salsa and crema mexicana. It was hearty as all Mexican hell and packed with good flavor. Others however weren't too impressed with their meals.At the end we were just tired from being there for too long so we checked out to begin the debauchery. The bill was actually pretty darn enormous for mediocre Mexican. Again, we weren't impressed. Many more places to experience good Mexican at a fraction of the cost.

4.0,4/15/2011,"I know Dos Caminos is a chain with  four restaurants in NYC, 1 in Vegas, and 1 in Florida. However, it doesn't have the feeling of a chain restaurant. Plus it's more upscale and chic than your normal chain restaurant. My sister and I had dinner at Dos Caminos on a Saturday night when we were in the city visiting. Yes, the prices are a bit high, I will agree with that, but living in DC has made me pretty immune to high food costs. My sister had the blueberry margarita and absolutely loved it. She loved it so much that she had a second one. I had the El Camino margarita which was really good. The fresh lime juice hit the spot after a full day of sightseeing and walking. For food, we had the queso fundido, chicken tacos, and scallops. The queso was good, but it wasn't good for dipping. Plus I felt like we got too few soft tortillas to enjoy with it. My sister really enjoyed the chicken tacos and raved about the seasoning on the chicken. My scallops were good - not the best I have ever had as they did not have that melt in your mouth quality that indicates a perfectly cooked scallop, but still tasty as I ate four of the five that came on my plate. We skipped dessert, but were treated to free frozen margaritas as we were there celebrating my sister's 27th birthday.Service was excellent, especially as our waitress never rushed us and let us linger at the table to enjoy our frozen drinks. The bar area upstairs seemed laid back and was busy all night.

The patio typically overfloweth as does the door with people waiting to be seated. The chips and salsa were great. The chips tasted like they were freshly made as did the salsa that was served amuse bouche style with three different flavors.  Brunch included a prickly pear margarita which was delicious. It reminded me of the same one from one of my all time favorite restaurants in Austin,TX named Manuel's.  We sat on the patio which was surprisingly empty on a nice Sunday afternoon. We ate brunch fare i had salmon and avocado on a cornbread muffin. Amazinly delicious. So it was quiet. Inside looked packed. I had wanted to look around but after the slight margarita buzz i decided to hit the town running. Service was great and quickly. Water and chips and salsa were refilled quickly.  Only two annoying things that voided out he 5th star: On the empty patio they sat another group of 5 people right next to us, in fact, basically on top of us. Also-the most important is that refills on margaritas at BRUNCH TIME on a SUNDAY afternoon were $11. They were good...but i think that should be negotiated a bit.

5.0,3/8/2011,"Dos Caminos. Two Roads: One is Tequila, The other is your soul. They should lead you here. Is it a restaurant? Is it a bar? Let's face it...it's still another place to be seen and be seen. Ok, it's a swanky, upscale chain with locations in NY, NV and FL. It's a chain...Atmosphere: It's restaurant is below and has two bars and the oddly drapped curtains creating a form of intimacy and coziness and trying to be hip. It almost works...i'm sure it's a blast for Valentines. But, the real heart of this place is the mainfloor bar showcasing more Tequila that you can shake a cucharcha at. Not that you want to and that there is any there.But you get my point. Food: After doing a dinner and a brunch, I will say the food is reasonably good. It's hard to compete with places is Mesa Grill and Bar Americain... oh, they both owned by Bobby Flay...Damn you Food Network with your Monopoly-esque stamina of churning out more restaurants than the Mid-East produces oil. Let's be honest...it's tough to compete. The guacamole is fresh, but it's standard. The tres ceviches: Tuna, lobster and red snapper...they were adequate. The Mexico City inspired tacos were decent. The grilled mahi-mahi was fresh and tender. But get a scoop of the Tequila Raisin ice cream...you won't regret this...unless you're lactose intolerant. But your mouth will love you for it. For brunch, the open faced grilled shrimp quesadilla was really great. Light, crisp...perfect for brunch or as great bar food. Ahhh, the bar...let's go upstairs and get our groove on. The bar: Championing over 150 Tequilas...you will find one that works for you. They have Blancos, Resposados, and Anejos of great distinction of really sharp descriptions. There was not one that I had that didn't fit the description properly. But this is not a bar to get wasted my friends. These tequilas is like the ultimate Meet & Greet of your tequila fancy. You can try many, but search...go on..you know you want to field your wild agave. (Side note: Yes, they have beer. Yes, they have margaritas and wine. So, don't worry your little wussy heads they can still take care of you. Till then, pull up your big boy/girl panties, leave the sombero at home and dive in...it's Tequila time)Please note that these are not shooters. These like any fine aged scotch, bourbon, and cognacs. They are to be tasted, coaxed out of the bottle with the promise of a good lime and the tomato based pallete cleanser. No, i'm not going to tell you what I had and I had a lot. Try the flights. Enjoy yourself....this is actually the best venue for that. There is a sobriety to the art of drinking tequila ( no pun intended), but the levels are complex, the flavors are stunning and will leave you feeling that you must come back to experience this.

But when my taco shell came out torn apart even before I touched it, I knew this wasn't my kind of spot.

2.0,12/15/2010,"The only redeeming quality of this place is that the bartender knows how to mix a drink. 2 stars for that....buuuuuuut, what a dismal failure.Our waiter was a money grubbing robot. We stressed that we just wanted drinks but he was sure to bring two food menus over and babble about the guacamole. He then gave us a detailed rundown of the special margarita of the day, which would've been fine had he not given us a long winded rundown of a tequila I was already familiar with and then smugly share that it tastes fantastic with the fresh lime juice and triple sec they use. Not impressed with triple sec as the sweetener in a margarita. Impressed by agave nectar.Then we were inquiring about the price of a margarita with mezcal and he started to explain to us how mezcal tastes and warning us about the smokiness. I truly hate being condescended to and it seems that a server should feel out his customers to see if they have any knowledge about the beverages they are choosing before lecturing them on it. Anyway.So, as much as I didn't want to fall prey to the sleazy menu-leaving trick, my boyfriend suddenly wanted to order ceviche. Generally we get guacamole but I saw that it was 14 fucking dollars, which is the most ridiculous price I've seen anywhere, ever. At that price I'd expect that douche of a server to rub me down from head to toe with soft, ripe avocados for 20 minutes in a back room.So ceviche it was. When ordering I informed our robot friend of a food allergy to soy.The ceviche came...a small bowl of a stinky little pile of pico de gallo with barely any fish in it. No chips. I suppose we were supposed to eat a tiny helping of cut up tomatoes with a spoon?I asked for chips, assuming they'd forgotten them, and the server told us that the chips were cooked in soy oil. Awesome. So basically, he knew that I couldnt eat half of the food we ordered but put the order in anyway, hoping I'd be so stupid and podunk as to shovel the shitty tomato pile specked with fish into my mouth using a spoon.All in all, the server sucked, the food sucked, the place is a trap for tourists and folks who think that paying exorbitant prices means the food is somehow better, and you would be better served staying home and biting into an overly ripe tomato you just rolled around in 3 day old fish.",0,1,1,Sara M.,"New York, NY",115,121,0

Upon requesting an easier table we got a beautiful booth in the middle of the floor yet my group of 5 still felt very private as the metal curtain-y things separated us from other tables.Guacamole: Words Cannot Describe. 5+ stars""I will form a religion around this guacamole"" was what immediately came out of my mouth after I swallowed the first of many guacamole filled tortilla chip.Food: Yumtastic. 5 starsReason: I had a nice lunch so I decided to go with two appetizers. The warm fig salad with bleu cheese and chipotle spiced pecans was warm and sensual. One of the most perfect salads I have ever tasted (especially those warm fresh figs which instantly transported me back to Italy). Then the roasted plaintain empanada's mixed the sweetness of the perfectly roasted plaintains, the lighteness of the dough and the spiciness of the chipotle aioli sauce to give your mouth an explosion of taste.Wine: So Wine Isn't Their Thing. 2 starsReason: My Pinot Grigio tasted crisp and bland. It was a wrong choice on my part as I am more of red wine or Reisling drinker but still, I've had some lovely Pinot Grigios and this particular one was simply not up to par. (However, my friend's Reisling tasted o.k., nothing spectacular but not bad)Extra Services: Above and Beyond. Infinite amount of stars.When I called to make reservations earlier in the day, I mentioned to the hostess that it was my friends birthday and if they could bring some cake or something out, that would be wonderful. After the amazing meal, I completely forgot about that request and we were all ready to ask for the bill and then to my shock, our wonderful server comes out with a HUGE piece of chocolate cake and the best tasting pistacio ice cream I have ever had. Also, it was recently another member of my groups birthdays and as the cake was huge enough, I lied and said it was for them both (Extra points for the save, Dos Caminos).For the least Mexican tasting Mexican food I have ever had, Dos Caminos was the absolute package and if I ever need to impress again, I will be sure to call upon my Two Companions!",2,0,1,Donna F.,"San Francisco, CA",30,154,0

For starters, I do recommend the guacamole that comes with chips and three different salsas. We ordered margaritas (passion fruit and mango each) and we were on to an excellent evening. I had the seafood soup: clams, mussels, oysters, calamari and roasted potatoes in a tomato base. The actual seafood was yummy but the tomato soup portion was too thick and mild. My client had the steak parillada and her food entree presentation was so beautiful and tasty. Her meal came with warm tortillas. The pink velvet cake dessert we ordered was underwhelming and was our least favorite part of what was otherwise a great meal.  Recommend that you make a reservation because the hostesses on both the top and bottom floors made a big deal about it even though there were plenty of tables available.

The hostess accommodated our early arrival with a nice circular booth downstairs. I was very impressed with the ambiance. People dressed as though they were going to a lounge right after and the different colored dim lights set combined with upbeat music set a chic type mood. Very New York. :)Appetizer:Guacamole: a little too rich and almost buttery tasting. I've had better guac in other restaurants or just home-made. Would not order again.House dip: liked this better than the guac because it tasted saltier compared to the sweet buttery taste of the guac. Plus, the green sauce was not spicy.Food: Salmon ceviche: similar to smoked salmon with lemon squeezed over it. Simply okay.Market Vegetable Quesadilla: substituted with a pizza dish which contained mushrooms, shrimp, and way too much butterShrimp/lobster ceviche: Ordered but did not receive, substituted with an enchilada that contained a lot of cheese and squash vegetables.Our waitor was nice. He issued a receipt to us which included the wrong items. Upon telling him, he swapped the order for the items we initially ordered and so we rec'd a reimbursement.The female waitstaff seemed a bit...

True, it was raining, and the house policy is Do Not Seat People When it Rains, However the Customers Already Sitting Are Allowed to Stay.

I wasn't sure what margarita to order, so I asked a few people around us what to get and they said the ""Prickly Pear"" margarita.

I was in the vortex that is trying to find a decent meal in Midtown when I don't spend a lot of time there and I thought this would be fairly safe. Making a good taco is a science, making an ok taco is child's play or so I thought.I should have known there would an issue when I walked in right before noon to an empty restaurant and a girl standing at the front. She said nothing when we walked in and stood right in front of her. And then this:Me: You're open right?Her: Yes. (then extended silence while we still stood there)Me: We want to eat.Her: How many? (there are two of us there and no one else in sight)Me: Two.Her: Okay, right this way.After that however, the service was excellent. The guacamole and chips were top notch and I am very tough on guacamole. It was freshly made, seasoned well and devoid of extra, unnecessary spice. The tray of salsas was also nice with the chips. Although my experience here was very average at best, I would actually go back if I was just planning on drinking beer and eating chips and guacamole all day.I like grilled fish tacos and I saw that they grilled theirs so I was sold. They were second out of four options from least spicy to most spicy on the list so they should have been the second least spicy option for tacos. Possibly if I would have at some point been in an accident, tongue-first and lost all feeling in my tongue and taste buds, these fish tacos would be considered mild. However, I have never been in a tongue-crash and my taste buds work fine and I could not even eat the mess that became this taco tortilla on fire.

(who doesn't smile or greet or move) What is he there for?So we were seated all the way in back and crammed in with everyone else, luckily we got a corner table so at least we had room.Once we were settled in and got our water we got our chips and dipping sauces (best part of the night, that's just SAD).  We put in our order for the guacamole, SPICY, we specified that.  It came out bland, not spicy at all and had some nice staples in it for garnish.  Picked the staples out and decided NOT to throw a hissy fit (should have) but wow...where did those even come from???  Main dishes were overcooked, too salty and just bad.  So it's voted, we're not going back.  It's a nice spot and good for drinks I hear but we were definitely very disappointed with dinner.  Also, it wasn't busy but our waiter was very slow.  Dinner took forever due to waiting to order, waiting for food, waiting to be cleared, waiting for the check, waiter to get the check (we had to wave down a different guy, ours never came back) and getting the card back.Thumbs down.",5,2,2,Caroline V.,"New York, NY",57,507,1081
5.0,1/18/2010,"What a romantic Mexican restaurant. Make sure you get a table downstairs and definitely peruse the menu beforehand. I recommend starting with fresh guacamole and chips. Maybe an appetizer if your really hungry, then i recommend EMPANADAS DE RAJAS Y QUESO, roasted pepper, queso fresco, pasilla de oaxaca salsa. For dinner its all fair game, but probably stick with something neat and not the burritos unless you really don't like your date. The RIBEYE STEAK ALAMBREskewered with applewood smoked bacon, cipollini onions, poblano chilies, arroz con crema and chimichurri sauce was fabulous and definitely had my date reaching over for a taste.

3.0,1/17/2010,"I've been here a few times and I must say it's either a hit or miss.  The clientele that you'll find here are mostly business men & women that work around here (includes me) that are on lunch / dinner meetings.  I don't know how they do it though because almost everytime I come here for dinner, it's really loud.  Lunch is better cause it's a bit quieter, less people.  If you're coming here for a nice romantic dinner with your significant other, you can forget about it.  While the food is good and the fresh guacamole is a plus, if someone asked me where to get good Mexican food, I'd tell them to walk a few blocks down to El Rey de Sabor for amazing, authentic Mexican food.  Dos Caminos is americanized Mexican food; think of it as the higher end TGIFridays Mex Food.Don't get me wrong though, I've always had a good meal here. Their tacos  are delicious; the empanadas are scrumptious (of course my mom's are better); the enchiladas are good, but the prices, in my opinion, cannot be justified.  You're paying more for the ambiance than the food.  To sum it up...as a whole, it's a good place to impress the clients but not your stomach.",0,0,0,Cliff R.,"Fort Collins, CO",18,44,0
3.0,1/1/2010,"Didn't figure as many restos would be closed on New Year's Day as were closed. So on a 30-degree evening, wandering around midtown looking in vain for Mexican food became a wearying, frozen experience. I was ready for anything by the time I got to Dos Caminos, which I thought was also among the closed (this was about 8 p.m.) from its outward appearance. Then I saw a security guy come out for a smoke and figured it had to be open. He confirmed it was when I asked, and I went in for my first Dos Caminos exposure.Another reviewer described DC as more club than restaurant, and I can see the validity of the observation. The music is not loud but is noticeable, and the two sets of heavy curtains you walk through to get in summon comparisons to clubs. At least the lighting was better than at the average club/restaurant (hello, Eatery!).I was seated immediately, and as quickly, my waiter approached and asked if I wanted bottled or tap. Tap was fine, and could I have a Diet Coke, too? Surely, he replied. I opened the menu and saw only one outwardly vegetarian option among the entrees (a veggie quesadilla). When I saw the price of the entree ($18), I buckled in mentally for a $35-before-tip evening, even though I wasn't drinking alcohol or having dessert and wasn't going to have an appetizer. More on that later.I asked if chips and salsa came out automatically, and the waiter said they didn't, that they had to be purchased. I asked how much they were and was told $5. OK, I thought; at least that's $3 cheaper than they were at La Palapa in the East Village. That might be a good sign. Turns out it was.The chips come with three dipping salsas: mild, medium, and spicy. The spicy one isn't immediately spicy; it's got a bit of a delayed kick, but when it does kick in, it's pretty powerful. I liked it and the medium. The mild was too, um, mild. The chips needed only a little bit of salt for my taste, and they were nice and warm and held the salt well (after I asked for a salt shaker--no tables were equipped with either salt or pepper shakers, I noticed). The bowl the chips come in is deep but manageable, unlike La Palapa's massive cornucopia of chips. I have to say, if I must pay for chips and salsa, Dos Caminos's version gives me my money's worth.The quesadilla, which I ordered without mushrooms, looked more like a rectangular blob of lasagna. Even though I was seated (fortunately, as I like to read while eating) directly under a spotlight, it wasn't quite bright enough for me to identify all the ingredients, but I did manage to spy zucchini, carrots, and I think eggplant. I didn't see any cheese, though, which I thought a bit odd. The portion size was adequate. Rice and beans were served on a separate plate, which I thought worked better than having everything on one dish.When I went downstairs to the rest room, I was surprised to see an entire seating area down there. The place is deceptively large. The paper towels are stacked underneath the water controls for the sinks; this results in the towels getting wet while people wash their hands, an unfortunate circumstance. I would rather see the towels in a dispenser or stacked away from the sinks. Aside from that, the bathroom was modern and clean. Service was attentive throughout; either my waiter or another asked me how I was doing and/or refilled my Diet Coke or water and did so without being obtrusive. I did wonder if I was going to see a sex show for the price of dinner when a couple in the fairly dim corner banquette about 10 feet away decided waiting to get back to one of their apartments to get busy was too inconvenient (another similarity to the club environment?). Fortunately, the wait staff seemed to start paying more attention to them when the action got heavy; then a family was seated nearby, and the couple took that as their cue to leave. I was pleasantly surprised when I got the bill to see that I had been charged for only one Diet Coke despite having had two, and that the price was $2.25, not the $3 I had assumed upon seeing the $18 entree price. All told, the bill was $27.50 before tip, which is pricey but not as pricey as it could have been, given the midtown location. I can see myself going back, especially given the proximity to Grand Central, but I do wish there were more veggie options on the menu. A friend of mine who's also vegetarian likes DC and says she often asks if the staff can improvise menu items for her and that the staff obliges, so maybe I will try that.",2,1,1,Pete M.,"Yonkers, NY",38,91,0

Started the meal with the ""famous"" guacamole.  I've got to say this was one of the highlights of my night.  The guac was robust, filling, and delicious.  Creamy smooth avocado mixed intermittently with bite sized pieces of tomato and onion, blended with a slightly spicy (jalapeño?) kick.  It comes out in what looks like a dark ages pestle, and although the price tag is hefty for an app and especially for guac (14$) it is worth its weight in gold.Entrees:  I went with the brazed beef short rib tacos en cazuela.  These were out of this world delicious.  They were served in the ""we provide the stuff, you build it to your liking"" style, which I am a huge fan of.  I rolled up my sleeves and dug in.  The ingredients were fresh, well seasoned, properly cooked, and presently delightfully.  The GF went with the grilled shrimp quesadilla.  This dish was well prepared, but not necessarily my favorite.  The shrimp seemed slightly overdone, possibly sautéed, thrown onto the quesadilla, and then cooked again under the salamander to melt the cheese (Overkill/Overcook).Skipped Dessert per usual.All in all a great Mexican meal, but a bit on the pricey side (90$ total bill) for what we got.  I will be returning as soon as I get the chance.",0,0,0,Jack G.,"Westchester, NY",3,9,0

Guacamole was terrible.  It's hard to go wrong with guac.  I also believe it's hard to go absolutely perfect with guac.  The point is, they went wrong with the guac and for a place that's famous for it, it just really breaks my heart.  Not only the taste, but if the menu describes 'guacamole for 2' then give us at least 2 avocados!! geez... talk about being stingy with the portions.I was here for lunch, so i decided to go with something lighter then usual- the steak salad.  DO NOT GET IT.  It was terrible. I honestly don't remember exactly why, but it just was.  All i remember is the steak was burnt on the outside ( i could taste the burnt grill) and the inside was terribly raw.  AND that I didn't finish it (never happens).My friend had the Carnitas (slow roasted pork tacos).  These were okay.  Not that bad.  But like i said, mediocre.  Can't go wrong with this one.  The best part of my meal was my beer/margarita.  Our waiter told us that in Mexico, pouring beer over frozen margarita was a famous thing to do.  It was a fabulous idea and very very refreshing.  And come on, how could you go wrong with 2 very cold alcoholic drinks mixing together.  That's my idea of awesome blossom.Anyway- overall.. fun environment but over-priced for mediocre food.",3,1,2,Nari L.,"New York, NY",95,50,7

The place was packed on a Tuesday night and people kept coming in the whole time we were there (we arrived at around 8pm). We sat down and our waitress came by asking if we wanted to start with drinks and guacamole, so we ordered some. They do make the guacamole well, although it is a bit pricey IMO. Our waitress was very sweet and offered some insight on the menu, including the extended restaurant week prix-fixe. I already knew what I wanted, so I happily ordered the Mahi-Mahi tacos. The waitress said, ""just so you know that's more of an appetizer so it doesn't come with sides"".  A little let down, I still wanted them and ordered some fried plantains on the side.

4.0,7/20/2009,"How many chihuahua's do you have to milk before you get enough cheese for a quesidilla?Just kidding, chihuahua cheese comes from cows -- no miniature dogs were harmed in the making of Dos Caminos food products.~~~~~~~So this weekend found me in NYC with some girl friends from college. We had all gathered for a mini-reuinion, but more importantly, for an appointment at Kleinfeld's to help one of the girls pick out a dress for her wedding.  However, the girl had done her research and knew exactly what she was looking for, so we were in and out of there in less than hour.  Which meant, of course, more time for exploring the City's countless dining establishments.After lunch at Mark't, fro-yo at Red Mango, milkshakes at The Coffee Shop, and mini-cupcakes at The Cupcake Truck, we rolled into Dos Caminos for dinner.  It was a day full of good decisions.Decor/Ambiance -- Beautiful interior. Lots of mood lighting. Tables are a little close together, but somehow it makes the place feel vibrant rather than crowded. Circular tables are an excellent choice for larger groups, because it allows everyone to face each other and the cross-table distance isn't so large that you can't hear what the other people are saying.Service -- Great service. Very friendly and efficient waitstaff. I know Kevin L. had an issue with the water fillage, but on the night we went, our water glasses were kept constantly full. It was only when we wanted to get our check and roll out that we felt like our main server was a bit scarce.  But, it's hard to hold that against him when he was so nice about bringing out a ""congrats on getting engaged!"" dessert for the lucky lady.Food -- Fresh guacamole, made table-side. Need I say more? The spicy guac might not be as spicy as certain dinners want it to be, but I was A-OK with the spice level in our mild and medium guacs. So fresh, so tasty, so quickly devoured by our table of 8. Also, make sure to try the grilled shrimp quesdillas with chihuahua cheese. It comes to the table looking like a thin crust pizza topped with shrimp, onions and sundried tomatoes, but once you bite into a wedge, you realize it is two very thin, flaky tortillas with yummy, creamy dog-free cheese sandwiched in between. Mmmmm! And be sure to make room for the decadent moussee cake -- rich chocolate-y icing covering cake that is simultaneously fluffy and dense, and luscious mousse holding the layers together. Drinks -- I hate tequila, but Mexican food is synonymous with margaritas, so I just HAD to try one of the many margs offered by Dos Caminos. My frozen Sour Cherry marg was refreshingly original and delicious tangy and boozy. Note: must try the red/white sangria with different tropical fruits -- the pitchers the table next to ours ordered looked incredible!",4,3,3,T H.,"Falls Church, VA",145,151,1
2.0,7/20/2009,"Tried Dos Caminos after not going for several years. From what I remembered, I wasn't wowed by the food when I went when Dos Caminos first opened. When I tried again, not only was I not wowed by the food, the service also failed to impress. We ordered a chicken with no beans and lamb tacos. What came was chicken with beans and short rib tacos. When we finally got the tacos back, they had a very ""lamby"" taste. Nothing that resembled ""tender lamb barbecued with chiles, citrus juice and twelve spices."" To top it off, it came with three lousy small tortillas. Could they have spared a few more? We ordered a margarita. When it didn't come for 15 mins, we asked the waiter about it and he denied that we asked him for it and said possibly we asked someone else. As a regular BR Guest customer, one would expect maybe a manager coming over, an offer for a free drink, dessert, or an apology for the disjointed experience at the end from the waiter. None of the above happened. Our recent experience reaffirmed why I had avoided Dos Caminos for so many years. I see no reason to head back.

I'm just going to compare it to Rosa Mexicano beause it's an upper-scale mexican establishment.  Our waiter and the service was very, very good.  He was friendly, insightful, and offered interesting commentary on some of our choices at the table.  We started off with some guacamole... very good, although the spicy one wasn't as spicy as hoped (we had a spicy and a mild to share with four people).  What I liked about the servings was that the spicy guacamole bowl had more guacamole than the milder one because the waiter noticed three people wanted spicy and only one person wanted mild... our waiter was very attentive.I had the tako/octopus ceviche for dinner.  A friend had some pork tacos, another had tuna ceviche and another had the shrimp qaesadillas.  Can I just say this...THE SHRIMP QUESADILLA IS ONE OF THE MOST DELICIOUS THINGS I HAVE EVER PUT INTO MY MOUTH.  Mushrooms, mushroom oil, a rich cheese, flavorful large shrimp/prawns.  It was like a pizza... so good.The desert chocolate fondue was delicious, and we also ate some chili-chocolate cake (which can be a bit overpowering for some people).  As we ate desert, we sipped on Luna Suena Tequila ($14/glass)... very, very good tequila.  Great recommendation from our waiter.  Overall, enjoyed it.  Downside:  The tortillas are SUB PAR, especially the already unauthentic flour tortilla... they were hard.  We each left with about $65 per person... worth it, I think... great drink, appetizers, and entrees.",0,0,0,Andrew S.,"West Hollywood, CA",739,658,122

The rest of the food i tried at the table was mediocre at best.   If you're in the area and looking for Mexican, do yourself a huge favor and go to Pompano, you wont be disappointing there.On a side note, the service was good and the two experiences i had previous to last night were not as bad, but nothing to rave about either.",0,0,0,john M.,"New York, NY",23,109,0

2.0,2/5/2009,"It's ironic that I ended up at Dos Caminos since I live in walking distance of Dos Caminos SoHo (which I'm not much of a fan of) and I'm pretty sure we passed the general vicinity of Dos Caminos Park during the 60-something block cab ride uptown. This is what happens when you're so hungry you're delirious, you don't have a plan for where to eat and you entrust others to pick a restaurant. Disaster is imminent.We started with the guacamole. I'm still not convinced it's the greatest guacamole ever. I guess because I don't like raw onions and tomatoes and those are essential ingredients in guacamole. I would just rather there be much more avocado than anything else. The chips at this location weren't served warm which was disappointing.I had the Tacos Asada for my entree - 3 small tacos filled with carne asada, caramelized onion, cotija cheese and guac. The best part of the dish was the side of Mexican rice. The meat was tough and chewy. I'm not used to eating well done meat so that may have had something to do with it. I think I give up on fancy Mexican food.Service was slow and our waitress wasn't particularly friendly.

WTH, I don't need anyone doing that for me, let alone following me into the bathroom.On to the food. In a word? Forgetable. Aside from the guac, I didn't taste anything that really stood out. Most recently, I ordered the Ribeye Steak Alambre skewered with applewood smoked bacon, cipollini onions, poblano chilies, arroz con crema and chimichurri sauce. Sounds delicious, right? Well, the steak was overcooked, the bacon waaay too salty and the onions were completely raw! No thanks. My friends ordered the Grilled Shrimp Quesadillas and Pescado Veracruzano which were ok, but nothing to write home about. Our server was most definitely an out of work actor and his over-the-top persona was a bit much for me. Dos Caminos is a casual place, not some pretentious high falutin' brasserie.

Drinks were good as well, although I just had a beer, a nice berry margarita for one in my party and a regular margarita for the other. I saw a lot of pitchers of sangria going around, that looked good, maybe next time.My one negative about the place is the bathroom attendant.  I expect attendants in high end restaurants but not in places like Dos Caminos.  I always feel bad for the guy whose job is to hang out in a bathroom all day and I don't like feeling I have to pay to go to the bathroom.  I do my business and the attendant gives me a huge amount of soap and the slowest trickle of water which would take forever to wash away the soap, so I turn up the water.  Little did I realize that the sink bowl is very shallow and I splashed the attendant and soaked my own shirt sleeve.  Good times!  I still left a dollar for the attendant, but what a pain in the ass.  More often than not, they just get in the way.",1,0,1,Max M.,"Long Island City, NY",116,253,11

Since, the chips were only sub-par - thick and oily. Also, my seared scallop appetizer (perfectly just barely cooked through) was served on a plantain galette that was thick, dense, and oily.

Try the frozen margaritas. The star of the night was the GUACAMOLE. HOLY. WAS IT GOOD.It was amazingly fresh and came with crispy tortilla chips (they give unlimited chips). You can tell they use only the best and freshest ingredients for their guac and it is by far their saving grace in a sea of mediocre entrees. I should probably just skip the entree next time and order myself a big bowl of this green treasure.A bunch of us got the Asada tacos- marinated kobe beef with caramelized onions, cheese and salsas. Although the corn tortillas were fresh and light, the kobe beef was definitely not ""kobe"" quality. It was chewy and nowhere near the tender consistency a ""kobe"" should be. The taco overall was good and flavorful but don't expect very much. $15 will get you three small tacos and not even your own side of salsas (be careful the green one is actually really spicy). The braised short ribs were delicious- the meat so soft that I could barely pick it up with my fork. The ceviche proved to be popular, although again really small portions. Overall, this place is more about presentation than anything else- at least in terms of their entrees/appetizers.Dessert, however, is a different story.We ordered three to share.The Tres Leche cheesecake (three milk strawberry cheesecake), the chocolate mousse cake and the banana split.They were all OUT OF THIS WORLD. If you frequently read my reviews you'll already know I'm not a big dessert fan. But these were AMAZING.The strawberry cheesecake came in a snowy dome. Coconut flakes, white chocolate shaving, mango/strawberry chunks. Oh my. It was soft, creamy and decadent. I hate using such cheesy words such as decadent but there is no other word to describe this delicious treat.The chocolate mousse cake was huge. It was very well made and came with a deliciously refreshing pistachio ice cream. The cake was moist yet crumbly, a consistency I find near impossible to replicate. Like the above, this was creamy but yet lacked the richness of less well-made desserts. Have you ever had one of those fluorescent icing cakes from the supermarket? Well, think the opposite of that. Last but not least, the banana split. It was nutty and crunchy and flanked by two soft bananas halves. No sprinkles dare touch this and also hold the chocolate/caramel syrup. You have yourself a fresh take on an old treat.I probably wouldn't go back too often b/c it was a pretty pricey meal but I definitely would go back for the dessert.

So, we headed to Dos Caminos!My friend suggested it because I was craving chips and guacamole. So, we headed in and we were seated right away. The atmosphere was hip and trendy. The basement of Dos Caminos is this entire lounge/bar/dining area, as well. Apparently, after hours, the basement gets really busy. We dined upstairs and had a great waiter! I wish I remembered his name because he was great and very helpful at planning out our Fourth of July night on the town! We both started with frozen margaritas. They are a bit pricey, but only because they are WICKED strong! But VERY good! We shared tableside guacamole and chips to start. It was the best guacamole I have EVER had! We both had chicken tacos. They had a nice twist with mandarin oranges in the mix. We also each got a side of refried black beans. They were delicious and went perfect with the chips from the appetizer.

2.0,8/16/2008,"terribly over-rated.  it was great the first time and the last time i came for lunch, but it gets so crowded and loud after work and on the weekends and when you have those 2 elements, the service tends to decline as well.  when i do go (and sometimes it's the last resort place since it's about 100 feet from my office), i usually get at least 1 of the following: guac and chips with 3 varieties of salsas (which typically get ignored) or the chicken tacos and the frozen prickly pear margarita or the blueberry pomegranate margarita.  the merlot wasn't too bad either, but still doesn't compare to the one that i'm trying to track down!",1,0,1,Foodie C.,"New York, NY",5,232,32
3.0,8/7/2008,"when i go to dos caminos i'm really only going for 2 things, the guacamole and the margarita.  everything else, is not that memorable.i think people complain about the price since mexican food is not usually expensive, but you're not only paying for the food, but also the ambience, the rent, the food, the staff and it goes on and on ( i shudder to be a restaurant owner, but we need food, don't we).  it is a big restaurant with a big bar, so great for people watching when the bar is buzzing.  the decor is smart and not kitschy mexican and frankly caters to a business crowd being that it is in midtown.  so go for lunch/dinner and expense it if you can.",1,0,0,Karen W.,"Palo Alto, CA",6,153,6
2.0,7/30/2008,"Considering that this restaurant is affiliated with such lovely restaurants as Blue Fin Grill, Atlantic Grill, Ruby Foos... it is such a HUGE disappointment.  The Guac is always too salty.

4.0,7/29/2008,"I originally tried Dos Caminos (Park Avenue location) and didn't like it at all.  This location is far better decorated - I love the ambiance, it's good for a date or a huge friend gathering.  It's hefty on the wallet, for sure, but restaurant week made it deliciously affordable.For $50  (including tax and gratuity) I got::1) Sangria  - a little watered down, but was still good2) Fresh gaucomole with warm chips with just about enough salty taste - you ask for spicy, and its medium, but was still delicious3) Potato croquettes - tasty, totally fatty with queso and an interesting salsa 4) Veg quesadilla (in place of the steak enchilladas I couldn't have as a veggie)- pretty good, and I hate most ""VEG"" quesadillas because there is barely any taste5) Chocolate mousse cake thingy - pretty good, bit alcohol in there but nice with the cherriesThe service was pretty top knotch as well.  I'd go back, but for a special occasion.  Splurging $50 (that too for lunch) was insane.  The gauc costs $12, and the sangria was $8...so 20 more off + restaurant week pre-fix price + tax + gratuity.But hey...it's in Midtown!",1,0,1,Namrata A.,"New York, NY",289,711,24

One of my friends recommended this place because the guacomole was supposed to be delicious....and it certainly was.  The chips were warm and fresh out of the oven. We ordered a bunch of appetizers: grilled vegetable quesadillas, cerviche, plantain empanadas, sweet potatoe fries and mahi mahi tacos and asked that the waitstaff bring it out all at once so we could eat family style. Everything was really delicious and comforting.The place is a bit pricey for Mexican food but it's definitely a place worth checking out....just for the guacomole itself. The ambiance was a bit like a night club with the loud music blaring and it was almost impossible to talk/hear each other...so I took off one star. But add one star if you are going to order drinks because the bar looked pretty good and I'm sure after knocking back a few you won't mind the loudness of the place.",2,0,1,Christine C.,"New York, NY",2,12,1

They take FOREVER, the waiters don't even come to ask if you need anything-you have to track them down by asking other waiters to get them, one time we even got waitress that I could have sworn we were her first clients-she had no clue on anything! The food is pricey for what we got and the drinks are even pricier and not really good! I got the special pomegranite margarita and it was horrible so I ordered the passion fruit margarita and ugh it was even worse. Your better off getting a pitcher of sangria (even though i'm not a big fan of it but whatever). I do must say the guacamole is really really good and that's about it! Be careful of the menu -it's deceiving. My friends ordered the tacos and were the spiciest thing ever. The menu didn't specify they were spicy so when we finally tracked down the waiter he was like ooohhhh the food has spice levels, the lower the plates are placed on the menu that means the hotter they are. Well gee do you think you could have told us before????? Needless to say they couldn't finish it because turns out it was the spiciest thing on the menu.

I love Mexican food and this has some good stuff on the menu, but nothing that stood out or shocked me. I came in to a very packed Saturday night crowd that surprisingly didn't mean we had to wait. But unfortunately this place tries to make as much space as possible so they can get in as many people. That means you are stuck in a table that has diners on each side of you with maybe 1"" of space for each elbow. You feel like you have to whisper when talking or else the guy next to you might join in your conversation. Pretty expensive when compared to most of the Mexican places I have visited around NY.

Of course, the frozen margarita making machine was broken.  The downstairs seating area was much less impressive then the upstairs.  It was brighter and more mundane.  I was also surprised to see pools of still water on the floor... strange and unclean.  Anyway, the guac was definitely good.  My Dos Enchiladas were pretty decent.  One had mole sauce and the other had a sweeter green sauce.  The non-frozen pomegranate margarita was also pretty nice.  Recommended.

Apparently our guacamole wasn't mixed very well, because it wasn't spicy to me at all.  It was only until I had placed my order for the Asada...  I took another chip full of guacamole and found where all the spice was hiding. Needless to say, the Asada came out and was way too spicy for my tastes.  Good thing I got sweet potato fries to counter.  I couldn't eat my tacos, so I asked for a piece of corn and had corn and fries.  The corn was the highlight of my meal.Our service was amazing... the crowd was fun (but it was Cinco de Mayo)... and the drinks were good.  I had fun here.",2,2,2,Nancy C.,"San Jose, CA",162,182,26

2.0,4/21/2008,"Ate here as part of a ""client dinner"" which absolves me of any responsibility for being involved with choosing this restaurant. I really, really appreciated that our server was knowledgeable about which items were vegetarian (the beans, rice, tomatillo sauce) and which were not (mole) and for offering to let me veganize any item on the menu. Again, I totally appreciate it. But $19 for two enchiladas and a side of rice? Even if those were made with tomatillos so fresh I could smell the sun that spawned their growth I would be taken aback by the price. New York = many culinary delights, but those of us born & raised in California or west of the Mississippi (or anywhere formerly part of Aztlan for that matter) know that ""Mexican"" food should not be on the city's food resume. So, very good to know that a vegan can have some edible enchiladas or some guacamole at Dos Caminos  and that the staff is accommodating but unless you're really into pricey mediocrity and dining with the after-work ""gee I wish I was at a VIP club in my 7 jeans"" crowd, I'd skip this place.",1,0,0,M M.,"Ross, CA",3,222,51
4.0,3/31/2008,"On a weekend trip to NYC, after a day of shopping, I was craving a yummy margarita and some Mexican food.  My friend suggested Dos Caminos, and she was spot-on.  We didn't have a reservation, and were meeting another friend there, so they wouldn't seat us till our entire party had arrived.  While we were waiting for our friend, what seemed like a million people came in, so upon our friend's arrival, we had to wait another 10 minutes for our table.Dos Caminos' margaritas definitely hit the spot.  Granted, they were a little on the pricey side ($12-15), but coming from Miami, I was used to that.  I had the Tres Caminos, with blood peach and pink peppercorns - it was delish, with a little bit of a bite to it.  The drinks aren't the biggest in the world, but mine was well worth the price.  I had 2, and definitely could've kept drinking those all night (I wonder if the recipe is in the cookbook they had for sale...).For dinner, we had some of their awesome guacamole.  We ordered it spicy, and I was very thankful that it actually came out with quite a bit of spice to it!  The chips were delish - hot & not-too-greasy.  For our main course, my friend and I split the carnitas tacos and the mexican chopped salad with grilled shrimp.  The tacos were some of the best I've ever had.  The portion was small (3 mini-tacos), but they were stuffed full of melt-in-your-mouth pulled pork.  The salad was very good, and the shrimp were huge.  But I must confess that after I had a few bites of the salad, and a taco, I was pretty stuffed.  I wish I'd had more room to really dig into the salad.Overall, Dos Caminos was yummy - it definitely hit the spot on my craving for delish Mexican food and a fab margarita.  With drinks and guac, it can get a little pricey, but it's totally worth it, in my book!  I will definitely try to hit it again when I'm next in the city.  It also reminds me of Rosa Mexicano - which has expanded down to the Miami area.",1,0,1,Eve C.,"Miami Beach, FL",1313,1006,576

3.0,8/8/2007,"i typically like my mexican restaurants to be inexpensive and traditional.  so, i was none too impressed by their pricey, limited menu.  i actually skipped on dinner and indulged in their spicy guacamole, which, i personally found to be an ass kicker - but ""spicy"" is subjective.however unimpressed by the food i was, their margaritas were definitely their selling point for me.  blended margaritas will do more damage to me the next morning than the night i'm drinking them, usually because of the cheap tequila and the quantity of which i have to drink them to actually get buzzed.  dos caminos spikes their blended with a potent batch of 1800.  2 margaritas - and i'm lit.  never mind their $11 per drink price if i can wake up the next morning without a hangover, it's all worth it.  every damn penny.",1,0,1,rosie l.,"Hollywood Hills, CA",116,161,64
2.0,7/31/2007,"Maybe I'm spoiled since I'm from California, but I was not impressed. I would have given them 3 stars, but I bumped them down, for 3 reasons:1) I'm in a really bitchy mood today2) Dearth of eye candy3) We ordered their medium guac and got a bowl of bland-ass, unseasoned, MUSHED AVOCADO (not even chopped, or cut-up, but mashed, like, big hunks here and there, and then avocado paste everywhere else). That is not guacamole, folks. Then we ordered the 'spicy' (I use that word very loosely) guac, and I was surprised to taste a granule or two of pepper. And yes, the freaking bowls are cute, but what good is a cute bowl if it's heavier than the 90 lb waitress who has to carry it across the room?The tacos were... eh, at best. And who chiffonades radish??? It ruined the whole purpose of the poor radish! (not to mention a waste of time) Also, poorly seasoned.I should cede that the ingredients were very fresh, so kudos for that, but honestly, at those prices, I expected much, much better.Passionfruit mojito was just rum and ice. I've had real passionfruit (in Hawaii, no less) and I did not taste any of it in this drink. For $13 I want to taste some damn passionfruit! I guess I'll have to wait till I get back to the Yay before I enjoy another round of chips and guac. Bummer.",4,6,4,Ahu S.,"New York, NY",122,450,87

The ""dos enchiladas"" weren't bad either, but wow, get the cake.The waitstaff is kind, but our waiter was tough on IDs - my friend's was expired and they wouldn't serve him. The people whom I talked to when I needed to change my reservation time and number of people in our party were very understanding and helpful. We were seated immediately when we got there.I'm trying to hit up all of B.R. Guest's restaurants after I went to Vento and loved it, and Dos Caminos has the same feel. I wouldn't exactly call the decor ""latin"" by any means, but it's a nice place.Oh, and if there's no room at Dos Caminos, just go two doors down to Taco Bell.

3.0,7/26/2007,"This place is obscenely packed after 6pm every work day but so not worth the wait or the price. I've given it a few tries, but my chicken mole enchiladas came out raw the first time, and lukewarm the second time. Everyone has their litmus test for Mexican food (margaritas, perhaps guac) - mine's mole. Speaking of margaritas, theirs are actually quite good and POTENT! So perhaps for drinks, it's worth it, but if you want better food and a much bigger menu in the area, head to Mama Mexico's down the block on 49th.",0,0,0,Beth S.,"Cincinnati, OH",199,14,0
3.0,7/25/2007,"I was here for a work function so I can't really say much about value since I never saw a menu with prices on it.  We had the Grand Cielo room, which is way more glamorous than it sounds - it's basically a loft in the rear of the restaurant.Pluses:-Wait staff kept on bringing the drinks.  The moment we finished with any dish, plates and bowls mystically vanished.-Fresh guacamole that's made right in front of you in a molcajete.  They also have some pretty good salsa that's served in a trio - a cilantro based one and two red chili salsas.  -The serving sizes for entrees are pretty decent - I had the Chilean sea bass dusted with smoky chili powder that I thoroughly enjoyed.  It was flaky, tender, and flavorful.  -For dessert, I ordered the Oaxacan chocolate mousse cake.  Omigod, it was freaking huge!  Served with a scoop of pistachio ice cream, this dessert was off the hook - a huge slice (which even -I- couldn't finish) of chocolate, creamy, fudgy, moist goodness.Minuses:  -I don't think our water ever got refilled.  Not once.-The air was supposedly on, but there was only a trickle of cooler air coming out of the vents.  Management was notified, and we were told that the issue was being worked on.  I think it was maybe two hours into our event that the space up there starting to cool off.-The music was ridiculously loud.  Maybe it's the cool thing in a NYC bar or something.  It made conversation pretty challenging.  Music selection was a hit with most of my coworkers who lived through the '70s and '80s though.-The kicker: a bowl of salsa got spilled all over one of our coworker's suit.  The waiter who flubbed was really apologetic about the situation and brought the manager over, but all that they offered was to pay for the dry cleaning bill.  No comp-ed meal.  No $50 off the ($2k?) bill.  Dry cleaning - what's that, $10?!Overall, I've gotta say that the food at Dos Caminos was pretty good.  The experience as a whole was totally mixed.  I wouldn't say that I'd be back anytime soon -- or ever.",2,1,3,Kevin L.,"New York, NY",1049,1344,4648

3.0,5/29/2007,"We went last Saturday afternoon for lunch. Guac is a must. Creamy, fresh -- all of what guac should be and to be honest I'm not a big guac fan at all. But I may find myself thinking of this guac for some time to come.They had refried black beans which no one touched. Refried and black beans as a combo I'm sure taste delicious. But the idea behind black beans is that they don't have lard in them so that they are better for you. Right? So they put the black beans and the lard together. Strike one.I was curious why the waitress was nibbling at a cupcake ... like she would take a teeny bite and put it on the shelf where the CLEAN glasses were. 1/2 eaten cupcake on a shelf. Ok ... The cupcake was laying there slowly being nibbled at. At some point, the gnarly thing received a plate. It was kinda hunched and tipping over for awhile on the shelf and eventually on a plate on the shelf. Why not mow down the damn cupcake like a normal person? Instead the cupcake was tortured along with the unsuspecting clean glasses and the patrons who would later received those glasses on their tables. Cupcake be damned. Maybe she thought it would have less calories if she ate s l o w l y....Food wasn't bad. I had two enchiladas and each had a different sauce. One was kind of a mole sauce. My plate came with some rice but no beans. I was happy about that. The presentation of  them was a little, um, shall we say off. I say: down with refried black beans.

2.0,5/25/2007,Three people can get better food out of a taco track for about 95 dollars less.The kobe beef on the tacos was woefully overcooked.

3.0,5/17/2007,"WAY WAY WAYYYYYYY overpriced!!  Yes, the guac was amazing and the sangria was okay, but definitely not worth what we put down.  My friend wanted the lobster tacos and every time she goes there they are out of them!!  Do they just put them on the menu to look as fancy as their decor suggests?  Hmm.  Anyway, I got this poblano pepper special, stuffed with shrimp and cheese and some sort of sauce.  It was yummy, but there was like one or two medium-sized shrimp in there...for $25 bucks.  Such a ripoff.  I wouldn't go back for dinner, but maybe to sit at the bar for some margaritas and guacamole.",2,0,1,Michelle L.,"New York, NY",77,214,0

As Idisko said, try the fresh guacamole, it is their specialty and it's AMAZING! I also had the wild mushroom and goat cheese omelet, which was gigantic and melt-in-your-mouth good, and the prickly pear margarita.
