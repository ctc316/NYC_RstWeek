1.0,4/29/2019,"So I will first start out saying that I'm terribly disgusted by this place. Yesterday, I was celebrating my birthday as well as my best friends birthday. We had a 12:30 reservation. I made this reservation a week and a half ago. We called bagatelle TWICE to let them know we will be a little late but to hold our table and that we're coming. We were 18 mins late to be exact. We walked in and inform us that they gave away our table. I have never had this happen to me or anyone that I've known. For a place to be so unapologetic and unprofessional I've never witnessed in my life. They didn't even try to accommodate us. We had 3 people telling us rudely that they couldn't do anything about it. One of which were named Kelly. They were regular hostesses and to not even get a manager that we asked for TWICE to better handle the situation is absurd. I will never recommend this place to anyone. And I will be sure to tell everyone I know, what an unprofessional and repulsive establishment this is.",0,0,0,Daniella D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",151,4,5

1.0,4/15/2019,"The reason I'm giving 1 start is because look like the withers and the bartenders like to do what we call  theoretically overdraft the account you have. This means put more stuff in the check than you consume!  For example! A shot coast 7,99 they charge me 100 dollars for 6 shots for my friends. Is a very busy place and I dicid look to the check in home with more action and after speaking with friend look like they done that in different situations! The place is great, great energy the food and drinks are nothing special but is more a vibe of a club than a restaurant!

1.0,4/7/2019,"My friends and I had the worst experience here yesterday. We had a 12:30 reservation for a table of 9 that was booked TWO weeks in advance. We were running a bit late, but we notified the restaurant and they said it was ok. When we arrived15 mins after reservation) the manager and host was refusing to seat us. They told us they gave our table away (which was reserved for 2 hours) and there were no tables available for us. We had to engage in a back and forth with them to finally be seated. They told us we could sit at a table but only for an hour because another party would come sit there. Before the hour was up they moved us to this TINY table in the back of the restaurant (there were 9 of us). We were literally lap to lap. We ended up just leaving due to the level of disrespect towards us since we arrived. We were DEFF racially profiled, which I wasn't even surprised about due to the nature of the restaurant.

I love cocktails and theirs were a little sweet for my taste(understandably given the normal party crowd that comes through) the bartender was very kind and modified a drink to my tastes. Overall great service. I had the truffle pizza and it was good, but in comparison to other pizzas in nyc it paled in comparison.

4.0,3/24/2019,"I came here due to an invitation to celebrate my friend's birthday. There's 5 of us. A beautiful ambience, perfect for a place to celebrate birthdays but it could get too loud with music and birthday wishes. We ordered something to start with. I had the beet and goat cheese salad. We also had the cheese platter. I tried every piece of it. Not bad. My salad was great too but no greens. The ceviche my friend ordered looked fantastic too. The creativity of each plate is exceptional. Then I ordered the signature dish, truffle chicken. I love truffle so I ordered that. However the sauce was too sweet and I thought didn't do well with the chicken. It was ok. I wouldn't recommend this. I tried a piece of duck that one of our friends ordered and that was pretty good. I recommend this one. Two other friends ordered filet mignon and the birthday girl ordered oyster and a big salad. She didn't feel like having poultry or meat. To be honest, food wise, this place is so-so. Ambience wise, this place is where you want to dine. Service wise, excellent! The place is definitely good for birthdays. Next table had about 20 people with full blast celebration from beginning to end, complete with a photographer.

Make a 2pm reservation for brunch so that you can have a table once the restaurant turns into a ""club.""  The tab for 3 of us came to $450 simply because of the ludicrous mark ups on their bottles of wine.  As much as it killed me to spend so much money on brunch, I will definitely be returning!

Our server Gregory was attentive, fun, and energetic. He answered any questions we had and really amped up our brunch, bringing it to its full potential. He is a star server and is a true example of how great service makes great experiences. The interior is high-class trendy; walking into this establishment you feel important.The food was overall delicious. The breakfast spread ( Insane Decadanse) was unlike anything I've ever seen before. It filled me with so much joy and so many doughnuts. I definitely recommend.We also tasted the Avocado Tartine with Poached Eggs, as well as The Smoker Club (my other favorite.) The Lobster Mac & Cheese was the weakest part of the menu for me. Something about the flavor was off, but it didn't effect my overall experience.Put on your best club outfit and be ready to drop some serious cash here and have insane memories that one can only dream about.5/5",0,0,0,Sarah P.,"New York, NY",404,286,419

2.0,2/8/2019,"My friends and I made a reservation here because we were visiting New York for the weekend and our friend who we were visiting had heard great things about the restaurant. We were carded at the door, which was not a problem because we are all over 21, and walked in to see a very large group of children who appeared to be high school age (?). Our reservation was for 9:30 and we were not seated until 9:50, and then we were not asked for our orders until 10:45. We did not get our food until 11:45. This whole time our waiter was around the restaurant and paying attention to everyone but us. At 12:30 we were waiting for our dessert (which came in a package that the restaurant was offering) and we saw the waiter walking on another waiters shoulders entertaining multiple different groups in the restaurant that were not us. Meanwhile the children are at a table near us dancing on the table. We decided to tip only 10% for this meal, since the service was more than less than exceptional, and the waiter comes back up to our table to tell us that the tip was ""less than the minimum"".

Bagatelle is a MUST when you want to brunch Saturday or Sunday with friends it is oh so fun and never disappoints. Be prepared to drop $$ if you are ordering bottle service, as anywhere in New York, it can be expensive. We started off with a magnum bottle of their Veuve Clicquot and added some peach flavoring to it. We ordered the truffle pizza, lobster mac n cheese, avocado with poached egg, and truffle fries. Everything was delish and the lobster was noticeably fresh! We then ordered two bottles of Dom Perignon for the three of us and it was delivered to us with a guy dressed in a clown costume with the purge alarms sounding - epic. Talk about bottle service!

I felt like I was on set for the new Netflix documentary ""Fyre"", but in this case it's overbooked and no tables available. Hostess finally sat 6 of us at a table for 4. We originally had 8 of us, so when we asked the hostess if that was the table they were going to seat us at with 8 girls she responded with, ""unfortunately I don't know.""

When we sat down, the place was like your average brunch spot. Then around 3, the lights flick off and it gets insane. Edm/dance/pop music starts playing with people getting up and dancing on their chairs. This feels like a club brunch. As for the food, we shared five dishes amongst us and it was more than enough. The two for share pizzas, pancakes, fries and sparkler ice cream desert all tasted great! We also ordered the large margarita with multiple straws to share amongst us. We were content and the bill came out to a little less than 60 per person.

1.0,1/12/2019,"We made reservations to celebrate 2 birthdays for my friend and I. Although we were seated immediately, the table was in the worst possible area. The kitchen area was right next to us and the waiters repeatedly bumped into our chairs. Due to this perpetual discomfort, I ended up with a headache. However, I did not let that ruin our brunch. The waiters were slow to take our orders but we did not think too much of it in the beginning. We were all happy with our dishes. We ordered a variety of dishes. I tried the oeufs bagatelle and the lobster mac and cheese. For the table, we ordered the truffle fries and the large fishbowl drink. The waiters were nice enough to give us a ladle to pour the drink into individual glasses. I do not have any complaints about the food, I genuinely enjoyed it. However, my friends did mention that the sauce was a little bad for the lobster mac and cheese. After enjoying our meal, we wanted to order the beautiful large sundae. This is when our brunch went awry. We asked the waiters to bring our sundae after we, the birthday girls, came back from the restroom. However, the manager/staff member did not appreciate this. It was baffling that they had a problem with us using the restroom (or in their words the toilet which is a vulgar way of describing the restroom). After about 2 minutes of having the sundae on our table, the manager/staff member came over to us with a rude expression asking us to clear the table. I was again baffled at how we, the birthday girls were being treated. I expect to be treated with respect every time as I do the same with anyone I encounter. The manager/staff member then went on to scold us for using the ""toilet,"" in his words. He made a scene and screamed at us for staying over 2 hours. At this point, the sundae was melted and ruined and we were unable to eat/enjoy it. After being treated despicably, I went on to tell the manager/staff member that I understand that we had to clear the table and would do so immediately. I tried to add that we would have appreciated it if he spoke to us in a kind and proper manner. However, when I was trying to speak with him, he repeatedly interrupted me and continued to spew rude comments. He did not apologize for his behavior let alone listen to us. Lastly, when our check came, we were charged for multiple items we did not order. Moreover, they were fine with taking forever with the bill but decided to cause a scene for us overstaying. I loved the ambiance and the food but 1 star because no one should be treated the way we were treated. We tried our best not to let this altercation ruin our birthday celebrations. However, it still ruined our experience, our birthdays, and hurt our feelings. I cannot express how disappointed I am. I would not recommend this place and I do not want to return because the food and the ambiance without the rude and careless service can be found in other places in New York City.",10,0,2,Tasmina A.,"Brooklyn, NY",396,3,45

The food itself wasn't too impressive, the pancakes were decent enough to go around for about three people. The lobster Mac and cheese, good. All around, the food was okay but when it arrived at the table it was warm - not hot. The big drink pictured is a mixed drink enough for the whole table, except they fill it with a bunch of ice. It's cute and has a strobe light, perfect for an insta worthy boomerang. The waiters and staff were my favorite part of this place. They get very involved with the ambiance of the place. The place is also pumping with music and the lights that go on and off during your meal giving you the club dining experience which was cool! After we ate, we paid our bill and headed to the bar which is when the real party started. It was definitely a boozy brunch.

When you enter, everyone is dressed up in the nicest clothes and the place seems very very upscale. Definitely wear a nice dress or something you'd wear to a club to Bagatelle. When I heard NY is known for insane brunches, I had no idea it meant this crazy. Yes you got it, lights lots of lights beaming at you in the dark, a giant human robot with a laser and pressure air blower, air blowers from the bartenders, giant 90oz drinks, bottles and bottles of champagne, men in all various different costumes being carried on the shoulders of someone else to bring you your bottles, drinks being poured down your mouth, dancing on tables and chairs, a very nice bathroom, photo booth, and much more. You will spend lots and lots of money here for table seating at brunch but it is worth trying at least once in your life.TIP: There are very strict on meeting your reservation time and will make you wait over an hour if you miss it by 10 minutes. However, slip a $50/$100 bill to the hostess and you'll get a table in no time.  You're going to spend a solid thousand here anyways, might as well put in a $100 more for a better/quicker seat.  I had a party of 6 people and we each paid about $333 or $2000 total for some delicious food (more than enough to feed us all), 6 bottles of champagne and 2 giant pink drinks that lit up.",4,0,6,Shazeen S.,"Chicago, IL",193,81,140

5.0,12/14/2018,"Take my review with a couple grains of salt: Grain 1 - The last time I went was on a Sunday night. The place was basically all mine. I think only two other parties came through for dinner. So the service was amazing but there was no other option than for it to be amazing. Grain 2 - I've been there for brunch but that was years ago. The day I visited for lunch we actually left before the situation fully leveled up. Anyways, I arrived on Sunday night, about 15 minutes early, for my dinner reservation. I was greeted by both the hostess and a gentleman who would end up being my server. He actually seemed more knowledgeable than the hostess. My companion ended up being an hour and a half late! In which time, I got to know the bartender (who lived in Singapore at one time). I cracked jokes with the server too. Meanwhile, I had two ""Smooth50"" cocktails. It had a citrus taste but I can't remember the ingredients... VERY good though. When my buddy finally arrived, we were seated quickly. The server very politely and understandably let us know that the kitchen was going to close soon. So we sent our orders in, taking account some of his suggestions. We had the Tuna Tartar and Gnocchi appetizers, followed by the blackened Halibut and the Scalloped Ravioli entrees. I thought the Tuna Tartar was better than the Gnocchi but my companion like them the same. We shared a dessert but I don't remember what it was (Don't read too much into that). Afterwards, the chef came out to greet us and see how we liked everything. We of course reported that it was all great. I received a cocktail, on the house towards the end (I think they took pity on my having waited forever for my friend to arrive). It was a nice gesture and earned them that final star. Bottom line: If you've got a free Sunday night, you should go, hang out with the staff for a while and then have dinner. You won't regret it. In fact, you'll try and scheme up excuses to go back.

Of course, when we arrived for our 3PM reservation, we were violently shoved around, ignored, and told to wait at the bar for an hour and a half.

We started by ordering cocktails and my specialy drink (Summertini) arrived tasting awful and salty (supposed to be a sweet drink). I told the waiter who returned it and came back to apologize and say they had used bad pineapple juice. I then ordered a cosmo which was great. We dined early for a Saturday evening (6:30 PM) and ordered appetizers and our entrees as soon as we were seated. After a long while, we finally got our appetizers and then after about half an hour the waiter reappeared to ask us if we wanted dessert. We told him we had not yet had our entrees yet but he proceeded to bring over dessert menus anyway. Finally after two hours of being seated, we were served our entrees which were very good but the whole experience overall was so very disappointing. We asked to speak with the manager, who never made the effort to come to the table but rather sent over a few free drinks instead.

Everything we ordered was either flavorless or basic, could have stopped anywhere to eat. Also they rush you out of your take after two hours. I was extremely uncomfortable and surprised that this could be allowed. My family and friends all felt extremely unwelcomed. My family brought me a cake and since we were rushed out of our table, we had to take it with us to the next spot. However they threw my box out and so they created a cardboard box, this I was offended by but also greatful that they tried since I didn't want to have to carry my cake out without a box.

We tried the pancakes too which were HUGE! You can definitely share that entree for two. The music started at 3 and the curtains were shut and that's when the party began! Dancers came out, people in costumes with bottle service and theme music omg what a blast! Music was great and I honestly think it was the best brunch event ever!

While the brunch menu has some great items, it's not the best food I've had in NYC. However, I would highly recommend getting some carbs in for what turns into a long day of partying. All French cuisine, the food is extremely rich in flavour - which isn't for everyone.Highly recommend the Long Island Ice Tea punch (with the straws - ask!) - it's the best bang for your buck and very generous with alcohol. The Rosé Sangria is also a delicious punch to order as well.Note: When booking reservations for tables, they may tell you that there is a time limit associated.

1.0,5/2/2018,"I visited Bagatelle in New York once before and have visited the one on South Beach in Florida. This last experience is my last and final time. When visiting in February for my daughters 24th birthday I had the worst experience. The food was terrible and the service was horrible. From when we arrived at the restaurant the young lady at the front was rude. I believe it was due to our hispanic appearance, and this trendy place was not having it. I was going to leave, but my girls wanted to stay as we had made these reservations from Miami and they were looking forward to it. I asked to speak to the manager, and he came, we asked about Bottle service and he said after the two hour table limit we would be able to order bottle service, and I said perfect, I asked for the bottle service menu, it was not given to me. We began ordering the food, which was terrible, things came out wrong and basically we had to flag down the waiter because he never came around the table to check up on us. I believe when I visit a restaurant especially one of this $$$$$ I demand and expect exceptional service.  When it came time for the bottle service the waiter came up with a menu of a minimum of $3,000.00 for bottles. This had not been told to me previously. I expected to purchase 2 or 3 bottles, $600-700 each, but, of my choice. I was not told I was expected to buy that amount, specially not when I hadn't been advised of that. And, I specifically had asked for the bottle service menu before. I asked for the manager again, explained the situation, told him it was my daughters bday, explained the horrible service situation, told him we were visiting from out of town. He was also extremely rude. I could have very well stayed, I have no problem with economics. I told my daughter and friends we were leaving, I was not staying where there was no respect, terrible food and awful service, and racial tension. When I paid my bill I did not give any tip, I only gave tip to the poor bus boy, and I gave him $50 cash because he was the only one who merited anything at all. On my bill I wrote ""horrible service"" When I came back to Miami I called American Express to dispute the charge. When they sent my receipt they went so far to cover the part that said ""horrible service"", that is called ""fraud"" covering up their disaster. Luckily I had taken a picture of the receipt before I left the restaurant, and sent it back to Amex. Still dealing with this situation. Bagatelle you are well aware of your terrible service, your bad food and your horrible administration!  Shame on YOU! and I can't believe not a one  Administrative Team Member has reached out! Suggestion, when in NYC don't visit Bagatelle! If you know what good service, and good food is you will realize once you enter the door that you will not find it there.

If you're looking for an upscale wild club like brunch party, this is your spot! The dj comes on at 3, the black out curtains cover the windows, and the party really gets poppin at 430/5. If you're interested in eating, I suggest booking a 2pm reservation so you're finishing by 3 because after that its bottlev service and dancing on couches and you don't want to be trying to eat your French toast while everyone else is taking shots and downing champagne. Great spot for a birthday or special occasion but do be aware that you need to either make a reservation or be a regular. Big groups don't get in after the party starts. This is also the sort of place where you dress to impress. That means no jeans, sneakers, etc. A big group favorite is the punch bowl which I did with a group of friends for a birthday.

But sitting in a near empty restaurant FILLED with servers standing around cracking jokes and chatting at the bar while you wait ages to be given your bill, or a refill on water/coffee is unacceptable. I'm thoroughly convinced that 90% of the workers are paid to sit around and look attractive while the other 10% actually do work.

3.0,3/25/2018,"If you like your brunch rife with flashing red lights, champagne delivery models with heads like the Daft Punk disco balls, and a man banging a drum to the beat of booming dancehall tunes, perhaps Bagatelle is for you. I am not you, if that's the case. But when I went to Bagatelle for a late brunch to celebrate a friend's birthday, most of her crew seemed down with the idea. And by the end of my sixth (?!) glass of champagne -- bankrolled by my friend's generous boss -- I felt like Bagatelle was my kind of place, too. Champagne is a beast of a liquid, squeezed from the horn of Satan itself.Pros: Food! The gnocchi tasted like small dense clouds of flavor and love. The black truffle pizza had just the right amount of rare savoriness, even if it left trickles of grease running down my wrists. (This is New York, though; what would a slice be if not spewing oil from every orifice?) And the shaved Brussels sprouts appetizer tasted like a cross between a handpicked Caesar salad and a wise Italian grandfather's cacio e pepe. Mids: The atmosphere. I'm not sure what to think about Bagatelle. Is it supposed to resemble a circus? Did they film an episode of Real Housewives of the West Village here once? Am I just supposed to experience a mindfreak every time I walk through the front door? I felt a mix between the Copacabana of the early Nineties, a Fergie music video from the late Aughties, and Martin Shkreli's room upon entering. Don't ask me how I came to those conclusions. I just did.Cons: Again, do you like the gates of Hell opening in LED light form as you're trying to eat your lobster mac and cheese? I'm not sure how great of an idea that seems. I mean, sure, by the time you're on Chapter Eight of ""Mimosa: The Reckoning"" or your thirty-fifth sip of ""Strange Red Juice: Seriously, Ronaldo, What's In This Vase?"", you don't mind DJ Doctor Kevorkian screaming into the mic about a delegation from Azerbaijan getting served a magnum of Dom Perignon while the rainbow flashes before your eyes at seizure-inducing speed. Basically, Bagatelle is a b'nai-mitzvah party for wealthy young wanderlust chasers visiting Manhattan for business and pleasure, or for the NYC elite who have decided to throw caution to the wind and spend their rent money on overpriced bottles of bubbling white wine and deafness. To quote a picture hanging above the staircase to the bathrooms: ""WTF is Bagatelle?"" Indeed! Indeed.",0,1,0,William S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,8,0

4.0,3/23/2018,"Bagatelle is a fun experience. My review is quite unique under these circumstances for I planned a bachelorette party here for March, which was in the works from December and contract signed in January with a 50% deposit. Julienne, the event coordinator is great to contact through email. She consistently was in conversation with me and very polite.  To my surprise, two days before the bachelorette party, I was informed that Bagatelle was undergoing construction and it would not be complete by the weekend; therefore, they offered to move to their sister location STK down the way.  I was originally taken back not being notified sooner about the construction for planning this event was stressful enough and now 2 days before the event things were going to be changed. Julienne made it a smooth transition to STK and STK honored the same contract.  Julienne even checked in after the event to ensure everything was good. I was still a little taken back by the short notice, but appreciated her help through these changes and willingness to even look somewhere else if I didn't want STK.  Julienne even booked me a future reservation at Bagatelle for brunch, since she knows I enjoy it there. I am attending in May. Some of my friends coming asked if they will provide anything on the house for the abrupt changes made. I said I didn't ask, but I do hope there is some notation to the staff for a round of rose or champagne on the house or some sort of composition for the last minute changes; however, you can never expect anything except hope its the good time it always is.",0,0,0,Noelle S.,"Heartland Village, NY",123,6,2

2.0,3/13/2018,"I went here for a brunch this past weekend with a group of friends. The food alone is at least 4.5 stars. Everyone at my table ordered something different (i.e. Burger, Gnocchi, Lobster Mac, Crabcakes, Disco Fries). Everything was delicious. The seasoning on the food is God-tier.However... My 2-star rating is strictly based on the service we received. Our 2:30 reservation was made a month prior to us being there. We had to wait an hour and a half to be seated. While we stood (uncomfortably, btw), we kept being pushed around very rudely by someone who I assume was management. As if it was our fault that we had no place to go. One thing about this place that we realized was, they absolutely do not stay true to their reservations, which is very unfair. They overbook, and then refuse to make people leave for other guests who planned to come there. I understand that people spend a large amount of money per table, but its inconsiderate to people who ALSO want to spend money, that are forced to stand for long periods of time, just to be rushed through their meal, so the restaurant can get them out in time to set up for dinner. I don't recommend this place for brunch. There are other restaurants that are way more organized, that will provide you the same exact experience. For dinner, however, I would hope this place has a different attitude, because I genuinely enjoyed the food and would love to have it again.",5,1,1,Jasmin J.,"Yonkers, NY",13,24,4

I did enjoy the visual atmosphere, they were playing an old movie on a projector and the decor was nice. We ordered pizza, risotto, truffle gnocchi, and chicken. Everything was very subpar.

She was a moment behind me, which worked out and prevented more awkwardness.We were seated in the rear area, which was clearly the spot for those there for restaurant week, and not fresh from the runway or between trips to Europe. Crowd was the sterotype you hear about - the euros sniffing derisively at everything, elitist families complaining about their table (especially those seated in viewing distance of us RW rabble, and - ""these tables are square, can we have it ROUND! [yes this was a discussion]), and of course the tables of models. Food was very good, the Scottish salmon was prepped to bring out the specific flavors and textures, tasted just as when I had it in Scotland last year. The Shaved Brussels sprouts were salty but not bad. The tuna tartar was very good. Wine list is extravagant, but I would go all out on a vintage at a place like Tribeca Grill, not here. Desserts were very good. Music was subpar and the artwork tried too hard. Waiters were ok. All in all $120+ for Restaurant Week 'value' and still we felt ripped off and unwelcome.

He made us give a credit card at the beginning and told us they do that because there's people that walk out without paying the bill, however, a card information is needed when you make a reservation so that was unnecessary. Then we order the pitcher of a drink and he said they didn't serve in the cups, that's why they gave us straws, but then again the server for the other table was serving everybody in a cup from the pitcher. Finally when we received the check, we decided to pay the total first and then add the tip, the server was so upset and told me to add the tip right there and I told him ""no, you're making this so complicated"" so he responded ""I do this shit every weekend, you ain't gonna tell me how to do it"" as he was pushing my arm. I requested to speak with the manager and as I was talking to the manager, the server went back to my table to tell my friends ""what's wrong with her?!!!"".  I should've called the police instead because it was my birthday and he put his hands on me.

Sir, you definitely do not deserve 20% of the price of a bottle for just grabbing, uncorking and pouring it in a glass.The fact that he was petty enough to do this really annoyed me but I gave him his measly tip.Also, this establishment provides the calculated tip on your check.

4.0,2/5/2018,"Bagatelle is not the type of restaurant that I typically frequent.  Sure, I enjoy French/Mediterranean cuisine and copious amounts of rosé just as much as the next person, but more often than not, I'm having a 'fat girl' day and I'd prefer *not* to be surrounded by models and their entourage when I'm trying to get my grub on.  Even the employees at Bagatelle are flawless!  Or being sprayed by champagne during one of those infamous weekend 'brunch parties.'  Call me boring, but I'll take my omelette with a side of peace and quiet, thank you very much.  Hold the Hollandaise and the live D.J.  All of that being said, I recently enjoyed dinner at Bagatelle sans a live D.J. set and was seated a good two tables' distance from the next gaggle of young models.  It was quite a pleasant and delicious evening!  My point?  Bagatelle has something for everyone, even your grandparents me!  Just do your homework prior to your visit to make sure you're a) not about to walk in to a party (if that's NOT what you're looking for) or b) lack thereof (if that's NOT what you're looking for).     Tuna TartareWhile most versions of tuna tartare pale in comparison to Chef Jean Georges' famous rendition at Nougatine, Bagatelle's interpretation can stand on its own.  The trifecta of textures - ripe, buttery avocado, crispy and salty taro chips, and cubed pieces of fresh, ruby red-hued tuna - flirt so compatibly with one another that you will find yourself enthusiastically alternating between bites of tuna and taro - tuna and avocado - avocado and taro, etc. - kissed with a sweet and savory soy dressing. Gnocchi à la Parisienne There's gnocchi.  And then there's Parisian gnocchi.  Sounds way more fancy, right?  It is!  If you're familiar with a profiterole, the same dough is used to make Parisian gnocchi: pâte à choux.  Hint, there are no potatoes in the French version of this recipe.     I'm not going to go as far as to say that I prefer the French rendition to the Italian, but damn.  Nothing quite compares to these perfectly-cooked pillows of warm dough that effortlessly envelope the inside of your mouth with such a rich, savory 'carb elixir.'  Paired with a buttery cream sauce infused with a mild hint of truffle, the dish is finished with salty Parmesan cheese.  C'est magnifique!  Apple GalaThis is one of those dishes that, upon arrival, is so visually unexpected and artfully stunning that it takes your breath away.  Quite literally.  And best of all?  It tastes great, too!  I can't quite describe this masterpiece much beyond the notes on the menu: ""Mascarpone mousse, apple filling, white chocolate, sablé Breton, fresh fruit, vanilla ice cream.""  Bottom line: If you're down with apples and willing to shell out $16 for a dessert, then don't even think twice about ordering this Instagram-worthy morsel of edible art.",4,2,3,Lindsay F.,"New York, NY",376,277,184

The waiters are really nice and attentive, even with the hustle and bustle of brunch. But the crowd (try hards) and the music brought down the experience for me... though it is a truly New York experience and something I recommend you try if you're visiting. Plus, the food is GOOD. I ordered the poached eggs with smoked salmon on avocado toast. Was cooked well but could have used a little seasoning or hollandaise sauce. The matcha French toast looked a little unsettling because of all the whipped cream and the green matcha, but it was actually QUITE delicious. Super soft but not undercooked and just flavorful and sweet. I would definitely order it again. The XXL pancake was a little dry, but not bad -- not a traditional pancake --- more of a sweet bread. And the truffle pizza was great. But the music here for Sunday brunch is super redundant (and this could just be my tastes). They play a lot of  EDMish beats with and an MC (though he has a nice voice) chimes in here and there to sing some lyrics and makes shout outs.... felt kind like a bad Bar Mitzvah.",0,1,1,Nadia S.,"Jericho, NY",276,161,1001
2.0,1/27/2018,"I normally don't write reviews but my experience last night at Bagatelle made me adamant about sharing my experience. The food was okay and was the least of our problems. We were seated right away as we did have a reservation. Our table was sandwiched in between 2 large parties, none of which were seated yet. We sit down and begin to look at the menu, then our waiter comes over, doesn't introduce himself or welcome us to the restaurant, all he does is ask if we are ready to order some wine. We said we needed more time so he left, and when he returned again, he asked the same question. No personality and no hospitality at all. He was just a man that showed up with his pad and paper to take orders; I expected more from a place like this. We finally order, the appetizers come out within 10 minutes, and entrées the same. The entrées came out so quick that our second bottle of wine wasn't even at our table until after the entrées were dropped. Way too rushed. Then, the other big parties next to us begin to arrive. One of the parties was larger than anticipated so they had to add more chairs, at this point it was getting a little crowded. One of the staff then came to our round table of 5, and pushed one of the sides of the table in to give that other table more room, while we were more squished. No one asked if that was okay or apologized, they just came in and pushed our table in! Then dessert, we waited more than 20 minutes for dessert!! There must have been a problem in the kitchen but our server did not even come to us saying its going to be delayed. We felt a bit ignored once the big parties began to arrive. Customer service could definitely use some improvement and was extremely disappointing. On the flip side the bussers were great, water glasses always full, table cleared and cleaned, and new silverware put down promptly. Atmosphere was modern and had a trendy young vibe which was nice.

The dj is so talented. He performed saxophone solo that was just absolutely amazing.  The service was slow but the staff was polite and helpful so it made up for this shortcoming. The food was not great. Looks better than it tastes. Do not order the lobster roll- disgusting ......the strawberry margarita bowl is yummy...the crab cake is one ill re order.They perform special shows for tables the purchase bottle service .

It's literally garbage.Service: slow, understaffed. after receiving our menu, the dude came back two minutes later and was not seen again until 10-15 min later, no one asked us once if we were ok (it's loud but it was just the two of us, so it was possible), for each course it took them 20 min to take away our plates- unacceptable. The host of the party- a renowned business owner/celebrity I suppose, had to hand the dishes to the waiter because they were there so long. There was one bus boy that was actually kind and helped with our needs- he had a beard and a foreign accent.Regular menu: painfully overpriced. Prix fixed menu:  We didn't get served dinner until AFTER TEN!!! The party started at 8!!!Tuna tartar was good.My tasteless stripped bass was undercooked- felt like I was eating mush, I told them to cook it more. When it came back out, they put it on a new plate with very very little sauce. Sauce was watery and had no flavor; I could've made better. The sides were the absolute worst part. I'm embarrassed for them. Mine came with two big chunks of onion(?) (WTF) that was so hard to cut and eat. My friend's came with french fries. These dishes already cost an arm and a leg as it is. Don't you think we deserve better side dishes???? And two sides instead of one seems quite fair to me for $55 a plate!! It was $68 with tax and a 15% tip which only the bus boy deserves. CAN YOU FEED US. My bfs Mac and cheese wasn't terrible, but they used a  mini penne pasta. That's not a Mac and cheese noodle. We ordered the creme brulee but they then told us later there was no more. AGAIN, disappointing.Entertainment: Piercing music. It does not have to be that loud!! You couldn't talk to anyone. My throat hurts from screaming. Creepy costumes. There were different colored lights that flashed with the music from the ceiling the whole night.Better not go if you have epilepsy. P.S.

You must come here halfway lit already or you'll have to settle for overpriced drinks that are watered down with a ton of ice. Third- the food was not THAT great. I had a burger and it was really good but I also tasted my friends lobster Mac and it was ehhh I've had better. & finally the vibe was really fun! The music was great & the staff was VERY entertaining. So again if you're looking to have a lit brunch deff come here if you're looking for more of a quiet brunch --stay away. Def think this place can do better in the food & drink area considering the prices, will def comeback for a good time",2,0,0,Priscila R.,"Washington Heights, Manhattan, NY",44,70,179

My friend got mimosa which she happened to loved. Maybe next time we will make reservations , maybe that way the service will be great.

1.0,10/31/2017,"If only 0 stars was an option. This past Sunday we went to this place to celebrated my best friends 28th birthday . she made the reservation over a month ago to ensure we would get a table because as Halloween weekend we know everywhere gets crazy. It was 11 of us for a reservation at 2. They told us 15-20 min. After 45 min we started to get annoyed and went to speak to the Host who from the beginning was very rude . She said to the manager in front of my friend , ""I'm not dealing with this girl"". Shortly after we saw a group of 14 walk in and get seated almost immediately. We complained again and were given one free drink ticket per person . After 2.5 hours of waiting we were finally offered a table but the catch was it only sat 8 people. We were all so hungry at this point we just took the table. Then we asked for a comped bottle and they refused. We barely ate a few appetizers and then left shortly after. We are all native New Yorkers who go out and spend money frequently, we know how the business works. This is one of those places where you have to know someone to have a good time. Unfortunately we didn't have a connection and they made sure we felt uncomfortable. If you are planning to do a brunch party in manhattan save yourself the time and money and book it somewhere else. My suggestion would be Jue Lan Club. Much better service. I WILL NEVER RETURN TO BAGATELLE",4,1,1,Paola Y.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",189,10,0
5.0,10/20/2017,We have heard great stories of Bagatelle and the night did not lack in ambience. The service is top notch from start to end. I had the steak tartar on rice cakes which was a large portion enough to share. The tuna tartar was also a hit with the table. We moved on to the Rack of lamb prepared to medium rare which was absolutely perfect. My husband had the duck with the Asian flair and I like the flavor and it was a large portion that was very meaty. I prefer a fattier cut but for the healthy eater this is perfect. To end we tried three desserts but the favorite for me was a delightful passion fruit cheesecake which was served in a cup and actually had the flavor of cheesecake but much more delicious.  We know the party starts a little later as celebrities rolled in and sparkler filled champagne bottles were being served up. The fun club atmosphere is a must experience in NY.,1,0,0,Mandy E.,"Los Angeles, CA",83,65,455
3.0,10/17/2017,Had a reservation for day brunch on Saturday. As you know it's craziness in here for brunch. They couldn't find it at first but ended up seating us promptly . While the chicken was phenomenal I recommend eating before coming here as the service is extremely slow-more like chasing them to place orders and another 30 mins till you get the order. The only thing quick in this place is the music and dancing. Drink orders are hard to come by as well.

5.0,10/17/2017,"I've dined at Bagatelle several times, but never for Brunch so I didn't really know what I was getting in to. I have to tip my hat to the staff from servers to bouncers to (who I can only imagine was) the floor/general manager. They were on high energy/alert the whole day and ran a tight ship on what could easily turn into a disaster. I saw them discretely escort a lady out of the restaurant who'd clearly had way too much to drink and diffuse the makings of a major testosterone/liquor fueled brawl at a table next to mine without much of a disturbance. Did we have to ask the server a couple of times to bring a drink he forgot? Sure. Did someone spill a drink on my dress? You betcha. But given the crazy club-like environment everything was amazing. If you're an easy-going person, open to rolling with the punches and having a blast, you should experience this brunch at least once. The staff were on point.

4.0,10/1/2017,"I had heard about the amazing brunch at Bagatelle...and finally made it here on a recent Saturday. The place was empty when we came in, but bumping by the time we left - packed, standing room only by the bar, loud music playing, lots and lots of large groups celebrating with giant containers of cocktails with multiple straws. My group was probably the tamest in the whole restaurant and the most under-dressed. Who knew girls would wear sparkly cocktail dresses and louboutins and show up for breakfast on a Saturday am??! It is meatpacking after all - perhaps that's the dress code. Bagatelle's brunch did not disappoint. A few of us ordered the Eggs Bagatelle, which was delicious - smoked salmon, avocado, croissant and came with a side salad. Mimosa was ok. We were sat at a nice circular table and had a pleasant server who was patient with our splitting the bill.

There was a group of 8 of us who came for dinner. We had a reservation so we were seated promptly when we arrived. The restaurant is a bit dark, but classy. The restaurant is definitely pricey  (25-40/entree) but lucky for my wallet we came during restaurant week. Personally, restaurant week can be hit or miss but Bagatelle did a great job. For my 3 courses I had crab salad with fennel and citrus dressing, truffle chicken with roasted root veg and creme brulee for dessert. All were delicious! And the portion sizes (especially the chicken) were good sized. Only reason this is 4 stars is because of staff. We had to wait about 10 mins longer than we would have liked to order, had to ask for bread, and waited some time for a check.And pro tip: if your wine connoisseur friend is choosing the wine for the evening be sure to give them a price point to stay below.

2.0,8/22/2017,"Bagatelle's vibe meets somewhere between Euro tourist trap and Jersey/LI bachelorette party crowd (complete with horrifying tans and skanky outfits - this Jersey boy would know!) and the occasional middle-aged man with an escort. It's an interesting place to people watch - this isn't old money, this isn't new money, this is more ""middle-class but desperate to portray a luxury life on social media"". the same type of people who think riding in UberBlack makes them royalty. On the one hand, the food is actually not bad at all - I went with the beef short rib croissaint and the beef was tender, well-flavored, and served with pretty decent sides. Not the best brunch ever, but if you've done a drunk brunch concept like Il Bastardo, you know the food can be akin to eating out of a trash can. The dining area is super-packed and the tables and chairs stay when they switch out the lights to pretend this is a nightclub. Then I witnessed have the most bizarre gimmick of all time - waiters dressing up in cheap costumes and being carried with sparklers to pour Dom Perignon Vintage into people's mouths and all over their clothes. The gimmicks continued - mediocre saxophonist and drummer, giant ""fishbowl"" style sangria with big colored straws.

As he set the basket down, he asked if we wanted the butter cheese. I asked, ""Does it usually come with cheese?"" He said, ""Yes."" So I asked him to bring it. The bread was amazing! But I thought it was strange that we had to ask for it and again separately for the cheese. Isn't it supposed to be complimentary? I knew from other people's photos that they received it too. Did the restaurant just assume we didn't want any? The Australian Wagyu was average. It wasn't particularly exciting. The best part of the dessert was actually the cookie.

2.0,7/8/2017,So here's the deal with this place.  It's a really nice looking restaurant in a really fun area of the city.  That being said it's food at its best is very mediocre and no where near worth the price. You can get better quiche at your local deli.  My biggest issue and this is partially my fault I admit is the ridiculousness of a $215 cocktail.  Now their cocktails on average ran from $20-$40.  I was reading the menu quickly and saw it as $21.5.  The waiter did come back  to me and asked if I was sure I wanted the cocktail.  Now honestly I assumed he asked me that because of the loud jack hammers and drills going off from the construction across the street and the fact that English was his 2nd or 3rd language. So I assumed he didn't hear/understand me since he also asked several times to repeat our meal order.  When the bill came I asked him about the price and he said well that's why I asked you twice if you wanted that drink. It was a martini that tasted purely of $2 lillet vermouth.  That to me was a cop out because he did not ask if I saw the price of the cocktail or if I read the menu carefully. He just said oh I asked you twice.  Yea you also asked me if I wanted the quiche about 4 times so sorry I thought you just didn't understand or hear me and you rudely interrupted my conversation 3 or 4 times to do it.  Because of his dismissive attitude and arrogance  and the fact that i had no patience to argue with him at that point it will be my last time going there.  However if you chose to go please Read the prices on the drinks first.,0,0,0,Peter F.,"Manhattan, NY",39,83,4

They do not tell you that the pitcher cost $185. If your with a group of people it is worth it because their drinks are expensive and if you buy 3 or 4 drinks it will add up to the amount together. The turn up after 230p is real but please be careful at the bar. We just found out that the waiter at the bar added additional tip. We order another pitcher and the total was 201.42 so I gave him a 5.00 tip and now on my statement is said 221.42. How did that happen? It happen to the 3 of us who were there and brought drinks at the bar. I called and spoke to a Shatima and she said she was going to send me a refund form but I haven't received anything nor spoke to the manager.

1.0,5/18/2017,"I want to preface this by saying I work as a waitress and completely understand how things can be in a restaurant . However we went for my friends gradation  and were very disappointed . Our waiter who said his name was Michael ( it said Gavin on our check ) was nice enough  it very overwhelmed since he has like 8 tables . Our drinks came out 15 minutes and 30 minutes after we ordered . A drink change took another 30 mins by the time the meal was over . The salads came out tasteless with no dressing and it took another 15 mins to get some . Bottom line for a special day we were disappointed , I could have had a better salad at paneara bread . For $160 on the check I would have expected much better service and food . Highly disappointed with the drinks and service . Someone should have comped something on our check for all of the waiting and food mixups , that's called hospitality .",0,0,1,Jaclyn D.,"Wantagh, NY",293,5,2
3.0,5/16/2017,"I've heard most people come here for the party, so it was an interesting first experience for me to come here on a Sunday night (particularly on Mother's Day also). There were only about 5 other tables seated when we went. Lights dimly lit, no crazy DJ or loud disco music spinning around (although they did give us a tease of what the real party is like towards the end of our meal). Surprisingly the dining area is small. It's two stories, the downstairs is fairly big where the bathrooms and kitchen is. The quinoa is yummy, comes with some greens, sliced radish, and a crunchy nut inside which adds some great texture to the quinoa. It tastes fresh, I think because of the citrus that goes into it. The pesto gnocchi is alright. A little too soft for my taste, I like it to have some chew to it. But I also got spoiled from having the best gnocchi throughout Italy so I'm very biased when it comes to this stuff.The burrata tomato salad was HUGELY recommended by our server and I really didn't think much of it??? If I were to describe it, I couldn't really say much more than it tasted like diced up tomatoes with cheese. Your meal comes with these mini baguettes but the melted butter concoction that comes with it is really worth a try. I can't remember what was in it (I wanna say pesto/garlic). (An insider told me the menu needed some work. I also agree.)My favorite plate was the meat dish that came with cod, risotto, vegetables, these AMAZING garlic rosemary potatoes, and two sauces I didn't care much for (didn't think it was needed with how seasoned everything else is). But if you're going to pay $160 for this I'd obviously expect it to be good. The birthday dessert (?) idk what you call it, costs ~$50 and it's an enormous mound of whipped cream, which almost two pints of vanilla and chocolate ice cream underneath. Sprinkled with brownies and a cookie along the rim. Nothing special really, nothing stood out. Again, people probably like to order this because a sparkler comes with it and it's fun? The pistachio, strawberry sorbet dessert also didn't blow me away. The tart that came with it was very hard to chew, kind of tasted stale. Haven't been here for the party, but if they know how to throw a fun time, it would be the perfect overall experience if they could combine that with amazing food!",3,1,1,Hannah C.,"New York, NY",661,433,1109

I would say if you're coming here with a bunch of people and drinking get one of their fish bowls, it deff pays out in the long run.

Only negative for the entire meal was the cheese on the saffron risotto with the prawns. It's unnecessary and honestly ruins the delicious risotto underneath. Maybe try a chili oil on top instead?? The chicken was top notch, the fish, deboned at the table, customer service, and desserts were fabulous. Highlights were: cocktails, creamed spinach, chicken, (half or whole, ordered the half) sautéed veggies that accompanied the fish special, prawns were excellent, and creme brûlée!

My aunt and uncle are regulars at this place so any chance that I am available on a Saturday night I make sure I am right there with them. All of the negative reviews for this place are probably written by people who have never been out before or have never been to a HIGH END and CLASSY place like Bagatelle. The drinks are always on point and if a bartender is telling you they make the mimosas with ""REAL CHAMPAGNE"" I doubt that it is meant to be nasty, this is just the kind of place it is and you have to roll with it, after all, if you want to feel EXCLUSIVE and COOL, you go to BAGATELLE. You just have to kind of dress the part when you come here- ladies, break out the YSL, the Loubs, Chanel, Gucci, all of it because this is where you wear it and THIS is where STYLE and FASHION are appreciated. You will not find another club in the city where people actually dress like they give a fuck about how they look besides Bagatelle, guaranteed. Everyone is dressed to the nines at this place, you will not see a single person who looks like they do not belong.

Despite calling to confirm the reservation, and arriving ten minutes early, we were told by the rude hostess our table was not ready and instructed to wait at the bar. When a member of our party expressed concern as to how the hostess would find us in the large crowd of people, she was met with no response or resolution. The same member of our party continued to check in with the hostess for TWO hours and was met with complete disregard and a nasty attitude. After two hours and countless complaints, a member of our party spoke with an equally rude manager who informed us there was no guarantee that we would be seated at all.

I had to elbow, push, climb over people and avoid a broken glass spill to get to the overpriced bar.

We told the host and she said no problem. She directed us to coat check which is located downstairs and then took us to our seats by 2:30pm. One of our friends ran out to park her car 10 mins away.

Phillip presented the bottle, opened it and poured the first drink in the birthday girl's mouth. We ordered two french toasts, two salads, truffle fries and an eggs Benedict for brunch. We also ordered the big mojito. It was amazing. The food was sooooo good. By the time we were finished eating it was time to partaaaaay. First we ordered the large ""Birthday"" dessert. It came with a sparkling candle, which gave us the birthday boost we were looking for. We started drinking and dancing all over the tables and chairs. Next, we decided that Bagatelle is an experience and it makes no sense to be there if you aren't willing to subscribe to the entire experience and after all we were there to celebrate our friend's 30th Birthday-- soooooo we ordered a bottle. We got our friend an Ace of Spade bottle of champagne which came with a bunch of bottle sparklers and a super hero. The whole management and waiter team came over to party with us. It was an experience we will never forget. Honestly, there aren't enough words in the alphabet to express how being at Bagatelle to celebrate one of my best friend's 30th Birthday made us feel.

We were so excited to come celebrate at bagatelle. We arrived promptly at 2:30 for our reservation and we were told by the rude hostess to wait by the bar until our table was ready. I decided to wait near the hostess station just to make sure they didn't forget about us while my party waited at the bar. Well, I waited there for TWO HOURS. Every 20 mins or so I would very nicely check in with the hostess to see the status of our table. Each time, I was very rudely dismissed and told the table was not ready yet. Sometimes she wouldn't even acknowledge me at all. After standing there for 2 full hours and nearly in tears, I asked to speak with a manager at which point the manager told me there was no way of knowing if we would even be seated at all.

1.0,3/11/2017,"I haven't even gotten to the place yet & they've already left a bad taste in my mouth, I believe customer service in a restaurant is the corner stone of any establishment and it begins with the host(ess)/reservationist, that being said they are off to a bad start. My friend decided to host her birthday brunch here & she initially made a reservation for 8 people, believing reservations are generally flexible & having the common knowledge, as everyone does, that plans can sometimes change. Tonight she received a call confirming her reservation and informed whomever she spoke with that there will be an additional 2 people joining the party, this was met with a rude and an inhospitable response. They informed her that they could not possibly fit 2 more people with her group and she could not change her table count, now I can understand if she had said 4 or more additional people but only 2? We were even comfortable squeezing in. Now I don't see the point in confirming a reservation if you're not prepared for the possibility of a change of plans, in addition to this she is also unable to cancel because she was informed that she would be charged a penalty, keep in mind this is a simple brunch reservation, no contract was drawn up or signed because this is under the minimum amount of people where a brunch becomes an official prefix party, which is something I've never experienced or heard of being charged for a cancellation of a normal reservation, and I've been to many brunch dinners etc where I've never run into this situation. Per se, one of New York's finest restaurants, does not charge you for a change of plans or cancellation but BAGATELLE does?? In short, they have no concept of customer service and do not appreciate your business at all.

The dining room was filled with pretty, dainty chandeliers and impeccably set tables with candles, glassware and Bagatelle's own olive oil jar. We were served mini baguettes with yummy herb flavored butter doused in olive oil. The bread was very good: Fluffy with crunchy outer crust. For my appetizer, I ordered the Gnocchi Truffés à la Parisienne de Nicolas (which was + $4 and worth it). The gnocchi was homemade and came with truffle sauce and parmesan. The gnocchi was perfectly cooked with melt in my mouth buttery consistency. The truffle and pesto sauce was intensely flavorful and plentiful. It was tough trying to decide on the Main Course, but finally selected tue Saumon Grille Suace Aioli a l'Encre de Seiche, which was grilled salmon filet with quinoa and cauliflower, along with squid ink aioli sauce that was artfully dotted and spread on the sides of the plate. I must admit, this entree was plated beautifully, however the portion size was quite small. The filet of salmon was little and there wasn't much quinoa underneath. Also, there was only one piece of cauliflower. The taste of the salmon was wonderful though. I enjoyed the crispiness of the skin, the fresh flavor and how well seasoned it was. The squid ink was also good and had a mayonnaise-like taste to it. Dessert was chocolate mousse with toasted pecans and salted chocolate cookies. It was absolutely delicious! There was a delightful array of chocolate balls, brownie pieces, pecans, biscuits and cookies on top of the rich, creamy, sweet, smooth and decadent dark chocolate mousse. All the ingredients mingled together beautifully. I also got to try some of my friend's sorbet which came with raspberries and blueberries. There were three flavors of sorbet: Raspberry, Mango and Lemon. My favorite was the raspberry, then mango. All very light and refreshing.Our waiter was both charming and handsome, as well as friendly with a great sense of humor. He was knowledgeable about the menu and attended to all our requests effortlessly.

Service was so-so even though the place wasn't packed, but my friend and I received a free shot for some special event they were hosting later that night. A few weeks later, my girlfriends and I had reservations for brunch here to celebrate my birthday. I was well aware that this place turns into a day club after 2pm and was a bit interested in checking it out after eating but it all went downhill after we ordered dessert. After placing our order, I was told by an employee we had to leave in 5 minutes because they needed the table. Oh really? We get our dessert but we don't even have spoons/utensils to eat them with. And he comes by again to remind us of our time limit. UM. Another annoyingly rude part of their service was not even giving their customers the option to stay at the table.

3.0,2/12/2017,"Went to Bagatelle for brunch with some friends on a Sunday recently.  It's a nice room, white tablecloths, nice table settings etc...  I had the Eggs Bagatelle which was two poached eggs over a croissant with smoked salmon and avocado and then topped with a lobster hollandaise sauce.  It was a tasty dish, however, I didn't sense even the slightest taste of lobster in the lobster hollandaise which was a bit disappointing.  Again the dish was good and the smoked salmon flavor was pleasant and not overbearing.The service was very good.  Pleasant and attentive.  For dessert I had a the Vanilla Delight (I think it was called that).  A vanilla tart with vanilla mascarpone and vanilla whipped cream.  Coffee was good too.  Very nice. One negative.  I must comment on my Bloody Mary drink.  For the high quality and price of this restaurant, I feel they should make a better effort for the staple brunch drink.  It was very basic (I watched the bartender make it).  To me, a Bloody Mary is all about the flavor and accoutrements.  This tasted just OK and it was a pretty basic olives on a stick adornment.I would call this place trendy.  Many people were dressed to be seen.  Some looked like they were dressed for (or from) a night out, especially the women.  Tight dresses, lots of side boob. :)  It was ""brunch time"" on a Sunday.  So while some of the outfits were head turning, others were simply amusing.  :) It's an expensive place so be forewarned.  Granted, we did share a bottle of Champagne between three people (it was brunch remember).  The bill was nearly $90 per person, before tip.  I stopped at 3 stars.  If the price was more in line with the food and the Bloody Mary was better,  I'd have given 4 stars.",1,0,0,Stephen B.,"New York, NY",46,282,45

It was not too crowded since lunch had just begun. To begin with, I just saw on their Instagram that Mariah Carey had been there two nights before I came! The decor is very unique, with a range of different blues, whites, and red. The dining room is huge! As well, there is a huge bar that we initially sat at until our table was ready. The food was delicious. We had a variety of options. I am still craving the Truffle Pizza, usually I like thin crust, but it was just so good there that I didn't care that the crust was a little thicker than usual because it worked so well with the truffle. The Ahi Tuna Tartare was delicious - highly recommend it! We also had ceviche, which was very fresh and definitely worth trying, even if you are not a ceviche lover!For my main dish, I had the ""cheeseburger Bagatelle"" which consisted of house blend potato bun, American cheese, truffle mayonnaise and french onion with a side of fries! The truffle mayonnaise was phenomenal. You must get the burger!The service was perfect.

We were pleasantly greeted and every 5 minutes asked if we wanted to be seated.My friend invited me to a dinner that he was treated to and i said hells yeah, i will go.When we collected 4 bodies to sit, we asked to be taken to our table and wait for the rest and they agreed (usually restaurants dont let you sit if the entire party is not there)PS: I can only review the food, service and venue as i was invited and i didn't have to pay.The Decor: chic but weird as it has curse words on paintings around the place. Large bar and huge dinning area. The Food: Since I was invited by a friend i just took in what i was given. Plates just kept coming in and empty ones leaving.We were delighted with so many good plates, the Ahi Tuna Tartare was super delicious. drizzled with what seems a light oil and paired with avocados (im allergic to but still had them). The Truffle Pizza was actually pretty dam good and as one of my friends mentioned ""the french are not know for pizza"" but this was just right on point. It seems that a lot of their dishes contain Truffle and why not who am i to judge. We had what seemed to be fish (halibut) ceviche type of dish and i was a fan of very much. Im really bad with names of things and this is when i should have written it down but i bet someone will remind me (lori can you please).The only plate i was blah about was the pan Roasted chicken, I was just bland to me. Fall off the bone but i was expecting maybe more flavor or a different taste to it. This was also served with Truffle but didn't give me the wow factor that most of the other dishes did.More plates came along but i stayed with the Fish dishes as i'm a seafood lover (see food and i eat it)Desert came along: OMG it was UGE (huge for the rest of us) It was a tower of Ice cream with more ice cream with chocolate and few other sweets that i cant.. just cant. You need to have 6-10 people dig at it, its just too big.The Service: The service was perfect, from the time we arrived to until we left. 3 ladies at the door greeting patrons and french servers always re-filling our waters and bringing us wine. The place got packed for what it seemed to be a french bastille day party and even with this, our service was amazing.I will definitely try to go again, i do see people and the recent lawsuit affecting this place but let me make sure its what people are saying.

4.0,2/5/2017,"I'll say right off the bat that the Yelp pricing for this place is right skewed, meaning that yes, there are $200 cocktails and $1,000 sundaes here, but for most regular entrees, the price is pretty much NYC standard. For brunch you can expect to spend $20-$26 on a single entree. And the portion sizes are big! Not too bad, huh?I ordered the short rib croissant ($25): it comes with some greens (to ease your guilt), a flaky croissant, a sunny side up egg, potatoes, and of course, the star of the meal, juicy, perfectly cooked short rib. We also got a dish reminiscent of poutine to share - fries with cheese, scallions, short rib, bacon, and more with a fried egg as the cherry on top.I've seen some complaints about the service here on Yelp and I can say that in my experience, it was nothing less than amazing. Everyone - from the bartenders, to the waiters, to the bathroom attendant - was very friendly!

There are some really awesome pop art type posters hung and my personal favorite was the Captain America one I was facing. You wouldn't think a pricey French restaurant would be into displaying comic book posters on their walls...further proof as to why we shouldn't judge books by their covers, lol.As an appetizer we ordered (and shared) their Tartare de Thon which was composed of ahi tuna tartare, avocado salad and lime soy taro chips. This tasted super fresh and delicious. This comes in two portion sizes (small and large) and was perfect for 2 people to split.My friend ordered the cod meunière with fingerling potatoes, leek confit and trout roe beurre blanc. I got to try it and whole it was certainly delicious I did feel that the fish was a bit bland...but I also didn't have a ""composed tasting"", I just sampled the fish on its own.I ordered the filet mignon with their aligot. My steak was an 8 oz beef tenderloin cut and it came drizzled with a bordelaise sauce...Bordelaise sauce is a classic French sauce named after the Bordeaux region of France, which is famous for its wine. The sauce is made with dry red wine, bone marrow, butter, shallots and sauce demi-glace (thanks Google!), aligot is basically cheese-filled mashed potatoes from Aubrac. This wasn't my first time having aligot, but it was my first time having it paired with a steak. It was very rich, heavy and decadent...I finished the whole thing though and had to stop myself from licking the copper pan it came in clean.Overall we had an awesome time here. The menu is fantastic, the wine list is excellent (my rose was phenomenal) but I had to take 1 star off for service.

My party came to eat for restaurant week and the portions were a bit smaller than we liked yet that's the average portioning of any dish you would order here. I had the calamari as an appetizer which came on the toasty side but it was edible, followed by the ravioli which were small spinach and goat cheese filled. They were melting in my mouth; heavenly! To be topped off with the assorted sorbet which was delicious because it came with real raspberries and blueberries. And the drinks!!! The Pink Sangria and the Skinny B were very good. The Sangria had a kick and the Skinny B was like drinking a smoothie with a buzz. Originally we were going to order the hurricane which is the large fishbowl but when the waiter told us it was going to be $188 dollars we kindly passed.

4.0,1/27/2017,"Absolutely incredible experience at Bagatelle last night. I have been to Bagatelle Vegas - which is everything! But the NYC location is ever so slightly more everything. Bagatelle has a reputation of snootiness but we did not experience any of that. We had an 8pm reservation via Open Table. We were warmly greeted by the hostess, who said she could seat our partial party after we checked our coats, so we could order cocktails while we waited for the last person. The music, ambiance and atmosphere were classy and mild. No craziness... Yet. That came later. My friend was a little miffed they had no Prosecco or Lambrusco. I get it but this is a French restaurant and those are Italian wines. The drinks we ordered were all awesome, as well they should be for $10,000 each.The food was great but the portions were super small. It's cool, I knew what this was coming in. Think ""Beautiful People portions."" Friend calamari and the truffle gnocchi (omg the best thing!!!)  were great apps. For entrees we had Waygu served perfectly rare, scallops (two measly scallops? For an entree?! Come on...) and lamb shank. I tried the scallops and the beef and they were incredible.At 10pm, the party REALLY started and it was much more of a lounge than a restaurant, though the almost all the patrons were eating. The manager spoke French to me (swoon!) and gave our table a round of champagne.

The fries were your typical fries..  they were good too. My complaint about this place is the service. Our waiter COMPLETELY ignored us during our brunch. He took our order and we never saw him again. My friend and I did notice him partying it up real hard with the group of girls seated next to us. He never even attempted to see if we were ok or if we needed anything else although he was just a few feet away from us. The waiter could careless about us once we ordered because his healthy tip was automatically  included on the bill. I can definitely see why people may think this establishment is a little prejudice. I didn't experience any derogatory treatment other than having extremely terrible service but there is definitely a ""type"" throughout the restaurant.  I would go back if I were invited by friends, but I will never suggest this place to anyone.

4.0,1/18/2017,"I can't comment on any of the ongoing allegations that Bagatelle has been dealt with lately, but what I will note is that when my (culturally diverse) group arrived here for dinner back in November, we had nothing short of a flawless experience with the staff and service. It was my first visit to the restaurant, as they're best known for their weekend brunch, and I have to admit that I left impressed with the quality and execution of their (mostly traditional) French dishes across the board.Coming with a large group meant that we were able to try a variety of dishes offered, including the light Ahi Tuna Tartare, which was served with an Asian-influenced Lime-Soy Vinaigrette, and complemented with a layer of creamy avocado. My preference lies, however, with the heartier starters; the pillow-y Truffle Gnocchi had an addictive black truffle pesto filling, a few slices of shaved black truffle, and maintained a surprisingly soft and fluffy texture and density. Even more impressively presented was the Truffle Pizza, which paired the mild Scarmoza cheese with Crème Fraiche, and finished the top with a generous amount of black truffle shavings.From the main dishes we tried, I would likely recommend that you order the Pan Roasted Chicken over the seafood dishes, if you have to make a choice. It may be entirely due to the fact that seafood is not my protein of preference (after all, I've only been eating it for the past few years...), but the Salmon and Halibut dishes we tried were fairly simply and traditionally prepared, and I found the salmon skin to be less than crisp and more on the soggy end. The Chicken, on the other hand, is impressively served in a large pan, and is whole-roasted with fingerling potatoes and, of course, black truffle shavings. The chicken was cooked to just the right tenderness, and retained both moisture and flavor, and the richness of the black truffle didn't overwhelm the taste. It's an ideal dish for a larger group as well, and was definitely one of the most memorable dishes of the night.Dessert is where Bagatelle really shines, however. The sheer meticulousness present in some of the dishes, like the Chouxchoux Caramel (caramelized miniature hazelnut chou puffs, milk chocolate shavings, and caramel sauce) is amazing, especially in contrast to their signature large format dessert - the ""Birthday"" Sundae. It's not listed on their official menu, but probably doesn't need any additional publicizing, as few haven't heard of (or tried) the mountain of vanilla ice cream, fudge brownies, chocolate chip cookies, chocolate and caramel syrup... and, of course, the finishing sparklers on top. Of course, you don't necessarily need to have a birthday celebration to order it, but I would recommend having upwards of 8 people in your group before attempting to make a stab at it; it's definitely not small nor light, but will completely satisfy any lingering sweet tooth.Don't let Bagatelle's Meatpacking location throw you off; the food here stays true to its French roots despite featuring a few modern touches and we never felt anything less than welcome within its walls.",18,5,13,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827

One friend who ordered scallops said those were great as well. We also got truffle parmesan fries to share for the table and they were great.

We waited for about an hour before being seated around 330PM. Whenever we asked the hostess for an update on how much longer it would be she brushed us off or replied there are people ahead of you waiting. We ordered the whole truffle chicken to share with the table. I ordered the truffle gnocchi, which is one reason I would return here. I also tried the lobster mac and cheese, which was absolutely delicious with lots of chunks of lobster (definitely a plus). The truffle parmesan fries were also very good. I also tried the grilled cheese, which had a lot of flavor and is a dish I would recommend. My boyfriend enjoyed the filet mignon tartare.Brunch was a lot of fun and definitely something I would do again. It was such a fun environment with a mixture of music and entertainment. It would of been ALOT better if we had been seated at our reservation time instead of an hour later when the lights went down. This made it impossible to speak to one another and see what we were eating with the lights constantly flashing hence why we made our reservations at the time we did. Towards the end of brunch there seemed to just be a lot of drunk rude people falling over each other, pushing into everyone without saying excuse me or sorry. The reason for my rating of 4 stars is because of the VERY RUDE hostess/servers. The hostess seemed like she could not be bothered with questions and expected people to just wait around for hours. Our server seemed more interested in partying than paying attention to his tables. When my friend ordered dessert he rolled his eyes and walked away. He never came back to the table to check on us or to see if we needed anything. He was standing on chairs fist pumping and dancing with girls at other tables.

5.0,12/18/2016,"Best place for boozy brunch or dinner in the Meatpacking District!! Always an amazing party for birthdays and celebrations with friends. I had 2 of my birthdays here, and they were the best and most memorable ones. Classy and sophisticated, the atmosphere is super fun, vibrant, electrifying, and full of party vibe. The food is absolutely delicious with picturesque presentations (I have been here enough times to try most of the menu and have yet to be disappointed!), and service staff is thoughtful and attentive. For boozy brunch, the party starts when all curtains close tight, and EDM music and club lights fill the space; it makes your day when you step out of the (dark, sparkler-lit) restaurant into the warm afternoon sunlight, buzzed and tipsy after an intense party brunch. For dinner, it's a dinner/clubbing/dancing hybrid. This restaurant is simply more fun and vibrant than other restaurants (with its former sister restaurant Beaumarchais coming close), and it will always have a special place in my heart! Get the Mega Sundae for birthdays (with a mega sparkler or two); it will make the birthday party! Crown jewel of party restaurants!",0,0,0,Carolyn L.,"New York, NY",78,10,7
1.0,12/18/2016,"If you are you looking for great customer service while spending at least a minimum of $125 pp don't go here. I will first say that the food here is very good. I came here for brunch for my birthday as I heard the brunch is a fun party brunch.As soon as I walked into the establishment I immediately regretted coming here for my birthday.  Upon entering the restaurant the host area had about 5 or 6 staff standing around having a lively conversation amongst themselves.  I stood there for about a minute hoping someone would recognize that I had just walked in and ask me how I can be helped. Instead I had to interrupt them.  The first woman I spoke to I indicated that I had a reservation for my birthday.  She looks and me and tells me to speak to a woman who was standing right next to her. I was put off by the manner in which she passed me off.  My level of annoyance began to increase at that point.I eventually checked in and then I left the host stand to check my coat.  When I returned  to be seated, I again had to interrupt the same group of staff from there conversation to be acknowledged. We eventually were seated by a woman who didn't have the decency to escort us to the table.  Instead she walked ahead of us with a space of at least 5 feet.  When we arrived at the table she handed us our menus and didn't say a word.  We had our meal which was great as I mentioned above.  The last straw was when we received our check, the waiter puts it on the table and immediately says he needs the table.  In other words pay us and get the f*ck out. Lastly, The brunch wasn't fun The party doesn't even start until 3PM.  If you don't have a reservation around 3 PM, don't expect a party. This place is too pricey to receive such crappy service.  This is the worst experience I have ever had in NYC.  I do not recommend this place and I will never go back.",118,5,3,Christmas H.,"New York, NY",205,5,0

It's very expensive so you must be willing to splurge. The gnocchi and French toast are the best! The dessert they bring out for birthdays is enormous and delicious. If you buy a bottle, they bring out very creatively. I've had superman fly it out to us and a Trojan man bring us a bottle once. The music is great and it has a St Tropez vibe. This place gets really wild and people end up dancing on tables and chairs to great beats. The waiters are hilarious and will dance with you.

All delicious with a special mention for the crispy rice tartare. As a main course, we shared their unbelievable truffles roasted chicken for two as well as the fantastic jumbo shrimp dish with pesto risotto. It was perfect.Finally for dessert, we add a puff pastry called chouchou caramel and a pavlova. Couldn't have ended better. A lot of people talk about the loud music but we actually didn't ear it.

5.0,11/27/2016,"I had the pleasure of coming to Bagatelle for a dinner party I was invited to by a friend. We tried a variety of dishes each course, but I'll touch upon those that stood out the most. Now, their pizza (yes the French aren't known for pizza), but their pizza a la truffle noire was TO DIE FOR! A few slices of that paired with their salad and a bit of their tuna tartar will keep you coming back for more each time. Keep in mind that one pizza is good enough to share among a group. For entrees, I had the pleasure of trying several of their seafood dishes along with their truffle roasted chicken with potatoes and gnocchi. I wasn't in a seafood evening that evening so the latter dishes stand out since they were exquisite.I must note that the service and attentional to detail at Bagatelle is exceptional from the moment you walk in. Overall, the entire meal was paired with a nice Malbec, which I was a huge fan of and we ended the night with a huge ice cream sundae.

5.0,10/24/2016,"I recently visited New York and we went here on a Saturday morning with a group of friends. I had SO much fun! It reminded me of a brunch you could have in Las Vegas. We arrived around 11 am for brunch, and they said the reservation is good for about 2 hours. Luckily, they didn't have a reservation immediately after, so they let us stay til about 2pm. During brunch, it was relatively quiet and intimate. As the day went on, it got louder and rowdier, with a full on party with music, DJ, and lights turned off by 3pm. The food itself was DELICIOUS!!! The truffle pizza, French toast, and heirloom tomato salad with goat cheese was my favorite. We ordered a second of the salad and the pizza; all of us were using the sauce in the salad as a drip for our breads. The French toast itself was so moist and fluffy. It just melts in your mouth. They offer the option of adding Nutella on the side for $2 (which is a tiny little ramekin); the French toast was delicious without it, so I wouldn't recommend the nutella for taste or the price. We also ordered the grilled cheese, which was all cheese on the outside and inside. It was good, however I wasn't too impressed with it. My least favorite item was the gnocchi we ordered; I thought it lacked flavor and there wasn't anything unique to it that you couldn't find at a standard Italian restaurant for a much cheaper price. The drinks itself were good - nothing amazing or particularly unique/special. This place is definitely on the pricier end, however worth the food and great atmosphere. The crowd is a mix of young professionals and younger 40-year olds.

The french toast was delicious without the nutella, so I wouldn't spend the extra $2 to order it, especially since it comes as a side.  The reservation was good for 2 hours, so we had to leave our table around 2 (they let us sit there an extra hour).  We were able to hang out by the bar and order more drinks.  It gets a bit crowded around 2-3 since that's when their music party begins, but it's totally worth it.

Also had some Cristal champagne not too bad dry tasting After that the Armand de Brignac Rose pretty good as well.They ended up giving us some shots by the end good, a bit on the sweet side. Food wise First we tried the Pizza a la Truffe , black truffle flat bread is amazing  great tasting with the truffle & cheese. I had the Braise beef short rib croissant , with smoked mozzarella sunny side up egg & roasted potatoes good tasting meat great with the egg & croissant, potatoes not bad. Also tried the Lobster Mac pretty good very cheesy can't really taste any lobster in it, Parmesan truffle fries were very good. Good Steak au Poivre w fries. The Gnocchi Truffe pasta was delicious very nice truffle taste.

5.0,9/1/2016,"Let me preface my review with saying that Bagatelle brunch has been one of my favorite experiences in New York. Ever. When I arrived to join my party at 2 PM, I had no idea the extent of the debauchery that I was going to experience in the next 4 hours. It started out as calmly as any other brunch in the city, a few Moet mimosas and light salads lined our white linen clothed table. However, the ruse of a demure Saturday afternoon soon unraveled when the litany of champagne flutes was replaced by two barrel sized jugs of mojito. As the lights started to dim and the music rose to a club-like cadence, I just stared out in disbelief as the first round of Dom parades came strolling out.If you've never experienced a Bagatelle bottle delivery, you haven't experienced New York. The sheer opulence and fanfare incorporated with their bottle service is a testament to the resilience of the 1% and their ability to spend their maid's annual salary in one brunch. Invoking pre '07 financial crisis fervor, the waiter clad in Napoleon garb riding on the shoulders of the less fortunate waiters hand delivered our bottles with the complementary sparklers that one is oft to receive. Turned out one costumed waiter wasn't enough, so we just ordered more bottles. Our cast ended up including Napoleon, Thor, Superman, and Elvis? I don't remember much after Superman though.All in all, one of the most memorable days I have had so far in New York, unblemished by the fact that I did not have to see the bill to this extravagant afternoon.

I especially enjoyed the open space and those gorgeous chandeliers. As for the food, every single thing that came onto my plate was nothing short of excellent. We had quite an array of options that night - each of them getting better with each course. We started off with a plethora of appetizers (which in my opinion were enough for a meal on its own!) and included their Salade Bagatelle which was a very refreshing start to our meal. The Gnocchi Truffés à la Parisienne de Nicolas as well as the Pizza à la Truffle Noire were absolute standouts. I'm personally a HUGE fan of truffle anything and the flavors in these dishes were just divine. Next was the Seafood tower prestige which included a tower-assortment of oysters, shrimp, lobster, caviar, whitefish, halibut, clams, king crab... the list could go on. I think I've only had caviar once or twice in my life so this was certainly a delicacy. All of the seafood was stellar not to mention very fresh.As for the entrees (I know, so much food!) we all split (I believe this is the one) the Cote de Boeuf Pour Deux and the Filet de Saumon which were both great. At this point I had to seriously pace myself because I was warned that there would be dessert. And indeed there was. Desserts happen to be one of my favorite things - I have a such a sweet tooth, so I was looking forward to something small to end the fantastic meal I've just had. They don't do small here. Out rolls the Mousse Chic Choc, the Caramel Chouchou, the Pavlova Fraises et Vanille (the descriptions are lengthy so I'll let you look those up yourself) and the GIANT Ice Cream Sundae/mountain adorned with sparklers and basically big enough to feed two tables, or even maybe more. When I say I've never been more full in my entire life, I mean it. Every component of my dining experience was wonderful. The quality of the food, the stellar service, the club-like ambiance (when the sun went down - so much fun) and the phenomenal company. My compliments to the staff and the chef. It's truly a meal I'll never forget.",8,2,8,Katie H.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",1239,688,492
4.0,8/3/2016,"We were one of two tables having Monday lunch. Even though they got two of my drinks wrong and we had to ask for water repeatedly, the food was delicious and filling. We could only finish 1/2 of the entrees before we asked to have them wrapped so we could save room for desert. The desert was out of this world. It was a caramel something or other; my mother said it was up there with the best deserts she has ever had. I can't really think of a better one myself.

2.0,8/1/2016,"Warning: Restaurant week review for dinner! Yelp is usually pretty accurate but it seems way off the mark here - though some of my party enjoyed more than others. Food would receive a 3.5 - expensive even at the set menu cost of $42 and not exactly remarkable. Competent octopus, lamb and acceptable mousse. Had I paid full price for these this review would be worse. Service struggles to get a 2 - I'm not sure I've had worse in NYC. This was a quiet Monday night and the main server only seemed to be attending 2 tables yet seemed to, at times, just forget there table existed (aside from serving v expensive bottled water). 2 stars simply because the service seemed incompetent rather than rude. For a restaurant week Monday night the place was empty.

5.0,7/27/2016,"Got the privilege of getting to taste Bagatelle's cuisine for the first time at the James Beard House last week. immediately booked a reservation to come back after, especially with them being part of restaurant week.  Needless to say I wasn't disappointed.  The restaurant is gorgeous, the waitstaff was extremely attentive, the scene was downtown cool and the crowd was gorgeous.  That's before I even had a bite to eat.  The signature cocktails were tasty, especially the summer appropriate Rose Sangria. The meal was a hit with my table of four.  Two indulged in the price fixe menu and feasted on lamb and perfectly cooked scallops respectively. I opted to share a whole fish (a massive snapper to be exact). It was presented, deboned and cut table side and was a standout dish that I'd definitely come back for.  Oh then the desserts, you couldn't forget those if you tried - chocolate mousse, peaches and cream, a nouveau version of a tart, and a salted caramel plate that was to die for perfectly capped off what I'd consider a perfect meal.",0,0,0,Marie A.,"New York, NY",49,137,17

Never once have I been greeted in a restaurant by a hostess labeling customers as rude and disrespectful when they were trying to resolve a minimal issue.

This review is long over due.This was my first time at this location.  I actually like the decor and setup much better at this one as opposed to the original meat packing location.    All around more memorable than my last visit.  The service was excellent.  Our waiter  was very attentive,  but not over bearing.  Now on to the food. I think I taste just about everything on the menu. I don't drink, but I was told the wine was fantastic.  Although everything was well prepared and presented, there were a few dishes that really stood out.I'll start with the seared sea scallop. It was perfectly cooked & I've been disappointed plenty of times with this dish elsewhere.  Fresh, tender, juicy, and full of flavor.  It melted in my mouth like butter. Now onto the black Angus steak bone in ribeye with potatoes. Better than most steakhouses I've been to! Cook to perfection. & with the one in just adds that extra flavor. Next was the seafood tower. 3 tiers of seafood heaven! Tasted like it came straight from the ocean and onto my plate. It had, clams, oysters, king crab legs, jumbo shrimp, lobster, and cavier. Also had a small mix of ceviche in the center of the second tier.Lastly, the dessert. Everything imaginable to quench my sweet tooth. The giant dessert set in a ginormous martini glass. It had brownies,  cookies,  ice cream, and whip cream. I think I ate half of it all by myself, even though it's probably enough for 10 to share,  but I couldn't stop digging into it.  My experience overall was incredible.  Definitely exceeded my expectations.",0,0,0,Susie C.,"Queens, NY",10,275,379

They earned an A+ in my book for food, ambiance, service, and overall experience.

He was spinning a mix of chill dance music, which was perfect to turn up the night a bit, but still allowed me to have a conversation over the music. The manager, John, was incredibly welcoming.

He  made a point to say that the cost was around their other main courses at $40 a portion. The fish tasted bland and was barely edible.  Then the bill comes and it's $120 a portion!

Without checking the wine list l asked our server if they had Sangria, which l doubted as this is a French place.  Our smiling French server who obviously believed we were tourists and easy prey said ""yes"" and we ordered a pitcher to be shared together with some light fare.The Sangria was some kind of watered down cheap red wine with barely no taste, fruit or anything.We did not bother to complain as the food was ok.When the bill came, we were charged $185 for this pitcher and we refused to pay. We called for the manager, which covered the back of her server. Our request call to see the wine list to check their prices was declined. Eventually, the general manager came, which was a very reasonable man who accepted our offer of $50 for the Sangria, plus of course full pay for the food and - guess what - zero in tip.I truly hope that this waiter learned his lesson.

And what an excellent experience it was.  From start to finish, everything was excellent.  We were seated and we asked to move as there was a large plant hanging over us.  No problem.  Moved immediately.  We ordered a bunch of things from the menu and shared around the table.  I have a seafood allergy, so I did not partake in the variety of seafood at the table, especially the shellfish tower.  That said, everyone raved about it.  I did have the truffle gnocchi and a tomato and mozzarella salad.  Both were excellent.  For our mains, we had a bunch of seafood entrees and a bone-in ribeye for two with roasted potatoes.  The steak was amazing as were the potatoes.  For dessert, we had a chocolate mousse, a few other items I can't remember, plus a massive ice cream sundae.  By massive, I mean huge.  It was enough ice cream for 10 people.To top all of it off, the service was excellent.  We were very well taken care of by the staff.  They were there when we needed them, but they were never hovering around the table or trying to rush us through the dinner.  I can't wait to go back!!",8,1,2,Dan C.,"New York, NY",989,942,532

As a newly 23 year old I LOVED IT.PROS: the music selection was great, the atmosphere of the place and of the servers was an all time high and really got you in a party mood. Great tasting mojitos and Nutella French toast.CONS: it was insanely packed like a nightclub dance floor would be and chaotic to get seated. We had to wait a good 15mins when we already had set reservations.  Our waitress was extremely inattentive and rude, so we tipped her accordingly and she had the audacity to come up to us as we were leaving and complain that we were suppose to tip her more and made us feel embarrassed as if we were walking out without paying. We tipped as we felt was appropriate and it was extremely disrespectful to flat out demand we raise it.***WARNING: the lights will shut off around 4pm and it's a full on nightclub at that point (way fun if you've already eaten and are buzzed!)***BEWARE the fishbowls look awesome as heck and they taste great, but they are $185 for one...

I asked the server what I should get- The Salmon, the Wagyu, or the Filet. He told me to go with the Wagyu. It came out and everyone's food looked amazing. It was presented nicely. Mind you this place is not cheap, I expect the ""you get what you pay for situation.""I started cutting it, fine. This first bite was the chewiest steak I've ever eaten in my life. It was actually really hard to swallow. I thought maybe its just the end piece, went to the second sliver, chewier than ever. Honestly I've had better steak at a TGI Fridays and no I'm not exaggerating. My fiance is a huge steak buff, who also got the Wagyu. His boss also got the Wagyu, I leaned over and asked them what they thought. They both HATED it, but being guys they decided to fight through it and not say anything. My fiance's friend almost choked to death. It took the server a really long time to come over to me (everyone else was completely done with their meals)  I ended up telling him I honestly can't eat it. (Which I have NEVER send back food, ever) I told him how chewy it was and he said, yea it's supposed to be. Really haha? No, Wagyu is not supposed to taste like a rawhide dog bone. But this time, being that I am spending a couple hundred dollars in one dinner, I would really enjoy a decent meal so I asked him to take it back. At this point I didn't even want anything anymore, my friend let me try her salmon and that was really good. So they rushed a Salmon out for me, still pretty awkward to have to eat in front of 12 people who have been finished for a while, whatever. I would go back but long story short, don't get ANY Steak.

Yes 12 was set for 11 and was so cramped we said ""we'd pretty much eat in shifts""The hostess was less than understanding in her demeanor and solutioning. Completely unhelpful or cared really We just got another chair and place setting and that took 20 mins to get done. And the we started getting ""service"".When i say we ate in shifts, we initially said it as a frustrated joke but it became a self fulfilling prophecy.When the the appetizers came, 8 of us got ours first and were half way done eating, when two more got their's, and most were done when the last two received theirs. Unsure how the food were fired and spaced out in the back but our poor server who was actually the only saving personnel was doing his best to mask some clear failings and incompetence. Then came the main. Same thing happened which gobsmacked us- cos we thought it certainly couldn't continue 7 first (and the servers kept yelling across the table ""who had the duck?"", ""who ordered potatoes?"") - it was a diner with much less charmAt this point. People had to start eating while others watched againThen 4 more arrived 12 mins later (I timed it) FYI one was a chicken dish which arrives in a sauce pan by design..But took us additional 7 mins to get a dinner plate for our friend to eat his meal The last one they screwed up the gluten free order so that just didn't arrive for another 10 minsAgain we are in shifts!!! And hear meals aren't cheap!! Our saving grace waiter compensated with some champagne to our gluten free friend and profound apology but this night was sunk... Sad ...cos honestly the food is mostly goodOh barring the one person who had fish with bones in it!! And had to send it backIt was taken off the bill... Duh!!!!!!Boy this night was trying Our server - again the one saving grace brought the check and if it is was the custom of the restaurant (I doubt it) or him understanding that the outcome was less then ideal, didn't include the gratuity for the large table. Which was probably a good move We opted as a group to not punish him, the bartender or the bussers for the failings of the front of house or kitchen and additional serving staff incompetence and tipped appropriatelyThen the party began - a little jarring and gimmicky but we knew it was coming. Some got their meal taken away before they were done. But at this point ... No one spilled on us so we call that a win I guessWe didn't want to ruin our friend so we stayed and had one shot and ordered a bottle of champagne when the disco lights came on .. And then soon got the hell outta dodgyNot one time did the front come by and ask about anything.

2.0,4/18/2016,"The reason I'm giving this establishment two stars instead of 0 is because of the hard working servers there that have to deal with the douchebag guest they let in. Aside from one hostess, who was an absolute sweetheart, the rest of the the hostess crew were horrendous, snotty and stuck up. We get it you're all aspiring models and don't plan on being there forever but while you're there at least you can do is be personable.

5.0,4/17/2016,Another great Sunday at Bagatelle. Went here for a little after party with my boys. Always a good time. No issues with entry and people dress to impress. Must say the crowd has changed.

5.0,4/12/2016,"I wondered what I was getting myself into when a friend suggested going to Bagatelle.  As we all know, Bagatelle is known for their wild and crazy brunch day party.  Which I have nothing against, as I'd love to attend the crazy affair myself, but I'm assuming the food would be just good and nothing more.  Boy oh boy was I mistaken.  The food was exceptional and way beyond my expectations!My fav menu items:Apps:Maine diver scallopsAhi tuna tartar with avocado saladMains:Pour Deux 24 oz center cut beef tenderloin, truffle potato purée, red wine and peppercorn saucePizza à la Truffle NoireDesserts:Mousse Chic Choc-72% dark chocolate mousse, toasted pecans, chocolate biscuitChouchou Caramel-Caramelized hazelnut mini choux puff, milk chocolate caramel sauceThe staff were great and very attentive which is always an important factor during a nice meal out.  At one point Chef Sebastien came over to greet us as well.  Nice touch! :)The atmosphere was a mix between relaxed and then a more lively feel. When we arrived at 7:30pm it was fairly calm with low music playing in the background.  At around 9p is when the music level elevated but not to the point where you couldn't hear one another, bottles with lit sparkles were being popped and a few people were dancing in their area.  I really enjoyed the vibe.  It's just the right amount of upbeat atmosphere for a weekday.There are several reasons why I would go back & recommend Bagatelle to a friend.First and foremost it would be for the exceptional food & service.For a special celebration or to treat myself, as the menu prices are on the higher end.For date night when I want to classy it up a bit. To partake in the craziness of the brunch party.Thanks Bagatelle for a wonderful evening! I can't wait to knock your brunch party off my list! :)",4,3,5,Avalyn J.,"Queens, NY",233,172,338

1.0,4/8/2016,"First off I would like to state that if possible I would give this establishment zero stars but that is not an option. I made a reservation on February 5, 2016 for a party of seven for my 24th birthday which is February 20th. A week or so later I called back to edit the reservation and add one guest making for a total of eight people. I then received a confirmation email for my reservation of eight guests on February 20 at 2:30 PM. A week or so before the date of my reservation, I received a phone call to confirm which I had missed and they left me a voicemail. I called back to confirm thinking that if they didn't hear from me they would possibly cancel my reservation. When I called back my reservation was confirmed and everything was set for February 20th. The day came and I arranged a limousine to take my friends and I into the city so that no one would have to drive. We got to the restaurant and were immediately told that there was no reservation for us. While standing outside I called the corporate office, and they confirmed my reservation. The doorman however refused to let us in and kept insisting that our reservation was not there and that they were wrong at the corporate office. I then called the office back and requested to have them speak to the doorman. After walking in the restaurant with my phone, he came out and told me that they agreed with him and that indeed I had no reservation. I got back on the phone and asked them how that could be when I had just called and it was confirmed. After waiting on hold and being hung up on twice someone finally forwarded a copy of the reservation as seen on the computer in the corporate office to my phone. Finally a manager came out whose name escapes my mind, however he was not helpful at all and was actually quite rude. He was not at all accommodating and kept saying there was nothing he could do that the restaurant was at capacity. He told me I had the wrong day and that I was confused and that there was nothing he could do. When I showed him my confirmation email and copy of the reservation from corporate he had nothing to say. When I got home that evening I called corporate to complain. The woman I spoke to on the phone (marisol I believe) apologized multiple times and told me that she would have a manager get back to me, which never happened. I called back three times after the initial phone call to complain and still have not heard a word back. Clearly this is something that must happen often as nobody really cared. After this experience I can say for sure that I will never return to this establishment. In addition all of the women in my party will not be returning as well. We have never felt more embarrassed, being left standing on a street corner all dressed up with nowhere to go. Thankfully the restaurant Revel up the block was very accommodating and went out of their way to make room for my party.",4,0,0,Ashley D.,"Midland Beach, Staten Island, NY",108,1,0

4.0,4/4/2016,"Brunch at Bagatelle is an experience for sure !!!  Came here for a birthday Brunch on Sunday our reservation was at 12.  We got the price fixed option for $75 dollars (does not include drinks).  I thought the food was surpisingly good.. loved the baby kale salad, beef tartare, nutella french toast, ghocchi SO GOOD, eggs benedict - classic, and the steak and fries were also pretty good.  We also ordered the huge watermelon fishbowls for the table to share which was super strong.  Then after our mains were done they came out with the huge sunday to share which was SO GOOD (but I am biased because I do have a huge sweet tooth).   They have a two hour limit on the table so we were out by around 230 but just went to the bar to wait for the club music to start.  Around 3pm they closed the curtains and the party music began.  Everyone was partying, dancing and having a great time. It was a great vibe and club brunch.  We each spent over $220 on brunch which is a BIT pricey in my opinion... so I'm not raging to come back anytime soon but would recommend it as an experience to try in NYC at least once !",2,0,0,Lauren A.,"New York, NY",237,239,442

Also, we had a minor mistake with our cards. I called them and they made sure to take care of it promptly. You don't see that everywhere. The manager called me twice personally and followed through.

5.0,3/2/2016,"Some friends and I recently went to have a wonderful feast on a Thursday evening. At about 7:30 on a cold night right off a cobble stone street in the Meatpacking District I arrived to a warm welcome at Bagatelle. Before I even reached the bar to wait for the rest of my party to arrive I encountered five different employees, all greeting me with huge beautiful bright smiles.The restaurant that happened to be the setting for our evening was what might be considered the birth child of when classy got with hip. Or perhaps a better description, it was the result of when a bunch of undercover hip people, including the staff, showed up at a classy restaurant. This all became very evident, reaching the point of being unmistakable, as soon as I laid eyes on the cool suggestive artwork donned by the walls. Then again, the restaurant might have described itself best, ""...the chic St. Tropez meets Paris."" This place is legendary for its epic party-like brunches, but now can also be touted for its great food with the masterpieces from Chef Sébastien.Once my entire party of 7 arrived we commenced with our communal style meal with appetizers and wine at about 8 pm. We started with salad, grilled octopus, homemade gnocchi, black truffle pizza, ahi tuna tartar, king crab leg, and main diver scallops. Like myself, the entire group enjoyed everything, but I also had a few personal favorites of my own.Grilled Octopus, aka Poulpe Grillé à la Plancha(white bean hummus, crispy Yukon gold, Kalamata olives aioli)...was juicy, tender and flavorful. Suddenly I don't know if I can ever look at Ursula off the Little Mermaid the same way again. Where you may see evil, I see potential, a lot of delicious potential. Whoever thought octopus could taste this good?Homemade Gnocchi, aka Gnocchi Truffés à la Parisienne de Nicolas(black truffle pesto filling, truffle sauce)...was perfectly cooked with an excellent texture and by far the best I have ever had. Thought to originate in the Middle East, whomever first created gnocchi would be very pleased with what has come of it, at least the gnocchi I had.Black Truffle Pizza, aka Pizza à la Truffle Noire(black truffle, flat bread, crème fraiche, scamoza)...was extremely flavorful, decadent in a good way, but also well balanced. To even call something that taste so unique, but still so good 'pizza' seems blasphemous. Yeah, I was lucky enough to have two slices due to everyone else's efforts to King Crab Leg, aka Ceviche de Crabe d'Alaska(king crab leg, habanero & citrus ""leche de tigre"", smoked trout roe)...was remarkable as the sweet flavors of crab danced with acidic citrus and lightly spicy habanero. This was a threesome I am fully willing to stand behind anytime if it looks like this.After our light and not so light apps the more hearty heavy hitters came out. We had whole-truffle chicken, center cut beef tenderloin, and pan seared marinated Hudson Valley duck breast. Of the three I enjoyed the Châteaubriand - Pour Deux best (24 oz center cut beef tenderloin, truffle potato purée, red wine and peppercorn sauce - for two). The truffle potato purée might have been the best mashed potatoes I've ever had. They were thick and richly flavorful. Not really sure what else I should say about them. I will just add this though. Immediately I formed a gripe towards every other establishment I've ever had truffle anything from. Every single thing Chef Sébastien put truffles in or on that we ate was simple amazing. Hell, I didn't even think I cared that much for truffles before Bagatelle. Up until this point I've been cheated of great truffle experiences and someone owes me answers!Next came the desserts. We had Italian meringue crisp, white chocolate tart, dark chocolate mousse, and caramelized hazelnut mini choux puff....drops spoon!!!! The Chouchou Caramel though! Wow! ...caramelized hazelnut mini choux puff and milk chocolate caramel sauce, was incredible! On your visit you should tell your server Sheldon sent you, then ask for it because it isn't on the menu. Okay, that will most likely increase your chances of getting the Chouchou by 0%, but it sounded good. HaHaCenturies after spices and food from around the world was made available to the rest of the world, a mad scientist figured out how to pair these ingredients together perfectly. Chef Sébastien is an evil genius with a life goal of dooming everyone who is fortunate enough to partake in his delicious creations. He wants to doom us to eternal gluttony! I'm convinced of it and can't wait to partake again.",49,29,37,Sheldon S.,"New York, NY",552,189,85

4.0,2/29/2016,"I've been to bagatelle only for brunch so this review is geared only towards brunch and nothing else. I've been to both Saturday and Sunday brunch. Saturday's are INSANE, even more than Sunday's. It is impossible to walk through the crowd without getting something spilled on you or without having to push someone. The party goes from 3, when the lights come down til 7, when they prepare for dinner. Getting in however is a little shaky. The bouncers have favoritism with certain people, trashy if I shall mention, and it may take some time to actually get in. There's champagne everywhere and everyone just having a good time. The bartenders are so fun and Gwyn is fantastic behind that bar. Depending on how much you're willing to spend, you might get your bottle of champ delivered by a superman lol. Sunday's are fun too, at 3 pm lights go down and it's a club, but I feel like most are still drunk from Saturday's so it's not as packed as the previous day. If you're looking for a boozy boozy boozy brunch, then this is the right place.

For such a fancy and pricy place, the food should be elegantly prepared and waiters be professional. This is ""a wanna be"" gourmet restaurant, but is not much more than a bad copy.

1.0,2/21/2016,"My best friend had made reservations one month in advance for Bagatelle brunch on a Saturday afternoon. She was celebrating her 30th birthday. People had flown in from out of state to attend this brunch party. When 11 of us showed up to Bagatelle's front door, the bouncer told my friend we had no reservation. We were all quite surprised being that someone from Bagatelle called my friend to confirm the reservation on Thursday. We even called on the way because we thought we would be late and wanted to make sure that they did not give our table away. So, when we arrived at 2:05 and this bouncer told us we had no reservation, we were shocked to say the least. After a few minutes of arguing with the bouncer, his final statement was, and a I quote, "" Listen, I don't know what to tell you, but it just isn't happening. There's no room"". Mind you... The place wasn't packed, groups of men and even larger parties were being seated as we were standing outside in the freezing cold. Bagatelle is truly a disgrace. Plain and simple.

We got the large truffle gnocchi ($36) and albeit good, there were probably 10 pieces of gnocchi in the whole dish. Tuna tartare was good ($19). Australian wagyu was good but nothing special ($45).

4.0,2/8/2016,"My bestie organized a big girls' brunch for her birthday here on Sunday for ""Club Brunch."" There were 12 of us and we sat down during the first seating at 1230.  It became clear to me that the second seating, which I think is 3pm is what costs $$$ as the blinds close, it gets dark, the attire gets clubbier, and the music starts getting LOUDER.I didn't think it was pretentious in here.  How could it be when honestly when most real New Yorkers don't go here regularly- you'll find older B&T folk, younger B&T folk, foreigners, visitors, bachlorette parties, etc.  And as long as you know that and soak it all in, it is a fun time.  They do play good music and have good drinks. With brunch, I had a really decent Bloody Mary and Irish coffee (funny, they don't pay much attention to you if order coffee sans the alcohol), and the ""Cheeseburger Bagatelle"" which was really meaty but messy.  Came with decent fries (though it didn't list it on the menu, I thought everything was a la carte). Among the other girls, I saw many mimosas, bellinis, eggs benedict, goat cheese frittatas, french toast (looked the best!), and other ad hoc lunch items like the filet mignon tartar and lobster mac.  I would advise sticking with classic brunch items - like anythings eggs or french toast or a burger for lunch.   If you order bottle service, they deliver it via a flying Superman (a waiter in a costume), and a sparkler. They had other cheese plates and the like to share... but we didn't share. We only shared an off the menu ice cream sundae which came with a sparkler and was $55 which could have fed like 30+ people so very reasonable. It was also the yummiest thing I had - whip cream, vanilla/chocolate ice cream, brownie/cookie, granola. Yum.Service is a bit slow/spotty and you had a 2 hour limit on the table before it needs to be turned over for the next group, of which then you can just wait at the bar.  But it's ok, you're there to chill and have fun so no rush.  This is a great place for out of towners and groups, and glad I tried it out.  Can't say I'd be a regular though.  This Club Brunch was better than il Bastardo which we also tried.  I left too early around 3ish but apparently afterward, door service starts and it gets clubbier and clubbier.(P.S. There is a coat check and bathroom lady who gives you paper towels, etc).Brunch was $80 after tax/grat.

We were a party of 6.  We were seated promptly with our reservation.  When we asked for a drink menu we were given a wine list.   Clearly the early expectation was to spend lots of cash and get wasted.  Our server was energetic and decently attentive.  Our meals were average but nothing noteworthy.  I had the Nutella French toast with raspberries.  Thick toast, a tad dry... Nice presentation but nothing to write home about.  The best part of this brunch was the party atmosphere.  There was a DJ playing dance music, getting everyone hype.  The price tag for all of this... Over $100 per person for a simple entree and a few rounds of drinks.  Definitely over priced (in my opinion).  And... We were asked to leave our table after a few hours, unless we purchased a few bottles.  Hmmmmm..... I can say, this place was super packed and popular...

Our group had a lovely time.It is definitely a place for a boozy brunch. There were a ton of single ladies and gents hanging out around the bar on Saturday afternoon.  The only way I can describe Bagatelle's vibe is that its like being in Miami but without the beach.  i.e. Bottle service is normal.  Your brunch will be DJ'd .  The tables around you will be ordering extremely large cocktails to share--and 1.5, 3, 6 liters of champagne.The food was great for brunch fare.Our group ordered the following:Traditional Eggs BenedictAsparagus and Feta Frittata  (you can opt for egg whites like I did)Braised Rib Crossiant LatteMimosasEveryone enjoyed their dishes.  The service was attentive and top notch.  P.S.

We had a nice buzz by then and when the rest of the girls got there, we were ready to eat. The food was very good and tasty. My friends got the nutella French toast and pancakes and other sweet items while I opted for a veggie omelet with goat cheese. We shared everything and it was great. By now, it was getting a bit crowded and they were getting ready to get the party started. The one negative for the afternoon was after we had our meal, the waiter kept rushing us from the table so that he could seat another group. We called him out on it though, and he bought us a round of drinks. The party was a lot of fun, curtains were put down and it got totally dark. Lots of craziness.

5.0,12/18/2015,"I was invited to Bagatelle for a sit down dinner event.When I think of Bagatelle, I think of the brunch parties they have there. For that reason, I was skeptical. However, I was told that they have a great menu for dinner and that I would be surprised.So I went.  There was a DJ playing music.  However, it was not so loud that the group could not have conversations.  Our party of five sat for dinner.  The appetizers were shockingly good.In particular, the scallop was good. However the crab salad was like a ceviche.  It was really phenomenal.  The octopus was great as well.  However the crab was pretty memorable.The ahi tuna tartare was a nice size and was tasty.  The truffle pizza was really different and had a great taste to it.The Chou Frise was a Kale Salad with dried cranberries, ricotta cheese, pickeled shallots & lemon & Jean Evo.  This is a nice way of saying it was some Kale and Cheese. Nothing to go crazy about at all.The truffled roasted chicken was way juicier than I expected and had a good taste to it.The bone in ribeye steak was perfectly cooked and tasty.  The Gnocchi was very good.Where Bagatelle shines and is probably one of the most under rated restaurants in the City is for dessert. One Dessert. The Ice Cream Sundae.The Huge Sundae they serve is pretty amazing.  It comes out with sparklers and its own show.  It is a great birthday cake replacement.  It can feed lots of people.  It puts traditionally popular places like the popular ice cream/hot chocolate/sundae spot in midtown that I will not name to shame. Bagatelle is more than capable of competing for best group ice cream spot. If ever flying bottles of Dom P. in via superman and sparklers does not work out for them, they would still crush most of the birthday crowd with just this sundae.  It is massive.I also saw some groups nearby eating and drinking Dom P., each bottle being delivered with fanfare. Superman was carried by some men while flying one in.  Apollo Creed seemed to deliver another one as if he was entering the ring.  It seemed like the customers were happy.  However, it was the food on my table that had me there, and the food on my table that surprised me.  Before this week, I would never have considered Bagatelle for a ""grown folks"" dinner.  My opinion has changed.Bagatelle, the home of the amazing large sundae that your whole party probably won't finish.  That is my review.  It is one of the best kept secrets in the city.",5,3,5,Jamel O.,"Jackson Heights, NY",2620,919,215

I got to try many of the appetizers like kale salad, tuna tartar over guacamole, scallop with seafood sauce, truffle gnocchi, truffle pizza, octopus, crab salad and of course their delicious bread.Everything was delicious but if I had to pick my favorites I would go with the scallop, tuna tartar and crab salad.

The decor included beautiful chandeliers alongside paintings with swear words scrawled across them. The crowd ranged in attire from t-shirt/jeans and mini-skirts, to jackets and stilettos. Most of the women had on full faces of heavy clubbing makeup, and looked incredibly out of place at Sunday brunch. The waitstaff had an air of pretention but looked like high school/college kids from across the Hudson. The food and drinks are very expensive, but thankfully, pretty tasty.

5.0,11/10/2015,"OK, so a five star rating is pretty serious. This is true. But I've been here something like 5 times now and its always perfect. The chefs back there are as talented as they come. Have to be French guys. I've had the Dover Sole twice and although its not cheap at $68.00, the dish is simply divine. Fileted and deboned tableside with delicious sides that come with it. The grass fed, organic, bone-in filet mignon is simply INSANE. I didn't know meat could taste like that. Succulent, fork-tender, creamy, buttery - almost a hint of foie gras. They had just received an order of rare, Italian black truffles from Piedmont and you could have them shave some on top for an extra $20.00. The ambience is relaxed, refined, elegant, funky-cool and romantic. They always have a DJ sorting out the tunes which are always a fresh mix of old and new choice tracks. The sound system was clearly sourced and installed by a complete pro because the mix is perfect in any seat and they strategically placed sub-woofers along the bench seating so when it gets a bit later and they turn up the juice a little, you can feel the base in your seat. Tellement Cool. Most, but not all, of the servers are French dudes - from France - and there's a special kind of cool that comes with being a young, hip, French guy who loves food and wine. I've never had a server I didn't want to become friends with. My only critique would be that it does tend to attract a lot of giggly, bachelorette party chicks looking for Wall Street cats to buy them drinks and diamonds or whatever they find important. But I've been pretty fortunate and it hasn't impeded my enjoyment too much. Classic place. The kind of restaurant you wished you owned.",0,0,0,Brendan M.,"North Vancouver, Canada",52,16,0
4.0,11/9/2015,"One of my favorite place in the meatpacking area!Yes, this is not a typical NY restaurant, they actually call themselves a French bistro, that is the point! As a native new-yorker I really enjoy Bagatelle atmosphere, mostly because it is unique, totally different than any other restaurant in the city. I went there several times for dinner, a couple times for brunch on special occasions, and I really like how you can have dinner and party at the same place, so annoying to get everybody going elsewhere for dancing after dinner even if the area remains full of nightclubs.Food: 4/5Their ribeye for two is a must. Never had a problem with the temperature, I like it medium cooked. Regarding the sides they have, you will never go wrong with their truffle mashed potatoes! Truffle Gnocchis are also something you shoud have. I've never tasted any better gnocchis in my entire life. This is not a regular pasta and potato dough I believe, the server told me it was ""Parisian Gnocchis"" (so fancy right?), made of a different savory dough... For dessert, I usually take the cream brulee, it is delicious and easy to share. I didn't put 5 stars because it remains expensive, like all fine dining places in this area, but you get what you pay for, definitely worths it!Service: 5/5Never had any issue with the service, always impeccable, they really pay attention to details. Servers are really warm and friendly, and they've always tried to satisfy my requests (I can be super picky sometimes and my former half-vegan/half-glutenfree girlfriend was terrible!). Most of them are from all over the world and they do a great job at keeping the party going! They even get dressed sometimes with a superman, rocky, astronaut, and whatever costume to deliver particular bottle service or birthday cakes. So yes it happens that you have to wait an extra 5-minutes for your cocktail but when you see your waiter literally flying all over the restaurant with a superman costume to deliver another customer bottle service, you easily learn to be patient :-) I actually can't get enough of these 60-seconds shows they put! The bussing staff is also spot on, they are not overwhelming, privacy is key there, and they don't clear anything before you give them the green light. Regarding bartenders, they are also very efficient even when the bar gets really crowded, usually after dinner. One last thing, make sure you show up on time. I've showed up late a couple times and they made me wait like 20 minutes at the bar but how can I blame them? So be extremely carefull with your time reservation especially on friday and saturday nights.Once again I don't get how people can expect a typical NY-restaurant experience when they enter a French bistro?

1.0,10/17/2015,"I was genuinely looking forward to enjoying a fun brunch at Bagatelle with a big group of friends, as I had heard it is a really fun time for weekend boozy brunch. The food was ok, the service was poor, and everything (especially the alcohol) was ridiculously overpriced. And this is not even to mention the main point of this review. I had been reluctant to create a Yelp profile and write a review because I felt like it was too much work and not worth it because no one would really see it, but I have been dealing with a dispute over this brunch from 3 MONTHS ago, and feel that customers should really know the truth before going there. At the conclusion of our brunch, we split the total amount and I was given a bill for my portion, which was $1400, and told specifically that gratuity was included. So I drew a line through the space for tip, and wrote in a total of $1400. The following morning I checked online and saw a charge for $1400 for my credit card. Mysteriously, between that time and when I got my final statement for the month, the charge had magically increased to $2100. I disputed the difference of $700 through my credit card company, and actually have proof that Bagatelle wrote over my line through ""gratuity"" and gave themselves a tip of $700, and CROSSED OUT my written total of $1400 and wrote in $2100! I have never witnessed such blatant illegal fraud by a business in my life. And other members of my party were also overcharged by $700! Further, my claim was just denied by Bagatelle. I am sure that Bagatelle takes advantage of inebriated customers all the time, and have falsified bills countless times already in the past. On top of the $700 they stole from me, I just wanted to get the word out to the public that they are nothing short of con artists.

I went here for brunch, just us two girls dressed casual with flip flops because we just wanted lobster risotto and nutella rasberry french toast. The bouncer stares at us up and down and I'm thinking I understand there is a party later but we can't just come to eat. The bouncer is confused and says we don't have any tables but little did he know I had called and the lady had told me there are seatings available outside and I didn't mind because I just wanted the food. So that was super rude, as if people are not even allowed to eat wearing flip flops. When we were seated, it took them 32 mints to bring our food. The couple behind us were waiting for longer and the waiter tells that older couple that they did not start making their food, hence the couple left. Then the food was horrible, dry and nasty as if they had left it on the counter for a while and forgot about it. Our drinks came at the end of our meal after asking 3 times. Then when we get our check it is overpriced and I don't care much for the money but if the food and service sucked then its a big deal to me.

The place is the mother of all boozy brunch restaurants in NYC---- every sat & sun at 3pm, they close all the window shades, dim the lights, put on the disco lights, DJ's music gets insanely loud & the place turns into a day club.I came here on two occasions.The first time, I was with a group of 6 asian girls. It was kind of late, around 4pm-5pm when people were finishing up their brunch meals. We made up some fake name at the door saying we had a reservation and got immediately in. The DJ was blasting EDM music (kaskade from time to time!), people were standing on their chairs dancing with champagne glasses in the air, swigging from giant sized moet bottles.... insane! All happening at 3pm??? There was a percussionist drummer going around the place killing it, letting some of the ladies hit a beat. Even the waiters were dancing on top of the chairs. We didn't have a table but we were dancing anyway. We didn't pay a cent!The second occasion, BF decided to throw my birthday there.Lets just say that for a group reservation of 13, our bill came out to $5000. The minimum requirement was 3000 for our party (which we obviously exceeded), but the gratuity itself was 1000+. Insane right? Ha, like I said, ONCE AND NEVER AGAIN. Felt nice to live like a queen for a day ;)Clubbing at 3pm, popping bottles........ what an experience. One waiter dressed up in a superman outfit, & two waiters carried him out while he held my giant Moet bottle & sparklers. The DJ literally stopped the music & played some grand entrance music. Superman then proceeded to swig the entire bottle into my mouth. Ultimate fail but I was a good sport about it ;)The giant sized Moet bottle they brought out had my initials on it. My Dom P bottle was illuminating beautiful. They brought out a chocolate cake with bottle sparklers. They then brought out an obnoxiously GIANT martini glass filled with icecream whipped cream & more bottle sparklers. Quite the show! ALL MY FRIENDS & everyone in the restaurant were dancing on top of chairs & having the best time of their lives.Everyone ended up leaving completely shitfaced & happy until I told them how much it was. BUT, we all decided it was worthhhhhhhhh ($300+/pp) for the once in a lifetime experience.

HOW did this place even get known to be a spot to come to for non-New Yorkers without another trace of a New Yorker in there? Jessica R's first sentence summary is absolutely correct.It is the most uncomfortable I've ever been at a restaurant in New York...mostly because it was literally the most non-New York thing I've done here for the handful of years that I've lived here. I don't even know how my friends visiting from LA even knew how this place existed in NY.It was also the most confusingly expensive place I've ever been to for brunch.

The chips served with it were crispy. As an entree we both ordered the asparagus and goat cheese frittata. Again, it was great! It was very light and fresh. All of the ingredients blended well together. Drink wise my glass of wine was very reasonably priced. My friends sangria and Bellini were a bit high. $22 a glass for a Bellini is nuts, even for the city. The service was very attentive and friendly.

After standing around for 45 minutes, we were thankfully accommodated.The waiters were very courteous and fast, and we received our drinks and food quickly. The food was adequate. Once the lights went off and the place turned into a club, the 5 of us girls were invited to join a table of guys who were buying bottles of champagne. Upon our arrival, we were verbally harassed by girls who were let's say, not the most well dressed or classiest group of girls. They repeatedly called us white trash and bumped into/pushed us as they were dancing. They continued to harass us as we were trying to enjoy ourselves with our new group of gentlemen friends. They continued to harass us to the point of getting physical with the guys we were with. The argument broke out into a physical altercation, where these girls decided to pick up glasses of champagne and chuck the glass at us. It was an utter mess and a truly classless experience.I am incredibly shocked by the caliber of individuals that bagatelle allows to attend their brunch parties. From my understanding, bagatelle is an exclusive and high end establishment and I have never not once experienced such a dangerous and threatening Sunday brunch experience.Highly recommend looking elsewhere for your next birthday party celebration.",5,8,0,Mary I.,"Bellmore, NY",413,7,2

5.0,8/21/2015,"What's one word that comes to your mind when you think of Bagatelle... I think everyone immediately says ""brunch."" And not just a casual brunch out with friends, but something more along the lines of this. But while you're busy taking bottles of champagne to the face, you're missing a part of Bagatelle that often goes unnoticed. The food is pretty damn good.I previously wrote about Bagatelle back in 2013 and after my latest visit I can say the food is still just as amazing. Much like Bagatelle does its brunches, they don't hold back when it comes to dinner. Dishes are French by design but kicked up a notch to meet the modern, hip vibe of this place.My recommendation is to try everything on the menu. You can't go wrong. The gnocchi made with a black truffle pesto filling and truffle sauce absolutely ooze with truffle flavor and are so rich and decadent. The Châteaubriand is a carnivore's dream next to a sky-high pile of fries.A complete list of what I sampled is below:Salade Bagatelle - hearts of lettuce, Parmesan cheese, fresh garden herbs, mustard vinaigretteGnocchi Truffés à la Parisienne de Nicolas - homemade gnocchi, black truffle pesto filling, truffle saucePizza à la Truffe Noire - black truffle, flat bread, crème fraiche, scamozaTartare de Thon Bagatelle - ahi tuna tartar, avocado salad, lime soy vinaigrette, taro chipsCalamari - risotto saffron cake squid ink vinaigretteChâteaubriand - Pour Deux - 24 oz center cut beef tenderloin, truffle potato purée, red wine and peppercorn sauce - for twoPoulet Rôti Entier à la Truffe - Pour Deux - whole truffled roasted chicken, country style potatoes, chicken jus - for twoSteak Au Poivre - black angus certified sirloin steak with homemade pomme frites and cognac classic sauceBagatelle is much more than just a weekend brunch party.

Our waiter left a lot to be desired he couldn't even get our cocktails correct which were on the pricey side. When we asked what the specials were he told us one entrée was Branzino. Then he said Bass. So I asked him if they had Bass and Branzino.  He explained they only have Branzino but most ""people don't know what it is so he tells them it's Bass"". Dude this is NYC and Branzino is offered everywhere. At that point I ordered a second glass of champagne. Our waiter delivered my champagne and put it in front of my date instead of me. When our Branzino arrived our waiter had the task of filleting the fish for us. I had a lot of bones in my fish which was served on the cool side because it took our server a long time to debone the fish because he had no idea what he was doing.

Eggs were overcooked, smoked salmon had no flavor and croissant it was on only made it worse ( don't think it was very fresh). Frittata (which is basically an omelette) was edible only because of goat cheese. Parts where it was spread too thin had no taste whatsoever. But the biggest surprise was bacon- not only was it burnt and greasy, it also had no flavor (??!!).

Every single interaction with us was unfocused and sloppy. And I won't go into the wait we had to endure - for fairly simple orders in a half-empty restaurant..The food was decent in itself - but way too expensive when you look at the value for money aspect. Yes, this is an expensive area in NY but that calls for a higher level of quality to support that price level. My steak eas priced similar to a steak in a real steakhouse but was not half as good.

Our waiter, David...was beautiful with a French accent. My friend mentioned that he looked like Matt Bomer, except more European. When he was introducing himself as our waiter, he also added that we were ""so lucky"" to have him as our waiter. I nearly choked on my own saliva. I couldn't help but laugh nervously. Completely turned off at that point. We shared the pastry basket. My friend had the Nutella French toast, which was very filling and egg-y. I had the Croque Monsieur Truffé and it was delicioussssss!

I am unsure if it was the dim pink lighting and the fact that everyone was dressed up but it seemed as if everyone was beautiful! The food is ok; I would recommend eating somewhere else for dinner rather than eating at Bagatelle. It is super over-priced. I ordered a flat bread pizza and an appetizer and ended up paying about 80 bucks. Drinks are about 20 bucks each. The pizza looked like the kids style pizza which is frozen and then cooked in the oven.  Gnocchi isn't too bad, it's nothing to write home and tell mom about!The restaurant is listed as a ""French Restaurant"" however; I don't really see anything ""French"" about the Menu. I may have a different experience if I join Bagatelle for Brunch. The atmosphere is on point and I would definitely recommend anyone to come for the great music and spectacular nightlife it offers. Towards the closing of dinner the waiters will start to dance and approach you at your table to get you to start dancing! The DJ was remixing hits like Madonna Preacher to Salsa dancing music!

1.0,5/18/2015,"Worst experience at a restaurant ever!  I went here yesterday with 8 girlfriends for my birthday party and the place was such a disappointment.  Not only did they make us wait an hour after our reservation to be seated, the waiter took at least 20 minutes to come over to our table to take our order and gifts that were given to me as a birthday present were stolen.  I just called the restaurant as I noticed the items missing from the gift bags when I got home and we were the last people to leave.  When we left the restaurant the bags were left in the bathroom accidently and we went right back to get them to only be told the bags were not there and were stolen; meanwhile we could see them and when we pointed it out to the staff member he then handed us the bags which were missing three gifts.  When I called just now I spoke to the closing manager, who worked yesterday, who was extremely nasty and told me he already told me he did not have the bags.  When I said he handed them to me and items were missing he immediately changed his tune and said he was not the one who handed me the bags but nothing was left in the restaurant.  As we were the last people to leave I said the bathroom attendant must have stolen them then and asked for her name which he spelled out for me so I could make a criminal complaint.  Worst restaurant ever!  The staff is extremely rude and clearly they have thieves working for them.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone",3,0,0,Rachel P.,"Lynbrook, NY",0,2,0

When we arrived at the place (around 11PM Friday), and asked to enter, the security guard told us that we cannot go inside. We said that we are invited, and he said that we cannot go inside. We asked why? And he refused to answer. We asked again, and he said that we need to step back from the entrance (In a tone that a policeman talk to you when he arrest you for murder!!). We left with a very sad feeling, since we did not want to bother our friend. Very unprofessional behavior.I never witnessed such a rude behavior from a security guard.

4.0,5/14/2015,"If you like to party, then Bagatelle's brunch is the place to be. Their party brunch has been on my to do list ever since I moved to New York. We made a reservation for a party of 6, about a month in advance for 2pm on a Sunday. When we walked in, we saw ladies decked out in full on clubbing outfits in the early afternoon, with a mix of trendy, bar or dinner outfits. We first ordered brunch food - Eggs Benedict, Lobster Mac and Cheese, Gnocci, pizza - all very pricey ($25-$40 per plate) and shared a large Mojito Fish Bowl ($395). The mojito was hugeee and delicious - it came with 20 glow in the dark straws and everything was a lot of fun. As we ate, the restaurant lights dimmed, curtains closed and the throbbing lights went up. It turned into a full-out club.  The DJ started playing EDM/hip hop/top 40 music and people started dancing on tables and being carried on people's shoulders. Every 30 minutes or so a table would be delivered a large bottle or a big dessert that would be delivered by either Superman, Darth Vader or Marie Antoinette accompanying music and sparklers - it's a great party atmosphere. The music and dancing was great - you just start dancing with everyone around you - it's like going to a nightclub in the middle of the day.Now, the downside of coming here is that everything is overpriced. For the 6 of us, the bill came out to be over $1,200, including two champagne bottles. However, everything about Bagatelle is fabulous and I guess that is expected from a popular party brunch place in meatpacking.",6,1,4,Syyu C.,"Manhattan, NY",567,274,1485

The charcuterie plate was fine, but took forever to come out. When our steaks were arrived both were overcooked, and I returned mine which was cooked to well although I ordered it rare. When my new steak returned it was honestly just seared on each side (blue), and had a charred flavor and the new fries were just barely cooked. The flottante dessert was rather sugary, but the best part of the meal overall. Throughout we ran out of water multiple times and needed to request refills and condiments were never brought to the table.

I only come here for special occasions - the drinks will cost you upwards of $180 (each)... granted they are made for sharing and are 3x bigger than my head... but with a group... you will each probably end up getting and finishing your own massive drinks... and then, yeah. You're out $300 for brunch. Whoooop.On the bright side you are absolutely guaranteed to have a great, memorable experience. I would highly recommend everyone in their 20s goes to brunch here at least once while you're living in NYC. Begin your time at the bar where you will likely order one of the many drinks they offer between $17-$25 as you wait for your entire party to arrive and be seated. There are a bunch of bouncers around which is funny to see at noon. Decor is #onfleek with massive champagne bottles sprawled about. You will have multiple instagram photo opps. The place is well-lit when you are first seated, unlike many other clubby brunch spots in NYC that are pitch black blasting FREAK A LEEK right at the start.

2.0,4/22/2015,"So, for full disclosure I should tell you that I'm English. And we have historically never had a truly harmonious time with the French... As evidenced tonight. I think I have hit on the reason that this place was empty on a Wednesday night when no other restaurant in the vicinity had a table to spare... Their attitude is quite astounding. I booked a table for 5 people at 8pm. I turned up at 7pm with a friend looking for somewhere to drink for an hour. I approached the hostess and explained our situation. She asked for the name of the reservation. Looked at me disdainfully, then asked ""What is your question?""  I repeated my question, she waved at the bar area. I asked if there were any seats. She said ""I can see some seats"". I asked if there were any EMPTY seats. She waved again and said ""that is our bar"".  We went to the Ganesvort Hotel Bar... We came back at 8pm and had to introduce ourselves again. She wanted to know if our entire party was there. I lied and said yes. There was a lot of discussion in French that I understood perfectly well, but chose to ignore. We were eventually shown to our seats even though they knew we were fibbing. I find the whole ""we'll wait until your entire party is here"" bollocks so pretentious - but when their dining room is absolutely empty, I find it doubly annoying. And when they're French, that just sends me over the top. We all eventually arrived and our waiter came over. I honestly have never been served by anyone quite as lazy, entitled and arrogant. He constantly tried to up sell - offering only bottled water, champagne, $700 a bottle wine (seriously, when we asked for a recommendation they turned to the $500-$1,000 wine list.)We ordered and my friend asked for the steak with mushrooms instead of fries. When the food came - it was fries, not mushrooms that accompanied the steak. Our waiter had forgotten, but tried to bluff his way out of it by saying the chef refused to change the dish. To be fair, the food was delicious. My salmon was amazing and everyone loved what they had ordered (except the fries, they were completely soggy!). The loos were awful. They obviously hadn't been cleaned in a while, loo roll was thrown around, loos had not been flushed and NOT ONE SINGLE DOOR LOCKED! I perched on the loo with my left foot waving in the air in front of the door, ready to yell. It was most off putting.

In my experience, that is pretty rare in a place with as many excellent options as Manhattan, especially in the Meatpacking District.All in all, I had a practically perfect experience at Bagatelle, and can't wait to go back again the next time I'm in town.  Hopefully I can get a table!",0,0,0,John W.,"San Diego, CA",13,27,10

After my friend complained to the manager, we were allowed to sit inside until 1130, and even given complimentary mimosas. There seemed to be a lack of communication between the reservations center and the restaurant. That being said, the food was delicious.

So we waited about an hour and 20 mins before we were seated!! CRAZY!  If it wasn't my friend's bday I probably would have left cause that's nuts.  Also the place became super crowded while we were waiting, so no matter where we stood we were in the way.  Around 3 is when they shut the curtains and the dance party starts.  One of our friends had the sense to go get some champagne and we had some mimosas while we waited.  Finally we were seated, right by the DJ, but at least we were away from the crowd by the bar.  So literally 5 mins after we were seated they were taking our order, apparently once you're seated they don't waste any time. We waited to be seater longer than it took for us to order, receive and eat our food. I had low expectations for the food, but it surprised me and what I got was really good.  I got the short rib sliders which had grilled pineapple, cheese and coleslaw on top.  I also got a side of fries which were really good too.  Expensive, but good.  One of our friends ordered a bottle of champagne to arrive at the table via a waiter dressed as (i think) George Washington, along with lots of sparklers.  This happened a lot throughout the day, all with different characters: superman, yoda, storm trooper, ghost buster, etc.. I though the music was pretty good, and it was fun to get up and dance once we finished our food.  We even ordered a LARGE sundae for my friend, which also came out with sparklers around it.  Overall I did have fun, but I didn't pay for any of the alcohol we drank, so I don't know if I would have been as happy at the end of the day if i had.  I also don't think I would have had as much fun without drinking.  This place is just not really my scene.  It was fun for my friend's birthday and I think she had a good time, but I don't know that i'll be back any time soon.  I mean waiting an hour and 20 mins when you have a reservation is really unacceptable..",3,0,1,Rachel W.,"Manhattan, NY",284,202,541
1.0,3/16/2015,"HIGHLY unfortunate that customer safety & comfort were compromised for sake of getting a check paid by a customer being served alcohol while clearly under the influence of drugs. I was ready to give this place a positive review based on the excitement and the food, but ultimately had a very disturbing experience after being groped and violated by a drunk & high patron who was allowed to STAY at the bar. I came with a large group for a birthday celebration and our table was near the bar. A group of at the bar purchased a large format bottle of champagne; several of the guests in that party appeared to be highly intoxicated, with one patron even falling off her barstool (and then continued to be served). A man with that group was coming up the stairs from the bathrooms when I was going down the stairs, and he groped me, running his hand across my dress up my thighs and private area. It happened so quickly all I could do was throw his arm and turn to yell at him; he kept going up the stairs. I was shaken and mortified and told my friends what happened when I went back upstairs. Some men from my group confronted him and forced him to apologize, and he was clearly high on drugs, his eyes rolling around, and claimed to not even remember doing it. I didn't want to ruin my friend's birthday party by kicking up a huge fuss so I was willing to let it go at that point, HOWEVER, not even 30 minutes later there was a commotion from the stairwell - his partner in crime/drinking buddy forcibly groped ANOTHER woman in the stairwell -- THAT man was asked to leave. We informed the manager/hostess that that was actually the second offense perpetrated by that group of drunk/high individuals. However, the man who groped me was allowed to stay. On our way out, someone in our group overheard the bartender and bouncer discussing their concern over getting the check paid, which made it seem to us that the offender was allowed to stay -- despite assaulting a patron -- because they were worried he wouldn't have paid the check if he was asked to leave. Police could have been called if that came to pass. I have grave concerns over patronizing an establishment that looks the other way when patrons are, essentially, sexually assaulted -- and looks the other way when illegal drugs are clearly being used on their premises -- all so they don't have to worry about chasing someone for a signature on a bar tab. Disgusting. Disappointing. And also setting themselves up for a lawsuit if the next victims happen to be so inclined... not to mention legal liability for continuing to serve individuals who are VISIBLY high and intoxicated, falling off barstools and pouring bottles of champagne on each other's heads.

The lobster macaroni and cheese had no discernible lobster, which left one with a very pricey mac n' cheese. Their signature dish, the Nutella French toast lived up to the hype.

4.0,2/19/2015,"Okay...if you only read one Bagatelle review, you need to read this one. I'm going to give you the FULL rundown of Bagatelle boozy-brunch Sundays.SO! To start, you better make a reservation. Don't even think of trying to come to Bagatelle on a Sunday brunch day and expect to be seated at a table. That's laughable. You MAY be able to get in and stand at the bar but who the hell wants to do that? Reservation time? This depends on if you want to eat beforehand. If you want to eat in peace without sitting in darkness and hearing music so loud you can't talk to anyone at the table then make it for 2:30/3pm. That will allow you time to order food and eat it before the madness starts. At exactly 3:30 the music starts going full-on. Make sure you also arrive within 10/15 minutes of your reservation or you risk them not allowing you to sit at your reserved spot.Second of all, if you come with just a party of 2 for brunch, be prepared to have a shitty table. Yeah, I said it. I didn't see one party of 2 people that had an even halfway decent table. Two of the 2-top tables are literally in like the hallway/walkway of the restaurant so there will be tons of people blocking the view of the place. If you come to Bagatelle and want to do it right, get at least 4 people and make a day of it.Third of all, at tables for large parties it's bottle service only. You can get some relatively cheaper wine bottles so it's not like you'll be shelling out thousands of dollars on boos but just keep that in mind that everyone will be pretty much drinking the same thing. They have this huge (I don't even know how to really properly describe it) almost like a vase thing filled with boos and there are like 10 straws in it so you can share (if wine and champagne isn't your thing). Basically, everything alcohol-wise is shared.Food. Yes, order food here. It is after all, a brunch. I ordered the tuna tartare. I was a little skeptical because I hadn't had Bagatelle food in a long time and ordering raw fish was not the first choice for me but I didn't want something super sugary (pancakes/nutella) or super fattening (lobster mac & cheese/pizza) so I went with a much healthier option and it did not disappoint. Seriously, it was the best tuna tartare I've ever had (see photo that I uploaded with my review). It comes with chips to dip which I did not show in the picture, but seriously this is a must-order even to share as an appetizer (or main-course).Now on to the scene. Yes every girl will be wearing a Chanel bag and look like she just took 7 hours to get ready. Yes you may see some creepy dudes with sunglasses on who look like they have a Jersey Shore audition after brunch but come on people, this is Bagattelle. It is to be expected. Just set your expectations properly.If you order certain bottles of champagne and alcohol, they do their own show just for you in front of everyone. I believe it's $1,500 minimum but they deliver your bottle in really unique ways and never the same way twice. For instance, they can have 5 guys holding up one guy with your bottle and he's dressed as superman. The music cues as well so it's a big eye-catching production. If you want to see and be seen, I'd opt for that.Now, on to the bill. I left early and gave him cash towards the bill for my portion of everything. I informed my friends of this and told them how much I gave so they could make sure that the bill was properly adjusted. He did not tell them at all that I had paid anything nor did he adjust it off of the bill. So, had I not told them exactly what I gave him, he would have tried to play it off like I never paid. I didn't like this at all because it just showed how shady he was. I think that they assume people get so drunk and want to take advantage as many others have stated in the reviews as well. SOOO be very careful with what your order. Even though you're having a good time, just try to monitor exactly what you guys order so that no surprises come at the end.All & all, this is a really fun brunch spot for a special occasion. I wouldn't make this an every week thing, but it's a fun thing to do once in awhile. I have also had dinner here on regular nights and wasn't disappointed but the music was too loud for dinner. Anyways, for brunch, this is a go-to spot.",15,4,4,Melanie A.,"Manhattan, NY",1284,565,388

Only reason I gave it 4 stars was because they did not debone their branzino very well.  Other than that it was a fantastic place.",1,0,1,Miss G.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,107,7

1.0,1/31/2015,"What a con. Beware.Went there last night with a couple of friends, surprised the place was almost empty for being 8 PM on a Friday's Manhattanite night.We ordered an entry level wine at around 60$ because we could not find a white wine of the year, I guess they buy old lots for a discount price and then try to oversell them to their customer at the regular price. As expected the wine was awful, you can buy a better wine for 10$ at any liquor store downtown.Then we ordered the Calamari to share, nothing to share about them. Only got about 5-6oz of little-tiny calamari, and they smelled like cheese. How where they cooked? I could not tell since we had to light our Iphone led flashes to read the menu as the space was loud and dark.Main courses where also a disaster, my wife ate the duck, which make her spit some of the pieces because they were all nerve.The 'best' part came when we tried to order our desserts. A busboy approached us to offer desserts (which really surprised me), offering us a 'sandy' as we were hesitant to decide. We agreed and then he also offered the profiteroles. We also agreed as we had not enjoyed the dinner at all. We were 4, so we thought it would be wise to share two desserts.After a long wait, they bring us a huge mountain of whipped cream covering chocolate and vanilla ice-cream, the portion suited for a party of 10 or more people. We were astonished when we realized we were being cheated. To end the con they charged us 55$ for this horrendous mess of sugar, that remained almost intact as we left the place. We could not fully realize the trick until we got the check, as the con was not displayed in the menu.Not happy about this the waiter complained about his little tip, and suggested it was our fault to have ordered the desserts to the busboy (as we were telling he was the one that came to our table to ask, and offered the con). He and the busboy of course were working together, or they have a very poor management, one or the other.Never again.",7,1,0,RJ F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0

At this point I didn't care I gave the guy my card which was a 2000 min and my table was in the back corner at this point in mind boggled that this was the party everyone hyped up I felt like I was at tea Being who I am I ordered a bottle of champaign which was around 1000 and had everyone's brunch shut down lights turned off and had superman fly in with my bottles with sparklers. I loved it can't say the same for everyone else but it was greatOnce my bottle was ordered a domino effect happened soon brunch ( which by the way I can honestly say I didn't eat a bite to eat ) turned into an epic day rage Long story short my 2000 bill turned into an 8000 which I couldn't comprehend because either I was to drunk to read it or was having way to much fun.Was it worth 8000 no.

Nutella french toast - this was actually nutella raspberry french toast, an amazing combination. I just wish the bread had been soaked a bit longer in the egg.

(I never called her a whore.. but she was obviously feeling guilty because she was acting like one) and then offered me a massage.. I said no and she still hovered around our table until we asked her to leave.   I'm sorry but upscale french place and cheap looking massage girls don't mix.  This place has gotten really lame, cheap class and obviously is trying to think of ways to bring in the old 90 year olds to spend money.  I don't recommend if you want to be surrounded by classy people in a fun environment.",0,0,0,Alexi T.,"New York, NY",0,2,0

Didn't expect that she picked out such a upscale fancy place but thanks to yelp, I did my research and dressed to the nine compared to two of my friends who weren't as prepared for this place! Heck, we all had such a blast anyways. If you wanna really do it up big for a great day time experience on your birthday, and don't mind having the money to blow... This is your place to be.So let me give you an idea on how the prices runs for drinks&food...$400 for one huge tub of Sangria(Mega Rose Sangria); we got two of that for the 6 of us to turn up.$84 for six sex on the beach shots.$15 for truffle fries side on the table to share$19 for tuna tartare to share$20 for two jugs of sparkling water$20-$30 for each brunch entree we ordered.$55 for one big birthday sundae.Due to previous reviews, I had low expectations on the food thinking this is just some effortless cooked food for the overpriced cost to this upscale name... Well yes, the food is pretty overpriced but I really have nothing bad to say about the food at all. The truffle fries were so good and my favorite out of all the brunch dish was probably the Nutella French toast! It ain't top notch par but it's really not bad either. Plus who needs food when you have all those drinks and your body is too busy bumpin to the music?We came 15 minutes late to our 2:30 reservation and got seated right at 3pm. The bouncers and servers may seem really snotty at first.. But when it came through the party, they're actually very friendly and engaging... Must be a French thing oh my. So it's a classy ambience with bright lights and chandeliers in the beginning. Once it hits 4, the curtains close and the lights start to dim down, the music gets louder, led lights lit on and suddenly people are standing on their chairs dancing away to the vibe. Soon, my girls wanted actual hard liquor... And I think this classy upscale place is strictly only a Champagne Brunch type. Hence the fact we received 6 sex on the beach shots, even though we were really expecting regular vodka shots. Each time we kept asking if they had regular bottle of vodka of some sort they either said sure and never got back to us or dodged the question. They didn't bother giving us the memo that it's only a champagne kind of brunch... Oops. Should've figured though from seeing only champagne on the menu. Fine, we'll order a second $400 Mega Rose Sangria.Our tab? About $1400 between us 6 girls. Isn't the birthday girl lucky she doesn't get to pay? Of course. Almost $300 from each of us for this bougie boozy brunch. I guess I'll be eating instant cup noodles for the next few days... Jk... Not really hah.",10,5,4,Monica P.,"Brooklyn, NY",432,222,440

This caused us to have to pass dishes upon serving and busing. Thankfully the food was OK because conversation was nearly impossible, unless you were willing to yell over to the person next to you, the music was that loud. It wasn't even 1 PM.

They are desperately trying to save money by cutting corners. It comes through on very embarrassing little things, like not bringing out enough ketchup or claiming to run out of items they clearly just never stocked in the first place.4. They claim to run out of a LOT of items on the menu. Since there are basically only two waves of seatings (early brunch goers and party brunch goers), it is highly unlikely they already ran out (or indeed had it in the first place) and it most likely has to do with them trying to save money (see point 3).5. This is obviously the worst aspect, but it is nothing new unlike the other points. They will try to get you out of there as soon as possible. They will take away any bottles that are 80% empty, they will bus any plates that are 80% eaten- the second your fork comes down, they will take your plate. Their business model is to clear the table so they can get someone in from the bar to order bottles while there is still enough time left in the party. While this is no surprise and I understand why they do it, it is soo stressful and uncomfortable if you are a customer. And they are completely shameless and utterly aggressive about it.6. I have no idea what the deal is with this, but it smells like an open sewage pipe in front of the entrance. This may have nothing to do with them, but where the unfortunate bouncers are standing, it literally smells like human feces. Bagatelle has gotten to the point where they are catering to primarily bachelorette parties and other one-time tourist customers. I am positive they are on their last legs as evidenced by the above. It was not always this bad. Bagatelle is over.",10,3,2,A G.,"Manhattan, NY",32,204,49

Very pricy because you have to buy a bottle in order to keep the table after brunch. we spent well over $150 a person. loved the way they carry out the bottles in costumes. music was phenomenal. gnocchi was the best part about brunch. dom perignon-best champagne. fast paced service and suitable for young crowds. i give this place a 9/10!!!,0,0,0,Erika S.,"Pompton Plains, NJ",129,29,16
4.0,9/29/2014,"I have been to Bagatelle several times.. (ranging from Monday-Sunday brunch) and each time..is a good time. I have found the managers and staff pleasant, to those who are pleasant to them. If you come here with 10-15 of your friends, and start making retarded demands, or only order bread and water, then want to argue over the bill, then perhaps you should find a Dave & Busters or Chuck E. Cheese?You come here for the ambiance and the beverages ( but not for the food really). The vibe is great; men in nice attire, women looking fab..I do not get when people come into this place, then call it pretentious..It is what it is.. There are pubs across the street, and Dos Caminos has drink specials daily :-). If you come here enough, they remember your face, and all the good stuff follows.The Sunday brunch dance parties are well worth your time ( better than an actual club)..Once again, please be advised, this is NY and this IS the Meatpacking district.",0,0,0,Jay U.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0
5.0,9/23/2014,"I attended Bagatelle for my friend's birthday this past Sunday and let me tell you...It was the best Sunday ever!! Even before physically entering this establishment, you'll see high end European vehicles and countless Range Rovers parked in front. There are gorgeous people everywhere sporting luxurious clothing. Red bottoms for the ladies and LV loafers for the gents. I felt like I was in Hollywood lol.Anyways, we finally sat at our table for 12. They won't sit you down till your whole table arrives. So be on time and don't make friends wait lol. We ordered Sangria for the whole table and out came this huge plastic tub full of it with 12 straws sticking out. The waiters gave us a ladel for us to pour into individual glasses. That costed $400.00. The server should of poured it for us IMO. The sangria tasted really good and was sparkling. For food I ordered the Eggs Bagatelle which included 2 smoked salmon with poached eggs with Hollandaise sauce & home fries on the side. ($22.00). It tasted real good with the sangria lol.After brunch, Bagatelle turns into a day club after 3pm. All the bright lights dim and multi colored LED lights flash around. House and RnB music blasts out from the speakers and everyone is dancing. The table behind us ordered expensive bottle service and all of a sudden superman man music turns on with red and blue LEDs flashing everywhere. One of the servers donned a superman outfit and he was ""flying"" with the bottle on one hand. And was pouring into each party member's mouth. Overall it was a great experience and I felt like quitting my current job to work there full time LOL. IT IS SO FUN. Yummy food and drinks only to get burned off by dancing at 3pm.

2.0,9/15/2014,"For the purpose of this review and not to be biased, I will give them 2 stars rather than the 1 star they deserve. I'll first start with some of the highlights of my day there (Sunday brunch):1) The lobster mac and cheese was actually good. Nice balance of cheese and lobster. Not extremely heavy.2) I also tasted the eggs benedict and that was also tasty. Not the best I've had but definitely a good quality (small portion though for both lobster mac and eggs).Let's now move onto the service, It started out decent. We ordered a few bottles for the table and then ordered our entrees. Some of us ordered coffees as well. The waiters definitely tend to rush you out as they want big spenders at the tables. Mind you, every single one of us ordered an entree and then dessert as well. (along with 2 bottles for the table)Anyways, everything seemed to be going well. We finished at around 2:30 p.m. and they informed us of the time limit on the table. That was still fine and we moved to the bar area. We ordered drinks and kept ordering. Eventually our friend decided to close his tab and asked the bartender 3 times to close it.You know how they say third times the charm; well the waiter proved that wrong! He ignored my friend's request 3 times (mind you he wrote that he wants to close the tab ON HIS iPHONE yet the bartender ignored him and took shots). Ok, fine, so my friend being the nice guy that he is decides to go to the manager.He waited about a half hour for the manager just to talk to him and only then (after ONE HOUR) he gets his card back and the receipt to sign. Due to the lack of respect and the way the situation was handled, my friend doesn't include any tip and in the place of numbers, writes a phrase that rhymes with LUCK TOO (use your imagination). The bartender wasn't happy and informs the manager who then informs a bouncer to escort him out of the restaurant.So let's be honest with ourselves for a moment; my friends and I are not snobs at all yet for whatever reason we were treated so. The food is decent, the music is usually upbeat, there's a ton of girls who party there that go by the name of Molly, and if you've ever seen Cougartown, well this place makes it look like a college sorority with the amount of married women getting drunk. Manhattan is quite a large place and there are many restaurants in it's vicinity that do not force their patrons to leave their table at a specified time or charge extra if a person is missing from the reservation or force a table to buy ""extra premium"" items if they wish to stay. Will I be coming back here; perhaps if a friend decides to throw a bash here. But I will be seeking other venues that deserve my money for my own plans.P.S.-If you're a hostess in a place like this, and even if a patron gets you ticked off because they made a negative comment about a restaurant you simply work in, it doesn't give you the right to curse them out in your broken English. Even if you are European...remember that.",11,7,1,Marland V.,"Brooklyn, NY",68,79,55

When people are dropping that kind of cash, at least the wait staff puts on a show bringing your bottle to the table.I wouldn't suggest wasting your time actually eating here, just come ready to party and ready to drop some cash.

Thye told us this never happens but it also happened to another big party celebrating a 25 birthday party, so it's clearly just a common practice to keep people out to give the impression this place is so much more amazing than it really is. We waited for over an hour while they told us they were preparing a table which they clearly were not and each employee was nastier than they next. As an example of their rudeness and complete disregard for anyone and their milestone plans in life, one of the managers clapped his hands and told someone in our party to sit and when started to he said ""Ha! Just kidding.""They lied to us, they were mean to us and they found a way to drag out the disappointment of losing our reservation.

4.0,8/26/2014,"We went for Saturday Brunch around 3pm and got a table. I ordered their goat cheese omelet which was pretty average. There was a lot of goat cheese overwhelmingly so. We did order their fries which were delicious as well as the nutella french toast. The Nutella French Toast was absolutely amazing. There was a lot of it and it was delicious with a ton of nutella and some raspberry spread as well. Then around 4pm or so, our food was removed, the lights dimmed even more and the music got louder. People started getting on their chairs and seats and it turned into a club (similar to Lavo Brunch). We ordered their big bottle of champagne that came with a massive ice cream sundae with the waiter bringing it as darth vader but nobody ate the sundae and opted for the champagne instead (obviously). The music was good but less rowdy than Lavo for example. Once 6mp rolled by, all the customers left...into the daylight completely wasted. tl;dr It's a great atmosphere and a thing that people should do at least once. However if you're going to do a club brunch, I prefer Lavo.

That is when we were given the same menu with the same bottles just double to price and told we could only stay if we ordered a $1,300 bottle.

Bagatelle is more about the experience. I have never gone in here and not had fun! Yes, it's a little eccentric. Waiters dance on tables and with guests. Management looks more like mafia (glitterati, mind you). And it's astronomically expensive to grab a couple of drinks here. But that's the appeal of Bagatelle. Come here for a nightcap or between nightspots. Hit it at about midnight. And love dance music. You'll be taken to the south of France and everyone from the doorman to the waterboy want to make sure you have a good time. I have not seen the ""pretentiousness"" some have spoken of, but then again, I've never tried to eat dinner at 11pm in the middle of a dance party.

Ended up having another random wine that the waiter recommended and it was pretty good. Service: We were one of 3-4 tables in the house, and service was really slow. However, the waiters (when we could get their attention) were very friendly, which was surprising given some of the reviews. But it would take 10+ minutes to get our drinks after we ordered them (and we had to inquire about one round when it never showed up).Price: Pricy for lunch, but the ambiance was great (and we did order a few drinks each)!

3.0,6/12/2014,"I'll give you a run-down of my day here...I went to have brunch for my friend's birthday. While we made reservations and there were 9 of us, they only had a table for 4 when we arrived. Naturally, we were furious. We didn't want to ruin the day, so 4 of us sat down to eat while the rest went to the bar to wait for us to get seated at a bigger table. We ordered the food and the waiter was PAINED when I asked for a dish that was different from the other 3 girls, even pushed that I get the other dish. I stupidly consented. The hilarious part is that after all that nonsense, he still brought me the wrong dish and had to remake it (next time, just give me what I asked for to begin with)! Grrrrr!So after about an hour or so, they got us a table. As we weren't finished eating yet, we asked them to please bring the plates over to the new table. While they assured us they would be brought over, the dishes were thrown away. They apologized and said they'd bring us new ones since we weren't finished. By then, the mimosas were getting us nicely buzzed so we weren't too upset. I should mention, however, that we didn't get those new dishes until about 5 hours later when we were about to leave. I know. Unreal. The waiters are incredibly snobby and have no interest in customer service. I guess it's because their tips are already included into the check. Jerks!Anyway, onto the good ...The place closes it's shades and becomes a ""club"" during the day. Can you say awesome? We had a great time. Good food. Great drinks. Great random entertainment throughout the day. It was just a wonderful party. Everyone is dressed to the nines and having a damn good time. The best part is that by the time you leave (7:00PM-ish), it's still day time! Overall, we spent about $80 per person for food and drinks. Obviously this doesn't factor in the girls who originally got drinks from the bar, but honestly the price isn't bad at all considering that we all ate and drank all day.So, the moral of the story is that you don't come here for service, particularly GOOD or TIMELY service. The waiters are ""better than you,"" so just accept it (totally joking). What you do come here for is an incredible experience.

My friend took the Filet Mignon and he said it was really delicious. I had the 'catch of the day' and I chose a baked red snapper, it was really tasty. My other two friends took a dish to share and have ordered a grilled ribeye. It looked very good to see. The waiter who served us is was very friendly and helpful. After finishing dinner we were inside Bagatelle because the DJ began to put great music. So, we decided to have party there. I highly recommend it.",0,0,0,Andrea C.,"New York, NY",5,12,1

The vibe is excellent, the staff superbly trained and attentive.The real heart of Bagatelle, though, is found in it's extraordinary execution of contemporary French cuisine. I sincerely loved everything I tried - especially the Gnocchi Truffles and Tartare de Thon Bagatelle! I enjoyed the place so much that I just had to dust off this old Yelp account to make my first official restaurant review.Just to guild the lily, they also happen to make fantastic cocktails!

1.0,5/18/2014,"I went to Bagatelle to celebrate my friend's birthday last night. If you're coming here to eat, don't. The food was lackluster at best -especially given that they are charging for a fine dining experience, which this certainly was not. Both the beef and the lobster were woefully overcooked. The chicken tasted as if it had been par-cooked earlier that morning or possibly even the day before. Dousing it with beef gravy did little to resurrect the dry, dead bird. The texture of the skin was rubbery and nearly impossible to cut, even with the blunted steak knives they had provided. The epic struggle to dissect the various meats made for a real comedy of errors as we fought to keep our drinks upright while the wobbly table shook violently under the effort. We waited an inordinate amount of time for our server at every turn. He took 40 minutes just to take our drink orders. The waiter's customer service skills, or more aptly lack there of, were an unmitigated failure. He had to literally be chased down to serve our table. And once he was reached, his blasé attitude left us feeling frustrated and abandoned. This same aloofness pervaded the hostesses as well. I believe the perfunctory gratuity added to the bill encourages their server's casual dereliction of duty. Finally, the celebratory giant dessert dish, which was meant to be the crowning glory of the evening was pitiful, with the exception of the giant sparkler that accompanied it. This abomination essentially consisted of a giant mountain of whipped cream and other nondescript filler items, with barely a smattering of ice cream. 95% of it remained on the table along with the acrid stench lingering from the sparkler, as a monument to the sad, pitiful culinary defeat we had the displeasure of bankrolling that evening. Honestly, both the front and the back of house should be ashamed.",15,7,1,Amber D.,"New York, NY",1,4,0

5.0,5/9/2014,"This is what we call high quality! I had an absolutely stellar experience with Bagatelle. My friends and I went there Friday night and found ourselves embroiled in a lively and electric environment. The crowd was so lively and fun. My group of friends found ourselves dancing with many pretty girls within our first fifteen minutes there. The place was crowded, but not so much that you couldn't move around. There was plenty of room for dancing and the song choice was stellar.Occasionally the staff would get involved in the fun. I wasn't sure what started it, but I'm sure that the purchase of a specific drink starts it. The music would be pumped up and different visual effects would blanket the room. It felt like an almost otherworldly experience!The actual service was spectacular. They were very quick with their orders and showed a heightened level of professionalism. I actually found myself enthralled by their pouring of drinks at certain times. Rare to see the staff be so passionate and skilled at their job. I would go in depth with the quality of the food, but I feel cutting to the chase would be more poignant. It was perfect! The taste, the service and presentation of it was perfect! The sliders I had several times, unbeknownst to my friends who ordered it, and was blown away by the taste. Definitely my favorite of the dishes that night.The bathroom also had a great attendant waiting to dry your hands and provide you with excellent service. It caught me off guard definitely, but it was another highlight. The whole night was one big highlight and I was very happy to go here. I fully intend to return there as often as humanly possible.

1.0,5/3/2014,"I hate that Pastis is closed!When I tired to make the reservation for a Saturday brunch at Bagatelle, through open table, it said there weren't any... for over a month ahead of time.  I had to call. The women who answered was able to ""squeeze"" us in, so I was pleased.Got there, and it was EMPTY, at 12 pm on a Sat.  They seemed to still be setting up for the ""themed"" brunch.  So, the ""squeezed in"" really made no sense to me, and now irked me.Oh, & outside, there was a BOUNCER there, looking all intimidating, as if this was some sort of night club.  LOL.  It's a RESTAURANT, on SATURDAY, in THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY.Then, the host at the front desk was simply NASTY. She gave attitude for days, as if she couldn't be bothered to deal with me, and was doing me a favor JUST acknowledging my existence.  She was French (as was most of the staff).Mind you, I eat brunch at lots of French restaurants, like Pastis & Cafe Luxembourg, and I've never experienced attitude like this.The girl who actually seated us was nicer, who laughed when I asked, How big a  bug was up the Host's ass?,"" but still.When the waiter came over to the table, he didn't say ""Hello"" or ""How are you today?"" or anything.  He just stood there.  Silent. Staring at us.  AS if we should be greeting him.  He was also French.  After the awkward silence was too much for him, I guess, he finally asked if we wanted something to drink.  He didn't bother to say if there were any specials.  Then, he took our order.  While we were waiting for our food, people were starting to come in.  By 12:30, I'd say maybe 1/4 of the restaurant was filled.  Remember, she ""squeezed"" us in.The food was so-so, but after all the attitude, it's hard to tell if I was now just being judgmental.  Don't think I was, but who knows?My friend and I decided we would never be eating here again.God, I can't wait for Pastis to re-open.",12,8,3,Joshua E.,"New York, NY",0,4,0

There's not much to say about the food other than it might seriously be some of the best you've ever had. Everyone was stealing food off each others plates just because we couldn't decide which tasted better! We wound up ordering a second round of food. My hat off to the chefs, you guys are doing an amazing job!!! And last but not least, you have to mention the fantastic interior design of the place. That alone is worth coming for! It's fresh, yet slightly edgy, and vibrant. I spent more time admiring the architecture of the place than I did my drink.Very clean establishment as well. Bathrooms were nice and kept. Plenty of offerings there as well to keep you fresh throughout the night. The DJ is also pretty damn good. The bouncer is very friendly, not your typical egotistical mad man.  Bagatelle is the place to come if you're in the city! You'll love food, the staff will do anything for you, and your eyes won't be able to stop taking in the sights! This is really one hell of an amazing place!!!

Regardless of how I ended up there, I was happy for the treat. I was very happy with the service at Bagatelle, and the food was all very well portioned and delicious.

1.0,4/6/2014,"If you're looking to go somewhere to be disrespected & get raped (money wise), you've found the PERFECT spot...Yesterday (Saturday the 5th) was my second time here. I called to make reservations about a month in advanced because i knew i was going with a big party. Rude lady on the phone who barely understood a word i was saying told me they don't accept reservations that far in advanced. Funny, because for a place that acts like who they hell they are, they should be able to take reservations months in advanced if it's THAT great....but that's not the point. Was told to call back 2 weeks before the date so i did. Made reservations for my birthday for a party of 10 girls. Was running a little late due to traffic in the city because of a fair on 6th avenue. Called to let them know i was running late, but a few of my friends may be there before me. Didn't give me a hard time over the phone. My friends get there before me and they refused to seat them because reservation was in my name & i wasn't there yet as well as the complete party. A few minutes go by and my friends are calling me non stop asking where i am because the hostess is threatening to give up my table. Interesting how they had the nerve to threaten to give away a reservation for a party of 10 girls for a birthday. Finally i arrive and the party is complete. The rude hostess drops the bomb on me that i only have my table for an hour and a half due to other reservations after us. Well maybe if you didn't book reservations on top of each other, you wouldn't have to throw people out. We sit down near the window which was absolutely freezing because of a draft coming through the cracks of the door. Such a high end place, maybe they should invest some money into getting doors that fit correctly into the damn frame. Anyway, our waiter was one of the rudest waiters I've ever had. This guy did not have a smile on his face & had an attitude from the get go. My sister spoke to the manager, who was some bald guy in a zoot suit walking around like he shit out money. Tells my sister those are the rules (hour & a half limit) because they are busy and other people are waiting for our table. told her if you plan on spending a lot of money ""then we'll talk"". Last time i spent close to 2Gs among 6 girls. Really didn't like the disrespect this time, in which you don't even know how much we are willing to spend this time. FUCK YOU.Took our waiter about 20 minutes to take our order, which if i'm being ""timed"" to eat & drink, you should take my order 5 minutes after i sit down. We get our food; no complaints there. Once we were done eating & drinking, we were handed the bill & told only way we can stay at the table is if we buy a bottle of Cristal, otherwise we have to stand at the crowded bar. We weren't even asked if we wanted anything else, we were just demanded to get up & relocate to the bar. RUDE.Waiter told us at the bottom of the confirmation email, it says i have a 1 hour and 30 minute limit at the table. We pulled up the email and there was nothing that stated that. Brought it to his attention that he's basically a liar & he went to go ""talk"" to someone. Came back saying it's an error & it should say that, but regardless. we have to leave the table.Funniest part of this whole experience is as we're walking out, we bump into a nice ""GRADE PENDING"" sign in the window. When i log onto the health dept website to see why their grade is pending, it says as of 12/13/13, they had  a C rating due to ""Food worker does not wash hands thoroughly after using the toilet, coughing, sneezing, smoking, eating, preparing raw foods or otherwise contaminating hands."" i am a certified food handler & for anyone who is unaware, a C is basically a step away from being shut down. just a little FYI.I will never give this place another penny. They don't deserve it, they are rude, they have no patience at all & they treat you like they're better than you. For a place that's so ""high class & upscale"", maybe they should invest some money into expanding their restaurant so people don't have to get thrown off their table like my friends & i did. Overpriced, rude, unfriendly, & stuck up describes this place. Good luck running your business with a bunch of disgusting staff & deplorable management. DISGRACE.",4,4,0,Gia C.,"New York, NY",3,26,4

We called to tell them they said no problem. We got there and they said we only had one hour and a half at the table because we were late. Everyone there is flat out rude.  We even asked the manager is it true we had to get up after an hour and he shrugged his shoulders and was like yes but if you spend a lot of money we will negotiate. Give me a break!!! Our time ""was up"" and they gave us the check without asking if we wanted anything else. I said we wanted to order more drinks and we were told to stand by the bar which was very crowded and that if we wanted to stay at the table we would have to buy an expensive bottle of champagne. The waiter said on the email confirmation it said there was a two hour maximum. We looked afterwards and he lied, nothing was mentioned you would get kicked off your table.  This place is a joke. The staff and the management is disrespectful. The waiter was perverted.  I don't have a problem dropping money but not to assholes. The rules change every time. Last time we went we stayed at the table and now because it was busy we had to leave. That's fine if that's the case but just tell people.  How can they even keep a solid business open by being so rude to people? I will tell EVERYONE I know about this experience. It was my second time there and I'll never go back again. My friends warned me about this place, almost every friend that I know that has been there went once and has never gone back..  but we decided to give it a second chance for my friends birthday to have a good time.

The waiter was very up-front about us having a limited time to order and eat (2 hours) as they needed to seat other people. That said, the wait staff is friendly and helpful and will call you things like ""Love"" and ""Gorgeous."" Ours kept coming over with free shots after the party started, which was cool. The food is good, they aren't reinventing the wheel with any of their dishes, but I definitely enjoyed it. And the drinks are great too, especially some of their specialty cocktails. Before the party starts it's your regular upscale brunch place. White tablecloths, everyone dressed up, moderately low noise level. Once we left our table and got to the (very crowded) bar, the party started. They close the blinds, colorful lights come on, a DJ starts playing music, dancers take to the tables and people dressed up in costumes--boxers, Spiderman, etc.--come out to party. It's crowded and gets very hot once everyone starts to dance, so ladies make sure you can shed some layers. If you order a bottle of champagne they make a huge deal out of it, crowd-surfing a costumed character over to open it, sparkles ablaze and all. Dancing is permitted anywhere, even though waiters are still shuffling huge trays of food around.It was definitely a lot of fun--everyone is there to party. But it's expensive, expect to pay $15 or more for even simple drinks like a vodka soda. Brunch entrees average around $25. I'd say it's definitely worth going once, especially if it's not something you'd normally do.

I mean, the whole ""Black Card Bandit"" artwork and the club-like lighting and super cool model-esque staff... let alone any place that carries waiters over to tables with giant bottles of champagne and sparklers if you opt to pay $7500 for said bottle. The whole idea of that seems incredibly abhorrent to me for multiple reasons but I guess thats why people go there- it's ""a party."" So when I was invited to check it out on a weekday for dinner I of course said ""yes.""And Bagatelle is legit as hell far as food goes, I must admit. Fantastic and interesting mixed drinks- the jalapeno margarita was perfecto. And the food is all super super tasty rich people versions of fast food. The Calamari was cooked perfectly, the sliders looked fantastic (I missed out on those), amazing black truffle white pizza, Coquillettes Au Jus, Jambon Et Emmental was basically amazing veal and ham mac & cheese, the charcuterie board had duck prosciutto which blew my mind....

Once we were seated we were greeted with a friendly and upbeat gesture by our awesome waiter....We ordered the fishbowl for about $150 which served 6 of us...the drinks were delicious and with equal parts of top shelf liquor which made it worth the $150.

The hollandaise sauce was dripped to perfection and the spinach was perfectly seasoned!!!! All throughout brunch the energy level was on high which gave me an indication that the weekly brunch party was about to get into full swing...as I scooped the last bite into my mouth the wailing and roaring of the speakers went from 10 to 1000 and the lights went out and into full club mode..In comes the crowd, floods the dance floor and at this point get ready to sweat your behind off....a great setting to work off that brunch you just indulged in ....all in all, I would definitely go back for a summer party and hope for the same service and tasty brunch!",1,0,0,Elizabeth M.,"Brooklyn, NY",347,114,202

Oh boy was I sad about it.  I arrived later than expected and didn't get a chance to order food. But it looked amazing and I actually did try a bite of the pancakes, they were darn good. I also tried a bit of the the gigantic birthday sundaes that was on the table. Not bad at all. What I loved most was the service. I don't know if it was just that day and we got lucky to have such an awesome group of waiters but they were really sweet after I guess putting up a bit of a fuss about adding extra seating. They were very attentive and into pleasing the bday girl. They allowed us to go over our time to have the table. The waiters also gathered her gifts and placed them in a safe spot as well as made space at the bar for all of us to enjoy the brunch party. So I'll admit I was thinking hmmm this party may not be fun, given the district. But when the music started, the lights dimmed, champagne bottles started flowing, the dancers and live drummer started and people began to dance on tables I was like welp I was wrong. I danced non-stop until it was time for me go. We even got a chance to dance and jam with the drummer. I left at 4:20pm and it was already live. My pal had a marvelous time and that's all that really mattered since it was her show. My only complaint would be that it gets cramped near the bar area for the brunch party and  if you want space to dance it can be limiting as the waiters are back and forth with orders.

They only take dinner rezzys 30 days in advance - so we waited until Oct 25 and booked for 10 ppl on Nov 22 at 9 pm. Credit card confirmation and all.Fast forward to Nov 22 - picture 10 hungry ppl at 10:45 with no sign of being seated any time soon... and this is NOT the kind of place where you can chill at the bar and order apps. The patrons were getting drunk and rowdy and we were simply sandwiched in the crowd unable to speak to each other over the noise. The hostess was coked out of her mind (can you blame her?) and spewing bs promises to the mob of angry guests surrounding her podium through her gritted coke teeth.

2.0,1/26/2014,"First of all, Bagatelle is really a club that serves food, so really depends on what you're going there for. Going for the food? Skip it. The food sucks and the place is so loud it's impossible to talk over dinner. I've been twice. Both times the food was not good. This past time, we made a reservation a week in advance and they made us wait an hour for our table. We put up with it because it was Saturday night and at that point our options were limited to go elsewhere. Going to party? It's can be a fun place for sure. The music is loud, but very good. Service - Once you're seated, the service is very fast. Unfortunately for all the wrong reasons. They try and sell you as much as possible and serve you as fast as possible to either run up your tab or get you out of there. The staff is trained to be very pushy and up-sell you as much as possible. You order a glass of champagne, they try and sell you a bottle. You order a bottle, they try and sell you a magnum. You stop ordering booze and they keep pushing you to order more. If the waiter isn't successful in selling you more, the manager stops by and gives it a shot. This has happened to us on both occasions and this is after we bought multiple bottles of high end wine and champagne. Very obnoxious to say the least. My advice. If you want to check it out, just go in for a drink at the bar before committing to the entire ""experience"". Won't be back....",10,2,1,Ken L.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",124,72,35

Turns out the party starts much later.  I expressed my disappointment to the manager only to find that he was an absolute condescending jerk. Basically told us it was not their fault since he's never had this problem before and he argued with us for 10 minutes. I wasn't offered an apology or anything at all. The only reason we went there was for the party since quite frankly, the food isn't very good. My French toast was dry, bacon soggy, and my flatbread was overwhelmed by truffle. I wouldn't go back even if it was on the house. Terrible experience!!!",1,0,1,Kristen B.,"Bronx, NY",0,5,0
5.0,1/17/2014,"What can I say about this place? It is fancy, a little classy, champagne popping type of place but it is worth the time!It is the happiest place in the world. I have been here 2 times and I have never been disappointed. This is really as good as it gets with service, music, food, and having a great time. I have only gone on Saturdays and the best thing to do is to call a month in advance to get brunch reservations. The food is good here, especially the Eggs Benedict, and a host of other variety. The service here is A+ and the people are genuinely nice. Around 3:15 or so is when the party begins til 6pm. Dj Phillipe Paris is the best in the business and the drinks and shots just start flowing. The place does close at 6pm so they can turn it over for Dinner service.

5.0,1/8/2014,"Went to Saturday Brunch at Bagatelle a few times now. In my view this is one of the things to do if you are in New York and like to party. The food is pretty good, but avoid the truffled pizza (that one is forgettable). Eggs Benedict are fantastic (better than Balthazar or the Standard Grill) ... but this is not why you come here ... remember, the food is only foreplay!I strongly recommend to order Champaign with the brunch from the start ... ideally a bottle (or two) ... you want to make sure you have reached cruising altitude by the time the lights become darker and the party starts. If you have, ... well, than you are in for one of the best parties in New York (and anyplace else) on a Saturday afternoon. Lights are low, music is good, people are sexy and the drinks are plentiful. Dancing on charis, tables and wherever else you can fit, ... until about 6:00pm, ... but nothing last forever, right?Do expect a decent hit on you credit card. Even if you are not going for a ""Superman"" (i.e. a larger bottle of vintage champaign that is brought in with fireworks and by a waiter wearing a Superman costume) ...

2.0,1/7/2014,Came here with a group of 10 girls for a friend's bday on Sunday.  Had reservations for 1pm--- didn't get seated 'til 2:40.  you read right- waited 1hour and 40mins for our table.  We asked the hostess at least 4x when our table will be ready and she kept telling us she was waiting for the booth by the bar to be free (supposedly that's the spot to be for the party).   1 we never even requested that booth specifically.  at 2pm we were beyond starved and just wanted to sit.  they didn't even offer us a drink on the house or some bread to munch on.  nada!  what we were baffled about was why they even seated that 1 couple smack in the middle of the section where they wanted to seat us.... helloooo!  if you they had an ounce of logic that obviously wasn't the smart thing to do.so when we finally get seated.  our waiter came by and took our order.  and then boom... 3pm our food is coming out and it's pitch black. WHAT THE EF?!?!  how are we supposed to eat with it being so damn dark in there.  couldn't even enjoy the overpriced food (that was good... but nothing wow)after we drank a few $20 drinks and ordered the big tub of booze (that cost $385!!!) we were tipsy and the anger slowly drifted away.  we had fun... i won't lie about that.  the music actually was too bad.to sum it up- our waiter was good.  attentive and friendly.  we had fun.  would i go again? hell no!  it's def an experience to day party in NYC but totally wasn't worth the wait (despite a reservation) and def wasn't worth the $.  rather have spent my $$$ at a super nice restaurant.,10,1,2,Hoi I.,"Brooklyn, NY",89,164,35
3.0,1/4/2014,"Service: Terrible. Food: Pretty good. Party atmosphere: great.We went here for NYE with pretty high hopes. It was a pretty good evening, however I do not see myself returning here next time I am in New York.When we finally got seated our table was uneven (one part taller than the other) because they pushed two two-tops together to make a six top. We had to ask several times for the problem to be fixed and got different answers each time, ranging from ""nothing I can do"" to ""someone will take care of this"". I understand that a problem like this could arise if we were a walk up but having made the reservation 4 weeks in advance, I expected better planning. I have to give it to them, they did swap the table that was causing the trouble (the replacement was wobbly but we didn't care anymore). Again, this may not seem like a big deal but when you pay for nye dinner in advance, you expect more.The food was pretty tasty, especially the caviar! But I did feel like the portions could have been just a tad bigger. But overall, I was full and happy! Two problems with service related to food: The wait staff was very eager to take our plates away and we had to remind them that the prefixe menu included a champagne toast at midnight (we were asked whether we wanted to order champagne).The party part was great with awesome music. I won't complain about the prices of alcohol because I am sure they are pretty standard across all establishments like this. The one thing I would recommend to bagatelle for pre fixe menus: if you going to charge two weeks ahead for this meal, please include the tax and tip at that time. There was nothing more annoying than trying to explain to the rest of my part why they owe more money for dinner than what they already paid.",2,1,2,Daria L.,"San Francisco, CA",39,16,3

The service was also excellent, all of the waiters catered to our every need and were very tentative.

5.0,12/27/2013,"While you're not going to be particularly frugal if you go to Bagatelle for dinner, I felt very welcome upon walking in the front door. What first caught my eye was all of the 'out there' art that adorned the walls of the restaurant. It was highly entertaining.I decided to get my own party started with a Girl from Lima ($14), a cocktail combining jalapeno infused pisco, passion fruit puree, lemon juice and mint. Because I neglected to read the ""jalapeno infused"" part, I was a little shocked at how spicy this drink was and didn't think I'd be able to finish it. However, I warmed to it, and would highly recommend it!I don't know about you, but when I typically go out to dinner, I don't order the entire menu, but at this awesome event, they practically sent out everything the kitchen was cooking up. For appetizers, we had the Pizza a la Truffe Noir with black truffle, flat bread, crème fraiche, scamoza ($22); the charcuterie board ($24) which came with a variety of house-cured meats and whole grain mustard; Salade Bagatelle with hearts of lettuce, parmesan cheese, fresh garden herbs, and mustard vinaigrette ($13); Tartare aux Deux Saumons ($17/$25) fresh & smoked Scottish salmon tartar, shallot, salmon caviar, dill crème fraiche, olive oil crostini; Haricots Verts et Canard Fumé string beans, radicchio, smoked duck prosciutto, truffle vinaigrette ($18); foie gras creme brulee (off-menu); and finally the Tartare de Thon Bagatelle ($19/$29) ahi tuna tartar, avocado salad, lime soy vinaigrette, taro chips.My favorites were both of the tartares, although I always favor salmon. The fish was fresh and super flavorful. I was very intrigued by the foie gras creme brulee, but I still concede that foie gras is an acquired taste. Hence, I only had a couple of bites as it was very rich, but I would definitely say it's worth a try. The salad was simple and fresh, but I might opt for one of their other more creative salads next time. The truffle pizza was OMG amazing and not just because I like anything with truffle.After all that, I honestly thought that was the entire dinner and was ready to put on the coats and head home. But no! Chef Sébastien came out to answer questions and explain a bit about his background in preparation for the main courses. Yes, plural main courses, because, why not?I'll start with the pasta and fish dishes. First we had more truffles (!) with the Gnocchi Truffes à la Parisienne de Nicolas ($25/$36) homemade gnocchi, black truffle pesto filling, truffle sauce; Calamars Snackes au Beurre Aille ($18) sautéed calamaris, tomato confit, polenta fritter, garlic butter; Coquilles St.Jacques Rôties au Parmesan ($36) thyme & parmesan crusted scallops, artichokes mousseline, cabernet demi-glace; and the Filet de Saumon Sauvage Grillé ($28) grilled wild salmon filet, asparagus hollandaise sauce.I could have eaten the entire vat of gnocchi, no joke, it was that good. Do you SEE the giant truffle shavings spread over the top?!?! Other favorites from this course were the onions that accompanied the salmon. Yes, the salmon was good to but it didn't feel particularly special. The onions, however, were of the giant cippolini variety topped with chantarelle mushrooms. Yum! I would also highly recommend the scallops as they were seared perfectly with a fragile parmesan crisp that will melt in your mouth.Now for the meat! We sampled the signature Poulet Fermier Rôti et Truffé ($30) truffled roasted chicken, country style potatoes, chicken jus and the Côte de Boeuf - Pour Deux ($95) natural fed grilled black angus bone-in ribeye (26 oz), pommes frites, spinach and roquefort salad - for two. You may remember me saying I like to judge a restaurant based on it's chicken before, and according to that rule, Bagatelle passes with flying colors. The truffle sauce was decadent and the chicken was moist and crispy on the outside. The beef was tender and cooked to a nice medium/rare. The French fries that came with it (do you see that giant pile of them!?) were among the best tasting potato wedges I've ever tasted. As for sides, we sampled the mixed mushrooms, grilled asparagus, and roasted Brussels sprouts & butternut squash with candied pecans ($9 each), with the latter definitely a favorite all around the table.Hahaha, you think the feast is over? No way, Jose! (Or should I say no way Jean Pierre?). The chef sent out five different desserts for us all to share. Wowza! In picture order, we tried the Apple Tarte Tatin, Floating Island, Profiteroles with chocolate, drizzle, chocolate mousse, and brioche and pear bread pudding. The floating island was the most interesting dessert; meringue-y and literally floating in a vanilla sauce and topped with almonds, it almost felt healthy (haha, yea right). My favorite was the tarte tatin, a classic done right, although the brioche and pear bread pudding was a close second.Head to Bagatelle the next time you feel like you deserve a culinary treat!",5,2,1,Yael M.,"Norwalk, CT",145,152,0

Additionally, the service was rude and rushed us throughout-- not even letting us finish our over priced and watered down sangrias before telling us it was time to leave because people were waiting (40 minutes into eating!!!

We even recognized some waiters from our favorite places in Cannes.

Expect to spend $100 bucks minimum on a brunch for two. But in return, you're getting awesome food, a fun scene and delicious drinks. I had a mojito with my breakfast made with champagne and Hennessey. Didn't know how that would work out, but it's now my morning drink of choice.

This isn't the typical pick for your average brunch and one needs to gear up for an afternoon/ evening that is, to put it mildly, highly eventful. The menu seems harmless enough with typical brunch items. Despite food not being the central focus of visiting Bagatelle, it is worth mentioning that the food here is great.

I had the steak frites, which cost me $45 but was worth it and perfect to split, and some truffle fries that will make you cream your panties. In order to keep our table after we finished eating, we were told we'd need to spend $1,400 minimum on champagne.

I was dead wrong with both of my assumptions.As soon as I walked in, I realized that I should have had at least two shots of Bourbon at home to prepare for this nonsense. Since these people don't eat, the food was mediocre at best - the choices sparse. I had the thin pancakes but they didn't top them with a tasty syrup. Instead there was a weird tasting thick brown mystery sauce on them. I had a few bites but definitely couldn't subject myself to finishing this mess. They have a variety of drinks available but most of the people looked like they were partying on something extra.They had a DJ spinning music which wasn't too bad once you drank a couple of cups of something. Having a conversation or taking a quick call here is literally impossible. So I decided to kill some time and dance to the bland tracks like that Lil' Jon and Usher song. Every now and then an interesting song would come on that livened things up a bit.Most reviews talk about the ""beautiful"" people, somehow they were missing yesterday afternoon.

Most were trying too hard to get ""noticed"" such as men opening their shirts, licking their fingers and touching their nipples. Of course, the girls who wore too much makeup and their hooker uniforms. Most of the crowd appeared to have tons of work done - picture frozen botox faces, fake dimples, chin and breast implants galore. I prefer to go to places where there is a nice mix of people, this place was sorely missing that. This meant I was surrounded by ""cool"" people and their bad dance moves - money can only buy you so much. The only time I saw a mix of people (besides our 4 person party), they were working in the kitchen and bathroom areas...I felt like we were in the twilight zone circa 1800s.Most of the waiters were in their underwear, not the boxers kind either - ewwww. One was wearing a short hot pink tutu (yes, as in ballet) while a male customer simulated oral sex with a champagne bottle on him. The waiters were forcing drinks down their customers' throats, spitting them at each other and drinking with them. Somehow these idiots believe this raunchy frat house is worth the exorbitant prices.After approximately 30 minutes of this, I sent a ""rescue me"" text to my man. The only place I could take his call was when I sneaked into the kitchen. Until his arrival, I had to endure more of this torture. It took 15 minutes just to get the check, another 10 before I could sign off on the charge and get the heck out of there.If you are in the mood for some bull$h*t, this place is definitely full of it. If you want something a little more classy and fun, go somewhere else.",12,9,5,Diana B.,"New York, NY",3,57,33

1.0,1/26/2013,"This was one of my favorite places....for food, brunch parties, atmosphere...for years. But now, I am FED UP!SO, I held my sisters birthday dinner here. TERRIBLE!!! Everything I requested and reserved over the phone was not followed through with when I got there. I reserved a spot away from the speakers and asked if it would be possible to have separate checks for the bill. They sat our whole party right under the speakers, and then came out white one whole bill!!! They said YES! No one forced them to say that what I requested would be fine...they should have said ""no, that would not be possible"". Throughout the whole dinner, everything from ordering a bottle for the table to ordering dinner was confusing and rushed. Our waiter didn't understand anything we were saying. For a $1,200 bill, I didn't expect such disgusting service at all. Two weeks ago, I am seated with the same terrible waiter for dinner with myself and my sister. We asked him about an item on the menu, truffle gnocchi, regarding the size of the dish. We wanted to share so we needed a sharable size. He brings out a dish so small, it wouldn't be enough for even one person. I told him that was way too small. Instead of switching the dish, he brings out the larger size and told us that there was no way we could send the food back. So we must be charged for both! $25 for the small and $34 for the large...when we didn't even want that in the first place!!! On top of everything else that we ordered! $59!!!!! for gnocchi!  I could have bought a steak! Next time i'm going to Del Friscos!!! They NEVER disappoint! I HATEEEE Bagatelle.

It's in the meatpacking district, so very trendy. Dress for a daytime club (skirts, dresses, leather, heels, etc.)The ambiance is very cool and electric with a dj and strobe lights - like you would find at a club. Interior décor very well done. Cheers to the furniture company for supplying tables functional for both dining and dancing on.FOOD WAS INCREDIBLE!!! Scrambled eggs with salmon were almost as mouthwatering as the tuna tartare over guacamole. I can't even begin to describe how perfect these dishes were. But if I had to pick a favorite, the burger was out of this world. I love burgers and have been to a million joints across America, but this beats ever one I've ever had. The rosé was refilled every time I took a sip so it was difficult to keep track of drinks, and the fishbowl drink of mojitos was also delicious! Great place, great fun, perfect for a party or birthday lunch. Or, if you're just an alcoholic and like to get wasted at 2:00PM.

3.0,12/28/2012,"So I'm not exactly sure how to review this place. In terms of the food I would definitely NOT return. It is way over-priced for what it is. We were a bigger group (ten people) so I tried several different things. The steak was not impressive, and the chicken was a bit flavorless. This would of course be okay if the place wasn't charging an arm and a leg for their food. On the other hand the gnocchi was great as was the tuna tartare. We got two bottles of wine, neither was anything to write home about.I will say though that the place has a great concept. It's like a fun house for adults. People dancing on tables, popping bottles of champagne. Again, all this comes with a price. I would estimate that if you were to get appetizers, entrees, drinks and a bottle of wine the bill would come to 150-200 a person. While the venue is fun and the music is good, the mediocre food doesn't justify the prices. (Regardless though, I was and am very grateful for my generous company who introduced me to this place) I'd recommend going somewhere else for dinner if you plan on dropping that kind of money. I've heard this place is really great for Sunday brunch; if in the near future I'm in the mood for a splurge I may consider giving it another shot, till then though I think the above is a fair assessment.",1,0,0,Benazir A.,"Manhattan, NY",20,86,0

Raspberries AND nutella AND maple syrup??? Insane.The champagne flowed, as did shots, and so did the good times.They literally kick you out at 6 pm but by then you should have an awesome time and be ready for more, if you can handle it, or if like me this past Sunday you can't, then home to bed it is.Mm.. my birthday seems as good an excuse as any I think.",1,1,1,Lama B.,"Brooklyn, NY",229,592,50

5.0,10/25/2012,"The OG Bagatelle is back in townnnnnnnnn! I made reservations exactly 1 month in advance for my birthday dayclub brunch and even then was stuck with the last 1pm reservation. The actual club portion of the brunch begins sometime around 3pm, but they don't allow reservations that late because at that point it's up to the discretion of the bouncers (and it really is! I had a friend attempt to join us around 4pm, but was turned away at the door because she had just come from a day of studying and was wearing sweats, womp!). We had a party of 8 girls, and even with the classic ""tell them the reservation is 30 mins earlier than it actually is,"" people were laaaaate. At the same time, Bagatelle was having several issues clearing a table for us, so we ended up waiting around 40 mins or so to be seated. However, it was definitely worth the wait as we ended up right next to Mr. DJ! We were also in front of the velvet curtain windows where passerbys attempt to catch a glimpse of the craziness that is Bagatelle!Once seated, the waiters really tried to push the bottles list, full of magnum sized bubbly! Initially I was tempted, but in the end we all ordered several cocktails instead. The cocktails were all delicious and oh so pretty! The food itself is decent enough brunch grub, clocking in at $16 average. The gnocci though is TDF, amazingly decadent and melt in yo mouth! Yum. By 3pm, the DJ started amping up the music, playing around with the crazy lights, and the curtains were closed. People started getting up on the chairs to groove while a funky guy in a head-to-toe body suit came around shoving free shots down our throats and letting us swing the Bagatelle flag over our heads. Then several models walked around in their Marie Antoinettte get-ups, complete with over the top wigs, posing for photos. My girls capped off the day with a huge ice cream dessert, topped off with my very own sparkler! Thanks ladies (:Highly recommend Bagatelle for a crazy (yet expensive) Sunday Funday.

4.0,10/19/2012,"Dined here during the (re) opening week and I must say that it was completely chaotic! Never have I seen so many people trying to pack themselves into a restaurant, ever! Albeit the flocks of people crowding the bar & dining area, I surely cannot complain since mostly everyone was young, good looking and entertaining to watch (especially the cougars...haha). Aside from the physical appeal, the ambiance and decor was just like I remember it at the old bagatelle- sexy/trendy/super-pretentious....so If that's the scene you're into then you'll L-O-V-E this place. In terms of the food, I thought it was just OK, nothing too special or out of the ordinary that's worthy of mentioning. I should mention though that their Bellini's are A-MA-ZING!The service is good, however I was a bit annoyed that we had to wait almost an hour to be seated at our table despite the fact that we had reservations for a specific time .... Yes, it was THAT packed!! I was also annoyed because I found myself shouting across the table on numerous occasions when I tried to talk with friends because the music was THAT loud! However, minor nuances aside, if you're into the wildly boisterous party/fine-dining scene then I'd definitely recommend dining here with your group of girl/guy friends. I would NOT recommend this place for the hopeless romantics out on a date- save the coquetry for a calmer establishment ;)Personally, I will come back here mainly for brunch and/or drinks, but I definitely will not come back to dine here unless on a whim!

I ordered Eggs Benedict and it was the best I've ever eaten. And I have that often. We ordered Mimosas to start. Daughter and her friend both had burgers and said they were perfect as well. The service was efficient, a tiny bit uppity.  After we ate lunch we started ordering the drink specials. I don't remembr what they all were, but liked them all. Around 3 the DJ starts. The music is mixed old school. It's soft to begin with. Each song he does the volume increases a unperceptable amount. Then by 4 it's starting to get louder and no one is eating anymore. They start pushing the tables around and then the Jeroboam and Methusalahs start coming out. When we left everyone was having a good time and it had an after hours feel. We hear that later they close big drapes and it is a full club in the afternoon. It was really hard to leave. I am not young or a partier. I had more fun here than anywhere in years.
