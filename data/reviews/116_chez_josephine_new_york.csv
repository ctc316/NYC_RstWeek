3.0,4/9/2019,"We dropped in to have a cup of tea and quick talk before our fried headed to the airport. We really had not much time and it was the closest cafe from his POD hotel.What to say, we ordered two cups of tea and two deserts (chocolate paradise and apple crepe pie). The weather was nice and we decided to sit outside. We spent good time with our friend which we haven't seen quiet a while, but the place itself did not leave good impression. We waited for our desert I think 20 min or around and they were sooo small, super-tiny portions for quiet expensive price. I didn't get any satisfaction from my cake, just teased my toungue buds and I became even more craving those crepes.Overall, place it very overpriced for this food and service.",0,0,0,Anna K.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,72,406
4.0,4/8/2019,"What a lovely restaurant! We missed our dinner reservation at Quality Meats because we took a long nap and woke up at 9pm on a Sunday evening but fortunately, chez Josephine opens until 11pm so they had late reservations available on opentable. When we went for our 10pm reservation, we were seated by the piano but missed the performance :( the runner told me the pianist plays until 9:30 on Sundays (noted!) However, the background music they were playing was very pleasant and suitable for the restaurant. The interior was cozy, romantic and eclectic. I ordered Folies bergère (grey goose, chambord, lychee) and my husband ordered the one with muddled berries (forgot the name). Both were good but mine was better. For food, we shared the escargots (traditional. Amazing!) and the steak tartare (served with chips and some greens) as appetizers; and the duck and the pork chops as entrees. The duck (husband's favorite) was cooked just right and the earthy taste of the wild rice balanced out the fattiness of the duck really well. The cooked oranges were sweet and paired well with the dish as well. The pork chops were huge and cooked to perfection. Came with scalloped potatoes and asparagus. The pork was so juicy! It was def my favorite. We ordered red wine to pair with our entrees. I asked for a taste of Medoc ($15) and chateau la courrone ($17) then chose chateau la courrone but the server brought the wrong one. I didn't mind Medoc so I didn't complain or anything but I really liked the other one so I know what to get next time! We also had cappuccino and profiteroles. The dessert wasn't that memorable.The service was pretty hands off which I liked but our runner (the guy with the glasses) was so so sweet. He recommended which nights are the best for the piano performance and such. I hope they promote him to a server! Anyway, we will definitely be back for some live music and amazing food.",0,0,0,Kristina P.,"BEECHHURST, NY",149,136,66
2.0,4/8/2019,"TLDR: Another unmemorable mediocre restaurant in the theater district. Weird eclectic menu that's not very French. NOT recommended. Overall rating: CIt was packed at 5:45pm on a Saturday. Easy OpenTable reservation. They serve each person a cold individual bread roll with ice cold butter (big no no). Service is ok. Standard mediocre theater district restaurant. Wish there were better options. We went here once last year as well. (Apparently I forgot to write a review the first time here. Let's just say it wasn't memorable either.) Here's what we tried:-Country paté, tangy celery remoulade, cornichons: Pretty good pate. A--Foie gras with truffles, with toast, balsamic vinegar, savory jam?, and cornichons: Special of the day. I really enjoyed this. You could taste the truffle flavor. The balsamic vinegar paired well with the pate. A--Roasted breast of Long Island duck, outage glaze, wild rice: The duck breast was overcooked but still tasty at least. They gave me a steak knife halfway through my meal... I wasn't a fan of the wild rice (which isn't really rice. It's a sea plant.) There are also a few cooked orange segments on the plate as well. B-Elvira's Down-Home Fried Chicken, sweet potato fries, blueberry cornbread: The WORST dish of the night! The breast was dry and flavorless. The thigh piece was a smidge better. The sweet potato fries were nice and crispy. The blueberry cornbread tasted like a sponge. AVOID! C-Halibut fish special of the day: I didn't personally try it but I heard it was very overcooked. N/A-Maryland Crab Cakes, tartar sauce, and field greens: I didn't personally try it but I heard it was decent. Small portion I thought. Mostly crab cakes and some salad. Not really a full meal in my opinion. N/A-Aperol spritz: Fairly sweet but decent. Not the best though. B-Rye Manhattan (Whiskey, sweet vermouth, bitters, and a cherry): They weirdly muddle the cherry so the drink is an unnatural red color. VERY sweet. AVOID! C-Live music at certain times if you're into that (later at night I think). The tables are so tightly packed together you may need to move the table out to get in at times. The servers are supposed to help you shift the tables but ours just watched as we did it ourselves. Wow So underwhelming. If it weren't right next door to my beloved Playwrights Horizons Theater with a mobility impaired person in our group we wouldn't return again. I'll stick with the pate and duck next time if I'm FORCED to come here again.  Pro Tip: Not great for mobility impaired either! Bathrooms are located upstairs or next door (no idea what they meant by next door). Also the restaurant is very narrow so if you're assisting someone while walking good luck! We get bumped, knocked, and stepped on the whole way out!",1,0,1,D D.,"Manhattan, NY",4,143,27
4.0,3/20/2019,"This place is a cute little restaurant with live musicians playing the piano, singing, or performing as a band. The general lighting is a bit dark with candlelights and you can immediately notice how red the walls are. The food is... okay. Being a restaurant on the pricier end, you would expect more of an explosion of flavor, but it was a bit underwhelming. They start you off with a bread roll and butter, but I think the rolls weren't that great. I went with two others and we ordered Black angus filet mignon, Spaghetti bolognese, and Elvira's down-home fried chicken. The filet mignon medium rare was SPOT ON. It was cooked just right and came with a side of fries. The spaghetti bolognese was good, but nothing special. Apparently this is ""Josephine's favorite"", but there was nothing that stood out about this dish that made it special. The Elvira's down-home fried chicken comes with blueberry cornbread and sweet potato fries. It's pretty delicious, but again, nothing about the chicken breading or how they cook it make it outstanding. While the service and atmosphere is good, the price-to-taste value isn't as great as expected. Still, for good food and live music, I'd say this is a cool option. :)",2,2,2,Amber K.,"East Amherst, NY",86,124,515

1.0,3/12/2019,"Today was the first time I had lunch at CJ. Unfortunately, I didn't have a good food experience. I ordered flank steak medium, however the steak I received was very rare, and extremely thickly sliced. Sent it back for another round on the grill but it was bleeding terribly. The thinly French fries and warm ciabatta bread were the only items that were edible. I had asked for burger and instead received an omelette. After receiving the look of death from floor manager, I was horrified and just didn't eat the omelette. This is definitely not your typical French fine dining, I've had better experiences than the one received today. The other French cuisine places serve appropriate small portion. Not here. Btw butter had a refrigerator taste which diminished the taste of the warm ciabatta bread. Again, I was given the look of death, not going to mention his name, but I felt I had to apologize for the inconvenience of receiving poorly cooked and awful tasting food. I was charged 100% did not tip and was never offered a waiver. To say the least, I did not enjoy my lunch and will not return to this place.",0,0,0,Brenda S.,"Bethesda, MD",77,2,3
4.0,3/11/2019,"Decided to give Chez Josephine another try, this time for price fixe brunch. Glad I did, the 3 course brunch was a great value with big portions, yummy food and good service. We opted for bloody marys (not included in $23 brunch), nicely spiked w/vodka and horseradish. Lobster bisque was creamy and rich but kinda bland IMHO. Spaghetti bolognese was loaded with nicely sauced chopped meat and such a big portion that I had to forego the profiterole dessert - sacrilege for me! Hubbie said his thickly cut french toast with fantastic, especially the large helping of fresh berries that came with. Service was very good at the beginning but slowed down a bit after a big group descended on the place.",2,1,2,Linda K.,"East Meadow, NY",64,188,49

4.0,3/5/2019,"Had a lovely dinner with a large group (8) friends. It was bustling Saturday evening in between matinee and evening performances. The restaurant was filling up quickly, but they were ready for us (we had reservations) without delay. The restaurant is close  but not cramped.  We were greeted warmly and promptly  by our server. Everyone had appetizers and I tasted the escargot that was really tasty and hot, great for dipping the nice crusty bread in the garlic butter. I had the country pate and it was very good and a very generous serving.For my entree I had the pork chop. I've had it there before and it was juicy and so big I was able to take half home! Everyone was delighted with the service and the meal. An added bonus was the fantastic pianist entertaining us with show tunes and standards.

4.0,2/17/2019,"Went into the City to see the new production of Fiddler on the Roof.  The show done in Yiddish carries a special emotional impact as it transports you to another time.  Seeking a post show dinner locale, I was please with Chez Josephine which is just one or two doors down from the theater.  This theater district fixture serves classical French food and with its decor harkens back to the glamor of Ms. Baker's time.  Though the restaurant was fully booked for dinner, the maitre d who may have remembered us from a prior visit, was happy to accommodate us.  Though the restaurant was full and the tables tightly packed, everyone seemed to have a good time and appeared to be enjoying their experience.  I had a special, the poussin in a margo sauce.  It was properly cooked, very tender and very tasty.  My dining companion had the lamb chops.  For appetizers we both had the escargot.  This has become rarer and rarer to find on menus but here in a buttery garlic were outstanding.  Tempted by dessert but too full to partake.  We could delicious looking creations at neighboring tables.  A fine meal to go with a fine show.",1,0,1,Stuart B.,"Brick, NJ",35,184,0
1.0,2/15/2019,Came in on Valentine's Day. When we booked they didn't tell us there was a limited menu to choose from. I had 1 drink and my fiancé had two. The drinks were disgusting. The menu that we were limited to was worst than the drinks. Total bill for both of us was over $300! The waiter even charged us for a 4th drink we didn't even have! The only reason I think this place has as many stars as it does cause the waiters are polite and the live band is good. Worst French food we ever had.,0,0,0,Kristy E.,"Teterboro, NJ",121,1,0
3.0,2/9/2019,"I have never tried a French restaurant, so for restaurant week I wanted to take advantage of the opportunity. My friends and I came for lunch, and the restaurant was pretty empty. I was the first to arrive and discussed a birthday celebration for my friend with the only server on staff. He told me if dessert is ordered a candle can be placed on top but there would be no singing from the staff. The server was pretty nonchalant about everything, didnt have a friendly air at all, but he was professional about everything which was fine. I ordered the foie gras and the steak from the restaurant week special. While we waited, we were given warm bread and slabs of butter.The foie gras was interesting. I didn't hate it but I didn't love it either. Just half the portion would have sufficed, as it was pretty heavy in texture and in taste. Now the steak was delicious. Meat was cooked to perfection and the sides were seasoned well. No complaints there. Lastly, we had dessert. Creme Brûlée. I wanted to like this but the way it was presented made it hard to. Most that I've seen had the sugar finely melted on top and not torched until black.Overall the food and experience was okay.",0,0,0,Sandy P.,"Queens, Queens, NY",56,96,205
5.0,2/9/2019,"I mean, this place is as authentic of an NYC experience as you can get - it's been open since 1983, and you can feel the history dining here. The food is terrific, and while the location is a bit off the beaten path, it's a popular spot for theater-goers that are in the neighborhood for a show. If you don't know the backstory of the restaurant, you'll feel as if it's a shrine to Josephine Baker covered in relics of her past (they usually even have a live pianist playing in the evenings) -- well, you wouldn't be wrong. The restaurant was started by one of Josephine Baker's adopted children; it was run by him up until a few years ago when he passed away, unfortunately.

4.0,2/2/2019,"I had a great night with Josephine! No seriously, Chez Josephine was definitely a hit. Chez Josephine is truly a great dining experience. The restaurant has a real artistic feel with its beautiful art of Josephine Baker placed throughout the restaurant. The designers of the restaurant took care to make sure the essence and spirit of Josephine could be seen, felt and admired. It's clear as you walk through the restaurant, the staff is committed to making sure each guest has a memorable experience. As I mentioned, the restaurant is extremely pleasing to the eye. Me and my guest was seated upstairs in a cozy room with delightful pictures of Josephine. My only concern was that our waiter was a bit aggressive and pushy. Beyond this, I enjoyed my meal and the beautiful music being pushed through the speakers. Chez Josephine is definitely a romantic place and I would highly recommend bringing back date or a close friend. Enjoy.",3,0,1,Percy H.,"Brooklyn, NY",445,248,524
5.0,2/2/2019,"Chez Josephine is a French Bistro that feels so authentic it's hard to believe that the restaurant is located between 9th and 10th  on 42nd Street. It's easy to miss the restaurant since it has a small awning and a narrow entrance but once inside, you are embraced by a beautiful bar, wonderfully welcoming French waiters, and depending on where you are sitting, you can be entranced by the gifted pianist or just saturated by the music.  For those reasons alone, you should consider making your reservations, however their menu and entries were so delicious that even if your are tone deaf, you'll be grateful to dine in such a classy establishment!",0,0,0,Arthur G.,"Scarsdale, NY",55,165,146

2.0,1/28/2019,"Our Party of 4 went to Chez Josephine for restaurant week. We had an 8 pm Broadway show to attend to and wanted to dine a couple hours early prior to attending the show. The ambiance was great with an in-house pianist at the main floor.I'm not sure if the establishment felt overwhelmed by the reservation of other people in line, but our main course did not arrive until 45 minutes later. I'm not sure what the reason was whether the kitchen was backed up or what, but I believe we were extremely patient to have waited that long while starving for dinner. Nevertheless we waited expecting good food to arrive. Unfortunately when it did, the quality and portion was subpar. I ordered the Squid Ink Tagliatelle under the $42 prix fixe. And for a pasta portion, this was probably just one cup in a plate, of which I could definitely have made better at home with an improved flavor. There wasn't even a salt and pepper shaker on the table for seasoning. And there was no time to hail someone busy to ask.By this time we only had 20 minutes to spare before the show starts. So we scarfed down our food and asked our server to please bring in the rest of the entrees (as some in my group hadn't received theirs) and serve it together with the dessert as well as the check. There was just no more time. Everywhere servers were tending to table after table who were also apparently waiting for their food. The place just became a madhouse. We ourselves had to finish quickly where at one point our server lost my credit card in the process, claiming I did not give it to him. The manager had to step in and find the card as well. And when they finally did, my group and I had to dash out to make it to our broadway show in time.Overall, this was probably the most stressful/hectic experience I've ever felt while dining - all because of a 45-minute food wait from the kitchen that tasted okay. My advice for other diners (I'll leave you to your own experience but) if anything, definitely expect to wait for your meal.",0,0,0,Tasha R.,"Jersey City, NJ",5,29,101

Fried chicken was dry and tasteless with soggy sweet potato fires, mushroom pasta was flavorless.   Just bad.  Looks like a sweet place.

After arriving the host disappeared and appeared to be replaced with a manager with a thick attitude, after 45 minutes of waiting around 7:15 I approached him with the intent of politely expressing that we had been waiting for our reservation for quite a while -- he cut me off after a word blowing me off saying ""you see all of these people they have reservations too."" No explanation or hospitality just sheer hostility. The host eventually returned and I have nothing but good things to say about him he seated us immediately and apologized.Drinks: Had some good albiet expensive cocktails at the bar while waiting. The ambiance was gorgeous and my friend and I were in no rush and enjoy eachothers company. I had the half bakers dozen with lime juice, and she had Wolford Manhattans.Bread and butter: a cold but good bread roll, I had to ask for butter after the server came around with a second helping of bread rolls. The butter was like land o lakes salted butter or what you get at hotels, it was basically white and stiff hard.Apps: We were seated and ordered almost immediately. She had the escargot in which salt was the most prominent seasoning besides then being quiet chewy. The French onion soup was brought to the table lukewarm and the soft cheese crusted and cold. We both had to ask for spoons for our apps as none were set nor provided with the apps.Entrees: The filet mignon was horribly over cooked I ordered medium rare I received it pretty much well done to the point that I requested a1 sauce to pair it as the gravy's main seasoning was salt. Her calf liver which was requested to be medium was charred and dry prepared in no seasoning and thick bacon thin slices. The liver was paired with oily string beans. My filet mignon was paired with what without a doubt were shoestring store bought fries which were the only thing that was not sheer salt.Overall this evening out at Chez Josephine was not worth our bill of $280 including the tips.",1,0,0,Liz S.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",0,39,1

These selzers were ordered after we paid our original tab.  I'm not looking for a freebie or saying that the darn seltzer should have been free, but, the attitude and the way the waiter was stalking was uncalled for and frankly embarrassing. Lastly, that $250 check was split and each of us unknowingly tipped , making his tip ridiculously above the 20% standard.

Although the seafood in the lobster cassoulet was good, there wasn't very much of it and the fish desperately needed something else - a side, perhaps some sort of carb like a pasta. I ordered fries on the side, which were fine, though they needed salt. My friend got the duck, which I'm told was very average.

My main dish was blackened sea bass, served on a bed of green and white beans, and red cabbage. The fish was cooked firm, and flaky. The beans had just a tad of crunch. This dish was also just about as good as it can be. I took the cheesecake dessert home and enjoyed it later. My glass of Pinot Noir was very clean tasting.

The bread was stale at the beginning and all the food lacked flavor and creativity. Being from around here Marseilles is a much better option hands down for your money.

Admittedly, it was rich, but clearly that's what we were in the mood for! My only critique was that the escargots were prepared in a green sauce (similar in flavor to pesto).

For a Wednesday night it was relatively empty.  As a patron of many many years I unfortunately will cross this off my NYC restaurant list of go to places to dine. Putting all else aside the food was pretty awful.  Returned my steak at the price of $39 three times and ordered chicken which was equally awful.  They ran out of bread and gave us an old hard roll. My husband stopped eating his meal each time my dish was changed.  His pork chop was thin and quality I would never purchase at home.  One waiter told me there was a new chef.  Our waiter did not compensate for any of our issues.  I could have gotten a better meal at Applebees.

4.0,2/27/2018,"Chez Josephine celebrates the life of Josephine Baker. As far as I can remember reading a while back, it is run by two of her sons. It is located on Theatre Row. We arrived very late on a Thursday afternoon for lunch. There was nobody to greet us and there were no servers to be seen. It was almost dead empty except for one guy on his cell phone at the bar, another person behind the bar (presumably the bartender), and a couple of tables filled with what looked like their regular customers. My cousin and I were greeted by a chef and then by the aforementioned bartender who then became our host and then our server. More likely than not, he was unhappy that we came when it was supposed to be his time to relax before dinner service. He was a little aggressive and looked annoyed at best. Initially, I received a menu which should have been out of circulation because it was from the NYC Restaurant Week. Thankfully, my cousin didn't and so we were able to tell him that I had received the incorrect menu and this was quickly rectified, of course, without any explanation or apology as that would be very un-New York like. She ordered a salmon lunch whereas I went with the prix-fixe as it was my first of the many meals I was about to have in New York for my ""food-cation"" and so I got the mushroom soup - probably their soup du jour, a monkfish entree atop what I presume was a red wine and celery reduction, and before I could place the order for my dessert, he snatched the menu out of my hands and said he would come back to take the order for the dessert. Soup du jour aka mushroom soup was absolutely divine. I am not sure if they drizzled it with truffle oil or if they had olive oil on top which had been infused with mushrooms. Regardless, it was absolutely one of the best mushroom soups I have ever had. The monkfish looked greated and it tasted absolutely amazing. It's like Gordon Ramsay describes it as being a watery fish that needs to have moisture taken out prior to prep. Whoever the chef was here, did a fantastic job of salting it prior to cooking as there was no water seeping out of it while it rested a top of a leafy-esq crunchy base. I am not sure what my dessert was as my cousin placed the order for it from my prix-fixe order. I was so full and barely tasted the circular raspberry dessert. Overall, I highly recommend this place. I do not, however, recommend that bar tender with an attitude. I would rather have Nene Leakes be my server. At least it'll be entertainment with a dash of sass.",2,0,2,Zain R.,"Houston, TX",275,416,1266

And while it was nice to have live piano music on Sunday, you would think that the music would have something to do with Josephine Baker, or at least her era. But it was more Billy Joel and stuff you were hear at Nordstrom. On top of that, our service was definitely sub par. Anytime I needed a refill of water or coffee, I had to call someone over.

We came during restaurant week and the deal was really good for $42, appetizer, entree, dessert.  For my appy, I had the foie gras terrine and BF had french onion soup. His was probably the better choice only because the terrine was too much for one person.  And also, his soup was delicious on a cold winter day! For my entree, I had the monk fish and it was cooked perfectly and was super tasty with some french, fattening, butter sauce that I wanted to lick off the plate (didn't).  BF had the poussin (spring chicken) and it looked like a meager portion but there was veggie and potato so it was more filling than it looked. One slightly negative was a dessert issue. BF ordered dessert when waiter was taking the initial food order and then they ran out of it. OOPS!  But the waiter offered something that wasn't on the prixe fixe and it was probably better than what he was going to order.  Possibly, but we'll never know, will we?  The decor was all abut Josephine Baker and I read up on her and about the restaurant before we went and it was definitely an interesting story, but with a sad ending (read for yourself).

I was glad they didn't tell me that I couldn't be sealed without the rest of my party.Decor is unique, cozy atmosphere with a live pianist. We order a la carte as well, my friend tried their lobster bisque, we ordered the escargot to share.For the restaurant week, 3 of us ordered the foie gras, my friend ordered butter lettuce, lentils, arugula salad. Foie gras was tasty, it was smooth like butter, I couldn't have used a few more pieces of toast. Entrees, 3 of us ordered the beef cheeks, my fiancée ordered the poussin. He enjoyed the poussin, said it was delicious. The beef cheeks sauce were too salty for me but the meat was tender, it is like beef ribs where it is easy to chew and it falls right off the bone. Dessert, 3 os us ordered the blackcurrant mascarpone, it was delicious, there was a layer of the blackcurrant and it was tarty! (It is a compliment). My friend had the Bombe Glacee Pralinee, that was delicious as well, every bit was filled with praline taste.Their wine selection looks great as well!

The desserts were priced at $12 each, and were not particularly amazing. They were also VERY small - complete scam as far as the desserts go. However, the service was very good.

5.0,12/9/2017,"We wanted to dine somewhere special for our last evening in NYC so I did a little research and selected Chez Josephine. It turned out to be an excellent choice! The atmosphere is that of a cute French Bistro with live piano music played by the same musician for decades (although he looks much younger than his years)!The restaurant was quite full and buzzing so we asked for a quieter space and was accommodated by taking us to a small room in the back. Later in the evening the piano player had dinner in that room and we had quite an interesting conversation. We began with a first course of Lobster Bisque. Although it wasn't the best I've ever had, it was still good. We then split an order of Escargot which was presented in pools of melted butter, garlic and parsley. Each bite was divine. We both selected the same entree (we hardly ever do that) but we couldn't resist the Duck L'Orange. We have actually prepared the dish ourselves but it had been years since we've had it. Although served differently, it was a delightful dish. The chef had cooked duck breast to perfection and glazed it in a light orange sauce. What is nice about this restaurant is that the portions are small enough that it allows the diner to ""experience"" a full French dining experience and not leave stuffed or gorged. Of course we ended the evening sharing a dessert of chocolate mousse.  It was so rich and dark chocolatey, I wasn't sure I'd fall asleep that night so I had a cup of Chamomile Tea.

It's such a lovely room, utterly devoid of any food worth talking about. All of us were disappointed by every single course we got, and made liberal use of the salt shaker to try to get something out of it.Most egregious for me was the ""lobster cassoulet"" which betrayed both words in its title. There was a bit of claw in it, I think (it certainly didn't have enough taste for me to be completely sure), but it was not remotely a cassoulet. If they'd called it a bouillabaisse or a cioppino, I'd be okay with it (the name, not the food, which was tasteless), but some pieces of seafood in a thin tomatoey broth with some undercooked black beans floating around it in does not remotely resemble a cassoulet.But at least they got us out there quickly so we didn't miss the curtain.

4.0,7/3/2017,"Made reservations for me and my boyfriend before our Broadway show.  Had a lovely experience at Chez Josephine. We got great seats right in front of the piano. It could get a little loud. Tables are very close together so you can hear what your neighbors are saying.  The place is very busy. The service was excellent and quick. I think they are used to the quick turn over since people are trying to catch shows. We had  the steak tartare, roasted red & golden beets, rack of lamb and fillet mignon everything was delicious.  When you walk in you feel like you are teleported back to the 1920s. The ambiance was festive with the opulent décor. It's on the expensive side.  It is a fun and classy dining experience without having to really dress up. With so many restaurants in the theatre district Chez Josephine is definitely worth checking out. 4 stars!",9,3,5,Maria M.,"San Francisco, CA",1591,298,2261

5.0,6/22/2017,"My boyfriend brought me here for my birthday dinner. Things I love: French food, live piano, good ambiance, good service. He chose well.  This place was perfect in all regards. The only thing that didn't reach perfection was the food -- the food is definitely good but it's not anything stellar. But don't come here for the food -- come here for ambiance, service, and live piano. The winning point of this place is ambiance. So, so romantic.  So French.  The decor makes you feel like you have stepped straight into the film Midnight in Paris. When it was time to leave, I didn't want to leave and go back to reality.  Our service was excellent. We were greeted with warm smiles and happy people all night long.  They seated us at the back table with the piano right in front of us. We were able to chat with the pianist and make song requests, which was lovely.  (I was surprised to read reviews talking about bad service -- must be dependent on the time and luck.)The pianist + the piano/sax duo that came in later were lovely.  They played Edith Piaf and old Rat Pack and Ella classics all night long, plus originals.  My pork chop was solid and tasty; my boyfriend's artisinal pasta was overcooked and mediocre. But the chocolate mouse dessert was delicious. Again though, we were too busy relishing the ambiance and music to notice.I hate Midtown and all the theater restaurants, but I adore this place, and will definitely be back to step back in time, hang at the bar, or hang with the pianist in the back table.",0,0,0,Kaitlyn R.,"New York, NY",0,7,0

2.0,5/21/2017,"I had high hopes for this restaurant. Its adorably decorated but the food was sub par and the service less than desirable. The seating is also superrrrrr cramped, quite frankly the space is too small for any restaurant, no less a French restaurant charging the prices they do. We were seated at a two seater table where my chair was literally in the small aisle the waiters bumped into every time they walked past. The couple next to us even turned and commented on how small the space was and how cramped they were so I know its not just me who felt like this. The food was okay - the dinner rolls were cold and hard as a rock. For my entree I got duck. I love duck, I've had duck in dozens of restaurants and the duck here was just ... bad. It was chewy and had fat and I just wasn't a fan. For a French restaurant that is over thirty years old I expected much better. For dessert I got the sorbet, it was two small scoops for $11 which I thought was gravely overpriced. The waiter also wasn't that attentive.

1.0,5/14/2017,"A beautiful setting for Mother's Day Brunch, complete with piano player. How romantic! We came at noon, a twenty minute wait for tasteless Bloody Marys, and then weren't served our meal until 1 pm, and if we hadn't complained might still be waiting--after we had said we had theater tickets for 2 pm. The Parisian Omelette was boring with chunks of flavorless ham and seemed to be missing the cheese. French fries were skinny and underdone. The Eggs Benedict came on untoasted (or barely-toasted English muffins). The rolls were definitely left over from the night before and it's rare in a French-style restaurant to have tasteless butter, but somehow they managed to serve it. Everything would have been sent back except for our need to get to the theater. We did complain, however, and they took the Eggs Benedict off the bill. Who cared?

4.0,4/13/2017,"Very much enjoyed the experience here! I went during restaurant week in February so the menu I had might be different than what is usually here. I ordered these mushroom ravioli for the appetizer and they were ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. I was disappointed that they were so tiny and there wasn't more! If they had a larger dish of these, I would certainly order it. I also got the Chez Josephine bolognese, which was good. Not outstanding, but not as plain as some people here described it. Finally, I got the lava cake for dessert. It was probably one of the best lava cakes I've ever had! VERY rich chocolate. If you're not a huge fan of chocolate, this might be slightly overwhelming. But I LOVED it. The place itself was very dark, but cozy, and had a lot of abstract, and red, decor. There was a live pianist/singer, but it was rather difficult to hear him. I didn't find that he had the best voice, and would probably have preferred it if he just played the piano, but it was still nice to have live music.The only thing that might hold me back from returning is the price.

They placed us next to the piano which banged away like some demented cruise ship performer so we couldn't hear each other. Then the waiters whipped our plates away like the place was on fire. At one point my friend was still on her appetizer when they brought around the entrees so they spun around and took the plates back in. We were all working on our main course, some finished, others didn't. Well those finished plates were gone before we even put our forks down. The place was only half full then at 8:30. What was the rush? I had the onion soup -okay, fried chicken - dry and uninspired with limp sweet potato fries and a thimble-sized ramekin of cabbage and blueberry cornbread that had the consistency and taste of  dried tofu, and the finale, profiteroles that were stale and dried. Really really stale. The bill was plopped down while we were just starting on the coffee. This place has really gone downhill.

It was NOT too loud, it was pleasant to sit close to, and we were still able to have a regular-toned conversation at the table. He plays the birthday song when a birthday dessert comes out...which we could tell was annoying to him because he would be stopped in the middle of a song to do it. Tip him well...he adjusts to please others and takes requests. He's kind and personal with you if you say hello. We loved the wine! It was a French blend of merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon: Chateau Coucheroy. We finished a bottle and wanted more.

The only reason I am giving this place two stars is because the decor is absolutely beautiful and there was a pianist. I will preface by saying that my party of three dinned here on a Sunday evening. The GOOD: 1. Decor 2. Live musicThe BAD: 1. The piano music was so loud it was intolerable. 2. The waiters hand out cold, stale, dinner rolls - why even bother ?! 3. SERVICE: The apps and main courses were brought out at the SAME TIME, which is fine if we were asked by the waiter how we wanted the food brought out. The waiters also never re-filled our water/drinks. After we finished eating a waiter rushed to clean our table off- why? I don't know it wasn't busy. His rush turned into the greasy, garlicky, escargot fork falling into my (designer) purse. 4. It was SO HOT inside. I mean like 80 degrees. 5. FOOD: Dinner rolls aside, I've enjoyed my experience at the Olive Garden more. French onion soup - extremely salty, the bread within the soup was so hard and stale I couldn't break it apart with the spoon Escargot- wasn't bad, but it was dry - barley any oil in the wells. Asian wontons with goat cheese- OH MY. Clearly filling wasn't mixed after it was seasoned and put into wantons. I got a faint mouth full of salt with the first wonton. Decided to go for a second - surprise it wasn't salty. Filet- GOOD quality, but I've worked in the restaurant biz.

For us it was fine...even though we were cramped but we weren't in the noisy front room and not on top of other diners. The four of us went again last night and again as a walk in so we got the same table which we were happy about. The service was excellent but that's where the similarity stopped. The food was just OK. The rolls were not warm as they usually were. My husband's chicken dish lacked flavor, my brother-in-law's fried chicken was dry and my sister's and my lamb dish was nothing special, a bit tough and covered in sauce. Even the piano playing was lacking. He was good but most of his music was modern jazz, not what I find for easy background music.

The Long Island duck was a bit mediocre, as the meat seemed to be over cooked, this lack of some chewiness.

After we sat down, we noticed two out of the five classes were lipstick stained very obviously. We asked the waiter if we could change them out for clean glasses and with a huff and an irritable sigh, he snatched the glasses from us and returned with two clean glasses. We ordered five or six dishes to share family-style: the Bolognese spaghetti was decent, the penne pasta dish was tiny in size but the taste was good. For appetizers we ordered escargot which was fine, and the Chinese ravioli was a laughable joke. It was as if they threw them in a pot, then tossed them in the sauce-filled plate and brought them over. Three out of the 5 pieces were still stuck together as we tried to serve them to each other. The bread was decent, just pretty hard and tough to bite through, but a good tasting dinner roll. When they brought us share plates, mine had food stuck to it. I asked another server for a clean plate, and he just took it like it was a normal request. My sister said it used to be better...it was her recommendation and I was excited to try. I will definitely not be back. Too many great places in New York to give this another shot.Oh, and the piano player was good, but I felt like he was auditioning instead of creating dinner music.

5.0,9/30/2016,"What a rare and wonderful restaurant  - - Chez Josephine has been around for quite some time and they have honed the art of hospitality to perfection.  I had guests in from out of town, a chic and select Flemish Belgian woman and her All American husband (who sadly has an early onset form of you know what).  The team at Chez Jo gave us a private, discreet round table up front by the door and then very graciously let me switch to the other discreet round table in the window that was slightly warmer. Other restaurants would never have accommodated my wishes.  They bring fresh out of the oven gougeres (puffy cheese classic french starter) that were like miniature popovers and gave us plenty of time to make selections.  My Belgian friend was thrilled to discover Boudin Noir on the menu and even more delighted by the execution of said dish - - she point blank said it tasted properly french/belgian and was not adulterated by odd (German, for example) spices.  Another friend had the Josephine signature spaghetti bolognese and was delighted to find that they make it without cheese as she is lactose intolerant.  Yes, we were a melting pot of cosmopolitan (yet 'needy') guests tonight and the warm, gracious service, the solidly good french food (or down home fried chicken for those who hate french food), the comfortably chic yet grown-up atmosphere with retro live piano together made for that hard to come by result - - natural happiness. Many many mercis to the team at Chez Josephine for everything.  I am truly grateful.",0,0,0,cel l.,"New York, NY",5,16,0

My wife and I arrived around 6:30 for an 8:00 pm performance nearby and never felt rushed from cocktails through dessert. The waitstaff are very well trained. The food is French and very good. Things you might not find frequently are welcome and delicious, e.g., pâté de campagne, boudin noire (blood sausage), steak tartare and calf's liver. Trout almondine was excellent, as was a frozen espresso parfait. A perfectly made martini should also be mentioned.

4.0,8/15/2016,"This was part of the NYC Summer restaurant week series.  It was our fellows first night out together and so we chose to go French! Restaurant week is a week where participating restaurants will give a 3-course fixe prix lunch or dinner and allow people to try various parts of their menu without blowing their wallet.  For NYC however, they like to make it long as this was a three-week series!  There was a gruyere popover for the table, but my 3-courses included the following:-escargots-fried soft-shell crab-coconut panna cotta with passion fruit sauceGruyere Popover: PROS-very light and airy, but not too airy where there isn't any sustenance to the dish-great flavors: not overwhelmingly cheesy but a good amount of Gruyere was placed to bring out the flavor-not super greasyCONS-too small for such a delicious treat.  I think I could have popped the whole thing into my mouth and swallowed it in one bite.--------Escargots: snails in a parsley garlic butter sauce.  It's not really a sauce as it is melted garlic butter, but that's what makes it so darn good!PROS-fantastic quantity, definitely shareable or tryable if majority of people haven't eaten snails before-good flavor: the not overwhelmingly garlicky but more importantly, not too much parsley-tons of leftover garlic butter which is great for dipping bread into, like french baguette slicesCONS-slightly on the salty end, but I feel like this has been consistent with all the escargots dishes that I've tried so this may just be how the dish is.--------Fried Soft-shell CrabPROS-it's a whole crab.  If they had served me half a crab, I don't think this would have even made it to two stars-good flavors in the batter: well balanced without one flavor overpowering the other-carb-less: it's served with vegetables but I like there aren't any carbs on the plate, especially when there is a never-ending bread basket for the tableCONS-the breading was soggy.  Breading should be crispy, at least on a fried soft shell crab.  If it's soggy it just means it was sitting in its own oil after being fried for awhile.--------Coconut Panna Cotta with Passion Fruit SaucePROS-very light and not heavy, smooth consistency with no lumps-the passion fruit is a nice way to round out a heavy meal, especially with the escargots and the crab.CONS-none really.  It didn't blow me away but it was a good solid panna cotta.I'd totally come back again, especially for the escargots.  There's something about hot garlic butter sauce with bread that just sounds so ridiculously fulfilling.",4,0,1,Vera L.,"Manhattan, NY",300,269,504
3.0,8/13/2016,"I'm rating this restaurant based on the Restaurant Week Dinner Menu. My friend was craving some escargot, so we decided on this place for our restaurant week meal. For my three courses, I had escargot, flank steak, and panna cotta. The escargot was the best part of the meal for me. My steak was ordered medium, but It was a little too rare for my liking. It also lacked seasoning and presentation. It was simply a raw slab of steak and some fries. The panna cotta was decent, but strange for a french restaurant to offer. I was hoping they'd have some french dessert options.Ambiance was the best part! The restaurant itself is tucked away on 42nd, but once you find it, you're transported back to a ""Moulin Rouge"" or ""Midnight in Paris"" type feel. The lighting is dim, the art is vast, and the piano music serenades you throughout the meal. Our waiter was nice as well. We had plenty of water and time to enjoy our meal. The only thing is, they really allow you to sit and enjoy here...so if you're in a hurry, you'll have to be persistent about getting the check. Thus, I wouldn't recommend coming her pre-theater. Overall, a decent experience at Chez Josephine. I was bulled over by the food, but the interior feel may be enough to bring me back to try it again.",0,0,0,Marelle C.,"Manhattan, NY",192,154,0

4.0,6/29/2016,"This night was originally planned as an Italian meal followed by Jersey Boys, but when we discovered Les Mis was leaving broadway, we decided to see it before it left.  As we switched to a musical with French themes, so too did our dinner switch to French themes.  We are a themey couple.I have to admit, Chez Josephine was not the best french restaurant I have ever eaten at and did not come close enough to the best to be considered a peer.  If you're looking for a better French restaurant, Simone is a great choice.  However, if you want a very good, and more moderately priced, French dinner before a show, then you cannot go wrong with Chez Josephine.Firstly, it is an adorable restaurant.  Intimate and romantic with good lighting and spacing between the tables.  A piano player was going the entire time, and as it was Saturday night on theatre row, he played all show tunes, which was a nice touch.  Service is top notch, though we waited a bit long for the server to take our order, the meal was still timed perfectly.I had trouble deciding between the Berkshire Pork Chop or the Long Island Duck Breast.  I had duck already once or twice in the weekend, and the previous times were excellent, and I didn't want to press my luck.  However, when I asked for a recommendation, I was pushed to the duck.  Unfortunately though, it was disappointing, but probably because my expectations were so high.  I enjoyed it - the chef certainly knows how to cook duck - but it just wasn't what I had come to expect from duck in a french restaurant.  A bit dry, and not quite as flavorful as I would have expected.  Again, still enjoyable, just not the best.  Not perfect.  The rolls that they serve with the food also tasted a bit generic, but who besides me and my girlfriend make the free bread service an integral part of a meal?On the other hand, my girlfriend got their special - I want to say sea bass - and this was phenomenal.  She ordered right.  In fact, as soon as I heard the server tell us the specials, I almost changed my mind.  She gave me a few bites of hers, and they were mouth watering.  If they have sea bass (assuming I'm right, but you'll have to read Melissa Z's review), you should definitely order that.We also got a couple of drinks, which were very good though I only remember them being good.  Don't quite remember what I got.  For dessert, we got a creme brulee, and I have to say, outside of my girlfriend's creme brulee, which is the best I have ever had, this was the best, or at least one of the best.  Thick caramelized crust, creamy, delicious creme.  Its the dessert to get.So, 4 stars.  Excellent, respectable, but could have been a bit better on the entree.  Certainly worth a visit.",5,1,3,Todd B.,"St. Petersburg, FL",191,531,1101

The blueberry cornbread I have found to be hit and miss, but, its such a small component of the dish.The pasta dish is simple, yet, very flavorful.

I'm not sure if the chef was trying to achieve a rustic dish, but he went about it all wrong. My boyfriend's lobster bisque was very bland, but his scallops were quite good since they weren't charred and were well seasoned. The service was severely lacking. We kept having to flag down our waiter for water and wine refills since they went empty for much longer than they should have. I felt as though we were forgotten.

3.0,11/28/2015,"Moulin Rouge - I felt like I was dining on a theater stage for Moulin Rouge. Sitting in this cozy and romantic brasserie featuring live piano bar, red-velvet curtains and many wall frames of a female dancer, I became curious about the owner and a background story about this restaurant and questioned myself who 'Josephine' is. *Chez Josephine was opened in 1983 by Jean-Claude Baker, a French American restaurateur and the owner of Chez Josephine. He named the restaurant in honor of his adoptive mother, Josephine Baker, who was one of the most popular dancers/singers in France in the 1920s. Josephine, also known as ""Black Pearl,"" was the first black woman who gained fame globally and was notable for her contribution to the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. With a belief that children from different ethnicities and religions could become a good family, Josephine adopted 12 children (she named ""The Rainbow Tribe"") from various countries, including France, Morocco, Korea, Japan, Columbia, Philippines, France, Israel, Algeria and Venezuela. Mr. Baker was one of the adopted sons. In 1993, he also published a biography of Josephine, titled ""The Hungry Heart.""   *Since its opening (In the 1980s, the 42nd street was known as the city's red-light district), Chez Josephine has become the beloved pre/post-show dining & bar by many theater goers. Its regular included several celebrities including Billy Joel and Jacklyn Kennedy Oasis. It was said that Mr. Baker came to Chez Josephine at least 5 days a week to greet new customers and charm his long-time friends. Unfortunately, we can't see him at Chez Josephine anymore. He was found dead in January 2015 in an apparent suicide, after many years that he had suffered from depression.I should have visited this place earlier so that I could meet and say hello to Mr. Baker. Glad that Chez Josephine remains open after the death of the owner. I might re-visit sometime soon again and enjoy the interior and live jazz music, in memory of Mr. Baker.",8,0,5,Somin Y.,"Manhattan, NY",127,207,65

But not anymore, it's somewhat embarrassing to bring a date there. After being seated, no acknowledgment, no menus, nothing for like 5 mins on a slow night. I have to raise my hand and ask for some service. I guess once you off on the wrong foot, everything is going down from that point. We ordered duck breast and calf's liver, the waiter didn't ask for doneness. There's sand in the spinach, I'm a rare to medium-rare kind of guy, liver was under cook even for me. The taste was just mediocre. With so many new restaurants open in Hells's kitchen that have better service and food. It's hard for me to justify spending money here again.

The food was delicious and the portions were larger than what one would typically get during RW. I got the pea soup which was not cream based so it tasted fresh and healthy. For my main dish I ordered the skirt steak that came with french fries. The steak was tasty but a little too pink for my liking even when I asked for medium well. The fries were skinny, salty and delicious. Dessert was my favorite course. The ""Chocolate Heaven"" was a yummy mousse. Highly recommended. The ambiance is absolutely charming with its charming decor and the piano player. Even the bathrooms upstairs were well decorated! The servers were nice and were helpful with the wine selection.

4.0,6/21/2015,"If you are on the Westside near 42nd Street and don't mind a bit of a stroll to ninth avenue, you won't be disappointed here. The decor has a dated neo-classical patina giving it the feel of a cafe you'd might happen upon while browsing along the side streets behind Sacra Cour. I could recommend the sliced duck breast and wild rice, the Maryland crab cakes were also rich with crab meat and had a slight spicy heat to the taste. We also ordered the sweet potato fries as a side dish. Nothing remarkable over the frozen ones you can easily prepare at home. We followed with ""Chocolate Heaven"" for dessert which didn't disappoint as the bitter sweet chocolate mousse had a delightful creamy texture and deep chocolate flavor. The noise level was average given it was a Saturday evening. The service was prompt and courteous. I am definitely going to bookmark this place.",1,0,0,Joe C.,"Bronx, NY",1,94,0

2.0,3/15/2015,"In a nutshell, chez Josephine missed the mark. I chose chez Josephine for my anniversary dinner with my girlfriend. It also happened to be restaurant week, which was an added bonus...or so I thought. The decor was interesting, but both of us felt it was tacky more than anything. The restaurant week menu was boring, so we ended up ordering off the regular menu. That was disappointing, because the whole point of restaurant week is to be able to experience fine dining at less than fine dining costs. Though, it was our anniversary so I didn't mean spending more money... if the food was worth it.For an appetizer we split the Chinese Ravioli with Fresh Goat Cheese, Roasted Pine Nuts. It was very good, but the portion was minuscule, and for 14 dollars, could have put a few more on the plate. My girlfriend ordered the Elvira's Down Home Fried Chicken with  Sweet-Potato Fries, Blueberry Corn Bread. The chicken was okay, but not the best we've had.  The sweet potato fries were good, but c'mon, they're fries! I will say that we both agreed that the blueberry cornbread was very good, but that should not have been the focal point of the meal.I ordered the Choucroute Royale which was Smoked Pork Loin, Veal Sausage, Frankfurter, Double-Smoked Bacon, Pork Knuckles, Boiled Potatoes, Champagne-Braised Sauerkraut. Now I will admit that I am no connoisseur of sausages (please hold the jokes) but I have had better similar dishes at german and polish restaurants of much lesser esteem. I've never eaten pork knuckle and actually naively complained to my waiter that this piece of meat was ""all fat"" oops...We skipped desert, because honestly for the money spent, adding another 35 bucks for average quality food, was not something we wanted to do. I think the bill came out to 100 bucks (we didnt drink) which I felt was worth about half to 3/4's of that.  The two stars, are purely for the ambiance, that despite its borderline tacky nature was still romantic. The pianist is a nice touch, but not enough to make up for everything else.We walked away dissatisfied in terms of the quality of the things we ate, and the overall notion of experiencing french cuisine. We will not be returning.",4,3,1,Evan S.,"Bronx, NY",65,191,13

2.0,3/5/2015,"I made reservations to go here about a week ago after a long search on yelp for a nice French restaurant to eat at for Restaurant Week. I chose this place mainly for their Restaurant Week menu options. One of the requirements in my search was escargot. I've had delicious escargot in Montreal, Canada. Which was over a year ago, so I was excited to have it again.I dined here last night with 5 of my friends. Before the night started, I received a call from the restaurant in the afternoon to confirm my reservation. The lady was very nice and she spoke in French. I thought this place was very professional and friendly. When I first got there, I thought, ""hey this place is pretty nice."" The ambiance was very relaxing and cozy. The lighting was dim and there was a live pianist playing and singing. I arrived 15 minutes before my  7:30PM reservation and 3 of my friends were waiting by the bar. We were escorted upstairs to our table almost immediately after I arrived. It was a lot more quiet up there than downstairs where the pianist was. My friends and I engage in conversation, and of course we always joke around so we end up laughing quite loudly. We felt a little awkward because it was so quiet at the tables around us. Still we enjoyed our selves while we waited for the last friend to arrive. The waiter or bus boy came by and placed glasses on our table and gave us menus. The table was set nicely, admittedly a little off center. The glasses were placed oddly, not in their rightful place setting. The person who came by to fill the glasses with water missed a glass. Then came back a few moments later to ask if this was an extra glass...When the last friend in our party finally arrived, we were ready to order. The waiter walks in and out of the room not noticing that we were ready to order. The other guy, maybe bus boy came buy to offer us bread again. Even though we told him no thank you the first time. He was also told that we were ready to place our order. It did not seem like he knew what we were saying.The waiter finally came over and we placed our order. The first course arrived maybe 10-15 minutes later. 5 of us got the escargot and 1 ordered the Lobster bisque. The escargot was mediocre at best. Was not as good as I had expected. The Lobster Bisque was just okay. The main course came, I ordered the braised short rib. It came with decorative greens that looked dry and not fresh. Even though I did not eat that it should have at least looked appetizing or appealing. The shortrib was not flavorful at all and the side 2 onion rings and cornmeal were not that tasteful either. The other dishes, salmon, and the truffle pasta were okay as well. None of the dishes were amazing.  Highly disappointed.I was excited for the Lemon Tart Brulee.  That came out okay as well. It was topped with whipped cream. My first bite was extremely SOUR even with whipped cream. Five of us order that and one ordered the Profiterole au Chocolat, that was good according to my friends.All in all, this meal was an okay experience. The food not so memorable. After we left the restaurant, $53 poorer, we all went home. All of my friends who ordered the escargot reported feeling stomach pain and nausea.

I would get better bolognese with a much cheaper price. My friend tried the restaurant week menu, her ribs were plain too. Honestly the price wasn't reflecting the value at all.None of us liked our soups. Their lobster bisque was very salty and my butternut squash soup was way too sour.The dessert was probably the best part.

I order the escargot, mushroom/truffle oil pasta and lemon tart for dessert. The escargot was pretty tasty, and I used up my bread roll to soak up the delicious oil/pesto on the bottom. The pasta was SUPER disappointing. It was so bland and tasteless that I added a large amount of salt and cheese just to make it more savory. And no, it did not help. Last but not least the lemon tart was good. I usually gravitate towards getting something lemony because I dont like chocolate mousse cake. It was a good amount of sour and sweet.  Otherwise, I would come back in the future and order from their regular menu and maybe that will change my mind about this place.

To make matters worse, the owner himself actually raised his voice and yelled at us when we replied that we did indeed have a reservation.

The deep red and blue color scheme as well as the giant red chandeliers really make it quite regal and beautiful. The paintings covering the walls are also quite impressive. 5 stars for ambience and decor alone......!! A live pianist provided an intimate setting for the restaurant. Perfect touch for this place. And he had a nice selection of songs (played Stevie Wonder, a fave). We sat directly in front of him and still engaged in conversation. I didn't think the music was too loud. I ordered the French Onion Soup ($10) and The Blackened Atlantic Salmon ($24). The soup was okay (as it is a must-order every time I dine at a French restaurant), I've had better, but I would order it again. Loved the Salmon! It was served with Julienned Vegetables, which reminded me of pasta but a vegetable version. The portion was generous, and a very good option if you're a healthy eater. There is a Pre-Fixe dinner option as well. For $38, one can choose between a soup, salad, or appetizer; one of three entree options, and a dessert. My friend ordered this and she raved about her fish (sole) with couscous main entree choice.We ordered a bottle of wine for $46. Service was good.

I went with my girlfriends to try the restaurant week menu. For apetizer, I had Escargots à la Bourguignon ne, which was very oily and cheesy, the snail was bland by itself, the oil and cheese amplifies the sliminess, making it very unappetizing. For entree, I got the Crispy Soft Shell Crab Tempura. The entire dish was luke warm. The cos cos was dry and flavorless. the soft shell crab looked very nice but when I bit into it, it was soft with a bitter and sour taste as if the crab had started to rot. It did not have an anticipated crunchy exterior as tempura should. Clearly it sat under the heat lamp or in the kitchen for much too long. My friends got the spaghetti dish. The flavor was good but the spaghetti turned out undercooked. It was hard.

Larger than life paintings of Ms. baker.  A fantastic jazz pianist.  There were even two women dressed as classy majorettes at the bar spinning tales about their families' escapes from the carnival.  The waitstaff was excellent.  Personable, attentive, and charming.  I stuck to the restaurant week menu, which I was very happy with.  My husband had more traditional french dishes, including pate and blood sausage.  Both of which he was content with as he felt they were authentic representations of what he would back home in France.  He loved it.  Treat yourself and enjoy.  Knock off a bottle of wine, too!",2,0,0,Colleen D.,"New York, NY",63,50,5

3.0,6/1/2014,"Had a dinner with friends and loved it - the atmosphere, the live music downstairs (we were up) and the service was truly excellent - we felt that we were in a small Parisian bistro. Together we tried a variety of things from Belgian endive with Roquefort and walnuts, to lobster bisque, cold watercress soup, calves liver, profiteroles aux glaces and a variety of other things that were all good. Had two bottles of an excellent Cabernet (after tasting a couple of others).Outstanding - but why not 5 stars? Because we didn't notice until we were leaving that the restaurant has a ""C"" sanitary rating as of their last inspections (29 points in November 2013, 56 points May 2014 - the lower the number the better! Having looked up the results of that inspection (you can download a free app to check out any restaurant in NYC) we won't be back until they have improved to an A rating. A rating, 0-13 points, B rating 14-27, C rating 28+ points.

2.0,5/2/2014,Great decor and ambiance with original portrait paintings of the famous Josephine Baker and a large framed vintage poster of one of her movies displayed on the walls. Jean-Claude Baker did say hello when I first entered and the piano player in the back was good. The bartender was super friendly and that helped. Presentation of the food was excellent but I wasn't too impressed by the taste. The downside of my very first chance to try this restaurant tonight was the wait staff. I felt I was singled out because I came in by myself at dinner and was made uncomfortable by my waiter who wasn't French. Probably because I didn't order the wine (I don't drink due to my meds and I'm driving myself back to NJ). By mistake another waiter placed a very small port sherry drink next to my dinner which I didn't ask for and my waiter made a scene at my table. He slammed the salt and pepper shakers on my table and I was wondering what that was all about. I didn't pay for this extra drink (I only drank water). It's a shame - I would have gladly recommended this place in a heart beat save for this incident.,2,0,0,Ruth V.,"West Orange, NJ",26,7,0

The restaurant also extended their popular restaurant week menu to provide a bargain to their customers.  My only compliant is that it is a bit touristy.

The food was OK but certainly overpriced for restaurant week special. I had a green salad (good but nothing special and very small) and a trout which was good.

For the starter I had goat cheese ravioli - while I didn't love it (I thought the quantity of the cheese overpowered the entire dish) the people I dined with all thought it was fantastic.  For my meal I had the trout. Which was very tasty although I do think they could have cut down on the butter a bit. And for dessert I had a lemon brûlée tart. Which was also pretty good and a great ending to the meal.

5.0,2/19/2014,"So this place is definitely worth the hype. My friend and I ventured in here one night to have dinner and catch up. We had an amazing server and ended up staying most of the night. The escargot is some of the best in the city and they had a daily special which was a lobster salad. YUM! In addition my friend has a seafood dish and I had the steak. They both were fantastic. We also partook in their vast wine selection and were particularly ""touched"" by the bear creek (I can't believe I even remember this) Pinor Noir. We had several bottles.  When the food is this good, I tend to not even care about the ambiance, but this place has it all. Apparently the backstory it is owned by Josephine Baker's son (although I have heard conflicting reports of this by the locals).  There is a garden upstairs and a large piano in the middle with a very talented artist playing all night.

For my main I ordered the Amish roasted chicken and I cried tears of joy with every bite of perfection that I took.

I brought some family from out of town to eat here before the theater on a Sunday afternoon, which New Yorkers will recognize as brunch time, when the restaurants are likely to be madhouses. Chez Josephine, while definitely busy, still maintained a relaxed vibe. Even though there were other diners aplenty, and even though we sat less than thirty feet from the piano, we were able to hear each others' conversation perfectly. We didn't feel rushed or hassled, either--the service was attentive but not intrusive, and we were treated with the utmost courtesy.If you're looking for a nice, relaxed meal at an absolutely adorable little joint with a laid-back vibe, look no further.

Walking into Chez Josephine is like stepping back into back into old New York - with suited and knowledgeable servers, white tablecloths and lush red velvet drapes. Unfortunately, I wish the food could have met the high expectations set by the ambience of the restaurant. The escargot was not in its shelled when served and the sauce was too salty to enjoy the garlic sauce. My boyfriend ordered the boudin noir which he enjoyed but my steak tartare (appetizer served as entree) was far too mushy and bland - more like cat food than nice juicy chunks of fresh meat and spices.

3.0,11/20/2013,We found Chez Josephine because we were going to a play at the newly renovated historic theaters on Theater Row on 42nd Street.  The atmosphere at Chez Josephine is absolutely charming recalling the Paris of Josephine Baker and her illustrious career.  The piano adds a pleasant background and the staff was very attentive and professional.  I have no complaints about the service at all.  The food we ordered was tasty although I did find the escargots a bit too salty.  The one drawback was that the tables are practically on top of each other and the place was packed so you can't even sit down (or get up) without them pulling the table out and letting you in. (or out) Luckily we sat next to a pleasant couple who were visiting NY and were able to engage in conversation. (That was good since there was NO way we wouldn't hear the entire conversation...I was sitting closer to her than I was to my husband across the small table - you literally cannot get back out without them pulling the table out no matter how thin you are)  We will try it again....perhaps a bit later in the evenine AFTER the theater crowd leaves.  It's definitely worth checking out if you're in the neighborhood though.,0,0,0,Tina P.,"Manhattan, NY",20,53,0
4.0,11/4/2013,"I've made 4 extremely rewarding trips and figure it's about time I shared my pleasant experience.  First of all, the atmosphere is glittery and romantic.  You're transported to the Paris of Josephine Baker's day.  You're asked by the distinguished maitre'd if you'd like an intimate, quiet table or one near the piano.  You can't get a bad glass of wine here which is a great way to start. My date and I have ordered different dishes every time we've been in here and we've shared so I can truthfully say I have not had a bad dish and everything we've tasted fulfilled every expectation.  I only wish the portions were a little larger which is a complaint, but also a testament to how tasty everything was.  My favorite appetizer was a tie between the lobster, avocado salad (which is also served as a main dish).  It's de-shelled so there is no extra work involved and the lobster portions are generous and extremely fresh and tasty on both occasions I've had it.  The Maryland Crab Cake was so tender and crumbled easily, and it was the most delicious crab salad I have ever tasted!  The Chinese ravioli with goat cheese was unusual and memorable.  A close runner up!  The Blackened Atlantic Salmon as well as the Striped Bass special were extremely satisfying and delicious. The filet mignon was tender, juicy and elegantly presented.  The $12 desserts are a little on the expensive side and the portions perhaps too small to share, but they were all of the finest quality.  If you're looking for a memorable evening pre or post theater, and you're not on a budget, Chez Josephine will not disappoint.",0,0,0,Walter M.,"Edgewater, NJ",112,15,3

5.0,9/7/2013,"I decided that on my last night in New York City, I would explore 42nd Street. In doing my research, I discovered Chez Josephine. Pleasantly surprised owing to my extreme adoration of the history and legacy of Josephine Baker, I decided to go to the restaurant.Earlier in the day, I'd eaten at another French restaurant in a different borough. Due to my previous meal, I was mainly in the market for dessert and cocktails. Once I arrived at the restaurant, I was awestruck by the wonderful music coming from the piano and by the way the lighting managed to highlight the dining area without being offensive.After thoroughly reading the menu, I decided on the Crème Brûlée. All the entrée choices and dessert choices made the decision a difficult one. To go with it, I chose a fabulous cocktail called the Banana Belt. The cocktail's tropical banana flavor paired well with the sweet creaminess of the crème brûlée. The dessert itself was maybe the best crème brûlée I've ever had the pleasure of eating. The most common mistake I've come across when receiving a restaurant's take on this classic dessert is that the chef or preparer reacts heavy handedly to the caramelization. It leaves the top too dark and bitter. This was most certainly not the case at Chez Josephine.Overall, the experience at Chez Josephine was the perfect end to my first trip to New York City. Any subsequent trips will definitely require a return visit so that I a experience a full course meal.",2,0,0,Anthony E.,"Dallas, TX",30,16,3

I ordered the salmon entree, and the piece of salmon was very large and cooked perfectly. It was sitting on a bed of greens and pasta, which made it extra filling. The only down side is that the restaurant was very dark. The place is pretty much only lit by candlelight, but I enjoyed that aspect. I would definitely recommend this place for a classy night out.

5.0,8/2/2013,"Stepping away from the bustling madness that is 42nd street, entering through the quaint patio of Chez Josephine signaled an entrance apart from reality. No longer are you pounding the pavement of a crowded New York sidewalk; whisking past the doors of this petit restaurant, you are transported to l'âge d'or de Paris. Instantly greeted by a welcoming maitre d', I was escorted through to my table. Along the way, I managed to meet the owner himself, Jean-Claude. One gets the sense some patrons dine here simply to reunite with him; fashioned in an elaborate kimono, large beads, and a sprightly step, Jean-Claude was sure to embrace old friends with all the pomp and circumstance one wishes to be attended to. While waiting for my exceptionally late friends, I was treated to warm cheese biscuits and a constantly refilled glass of water. Not once did I feel pressured to justify my holding a table for three by myself. Managing to avoid being hustled out, I took advantage of the extra hour I was afforded by the incompetence of my friends' hotel concierge to really absorb the ambiance. Plush crimson drapery, rich red walls offset by air shocking turquoise colored tin ceiling, a plethora of memorabilia showcasing the real star herself, Miss Josephine Baker, and a piano man surrounding patrons with beautiful jazz standards; this is everything that awaits one on the doorstep of this establishment. It is a magnificent feeling to be anachronistic in the sense of setting in this day and age; Jean-Claude cultivates this sensation with grace and dignity.Finally, my friends joined me. We quickly set ourselves upon the menu. We ordered a bottle of the Chateau de Bois de la Salle Cru Beaujolais; a delicious choice I highly recommend as it paired exceptionally well with our meals. To start, we shared the Escargots a La Bourguignonne. I've had escargots many a time but all I can say was wow; succulent, tender, and wrapped in a flavorful garlic-herb sauce. I chose the boudin noir for my entree (a personal favorite). If you're as much a fan of blood sausage as I am, then you'll love this rendition. The apple puree, ultra spicy mustard, and decadent cabbage all balanced the richness of the sausage (not to mention the generous portion of TWO that I was given).To make a long story short, Chez Josephine delivered everything I look for in an amazing culinary experience: great food, amazing wine, and an unforgettable ambiance.

1.0,3/17/2013,"Food was truly mediocre. One of our party had the fried chicken. Would skip this and pay 1/2 the price at most NYC diners instead, where it would be better. I had the lobster salad entree. For $36, it was a pile of lettuce with some plain tasteless lobster on the side, and some pathetic vinaigrette. The rolls were not good, hard and tasteless, as if they were institutional from a cafeteria (maybe not as good). The sorbet was overpriced and consisted of 2 small balls on a plate. Overall, the plating of food was pathetic, for such an expensive ""French"" restaurant.I had requested a table on the 1st floor to see the piano player, the main reason I had come. I had been there before, and had already seen the Josephine Baker artifacts.The owner flatly would not allow me to sit on the first floor, despite my literally begging him, and despite my requesting this weeks in advance, having reserved and then calling. There were tables down there, but the owner twice sent me upstairs to the crowded stuffy hot 2nd floor, or to a back table near the kitchen where I could not see the piano. I was told that I could only hear the music through the speakers upstairs, which were poor quality and blarred above our table.I was also told by the waiter that the owner ""knows where people should sit."" So even though I am perfectly presentable, and other male guests were in suits, we were not good enough to be seen there. Yup. That hurt.Never again. Several hundred dollars later, which is what the meal cost, I feel that this was the worst restaurant experience I have had, since no one deserves to be treated like an unwanted patron.",1,5,0,Mary A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,0

Coming from Northern Cali myself, I am a food and wine addict so was skeptical but this was one of the best dining experiences I've had in a long time! Jean-Claude was a fabulous host.  Each of us had the fixed priced menu which was an unbelievable bargain at $35; large bowl of creamy pumpkin soup, short rib as large as my fist on a bed of mashed potatoes and delicate sauce, finishing with a chocolate mousse for dessert.  I can still see and taste it!  The only thing better than the meal was the wine list---really excellent French and California wines by the glass from only $10-14/glass.  Others in our party had the trout and salad which was equally wonderful.  The service was a tad slow but we were in no hurry and it gave my party time to chat. To top everything they served good, good coffee. I'm a wine and coffee drinker so the key to finishing off a good meal is a great cup of coffee----they didn't disappoint.  Then there was the piano player; we felt we were in a supper club! He was excellent and played just the right mix.  To top everything off, I left my phone on the table, only discovering I left it when I got back to my hotel.  We received two calls from Jean-Claude ""I've got it, don't worry"" and when we went back to get it, he invited us back in for a drink.  Great place, great dining experience---worth a trip to NY just to eat through the menu!",1,0,1,V W.,"Oakland, CA",0,4,0

2.0,8/19/2012,"The company I work for decided to host an employee appreciation dinner in regards to our hard work during the Holidays. The menu was tailored for our ""needs"" (read: budget), and it sounded flamboyant/extravagant but in the end it was meant to turn ordinary meals sound special. So what happen during those two hours I was there?  Buns, buns, buns.. I never had so many buns before a meal. As soon as you finished one, the next one appeared. Puff! It was a warning of the sizes of our meals which were more appeatizer then entrees. Also, the server mistook my order and I was given something completely different... After realizing the mistake I was granted with the proper meal. Equally 'meh' as the first one. Rotiserrie chicken with some pasta on the side. Then as the server was clearing up the dessert plates, somehow, for whatever reason, he tried to feed me a left over piece of the apple tart. i'm not sure if this was meant to be humorous,  or if it was something we'll talk about for years to come but I'm sure it left my co-workers a little baffled and speechless. Granted I did have some white wine but in no way was in a state where I would let a stranger feed me. Then, as we were getting ready to leave, a friend rushes to me frightened. Apparently the coat check guy in charge is blatanly asking for a tip. ""That will be $1"". I'm not outraged about the tipping part, I'm shocked by the fact of NOBODY telling us it was (apparently) a paid coach check BEFORE they asked for our coats. We were not thrilled. And then as we leave, the bartender hands us a postcard saying ""This is on us"" and before looking closely at what it entails, we thank him. It was a plain postcard. Nothing else.

Jean Claude Baker, the son of legendary entertainer Josephine Baker is the loveliest of host's in the manner of old school hosting. He pay's homage to his mother with the decor of the restaurant which is reminiscent of a ornate 1920's speakeasy. Jean Claude makes a person feel like a guest, not merely a customer! It's location is actually just west enough of Broadway that it isn't a serious tourist-trap, it has a regular cliente mixed with an array of savvy tourist's who have done their homework. The menu ranges from traditional French fare (choucroute royal, lobster cassoulet) to Josephine's personal favorite ~ spaghetti bolognese. The dessert's are frankly French and rich. They stay open late to accommodate the after-theater crowd which is my favorite time to go to Chez Josephine! There is a wonderful piano-man, the wall's are covered with huge vintage paintings of Josephine from Jean Claude's personal collection and the wait staff are all talented actors, singer's or dancer's who pop into impromptu song or dance at the drop of a tip! You'll end up singing along by the end of the evening with Jean Claude's encouragement, if there is someone in the restaurant from the theater world, (we sat next to Maimie Van Doren the 50's sex kitten one evening!) they have to sing for their supper! There is a $35.00 weekday 3 course menu which by anyone's standard's is an amazing deal, but in New York City?

3.0,1/8/2012,"I first went to Chez Josephine some three years ago with a few other students from a program at my University. The school was paying for us, we were around 12 people, so we could try out various things.I fell in love with the place: the food was amazing, the decor was amazing - both kitchy, classy and sexy at the same time (the almost naked paintings of Josephine Baker and other no-less attractive women on the walls add to that), the owner was a bit much - in a bright red kimono and quite loud - but great nonetheless and the angus with red peppercorn was the most amazing piece of meat I ever ate. Even the bread we got at the beginning was something else. A year later I was in charge of these school dinners so I chose to go to this place again. The bread we got at the beginning did not taste fresh, but the food we ordered was still really good.Finally, a few days ago I decided to go to Josephine again - this time on my own money, after watching Memphis. I went with my fiancee as well as with my sister and her husband who were visiting from abroad. The decor was amazing. But soon enough the disappointments started rolling. The cheese bread was boring, cold, tasteless. There wasn't enough light, so my fiancee couldn't separate the fat from the meat on her pork chop - which was good on a one inch radius, but slightly bland and fat everywhere else. The angus I got was good as usual, but the fries it came with just seemed like microwaved frozen fries. And yes, it was just angus and fries. I'm sorry, but I can make better fries than that. so can any chain. my fiancee took the pork chop to go so I could eat it at home after separating the chunks of fat. The gratin dauphinois (pretty much bakes potatoes with cheese) that came with my fiancees pork chop were also just plain boring even compared to the gratin that we cook at home. The texture was off, slightly grainy. I mean, I kinda enjoyed the food, but my fiancee found her pork chop uneatably bland and fat. Serving mediocre food in a place like that is really a saddening experience. I had built up my fiancees expectations based on my experience two years ago, and was severely disappointed.

2.0,9/6/2011,"I used to love Chez Josephine and had many a wonderful night there. This weekend I had brunch there for for first time in about 4 years and it was seriously mediocre. ~ The place was nearly empty and yet it took 40 minutes to get our order.~ The waiter was a cocky smartass. I really hate that. I'm not here for the show, buddy so you can just skip the routine. ~ After ignoring us for a half hour, that same server asked us to pay while we were still eating so he could ""close out brunch"". I tipped him much less than I normally would have. Hope he enjoyed that.Having said that the food was acceptable, though not great by any means, and I love the decor and the piano player.

3.0,8/30/2011,"A friend invited me here to a dinner date.This is prob the 2nd French restaurant I've ever been to.My friend was a bit late so I started with a glass of wine and the escargot appetizer. I'm a lover of snails. The meal came with about 6 small snails in a olive oil based sauce (which was good for bread dipping).The escargot itself was a bit salty. I'm am salt sensitive though.I found the smaller bread (cheese bread) to be very tasty. They only bring that once though..the regular bread is offered more freely.I ordered off the $35 menu. I got the soft shell crab meal...mehh. I wish I hadn't. I don't want to hold it against Chez Josephine. I've only eaten soft shell crab in sushi and so I decided to try it ""on it's own"" in a meal. Eck. Not my cuppa tea. It came with couscousMy friend got the duck (a daily special) which came with mashed sweet potato. YUM I should have gotten that. The duck was made well, not fatty, not salty. I wanted to switch meals but that wouldn't be kosher. Dessert was a banana iced cream which was poorly paired with a small piece of bread(?..looked like the earlier cheese bread sliced). SO it was a like an iced cream sandwich...but the bread texture went poorly with it.  If they had use a cookie or something of the like (wafer? ) it would have been a better match. Overall, I am not against this establishment. My personal mean sucked, but the other meal I tasted was delicious. So enough to make a decision? Not really. It's 50-50.I would come back to try other items on the menu. The owner was very very very pleasant and I love the live music.",1,0,0,Kemi A.,"Brooklyn, NY",189,523,331

2.0,8/18/2011,"The only good about this place is being greeted by the super friendly owner of the restaurant, the pianist and the interesting decor. The food on the other hand was below average and I actually really regret spending my money here even though I only ordered from the restaurant week menu.I ordered the escargot which wasn't necessarily bad but I just wish they hadn't put sea salt in there. It had enough flavor without that and would have tasted just fine but the sea salt made it pretty unbearable for me to eat. It was just too salty and I had to drink so much water. Eat it with some bread or something and it might be a little better. On a side note, the bread was so cold and hard that I probably would've been able to knock someone out with it. For the entree I had the quail and my friend had the soft shell crab. I am a huge fan of quail so I was really anticipating it but boy was I disappointed. The quail was so damn tiny that I had such a hard time fishing it out of the huge pile of beans that it was served it. The beans were horrendous, tasted like it was straight out of the can and the sauce was weird tasting. The quail itself was dry and had very little flavor to it. My friend's soft shell crab according to her tasted pretty bad too. She ended up only eating only 1/4 of it.At this point I was really hoping the entire meal would be saved by a decent dessert. Nope, the dessert was not good either. I got the coconut panna cotta and there was some sauce served with it which was really really awful. It had this bitter and super tangy taste to it which stayed in my mouth the entire time even after the meal. I did not like the taste of the sauce at all and it just ruined the dessert for me. However, I do reckon that if I had not tasted the sauce first, the dessert would have been okay. My friend said the ice cream that she had was decent though. Service here could be better. We sat down for about 10 minutes and did not get menus, I had to wave someone down just to get us menus. It took about another 15 minutes for a waiter to ask us if we were ready to order yet.

I ordered from the restaurant week menu and my fiancé ordered from the regular menu. I ordered the escargos for app and roasted quail for entree. The escargos were pretty good with a nice texture...unlike some that I've tried that's really mushy. The quail was very disappointing. It was way over cooked and dry to the point that the leg meat in particular was rubbery. My fiancé ordered the steak tartare for app and pork chops for entree. Both were disappointing. The steak tartare was bland in taste and unlike the escargos, way too mushy. The textures...well, there really was no texture and I felt like it was left in the blender and forgotten. The pork chops were also overcooked, dry, (we specifically asked for medium) and unremarkable. Our waiter, although polite, was just plain dry and bland like our food. The only good thing about this place is the ambiance, decor, and the live pianist. However, I think they should pay more attention to their food instead of their decor.",0,0,0,Yan C.,"Manhattan, NY",7,39,28
2.0,7/23/2011,"Chez Josephine: Only go with good company; ask for extra bread every single time it is offered. Enjoy the live music, and don't order off the Restaurant Week menu. Just trust me on this. JdF will not lead you astray.What I loved:-Live pianist(even though he recycled songs)-Comfortable setting(without the snoot)-Service(warm welcome by the host/friendly and attentive waitstaff)What reminded me of my hatred for Restaurant WEAK:The escargot was.. how do you say terrible in French?.. Oh look, it is spelled the exact same way as in English.  So why do they not understand how bad this dish is??There was a grainy bite to each piece because of the sea salt that was sprinkled on.  The garlic and herb oil did not enhance the escargot flavor; it overpowered the snail. Au contraire, it made a good dip for the bread.  Remember to keep nodding when asked if you want more bread- not that it is any good; but for the purpose of keeping you from licking and devouring your own hand.The food is $hit small.  Excuse my language, but what's with the midget-sized food??  I got the quail dish, and received not even a whole quail, and they are small in stature to begin with.  You should have seen my approach to the bird; there was no way to eat those tiny pieces in a lady-like manner because my finger was bigger than one of the halves, and a good 25% of it were bones.  Then they give you a $hitload of beans, a few of which I ""lost"" on the tablecloth.  Prior to this, I had 3 dinner rolls.  Three!!  Spiffy clean were my plates, and still hungry.More importantly, I would not mind the size as much if the taste was incredible.  But small and mediocre makes me feel like I was gypped.If it wasn't for the miscommunication of facebook messages, we would have dined at Jojo or Perry Street.  This is social networking at its worst!",1,7,0,Jenn F.,"Brooklyn, NY",767,372,2548

[i wouldn't really know the total because a friend's cousin's friend was nice enough to pick up the tab for everyone.]i will definitely come here again - probably not for a date night but maybe dinner with friends if im taking someone to NYC for the first time.xoxo",1,0,1,Paola S.,"New York, NY",247,131,50
4.0,7/14/2011,"Surprisingly mellow inside, considering it's relatively in Time Square. I found the space to be kitschy, but it seemed to worked - large frames of Josephine Baker, huge chandeliers with Christmas ball decorations, blood red walls, lots of mirrors and private nooks & crevices. A proper lady sat at the bar with bobble jewels, a piano man pretty much played and sang all night. He was great, but have to admit kinda loud. Found myself yelling at some points and straining to hear (though, I must caveat that my hearing is terrible these days). The owner/host was definitely interesting - he greeted us at the door with a Chinese outfit on, rubbed my back at the table like an old friend, sat randomly with a group behind me and pulled a small child up to the piano to bang on the keys for a few. A little quirky, but overall Cynthia A. (who was visiting from Cali) and I didn't mind.The wine (sauv blanc) was pretty good and wasn't too pricey. The lobster bisque was incredible! Not sure why others thought it was bland? Loved the little lobster chunks - it was so rich, I think I got full off of it - and the bread. Bread was hard, butter was cold, but it still tasted good to me. And after I finished the first roll, the waiter swiftly put down a second. For my meal, I ordered the steak tare tare and a side of truffle-oiled mashed potatoes. Both were pretty good but I was so full from the soup, I ended up eating only half (and they were small portions).All in all a pretty good experience but kind of pricey. I'd give this a 3.5 but will bump up to a 4 because I don't want to affect their score. May come back but I've had my fair share of yum French elsewhere.",3,0,2,Kristy L.,"Leander, TX",111,112,5
5.0,7/14/2011,"Chez Josephine is the type of place where you have a 3-hour dinner and become an instant regular. It's the type of place that welcomes you with open arms (literally) and makes your meal into a memorable experience. If you are looking for exceptional quality, good value, upscale décor, and comfortable atmosphere, this is the place. Whether you're in a sundress or in a tux, Chez Josephine is a fabulous choice for dinner and drinks.My mom and I stumbled upon this place when we found ourselves with a free night in the city. We search Yelp for nearby restaurants and found two that sounded good: one with 4 stars and Chez J. with only 3.5 stars. Feeling indecisive, we walked to the former first and thankfully only stayed for appetizers.When we approached the adorable patio of Chez Josephine, a man was straightening tables. As soon as he saw us looking in his direction, he immediately grabbed my mother's arm and ushered us inside. ""Best table in the house for my ladies!"" said the man, whom we had never met before, to the handsome host. The restaurant was by no means empty, especially for a Wednesday night. We sat in a corner booth facing the piano (another blessing as it turns out).Lobster Bisque - 5 stars - $10 for a huge bowlSteak Tartare - 4 stars -  with a quail egg!

My mother has always been interested in Josephine Baker (she visited her French chateau a few years ago), so it was very fortuitous that we discovered this wonderful restaurant. Jean-Claude signed a copy of his book, ""Josephine Baker: The Hungry Heart,"" and sat down to talk with us several times throughout the course of the night. With his thick French accent, he is hilarious: ""I know nothing about wine, don't care about food, and am allergic to cheese. But I am good with people!""The piano player, Jeff, was fantastic. (Chez J. has entertainment every night of the week.) A jazz musician at heart played anything we requested--from Frank Sinatra to ""What a Wonderful World."" We talked with him at length, as well.

Both were made a little more well than anticipated (we both ordered medium rare), but they were still delicious.

I had difficulty finding a wine to match with my meal, and the waiter did little to help me in that regard (although he was very on top of refilling my glass). The reason why this venue received four stars, rather than three, was the exceptionally good pianist who set the mood for the whole restaurant.

3.0,6/23/2011,"Went here before the show, friend said it had a classic ambiance and it does. It is a long narrow space with a window at the back end that makes it seem bigger, and as others have noted, some paintings of some lovely women sans most or all of their clothes and topless and a lovely antique type ceiling painted a rich blue color. The place also had a piano player and it was indeed nice to have music that was live and not over powering (in middle age I'm starting to find places too loud,  glad to say this was not once of them).So ambiance great, food, just okay. I ordered a gin and tonic and came in the same glass they use for a water glass and I assume, though I hope not, wine. For some reason it is not the same when my G&T is in a goblet. The restaurant did provide a nice amuse-bouche in the form of a class french cheese puff, which was a nice start to to the meal and they provided rolls and butter as they ran out, which was a nice service touch.For the meal I had the endive salad with blue cheese and walnuts. A simple but classic dish and easy enough to just pick up the endive leaves and eat them by hand (hands, the original utensils). It was okay but did not wow me but classic french food I guess. I followed up with the french onion soup and I have to say, the cheese on top was great but the broth itself seemed a bit watery. I tend to like a richer broth for that dish and was a bit let down that a french place did not wow me with this dish. Finally I had this sort of classic European farmer's meal with various cured meats with some boiled potatoes and sauerkraut. I thought that was actually done fairly well and reminded me of the same dish I had in Germany. Bottom line, the ambiance is fun to experience and the food, to me, was okay and a place for sort of old-school classic french food but I think the ambiance is better than the food.

The are snails cooked to perfection. They are served on a plate with six grooves where they lie in a garlic and butter sauce. These just melt in your mouth!I wanted something light. Had a steak at Blue Ribbon last night so we decided to make it a seafood night. In my opinion seafood is light if cooked in a good way. Nothing in a cream sauce or anything heavy. With that in mind I ordered the Lobster Cassoulet with Shrimp, Scallops, Seafood Sausage,  Black Beans, in a Shellfish Bouillon. The lobster, shrimp, seafood sausage and scallop was in a light flavorful broth. The black beans added the right amount of saltiness and made the dish complete.

Our waiter kept trying to fiddle with the heater which was uselessly behind us to no avail.The food was ok.  Not at all what I was expecting or hoping from this place.  We started off with the crab cake appetizer which was deliciously moist and full of crab, unlike some places where there seems to be a 60/40 mix of filler to crab.  Let's see, what else: the pianist and singer were nice.  However the good stuff stops there.At the beginning of dinner, we received one roll each and that was it.  Even when our soups came (the special of the night carrot ginger soup which was bland, and hubby got the lobster bisque which was pretty bland but did have nice chunks of lobster at the bottom) no more bread followed.  We ordered 1 bottle of wine and they were out and the waiter recommended 3 bottles which were nothing comparable to what we had originally chosen but were overpriced American reds.   I ordered the duck and got  juicy, but very rare, unevenly sliced slabs of meat atop some corn and chopped veggie mess.  Hubby got the salmon, which was a combination of cajun and overcooked.  Nothing at all was memorable or extraordinary in any positive way.  OBVIOUSLY we skipped dessert (all evenly priced at $10 each except for the market rate cheese plate) and went elsewhere.Overall, with a $200 bill and nothing to rave about I would not recommend this place to anyone looking to eat, although it may be nice for drinks.",3,0,0,Mardory V.,"New York, NY",463,508,2114

4.0,2/1/2011,"Flickering candlelight, dim lighting with chandeliers that would be considered over the top in any other setting (with red Christmas balls hanging off of them) reflecting off mirrors and paintings on the wall of Josephine Baker.  In the front, a bar with a model of a building sitting at the end and wonderful wood trim around the edges.  This is what greeted me when I entered Chez Josephine with my girlfriend for a lovely dinner courtesy of Restaurant Week.  We were greeted by a very attentive host who checked our reservation and seated us quickly.  We sat towards the back, behind an angled area decorated with more mirrors, flowers and paintings.  In the background played live piano music with the din of conversation surrounding us.  Add to that toasty warmth in the middle of winter and to say the setting was comfortable would be an understatement.Our waitress was very professional, not overly friendly, but had just enough cute factor to pull off the manner without seeming rude.  Our drink orders were taken quickly, and once we received those drinks, our dinner orders were taken with the same speed.  This was the mode of service.  Between the waiter handing out seemingly infinite (and tasty) dinner rolls or the gent who was refilling our water, this place ran like clockwork.The restaurant has two floors.  The first floor is the primary seating area while the upstairs area can seat about twenty-ish people behind a curtain for privacy.Since we ordered off the Restaurant Week menu, my girlfriend and I decided to order different dishes across the board so we could try a mix of dishes.  Here's the rundown:Belgian Endive: Not bitter as I've often found endive, but still had a bite.  The cheese was creamy and tasty and the nuts were a nice touch.  There wre eight leaves altogether, each with a good amount of nuts and cheese.Chinese Ravioli: A dumpling skin steamed with goat cheese inside in a sauce with toasted pine nuts.  Absolutely delicious and a total comfort food dish.  I loved how warm the goat cheese was inside the dumpling wraps, yum!  I actually absorbed some of the sauce with my dinner roll just to get more of it.Pan Seared Atlantic Salmon: Perfectly cooked salmon that was seasoned wonderfully.  Even better?  The skin was tasty and crisped perfectly.  The vegetables that came with it (peppers, eggplant, zucchini and spinach) were seasoned incredibly well.  The natural sweetness of the vegetables were the star, but the seasonings played a great supporting role.  The spinach and salmon sat in a balsamic reduction that was delicious.Coq Au Vin: A nicely braised chicken in wine sauce served on pasta with mushrooms, pearl onions and a touch of lardons.  I think on this dish everything else overshadowed the chicken.  That's not necesarily a bad thing.  In many ways, this is more of a comfort dish than the salmon.Apple Rhubarb Crepe Cake:  This came as a small sampler size (I'm half sure the regular non-Restaurant Week serving is larger) but let me tell you, there is a *lot* of flavor in every bite of this wonderful crepe, which is stuffed with a super rich apple filling.Lemon Tarte Brulee: I'm not usually a fan of citrus based desserts, but this gets an exception for sure.  The lemon flavor was present, but not overwhelming.  The ""brulee"" portion became apparent when you bit into the creamy lemon portion and then crunched on some sugar crust - fabulous!Chez Josephine is a significant change of pace from your average Hell's Kitchen eatery.  The mood in the restaurant is comfortable and makes you feel like you've gone back to another time.  It's not cheap, so I don't see myself eating there weekly but it's definitely a treat I intend to go back to explore.",8,3,5,Benson Y.,"New York, NY",393,1300,917

It was sublime. The Maitre D was personable and welcoming. It's hard to enter or leave Chez Josephine without a smile.

3.0,1/16/2011,"I wanted so very much to like this restaurant because I just love Josephine Baker. Unfortunately, it fell short.  The wait staff was neither accommodating nor attentive to ME. Could it be for the same reason that Josephine fled the US to a country where she felt embraced? In fact, the wait staff looked as if I was a homeless person who had wandered in off the street. I travel quite frequently; and dine out 4 to 5 times per week (most often alone) in various major cities.  I was not warmly greeted and no one offered to check my coat.  Other guests were greeted appropriately, offered to have their coat checked by the greeter; and offered coffee, tea or a cocktail upon being seated.  The lobster bisque took no time to arrive. It was tasty, but nothing extraordinary. I was not offered fresh ground pepper as  guests  at other tables who ordered the same.  The mimosa was small for the price.  It did, however, have a slight kick which kind of made of for the size.  The ""French toast"" took forever and there was only one piece of bread halved and garnished with berries.  The fresh blueberries, strawberries and raspberries saved a lackluster dish.  The Sunday brunch prix-fixe meal also included a small scoop of ice cream sandwiched between a small, slightly stale, ladyfinger type pastry - with a slice of banana, dribbled in chocolate - go figure. I am giving the experience a higher rating based on the ambience, décor and especially the pianist who did an extraordinary job. I imagine it would feel even more Josephine Baker""ish"" after dark in subdued lighting with sultry music playing in the background. Also , the prix-fixe tab was only $20 (not including the mimosa of course), which is comparatively cheap in NYC.  Denis, the waiter gets a thumbs down as does management who should train all of their staff to treat ALL of their patrons equally.",3,0,0,Greg S.,"New York, NY",1,52,4

3.0,10/9/2010,"Tres chic. I really loved the french inspired decor of this place. A shrine to its muse, Josephine Baker. My friend and I came here after watching an off Broadway show. My friend wanted to try a French place and I came across Chez Josephine in Yelp as it was nearby. Also, it noted on yelp a prix fixe menu for $35. We were greeted by a friendly host. He took us in without no reservations and it was 5:30 on a Sunday night. We were here seated at the front of the restaurant by a wall. I had no problem with the seating it was just that there were two biddies next to us talking rather loudly. I believe that the host sensed our discomfort and automatically moved us to another table that was right behind the biddies but gave a 180 degree view of the restaurant. That was really nice of the host and I didn't expect that.   The waiter asked is first if we were going to the theater later and we said no. That was very good of them to ask and we were not rushed during our meal. The first starter was chilled asparagus soup. When we received our soups, the soup of the day was given to us, the butternut squash instead the chilled soup. I didn't realize it until I tasted it.  We both told the waiter that this was incorrect but we said that we did not want to change it. I really like the soup but my friend said it was too rich for her because of the cream. The waiter said, he was going to check what's going on in the kitchen.   I got to see more of the restaurant when I headed to the restroom. I had to walk towards the back and up the stairs. This place is huge and can accommodate a lot of people. There is much more seating area in the back and up in the second floor but they were not occupied at the time. More red curtains, glamorous pictures and murals of Josephine everywhere.  While waiting for our food, we were entertained by the two biddies sitting nearby. They received their entrees, osso bucco. After picking at it, they called the waiter. They told the waiter, to put in the microwave, so it would cooked faster! Also, they sent their side order away as well. My friend and I laughed and she said that will be us in the future.   We received our entrees, steak and fries and grilled sea bass over polenta. I tasted the steak, it was very flavorful. As you ate more of it,  It tasted very salty. The steak is not a great quality as it was a very thin slice of meat.  The fries are very good. The sea bass tasted good but it was of the dry side and the polenta was very bland. We got our desserts, frozen cappuccino parfait and profiteroles. The parfait sounded so fancy as it was just ice cream in a cappuccino cup and profiterole didn't taste and have a texture as a puffy pastry should have.   We were disappointed about the prefix menu. The taste and quality of the food is mediocre. It seems that every one else around us ordered from the regular menu. I've had prefix menus at other places and this one is not good at all. The food is not on par with its impressive decor, lively atmosphere, and wonderful service. My friend and I had a great time at this place and really wished the food was better. We decided that we wouldn't go back due to the food.     We had a New York celebrity siting: From Seinfeld, George Cotanza's dad, Jerry Stiller.

Others at my table had the pork chops, which looked great, the spaghetti, which looked pretty standard, and then the Black Tiger Shrimp with Sweet Pea Risotto. That shrimp and risotto dish was awesome. If I come here again, I'm definitely getting that.The restaurant itself is very nice. It's not too far of a walk from the main theater district. There is a live piano going in the middle of the restaurant which is kind of cool and there are some frenchy naked lady paintings all over the walls, which brings a nice Euro feel to it.My only complaint is the service wasn't as good as the menu prices would indicate. The waiters seemed pissed off when we wanted to have a drink before we decided on what we wanted to order, as if there was a line of people waiting for tables. Trust me, there were not. It was a Wednesday night and the place was maybe a third full. And then the waiter did one of my biggest pet peeves and tried to split a bottle of wine into four glasses right away.

Unfortunately, they re-served the chicken breast from my entree with the new dish, so I could still taste the goat cheese. I didn't want to be That Guy and send it back again, so I ate it.  I'm sure it would have been delicious to someone who liked goat cheese.The dishes were on the small side - after a starter and entree, I still wasn't full.

4.0,1/31/2010,I always loved Josephine Baker. Her son has really captured what I portray as a smooth visual version of voice. The meal for Prix fix last year was delicious and worth the dining experience with my good friends. I would have given them 5 stars but I had to remove a star for the waiting time. I had to ask the wait staff for another glass of wine and bread kept being delivered to the table but everyone waited for wine.I would certainly recommend the food and the overall experience. I know I am my friends did also.,0,0,0,Gregory G.,"New York, NY",332,63,30
4.0,1/29/2010,"I read a certain classic work of fiction when I was a little girl, maybe it was Victor Hugo, I just cannot remember...but in this novel, there is discussion of a lady, an opera singer I believe, who eats a thick slice of foie gras every night before her performance. Somehow, although I cannot remember the book, that imagine has always stuck with me as the epitome of elegance and grace.That is how Chez Josephine makes me feel. Jean Claude could not be more delightful as he greets his guests. If you sit at the corner in the bar, you can listen to him as he asks what show is being seen for pre-theatre of each party that arrives as though it was of great interest to him, Its really lovely.I think the space is just perfect for the Theatre District, as is the food, It would not work any where else nearly as well.Prices are reasonable, food is better than most in the area. Maybe not the BEST french food in the city, but such a lovely spot with a solid, good menu. Service is gracious and fast.The piano player adds the right Broadway element without being intrusive.Would I end up here if I wasnt going to the theatre? Probably not, but its one of my very favorites in the area,",1,0,0,Karin G.,"New York, NY",185,568,7
5.0,1/27/2010,"Ever since I was a little girl Jean-Claude Baker (Josephine Baker's son and owner of the restaurant) has greeted me upon arrival and helps me pick out the perfect seat be it near the pianist or a more romantic nook.Jean-Claude's personality adorn those walls, the decor of the restaurant is european luxe and extravagance. Part of the experience is sitting beneath the towering portraits of the late mdme. Baker. The decor IS the MSG of the experience- it enhances the flavor.The lobster salad which may or may not be on the menu but is always available is to die for- the lobster is fresh and every garnish is carefully thought out from the chilled shavings of potato to the sprinkles of caviar and the light balsamic drizzled over top it is a salad fit for Josephine Baker. For a main course I always either opt for the risotto with shrimp or Elvira'S famous southern fried chicken. Dessert, of course,  although I never have quite enough room for it is always the creme brulee. This restaurant has a special place in my heart becasue I've grown up frequenting its dining room and becasue a picture of josephine baker (normally the season select by jean-claude) always graced my bedroom walls.

3.0,1/26/2010,"My girlfriend & I ate dinner here before seeing a show. The food was good and the entertainment provided by the owner and wait staff almost beat the show we saw later. We were sat upstairs in a side room. Periodically something large and heavy was run into the other side of the wall I was sat in front of, with a loud thump and shaking of the skinny dividing wall covered in a large mirror (a little risky, me-thinks). The owner came by, called us various endearments but did not rub my shoulders. That pleasure was had by a man sitting with his date at an nearby table. We also were not forced to get up to feel the art glass lamp given to the owner (in his own words) by the King of Morocco (that pleasure also went to someone seating at a nearby table). The owner also turned down the lighting to near blackout conditions 3-4 times while we ate, a situation fixed by the wait staff each time as soon as he left the room.

5.0,11/25/2009,"After reading a review online, I had to try Chez Josephine.  By the time i had walked down 42nd St., I was second guessing my choice. The neighborhood is in rough shape. Stepping inside, I was instantly transported. There's so much to see and a comforting warmth.  None other than Jean-Claude himself greeted me and introduced himself as the owner. The theatre crowd had just left but there were still a fair number of diners. The butternut squash soup was wonderful, perfectly prepared and piping hot. The entree was equally delightful.  Perfectly prepared, probably the best piece of fish in memory. The vegetables were also piping hot and fresh. The entire dish was wonderful.Going to the restaurant is an experience unto itself. As I mentioned, just walking through the door was transporting.  It seems that Jean-Claude has incredible attention to detail from the experience in the dining room ambience, the entertainment, to the preparation of the drinks and the food.Wonderful.",1,0,0,Frank S.,"Charlotte, NC",7,26,2

There's a lot if colorful art of Josephine, and a live pianist. I arrived at 8:30 on a Thursday night and it was steadily busy past the typical theater dining time. I had a glass of Cote de Rhone, a delicious green salad with sliced potatoes, cucumber, avacado, fish roe, topped with 1/2 a baby lobster....delicious! The pork chops were a nice thick cut on the bone,but a bit overcooked. I asked for it to be prepared slightly pink, and it just didn't happen after a second try.

5.0,8/13/2009,"Chez Josephine is by far my favorite restaurant in New York.  The atmosphere is very warm and cozy.  The owner, Jean Claude Baker, makes a concerted effort to welcome everyone who steps through the front door with an inviting ""Bonsoir"".   A reservation is a must if you are planning a pre-theatre dinner.  The best time to go is after the theatre crowd has departed and you can sit and relax while your eyes absorb all of the pictures and items hanging on the walls.  Do consider the specials for the evening as the chef is selective about what is being offered that night.  I have had dinner at Chez Josephine several times and I have not been disappointed with any item.  Saturday evenings are usually special when some of the talented guests join the piano player for one or two show tunes.  If you have the time, suggest you visit the website before you arrive to learn some of the story of Josephine Baker and why his adopted son pays tribute to her memory every night.   Enjoy!",0,0,0,joe G.,"Syosset, NY",0,2,0
3.0,8/7/2009,"Went here for restaurant week.  Ambiance was nice, the piano guy was pretty cool, bathrooms were A+.  The only thing about this place that is 3 stars is the FOOD.  The crab cake appetizer (at least the restaurant week one) left much to be desired - in fact, my friend got caught with a couple of cartilage pieces too, absolutely nothing like a Maryland crabcake (which was the name of this item on the menu), they were probably using cheap claw meat mixed with fin.  Plus, it was tiny anyway, I guess because its an appetizer, it warrants its mini size.  I had the chilled melon soup, it was really good....probably the best thing I had out of the whole meal, served at just the right temperature and all the flavors were incredibly balanced, plus mini melon balls in there were a nice touch.  The entrees were precious (=small) as well, my soft shell crab was way too salty and the couscous it came with had no flavor.  The veal was not tender.  The dessert - choice of profiterole or apple tart.  Apple tart was gorgeous and absolutely presentable but felt more like eating a piece of chewy tart (pucker your lips!) cardboard.  At least the sorbet on top of it was good.  The profiterole was nothing special, it was drowned in steaming hot chocolate sauce and filled with ice cream so I couldn't tell if the profiterole was fresh or not.  I think it was fresh but even the profiteroles that I've made had better flavor.  Overall, if this was how they do it during Restaurant Week, I don't see any compelling reason to come back when it's not restaurant week.",1,0,0,Becky W.,"Brooklyn, NY",43,100,6

As for the food, I went with my hubby during restaurant week, but the waiter never offered the restaurant week menu! we had to specifically ask for it! The escargot was OK, the pasta with mushrooms and truffle was good, but a Small portion. My hubby had the cassoulet, and for 35 dollars, the portion was ridiculously small and not impressive at all.

4.0,7/7/2009,"The first thing you notice upon walking in to Chez Josephine is the beautiful ornate decor, with lots of rich reds and teals and gilt ornamentation.  The second thing is the flamboyantly French maitre' d who greets you with a ""Bonsoir"" and promptly asks if you have a reservation--possibly multiple times if you stand around for more than a minute.  We did not in fact have a reservation, and I waited for my friends to arrive while sipping a nice glass of Shiraz at the bar.  I was handed a small plate of delicious cheese puffs to go with my drink, which I promptly devoured, as daintily as possible.Once my friends did arrive we were  seated immediately.  Our waiter came over not long after and was so rude that I wondered if it was a gimmick.  I asked what the soup of the day was and he told me to look on the specials menu (not because he didn't know, by the way).  Anyway- the food was delicious.  I ordered the fried chicken, which was perfectly crisp on the outside, juicy on the inside, and sprinkled with salt so every bite had good flavor.  It came with sweet potato fries and blueberry cornbread--both of which were sweet and delectable.  For dessert I ordered the Chocolate Heaven, which was appropriately named.  It looks like a big Hershey's kiss, but it's more like a mousse/flourless cake.  It was not too sweet, nor too big of a portion, and it was absolutely...well, heavenly.  Besides the rude service, which was almost laughable, I loved everything about this place.  The piano player was a nice touch, and it's just enough out of the way of the heart of the theater district to avoid overcrowding and to allow for easy parking.",2,0,0,Meredith F.,"Jamaica, NY",99,372,4

4.0,1/9/2009,"The experience was much better than I anticipated from this area. It's a little farther from the heart of the district--42nd between 9 and 10--but worth walking the extra block or two. This is an actual restaurant, not just a place to keep yourself from gorging on Junior Mints during your show!I was desperately searching for a pre-theater dinner the other night for my mom and myself. As she approaches her late 60s, her wisdom is supposed to be increasing--but instead I find myself wary of her recommendations. This night, she had suggested a place that shall be nameless but was closer to our theater than Chez Josephine. As I quickly Yelped it and looked on other sites, it was clear her choice was mediocre. Yet everyone I asked about theater-district restaurants said, ""They all suck, we never eat there,"" which was not the most helpful advice. I saw Chez Josephine on Menupages and then turned to Yelp for advice. Thank you, Yelp! Good lead. So now I return the favor, to Yelp and Chez Josephine, with this positive review.We were seated promptly in a warm, elegant room. It wasn't kitschy, and, although the resto has now been here for more than 20 years, didn't look worn or tired. We were near the piano player but he knew just how to modulate so we could hear him and ourselves too. The tables for two are a little close together--Mom was telling me about an acquaintance whose last name was Aiello, who just died, and the woman next to me said, 'What? Excuse me? Danny Aiello died?"" Uh, no. But this was the kind of place where it was comfortable to have the occasional exchange with the neighbors.The server immediately asked when our  curtain was so we could be on time. Then the food began! Because no matter how nice the decor--we came to eat.They bring little gougeres (cheese puffs) to the table right away, followed quickly by rolls and butter. I ordered the prix-fixe, a very good value. I started with a vegetable and beet salad that was slightly underseasoned but fresh. I normally stay away from chicken but my main course tasted real, a breast on the bone with an intriguing chestnut and bacon dressing. It was on top of smoky squash puree. Mom just ordered a main course of steak frites--very nicely done. For dessert, we split a profiterole that came with my menu. Not too big, just right, with a bitter chocolate sauce.I drank a ginger ale and Mom just tap water. No wine before theater for us! And although we were far from big spenders, service was polite and efficient throughout. They took our coats, didn't need to give us a coat check for them, and instead brought them right back out to the table when we were ready to go.",2,0,0,Anne B.,"Long Beach, CA",3,64,3

And the gorgeous bathrooms.  Let's face it, they could serve just about anything here as long as I feel like I am being immersed in La Josephine experience.  What a woman...Luckily it was a feast for the eyes, because my food failed to impress. But it IS a French bistro, so there is basically only one offering for vegetarians, that being a sad clump of angel hair pasta with not enough vegetables (though the vegetables that they did put in were quite tasty--kale and patty pan squash, mmmm). I suspect some kind of dairy in the ""confit of tomatoes,"" but not enough to gross me out. It wasn't the worst pasta I ever had, that's all I'll say. Their Cabernet, at 10 or 12 dollars a glass, however, left a lot to be desired. I simply cannot eat pasta without wine, so I just made due with the slightly sweet red, but blargh.Not that this matters because we next went to one of my favorite places on earth that being The Bourgeois Pig, where they have fantastic wines.One thing zat I must mentione is that TOUS le staff parle avec accent Francois FAKE, um HELLO...like our waiter who I had my suspicions about after he described the specials in this over the top French accent, which kept changing throughout the meal and later stood outside smoking and watching us try to hail a cab and then shouted out to us in what can only be described as a Queens accent that we needed to go to the corner.

4.0,10/27/2006,"The atmosphere and the waitstaff here are both excellent.  Friendly, charming, casual, and professional, the guys here make you feel right at home, and very well attended to.  There's a piano that is played well, and the general warmth.  The food was good, not fantasic, but certainly tasty; but really, you're paying for the atmosphere and service.",2,0,1,Jason C.,"New York, NY",15,147,0
4.0,2/2/2006,"this place earns its stars on the decor alone - every inch of space is covered with bright paintings, chandeliers, old prints and posters, mostly paying homage to the owner jean-claude's adopted mother josephine.  jean-claude is there to greet you, and if you mention the book he wrote about his mother he will love you for life.  i went during restaurant week and had the ginger-carrot soup and the snapper, both of which were delicious, and the dessert - le delice josephine, a flourless chocolate cake with raspberry sauce - was heavenly.",0,0,0,ali l.,"New York, NY",27,124,5
5.0,1/15/2006,One of the best restaurants I have ever experienced. I have been to numerous restaurants over last several years. One of my favorite things is to try new restaurants. You will never forget the expeience at Chez Josephine.  There is something called customer satisfaction and this place takes it very seriously.,0,0,0,Chinku G.,"Hicksville, NY",21,541,0
5.0,11/10/2005,"A lovely, special restaurant.  This smart place was opened by one of the lovely Ms. Baker's many adopted children, hence the name and the decor.  Fairly un-outrageous prices considering the swank vibe and the sophisticated comestibles, but I don't visit often because it is a bit of a splurge.  Every time I come here, it feels like my birthday, even when it isn't really my birthday at all.",1,0,2,Megan C.,"San Francisco, CA",37,138,236
