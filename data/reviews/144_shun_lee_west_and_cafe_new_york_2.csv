We had a big round table that allowed everyone to see each other which is rare in New York.The service was great.  It seemed like we had 3-5 people helping at all times.  It was very cool that after we ordered drinks and appetizers, they offered to take our menus back so we could eat appetizers.  Usually, people are trying to get you to order as fast as possible.  Great service.The food was slightly pricey but really good.  The mai tais are particularly good.  Great family experience.  Thanks!!",0,0,0,Josh B.,"Kihei, HI",0,7,0
1.0,3/28/2019,"Shun Lee tried to fraudulently hide their 2.5 star rating by changing their account to ""Fusha Asian Cuisine."" See my attached screenshot below! ""Fusha Asian Cuisine"" even lists Shun Lee's website, menu, and phone number! Shun Lee was once the gold standard of Chinese food. Instead of Shun Lee cleaning up their act to fix their disgusting expensive food and rude offensive service, they think they can lie by opening a new account. Shun Lee: I'm reporting your despicable lying and dishonest activity to Yelp!See my review that I posted in Dec 2018 that they tried to hide by transferring it to Fusha Asian Cuisine:Shun Lee banned me last night after a 20 year love affair. Late afternoon on Tuesday, I was on the UWS running an errand 3 blocks from Shun Lee. I lived in the neighborhood since 1998, but am now in Soho. I thought I would pick up Shun Lee while I was in the neighborhood, so I popped in and ordered a quart of wonton soup, Hunan Country Chicken, and fried rice which was $58 for take out! I specifically asked for extra sauce for the Hunan Country Chicken. When I arrived all the way back downtown in Soho, I opened my chicken. Not only was there not extra sauce, they made it with zero sauce! I called them to tell them it was dry as a bone and they said they would give me a store credit for the chicken. I tried to eat the wanton soup, but it had shrimp floating in it that was not de-vained, so shrimp sh!t was floating in my soup. And their version of $16 fried rice is white rice with raw onion and some vegetables. It is not fried at all. It was white. They ruined my dinner. I was unable to eat anything. By the time I arrived home that night it was late and I didn't have anything in the house to eat for dinner. I am the opposite of cheap, but paying $58 to have to eat microwave popcorn for dinner really bugged me all week.I was up by Shun Lee again yesterday and I took the soup, chicken, and rice in to return it because it's BS to pay $60 for shrimp sh!t, dry chicken, and white rice. They wanted to give me a store credit again, but I told them I'm wanted a refund. The lady who knows me from my 20 years of ordering from them told me, ""Never call again!"" I'm am now banned from Shun Lee because they f'd up my order and serve shrimp sh!t, and I refused to pay $60 for filthy inedible food!Shun Lee used to be the BEST! The Gold Standard. I'm so sad they haver zero respect for their customers whom are happy to pay top dollar for top quality and they have let their once outstanding food and service hit rock bottom. I'm going to miss you Hunan Country Chicken of yesteryear. :(",2,2,0,Veronica L.,"Beverly Hills, CA",3,107,3
4.0,3/16/2019,"What is going on with Shun Lee West? If you order right, the food is still excellent. We are regulars and just had an excellent sea bass in black bean sauce and a tasty shrimp in XO sauce (we do tell them to make it extra spicy, or they tend to dumb down for the UWS audience.)However the last few times we've gone they've been acting strange. We get there between 9 to 9.30. They've already closed all the side booths. Last time they coralled everyone to the center space, so you were sitting next to someone, hearing their conversation perforce, in an otherwise huge, empty restaurant! The waiters seem to be in a rush. You get the feeling they're trying to rush you out of there . . . This is at 9.15! It is not a relaxed meal.What are they doing? Are they purposely trying to drive customers away? Are they just running down their lease?  We would be sorry to lose the great food, but the management seems to be bent on making your visit as unpleasant as possible.Why?",1,0,0,S M.,"New York, NY",0,24,0

5.0,2/18/2019,"I am shocked and frankly offended on the proprietors of this fine establishment's behalf at the insanely low rating on this website. 2 and a half stars! Are you kidding me?Shun Lee West is the Best American Chinese food on the east coast. Expertly prepared, every dish is a delicacy. Their dim sum dough alone is worth a trip. Chicken fried rice that isn't an over cooked greasy mess, but is instead light and cooked to perfection. Meat that is cooked properly instead of over cooked and dry, relying on the sauce to make you ignore it. A plethora of dishes that run the gambit of regions and styles to match any mood and palate. Shun Lee is the original, and is deserving of reverence. Shun Lee is also, without a doubt, the quintessential Chinese establishment, and they do as amazing a job today as they have for many decades since their founding. It is a treat that I travel up town and back to the lower east side to to pick up for my girlfriend and I a few times a year. They have never once let me down and they won't let you down either. So ignore the haters on this website that proves everyone really is a (dog sh**) critic, and take yourself to shun lee for a wonderful meal with friends and family.

2.0,2/17/2019,"Duped by the Duck       I've been to Shun Lee before and enjoyed the restaurant. However, last night was a big disappointment.         It was great to be seated on a Saturday night promptly without a reservation. Their menu has many items I would have loved to try, but I decided on having a half Peking duck and Wonton soup. The waiter was very dismissive of any questions and really had zero personality. The soup was ok at best. Was a clear chicken broth, fairly dilute, with several wontons. No veggies or anything in the broth otherwise. The real disappointment was the half Peking duck. The waiter never showed it to me and never asked if I wanted it served in parts where I make the pancake roll up. The waiter presented it to me already prepared in the pancakes.  I don't eat cucumbers and the waiter had added them which I discovered on the first bite. Hence, I had to deconstruct the pancake rolls to remove the cucumbers. In doing so I saw what was inside my duck pancake rolls. Not much!       I discovered one sliver of duck skin, one scallion and two tiny slices of duck probably 1.5 inches by1/8 inch wide. They served 3 pancake rolls. That's supposed to be a half duck! For $45! They also gave 2 drumsticks. It clearly wasn't a half duck. It was a rip off! Without them showing me the half duck beforehand, I can't help but believe they are using whatever duck meat they have left over from the kitchen. It's NOT a half duck. I felt ripped off!",2,0,0,Joel L.,"Naples, FL",0,13,1

Mine was completely off, and my friend's wine was questionable. The waiter did not apologize or offer a replacement.

The food arrived maybe 12-15 minutes after placing the order. Granted, we only live 2 blocks away, but there is no way the food could have been made to order in such a short period of time. And, as they say, the proof is in the pudding. Or, in this case, the $28 prawns in garlic and scallions.

5.0,4/16/2018,"Shun Lee has been serving some of the best  Chinese food in New York for many years now. They have three restaurants. Shun Lee Palace is located on East 55th Street, and Shun Lee West is located on West 65th Street. Adjacent to Shun Lee West is Shun Lee Café, which specializes in dim sum. This review will be for the Café, as I cannot find a Yelp page for the Café itself. Like I said, Shun Lee Café offers delicious dim sum. If you are not familiar with dim sum, I will inform you. It is part of the Cantonese style of Chinese cooking, and consists of many delectable items rolled around on carts by the waiters. Some items are steamed, others crispy. I believe Shun Lee has over fifty selections. All of the steamed items are dumplings, and they are some of the best I've ever had. Ever. They have the traditional pork, chicken, and vegetable, but also ones I've never seen, such as scallop and mushroom. With so many choices it can be hard to decide. The steamed dumplings come in orders of three or four, it depends. Steamed and crispy have different carts, so waiters make their way around the dining room with them periodically. All of the crispy, or fried, selections are impeccable. They have certain fried dumplings, but other traditional items, such as spring rolls, jumbo shrimp, and sesame chicken. Everything I have named is just a small smattering of all the dim sum offered. You also receive four types of sauces to go with it. They are soy sauce, brown sauce, duck sauce, and hot mustard. The Café also offers certain non- dim sum Chinese selections, which are very good as well. But if I'm eating in the Café, I prefer to get dim sum, and I get the other traditional Chinese foods at the West or the Palace. It is also fun to get an order of the delicious noodles and get dim sum. You can combine regular selections and dim sum in the Café. Service is quick and attentive, the waiters and hosts take care of every need. However, when the carts come around, the waiters tend to rattle off the selections very fast. It is good to pay attention to what they say. The decor in both the Café and the West is beautiful. The Café features a black and white checkered pattern, with neat decorations symbolizing the Chinese animal years. The West has an impressive dragon that circles the room. I highly recommend coming to Shun Lee if you are looking for some of New York's best Chinese food. All I'm going to say is that you HAVE to get dim sum at some point. Note that there is no dim sum service in West, only in the Café. I usually get around ten or twelve orders if I come with one other person, but some people can handle more. I recommend coming before or after a Lincoln Center performance. It's right across the street. I hope you enjoy this delicious food, especially the dim sum, as much as I do.",0,0,0,Matthew A.,"New York, NY",1,17,19

1.0,1/21/2018,"We went to Shun Lee Cafe (""cafe"" side in Shun Lee West) after a performance at Lincoln Center. Very disappointed. I had a 10:15pm reservation (which the restaurant allows since it's available for online reservation), and arrived there early (9:50pm). The staff was borderline polite, seated us while saying we had to hurry because the kitchen was closing ... thank goodness we didn't arrive at 10:15, what would it have been like? Dining room atmosphere is ok and a bit funky/funny with the ceiling lamps being Chinese horoscope signs. Chairs, tables, menus, everything sticky and not the cleanest. My boyfriend ordered a beef Lo Mein, I ordered 4 types of dim sum (which cost 8$ regardless of which one you take). Unlike what is advertised on the online menu, they do not have 50 sorts of dim sum offered on carts that are being passed around. It's just a mere sample of dim sum that is offered on a menu. Fine. Shrimp balls and chicken buns were OK. ""Seafood"" spring roll (which was actually just a shrimp rolled and fried), was ok but a bit plain as only a shrimp vs ""seafood spring roll"". Beef shumai were horrendous. Chewy, very mild in taste, and we honestly couldn't tell whether it was some form of filling with flour, or some other meat byproduct. Definitely not beef, not good, and I am not happy that I am given something that is supposed to be ""beef"" and it isn't. Lo Mein was OK, but very greasy, the 3 pieces of green leaves that were in there were battling in duel, no other vegetable to be found. The ""beef"" was in some kind of batter and deep fried to hide what it really was, so we couldn't really tell whether it was beef or something else. Given my boyfriend does not eat pork, that wasn't very reassuring. 65$ (plus tips) for barely edible food, and bad service, I do not at all recommend. The only good thing was a fairly generous serving of Sauvignon Blanc for 9$ - and the wine was decent. Not recommended. Would not go again.

They brought me hot tea as soon as I sat down, but then I watched the women wheeling the dim sum carts everywhere except near me. After about 15 minutes of being ignored, I pulled out a magazine and started reading, hoping maybe somebody from the staff would notice their customer sitting unattended. Finally I had to ask the manager, ""is it ok if I order something?"" He said yes; what a relief. The dim sum selections were mostly very bready; very thick dumplings with meat that tasted funny and no vegetables, unless you don't mind paying $17 for $1 worth of sautéed bok choy.  After a few plates, we were still hungry and wanted to order more, but we waited 20 minutes, then it was so late, we had to leave to go to our show.The food was not terrible, just mediocre, but the service was terrible.

I did some research (clearly not enough) and came across Shun Lee West. First, there is some type of construction going on outside of 43 West 65th street. Initially, we thought we might be at the wrong entrance. We walked in and there was no one at the door to greet us. We thought it was closed. We looked into a room which I now believe to be the cafe and it was empty. We kept walking but came across nothing. I finally heard the sound of silverware. We made it through this black divider and were met with an employee. I asked if they were still open. There were about 4 people at the restaurant. It was very dimly lit. The employee said yes and seated us immediately.I made a reservation through OpenTable and the photos of Shun Lee looked really nice. Now I understand that those photos were of the cafe only.

It's typical to have expensive restaurants in New York, but this was absolutely absurd for what you got. Not worth the money! The workers were also very rude, and the inside wasn't anything special. Majority of the entrees were well over $30. Some dishes you expect to be pretty inexpensive like typical Sweet and Sour Chicken cost $33 and a veggie egg roll for an appetizer was $15.  I am willing to spend money on a nice meal, but this was absolutely unacceptable. For what you got it should have been more like $10 at most! It wasn't even presented well. What really unnerved me was the fact they tried to fool us into thinking the same two dishes were completely different. One of my friends ordered Sweet and Sour chicken, and the other ordered Lemon chicken. Two completely different dishes-and they look very different from each other. The waiter brought out two Sweet and Sour chicken dishes, which was an honest mistake that is typically no problem, but after asking us who else ordered the S&S dish and us telling him it was supposed to be lemon chicken, he starts talking to the manager and five seconds later he turns back to our table and starts presenting the dish as Lemon Chicken and placed it in front of my friend. We are not blind, it was the exact same dish two seconds ago he presented as S&S chicken, and it was identical to my other friends dish. After continuously telling him that it is not Lemon Chicken, even though he obviously knew, he realized he couldn't fool us and brought it back into the kitchen.

3.0,5/8/2017,"First of all, just to clear, this review is for the CAFE, which is different from the restaurant. I think Shun Lee Cafe is a waste of potential. It's such a nice idea to have a real Chinatown-style dim sum place on the UWS, but if you are going to be near Lincoln Center and charge these prices, you really have to step up your service a  notch. I rarely want to penalize anyone for not speaking English well, as I am thrilled to see as many people as possible with good jobs, but I kind of think that if your job is to explain what different foods are and to ask people if they want things off a cart, you should know SOME English. Our server literally pointed to each dumpling and said, ""Pork"". ""Beef"".  ""Chicken"" ""You want?""  We couldn't even say, ""We'd like two"" or ""How many in one order?"" It made it hard to get what you wanted.  Also, the waiter (as apposed to the dim sum cart lady, who despite her lack of English was very pleasant) was REALLY surly.  I mean, he seemed positively PUT UPON when we dared to ask for another few tea cups so that everyone at the table could have tea, not just the one person who ordered the whole pot.  Who brings a whole pot of tea and puts down one cup?  It just leaves you feeling like you didn't have a good experience when truth be told, the food is really great and it could be such a fun place if only the servers were a bit more well trained, well cast and nicer.",1,0,0,Sara P.,"New York, NY",31,67,286

Both drinks were liked. The Hinger Mojito takes a couple of sips to settle in your palate. Vegetable Steam Dumplings were savory and light and Spring Rolls to start.Main dishes were Prawns with Garlic & Scallions; Orange Beef; Sesame Chicken; Young Chow Fried Rice. The Shrimp were giant in a delicious sauce. The Beef crispy and tangy. The Chicken was a hit. The Fried Rice delicious.For dessert Cantonese Mango Pudín, velvety and melt in your mouth.

1.0,4/9/2017,"Disorganized and Average.  Basic issue was that my food was never served, and when the waiter re-fired my order, another waiter took it and so when everyone else at my table was done eating, the waiter basically came over and asked if I wanted to have him fire the order again or cancel the order.  Needless to say I cancelled the order at this point as it had already been 30 minutes since everyone else got their food.  Now, the waiter did try and be nice in that he poured me a free beer, which was a nice gesture, but, as I was the only person not drinking at the table, didn't really make a lot of sense.The sit down process was also fumbled with them taking us to the table, turning as back because they were confused, to then taking us to the table again.As to the food, I tried one appetizer which was OK, but when the prices of appetizers are what you would expect for a main dish it just wasn't what it should have been.  The rest of the table was ambivalent on their food -- what can i say.... Chinese in NYC is tough.In any case, with so many great restaurants in NYC, these guys should step up their game or they'll be getting a lot more reviews like this.PS: What they should have done is offered to prepare my order in a to-go container without charge or taken another entree off the bill.",1,0,0,Andrew K.,"Chicago, IL",163,6,1

It's more or less the same Chinese food you can get anywhere, prepared perhaps just a smidge better.  I liked my egg drop soup.  I ordered duck with sautéed vegetables but didn't like all the duck fat they served with it.  My boyfriend had sea bass which was flavored with ginger and was very nice.  All in all a good experience but I'll order some take-out favorites and beer next time.",2,0,1,Irena S.,"Manhattan, NY",235,238,62

3.0,1/7/2017,"The best thing this place has going for it is the proximity to Lincoln Center in what can otherwise be considered a dining dead zone.  We were glad to hit them up after a play for a late night dinner, and that their spacious dining room made it easy to snag a last minute reservation. Once inside, the vibe is mixed.  It's hard to tell if they aim to be a divey but authentic  kind of place, or something more upscale and trendy.  Their decor (which is heavy on the golden monkeys with glowing red eyes that peer down at each booth) kind of straddles the two notions.  But the prices suggest that they think pretty highly of themselves ($25-$30 for most entrees that are the equivalent of a single portion most places) The egg rolls were definitely a highlight, with crust crisped to perfection.  Lo mein was tasty, if not unique enough to warrant the price  tag.  After having all sampled it, the verdict was still out on whether we actually liked the sesame chicken.  At first bite it seems promising, with juicy chunks of white meat and coating that's lightly fried to perfection.  But there seemed to also be a perplexingly fishy (literally) after taste haunting each bite. Capping off the meal with hot tea, warm towels, and sassier-than-normal fortune cookies was a nice touch.  Just wish they didn't switch the music off so soon to dencorag earliedsjxdd",5,3,2,Caitlin C.,"New York, NY",439,510,10118

The service was very unattentive and the food was subpar. Of course the bill was super high. Our drinks were not very good and extremely overpriced. We ordered the special egg roll which was supposed to be shrimp and pork- there was no shrimp and very weird smelling pork inside. We ordered a spring roll which was filled with oil and bad. My hubby ordered the chicken curry upon recommendation of our waiter, the one of two times the waiter actually stopped at our table. The curry sauce was okay but the meat was unrecognizable. My hubby will eat almost anything and struggled with a few bites.  I ordered the Neptune nest which was good but not great. And for $35 you would think there would be at least more then one piece of lobster- no. Our waiter never came by after the food was delivered to ask if it was okay or if we needed anything. If he had we would have sent the curry back- and we have NEVER sent a dish back before- EVER. We actually had to flag him down several times during the night with no luck. He would just fast walk by us. And we even tried to get his attention over a 10 min period before we could get our check. In the end actually another waiter is who brought our check. The restaurant was busy but not super busy. I watched the other waiters attend to their tables with no issues. I am very sad to say that this place is not what it used to be.

1.0,12/21/2016,"Terrible.  We figured that since Shun Lee is SO MUCH more expensive than any other Chinese restaurant in the city, they must be either really great (or really greedy...and it turns out to be the latter).  So we decided to splurge and order up (what we thought would be) some excellent Chinese food.  OMG.  We were so disappointed. And angry.  The Moo Shu Pork was dry, salty, and the bits of scrambled egg were BURNT.  The spring rolls were oily blobs of crusty oil.  The ""Chicken With Three Different Nuts"" was tasteless, salty and oily and the ""three different nuts"":  the walnuts were burnt and had some sort of powdery residue on them, there were a lot of raw wet peanuts, and there were TWO cashew halves (totaling one cashew). Oh, and they charge $1.50 for nothing-special brown rice (now THAT is balls).  The total for two terrible entrees and one terrible appetizer? $89.  Yeah, you read that right.

2.0,9/7/2016,"Unfortunate. As noted in one of my previous reviews, I sometimes ""test"" a restaurant by going in off hours - in this case, once for dinner, once for lunch, and then once after a matinee. We arrived, therefore, promptly at 4:30 pm today. We were seated in a booth, and someone quickly came to take our drink orders. After looking at the plates (which were not clean), we gave those to the same waiter. Then we waited for menus and fresh plates.And waited. And waited. The drinks came. Nothing else.I finally had to snag a passing busboy and ask for a waiter, who eventually appeared with menus.Overall, the food was... edible. All right, if you're not a big Chinese food fan. It was the little things that bothered. The Szechuan dumplings were drowning in oil, and the wrappers were thick and doughy, though the filling was good. The cold Szechuan cucumber had been sitting too long, and completely lost its crunch - and, again, drowning in oil. I don't have a problem with hot oil, but I do have an issue when there's so much of it that as the food cools, it congeals. I was excited to try to ma po tofu (or ""mo po"", as their menu states), but it really, really disappointed. Even though we'd ordered it with pork, and spicy, it was bland, oily (again), and the tofu was beyond silken. It was so soft that it came apart on the plate before I even touched it.Red Fire Cracker Prawns with Scallops were all right - not spicy, though, and with an awful lot of breading.The biggest annoyance, outside of terrible service (we never once had a waiter come by after they took the drink order - we had to find someone for everything from ""could we have some mustard?"" to ""could we have some more water?"" to ""could we have a check?"" to ""would you take our check?"") was the price.

2.0,9/1/2016,"I don't even know where to begin. First of all, the prices are outrageous, especially for the quality. Knowing this was definitely more of a ""Chinese-American"" restaurant, I was disappointed not to find any of my go-to favorites on the menu (no Crab Rangoons, Beef and Broccoli, Sweet and Sour Chicken, or Sesame Chicken -- only something called that but with a ""spicy garlic sauce"" and I wasn't feeling adventurous), so I ordered Lo Mein with beef, one Spring Roll with sweet and sour sauce and a bottled water for delivery. The Lo Mein was $15.50, and was admittedly an enormous portion, easily enough for 2-3 people to share, but I was just eating lunch, so I didn't need that much food and I didn't even keep the leftovers because it was so greasy and bland. They also got my order wrong and gave me pork instead of beef,  but I doubt that would have made a difference. I had to wipe my mouth after every bite because of how greasy it was and I still felt like I there was a film/ residue on my lips and teeth afterward. The Spring Roll was $4.50 and was also incredibly greasy -- there was actually a small puddle of grease on my plate when I lifted it to take a bite, and the filling was literally just glass noodles and white cabbage, if that. No carrots or bean sprouts to be found, and no flavor other than the oil it was fried in. Also, the dipping sauce was brown and tasted more like sesame sauce than sweet and sour, so maybe they just don't have sweet and sour sauce there, which is odd. I took 2 bites, gave up and threw it out. Also, when I got the ""bottle of water"" I ordered, they delivered a 1-liter glass bottle of Toscana spring water (which explains why it was $5.95!) but the bottle wasn't even a twist-off, so I had to struggle with a letter-opener to pry the bottle cap off, since I don't keep a bottle opener at my office.

2.0,5/17/2016,"Overall this gets a bit of a ""meh"" rating. I went here of an afternoon mainly because Le Pain across the road seemed pretty packed, and just wanted a quiet place to relax and talk with a friend. The good thing about it is that it is capacious, quiet, and the staff did not try to hustle us very much. Usually you can't just sort of sit and chat, with space for a laptop on the table, at a Chinese restaurant. This was slightly different. We only ordered two dim sum dishes, a pot of tea, and a dessert, and hung out for over two hours. The bill was ~30. So the dim sum is overly expensive - but you're paying for location. My complaints mainly focus on the decor. Who the heck decorated this place? IT'S COMPLETELY BLACK. I don't know what feng shui says about black furnishings, but it gave me a creepy vibe. The monkey statues flanking the entrance were creepy. The dragon going around the whole wall was odd. Whatever - just seemed a bit tacky and eerie. Also, pretty expensive.The long and the short of it is, if it's a quiet afternoon, you need a place to lie low and quietly talk for a few hours, and you're right there and don't want to find somewhere else, then this is an absolute winner. That's about all I can say about the place, based on my limited experience.",0,1,1,Matthew R.,"New York, NY",109,19,0

We had almost an hour for our meal before the movie started, but had to cancel one of the entrees because they couldn't get it to our table before we needed to leave.  and the cancelled entree (they brought it as the check appeared) was a Szechuan (read 'hot') dish not identified as such on the menu. And again, something seriously wrong with the wait-staff. we waited 20 minutes for soup and spring rolls, and the person who served them forgot to bring the sauce plate (he left it on the tray until I was able to flag down another waiter to bring it to us).

1.0,3/5/2016,"Three words can describe Shun Lee West - it's an overpriced take out. The quality of the food is at best mediocre. I would expect it from some nondescript take out place in the middle of nowhere, but if I am paying over $30 for a main course and almost $10 for a tiny bowl of wonton soup and $8 for dim sum I expect the quality. The food was mildly saying quite disappointing - thick, tasteless wontons were swimming in a tasteless broth and the main $32 course - the ""shredded beef"" was greasy and crusty drowning in carrots and some sticky, gooey sauce. I have had better Chinese food on the UWS (Ollie's, Empire Szechuan). Shun Lee can't even compare to any respectable Chinatown restaurant. Their dim sum was alright - nothing special, but it came with a special price tag of $7.95 per plate - double what you'd pay in Golden Unicorn or Jin Fong. Shun Lee West would not have lasted a month if it had any local competition. In fact, I am amazed its still open. Maybe its the store front for a money laundering business?

I ordered from the Restaurant Week menu: spring rolls, Szechuan sliced scallops (bamboo, mushrooms, water chestnut), fresh pineapple. Complimentary tea is being served, which I believe is a must in Chinese restaurants. For the spicy dishes, they ask you what level of spiciness you want. The main course comes with a choice of brown or white rice. I was disappointed that they use canned mushrooms in the dish. Then, I noticed the plates... After eating at restaurants that serves dishes in nice plates, I realized that you don't come here for the meal presentation. As for the decor, once I entered in the restaurant, it felt so dark. I didn't like the black and red decor, it looks outdated and the white lighting make it worse. Black walls doesn't make the food appetizing.

So why 3 stars? The pricing is ludicrous. You all know I'm a stickler for a good portions-to-price ratio.

The rugs also need to be changed. This was once a very classy place when it since become dated. The chairs are really tacky something you find in a take out Chinese food place. That aside the service was outstanding given the large number of diners. With the exception of the duck spring rolls which were extremely salty and overly oily the food was excellent. The dry shredded beef was as good as I remembered it and the sesame cold noodles were also excellent as well. Yes it's expensive but look where they're located and who they cater to.

1.0,9/27/2015,"I'm sorry to have to write this review, but I think its important to let this restaurant run its course and to prevent people from spending hard-earned money on terrible food. Shun Lee has always been that wonderful Chinese restaurant for special occasions to eat delicious samplings of a range of regions. I've had the Scallops in Garlic Sauce so many places and it is a wonderful, quite spicy dish, dense with vegetables, and often the more flavorful bay scallops. The dish we received here was a watery mess of large overcooked flavorless sea scallops and some mushrooms, which I don't recall even being in the dish. There was no seasoning at all that we could detect. The Shrimp with Lobster Sauce is supposed to be a dense ground pork sauce with shrimp and peas, a comforting thick sauce over rice. When we got were large but overcooked and flavorless shrimp in a watery broth of mushrooms - no ground pork, no peas, so seasoning of any kind. The Szechuan Broccoli was unbelievably undercooked and there was no seasoning of any kind at all. The duck rolls were greasy with only the toughest pieces of duck - overcooked? old? and the regular spring rolls didn't even have cabbage in them. They were just rolls of dough. Everything seemed as if it had been reheated by ecuadorian or mexican domestic help. There was no chef involved in the preparation of any of this food. We should have known when they called to say they were ""out of "" lemon chicken. So, make some more! Clearly they don't make the food.I'm just so sad because this is supposed to be a nice place to go for Chinese food. It is just terrible. And so expensive. The best I can say is that this seems to be happening to all the restaurants in the tri-state area - cutting corners, and using untrained cooks. Food everywhere seems to be greasier, smaller portions, or just plain not what it is supposed to be. And more expensive. This is what happens when a city becomes strangled by the financial community. Restaurant rents go up to where no one can function except McDonalds. Well, no one I know in the city actually eats anything anyway, so maybe this is appropriate. I just have to learn to not care about food anymore. I'll say this, though. We won't be spending $200 on dinners we can't eat anymore. I'd rather have a bowl of cereal at home with a great movie.To sum up, cross Shun Lee West off your restaurant list if you have any tastebuds at all. If you're concerned about your weight, strung out on diet pills, or don't have an appetite, then it is a reasonably attractive place.

1.0,6/7/2015,I have been living on the upper west side for 39 yrs.  Been going to Shun Lee since they opened. I have gotten food poisoning there a few times. I called Henry to tell him and he told me that I am the only one that has ever said that to him. It is quite clear that is not true. People just don't tell them. The food is inconsistent and very expensive. Like my father used to say it's a stiff restaurant. Every time I go online to look at their menu the prices are always higher. The last time I ate there was in January. My friend and her daughter got food poisoning and the tab was over $200. We ate in the cafe too. Don't eat there or have delivery. The only reason why they stay in business is because of the Lincoln Center crowd. The Shun Lee on the East Side is much better. I never order from them anymore. I used to order twice a week. Now maybe once a year. I'm too scared. Is the food going to be good or am I going to get food poisoning again (for the prices to get sick)? I would advise eating at Shun Lee on the East Side. The Upper West Side needs some good Chinese restaurants. I hear that Red Farm on Broadway is excellent. They don't deliver. Too bad.,0,0,0,Toby M.,"New York, NY",0,8,0

I had sliced lamb leg that came on a plate piled up with mushrooms and some Chinese vegetables with a little bitty bawl of rice on the side. Was not impressed at all, i think I had better Chinese food ordered on seamless from a local cheap Chinese restaurant. Appetizers... That's where I messed up and ordered spicy fish tacos... Who the hell orders fish tacos at Chinese restaurant?? It was not tasty at all. Servers are not really nice and some of them barely speak English and have very thick Chinese accent. I mean, I'm not a native speaker myself, but come on now this is pretty expensive restaurant and management could have been more picky and hired servers with better English which I have no doubt are plenty of in NYC, unless they are hiring cousin's cousins and friends lol. Drinks... I didn't consume any alcoholic beverages but my mom and sister did and they were served wrong drinks first, and then the drinks they finally received after 10 minutes were poor quality, according to them. They only good thing I can say is that my parents really liked Beijing duck. The server cuts it for you and rolls it up with vegetables into small Chinese tortillas, comes with a tasty sweet Chinese sauce as well. Anyways, even though I'm not a big fan of Chinese food, I am sure there are plenty of places at the same price range that are way better then this one. Sorryyy",0,2,0,Vlad V.,"New York, NY",38,93,36

We started w/ the fish tacos & dumplings. The fish tacos were a disappointment; mostly a variety of stir fry veggies mixed in w/ bits of fish on a hard taco ... strange combination. The dumplings were really solid though. Nicely sized, packed on the inside & they were served w/ 4 choices of sauces. For entrees we went with Orange beef, Sesame Chicken, Duck (fried) w/ candied cashews along with a side of chicken fried rice. The orange beef & sesame chicken were all very solid. Smaller portions than one would expect for family-style but they were traditionally quite good & a notch up quality wise from the standard versions of these dishes. The duck with cashews was not a memorable dish; the duck was quite fatty, fried and just not tasty. Not juicy at all. I would pass on this dish on a future visit. We wrapped up dessert with some mandarin orange cheesecake & vanilla ice cream & both were very good.Overall Shun Lee West is worth the visit; decor wise it's visually pleasing (although a bit outdated) & yes the menu is a bit overpriced but considering it's a stone's throw from Lincoln Center & in quite a nice neighborhood that should not be a big surprise and in general comes w/ the territory.",3,1,0,James A.,"Fort Lee, NJ",8,30,64

My Husband ordered Grand Marnier shrimp, I had crispy duck and my daughter ordered a chicken dish. The altered the chicken to make it not too spicy and it was very good.

Somehow I justified $100+ Chinese food every time I ordered, because I felt you had high-quality ingredients and you've consistently had an ""A"" grade on your window.I've decided that tonight was the last straw. Over the past few months, you've not only fought with me and told me I'm wrong about my complaint when the dish I've ordered 1-2x a week for years came differently than it was described on the website, telling me ""(I) was wrong"" and continuing to interrupt me every time I tried to explain the differences in what I ordered. Not just a cultural nuance - simply rude and not focused on the customer, who is known by name since I order so frequently.Tonight I ordered dinner in at 6:30pm. At 7:20, we received 3/4 of our order.  When I called, I was told me it would be delivered ASAP. At 7:50pm, I called to find out where the spareribs were; and was told me they were on their way. (Note, we live 3 blocks from the restaurant.) Right now it is 8:45pm, and I've yet to see the spareribs I ordered. As you suggested years ago, I always put in the notes what vegetables I want in the dish I order.  About 5x this year, you've completely ignored my requests. For $22 steamed chicken and veggies, (2x as much as every other Chinese food restaurant charges) I feel justified in having my standard ""no bok choy, and please only broccoli, snow peas, baby corn and mushroom"" request granted. (Thanks anyway for the extra bok choy, green and red peppers and Chinese cabbage you included in my dish tonight.) I hear your message loud and clear - that customer service is not your priority.I hope I can find another Chinese restaurant with good food, but unlike you, who also appreciates my business.

The waiter rushed us through the order process, and seemed angry that we did not order liquor. After a long wait, our soups finally arrived, unfortunately they weren't the soups we ordered. The staff was completely flustered and eventually we received the correct soup. I ordered Sesame chicken for my entree. When the waiter took my order he asked if i preferred steamed or fried. I selected fried as that's how i liked it cooked. When it arrived the waiter scooped it off the serving plate onto mine, but there were no vegetables, yet they were listed on the menu. I asked him where the vegetables were and he said you don't get vegetables if you have your order fried.

The flavor of the scallion was nice, especially with the BBQ-ish sauce served on the side. The saltiness of the sauce kind of masked all that dough. Ma Po Tofu w/Pork [$17.50]: At first glance this dish doesn't look at all appealing. It's rather liquidy with chunks of tofu, brown mushrooms, and shredded pork. It was actually really tasty! I was expecting it to be very spicy because of the star indicating heat as well as the waiter making a comment . Actually, it was just a hint peppery. The portion was HUGE. It arrived in a plate and the ""left overs"" came in a giant bowl on the side. The small bowl of white rice accompanying their entrees definitely isn't cutting it.

I made an early reservation on a Saturday night before the ballet and yes, what all my fellow yelpers say is true, the average age is 90 +.  We had a drink at the bar and the bartenders were funny with their own little schtick of cheesy jokes...loved it!  The bartender made a perfectly nice Manhattan for me and a Jameson on the rocks for my date. After enjoying the bar the Host sat us at a great booth in the center of the room. Our waiter didn't speak English that well, my date insists that it's all a show, but the service was punctual and efficient. We started with a great Muscadet which at $35 a bottle was a great buy. For food we had the spring rolls which were very good but we're talking it breaks down to about $6 a roll. For entrees we decided to split the Prawns with garlic and scallions and the crispy shredded beef. They were nice enough to split the entrees for us and plate them in the   back, which I loved, and each dish was fabulous. The prawns were huge, and the sauce sublime. The crispy beef, although I know was so fattening, was YUMMY. I loved everything about my experience last night....kitschy NYC experience definitely be back!!!!",2,1,2,Leslie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",82,444,2
5.0,6/4/2013,"Best upscale americanized chinese food in all of NYC. The man behind this place (Michael Tong) created what millions order everyday from their takeout place (general tso's chicken but its called chan do chicken on their menu). The decor of paper machete monkeys and dragons and black booths has not changed in decades and I love it. The service is always great and portions are well sized. I recommend the pork fried dumplings, chicken lettuce wraps, prawns in spicey garlic sauce, sesame chicken and dry shredded crispy beef. Fun fact, this is Michael Douglas' favorite chinese restaurant. Sat next to him and Catherine Zeta Jones a few years ago and look closely at that dinner scene in Wall Street 2.

4.0,4/28/2013,"We ate here last night, a party of 4 for dinner at 8. The entire staff was as cordial and helpful as they could be. Our friend had recently hurt his back and found the booth seating for 4 too uncomfortable (it was a bit tight but adequate). They had no problem giving us a regular table with chairs although we did have to wait about 5 minutes at the bar. We had a drink and were adorably entertained by the bartender who told us several self deprecating jokes relating to his Chinese background, all in good fun,but clearly not politically correct which none of us are so it was very enjoyable.Before dinner we shared spring rolls which were very basic but still good. We ordered 4 entrees which we shared. The fillet mignon,orange beef,poached Chilean sea bass and the roast pork lo mein. Each dish was excellent however the portions were not very big,but adequate. No one left hungry but I would have liked a bit larger portion for the price. Still the food was very tasty.The decor is nice, done predominantly in black and white with golden Asian paper mache dragons. Not a reason for me to visit; almost a bit cliche but not offensive at all. It was crowded when we arrived but the noise level wasn't bad. One unexpected bonus, if you're into this, Alan Alda (M.A.S.H.) came in shortly after us for dinner. I'm a NYer and have seen celebs before in restaurants and never react to them.

All of it was amazing and the portions were really generous, but still... it was more than $100. We enjoyed the service very much.  We went after a show at Lincoln Center, and the restaurant was almost empty.  The waiter was very attentive.  They came extremely quickly with our food, and hot towels, very nice. The decor was a little dated, but appropriate: gold paper mache dragons adorning the walls.  Truly, I loved it.  It was fun.  The music they had playing the background was intoxicating...musack versions of songs you know... we spent quite some time trying to identify each song.  Maybe not our favorite part of the experience.  All in all, the service was fantastic, and the food superb--if you're looking to splurge (and for our anniversary, we were okay with that), Shun Lee may fit the bill.",3,1,1,Jacey P.,"New York, NY",85,30,0

1.0,11/25/2012,"Don't often write reviews but really had a negative experience at Shun Lee West last night. Shun Lee Palace on the East Side remains fine and an acceptable choice for Americanized Chinese food with good quality preparation and ingredients. At the Lincoln Center location (SL West) the food has generally been inferior for years, so I hadn't been in quite a while, but the service too has become appallingly rude and truly unacceptable. Our appetizers arrived after the main course of mediocre Peking Duck (compared to the East Side), and both were bad. When queried, the curt reply was ""the kitchen is very busy"" which was evident, but there was no attempt at politeness or an apology. Of the appetizers, one was a cold tofu dish and the other soup dumplings known as  xiao long bao, which had thick doughy skins, no soup and were shaped like Jiao-Tse or gyoza -- but the worst gyoza you've ever eaten. I politely asked about them, and was told ""that was Shun Lee style"". We concluded the meal with a house special fried rice, which was truly delicious but did not make up for the poor service and mediocre to poor first and second courses. Also, the noise level was very high with waiters barking at each other without regard to patrons sitting trying to maintain the semblance of a civilized dinner.

The meal opened with cold, greasy wonton chips that doesn't compare to the takeout place by my house. Our first dish, the Sichuan boullabaise (15), was delicious but the portion was small. The stock was thin but flavorful - tangy, spicy, with chunks of fish and shrimp and shellfish.Our first entree was the orange beef (30)- supposedly popularized by the restaurant chain. Slices of beef are deep fried until crispy then tossed in an Asian orange stir-fry sauce. What could have been a tantalizing dish was unfortunately plagued by an overwhelming aftertaste of egg yolk.We ordered stir fried pea shoots (22), which were very tender and delicious, though the portion was unexpectedly small. We also ordered a Schezuan style water-poached fish (33), tender fish slices coated in cornstarch then quickly submerged in hot water, then covered in a sweet-sour sauce. Good effort, but you can get the same thing for about half the price, and more authentic flavor, at any Chinatown/ Flushing restaurant.The biggest disappointment of the night were the lamb chops(32). Even my ten year old sister, with a dulled palate that opts for ice cream and toast  said they tasted like ""dust"" - plain and simple, and I had to agree. The chops were sloppily properly trimmed, did not taste freshly butchered, nor they have much flavor. They were dry and tasteless. The stir-fried veggies that accompanied it were bland.I must say that I left Shun Lee disappointed. The service was pushy, the food was mediocre and way too overpriced. And to top it off the dishes looked nothing like the photos Shun Lee boasts on its website. I couldn't help but wonder if  the food came promptly because it was barely 6pm on a Sunday and the  restaurant was relatively empty. One is better off commuting down into Chinatown for a dining experience that's a lot more satisfying and superior in taste for at least half the price and less pushy service.Two star's only because I'm currently craving the seafood soup right now.",4,0,0,Han S.,"New York, NY",38,138,316

Although Shun Lee and Shun Lee Cafe are technically separate, I'm pretty sure the food comes from the same kitchen. I thought this place was the best dim sum I have ever had. I am not exaggerating with this. I have been to dim sum on numerous occasions along the east coast in various locations. Dim Sum is one of my favorite meals and I have had good and bad experiences. The quality here was absolutely superb. The shrimp shu-mai, shrimp chung-fun, beef chow fun, and baby bak choi were all incredible. One issue with Chinese Food anywhere is quality of meat - here the quality was great.I really can't begin to express my confusion at the reviews I have seen. I have never had anything cooked poorly. The last time I was there was in January, so maybe they have changed management and changed their quality of food since then? I'm not sure - but my experiences have been incredible.The service was fine. Nothing bad about it. The reason I did not give this 5 stars is because the prices are VERY VERY high and the portions are small. If your meal is for two and you're very hungry, expect to pay anywhere from $70-$100 to be filled.

We know what kind of food it is ... we asked a question ... just say ""no"" if something is not on the menu.  Don't retort like we are stupid idiots wasting your time while we are about to spend $18.95 on the most flavorless fried rice we've ever had.  When it was time to go I did not want to leave a big tip, and wrote the tip out on the slip and deliberately kept it in front of me so they would not grab it while I was still there.  They tried to grab the slip from me several times in just a couple minutes.  I kept saying that I was leaving soon, but they could not wait like the waiters do at every other restaurant in America.  We were waiting for our young son to finish his meal, and they kept trying to take that away from him.  The whole place and staff were odd and we will not be returning.",0,0,0,Stuart C.,"Baltimore, MD",98,2,0

4.0,11/25/2011,"If Tony Montana from Scarface were to ever design a restaurant interior it would look something like this. As you make your entrance down a scary, dark corridor, monkey statues with glowing red eyes greet you. Enter the dragon room for main dining, which looks like it could have been a 70s nightclub at one time. You could easily picture Tony doing yeyo at one of the corner tables. Although you won't exactly see that at Shun Lee, what you will see is some of the best Chinese food in NYC when you eat here.There's a lot of hate on this site for this place and I can't understand why. A lot of complaints seem to be about the prices. I won't sugar coat it. Just to give you an idea, you will pay about  $30 for an entree or $15 for dumplings. Some people think that all Chinese food should be dirt cheap. I'm not Chinese American and even I'm offended by that. To me, if the food quality stands out then it's worth it. In my experience a lot of Chinese places tend to overdo it with the sauces to the point where your food is swimming in a pool of goop. At Shun Lee they know the right amount of flavor to add so your meal is never doused in sauce. This is also a fine dining experience so you won't get all the typical standards in here. Don't expect to walk in and get General Tso's chicken. I had the sesame chicken and although it wasn't exactly standard, it beat out any sesame chicken I've ever had. People tend to believe that if you eat at any place that serves ethnic cuisine and if you see other people of that same ethnicity eating there then that's a good sign. I've never found that to be true. People in other parts of the world have different palates. At Shun Lee you're probably going to see a bunch of people that look like they are on a Mormon retreat, but don't let that deter you. The food is really authentic here. It's always tough finding decent food in the Lincoln Center area that is worthy of the price you pay for eating there. If a place has outdoor seating near Lincoln Center it seems that they can serve garbage and people will pay whatever they tell them to pay.

We made a reservation on OpenTable (well we kept changing our reservation time but that's another story) and we were on our way. I guess the first mistake was deciding to dine in the main restaurant rather than the cafe. We don't mind paying high prices but when the quality of the food is subpar and you barely get enough to be full at the end, we take issue.Being very famished from a day of shopping we ordered Spring Rolls ($10.25), Orange Beef ($26.95), Egg Foo Young ($24.95) and Chicken Chow Mein ($24.95). We THOUGHT this was going to be more than enough and were presented the Spring Rolls. They were two greasy little fried rods that had even more grease contained within and absolutely no taste to them at all. Next up was the orange beef which was a little more flavorful but the beef was not quality, disappointing. The egg foo young was very good but as with everything else, not enough. Lastly the chicken chow mein was the oddest of all as it tasted like chicken pot pie gravy over hard crispy wonton strips and strips of chicken.So there were a few lessons learned today:1.

1.0,12/19/2010,"Did you know: years, years, years ago, Shun Lee was a very fancy, incredibly creative, upscale Chinese restaurant of considerable class. This was the connoisseur's Chinese restaurant of choice before heading across the street to Lincoln Center for a concert.These days, while the decor has remained, the food has changed. Considerably. I don't know if they've changed management or executive chefs, but the food now is night and day from what it was years ago. If I were served Shun Lee take-out, I wouldn't be able to discern a difference between food from Happy Panda's Chinese Yum-Yum Takeout.*The difference is the price. At Happy Panda's Chinese Yum-Yum Takeout, you can get Peking Duck for $7 and $4 for Chicken with Broccoli.** At Shun Lee, they are $32 and $26 respectively.So why does this place still get business? Why does it need to exist? Perhaps the Lincoln Center location is telling: the clientele is one of often-obnoxious pretension; a cohort who would never frequent a ""normal"" Chinatown Chinese restaurant*** out of fear of being seen.That and this city has a shocking lack of PF Chang's.I jest.

3.0,2/18/2010,"Shun Lee West is a full service restaurant with a sleek black decor and large golden dragons adorning the wall.  While there is no dress code, most patrons will have a collared shirt and / or sports jacket.  A friend, (non-Asian), wanted to try the special Chinese New Year tasting menu but wanted my opinion.  I've been here for private parties before and the food was fine so I readily agreed to accompany him.Plate 1 Appetizers:2 steamed pork dumplings in a sweet soy and a hint of chili oil.  This may have been the best of the appetizers.  1 BBQ spare rib - meat was falling off the bone.1 fried crab claw.1 fried shrimp with the head.  A bit dry so there was no ""juice"" from the head, which is usually the best part.Plate 2 - Tasting Entrees:Fish (tilapia?) with sliced water chestnuts and baby snow peas.  The snow peas were great.Sliced stir fried venison.  Slight hint of spiciness and may have been the best serving of the night. A ground up shrimp ball cover with rice.Plate 3 - Tasting Entree:Beijing Duck.  Sliced duck with cucumbers rolled like a burrito.  Sweet plum (hoisen) sauce on the side.Plate 4 - Tasting Entree:1 lobster claw and 1/2 lobster tail.Braised veal shank.  Lots of bone marrow in the shank if you enjoy that type of fatty flavor.Plate 5 - Dessert:Square slice of frozen chocolate cheesecake.  Not traditional Asian if you hadn't already figured it out.Assorted fruit - fresh pineapple, canned lychees, canned Mandarin orange slices.Additional complimentary green tea ice cream.Overall the food is fine but I would stick with ordering ala carte from the regular dinner menu.  Obviously, Shun Lee is more Americanized in flavor.  You will also spend about 3X more than your average restaurant for Chinese cuisine but if you want full service, this is the place as the staff will cater to all your needs without being overbearing.It's funny how no one seems to complain about the high prices charged at French or Italian restaurants but seemed outraged when an Asian or Mexican restaurant charges more than $10 per person.  Does pasta really cost that much more than lo mein? But I digress.btw- Takeout and delivery seems to be very popular so the place does have it's fans and willing to pay a premium even without the service.  Yes, you can get better, more authentic food at cheaper prices in Flushing or Chinatown.  However, service and cleanliness has never been a strong point in the majority of Asian restaurants.  Shun Lee excels in this category.Cheers!N.",3,0,2,Nelson X.,"New York, NY",13,138,6

Everything was great again.  The wine list is extensive and very international, and we enjoyed several bottles.  We shared four main courses (again, plated for us) - leg of lamb with leeks, scallops, lemon chicken, and, of course, orange beef.  (Shun Lee's owner is the creator of the orange beef dish, now served in every American Chinese restaurant.)  Each dish was terrific.  For example, the Red Fire scallops were ""Coated with water chestnut flowers and cooked until crisp, then quick sautéed with asparagus, bell peppers and hot peppers.""  The sauces, on the lamb as well as the scallops, chicken, and beef, were all tantalizing compliments to the dishes.They have a dim sum room, but we prefer the traditional menu and impressive main dining room rather than dim sum for dinner.  Located one block from Lincoln Center, this is the perfect place to go before a Lincoln Center performance.",2,2,2,Dennis S.,"Kihei, HI",522,1607,8
3.0,5/18/2009,"Other reviewers have clearly described this restaurant. Expensive Chinese food that is good but no better than your neighborhood place. Brusque service with waiters so authentically Chinese they barely speak English. The seafood bouillabaisse is probably their best dish - tangy spicy broth with an abundance of fresh seafood.

Our party of three also had poached Chilean sea bass, a noodle dish, asparagus sauteed with garlic (excellent) and duck, roasted and then chopped up so it's served in chunks, meat, bone and skin together. Also excellent although no one could eat it neatly.The big problem with this restaurant IMHO is that the food is greatly Americanized. I prefer something more authentic. OTOH, chop suey and chow mein are not on the menu.I enjoyed the visit but $175 with tip for three people is excessive.

Regardless of the fact that this is about as far from Authentic Chinese as you can get (consider it high-end ""take-out style""), irrespective of the fact that the clientele is primarily geriatric (making the atmosphere sedate and stuffy), and independent of the fact that service is slightly brusque and terribly informal for what you'd expect in these kind of surroundings, I somehow actually really enjoy the food here.I've only eaten here when other people paid, of course it was also them who chose the restaurant -- knowing that I like ""foreign fare"" and ""exotic eats"" and can handle myself very well in an ""upscale"" setting, this place has mysteriously somehow on multiple occasions been deemed an ideal match for a perfect date spot with me... Maybe they wanted to impress me? I would much rather see them (and have them see me) gnawing on a fish head or femur -- I keeps it real.$20 for BBQ ribs? They better be damn good!

If I saw the bill and I think about it in relation to how good my food was and how much food I got, I would probably knock it down a little.The presentation of the food is really cool here, from the cow carved out of some kind of vegetable, to the nice arrangements of the food on your plate. However, this is no Panda Express or Wang Chung's Chinese Express (don't search that, I just made that up), where you get an incredible amount of Chinese food. The portions are much smaller here, as it is one of those dressy places where they only use about 50% of the plate at least from what we got, which is fine, but definitely not the place to go if you're trying to get a feast on a budget. I had a vegetarian plate, all of which was really good!When I was there, Richard Dreyfuss and Alec Baldwin were there too, which was pretty neat. In their Yelp reviews, I'm sure they'll say that ""Dave C. was there when we were there!"" kidding...If you're there with a large group and decide to get the Voss water instead of tap water, be prepared. They will fill your water glass over and over the second it starts even evaporating. I can't even imagine what our water bill was. I had to tell them to stop!Guys, make sure you at least have a collared shirt, if not a jacket when you go (preferably the jacket), otherwise you'll feel underdressed!",3,1,3,Dave C.,"Denver, CO",841,509,1140

1.0,10/3/2008,"Shun Lee is situated between the northernmost edge of Columbus circle and Central Park West on a quiet block that is like anything but New York City after office hours. Perhaps that's why they chose that area--to fit in with their other-time, other-place ambiance. But like that block the effect of the restaurant is one of confusion, isolation and the fear that at any moment something bad can happen. That something bad is Shun Lee's food.I digress. Shun Lee was probably conceived after watching Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom's opening sequence set in a shanghai nightclub. Asian gangsters wearing silk suits, skinny ties and maniacal grins made that scene not just campy but offensive. (Let's face it: Indy liked having shady people of color around to beat up or employ as his dark man-servants.) So, its with no small bit of tongue-in-cheek sensibility that Shun Lee is decorated with papier marche monkeys peering down from the walls with glowing red eyes and the Chinese waiters wear bow ties and pin stripe suits (looking good guys, orientalism notwithstanding).  What's next? The Step 'N Fetchit Rib Shack staffed by escaped slaves and mammies?Let's put all that shit aside for a second and talk about the food. Now, I went to Shun Lee with a group of coworkers and we ordered a massive amount of sampler plates. Each dish was brought out in small portions, each as flavorless as the last. The short ribs were clearly cooked patiently over a long period of time but the chef must have been watching Lord of the Rings or something, because he seemed to have forgotten that food is supposed to have spice in it. Especially Chinese food.I'll give Shun Lee points for their sake menu. I'll give them points for knowing how to make a good Jameson and ginger. But the plexi-glassed $4 roast pork lo mein joint across the street from me trumps them in the kitchen. And I'd prefer the ambiance in Gone With the Wind to this place.",7,5,1,Alex I.,"Los Angeles, CA",140,137,3
4.0,8/6/2008,"I had a great time at Shun Lee, and really enjoyed the traveling dim sum carts that came from table to table offering all kinds of dumplings, spring rolls, turnovers and fried everything you can imagine.  Basically we ate whatever our waitress suggested because she seemed so excited about everything on the cart that we couldn't say no.  It was all really good and I love the ability to sample it all.We probably should have quit right there, but we thought the menu entrees looked much too good to pass up, and we were right.  I recommend the sauteed stringbeans, but dont share, they're too good to split.  I've always had a hard time finding restaurants I like near Lincoln Center, so this was a particularly nice find.",2,0,0,Debbie W.,"New York, NY",181,497,6
2.0,8/5/2008,"I went to Shun Lee a long time ago, so if it has changed for the better since then, I apologize.  I took my mother-in-law and her friend there thinking to go somewhere nice.  But it was very disappointing.  The service was good.  But the dishes were very average.  And for a restaurant that's supposed to be nice, I expect details like de-veining the shrimps, but no!  It immediately turned me off and I have not been back since.",3,0,0,Linda K.,"Hoboken, NJ",80,87,39
1.0,5/5/2008,"Bad...really bad...I remember the food here was great years ago.  I was thinking of this great shredded chicken dish they had which was soo good.  I asked for it again and the waiter was rude and extremely unhelpful.  He kept on interrupting me when I was trying to explain the dish I had before.  In the end, he said they don't have it which was fine.  But he was really abrupt and rude.  Once the food arrived, everything was bland.  The chicken was bland, the spicey shrimp was bland.  It was just not an interesting meal at all.  The only good thing was they seated us right away so that my mom and I'd make it in time for a symphony at Lincoln Center.  But now I know they're food is no longer good so I have no reason to go there.  Not even for a quick bite before a show at Lincoln Center.  I wasted money big time for bad food; I could have gotten better food from a Chinese takeout which would have been 1/4 of the price this establishment charged.",5,0,2,Dorim L.,"Chicago, IL",104,545,3
4.0,5/3/2008,"I have been living in this area for almost 2 years and have just had the chance to go to Shun Lee.It was great! I love the scary red eye monkeys on the walls and the whole Shaghai 40s glamour (or to some early 90s modern) decor was a nice change of pace in the middle of NYC.Service was nice in that they make your plate table side before setting out the rest of the food.I would say that the entrees are about 10-20% overpriced; but, I guess that makes up for it when you don't feel like crossing the park for Philippe.Also, the fruit frogs are a cute suprise.",0,0,0,justin v.,"NY, NY",20,364,0
1.0,4/2/2008,"This place is completely mediocre and overpriced.

2.0,3/2/2008,"Glorified Chinese food - a mockery even. This place has golden dragons adorning their walls but it's clearly catering to non-Asians, as the food is all telling. Not authentic in the least bit, this place is a real copout and sellout to Chinese food. They charge you to subsidize their rent during this journey on their magic carpet ride as well. Catered towards Met Opera goers who have the money to splurge because 'it's convenient' to dine there. Don't say I didn't warn you.",3,0,1,Jeff C.,"New York, NY",1152,1258,14
4.0,2/19/2008,"Don't be a hater, this place rules. It's elegant and the food is unbelievable. I've dined at SL many times over the years, but my meal this past weekend was classic and worth remembering. We were 4 at our table. For apps we had the chicken soong (an SL specialty) and spring rolls. Our mains were dry crispy beef (another specialty, like candy); prawns with ginger and garlic sauce; chan-do chicken nuggets; stir-fried noodles with pork, shrimp and chicken; and eggplant. This was, my friends, as good as it gets. The nice peeps at SL even threw in a plate of honey-roasted pecans. Sheh-sheh, baby.",7,7,8,andy t.,"New York, NY",329,442,33
4.0,1/19/2008,"Came here before War & Peace Opera at the Met (yes it was 4 hours long).  Fell in love with this place, I felt like I stepped back in the 1960's with the pink and black decor.  The food was really quite great too, very old school.I mean where else can you pay four dollars for ONE egg roll!  It was actually a great egg roll.  We also ordered the spare ribs which was a very generous portion and succulent.  There was a ton of meat, very juicy, and the sauce was delectable.  We ordered a shrimp dish (cannot remember which one now) but it was a little overcooked, although still tasty, not sure how that worked out.Service is great as well, it's like fine dining Chinese.  Love that concept.  It's such an institution too, my parents came here before I existed.I think it's a great experience, but come here with someone who doesn't mind spending a lot of money.  It's quite pricey, especially for me.While, I won't be back (unless the 'rents are in town) it was great!",0,0,0,Rebecca H.,"Brooklyn, NY",116,174,66
3.0,11/3/2007,"My buddy and I went there on a Thurs night, no problems getting a table.  To start we had the szechuan wontons, good but not as hot/spicy as indicated.  For the entree we split the Smoked Duckling, Szechuan Style and Lo Mein with roast pork.  The Duck was very good, nice and tender.  The Lo Mein was good as well, but small in portion.  In general it is pricey american style chinese, but not the typical greasy/heavy stuff.  Service was excellent, the waitstaff were efficient and attentive.  In the background they're constantly fluttering around.  Ambiance, it kinda felt like the joint was a swank lounge/dance club in a former life.  Would I go back?  It's worth a 2nd try.",1,0,1,J V.,"Woodside, NY",7,122,0

2.0,10/4/2007,"I'm so thirsty and it's all Shun Lee's fault. I was intrigued by this place because the delivery menu is SO expensive. I thought, it must be great, or the portions must be big enough for 4 people. I mean $17 for sesame chicken? It didn't come in a bucket, just a regular plastic take out container. The flavor was good, better than some chinese places but who honestly eats gourmet chinese food? I eat chinese food when I am lazy, or hungover and in both instances, I don't want to pay $17+ for 1 dish. The hot and sour soup, good but worth $5.75? No way Jose. Oh yeah and I am SO thirsty.",1,0,1,Meg P.,"New York, NY",29,176,0

4.0,2/13/2007,"Fancy - a good place for a large group.  The servers are attentive and amusing.  I went with a large group from work and we enjoyed a 9 course meal.  The server would bring out the dish, announce it, give us 5 seconds to admire the fancy vegetable carvings (e.g. bull on a rock, phoenix), and bring it back to the kitchen where the dish was served onto individual plates brought out to us.  The food is tasty and the small portions are just right considering the multiple courses.  Good wine list.  However, the vegetarian options are limited - we had 2 vegetarians in the group and it seemed so depressing everytime they showed off the meat dish for the majority and then brought out a plain dish of string beans for the vegetarians.  Shun Lee's chef has some interesting creations -- there is a dish where they create ""strawberries"" using minced shrimp covered in a red sesame.  Interesting place to try at least once.",2,0,2,Diana N.,"NY, NY",73,646,0

2.0,11/3/2006,Perhaps it's because I spend 3-4 months a year in China that I just don't see the allure of this place.

The menu, which encompasses Szechuan, Cantonese, Hunan, and Shanghai cuisines, is guaranteed to spoil your taste for take-out from your local chop suey joint. The wonton soup, with a chicken broth rich with stuffed dumplings, shrimp, and chunks of pork, is suberb. Among the appetizing entrees are chicken with nuts in a tasty brown sauce, filet of sea bass sauteed in rice wine with water chestnuts and snow peas, and rack of lamb with a very spicy kick.

3.0,8/15/2005,"A bit like Tommy Toy's but better food. On our last visit, everything was very dramatic, from the greeting at the door to the introduction of our dishes to the wine list presentation. We found it very entertaining, especially since everyone is just having fun. The main dining room has two tiers, with sunken area in the center. It's dimly lit with black walls and reddish backlights along the floors shooting upward, giving the place a very cool feel. A bit dated, but cool. We sat on the second tier with perfect view of the dragon sculpture sitting on the upper wall, wrapped around the entire room. Sounds strange but it all went so well. They serve traditional Chinese dishes but, for some reason that I can't explain, everything tastes so much healthier -- maybe less salt, less oil? Their version of kung pao chicken was quite good,  and we especially enjoyed Ants Climb on Tree -- bits of beef on cellophane noodles and a spicy sauce. It was very tasty.  It's more of an experience than great food so keep that in mind when you go. It's a comfortable enough place to relax, take your time and people watch while you enjoy each course. Note: They also have take out.",2,0,0,Lizelle G.,"San Francisco, CA",60,210,30
