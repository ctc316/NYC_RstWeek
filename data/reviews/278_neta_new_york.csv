3.0,4/23/2019,"Good food, but okay service and overpricedCame here twice for dinner. Neta's menu selection for dinner is very small - only sushi and some tiny starters. No set, no poke... I spent $50+ here but still left a bit hungry",2,0,1,Wenye X.,"New York, NY",315,113,255

There is so much food! Tasty salad, scallop, crispy rice and best dessert! One star off for not having a better sushi selection. Sushi is your basics with a little sauce on it etc - could be more creative and add at least a couple interested pieces of fish. Tasty overall and nice simple atmosphere.

2.0,4/11/2019,Food was good but overpriced compared to other excellent Japanese places. We went here for a date night and they were nice with taking a pic of us. Location is also kind of out of place just off NYUs sprawling campus. I guess it's a good place to go to impress a date so we personally wouldn't go back.

2.0,4/1/2019,"At the restaurant now doing the mid tier omakase. Very disappointed. Fish does not melt in your mouth like at other restaurants.

5.0,3/25/2019,"Dined here back in February for their restaurant week lunch. It's always a treat to splurge and treat yourself while in NYC. It pains me to say as a Chicagoan that overall New York and the east cost beats the pants off the Midwest for Sushi. I'm reminded of this frequently, but the pain is quelled by the delicious, fresh joys of restaurants like Neta.The Neta's prix fixe menu was generous and provided a nice range of choices. I went with the assorted sashimi, added the Toro Caviar, the Umami Donburi bowl, and finished with a Monaka and banana ice cream.Each piece of sashimi was well cut, flavorful and distinctive. I really savored the individual fish pieces and miss that freshness. The Toro Caviar was presented with crust less toast, with a sense of flare and class in dish. It was decadent, mouth-watering, and well matched with the light crust of toast. Well worth the splurge. It was not overwhelming, more mild, then a finish of savory salt. Both my umami donburi bowl and my wife's ikura salmon bowl were excellent, I actually preferred the Ikura's raw buttery salmon with simple Ikura. The saltiness of the Ikura roe was all you needed to go with the well seasoned rice.My umami bowl was generous with the umami, balanced with crunchy daikon texture, smooth albacore and the savory Unagi. I think it was more complicated than the rest of our dishes and it's maybe why it felt out of place. I would say on its own it was still an excellent entree. We finished with 2 banana ice cream monakas. It started as one, then after we each had a bite, quickly decided we need more of this in our lives. Right now. Distinctive homemade miso banana icecream really featured the banana and a sweet, caramelly finish, coupled by an impossibly crisp and light monaka sandwich. As I write this, I'm salivating. Service overall was excellent, attentive, prompt, and polite. Props for handling the bustling Monday lunch crowd.",0,0,0,Cary C.,"Chicago, IL",7,71,38

4.0,2/1/2019,"Versatile menu for restaurant week - appetizers had the option of sushi or kabocha salad.  The kabocha salad was pretty creative, with a creamy dressing topped with parmesan cheese and pecans and I have to say the flavors and textures worked really well together.  I wasn't as enthusiastic about the chicken main entree though - it was cooked well and for white meat it was relatively tender and I don't have any specific complaints about the way it was prepared but it just didn't pop to me.  The desert was excellent - banana ice cream with a fruit tart that had a perfect level of sweetness.",0,0,0,Lauren H.,"New York, NY",3,127,296

3.0,1/29/2019,I came here for restaurant week for lunch maybe two years ago and recalled having a great experience so decided to come back this year again for their restaurant week menu but for dinner this time. Both times the sushi is fresh and delicious. Literally melts in your mouth. However the entrees - both chicken and the fish dish was very disappointing. Both entrees were dry and not as flavorful. It was decorated very pretty though so I give them props for their presentation. The dessert was also not to my liking... Overall sushi experience still remains a 4.5/5 but my overall dining experience today was a 3.5/5.,1,0,0,Wendy T.,"Queens, NY",368,190,406
4.0,1/27/2019,"Great value for what you get! Came with the brother for lunch on a Sunday at 1230pm. We had reservations so when we got here we were immediately seated at the sushi bar. We both opted for the $26 dollar pp restaurant week special. I got the Neta sushi with Salmon Ikura don. He got the Neta sashimi with the Szechuan Salmon Don. AMBIANCE:Definitely check out the sushi bar here if you get the chance! It's definitely very refreshing to be able to see all the line cooks and chefs make your food in front of you. It's quite an experience!PROS:Both our szechuan salmon don and the salmon ikura don were incredible! Fish we had was incredibly tasty and fresh, the roe was very tasty, and the garnishes on top of the szechuan salmon bowl gave a unique crunchy/seaweed like taste to it. Highly recommend the szechuan salmon bowl as it is quite unique and the flavor profile and textures are more complicated compared to the salmon ikura don!Sushi fish was great and very fresh. I got scallops, hamachi, salmon, and I believe fatty tuna. Tuna hands down was the favorite cut as I do tend to favor fattier fishes, and salmon comes at a close second. Delicious fish indeed! Sashimi was just as fresh. Crab legs were definitely the highlight for that appetizer. CONS:Biggest complaint would be the size of the sushi we got was rather small, and the ratio between fish and rice seemed rather off. The rice was tiny in comparison to the size of the fish we got. *Note - portion size does tend to be on the smaller side, so we were still slightly hungry after the meal. OVERALL:Definitely would come back to Neta! I would try their omakase option as I heard great things about it. But overall had a pleasant experience and highly recommend their restaurant week menu as you get an incredible value for incredible food and great flavors!",4,1,3,Jonghan L.,"Manhattan, NY",279,137,379
3.0,1/25/2019,The sushi is fresh and the flavor of the entree is good. The ice cream is the best part. But here is the problem.

2.0,12/24/2018,"This place has changed so much. I came here 3 years ago and had the omakase which was really good, the ambiance was what you would expect when going for a nice Japanese omakase.I came back here recently and it is completely different now. I was skeptical that I managed to find a last minute booking for weekend dinner the night before, but I thought I was just lucky. The music is way too loud for somewhere where omakase is being served. When I asked if the music could be turned down more, the waiter said it's a weekend night and he could not lower the music level. I could hardly hear my friends who were seating two seats away from me at the sushi barThe food is not that great, the quality was no where near where it was two years ago. None of the items served in the omakase had me impressed. I don't see a point coming here for an omakase where you could get a much better experience and quality food for the same price. All in all, Neta used to be great, they had unique dishes in their omakase. Now, the quality just does not justify the price of their omakase menu and the loud music is horrible. I see this place now as a fusion place for drinks and that's pretty much it.",0,0,0,B Q.,"New York, NY",3,3,0

1.0,8/14/2018,The $150 omakase was not impressed. The kitchen was busy (and noisy) and the waiting time between courses was long. The reason for 1/5 star was that one kitchen guy used his cell phone in the kitchen with gloves on and then turned back to prepare my food without changing gloves.

Horrible experience with a server who was the only one wore suit (8/10). I was looking for a server to grab me something.

4.0,8/11/2018,"Of course every time restaurant week rolls around I have to try out all fancier places listed. I would say this place is a solid 4 star fancy Japanese restaurant. I believe there is a private room in the back, but since the kitchen is an open kitchen style, the space was a bit cramped and it was a bit hot! To start we got the sushi and the potato leek soup. The sushi was very much just okay, it was fresh, but nothing that special in terms of the ingredients. The potato leek soup though was amazing. I really liked the crunchy fried rice and the beets were super refreshing as well. For our mains, we got the market fish and the chicken. The pictures speak for themselves, it was spectacular. Something about the fungi flakes being on top of the chicken created such a dynamic pairing of flavors. The one dessert that I think deserves to be called out is the truffle panna cotta. Much like the chicken, the truffle really was top notch and made the whole dessert even more enjoyable. I believe there was an azuki pudding that was so smooth as well. I would come back here and try their tasting menu since I wasn't too impressed with their sushi. But I would definitely be willing to try a more comprehensive menu as all of their other dishes were amazing quality and seemed like the chef put a lot of thought into the ingredients.",1,1,1,Sarah C.,"New York, NY",396,144,193

But! I have to admit when I had my sushi plate (was very skeptical), it tasted fresh. 3) the service, I arrived in the restaurant, wasn't too busy on a Sunday 1pm, host was using his cell...I literally standing in front of him for a good 10 mins before he served me...a bit disappointed...but again...the staff (including the host) was friendly during my stay...so...",1,0,0,Jiffy D.,"Jersey City, NJ",1,11,23
1.0,8/2/2018,"The price is just not well worth. I ordered fish sashimi, chicken, and grilled salmon. Maybe because there are too many orders, the food quality is below my expectation. The grilled side of the salmon is too salty (I can still taste the salt granules), and the texture of chicken tastes like the boiled chicken breast in my diet meal. Beside 40-mins waiting time, the service is not very satisfying. Maybe since the restaurant is fully occupied, the number of servers may not be enough. If you are looking for a place where you can talk to your friends, date, etc., I don't recommend this restaurant because this place is too loud.

But I still wanted to give this place a shot because of the reviews on their fresh seafood. Unfortunately, everything fell below expectations (except the bill, which was way above my expectations...)We ordered happy hour cocktails, both of which were very meh compared to most restaurant standards in the area. A bottle of Soju was good but pricey at $40 for a 300 mL bottle. Chicken Karage: sweet and almost peanutbuttery sauce, crisp, tasty little bites. (4/5) Szechuan Spiced Salmon: not spicy at all since they coat the salmon with a healthy amount of mayo, it's an interesting dish that looks like a giant sushi. Tasty but I personally don't love the mayo (3.5/5)Grilled Diver Scallop with Uni: really delicious and surprisingly elegant presented in a giant scallop shell with foam on top (5/5)Sushi Set: ordered 1 set per person which included 8 pieces of nigiri, an 8-piece roll (salmon avocado), and 2 pieces of tamago. The fish quality was actually decent for the price, but the rice was dry. Very strange... I usually never remove rice from my nigiri but I had to because it was actually hard on the outside. (3/5)What really kills the value factor is the actual space, which feels like it hasn't been updated in 20 years. The prices on the menu are probably 15-20% too high for the ambiance and gave me a bit of buyers remorse.

We did the 110 omakase. Food was modern and fish was fresh. Honestly our experience was very good because of the beverage director Josh who was so friendly and helpful with the menu / drink list unlike the other waiters who seemed kind of clueless for a high end restaurant.  Also the hostess was very sweet as well.

By the time we had left, the place was completely packed - not a single table in sight. We both started off with the Neta Sushi, with 5 pieces of sushi - salmon, albacore, tuna, sawara, and hamachi. This was my first time having sawara and oh man, i think it was my favorite part of the sushi plate. The texture was just so different than any other piece of sushi I have had before. I had the Sake Ikura Salmon Don with Scottish Salmon, shoyu marinade ikura, and roasted garlic wasabi-soy. The salmon was so fresh and the ikura was very well seasoned. I really enjoyed this don. Coworker had the Umami Donburi with grilled unagi, or eel, albacore tataki, pickled daikon, avocado, and a ginger-kurozu sauce. His was also super good - very, very flavorful and all the components meshed very well together. We both had the Persimmon Tart, which I really enjoyed. The homemade ice cream, which I think was kind of black-sesame/buckwheaty flavored was really good and stole the show. Service was very attentive and I really enjoyed my RW lunch.

3.0,1/30/2018,"My bf and I came here yesterday during lunch for restaurant week. For our first course, he ordered the Neta roll which he found to be pretty satisfying and of good quality and value. I ordered the Tori Kurozu, crispy fried chicken atop of vegetables. While I liked the dish just fine, I found it a bit lacking. The chicken was nicely crunchy on the outside but the meat was a bit dry on the inside and have very little actual flavor. I also wished that the dish came with some rice on the side. For the second course, I ordered the bulgolgi steak donburi. It would have tasted better with some more salt but I still liked it and it paired nicely with the sushi rice. My bf also liked his umami donburi. I was really impressed with the portion sizes of the two courses as we were comfortably full at the end. The desserts were super disappointing, however, and felt really low-effort. We got a persimmon tart slice and the monaka sandwich. The monaka sandwich was basically one (small) scoop of ice cream sandwiched between what tasted like cup-shaped ice cones. The persimmon tart was slightly higher-effort but not by much.

I plan to go back during the winter restaurant week as well.Started with 5 pieces of nigiri. The fish was super fresh. I then had the umami donburi as my main course and it was the definite highlight. It's a good amount of food and each bite of it is perfect. My friend got the salmon ikura donburi, which was my second choice, but mine was definitely better. She got a major case of food envy after trying mine. We then had one of each dessert but I can't remember what they were at this point. It definitely didn't compare to the donburi! Overall, super delicious.

1.0,11/28/2017,"Came here for dinner and got the omakase for a party of 4. For $110 I expected better, should've known when OpenTable had reservation times for the entire day. They also have a super strict cancellation policy that they probably count on because people would then actually show up.The food: everything was basically salmon based, with some yuzu and soy sauce. It's very typical and after all the courses, all four of us still left hungry. All the portions were EXTREMELY small. Now I've been to other Japanese restaurants with omakase, and the portions have never been this tiny. The omakase was worth $60 at most and to charge $110 for a bunch of salmon is outrageous. The dessert was also half-assed, with a tiny tiny ball of ice cream. The food just tasted like a normal sushi restaurant you could order off of Seamless (BTW - they're on PostMates!). I have nothing against take-out restaurants, but when you're charging the prices of Michelin 2-star restaurants and offer crappy food AND have take-out available... Then it's saying something. Go to Momofuku Ko or 15 East instead, they are similar price points with Neta and serve similar kinds of Japanese omakases. The service: None of us could understand the waiter, and there was a different one each time. The waitress in the beginning also made us feel guilty that we're getting the cheapest omakase (which isn't that cheap), telling us that ""you guys should get the $150"". When we asked why and what's the difference, she responded ""It's higher quality and there's lobster"". What is that supposed to mean? So with $40 extra, we won't get food poisoning? Also, we can see that there is lobster in the more expensive one, but when we decided that we are not in the mood for lobster, we will not be ordering it. Nobody ever checked on us when we were eating.Ambience: The place looked clean, but the music was ill-fitted for this type of restaurant. It's like your typical Uber driver's top 500 Billboard playlist. It was loud and did not fit the overall vibe of the restaurant.Overall: Out of my years at NYC, I've never left a restaurant feeling like I want my money back. Usually the restaurant fits your expectations and make up for their food with service or vice versa. Neta was NOT the case -- everything was worse than mediocre. The food is not worth the price point they charge at. I had very high expectations looking at their menu, expecting it to be similar to other restaurants of their price point (e.g. Momofuku Ko, 15 East), but left feeling like they are glorified versions of the Japanese restaurants on Saint Marks. Their portions are so tiny we left straight to get pizza afterwards. Service and ambience were barely existent. Avoid.",6,2,0,Cynthia Y.,"SoHo, Manhattan, NY",296,121,12
5.0,11/21/2017,"* Came here for Restaurant Week lunch. He was only willing to come to a Restaurant week restaurant week if it were Japanese, so I delivered. This place is definitely not quite within my normal restaurant price range, so I jumped on the opportunity to come here for lunch. There were no available reservations for 2 weeks straight, for the weekend I was looking at but one day one slot happened to open up on Open Table - I don't think I've signed up for anything that quickly before. Anyways, we show up to our reservation on time, and were asked if we would be okay with sitting at the bar. I tend to actually like sitting at the bar just because you get to see your food being made, especially in an open kitchen setting so we agreed. It was interesting watching the coordinated dance the chefs had going on in the kitchen, and watching them shape and make the nigiri was mesmerizing. We got a small sake bottle to share, which was about $12 - not too bad. He got the nigiri selection, while I got the maki rolls - both came out so prettily, with plating that made me think of sugar fish in LA. The quality of fish is very good, and probably higher than a lot of the other sushi places I've been to in New York, in my recollection. For entree, he got the tuna tataki with crispy wild rice, over rice while I got the salmon with fish roe and green onions over rice. Gotta say, I'm really not a fan of fish roe and still am not to this day but the fish roe was actually alright on this bowl! I loveddd the tuna one, though. It was fresh, had an interesting combination of textures and flavors, and the fish was so well seasoned. The desserts (we got one of each) were coffee jelly or black sesame ice cream with red bean pancake, but neither of those really stood out - seemed like them just making a dessert because restaurant week lunches have desserts. Otherwise, the service was alright (kind of slow), but the food really blew me away.

Also they charge you if you cancel/no show so beware!The restaurant itself is a little cramped but very comfortable. The service was pretty good as well as the food came out quickly and the water was constantly refilled. All of us opted for the sushi appetizer, which comes with 5 pieces of nigiri - lean tuna, salmon, hamachi, mackerel, and shrimp. My favorite was the salmon, followed by the hamachi. The lean tuna was surprisingly tender.For the entree I opted for the salmon and roe don. The salmon was thinly sliced over a generous bowl of rice, and sprinkled with roe. The salmon and the roe were both delicious - super flavorful and not fishy at all. I liked the addition of scallions on top for that subtle texture and flavor. For dessert I opted for the black sesame thing with a piece of dorayaki on top. Not the biggest fan of black sesame but I still managed to eat a decent amount. The shaved ice was barely shaved really - more like clumps of ice which was hard to break up. Overall the experience was just okay - the fish was fresh, but portions were small.

My girlfriend and I are NyC residents and have tried a few similar price range establishments in the city. (Kura, Yasuda, Sushi of Gari, O Ya, Nakasawa) Our experience at Neta was quite disappointing given the benchmark set by it's competitors in this price range. We chose the $150 omakase, each had one cocktail and shared two carafes of sake. Bill came out to a little shy of $450 after tip and tax. For the price we paid, we were expecting service, atmosphere and taste to be on the same level as the places mentioned above. Let's start with the positives: Fish was fresh, cocktails were decent, and service for the most part was good. (Water topped quite frequently, staff checking in to make sure everything is going well, etc)Room for improvementBetter music selection - - Why play rap music in this setting?Kitchen appears chaotic and disorganized. Stainless steel backsplash in the kitchen appears dirty and greasy with charred marks. Since this is an open kitchen, staff should make sure the kitchen is spotless.Whenever the wait staff refilled our water, the water spill never gets cleaned up by the sushi chef so the sushi bar area wasn't kept clean and organized.The size of the fish slices that came with the sushi portion could be thicker and bigger.Decor of the restaurant appears outdated and the bathroom with the sliding door did not appear clean (the floors were wet).For the price of our meal, I was expecting more from Neta.

They have the best music selection via playlists that I've ever heard in a sushi / Japanese restaurant. I'd give them three thumbs up, if I could but alas, I only have two thumbs.The sushi roll selection for your maki roll eaters is plentiful, their sashimi is always wonderful and the chawan mushi that you get every time for an amuse, is always on point. It is just the right amount of warmth and comfort but perfect to wet your appetite but cleanse your palette at the same time.My vegetarian / non sushi eating friends also flock to Neta since they are so accommodating...Their sake list will not disappoint you...They are a solid 4.5 Yelps in my book - their mid day service has gotten a bit inconsistent with the sake glass refills and being able to flag down your server. The hostess that I normally see is always warm and welcoming - she'll jump in to help even when SHE realizes you're looking for your server.Sit at the bar, enjoy fab sushi and a great music playlist.

5.0,2/19/2017,"Neta is a gem. I have been here for lunch three times. It's not cheap, but it's worth every penny. The decor is tasteful but bare-bones simple--the emphasis here is on the food. The lunch special is quite good, especially the sake ikura don. The sashimi and sushi lunch sets are impeccable and delicious, the fish perfectly fresh. Another big plus: the seats are well-spaced, so it's possible to have a good conversation. And it's quiet at lunchtime. I will be back.",0,0,0,Tom S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",308,39,0

2.0,2/7/2017,"I am quite conflicted with the review here. There were some excellent dishes but then something happened near the end that bothered me.I was here for an early dinner so I got a less expensive omakase than normal. Was in 60s or something similar. The place had a good shochu selection which I partook in after speaking with a good waiter. I was quite far away from the guy who was preparing the dishes. They asked if I had any allergies and then they started. It started out well but then everything went down well (though it was saved by the Monaka.)Tofu: Was a very lightly battered Agedashi. Pretty normal dashi broth and good soft tofu.Scallop/Mushroom: Very good quality mushrooms and scallop. The sauce, of whatever type it was, was delicious. Very much so the highlight of the meal.Salmon Tartar/Ikura: This was excellent. The tartar's texture was slightly different than what I am used to. The Ikura was very high quality.Then pieces of sushi started coming out and the meal went from excellent to just OK. The pieces included:Gizzard Shad, Amedai, Maguro, Kampai, Fluke, Bonito, a fish that I had trouble understanding what he said (he said Ahizuke or something similar), Ikura (again,) White Tuna, and Saba to finish. The man who prepared them was mumbling whenever he brought them out. I probably wouldn't have known what several of them were if my hearing wasn't good enough/if I didn't recognize them from other places.  Outside of the Ikura which was excellent, the rest were solid but nothing amazing. The maguro was good but then again it's tuna. I was overall surprised that some of the pieces didn't have properly clumped rice and with the order. I was surprised there wasn't better tuna pieces and there wasn't eel. No tamago at the end either. The mumbling man then brought up some very good looking salmon. He then brought out some avocado which i thought was potentially for another diner who had ordered Tuna/salmon avocado. He then made two rolls, a Salmon Avocado and a Plum Shiso to finish (no tamago.) The former was a bit disheartening. The last pieces are supposed to be highlights but it was instead a salmon avocado hand roll and a plum shiso roll.The salmon was good as before, but avocado, seriously? It shows a lack of pride with the quality of the fish used. I am not allergic to avocado but I wouldn't bring it up since I don't think a place this expensive would serve such a bad ingredient. The latter was bad as well with no plum flavor due to a very overpowering shiso.The meal ended with a very good peanut butter ice cream sandwich with huckleberry jam inside a nice soft Monaka/mochi crust. No tamago/egg omelette but this was a nice change.I left after paying/giving a good tip and the guy kept on going with whatever he was preparing.I am kind of conflicted with my review here. Some of the things were excellent (if the fish was as high a quality/as good a variation as the appetizers it would be closer to a mid 4 if not higher) but finishing on my least favorite roll just bugs me. 2.4",4,3,2,Glenn C.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",208,1266,376

To my pleasant surprise, enjoyed immensely all the ordered dishes. I would order any one of them again and again.Fortunate to dine at many Japanese restaurants in the city, and, imo, Neta is one of few restaurants (along w/ Brushstroke) in NYC that does all different types of Japanese cuisine very well, from sushi to grilled fish & wagyu, tempura, karage, shabu shabu, nabe, etc. Also add the creativity coming from the kitchen, and this is one of the best Japanese restaurants in the city.Highest recommendation.: 10 calendars",4,1,2,Go B.,"Westwood, CA",57,267,10365
4.0,1/27/2017,"3.5 StarsThis review is only based off the lunch Neta offered for Restaurant Week. It was a nice, busy restaurant with a limited menu (as Restaurant Week menus tend to be.)

3.0,1/26/2017,"Average taste, good ingredients, with minimal decorations.I think Neta needs a little bit push forward on the desert and decoration. Sweets does not mean it has to be sweet. And cheaper price does not mean you should sacrifice the other parts of a good dish. Simple but outstanding is the trend, I don't think Neta is up to the challenge. We will come back visit in the future since the price is ok, but hopefully they will read this review and make this a good restaurant.",1,0,0,Anna R.,"New York, NY",0,2,5
5.0,1/26/2017,"My mom and I ate here on a quiet Wednesday night out in the city and had an absolutely fantastic experience. We asked for the two far seats at the sushi bar for a more private atmosphere to catch up (sushi bar is the way to go for small groups). We both opted for the $110 omikase menu, and our waiter recommended a nice bottle of white wine to pair with the mean (he recommended a reasonably priced bottle too which we both appreciated, as opposed to up selling another).To start, we received a number of small dishes compliments of the chef, which were lovely treats! As the meal continued each dish had its own unique flavor profiles, and it was clear the overall composures were well thought through. Once the sushi courses began things just kept getting better. Each individually prepared sushi piece was so unique and perfect, with clearly high quality ingredients prepared well. At one point one of the sushi chefs asked us to select from a few fish options, of which we picked uni (it was the uni acceptable choice, let's be real). He then served two pieces of sushi, one with a California uni and one with Japanese. And oh. My. God. If those weren't the creamiest and more decedent suckers I've ever had, idk if I wanna try whatever beats them. Mind blowingly good. THEN he serves us the Neta Roll with fresh toro! I didn't double check the $110 omikase menu, but I was pretty sure he was going off script here. And boy did we love his improv.FINALLY after we thought the meal couldn't possibly be topped. After nothing could be as good as that uni and toro. They serve us a delicate ""ice cream sandwich"" dessert consisting of a thin wafer cookie shell and this smooth and delicate banana miso ice cream. What a way to top off an incredible meal. I literally dreamt about the ice cream that night, I kid you not.Long story long Neta is a spectacular Japanese restaurant, and one of the best omikase deals you'll see in the city. I've been to other similar restaurants where they charge far more for that kind of service and variety of courses. Mind you we did have an amazing sushi chef and wait staff helping us and it was a slower Wednesday crowd, but worth a try any day of the week for anyone who hasn't been before! If nothing else, just drop in for the Japanese uni, the Neta roll, and all the banana miso ice cream they're willing to serve you. You won't be sorry.",1,0,0,Jay G.,"New York, NY",200,27,10
3.0,1/24/2017,"This review is for the Restaurant Week (Winter 2017) lunch only. (BTW, it seems they don't have regular lunch menu during Restaurant Week.)I'll start with the good things. -- The servers are friendly and accommodating. It's my birthday and I asked if they can simply write ""Happy Birthday"" along the plate of my dessert. The guy who worked in the kitchen said they'll see what they can do and later came back with a complementary chocolate lava cake with a lightening candle next to it!!! What a surprise and lovely gift!!! The owner chef Kim even said ""Happy birthday"" to me with a smiling face :) I felt I was well serviced and attended to. -- Open kitchen setup. You can see how they prepare your food while waiting. Here are the less satisfying parts.-- Services: nobody refilled our water; a bit slow when the restaurant got crowded. (I waited for more than 15 min for my dessert. But I'm not sure if it's because they need to prepare for my surprising bday cake; if it is, I can totally understand it.)-- Food: I had the Neta Sushi, Sake & Ikura Donburi, and Monaka Sandwich; my friend has the same first course and dessert but chose Sechuan Salmon Poke Bowl.     The sushi was okay, nothing out of character nor fishy. But it was not impressive, either, and, I'm sure the fish was fresh, but not outstandingly fresh that you know it's already passed the best time.     The donburi was good as expected, but again, there was no wow-factor at all. Average quality with a tiny portion. Just 7 or 8 pieces of salmon sit on a bed of sushi rice, decorated with a few drops of salmon roe, although I did like the garlic soy.    My friend's salmon poke bowl was way too salty. I just had a small bite and felt salty to hell. Whoever made this poke bowl put too much soy when mixing, and the fish's original taste was overshadowed by the strong saltness. My friend drank up her water halfway through the bowl, but poor girl, nobody came to refill her water.    The monaka ice cream sandwich was the best in my opinion. Their house-made ice cream was really delicious! I believe it's peanut butter but also had some miso taste (or maybe a mix of vanilla or milk with peanut butter and miso) and it was very rich, creamy, and milky. It was even better when you mixed it with the huckleberry jam, which has a hint of sourness. Great combination!    I also enjoyed their chocolate lava cake, not because it turned out to be my bday cake, but it was really rich, intense, and the melted chocolate sauce inside had a taste from yuzu citrus. That fresh sourness balanced off some richness from the strong chocolate flavor.Overall, I think we might have chosen the wrong dishes. Looking at them in the kitchen, I thought I should have ordered the Oyako Don, which looked much more volume, or the Kobe Bulgogi Crispy Rice, which was more creative and alluring.",2,1,0,Jingqiao H.,"Lower East Side, Manhattan, NY",175,184,3014
5.0,1/23/2017,"This may just be the best sushi lunch deal in New York City. $34 gets you a little chawanmushi and gigantic bowl of salmon and ikura over rice to start (or a fried chicken / tonkotsu dish - but stick with the salmon/ikura - it is by far the best) in addition to five pieces of sushi (king salmon, lean tuna, Spanish mackerel, hamachi, and orata when I went) and a roll (some kind of whitefish) with a delicious ice cream sandwich to end (miso banana - tastes much much better than it sounds).Quality of the fish was superb and the quality of the rice was fantastic - perfectly chewy with just the right amount of seasoning to compliment the fish.

While eating at 5:30 might be a little bit uncomfortable, paying $75 for that quality of meal in New York is a steal.The chef was incredibly accommodating. First, although the standard rule is that everybody at the table has to do omakase, they were willing to make an exception for my younger brother (who is an exceptionally picky eater). Additionally, my family does not eat shellfish, and he was willing to tailor the omakase to our tastes.The small dishes to start the meal were all flavorful, and the chef selected a wide range of sushi.

Each dish is great but my favorites were:- Lobster broth with toast: Chef Sung's experimental dish - super  flavorful!- Uni Porridge with truffles - to die for! - Abalone with truffles - Chawan Mushi - Waygu/Uni sushi (ordered an extra piece)They also make their own ice cream and the flavors are unusual but incredible!!I wish I can eat dinner here every night.,1,0,1,Winnie W.,"New York, NY",0,5,3

1.0,10/3/2016,"Absolutely the worst experience I had so far.  We ordered the $150 omakase and waited more than an hour just to reach the first 3 courses.  Without mentioning that we spent most of our time watching a big group of chef occupied intensively and jumped all round almost as a display of what you would see in a kitchen, and indeed as I was sitting in the bar, I could see them preparing steaks. The smell of cooking oil mist was so strong that it totally massed me up.  In the end, I gave up because I lost my appetite.   I told the waiter that we will stop from there; he immediately understood but had no actual reaction to my request until another lady (seemingly the manager) learnt my request again.  She helped me stop my course, apologized, and waived the price for first 5 course we had.  Overall, I highly suggest the restaurant to improve on its service and cooperation among staffs because it seemed to me that the service was very inefficient.  The price set was too high and it is definitely incomparable to other same price set sushi place that I had been so far.",0,1,0,Min L.,"Brookline, MA",41,10,37

Pink champagne on the house, a nice touchThen the food. Oh man, the food. Off the chart. We've eaten here a few times, and every time they manage to step it up. We did the Omasake. The middle priced one. I'm almost certain that they served the most expensive one anyway. Caviar, wagyu, uni, lobster, every kind of wonderful. Couldn't even count how many dishes. Probably 10 to 15. Honestly some of the best food I've had ever.  Not just the best Japanese food. If I were to be ranking Neta's food against other Japanese food, I'd say it's better than pretty mush all other Japanese I've had. That includes food in Tokyo, Hokkaido, Kyoto. Better too than NYC's Nobu, sushi Nakazawa. This isn't a traditional Omakase,  so it's hard to compare,  it this is up there experience-wise with Sukiyabashi Jiro (look that up if you haven't heard of it), and he has 3 Michelin stars.

The food was serviceable, not bad but not good enough to justify the price.  However the final insult was NO UNI.  When the staff started to remove our chopsticks and dishes, we reminded them that we have not had uni yet.  Then a wait person came and said the uni was served with the Kobe beef.  I showed her the photo of the beef.  NO UNI.  And none of us (there were five of us) tasted any uni.  At this point, the two to three wait staff at our table retreated to the employee area behind the sushi bar and then disappeared altogether.  My husband did not want me to complain further because we were there to celebrate.  We will definitely not going back.",0,1,0,Lai L.,"New York, NY",0,2,0

The four bites I was served were superb, despite being served tempura-style with the shell on. I also ordered an unagi roll. While the eel was clearly very fresh, I was again underwhelmed by the tiny portion of 5 pcs. for $20. I enlisted  the help of the server in my decision on round two. He said tempura (can't recall the actual  name) chicken over foie gras. This is where things took a turn for the worse. The dish was merely $20 chicken nuggets served with a bland aioli for dipping, a major disappointment. I finished with the house-made ice cream, which was to die for.

However, the prices are really not justified for the quality of the food or the experience. The business includes gratuity in their pricing, which is fine. But just a glass of wine is $20, which is a lot, even with 20% tip included. My friend ordered one piece of sashimi that was $17, for a bite of fish. Our appetizers (we had three small plates) and rolls were good, but not too memorable. We left still feeling hungry, which is what I see other reviewers saying. I probably won't go back.

Thank you for not being stuffy with spa music playing in the background. Sit at the sushi counter if you can, fun to watch the chefs and bartenders do their thing. Food: I've done both the omakase and a la carte and you can't go wrong with either. Omakase- sit back, relax and let the chef take you through Japan with perhaps a Korean detour (noticed a few influences from there).  A la carte? Create your own adventure! - portion sizes are goldilocks- not too big, not too small. A few dishes with more high end ingredients ( i.e. Kobe katsuo with Kobe beef and uni) are on the smaller side but one or two bites are enough to satisfy. Service: intelligent without being pretentious. Accommodating without being overbearing.

I should have made reservation for another restaurant for my main course. Had 3 appetizers (small plates), 2 roll and 2 sushi. Agedashi tofu/ duck and foie/ sea urchin porridge. The portion is more like amuse bouche. The roll and sushi came out- not enough to fill my cavity. I can't get over the portion. 150 dollars worth of food and I'm exasperated to be still starving. Food is good, nothing really memorable. Starvation and the sensation of feeling ripped off take over the entire experience.

3.0,12/18/2015,I got the $150 omakase here along with various cocktails. First thing I have to say is that the coktails were very cool and unqiue and I'd reccomend trying them but wouldnt reccomend going out of your way to come for them.Food wise the sushi was good tasty and fresh with one or two stand out dishes but here is the issues I literally cant remember what they were as while everything was good nothing really stood out and it wasnt so fantastic to be honest. Now normally I wouldnt be so picky but keep in mind $150 is the price you could pay as sushi Nakazawa and I feel as though the food while good really doesnt match the price at all. New York is full of sushi places and due to trendiness alot of people don't really know the value of it.

We ordered the 10 courses Lunch Omakase. Each dish was expertly prepared, perfectly cooked, appealingly presented and simply delicious. Each dish had its own twist, I especially enjoyed the Montauk Pearl oyster with nigori sake foam & mignonette - the favor was fantastic. The cooked abalone, hearts of palm, hakurei turnip with black garlic pudding - the taste and texture were absolutely amazing. After we finished our dessert - black sesame ice cream with rice wafer, Chef Sung approached and asked about our dining experience - what a great way to end the meal.

4.0,11/2/2015,"Neta is a delicious Japanese restaurant from a high established pedigree, serving up quality sushi, good drinks, and thoroughly crafted small plates. Last week was my first visit to Neta, and we ended up getting the medium-priced omakase. From what I've read the place has definitely changed a few things that other people found superfluous or disappointing. The main dishes were all spectacular. There were a few that I could have done without, like their experimental dish which was fluke on top of julienned apples. The standout was definitely the tartar with caviar dish - which was a texturally perfect, healthy portioned plate that kept me coming back for more bites. Thought it would be overly critical to say that the nigiri portion of the meal was disappointing, but it was definitely below expectations. The best way to put it would be to say that it was traditional. There were no exotic or different variations of fish that you might find at some of the other comparable Japanese restaurants. You have your salmon, toro, scallop, etc., but nothing that stands out from different omakases. The dessert was surprisingly very good - a Japanese style ice cream sandwich that was a great way to end the dinner. Though I was curious about the grapefruit granita, our dessert did not disappoint. Overall, I would recommend Neta as a one-time visit - same as their affiliated restaurant Shuko.

You either sit at the ""communal table"" / sushi bar or at small tables by the wall. Nothing fancy. The service is not great given the price.

2.0,8/24/2015,"This review is about omekase and a la carte sushi. I'm sorry but it seems to this longstanding sushi appreciator that most of the ""top"" NYC restaurants such as Neta just charge outrageous prices for microscopic portions.  Yes, the quality can be high (although is not always), but it should not be necessary to pay these prices, and they are all ripping us off.  Even in Tokyo, these prices and small portions would be embarrassing for any self-respecting sushi chef, perhaps with the exception of Jiro (but many Tokyo natives think his sushi is way too expensive). In California, or even New Jersey, there is better, bigger sushi to be had and at much lower prices. Neta (who also served us basically chu-toro but called it otoro and priced it accordingly), 15 East (whose portions may be the most microscopic), Nakazawa (whose uni was salty and not fresh, and whose marketing is far better than its sushi), even Blue Ribbon Izikaya (who served us Spanish marinated chu-toro, when we asked for fresh, that was $17.50 PER PIECE, without warning) etc, all suffer from this ridiculousness and it's time for New Yorkers to put their collective foot down.

3.0,8/22/2015,"The food was very good here but I wanted to point out one thing so other diners can be aware.  We were a table of 5 and when we sat down the waiter asked if we wanted still or sparkling water, we said both.  The waiters poured our water and basically never stopped, kept refilling glasses before we were even half way through and kept interrupting to ask if we wanted more water.  At the end of the meal when the bill came, we were faced with $60 worth of water charges.  Since our table was not drinking much alcohol it was clear the waiters were being really pushy with the water.  It wasn't until almost the end of the meal that they suddenly said do you want tap water now?  I understand that we should have paid more attention to what water was flowing but we were enjoying our dinner companions and I feel that the wait staff truly took advantage of us not paying attention.  I realize when I got the bill that they had not asked the typical restaurant question of would you like tap water.  Had they asked we would have said yes to that.  Many restaurants make their own sparkling water these days and so we wrongly assumed that was what were were getting.   i really didn't like to be played like that and I really wouldn't recommend Neta for that reason.  After I complained they split the water bill with me, but  by the reaction of the manager when I complained it was clear that this is complaint had come up before.",0,1,1,Sara W.,"New York, NY",0,1,0

5.0,8/5/2015,"I have had great omakase at some of the highest rated places in the US, but my dinner at Neta beat them all. This is not old-school, traditional omakase - which I really love - but Neta expands on the the classic Japanese style to create something even better. Anyone who has had great sushi or omakase knows when a piece of nigiri seems to explode with flavor. At Neta, nearly every bite does that. And it's done in a creative, fusion style that, to my mind, expands what sushi can be through creativity and risk taking. Don't let the laid-back atmosphere fool you (they played cheesy '80s rock when I was there), the Neta people really know what they are doing and don't hide behind formal sushi conventions. Check it out with an open mind, and I think you'll have an amazing experience. BTW - I promise I am not paid for this, and I don't work there.

The soy sauce was doled out in small saucers (maybe enough for a roll or two) and refilling them required a call to the waiter which seemed like and unnecessary extra step.

5.0,7/3/2015,"Neta is a small restaurant in Greenwich offering omakase (Japanese tasting menu) and an open kitchen and sushi bar.  We saw the ROTD from NY and amazing pictures and just had to try it ourselves.  At first I was a bit nervous - I saw a ""B"" Sanitary rating out front.  The restaurant seemed clean to me.  A downside is that they have just one tiny restroom stall for the entire restaurant.The restaurant was also empty at 6pm, but later got busier around 7:30pm.Service and food overall I'd give 4.5 stars, but I'll round up to 5.  Flawless food preparations, though areas of improvement would be to broaden their dessert menu.  We went after the Omakase C ($225/pp), and it was great that they made a number of substitutions for the wife since she's not a huge raw fish person.Omakase C started with 8 cooked items, followed by 3 rounds of sushi (about 12 total pieces of nigiri and maki total) and then a final dessert.Dish 1: A cold, creamy corn soup that was smooth and had some nice colors from the various ingredients.Dish 2: Tuna tartare + black caviar on Japanese toast, with edible gold flakes.  Amazingly good - probably one of our favorites.Dish 3: Abalone(!) with some sauce made from liver (from the abalone I think). Tender and decadent.Dish 4: Colorado panko-crusted Wagyu beef topped with Hokkaido uni with a squid-ink rice cracker.  Some seriously good meat here, with rich and savory flavors.Dish 5: Smoked duck with bonito with smoky consomme.Dish 6: Halibut consomme - fish was seasoned and cooked perfectly.  Broth had umami for sure.Dish 7: Lobster karaage with Gouchujang butter - wow a very nice preparation.Dish 8:  Finally we have the A5 Wagyu with shishito pepper and maitake mushroom. Melt-in-your-mouth buttery beef.  Nice peppery, earthy flavors.  The next three rounds were sushi dishes - my favorites were the toro and uni of course.  They prepared more rolls for the wife along with some cooked bluefin, snapper, and salmon and tuna tartare since she's not a big fan of nigiri.  The sushi was perfect - soft, fall-apart seasoned rice and fresh toppings, with the small bit of wasabi slipped in between.Dessert was a minor letdown.  The peanut butter ice cream sandwich was awesome.  Only, we were hoping to see some more variety to see how good and creative Neta's pastry chefs are.

Upon checking in i was immediately notified that I'd missed my confirmation phone call early that day (why I needed one on such short notice a reservation...) and seated only after an elderly gentleman, despite arriving first. The host seemed annoyed I was on my phone trying to contact my mom, and by the time he felt he had my undivided attention, promptly sat me next to the bathroom. It's worth noting the music was continuously bad, to the point of ironic, stadium rock & roll. When we ordered the waiter didn't ask me if I wanted sushi or sashimi when I picked our fish - huge faux pas for anyone who knows what they're doing. The cherry on top on this sweltering day was the manager coming over to deliver our check. When my mother remarked that it felt hot inside, instead of apologizing he said ""the AC is on 64"" which was wishful thinking. I try to eat beyond my means as often as I can, despite being younger than the average fine dining customer, but it was pretty equal treatment for myself and my mom.Food was good but not worth the trouble.

My friend advised me that Neta was an amazing sushi spot to go for Omakase and so after my 4-day juice cleanse was over, I ventured on over to Neta.I walked in and saw all white people! WHAT? I looked at my friend and asked if he was sure that it was that good! Not just white people...white people eating rolls. Rolls?! WTF. Likely they were freakin' California rolls! I was definitely not confident that it would be a great meal. I'm white and listen, there's nothing wrong with white people eating at awesome sushi spots but I was just taken aback as usually when I go to ""authentic"" sushi spots, there are not many white people at all (like 1-2 max).I was also surprised to see a mixologist behind the sushi counter in this small little bar area. He made me a great cocktail with soju vodka, yuzu juice, peychaud bitters, and simple syrup. It was quite strong and different but very tasty. We ordered the omakase (chefs choice) that had 8-ish prepared/cooked dishes to start (can't remember), followed by 10-ish courses of omakase sushi. I forgot the exact numbers but whatever, you get the point.Are you ready to start this magical journey with me?Prepared dishes:+ Leek soup - This was like straight out of a 3-Michelin starred restaurant. It was so well presented that I felt terrible actually eating it. Honestly (see attached photos) it was ridiculously good.+ Toro Tartare with caviar + White asparagus salad with miso tofu, scallion purée, quinoa, and pickled radish+ Miso glazed seabass+ Raw fish kara age+ Wok fried lobster with miso and lotus root********+ Wagyu beef with king mushrooms - I swear I almost damn near fell off my chair when I ate this. BEST PIECE OF MEAT I HAVE EVER CONSUMED IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. Do I need to repeat this? Make bold letters and stars when you are taking notes about this. Legit, the best. It melted in my mouth.*******+ Mochi rice (risotto) with uni and truffles - Is this for real?! Seriously. Come on guys, you can stop trying now. The sushi pieces were quite heavenly as well. Very fresh and VERY good.We ended with the peanut butter ice-cream (THEY MUST HAVE KNOWN THAT I AM OBSESSED WITH ALL THINGS HAVING TO DO WITH PEANUT BUTTER) and I can definitely say that I was in heaven. For a good 2 hours, I was sitting in heaven.Neta definitely ranks within the top 2 sushi restaurants in NYC in my book and I have been to pretty much all of the top sushi restaurants in the city.  YOU MUST GO and also make sure that you sit at the counter and get the omakase. Trust me, it's worth every penny!",30,16,19,Melanie A.,"Manhattan, NY",1284,565,388

We got seated at 8, and by the time it was 9:15P, we had only four appetizers served. In total we spent ten minutes eating, and more than an HOUR waiting.

4.0,4/12/2015,"A and I dined at Neta last night to celebrate his birthday. Overall, a solid meal. I love the decor and set up. If possible, I highly recommend sitting at the sushi bar; it's really cool to be able to see the chefs in action and see your food being prepped and plated right in front of you. They also played 80s music all night - which A loves! We arrived promptly at 8 for our reservation and after checking my coat, we were seated at the bar. Right in front of us was Chef Shim doing his thing, expediting and all of that. Hello, chef! (I think I get more excited seeing chefs than I do seeing celebrities.) We each ordered a cocktail to start; I had the Goma's Pilgrimage and he the Umi Ume (yum!). I love how descriptive their cocktail menu is, not just what ingredients are in the drink but the adjectives and explanations... It's like reading a story. We had several cocktails throughout the night and they were all well made. Their dinner menu consists of a la carte choices and three omakase options. We decided to opt for their highest priced omakase. (YOLO?) The meal started with a chilled baked potato soup with cod and broccolini (and a bunch of other things, but he was not understandable). Absolutely beautiful presentation and so flavorful! It was reminiscent of cream soup that my mom used to make when I was a kid... x100! (Sorry, mom.) Thinking back of the meal, this was my favorite dish of the night. Next course was the tuna belly tartare with caviar and gold. It's served with two small pieces of toast. This was good; fresh. The station for this dish and the soup was right in front of us. It was fun to see them breaking out the scale to weigh the caviar and place the gold on top with tweezers. Next course was the white asparagus, red onion, radish on quinoa with delicious, we-couldn't-understand-what-he-was-saying sauce. Next Monkfish Karage (yum); then halibut with morel, peas and truffle cream. My second favorite dish of the night: wok seared shrimp and lobster with lotus root tempura. We were told to eat the shrimp shell on, but not the lobster (haha!). Then came the grilled steak with shiitake mushroom. A loved this... I found it to be extremely fatty; I think it had more fat than meat, tbh. I had two small bites and gave him the rest, which he happily devoured. To each his own. The sauce was good as was the mushrooms. Our last dish from the kitchen was the uni porridge with truffle, mochi rice and mitsuba. While it was good, I would pass on this next time. The sushi course came next. I like how each patron gets a wet tissue to wipe their fingers as sushi is supposed to be eaten with your hands; though I don't participate in this process and hence didn't need it. I've gotta say, this was the fastest sushi course I've ever had in my entire life. As soon as we would eat the piece, another appeared. And another and another. Not sure if we were being rushed out or if he's just trained to have a piece ready made as soon as the previous one is consumed, but it was nearly comical. Or magical. Depending on how you choose to look at it. He was very nice though and didn't seem to mind when we had to ask him to repeat what the piece was - it was pretty loud in here at this point - (unlike the other man, who almost seemed angry about it). We were given the following: King Salmon, Kampachi, Saba, Toro, Red Snapper, white shrimp, fluke, Hokkaido uni, seared toro, toro roll, cucumber and shiso roll and tamago. At this point, we were happily stuffed to the brim. We were given a piping hot cup of green tea. And then came dessert; a single scoop of vanilla and miso ice cream. So good! I had noted in Open Table that we were there to celebrate A's birthday and we were presented with a dessert with a candle on it. I thought it was very sweet that they did that and he was pleasantly surprised. It was a green tea panna cotta? I'm not sure - I think at this point, I was in a blissful food coma. ^^",3,3,3,Kate Y.,"Queens, NY",217,197,689

5.0,3/29/2015,"This place is Absolutely Amazing. Where to start. First this place is not cheat the top tasting menu is $255/person and its worth every penny.   The saki paring with it, is a must.   The dishes were just amazing. I can't even tell you how good the tuna with 24-L gold fakes were, the Blow fish, and the Wagu beef.  It was dish after dish the portions are small so its just enough to savor the flavors and richness of the dishes.  I can't believe this place that looks like a hole in the wall is so good. You will walk by it a ton of times and never notice it exists. Also def recommend reservations because this place is tiny and you will not get a table if you walk in.  Everyone here is in synch. The staff is very accomadating and the bar tender/ saki expert is amazing. Some of their signature drinks are def a must try. He will recommend many options based on your likes.   The only thing that was sort of whatever was the dessert. I'm not a fan of peanut icecream.   but we came for sushi and that was a SHOW STOPPER!

5.0,3/18/2015,"Being opened by two long time disciples of chef Masa, one cannot give low or even mediocre expectation on a sushi bar like Neta. So without hesitation, we went straight to Omakase, which represents the best can be brought.Delicate as other bars, Neta also focused on the mixture flavor of food. Salad is usually the most boring part of dinner, yet I deeply enjoyed their salad with grilled eel. Not to mention their other small plates, especially the grilled uni served on a shell and salmon roe rice.Not as plain as it indicated outside the room, Neta is really someplace you should try out, just to experience a bit of Masa spirit.",9,1,4,Elaine H.,"San Francisco, CA",1221,1748,5633

5.0,3/9/2015,"I'm still dreaming about the meal I had here. A good friend from out of town was craving good sushi, this has been on my list for a long while, and hell, sometimes you just want to splurge.And just be warned, if you splurge, it is costly. We'd each ordered the the mid-level omakase and two drinks, and our total per person after tip was $233. But it was worth every penny.We'd made a last-minute but early reservation (6:15pm) on a Sunday night, with no specific preferences of where to sit. The hostess was friendly and sat us at the bar, giving us a nice view of all the action. The bartender knew his stuff, whether it was the sake or the cocktails, and every recommendation he made suited our tastes perfectly. The waiter was attentive and came in at just the right moments to avoid interrupting our conversation, and the only issue we had was just getting his attention so we could get our check. But by that time the restaurant had filled up, and clearly we weren't being rushed out.And when the food came, it was well timed, beautifully presented, and of course, delicious. We started off with some kitchen items, including a grilled scallop, an amazingly refreshing crab salad, a buttery toro tartar with caviar, and a nostalgic ginger fried softshell prawn and lobster done in the best Cantonese style. Then we hit the sushi, where the itamae would wait patiently for us to finish eating the nigiri (with rice packed just loosely so it would come apart in your mouth) before slipping another piece in front of us, one after the other until we hit the rolls: two pieces each of three different kinds. If anything, by that point I was stuffed and the rolls began to go down with much more difficulty than everything before that, but my friend had no issue with any of it.To round it all off, a tiny scoop of peanut butter ice cream served as a deliciously smooth palate cleanser. We rolled out of there about two hours after we came in, stuffed to contention.",5,0,4,Jessica L.,"Queens, NY",61,17,0

It was ""reserved"" and would be full soon. she was a pretentious snob and we questioned whether or not they would seriously fill all of these seats at such an early hour--when we left there were still 10 open seats that had never been sat. Thanks hostess, great planning. Miniscule glasses of wine, so we just ordered a bottle. We ordered a few of their small plates. Waiter KEPT coming over asking us if we wanted to put in more food---although all of these plates had not even arrived yet, while we preferred to take our time.

I actually considered walking out after the first few course because the dishes were so unbalanced. The Toro and Caviar sounds interesting but in realty its simply a waste of two fine ingredients. (all you could taste was a very salty caviar).  The Sea Bream with shaved truffle and truffle sauce had a overpowering truffle oil taste... BTW they use ""French Truffles"" which are not even in the same league as Italian ones. The French truffles reminded me of eating wood shavings.  The Uni Porridge tasted like scallions with a dash of Uni and topped with those wood shavings.....*** The best dish was an outstanding Wagyu Steak...the fat count was so high it melted in your mouth like butter. The sushi and rolls were predictably good but not outstanding. The service was adequate.

4.0,11/20/2014,"Of course, I made reservations for 2 for the sushi bar area since we were planning no ordering Omakase. I was a bit skeptical at 1st because I read that a Korean guy is the executive chef here. I mean don't get me wrong, I am Korean, so I am happy that another Korean is running a restaurant, but how can he handle sushi, a Japanese staple? I was worried over nothing. The place was crowded and the kitchen was open and operating like a well oiled machine. There are 3 sets of Omakase, each differing on the # of courses served to you. I ordered the middle option while sharing a 300ml bottle of sake. The dishes were good. I forget all of them at the top of my head. I do remember a crab salad that was yummy and briney. I also remember the toro tartare and caviar, which reminded me of a dish served at Morimotos. A spicy lobster app (the lobster still had the shell even though it was deep fried). Eventually the nigiri sushi course began and it was a decent amount of food. My fave dish was the grilled toro. OMG it was magnificent!!!! I was disappointed they didn't serve Uni, so we ordered that after the course was over. Overall, the experience was pretty good. I loved the show that the chefs were providing while cooking/prepping. My only gripe was that up until the sushi course, the dishes came out rather quickly. Overall, a decent place...if you can find it.

Friends of mine suggested Neta for dinner, since they live around the corner. I happily agreed because, well, I love sushi. Little did I know, this was going to be some incredible, life changing sushi. Our little party of three was seated in he front window and offered drinks. I had the pinot noir by the glass, which is not on the online menu (super diappointing, I would have bought it by the bottle!) and it was an incredible red. Perfect, in fact. Not heavy, but not watered down, either, with strong flavors and also somehow light? I don't know how to describe wine. Clearly. One in our party, who had originally suggested the restaurant, had been there before and told us about what was good, what he had tried, what we should order. We decided to let him choose, I trust the guy. GREAT decision. You guys. I'm totally freaking out right now. We started with the Dungeness Crab Salad (cucumber, wild parsley, dashi vinaigrette). It was light, airy and delicious. Perfect bit of crunch from the veggies, and the crab was fresh. In fact, it was the best tasting crab. Of my life. For realsies. We then shared the Hirame and Cucumber (cucumber, serrano, cilantro) which was also OHMIGODSOMOUTHWATERING. We tried a tuna dish that isn't published online (boo!) but again, amaze. Perfect tuna, perfect little bites, so much flavor. DYING. The best one came last (we were still on appetizers - I'm so serious) which was the Duck & Foie (foie gras, crispy skin, grilled scallion, cucumber cup). Please, someone bring me another. Absolutely delightful. The cucumber is such an interesting pairing with the fatty meats. And grilling your scallions? Smart. Let's all agree this was amazing and I should have been served more. As an entree I orderd the Spicy Tuna Roll which was small dainty bites, with a hint of spice that perked you right up in your seat. Again, melt in your mouth tuna. I also had the Spicy Salmon Canape Roll, which I am totes ordering again. Salmon melted in your mouth (but you knew that already) and had the ""canape"" on top? I don't know. Just go order it. Well balanced, small, ladylike bites and plenty of food. I was so full at the end. The very professional, attentive and unintrusive waitstaff never felt like they were at your table, but somehow everything was cleaned up and my water was always full. Nice. Once the main course is cleared, they bring you green tea. I don't like green tea, so I was hesitant to try it. But, being the polite, girl that I am and also a product of growing up with the rule you have to try everything once, I tasted it. Sweet Mother. It was so good. No fooling. I was shocked.

On top of that, the restaurant was so smokey we could barely breathe.Minus one star for the service and atmosphere.  Minus one for the price.",8,0,0,Stan P.,"Manhattan, NY",1,182,1

5.0,3/27/2014,"One of the best Japanese cuisine in US, small place, we arrived late and it's sort of hard to find, the neighbor doesn't seem to be totally safe, but we called and got in. Small cozy place with open kitchen so you can enjoy your food while watching chefs preparing for those amazing, exquisite little dishes and of course, sushi. Unlike most Japanese restaurant has sashimi and sushi menu, this place presents you creative small plate(which is really small as for you to taste, not for killing hunger) and sushi. the 3 small plates we ordered are pretty tasty however what captures our heart is the sushi. Spicy Salmon, Tuna Avocado, Shrimp tempura, Crab. Oh My God. That was the best 1 hour I've spent on the food like, ever. I've been to an amazing sashimi place in Chicago but when the seafood comes into your mouths with soft and warm rice combined with either creamy avocado or fresh cucumbers, that is what I call ""perfection"". Unlike the surprise from the texture of different sorts of sashimi, the surprise  coming from the sushi of Neta is the incredible taste that makes you feel like home, sitting around the table tasting mother's onigiri",1,0,1,Han C.,"Champaign, IL",4,5,0
4.0,3/24/2014,"Neta's a nice little joint that's actually not too far from the hustle and bustle that is 6th Avenue below 14th Street, but you wouldn't notice it once you step inside. It's a got a very simplistic, modern aesthetic quality inside, with the center of attention being the chef's area, where the sushi gets prepped and all the other magic happens. The sushi bar table actually winds around beyond the end of the bar and loops back, letting you sit on the same side of the bar (but separated, of course) from the kitchen. If you're here with a group, don't despair - there are tables, so you don't have to talk down the row. Service was very solid, especially our waiter - he was great on discussing the menu items and drink selections, and he scored us an extra scoop of ice cream at the end (part of a mostly stellar menu, as I'll discuss next).I'm going to start with the second half of the meal, which was the sushi portion - mainly because I was slightly disappointed by it. It wasn't completely clear how much sushi came in each omakase. So for the record: the $145 course (the middle-priced option) only comes with 8 pieces of sushi and 6 bites from a roll, which is disappointingly small. I very much appreciated the other dishes that Neta served (arguably because they were more interesting and appealing in terms of flavors and variety), but that's pretty small IMO. The sushi was prepared in a style not too unlike Gari, where some of the pieces were torched, dashed with a bit of tofu and embellished with a bit of daikon. The quality of the fish was definitely fresh, and there were some pieces (such as toro, as always) that were delicious, but certain pieces (like the Spanish mackerel) were unremarkable compared to what I've had elsewhere. I was also disappointed by the lack of sushi staples - no uni, no ikura, no anago...if you are doing a small selection of sushi, these were noticeable in how starkly they were absent. The rolls were also a puzzling selection. They were all very good (particularly the negitoro), but both the sweet potato and soft shell fried crab roll were a bit too 'American' for me, and towards the end of the meal, it was a bit on the heavier side.Although the sushi was definitely the more disappointing part of the meal, both the small plates and dessert was excellently done. It's hard to come up with a more decadent mixture of seafood than a toro tartare topped with a heaping amount of caviar (maybe add uni?), but it's a dish where each bite is light in mass and heavy in the succulent decadence department. The first appetizer - crab meat with chilled cucumbers - was a very clean way to start off the meal before the toro. The scallops and uni were delicious, with a bit of a Mexican influence in the sauce and the cilantro sprinkled in - but the uni got a bit lost in the menagerie of flavors. The lobster tail was juicy and tender, and the spiced sauce (definitely seemed like a nod to Szechuan cuisine) gave it a nice kick. One of the more unique - and one of my favorites for the evening - had to be the crispy rice, which was served on the still-burning skillet and topped with chilled spicy salmon. I'm not a fan of the spicy mayo-infused versions of fish, but the coolness really helped to offset the hot crunchiness of the bottom of the rice. As for dessert - homemade ice cream is a must-try; the peanut butter ice cream was so well-done - basically like eating peanut butter, but with dairy undertones and the creamy texture of ice cream - that I'd have had full pint if they had one handy. We also got to sample the miso-banana ice cream; while a bit more on the savory side, the miso flavor does well as a complement to the more basic flavor of the banana, which has less natural sweetness than other fruits.Neta is nice for being a bit more laid-back than most of your other top-notch Japanese restaurants, and it's a very nice place to enjoy an upscale yet casual dinner. The cocktail menu is impressive (if a little pricey); the same goes for the beer list, which is mostly filled with interesting (read: not just Kirin or Sapporo) Japanese imports and other beers from around the world. That said - just because it's run by former Masa acolytes doesn't mean you're going to get world-class sushi here. If anything, I definitely felt like it has a bit of a Western-friendlier approach to the fish. I'd come back, but I'd probably go a la carte next time.",5,1,4,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",371,1653,169

The rating is rather based on the restaurant as a whole.  My brother and I went to eat there last night based on a friend's recommendation.  When we sat down, we realized that it was not the type of place where we wanted to dine.  It was more of a ""date type"" restaurant and we were looking for more of a casual place.  We explained to the waiter, who had already poured our water.  As we got up to leave the manager (at least I assume she was the manager because she was not our waitress) brought us a bill for TEN DOLLARS for the WATER.  Yes, you read this correctly.  They charged us TEN DOLLARS for water...not bottled water, tap water.  We did not eat anything and we only sat down for maybe 5 minutes.  I will NEVER eat at this place based on sheer principle.  Any place that is going to charge me for water does not need my business.",1,0,0,Kasey B.,"Metairie, LA",0,9,0

4.0,1/27/2014,"Extreme Sushi Enthusiasm seems to be somewhat of a prerequisite for NYC dwelling, but somehow I have lived in Manhattan for nearly five years without being seduced by the lure of raw undersea creatures.  Regardless, I just keep trying.  I really WANT to like sushi/sashimi/nigiri/maki/etc. - how else am I going to get to hang with the cool kids? -   and excellent sushi restaurants like Neta are where I have come closest to seeing the fishy light.It is a small space with a relatively large open kitchen.  I actually like this setup in sushi restaurants, since sushi chefs tend to make their food preparation and presentation into somewhat of a performance art.The service was EXCELLENT.  Okay, well, in the interest of full disclosure, my dining partner had been to Neta about 4 times before, and he'd already developed an obvious rapport with the staff (he also tends to be quite...uninhibited...in his spending, which I'm sure never hurts).  But regardless, most high-end restaurants in NYC don't have close to the level of hospitality that I experienced at Neta - the staff remembered my friend from the moment he walked in the door, they recalled which dishes he liked the most, and they even brought us a complimentary glass of champagne upon our arrival as an apology because apparently they'd had to unexpectedly cancel his most recent reservation at the last minute.  I'm going to refrain from going into detail on the food (although that may be quite an unusual choice for a restaurant review) just because I don't feel like I'm enough of a sushi connoisseur for my feedback to be worth very much.  However, I will say that if you're NOT open to eating the raw stuff, this isn't the type of Japanese/sushi restaurant that offers many other alternatives (not that they have any obligation to do so, because they obviously cater to the more sophisticated sushi lovers, and do an excellent job of it).",2,2,1,Meredith R.,"New York, NY",378,86,3

4.0,1/16/2014,"I was drawn to this place because notably, the owners were former chefs of Masa so they must know good sushi...rt?! Secondly, it is a hidden gem in W. Village, I must've walked by it twice before I realized I was ""there"".  I was extremely impressed that though the uni risotto was now off the menu, and they were not offering it this season, our waiter consulted with the chef and they were able to make it for me though I didn't order the Omakase tasting menu. That, in itself, is true and great restaurant service. Interior/Décor: ****Bare, minimalist, natural interior. Small spaces, with a few benches and tables on the outer walls, and several long sushi bar-style tables in the interior. A very large, open kitchen remains Neta's focal point while dining. The acoustics were a little hard to get used to, yet the restaurant still gives an intimate vibe.Service/Friendliness: *****You will have your very own personal butler. I say that because they ""hover"" right by your table and make sure your every needs are met. Great feel for Michelin star-type service, but creepy for having a private conversation. Critique of Food: *****Uni Risotto: Heaven.in.a.bowl. Creamy risotto, topped with slivers of uni (sea urchin)-- creamy, delicate, buttery, savory, salty/sweet. Just heaven. Egg custard bowl: Another delicious bowl of heaven. Steamed egg with a savory uni-flavored broth. Spicy Salmon with bonito flakes & crispy rice: Another fave! Great piece of salmon made ""dynamite"" style, a bit spicy (siracha, tastes like) with shaved bonito flakes. Though the culinary technique didn't quite impress for this place, the taste is definitely worth trying this dish out.Yellowtail,  Spanish Mackerel, Salmon Sushi- You will pay a pretty hefty price for just one piece of sushi/sashimi.

We started with a dungeness crab salad that was the perfect mix of sweet, salty, and refreshing. The tuna toro with caviar was melt in your mouth. There was a scallop and uni dish that I wanted never to end. The sushi was all perfectly cut and were little bites of heavenly deliciousness.  We ended with their home made peanut butter ice cream and I think hands down, it was the best ice cream I've ever tasted in my life (and we've had a LOT of ice cream, especially Italian gelato). The service was impeccable, and the wait staff was extremely friendly. The one thing I was disappointed in was the Rangaku cocktail that we ordered, we ordered a ""carafe"" for 2 people which was $30, and the equivalent of said ""carafe"" was 2 very small teacups, not even in cocktail glasses. Also, it tasted nothing like the description on the menu ""an ultra rare blend of merlot barrel aged birds eye chili mead from South Africa, Batavia arrack, rooibus ginger tea and yuzu sorbet."" It was more like a mix of every possible alcohol and none of the flavors mentioned, I think that bathtub gin would have tasted better than this cocktail.

Fatty tuna is a really good thing here. That being said, I've had renditions of some of their dishes which were better elsewhere, such as the scallop in its shell (try Robataya). Soft-shell shrimp was tasty, but not sure of the point of eating the shell if it's not crispy. Not a date place, in my opinion, since you can't hear yourself talk, but maybe it's better at the sushi bar itself.

The hostess was able to accommodate me and let me dine a bit earlier. Behind those big long curtains, I had no idea what I was getting myself into. The second I walked in and sat down..i knew this place was definitely not your traditional omakase Japanese place. There were an overwhelming amount of people in the kitchen, and they were all facing the bar, so it was a bit uncomfortable. I opted for the $135 Omakase, and told them I didn't want any scallions on my dishes. And the first dish that came, came with scallions. He went back to the kitchen after I told him no scallions and they told him its chives. Way to communicate that to the clients with wrong information. Half way through the meal, my waitress that helped me in the beginning came by and asked me how was everything and that the lobster dish is her favorite dish (The dish that she was bringing out to me). Deep down I'm like okay..i bet you're just saying that. You know sometimes it's not what you say, but how you say it? Her words had no warmth in them, sounded so insincere. And the dish was soso, and flavorless despite the fact that it was spicy. Off to the sushi round. I sat infront a newly hired sushi chef? Now before I start, I am all about giving people a chance to learn and be good at something. But watching my sushi chef struggle that night was a pain in my wallet and my heart. He was so sweet and nice..but just erm...wasn't good enough...for the amount of money that I was paying..i think I deserve someone who is more skilled and knowledgeable in the art of sushi.My poor chef forgot how to make the rolls; he also stopped half way through the rounds and asked another chef how to make the sushis, and also what to serve me after I ate how many pieces. His more skilled co-worker, told him this and that..and said hurry up, the customer is waiting. And was very annoyed with my chef's inquires. Not the best dinning experience at a $$$$ place. But two positive note, my chef was the only person that was kind to me even though his skills didnt live up to his personality. Note 2..my water and tea was always filled, and not once did i needed to asked.",8,0,0,Ginny L.,"New York, NY",51,371,35

5.0,11/12/2013,"We went to Neta on Friday evening and had one of the best meals ever.  We are huge fans of some of the best sushi restaurants in NYC and frequently order the Omakase.  Friday night was no different, but what we experienced was one of a kind.  We sat at the sushi bar, in front of Jima, one of the most talented sushi chefs I have seen.  The Omakase began with dishes that ranged from a delicious crab salad to a fois gras egg custard, which was seriously one of the best courses I have ever tasted.  Soon the dishes consisted of unparalleled sushi  - they type that melts in your mouth and is accompanied by perfectly seasoned and sized rice.  The food was unparalleled.  The service was exceptional.  But, it was the sushi chef that made our experience unforgettable.  Jima's remarkable expertise as a sushi chef was clearly apparent.  Yet, his grace and rapport with us made the entire experience feel special.

However, this place did a poor job at keeping the hectic energy isolated to the kitchen. Service felt very rushed and not attentive given the price point.Service aside, the food was underwhelming. I had the middle choice omakase ($135?). While ingredients were amazing, given how much you're paying, it's a tablestake. The dishes lacked the aesthetic creativity and innovation I had anticipated. One thing that really upset me was watching the preparation of a maguro maki roll, one of the dishes of the meal. It was reminiscent of when i'd try to make sushi myself as a kid, oblong with rice falling out of one end! I mean, I could tell the guy was in a rush but there is no excuse. Even the guys rolling $5 california rolls at hong kong supermarket make them symmetrical. Never ate here while the original chef was around.

Came here on a Saturday night for dinner (party of 2). Tried the $90 Omakase menu, which was way too much food for the two of us. The food was extremely clean. Too clean perhaps. What I mean is that food lacked flavor (except for one dish). I know I am going to get massacred by ""real"" sushi lovers for that comment. Pros: - There was one dish which was out of this world. I believe it was rated as one of the 50 best things to put in your mouth by GQ magazine - Uni with scallops on a shell - One of the few places in USA that will serve you puffer fish. It's a unique experience that leaves a tingling sensation in your mouth- Cocktails are not badMy advice is to avoid the Omakase and order by the dish.

We were treated to decadent dish after decadent dish. Then we were served a grilled branzino which the chefs prepared like they were doing microsurgery with chopsticks. All of the chefs in the restaurant were crowded around a center table creating this masterpiece which they presented to us as if it were their first born. It was an incredible experience. After the branzino, we had o-toro sashimi with black truffle and wasabi oil. The dinner was fantastic. What made everything perfect was that I was being treated because you really get what you pay for and for this meal it was substantial.

5.0,8/29/2013,"The restaurant is simple but elegant with a long sushi bar, overlooking the chefs at work. I started off with the incredible Godzilla cocktail - ""An adventure packed full of shishito and Serrano pepper infused green chartreuse, Chinese celery, and rimmed with a spicy lime salt."" If you are into drinks with a slight hint of spice, this is it. The food was delicious, as well. Like the decor, the food was also simple but elegant. We opted out of the omakase because we didn't feel like so much food, so we ordered a la carte. Highlights were the duck and foie (duck breast, seared foie gras, scallions and crispy duck skin, all rolled in a hollowed out cucumber) and the grilled hamachi collar (yellowtail with daikon compote and pickled vegetables). The grilled scallop with uni was also excellent. Every dish was beautifully presented.The service was impeccable. The waiter was very sweet and doted on us, cleaning the table after each dish and bringing us fresh warm hand towels between courses. We had soba tea afterwards with pieces of soft barley in it.

Neta may be fairly new to the NYC sushi chain but it sure does exceed expectation, the best thing to do is the taster option where the sushi chef chooses what rolls and small dishes you're gonna eat for the evening. Every dish is carefully prepared and the presentation only adds to the greatness. Although I enjoy a good glass or sauv blanc with sushi, the beer selection has some new surprises beside the obvious Asahi. I tried a beer called Nipponia and it was love at first taste, I highly recommend it.

We ended up getting a nice table by the window.We got a bottle of sparking Rose from Spain which was really nice and not too bank busting.The Omakase here is 11 courses, and by the time we had the last one (the last 2 are dessert courses) we were full and not in the way where we needed a slice a few hours later.The sushi course was the best sushi I have ever had in this country, it reminded me of what I ate at the Tsukiji fish market a few years ago.

5.0,7/20/2013,"I loved it. I am not very well-versed in Japanese food, so perhaps it was more 'accessible' to someone like me, who leans towards the Spanish/French side of the dining spectrum (Alinea, EMP, Brooklyn Fare, etc). I was actually a little worried I would spend $200 bucks and not really appreciate or enjoy that much of it, but I wanted to go to Neta before I consider going to someplace like Masa... Kind of a warm up, if you will, as I obnoxiously work my way through my fancy restaurant list. I went with a group of 9 and for groups of that size, you have to do the Omakase (everyone must do the same one - either the table does $95 or $135pp). You get one extra dish if you do the $135 and supposedly some better cuts or something, but my friends were not down. So $95 it was! Everything was great: 1. Dungeness crab - Good. Very refreshing and nice start to the courses, but not mindblowing IMHO2. Spanish mackarel tataki - Excellent - super light and flavorful3. Grilled scallop with uni and mushrooms - Big points for uniqueness; very rich4. Blowfish tail tempura - Not really my thing, but glad i tried it. It's a pretty heavy fish and it was fried, so it tasted like... good fried fish. Note that they serve the NON poisonous fugu and the 'tingly' feeling on your tongue is actually from the pepper they use on the base (the server explained this to us) after half our table started freaking out, ha! 5. Szechuan spiced salmon on crispy rice - Fabulous!! One of my favorite dishes. Seasoned, slightly spicy salmon served on a bed of crispy hot rice. MMMMM.6. Maki and Sushi - So. much. food. I think we had 12 pieces per person!! They asked if we had enough and offered to bring us more if not. Haha, we were so full we could hardly move, but it was so good it was a tough offer to turn down. 7. Green Tea + Rice/Shiso Leaf Palate Cleanser - Kind of thought this was boring (rice wrapped in a leaf), especially after eating 12 pieces of sushi, but more interesting than serving a sorbet or something. 8. Peanut butter ice cream - Not in love with this, but very innovative. Super rich and nicely captured the sweet-salty paradox. I also had a champagne cocktail with cherry blossoms (the first one on the menu) and it was great. We also ordered a yuzu-tequila-salt shot for the table as it was my friends birthday and it was also very nice! Be classy and sip it, it's surprisingly not bitter or too-alcohol-forward at all.I would definitely be back. My bill ended up being like $150 or so for a TON of food (and we were there for 3 hours). A bunch of other restaurants in the area are not nearly as good and cost just as much (ahem, Vin Sur Vingt). I heart Neta!!!",3,1,0,Kels P.,"Manhattan, NY",10,54,5
4.0,7/18/2013,"I came to Neta for my birthday last week and it was good. It's definitely high end, unique and good quality but it was missing something for me. We got the $95 omakase and I enjoyed the crab salad and uni with scallops a lot. I wasn't too thrilled with the blow fish tempura, cause it tasted like nothing special to me. I didn't see a point in making it into tempura and making it taste like any other fish. As for the sushi, I was the most impressed with the toro. That was close-your-eyes-and-moan good.  I wasn't too into the other sushi pieces they served like the seared tuna and we didn't get a whole lot in mass or numbers. Maybe 5 smaller than usual pieces? I was also disappointed that I didn't get uni sushi which is my favorite. As for desert we got the peanut butter ice cream which was good, but presentation definitely could be improved. Also, the lights went out for like 5 minutes during dinner service which made the dinner more fun because the sushi chefs kept working in the dark like awesome bears.",0,2,0,Jo K.,"New York, NY",274,505,429
4.0,7/15/2013,"Neta may not be gently priced by any standard, but for high quality sushi by a pedigreed sushi chef such as Nick Kim, it's almost a bargain compared to many other sushi restaurants in the city. Sitting at the chef counter is definitely the way to go here, as I did during my visit with the bf and good friend Bryan L. It's a totally fun experience sitting at the chef counter as you can witness all of the action in the kitchen and interact with the various chefs as they diligently prepare your dishes to be placed right in front of you as it comes out. While you can order a la carte off the regular menu, it's probably sound to go with one of the omakase menus ($95/$135) and let the kitchen go to work. We all went with the less expensive option, which started off with some light cold dishes, followed by a couple hot dishes, sushi, and dessert. 1. Dungeness crab salad with cucumber, wild parsley in a dashi vinaigrette. I loved the simplicity of this dish, and the crunchiness of the cucumber combined with the sweet crab and lightly savory dashi.2. Spanish mackarel tataki was another cold seafood salad, complemented by the crispy tempura flakes that added interesting texture and a bit of decadence to an otherwise light dish.3. Grilled scallop with uni, maitake, garlic soy butter and lime was without a doubt my favorite dish of the night. The scallop was gently grilled to maintain its sweet tenderness, and the uni was luscious and buttery. I really love the combination of uni, soy and lime - so this dish totally blew me away.4. Blowfish tail tempura with lotus root, chrysanthemum leaf and snap pea was surprisingly meaty for a white fleshed fish. The tempura batter itself was nice and light, helped by what I assumed to be rice flour.5. Szechuan spiced salmon was another dish that may seem simple in concept but was amazing in its execution. The crispy rice was better than any grilled onigiri you're likely to find at an izakaya, while the salmon itself was fresh and buttery, not at all masked by the spicy sauce.6. Sushi - our various sushi offerings included toro, salmon with a dab of spicy mayo, kanpachi (yellowtail), hirame (fluke), suji (grilled toro sinew), a ungai cucumber roll, sweet potato and shiso tempura roll, and kanpachi & scallion roll. I believe that Neta sources some of their fish from the northeast instead of strictly from Japan, which I actually think is pretty refreshing. Locavore, if you will.7. Palate cleanser of a hand roll with shiso and other ingredients I don't quite recall - it was pretty herbaceous yet slightly savory, an interesting pre-dessert bite.8. Peanut butter ice cream was actually very Japanese-tasting, not rich like typical peanut butter, but more like powdered peanut flour churned with the cream. Not particularly satisfying the way I was hoping it would be, but decent.Other than the delicately prepared food, drinks at Neta are surprisingly great as well. I don't normally order cocktails with food, but the Rising Sun cocktail made with apricot kernal infused liquor, citrus and terroir gin was refreshing, acidic and paired nicely with the cold seafood dishes. My friend Bryan loved the Rangaku punch so much that he ordered two before even getting to the third course. The wine list isn't long, but the Gruner and Sauvignon Blanc offered by the glass were satisfying and light enough to pair with the sushi. Service is on point too, nothing to complain about at all. For a relatively new place, Neta is a pretty well-oiled machine. I'd be more than happy to return, perhaps for the $135 omakase option in order to have a few more uni and caviar dishes.",1,0,1,Cecilia Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",762,644,43
4.0,7/15/2013,"Went to Neta for date night with my main squeeze, and we were definitely pleased with the experience. All of the servers/food runners with whom we interacted were pleasant and kind; they didn't even judge us (at least not overtly) when we accidentally used the ""finger towels"" at the wrong time and subsequently in the wrong manner! Bonus points for putting me at ease!We did the $95 omakase and while it was impressive, I'm not sure it was worth $95 each. Still, as many have stated, the blowfish and scallops were noteworthy for sure. The sashimi was also tasty, though I would have expected to see more exotic fish than salmon and tuna. The Japanese ""parsley"" was a nice addition to several of the dishes that I hadn't had before. All in all, everything was excellent .. I'd just have preferred some more experimental dishes for the pricetag.Definitely recommend the Kikusui Junmai Ginjo sake as it is some of the best I've had Japanese restaurants to date. Their cocktails were also fun, and the ""Godzilla"" could certainly be gulped down in one sip. So tasty!Music was fun -- a lot of Jay-Z and Kanye West, actually, haha!Neta is definitely a solid choice, don't get me wrong! But for me, something was missing.

4.0,7/7/2013,"The best parts of their omakase (tasting menu) are amazing and unique, things you may not have experienced anywhere in NYC. The more standard sushi parts are also good. I'd say it's worth the high price for the experience. Make sure to try some of the more unusual items including the blowfish with crispy vegetables and the cucumber/cilantro sushi thing. The sake they recommended was great - again, slightly different. I've tried three of the desserts here. They were all simple and great, just 1 or 2 ingredients. Perfect way to end a big Japanese meal.Atmosphere is friendly and the design is pretty cool, fun modern and simple japanese vibe. Only issue: the service gets overbearing. I think we must have interacted with over 10 different people  during omakase and all of them wanted to give us a spiel, including the too-cool-for sushi-school dude in the bandana and sunglasses. Everyone was nice, but it's just too much. There also seems to be some confusion as to who's taking which order etc.. not a big deal though, it's still easily one of the most interesting sushi places downtown now.",0,0,0,Mark B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,34,0
3.0,6/11/2013,"My sister invited the entire family to Neta. Since we were a group of 5, we all had to get the omakase. Sadly, we also couldn't get seats by the bar since we made reservations rather late. No biggie.We chose the $95 omakase. The first two dishes - salmon with ponzu and spanish mackerel with shredded daikon were alright. Tasty, fresh and tender but nothing extraordinary. What I call the Neta ""signature dish"", the scallop with uni was good. The uni from Santa Barbara was buttery and salty like the sea. Yum. The scallop was tender. Delicious. Probably my favorite dish of the entire meal, but again, nowhere near $95 amazing. I was really excited for the fugu. I had never had fugu before and was very excited. I would have been happier had my first fugu experience been sashimi but cooked fugu was still supposed to be spectacular from what I heard. It was alright. Fugu, at least to me, tastes like swordfish and halibut had a baby. Not flaky but not beefy either. Somewhat tender. I did feel a little tingling in my mouth but no one else in my family did. This was definitely not the fugu everyone raves about! Maybe people just hype things up way too much?Next was the spicy salmon on top of fried rice served on a hot plate. It was alright. My mom thought it was too spicy. I would concur. It's a little spicier than the spiciest salmon or tuna roll I've had, which is pretty spicy. Sorry for using the s word so much. Then came the myriad of sushi and rolls. I liked the otoro (fatty tuna) and the mackerel. The sweet potato roll was also really delicious. The shrimp was good too. My parents liked the sinew. I thought it was alright. The sushi was good, maybe even somewhat great, but not what I was expecting from the chefs who trained with the esteemed head chef of Masa. Then we had tea and a palate cleanser of ume wrapped around a shiso leaf and some nori seaweed. It was good. Refreshing and clever. I would have never thought of it. Good step in originality. Then came desert. We had a grapefruit sorbet garnished with grapefruit and mint chiffonade. It was really good. I wonder how much sugar they put in though haha. It was so deliciously sweet. Yum! A good note to end on. Overall, the food is good. I wouldn't really say great. We only had about 4 different types of fish across the 9 or so plates. Salmon, spanish mackerel, tuna and yellowtail I believe. I guess otoro can count as its own separate thing. If you want more variety, definitely go to other Japanese restaurants. At Aburiya Kinnosuke for example, I probably had 8 different varieties of fish on one sashimi plate. I just wished Neta didn't recycle salmon and mackerel into 3 of the dishes. There also just wasn't anything special about any of the dishes. The scallop and uni was probably the best and one of the more creative dishes but there still wasn't anything AMAZING about it. I guess none of us thought the meal was worth the $620 price tag. Now onto service. Service was good. They kept refilling our glasses and asked us if everything was good and took good care of us. Very friendly! However, the restaurant is very small and there are a lot of waitstaff!!! Sometimes they just stand there and it feels awkward due to how small the restaurant is. Not their fault obviously. I did find it funny though that there were two managers in dark suits who kept walking around as if they had a purpose even though they kind of were just meandering about. It was a little weird. I meant to give 3.5/5 stars but Yelp doesn't let you give .5 and I didn't feel Neta warrants 4 stars so I gave it 3. Come to Neta to try some signature dishes like the uni and scallops. The uni porridge and toro tartar I hear are also very good but the omakase was definitely not all it's hyped up to be.

The uni porridge was delish!  Had the Akami sashimi salad which was good- basically tiny bits of sliced tuna for $24.  Hirami cucumber- was decent.  Grilled shrimp was ok.  I liked it because it was softshell and I just ate the whole thing- to the horror of my dining mate :)  Koreans.  Then we had the crab avo and shrimp tempura rolls .  Yum.  Rolls are good and thank goodness for them as we would have walked out of there starving.  Drinks were fantastic!  We tried the Siamese dream and the rishiri.  Then I had some sake.  Then we paid $200 + tip.,0,0,0,Jane K.,"New York, NY",72,267,1

The fried dishes were not all that great since they were all very oily and took away from the natural taste of the fish.

4.0,2/16/2013,"Came here for a Saturday dinner. I must say everything I got here was quite delicious.My friend and I didn't get the omakase menu, but we instead got two small plates and a bunch of sushi. For the first dish, we got toro tartar and caviar. It was good, and the combination of toro tartar and caviar was excellent, but despite being the most expensive item we ordered that day, it was probably the least impressive. The fact that the portion is so minuscule did not help, although it's understandable considering the ingredients they use. The next dish that we ordered, uni porridge, was far better and it was my favorite item of the day. Being a huge uni lover, the super rich, super uni flavor of this porridge was just to die for. I think they should rename it as uni risotto though, because that is what it is more like.For sushi, I ordered 2 unis (I know, I was going crazy for unis), 1 toro, 1 kanpachi (yellowtail), 1 ama-ebi (sweet shrimp, daily special), 1 sake (salmon) and 1 akami. Everything was great, although I liked uni and ama-ebi the most. In general, I think their sushi were on par with those from Sushi Azabu. Overall, this is definitely one of the best Japanese restaurants I have been to in the city. The food is excellent, the wait staff are attentive and friendly and the venue is clean and accommodating. I am taking off one star because of the price and the fact that their sushi is not super authentic: they served kanpachi with fried potatoes and sake with spicy mayo, which went pretty well with the sushi, but I like my sushi simple and plain.

We got the larger omakase and there were at least 15 different courses, ranging from kani, to mackerel, to shrimp and eel, to uni and fugu (yes, the blowfish).  Everything was fresh and thoughtfully prepared.  My favorites were the American Sturgeon caviar with toro tartare and toast points, fugu with tempura vegetables, and anything with uni (from Santa Barbara).  They also carved pieces of fish off of the tuna bone right there in front of us which reminded me of the bone-in jamon displays at Spanish restaurants.  The waiter was friendly and the mixologist was constantly busy mixing drinks.  We had peanut butter ice cream for dessert.I withheld the 4th star from Neta because I didn't feel like the chefs were passionate about the food, a lot of what I tasted was bland to my palate (fish that didn't taste fishy, but also didn't taste like anything at all, anyone can serve stellar Santa Barbara uni).  Maybe I was having a bad day, maybe they were having a bad day... it was raining out --- who knows.  Nata was a different experience, however it isn't a contender for me as one of the best sushi restaurants in NYC.",3,0,0,Jenny L.,"Queens, NY",95,191,288

I noticed this omakase gives u a quite healthy amount of toro and uni (compared to other omakases), each served many different ways (seared toro, uni w scallop - wow).  I could comment on all the dishes but others covered this. Few comments:* drinks- Airborn was good, Owl of the Woods not good (sour or just weird, neither of us could finish it)* server/waiter needs to chew gum. Sorry I don't know a nicer way to say this. Given the frequency and proximity of dish descriptions, having that halitotious aroma prior to each new dish was not a welcome delight. Service was great tho.* I personally liked the peanut butter ice cream. Only fails for me were the fried shrimp sushi piece (reminded me of a chinese dish - prefer amaebi shrimp raw w its sharp deadly head fried for consumption); other fail was the last piece which looked like sushi but turned out to just be a shiso leaf wrapped inside seaweed - I get the whole palette cleansing thing, but visually u expect one last amazing bite that turns out to be a leaf.

Sushi: a Japanese food consisting of cooked vinegared rice (shari) combined with other ingredients (neta)Because the name is from Japanese, I had expected a traditional Japanese cuisine at the restaurant. However, I was surprised that the food was actually more American than Japanese! 2 head chefs of Neta, Chef Kim was Head Chef at Masa since its opening and Chef Lau was Head Chef at Bar Masa. Both came from Masa and their cuisine is contemporary Japanese or Japanese-inspired American cuisine. The food was really tasty and loved it! I usually like traditional Japanese but Neta is exception. I would highly recommend for everyone who likes dishes something interesting.Food: 4.5 Great and interesting.

We came after seeing a drool-worthy photo of the porridge, but that was actually our least favorite. Meanwhile, each bite of the scallop topped with uni were little unforgettable tastes of heaven. The uni sushi was also simple yet magnificent - so fresh, and completely melt-in-your-mouth goodness. Also tried the Duck & Foie, which was a tasty cucumber cup filled with juicy duck and slighty seared foie gras - so lavish! Recommend ordering all of the above, with the exception of the porridge.Drink: Honestly have zero idea what drinks we ordered because we were too pre-occupied with the food. Other: Sit at the sushi bar!!! The open kitchen is really fun and makes the entire atmosphere of the place.

We were treated like celebrities (which clearly we are not).The food was delicious,we were served in a reasonable amount of time and overall the experience was wonderful.However, that all changed last night. We took a friend of ours, with our two boys who are also sushi lovers. We waxed poetic about how they were going to just love the food.WRONG! the food, awful, the service, horrible, the attitude, not accomodating.We were told that a famous chef called and wanted to come in, so the entire resturant went into a tizzy and all of the ""average"" customers were complaining.The heart and soul of any business are the everyday people who make it tick.We are done with NETA.

1.0,7/10/2012,"Cannot overstate the disappointment. The nigiri was pretty good. We each had a piece.Then we waited 45 minutes for the waiter to bring our maki. I had a sense that because my companion and I were dressed plainly in comparison with the rest of the clientele, we were given short shrift - worst table in the house and we were basically ignored for most of our one and a half hours in the restaurant. Maybe the most damning piece of evidence is that from what I could tell, we were the only people in the restaurant who did not order the quite expensive tasting, and it seemed to me that for this reason we were relegated to second class status.The worst part was that the fish in the maki was clearly an inferior product to what was served as nigiri. It seemed the cooks were trying to hide their bad ingredients, which is particularly shameful in a place with the name Neta (meaning the ingredients used in sushi). As my companion put it, at the end of the day, it was better than supermarket sushi. I would say it's much better than supermarket sushi, but not as good as Yasuda and certainly not worth going to given the prices and the disdain with which this establishment seems to feel it can treat certain customers.TL;DR: pretty good food, bad service, too expensive, will actively recommend against.",7,0,3,Michael K.,"New York, NY",6,105,7
1.0,7/4/2012,"This place is so overrated. Though the quality of the fish is pretty good, the flavor combinations of the dishes as well as the overall 'creativity' is sorely lacking. I could probably prepare better sushi myself. To pay $95/person for an omakase menu and be served eel with teriyaki sauce on rice with seaweed that has quality equal to the Japanese $8 lunch spot down the block from my office is pretty pathetic. The description of the cocktails sounded pretty unappetizing... or just flat out disgusting. One glance-over resulted in both of us vetoing any of these options. We ended up getting a glass each of their overpriced wine, which I wouldn't really say 'complemented' the flavors of the fish we had. Service is really stuffy. The servers, though attentive, need to work on not being so robotic. It's like they all memorized their lines, and if you tried to interrupt them, they'd be stumped. The peanut butter ice cream at the end was decent and a surprise, but I probably would have preferred a more traditional Asian flavor like green tea.

5.0,7/2/2012,"Having an omakase at the sushi bar is like watching the Iron Chef...live.It was an intriguing experience!But before we get into the food, let's get the ugly stuff out of the way:1) Upon making reservation over the phone, the host was a bit surprised by our request to be seated at the sushi bar..if this happens to you, don't let her comment scare you away. 2) Bf specifically told the host that the dinner reservation was for my birthday.  I don't expect the restaurant to throw in anything free, but a happy birthday upon our arrival would be nice.  3) The check came right after our dessert and before we even had the chance to finish the green tea.Perhaps I am being picky, but for a $400 tab (for 2), I reserve the right to be critical.Here is what you'd get under the $135 omakase:1) Amuse bouche: grilled pepper (good flavor but too spicy for me)2) Dungeness Crab: way to start the omaksase, this was very refreshing3) Toro tartar & Caviar: mind you, this costs $48 on the menu.  Is it $48 good?  Probably not, but the portion was generous4) Grilled Whole Scallop: Anything with uni is good, this dish blew my mind away5) Blow fish karage (w/corn tempura & yomogi leaf): This was my favorite dish, um fried blow fish, it was so delicious6) Szechuan Spiced Salmon: bf liked the rice cake, but I thought the spicy salmon was nothing special7) Sushi a la carte (1 piece each):  a. Toro  b. Spanish mackerel  c. Yellowtail (w/ fried potato flake)  d. Salmon (w/Szechuan sauce)  e. Tuna (w/garlic sushi rice): the combination of garlic rice and raw tuna was genius!  f.

Ohhh yeah :)As for drinks, I will just stick with water since the focus here is on the fish itself.  Bf got a glass of cherry blossom special ($15)..well, let's just say, cocktail is probably not Neta's specialty.  We were offered two shots of very fine tequila on the house (because I mentioned to Chef Jimmy that I am friends with a colleague of his from Masa), it was very good.  I don't see that drink on the menu tho but if you manage to strike a conversation with the chef, you could be in for a treat!",3,1,0,Cindy W.,"New York, NY",42,135,113

Overall left feeling full in exactly the right way, i.e. not bloated but happy. In terms of raw ingredient quality Neta is definitely excellent, and you can clearly tell the difference between a Neta roll and your average sushi joint. Main downer for me was the limited originality of the most of the composition, with the exception of the blowfish. I know I did the $95 omakase which is supposed to be less crazy than the $125, but hmm for that price maybe it's legit to expect something more... The other minor downer was their very limited wine list - sake's ok but I'll take wine over it every day.

1.0,6/22/2012,"The food is OK and largely fresh, certainly not bad in any way but when you pay $100+ per head you except a certain level of quality, specialty in the dining experience and uniqueness of flavors. You can safely say it has none of these.The quality of the sushi in terms of presentation was no better than your local chinese lunch time corner place and similarly had way too much rice. In fairness most of the fish was very fresh but having eaten sushi in Japan, all over the world and in NY you can do far better all over the city for far less.The overall omekase experience was pretty underwhelming and when Morimoto is not far away for a similar pricepoint, you would go there every day and twice on Sundays. Again the food was largely fresh but if I just wanted fresh food would go to a fish and farmer's market.The cocktail selection is awful by NYC standards and the wine not so much better and  given the awful nature a minimum of $15 per glass would suggest if you must try this place stick with water. They a selection of Sake's but if that's your need go to Sakagura where the selection much larger and the sushi/sashimi is far better.All in all this is an overpriced, trying to hard, average food quality, appeal to supposed elitist foodie types place where as if you wanted either a better dining experience, food quality, drink quality, elite service levels and/or combo of all four you could go so many many places.Hopefully the guy who wrote the NY Times write up that prompted us to try this place never gets to write for the paper or indeed any food publication again.

You can see photos of all 11 courses posted on yelp so I won't get into all of them, but the main highlights:Cocktail Glass with Toro and Caviar - this is supposedly on the menu for $48 but you get it as part of the tasting. They give you warm bread on the side to eat with it - I ate all the bread which was sad, bc i really wanted to stick my tongue into the glass to lick the remaining toro and caviar - but clearly this wouldn't have looked the best in such a nice placeToro Sushi - slightly darker pink color... in fact, what is great about all the sushi is how perfectly balanced they have the amount of rice to sushi.  You don't feel as though either side is lacking or too much.  Also, they have a nice wet napkin in a small dish for you to cleanse your fingers after eating each (they encourage you to eat with your fingers)The cocktails drinks are pricey ($15) and you don't get too much - to be honest, I would have skipped this and just had water as the food has enough flavor on its own.Definitely must go to place...

4.0,6/8/2012,"It ain't Sushi Yasuda, but for half the price, it's just fine.Although it should have been one of the more anticipated restaurant openings this year, Neta slowly sneaked under the radar. Its almost unassuming location on West 8th St. seemed to project the aspirations of ex-Masa and Bar Masa head chefs Nick Kim and Jimmy Lau: let's keep it quiet and let the food inside speak for itself. The interior design and sit-down sushi bar echo the cool, try-not-too-hard vibe of Asian restaurant stalwarts Momofuku Ssam Bar and Momofuku Ko but without the boisterous music, packed crowds, and ubiquitous John MacEnroe poster.We ordered the small omakase menu ($95), which consisted of a flight of 11 amuse bouches, small appetizers, sushi, savory courses, and dessert. Following the Thomas Keller philosophy of eating, each dish consisted of two or three bites, maximizing the pleasure for the diner, before moving on to the next course. The meal started with a small plate of dungeness crab with cucumber, wild parsley, and dashi vinaigrette. The crab was sweet, briny and delicate, with the herbs and vinaigrette dancing effortlessly within the dish. Grilled whole scallop with uni (with shell) was by far the best dish, and will probably be touted as a classic at Neta. The creamy, buttery uni wrapped itself lasciviously around bites of tender, succulent scallop,and the dash of lime cleansed the plate for another bite of unctuous goodness.Following were several flights of sushi: sawara (Spanish mackerel), kanpachi (yellowtail), unagi (eel), and toro (eel). You could tell how fresh this fish was, with the taste of the fresh sea lingering on the palate, rather than the metallic tang of sub-par sushi joints. The rice was adequately seasoned with salt and vinegar, which provided a harmonious backdrop for the sushi.Before dessert, the waiter presented a savory course of ume (pickled plum) wrapped in shiso leaf and rice. The minty savory taste of shiso and the sweet and sour zing of the ume is a flavor combination that blows me away every time.Ending the meal was peanut butter ice cream with green tea. Probably the least awe-insipiring dish of the petit omakase flight, but I will hand it to a restaurant with some serious back-of-house talent to serve a dish that shows it doesn't take itself seriously.A minor trifle service with service: My friend had a gluten allergy, and with each course the runner/server kept mentioning that the next dish and the soy sauce was gluten-free. I understand the first or second time someone mentions it, but it doesn't bear repeating for each successive course.Neta is neither the restaurant for the all-you-can-eat sushi chowhound, nor the invetererate sushi snob. Nevertheless, Neta is one of the few Japanese restaurants that balances the road between high-end, haute Japanese at reasonable prices. Definitely a place that I expect to return to.",8,3,5,Jonas M.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,166,0

Now I came here thinking the sushi and fish will blow me away but MEH not even close.

He definitely cared about our experience there, and was a cool, approachable guy. He asked for our feedback on the drinks, saying he was always working to improve things.The food was amazing.

I know I won't be able to do this restaurant justice, but my favorite aspect of the food was the soft texture of the fish coupled with a crunchy, salty bite.

1.0,5/16/2012,"Came with my fellow sushi snob and couldn't run out any faster. At first glance on the menu - you'll see all of these americanized rolls. I am a purist in terms of eating raw fish, so if you add the word spicy anywhere in a $130 omekase menu claiming top notch quality fish, it's giant red flag. We asked our waiter about the Omakase menu and he told us that the Omakase would be based off of the a la carte, just a touch more special. We were not sold at all and decided to walk out.Low and behold the manager ran over to us as we exited and started an argument, belittling us as if we had never had sushi in our lives, asking us if we knew what ""Omakase"" meant (you've got to be kidding me), asking if we ever had dinner at Masa (yes, 3 times to be exact),  claiming their fish is the freshest and most special in the city. At the end, i asked him directly, ""if your fish is top notch, why bother tainting it with spicy mayo?"", and headed over to Blue Hill's bar area for our dinner alternative.For a true top notch sushi Omakase, head over to Sushi Azabu instead.",8,5,2,Varuca S.,"Manhattan, NY",8,22,42
4.0,5/13/2012,"Neta's comparisons to Masa are definitely warranted. After all, the fact that the chefs derive from Masa and BAR Masa is probably the worst kept secret in all of high-end restaurants. Neta boasts this fact on its website and Yelpers repeat it in reviews and hopefully the readers get it. It's ex-Masa at a discount. It's also a two month old Masa. Larry G., my fellow sushi snob extraordinaire, took time out of his ""funemployment"" schedule to visit the latest Omakase to hit NYC. On our first step inside, we knew something was different about Neta. There was no Japanese hostess. There was no ""Ittadakimasu"" greeting. It was disturbingly more Americanized than other Japanese restaurants we were accustomed to. We were seated in front of Chef Nick Kim, one of the main chefs at Masa. He was skillful with the knife and knowledgeable about the fish, but really lacked the charisma other sushi-ya's had, even the ones that weren't American. His voice was very soft, so it was difficult to hear him speak and while Larry and I were doing some personal catching up, our fellow patrons tried to engage him in banter, which either failed horribly or his sense of humour just wasn't what we were use to. Such quips like, ""Do you make sushi for [the bartender]?"" (bartender was a friend of these patrons), were answered with a ""I try' - basically little or no elaboration to each answer. Anyway, the charisma wasn't a big deal as long as the food was good. For $135, it was definitely a quality omakase.  We started with a couple of hot dishes and proceeded with 10+ pieces of sushi. The otoro and uni were great, as it is at other restaurants. A piece that stood out was a warm soft shell crab placed on top of sushi rice and partially wrapped by seaweed. Another one that I enjoyed was the tuna scraped off the bone. A helper brought out the gigantic carcass of a tuna and Chef Nick proceeded to scoop three huge chunks of lean meat from the fish. Again, it was partially wrapped like the soft-shell crab and it was savory and tasted incredibly fresh (obviously). We were also served fugu tempura, aka blowfish, bka the fish that will poison you if it's not cut correctly. Before I bit into it, I texted my girlfriend my goodbye note (text). Good thing Chef Nick had deft hands. The fish turned out to have a tenderness between swordfish and cod. It was a good experience, but nothing that will make me crave it again. To end the night, we had the most obnoxious dessert a foodie could order. The truffled ice cream. Yes, it was a heavy cream with truffle shaved on top. Definitely good, but I felt so pretentious eating it.The omakase was good, but there are definitely some kinks to be worked out. The service was nubile.

Obviously, the best experience is at the bar, especially here, as you can take in all the action in the kitchen. Unfortunately for us, there was a family of 4 to the left of us who had all of Chef Kim's attention. I tried to schmooze him here and there but fell short. We settled for the $95pp omakase whereas the family of 4 (including two young children) went with the $135pp. The children were ballers. Clearly.The timing of each item came out perfectly. As we wrapped up one dish, the next was soon on its way. I also loved that we could see each chef/cook in the kitchen working on each specific item. I'll spare you the itemized list as everyone has pretty much nailed it down but I would highly recommend going the extra $40. I foolishly assumed that the difference was the one tartar/uni dish. Wrong. They upgrade your rice and sub/add some other clever dishes. My heart sank every time I looked to my left and saw the 8yr old devouring his dish that I wish I had. Service was top notch. Everyone, and I mean everyone, asked how our dinner was and if we needed anything. I like that. Makes me feel special.The location was pretty interesting, W. Village.

4.0,4/21/2012,"Had the higher end omakase; everything is delicious. The toro tartare is sublime I could have eaten 10 of those; even the accompanying toast points are absolute perfection. Clam risotto, uni, and the rice in the sushi rolls is done to perfection. The actual sashimi is perfectly fine but I wouldn't say it's the best in the city. The 11 courses are all tiny so you don't feel stuffed at all. Efficient reservations- had one for 9pm, walked in at 9pm and the seats were reserved- no waiting. I was surprised how many chefs/workers were behind the counter- probably as many as there were customers (place was full). Maybe this is because it was opening week- not sure.It would be nice (and profitable) if they asked if you want any additional dishes before serving dessert. The chefs don't have much to say about the food except for relaying the title. Would've liked to see a wider cocktail selection- although the daily cocktail- when I went it was sakura flavored sparkling sake- was just lovely I had 6 of them.  It's served in a champagne flute; smells of cherry blossom, and has a dreamy rose color.

4.0,4/15/2012,"First review, so let's start with the food:My wife and I ordered the dungeness crab, edamame, king mushrooms, grilled whole scallop, neta roll (toro and scallion), grilled maitake, lotus, and tofu rolls.Nearly everything was amazing. The standouts were the king mushrooms, grilled whole scallop, and all of the veg rolls. The king mushroom small plate and the scallop were two of the most unique dishes I've ever had and worth getting. We ordered the grapefruit granite, which sounded good, but ended up not agreeing with our palates. The staff completely made up for it by making us a cherry dessert which defies description. Other:The staff deserves special praise for being very natural, without being pushy or rushing you. The space is very modern and unpretentious. It encourages conversation with the person you're with or, if you're alone, you can sit by the bar and watch the skilled artisans perform their craft.

3.0,4/12/2012,"Food, style and presentation are all high here, but still feels too expensive for what you're getting. It's def not at the level of Sushi Yasuda or Sushi of Gari, but it's not priced so differently. Additionally, their rolls only have 4-5 pieces instead of 6-8 like most places. I don't want to sound like a penny pincher here, but that's a substantive difference. The appetizers were a little bit better value in my opinion - the spicy salmon rice and the dungeness crab ones packed a lot of flavor into a few small bites. However, still felt expensive - 15 bucks for a few small bites? Not worth it unless you're really getting exceptional quality.I did really like the layout here.

The restaurant was uber-busy (seemed like there was 8 people on the floor), but I think what made this such a great night was the service.

I love anything with crispy rice and the fact that it was served on a hot rock, giving the rice a longer opportunity to crisp made this dish a real winner.  The spicy salmon was also super tasty making this a great unique flavor combinationKinuta Maki Ponzu - Very tasty refreshing bites.

I had the Chu Toro and Salmon, Y had the Sea Beam - and we loved it all.  For rolls, we shared the Neta roll (toro and scallion) and the Kampachi & Spicy Potato.  Both were good but I absolutely loved the Kampachi - nice and crunchyOverall this was a great experience.  Only miss was the service.

Seating was a bit awkard, as our table for 6 was in a tucked-away corner, making service a bit difficult and challenging for the wait staff.  There are a few kinks in the service that need to be ironed out -- e.g. our waiter confused our dishes twice, telling us mistakingly that it was one kind of fish vs. another -- as is expected in the few weeks of opening.

The party next to us had the omakase and Nick, the head chef really put of lot of ""extras"" to make the omakase worth ordering: 1) personal attention from Nick, 2) all 11 courses were prepared by him versus our orders were all prepared by another sushi chef 3) got to sample dishes that are not on the menu(and they all look very good!) and 4) they use a lot of caviars, truffles, foie gras and uni in their omakase courses.  None the less, our food were all pretty good. I like the way that they made their grilled scallops with uni eventhough our scallops was slight over cooked. Neta toro roll was the best roll I had tonight, we also ordered some toro, scallops and yellowtail sushi and I find their tuna dishes all very good.

Last but not least, I enjoyed the free sample of fried blowfish from Nick very much, maybe he saw me drooling over what he was making the whole night ;) perhaps because it is still their first few weeks in business, service was a little slow and we had to call our waitress to refill our tea several times.",1,0,0,R Y.,"New York, NY",27,64,93
3.0,3/21/2012,"after urbandaddy's blip about neta, my japanese feasting group (ironically, none of us are japanese) were very excited to try neta. the space is cozy with a large extended sushi bar similar to soto down the street.  we were seated at a table (i had requested the sushi bar, but i guess there was a miscommunication).  they have a concise cocktail & wine list and a bit more thorough sake selection (don't expect sakagura).  we maneuvered through the sake menu (with carafes, 300ml and 720ml size bottles, it gives an opportunity to taste a number).  as for food, we went with the higher-priced omakase menu to give us the most fitting representation of the best the chefs had to offer.  the meal began on an incredibly amazing note - toro tartare with a large dollop of caviar.  served with little toasts - this was KILLER. next up, cooked slices of scallop served in the scallop shell in a gingery, buttery, briney sauce with a big lobe of uni (sea urchin) on top.  this was visually impressive, and the buttery sauce was wonderful (i confess: i drank it from the shell), but the scallop was overcooked.  and the uni...my favorite uni... it just didn't measure up to the quality of sushi yasuda's uni.  our next course was the fried blowfish (aka fugu), which was another notch down.  first it was really greasy.  i'm generally not one to complain about greasiness, but i expected it to be light.  then there was that giant bone in the middle, off of which i had to gnaw the fish... it was a very... authentic asian experience.  and i'm alive to speak of it!the next course went in an interesting direction: a small dish of fried rice with shaved black truffles.  since we'd be eating rice with the sushi, i was surprised that the omakase would include rice.  now, i heart black truffles AND fried rice, but perhaps it was the quality of the truffles, or just the combination of it all... it just didn't work.  the black truffles were too mellow... the fried rice, a little bland.  it just didn't work.onto the main event: the SUSHI.  with former masa chefs at the helm, you better believe i am expecting some amazing quality fish.we received a number of nigiri: toro (this was really quite good... and it was o-toro, if you're wondering).  kanpachi, scottish salmon, sea bream, uni, grilled toro... other than the toro, they just werent that flavorful.  were they fresh?  sure.... but...not as flavorful. after the nigiri, we moved onto maki... they brought us unagi & cucumber and toro scallion.  the seaweed wrapping these rolls didn't have the deep aroma that you find elsewhere.  the other problem with these maki were how loosely they were rolled.  it felt like they were going to fall apart as you lifted them.we finished the savory portion with a vegetarian nigiri - ume, jicama wrapped in shiso.  we actually received this twice because the service was haphazard and confused.  i wish we had received the toro tartare with caviar twice!!  our final course, which was actually quite a palate cleanser, was a grapefruit granita, and it was very tasty.our real problem with neta was the service.  the food didn't measure up to my expectations, but the service really ruined the experience.  it is very important for anyone who deals with sushi to know the source of the fish being served, e.g., uni is usually santa barbara, sometimes maine and, even more rarely, hokkaido - and i'd like to know which.  when i asked, the server told me SAN DIEGO... never in my life have i heard san diego until my evening at neta (the water in san diego is too warm for uni).  this is just one example; the servers didnt know where any of the fish was from.  on top of the lack of knowledge, there were lulls between courses to the point where we asked a few times if there were any courses remaining because we'd just be sitting around for a while.  since we went during their first two weeks, i hope they'll work the kinks out with time.the bill was pretty stiff - about $275 after drinks, tax & tip, and considering the price, for my next sushi dinner, i will be returning to my friend mitsu at sushi yasuda and have the omakase dinner with wonderful classically prepared sushi served in a timely, well thought out order.",1,1,0,Christine Y.,"Manhattan, NY",4,27,3

5.0,3/18/2012,"Dear Chef Kim, Thank you for the mini Masa reprise last night. Your observable dedication to the diners, displayed by your interaction with each of us at the sushi bar (glad I was able to sit so close to you), as well as those sitting at the tables, made us appreciate our experience that much more. In some ways, I think it worked out better for us that we went on your second weekend and not on your opening weekend. Despite the occasional awkwardness of the waitstaff (excluding Justin, who was a delight), it seems that many of the kinks that go along with a brand new venture (as indicated by the earlier reviewers) have been smoothed out. I do regret that the beverage pairing option was not yet available, but that just means I'll have to return in the near future :)Justin described the $95 omakase and $135 omakase as being two different experiences, and not one being more superior than the other. So we opted for one of each and I'd have to agree. We each enjoyed the dungeness crab, which we paired with the prosecco as we were informed that this would have been the beverage selection had the pairing been available. We then shared the toro tartar & caviar with toast and the tuna salad with ginger soy.  Both were delicious and the toro tartar was just as delightful as it did at Masa. When you described the big piece of tuna that arrived just the day before and said that you ""follow the tuna""... from Spain this week to Montauk next week, it made me giggle thinking about what goes into ""neta,"" the fresh ingredients of sushi. (Ok, so I've recently been playing a lot of DrawSomething and I might have been envisioning a childish drawing of a boat chasing after tuna all around the globe.)The Boston scallop with San Diego uni was fabulous. I had tried something very similar the night before at La Mar so I can't help but compare. Perhaps it's the intimate space that allows us to witness your quality control and high standards and expectations. I think the care you put into your restaurant comes through in all your dishes. And the fried blowfish, another delight from Masa that we thoroughly enjoyed, left us feeling very giddy while we sipped on Densho Yamahai and waited for our segue into sushi with the seasonal rice.One can probably describe what you do using various analogies. For me last night, the freshness of your sushi made you my food therapist. The toro, the salmon, the Long Island fluke, the grilled toro sinew, the uni... all made me feel like... well, like I had gone to the gym, gotten a massage, had a juice cleanse, soaked in the sun, gotten a mani/pedi, AND went shopping!

1.0,3/15/2012,"The chefs, we're told, were head chefs at Masa (nyc's most expensive, most highly regarded Japanese restaurant) and Bar Masa, Masa's more casual outlet. That's hard to believe. While the fish and rice used at Neta are top notch, the preparation is mostly lousy. For example, during dinner we were served two sets of nigiri sushi. The first piece was promising - hamachi that was well sauced, with just the right amount of wasabi. The second, hirame I think, was also ok, although by then I sensed the rice was too sweet and lacking in acidity. The third piece - toro (seemed like chu-toro)... aaaaaargh... gummy, sweet, clumpy rice, disgusting. Then a second set - salmon, uni, kanpachi and I forget what else - but here's a surprise - the pieces were not sauced and had no wasabi (nor was there wasabi offered). Did they forget? did they run out?Rolls were of similar quality to any neighborhood sushi, wet nori, pedestrian unagi. Seasonal specialty rice with baby ice fish has the most measly amount of ice fish I've ever seen served. Again a shame because the rice itself was obviously very good. Non sushi items were of mixed quality (fugu karaage was excellent), tiny, and not beautifully presented. The wine and sake list is okay, but everything is marked up at least to three times its price.A table next to us was sitting and waiting for 90 minutes and got little food, they cancelled the rest of their order and left. Another table wanted to do the same but was persuaded to stay (I'm sure they regretted it as they then had to spend some 30 minutes correcting various errors, all against them, in the check)The only Japanese thing about this place is a charming waiter called Justin (who isn't  Japanese but behaves like he is). The rest... I wish them all the best.",1,0,1,Joe D.,"New York, NY",0,5,0
