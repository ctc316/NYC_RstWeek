2.0,12/24/2018,"My wife and I went to enjoy a ""French American"" dining experience while in New York City at the Triomphe ..From what we read in the menu, it sounded like it would be a great meal.  The head chef is dedicated to a sustainable and healthy ingredient list, which clicked with us.. We were, however, in for a disappointment.First, we asked for a bottle of Cristal (2007).  It was served lukewarm, and was never placed next to the table as in most restaurants.For our first dish, were a dozen oysters.. pre-garnished with chives and horseradish.  Although the flavor of the mix was nice, it would have been nice to have the choice of the garnish left up to me.Next we were presented with a Lobster bisque and a kale salad.  We requested no pork on our food, and the waiter had confirmed that the kale salad had bacon, but they would prepare it without.When my wife tasted it, she realized that it tasted just like bacon.  I took a bite, and sure enough, bacon flavor persisted on the salad.  I gave my wife the lobster bisque (which turned out to be more like a brown lobster gravy) and asked the waiter about the bacon situation.  He went to the kitchen and returned with an arugula salad saying that ""he didn't want any problems"" so he replaced our order.   This to me indicated that the kitchen had just picked out the bacon from a pre-made kale salad.Next up was a lobster for my wife and a Beef Wellington for myself.  The lobster served was straight out of the 90's, mixed with mushrooms and butter.  We missed a creative aspect to the dish from a chef described as having a great passion for food.My dish, the Beef Wellington, was a good attempt, but the pastry was a bit over done.  The beef was cooked perfectly, and raised the level of the dinner for me.  However, it would have been nice to see a better attempt at the garnish than a stewed Brussels sprout and the sliced carrot.We tried to save the night with a Baked Alaska.  Unfortunately the ice cream was rock hard, and the flambé ignited the physalis which was adjacent to it.  The lemon pound cake actually had a flavor of fish, and after my wife dropped off after the first bite, I couldn't finish a third.The chef, to his credit, came out before and after our meal, and asked how we were enjoying things.  At least he cared to find this out.  I would strongly suggest rethin the staffing choices he made, and I would wish for a great improvement to the kitchen.  If this were to happen, we would definitely give it a second chance.(Note, this would have been a 1 star review if not for the friendliness of the executive chef.)Edit after management response:  Of course it was the customer's fault for not complaining when 30% through the meal.  One could mistake this for a veiled attempt to redirect the bad experience back on the customer.   We gave the meal a real chance, without basing our review on corrective actions made by management.  We prefer to see how the staff acts without having to be coached real-time.",0,0,0,G O.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",21,11,61

Menu looks pretty ""average"" breakfast fare (omelettes, oatmeal, French toast), but they take ""typical breakfast fare"" and really elevate it! Lovely food, and the service was INCREDIBLE! Price very reasonable, and felt like I was being waited on by every staff member which felt very luxurious. My favorite part? The dining room. Beautifully lit and classic, and on top of that it was a very pleasant, quiet escape from the hustle and bustle of the area.

2.0,4/7/2018,"A bit of a disappointment. An uneven meal from drinks to dessert. The room has nice ambiance with low lighting and a couple of nice pieces of art- you feel like you are in a high end restaurant, but that's where the similarities end. Staff ok but no explanation of courses and not a lot of polish. They ran out of a couple things by 6:00 which I thought was odd..the wine I selected and the quail were not on hand. My Mom had the beef Wellington which was flavorless and over cooked- she did ask for Well done..so could be her request. I had lobster dumplings which were excellent with lots of lemon and the duck orange, which was over cooked as well (not by request). Dessert of profiteroles were on the dry side- usually a lot more chocolate ganache. Not worth the price in my mind.",0,0,0,Danielle K.,"Garden City, NY",1,62,119

We did dinner before a show and were able to get out with time to get to the show. I had the lobster dumplings and duck for dinner. My wife had the French onion soup and short ribs for dinner. The French onion soup was thick and not too many onions but she enjoyed it. I enjoyed the lobster dumplings but the duck was just average. We had a bottle of wine that was priced average for NYC restaurant. They had a Dover sole on the menu that was priced at 58 dollars. That seemed way too much for fish.

1.0,2/2/2018,"I came here for restaurant week on a double date and was greeted at the door by the hostess, she was very nice.  She politely asked if we wanted our coat checked, I kindly declined and then she said it's mandatory because it was their restaurant policy so their servers don't trip.  Okay, that makes sense.  But don't ask and make it sound optional then.  That definitely made it an awkward start being here. For restaurant week, there was a choice of one appetizer,  lunch, and dessert.  The menu was a bit confusing for the baked alaska thinking it was 2 people per baked alaska.  So we ordered 2 baked alaska to share for 4 people.  The waiter was confusing and didn't bother put forth additional effort in telling us we were forgoing 2 desserts that should be included in our lunch.  During the duration of the lunch, never did he check up on us asking us how our meal was nor did he refill on water.   The escargot was sub par and had little taste.  The short rib was flavorful and tender, but lacking the wow factor.  The desserts were good.  The highlight of desserts would definitely be the baked alaska. However, I didn't like that the server brought it out and didn't give us an opportunity to take pictures before he poured the flaming brandy on.  On top of the bad service there was an auto gratuity of 18%, I don't mind tipping 18-20% for good/great service.  The service was practically non existent.  I would not come back here ever again even if it were free, it honestly felt like a waste of time and was not filling.  After eating ""lunch"" here, my party of 4 people were still hungry and we all were very disappointed with the service.",0,0,1,Stephen L.,"New York, NY",309,372,5722

4.0,12/4/2017,"Friday evening, I already was in the city, so my wife took the LIRR into town to meet me for dinner.  We decided to go to Triomphe, a French bistro at 49 W. 44thSt. (Iroquois Hotel) that I'd passed by many times over the past decade and a half (it's on a great block for good restaurants and bars), but never had tried.  I'm glad we did.   It's relatively small (about 16 tables between the bar area and the main room), white tablecloths but not stuffy, and the decibel level encourages easy conversation.      My wife wanted a white wine with our fish meals, so we ordered a 2015 Cakebread Chardonnay (under $100) from their very nice (and fairly-priced) wine list.  I was pleased that the wine was not served ice cold, because when served somewhere between cellar temperature and room temperature, you can better taste the full flavor of the white wine (although I do confess to preferring certain whites colder).   She started with a delicious mesclun beets salad, followed by perfectly seared yellowfin tuna with farro, leek, and saffron sauce, while I had savory grilled octopus complemented by a scoop of quinoa salad, followed by well-presented and prepared Barramundi in a crab meat beurre blanc with purple mashed potatoes and green beans. Even the bread offerings, with truffle butter, were very good (I had a friend decades ago who maintained that the quality of the bread usually indicates the quality of the meal to follow; she usually was right).  Prices were appropriate for the level of quality (appetizers $15 - 20; main courses $35 - 60).  They also offer a tasting menu with optional wine pairing at generally comparable pricing.   After I'd asked for the check, the waiter brought a complimentary dessert (pear tart with vanilla ice cream and swirled sauces) on a plate inscribed in chocolate, ""Happy Birthday.""  I thanked him but told him that there must have been some mistake, as both of our birthdays are several months off.  He said it was compliments of the house, and we managed to polish off this nice (albeit untimely) punctuation to a very good meal.

5.0,10/12/2017,"I was really looking forward to having a meal at Triomphe (French for Triumph) and I was not disappointed. True to its name it really does represent a triumph within the realm of classic culinary arts. As I had already over stuffed my face on hors d'oeurvres at one of those fancy Manhattan cocktail parties, I merely went for Triomphe's main course of Dover Sole Veronique, being a dish with which I am rather well acquainted. It's also a dish that was at one time very popular amongst finer restaurants but has for some reason been dropped from most menus. Mine came in a most eye appealing presentation with the grape (I think Muscat) the perfectly complimenting a smooth rich buttery lemon sauce with, but I may be mistaken on this, hints of tarragon. Whatever, to me the best Veronique style dish I've ever had and even at $58.00, I would consider it well worth it.",7,1,4,Marqus R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1552,3745,17344
2.0,8/9/2017,"Went for the RW week deal, and I know most of the time you won't truly see a restaurant shine during this time, but my friend and I gave it a shot anyway. Menu was decent, portions were good, but nothing amazed us food wise. Most of the cons comes from just basic service and cleanliness. -I had asked for hot water, my teacup came with a leftover lipstick stain-Our wine glasses were NOT clean, fingerprints all over, lipstick stains-Our wine was not poured properly, nor was the bottle left with us-The waiter cleared my friend's glass before we had even finished the bottle, which probably happened because they didnt leave the bottle with us-When a new glass was given to him, my friend (who is an experienced wine drinker) noticed an odd smell coming from the glass and requested a new one. waiter then grabbed a glass from the table next to us, smelled it, and handed it to my friend. it still wasnt really clean either, but i think we just gave up with the glasses at this point-20% already added tip to the bill, which im assuming is because of the RW deal. A little irked, mainly because the service clearly wasn't great but we still gave the 20% tip anyway.  Wouldn't recommend anyone going for RW, and after the service, I don't think I'll be returning.",1,0,0,Jamie S.,"Long Island City, NY",353,2,2
4.0,7/11/2017,"Great restaurant, if admittedly expensive. I had the Sole, which was amazingly prepared. Served with green grapes, paired very well. My wife had the duck breast, which she loved. The rest of my party had beef wellington, which they really enjoyed. The oysters were good, but prepared with a lot of horseradish, so beware. The octopus was done very well. The desserts were good (Baked alaska was probably the best of the ones we got), not great, But the rest of the meal was so good we didn't care.

I haven't been in the city for over two years, but Triomphe has changed completely. Still the same small charming dining room, but the food...terrible. One in my party had dietary restrictions.  No problem, said the server. No problem because he completely ignored her requests. The fennel salad had no flavor at all. The ribeye was fatty, thin, tough and bland. The duck, flavorless and cold. Cappuccino after dinner?  Sorry the machine is broken.

3.0,1/31/2017,"*Restaurant Week Review*We came here at 9:45 pm on a weekday, and this tiny place was surprisingly packed. For starters, we were provided with complimentary French baguette and truffle butter, which was super rich and buttery (well, d'oh). For someone that's never had truffle butter before, I was blown away by how tasty it was. There were also some herbs bordering the truffle butter which gave it a nice taste. For appetizer, I ordered the Cauliflower Soup, which was just as creamy and tasty as I'd imagined it to be (not to mention super filling). For my main dish, I ordered the Roasted Chicken Ballotine. The chicken was very tender and soft, with a tasty middle (not sure what it was- but it was delish!) The chicken was surrounded by blue potato mousseline, (which just tasted like normal mashed potatoes), and an assortment of roasted vegetables including broccoli rabe, roasted brussel sprouts, carrots, and you guessed it...cauliflower! All of this was surrounded by a nice, tasty gravy. Overall, I enjoyed my chicken but there was no ""wow factor.""For dessert, I got the Flambèed Baked Alaska (extra $5), which was as aesthetically pleasing as it was tasting as long as you don't eat the outside, which tastes like strong alcohol presumably from the flames. Inside was three layers of ice cream: vanilla, strawberry, and chocolate. This dessert is definitely for at least two people since all of my friends had to help me finish it. Overall the food was good, the ambience was good, and the service was great, but there was nothing that amazing (unless you count the truffle butter). Perhaps their normal menu is better.",1,1,1,Dinisha G.,"Livingston, NJ",324,32,32

The Cauliflower soup was good.The Braised Shortribs and Pan Seared Skate was very good.The dessert was the worst. The Flambed Baked Alaska and NY cheesecake had too much brandy and wasn't good.

4.0,1/26/2017,"Definitely a good spot for those who enjoy French cuisine. I went for restaurant week and thought it was worth it.Escargot is a must get. The pesto that they make it in makes it taste absolutely scrumptious. Probably my favorite dish of the entire dining service.Cauliflower soup was also delicious as well, silky smooth as it goes down but escargot definitely first pick. Short-ribs with Risotto and rabid broccoli was also delicious. Short ribs feel a part as a teared into it with my knife with a fried crumbs on top added to the flavor, but was a bit dry. Risotto was a bit more clumpy then I prefer.Cheesecake was topped with fruit. It was slightly sour from fruit to my liking but was still enjoyable.Apple Tartin was really impressive, the soft fluffy crust with light whip caramel. Baked Alaska was a must see but if not an alcohol fan don't eat the outside, very deep intense alcohol flavor. The inside tho is very good with a variety of flavors that include cake, ice cream, and pound cake mixed together. Service was exception, water cup was never empty and when close was always filled.

There we were, 7 hungry folks showing up late without reservations, coming from a nearby fashion show. Staff with a 100 watt smile and hybrid efficiency,  got a table ready for us in a flash. Plus, closed the front door entrance so that we won't get the chilly drafts from doors opening & have guests use the hotel entrance instead. How's that for top notch service? Wine recommended was on point. Food was delish and servings were more than enough to fill you up. Oh, did I also mention the chef came to check on us too? Make sure all was satisfied.

5.0,10/19/2016,"It's taken me a while to get to writing this review because I really never do. That said, the single greatest dining experience I've ever had was produced by a man named Florian at Triomphe in the Iroquois. No all of us order appetizers so when a man starting plating small tiles with bites of food on them I said, ""hold on, I don't think we ordered that."" And he replied, ""It's compliments of the chef,"" straight out a movie. I was already enamored with the gestured, but the beef tenderloin on a crustini with some herbs picked from the rooftop garden left me further smitten. A perfect bite, of earthy, savory kindness. It was amazing.I ordered the beef wellington with the winter vegetables and Fois gras. The meal was beautiful it all worked together in an amazing way. The tenderloin was tender and the pastry was light and soft and magic. The food was probably the best I've had in my life, but it was trumped by the atmosphere of the place. Triomphe has a classic sort of upscale look to it. And physically for me it is somewhat intimidating, but what made it so nice was the warmth and kindness of the staff. They were accommodating and truly helpful. This incredible atmosphere was captained by the Head chef, Chef Florian who came out more than once to chat with us. He gave us some of the history of the food we were eating and when he even told us about himself. He really was an inspiring man to talk to and I won't give the details of the things he told us because the moment was so honest and kind it'd be wrong to try to represent the conversation here, but suffice to say he was amazing.

We had reservations for restaurant week but the place wasn't too busy so it was fine.Started off with Escargot and it was so good. It was $5 extra but if you like it or want to try it, it's worth it. I got the Amish Chicken and this was really good too. Juicy and tasty.I tried a piece of my friends Duck Leg and it was surprisingly really good. Duck tends to be a bit dry but it was tender and juicy. However, the portion was pretty small for the duck. White chocolate profiterole was okay. Basically two cream puffs with chocolate over it. I had some of the strawberry soup and if you're a fan of strawberry you'll like it. It's like a strawberry Puree soup with a small sorbet in the middle. Can't go wrong. Downsides: We had to wait quite a bit for our entrees and they got one of our orders wrong.

Off the restaurant week menu we ordered:Appetizer: Foie gras with sunchoke mousse and escargot. I did not like the foie gras mousse it was too sweet for my taste. It just weird not like the ones I'm use to eating. However, the escargot was delicious. Probably the only item I enjoy out of the whole meal. Both ordered the short ribs for main entree: my friend and I both ordered the same exact main entree but when it was delivered to the table there was a huge difference in portion sizes. I understand not every piece of meat is the same size but it should at least be consistent if the same entree is served at the same table. My friend's short rib was double my size.

4.0,2/4/2016,"This was a special date night with the lady during restaurant week.  When we got there we were seated right away and the place is small, but the ambiance is really nice!  It felt like a small hotel restaurant, which it is, but I think that only added to the overall atmosphere.  I tend to like smaller restaurants so long as their not overly crowded.  I gave this place 4 stars mostly because the service was outstanding.  We ordered a bottle of wine and our glasses were never empty.  All our courses came out promptly and wanted for nothing.  The manager even came over and asked how we were once or twice while filling our wine glasses.  A+ service.  The food is great although I felt it could have been a bit better.  I started with the escargot, which is one of my favorite dishes.  It didn't disappoint but may I recommend soft bread to soak up all that amazing butter, oil and garlic?  The baguette croutons were delicious on their own but made it difficult to get to my favorite part of the dish.  My girlfriend had the risotto which was great, but didn't have the consistency of a normal risotto.  It was mostly just really tasty rice.  I had the chicken dish which also had good flavor but was kind of dry.  The baked Alaska desert, while the presentation is always fun, left a bit to be desired.",2,0,2,Christopher C.,"Seaford, NY",108,62,2

For starters, we had the Creamy Celery Root Soup and Traditional Escargot. The soup was rich and well-balanced, but the escargot stole the show. Tender and drenched in hazelnut garlic butter, the escargot was probably the best dish we had. For our main courses, we had the Roasted Chicken Ballotine and Pan Seared Hake. Both were solid, but didn't quite hit the mark of a great dish.Dessert: The assorted creme brulee was pretty good.

The dining room is warm and comfortable. So, we shared a poached egg with truffles over navy beans for an appetizer. Poached eggs are delicious, of course, and they were not stingy on the truffles! So, this started well. The problem came with the not particularly creative main dishes. I had the Lamb with potato roesti and my wife had the poached salmon that came in a parchment bag. The lamb was about room temperature--cooked properly, but nothing special. The sauce was fine but the dish could've used more. The potato roesti was warm in spots and luke warm and stiff in others. It was bland and there was no sauce for it. I left wondering whether the plate had sat for a while. The salmon was good--a nice and substantial piece of fish. But, again, not particularly impressive.

For the appetizer, the bison carpaccio was nicely display like a flower and tasted pretty good with the rock salt on it. The escargot was mediocre; it was already taken out of the shells. As for the entree, the petite tenderloin rossini was terrible. My friend had ordered it medium rare but it came out to be almost well done. It was also really really really dry. As for the rainbow trout, it was wrapped in ratatouille rather than stuffed. The worst part was that my trout still had bones in it. It was a total disappointment!! I kept on telling my friend what if I had choke on it and died.(Not really, but still.. Why is there bones in the filet part? Shouldn't it just be meat) =( Finally, in hope for the wonderful dessert.

3.0,5/27/2015,"A self proclaimed ""fine dining restaurant,"" Triomphe restaurant hits on all the worst cliches confusing dim lighting for intimate, simpering for thoughtful service and pretentious plating for imagination. My seared fois gras starter ($24) - a small, thin sliver draped limply over a meticulously cut log of brioche - finished slightly oily but tasted pleasantly enough of smoke and fat. A few pea shoots rested on top the composed stack, placed on there presumably to give the dish a bit of forced whimsy. The jumbo scallops ($17) were good with both nice caramelization and sear but sat annoyingly a top two superfluous sweet potato coins that, while didn't take away from the dish, certainly didn't add which makes you wonder - what's the point in even having it on the plate in the first place?My beef wellington ($41) was nicely pink in the middle but instead of being enveloped by fluffy puff pastry, it was wrapped in a delicate crackly phyllo dough - too thin to stand up to the heat in the oven. As a result, while the meat was passably juicy, the duxelle/fois gras layer lacked that rich and unctuous quality so key to a great beef wellington.

It's like being invited to a private dinner at a NYC townhouse with Downton Abbey-style service. We ordered a la carte and the menu suited the fall-winter seasonal favorites. Kale salad with caramelized quince was luscious, with a vinaigrette that perfectly married the sweet and bitter. Pumpkin-crusted tuna done rare melted in my mouth. The Forbidden Black Rice croquette was a really good accompaniment, as was the squash. Sounds unusual to pair with fish, but it wasn't. And for dessert I tried the red wine-infused seckel pears with cinnamon mousse. Nice light ending to a delicious meal, and in and out in 90 minutes without feeling rushed for the short walk to our show. Slight downsides: tables are close (there aren't many), but you need assistance to get in and out. Our server should have been more attuned to when we were ready to leave, but we had to ask for help; dessert was a tad too sweet for my palette, although the cinnamon crunch topping gave a welcome textural element. My husband loved the mushroom-squash Harlequin Soup. I never heard him praise a soup before, ever. He tried the Beef Wellington and ended with the flourless Chocolate Cake, with too little ice cream, he mentioned. Needed more ice cream to soften the rich taste of the deep chocolate.

Well, listen and learn how they rip you off on that.The food was OK, in terms of variety, but it was overly salty, a quick sign of mediocrity, slightly overcooked, or precooked an hour ago, and then rewarmed, and the wine was served in dribs and drabs, in quarter, not half glasses. For this price you had to show up at 8:00 or later, so I wonder how long some of the dishes had been sitting in the warmer.When the bill came, there was a 20% tip on the $240 ""rack rate"" price, in other words, a tip of $48. It was already printed on the bill. That's crooked, in my book. Firstly, I wonder if the servers get that money, or the smiling F&B manager who tried to make us smile.This was the first time in a US restaurant where the tip, for two people, had already been calculated, giving the appearance of ""compulsory.""

4.0,3/3/2014,"Pleasant surprise.Whenever I hear the words theater district associated with dinner, I tense up and my throat closes up like I'm going through anaphylactic shock.  There are so few places I would even venture to for dinner in this area.  In my opinion, it's the tourist trap district.  Much is overpriced and catered to the convenient cache of hungry theater-goers.  However, Triomphe was indeed, a nice gem.A sweet gentleman brought me here; it was one of the best restaurant selections for a first date.  It is located within the Iroquois hotel, and is not to be confused with the bar, Lantern's Keep, which is the darker and louder venue within the hotel.  Triomphe doesn't hold many tables, and is a great place for starting and maintaining a conversation.   On that particular Saturday night, the restaurant had already cleared out around 9pm.  We were able to have an intimate dinner and then enjoy having the place to ourselves the rest of the time.As for the food, I did want to try the tasting menu that some reviewers mentioned, but we opted for a shared appetizer, two entrees and two desserts.  On our table was the Hazelnut crusted sea scallops (spaghetti squash, blood orange beurre blanc), the Seared arctic char (meyer lemon reduction, wilted winter greens, garlic confit) & the Monk fish osso bucco (green lentils, thumbelina carrots, pinot noir sauce).  For dessert: Milk chocolate croissant bread pudding (caramel toffee gelato, crème anglaise) & Gingerbread crème brûlée (orange-ginger biscotti).The scallops were cooked perfectly, though I really didn't care for the spaghetti squash.  It tasted a bit awkward, and I tend to like my squash in the form of soup, puree, or roasted- pretty much any other preparation instead of shredded.The seared artic char that was my entree was beautifully plated (see photo).  However, after cutting through, I immediately spotted pink, and as I progressed, the pink quickly turned into under-cooked.  I returned the dish, and the chef re-seared and re-plated it; it looked like a completely different dish.  I was thoroughly impressed by the effort, and the fish was delicious.  I feel as if the chef's one weakness lies in his vegetable sides: a bit bland for my buds.I tried some of my date's bread pudding; I don't lean towards bread pudding, but I enjoyed it.  I don't recommend the crème brûlée as I didn't like the gingerbread flavor.  If you don't like gingerbread, I'd suggest you not order this either.  Also, the biscotti didn't really add anything innovative or complementary to the dessert.Beyond the food, the service was pretty impeccable.  They knew when to approach the table, and when to leave us to our conversation.  Not once did we feel rushed, and I found the hostess to be especially well-mannered and welcoming.  I had also left my ring in the women's restroom, definitely not the first time since early-onset dementia seems to be my new thing, and the staff had collected it and set it aside for me.Although my date went successfully, him being the perfect gentleman, both attentive and engaging, there won't be a second date.  But it was a great experience for any lady to have.",8,4,5,Jenn F.,"Brooklyn, NY",767,372,2548
1.0,2/23/2014,"I took my gf here for dinner on Valentine's Day before heading over to see a Broadway show. Unfortunately, dinner at Triomphe was such a negative experience that it put a damper on the evening even though the show was great. In isolation, none of these incidents would specifically put me off much, but in combination -- especially when spending nearly $350 on the meal -- it's extremely aggravating. Due to the crescendoing nature of our displeasure along with a hard time limitation, we didn't complain to the manager. First off, we were seated in the main dining area in the back section of the restaurant reserved for diners partaking in the vday menu. The room: circular with tables hugging the walls and a section in the middle. Our table was of course the shittiest table in the restaurant being right in front of the kitchen doors. It was 6:15pm (theater crowd) and only 30% full. My girlfriend takes notice of the location and the vacancy and asked whether we could switch to another table, maybe on the outside if possible, prior to getting settled. Our hostess hesitates momentarily and then shuts us down saying ""no, all these tables are reserved, we're going to be very busy tonight for vday."" Fair enough. We enjoy our drinks and dinner and notice periodically that there are still vacant tables on the outside up until we leave. Perhaps, there were cancellations. Not a big deal. The next strike was when the bill was delivered. There was 20% gratuity added. Now, I'm perplexed: When I go out on vday is gratuity always automatically added? Is this a common thing? I can't remember! O man, 20 min before show time, let's get coats on. Either way, I was going to tip 20% as the wait staff service was adequate -- did I mention my father is a waiter, and I was raised on tip $? O yea, my gf was a waiter for years, too. Now I'm annoyed. The final straw. In a nice touch, the restaurant was giving away a complementary rose as you left the restaurant that night. As we were passing the hostess's area, we notice the roses and see one being given to another couple on their way out after putting on their coats. We already have our coats and get the customary thank you and goodbye but no rose. I walk over point to a rose, ask if they're complementary, and grab one before I even get the response because I wasn't really asking, nah meen? I'm buzzing now cause this was the third slight of the evening and dammit my gf deserves a rose! I don't know what the heck was going on that night. My best guess is that because we're youthful looking 30 yr olds we got typecasted. The average customer demo here is much older. However, we were dressed for the theater (dress, sportcoat) minus my snowboots -- lay off we got about 12 in. of snow that week!In summary, we're pretty experienced diners and this was a very poor service experience.

1.0,12/29/2013,"I came here for a nice dinner with family and left wildly unimpressed, both in service and in food.I began my meal by inquiring with the waitress as to exactly where the ""East Coast oysters"" were from in their fist course. Instead of getting ""Blue Point,"" or ""Malpeque,"" etc.., I instead was told that they were from the East Coast. This did not bode well as to her knowledge of the menu. After some prodding, she offered in seemingly the most unassured means that they might be from the waters of Massachusetts. Against my better judgement, I ordered them, and was disappointed to receive oysters topped so heavily with horseradish, that I could not taste the oysters themselves. Even removing the large lump of horseradish from the oyster did little to subdue its fiery punch. Alas, after much water, my first course was over. My second course was that of beef tenderloin stuffed with blue cheese with small roasted potatoes and topped with an onion marmalade and mustard jus. This dish alright. The steak was cooked to order and quite tender and the blue cheese added a nice, creamy harmony to steak, as one would hope in the classic pairing of steak and blue cheese. Unfortunately the onion marmalade was far too sweet and was a distraction to the steak and the mustard jus was seemingly nothing more than mustard seed atop the steak. The potatoes, which i hoped to be transformed into something, were instead nothing but a few tiny roasted potatoes rolling across my plate. The final course was dessert, to which i ordered the gingerbread creme brûlée. This I hoped was simple enough that it could not be messed up, even if it lacked much classic gingerbread flavor at all. Instead, I was served a ramekin full of clotted, separated cream, indicative of it being over-cooked. I could't even get through one bite. I asked the staff as to what happened and received a rather worrisome response.The waitress said that the kitchen was without a blowtorch to brûlée the top as is traditional and instead threw it into the oven to caramelize the top, while this succeeded in caramelizing the top, it recooked the dish and caused it to clot and separate. What was most disturbing was not that the dish was inedible, but that the kitchen felt it worthwhile trying to pass off a dish they tried to fake and cover up instead of removing the item from the menu. I would be far more understanding had the waitress informed me that my choice was unavailable and I would have to choose something else than try and be tricked into eating a dish that should never have been served in the first place.While the decor of the restaurant was beautiful, the service and food left pretty much everything to be desired.

2.0,2/13/2013,"Food was subpar. Service was excellent. Starter was foie gras and my friend had a salad. The foie gras was bad.  It wasn't the melt in your mouth deliciousness I was expecting.  I actually chewed my foie gras, that is a first.  My friend's salad was bland and barely touched. Main meal was the squid linguine. My friend had the omelet. My linguine was undercooked. How do you mess up pasta?  Seriously!  The seafood items in my linguine were semi fresh (lobster and shrimp were fresh, the mussels have seen better days). My friends omelet was ok.We had the parmesan risotto as a side.  Disappointing would be an understatement. First off, it looked like they used regular rice, not arborio rice.  Next, they added peas and carrots. Wtf?When I order parm risotto I expect arborio rice with a creamy Parmesan sauce and possibly some mushrooms. Not rice with Parmesan cheese and frozen veggies. (sidenote: our waitress was brand new and didn't know the menu. When I asked her ""what's good?"" she actually called over another waiter. After that, I didn't ask for food recs or how food is prepared. however, as stated earlier service was excellent). Overall, I won't be coming back. Also, FYI, it's attached to a hotel.

4.0,11/25/2012,"Armin L. and I took my mom here after seeing Phantom for her birthday dinner. This restaurant is attached to the Iroquois hotel (which is where the bathroom is located..complete with Molton Brown products and floral arrangements).The place is very small with the bar and other seating areas separated from a seating area in the back which results in a quieter atmosphere. The front desk woman was OK nothing spectacular or welcoming and while the waiter was nice enough, he wasn't very clear in his explanations of the days specials. Also, throughout the entire meal the hostess and waiter kept hitting my chair as the traveled around the room and towards the kitchen. (Spacing is a little narrow).What made up for it was the food itself (except for the initial pumpkin bread that was served before our appetizers..I found that to be too sweet and dense and an inappropriate choice for an opening as this could easily ruin someones appetite which would be a shame because this place is too expensive to not finish your meal).Armin and I shared a scallop appetizer and my mom had the butternut squash soup. The soup came with chopped butternut squash and apples that the server then covered with a bisque which my mom thoroughly enjoyed. When Armin said we would split the scallops they actually brought out two plates each with half of the appetizer on it which I thought was very thoughtful and took the work out of sharing equally. The scallops were really amazing and had a mushroom based sauce that was savory and creamy.I ordered the bass, Armin had the rack of lamb and my mom had the sole. The bass came with halved brussel sprouts and butternut squash sitting underneath a generous piece of bass with a tomato caper sauce on the top. It was really great which was good considering I don't normally order fish. It tasted very fresh and all of the tastes worked well together.The best part was the dessert which was a chocolate croissant bread pudding that came with a scoop of coffee gelato and some creme. It was again very rich and for the first time in my adult life I could only eat half of a dessert that I was madly in love with. Luckily Armin L. ate the other half so I don't have to picture the other half in my head, full of longing and regret.The vibe in here was very relaxed and even with a large party near us, it didn't get too loud or overbearing in this relatively small seating space. The only thing we found weird was the obvious cameras (TWO!) that were in such a small space in the restaurant. That definitely took away from the otherwise very tasteful decor.",2,2,2,Samantha S.,"Brooklyn, NY",125,377,44

I would give this place five stars if there was a seasonal if not staple prix-fixe menu. Located near the theater district, and with heavy foot traffic especially of tourists, I am sure they would see more business. i would recommend to start with the scallops.

Ambiance is more easy going and less formal that other NYC upscale restaurants. We especially liked the unique presentation. It's so BORING when the chef plops down the meat on a pile of whipped potatoes and dumps gravy around it. Yawn! I like a little more drama...unexpected.

It's a bit of a small restaurant, so it's nice and cozy if you're sitting in the front or in the larger dining area in the back. You can leave your bag with the hostess, and the service overall was decent. I agree with Lisa M. further down - you have to get the server's attention to have them bring the check over, even if everyone has been done eating for quite some time.As for the food itself - it's good, but in my opinion it was rather unremarkable given the price. The lamb patties were delicious; there must be some herbs that are mixed in prior to cooking that adds a good amount of flavor to the meat. The sauce itself was a bit lacking, though, and there definitely could have been a little more goat cheese included - that made a very fine complement in flavors to the meat. I probably should have ordered a less generic entree, but as I didn't feel like thinking too much, I simply got the grilled salmon. I was a bit surprised when I got a smaller-than-expected filet, in the same sauce (or very similar sauce) that the patties were served with, and only a few asparagus shoots and a slice of potato...for $31. I would call it above-average, but certainly not based on the price or the quantity of food that was served.I might come back here again on business, but it's certainly not something I'd try again casually unless something on the menu caught my eye.

1.0,1/13/2010,"Lunch at Triomphe was anything but...I'm not one of those people who looks for reasons not to like a restaurant, and in fact I walked into Triomphe quite excited for the meal. But, in the end, Triomphe committed several mortal sins of the restaurant world, and anyone thinking of dining here should know they're likely to walk away feeling very disappointed at having wasted both the money and time to eat here.First, the food.We split five small starters between two of us, and with that much variety, I was really saddened to find that not a single one rose above the level of ""mweh.""1) Foie gras with pear and chestnut jam - the foie had a stale taste, but it was hard to tell because it was so badly overpowered by the raw sweetness of the chestnut jam.2) Salad with beets - highlight of this salad was that they roasted the nuts on it; they were nice and crispy... the rest of the dish was a monotextural morass of overdressed greens, beets and cheese.3) Squash soup - bland and tasteless, woefully underseasoned, and with white bread croutons/crumbs on top.4) Lamb merguez - the best of a bad lot, I suppose... nothing really wrong with it (save it was a bit greasy, with oil slicks floating in the bowl) but nothing really good about it either. The lamb sausage was dry (which sucks even more when it's in an oversoupy bean preparation).5) Daily omelet - mushroom and cheese... looking like it belonged on a Denny's rather than a ""fine dining"" plate. Oversalted, and flat as hell... they didn't even bother to beat the eggs lightly to get a nice fluffy omelet... it was simply fail.So, food wise, I would have given it about 2.5 stars... but this place is PRICY! We looked at Daniel Bouloud's restaurant right next door on the way out and realized we could have had a much better meal for less money. Hell, we ate at Nougatine last night and the prix fixe lunch there would have been less than Triomphe. So, they lose a star simply for not living up to the cost of the meal.But the capper was that the service simply sucked. Not only that, but the raw indifference shown by the hostess makes me positive that the Triomphe management cares so little about the experience of its guests that this review will never be read by one of them.Not only did the hostess NEVER come by during the meal to check and see if we were enjoying it, but after we finally asked the busboy for the check and indicated that the uneaten omelet was inedible, when she came over she immediate was confrontational and rude about it, somehow blaming us for not having tracked her down to tell her there was a problem. Her ""fine, I'll take it off your bill"" (which we didn't ask for) was not a substitute for simply being polite, attentive and acting like she gave a damn whether we were enjoying a very expensive meal.In short, mediocre overpriced food with asshatt-ish service? In New York City? Yeah, good luck with that. We'll be skipping Triomphe from this point forward. If I wanted to be treated and fed like it was a Denny's, I'd simply go there.",1,0,1,Jim C.,"San Francisco, CA",39,72,3
2.0,12/26/2009,"Beware ""The Little Triomphe!""I've been to Le Triomphe twice.  The first time was a 3-4 star experience -- a quiet French restaurant with fine food in a nice environment.  A bit pricey, but hey, it's mid-town.My second experience was a few weeks back and it was a disaster.  When my associate called to reserve the table for another quiet business dinner, they reserved a table for us smoothly and didn't mention anything to change our expectations.When we arrived, however, the restaurant was basically *closed* for a private holiday party and we were seated in what I call a ""conference room"" and what they called ""Le Petit Triomphe.""  Adding insult to injury the ""little Triomphe"" had one huge table in the middle with small tables scattered around the outside and the huge table was -- guess what -- another Christmas party.  And a loud one.So what was a nice, quiet high-end environment on my first visit was a noisy, low-end conference room on my second -- and they never warned us they were going to do this bait-and-switch, despite having talked to us live on the phone.  KIND OF A BIG DETAIL TO OMIT.  ""Oh, you're not in the actual restaurant, but a little overflow crap room on the side, and by the way, that will be jammed with a noisy holiday party."" It was bad enough that we sent one of our team members out, on foot, to find an alternative.  We had to apologize to our customer for the situation, and then we walked down the street to the restaurant in the Sofitel, Gaby, which was quiet, efficient, good, and about half the price of Triomphe.",2,0,1,Dave K.,"Silicon Valley, CA",127,536,77
4.0,8/29/2009,"I don't normally do waiter service types of places for lunch on workdays just because of the time constraints, but sometimes (actually all the time), I just get sick of the typical midtown takeout garbage.  I dropped in at Triomphe in hopes that they might make a Monte Cristo.  They did not, but they did make a burger, which I figured would be pretty quick.  It was fairly quick and actually quite good.The burger was slightly thicker than average, but not so thick that it's difficult to eat.  Strangely, it was on an English muffin.  I actually liked that, although I didn't think that I was going to when I first looked at it.  The burger was cooked to a proper medium, as requested.  The best part of it was that the outside had that taste that you usually can only get from cooking a burger on a surface that has cooked many other burgers / steaks.  I was surprised at that.  I think there may have been some sort of drizzle that gave it this effect.  I had them add cheddar and bacon.  Both were high quality as you would expect from a sit-down, French restaurant in midtown.I definitely want to return here when I have time for a real meal, because the mashed potatoes seemed to indicate that these folks know a thing or two about cooking.  They were perfectly whipped with just the right amount of butter.",0,0,0,Scott Y.,"Cedar Rapids, IA",358,472,271
5.0,8/15/2009,"I can only say great things about this place.  The tasting menu with the wine pairing is the best value in NYC.

2.0,12/31/2008,"I realize that this restaurant is in a very pricey part of town, but I was shocked when i received the bill for a lunch for 3 people and included $19 for a glass of wine ordered as ""cabernet"" and the $26 filet mignon sandwich that had $2 worth of meat on it. I may not be part of the Wall Street crowd that would tolerate this, but some value for your dollar would be appreciated. Service was nice but slow.",0,0,0,John B.,"New York, NY",28,6,0

4.0,11/30/2007,"""...chicks hit the floor, die-hard fans demand more..."" I pay respect to good hip hop and there's none better than the Wu Tang Clan.  The above is an excerpt from ""Triumph"" act sophisticated like you know.The food here was marginally above average (blah French bistros et al), but the service was spectacular.  This may have been the result of ten suits in a private room eating dinner, but I like to think the service is like this across the board.  We, suits, were provided options from an abbreviated menu, and many times I like to ask the servers for their opinions about what they would have here. I had narrowed my choices down to a few options, and the red-headed, curly-haired waitress didn't even have to think when I asked for her recommendations.  Filet mignon, and the chocolate explosion cake were her suggestions. Done. I love not having to think.  As per my usual at business dinners, I drank copious amounts of the nectar from the gods (red wine).  I was pleasantly surprised by the grilled shrimp, roasted peanuts, spinach and bacon salad.  I'm assuming this place is pricey, and the food really wasn't spectacular, but when other suits open their checkbook to host a dinner I eat and drink like a moron.  It's rather embarrassing.  The other swine at the table engage in conversation and talk shop. I simply stuff my face with vino and flesh - to which Triomphe more than  wet my appetite.Salad: 4.5 starsFilet Mignon: 3 starsChocolate cake dessert with chocolate gelato: 3.25 starsService: 5 starsDid I eat enough?

3.0,7/27/2007,"Came here for lunch because we wanted to eat somewhere quiet.  Sure enough, only a few tables were occupied.  The waitress was friendly and accomodating when people wanted to tweak some of their dishes.  She also agreed to turn down the air conditioning in the restaurant because the vent blasted right above our table.  For a starter, I got the seared scallops in foie gras butter, which was actually very good.  But everything went downhill from there - The grilled halibut in lemon-and-olive-oil sauce was barely edible - bland, but over peppered at the same time.  It came on a bed of ""jasmine rice"" that had the weirdly rich consistency of risotto.  For dessert, I had the lemon tart which tasted too sugary and left an unpleasant aftertaste.The service was also spotty at times.  There was one waitress attending to the entire dining room.",1,0,1,Lucy Z.,"Jersey City, NJ",43,210,1
4.0,7/16/2007,"The restaurant is very much like the hotel it resides in - understated and top notch. The cuisine is uncomplicated, light French with definite Californian influence. All dishes were excellent.It is important to note that this is not a flashy restaurant - certainly nothing like some French restaurants north of midtown - and the waiters are quiet and somewhat invisible. Although some may interpret this as under-par for the cuisine, it is actually refreshing not to be in the middle of a ""show."" Absolutely fantastic for couples. Reservations are not essential - and there is no need to go ""over the top"" when dressing for this restaurant.",2,0,1,Fred F.,"New York, NY",8,21,0
3.0,4/29/2007,"Triomphe is an average high end French restaurant.  Friendly staff but lacked the professionalism of the top restaurants as service was overall slow and there was some uncomfortable spacing of time between courses.  Some dishes were simply missess.  Overall, the chef I think went too heavy on the sauce.  The price was fairly reasonable.",0,0,1,Laurence H.,"San Francisco, CA",157,595,6
