2.0,1/4/2019,"It didn't live up to anything at all. It was mostly people that weren't NYers (local or not) and for them, it's a fine place to spend 50% too much money. No way the things we had were any sort of revelation of flavors. Crab fried rice - the edge on this was the Japanese mayo and some caviar? Nah, mayo is not edgy unless you put it under a salamander. The mayo just calms it down. Wings - were fine. They are just another flavor of chicken wings. Big friggin deal, amirite? Hong Kong noodles - I know it's not fair to compare it against my local Shun Wang in Elmhurst but dude, this was just a boring version of that. Where is the excess?? Wok charred bok choy. Dude, that's just a normal bok choy. It is the most friggin normal thing. Why are they listing it as 'wok charred'? If it were anything other than charred in a wok THEN you write the method. They are exoticising themselves. It's bok choy not Roy Choi. Bok Choy. The whole thing fells like you are in a city that is not NYC. Idk, I wish them luck but it's boring and expensive. Actually I don't even wish them luck because it's a celebrity restaurant and how can I support a place where the brains is not getting dirty and I will never have a chance to meet?  If you're even confused about authenticity, worry not. Talde is as authentic as it comes. You're eating at the flagship celebrity chef restaurant, hailing from Illinois - it is no more, no less than what you would expect from that. It's not Asian food served with a wink, it's Asian food served with a crutch. This is Asian-American fusion on the weak end of what is American. It uses ""American"" to explain why it has no spark. But that's selling America short. They use the ""American"" as an excuse to say why it sucks. I'm not saying Daniel Talde has to be anything. But the place is weak. If you want some sort of Asian food, go to Sunset Park, Elmhurst, Chinatown, Flushing. If you want a New American place (which is awesome and what fusion actually is), go to Bushwick or Manhattan or Flushing.I'd rather live next to a Guy Fieri's than a Talde'sTalde is the reason I live in Queens. Talde is the first restaurant I've been in where they give you chopsticks as an ornament.",2,1,2,Jeff O.,"Jackson Heights, NY",488,1403,217
4.0,1/3/2019,I can't say  they serve the best wings ever like some other yelpers have said  but they are pretty damn good w/ their homemade ranch . Chicken wings and beer . Who knew ? Apparently a lot of people but me . I'm late to the party but happy that I finally arrived .Had the six piece for twelve dollars with a two hearted iPa and I was in heaven !! Suddenly the beer and peanuts  / beer and chicken wings / beer and greasy Chinese food combo made sense !!!!!  Sweet spicy earthy  with the best  ranch I've ever had and a hoppy bitter refreshing beer that cut through any residual sweetness like a hot knife cutting through cake .If I was rich this is what I would order for  my super bowl party !Rich I'm not so I will keep dreaming and keepin my order to a 12 piece order max which costs $20 pre tax .Maybe even next time I'll try the $18 beef fried rice .,0,0,0,Aerin A.,"Playa del Rey, CA",176,150,89

4.0,12/29/2018,"This place is a little small and a lot cramped on a Saturday night but the service is very friendly so +100000 for your friendly wait staff. We ordered a really old-fashioned and a lychee Collins - both strong flavors, both excellent drinks. Then we split the edamame (fine), kung pao chicken wings (very flavorful and sticky), the crispy oyster and bacon pad thai (oh my gooooood, not spicy and very sweet and textured), and the mala beef (got a kick but not really all that spicy). I personally liked the pad thai the best and the mala was a little disappointing because it wasn't as spicy as I expected it to be with Szechuan peppercorn. But nevertheless, the meal was delicious and thank God for Asian food portions because it was way too much food for two people.I am excited to come back and try other things on the menu!",1,0,0,Kristen L.,"Brooklyn, NY",38,289,87

1.0,10/10/2018,"I heard they were featured on topchef so was expecting some really good food. Unfortunately it was a case of tying too hard to be different, only to land short and very subpar. I can deal with under spiced or unsalted as you can always add more. But overly spicy and salty, you can't do anything about. We ordered crab fried rice & walnut shrimp. Both of which were way too salty... Like i am talking - - - oops I dumped a whole salt can. Plus for a few salty fried shrimp with walnuts and some orange pieces it was whoppin $25. A bit expensive I would say! Thank goodness they were kind enough to take off bill, but if the only good thing u ate is a bowl of instant--like ramen then that's not a good sign.

3.0,9/30/2018,Was just at Talde for 3 hours (it is now 10pm on Sunday night) and not because I am a slow eater! The first two dishes came out at a reasonable pace but then we were left sitting and twiddling our thumbs for over an hour just to get some walnut shrimp. The food was pretty tasty BUT definitely nothing exceptional. I would also advise to skip the Pad Thai as it doesn't measure up to other places in the hood. My favorite part was the shrimp fried rice..YUM. Then again how do you mess fried rice up? haha. Probably won't be back.,1,0,1,Cori C.,"Park Slope, Brooklyn, NY",0,11,2

1.0,9/22/2018,"Two words: REALLY UNDERWHELMING. I very rarely give out 1-star ratings, but this experience really takes the cake. This restaurant is really one that I've been wanting to try for a while (which, I understand, comes with higher expectations than just stumbling upon this restaurant and trying it). But holy crap, everything about this restaurant was quite underwhelming, from the service to the food. I walked into the restaurant at 8:25 with my friend and asked how long the wait would be for a table of 2, and they said ""no wait"" and sat us down right away. Since we saw how packed and busy the restaurant was (around 95% full) and it was a later dinner for the both of us, we ordered right away. Right when they brought us waters. After ordering a corn app, the oyster and bacon pad thai, and the walnut shrimp, we waited for our food and chatted. The corn came out very quickly, 10 minutes after we placed our order. However, the following 2 dishes came out very very slowly. I understand if there's going to be a longer wait since there were quite a few customers in the restaurant, but as a waiter/waitress, it is your responsibility to communicate that with us, the customers. We were not checked up at all--no water refills and no updates about our food until I had to flag her down (multiple attempts before she walked over to our table) to ask about our food and how much longer it would be before we were able to eat. And that was 45 minutes after we had placed our order. She told us that it was currently over the fire and being cooked, and the walnut shrimp came out around 10 minutes after. HOWEVER, the pad thai took an additional 25 minutes to come out. Which makes me feel very skeptical when she said the pad thai was being cooked and needed to be over the fire for 25 minutes..ANYWHO, we were trying to tell her to cancel the pad thai order since it was taking so long to come out..but of course the bus boy came and brought it out to us before we could get her attention to cancel it. The waitress did give us complimentary white rice and asked the manager to take off the charge of the pad thai, but holy crap..$25 for walnut shrimp that had very little else other than the jumbo shrimp (it was supposed to come with bok choy, blueberries, and walnuts) with really salty sauce, I gotta say...this overall experience was really not worth the wait nor the hype. The pad thai just tasted like normal pad thai and was quite bland. The corn was okay..again nothing special about any of the food that we tasted and took a hell of a long time for it to get to our table. tl; dr--really would not recommend coming here for the food or the experience. Unless you want to wait 1+ hour for your food for average cooked and overpriced Asian fusion food. I, unfortunately, will not be revisiting this restaurant again.",1,0,2,Jenni W.,"Brooklyn, NY",243,83,247
5.0,9/13/2018,"Another wonderful dinner at Talde! I went with my Mom for an early dinner at 6:30 tonight. To start, we enjoyed Pretzel Pork and Chive Dumplings, Mushroom Buns and Kung Pao Wings as part of a design-your-own Pu Pu Platter. They were all yummmmmyyyyyy. We both had a DELISH Watermelon Mocktail that paired perfectly with the apps.We also loved our entree choice in the delicious Bacon Oyster Pad Thai. For sides, we had Everything Roti (flaky and addictive) and the Wok Charred Greens which are smoky and insanely flavorful.An amazing bonus was meeting Chef Dale Talde, who was on the premises. He could not have been nicer or more gracious as we gushed about how much we enjoyed our meal and experience. We spied a little gem on the Brunch menu, which is a Breakfast Ramen featuring Buttered Toast broth, which really sounds like heaven.

We had some cocktails. I tried the watermelon margarita and enjoyed it very much. You can taste the tequila and it wasn't too sweet. For food, we ordered the kung pao chicken wings and a Vegetable pad Thai. The chicken wings were delicious and they have a special homemade ranch that went perfectly with the wings. The pad Thai was not our favorite as for it needed a bit more sauce and spices because it was a bit plain. Other than that we had a great experience and it was all around a nice place.

2.0,9/2/2018,"Had a very pleasant experience during restaurant week, so have been keen for a repeat since.  From the moment walking in, not great: there was a group who couldn't make up their collective mind on whether they wanted to sit in or outside--we had a reservation--finally, I said: ""UM, I have a reservation, why do we have to wait for these people to make up their minds?  Seat us, we're two, not four and we'll take inside, thank you very much.""  Next: table next to us sits down, the woman had thoughtfully doused herself in an aptly named, extremely potent perfume called FLOWER BOMB--TRUST ME, IT WAS EXACTLY THAT.  The waiter was giving me a hard time about moving to the booth that was offered to us when we were seated which was still open only ten minutes after we sat down--then he disappears for ten minutes; not happy (I should have been more assertive).  We finally get reseated, much better, no perfume, just the allergy attack, sneezing and scratchy throat post effect.   This waiter was totally off his game, he disappeared again for almost a 1/2 hour, I needed a drink and we were waiting all this time for the second part of our meal while the tables all around us, being served by another waiter, who were seated later than us, were all being served their second course already, and this guy was nowhere to be found.  OK, I'm pissed, though it's been a good run of great waiter experiences so I'm trying to grind through it.  This guy is a lousy waiter, he screwed up our meal--the second course was cold, because, it was apparently sitting on the shelf waiting to be served for quite a while. I told him he blew it, then he has the gaul to apologize and then politely blamed the kitchen that was visible to us and cranking out meals just fine for the rest of the servers who were being attentive to their tables. Not one to make a scene unnecessarily ... gave him his tip (which he was very thankful for) and we left.Too bad, I was hoping for a much better experience; many other places to try, not feeling the urge to go back here any time soon.  **Update: Given all the lousy recent reviews, really really bad reviews, we won't be going back.  Not worth the $$.",0,0,0,Bill M.,"Brooklyn, NY",34,20,0

I don't know how they pulled that off, but it was truly impressive for an order that big. From there it was nonstop flavor, from the chicken and waffles to the pancakes topped with pork to the bacon pad thai and then omg that cinnamon roll. And I'm not usually a salad for breakfast kinda person, but those candied walnuts were ridiculous. I could have ate those alone. My only complaint is that I couldn't stop eating, which I came very close to.

Somehow, I ended up ordering a Pad Thai because there were not many vegetarian options. Now first of all, it will be a felony in all the states in Thailand to call that thing a Pad Thai. It was a plate full of half boiled noodles, some onions and absurd amount of salt. At that point, I had no energy to send it back and wait for my food again.

Tonight, we were promptly seated, and it's important to note that the they do not take reservations. The service is always pleasant and attentive, but we did notice a wait for our meal,l more than usual, but I digress. Drinks. Ordered the Rose and Narragansett Lager on draft. The beer, usually pretty robust, tasted like someone added extra seltzer. Yuch. Sent it back promptly and ordered San Miguel (to be safe) from the bottle selection, which is not that extensive. Our order consisted of the mushroom buns, Hong Kong Noodles, Vegetable Fried Rice and a replacement for Korean Chicken. The one thing we could count on was the quality of the prepared dishes. So it is sad to say that we feel the quality has declined (but not the price, of course).

2.0,7/15/2018,"I had a frustrating experience dining here. I wanted to like it, but did not have an enjoyable meal. I was excited about the bronzini - it is my favorite fish. But it came with whole red chili peppers blended into the dish, with no warning. Nothing on this item on the menu says spicy - the waiter did not warn us, they did not warn us when they dropped off the plate. So I took a big bite, and wound up with a whole chili pepper in my mouth, that I swallowed. It was painful. My mouth was on fire. Then the waitress did not check in with us for a long time. Her colleague brought me a glass of milk. Finally my mouth cooled down and I could eat a little.They apologized about the pepper, but didn't even offer to comp anything on the ticket. Just bad form. I felt the waitress over-sold us on items. We had way too much food. The food comes out with the sides first - so we didn't get the main course until the end. And by then between the sides and the milk, I was full and could not eat much. The bronzini was OK, but the sauce is like an eggplant parmesan sauce. Much too heavy for the fish. My favorite thing was the charred veggies. Those were great. Otherwise there were interesting flavors, but not quite in the right balance.

I was disappointed, think of Talde as asian food being diluted with ""white-ness"". Everything was super bland and did not taste as good as the reviews here said they were! Not to mention, Talde claims to be asian fusion yet I did not see a single asian staff member! What? There was only one dish I truly enjoyed which was the chicken adobo rice soup dish, it reminded me of a similar dish my grandma made. As for the Korean fried wings, they were tough to chew and not so tasty. The prices of the dishes here do not justify the portion of the dish. With so many different options nearby, I wouldn't recommend if you're looking for authentic asian fusion.",13,3,4,Michelle S.,"Brooklyn, NY",659,297,583

We hopped over to another bar and came back and had another drink as well. It was a craft cocktail that was served with grapefruit - It was pretty darn good! We chit chatted with folks at the bar and it was finally our turn to get food at a table.We ordered the kung pao chicken wings, the pretzel pork and chive dumplings, and the crispy oysters and bacon Pad Thai. We didn't have utensils are first but we were able to get someone by to get that taken care of for us. OMG, all three things were soooooooooooooo delicious. They offer you warm towels to clean up after eating the wings because they are ridiculously messy, but worth the eating experience. A bit on the salty side, but I still liked them. I think the best thing to me was the Pad Thai. I probably could have had an extra plate of that stuff. So good.",3,3,2,Lynn H.,"Sacramento, CA",193,480,331

You MUST get the lychee martini, but be prepared for something that tastes not a whole lot like the old, familiar lychee martinis you might have had. Though it didn't taste like what I know, it was unbelievably delicious. So, order one and be openminded.The kung pao chicken--dear god, they are good! And, the place is smart to provide wet cloth towels to clean our fingers afterwards.Wok charred greens--Chinese would tell you that this dish got ""wok hey,"" which literally translates to ""the breath of the wok."" It's a good thing. It was delicioso!The roasted branzino was good, but it didn't blow me away.I wouldn't order the pretzel pork and chive dumplings again because the shells were dry and hard.

Delightfully unpretentious, the staff was genuinely kind and one can already feel the sense of pride that the creators have towards what's going down in the kitchen! The flavors are robust, nuanced and deliciously balanced! Watermelon margarita was sheer magic with a delicious 'scoop' of freshly chilled melon. The mushroom bun was truly one of the most flavorful mushroom dishes I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying.... all of the components were melodious and it delivered an unexpected pop of epic flavor! The pork and chive filling within the pretzel dumplings was so delicious I could eat it as a stand alone with a splash of soy and sriracha for days straight! The Lumpia Shanghai is an exciting twist on the traditional samosa... quite fragrant and dashed with masala. Fresh, tasty, strong flavors with the inclusion of herbal influences, international spices from start to finish! I was pleasantly surprised by the ramen (as I am known to be quite the 'Ramen Snob').... I loved the subtlety of the broth with fresh shiitakes and how the pork belly was nicely portioned without being laden with fat. The egg was cooked PERFECTLY and I tossed in some fresh chili oil and the special braised greens with garlic chips--- delicious!!!! Chef Chris, Dondi, Robert and Zakir are a joy.... ultra humble gentlemen, attentive and know what a fusion experience is all about!  TALDE left me stuffed and swooning.... its a restaurant that is not to be missed!

1.0,5/2/2018,"This was one of the most disappointing dining experiences I've had in NYC. We're fans of Dale, love his book, and BF had dined here a while back. Now that we live nearby, we were really excited to spend a rare date night at Talde.We arrived relatively early on a Tuesday evening, and the place was practically empty.My BF stated at the outset to our water that he has a peanut & sesame allergy--one that thankfully isn't epi-pen level, but that can ruin an evening, regardless. Our waiter assured us that any menu item can be made without either ingredient, so we went ahead with cocktails, a happy hour plate of apps, an entree and a side to share. A bit later, our app plate came out, delivered by a food runner, I assume, with one app on the plate COVERED in peanuts. The plate was taken back by the food runner. Another waitress, with a woman I assume she was training in tow, came by to deliver our new, sans-peanut app plate with apologies (where tf is our waiter tho?)We're a bit concerned for the safety of the food at this point, and BF asks her: ""are we safe here? I shared my allergies with our waiter and the dish came out covered in peanuts."" The waitress then asked him what his specific allergies were, he confirmed sesame & peanut to her. She then asks what we've ordered and she says ""oh, yeah, you'll be fine."" BTW: The ground pork in our pretzel dumplings was undercooked--as in PINK. Not safe. The lumpia were interesting, the wings were OK, but nothing was impressive enough to write home about. Our actual waiter shows up at some point, apologizes for ""spacing out"" on the allergy info. Thanks, bro. Now our entree comes out... and it's COVERED in sesame seeds. We'll be fine, indeed... Now we're incredulous. It gets sent back. This is insulting now.Now some guy who might be a cook, could be a manager, idk? pops by, quickly apologizes, says they're taking that dish off of our bill. BF then orders a second round of his cocktail, I order one of what he'd had because it was better than my first one. A long time later, I'm brought the drink I'd had already, not what I asked for. Gets sent back. How hard can this be? The place still isn't busy.Now the entree comes back, sans sesame. Waiter appears again and proceeds to imply that BF never told him that sesame was an issue, and tries to hold that line to defend himself...as though insulting a customer you've nearly poisoned is the right thing to do at this point.Entree was just OK. Cocktails were better than the food. None of it was worth the trouble. To add insult to injury, BF discovered on the walk home that his allergy had in fact been triggered. It could have been due to cross contamination, or the addition of a sesame or peanut based ingredient in a recipe that the staff wasn't educated on. Either way, it ruined our night.You can take screw ups off of tickets and even comp entire bills, but you can't undo what an allergic reaction does to an entire night (or couple of days, as the case may be). These people are woefully irresponsible, and disrespectful to boot. If you have an allergy--DON'T RISK IT by dining here.",7,2,0,Ashley H.,"New York, NY",393,24,3
1.0,5/2/2018,"Food was...fine. Told the server I had a sesame and peanut sensitivity. First dish came out with peanuts after a conversation about how it could be done without them. His apology was ""I spaced"". Another server and trainee brought out the corrected dish, I'm not positive I told her about the sesame, but my wife assures me I did. Next dish comes out coated in sesame seeds. Again the blond male server came out to ""apologize"", which is to say he told me he didn't hear me tell him about the sesame sensitivity...which is the first thing I do at every restaurant I eat at...because I'm not making it up and it makes me extremely uncomfortable for hours...which I was after I left...because they CLEARLY don't care enough to prioritize people's issues like that and obviously gave me cross contaminated food...then made me feel like they were accusing ME of causing the mistake.

A bit lacking on the mala spice though (by Asian standards). Charred greens were a good portion and a good complement to the meal. Pad Thai was a little heavy on the fish sauce and nothing too special, albeit with a few fried oysters on top. Veggie fried rice was good but also not much to write home about.

For drinks, I ordered a glass of wine (they were very generous with the pour) and my friend ordered a margarita. We skipped on an appetizer, and decided to go with the ramen and general Taldes chicken as entrees, to split. Everything was delicious. They brought the ramen out first, and it was a huge portion, definitely shareable. The General Taalde's Chicken is a take on general tso's chicken, but so much better.

We started with a pot of French press coffee ($9), and it was probably some of the best coffee I've had in a while. The Bloody Mary was expensive and honestly not worth the money, though, so I'd just stick with the coffee and leave the cocktails for another day. It was overly sour and very bland, and could have used a bit more ginger. If you're going to add ginger, don't skimp on it.However, what they lacked in cocktails they made up for in their brunch cuisine.

Our table was small, but they later moved us to a bigger one to accommodate the food. The wings were spicy and good, they came with a ranch dressing. Samosas were made with butternut squash, and by themselves were delicious. I didn't think the kaffir lime yogurt sauce paired well with them, couldn't taste the kaffir lime. The fruit chutney did however. Kale salad was good, had plantain chips on top which were a nice touch. Was excited for the beef noodle dish, but this sadly did not deliver as I'd hoped. There was no broccoli but there were some bits of spinach or other green, and either string beans or asparagus stems? it added an element of freshness and crunch, but there was no broccoli to speak of. The egg of course added richness, didn't mind that. But the beef was scarce and was a tough chewy cut. All in all, it was a fine meal.

2.0,10/19/2017,"I had a very nice time with a friend I had not seen in years at Talde.  However, it is not because the the food. It is because of seeing my friend. The food left me completely underwhelmed.  I could deal with the cramped table, waiters banging into the back of my chair every 3 minutes, and the mechanically aggressive wait staff - that's all part of the NY dining experience.  But the food was not particularly good and for a place that is known for flavor the food was oddly flavorless. The pretzel pork and chive dumplings were primarily the dumpling casing as opposed to the contents. In retrospect, I just remember an extremely chewy exterior and I couldn't pick up any flavors in the meager filling. The Korean chicken had some promise - it looked great - but the chicken itself was very dry and tough. The beef and broccoli was a blob of limp noodles, beef, and ample fat. Flavorless. Stringy meat. I do not even recall seeing one piece of broccoli.  Maybe my friend ate it. 3/4 through the meal I looked at my friend and said, ""Well, none of this is particularly good.""  We both laughed because it was nice to see each other and it didn't matter where we were. We shared a new dessert menu item: something referred to by the staff as a ""cookie"" although it is really a large brownie served in 4 pieces (in keeping with the family style theme.) I heard the waiter mention chocolate and salt.  I think he mentioned two other flavors.  Again: underwhelming.  Just a sort of dry brownie with very good chocolate flavor, barely a hint of salt, and nothing.  We left so much food on our plate, easily 2/3, the natural question from the waiter would have been, is everything OK?  Not that we would have said anything...we just will not go back.",1,0,0,Marco O.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,84,14

The waffles that come with the chicken are not dipped,but come with the syrup on the side (which i wish it did).. either way, great waffles paired with coconut oil/maple syrup concoction. Chicken is very good(not mouth watering buttermilk biscuit,but like thai chili style), esp when they dont overload it with the sauce(i suggest asking for little sauce). Lemon grass chicken was , def worth ordering. They have a mushroom noodle with fried egg(cant rem the name), that was really good, the veggies were good, noodles were not to greasy, just right.. i mixed the lemon grass chicken with it..ohh, i also had the pretzel pork dumplings, salty and good, nothing i would crave for, but def different.On that note, place is a great brunch spot with a mix of foods.

When the food came, we got a huge plate of the crab fried rice, compliments of the chef!!! Super nice of them. The food was pretty good. The vegetables (long beans) were a little salty but the Asian flavors were delicious. The fried chicken was boneless, crispy, and juicy.

2.0,9/13/2017,"Last night I went to Talde for my second time, with tempered expectations, and came away disappointed. The waiter was quite pleased with himself every time he came to our table, reciting arcane ingredients and proudly detailing the processes by which our spirits were spritzed and served, but his visits were as periodic as they were verbose and professorial. He missed orders, forgot drinks, and did nothing to make up for the over-twenty-minute wait for a health inspection to finish. The drinks were overpriced and underpoured. As for the food, I rather imagined i was eating a peacock for all the pomp and hidden meat. The final dish presented was our first ordered, the Brussels sprouts, which were plated with great ceremony. The sprouts appeared to be throughly charred, all the way into the center, leaf after leaf. An impossible feat, you might think, but not worth exploring or attempting to replicate, as the sprouts, like the restaurant itself, present a great deal going on, but reveal inside little more the illusion of flavor. Overburdened by its considerable affect and adornment, Talde has no heart and is best avoided unless you seek another expensive, unforgettable night you wish you could forget.

4.0,9/4/2017,"This is a great and a good lookin place. There were originally 7 of us but we ended up adding another person and we had to move the reservation for 15 min. The restaurant was totally cool with that. The wait staff, the host and the management were funny and super cool. 8 of us barely fit in the booth, thankfully we are all rather small people but it was tight. Here is what we tried:Guacamole - both kinds, it looks like sushi, small portion, it was probably my least fave thing in comparison with other flavors there. Kale salad - miso dressing amazing Samosa - ok, ask for hot sauceBrussels - delicious! Salmon tartar - delicious!Branszino - LOTS of very unique flavors, it's deboned too, wrapped in a banana leaves Fried chicken - very crispy, tasty sauce, comes with sweet cherries Lemongrass pork shoulder - tasty peanut spicy sauceFried rice - very pleasant, good for sharing, tasted light and not greasy Desert: they only have one - halo halo. It comes in a big bowl and its content gets mixed before serving into individual bowls by a waiter. It's definitely a weird concoction. It's like a milky icey crunchy sweet soup with tapioca gelatin bites, blueberries, oranges and strawberries, topped with captain crunch cereal. I still have mixed feelings about it. Since there were so many of us, the manager ordered another one for us and that was very nice. All of us liked the experience, the only thing I would like to see or confirm if they use organic, wild caught and grass fed proteins. I was reluctant eating meat and fish there and was only sampling. As for the drinks, we tried large watermelon margaritas and ginger smash.

3.0,8/29/2017,"My biggest takeaway from Talde is that it's a much better place for meat eaters than vegetarians. The menu is almost entirely meat - except a few appetizers. But they can make the pad thai vegetarian or vegan and they can make the fried rice vegetarian (I even called ahead to ask about the options and the woman I spoke to was very nice and accommodating). Good enough - I'm usually pretty happy with a plate of pad thai.It was very clear when we ordered that we had 1 vegetarian and 3 meat eaters - I even explicitly told the waitress I was vegetarian (and she seemed super conscious of it) - and we ordered 1 vegetarian entree and 3 meat entrees (for the meat eaters to share). For some reason, they decided to bring out all the meat dishes first one after the other so there was nothing I could eat until the very end. She did mention that they bring things out as they are ready, but a more experienced restaurant certainly wouldn't bring dishes out that way so that it was very obvious 1 person would be sitting idle, and also I find it hard to believe 3 meat dishes were done before 1 veggie pad thai. Onto the food itself: again, the meat dishes were much better than the vegetarian pad thai. The pad thai is not a traditional pad thai - don't exepct the slightly sweet, peanutty flavor you get from a standard thai place. It had more of an East Asian flavor (salty and soy saucy) and it was a bit slimy. Honestly I was not a fan. The meat dishes were pretty good - the fried chicken had good skin but the meat was a bit too thick, the oyster and bacon pad thai my dinner companions enjoyed because of the bacon flavor, and the standout dish was the pork shoulder which was incredibly tender and had a delicious sauce. So in conclusion - come here if you eat meat (and order the pork shoulder).",2,0,0,Cat S.,"Manhattan, NY",447,371,0

1.0,6/22/2017,"$100 sadness! Perhaps ordering through Caviar was my first mistake but being such a huge fan of Dale Talde on top chef and seeing his food could be delivered to me I decided this was a chance I should take. I ordered the crispy oyster and bacon pad Thai, a dozen Kung Pao wings, market vegetables which were brussel sprouts and sambal and pretzel pork and chive dumplings. The wings were ok.  Nothing to write home about. The dumplings were depressing. They taste burnt and the combination of it being a pretzel and a dumpling was weird. The pad Thai was drowning in sauce. Felt like I was eating soup with a BBQ broth. Just disgusting. The Brussel sprouts looked like cat vomit and taste worse (I assume). I wish I could get my money, time and taste buds back. Never again!",5,1,1,Elizabeth O.,"Brooklyn, NY",309,90,118

The cook was just perfect keeping the chicken moist, however the chicken breast was cut after frying causing it to rapidly loose moisture.Tip: Eat the cuts up parts first and chit chat later.Things that I would alter for my next visit, and some suggestions for the chefKimchi Yogurt on the side instead on the plate,A wedge of lemon to zest the chicken, or some kind of butter and garlic based dip would round off the flavor,.Choice of meat can be added to the order I personally prefer dark vrs white chicken meat.Do it cut up chicken after this robs the pleasure of biting into a steaming piece of freshly fried chicken.Adding red chili pepper of black sulfurous salt to the batter would excite the flavorsAll in all a great experience, I salute Dale Talde skill of turning this simple dish a please to eat.",0,0,0,Umer A.,"Brooklyn, NY",13,132,189
5.0,6/10/2017,"You know those dining experiences which you have that you spend years recounting to everyone you know? That is the meal we just had at Talde. Being fans of Top Chef, My wife and I went to Talde for our 11th Anniversary mostly due to the owner Dale Talde. My expectations were high, but the Staff at Talde far exceeded my hopes. The meal was fantastic. Let me start off with the Bar: Talde has an Excellent and original Bar Menu. As a fan of the Sazerac I tried the Del Monte - advertised as a ""Pineapple Rum"" Sazerac. I don't know how it was done, but the bartender somehow improved upon my favorite drink! It was fantastic and was alone worth the price of admission. For appetizers We ordered the pretzel dumplings and Chicken wings. The menu Touts the Chicken Wings as. Being the best in the US - let me tell you I don't think that was Hyperbole. The dumplings also were amazing and are perhaps the best I have ever eaten. For dinner we ordered the Korean Fried Chicken and the Chow Fun - bother were fantastic. The Chicken in my mind was the star. Both Moist and crispy, this was probably the best fried chicken I had ever eaten. For dessert we were served the shaved iced dish with a variety of fruit with a tea infused condensed milk and Captain Crunch known as Halo Halo. Thankfully it was a hot day because buy the end we were both delightfully shivering. The dish was light and fruity and the perfect way to end a perfect meal. One final note the staff was fantastic. They made the meal. We were even served complimentary Champagne as a congratulations for our Anniversary.

Love the Filipino sun rising above the logo.We ordered sausage egg and cheese fried rice, kung pao chicken and waffles, breakfast ramen, and pork pancakes with a fried egg on top, I forget the exact name but it was on the pink specials of the day menu sheet.I'm blessed to have great friends who were willing to share a bite because each bite of these four dishes would make any hungry person selfish! LolSausage, egg and cheese fried rice comes in a small bowl but enough to make you full. The fried rice was a bit on the oily side but hey it's that good good Asian oil. Texture of all the ingredients were pretty good!Kung pao chicken and waffles! Now this popular Chinese entree dish seems limited to just steam rice with green onions and you're set! BUT Talde did the unthinkable and added waffles! Man what a great decision. The Alice of the kung pao and the sweetness from the waffle and syrup were literally ying and yang! Very good!Breakfast ramen with bacon! Now you can pretty much add bacon to anything and it'll be an amazing dish! The broth was not your usual broth meaning, your type of lunch/dinner ramen where the broth is a bit heavy due to the amount of toppings one puts. For the breakfast ramen the broth toast was made just right and light and easily enjoyable for your hangover cure! Now the grand finale! Pork with pancakes and fried egg (I forget exact name) but it was on the special of the day menu. The simple idea of pancakes was brought to an unimaginable level. You normally think pancakes with egg, and bacon, which is boring!!!! Add pork and egg?!  EVERYONE NEEDS TO TRY THIS DISH! Service was average, but it was pretty busy.

4.0,5/8/2017,"""The next day, I could still smell that Kung Pao sauce on my fingers"". That's the new title of my autobiography, which goes on sale next week for $495 on the Big Baller Brand website. You get a free pair of basketball shoes with it, while supplies last.  One of the best things about Talde is all the light you get inside from the wrap around windows. Because of this, there's no real bad seat in that you never really feel trapped in a corner. Unless, you choose the chef's counter. We did, because the wait for sitting outside was dumb long dong.I don't want to know how my food is made. I don't want to see how they touch everything (including scratching their nose) and then touch my food before giving it to me. I don't want to know the wings are pre-cooked and then tossed in that sauce before it's set in front of me. I don't want to see the expediter taste the plate before sending it out. I don't want to see how tired & run down all the cooks look behind the hot ass stoves, to make food for me. Who the fuck thinks this shit is a good idea? Not me, Gyna. And NEVER AGAIN, will I do this to myself. I'll skip these on the next visit:Kung Pao Wangs. First of all, it was cool in the middle (see above) and the sauce was the only thing that made you think this was just cooked. Sure, it's somewhat flavorful, but unless, you're a weirdo who eats wings with a knife and fork it's messy AF to eat, so take that into consideration if you're here on a date. Then again, any girl who orders this on a date with me, is wifey material. House Cocktails. We had two orders of lychee martini and whiskey smash to start. It would take 6 of these to get me smashed and I'm a cheap date. Ito ay basura. I'm not saying you need to have a lot of alcohol for me to call it a good drink, but for $13 each, I need to feel like I didn't just drink sugar water. I went with the champagne of Filipino beers for the rest of the time, aka-Red Horse, which is malt liquor. It's actually more like the Colt 45 of Filipino beers, minus Billy Dee. This was a maybe: The branzino. It looks like it would have a lot more flavor, but it was subtle and very moist. I think they wrapped it in banana leaves? I'm not a huge white fish fan, so this kind of fish normally isn't my thing. It had intentional burnt parts to it that I enjoyed immensely. More foods should have burnt edges or sides to it when appropriate. I need this in my life, weekly:The smoked bacon and fried oyster Pad Thai. The thick cut ""bacon bits"" has a more ham texture to it and I haven't tasted anything this amazing since I had a Benton's ham, aka-the Bentley of Ham. The spice was mild, but flavorful. The crispy/creamy play of the fried oysters were the perfect compliment to the salty, extreme smokey goodness of that bacon and both danced in harmony with the rest of the dish. I'd spread this all over my body and eat myself, if that was humanly possible. You may pause here to throw up. Finally, a rant from me to all you douche's out there: At the Chef's counter, my back was turned from a table of Asians, but I could hear those dicks.   One of them was Filipino and the rest were a mix of jungle and fancy Asians. The Flip kid started talking about how he ate some kind of Filipino dish here the last time and it wasn't even close to what ""real Filipino"" food taste like. Don't even get me started on how he thought, Filipino food isn't supposed to be ""expensive"". This infuriates me to no end. I wanted so bad to kick him in the throat, but I'm a lady, so I refrained. This debate, which happens a lot with my people is apples and bowling balls. You don't go to Sandusky, Ohio looking for NYC. Unless, you're a buffoon. It's wannabe, hipster, food blogging foolios (aka ""foodies"") that take food pics standing on chairs like they're some kind of fucking drone, and don't have a clue - like this kid, that give places like this a bad rep. If you don't like the food, I get that. However, to say that a dish that was created by Dale Talde, a Filipino, isn't Filipino enough for you is, for lack of a better word: retarded. First of all, this place doesn't claim to be like your momma's or lola's cooking, retarded Flip kid. It barely has any Filipino inspired dishes at all on the menu, actually. And second of all, if the intent was to modernize a traditional Filipino dish using modern technique and different ingredients it's still, in it's soul: Filipino. It's just not traditional Filipino, you jackass. Lastly, price has nothing to do with authenticity or how good something tastes. If the cost of a dish that gave you a foodboner is the main reason you don't like it, you're a basic bitch. I feel better. And, I think for the most part, you will too after eating here.",9,16,10,Your Moms B.,"New York, NY",98,412,3437

2.0,5/5/2017,"It's rare for a restaurant to disappoint me so strikingly. The plates are tiny, the ambient noise is so loud you feel you're in a sports bar (honestly, the only thing missing were the TV's but it was loud enough that I thought they were there too), and the prices were unjustifiably high even for NYC (think $5 for one small and greasy piece of nan bread). All this could be forgiven if the food were good. But it tasted just like fried and quick Chinese take-out: the pad Thai w oysters and bacon sounded exquisitely creative but it was so poorly executed (greasy, watery, over-sour...just meh) that the only thing interesting abt it was the name. For the $5 roti we were given only one very thin piece of nan that was also greasy and quite frankly for $5 for one piece of nan with a glorified description in the menu we were expecting at least a mildly creative take on ""nan"" (esp since the name tricks you)...but it was just...nan. I thought surely the $35 brazino fish cooked in banana leaves will make up for it all. Fat chance. It had decent texture but gone were the subtle infused flavors (lemongrass or kefir leaves....just something, anything?) that one would expected from fish done right. It was just bland and overpriced and tiny. Want rice with your fish? Rice costs separate of course...and that was $18 for a plate of fried rice....that tasted well, like fried rice. Do yourself a favor and just go to an ethnic hole in the wall restaurant instead, where the food will be flavorful not greasy and much easier on your wallet.  I knew it would be expensive bc I read the menu prices, but the food sounded creative and I was expecting the quality to be at least decent.

For the main course we ordered the Korean Fried chicken, which was hands down amazing. In case you ever wonder if chicken fried in spices and covered in grapes is good, the answer is a resounding YES. Next we had the lemongrass pork and hand to god, I teared up eating this.

The majority of the dishes we ordered were heavy handed on the sauce. Too much of something isn't always a good thing. The Korean Fried Chicken was not crispy at all. It was actually stale and dry, laid over a heavy pour of spicy sauce. It felt like the dish was sitting out for a while and wasn't even meant for our table as it came fairly quickly compared to the other entrees we ordered. We also ordered the pork shoulder. Again, heavy on the sauce but the pork was decent. The oyster bacon pad thai was okay. The crab fried rice is what is it - only dish that wasnt doused in sauce.

Branzino.Numerous visits have cemented my appreciation for this dish (see previous review).  It is the best thing on the menu imo.  If you're grossed out by bones, it's deboned for you before it hits the table. If you are freaked out by the thought of a cold, dead fish eye staring up at you as you roll yourself a tiny taco with the mini mushu wrappers they provide, I can't help you with that one.  Except to say, ""get over it already.""  It is a testament to how much I like the Whole Roasted Branzino and some of the other dishes on the menu (refer to previous review), that I keep coming back.  Because prices here have creeped up significantly over the past year or so.  My beloved Branzino now runs $35(!)   Luckily, it's very shareable, and with a couple apps, though I'd suggest you skip the meh Samosas, it works as a meal for two.  But still...  This spot has definitely toppled into the date night category for hubby and me.I have been dining here since it opened and while it now seems to run like a well-oiled machine, I miss those early days.  Service was more personal back then. And the Chef, Dale Talde, could often be spotted helming the stove in the open kitchen.  Alas, he is too busy nowadays for that, what with his ever-expanding mini restaurant empire that now includes BK, Manhattan, and even New Jersey.  Who'd've thunk it?  Because I can still picture potty-mouthed Dale from his Top Chef Days, showcasing his savant-like skills for making stoner food.  Dale, ya done good.",5,0,2,Yael D.,"Brooklyn, NY",133,572,1877

1.0,1/18/2017,"Simply put, the food is too salty. This is an Asian fusion restaurant but there was not one Asian chef in the open kitchen.  Chef Talde may have been off the evening we were there but there were some heavy handed salt shakers in the kitchen as far as I can tell.  It rendered all the food we ordered inedible.  Being famished we took some quick bites but soon realized how overly seasoned everything was.  I had the Dan Dan Noodles with shredded short ribs which was made with chow fun noodles (wide rice noodles).  This is an interesting take on the traditional wheat noodles with which the spicy noodle dish is usually made.  We also had the Korean fried chicken which bore no resemblance to the garlicky sweet chili chicken of those famous chains and which are also much cheaper.  Again, the primary flavor was salt and there were hints of Chinese five spice in this dish.  This was strange but I keep forgetting it's fusion so maybe it's their spin on the traditional Korean drumsticks and thighs.  The meat was cut up making the dish indistinguishable as chicken.  It's irrelevant though if the salt factor is an obstacle.  All in all, Talde was a disappointment and the chef or whomever runs the pass should check the seasoning before sending the dishes out.We also had a pretty green server who obviously didn't know the menu that night and had a hard time explaining to us what was in the roti. He had to ask a manager who both said it was like an everything bagel?!  We know rotis and they're nothing like a bagel.  We just wanted to know if it was filled with anything.  Was this supposed to be  a New York answer?  If you're going to have an Asian menu or any menu for that matter, make sure the FOH knows what is what, or else the concept and dishes come off as disingenuous.On our way out, the hostess asked us how our meal was and when we said it was too salty, she just continued to smile and didn't take in any of our feedback ensuring she would not convey any of disappointment to the kitchen.  Oh, not to mention, the dishes were small and expensive for what they were.  Take the star I had to put in order to start the review and take it away for the proper rating.",3,0,2,Wailana W.,"New York, NY",59,309,1103

However, after taking a glance at the identification card the employee quickly snarked, ""you could've bought this from the internet."" After back and forth explanations he refused to understand.  I couldn't believe it! First of all, there is a rule that they they are not suppose to ask to see the ID card because it's a form of discrimination. Secondly, if he did not recognize the identification he should've tried to understand instead and look into it instead of ACCUSING me of faking it. First time i felt discriminated against because I had my service dog with me. Incredibly intolerant people. Their behavior and words were disgusting.

Love this dish. 3) Kung Pao Wings- Tasty baller  AF wings.  Comes with some ranch to give them an american twist.  Good heat and Asian flavor.4) Dan Dan Noodles- These had a thick, Chow Fun (I believe) noodle.  Slirpy saucy meaty.  Didn't disappoint, I prefer proteins over noodles in general.

I got the vegetarian yuzu guacamole and it had such a nice burst of flavor I wanted to take more than my share. The pretzel pork dumplings have this nice crispy outside with a succulent pork filling and the chinese mustard to dip it in. Drool... I wish I just had a couple orders of each to myself since I was only in town for the weekend. So yummy and addictive!Main Course: Fried Chicken and Crab Fried Rice. I ordered this because it's featured often on Dale's IG. I have to say while it was good, maybe I hyped it up too much for myself. I wasn't a fan of the kimchi yogurt, and the fried chicken didn't have the soulful flavor and juiciness that you crave out of fried chicken. The crab fried rice, I probably would have enjoyed more if I didn't start with the Yuzu Guacamole sushi/crispy rice.

I now don't think anything is any good on the menu as the waiter said the best things were the ones we ordered. First the pad Thai with bacon came. Nothing to brag about and there was only one small piece of bacon. Honestly I regret not saying more to the staff as I could not be more disappointed with the food. Also had the chicken wings with waffles.. only the sauce was good but the waffle underwhelming and the chicken wings awful dry and not pleasant.

I also got the everything roti which was more of a Malaysian paratha than a roti. Just something to note, not a bad thing.

4.0,11/14/2016,"Let me begin by saying that every morsel of food I consumed was absolutely outstanding. I couldn't find a single flaw in any dish. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised when my cinnamon roll arrived, as I never expected it to be so large, fluffy or full of flavor.Now, the reason I knocked a star of my otherwise perfect rating rests solely on the shoulders of the staff. Upon entering the establishment, we were greeted by hostess whose attitude I could only describe as indifferent. And this came after waiting a rather awkward amount of time at the hostess stand, despite the far-less-than-busy atmosphere at the moment. Upon being seated, it took close to 15 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us. In fact, before our waiter even came up to us, we were approached by some other member of the staff who simply asked, ""What do you want?"" Which I'm sure was a reaction to us looking around for our waiter. Now, I will say that once we finally met the waiter, he was amazing and hands down the nicest person we encountered throughout our meal.Another point came when he mentioned a dim sum menu would be making its way around the restaurant in case we wanted anything. Well, it came by alright, but the person carrying it took it to one table behind us and then proceeded to skip every other table there. Later, when the waiter asked if we had seen it, we told him of this and he graciously offered us a free portion. The only other note I have is the inconsistency in delivery. After waiting close to 15 minutes to even speak with a waiter, any of our dishes came out in rapid-fire fashion. Then, we waited on our entrees for close to 30 minutes (lemongrass chicken and breakfast fried rice). So, that was a tad weird. Would I go back? Absolutely, because for all I know it was an off day for the staff.

This dish was sublime.  Crispy rice balanced with creamy avocado. A good size portion to share.  The samosas are also excellent, but be warned that it is a relatively heavy appetizer, and you want to save room for other dishes! Had the whole Branzino on the recommendation of the waiter - and it did not disappoint. It is served with pancakes similar to a Peking Duck.  The fish is well de-boned, well cooked, in a spicy sauce. The vegetable of the day was Brussel sprouts.  It was probably the best sprouts I have ever had.  Delicious balance of creaminess and crispness.   We did not have the Dan Dan noodles, but the table next to us did, and boy did I wish we had ordered that!

So even though we were only in town for the weekend and staying in Manhattan, we made the trek to Brooklyn to check this place out.We made a reservation but arrived a little early so we stopped by the bar. We had a couple cocktails and a couple beers. I highly recommend the Not A Colada especially if you like Pina Coladas (in my Jimmy Buffet voice). After a few drinks, we made our way to our table and ordered the Kung Pao Wings and the Pretzel Dumplings. The wings are a MUST if you come here. My biggest concern with chicken wings is that they be cooked all the way through and these perfectly cooked. The crispy wings were smothered in a delicious sweet and savory sauce and sprinkled with peanuts and scallions. With each bite I thought these should be call POW POW wings, lol. For our entrees, we got the Chow Fun and the Crispy Oyster and Bacon Pad Thai. Our waitress said that these were two of their more popular entrees and I see why. Both were very flavorful and didn't disappoint. Unfortunately, we were so excited to dig in when the food arrived that I didn't get to snap pics of the entrees.After drinks, apps, and dinner we were pretty stuffed. But since we're not from this area and who knows when we'll get to return. We decided to split a dessert. The only dessert option they had was something called Halo Halo. This is not something either my husband or myself were familiar with. The waitress described it as shaved ice, with some sort of milk maybe coconut? Topped with fruit, cap'n crunch cereal, tapioca, and a couple other ingredients I can't remember. I have to admit that it all sounded kind of strange but being a self proclaimed foodie, I insisted that we try it. We were pleasantly surprised.

But we were really disappointed with the food.First, the waitress was really sweet and did the best she could. However, our food took too long to come. We waited close to 40 minutes, when the restaurant was not really busy. Where I was sitting, I had a direct view of the chef and kitchen staff, and noticed on several occasions that they paused to take pictures of the food, with cell phones. They then went back to handling the food directly. Call me a ""germaphobe"", but they shouldn't have been doing that with bare hands, no less. To his defense, I a sure a lot worse goes on in kitchens that aren't open, we just don't see it.When the food arrived it was okay, it felt like it was missing something. We had the wings. They were fine, a little salty but fine. We we finally got the main courses, I had the crab fried rice and the shrimp in a chilly sauce with lettuce wraps and peaches. It was creative.

Pork chow fun, fried oyster pad Thai, chicken wings, and some weird desert that was basically Fruity Pebbles and gummy worms over shaved coconut ice. It was all incredible. But the last few times I've been there I think the chef must have had a stroke and dumped the entire contents of the salt shaker in my food. If I was a slug I would have been bubbling and oozing all over the table. Desert was still good but it couldn't undo the sodium overload.

The waitress assured us there was nothing they could do, but to ask the manager to bring it back. Disappointed, but we ordered some other fruity drinks and sulked. The awesome manager came by, we jokingly complained about the lack of BBQ Negronis and lo-and-behold, he came out with two perfectly made drinks for us. Apparently they have a secret stash of smoked Vermouth in the basement and he cranked some out for us. That is some real customer service. That's the reason I come to Talde. P.S.

1.0,8/8/2016,"My partner and I are on a mission to explore new restaurants in the Park Slope/Windsor Terrace area. When we learned about the owner's role on Top Chef, we were excited to give Talde a try. However, we never made it past the hostess table. The menu makes a point of adding an asterisk to certain items to indicate that they're vegetarian, then sticks it next to an appetizer and a couple of side dishes. It's almost worse that they take the time to recognize vegetarians then refuse to give them any entree options or variations than it would be just to ignore us altogether. When I tell a hostess I'm a vegetarian and there's not enough to eat on the menu, that is typically an opportunity to check with the kitchen and say that they can accommodate, but none of the menu items are remotely adaptable to a vegetarian, and I suspect the owner wouldn't want the hostess to take this action.

My first visit, I had great service -- the server thoroughly explained the menu and which foods included shellfish. She also made a great wine recommendation. The second time was quite different. Our server seemed like she wanted to be anywhere but there, and the service was SLOW, really, really slow. I had to remind her twice that our table had ordered a bottle of wine and hadn't received it.

But Talde was somewhat tasty this time. Reminded me of most of the Sydenay Asian fusion I've had, only edible. It was brash and gauche, overly ambitious, absurdly salted, with unimaginative wine - but I enjoyed some of these dishes, and others I found tepidly interesting. The crab fried rice (not fried¿¿!) was outstanding.Service was slow, cursory, uncaring...essentially atrocious, low end burger joint level. Above Crown Fried chicken, I suppose. We tipped out of the goodness of our hearts. And one or two dishes, while not obviously reheated, were either not fresh (Chinese greens) or had spent more life than the animal spent alive under the heat lamp (chicken).Underlying this I think is the secret to NY food - seek out the common and simple foods, bagels burgers cubanos etcetera, because high end and hype is worldwide, but New York does cosmopolitan like NO OTHER.",1,0,0,Andy B.,"Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia",1,8,1
3.0,7/26/2016,"I have loved Talde since they opened and would travel from the upper west side to Park Slope just to eat there. However on my most recent visit there I have to say something felt off. For one they have decided to try a ""dim sum"" type service for bunch which I would call an epic fail. Perhaps it helps when they are very busy and can turn tables over faster but when it is empty it just felt uncomfortable to have wait staff interrupt my conversation half a dozen times to offer (sell) me more food. I love dim sum- but not at $10-13 per plate and I prefer it in a more authentic environment. That said we ultimately had the breakfast ramen and the wings and waffles. I love the ramen broth- all buttery, salty and rich. The semi cooked egg once broken adds to the richness of the soup. Delish! The noodles were also nice a firm and had a good bite- but then my mouth wanted something more, a vegetable? A crunch? Something other than the bitter raw scallion floating around. I was not yet full but I could not finish the dish which was delicious at the first bite but boring by the end. My husband had the wings which were sweet, sticky and spicy. The waffle was nothing to write home about but the made in house syrup is pure sugar heaven.I am sure that I will go back again as I prefer the dinner menu to the brunch but only if I am in the neighborhood.",2,0,0,Sharon S.,"New York, NY",2,106,132

Wished we had skipped the fried chicken altogether as I thought the meat was pretty dry. Also it says it's a kimchi-style sauce, but it reminded me of buffalo sauce.

The pad Thai comes with pork belly (they call it bacon) and it is very delicious. A little on the sweeter side for my liking but still pretty good. The salad with ginger dressing is also delicious.

My SO did not like that they weren't hot in temperature. We ordered 6 and they brought more than 6, but the extra quantity did not matter. The sauce they were in was a heavy-handed tasting sweetish sauce.Fried dumplings - kind of meh.

Dan dan noodles - very few noodles compared to how much meat there was. A bit oily. The few noodles that were there were thin and did not have much 'substance' i.e.; they were lost.

Everything was super tasty! The dumplings were highly raved about. Yes they were good but I wouldn't say they were the best dumplings in the world. I have to say though, that they were super juicy. Take a bite and be careful because juices can shoooot out. That was impressive. Then the tuna poke was next. Served on rice paper which is way better than giving me some rando chips to eat it with. There was a fair amt of tuna on a bed of green seaweed (nice touch). What I enjoyed abt it was the fact that it was smothered in sesame oil and NOT the typical heavy fatty mayo most ppl make it with. Will recommend. Next were the Korean fried chicken and Brussels sprouts. The chicken was really good. Succulent and moist. It was definitely a good choice but I wouldn't say it's anything to rave about. If given the choice again, go for the wings. Brussels sprouts were good but the sauce was on the heavy side.

3.0,6/9/2016,"I came here on a whim with a friend of mine after we were searching on Yelp for a place to eat dinner.We were enticed by the four star rating and wanted to see how good it really was.We ordered two starters: Kung pao chicken wings and Vietnamese Garlic Shrimp salad.For entrees: Spring Pea Rendang and Beef Short rib kare kare noodlesDessert: halo-haloDrinks: watermelon margarita and Not so Pina Colada (can't remember the name specifically) The waiter informed us that all of these dishes are meant to be shared family style and would come out at the time that they're ready. I appreciated how patient the waiter was explaining to us how things worked and what their specials were. They were quite attentive about refilling our water glasses and taking away empty dishes etc...For me personally, I thought the food was a little too salty for me. The flavor on the Kung Pao Chicken wings was very strong, I wish I had ordered a side of rice to eat it with. The Vietnamese garlic shrimp salad also had a very strong flavor because of the fish sauce based dressing they used. I felt that the garlic on the shrimp was a little burnt making the shrimp taste a little too bitter for me. The Spring Pea Rendang was a good dish to eat after the starters because the creaminess and freshness of the vegetables really helped balance out the bolder flavors of the wings and shrimp salad. The spring peas were crisp and refreshing. The short rib kare kare tasted okay to me. Again (I feel redundant now) it tasted a little too salty for me so I found myself mixing it with the Rendang to mellow it out. However, the noodles were cooked perfectly (right amount of aldente.) My friend enjoyed the kare kare more than me though! I would say the portions are decent enough for three people to share with the amount that we ordered (two starters, two entrees, one dessert.) But probably shouldn't call it family style as we both found the dishes to be on the smaller side. Afterwards, we decided to get the halo halo which was the only dessert that they had (not sure if this is every day or just that day in particular.) It came with matcha ice cream, strawberries, jackfruit, tapioca pearls, coconut milk, and Capn Crunch cereal all on top of shaved ice. It was a massive serving, could easily serve four people. I actually enjoyed the dessert but it tasted more like cereal to me. However, take away the tapioca pearls, they were really hard, but I'm not sure if it's due to it being in a bowl with shaved ice or they just didn't cook it through enough. The drinks were just okay. My friend's Pina colada drink tasted better than mine. A bit pricey for their size. Overall, I don't think I would come back here again.

But Talde has lost its core touch and thats the people.

The dumpling we ordered was over fried on one side and the other side tender as it should be. The Pad-Thai ordered was not warm and told at the last minute of waiting that they ran out of oysters for the dish. Something is not right and the machine needs a tune-up. Talde has become the modern day F-train, something needs to be done because it can not longer sustain the volume of passengers. There is something wrong with the kitchen because what use to be NYC best Pad-Thai tasted like a sub par Pad-Thai on restaurant-row.

However, we could not justify the price points. The braised pork shoulder entree ($26) are basically char siu, roasted pork neck with sliced pear and thai basil, dressed in lemongrass and pork reduced pan jus. The yuzu guacamole ($15) is misleading as it is more like a pan-seared crispy sushi with pieces of avocado and speck, sprinkled with seaweed.

2.0,4/9/2016,"Brunch Only.Are you kidding me? Walked in and was immediately appalled by plates and dishes they use-- plastic, flowery, straight from Chinatown. The same dishes my parents used for years at home, brought in bulk and for very cheap. Usually not microwavable. We sat down in the back and noticed how tight the spaces were. My friend wasn't allowed to bring in her stroller. The place is loud and the dishes were dirty. Our plates came with diced scallions and rice bits, and our coffee cups came with residual grinds. Yuck. I checked out the bathroom and standing short at five feet two, I could not see my reflection in the mirror which is meant for people five feet six and taller. An Asian Fusion restaurant that doesn't cater much to Asians... Most of us are short... Good luck to my friend Al who is four feet eleven inches ""tall.""The food was meh... $10 for two tiny buns (think Peking duck white buns) filled with a small slice of fried avocado, daikon, and spicy mayo. The dishes during brunch are meant to be shared family style, but the portions were small. My guy friends each demolished their orders. One of my girlfriends ate most of her bacon pad thai. I felt bad to eat from other people's dishes so I didn't try that. I think the pancakes were fairly sized. The breakfast ramen tasted good, very buttery, but you immediately suspect that they've dumped a whole stick of butter into the broth...Tater tots were tater tots-- they added Sriracha to ketchup to make it a spicy ketchup. Overall, this was not a place I would return to for brunch. Much rather have dim sum or eat at a real Asian restaurant. Maybe I'm just picky, but this place just did not cater to my taste buds or comfort level. Service was okay. Our waiter wasn't remarkably friendly or cold, but at the end, another waitress kept coming over to ask if we needed anything else. Our party of eight did stay for a while, but business was slowing, so I didn't get why we had to be rushed out. Trust the poor reviews... if you're a foodie and you love brunch and Asian cuisine, you will not love this place... Sorry Talde.

5.0,4/9/2016,"Since finding out that I'm moving to Europe sooner than anticipated, I've been on a mission to eat as much inventive Asian American food as possible. Today we returned to Talde for brunch to further my foodie farewell mission. Unlike my prior visit, the restaurant was packed at 11:15am so we ate at the bar. Service was very good but it was annoying that so many of the customers were so inconsiderate about closing the door behind them when they entered so the bar had cold air constantly blowing through.But anyway, that didn't detract from the fact that the Khao Soi that I ordered was the best I've had in the city. The broth was brimming with umami goodness and just the perfect amount of heat. Delicious! I also sampled the corn pancakes, which were delightful.

GET the crab fried rice. I could not stop eating it. For a side, we got the brussel sprouts which were really tasty. After all of this, we were super full but got the dessert anyway, which was amazing too-- they called it a cookie..

For the entree, the branzino was the best dish we ordered although I've had better elsewhere.  The rest of the dishes were as I said, just OK.

2.0,2/29/2016,"Seriously over-rated. Read all the Yelp ratings and ravings and decided to try out this ""modern"" take on Korean food. The prices are high, but that does not bother me as long as food is good.Problem here is that food is forgettable (well ok, not forgettable - I remember taste of hot-sauce and nothing else, but it was so memorable that Yelp review was warranted). Every dish I tried was over-price by at leas 2X for the quality. $17 oyster\bacon pad-thai. I don't get it - boring. Bits of bacon did nothing to add or enhance flavors. Would take traditional pad-thai properly executed anyday over this.$17 Spicy Tuna Tartare - ok this one was very tasty. But no more so than a tartare from a neighborhood Japanese place at half the price.$23 Korean fried Chicken - this is plain insulting. Imagine KFC chicken - now fry it another 10 mins or so until it is super tough and then drench it in sriracha. Here is the dish that i was served. Chicken was completely boring and way over-fried, but the big issue was the hot sauce - it had no complexity of flavors, do deep flavor profile - it was straight up store bough sriracha. Which leaves your mouth burning so you'd order their over-priced cocktails.No thanks. Not again. If you are going have a pretense at an edgy\eclectic gastro-pub fare and charge those prices, you have to deliver on the food first and foremost. Talde did not execute the dishes.

5.0,2/10/2016,"The wait here is typically ridiculous, but if people are willing to wait 2 hours for a table, you should assume the food will be worth it. I've been here 3 times for dinner. The first time I waited 2 hours for a table of 4,  then I waited about 30 minutes for a table of 3 and then a few days ago I came in looking for a 2 top and the place was half empty. Obviously the earlier you come, the better your chances are of little to no wait. This review is mostly for my visit 2 days ago on a Monday night. Once seated, my date and I were approached immediately by our waiter. I think his name was Walter or Walden - something like that. Sorry man, I was there for the food. Anyway, our waiter was super friendly and helpful. He asked if either of us had any dietary restrictions and when I told him I was gluten free, he proceeded to go thorough the entire menu to tell me what was safe. I've never experienced this without specifically asking, so I was really impressed. We went with the coconut grits, Korean fried chicken and beef short rib kare kare. My date also got a Brooklyn Sling. In past orders I've also tried Obama's punch, lobster tom kah, kung pao chicken wings and wonton noodle soup.In my (brilliant food savvy) opinion, make sure to get the chicken wings, Korean fried chicken,tom kah wonton soup and coconut grits. I'd also go with obama's punch if you like a sweeter drink. Also keep in mind that the food here is SPICY. Since my spice level is ""if it's too spicy for a newborn baby, Lori probably won't be able to handle it,"" I have a tough time taking down some of these dishes. Ohhh, you must be asking why I'm telling you to get 2 orders of fried chicken. You didn't even notice that? Well, pay attention! As a person who eats gluten free, (98% of the time- unless something is really really worth the pain) fried chicken is hard to find. This place does it right.

The sauce with it was tasty and spicy.  Crab fried rice was really good and a heaping serving.  The beef short rib kare kare noodle dish, which sounded amazing, was so-so.  The beef was so finely shredded, it was mushy, and you certainly couldn't tell it was short ribs. The sauce was good, but the entire dish was soft, and sorely lacking some other textures.

We got to the restaurant at around 9:45p on a Friday night and the wait for 2 was about 45 minutes. It was packed at the bar so we decided to go a few doors down to BrookVin for a drink first. The hostess was very nice and told us to check back in, which we did about 30 minutes later and were told that our table was ready. We took our time finishing up drinks, walked back to the restaurant and the hostess immediately showed us to our table. We were starving and tipsy so what we orderswas an excessive amount for 2 people, but we couldn't decide between dishes. Everything is family style and comes out as its ready. We started with the vegetarian yuzu guacamole appetizer. It tasted like nothing I've ever had before and was absolutely delicious. About 20 minutes or so later came our entrees - we ordered the Bronzino and crab fried rice. The Branzino was the best fish I've ever had - full of flavor, cooked to perfection. It came with a side of tortillas to make tacos, but the taste was so amazing that I didn't want to mute it with tortilla. What's even better is that though it's a whole fish, it's been deboned so it's easy to eat. The crab rice was also delicious and full of crab. The kitchen was extremely accommodating and allowed us to order it without eggs and with the aioli on the side.We were so full after our meal, but given how exceptional the food was we were curious about dessert. The server told us that the only desert offering was some type of pretzel, chocolate ganache, shortbread thing. It sounded delicious, but it just wasn't. It came with four pieces and the two of us couldn't even get through one piece. The shortbread tasted like a bland, dry, cracker and the entire thing was cold like it just came out of the freezer. The table next to us ordered the same thing and it was left uneaten. Had it not been for the dessert I definitely would have given Talde 5 stars.

Although there was an hour wait (our fault, did not make reservations), we had no problem waiting and grabbed some wine around the corner.  I must highly, HIGHLY recommend the short-rib noddles.  It is one of the best flavors that have graced my palate.  Very tender and surprisingly creamy yet meaty - this is more a meat dish than a noodle dish which is perfect! The Korean fried chicken is also excellent!  VERY crispy with a kick, so expect some heat.  The prices are reasonable and portions are able to be split.  We also had the pork dumplings that were fine, but nowhere near as impressive as the entrees.  I cannot wait to come back - maybe I'll try something new OR NOT because my dinner was damn GOOD.  :)",0,0,0,Reesie R.,"Manhattan, NY",45,329,56

The food is soo delicious, I had the crab meat friend rice which was without a doubt remarkable, the portions are just perfect for two person. The Kung Pao Chicken wings were so delicious and juicy, has a bit of a kick to it but a must if you go to Talde. I also had the grilled shrimp which was so amazingly delicious and tasty, it came almost like a salad and big enough to share. The entree Whole Roasted Branzino is so perfectly prepared, well seasoned and just perfect, i don't normally eat fish when i go out for dinner, but i decided to try it this time and I was not disappointed, it was the most delicious entree by far.The drinks are just right as well, very unique and perfectly mixed, great bartender.

5.0,11/30/2015,"Delicious food. A friend and I came here for a catch-up dinner and by the end of dinner we both kept talking about how delicious the food was. Beautiful dark-mahogany type decor. I love the dark feeling of it and it's great that you can see the chefs / cooks in the kitchen, it puts perspective to the food you will be enjoying when you eat. Service - great if not a little too much. Our waiter was very attentive and kept checking up on us about every 3 minutes. I appreciate the over-attentiveness. We got our food and drinks extremely quickly as well - just about the quickest I've ever gotten a drink in a restaurant. BBQ Negroni: Negroni's itself are a bit of a different kind of animal and takes a bit of getting used to. That being said, I had a different friend introduce me to negroni's and they are delicious. So, seeing a BBQ negroni on the menu I had to get it. Very nicely done, I enjoyed it quite a bit - I would recommend it though it takes some getting used to. Now to the food: Samosas - It was ok at best. While they did taste good, they were not the highlight of the evening. Just kinda meh for me. Spicy Tuna Tartare - It comes with a side of 'scallion pancakes.' Scallion pancakes is not quite accurate as it is some freshly fried sticky-ish dough, but the tuna tartare was fantastic. Highly recommended. Crispy Oyster and Bacon Pad Thai - Holy crap I love this. My friend is a vegetarian but we requested the bacon on the side ( JUST FOR ME) and man does bacon on the side spice things up! Great oysters in the dish, I would say just be wary of the pieces of red pepper in it. I tolerate hot foods quite well, but I was choking up just a tad when I ate the entire red pepper. Just be a little careful.... but ORDER THIS DISH. Whole roasted branzino - I'm usually not someone who orders fish but as my friend didn't eat meat we ordered. It is DELICIOUS - I do not regreat this dish whatsoever. It's a tossup between this or the pad thai which was my favorite for the night. This branzino is served in a banana leaf and comes with mini soft taco shells so you can make your own taco. This dish is fantastic - I highly recommend getting this. I just loved the entire experience here overall. Great food - I would love to come back.",18,11,14,Gloria C.,"Bensonhurst, NY",140,208,122
1.0,11/30/2015,"We were loyal customer until recently, because we've been noticing that the service has changed, unfortunately what seems for good. Dale is nowhere to be found; there is a new chef every week, and his manager needs to be told buh-bye. Not sure what was his name (Michael, I believe).  Our last visit to this place was suppose to be special, and not to get sentimental or reveal too much, but let's just say, it has been our first time in a while that we were able to leave the house without our newborn. So we ordered some appetizers to start with (our usual and favorite sliders were no longer on the menu- bummer!) and branzino with some side dishes (rice/veggies of the day). The waiter was nice and accommodating, but food was coming out erratically. We received appetizers with a fish, which was cold by the time we finished our appetizer. I hate to be rushed and this was one of those things. We ate our appetizer quickly, so there was a good chance that the fish was cold to begin with. We sent the fish back, and of course shortly after the rice was delivered. So I was quite upset and apparently someone had the manager come over and talk to us. So I asked the guy, if this is Talde's standard to bring out food that is cold and the main course not being served with main course's side dishes? He apologized for the cold fish and said that it is being refired as we speak, however, he would lie to my face saying that they bring food out as it becomes ready. He kept saying that if rice is done first, it will be brought out without the fish. I kept saying would Dave (I misspoke the owners name, but he knew I was referring to his boss- a somewhat celebrity chef that appeared on the Top Chef TV show- DALE Talde). So he snootily corrects me and I ignore as this was not the point of the argument. There was no scene, but as he was making up the excuses, I completely shut off. We quietly finished the food that finally came all at once per our request and we were ready to leave soon after. The bas**rd manager did not even come back to us; he sent that poor waitress to tell us that we do not need to pay and that it is covered. We left her a generous tip as this whole ordeal was not her fault, and we wanted her to know that.  I would have paid for that food regardless, but they certainly lost us as customers forever, unless we see DALE behind that pass. Some of my close friends who independently of my story turned from being loyal customers to unhappy ones. Dale, needs to do something to salvage this asap.

And the ambient noise peaks at a roar around 8 p.m., making conversation at indoor level volume impossible. But the main problem was with the service. I brought some friends/colleagues who were visiting from out of town to eat here. We wanted to have a leisurely meal in order to catch up on work-related matters, so we arrived for an early dinner at 6.30 pm, in order to avoid the peak crowds. But the waitstaff has clearly been instructed to focus on pushing diners to order as much as possible and turn the tables over quickly, rather than make sure they have a pleasant experience. The busboy interrupted our conversation several times to reach across the table in an attempt to clear away dishes that were not yet finished, forcing us to stop our conversation and tell him that we weren't finished yet. This happened at least five times. When we *were* done eating our main course, as indicated by the empty plates, the busboy leaped over to clear. Finally, a few minutes of uninterrupted conversation! But no. There was no respite from the constant interruptions. Not 15 seconds had passed before the server re-appeared to ask us about dessert. Since we were in the middle of a conversation, we looked up and told her we needed a few minutes. Instead of returning with dessert menus, she returned withe the cheque -- which we had not asked for. We actually did want dessert and coffee. But she just dropped the cheque on the table and walked away. My colleagues were shocked. I was embarrassed because I had suggested the restaurant.

I have been here twice now and the first time, I enjoyed the food and ambiance here, but the second time blew me away even more. This place is perfect for a date or a couple friends catching up. It's located in South Slope which is a really nice area in Brooklyn. It's right on the corner or 7th ave and 11th street. The staff is very friendly and attentive. The venue is on the small side but it's spacious enough for you to be comfortable at your table. My friend and I ordered 2 appetizers to share, the Kung Pao wings 6 pieces for $9, which were {expletive} amazing!!! And the pork dumplings, 4 pieces for $8, which were also good. I had the Thai starr drink at $13 which tastes really good and gets better as you drink it. I highly recommend the Kung Pao wings, they are crunchy and moist at the same time with a flavor that is mind blowing. My friend and I could not stop raving about how good they were. We were tempted to pig out and order some to go home but we decided against it and figure we will be coming back here sometime soon anyway so we'll hold out for that, although it will be hard lol.For our meals, my friend had the Kale salad which I sampled and it tasted very good, full of flavor. I had the vegetable fried rice (a nice large plate) and asked them to customize it and add egg in it. It was phenomenal and $8 bucks! For all of this, our total bill came out to under $64! My friend and I were expecting it to be more and were pleasantly surprised. In a nutshell, please, please, come here! You will be so glad you did. The service is just as excellent as the food is.

We only waited maybe 10-15 minutes, and the bar/waiting area is really pretty. With everyone's preferences and dietary restrictions, we abandoned the ""sharing"" mentality and all went selfishly for exactly what appealed to us. I ordered the Pretzel, Pork & Chive Dumplings, and the Beef Short Rib Kare Kare (noodles). Both were delicious. I loved the surprising pretzel flavors in the dumplings - and the spicy mustard paired along with the dumplings was killer. So spicy and head-clearing! The Short Rib Kare Kare was a gamble for me, as my tolerance of peanut butter in savory dishes is iffy at best - but the balanced flavors of the dish were perfect. The extremely thin noodles paired with the succulent, tender braised short rib made for a hearty and tasty dish.Service was decent - not extremely personal, but efficient and capable.

The dish was very flavorful and had a lot of sauce (sweet with a hint of bacon taste!). Although this is not the traditional pad thai, it was definitely one of the best i've had before. I actually did not care too much for the oyster and bacon pieces..2. Kung Pao Chicken - 5/5 Stars. This was such a surprising delight (beware of chili peppers) and came with a lot of sauce. This dish had such an interesting sauce unlike the other korean fried chicken wings. It was sweet, crunchy, spicy and they give a large portion.3. Korean Fried Chicken - 3.7/5 Stars. After trying the kung pao chicken, this was pretty disappointing. The sauce was quite unique (in a good way) and the chicken was standard, not dry. This is quite expensive ($23.00) but they give just enough for you to be full. 4. Pretzel Pork & Chive Dumplings - 3/5 Stars. Nothing special. Tastes like dumplings. Since it IS $8.00, I would not recommend this..5. Yuzu Guac - 4/5 Stars. The presentation of this appetizer is beautiful! The bottom of this piece seems to be this kind of crunchy rice and it is topped with a piece of prosciutto and some guacemole. Definitely a whole lot in a small bite. I would recommend this as an appetizer.6. Samosa - 4/5 Stars. Again, tastes like a regular samosaaaa! Tastes good but i would not order it here..7. Tamale - 1/5 Stars. After all the delicious food i had here, this was a shocking disappointment!! I cannot even describe how completely awful this dish was. The dish was very bland and had the texture of apple sauce.

Yuzu guacamole, what do I say about this dish, it was all kinds of l good, the crispy rice at the bottom perfectly compliments the creamy guac and yuzu is like the bomb that will blow your mind. The kale salad had some kind of amazing dressing, I never have kale salads when there is fried chicken on the table, but I kept going back.

I cite that date because I might have seen divinity in that Lobster Tom Kha. Sweet corn, tender chunks of lobster, perfect chew on the rice noodles.  But that broth! Whoever was in the kitchen that night was not timid, and went after that balance of salty, sweet, spicy, tart HARD! It was a successful fusion of lobster corn chowder with punchy spicy citrus flavors very reminiscent of bun bo hue.  Clearly my favorite dish of the night! So much so, our neighboring diners asked what we ordered to get the same thing. Turns out, they were going to leave, feeling indifferent when they read the menu, but opted to stay having seen the fury I went after the bowl!  They were also very pleased with the choice.The Kung Pow chicken wings were also delicious. Tossed in the right amount of savory sauce so they're still crispy, and I'm a sucker for crunchy peanuts.Personally, I could have stopped there. The Korean fried chicken was tasty, though the breast meat was a tad dry. The crab fried rice was good, but paled in comparison to the described above. The bulgogi, which does not appear to be on the menu anymore, was the only disappointment.  The beef was temperate, not sizzling hot as I had expected, tossed in sauce that was rather bland and watery compared to Korean bbq I've had.If you enjoy punchy flavors, go for that soup.

My personal favorites are always the pork pretzel dumplings, I've had many a great kale salad (even if this is become very trite in Brooklyn), the whole fish, and a crispy flat noodles that are fried to perfection on one side so they're chewy, and crispy all at the same time. I've been consistently underwhelmed by the oyster pad Thai and the fried chicken. Which is sad because the should be my two favorite things on the menu.

Asian-fusion is also, in my opinion, never good. There are just too many unique flavors in Asian cuisine that blending them diminishes the tastes of each country and region. I'm Thai and grew up eating EVERYTHING Asian (it was very rare that we went out for Italian or American, for example), dining at authentic establishments in Flushing and elsewhere in Queens; I think I know my Asian and this is just wack-sauce (literally). And why is the wait over an hour ALL THE TIME? We only keep going back here because we keep getting $200 gift cards from people thinking we enjoy it. We don't. I appreciate the thought and generosity, but it is money poorly spent. The place is large, but small and crowded, like you're sitting on top of one another. The music is also just too loud to hear each other speak, but maybe that's a good thing cuz then the couple sitting next to you (read: on top of you) won't be able to eavesdrop accidentally.

3.0,7/14/2015,"This is an update to my previous review, below, from April 2012.  I so want to like/love this place. It's so visually appealing with those cute orange tables on the sidewalk in warm months and amazing container plantings year round. But the kitchen! Come on guys....it's been years and you still haven't figured it out, even on a relatively slow summer night. I can't take issue with our server - he was so nice and clearly embarrassed. It should not have taken an HOUR for the tuna tartare to appear. (We finally cancelled it because we knew all the food  would quickly follow, and it did).  Service was pretty good. The food, when it actually arrived, was mostly pretty good. Chow fun with pork shoulder (I think)...delicious.  The Korean fried chicken dish was overcooked this time, served with less sauce, and just not a hit. Another pork shoulder dish with watermelon was delicious, spicy...very nice on a summer evening. The crab fried rice was tasty-ish but mushy, and made me long for the kimchee fried rice at Purple Yam in Ditmas Park. We skipped the Halo Halo dessert. Once was enough for me. Once again. Talde failed to impress, and once again I'm bummed.-----------------------------------------------------------previous review from April 2012My second visit and I'm still underwhelmed. I want to like it more.  Went again last night. Pork sausage sliders were the highlight. Maybe we should have stopped there. Soft bun, crispy pork. tangy/spicy sauce. Perfect.  The pretzel dumplings weren't significantly different from any other  dumplings, except for the pretzel salt on the dumpling wrapper. And all that gives you is salty dumplings. Shrimp toast didn't excite me. It felt heavily caloric but not that flavorful and the chunky gravy in the little jug was bland.  I love pad thai but I found this mushy, salty and longing for a real pad thai from any of the local Thai joints on 7th Ave.  The Korean fried chicken was delicious. Perfectly cooked, crispy skin, but floating in an odd orange sauce - buffalo wing sauce? with cut grapes scattered on the plate. I like grapes. I don't know that they belonged in a pool of orange buffalo wing sauce. Keep the chicken, Lose the weird sauce and grape combo.  And the Halo Halo dessert. Oh dear. My teeth still.hurt. And that's coming from a sugar junkie. I wish there were more desset offerings besides that Halo Halo.  Still, service was very friendly and efficient, I like the vibe, and they're clearly trying. It's been so popular since day one I'm sure they're just trying to keep up. But I really hope they fine tune the menu, lose the salt, add  desserts,put some vegetables on the menu and I can see this place being a solid 4 out of 5 stars.",0,1,0,Finola K.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,124,45

3.0,7/11/2015,"I saw this resto on tv years back and always wanted to eat their pork dumplings. Huge fan of dumplings. So here I find myself in south slope years later sorting out my cravings. Pork pretzel dumplings - crispy. Meaty. Well seasoned. I liked it mucho except for the strong pork taste. Perhaps if they marinated the pork for a longer time? Who knows. But I would eat this again. Pretty yummy!Spicy chicken wings. Yes. Very tasty. Not spicy at all. Amazing sauce and a generous portion. A definite item to start. Wanton noodles - not great. Not worth the hype. The wantons were undercooked so the powdery coating on the dumpling skin was very apparent. The noodles too were undercooked. I loved the broth however, down to the last drop. Not worth 14$ Pork shoulder with watermelon - fantastic. I loved this.  Great portion and melon was refreshing. Oysters pad Thai - the pad Thai was deliciously flavored for a dish that lacked ingredients to beef it up, like egg shreds or meat shred.  There were only rice noodles and veggies alongside 3 (cheap) fried oysters. For the price, I would have expected more meat in the dish.  The oysters did not have any flavor. Very disappointing. Drinks here are great. Pricey but yummy. Service staff very friendly and helpful.

3.0,6/15/2015,"My boyfriend was really excited to try this place so I took him here for his birthday. However, we both left a bit disappointed. The food and drinks just weren't as good as we had hoped.For drinks, we had the Navy Grog and this Thai drink that I forgot the name of. The drinks took forever to come out and came out after we had finished off our appetizer. I guess it's cause they had 2 bartenders. The Navy Grog was very bland. It didn't taste like anything and had a weird after taste. It must be the honey syrup. It wasn't very tasty and tasted like cough medicine. The Thai one was ok. It was green, pretty to look at, and tasted like anise. I wasn't too much of a fan. I don't think both had much alcohol, as I didn't feel it in me and usually I would feel it since I'm very sensitive to alcohol. Also we sat at the bar for a bit and noticed that the bartenders didn't seem to put much at all. We had the pretzel dumplings as our only appetizer. It was not good at all. I thought it was bitter, I guess from the mustard dipping sauce, and the skin was kind of hard, like dumplings that have been sitting on the grill for too long. For the taste, I would so prefer to eat regular dumplings from Prosperity Dumplings. I didn't find it to be tasty at all and it was pretty pricey at $8 for 4.The Pad Thai came out next and it was decent. It was a bit salty and tasted like a load of fish sauce and wasn't very unique, as it tasted like other noodles that I've had before at other Thai places. The fried oysters were very bland however. It had no flavor at all whatsoever, so you pretty much had to eat it with the noodles, yet eating them together doesn't enhance the oyster flavors at all, since there were none.We also had the Korean fried chicken and the pork shoulder. The Korean fried chicken was pretty good, but I don't know if I would pay over $20 for fried chicken. The sauce was good, but reminded me of Frank's hot sauce haha. The white parts of the chicken were dry though. Similarly, the pork shoulder was a bit dry. Flavor wise, it was ok, but nothing really stood out. It was a bit too salty again. These dishes don't come with any sides, so it's best to order some white rice to go with this. Otherwise, it's just too salty to eat on it's own. For dessert, don't order! The only dessert they had on the menu the time we went was the halo halo. It was probably the blandest halo halo ever. It had no flavor, and it tasted so strongly of lime zest. It was not enjoyable at all. I just can't believe this is what they call dessert and actually served it. It really tastes like sh!t. Don't be fooled by the captain crunch. It does nothing to the dessert. Such a disappointing dinner. The pork and chicken had good flavors but I wish it was moister. Other than that, the other dishes seemed to have failed. That's why I'm always iffy about Asian fusion cuisine. It's pricey and the flavors all taste like something I've had before and nothing special about it. Also, the area I was sitting at was cold and had a lot of ac coming down. Every time food was served, it immediately got cold.

4.0,6/10/2015,"We came here for a late-ish date night and left feeling buzzed and gleefully stuffed. :)Talde is tucked right on the corner of 7th ave and 11th street. It's away from the hubbub of 5th Ave, however, it definitely can get loud inside (even on an off-night). It's not the place for a quite, romantic dinner per se. The drinks are fantastic. My favorites are the:      - BBQ Negroni: I am not a gin-drinker but dang this cocktail was remarkably smooth and clean-tasting. The ""smoked"" vermouth is definitely not overbearing.      - Ginger Rose: all hail to the mighty bourbon. I was thoroughly impressed by our waiters. Both were informative and we ended up going with their recos for our entrees, apps and sides. Talde builds its philosophy around communal eating (tying into hot pot, tapas, etc.). We ordered:   - Kale Salad: yes, we ordered the kale salad and we do not regret it at all. It's kale three ways - grilled, cooked and raw. The slivers of cantalope and beets were an A+ companion.    - Korean Fried Chicken: does this need an explanation? Fantastic meat and the spicy yogurt sauce deserves three ""thumbs up"" emoji icons   - Wok Fried Market Veggies: A bit heavier than expected in terms of the oil but you can never go wrong with bok choy.We're definitely going back!

Or maybe you're a couple that digs sharing pitchers of, say, Obama's Punch (rum, vodka, curaçao, vanilla, blood orange) while splitting plates of Crispy Oyster Bacon Pad Thai? Or perhaps you're a solo foodie that loves drinking white wine and eating Pretzel Pork and Chive Dumplings at a bar overlooking the kitchen. Whatever your ilk, Talde has you covered.I was here a week ago and marveled at the well-oiled machine it's become. Packed to capacity (about 65 folks) the kitchen was not only cool and collected, but dishing out perfect flavorful plates that you wish would never end.This time around, Kim and I started with the Vietnamese Garlic Shrimp. A thing of beauty, for sure. Subtle char on the shrimp, harmonious mix of flavors and texture with pomelo, escarole, and yummy peanuts. It's a dish that screams summer.Next up, we shared a huge bowl of Wanton Noodle Soup like you've never had before - unless you've been to Talde for brunch and had buttered toast Ramen. This ain't fast food wanton soup, fo shizzle. A deliciously opaque broth permeates soft noodles and pork wantons, bitter greens, pork belly, a delectable six minute egg, and two customers with giant smiles wrapped around their heads.We finished with Korean Fried Chicken with spicy kimchee yogurt and mint, balanced perfectly with, of all things, grapes. Absolute crispy genius.We were too stuffed for dessert, although I can eat their Halo-Halo till the cows come home. Now truth be told, I'm accustomed to over-doing it here, especially for brunch. For me, heaven is a seat by the window with my girl and way too many plates on the table. A pot of french press coffee, Breakfast Ramen, Tator Tots with sriracha ketchup, Sausage, Egg, and Cheese Fried Rice, Roti, and Kung Pao Chicken Wings with Waffles. I can always buy a new belt when this one runs out of holes.Talde is definitely the best of Dale and company's mini-empire which  also includes Pork Slope and Thistle Hill in Brooklyn. I'm looking forward to seeing how his new place in Jersey City carries the torch - and if those folk are hip enough to know a good thing when they put it in their mouths.In the meantime, Dale has paved the way for other adventurous spots in South Slope like Chris Cheung's eternally tasty East Wind Snack Shop and a brand new joint called The Tuscan Gun by Cooking Channel's Gabriele Corcos. It's a good time to know what's good.",1,1,2,Eric C.,"Brooklyn, NY",43,34,11

5.0,4/21/2015,"I was excited to come here after my friend (an employee here) told me about and proceeded to tell me it was owned by Chef Dale Talde of Top Chef. I'm usually a little wary of asian fusion places, but I decided to trust them.I'm glad I did! The service was great. The host was polite and our servers have always been friendly. As a former employee in the restaurant industry, I can appreciate when servers do things by the book. She gave a run down of the menu, her recommendations, and got us started with waters without having to be asked. We were also given extra napkins after ordering messier items and our plates were cleared off in a timely manner. Lastly, our waters were always being refilled. When my boyfriend and I came here, we got a bit excited and ordered a lot. To start, we had the pretzel pork & chive dumplings. A solid choice, and the sauce had a nice kick to it. We also ordered the Kung Pao chicken & waffles and Bacon pad thai as entrees as well as the sausage egg & cheese fried rice. The chicken and waffles perfectly complimented each other. You'd expect chicken with a name like that to be super hot and spicy. It was spicy, but nothing I couldn't manage! (And I have a pretty low tolerance for that). The waffles were sweet and had a sweet syrup. The bacon pad thai had a great bacon taste, though it wasn't overpowering. A pad thai well done! The sausage egg and cheese was kind of addicting. It sounds so simple, but the flavors were on point and the rice was cooked perfectly. We were also given lobster baos on the house! A little small, but I don't think I could have finished it if it were any larger! The place itself has a lot of elements that remind me of home - even the plates are ones that I could see at my own house. Everything was served family style, so that definitely adds to the homey feel. I like the wood details around the restaurant, and the booths add a privacy element.

5.0,4/20/2015,"I came to this restaurant under the recommendation of my girlfriend, Michelle, and ever since, it has been one of my favorite restaurants in NYC (top 3). Unfortunately, they do not take reservations, but that already tells you how packed this place can get. Luckily, Michelle has a friend who's an employee there and was able to get us a table right away! We grabbed drinks at the bar while we waited for our tables, I got the Six point Bengali Tiger and Michelle ordered the Lychee Martini which wasn't too strong but had a nice kick to it.Before we even came to the restaurant we already knew we were ordering the Bacon Pad Thai, so we did! It was some really good Pad Thai, there were bacon lardons in the mix which added a lot of umami to it and it was to die for. It was accompanied by some Kung Pao Chicken & Waffles, and I've got to tell you, the highlights of this dish were the waffles which were fluffy and flavorful and the syrup! I have no idea how they made the syrup but it wasn't only sweet, but savory and creamy as well! I'm going to have to ask for that recipe next time around. Finally we ordered the sausage egg and cheese fried rice, and if you don't live in NYC, the bacon/sausage, egg & cheese sandwich is a NYC staple, so this was a must, and it again, packed with flavor! The chef then decided that that wasn't enough food for 2 people so he gave us Lobster Bao's on the house! I was beyond ecstatic! Not only did we get great food, we got the best of the best service, servers knew the menu in and out, and we're confident in their recommendations.

5.0,4/20/2015,"Great experience. Okay, so we had to dine at 5:30 in order to avoid having to wait for a table, but it was worth it.For a party of two, we ordered the pork and pretzel dumplings, roti bread, lobster tom kha, and Korean fried chicken. The dumplings were a tad on the greasy side, but still yummy (loved the pretzel filling). The roti was great. The lobster tom kha was perfect with just the right amount of heat. The chicken was just slightly on the dry side, but slathering it with that (freakin' delicious) sauce made up for it. I went back and forth between 4 and 5 stars, but landed on 5 solely for that sauce. Soo good. And the grapes on the chicken to cool everything down was a very smart addition. Service was perfect.

1.0,4/19/2015,"Oh man I used to love Talde. In January I gave them a great yelp review....  I'd travel from Harlem to come here regularly, and when my in-laws were coming to town from out of state, I made the suggestion we go there. After my experience there this weekend, I will never go back.Where do I begin?  Our service completely ruined our meal.  We had a reservation (a party of 6 or more) and we were still asked to wait for our table...which was an issue since we were with elderly people who needed to sit and the bar was packed.Oh well, we were patient about the (relatively short) wait for our table. Then we sat and waited an 1 hour, and 45 minutes for our food.  This was a 9pm reservation, so by the time we got 80% of our food it was 10:45pm.First our waiter brought us the wrong wine (unapologetically).... then he couldn't keep track of our very simple order, and we were super understanding and patient, but it became really uncomfortable because he honestly couldn't keep track of who ordered what and had to keep ask us to repeat ourselves to the point that it seemed really weird. When he got uncomfortable with how mixed up he was, another wait staff member came by and said our original waiter ""had to go home because he had an early shift the next day"" but then the original waiter remained ALL NIGHT serving other tables.  Why lie to us like we are idiots? It's not a big restaurant, so the fact that we'd been lied to became very clear. It seemed completely unnecessary to lie and as a result, we just felt like he was avoiding us and WE had somehow done something wrong.  Our food then  all came out at different times (one member of our party was done with her meal before someone else's appetizer came out) and the waiter blamed the extensive wait for the great majority of the food on the fact that we didn't want to share dishes and this is a ""dim sum style restaurant meant to share"".The manager apologized personally to a member of our party when someone went and spoke to her privately (in order to not cause a scene or gang up on the wait staff). While she apologized and said she didn't realize our wait was so long, she didn't remove a thing from our bill, throw in a free dessert or even bother to come apologize to our table for having to wait until 11pm to eat our dinner when we had a 9pm reservation.When I left, I was embarrassed that Talde was my suggestion and the food couldn't come close to making up for the terrible feeling of being ignored, lied to and dismissed.  The cherry on top was that the hostess and another waitress were enjoying drinks at the bar on our way out, meanwhile we'd been feeling bad that maybe the staff was in the weeds and just under-staffed that night.Because of their terrible customer service, I won't go back.  One of my favorites is now sadly crossed off my list.",2,1,0,Jennifer P.,"New York, NY",0,8,0

2.0,4/13/2015,"Talde is the gastronomic brainchild of Top Chef Dale Talde and partners David Massoni and John Bush. The decor and location are wonderful, perfect for outdoor brunch or a fun date. The food is ""Asian American"" with Korean, Thai, Chinese, Filipino, and Japanese flavors melding with some American ingredients. Perry and I showed up at 6:00 on a Sunday and put our names in for a 40 minute wait. We went for a walk to kill time. The bar is open and friendly and the hostess was on top of things, but there really isn't a place to stand and wait. You're going to be in the way, no matter what. True to her word, we were seated 40 minutes later. The dining room is beautiful, with an impressive collection of Asian mahogany wood-carvings that was salvaged from an antiques warehouse. Juxtapose the dark wood with the gigantic picture windows that look out on 7th Ave and the place feels magical. There are less than 100 seats, so it can feel intimate at times. However, the acoustics are a bit loud.Perry and I ordered:Kung pao chicken wingsShort rib kare kareOyster and bacon pad thaiMarket veggie - brussel sproutsThe kung pao chicken wings were a good starter, fried sweet and spicy sticky morsels. They come with a moistened napkins to clean up with, which is a great thought. The fried oysters and bacon pad thai is really really tasty. Most Americanized pad thai is overly sweet. The smoky bacon flavor actually enhances the sweet and savory components. The vinegar based hot sauce at the table also boosts the spicy content if you need it. The oysters, while tasty, were more a fun bonus to the dish than really complementing anything. After that, everything else we tried sucked. We didn't even want the leftovers. The short rib kare kare was very one note in flavor and in texture. The short ribs were tender and the noodles were prepared well. But it was completely forgettable and lacked depth. The brussel spouts were fried with a tart cream of some kind, with the consistency of mayo, but more sour. Maybe a herby yogurt? I really didn't like it. The brussel sprouts lacked the green sweet flavor of cabbage and just tasted bitter and sour.  I would come again for the pad thai and if there was no wait. But otherwise, the items we ordered just let us down.",1,0,0,Suanne L.,"Brooklyn, NY",198,979,842

5.0,4/11/2015,"If you appreciate highly flavorful, perfectly prepared Asian ""spin"" cooking, then this place, will knock your proverbial socks off. First off, Brussel sprouts with ""white"" Sambal- Killer, hit all the  right notes of spice, heat, lemongrass using a crispy fried Brussel sprout as the ""substrate"".  The chef here, likes to play, is serious about his flavor, but maintains a good sense of humor all the while- You got your Korean ingredients, Thai ingredients, Chinese, etc, all playing nice with each other in a Asian Mosh-pit of a menu. The unpretentious, yet refined food is served up on, kitschy, cheap-assed, Chinese print Melamine plates. Funny. Kung Pao wings- Crispy-sticky, spicy heaven. Korean Fried chicken, really tasty, Pretzel pork & chive dumplings- These could have been a little more Pretzelish, but were tasty just the same. Yuzu laced Guacamole on crispy rice cakes was incredible- Smooth & Spicy, crispy-chewy, salty, sweet all at the same time. Bomb! Whole roasted Branzino in a Banana leaf was a seriously delicious, over-the top dish that worked on every level. Crispy oyster and bacon Pad Thai was a welcome spin from the usual, most mundane, over-done noodle dish in the Thai repertoire, but chef Talde gives it a  Bacon/Fried oyster treatment that was memorable.  Cashew coconut fried rice was the best version of that dish ever. This restaurant reminds me of another place in San Antonio, called Hot Joy, only the cooking is more focused and better executed. Worth noting, They make their own condiments for the table, like a spicy Sriracha type sauce, and a house made chile vinegar.  When in Brooklyn's Park Slope neighborhood, don't miss it.

There are some really good plates like the dumplings and the wonton noodle soup. But they're just short of 'wow'. And then there were the #369 vegetable side that happened to be Brussels sprouts, which were way too salty and oily. I find myself skeptical of the fusion label. When we first walked in and saw the Kuzu Guacamole or the Beef Short Rib Kare Kare, we wondered if they were just playing mad libs and hoping something would stick. But they actually worked really well if it wasn't for the fact that things were just a little too heavily seasoned--this felt like pandering. Everything is family style. The service was fantastic.

It is now!  Came here for dinner on a Friday night. The hostess quoted a 30 minute wait, which soon after turned into immediate seating at the chef's table.  The chef's table is counter seating with a view of the kitchen, which is actually awesome and WAY better than a table because it's roomier and you get to watch the chefs in action. The restaurant menu is a treat to read, as literally every single item on the menu sounds delicious and you'll want to order all of them. We managed to narrow it down to the pretzel dumplings, crispy oyster and bacon Pad Thai, beef short rib, and Brussels sprouts (which was the market vegetable that night). Pretty much if you can manage it, ordering one dish from each list is a good idea.The pretzel dumplings had a standard pork and chive filing, but the super crispy skin added nice texture and invoked the pretzel element with the mustard dipping sauce. The Brussels sprouts were crazy flavorful! Fried with ground anchovies, they had this salty greasy tangy fishy taste that was pretty amazing. I did feel like this dish would be a little overwhelming on its own, though. Luckily, we had the oyster and bacon Pad Thai to offset the veggies. This ended being my favorite dish of the night. The combination of fried oysters with the noodles and smokey bits of bacon was insanely delicious. The hot sauce and pickled pepper oil at the table go well with this dish.  The beef short rib was tender, not particularly well seasoned, but it tasted great when accompanied with the tamarind sauce and bits of pumpkin.All in all it was just an amazingly good meal and I would definitely come back to try out the other dishes.",1,0,0,Steph C.,"Brooklyn, NY",478,767,323

This seemed strange to me since  the restaurant is quite spacious and typically accommodates large number of people with food served in a family style. Despite our restless children we decided to stay on only to find out that waiter forgot one of our ordered items.

5.0,3/21/2015,"I'm so mad at myself for not coming here sooner. Talde has literally been on my to-do list since 2012, when I heard an interview with Dale on Dinner Party Download, where he explained how he came up with the idea of the pretzel dumpling. Basically, his whole philosophy is to make food that his inner fat kid would want to eat. And the menu definitely reflects that and delivers on that promise.As expected, it was pretty crowded on a Friday, though most people were at the bar/waiting area in the front (where you can also order food). Our hostess told us it would be around 30 minutes for a table, but then 5 minutes later told us there was seating available at the ""chef's table"". The chef's table was actually a wonderful dining experience. It was a counter next to the window into the kitchen, where you could watch everyone do their work. Seemed like they had a pretty efficient system.Anyway, I wasn't going to leave Talde without ordering the pretzel dumplings. They were super crispy due to the skin, but it wasn't actually that pretzel-y. The pork and chive filling was pretty standard, like you'd get at any first-rate Chinese dumpling spot. The spicy mustard sauce was a great complement though, very horseradish-y.On their menu, they also have a side listed as #369 market vegetables (the name an homage to Chinese restaurant takeout menus and their street address). As soon as we walked into the dining room, I knew I smelled Brussels sprouts, and possibly with fish sauce. I was pretty close. The veggies of the day were Brussels sprouts with anchovies. The anchovies were ground into a fine paste, with added a grainy texture to the deep fried Brussels. It was probably my favorite dish that we had.Our waitress also told us that the noodles and mains were served family style, so her recommendation was one per person.We had the crispy oyster and bacon pad thai, which was actually a pretty big dish. I'm not usually a fan of oyster fritters, but these were great, especially with the house hot sauce (a vinegar-y sauce akin to what they usually have available at dumpling restaurants. There were tiny bits of thick cut bacon sprinkled throughout, which was always a pleasant surprise when you stumbled across one. Very smokey, and added some great fatty flavor to the dish. Definitely satisfied my inner fat kid. Instead of sprinkling lime juice on top, I would recommend the pickled pepper sauce.To round out the meal, we also had the beef short rib, served in a tamarind and pumpkin sauce. There were tiny bits of pumpkin underneath the beef, but I didn't really get too much of the flavor in the sauce itself. The beef was thinly cut, similar to what you'd get at a Vietnamese restaurant over vermicelli. The beef itself wasn't the greatest, but it went really well with the house hot sauce. There were also super thinly cut green apple slices on top of the beef, which was interesting, but not entirely necessary.Everything was served with mini-tongs, which if you know anything about the innerworkings of Asian restaurants or supermarkets, are one of the most versatile tools.Anyway, I would gladly recommend Talde to anyone who likes pan-Asian cuisine. Even though a lot of the dishes were combinations you'd never think of before, it's all very accessible.",11,5,5,Kenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",884,3337,12015

5.0,3/15/2015,"4.5This has been on my 'to try' list forever and my expectations were high....let's just say i was not disappointed.We arrived on a Saturday night for an early dinner around 5:30.  The place was bustling with a family crowd, but we were seated immediately.  I would say by 6:15 the place was at capacity and people were waiting for tables.Our waitress was energetic and pretty awesome.  She knew her stuff and was able to give insight on the cocktails; speaking of which were incredible.  The BBQ Negroni is not your run of the mill bitter bomb, but has a slight sweetness balanced with a hint of smoke.  Not being a Negroni fan myself,  I liked it.  The Basil Margarita was light and fresh and really well balanced.  The GInger Rose had a warmer flavor profile, but was equally great.  While they are a bit on the pricey side, don't pass up the cocktails.Dishes are meant for sharing, which I am always a fan of.  My only complaint, and I use that term lightly, is that the food came out really fast, so we had every dish at the table at once.  They could have been spread out just a bit, but once I started eating I really didn't care.Kung Pao Chicken Wings are served with a buttermilk ranch, these are messy wings, but are excellent.  A decent amount of sweet and spicy heat which is offset by the ranch.  They are totally finger licking good.Crispy Oyster & Bacon Pad Thai; I have an issue with this dish.  I fear that Pad Thai has now been ruined for me forever. This dish is out of this world.  The crispy oysters were fried to perfection and melted in your mouth.  The smokiness and indulgence that the bacon adds to the noodles is nothing like I have experienced before.  This is a dish that you must order, if you think you are not into this dish, you may be at the wrong restaurant.Filipino Pork adorned with pickled papaya was full of flavor and so tender. It's one of those things that looks standard, but once you taste it you realize it is anything but.Crab Fried Rice was excellent.  There was something addictive about it and it went really well with the pork.Getting here from Queens is not an easy task, but it was totally worth it and i would do it again.  Now I'll go back to dreaming about that Pad Thai and wondering if I'll be able to enjoy the traditional version ever again.",3,2,2,Krista M.,"Kew Gardens, NY",353,719,289

4.0,2/15/2015,"Solid food. Verdict from the first visit: would definitely return again.Pad Thai with bacon: awesome. Even without the bacon bits, the Pad Thai alone was delicious, but the thick bacon bits made it that much better. Plus, the egg on top. Noodles were fresh and looked like they might have been hand cut, although not sure about that one.Breakfast ramen: highly recommend. Hearty without being too over the top. Not too light but light enough for it to be considered breakfast food. Unique broth flavor that you wouldn't get at your typical ramen shop. Good quality noodles. Again, bacon bits. May be considered somewhat salty for some.Chicken and waffles: good. The waffle was fluffy and had a great texture to it. The chicken was good but slightly salty for my taste. I think if anything, it went better with the waffles than it would have as a standalone dish, since the sweet and salty balanced each other. The sauce for the chicken also had a nice, slightly spicy (but not too spicy) kick to it.Lobster bao: alright. I love lobster so I didn't really have a problem with this dish, but didn't particularly wow me.Pretzel pork and chive dumpling: not bad, but if I chose not to order something from this review, it would be this one. I didn't dislike it, but it's not something that I would necessarily return for.I also liked their tea (Harney & Sons).Service was friendly and attentive by just the right amount.

Between the two of us, we had the Pretzel Pork & Chive Dumplings, six Kung Pao Chicken Wings, Lobster Tom Kha, Crispy Oyster & Bacon Pad Thai, Korean Fried Chicken, and Crab Fried Rice - a ton of food, I know. I ended up with three personal sized to-go boxes... The dumplings are awesome. The outer pretzel layer is so unexpected and perfectly salty, and it compliments the meat mixture inside nicely. It doesn't even need the spicy mustard. The wings were pretty meh. They tasted like mall food court chicken, were barely spicy, and were served with what tasted like Hidden Valley ranch dressing. The soup was HORRIBLE. We both thought someone must have dropped the container of salt into it accidentally - it was ridiculously salty. And we both love salty foods. We sent that back...  The pad Thai was good but not great. Very standard. Like anything on Seamless, frankly. But a good, safe bet!  The fried chicken was a little odd. It didn't taste like any of the KFC I've had in Koreatown and it relied heavily on the dipping sauce for flavor. The fried rice is AH-MAZING. I hoarded it all to myself. So much crab. So much egg. Some kind of delicious sauce. And caviar on top. Yumyumyum. The service is great. Super friendly and attentive.

The Kung Pao chicken wings and garlic shrimp were a great start. For the main course we shared the lobster and short rib noodle dishes. It was so decedent. The fried chicken dish was tender and flavorful. We all shared the crab fried rice and the samosas as well. Between the party of five, we were all very satisfied. Even with the place packed, our waiter was very attentive. I'd recommend to everyone.",0,0,0,Frances R.,"Brooklyn, NY",249,26,0

The wings were good too.  We were finally seated and decided to order the short rib, brussel sprouts and the oyster and pork belly fried rice.  I probably wouldn't order the short rib again.  It was just too small, but the others I would order again.  So yummy!I hope Dale decides to open a restaurant in LA.",0,0,0,Aura C.,"Monterey Park, CA",530,495,30
4.0,12/4/2014,"The Korean Fried Chicken is really good maybe like in my top ten. Very well prepared juicy chicken with surprisingly crispy skin and spicy Asian sauce that's delicious; for some reason there were some sliced grapes around and on top of the Korean chicken I tried very much to make that make sense but it really didn't work, so ignore the grapes or clean the sauce off and eat them as a pleasant palette cleanser afterwards. The Kare kare was like regular spaghetti with really good braised short rib and it was good but not worth the price. I think I was unimpressed by this dish, maybe it needed some udon or something The mango pie...no no no wrongThe dumplings were good to me and so were the samosasIt's worth coming back no doubt and a great vibe in the restaurant",4,3,2,Sam T.,"New York, NY",276,246,280

We arrived early to ensure a seating (they do not take reservations) and informed our helpful and friendly waiter that I was GF and he explained what was OK for me on the menu.  The staff is professional, friendly and helpful.  The meal is served family-style - and thankfully my girlfriend was happy to have the GF options with me.Here's what we had, and what I thought of it:Vietnamese Garlic ShrimpA great start to the dinner.  Clean, fresh, and perfectly prepared. Simple but well done.  We were excited for the upcoming dishes.Crispy Oyster & Bacon Pad ThaiThe best pad thai dish I've ever had - and was happy that it was prepared GF.  It was not clumpy and thick like many GF versions of pad thai I've had in the past.  This was a savory and delicious take on the Thai staple.  The bacon was subtle and smokey while the fried oysters were soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside.  Really good.Korean Fried ChickenHot, crunchy, tender white meat chicken served with a delicious spicy kimchee yogurt.  This may be my favorite dish of the last five years.  I had to let the waiter know that this is the first fried chicken I've had since going GF 12 years ago.  I left Talde walking on a cloud.Thanks to Laura for convincing me to try this place and thanks to Talde for the amazing GF experience.Recommended for anybody, gluten-free diet or not.",0,0,0,John G.,"Manhattan, NY",1,68,4

The pretzel dumplings - If all I ever ate were these deliciously crunchy dumplings I would die happy (ok, just a -tad- over the top, I know). I only wish they served more than 4. The Lobstor Tom Kah - No, but really. I kind of wished we had just order three of this dish. Definitely the favorite. The only con is that there really wasn't that much lobster meat, but I guess that's normal?The pad thai (I forget how the menu called it) - perfectly light and flavored. The Turkey Ramen (like thanksgiving in a ramen bowl) - Really good, but SUPER heavy. I knew it was going to be a heavy dish, but my eyes couldn't look away from the description so I got it anyway. I would recommend this dish if you're splitting it. My 3rd portion was still too much for me.We also got their cocktails... I can't really remember which ones, but they were really great too.

3.0,11/18/2014,"I was excited about coming to Talde - really. It's Pan-Asian, has both interesting noodle and classic entrees, and has a really enticing decor. But it just didn't stack up.We had the pretzel pork dumplings, which were interesting but came off as more of a novelty. The pretzel and salt flavors just didn't compliment the meat as much as one might hope. With the oyster and bacon pad thai, there were a couple disappointments again. The bacon was delicious in huge, smokey chunks but the oysters just felt out of place in the dish being fried. It gave an overly strong seafood taste and left it seeming not much like pad thai at all. We also had the fried chicken with kimchi sauce, which was probably the most well rounded of all three items. Crispy, huge chunks of meat, and the sauce was spciy but not overbearing.It seems like the ideas for the menu items were all great, but the execution on them just falls short. With this in mind, the prices aren't really justified for the quality or variety of food you're getting. $21 for some decent fried chicken and halved grapes really didn't seem worth it at the end of the day, even being the better of the three items we had.",0,0,0,John M.,"Brooklyn, NY",170,217,83

3.0,11/10/2014,"Lately, I've been experiencing Brooklyn overhype.  A recent example would be the festival of lights event in Dumbo, which was very widely disseminated to the point that a premature early closure became necessary to stem the crowds.  As cool as it was, it was NOT that cool (and in fact, the Dumbo arts festival puts out a similar show every year). Just so you know. I feel Talde is very much an example of this. I've seen Manhattanites, still rubbing their eyes,  cross the river into this section of Brooklyn to experience the unusual asian fusion brunch on weekends.  My bf and I convinced a Manhattanite friend to join us this past weekend.  It was, to put it nicely, a mild disappointment. We partook in communal style (""family style"") a varied selection with influences from around asia:  breakfast ramen with buttered toast broth, korean wings with waffle, squash samosas, Filipino pork with claypot rice, and a french press coffee.  The breakfast ramen was bare bones. Very nicely cooked chewy wavy ramen noodles, but no garnishes save a single parboiled egg.  I did not see any of the  promised bacon. Would it kill them to use at least one slice of bacon per dish? The broth  was a bit overwhelming.  The main flavoring was butter, and I really couldn't handle more than a few spoonfulls. Korean chicken and waffles showed up with a generous amount of wings, but the entire dish was cold.  Odd, since the server mentioned that the dishes would hit the table in the order they became available. The wings were drowning in a spicy dripping sauce, and honestly, I would have preferred bon chon over these sloppy morsels.  Wet naps would have been brilliant, but I guess that wasn't their thing.  The clay pot Filipino pork tasted alright, but the pork piece was particularly gristly and fatty. Not the best cut of meat, and it was challenging to cut into pieces to share. The rice dish was super greasy, as well.  Good for people who like gratuitous grease.  The samosas were good.  The dipping sauces (tamarind and yogurt) worked nicely with the fried pillows.   I have to say, the best part of the brunch wa that they had a 3 cup french press coffee pot  available.  More restaurants should offer this as a brunch option.  Glad to check the place off my list, and file away in ""overhyped and unlikely to revisit.""",2,0,1,Kayo N.,"Brooklyn, NY",164,367,139

It was also so crisp and came on the greatest yogurt kimchi sauce ever!The brussel sprout side dish was nice but a bit too much lime juice.

3.0,11/9/2014,"I felt I did myself a disservice by coming to Talde .. but when in Brooklyn, time advantage when you can.  I ate and ran while I was with my sister and mom in the Slope- we came to Talde around 1245-1 - there was about a 20-30 min for a table. So, we were lucky to snag bar seating.  The bartender was quite busy but she did a great job being attentive and serving us - we were tight on space (I mean it's the bar) but we managed.  It wasn't even as though the restaurant is very crowded- it's just very small and there are not a lot of two tops, mostly 4 seaters. We had the:- Spicy Lemongrass Chicken, came with fresh lettuce which you use we wraps. The chicken was quality stuff even minced, I tasted great flavors. There was a lot of what you'd expect-fish sauce,lemongrass, etc- very Thai like all-flavors-on-deck dish.  - Bacon Pad Thai- which sadly had no bacon. It was sort of just ordinary pad thai.  Meh. -The Filipino style pork- I was not a fan because it was really chewy...but there was a strong herby yet sweet flavor which made this dish really different for me. Came with egg-yolky fried which was tasty. -Pretzel and Pork Dumplings- honestly one of the best things we had, if not the..a pretzel like shell with nice and simple pork and chive inside. The only thing that I regret not trying is perhaps the breakfast ramen but all in all I think Talde is a place you visit for dinner.  The combination, and fushionesque of various Asian flavors are more interesting.

I am so glad it didn't.  It exceeded my expectations.  We had the pretzel dumplings as an appetizer, he had the Kare Kare, and I had the Kimchi Ramen.  The dumplings were really tasty, the mustard dipping sauce was perfectly tart and sweet. The outside of the dumplings had a nice crispiness and the meat inside was a perfect ball bomb of flavor.  My only wish was there was more than four.  So yummy.  But what really stole the show for me was my bowl of kimchi noddles.  As soon as it arrived I immediately took a taste of the broth and...time stood still.  I felt like I had finally found true love and it tasted like bone marrow!! Yes folks you could actually taste the essence of bone marrow laced in this perfectly balanced, deeply textured, spicy broth. I wanted to dive into  the bowl and live in that broth....and the rest of the contents were perfect as well. The noodles were al dente, the egg was divine. Now, I know what you are thinking...why would you go to a restaurant and pay $16 for Ramen? Well I have a thing for Kimchi and the bowl was completely worth it. Ok, time for the Kare Kare (pulled beef short ribs w/ noodles in peanut sauce) , it was delicious my BF called it ""melt-in-your-mouth-sensational"". He couldn't stop eating it. Alas, I didn't care for it...it had coconuts. The funny thing is he usually doesn't care for coconuts either but the menu didn't mention this ingredient so he ordered it and loved it! go figure.  The service was excellent as well. all in all, I plan to return again and again to the tiny corner of heaven.

4.0,9/18/2014,"I went to Talde with 3 of my girlie's. One currently being a Brooklyn native, she had frequented Talde a few times and had nothing but good things to say. We even ran in to one of her friends there and it seems as though many Brooklyn-ites go to Talde whenever they just want good food. Most of them go twice a week. Anywho- we were seated at the bar and about 10 minutes later we dined under the stars (an inside table wouldn't be ready for another 1/2 hour and it was a nice night to site outside). We started with the Kung Pao chicken wings and the Kale salad. Both great flavor. Kale salad was fresh and delightful. I've only loved Kale salad at another restaurant (Mercer Kitchen) but this one is good too. This was followed by the Lobster Tom Kha, Korean fried chicken and the cashew rice. Sounds like a lot of food but it's actually family style and we had some left over. Service was great. The only time we had to really wait for something were the 2nd round of drinks but they eventually came. All in all it was a great food experience. I don't eat pork and there were a lot of pork dishes on the menu so those of you that consume piglet may really enjoy that.

3.0,8/31/2014,"3.5My overall thought of this place = Not bad. The apps were lousy, the entrees were good. Drinks were average.Pretzel dumplings - Nothing pretzely about it, just extra crispy skin. Not bad, but you only get 4 and it's just an uninspired dish. Expected more.Kung Pao chicken wings - Reviews on this made me excited to try this one as I love wings and I love a good kung pao (which is insanely hard to find). I almost wanted to send this dish back, it was so incredibly salty.  Flavor of the kung pao which made it past the salt was pretty average too. Major let down.Whole branzino - they debone the whole thing which is nice. This was tasty, cooked well, comes out in a banana leaf and I liked the addition of dill as that is uncommon to asian food. Fried chicken - This dish was quite good.  Sauce was different and tasty. Chicken was crispy, moist, and they give you a decent portion. **This dish would bring me back here.

5.0,8/24/2014,"Dale Talde is one of my favorite cheftestants from Top Chef, and I have been wanting to try his restaurant for months.  Finally made it here, and it was worth the wait.Apps:  pretzel pork and chive dumplings, Thai snack plate, and wonton noodle soup to share.  Each of these was delicious and well-executed.  Most had unexpected flavor combinations that totally worked.  I particularly loved the pickled green papaya on the snack plate and the heavenly broth and perfectly chewy noodles in the soup.  The pretzel pork dumplings were creative and delicious, esp when dipped in the mustard sauce.Entrees:  we shared the miso salmon, lemongrass pork shoulder, Korean fried chicken (KFC), and Mei's five pepper steak.  All were delicious with unexpected ingredients and great mouthfeel.  The pork and beef were the best of the bunch, with intense seasoning - and in the case of the beef, unexpected crunch from croutons that were coated in that delicious five pepper glaze.  Yum!  I could have eaten those croutons all night.  My only slight disappointment was the KFC, which I found a bit too oily even though the flavors were great.Drink:  Plum sake Bellini was refreshing and subtle.Service also was amazing.  Thank you to the hostess who made sure we got a table even though half our party got stuck in traffic.  You made this out of towner really happy.  The bartender and server both were friendly and knowledgeable.  My only regret is Dale Talde was not at the resto that evening (I would have loved to meet him) but I hear he is busy opening more locations.  Go, Dale!",0,0,0,Carolyn H.,"Washington, DC",1,138,3

3.0,8/13/2014,"I've been wanting to try Talde for the longest time. The first time I attempted to eat at Talde was a huge disappointment because I waited 40 minutes to find out the restaurant had a surprise health inspection and had to close down the kitchen (which they should have told us earlier, not until we came up to ask.) When I finally had the chance to come back, the wait was 20-25 minutes for that Friday night. I got seated in the back by the window. I'd advise you to bring a sweater or something because by the end of the night, it was FREEZING, especially when you're sitting in front of the air vents. My boyfriend and I had to huddle our hands around the mini candle in the middle of the table. He even took the candle from the table next to us cause we were that desperate for some heat lol. The food is Asian-fusion, with lots of influences of Korean, Thai, and Filipino. We had the pretzel dumplings (4 pieces.) I wish the dough itself was a bit more pretzel-like but it was still good, cooked til golden, sprinkled with salt, and paired with a spicy mustard dip. Next we had the spicy and sticky chicken wings, beef short rib kare kare, and Korean fried chicken. Every single dish had an element of heat or spice. The chicken wings had some good flavor. I wasn't a fan of the kare kare as I felt that the noodles were too soft, the beef was a little dry, and the peanut sauce wasn't strong enough to my liking. The Korean fried chicken was perfectly fried but I wasn't a fan of the sauced served underneath, it had a unique taste to it. The cherries however did give a great sweetness.For dessert, my table of two shared the infamous halo halo. You can image how freezing we ended up getting after eating this. It was huge! Served with macha, condensed milk, mango, lychee, strawberries, coconut milk, and CAPTAIN CRUNCH! It was crack and probably the best thing I eaten all night. I was so full by the end of the night.

He ordered the sausage, egg and cheese fried rice which was pretty good except for he had to scarf it down so that we could get to our next destination in a timely manner.  The cocktails here are excellent, and I'd  like to give Talde one more chance to wow me in the food department.  Dale has such a cute establishment, but I think a bit more attention to the food must be paid.  I am frequent  Asian fusion type eateries and I just know this place could be better.  I'll revisit Talde at at later date, try something else on the menu and get back to you...",1,0,1,LeRue C.,"New York, NY",260,264,211

3.0,8/5/2014,"The restaurant is very Americanized then again, it is Park Slope. That being said, I think the flavors were lacking a bit.I knew I had to try the pretzel pork and leek dumplings after reading raving reviews about them. I thought that the skin was just too salty. I totally got the pretzel and honey mustard thing but I was better off dipping them into hot sauce. Pretty pricey for some dumplings too. On the plus side, they came out in like two minutes after we placed our order.Next we got the Korean fried chicken and market veggies, which was roasted cauliflower in some sort of xo sauce. The chicken was good with the flavors so interesting and spicy. It was lightly battered yet crispy. Definitely not anything close to Bonchon's chicken which was the first thing that popped into my head when I read it off the menu. Definitely a shareable dish. The cauliflower was okay-but again, a little too salty because they overdid the sauce. The raisins in the mix were a nice touch. For $12, it came out in a very small bowl.The bacon oyster pad thai was probably the worst. It just didn't taste right.

5.0,7/30/2014,"I went here for my graduation dinner. I was skeptical at first, it was dark inside, a little loud, and the menu seemed small. I ordered about 4 dishes that the waiter recommended to share between the four of us. We had a plate of veggies, chow fun, chicken and one other I can't seem to remember. The flavors of all these dishes were just so rich and amazing. Every single bite left you wanting more! We shared all of the dishes which was definitely enough. If you're looking for a delicious place where you can leave feeling un-bloated I recommend Talde. Some might say they are a bit expensive, but the quality is totally worth the price.

Pork tasted fresh and of good quality. The outside had a nice fragrant pretzel taste. They are exactly what the name says they are. Worth a try.Next I had the beef short rib kare kare noodles. Portion size was a little small but this dish was very tasty and delectable. It had nice peanut flavor from kare kare with a little extra kick and the short ribs were nice and tender. Now for the halo halo. The halo was far from traditional but still very good. Talde puts condensed milk, shave ice, fresh strawberries, coco cube jelly, lemon grass green tea syrup, captain crunch and dried mango. Tbh the captain crunch dominated the whole bowl which wasn't a bad thing. I didn't taste much of the green tea syrup. The dried mangoe was too sweet for me but the fresh strawberries were great. I enjoyed the halo halo and would recommend a try for a good dessert cereal. However it pretty much taste like a really good captain crunch bowl which could be made at home.

Tater tots - tasty! the sriracha ketchup adds just enough.Korean fried chicken and waffles - good sauce on the chicken, good waffles, and the syrup is kinda like the sweet grainy stuff you get with lechon. A lot of the flavors are spot on but sadly the chicken was kinda dry and overdone. Juicier bird would have really tied this together.Bacon Pad Thai - Flavor was excellent but the heat on the wok, or whatever they used just wasn't set up high enough to really sear the noodles and burn out any sogginess.

4.0,7/14/2014,"I've walked by this place at least four times not realizing what it was.A friend of mine was visiting another friend of mine from the best coast, and seeing as how all three of us were purveyors of fine and creative Asian cuisines, the friend whom was being visited upon by our other mutual friend decided that Talde would fit our day's schedule (the agenda of the day was ""explore Brooklyn"") well.The establishment doesn't scream out ""look at me, I'm one of those fancy Asian fusion restaurants!"" at all; from the outside it looks like one of those cookie-cutter Trattoria-esque places one might expect to find in Chelsea or the Meatpacking District; save for the Filipino Eight-ray Sun right above the ""TALDE"" logo, there are very few indicators from the outside that suggests you'll be eating anything other than overpriced brick-fired pizza here.Inside the decor resembles that of a living room of an Asian family that has been living in the states for the past twelve years -- lots and lots of artifacts and pieces slotted carefully in between compartmentalized wooden display shelves that suggest that this family is from a land of mystery, is different and does not care who thinks what about it.Now that I'm done rambling, the actual food review.Myself and three others arrived at Talde for Sunday brunch, reassured by my friend that a menu had already been thought up and that we'd only have to show up and enjoy the feat -- and what a feast it was. We ordered the Korean Fried Chicken and Waffles, The Pretzel Pork and Chive Dumplings, the Tater Tots with Sriracha Ketchup, and the Oyster and Bacon Pad Thai.Whereas all of these offerings were innovative and delightful, the consensus was that the Oyster and Bacon Pad Thai took the cake as the morning's favorite; I really loved the way the savory and crunchy pretzel dumpling skin came together with the seasoned pork, creating this awesome hybrid... thing which tasted like it was the byproduct of a three-way between a Jamaican pork patty, A piroshki, and a very solemn plate of gyoza.The tater tots weren't very special, but I will henceforth be adding sriracha to every occasion where/when ketchup will condiment a dish I'm eating; I also found the Korean Fried Chicken wings a little bit too buffalo-esque for my taste -- I felt that it could use with more spice, zing, and sweet, in that order.The only complaint that I had with the restaurant was the limited dining space allotted to four people -- we could hardly fit all our dishes as they came out (we ordered mulltiples of the Pad Thai and Korean Fried Chicken) and with the lack of space we kept finding that our utensils wouldn't stay on our table (runaway chopsticks, rogue forks, etc.) Also in my state of space-deprivedness, I managed to spill a miniature pot full of half-and-half on my lap, but I guess I can't completely attribute that to the cramped eating conditions.Whereas some might call the wait service here ""fast"" or ""diligent,"" I found it to be a slight cumbersome; our table had a waiter come in 3-4 seconds after a different waiter had just filled our glasses with water stand in a bewildered yet disappointed look that what was supposed to be half-full (or empty, depending on what tickles your fancy) was somehow magically full.All in all a great dining experience. I'll definitely be back for the Pad Thai and their regular lunch/dinner offerings.",1,1,1,Scott S.,"San Francisco, CA",156,470,670

Everything is innovative yet comforting, consistently delicious, and meant for sharing.  Just my kind of place for repEating (I just made up that portmanteau - do you like it?). The menu shifts slightly fairly regularly but the breakfast ramen (brunch only) and pretzel dumplings - two must-haves - are always available. Other go-to favorites when available are the shrimp toast with sausage gravy, Korean chicken and waffles, and the tater tots. Tater tots don't sound that exciting but Talde makes them crispier than anywhere else and you get to dip them in homemade Sriracha ketchup. Nom nom nom! I probably prefer their brunch but dinner is also excellent and gets more variety in terms of menu changes. Not everything has been a major hit but some dishes like Kung Pao wings and crispy pork have been standouts. Delicious cocktails and an excellent wine list (feat. an impressive selection of Fingerlakes whites) plus super-friendly service round out a great dining experience.

4.0,6/30/2014,"Talde is a pretty cool little place with fab food.  It was jam packed when I arrived but that appears to be the norm.  There is a small and comfortable bar when you walk in.  A decent size dining room for a restaurant in the city, and there is outside patio seating too.   Oh and a ""chef's bar"" that seats 5 and faces into the hectic kitchen.  This is where I sat.  Mr. Talde was not in attendance tonight.  I had the Pretzel Pork & Chive Dumplings appetizer, Lemongrass Pork Shoulder, and Wonton Noodle Soup.  And ""the"" dessert. The Pretzel Pork & Chive Dumplings have been covered here extensively.  They are superb.  But they are dumpling.  Dumplings are always good.  These were better than most though.  I ordered the Lemongrass Pork Shoulder with watermelon nuoc mam and peanut relish. What I didn't realize is that ""nuoc mam"" is fish sauce.  And strong fish sauce at that. I am not a fish eater and this dish tastes much more like fish than pork.  I asked for something else and made it clear this was my fault and I would pay for the pork.  They refused.  And apologized numerous times.  Despite my insistence that this was my problem and fault, not there's.  They really took care of me here. I quickly found it that there isn't much on the menu without fish sauce.  That's how I ended up with the wonton soup - which is a noodle entree at Talde.  It was the best Wonton Soup I've ever had.  I drank the last drop from the bowl.  I was asked if I wanted the dessert.  Yes there's only one dessert. And it is a memorable one.  I'm not sure how you can go to Talde and not try this.  I decided there was no way I could describe this dish here so I went to an online description which reads:For dessert, guests can indulge in Dale's signature version of the Filipino dish Halo-Halo, a shaved ice sundae with condensed milk, coconut, pineapple, lemongrass, tapioca, topped with Cap'n Crunch.Whow. Every bite of this was like a super cold and fresh party in my mouth.  It turned to a green mushy soup by the end.  I posted some pics of this.

3.0,6/11/2014,"We went to Talde with really high hopes. We had a party of six.  We really enjoyed the 2 seasons of Top Chef that Dale was on.  Also my wife is Filipino American so the idea of some Filipino fusion dishes intrigued us.The restaurant is very open and bright and casual. There are some nice wood carvings on the inside and big tables. There is also outside seating. Our servers were also very good and attentive. Talde was pretty busy, it was a Saturday night.Pretzel Pork & Chive Dumplings - spicy mustard - These were pretty good with a nice pretzel taste. The texture was a little hard.Kung Pao Chicken Wings - peanuts, house-made buttermilk ranch - This was one of the better dishes we had. The wings were very good and the Kung pao sauce was delicious with just enough heat.Beef Short Rib Kare Kare - hong kong noodles, peanut & thai chili relish - This was a big miss for us. There was not much flavor and the noodles were dry. This missed all didn't have any of the flavor of Kare Kare and the thick peanut curry sauce. No one particularly liked this dish in our party.Whole Roasted Branzino - banana leaf, turmeric, tomato - This was just OK. It had too much sauce and it overwhelmed any taste of the fish, Miso Salmon - perilla salsa verde, puffed bulgur pomegranate citrus salad- This dish was very good and the Salmon did have a nice Miso infused taste. Korean Fried Chicken - spicy kimchee yogurt, grapes, mint --This was also a very good dish. The chicken was crispy and moist and the yogurt saice was very good.Lemongrass Pork Shoulder - watermelon nuoc mam, peanut relish -This was probably the star of the night.  Everyone really liked this dish and the subtle flavors.For dessert we had the Halo Halo which sadly was pretty bad. Halo Halo and similar items are served in many Filipino and Vietnamese restaurants. Talde's version was almost all ice shavings. with very little fruits and coconut milk.Talde hit on some dishes, especially the Lemongrass Pork Shoulder, Miso Salmon and Kung Pao Chicken Wings.

As we are waiting for our food the waitress asked if we are ok. I said yes and added how long before the rest of the food. She answered ""it will come out when it comes out"" with a dirty look on her face as she walked away. The rest of the food came out 5-8 minutes later. The rest of the experience was a little uncomfortable as the waitress came, dropped off the food, and left without saying a word. The food was delicious, but the waitress was horrific.

5.0,6/8/2014,"Can't say enough good things about this place. I have been here several times and it's always a knockout.The space is cute and inviting, with interesting architectural details, especially the bar. Indoor seating consists of tables and some very spacious booths; there's also sidewalk seating which I haven't tried yet.The food really is unique. They tend to do nouveau/creative spins on traditional Asian classics - for instance, the pad thai is a spicier version that features oysters and bacon. The pork dumplings are made of pretzel dough instead of traditional wonton style - they are crispy, perfectly salted, and delicious. Other standouts include the braised short ribs and the cauliflower dish.The specialty cocktails may be a bit hit or miss (the Grog seemed to be a fail, but the Ginger Rose, made from bourbon, was a winner). The wine list is really quite diverse.Service was attentive but never intrusive, as it should be.All in all, a consistent winner.

3.0,6/4/2014,"I didn't watch the season that Dale Talde was on, but if I had and come here, I would request that his All-Stars title be revoked.  After I saw a positive review posted by a friend of mine, this restaurant had always been on my to-go list.  I finally got the chance to come here a few weekends ago.  Needless to say, Talde was not in the house.  Perhaps this is the reason why the food was so below the hype of these reviews.  All this Asian ""influence"" led to much unfocused work, the food suffered, and in turn, I suffered.We ordered 6 dishes: 3 appetizers consisting of Pretzel Pork & Chive Dumplings, Yuzu Guacamole, and Samosas And 3 entrees consisting of Crispy Oyster & Bacon Pad Thai, Whole Roasted Branzino, and Lemongrass Pork Shoulder.Breakdown:The dumpling skin was light and crisy, a nice departure from the usual dumpling skin, but the meat within was like something I've had at every other dumpling place.  We ordered the yuzu guacamole with serrano ham on the recommendation of the waitress.  Ham is naturally salty, and paired with soy sauce?  Forget it.  That was rough on the palette.  After mentioning this to the waitress, she removed it from our bill, which was a nice gesture.  The samosas had very little filling and bored me to death.I was literally salivating when I read oyster and bacon in the pad thai.  When it arrived, the oyster was more dough than anything, and the bacon was not the kind I was expecting.  Both oysters and bacon have strong flavors, but neither were incorporated into the dish itself.  It was as if everything was cooked separately and then tossed together last minute.We were told the whole branzino was the best item available.  Wrapped in banana leaves and cooked with some herbs, it was a great way to cook fish.  However, the fish itself was a little tough; this was probably my 2nd time having branzino so I'm not quite sure if it's naturally this way, or if it was overcooked.  I give this dish a passing grade regardless.The one thing that wasn't recommended that I thought was the best dish was the lemongrass pork shoulder.  It had a nice texture and good flavor.1 out of 6 is pretty bad considering the standard for a ""Top Chef.""  While I applaud the attempts at an innovative menu that combines different types of cuisines & influence, I would prefer a strong sense of direction and execution more.  If Talde wasn't so busy trying to be the cool kid on the block, it'd be the kid everyone wanted to be around for the right reasons.",6,1,4,Jenn F.,"Brooklyn, NY",767,372,2548

The Crab Fried Rice was fluffy and had none of the heaviness that I usually associate with the dish.  The Chicken Wings and Fried Chicken were perfectly cooked - juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside - and each came with a sauce that put the dishes over the top in my opinion. This is a family style menu. Not that you can't order your own dishes, but it really is so good that you are best served by trying a little bit of everything. So go with people who like to share. Service was great, we were attended to by everyone - no waiting for ""your waiter,"" the whole team pitches on to  keep everything moving.And they don't take reservations, but even on a Friday night we were seated in like 20 minutes (much faster than their estimate) - and there's a full bar up front that you can have a good time at while you wait.",0,0,0,Errol B.,"Brooklyn, NY",82,37,87
3.0,5/26/2014,"It was fine. No cocktails this trip, so the 3 star rating is based entirely on the food. After hearing and reading all the great reviews, we got the pretzel dumplings to start. I was very much looking forward to it, and the flavor of the filling was fine, but it was a bit burnt and nothing too epic outside of the salt. For entree, we shared the lemongrass pork shoulder. The goodness topping the meat was the highlight of the night. Unfortunately I don't know what you'd actually call it, but it was watermelon, peanuts, chiles and some other stuff all chopped up itty bitty and plopped on top of the pork. It's not a common flavor combination (at least not for me), and for the out-of-the-ordinary taste experience I was definitely thankful. I was less than impressed with how the pork was prepared, however. Came out a bit too chewy and just not that special. As for ambiance, just be warned it's a small place. We were sat at a bar table by the kitchen, so it was super loud. Personally, I loved seeing the action but it's just a ""good-to-know"" for a first timer.

My favorite were the wings and samosas but i must say that the yuzu guacamole is the most original idea of guacamole i've ever had. The king crab rice was amazing, the crab was so tender and buttery.

2.0,5/24/2014,"I shouldn't have trusted my white friend to recommend a so-called Asian Fusion restaurant for brunch. We had ""asian"" bloody marys to start, and they were so watered down and tasteless it was the very first time I had seen my boyfriend take an entire meal to finish it.The Pretzel Pork and Chive dumplings tasted very average. Pretzels and dumplings are two of my favorite things and combined I envisioned it to be nothing short of spectacular. Alas it was poorly excuted. The skin didn't taste at all like pretzel, although I liked the sprinkling of kosher salt on the exterior. The filling was on par with supermarket brands and since there wasn't much pretzel flavor, the mustard dip just felt wrong. All i wanted was some soy sauce. The Breakfast Ramen was super heavy, indeed like drinking liquid sticks of butter. I know, that kiiinda sounds like heaven in theory, but in reality I could only take two sips. I liked that the noodles were nice and chewy though. The one thing I did like was the Spicy Lemongrass Chicken wraps with romaine lettuce. It was super flavorful with some substantial heat that pleasantly surprised me. There were only 4-5 leaves so we asked for a couple more. What I did not appreciate was seeing the $2 upcharge on the bill which was not mentioned when we asked for more lettuce. If you're going to charge more I suggest you give enough in the first place. Finally, service was weird and very impersonal. Hardly a smile and rarely an appearance.

I was expecting better food at Talde, but some of their dishes seem forced onto their asian fusion menu without much thought. Add some sriracha and call it asian! I don't think so. We got the chicken and waffles, literally one minute after ordering! And I know why. Everything was precooked and chicken wings and waffles were cold. Off to a bad start. The chicken wing's flavor was so overpowering! The sauce was soaked into the not crispy chicken wings. The waffle was even worse. It lacked sweetness and had a bitter aftertaste. It was barely cooked and the syrup was watery. Then we had tator tots and the dumplings. Tator tots were fine. Their dumplings I recommend! But don't dip it into their bitter mustard. Their bacon pad thai was okay. Don't get their bloody mary's either. They need to rethink their menu and hire chefs that care. Very disappointing.",3,0,0,Elizabeth N.,"Brooklyn, NY",197,645,326
3.0,5/8/2014,"I've been wanting to go to Talde forever now and finally I was able to make my way over here after work.  Talde is a pretty small restaurant with a narrow bar area when you enter and a larger dining room further to the back.  The cool thing about this place is some of the beers they have on tap like Pork Slope and Dale's Ale.  In fact, I would say all their beer selections suit me pretty well since there is a heavy leaning towards ales.  Their menu itself is pretty simple without a million options.  To start off we had the yuzu guacamole, pretzel and pork dumplings.  We then split the KFC and pad thai as everything is served up family style just like any good Asian restaurant would do.  The highlight of the meal was undoubtedly the yuzu guacamole.  It was the most inventive item we ate the entire night, essentially it was sushi rice that had been pan fried on the bottom until crispy topped with the guac and it was fabulous.  I was prepared to hate it but when it came out I was pleasantly surprised.  The pretzel and pork dumplings, KFC, and pad thai were good, they weren't amazing.Given the pricing for the menu I would have expected more.  There was nothing distasteful about any of the dishes but I wanted to be wowed.  The yuzu guacamole was certainly a nice head fake for the meal to come.  Was it good?  Sure it was, was it $90 good?  Meh, I don't think so.  I can get better KFC, pad thai, and dumplings at other restaurants.  Can I get that yuzu guacamole dish anywhere else?  None that I can think of.  I was really hoping Dale would be able to reinterpret these classics more along the lines of the guacamole but instead was served the same old same old.",2,0,0,Phil L.,"Seattle, WA",167,876,249

You def need the sauce that come with them. We also got a soup it had great depth in flavor the pork was amazing and it was enough to share for 2 people.  For a side we got the crab fried rice which I though was delicious a huge portion great flavor.

5.0,4/22/2014,"Dale Talde, I think I love you. I've seen every episode of Top Chef, ever. When Dale came on the scene for his first season I was intrigued. His spin on Filipino/Asian cuisine was so cool. When my future father-in-law suggested dinner for my future sister-in-laws birthday, I squealed like a little girl. We arrived a little before our 7:30 reservation on a Saturday night and the place was poppin'. We were seated right away. I really appreciate that when it comes to a reservation. It bugs me when a place doesn't keep a table open when you make a reservation weeks in advance and have to wait up to an hour. Our waitress was quick to go over the menu with us. She mentioned that the menu was meant to be shared, which we all liked because we like trying lots of different things. We started with the pretzel pork and chive dumplings. I saw him make this on one of his seasons of Top Chef and I anticipated this item the most and it did not disappoint. The crispy dumpling was juicy inside and the bite of the salt was a great addition. We all loved the tahini mustard that was paired with them! Then we shared the Hawaiian bread buns. I loved the Filipino pork sausage and the mayo that accompanied them was delicious. The yuzu guacamole was a little too spicy for me, but the crispy rice was so tasty! After those starters were brought out (very quickly I might add) we were given our soups. I LOVED the wonton noodle soup with the pork belly and 6 minute egg. The broth was addicting, the wontons were delicate and delectable, the egg was perfection, and the noodles were delicious. I wasn't crazy about the pork belly. It was too hard. The lobster tom kha came out next. Also a bit spicy but the flavors went together really well and there were huge chunks of lobster in the soup. The Korean fried chicken came next. I wasn't crazy about this dish. The chicken skin was so hard it could break a tooth and the chicken was a little dry. Everyone else at the table loved it, though. After that we got the chow fun with braised pork shank. This was the second stand out dish of the meal. The noodles were in a sphere that we had to break up ourselves. Tender yet crispy noodles with perfectly juicy pork? A winner, of course. No one really enjoyed the short rib kare kare because the coconut milk was a bit overwhelming and a little unfitting in the particular dish. We also ordered the roti, and it was fluffy and crisp. Very tasty. The cauliflower with romesco sauce, raisins, and pistachios were good too. They only had one option for dessert, sesame balls with peanut butter powder filled with chocolate ganache. As good as it sounds! Service was great. Our waitress was helpful and sweet, and the bussers  came by often to change our dishes and fill our glasses. Dinner was pretty reasonable too. I can't wait to come back for brunch. Shrimp toasts with Chinese sausage gravy is calling my name! Just a note: This place is not for people with hearing problems. The music is loudddd and people are constantly screaming across the table.

Next we shared the korean wings with waffles or should I say 1 cold waffle that wasn't crispy .Wait the wings aren't either. ..in fact what's up with the wings they have the strangest texture ever as though they were made the night before and then re heated . I have no doubt this is something to so with the coconut milk they are prepared in but some thing is wrong with them . Second wing had traces of blood near the bone and that's it I'm done. I mention to the server who takes back to the kitchen then returns and tells me its fine. Its not fine we wanted a bloody mary not a bloody wing .I think maybe the good reviews are for dinner because its certainly not a great brunch.Shame as the place is quite nice all though it is your typical park slope stroller crowd .I would try again in the evening.",3,0,0,John B.,"New York, NY",781,380,697

3.0,3/25/2014,"The food is pretty good in my opinion but it does not make for appointment eating. I went with two friends and we each got different entrees. My guy friend got the  Crispy Oyster and Bacon Pad Thai, my girl friend got the Beef Short Rib and I got the Pork Belly. My entree the Pork Belly was my least favorite. It was very fatty (duh, you might say) , which would not be bad except that was its only distinguishing characteristic The Beef Short Rib was okay, my friend liked it, but to my mind it was nothing special. My favorite entree by far was the Crispy Oyster and Bacon Pad Thai, it was delicious - but be warned it's not for the salt-sensitive palette. My friend actually didn't finish it for this reason and I got to take it home. Victory! The appetizers were a better bet. The brussel sprouts, normally my least favorite food, were delicious and creamy. The bread buns were also good, especially the shiitake one. They're basically sliders, each with a different ""meat"", on a a King's Hawaiian roll. I say this to clarify for people who might think they're getting a Chinatown -style steamed pork bun. I liked the pretzel dumplings as well, but they were good in that general dumpling-y way, not special or different tasting. We also got  Obama punch, which is tart and satisfying, but notably comes in a child's high tea style miniature pitcher. I almost laughed out loud when the waiter brought the pitcher to our table. I was lucky to be drinking with lightweights, otherwise I wouldn't have gotten any of it. Overall, It was definitely net positive experience for me.

2.0,3/22/2014,"I'll admit it: I have a (potentially unhealthy) obsession with Top Chef, and it didn't escape my mind that one of the alums, Dale Talde, had started his own mini-empire in Park Slope. Known for his fiery temper and his displeasure at losing any of the challenges, coupled with the strong Southeast Asian influence in his cooking, I'd long been curious about would come out of the kitchen from such a chef. Thus, after rounding up a small group of like-minded friends, we headed out on a weekend afternoon for an attempt at brunch.Talde is located a bit farther from what many would consider a prime brunch area, but it was still fairly packed on a Sunday afternoon. There's a fairly low-key, neighborhood vibe from the space that makes it a perfect for any variety of locations, especially if you live in the area. After being greeted by the host and putting my name down for a table, I waited until the rest of the group trickled in before we were finally seated and given menus. The brunch menu at Talde is short and compact, and includes a fair number of dishes from their regular dinner menu. Our waitress recommended that we get a variety of plates to share, and after a little discussion, we decided on five dishes for the table.First, the good (or, not-so-bad): The Smoked Char Siu was probably the best executed dish of the meal. The meat was tender, flavorful, and smartly paired with a sinus-clearning spicy mustard sauce. It was, however, a rather ridiculously small portion given the price ($10). The Sausage, Egg, and Cheese Fried Rice was also a solid plate of carbohydrates and protein, but not much different than what one could find in any restaurant in Chinatown.Unfortunately, the disappointments far outweigh the non-disappointments. The Pretzel Pork and Chive Dumplings weren't particularly memorable, and I couldn't taste the actual use of pretzel dough as the wrapper. The Bacon Pad Thai was a sticky mess of overcooked rice noodles, and was almost flavorless as well; the one saving grace was the sparse addition of the bacon and the fried egg. And the Breakfast Ramen was far too rich and buttery that it bordered on inedible; we all had to douse our bowls with the makeshift sriracha sauce on the table, which slightly helped to moderate the richness.I typically find brunch to be one of the meals that is difficult to mess up, helped by the fact that profit margins on the ingredients utilized (eggs, carbohydrates, and alcohol) are usually favorable for restaurants. Unfortunately, I had to walk away from Talde with a great deal of disappointment, which is a shame, considering the actual venue and quality of service we were given that day.tl;dr - This is one place that doesn't do justice to ""Asian Fusion"", especially given the price points. Skip the hype, and make your way to your local Chinatown for a more satisfactory meal.",10,4,7,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827
4.0,3/17/2014,"If I was reviewing the cuisine alone this review would be a 5-star gusher.  The food is outstanding. The menu is full of deliciously unusual flavor pairings and unique takes on traditional Asian dishes, notably the Crispy Oyster & Bacon Pad Thai, which will blow your MIND, and although I dont recall the exact preparation, the market vegetable of the night was a roasted Brussels Sprouts dish that had the tang of lime, the kick of wasabi.... holy Shiitake, they were amazing!  That all said, I do have to take off one star to account for a number of gripes:  they have a ""no reservations"" policy, which I find obnoxious (we waited two hours for a table, then were told ""it would be another half hour); the speed at which they turn tables (i didnt exactly feel rushed, but pretty damn close); and last but not least, THE DEAFENING SOUND LEVEL THAT REQUIRES YOU TO SCREAM AT YOUR DINNER COMPANIONS. Would it kill them to put in a few soft surfaces to dull the sound level a tad?But back to the food!  The restaurant offers only one dessert - a sort of desconstructed Apple Pie, which consisted of heavenly sweet, soft and syrupy apple wedges served in a hot iron pot topped with a crust - are you sitting down? - of crispy rice noodles and Chinese five spice.  Wait, what was I complaining about again?",4,2,0,Ed K.,"Brooklyn, NY",55,76,3

2.0,3/4/2014,"Not very impressed by my dinner. Waiter was a lil pompous. Sides were over priced and they didn't have halo halo :( The good-the fried Kung pao chicken wings were great especially if you have the sauce on the side. So the crispiness is conserved and you can put as little or much of flavor/spiciness on each wing as u want.-the wonton noodle soup is not the typical wonton noodle soups u get at a regular Chinese restaurants. It reminds me of a good ramen noodle soup with savory/milky soup base and ramen noodle with an awesome bite. There's a couple pieces of meat (not the fatty pork belly u usually get in ramen), The wontons were delicious and it's a lot of food for $13 bucks (if I remember correctly)The mediocre- hubby ordered the pad Thai with fried oysters. There's 3 pieces of fried oyster which he enjoyed quiet a bit. But there's nothing special at all about the noodle. It was kinda blend and forgetful. After consuming the oysters there's not much to the dish. -the Hawaiian buns (3 sliders consisting of fish, mushroom or pork). The fish slider tastes like frozen fish patty u would get fromMcd fish filet sandwich. The mushroom was a lil on the salty side and not impressive at all and this dish is over priced. The bad- the lemon grass Brussels sprouts were terrible. Over powering creamy lemony Sauce made the healthy veg so greasy and inedible. It even looked gross. The banana sticky rice with bacon- you get a few tiny pieces of ""Chinese bacon"" which is suppose to be very flavor and a lil sweet/salty and when cooked with sticky rice makes the sticky rice fragrant and flavorful. However this dish was bland and just a wasteful consumption of high carb. I know it's cold but still....no halo halo is just a disappointment.

4.0,3/3/2014,"My first exposure to Talde was on television via Chef Dale Talde who competed many seasons ago on ""Top Chef"".  All drama aside, it was clear Chef Talde had some skill so when I found out his place was in Park Slope I knew I had to check it out!Built into a corner of a block full of beautiful old Brooklyn houses, the store front is a gorgeous example of classic Brooklyn architecture complete with molded patterns on the exterior and huge windows that let you see in or let those inside people watch with equal effect.  The interior is beautiful as well with some beautiful moldings behind the bar including dragons.  To the left of the entrance is the bar and to the right is a waiting area for those awaiting a table, and on weekends that's often a lot of people.  The back area features both booth and table seating.  The booths are really charming, with high backs and small lights build into each one.  While a lot of the original structure has been kept intact, much of it has also been renovated making the restaurant interior both classic and modern all at the same time.I've gone a couple times now and each time the staff has been super friendly and helpful.  Even when there's a huge crowd they don't play games with seating.  They'll straight up tell you (as pleasantly as possible) how long your wait will be and each time it's been less than we were told.Okay, so what about the food?  The list below represents dishes I've had across different visits:PRETZEL PORK & CHIVE DUMPLINGSWith fried dumplings such as these, you have to look at both elements of the dish to really form an opinion: the fried dough skin and the meat based filling inside.  The outer shell is great.  Chewy with a bit of crunch and salty (thanks to pretzel salt sprinkled on it).  It also works nicely texture-wise with the meat filling inside.  However, the meat filling is only ""good"" at best, not extraordinary.  Overall it's a good dish, but not one to go wild over.LOBSTER BAOSpeaking of dishes to go wild over...do you like lobster?  Do you like spicy food?  Do you like soft, steamed buns?  Then this is the dish for you.  White bread is used as a shell for chunks of lobster thoroughly drenched in a spicy butter sauce.  On top of that is some fresh cilantro offering some nice, bright contrast.  The result is an amazing dish.  My table wound up getting two orders of this in one visit because it was so good.  Be warned, on one visit they had sold out!SPICY LEMONGRASS CHICKENThis version of lemongrass chicken comes with ground chicken that is wonderfully seasoned.  It's sweet and spicy all at the same time as cilantro adds brightness to the dish.  You are given nice, fresh romaine lettuce to spoon the meat onto and the result is a surprisingly refreshing dish.  BACON PAD THAIIf you're reading this, it's highly likely you've had Pad Thai tons of times, so the base of this dish is nothing surprising.  What elevates it is a combination of big chunks of bacon (no Oscar Meyer slices here), whole spicy peppers (be careful when you take big bites!) and a whole egg you break up (runny yolk and all) over the dish.  Spray on the lime wedge's juices and the combined dish is an amazing combination of savory, salty and tangy flavors.  This is one of my favorite dishes here.KOREAN CHICKEN WINGS & WAFFLESThe waffle included with this dish is not a big, fluffy diner waffle but a smaller one akin to an Eggo (but tastier).  The syrup was good, but nothing particularly special.  What was great were the fried wings in a hot Asian style buffalo sauce.  It was spicy and crispy, a wonderful combination.  TATER TOTSNo real surprises, they're just tater tots - but they were SUPER crispy.  I'm so used to tater tots being mush in most restaurants that having nicely seasoned, crispy and hot tater tots was almost a shock.  The sriracha ketchup was good, but really these are good just on their own.I've enjoyed my visits to Talde and definitely see more visits in my future!",5,2,2,Benson Y.,"New York, NY",393,1299,917
4.0,3/3/2014,"Worth the hype? Definitely. Worth the 2 hour wait? I'm not so sure... The food at Talde is great, comforting yet still modern and very balanced. The service is efficient, though I suppose that's a necessity to maintain high turnover and accommodate the mile long lines waiting in the crowded front bar. I only wish they accepted reservations, because the last thing I want to do is wait for 2 hours to eat after trekking all the way out to Park Slope.Luckily, the bf and I were able to snatch two seats at the bar and nurse a few cocktails while watching the Knicks game while we waited on a Saturday evening. After we were seated, we ordered a few of their popular items to share. - Pretzel pork and chive dumplings - although these didn't exactly register as being ""pretzel-like"" they were supremely tasty. The pork and chive filling was juicy and very flavorful, with light ginger notes. The mustard dipping sauce was interesting, not what I'd typically associate with fried dumplings.- Kung Pao chicken wings - absolutely worth the calories! I loved the sweet and slightly spicy glaze on these wings, and the buttermilk ranch managed to taste very light and refreshing. - Crispy oyster and bacon pad thai - loved the robust smokiness of the thick cut bacon and the crispy fried oysters. Very unique, even for such a played out dish such as pad thai.- Kale salad, persimmon, pickled beets, candied almonds, creamy ponzu - a slightly virtuous version of your average spa kale salad. Very well balanced and good, with pieces of crunchy fried kale mixed with the raw green kale. I could have this salad for lunch every day of the week.I only wish we had a couple more stomachs with us that night. Talde, like most other Filipino/(influenced) restaurants, is best when shared with larger parties.

So when I found out that Dale opened a restaurant (relatively) close to my house, I was stoked! So I had high hopes for this restaurant. My boyfriend and I didn't make a reservation because it was pretty last minute to go. We were concerned that it would be packed and we wouldn't be able to get seated soon. But we pretty much got seated as soon as we walked in. I thought it was a little strange but we just assumed we got really lucky.It's a nice, big place. The staff was friendly. But the food was just disappointing! We were glancing over the menu and our waitress told us that things were usually ordered to share so we should probably order more than usual.

My boyfriend and I looked at each like other like.. ""you just told us to order a lot."" But whatever.. we ordered Kung Pao Chicken Wings to start.

Pretzel pork and chive dumplings: literally pan fried regular dumplings sprinkled with sea salt and served with a mustard.Char sui smoked ""pork shoulder"": basically 8 slices of barbecued pork (char siu), absolutely nothing shoulder-y or special about it.""Bacon"" pad thai with a fried egg: ""bacon"" in the pad thai was chinese sausage.. Other than it being a substantial portion, wasn't anything special.Korean chicken wings and waffles: The wings were soggy and tasted more like buffalo wings than it did like Korean chicken wings.The waffle was a bit burnt and a bit too crunchy on the outside.Overall, I give Talde a two star rating because the atmosphere and service was on point. We were seated next to the open kitchen which I always love because I enjoy watching the chefs work. Loved the decor of the space and all the great sunlight you get from the windows alongside the restaurant.I would come back to try their dinner menu but never again for brunch.",1,0,0,Lisa H.,"Brooklyn, NY",572,299,5858

2.0,1/21/2014,"Dale, Dale... Top Chef star, and I know the talent is there, but what happened? I had the lucky opportunity to try Dale's food at a special event in Seattle, and he DID NOT disappoint. I was elated to finally meet my favorite Top Chef contender. The guy delivered, and delivered well! I gotta say, it was one of my most favorite dining experience for 2013. After getting to know Dale, I said, ""When in NY, know I'll pay a visit to Talde.""So, finally in NY for the holidays, and of course Talde was on my list of NY musts. I chose to go with 2 other friends because I figured it would be easier to seat a small grp for no more than 3 for a Saturday night. While we waited at the bar, I had the pleasure of meeting the pleasant David Massoni, and I got the overall feel from the staff as friendly, so that was good. The wait wasn't that bad, and the music choice added to that BK feel. Ok, let's talk food. First, the famous pretzel dumplings. Texture was good, but a bit heavy with the pretzel salt. Second, the Hawaiian buns. We tried all three, but nothing too memorable. The fish was ok, but I can't seem to put my finger on the lack of flavor with their version of longanisa. I was just looking forward to more flavor with the other dishes coming at this point.Next, the noodle dishes. We ordered the crispy oyster & bacon pad thai, and the chow fun thanks to the Richard Blaise 1st look clip which made it seem promising. Pad thai was a bit drier than I'm used to for pad thai, and the oysters are the highlight for this dish.. kinda wished there were more. The chow fun fell flat due to the lack of sauce! Kinda killing me here. Again, dry. I knew this dish wasn't supposed to swim in sauce, but we really had almost nothing. I love pickled greens, and I wished there was more to balance out the pork. Instead it just seemed like a huge chunk of crisp chow fun with meat. We chose not to go with an entree thinking the noodle dishes would suffice for 3. Lastly, hearing the words, ""..and there's no halo halo"" from our sweet waitress was the killer. I was looking forward to the cap'n crunch icy goodness. Done. So why 2? It was based on the meal. I read all the reviews before coming here, and knowing the talent in the kitchen that's backed up here, I couldn't agree with the meal we were served. The Dale we knew in Seattle was different from his own spot. Was it a lack of consistency for a busy kitchen on a Saturday night? I don't know, this was my first time here. Maybe they should revisit the dishes they're known for, and execute? I do know we didn't get to try the other dishes, so maybe, maybe, we'll be back to try those.",2,0,1,Michelle Z.,"Mountlake Terrace, WA",16,17,7
3.0,1/19/2014,"I expected more from Dale.  It seemed like with every dish, I got progressively more and more disappointed.  The pretzel dumplings were decent.  The wings were not crispy enough nor were they spicy enough.  The kale salad was uninspired, literally raw kale drizzled with a totally unmemorable dressing.  The Hawaiian bread buns were no better than average pub sliders.  The cocktails were cloyingly sweet, with little else going on.  The best thing we had were the brussel sprouts, which were the market vegetable of the day.  They were well cooked with a flavorful sauce, but alas, a meal cannot be saved by one simple side dish.  If I lived nearby, the restaurant would likely be in my rotation but by no means would I travel any notable distance to dine here.",2,0,0,Julie M.,"New York, NY",256,553,27
2.0,1/18/2014,I have been to Talde a half dozen times and never have a problem with wait times because we usually bring our baby on the earlier side of service. My husband loves the wings but anything else we've had has been over seasoned or over sauced or both rendering any protein or greens sloppy and unappetizing. I think Talde has potential but it's definitely time to revisit the menu and update the recipes. I think they are aiming to present flavorful dishes but they should focus more on the basics cooking...,0,0,0,Nicole J.,"Park Slope, Brooklyn, NY",1,19,0
3.0,1/18/2014,"We walked in about 9pm on a Monday night (they close at midnight) and the wait was about 30-45 minutes which provided enough time to post by the bar and grab some drinks and a small app --  I had a glass of Dale's Pale Ale and the S.O. had the Pork Pale Ale as well as the kung pao chicken wings to munch on. The wings are definitely on the spicier end of the spectrum so expect your tongue to feel the ""POW!"" in KUNG PAO. As a fellow Filipino, the Beef Short Rib Kare Kare was definitely a downer. It's not that it wasn't good, but I guess I expected for it to be a traditional kare-kare with the beef short rib replacing the ox tail. It resembled more that of a curry dish, similar to a Thai penang curry with tangy flavors and fish sauce to highlight it served with noodles-- none of which are ingredients in kare-kare so for me calling the dish that is deceivingly disappointing. To me, kare-kare is just one of those dishes that you don't need to mess with and is good as-is served with plain ol' white rice. I don't think you do a staple Filipino dish like kare-kare justice when it doesn't sell to a Filipino audience nor trying to pass it as an ""Asian fusion"" dish just to please everyone else. I think and *know* from experience -- Filipino or not,  kare-kare is a dish enjoyed by all.They ran out of the Bronzini that night so we went with the Salt and Pepper Sea Bream which was excellent and a dish I would highly recommend if you enjoy eating the entire fish (fish head and all). Between the S.O. and I, simply put -- we crushed it down to the bones. It was fresh, crispy (lightly battered) on the outside, and so moist it made my mouth water. The soy sauce w/ garlic and chili peppers for dipping was the perfect accompaniment to the fish. The only thing I found a ""miss"" was the tartar sauce. I didn't find it paired well or was even was necessary. Make sure to pair this fish dish with the King Crab Fried Rice. They were generous with the crabmeat and the fish roe amplified the fried rice taking it to a whole new level of satisfaction. Atmosphere: I enjoyed all the traditional Filipino decor and all the wooden details of the space. It reminded me so much of my Lola's (grandma's) house in the Philippines. Definitely had a nostalgic attack in a good way. I also loved the laid-back attitude of the staff, the chefs in the kitchen rocking their snapbacks, and the hip hop/rap playing in the background.

We ordered only a few items -- so it's possible the magic happens somewhere else on the menu -- but, really, nothing should be BAD, especially at those prices. The Hawaiian buns were mediocre - the fish seemed to be a fish stick, the mushroom was inedibly salty. The lobster Tom Kha was really insipid. Thai it wasn't -- it would have disappointed at a cheap Thai restaurant -- it certainly wasn't worth the money! The draft beer was just ok, but rather flat. I'd give it one star even if it was half the price. At this price it is irritating.

3.0,12/29/2013,"I'd like to say this is more a 3.5 experience than a 3. In general, the experience was good but not great. I came to Brooklyn's Talde with expectations set above just any restaurant. Dale Talde, two-time contestant on ""Top Chef"" is a bit of a 'big deal', so one should come to Talde with the expectation set higher than for any ordinary restaurant. Talde is more or less unique in its own right. Traditional, refined Asian dishes are given a bit of an American twist but not in the cheapened sense. Hence, why we can define this as Asian-American cuisine. However, I think it's a mistake to call this Filipino or Korean influenced. The characteristics of Filipino or Korean cuisine were hardly pronounced in Talde's dishes, but if they are supposed to be there, I'm disappointed to have not noticed.Four of us came to Talde on a Sunday afternoon with reservations made at least two weeks ahead. The restaurant was pleasantly packed and busy, as expected, but the service generally didn't suffer for our table. We opt to try and share a variety of some of their popular dishes off the rather small brunch menu -- Pretzel Pork & Chive Dumplings, Smoked Char Sui Pork Shoulder, Breakfast Ramen, Sausage, Egg, and Cheese Fried Rice, and Bacon Pad Thai. We had mixed feelings, but for the most part, we felt collectively unimpressed. As we willingly continued to douse our food with the (weak) generic hot sauce that was at our table, it was a clear indication that something was lacking. Personally, I found the Char Siu Pork Shoulder to be very tasty and the most worthwhile dish out of all. Least impressive was the Pretzel Pork & Chive Dumplings. Pretzel was barely noted in the dumpling skin, which even while appearing deeply fried, was very chewy in texture. The filler was all too common in taste. Bacon Pad Thai was ordinary and very underwhelming in the spice factor, which was actually warned and indicated by our waiter. We finished that plate clean and noted no spice whatsoever. Breakfast Ramen was slightly offensive, butter galore. The addition of some generic hot sauce helped it actually. The ramen itself was fine, but the broth was a bit too rich and buttery to be enjoyed as a soup alone. The Fried Rice was actually the second dish I had enjoyed out of all, but not what we call too unique or original. I'd say for portion sizes alone, quite skimpy and can't possibly be called family-style. Price point is rather high. Presentation was nice otherwise.Overall, while generally tasty and flavorful, the dishes lacked a sense of originality. Take your common Asian dishes, be it dumplings, ramen, fried rice, etc. and add ingredients not so commonly in Asian cooking in order to give it the added twist. The fact that Filipino and Korean cuisine was pretty much non-existent on the menu left me really disappointed; Korean chicken wings with waffles certainly don't count. Not entirely resolute on whether I'd return, but I don't outrightly object Talde. They have something different to offer when it comes to Asian food, and the presentation was generally great. Otherwise, perhaps a bit overrated. There's not too much to gush about on this end.",2,2,2,Sara L.,"Manhattan, NY",721,552,3545

Wasn't pan-fried to my liking. BREAKFAST RAMEN - buttered toast broth, honey-glazed bacon, six minute egg - really did smell like toast.

3.0,12/9/2013,"This is a first, but I am not being honest with you*. I am still perplex. How could I possibly dislike Talde's food this much? We shared among 4 people: Pretzel Pork and chive dumplings. I liked the dough texture, it was deep fried but not greasy at all, pleasantly chewy and I think it is intended to be crispier on the edges but it came soggier. Regardless, it was good. The filling however, was ok. Bland in my opinion and no much better than other places I have been to. The spicy mustard, another ok. It missed the hint that high quality mustard gives when it is used. The Fried Rice was good, not extraordinary but just your average fried rice like in hundred other places. Maybe I shouldn't have had any expectations. Similarly, the Smoked Pork Shoulder was in fact the best out of our 5 dishes. Still nothing carrying the ""woa factor"" that it is been created around Talde's food. Bacon Pad Thai, I didn't like it. There was a aftertaste coming from the sauce that I couldn't overcome and the greens were not even dressed but just hanging in there in the top on the noodles. I didn't see much bacon and we were aware of being spicy because of chili peppers. Not in the one we got. Finally. Breakfast ramen. 3 spoons after I started, I left the entire bowl there. I felt like drinking butter. The noodle texture was actually fine. Adding siracha sauce helped a bit but not enough to overpass another spoon more. Amazing ... but in a bad way. Additional details include tacky dinnerware, pleasant decor, super-friendly service and I also liked the chopsticks. Very much actually. Even when 1 of the chopsticks service for the table didn't match with the other 3. It is ok but I would expect those things to happen in the dungeons of Chinatown were a (much better) bowl of noodles cost $4. I am giving the benefit of the doubt based on one visit only for the brunch menu. I am actually quite intrigued and I think I am gonna come back because I need either explanation or confirmation that my judgment has not gone crazy. If I know this in advance, I may have avoid such dilemma by not even bothering trying it. And last thought, it is disturbing to disagree with the vast majority of talks about Talde.

How can anyone mess up pork? this was cooked well with a glaze on top. $10 for about a 2"" long pork shoulder cut into 6 slices.The pretzel pork and chive dumplings - had better. it was a bit dry and not sure if it was supposed to look like a pretzel or taste like one.

We were able to call in ahead of time and put in a reservation of 8 (thanks to a cancellation!) in the evening. As soon as we arrived the place was hopping with lots of people keeping their mouths busy with food and drinks.We were seated in the long booths. It was a bit tight for 8 people but we managed. We ordered a variety of food to share and here is my opinion on each dish:Pretzel Pork & Chive Dumplings: mmm delicious! Not a fan of that Chinese mustard dipping sauce it comes with but on the table there's a spicy red sauce that you can easily substitute and tastes just as good!Crispy Oyster & Bacon Pad Thai: to die for!!!! Easily my favorite dish out of all of them! The oysters were crisp and and the touch of bacon in the pad thai makes it that much more enjoyable. This dish is good for two fairly hungry people or can be eaten alone if one is extremely hungry.Shortribs Kare Kare (pronounced ka-reh ka-reh, not care care): this dish was just okay to me. The shortribs were tender and flavorful as well as the sauce. It was odd that this dish had noodles in it when, typically, Kare Kare is eaten with rice. Sans noodles and this dish would be golden.Fried rice: this was a decent dish. Nothing over the top but compliments the dishes well.Lobster dish: I forgot the name of this dish but it came with lobster in sauce and fried shrimp toast. This dish was pretty decent as well. Tasty and flavorful. Not my favorite but I did enjoy the fried shrimp toast!Vegetables: we had two veggie dishes. 1) I believe it was butternut squash, it was good. I liked it but most of the table didn't. 2) brussel sprouts: these were really good! I don't really know what the seasonings were or how it was prepared but I enjoyed this veggie dish the most! I recommend it! Beef skewers: I forgot the name of this dish as well but it was a simple dish, beef on skewers. Can't go wrong with this dish, it was good.As for drinks we got a pitcher of the Obama punch and Sangria. I liked the Obama punch more than the Sangria. Obama punch was sweet just how I like my drinks and the Sangria had a different taste than your regular sangrias.Overall we had a great dining experience. Servers were nice and made sure we were taken care of.  However, my biggest gripe is the pricing of the food. The price isn't worth it because the dish is small.

These were very delicious if you like syrupy savory sweet with creamy delicious white dressingRamen noodle with egg - terrible, too much salt, noodles al dentePad thai - terrible take, blah, noodles too dry, flavors could not compete with a typical turnkey Thai place, not to mention my secret favorite Thai placesHad to lower it to one star because the wait was ridiculous, and since we got a bottle of wine, our bill came to $90 for one of the grossest meals I've had in a while.",0,0,0,Jake E.,"Borough Park, Brooklyn, NY",8,18,0

4.0,10/16/2013,"I underestimated Talde.  I totally did!I am not sure if it was because I was starving or because comfort food with a twist was what hit my spot last night!  The food was filling and delicious.  By the time we finished our meal, the place was packed since we had an early NY dinner.The only thing that threw me off and bothered me were the asian plates and bowls that they used to present their food.  It was tacky, especially with the looks of the restaurant.  The restaurant itself is minimalistic with a modern wooden interior.  The chinatown-wear clashed with this decor.. I just couldn't stand it!  Service though.  Service was a complete different story.  Our waitress made our experience ten times better.  I genuinely really liked her, especially with how nice and attentionate she was.  She knew I didn't like bean sprouts for my pad thai so she put them on the side.  When it was given to us the bean sprouts were on my side unintentionally, but she saw that and flipped the plate for them to point towards my partner.  The little details can make such a difference in service!  A chopstick dropped.. and out of nowhere another chopstick appeared from one of the waiters!  So quick!  I was very satisfied with Talde's service.  Thank you for the great staff! Ordered:1.  Pretzel pork & chives dumplings with mustard: simple but yet delicious.  I really enjoyed the crunch of the pretzel texture especially with how I like cooking my potstickers usually crispy on the stove too!2.  Hawaiian bread buns: ordered one of each type which were the mushroom veggie one, pork sausage, and fish.  You can pick either one or all of the same one.  It is up to you.  These were very tasty!3.  Fried oyster and bacon pad thai:  I think more fried oysters would of been better since only 3 of them were given to us.... The bacon was well spread out and had enough to taste its flavor every time I took a bite of the noodles.  4.  Chow fun:  Make sure to chop it up and mix it in once served to you since it is seared on one side for a crunchy texture.  I love fat noodles so I really enjoyed this dish.  It was simple but with its fatty tender braised pork, it sold me with my hunger!5.  Halo Halo:  I wasn't going to order any desserts since none of them sounded appealing to me.  Captain Crunch sold my partner.  This dessert definitely could serve 4 people easily but somehow we finished it since it was so delicious with its condensed milk.  How can anyone NOT like condensed milk?  I wish they put more of the other ingredients in there like fruits and jellys.. Captain crunch was definitely enough!Accompanied with a pitcher of sangria for $18:  It served us about 4 1/2 cups!  It was definitely liquored up with an asian fusion twist to it.  I really enjoyed it!Definite Recommendation!  I was definitely surprised at how satisfying this meal turned out to be!  Go check it out if you are ever in Park Slope yourself!",4,0,4,Kathy D.,"Sunnyvale, CA",2136,1124,541

4.0,10/8/2013,"As an avid Top Chef fan, I watched Dale Talde on his season kick serious ass, showing people how good and versatile Asian food can be. I was bummed to see him ""pack his knives and go"" but it is what it is. I went to another Top Chef contestant's restaurant once in San Francisco and left pretty disappointed, so maybe that's why I put off going to Talde for so long. Also probably because the line is usually crazy busy - I went once on a Sunday afternoon and was told the wait for 2 would be an hour which I didn't have the patience for.I finally got the chance to dine here last week on a Wednesday for dinner and was so pleased that we were seated right away. I was even more pleased to see none other than Dale at the door saying hello to us as we walked in!We started with a pitcher of the starfruit sangria, which I was sold on because of the pickled starfruit, cloves and star anise. It sounded better than it actually was I think - it was somehow both watery yet strong at the same time and none of the unique flavors I was sold on were coming through. It's okay, I was still optimistic for the meal! We ordered the edamame hummus and Hawaiian buns to start. The edamame hummus was so delicious and fresh tasting! It arrived artfully scraped across a plate and was served with some delicious stewed eggplant and perfectly soft yet crunchy roti. My only complaint was not enough roti! The Hawaiian buns were a creative use of the soft and slightly sweet Hawaiian buns I used to eat a whole loaf of as a child (King's Hawaiian sweet bread all the way!). We ordered a fried fish one and two Filipino pork sausage ones - these were essentially sliders. The fish was pretty good but a bit dry, or maybe just compared to the pork sausage, it was nothing amazing. The longanisa sausage was divine. For the mains we ordered the crispy oyster bacon pad Thai, the smoked char siu pork shoulder and a side of sticky rice. The pad Thai itself was delicious and I really liked the fried oysters and huge chunks of bacon (pretty much like a pork belly) to make the dish that much more unique. Love the generous bunches of fresh Thai basil on top too. The char siu was really flavorful but the texture of the pork shoulder was pretty tough. I could barely bite through it it was so chewy. The shaved green apple salad that accompanied it was a perfect pair though, and the crunchy fried peanuts added great texture. For something so simple, even the sticky rice was delicious - I love the chunks of Chinese sausage and scallions hiding in there.

Entered 369 7th Ave into my Wackberrys GPS system and off to Brooklyn it was.  The GPS kept redirecting me to 369 7th Street instead of 7th Ave. so we got somewhat lost.  After a few turns here and there we finally found the place... Nice locale, packed w/ a bunch of Park Slope hipsters, the wait for a party of 2 was about a half an hour long on a Saturday night.  Would have made a reservation but they only take reservations for parties of 6 to 8 here.  Hostess was nice and perky, told us we could wait by the bar or come back within 30 minutes for our table.  Decided to chill by the bar with a Brooklyn Sling on hand (brokers gin, cherry liquor, pineapple juice w/ lemon-lime bitters).  Strong drink. Finally got a table...  Started with the fried pork and chives dumplings...  Sounds kind of unappetizing but they were surprisingly very good.  The mustard dipping sauce it comes with was too spicy for me but the dumplings on their own were perfection.  Spicy seemed to be the theme of the night btw...  For my main course I had the Korean Fried Chicken w/ Banana Sticky Rice.  The chicken was dumb spicy...  The dish was good but the spices totally killed it for me.  Ate as much as I could but eventually had to wrap it up and take it to go.  Thankfully it wasn't as spicy the next day.  All in all I enjoyed Talde.  The scene was good, the ambiance was tight, the bar, the staff...  Everything good.  Next time I'll just stick with noodles and dumplings...  Or maybe I'll try the Ribeye.  Wifey had that and it tasted pretty good.",0,0,0,Omar Z.,"New York, NY",44,112,117

5.0,10/2/2013,"I had wanted to go to Talde since it pretty much opened years ago. I saw them building it blocks away from my ex's apartment and he freaking later went with his friends when I had obligations the same night. PFFTTT. So finally I bit the bullet and made reservations about a month before my birthday and decided if I'm going to be all pouty and shit, I'm going to be pouty and happy with glutinous amounts of savory food.We started off with cocktails because half my friends were late. Which I expected. They're Hispanic and they'll get the joke (I swear I'm not being racist) but every time they show up they claim ""Hispanic time"". Though! They actually had a decent reason for being a half hour late this time. Stupid subway. I also want to note that those little black booths barely fit 7 people. I have no idea how in God's name an 8th would have fit. I had the Ginger Rose cocktail: Four roses bourbon, laird's Applejack, lemon, and ginger-cinnamon grenadine. Oh my goodness. It was like Autumn in a glass. The perfect accompaniment to dinner as well because it wasn't too heavy and had enough of a kick in booze to keep you warm and fuzzy inside for a long time. A couple of people got the Obama's punch which is very sweet but interesting. I definitely taste the vanilla and blood orange in there and Krakken rum is my all time favorite. I make rum balls out of that sweet goodness come Christmas time! But anyway, go with getting yourself a pitcher if you want more than one drink or if you are splitting the same thing with someone its more economical. For appetizers we started with the Pretzel Pork and Chive Dumplings: The crust is the best part with that sea salt crunch on the exterior. But the star of apps were definitely the Kung Pao Chicken Wings. They weren't too spicy but the sticky bbq flavor hits you in the face and the chicken wings are so moist and huge. They do not skimp on giving you meatless little chickies. We also ordered a side of the King Crab fried rice. I've heard mixed thoughts on the Pad Thai and we went with this because really how can you go wrong with sticky rice and huge chunks of succulent crab meat? It's very sticky and perfection with hints of tobiko and jalapeno aioli resonating throughout the dish, however, its not overwhelming in heat it just adds a more in-depth flavor. For entrees a bunch of people wanted soup. Though, the idea of sharing dishes didn't embrace everyone's mind with ordering different entrees. We had like 3 Lobster Tom Khas, a Wonton Noodle Soup, the Korean Fried Chicken, and the Whole Roasted Branzino. I tried everything. The Lobster Tom Kha is really freaking delicious and they put an enormous amount of broth and noodles in your bowl. Really, this is meant for two people to share because hardly anyone finished their bowls. I tried a tiny piece of the Korean Fried Chicken and it was incredibly moist, though, I didn't try the yogurt sauce it comes with. Note to self, I will be back one day. Pace yourself. The highlight was definitely the Branzino fish. It comes with little thin pancakes to make branzino sandwiches or you could just eat the fish straight which was better. You taste TONS of turmeric and not something I usually cook with or order but it melds so well with the falling apart delicate flakes of fish. OH! I almost forgot the second best part! GET THE EVERYTHING ROTI BREAD. It's only $4 and its seriously so delicious and indescribable with how light and doughy and tasty it truly is. It was a pretty great birthday and I already want to come back for brunch here. So huzzah, Talde.",2,2,3,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",843,1384,11457

4.0,9/28/2013,"I'm a big fan of Dale Talde and I had really high expectations for Talde. For the most part, my expectations were met and were exceeded. There were definitely hits and some obvious misses but I was really pleased with the overall experience. If you go for one thing, go for the Korean Fried Chicken. Watermelon Margarita [$10]: A.ma.zing. It tasted like a Watermelon Jolly Rancher! It was sweet and slightly tart and made your mouth pucker only a little bit. It was garnished with a plump piece of watermelon sprinkled with salt. I had to stop myself at 2. We shared a variety of dishes. Here's the lowdown grouped by hits and misses:Hits:Pretzel Pork & Chive Dumplings [$8] w/spicy mustard: These were little fried pillows of delicious. There's only 4 to a serving, get two orders if you have a large group. We were all fighting over them. The spicy mustard dipping sauce wasn't too spicy but just enough to counter the fried and greasiness of the dumpling. Lobster Tom Kha [$15]: The coconut milk broth was ridiculously delicious. It was so smooth and creamy. There must have been 5 lbs of butter in it and you could taste every last stick. The noddles were long and slurppable [new word I just created]. I don't love lobster but I thought it was really great in this soup and not at all rubbery or lost in all the components of the dish. Korean Fried Chicken [$23]: A half of a fried chicken on a bed of roasted peaches smothered in spicy kimchee yogurt. I can't say enough about how incredible this dish was. It's perfectly coated and fried, the peaches add a fresh element, and the spicy kimchee yogurt is reminiscent of a lighter [in color, I'm sure not in calories] sriracha sauce. Again, we ordered two and there were still not enough spoons to scoop up all the sauce. Halo Halo with Captain Crunch [!!!!!]: Amazing. It's sweet and wonderfully cold and icy. The perfect ending to a rich and spicy meal. Misses:Hawaiian Bread Buns [$12]: Overall, I was reminded of high quality White Castle Burgers. The buns were soggy and the components were uninspired. Szechuan Sea Bram [$19]: Not nearly as spicy as the waitress claimed it would be. ""Don't eat the chiles"".....well don't incorporate them into a dish if we're not suppose to consume them. The sea bram was just meh. It was under seasoned and felt lifeless compared to the KFC and Lobster Tom Kha. Crispy Bacon and Oyster Pad Thai [$16]: This sounds like it would be absolutely delicious. Unfortunately, it wasn't. The oysters were soggy and the bacon was barely noticeable. The pad thai noodles themselves were nothing notable. There are plenty of better phat thai places in NYC. A group of 5 people dropped a cool $300 or thereabout, $56pp. Not terrible. I'd come back for the items that were drop dead mouthwatering and steer clear of everything else.Also, the service was excellent.

5.0,9/17/2013,"If you're ever down to gain ten pounds in one sitting with a bunch of friends who are down for a family style meal, trying a bunch of different things...... well something might be wrong with you. Ten pounds, that's really unhealthy. You can die!But if you've been checked from a trusted physician both emotionally and psychologically. And you just really love food, then I highly suggest Talde. Talde takes on reservations of groups of 6 or more. Don't be late or they will say very mean things and notify you how you are only allowed to reserve the table for two hours. Sit down, relax, enjoy the beautiful decor because you are about to stuff your face. Appetizers- We started out with some orders of the pretzel pork and chive dumplings. It comes with a spicy mustard which is perfect for dipping. I also enjoyed it with the house hot sauce. I strongly recommend them. - Next we had the Kung Pao chicken wings. I heard so many things and I was unimpressed. Wasn't spicy at all. My friend lost her voice and while we pitied her as if we Mr.T, it meant more for us. The peanuts were the best part and I started eating those and accidentally scooped up a pepper. Quite the kick.- Rounding out our appetizers were the Hawaiian bread buns. I had one crispy fish, real good. Then had one pork, WOW! Amazing! I'd highly suggest just getting the pork one for all three. The fish was good but the pork was just that much better. I didn't try the mushroom but c'mon, vegetables over meat? Pssssh. Noodles- We got an order of their famous crispy oyster and bacon pad thai. I don't get the hype. I have to say this was the biggest disappointment. Not so special noodles, super super fatty bacon. I love bacon as much as anyone but this just pure fat. The oysters were just thrown on top. My friends loved it but I didn't care for it at all.Entrees- On to the entrees. We got four. First lets start off with the blandest of the bunch. The orange beef rib eye and broccoli. I expected so much more. It wasn't bad but it wasn't anything I'd recommend. Kind of boring. - Next we had the pork shoulder. This was the one I ate the most of. One friend couldn't due to the fact it had oyster sauce on it (ASK YOUR WAITERS ABOUT YOUR FOOD ALLERGIES, lots of stuff here use oyster sauce for example). My other friends didn't love it so I was happy to clean the plate. Very chewy but super flavorful, dressed with peanuts and oyster sauce this dish is highly recommended. - Now for the two best dishes I've had in a long time. The Korean fried chicken is a must! I feel like chicken is something that doesn't really impress me often but this dish is phenomenal. Giant boneless pieces, super flavorful, perfect amount of crispiness. Loved every bite.- Last we had the whole roasted branzino. Why are you still reading this? Leave now and wait however damn long you have to eat this dish. It was in GQ's top 50 dishes in the country and I was a bit skeptical but it deserves to be on there. They debone it for you, have tomato, jam, onions and banana leaf around it so you can slab it all on a small wrap along with the fish. It was the last meal of the night but it didn't slow me down from making sure every edible bite was gone. Do yourself a favor and make sure you get the branzino and fried chicken next time you come in. Our waiter and staff were fantastic. Super attentive. Answered any questions we had. Very friendly. Made sure everything was to our needs and liking.  We sat there, crazy full, contemplating how we could move. Didn't care because we wanted to make sure we got our two hours in. In the end some dishes were over hyped, but some were the real deal. When I go with a small group next time I know what to target and now you do too.",7,7,5,Mitch E.,"Brooklyn, NY",846,1050,451
3.0,9/15/2013,"Being a big fan of TopChef & seeing this restaurant feature on the cooking channel.  I said next time I'm in New York, I'm going to check this place out.  Well, after coming-up to visit my brother, we when here for brunch.  The brunch menu is limited compare to dinner.  One of the must have is the pretzel dumpling, and it did not disappoint.  Very good.  Also have the lobster Bao.  Also pretty good.  Breakfast ramen was okay, but had better ramen before.  The one really let down was the Korean fried chicken & waffle.  When you say Korean fried chicken, you expect double fried chicken meaning extra crispy skin.  The chicken wing was soggy.  So don't call it Korean Fried Chicken.  The waffle was actually pretty good on the other hand.  My brother mention that the New York Times said they been here a few times.  The first time when Chef Dale was there it was pretty dame good.  But, then the next time when He wasn't there not so much.  Any restaurant consistency is important.  I'm glad I tried this place, but most likely won't come back.",1,0,1,Doo P.,"Washington, DC",24,50,32

The halo halo took a while to eat, meanwhile the check was sitting at the table and I refused to open it, look at it and put my credit card in it until we were done eating about 20 minutes later. Our orders took a while to get to us, so please don't compensate for it by rushing your guests out! $10 for an ear of robata corn? $19 for a small plate of char siu and a few slices of watermelon is overpriced and not as good as the ones I grew up with. I could have gotten a full meal (not appetizer) with $19 elsewhere. The Korean fried chicken is not as crispy as I thought it would be.

2.0,9/8/2013,I like to support my local community fare and always try new places.I was a little disappointed in trying both the smoked pork with watermelon and the Korean Fried chicken. The pork portion quality was half fat and the KFC was bathed in a hot pepper encrusted deep fry sitting in a pool of hot sauce with only a few slices of peaches to help balance the heat. Other than bringing my own milkshake to even out the heat the balance of that dish really needs an updated side dish to compliment the spicy flavor. It is also far from being Korean in any way. The pretzle dumplings appetizers that appear to be a special menu item draw were also nothing close to being as good that they are built up to be.The wait staff also appeared to be bored/tired and indifferent while working in the loud and mixed local environment.I still would try the head Chef Dale Talde's other local Brooklyn restaurants since I think he certainly has a sense of adventure for food fusion but the Top Chef winner was certainly not there directing the kitchen on the evening when I was visiting.,1,0,0,Adam K.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,7,1
4.0,9/3/2013,"The fact that I forgot to review this place after eating here over half a year ago shows how it was not nearly as memorable as I hoped it would be. Nevertheless, it's still better than a number of these types of hipstery Asian places that are hot these days.I finally got my act together and arrived here promptly at 5:30 PM for dinner after leaving angry and disappointed two times prior to that when I was greeted with two hour waits.I don't think anything could live up to that kind of hype, along with all of the rave reviews Talde was getting for the last year and the fact that it's the restaurant of a Top Chef winner.Since it took forever to get in and I wasn't planning on coming back any time soon for another early bird special, I had no choice but to order practically everything:- Pretzel Pork & Chive Dumplings ($8)This is one of the dishes everyone is whining about being really great here. I didn't get the hype, they just seemed like pretty good fried dumplings to me. I didn't taste any pretzel, just some good greasy dumpling skin.- Hawaiian Bread Buns ($12)Three very little potato rolls, each with a different filling: Filipino pork sausage, fried fish, and a veggie one. These were pretty tasty, but probably not worth $4 each.- Kung Pao Chicken Wings (6 for $9)I don't remember these. So I don't think they were particularly great.- Chow Fun ($15)This was very strange. I've never ever seen Chow Fun like this before, but maybe I'm just being ignorant. It was served in a couple of tightly coiled balls of noodles, which were pretty crispy. The braised pork in the dish was very delicious, but I wasn't really down with the hard noodles.- Roast Chicken Dinner Ramen ($12)You know how people often scoff at ramen and wonder why we would bother paying so much for a bowl of cheap noodles? I typically find those people to be fools, except in this case, where this bowl was a major letdown, and was indeed not much better than a cheap bowl of instant ramen. Definitely skip this one.- Vegetable Fried Rice ($10)Luckily they were able to accommodate my worthless shellfish allergy and they were able to make us this instead of the Shrimp Fried Rice. I always love fried rice, and this dish did not disappoint.- Halo Halo ($10)Some good bites, but overall kinda gross. I don't get the appeal of this traditional Filipino dessert, which is just a mish mash of all kinds of ingredients that do not go well together. They hipsterize it here by adding Cap'n Crunch to the mix, which does not improve things. About half way through, after yet another bite of something crunchy and something mushy along with a slice of a mandarin orange, I threw my hands up in submission and couldn't continue on any longer.I was torn between 3 and 4 stars. I guess it was mostly the hype, the long wait and relative disappointment that would bring me down to 3 (and maybe that nasty Halo Halo), as otherwise the food here is pretty delicious and you can definitely have a very solid, satisfying meal. I think some of the hype has died down now, so I wouldn't mind visiting again to try some of the new stuff on the menu.",11,6,4,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1694,69834

4.0,8/28/2013,"Finally made it here for dinner.  I got there a little before 6:30 and the restaurant is about half full.  I'm guessing it's because Park Slope is a bit of a trek, by the time we finished our meal it was a full house.We ordered the pretzel pork & chive dumplings (4), kung pao chicken wings (6 for small order), whole roasted branzino, oyster & bacon pad thai, and the king crab fried rice (note: this is A LOT for 2 people and we knew that when we ordered, we planned on taking home some of the fried rice).  Boys and Girls, Talde means business with those dumplings - they were crispy and full, the spicy mustard that it came with had a touch of sesame oil and it is addicting.  The kung pao chicken was okay, I wouldn't order it again next time.  The whole brazino was fresh, boneless, and moist - it's quite a large portion so it's definitely meant to be shared.  I didn't care much for the tomato based sauce on the inside but the fish itself was so good I just ignored the filling.  The oyster & bacon pad thai was an interesting concept, I wish there were more oysters and bacon and that they use less batter on the oyster.  But I'm into the creativity and novelty of the dish, I might give it another try in the future.  The fried rice held its own - we were beyond full at this point, but we still finished half of it. For drinks, I tried the sangria and the nine roses, and I preferred the latter because I was in the mood for a stiff drink.The service was pleasant and helpful, they refreshed our plates halfway into  the meal and they brought a bowl and warm wet cloth napkins for the wings.  The kitchen is super busy, the chef is calling out orders for the tables all night long.  I'm impressed by the smooth and efficient operation of the restaurant.  Talde reminds me of the Brooklyn version of Wong, but it's better and more affordable.  Go with anyone that will appreciate a creative spin on Asian cuisine and good food.",1,0,0,Jenny L.,"Queens, NY",95,191,288

4.0,8/26/2013,"Quite delicious lunch! They just opened up sidewalk seating so it is perfect for those nice summer days. We had the chicken and waffles, the char siu pork, and the pretzel pork and chive dumplings. All were amazing! The chicken and waffles came with this coconut brown butter syrup which I could eat by the bucketful. I put it on everything. I definitely have to try to make that at home. The chicken came with a very flavorful sauce though so the syrup kind of contrasted with it a bit, but it was still amazing on its own and left me to save the sauce for everything else! The dumplings were prepared perfectly too. The crisp wrapper had just enough bite to it, though I wasn't a fan of the spicy mustard (I always leave that on the table at Chinese restaurants). Coconut Brown Butter Syrup to the rescue! I drizzled that all over those dumplings and it elevated the tasty level for sure! Finally the char siu pork was super flavorful and tender. A bit fatty, but that is how it is prepared I believe. Service is friendly, prices are a bit much for the portion size, but you do get what you pay for.

5.0,7/23/2013,"My husband and I had been wanting to try Talde for a while after hearing some great things. We were hesitant as they don't take reservations and we heard wait times can get a bit high.We went on a Saturday night around 7:30 and were quoted an hour and a half wait so we decided to wait at the bar and get some drinks. We got our drinks within five minutes and the hostess came to tell us there was room to sit at the counter facing the kitchen if we anted it. So we ended up getting seated within 10 minutes. Hooray!We got the Kung Pao Chicken wings for an appetizer and oh my gosh, they were delicious! We wished we had ordered more than six.For entree's my husband got the Korean Fried Chicken and I got the Orange Beef. We got a side of the Banana Leaf Sticky Rice. The chicken was really good. The beef dish was pretty good, but the chicken definitely took the win between the two. The rice was okay, but I didn't love the flavor.For drinks I had the Watermelon Margarita which was really nice and my husband got the Starfruit Sangria, which was quite spicy and wasn't his favorite. For dessert we splurged and got their cookie bar thing and it was really rich and really good.We will def. be back!",1,1,2,Danielle R.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,56,0
4.0,7/22/2013,"Have I told, you lately, that I love you?I have been wanting to visit Talde for a while now and finally got to go Saturday for brunch. The trains were all funky so it took a while but well worth it.The restaurant itself is really nicely decorated. I appreciate the old Chinese woodwork/trim and shelving mixed with modern Chinese decor.I have to admit, I went there for the dumplings. Pork and chive Pretzel dumplings!? Amazing. They were crisp, delicious, hot and exciting. Everyone serves dumplings, but nobody does it like Talde.There were 6 of us and I felt as though we got one of everything on the menu. I think some items are missing from the online menu so I will review as much as I can.PRETZEL PORK & CHIVE DUMPLINGS -  served spicy mustard, crispy and yummy.CRISPY AVOCADO BAO - steamed buns with crispy avocado inside. Good but a bit overpriced for what it is. (2 on plate)CHAR SIU SMOKED PORK SHOULDER - served with peanuts and scallions (?) on top. Crispy carmellized outside and juicy and tender inside. This was #2 on my list.KOREAN CHICKEN WINGS & WAFFLES - served with delightful coconut brown butter syrup - spicy chicken wings in a creamy sauce and I think only one waffle which was odd since it was a shared plate... overall really good flavor though!TATER TOTS - sriracha ketchup. Seriously, we all grew up with them but these are exceptionally crisp and the surprise spice in the ketchup is really nice.We also had corn cakes with ham that were good and I had a watermelon margarita which I highly recommend.

5.0,7/9/2013,"I've been to Talde twice, and each time I was not disappointed. Both times I made the effort to sit at the Chef's table because the action definitely adds to the experience. I'm so glad the Dale Talde implemented this feature because anyone who sits there gets to see all the amazing good coming out and how much fun the cooks are having. I love their dress code- everyone has to wear fitted hats. There is so much character at this restaurant it is so easy to see why they are always busy and extremely successful. I've been a huge fan of Dale Talde since he was on Top Chef- even went to his FWW event last year at Buddakan- but in no way am I being bias. The first time I went there I ordered the Fluke with black bean butter. The fluke was cooked perfectly, BUT THAT SAUCE. Something as simple as black bean sauce, which is a staple in many Asian kitchens, and BUTTER. OH THE BUTTER. It was perfect. WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT. I paired that with the savory Chinese sausage sticky rice, which is something that I also wonder why I didn't think of it... oh right... it's because I'm not as awesome as Dale. We also got the trio of sliders, also delicious. The second time I went, I finally took the boyfriend, the *ELITIST*, and if you find the longest review for Talde, that is most likely him. They didn't have the fluke anymore, they had something better. LOBSTERRRRRRR. And yes, I ordered it for the sake of that delicious sauce but the already buttery lobster elevated it. I usually avoid shellfish because I hate opening them, but they made it so easy to devour. OMG I WANT SOME NOW. I don't even remember what Garreth G. because my lobster was heaven. He covered it though. (yelp.com/biz/talde-brook…) I'm wondering what the next black bean butter concoction will be.... Shrimp? Crawfish? I'm so excited to find out! The halo halo is definitely something to get. I get it- I've had Filipino halo-halo many times, but this one is refreshing. Not too sweet, light and a great way to end a heavy meal. I heard they change the ingredients seasonally. I wish there was an option to add ice cream or flan, but that's just gluttony. Lastly, I want to tell everyone how amazing their crispy oyster and bacon pad thai is. It's self explanatory. I don't ever want plain ol pad thai ever ever ever again. Dale has done such an amazing job in integrating Filipino cuisine with familiar Asian food.

There was a bit of a wait for a table (but it was Saturday in NYC, so this is neither a problem nor a surprise, complainers), so we ordered drinks and some appetizers at the bar. Then we moved to our table, which was tight, but with efficient bussers, never seemed to be a problem with the multiple entrees that we tried. The bartender and the server were clearly having fun and highly competent, which is the best kind of service. The decor is nice. My only complaint is that it is a cavernous space, the music was a bit loud (Fucking Problem is an incredibly catchy song, but I'm not sure if it's a good fit at dinner), and as the volume of other patrons grew louder, it was hard to hear everyone around me.All told, we tried the perilla leaves, kung pao chicken wings, pretzel pork and chive dumplings, kale salad, lobster tom kha, whole roasted branzino, Korean fried chicken, smoked char siu pork shoulder, orange beef ribeye and broccoli, and shrimp egg foo yung fried rice. For drinks: BBQ negroni, lychee martini, watermelon margarita, starfruit sangria, nine roses, a special cocktail with green tea and whisky, and a bottle of rose.And the halo halo for dessert.

4.0,6/30/2013,"What a great menu! What great flavors! What great dishes! And here is why!My girlfriend and I sat at the chef's table so you can see first hand how they order and cook the goods. To sit here you have to wait longer because they only have 5 seats but if your a hungry mofo than chef's table is not necessary. We planned to order a lot and take some back to Jersey City but ended up eating everything.I would recommend the mini sliders which were on sweet toasted hawaiin bread buns. One slider had the meaty juicy filipino pork sausage which was basically like a tosino in filipino terms. The second slider was a portabello muchroom that had the best aroma of a mushroom and tasted just as good. The last was a crispy cod fish (changes based on the market) that was so flaky, crunchy, and cooked perfectly. Also you must get the bacon friend oyster pad thai. I love fried oysters because of New Orleans Acme House and I wish more places served it. Talde does it justice. It mixes so well with the noodles that I wish I thought about it earlier. It tastes even better with the infusion of thick cut bacon. Can't go wrong with Bacon! Unless your vegetarian but I'm pretty sure you can order it without it. We also go the black bean butter lobster. I'm not sure if this is on the everyday menu but it was so freakin' delicious. They had it cut up for you already and it was so easy to take out the shell that no lobster meat was left to go uneaten. Talde definitely does it better than most Chinese restaurants I go to where its too much black bean sauce and hard to take out the meat with just a fork and knife. Last entree was the Korean fried chicken. I've had fried chicken but this was a good rendition of the Korean fried chicken. The skin was super crunchy and the meat was white as teeth can get. It was juicy and tender just as chicken should be and it was bedded on top of this bbq sauce that gave that extra tangy taste. However, I wish I knew you can order it ""SOS"" the spicy rendition of it but I wanted something that gave me an extra kick. Finally if you want something refreshing from all the carbs and protein you should try the halo halo. I was a skeptic at first since I am Filipino and his halo halo was different than the traditional way to do it. I won't go into details but lets just say the the captain crunch cereal and the fresh raspberry works so well. Also it's not as heavy as a traditional halo halo is suppose to be with beans and condensed milk and sugar. They make it light and refreshing with the shaved ice and different other gelatin's in there that its like food for the soul. My only big criticism would be I wish it had a piece of leche flan and ube ice cream to brighten the party. I would come back to sit back and enjoy the rediculicious (soon to be patented) food again!",0,1,1,Garreth G.,"Stockton, CA",472,389,51

We were quoted a ridiculous wait time on Saturday night. So we went across the street to Applewood and ate dinner there. As we were paying, we got a call from Talde saying they had a table for us. What did we do? Isn't it obvious? We had a 2nd dinner here.Perilla Leaf. Kung Pao Chicken Wings. Crispy Oyster + Bacon Pad Thai. Seared Scallops. Shrimp Toast with fried egg & sausage gravy. Yup. I was full. But I ate anyway.The perilla leaves had some chillies on it that left me in dire need of water. They were delicious but packed a punch for such a tiny thing. The scallops had a lovely black bean paste sauce on them. The shrimp toast, my God... so so delicious yet so so gluttonous. I loved it. And those chicken wings with the housemade ranch, gah! So. Good.We did leave with a lot of the wings in a box as well as the Pad Thai. Stomachs were at max capacity.Until brunch the next day. We had no wait (well, except for them to open the doors) for a table for brunch since we arrived at opening (11AM).I dined with Kevin L and we also tore it up with- tots, the lobster baos, the shiitake and scallion chang fun, Korean chicken + waffles and char siu pork shoulder. The chicken was a little dry/over cooked but still enjoyable. The lobster bao was definitely my favorite. The pork was also a very tasty dish. And you can never go wrong with tots.

Vegetable and Crispy Fish Bread Buns - The veggie one had one small mushroom and was all bread. The fish in the fish ones were overcooked, but I liked the light and crispy outside. The service is attentive. The wait for a table is ridiculous. We arrived to an 80% empty restaurant well after opening time and they still made us wait and offered us drink menus.

We ordered the Chow Fun, Black Bean Brown Butter Lobster and Korean Fried Chicken. The Chow Fun was Fun-nomenal. I loved the way the flat noodles were fried and crispy on the edges. The pork shank was so tasty and eating it with the noodles was orgasmic. The lobster dish was pretty good. I'm not a fan of black beans, but all the flavors were mixed well and the lobster itself was buttery and easy to eat out of the shell. The Korean fried chicken was also not bad. To be fair, I was already stuffed from the other two entrees to enjoy the chicken. However, I really liked the peaches soaked in the spicy kimchee yogurt. For dessert, we had the Cap'n Crunch Halo Halo. I was never a fan of Cap'n Crunch as a kid but I wanted to try it. I had no idea Dale was Filipino. As soon as they put the dessert on my table, I saw a smorgasbord of sweets and treats in shaved ice and I immediately thought of my bestie who is Filipina.

People who don't know how to ""taste"" oversalt everything. Just sayin'.Fried chicken and waffles were terrible. The worst I've ever had. Chicken had no meat and was over fried and had the most disgusting sauce. It was so salty and smothered in such a wanna-be spicy/tangy sauce. Just such a miss! And the waffle was undercooked. As gross as a frozen waffle from Trader Joe's. Terrible.Lobster bao was the best thing we had. Finally, you could actually taste the flavor of the ingredient. That being said, it was still lacking...but, at least they didn't oversalt this one!Also had the fried rice with sausage and cheese...it was very meh. The fried rice I make is wayyy better at home. They should use Chinese sausage and at least avoid the over processed Kraft American cheese taste. It was just heavy and all the good flavors were masked by the cheese.Talde's got nothing on flavor.

No problem, we'll just sit at the bar and order cocktails. I enjoyed the specialty cocktails, but they were small and missing any kick relative to their price. For example, I think I ordered a ginger margarita (maybe not a margarita, but something with ginger in the title)....where's the taste of ginger. I mean ginger is in the title, not as a sub ingredient. I kind of expect to taste it. Oh well. On to the table. Service was great from the moment we entered until we finally exited. Kudos for that. The best thing about dining with the group of friends that I came with is we all love food, so probably ordered any and everything of interest on the menu with plans to share for all. Talde dishes are made for sharing, so make sure that you come with people that you like. Everything was good. No full out disappointments, but everything isn't rave worthy. The fried rice was good, Korean chicken hit the spot, but wasn't great. Pork shoulder was tasty. I just wasn't overly wowed as expected, but I definitely did enjoy the food. Hmm this is hard.

If you're going to have a Chef's Table (a bar/stools against the open kitchen) its because the kitchen is well run, clean and sort of inspiring for some reason (great talent, colorful ingredients, etc). Instead I got a front row seat to cooks checking facebook on their phones, conveniently arranged among the service plates, cursing/ribbing each other, and other not inspiring events. Food was ok, fried rice and guag dish is about two pieces too large (four total) and I can't imagine they wanted the rice to come out that hard. Chow Fun was ok, meat sort of tough and cold, noodle was cool. Interesting texture is the best I can say about it. I guess overall I'll say this. I don't cook, but I know my favorite food is about passion and fun and presentation. Doesn't have to be fancy at all, but certainly shouldn't be sloppy.

I was very concerned about having to wait forever for a table and resigned to the fact that I might have to get some pretzel dumplings to go. Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised when we were told the wait was only 30 minutes. We settled into the bar and ordered a few local brews. Within a few minutes a table opened up! We were seated with a great view of the kitchen. I was a bit disappointed because Chef Talde was no where in sight. Regardless, I was super excited about the menu, but narrowing down our order was challenging. We decided on the pretzel dumplings, Hawaiian buns, smoked pork shoulder, bacon and oyster pad thai, and shrimp fried rice.  Everything was delicious, but the pork shoulder with watermelon was unbelievably good! I love the combo of the two together. You should really check this place out for yourself..

The size of the lobster pieces was comparable to a popped popcorn. Oh and salty. They charged $20+ for this? Shame. Korean Fried Chicken - half a chicken, dry, and skin was not crunchy. Not sure what made this Korean style though because the hot sauce that accompanied it was sriracha. But it was the only entree that was not salty... Actually, other than the sriracha, it didn't have much flavor. Also over $20. Eh. Oyster Bacon Pad Thai - Noodles were cooked perfectly. The fried oysters had a nice crunch. But again... Salty.

Maybe it was because I was hungover and my body was craving healthy things but I ordered 2 of the kale salad because it was THAT delicious.

Now on to the food.Total asian comfort food. We had the Kung Pao wings, and they were so good. Crispy, full of flavor and nice kick. Cool house made buttermilk to cut the heat. Then we had the pretzel, pork and chive dumplings. Also very nice. We were treated to the Hawaiian buns for free, and also the Yuzu guacamole. Very good, each one blew my mind.For the mains we shared the Korean fried chicken and Crispy Oyster and Bacon Pad Thai. I gotta say the K.F.C. was really great. The flavors blended together perfectly, and presentation wise, it was an eye pleasing dish. The Pad Thai was phenomenal. Not as heavy on the thai flavors (fish sauce, shrimp paste) as a typical pad thai, but I understood why. The oysters made up for it and the bacon was thick cubed and that high quality smoked kind us un-kosher Brooklynites are used to. So friggen good!And if that wasn't enough, which for 2 ppl it was MORE than enough! Not only did we leave with some leftovers, but they sent us home with Dale's 5,000 dollar bars. On the house even. So rad. Now, in conclusion, I can't say everyone will want to wait 2.5 hours, or get the coveted ""foodie"" kitchen seats, or be comped with multiple dishes and beers, but it's a blast!..

It just so happened that I ended up cat sitting in the same neighborhood a few weeks later, so I stopped over for some take out. You have to try these dumplings, they're outstanding. Basically next time you want dumplings, make the bee line for their front door, bzzz bzzz. Talde really brings it, and I would say they're certainly king in the Asian fusion area. The dumplings are a must have app, but on my first visit I also got the Hawaiian sliders which you'll also find pleasing to the palate.When I visited most recently, I went for dinner. They're not open before five most days, and we went on a Friday. It would be best if you booked reservations beforehand, otherwise its quite a long wait. We ended up sitting at the chefs table, a counter next to the kitchen. It was cool, but I would rather have been seated at a regular table, and you will too. We split the Soba noodle dish and the pork shoulder entree. The smoked pork shoulder was excellent, real tender. As far as the Soba noodle dish, I would try something different next time. They're are a bunch of interesting noodle choices, and it was daunting decision. I think I would go with the Pad Thai next trip, looks and sounds awesome The last thing I would mention is that we got the banana leaf sticky rice, it was good, next time I'll reach for the everything roti though.

5.0,4/16/2013,"I had a fantastic dinner at Talde for my birthday.  Being a big Top Chef fan, I wanted to come here for a while, and my expectations were high.  Good to know that reservations are only for groups of 6-8, and this is a small restaurant that, I would say, holds less than fifty people at full capacity.  We had a group of 5, so I couldn't make reservations.  We showed up around 5:30 on a Saturday night and the wait was long--about an hour, which, depending on your temperament, can be a dealbreaker.It wasn't for us, however, and we waited at the bar and had drinks instead.  Their signature cocktails are a great blend of sweet, tart, and spice for your palette.  Sipped a friend's Chinatown (rum, applejack, lime, brown sugar, and black pepper) and found it was tasty, but too tart for me.  I had the plum wine bellini which was perfect for me, as I like my drinks sweet.The bar staff, as well as the wait staff, were all very friendly, informative, and attentive.  Bartender gave us drink and beer recommendations and chatted with us while we waited for a table.  Our waiter was very informative on how to order (family style), the daily specials, and what was best on the menu.  An experience with the staff can make or break a restaurant, and I felt welcomed by the staff here.  Throughout the meal, which easily ran 2-3 hours of food and conversation, we never felt rushed to finish and no one took our plates until we were completely done--and yet, we also didn't feel neglected, like we were sitting at our table way past due. A great balance.As I said, the restaurant's style is to serve dishes family style, which suited our group very well--we all wanted to try everything on the menu!  I thought we ordered a lot when ordering, but it came out to just enough food for everyone to be full, not stuffed, and satisfied.  We had the Perilla leaf, Pretzel Dumplings, and Spicy Mango Salad for appetizers.  I actually wasn't impressed with the appetizers: the Perilla leaf was a tiny and forgettable amuse bouche (which they should tell you ahead of time) and the Spicy Mango Salad was heavy on the heat.  (A reminder that the mango used is green and unripened, meaning that it isn't the typical sweet mango everyone is used to.)  I was excited about the Pretzel Pork and Chive Dumplings, as I've heard many good things, but the ""pretzel"" crust wasn't as pretzel-like as I expected; the only thing separating this dumpling from the ""5 for $1"" dumplings I love on Mosco Street in Chinatown were the speckles of salt sprinkled on top.  Tasty, but not memorable.What was fantastic, however, were the entrees.  We ordered the Crispy Oyster & Bacon Pad Thai, the Korean Fried Chicken, the Char Siu Pork Shoulder, and the Black Angus Ribeye.  Everything was cooked to perfection and mouth-wateringly delicious.  The Pad Thai has big chunks of slab bacon--no little strips here--and was full of flavor.  I don't usually like fried chicken but this one was delectable, fried perfectly without being greasy, and paired with a tangy sauce and sweet grapes.  I was excited about Char Siu Pork, expecting that sweet, gloppy pork you get in a bao, but this wasn't gloppy or overly sauced at all, just a well-seared pork shoulder that tasted amazing.  And the Ribeye...I had reservations about getting this, but the boyfriend insisted on beef, and it did not let us down.  Everything was so delicious, we all found ourselves sopping up remaining sauces with our side order of white rice (off-menu, but just ask for it and they'll provide).Talde doesn't have a dessert list but they have a fruit-centric dessert and a ""5-G Cookie,"" a chocolate-covered salted caramel wonder that Dale Talde made while on Top Chef--and it won him $5,000, hence the name.  It was crumbly and dense but delicious, and a perfect way to end the meal.While some people have issues with the ""Asian-ness"" of the menu--some say it's no better than food you get in Flushing, some argue it's too American and all over the place--I felt it had the perfect mix of modern Asian cuisine through Dale Talde's creative lens.   The flavors, as well as little accents in the restaurant's styling--from the old-school china plates to the chef himself overseeing the night's operations with a plastic quart of home-brewed tea--made me feel Talde's heart is in the right place.  I'm very glad I finally got to make it here, and would go again in a heartbeat.",0,0,0,Arielle M.,"Hackettstown, NJ",15,53,0
5.0,4/15/2013,"This place is amazing. We went for our anniversary on a Friday night. Only had to wait 15 minutes, which is fine because we just grabbed a drink at the bar and relaxed until our table was ready. We were seated in the far corner, which was very nice. The waitress was super friendly and took time to answer our questions and make recommendations (since we'd never been before). We ordered Korean chicken wings, pad thai with fried clams and bacon, rib eye, and banana sticky rice- all absolutely delicious! We couldn't believe the flavors and textures! My recommendation, however, is to order maybe one side.appetizer and one entree for two people.

5.0,4/10/2013,"by far my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn. Dale is the man, and the rest of the staff at the restaurant is so incredibly accommodating and friendly that my wife and I make it a two/three times a month, goto spot. If i could roll the Korean Chicken into a joint, i would smoke it. It's like crack. The kung pao wings are also ridiculous, as are the pretzel dumplings and bread buns.

1.0,4/8/2013,"My boyfriend and I have been wanting to try this place more than anywhere. We finally made the trip from manhattan and i am sorry to say it was the WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY ENTIRE LIFE. After sitting for a while, we asked our waiter if we could order some appetizers and drinks. he said no, hed only take our entire order at once and then walked away. After we were ready we asked him if we could order again. We ordered 1 beer each, 2 appetizers, and 2 entrees. The waiter walked away and came back over with the manager a couple of minutes later and said he wouldn't serve us alcohol because we seemed like we already drank that day. Yes, we had been to brunch about 6 hours earlier and had 3 bloody marys each. But we showed NO signs of being drunk, we were completely respectful of the atmosphere, and we were not doing anything different than any other customer. It was completely offensive and ridiculous and I am still so confused as to why they thought we were unable to have a beer. This makes me wonder whether they would even allow anyone to order more than 2 beers with dinner. I WILL NEVER GO BACK HERE AND AM STRONGLY SUGGESTING THAT YOU DO NOT EITHER. THE STAFF IS RUDE, DISRESPECTFUL, and OFFENSIVE. The only bright side of the evening was that we went to a much better and classier restaurant after (one that didnt have the sun shining directly into my boyfriends eyes because at talde the tables are in really bad positions for the sun to shine in and reflect off the glass) and actually joked with the waiter at the other place about how ridiculous it was that we were not served at Talde.

My husband dropped his chopsticks and two seconds later they were picked up and replaced. Our water glasses never went empty, our server was fantastic (excellent drink recommendation!) and the place itself has a really great vibe.To be honest, I expected the food to lean more towards the Asian side vs. the American side. Perhaps I'm not the target audience.- Pretzel Pork chive dumplings -- just ok- Kung Pow chicken could have been spicier- Lychee martini was out-of-this-world good- Pork shoulder char siu -- way too sweet for my taste - Steak dish -- very good- Sticky Rice side dish - flipping amazingMy favorite part of the entire meal was the dessert.

However, the service is great, and they have an awesome hiphop playlist.I ordered:Hawaiian buns with filipino pork sausage: My filipino taste buds were happy, especially with the available vinegar placed at each table (THANK YOU). I would probably order two of these next time.Fried oyster and bacon pad thai - the fried oyster doesn't really mesh well with the pad thai, but then again, I've eaten nearly all of my pad thai with shrimp. They gave a generous half slice of lime, and I think I squeezed too much juice. Largely portioned.Smoked Char Siu Pork Shoulder - I was disappointed with this dish, because it tasted just like the roast pork available in chinatown for around $5, except it had peanuts on top.Everything Roti Bread - I really liked this side. I ate it with the pork shoulder.Halo halo - The mango bits and captain crunch were nice.

2.0,3/25/2013,"In Garden City for a wedding this weekend, we shot over to Brooklyn before heading back to Massachusetts to have brunch at Talde yesterday (3-24-13).  Being avid Top Chef fans we enjoyed watching Dale on both his regular and All Star seasons and his food always stood out to us and our Asian-leaning palates.  We visited Buddakan (his previous restaurant) in Chelsea two summers ago and really enjoyed the flavors and overall experience.  Unfortunately, the food was a major let down here.  Shockingly average and pedestrian with a few execution errors.  We ordered a few plates to share:Korean Fried Chicken and Waffles: I'll start off with really the only positive for me and that was the coconut brown butter syrup.  I could drink this!  It's something I would purchase if sold and I WILL try to replicate at home.  What bummed me out the most was the chicken.  Korean fried chicken is touted for having an egg-shell thin and ultra-crisp crunch and what I got were your average, local pizza shop fried chicken wings that came in a buffalo wing-like sauce.  There wasn't any type of discernible crunch and if there was one coming out of the fryer, I'm not sure tossing them in a liquidy buffalo sauce was the right move.  The sauce didn't make any sense, as the appeal of chicken and waffles to me is the play of salty fried chicken and the sweetness of the waffle and syrup and this version of sweet and spicy just didn't have the same allure.  If he were going the way of a hot sauce why not do something with gochujang, a Korean hot pepper paste?  It's an obvious move in my opinion, given the Korean connection and the fact that it wouldn't saturate the crust like a wetter sauce would.  I think doing a Korean brine (which could be injected to ensure crispiness when it comes time to fry) would have guaranteed a juicy, flavorful, salty seasoning from inside that would have worked better with the sweetness of the waffle.  More attention needs to be paid on the crispiness of the wing if they're going to go out of their way to call it 'Korean Fried' and while I didn't care for the hot sauce, I would expect someone who was on Top Chef twice to marry the sweet, salty, and spicy better to make me a believer.  A lot of work for a wing, sure, but Youtube 'Buddakan Pekin Duck' and look at the crazy process Dale's old restaurant goes through to make that duck a hit!Shrimp Toast with Chinese Sausage Gravy: I enjoyed the pronounced shrimp flavor but this whole dish was a salt bomb.  I think it would have been better if such a heavy hand wasn't used with the salt.  Having read a few reviews now it seems as if others feel the same way.  I love Chinese sausage and was bummed there wasn't really much of it in the gravy.Pretzel Dumplings: This was an obvious order given that this might be his signature dish.  The crunch was good and the pork and chive filling wasn't unlike any other pork and chive filling I've ever had.  The bites that had that thick, round 'pretzel salt' were good and I believe that's the way Talde probably wants it presented but there wasn't enough salt covering the dumpling to make sure you got that in every bite.  Overall, these were just OK and I'm not 100% sure I understand the hype surrounding this appetizer.Bacon Pad Thai: Your run of the mill pad thai.  I live in a culinary wasteland here in Western MA and I've had these same flavors before.  I just expected something 'more.'  The service, from the hostess to our waitress was very good.  The place is really very small.  We couldn't believe how tiny the open kitchen was; I think food trucks have more room to work with.  Our seats were by the window facing the kitchen and we were no more then an inch or two from the next table.  The waitress was serving their food over my left shoulder.   The noise level here is LOUD.  My girlfriend asked me to repeat myself at least a half a dozen times.  These are things that I don't normally care about or bring up to friends when they ask how my experience was, but when the food is just 'meh' all these other factors really start to bother you and weigh down the overall experience.We didn't read any Yelp reviews prior to our brunch but as someone who is usually critical of his experiences I felt a little better that we weren't the only ones with problems as we scrolled through Yelp and Chowhound on our ride back.  The food wasn't necessarily bad but it was by no means special.  The title on one of the review threads on Chowhound is 'Talde: How did he get so far in Top Chef Allstars?' and that's how we both felt leaving.  If you live in the area and aren't a fussy diner, I don't think you'd have many qualms here.  If you're a 'foodie' I think you'll be let down.  I was unimpressed enough with the flavors that I wouldn't return, and given NY's stature in the food world, I wouldn't recommend the place, especially to out-of-towners.",0,0,0,Bryce P.,"Springfield, MA",0,9,0

This is why I take away a star :((2) The plates are designed to be shared.  The more people you have, the more food you get to try!Some of my favorites are the rib eye, the fluke, the dumplings, and the lobster noodles.  It's also pretty cool that Talde himself is usually there, and will stop and chat to make sure you're enjoying your meal.

3.0,3/22/2013,"Several misses and really long waiting time for food (we were at a table from 9:30pm to 12:30am) detract a star from this otherwise lovely establishment. Disclaimers: I came here with people who make a lot of money and are used to spending it on tasting menus, I arrived late and didn't have a say in the ordering process (not that I minded), and I have a small appetite - and we did this family style. I would've wanted to order the kale salad, the lobster tom kha, the everything roti bread, and the yuzu guacamole, which sound like better fusions to me. We ordered the following: Pretzel pork & chive dumplings - I had one piece, and it was not memorable. Then again, I often make my own dumplings (because it's so easy to come up with different stuffings), so I didn't quite see the point in getting these. I don't think I tasted the pretzel, but that may have been due to my undiscerning palate. I felt that it was a normal dumpling. Crispy oyster & bacon pad thai - The concept sounds better than it tasted - or at least, it was exactly the sum of its parts. I like oysters and bacon, but I expected more from this dish. It ended up tasting like a regular pad thai to me, with oyster pieces in it. Whole roasted branzino - I think the tomato sauce overwhelmed the fish, and as much as I usually love fusions of this sort, I was not impressed. Banana leaf flavor should usually stand out, but tomato is pretty strong. Smoked char siu pork shoulder - This was definitely really good, and I wanted more of it. Unfortunately, it was pretty small (well, we WERE sharing among 6 people), so I didn't have as much of it as I would've liked. Korean fried chicken - Can Korean fried chicken ever go wrong? I liked the concept of the different flavors - spicy kimchee yogurt, mint, grapes (and the grapes were delicious in the yogurt sauce) - but I felt that it was really just Korean fried chicken. I'd probably go elsewhere for this. #369 (market vegetables & green sambal) - My favorite, by far. If this were the only thing I had eaten at Talde, I would've given Talde a solid 4 stars. If all of the other food was of this calibre, I would've given 5 stars. (Well ... and if service was a bit faster and the lighting not as dim). The pistachio green sambal is unbelievable - full of intense, complex flavors. It really drenches the vegetables in an ethereal blanket, and I gobbled this dish up. My peers probably thought that was weird considering my relative lack of enthusiasm for the other plates, but this was truly superb. I went home thinking about it and how I could possibly make it. The recipe is actually available online, but it involves smoking. Darn. :( I'd love to try to make it some time. For dessert, we got the Cap'n crunch halo halo. I was incredibly disappointed with this. The cap'n crunch was really the redeeming factor of this dessert, but everything else (including the boba) had a firm, overly chewy texture, and I found myself avoiding the copious amounts of jelly. I think we all agreed that it sounded (and looked) more exciting than it actually tasted. Overall, given the ambiance (my eyes kind of hurt after a while in such dim lighting) and the hit-or-miss quality, I don't know if I'd come back. I did think that I would've preferred other choices, though; when I go to fusion places, I try to get things that sound like they've melded the flavors together better.

They came out hot, with a nice chunk of flavorful pork on the inside with chives.This might be the best pad thai I have ever had, a bold statement, I know! Big chunks of salty thick cut bacon, just a few (maybe 2) fried oysters placed atop. The flavor was smooth yet intense, not greasy with a refreshing taste of basil (and cilantro?) with plenty of peanuts and egg. The Lobster Thom Kha had meaty chunks of lobster, well worth it. A strong lemongrass flavor and a noodle soup that made me wish I was at home for a moment so I could have done some gratuitous slurping.

When it's busy, you can't expect someone to see you within a nanosecond of trying to flag down someone on the wait staff, but that would happen anywhere, and Talde does get super-busy.The space is great. Nice big bar in the front with some seats along the windows, where you can relax and have a drink while waiting.

Worth it for the food!Believe everything you read about the sausage egg and cheese fried rice. It is crazy: savory and cheesy and impossible not to finish. It seems so simple but I can't imagine trying to make it myself. You'll end up getting more than one bowl, especially if you're in a group. And you'll still fight for the last spoonful.Also great: the pretzel and chive dumplings (totally addictive), the mushroom and scallion chang fun (not greasy at all), the lemongrass chicken (though it takes a bit of work to put the romaine and chicken together, and i don't tend to want to do work on weekend mornings), the shrimp toast (a little salty but still good), and the korean chicken wings (very spicy).

FOUR times we have gone on a Friday or Saturday, fully ready and expecting a long wait. We've been in parties from 2-4, told wait times 40-70 minutes. EVERY time the wait was 1.5-2 times what we were told. Tell me 60 minutes and make me wait 70, no problem. 1 hour 45 minutes, PROBLEM! If you won't take reservations, you owe it to your customers to be honest about the wait, or figure out how to get a realistic picture of the turnaround. Unfortunately it overshadows the meal, when people sit down grumpy and ravenous. Then they order too much and end up overstuffed. Take it from me, I know. I kept giving Talde one more chance, since I like the food so much (and the bartenders are outstanding), but I just can't do it any more. It'll have to be a Wednesday night place for me. It's a shame. This seems like an easy thing to fix, and they've been open long enough to have taken care of it by now.",0,0,0,Cay T.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,24,0

I would recommend the dumplings, I think they really stood out. Also shared the roti, pork shoulder, fried rice, chicken wings, pad thai, shrimp toast, and tater tots. All were good but not anything more than that. Each had a slight twist, but didn't really make it to that next level, except the tater tots were completely just normal and seemed to just be thrown on the menu.

3.0,2/24/2013,"The food is very tasty, you'll need to order more than usual (think tapas sized portions), and the prices are closer inline with Manhattan prices than Park Slope. A+ for design the space has a great feel and warmth to it. Right now this is a still a new popular spot in PS so for dinner there tends to be a wait if you do not have a reservation, and though it is not a small space it's not cavernous so I recommend making a reservation.  The staff is nice, but like all popular places you kind of deal  with small portion of the staff being a tad blasé about customers; new popular restaurants sometimes take on the zeitgeist of being finally invited to a cool party by the cool people, so you kind of just go with being shrugged off a little, but again this is coming from the jerk who used the word zeitgeist. My only qualm would be with brunch. What they are offering is pretty much variations off the dinner menu. It was a last minute thing where we ended eating at the bar and ordering two dishes, two teas, and one side, and for the forty some odd dollar bill we left way hungry. Brunch is such a Park Slope tradition so much so that people will actually ask you where you go for brunch, and as a rule brunch menus tend to be designed to be slightly cheaper and usually a little more food. That was not the case at Talde where it was again small tapas style plates. Granted, I have not returned to try brunch there in over 3 months so maybe they have fixed this - if not I suggest having a brunch menu where entree items are proportionally in line with a first meal of the day.",0,0,0,Joe B.,"Brooklyn, NY",23,34,0
3.0,2/24/2013,"I wanted to like Talde, i had very high hopes. As a Filipino it is great to see the growing influence of my culture in some mainstream culinary spotlight. That being said, the food was just ok and portions were small in comparison to cost. And the service was obnoxious. ambience: very beautiful restaurantordered: the shrimp toast (first few bites were great but because of the saltiness, in literally each component of that dish, it was hard to keep eating) chow fun (this was prepared differently than i had ever had, the noodles were rolled and fried lightly so both the soft and crunch texture was there, taste was also on point) this was my favorite dish, and then we shared the korean fried chicken (the sauce was more like a buffalo sauce which i was ok with but my boyfriend is korean and was hoping for a more authentic kimchee flavor. it is also literally fried chicken on a plate with a few grapes cut up)service: server was very pushy. basically told us dishes come alone with no sides and we didnt order enough food (we took two containers of left overs home) and we should order a side. i may give brunch a chance because it seems like diners are having a better experience then. i think talde has potential but isn't quite there yet.",4,4,4,Mary M.,"Weehawken, NJ",178,19,8

2.0,2/19/2013,"The two stars go to the bar staff, their mixing skills and knowledge of cocktails - plus the fact that they were personable.  Bar alone is a 5/5.The restaurant itself leaves a LOT to be desired.A friend and I went Friday night around 830pm and we were told a 2 hour wait.  We figured why not sit at the bar to start and see what happens.  An hour fifteen in, we are told the wait isn't as long as expected and we'll be seated in 15-20 more minutes.  20 minutes later, we were told 15-20 more minutes, which at that point I told the manager that was what the meek hostess said 15-20 minutes ago.  She said that if we were seated in 20 minutes, it'd still be under our 2 hour quote.  Um... thanks?  We were seated in exactly 2 hours.We'd ordered some apps at the bar:The Pretzel Pork and Chive Dumplings are the bar were unremarkable.  The samosas were fried through and through and tasteless.The Hawaiian buns (we got the fish) were good.  They had great flavor and were unique.  Since we had some apps, we weren't terribly hungry when we sat, so decided to split the soba noodles and the seasonal vegetables (which was brussel sprouts).  The waitress quickly remarked that wouldn't be enough food and only after we assured her time and again that we ate at the bar, weren't terribly hungry and would order more if we wanted did she finally leave us alone.We wouldn't have ordered more food if we were starving.  The soba noodles were covered in the saltiest brown sauce I've ever tasted.  It was so salty, we didn't even finish the very small dish.  The brussel sprouts were nicely roasted, then covered in some cream/vinegar sauce also making them near inedible, as all we could taste was vinegar.  Again, we didn't finish these.For a restaurant that's received good reviews, has a seemingly wonderful menu and great decor, it was a huge letdown.  The service and food were so downright poor that I wish we cut our losses and left after our bar experience.There's plenty of other, cheapier, tastier asian places in Park Slope.  Go to those instead.",1,0,1,R O.,"Boston, MA",1,12,0

5.0,2/19/2013,"I'd come back here in a heartbeat; I really enjoyed my meal here and thought that Talde certainly lived up to all the hype. My friends and I came by on a Sunday night at 8 PM - it was packed, and we were told the wait would be about an hour and a half. We came down to Park Slope from Williamsburg just to go to Talde, so we headed to a nearby bar and had a drink while we waited. When we returned, we were seated immediately, ordered some beers off of their excellent beer list, and began our feast. We had the fish sliders on Hawaiian bread first; the fish was crispy, the bread was warm, and everything just melted in your mouth. Next up, the ramen with pork wontons - the noodles were perfectly cooked, the extra pork pieces were thick and meaty, and the broth wasn't too salty, which is my only gripe with most ramen. We ordered some vegetables, too; the kale salad with cranberries, chestnuts, and miso, which was incredibly good and interesting, and caramelized Brussels sprouts in a sambal curry sauce (also fantastic). The rest of the meal consisted of fried oyster and bacon pad Thai (smokey bacon, crispy oysters...so delicious) and incredibly crispy and flavorful Korean fried chicken with a Sriracha-ish mayo sauce and grapes. I also couldn't help but order the basil plum margarita, which was strong and not to sweet. I could have ordered more, honestly, even though my stomach was completely full - everything was so good that I wanted to try it all!

2.0,2/18/2013,"I wanted, very badly, to like Talde. At first, our plan was to go for Brunch seeing that the menu looked fun, but we couldn't make it so we wound up there for dinner instead. The starters we had (Perilla Leaf, and Pretzel Pork and Chive Dumplings) were good. They were tasty and different, even for a dumpling snob. The hot mustard played off really well with the salty pretzel of the dumpling, and the chives were not overwhelming. The Perilla leaves had a nice balance between sweet, salty, and spicy. All in all, the starters were fun.However, for some odd reason, the wait between our starters and entree was incredibly long, so long that the 3 tables around us, who by the way was sat first, was either on their dessert or paying their check. And by the time the entree came out (Char Siu Pork Shank with a side of Sticky Rice, and Bacon Pad Thai) we weren't even really all that hungry anymore. Either way, my boyfriend and I did not make a big deal out of it and as very nice patrons, we dove into our food. The pork shank was done nicely with a thick glaze over very tender yet juicy meat. The pairing of the asian pear and hot mustard with the pork was smart and inventive. The sticky rice had a nice smoky flavor from the chinese sausage, but the rice itself was a bit bland and I would have preferred it to be a bit drier. Now for the Pad Thai.... here's were Talde got 2-stars. It was INCREDIBLY salty. I'm not one to send food back often, but the salt content in that dish had me gulping down two full glasses of water after a single bite. I sent it back and the waitress apologized like crazy. With the apology, she did offer to have the chefs redo the dish or to get us something else, but honesty... by that time, I had already lost my appetite. Even more so, I didn't think it was worth trying anything else since my mouth was still stinging from the salt lick. The manager came over when our check came and insisted on taking off our entrees. We explained how we had understood, that sometimes things like this just happens in a restaurant, and left with a generous tip for our waitress. After all, it wasn't her fault. Nonetheless, I think I will go back for brunch. Like I said, the starters and the pork was good and the place deserves a second shot... but for now, it'll stay as a 2 until I return.",2,1,1,Kristy T.,"Queens, NY",36,133,91

2.0,2/8/2013,"I've been wanting to check out Talde for sometime, but unfortunately with mix feelings, I can't help but feel their deliverance was nothing but mediocre and hype!I came here on a Friday night and the restaurant was definitely buzzing with lively patrons. I was eager to be seated and I couldn't wait to try some of their popular  known dishes such as their assorted sliders and pretzel pork dumplings.With an Asian medley menu, a bunch of us decided to take our waitress' recommendation and made it family style as we ordered a slew of dishes.  For starters we ordered their Perilla Leaf which I have to say was interesting and good. Their assorted Hawaiian Buns (Sliders) were also well made as each bite melted in my mouth with an extra help of their well balanced creamy garlic mayo and pickled shallots that came along with the buns.At this point, I was a very satisfied with their dishes until everything else that followed after. Sadly, the rest of their dishes were a disappointment as it tasted like it was made with pre-packaged Lee Kum Kee seasonings (lkk.elsstore.com/view/ca…). Their Whole Roasted Branzino and Kung Pao Chicken Wings were beyond salty and tasted mediocre when compared to other Asian restaurants--nothing unique. As for their Crispy Oyster & Bacon Pad Thai and their Pretzel Pork Dumplings, it sounded better on the menu then it actually tasted.All in all, I'm glad I got to try a restaurant that I've been wanting to go to, but would I recommend Talde or even go back...the answer is simple--NO!",3,2,2,Nga C.,"Brooklyn, NY",524,480,2034

It definitely needed some spice. Pretzel dumpings were solidly good. Mushroom slider on hawaiian bread was actually my favorite. Overall, everything needed more spice. I know it's Asian fusion but still I like to sweat when I eat. Halo halo was a good ending, not too sweet or fatty. Overall really solid and tasty but somewhat expensive... $60 per person including tip and a drink. But service was PERFECT.

I wasn't super pleased with the dumplings (especially after all the Yelp hype) because I couldn't really taste the pretzel. Still, they were tasty. The Chow Fun was outstanding - the pork melted in your mouth, and the noodles in the dish were somehow crispy on the outside and soft and flavorful once you bit into them. Beautiful presentation to the dish as well. The Fried Chicken was also tasty; the portion was pretty big and the grapes were a nice contrast to the spicy yogurt. I was all over that banana sticky rice, though - it was delicious!

Well for those of you who've been to Bon Chon, Kyo Chon, and other ""Chons"", this is definitely not the same thing. It's just regular fired chicken with some vaguely Asian sauce (which isn't any good). The chicken itself was fried well though. Very juicy with a crispy but not oily skin.The MaPo tofu was just a tasteless stew of tofu and minced meat. Didn't have any spice or hint of Szechuan peppers. It was watery instead of thick like a pasta sauce. The tofu was fresh and soft.The Pad Thai was the best dish. Oysters were nice and juicy inside a crispy crust. Tasted fresh and nicely briny. The bacon was a good addition too. Overall, it was a little too much fusion and not enough authenticity. Good fusion should take the original concept and put an interesting spin on it - adding new flavors or cooking the dish in a novel way.

After a while there eventually was a longer wait, so come early because no reservations are taken! We ordered 6 dishes for 2 people (a lot I know!) The stand out dishes were definitely the breakfast ramen and apple pancakes. The breakfast ramen was a dish that Dale created on top chef, which is awesome and might confuse your tastebuds because it's ramen but taste like bacon, egg and cheese! The apple pancakes had cooked thinly sliced apples in between the pancakes and the ham added a nice saltiness to the dish. The korean chicken wings and waffles was good but the chicken wings does not taste like the typical wings you get at bonchon, they have this tangy creamy sauce on them. It was good but after a while it got a little salty and sour, I guess eat it while its still really hot! The pretzel and pork dumplings and lobster bao were good but not super memorable. Skip the shiitake mushroom and scallion chang fun, it was bland and drenched in soy sauce.Atmosphere was good, space is a little bit tight especially for the smaller tables but there are larger booths to accommodate bigger parties.

I leave work at nearly 8PM to run some errands before I meet a few girlfriends (we are all 30 yrs old) for dinner at Talde at 9:45PM. By the time I reach Talde I am exhausted and famished. My friends arrive 1 minute after me. The manager/hostess informs us that there will be a 30 min wait. (OK - no problem!) We order 1 round of drinks at the bar where the bartender asks for our IDs. (Not out of the ordinary, as we do look fairly young). However, he questions one of my friends who has blonde hair in her photo, but since that photo, has died her hair brown.  Bartender: ""Your hair is blonde in this."" Friend: ""Yes it is, and now its brown. I dyed it."" Bartender proceeds to stare at her with an equal parts quizzical and unimpressed expression. He gives each of our ID's a major looking over before finally giving us our drinks.After a 45 min wait, during which time we sat at the bar chit chatting, we are informed that our table is ready. (Great!) The bartender comes over with our bill (we each had 1 drink) and while giving us the nastiest stare down says, ""You are welcome to be seated for dinner, but I will not be serving you any more drinks tonight.""  We all laugh it off thinking he must be joking. Bartender: ""I am serious. You all look intoxicated. Seems like you had too many drinks before you came here.""  In shock, we all ask what we did we to make him think we had too many drinks. I mean, we just sat there talking for 45 min with 1 drink each while we waiting for our table to be ready. And while I had no drinks before arriving, my friends did have 1 drink each before heading to the restaurant. I am sorry - but in what world is having 2 drinks in the span of 2 hours considered intoxication?I am shocked that this bartender has the nerve to treat patrons in this manner. Not only was he wrong, but he was outright RUDE.  Had we been loud, rambunctious or rude in return OR had he given us a better explanation - this may have been another story.  Being devil's advocate for one moment....Yes, bartenders have the right to stop serving customers if they deem it is necessary. However,  I'm not sure which top bar tending school he attended to justify his nasty attitude which is completely unacceptable no matter the circumstance. Or maybe such power trip displays make him feel better about his failure in life.

We are still talking about the kale salad (Mom is on the hunt for whatever is in the hazelnut dressing-I wish her luck I hope she can replicate it at home) The samosas were tasty and pretty light (obviously a riff on traditional ones) didn't feel like you ate a rock. The branzino was yummy and they had tortillas so it was a make your own taco kind of thing. The market vegetables were brussel sprouts with some sort of pesto preparation-it was INSANE like so tasty-if you think you hate brussel sprouts you need to have these SO GOOD.My only bone to pick was that we were not offered dessert-it was getting crowded and we were ready to leave but really Then I have heard differing reports but reportedly there is only one dessert item which is some shaved ice scenario. Now Dale, I know you are very into  your concept here but really just one dessert item? Shaved ice? work with me on this.Will definitely be returning SOON!",0,0,0,Eve S.,"Brooklyn, NY",114,1119,16
5.0,1/8/2013,"First of all Yelp is wrong and this restaurant is open past 3 pm on weekends. You just can't make reservations for dinner on weekends. Secondly, Talde is amazing. When I read the dreaded ""Asian fusion"" tag I was (rightly) concerned. But at Talde the fusion part is subtle and not done in a forced gimmicky way (Uni on pizza! Cloyingly sweet soy based sauces on everything!) but solely for the sake of flavours. It's just good tasting food, no extraneous sesame seed flurries or gratuitous ginger everywhere. I started off with the hot toddy, which was just a regular hot toddy. But a regular hot toddy on an extra windy night in Brooklyn certainly does not hurt. Then we got the pretzel pork and chive dumplings in the (quite crowded) bar area. They come with very strong mustard and just a couple dabs were enough for me. These dumplings are really nice, I was expecting more pretzeliness from the crust but taste wise I liked how the dumpling skins were nicely salted like pretzels. Still great stuff. Let it cool a little before biting in lest the spurt of hot grease gets you too :/Next we got the Hawaiian sliders. You get a market vegetable, market fish and Filipino sausage one. My sister made us trek to Brooklyn solely for the mushroom one so we were happy the market vegetable of the day was shiitake mushrooms and subbed the fish one for an extra mushroom. A mushroom slider sounds ok at best but boy was I wrong. I have no idea how they can make it so amazing but the soft sweetness of the bun + aioli + super creamy cheese + perfectly cooked shiitake = MAGIC. What is the cheese they use?! The Filipino sausage was good too but if I go again I might sub all three for mushroom...For our entrees we got the braised pork shank with chow fun and the lobster tom kha. The pork shanks and chow fun. Wow. The pork is braised and shredded while the chow fun is pan fried on one side with tangy/spicy mustard greens and radishes. When you combine the meat with the sweet/slightly vinegary sauce and the chewy springiness of chow fun. It was nothing short of perfect. Will order this dish again. Literally could not stop eating. I am going to go brave the asian market to find chow fun and try to recreate this at home :'(The lobster tom kha is HUGE. It's a tad spicy but the sweetness from the coconut, lobster, and corn with the spicy/savory flavors in the broth are pretty good. Enjoyed this but compared to the chow fun the mix of flavors wasn't as inventive or addicting. The corn and potatoes were a clever addition to Tom kha but the overall flavor was just tom kha with lobster. Which is not the worst thing in the world but eh. Would be good to split between 2 people if you're really hungry as an appetizer.For dessert they had a chocolate budino with star anise pepitas and whipped cream and a play on halo halo with kaffir lime cream, condensed milk, graprefruit, jellies and good ol' Cap'n Crunch :) Since we had been stuffing ourselves with chocolate-y dairy products lately we went with the halo halo. The ice melted pretty quickly and it was akin to eating a coconut-y ice cold bowl of Cap'n Crunch with the occasional texture from the jellies or bitterness from the graprefruit. I did not appreciate this and began to eat around the graprefruit. I love cereal so this was good and the flavors were very interesting but also familiar. I do wish they had better shaved ice, the one that stays in mounds and is really finely shaved so the dessert was less cereal-y. This might be a product of going to snow ice places in super Asian Irvine. I guess for Brooklyn their shaved ice effort was valiant? :/All in all, a great experience. The decor and serveware are a clever nod to traditional Chinese restaurants.",1,0,1,Joyce S.,"San Diego, CA",60,131,0
3.0,1/7/2013,Everyone just needs to calm down...the pretzel dumplings we ate were just okay. We were provoked to try the restaurant through a shout out by one of my favorite NPR programs The Dinner Party and they were raving about the pretzel dumplings.  Don't believe the hype!!! What I did love was the artery clogging goodness of the shrimp toast.  The perilla leaves were shockingly small bites.  The wine list is interesting and affordable.  The chocolate pudding with spiced pumpkin seeds was a perfect dessert. We arrived at 5pm on a Sunday for dinner and there was already a list going. The early seating seemed very family friendly.,0,0,0,Marianne K.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,18,0

I shutter to think what a Friday or Saturday would be like. Lol!  While waiting at bar, we sampled the pretzel pork dumplings, which ended up being the highlight of the evening because it was delivered hot and quickly... and was rather good.  This almost made up for the uppity bartender, who acted like he owned the place, but not in a good way. In sum, my party of three tried many different menu items with our bill over $200. Our verdict was good for the following appetizers: dumplings, shrimp toast,  and wings. For dinner the pork shoulder entree was the best of all, as well as the butternut squash side dish. The biggest disappointment was the highly recommended fried chicken from almost every food critic. There was ONE good slice in the middle, that was moist and very good. All other pieces were rather dry, and actually bad. Could be due to the 45 min wait after ordering. Probably under the heat lamp for a long time. Other patrons were grumbling as they left as well. Not worth leaving Manhattan to try. If it takes more than 10 min to get there, go elsewhere.I wanted to like this place, as I do admire Chef Dale Talde, the restaurants co-owner. My guess is, as for every restaurant, the owners need to be present.

We ordered drinks and started our dinning experience. Once we ordered our appetizers, I notice that, ours plates were made of plastic. I saw this as a bad sign, for a restaurant, of this caliber. Once our food arrived we had, Kimchi Wings and other main dishes. Once we finished eating, there seemed to be a bit of a rush by the wait staff. That rush was to get rid of us, to prepare the table for another group. We were told that, we could not order dessert or coffee. Well, we protested and it fell on dead ears.  The manager was condescending and arrogant. A rather well fed, individual, who looked like he need a shave. We paid our rather large bill ($$$$$$) and left. So for good food, Talde was ""ok,"" for service excellent, for managerial skills, lets say we got better service from the McDonald's on Hamilton street.

Luckily, my one friend suggested we eat there and another friend is actually friends with him from her Morimoto days. Score. So I got to meet him in person (and he definitely hooked us up with a few extra dishes).The lychee martini was delicious - had two.Now onto the food:Perilla leaf - Very small taste but it is still good. Shrimp toast - There's a fried egg on this and we all know anything with a fried egg makes the food a million times betterMussels - Amazingly tasty. Perfectly buttery and the bread compliments the dish very well.Whole Branzino (Sea bass) - Really good. A whole fish was not enough as I could have eaten a whole fish by myself. Get two.Korean fried chicken - Really good. That yogurt sauce makes a great kicker for flavor. And it's already flavorful without the sauce. Score.Ribeye - Skip it. A little too raw for me.Smoked char siu shoulder - Skip it. A little too tough for me.Egg foo young fried rice - Skip it. It's just fried rice.Butternut squash hot pot - Skip it.Pretzel pork and chive dumplings - Skip it. Too doughy/fried.So if you go and order the right dishes, this place is great. Sharing is a must.

The citrus taste overtakes the liquor pretty much so I enjoyed me a nice pitcher til we were seated. The waiter was friendly and a good help letting us know how to order and what entrees and plates go good together which was a help. The pork pretzel dumplings are so good! Nice fried and crispy! I enjoyed them very much. The lobster soup with coconut milk was really good too and a bit spicy but couldn't enjoy it enough. The pork shoulder was crispy and very flavorful with the sticky rice on the side. But I must say by far the best part was the CHOCOLATE PUDDING!!! Oh my!! It was like sex in your mouth exploded! As a woman and chocolate feen this was just pure Ecstasy! I will never forget that and I will just come back every month for that! You must try!

Not because the perilla leaf wasn't the most intriguing kickstart to a meal I've ever had or because the long beans weren't an inspiration for vegetables everywhere. They were.

Why not ditch this ""Talde"" business and rename your restaurant ""Whole Roasted Branzino?"" Give the people what they want... well, even if they don't want it, give it to them.

5.0,11/7/2012,"i had high expectations and, i have to say, they were exceeded.  first, it was truly excellent service, despite the crowd, from the host to the waiter to the busboy. i am definitely someone who gets anxious that my name has been lost in the shuffle when i'm waiting for a table, but i didn't have to worry here -- while we were sitting at the bar, the host checked in with us to make sure he knew which name on his list belonged to us, so i didn't have to worry, and when it was our turn there was no shouting of names, the other host simply came over to tell us that our table was ready, AND that our tab from the bar would just be transferred to our table check.  nice and easy.then, our waiter, who was very nice, did a great job walking us through the menu and some advice on how to order since it was our first time there, and he checked in with us throughout the meal at perfectly spaced intervals to see how everything was progressing.  the busboys were prompt in removing plates when we were done with a course, and our waiter must have had a little red light somewhere telling him when we were close to being ready for another drink because he would appear at our table at *just* the right time to inquire if we wanted another round.really, it's been a long time since i've had such stellar service, and i was quite impressed.as for the food, it was all delicious.  we had the pretzel dumplings, of course, which were flavorful and salty and satisfying; the kale salad, which was also flavorful and refreshing; the chow fun with pork -- amazing; the whole bronzino, which is served with tortillas for making your own fish tacos -- really, really good; and a side of the sticky rice with bacon, which was so yummy and makes me wish sticky rice was always made with bacon.i also really enjoyed my cocktails. first i had the plum basil margarita, which i loved (it's really tart, and i love tart cocktails), and then i had the navy grog, followed by another margarita.lastly, prices: surprisingly reasonable!  my cocktails were $10 each, my friend's Lagunitas beer was only $6; the bronzino was $32, i think, but the other dishes are significantly less, so when you're only ordering one entree and sharing everything, the end cost per person isn't bad.  for three cocktails, two beers, and all of that food i listed above, plus tax, the total came to $125 (not including tip.)  not a cheap meal, but given everything you get, definitely worth it in my opinion.",1,0,1,Lily T.,"Brooklyn, NY",131,275,0
5.0,11/6/2012,"omg this place was simply superb. I came here for bday brunch and drinks and I cant wait to go back for dinner! Talde really captures traditional asian flavors and puts just enough spin on them to make them unique. The pretzel pork and chive dumplings were so tasty, the spicy mustard was on point and classic Chinese. My favorite thing we had was the Korean Chicken wings and waffles. The sauce on the wings was spicy and flavorful and some of the best wings I have eaten. The waffle was also delicious and the coconut brown butter syrup was a very nice touch. I'm definitely a fan of the Lobster Bao buns, a delicous twist on a lobster roll. We also had the shrimp toast and tater tots which were also very good.

We ordered a bunch of different things to share. The pretzel dumplings were great. The bread buns were sliders, which I really didn't imagine that's what they would be, but tasty nonetheless, specifically the mushroom one. We also shared the wonton soup, which was tasty, but more like ramen and quite frankly, I'd rather go to Chuko for ramen.For entrees we ordered the korean fried chicken, the branzino and the pork shoulder. All really good. I was a little disappointed in the sauce for the fried chicken as it was very heavily reliant on Frank's Red Hot (delicious...but not special).The one thing I will say is avoid the desserts at all cost.

The server was nice, and even though she must have been really tired from a long, busy night, she tried to remain perky.  The food is just okay, it's good, but a small plate of pad thai with a mountain of cilantro and mint on it was $16 (and it was kinda greasy).

5.0,10/9/2012,"When you decide to eat where the Top Chef  judges eat, head over to Park Slope in Brooklyn and try Dale Talde's Asian American restaurant, Talde. The menu covers all the bases, from Thai to Vietnamese, to Japanese and of course, takes inspiration from Talde's own Filipino heritage. And all of this is done with a nod to classic American cuisine. Wedge salads and Texas style brisket grace the Asian influences with a taste from the States. Talde opened the large, high ceilinged, corner space with the two owners of Thistle Hill Tavern (also in Park Slope) David Massoni and John Bush. And because Talde has made a name for himself on several seasons of Top Chef, on most nights you can expect to wait before getting a table. The restaurant doesn't accept reservations unless you are dining with Padma Lakshmi herself. Her favorite dish? The Korean fried chicken. At your table you will find 19th century Japanese mahogany frames carved with exotic dragons and elephants and plenty to distract you from the menu. So take your time before you get seated to study your options or just have a reasonably priced drink at the bar. Hooray for Brooklyn! Pretzel Pork and Chive Dumplings with Spicy Mustard:These dumplings were a perfect example of fusion at its best. I imagine a NYC hotdog cart met a Hong Kong night market stand and made these delicious pups. The evenly crispy pretzel was never too greasy and kept the juicy ground pork perfectly warm and pink. The chives and spicy mustard made it a home run, and to cheer even further for the mustard is this quote from the New Yorker, ""they're served with the kind of spicy mustard that comes with Chinese takeout...too often relegated to the kitchen junk drawer"".  Char Siu Smoked Pork Spare Ribs with Watermelon and Thai Basil:These slowly smoked ribs combine typical barbecue elements with gorgeous Asian flavors. The ribs hold a rich smokey flavor after being smoked for about 8 hours, and are tender and sweet with a hint of tang. The watermelon reminds you of a day in the park, but with thai basil the park might actually be a beach in Thailand. Market Vegestables (Chinese Long Beans):Smothered in ginger, lemongrass, and other piquants did not take away from the freshness and flavor of the bright and crispy green beans. These were a delicious and healthy choice with the basil and other ingredients so fresh that they seemed peppered.  Korean Fried Chicken with Spicy Kimchee Yogurt, Cherries & Mint:The spicy kimchee yogurt sauce may be the reason your date never asked you out to dinner again. You either licked the bowl or drooled a little bit just thinking about it. That kimchee yogurt was so exquisitely spicy and so well-paired with cherry slices and moist chicken that it completely outdid any of your wildest date night expectations anyways. Dark red cherry slices and fresh mint really were the cherry on top.  Fish (Branzino):The whole branzino, roasted with tomato, garlic and turmeric in a banana leaf and topped with fresh basil and cilantro perfectly explains why Kanye's date ordered fish filet in the song ""That shit Kray"". This is Dale's stand-out dish, and possibly negates any of the hardships you faced getting here and waiting for a table. Beautifully presented as a whole fish, but all the bones are removed so that it arrives succulently seasoned before you wrap it in warm moo-shu pancakes and indulge.  Green Mango Salad with Crushed Peanuts and Thai Chilies: Although the dish was meant to be spicy, it turned out to be light and refreshing. The green mango was more of a ripe and soft yellow mango and the peanuts and chilies were sparse. In fact, this salad could double as a dessert if desired since Talde only offers a single wacky dessert option. Surprising for a menu of such versatility.But then again, that single dessert is a heaping mess of halo-halo, which is served in a large metal bowl and looks like severely unappetizing stoner food. Traditionally, it is made with shaved ice, condensed milk, and random assortment of Filipino fruits and sweets. This one features banana, shredded coconut, tapioca pearls, and even the colorful cereal Cap'n Crunch. Eaten family-style, you will be surprised to find yourself digging in for more as each bite becomes more addicting than the last. The soft gelatin of the tapioca and the cold crunch of the shaved ice are unpredictable textures to contend with in each bite, but the condensed milk and soft banana are sweet and delectable and you find yourself saying stoner things, like, ""pass the bowl"".  Entrées are between $15-$26 and each dish explodes with flavor and personality. It's a real pleasure to see so many culinary influences meshed into one menu and the fearlessness of the atypical flavor combinations in most dishes. Bottom line? When you are looking for bold flavors, call it a day at Talde.",6,1,2,Justine F.,"Los Angeles, CA",61,36,1

Nothing bad, but nothing spectacular.  The lobster bao were very nice and the portions were a decent size.  The buns were good.  I guess I was just expecting it to be a mind blowing experience....some sort of taste sensation with new and exciting flavors.  But it really just tasted like a lobster roll on a steamed bun.I did like the tater tots a lot.  Crispy outside, soft and steamy inside.  The spicy ketchup they pair it with was spectacular.  The service was great, the manager came around a couple of times to check on us and I loved the vibe.  This is a nice spot for brunch, but there was nothing that really stood out from what we ate that would make it a destination.   I'll give it a shot for dinner some time and see if the menu there wows me a little bit more.",3,3,0,Bill T.,"New York, NY",1361,2290,9300
5.0,10/1/2012,"After my 4th or 5th visit Talde has become my favorite park slope restaurant, absolutely love everything about this place. The biggest issue is the crowds, the best solution is to go early, and go on weekdays. I love the brunch also.The service here is always spot on. Super friendly, approchable, enthusiastic, etc. Can't say enough good things about the staff.Almost all the dishes are fantastic, incredibly flavorful, original and unpretentious. I have to have the perilla leaf every time, and the mango salad is one of my favorite dishes period. I universally love every single dish in the noodle category. The pad thai is better than any nearby thai place, the chow fun is ridiculous, and the wonton soup's noodles are springy and the broth+egg is killer. Shrimp toast is great for brunch or dinner, and the whole market fish is really flavorful and on the lighter side of the dishes (and I was impressed with how it was deboned) I also love that the halo halo is the only dessert, it makes me laugh every time I eat it.Talde knows its strengths, and plays to them without trying to be something it isn't.There are a few dishes that I usually skip these days, but I know other people disagree with me. The hawaiian buns bore me. The bread is too hamburger bun like. I'd rather have some steamed buns or something more interesting. Also, the dumplings could stand to be more ""pretzel-y"" and I'd like a little some soy or vinegar or some other more moist dip as another option to the mustard. Also the fruit salad had a painfully dainty shmear of the amazing roast banana sauce. I'm being nitpicky though, even their worst dishes put any nearby thai or chinese joints to shame. (Not that talde is thai or chinese)Also great drinks, great beer, great cocktails, nice little interesting wine list too, not that I think red goes too well with most of the food there. Maybe wish there was a little more sake or maybe some sochu to pick from.All in all though, hard to ask for more. Seriously delicious original food in a laid back friendly neighborhood spot.

The KFC was not juicy, and the ribs were overwhelmingly salty and near inedible. Talde was in the restaurant which should translate into, I think, better quality food.

4.0,9/18/2012,"Man was I all set to have a bad time at Talde.Lines around the block, no reservations. Fusion Asian, a genre which you expect more in places without enough critical mass for decent specific Asian cuisines. Named for its celebrity top-chef owner David Talde, who's episodes I felt compelled to watch and who is an unqualified asshat.  In the space occupied by my effin' dry cleaner. (I guess you can't blame Talde for jacking the rent up so high that those nice Koreans had to shrink their space down to a closet and ship the clothes off to god-knows-where to be cleaned.) But still, how can they even hope to make it with that kind if nut to make every month in Park Slope.After several abortive efforts we finally managed to get in.  I was actually kind of excited at the prospect of being able to really hate it.I'm sorry.  I apologize.  It was really good.So first of all Talde's take on Asian Fusion seems to be Filipino meets Korean.  Or something. Obligatory short ribs, salty and tender, salty tasty things wrapped in other things, crunchy salty stuff.Actually maybe Talde's take on Asian Fusion is whatever is salty.  I'm not saying TOO salty -- deliciously salty.  People have become sort of afraid of salt in the last few decades.  Oooo salt.  high blood pressure, heart disease etc.  a lot of weight for poor little sodium chloride to carry.  It's like we've forgotten all the amazing good stuff that salt has done for us over the years, flavoring our bland bland food, preserving our overkill for leaner times.  I mean, have you ever tasted that no-salt Tuscan bread?  ...shudder....OK, enough.  Talde was delicious, quick, interesting.  the servers were pleasant and efficient,  The half-assed but earnest attempt at ""asian"" decor was at least dark enough to not show wear, which is going to turn out to be a real benefit because this place has been slammed since day 1 without much letup.Maybe this is a turning point for me.  Maybe I'm going to be less judgmental, more open to new experiences.Thanks Talde.",1,0,0,Skippy M.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,16,0
1.0,9/12/2012,"I hate the feeling of disappointment and Talde was no exception, unfortunately.  I am all about trying new things and the South East Asian region to me has some of the best food in the world.  Having been recommended this place but numerous friends (several of which I now question their food judgement), I came here last night on 9/11 with my father and wife.  My immediate observation about this place is the over-blaring music that is constant and frankly displaced for this place - I get it, play loud hard rhythmic beats and people will eat faster and turnover will enhance.  Unfortunately, this is one reason beyond the food and prices, that I will not return nor suggest to anybody to go to this establishment.  In fact, I will make an effort to tell all my friends, family, and public to avoid this place.The food ordered:  Pretzel Dumplings:  these were delivered within minutes of ordering.  They were lukewarm, severely overcooked and the dough was that of a cardboard texture - certainly not what I envisioned and totally lacking any praise of what people are giving this.  We were told food is made to order, frankly most of the dishes were devoid of this statement.  So 4 mediocre dumplings for $8?  Go to any Chinese takeout place for superior dumplings for half the cost and double the portion size.Shrimp Toast:  embarrassingly the only enjoyable dish of the night.  But very confusing with the gravy and the sunny side egg.  The toast is heavy and rich in itself - to add egg yolk ADD sausage gravy is what we call a culinary mistake.Buns (we ordered all pork):  $12 for 3 quarter-sized sausage patties.  They were good but short of any interesting qualities and a sure rip-off.Pork Shoulder:  frankly this dish was a joke.  This was an entrée but most definitely an appetizer-sized portion - and for $23 that is just unacceptable.  The meat was tough and chewy, brought out lukewarm.  And the outer fat!  Come on, should be the best part was totally inedible and chewy like a duck breast gone wrong.  One of the worst dishes of the evening, in fact we left several slices uneaten.  The waitress did not care to pay attention nor ask if we did not like it or if there was something wrong...frankly, she did not come by at all to check on the meal.Oyster/Bacon Pad Thai:  guys, this is pad thai, you can buy the Thai Kitchen containers at Trader Joes or Whole Foods and make an equivalent-tasting dish.  Wow, there are pieces of bacon and 3 fried oysters on there!  Who would have thunk!  Let's charge $16 on top of it too!In summary, here is my interpretation of this place:  a terribly loud establishment serving undersized portions at above-average prices.  The target market of customers are sincere people with a below-average understanding of Asian cooking.  No reasonable person would return to this place.If you want to ride the wagon and by ""different"" and try something new and get the same experience minus the high prices, try Mission Chinese in Lower East Side.  You will wait a stupid 3 hours, but they will call you when the table is ready (Talde doesn't) and you can drink beer for free at the entrance.This post will be going on every imaginable site, sorry Dale - big miss on this one.Erez",1,0,0,Erez H S.,"New York, NY",0,13,0
5.0,9/10/2012,"Great place. This has been on my list of places to eat since I knew I was coming to New York. I trekked all the way to Park Slope from UES to support a fellow Pinoy. (The F train 7th Avenue station was closed and had shuttle service from Jay Street which was a disaster. It ran as a local bus and took another 30 minutes from that station to 4th Avenue [?] where they dropped us off as the final destination. Check the MTA for alerts! On any given day, it probably wouldn't have taken so long (an hour at most... took us 90 minutes from 86th & Lexington to Talde!) Anyway, we had a 10 PM reservation. Since we were unaware of the F train situation, I called twice on the way saying we were running late, but nearby. The hostess was polite and said to just come as soon as possible. We get there, I apologize for being late and they sympathized with us, ""Oh yeah. The F train..."" and we had a quick laugh about public transit nonsense. As we were about to be seated, I noticed the flooring is very slippery! And for some reason, throughout the dinner, my friends and I kept hearing plates, glasses, and utensils dropping on the floor (was it because the slippery tiles?). So watch your step there! Because we were starving (we were a party of six), we ordered family style. (It was also recommended by our server.) Actually, it was a little difficult with six because some of the entrees could not be split evenly for our party size. Basically, in some cases, we all had literally one bite of something... Food:Pretzel pork & chive dumplings with spicy mustard: B+. Not terribly innovative in flavor since it tasted like most dumplings do, but it had some interesting features... the pretzel was a nice surprise... though I wish it was more prominent here.Market fish: A. I don't eat fish often, but I thought it was BEAUTIFULLY cooked. The bronzino was steamed/roasted in banana leaves and served with mixed herbs like mint and dill. Came with pancakes for wrapping.Korean Fried Chicken: A+. My FAVORITE of the night! The kimchee yogurt and most especially, the roasted cherries just left me breathless. Actually, I was moaning with every bite so...Fried oyster and bacon Pad Thai: A. Wonderful new take on a classic. Plus, come on... fried oysters and BACON? WIN. WIN. WIN.Lobster Tom Kha: A. Nice, bright flavor... just enough acidity and cream from the coconut milk. The lobster adds a little luxury.Pork shoulder: A-. Good stuff! You can never lose with pork! (What a Filipino thing for me to say!)Halo-Halo: B-. Not gonna lie... quite disappointed. I understand this isn't your conventional halo-halo of childhood, but it just didn't do it for me. The kaong and coconut was expected, but it didn't mesh well with the berries as much as I had hoped. Moreover, the condensed milk and melted shaved ice made for a runny sauce. It also didn't help that the bowls they gave us were warm further melting the halo-halo (which is meant to be a refreshing summer dessert!). The decor was a cheeky take on ""typical"" Asian household furniture. I saw a chest of drawers that reminded me of something your grandparents (""lola/lolo"") would have... and some of the accessories around the restaurant were funny little throwbacks for many of us who are Asian American. The irony and subtle homage to our childhood/past I appreciate... kinda like Mission Chinese's decor in LES. Overall, you must come here! I especially made an effort to come and support a Filipino American from Chicago... and because the wannabe hipster in me loves Brooklyn. Moreover, this is solid high-end fare that will take your palette to unconventional territory... and even for me (and I'm Asian!). Lastly, I am particularly happy the flavors of the Philippines/SE Asia is increasingly emerging in the culinary world and is quickly entering the ""mainstream."" It's about time that Filipino food (and Filipino chefs/cooks) are respected in the high-brow world of fine dining.",1,0,1,James Z.,"San Francisco, CA",504,334,4494
4.0,9/10/2012,"Actual rating: 2.5 stars.Quick Brunch Rundown #1- Korean Chicken WIngs and Waffles: Both the wings and the waffles arrived lukewarm and soggy.  The flavors were there, but without the texture, it was a major disappointment.- Bacon Pad Thai: Delicious, but like the waffles, arrived lukewarm.- Tator tots: The only dish that arrived hot, but come on, anyone can throw some tater tots into the deep fryer and have them come out well.- They will encourage you to order more food than you'll need.  The portions aren't as small as impliedOverall: Was really eager to go to dinner here, but after the brunch experience, we're not in as big of a rush to return.EDIT: Upgraded review to 4 stars to reflect more recent experiences here.  A lot of the brunch kinks have been worked out and Talde has become our go to spot for brunch in the Slope.",1,0,1,Matt M.,"Brooklyn, NY",49,94,1

4.0,8/30/2012,"Hmm. This is a tough one - I'd really like to give Talde 3.5 stars, because that's how I feel the food really was, but given that half stars aren't an option, I'll round up for the excellent service. We went for brunch, got there early so no wait. We found ourselves choosing our dishes based on eliminating what we didn't want rather than gravitating towards any dish in particular - nothing really called out to us as a must have.That said, the shrimp toast was delicious, but they were VERY stingy on the gravy. The dumplings were good, but the mustard sauce was overpowering - we felt it would have been better with a nuoc cham or chinese vinegar dipping sauce. The chicken and waffles completely killed our palates for much else - wish they'd served with some sort of cooling yogurt just to cleanse the palate a bit. They were super tasty, but again, hard to really taste anything else after a bite or two (and SOOOO stingy again with the syrup!). The tater tots were heavenly.Service was lightning quick and friendly.  We were very pleased with the overall dining experience. Wish a few more of the dinner options would make it on the brunch menu.  Would I recommend? With a few tweaks, if you are in the neighborhood, sure. At the moment, I probably wouldn't call it a destination dine.",1,1,1,Julie B.,"Brooklyn, NY",98,572,13
4.0,8/29/2012,"I'm a big Top Chef fan. My fiance and I have been excited to visit Talde since it opened last winter, but didn't get there until last week. We took the subway from Carroll Gardens and arrived around 6:30 on a Friday. No wait! A pleasant surprise. We began with cocktails--the watermelon margarita was just what I needed--fresh and refreshing, and not too sweet. The wedge of watermelon on the glass was coated in salt, which was delicious. My fiance got a mojito--he didn't love it, so I won that round. I don't like sharing, especially when it comes to food. But places like Talde, Fatty 'Cue, and Pok Pok are changing my attitude. I find myself really enjoying the small plate concept. It makes me more adventurous in my ordering choices, knowing I will be able to sample it, and if I don't love it, move on to the next dish. This method worked well at Talde. We began with the Perilla Leaf, which was touted as the essence of Talde in one bite. It was definitely an interesting combo of tastes--smokey, sweet, and a tiny bit spicy--but too small to be substantial. Luckily, we got the pretzel dumplings, which were really delicious. I could have eaten about 6 more and been  happy. We also got the oyster/bacon pad thai--good, but not great. The bbq short ribs were out of this world good though--definitely a highlight. It was a great meal, and I'll definitely return to try the Korean fried chicken.",4,3,3,Jill D.,"Jamaica Plain, MA",16,83,0
5.0,8/26/2012,"My girlfriend and I have been to Talde several, several times. The first, on a whim - we had just heard it opened and figured, ""why not?"" Lately, it's been: ""why haven't we been to Talde lately?!""We've attempted to hit everything on the menu and have always been overwhelmingly satisfied. A few of our favorites are the PRETZEL DUMPLINGS (omg jesus), the hawaiian buns, the korean fried chicken, and the CRISPY OYSTER AND BACON PAD THAI (get the full name right, she sez!). The perilla leaf as a tasty amuse bouche to start things out - flavor explosion that brings together all the elements of the Talde menu.Also, the drinks are in-credi-ble. We always order (several of the) tuk tuks, which are simply rum and cokes, but with delicious and interesting Mekong rum. We'd order a pitcher if we could, we can really put 'em down.Sure it may be a little pricey as some have said, but it's worth it for the food - plus, the portion size allows for ample leftovers the next day (or later in the night, just bein' honest).HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!

5.0,8/20/2012,"My husband and I made the trek out to Brooklyn to try Talde this past weekend and I loved it.  The beer selection was great (after reading the reviews we stayed away from the cocktails and stuck to beer) and the menu was full of very interesting-sounding dishes.  We tried the Saigon crepes (otherwise known as banh xeo if you are at a Vietnamese restaurant), the pretzel pork & chive dumplings, the oyster and bacon pas thai, the Korean fried chicken and the market vegetables in green sambal (long beans stir-fried in what tasted like green Thai chili paste).  My husband and I disagreed over what our favorite dishes of the night were, but I voted for the Saigon crepes, which had a fabulously crispy texture to the pancake (almost like a really good dosa and not eggy like most banh xeo) and a perfectly seasoned filling of ham and shrimp, topped with fresh mint.  It was surprisingly light and fresh and delicious.  He voted for the dumplings.  I have the admit that the dumplings were totally delicious - the spicy Chinese mustard worked perfectly with the very crispy, salty dumpling wrappers and the juicy porky filling.  I loved both dishes.  Actually, crispy seems the be a texture that Talde excels at because the breading on the Korean fried chicken is also amazingly crispy, with a tender and juicy interior.  The fried chicken was served on a hot sauce-based sauce (which I loved) with fresh cherries tossed in a little mint.  I was skeptical about the cherries when I first tried the dish, but they totally worked for me.  The only dish of the evening that didn't live up to the hype for us was the pad thai, which we found to be overly smoky and I never thought I would say this, but a little heavy on the bacon.  I really liked my first few bites, but it lacked the balance of flavors that really characterized the other dishes.  I think a little restraint there would have worked wonders.  Otherwise I totally loved the restaurant.",0,0,0,Vicki B.,"Jersey City, NJ",2,126,0

4.0,8/8/2012,"The food here is really very good, if you don't mind the wait. I live on the block and I can tell you that at almost any hour of any day, there is quite a wait for tables.  Actually, when my wife and I went for dinner at 10pm on Wednesday, we were sat immediately, but that was uncommon. However, do it. The bar is great with some fun cocktails and they take their drinks seriously without being serious.  Once you get sat, you must try the dumplings.  They do them in a pretzel dough that's incredible with the mustard.  Everyone gets the fried chicken.  Everyone talks about how good the fried chicken is.  Everyone is right.  Get the fried chicken if you've never been, but you might need to share.  Also love the buns of all kinds.  Try the Saigon crepes, pretty much like nothing you've tasted and delicious.  Also, another favorite, the crispy oyster/bacon pad thai.  Was personally not a fan of the lobster noodles, but that's because I don't like those thin crispy noodles.  It was delicious, but not really my thing.  The dessert they do, a halo-halo - meh.

4.0,8/7/2012,"The handful of times I've come to Talde, I've always had to wait for a table. At most restaurants, this is an inconvenient, albeit accepted, part of the New York dining process. Here, however, I've found this to be an opportunity to hit up the bar and try some of Talde's signature cocktails. Positive thinking! Booze! The fancy kind, not just for binge drinking! That's right. Because every drink I've had here here is fantastic, and I believe the whole lot of 'em are worthy of a spotlight all their own. So, let's dive right in, shall we?Obama's Punch (Kraken Rum, Brooklyn Republic Vodka, Curacao, vanilla, blood orange-lemon-lime juices) - The perfect summer splash of a drink, this POTUS-inspired libation is also the best deal on the menu - if you get the pitcher, that is. For $16, you're served a spiffy jug that is good for roughly three drinks vs. the single order at $10.Chinatown (Diplomatico Rum, Laird's AppleJack, limes, cherries, brown sugar, black pepper) - This is one classy-ass cocktail, testing the urge to prop up a pinky while drinking it. Dominating the flavor palate here are tasty, autumnal, harvest notes of apple and cherry.Brooklyn Sling (Broker's Gin, cherry liquor, pineapple juice, lemon-lime bitters) - If you can't decide on sweet or bitter, sometimes it's best to go with both. This Kings County-proud take on a Singapore Sling (this is still an Asian restaurant, after all) strikes a wonderful balance by mixing sweet fruit flavors with bitter herb accents.The Tuk Tuk (Ginger-Infused Mekhong Rum and coke) - A simple blend that doubles as the ultimate bro-drink hybrid. Taste-wise, it's like imbibing the offspring of a rum and coke and Jack and ginger. If you don't regularly order either of those anyway, don't dismiss this selection - it's really still worth it.Lychee Martini (Broker's Gin, lychee liquor, lychee sake, lemon-lime juices, lemon-lime bitters) - Sweet, chilled, and delicious, Talde's take is one of the better 'chee 'tinis I've ever had, thanks to its refreshing citrus blend and subtle sake sting.Thankfully, your table should be ready well before you have the chance to down five different drinks. But maybe you can, given you're still reeling from your fraternity days, or time spent on the field hockey team, I don't know - I don't know you like that. Regardless of your tolerance level, you should find most of the food here - a pan-Asian hodgepodge of shareable dishes - inventive, tasty, and a enjoyable pass-the-plate experience, perfect for a small, solid group of food-obsessed friends.With such an array of flavors spanning multiple ethnicities (Filipino, Thai, Vietnamese, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Hawaiian, the list goes on...), there are bound to be dishes you love, and maybe one or two you could pass on the next time around. Personally, my hands-down favorite is the Long Island Fluke (ironically, the least Asian-sounding item on the menu). It's fleshy and substantial and seared in a delicious black bean-brown butter sauce, while sustaining a light texture with each forkful. The Pretzel Pork & Chive Dumplings are a must, special thanks to the tahini-laced spicy mustard as the dish's sidekick. The Chilled Soba Noodle sits somewhere in the land of mid-satisfaction. A little bland and short on veggies, this is ultimately offset by the exceptional quality of the noodles. And, unfortunately, the Korean Fried Chicken just didn't do it for me. While I can't deny the juiciness of the meat, the dish lacked the heat and crispy exterior I had anticipated upon order. Across the table from you might be a dining companion who thinks just the opposite of these four aforementioned dishes, and, alas, all will be right with the world. Ah, the beauty of group dining and a small plates approach.What appears to be a complete set of fully-intact, beautiful furnishings, moldings, mantels, really - the works, adorns the entire interior of Talde. These stunning, antique mahogany wood Japanese carvings must've been a huge score for the owners, as the restaurant really takes on these pieces' shared personality. With its spacious corner property, open kitchen window, intimate booths, and a bustling front bar, Talde itself has certainly added to the personality of Park Slope, as well. Given its nightly wait since the day it opened, the popular establishment has clearly earned its neighborhood staple stripes, due in part to a fantastic front of the house, creative cuisine, sensational decor, and, of course, those killer cocktails.

Nothing remarkable.- Bloody mary was tasty and spicy. Pretty good.- Chicken wings and waffles were pretty good. The wings are crisp and well sauced but not soggy.  Waffle had an almost impossibly crisp exterior but were not overcooked. The syrup had brown butter and was INSANEly good. - BBQ cheesesteak bao - was tasty, but not reminiscent of cheesesteak at all. Should have been called bulgogi bao and would have been perfectly on point.- Chilaquiles were really tasty and pretty unique. Tortillas were well sauced, but had a crisp bite, which was enjoyable.  Tofu and egg added some additional meatiness to the dish, but could have used some herb garnish to add some freshness.- Shrimp toast was pretty tasty - shrimp puree enveloped in crisp buttery toast, covered with a fried egg. The Chinese sausage gravy had practically no flavor and was sort of disappointing.Overall, it was tasty but portions were pretty small and it was pricey for the simplicity of the dishes.  Could have definitely been more wowed.",0,0,0,Sasha H.,"New York, NY",33,575,0

1.0,7/17/2012,"Ok did I try a different Talde?  Did I stumble upon the Talde in the alternate universe, the one that really really sucks?Because to be honest, we waited two hours for one of the worst meals that I have ever had the misfortune of tasting my way through.  We spent the evening, tasting, calling our server (God bless her, she was sweet and very nice) over, and sending dishes back.  I mean, the drinks were good and strong, but even those can't remove the burnt gas taste of the charred kale salad from my memory.  Even those can't erase the embarrassment I felt for the chef when you look at the cheap potato bun filled haphazardly with a piece of pork, a piece of mushroom or a piece of fried fish.  Filet o fish at Mcdonalds holds itself to higher standards!The soup with noodles and pork was barely ok, and was the only thing we did not send back but we drowned that with siracha. And frankly we were starving so ramen soup seemed safe and reminiscent of college.The fried chicken craze?  The seasoning was bland, it fell of the chicken, the grapes clashed with the grease, yes it was greasy and there were bones in the breast.  At least butcher and clean the chicken properly.  Please. Please.The pad thai?  Oh my God.  The bacon was limp and greasy and chewed like rubber.  The oysters...Maha described it best when she said ""the shrimp tastes really mushy and weird"".  I said ""those are oysters.""  She replied ""ok ew"" that's enough, I'm going to puke.  It was like how to go on a diet on Friday night when you planned to binge. A word of advice chef: its way too early in the process to be going downhill and compromising on quality for quantity of customers.  Slow down.  Take reservations if you have to, and control the quality of the product you are putting out there.  A few five star reviews do not a good restaurant make.  Consistency is key.  Ask Kiwiana down the street, they're doing it right.",3,5,3,Lama B.,"Brooklyn, NY",229,592,50
2.0,7/15/2012,"Two & a half negative.... A major disappointment.  This place has been one of the hottest places in BK since its opening.  Seeing as we are in the middle of July and each weekend results in approximately 90 percent of all Brooklynites fleeing the city, I thought this would be an opportune time to get a chance to eat in the sleek hot spot without enduring a wait of several hours.  Anyway hopes were dashed to say the least.      Although their were some faint flashes of brilliance evident in a select few of the dishes, those being the only things that even earn the place its extra half star, most of the food was a muddled mess.  First the good;  -The minuscule Parilla Leaf App was a bracing shocking tingling sensation.-The addition of the bacon and fried oyster definitely infuses the Pad Thai with a delicious smokiness, though truth be told I detected way more of the Bacon than the Oyster which seemed to dissolve when the dish was mixed.I also liked the pretzel pork &chive dumplings although to me they did just kind of seem like good fried dumplings, the pretzel part just didn't come across that much.That was pretty much it for me, the place was for the most part a major drag.  Dud roll call;  The Korean Fried Chicken, though perfectly cooked was accompanied by a sauce that I found to be downright noxious, to the point that I nearly gagged.The sliders basically flat-lined.  The fluke one was only decent in so much as the only flavor that registered was the excellent, lightly fried fresh LI fluke.  Whatever additional sauce or other such chefly touches that were added didn't register at all.   --The sausage slider was nothingness and while the fresh mushroom on the mushroom slider was extremely tasty, there was barely any of it on there, & again the only taste that registered was the base ingredient.     Sadly, as underwhelming as the food was, it wasn't even the biggest problem with the place.  That would have to be the service, which was all wrong in every sense.  Our server, to put it nicely was completely awkward,  unfriendly and totally disengaged.  Its a good thing we had looked into the menu before hand, because she damn sure would not have been any help had we had any questions.  She seemed intent on projecting a sad sack demeanor and bringing everyone else down. Worse still the pacing was completely off.  Things started off with us becoming completely starved and waiting over 20 something minutes for out first course, those microscopic parilla leaves, which might have been more torturous than not bringing anything out.  About another 15 minutes later the small dumplings came out.  More time passes.   The next thing we know we are inundated with all of our remaining dishes basically at once, including the gigantic fried chicken.  Because of this bizarre order we went from being completely starved to rapidly full, and wound up having to wrap up all of the larger dishes, including the unmemorable kale salad which was inexplicably not served in the beginning stages.  Predictably, the bill was 25 bucks higher than I anticipated it would beAnyway, I hate to draft a review off of one horrible visit, but I am pretty sure we got all of the greatest hits of the menu, which that server told us doesn't change.  Also, there is just no way I am going back.",2,1,1,Brendan T.,"Brooklyn, NY",415,347,2090

5.0,7/15/2012,"This place is making me prematurely elderly. Why? Because now I actually get psyched about being ready for dinner at 5 pm. It's the only time you can get dinner there without a wait.  I find myself waking at 9:30 a.m. on weekends, all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed to be the first one in for brunch at 10. It's seriously that good. The place is around the corner from us, so my fiance and I come here a lot. The menu changes often, and at this point we've ordered maybe two thirds of what's on there for brunch and dinner, but these are a few of our favorites:Watermelon Margarita. You forget there is booze in here. This is dangerous. Perilla Leaf Wrap: tiny, spicy bits of bacon and peanut wrapped in a perilla leaf. Will set your mouth on fire in the very best way.Korean fried chicken and waffles. Spicy, sweet, fatty, awesome. I have no idea whether it's ""authentic"" Korean fried chicken, as I am not Korean and have never been to Korea. I just know that it tastes good. Spare ribs. We almost had to call off the marriage after failing to agree on who got the last one. Corn pancakes with serrano ham. It's like arepas and Spanish tapas had a baby and doused it in coconut syrup. I almost licked the plate.Lobster bao. Because bao and lobster rolls weren't good enough on their own.Hawaiian bun combo. Get one of each. Fight over who gets to finish what. Bloody Mary. Finally cheated on the watermelon margarita with this bad boy yesterday. Briny, gingery, dill-y goodness. Almost needed a wheelbarrow to cart my stomach home afterward.Every time we've been there, the service has been impeccable. The wait staff are friendly and un-snobby. It's fun to watch things come out of the kitchen. The very first day that Talde served brunch, we ended up here with our vegan friends, who asked the waiter if there was anything they could actually eat. The waiter disappeared and returned a while later to say that the chef wanted to thank them for coming and would make them a special vegan pad thai. See? This is how it's done.

5.0,7/6/2012,"Having recently experienced the Talde brunch, I felt it necessary to update my review. The old review of the dinner experience still holds -- it's still great and totally worth a trip. But, on to the topic of brunch...My brunch cravings tend to be a function of what I've done the night prior. If it was a quiet night in, I'm interested in something unique, interesting, and flavorful. If it was one of those stumble home at 4 AM nights and inadvertently pass out on the couch with Turner Classic Movies on (hey, you gotta watch the classics at some point), well, let's say food isn't always the first thing on my mind. But, beyond that extreme, I can't imagine any physical state where I'd decline a trip to Talde for brunch. In brief, it was the best brunch I've had in Park Slope.I was fortunate to go to brunch with a fairly large group so we got a chance to try a very large portion of the menu. Everything we had was great but here are the highlights:Korean Chicken Wings and Waffles - The wings are tossed in a relatively mild sauce (a little kick, but nothing too aggressive) and placed atop a waffle. This is served with a butter and coconut maple syrup that is absolutely spectacular in combination with the wings and waffle. My only complaint with this dish is that it didn't come with a second waffle and twice as many wings.Sausage, Egg, and Cheese Fried Rice - Um, this is exactly what it sounds like and would make one of the greatest hangover dishes ever. Seriously, whoever came up with this did so after a massive bender the night before. That's the only explanation I can come up with.Shrimp Toast - ""Toast"" might be a bit of a misnomer here. This is more like a sort of thick, dense pancake with shrimp cooked in, topped with egg and served with sausage gravy. It's a pretty decadent, rich dish and I don't think I could have eaten more than one piece but the piece I had was really nice.Of the ""sides"" on the menu, we really enjoyed the fruit salad. The whipped tofu was an interesting compliment to the fruit and, in general, that dish was a nice way to break up the absolute gluttony at our table. Honestly, everything was good and well worth trying, these are simply the dishes that stand out in my memory. But, if you get there and see something that strikes your fancy, it's likely great and I'd definitely encourage ordering it.",2,2,2,John H.,"Durham, NC",39,109,24

Last Sunday, we planned our open house browsing so we would end up very close to Talde.  The bar was a welcome respite from the unmerciful heat outside, and we gladly waited 20 minutes for a table. Once seated, a friendly server explained the menu and in no time we were getting our first dishes. We managed NOT to try everything on the menu, but that just means I can hardly wait to go back. We tried the pretzel, pork and chive dumplings, shrimp toast with Chinese sausage gravy and lobster bao.

Perhaps it was the company, perhaps the wine, or a combination of all 3, but I left there in true food-orgasm form!Appetizers were: #369 - Let me start this off by saying I am not a fan of vegetables. My friend assured me that I would like this dish, despite my skepticism. And he was right! I gobbled up the entire dish. The sweet ginger flavoring made all of the difference. Note that the vegetables used are seasonal. Pretzel Pork & Chive Dumplings - Perfectly crisp on the outside, with a bundle of savory pork on the inside. Be warned the dumplings are a bit salty - just like a pretzel (duh, you should have been tipped off by the name--yeah, I'm talking to you, you reviewers that complained about the salt).But I like pretzels and I like salt, so I thought they were absolutely wonderful! Dinner was comprised of the following:BBQ Beef  Short Ribs - These were epic! I slowly savored every morsel, and I mean slowly! It was like that that scene in When Harry Met Sally, were Meg Ryan starts having an orgasm. ""Oh my God, Oh my God"" was repeated several times, eyes closed and all! The meat was so tender and literally melted in your mouth. I was genuinely sad when the dish was finished.Korean Fried Chicken - Fried chicken and grapes? You've got to be kidding me right?! NOPE! The chicken is fried to perfection, and the meat is moist and juicy. The spicy kimchee yogurt gives it just the perfect kick of flavor, not too hot, not too overbearing, while the sweetness of the grapes provide the perfect balance on your palette.Dessert- the only one on the menu, and the only one needed:Halo Halo- Not to sound disgusting, but this dish looks like someone literally puked in a bowl with all the different colors and textures mixed together. But it is truly divine! Who thought shaved ice paired with agar agar jelly, fruit and Captain Crunch would taste so damn good! It's a light and refreshing dessert- a wonderful way to finish a divine meal! It was so good, we even convinced the 2 couples sitting on each side of our table to get it.

The appetizers did not disappoint, the Pretzel Dumplings served with Mustard are AMAZING!!! I would order 2 orders if I go back. The shrimp toast, while not as good as the shrimp toast at Tao, was very good...my wife didnt enjoy it because it was heavy on the shrimp and shes not a huge seafood fan. After the appetizers, we had the Wonton Noodle Soup which had pork wontons, smoked pork, broccoli rabe, and a cooked six minute egg. Everything was delicious, but it could have done without the egg...we didnt end up eating that.. For dinner we got the Char Siu Smoked Pork Spare Ribs and the BBQ Beef  Short Ribs.

I find the servers to be a bit brisk and not necessarily helpful in terms of deciding what sides to pair with what main dishes, how many dishes to order, etc. The plating is inelegant at best; dishes are served on plastic bowls and plates reminiscent of cheap Asian joints. I understand the vibe they are going for, but if they really wanted a good contrast maybe they could still use this plasticware and at least plate it elegantly? As of now, the food is sort of thrown down onto the plates and bowls and ends up looking really sloppy. It's not really what I would expect given the amazing food served there.This being said, the pretzel pork dumplings are to-die-for, the char su ribs with watermelon are fantastic, and the cocktails are delish.

But y'all, it was delicious. The friends I was with had been during Talde's opening week and were underwhelmed then--they reported that this menu and experience were much improved over that night.Five of us shared the pork and pretzel dumplings, salmon crepe, slider samplers (pork sausage, fish, and shiitake), short ribs, whole roasted fish, oyster and bacon pad thai, the #369 veggies, and the grilled corn. All totally wonderful. I could have left the pad thai and tried a soup, but I also could have eaten an order of the three sliders for dinner--they exactly what I wanted. Super flavorful and buttery bunned goodness. Everything was clearly fresh and freshly made--my only complaint (and this is tiny), is that so much of it was SO oily.

The watermelon margarita, sour, sweet, and refreshing, in a lowball glass, for 10 dollars. not as good a ""deal,"" but a very tasty drink. Lots of good draft choices for beer.Food: Papaya salad-yes it was too spicy, but I couldn't stop eating little bites of it. You might mix it up a bit more, I saw some slices that didn't have any spice, and some that were slathered in it.Korean fried chicken-We got the wingettes, but we also just got some boneless chicken breast PERFECT fried and then sliced, with a layer of kimchi yogurt underneath. I loved this dish. I do love buffalo wings, but the chicken, sauce, crunch were something totally new.Oyster bacon pad thai-everyone else loved this. I was a bit meh. What I would have liked is if not everything was SO punchy. There was not a lot of balance. We ordered a side of roasted corn (which is corn on the cob) to offset some of the anticipated spice, and even THAT was spicy. So fail. Maybe we should have ordered the fried rice.Did see Dale Talde there, and I always think it's cool if the celebrity chef is actually being a chef (which he was, as far as I could see).",0,0,0,Jane Y.,"Washington, DC",101,192,9
5.0,6/15/2012,"Love this place. Friendly, inviting and a cool, if a little loud, space. I love all the details and artifacts and antiques tucked away here and there.They're always very accommodating with the baby too (it is Park Slope I guess!!).Brunch is the winner for us. The pork and pretzel dumplings are killer! Crunchy and nicely seasoned. I had the lobster bao buns, 2 very generously filled bao with a mayonnaise dressing. For 14 bucks, a steal. The short rib tacos are amazing too, smoky, sweet meat, cortija cheese and kim chee. A ton of raw radish too, strangely. The crunch was nice but a little too much for me. Bacon pad thai was pretty good, a little heavy on the soy/fish sauce. Still delicious though.Major bonus points: litre Asahi cans AND a Hitachino option(they stopped making it for a while after the Japan earthquake, the brewery processed water instead.)Overall great spot and I'm glad to be living a stones throw away!

4.0,6/14/2012,"I got lucky when I stopped at Talde early on a Saturday afternoon and was seated immediately.  I've since gone back and was not so lucky.  However, I consider it worth a bit of a wait.  The watermelon margaritas are a great way to pass the time.  On our first vist we had the Pretzel Pork and Chive Dumplings. They are a must.  The Korean Fried chicken is like nothing you've ever eaten before.  I crave it.  The second time we tried the soft shell crab banh mi wasn't so great, a bad choice, too heavy.  I can't wait to go back and try everything else on the menu.",0,0,0,Shar C.,"Manhattan, NY",1,13,0
1.0,6/13/2012,"NOT impressed. I really wanted to love this place especially after seeing Dale's wonderful personality on VICE Munchies. I brought two of my girlfriends here, one was a gluten-free vegan and they were really not accommodating at all. I even asked the server if she could see if Dale was there just so we could see if he could make something special for her so I could concentrate on enjoying ordering anything that looked good. The sticky rice I had was really bland. I liked the presentation a lot but it didn't do anything for me as far as flavor wise. I kind of picked at it for a little while before my shrimp wonton soup with ramen noodles came out. When the noodles came out the broth was pretty much flavorless and the ramen noodles were so soggy and so was the wonton wrapping. I was so sad. I already didnt want to speak up to the server because she had asked the chef to prepare special Saigon Crepe Pancakes for my gluten-free vegan friend. My friend also ordered the veggie special side dish. When it was communicated to our server, she put the order in as a SPECIAL made veggie dish for her with ""special"" house made veggies. She ended up getting charged for an entree portion.Okay so the worst part of all was that we really didn't want to make a big deal about it, but the server insisted on bringing the manager on duty. The manager apologized and made a fuss about taking it off the bill because she claimed it was my friends confusion and not the problem of the server or the kitchen. She blatantly said ""Next time you come in, we won't adjust your bill because it was not the fault of us, but the confusion on your part""Well guess what.. Thanks for that.. there won't be a next time. Sorry Dale, you are cool, but I can't stand people talking to my friends or myself like that.",2,1,1,Jerrica J.,"New York, NY",959,1361,221
2.0,6/12/2012,"Wow what a bad few days for Filipinos.  First, my toddler son takes a shit in the bath tub.  Second, Manny Pacquiao loses a fight.  Finally, Dale Talde's restaurant kind of sucks.My wife describes me as a slightly less attractive version of Dale Talde so I thought it would be a good idea to go to his restaurant and see what my favorite Top Chef contestant/doppleganger had brewing.We started with the Korean Fried Chicken Wings which had nothing Korean about them.  The wings were basically Buffalo Wings.  The server described them as having ""kim-chee"" essence infused into the batter but I couldn't taste any.  For buffalo wings however, they were not bad.We moved on to the char siu spare ribs which were way too salty.  Maybe if there was some rice to tame the saltiness I would have liked the dish more.Next was the oyster and bacon pad thai.  Again this dish was a little on the salty side but I could tell that this could work if executed better.We ended the night with Talde's take on the traditional filipino 'Halo-Halo' shaved ice desert.  This was a fuckin' travesty.  My Lolo and Lola are definitely rolling over in their graves.  It was basically a bowl of milk with shaved ice, random fruits like raspberries and bananas along with some of the usual halo-halo ingredients.  All of this was topped with some fruity pebbles (???!!!).  Honestly it looked like something my 1 year old made in day care.  Just go to Red Ribbon for the Halo-Halo or even Purple Yam in ditmas park.To end this perfect night, I get home and not only get a case of the mud butt but I also vomit most of the meal.  It was probably just the combination of foods that caused this to happen but regardless Dale Talde, please pack your knives!",1,14,0,RJ S.,"South Pasadena, CA",21,103,5
3.0,6/8/2012,"I have really mixed feelings about Talde. I'll tell you why.First the good - had a really good brunch with a bunch of people where we ordered & shared a fair portion of the brunch menu. The bacon pad thai was by far the standout winner, but I also really liked the chicken & waffles and spare ribs. The dumplings were good but I didn't taste the 'pretzel' thing at all. It's a bit pricey & we had to wait a while, but it was a really good brunch overall.A few days later, I was craving more of that damn pad thai, so I tried to order for pickup. I told them that I lived a bit of a walk away so I wouldn't be able to get there right away but I'd get there as fast as I could. When I showed up, I was told it would just be a minute & was asked to pay. Then I waited for about 5 minutes, and was told it would be another 10. Then another 10 minutes went by, and I was told still just a few more minutes. All in, it took 35 minutes to get my food - pretty different from the 15 I was quoted on the phone, causing my concern about getting there in time - and ended up being almost $40 worth of takeout. That's a lot. Starving and eager to make the bus, I bolted, but called back later to mention that had I just been told up front that my order was never put in, I would have just cancelled it & not been loitering in their bar for half an hour on a busy night. Rather than any kind of apology, the manager told me that she normally wouldn't have agreed to go out of her way to accommodate my request to hold off for a few minutes before putting the order in. She never even admitted that she simply forgot. All I wanted was some acknowledgement of the situation, and maybe the offer of a free drink the next time I came in. Instead I got a really bad attitude. Had it been a Friday night, I would have understood that I was causing a fuss during a rush, but when I called it was almost 10pm on a Monday. If Talde can figure out how to treat their customers, I'd be really stoked to eat more of that bacon pad thai. By the way - the fried oysters on the dinner version don't travel well, I'd only get that if you're eating there.",2,0,0,Colleen L.,"Brooklyn, NY",266,330,61
3.0,6/7/2012,"The chatter surrounding the opening of Talde had me crazy-excited for a fresh new restaurant close to my apartment. When the doors finally opened a nightly crowd of people waiting outside the doors and an always-overpacked bar made me both wary and excited about trying out Talde. After waiting weeks for my fellow Park Slopers' eagerness to die down I visited Talde late one Saturday evening. Regardless of walking in at about 10:30 pm me and my date still waited about 10 minutes for a table. We squeezed awkwardly through an extremely crowded bar to a small table in the back. While the decor is nice, the atmosphere was not what I expected. Hip hop music played loudly and the patrons therefore spoke to each other more loudly. The restaurant had a buzzy, hyped and young feeling about it, while I was expecting a more relaxed, albeit more uptight dinner.Our waitress was knowledgeable about the wine list but our dinner felt rushed. Our food was brought out quickly; one thing after the other-- this is not a place to enjoy a leisurely or lingering dinner. In ways this made me appreciate the food less. I had the kale salad, which is listed as an appetizer but was definitely enough to act as an entree. I really enjoyed the salad, although it was heavy on liquid-y dressing.I left Talde satisfied with my service and impressed by the food, but happy to be leaving what felt like a new club/lounge trying to understand its identity.

We asked to sit at the counter and it was nice to watch 'em cook up a storm.Service was good, and we got our drinks right away. My watermelon margarita was pretty, refreshing, and not too sweet.For appetizers, we had the perilla leaf (light, nicely balanced flavors, with a kick, but prob don't need to order again) and the pretzel pork & chive dumplings (NOM! the filling was so flavorful, and the pretzel-y skin was thankfully subtle--best thing we had that night).For entrees, we had the crispy oyster & bacon pad thai (love me some bacon, but it was too smoky for me for pad thai, and the fried oysters were delish but too few) and the Long Island fluke (my least fave dish of the night--fish was cooked nicely but just wasn't a fan of their black bean sauce), with a side of shrimp egg foo yung fried rice (nice balance to the flavorful entrees and good with hot sauce).And for dessert, we got a big playful bowl of halo halo, topped with Cap'n Crunch and all kinds of jelly goodies.Some of the dishes were better than others, but good enough that we'll def be back to try other things.

2.0,6/1/2012,"I waited quite some time before writing this review because I was rather disappointed with this restaurant and I wanted to give myself a chance to cool off. Well, I still have the same feelings:The food: nothing exceptional, especially for the price. The sliders were alright, not awesome. The pretzel dumplings just tasted like regular dumplings, but cost more because of the intrigue created by the name (lame!). Short ribs were nothing more than what I have had in the past, at restaurants with much less fanfare than this one. Everything else was nothing special, but expensive for the quality. Look, I'm not cheap! But I know quality and this isn't it.The Service: talk about selling! It was so in-your-face-over-the-top-salesy. Gross! We just want to have what we ordered, you don't need to keep trying to sell us more sides! Thanks. Server had absolutely no personality or interest in being pleasant, he just cared about the final amount and his tip. He also clearly had no experience waiting tables before. Talk about rude. At least if you are pleasant we can forgive some of the other stuff. The Atmosphere: suburban Applebee's. I'm sorry but it's true! Except for the bar, the place is over-thought. The table at our booth was as wide as the Sahara desert. Our friend may as well have been sitting at another table. The music was way too loud and the fan above our heads cooled off the food within minutes. Need I go on?

We showed up around 6 and after putting our name down for a table were told the wait would be 45 minutes- 1 hour. Being that 2 of us are 7-8 months pregnant we hoped it wouldn't be so long. We were able to wait and sit on bar stools in the bar area without feeling cramped so it wasn't too bad. We started off with the AMAZING pretzel and pork dumplings in the bar area and soon after we devoured 2 orders in no time- we were very pleased to learn that our table was ready (couldn't have been more than a 30 min wait) and our bar check had been transferred to our table. Seamless transition! I hate when a restaurant can't transfer your tab from bar to table. Well done. We were informed that all food is served ""family style"" and is brought out as soon as it's ready to go in the kitchen- me likey.

3.0,5/28/2012,"3.5 stars.I came here a few weeks ago with my fiancee. The first thing we noticed: the place is really noisy. This could be because, like many places in NY, the restaurant packs people in--the tables are all close to each other. Which gets me to my next disappointment at Talde: for a pricier restaurant in the neighborhood, it really could make the ambiance nicer. The booths and tables remind me more of a chain restaurant, lbeit a more upscale one (more Cheesecake factory than Red Lobster). This is not what I expected of Talde.After being seated, we were served by a very attentive waiter. The service was great the whole night: patience, helpful suggestions about what to eat, frequent check-ins without being overbearing. I was very impressed with the service.Now on to the food. We split the mango salad for an appetizer. For  the entree, she had the crab banh mi and I had the fried chicken. While we thought everything was tasty, what struck us most about our meal was that everything was one note: spicy. The mango salad is very spicy (which I enjoyed), but then the banh mi (from what fiancee said) was also very spicy, as was my chicken. Some variation in flavor would have been appreciated; at the very least, some rice should accompany the main dishes to help cut the barrage of spiciness. That being said, I really enjoyed the chicken--it was perfectly crispy on the outside, and moist and tender on the inside. For dessert, we had the halo halo--which, being served on shaved ice, was a welcome treat after the spicy meal. I'm not too interested in returning, but I'll give the place another shot someday!

4.0,5/20/2012,"4.5 starsAfter waiting weeks for my friends from Chicago to visit NYC so we can get a reservation all together for Talde, I finally had the opportunity to dine at this delicious establishment.  I must say, I cannot wait to return and try everything else on the menu. We started off with the Perilla leaves, pretzel dumplings, and Filipino sausage Hawaiian buns.  The kitchen was kind enough to make one order of Perilla leaves without peanuts for a friend who is allergic.  Although the bite of the Perilla leaf app is delicious, it didn't quite blow me away like the reviews rave about.  But that likely is because I grew up with my mom growing Perilla leaves in the backyard and tasting them in various different dishes that didn't make this one unique.  But the review of the dinner only gets better here on out.  The dumplings were so delicious and special with the subtle pretzel flavor.  And the Hawaiian bun Filipino sausage sliders were so good that I wish my friends were allergic so I could have ate them all myself.  You will be doing yourself a disservice if you do not order these.  Entree-wise we had to order the Korean fried chicken, oyster/bacon pad thai, and the market fish of the day which was a branzino.  Korean fried chicken was good- more Franks/buffalo sauce than expected.  Good kick, just different than the Korean kick.  Yummy nonetheless.  Worth ordering definitely.  The branzino was fresh and tasty... I'm glad no one else wanted to eat the head because I got to pick at all the meat myself, which was so good I didn't want to stop.  And the pad thai.... oh goodness.  I honestly don't like pad thai.  I think it's bland and boring.  But THIS pad thai.... the bacon goodness and few (too few) pieces of oyster made it sooooo memorable that I will likely be craving it all week.  Now THAT is the way pad thai should be made.  Oh and don't forget to order the side of kale.  Somehow it tastes smokey and it was so good I could have had an entire plateful to myself.  I think I may have taken most of it when my friends weren't looking actually.  Lastly, dessert.  Now, halo halo may not be fancy, but it's down to earth classic Filipino that reminds me of my friend's family parties but better.  It was a light, refreshing way to end the meal.  Oh and I would be irreverent if I didn't mention they have Lagunitas Sumpin Sumpin on draft.  Icing on the top was Chef Dale coming out to say hi and chat.  It's extremely cool to see him cooking in the kitchen out of the corner of your eye all night then have him ask you how you liked what he just made.  He's awesome in every respect and I can't wait to come back.  Like I said, 4.5 stars.  Perhaps when I come back and try the rest of his menu it would very possibly change to a 5.",0,0,0,Agnes C.,"New York, NY",66,150,36
5.0,5/19/2012,"As a foodie, I was excited to try this place and am now writing after having dinner on two occasions.  The first time I was here, I would have given the place 4 stars but I think the kinks since opening have earned Chef Dale and company another star.  On my latest visit, came in with a party of 4 and got seated in one of the booths immediately (granted it was Tuesday night around 9:30).  The bar and restaurant were very active still, decent service by waitress who seemed a bit busy, draft beers were normally priced with a good selection.  So far, this place would be merely ok.The food though, brings it to another level and was oh so delish - we ordered the pork and pretzel dumplings, the daily greens which were sugar pea pods, the egg foo young fried rice, the bacon and oyster pad thai, the Korean fried chicken and the Char Sui pork ribs.  Each dish was well seasoned, thoughtfully executed and combined interesting, albeit, not groundbreaking elements.  Really tasty all around, with two tiny negatives - first I thought the chicken was served somewhat lukewarm.  I don't know if it was under a heat lamp for too long, but I would suggest that the kitchen do a refry before serving to get it nicely heated before it hits the table.  Next, for the price some of the dishes were a bit paltry - mainly the veggies and the rice dish.  If they are truly meant to be shared, considering the profit margin on those dishes, I would add a bit of volume to those dishes.  Otherwise, much better in nearly all aspects than its sister restaurant Thistle Hill Tavern.",1,0,0,Jenny M.,"Brooklyn, NY",136,172,12

You're not the closest place in the world to me, and hell, it's not exactly convenient for me to walk from my place to your door, but I do think we make a great team. I went with two girlfriends for a little pre-party dinner. We went at 5:30 and were promptly sat at the Chef's Table. There is ALWAYS a wait at Talde, so be warned. We ordered the roasted corn, the fried chicken, the oyster and bacon pad thai, the hawaiian buns with fluke and also a pork one, and the pork dumplings. It was more than enough food. We were stuffed beyond words and couldn't get the dessert - which is only one thing and I can't honestly remember what it was.I can't really pick a favorite, but I loved the chicken. It was out of this world. I totally think I could go back with someone and get two sides and split the chicken. It's more than enough food. The price tag looks steep but not when you consider that everything is designed to be shared. The sauce is fantastic and I love that we got both dark and white meat. Really though. That sauce is beyond words... I'm not an oyster girl but the pad thai was the best I've ever had. I couldn't believe how flavorful it was. It was like I finally learned what pad thai was supposed to taste like in this dish. Watch out for the chiles though. They'll get you.Everything else was just down-right awesome. I think that people aren't kidding when they say to get the Hawaiian buns. Always ask your waiter and waitress for their advice. They won't steer you wrong. The pork dumplings (in a pretzel dumpling case) were the perfect consistency and perfect blend of spicy and salty. The red curry sauce for the roasted corn was spot on. I can't say anything bad about this place. I am over the moon. I can't wait to bring the boy for the chicken.THEY HAVE TAKE OUT. YOU CAN ORDER AND NOT SIT DOWN.

4.0,4/30/2012,"The food is delicious.  Unique preparations of familiar favorites. Came for dim sum brunch and enjoyed everything.  The bloody mary with pickled ginger is spicy, complex and fantastic.  Clear winner for brunch was the short rib tacos.  The bacon pad thai (we were warned of whole chilies but none in sight) with a runny egg (brunch version served with egg while dinner version served with fried oysters) was really great, though a little on the sweet side.  The pretzel dumplings were plump and juicy on the inside, salty and crunchy on the outside and served with an awesome tahini mustard - fantastic.  The lobster buns were nice - soft pillowy bao stuffed with a chunky lobster salad.  The bill certainly adds up quickly, but service is excellent and the room is casual but hip.    I do have a gripe with the bar policy though -- seems strange to me that diners can order dumplings at the bar but can't order any other food items during brunch (not sure what the dinner policy is).. It was painful to watch a solo diner wait a half hour at the bar for a single table just to order 2 small plates.. Seems not great for business (why waste a 2-top for a single person who will happily stay at the bar?) and a big turn off for people on their own who prefer eating at the bar.  The restaurant certainly has the capacity to offer food at the nice, big bar (dumplings are food, right?), so, what's the deal?",1,0,0,Julia G.,"New York, NY",25,87,0

The perfect influence of Asian instead of gimmicky. The bar area is to be stared at intently with that mirror and dragon.We got there at 6pm and were told the wait would be an hour and a half. Cool, there's a Barnes&Noble down the block that's perfect for killing time at.Coming back to Talde, we get seated at the bar-like booths. Our server was great. She let us take our time and made helpful suggestions. IMPORTANT: 2 of us can't have gluten. They have TONS of options that are gluten-free(GF). I was wary because Asian-inspired food tends to mean soy sauce, of which most brands have wheat in them to enhance the flavor quickly without going thru the real method of fermenting and letting it develop naturally. It was a huge relief to hear from the server that a lot of stuff were definitely safe and went out of their way to reconfirm. Fried chicken was a go! It's coated with rice flour.We had....(GF) Perilla leaf: A-M-A-Z-I-N-G Yes it's puny as hell and pricey for $5, but as the first dish to arrive and be tasted, it packed a hell of a punch in the tastebuds and was worth the dollar per teeny leaf. It totally upped our expectations for the food to come. Oh, and get rid of the crap plastic Chinatown dishes. They cheapen the food. At least get the porcelein version. They're not that much more in price. (GF) Saigon Crepes: bland and crispy, not memorable. Hot sauce required to impart flavor. (GF) Lobster Tom Kha Gai: One note flavor of spicy and not even a good one. If you have to eat this, eat it last. The flatness kills out any chance of tasting any other dish. If you can't handle spicy, then don't even order this. Crispy Oyster and Bacon Pad Thai: Boring. Oysters were over-salted. (GF) Korean Fried Chicken: The best part? The grapes that are floating in the bad hot sauce that tasted like Frank's. Kimchee is a powerhouse of flavor. Yogurt is creamy/tangy. Why was the sauce only watery and mildly hot? State of friedness was not met. Try coating/frying twice to get some crunch.BBQ Smoked Pork Shoulder: Watermelon on the side was great, however we didn't come here to eat delicious fruit. Save your money and get yourself half a pound of roast pork in Chinatown (Grand Street area in Manhattan or 8th Avenue in Sunset Park Brooklyn, etc) for less than half the price of this dish. (GF) Shrimp Fried Rice: Don't pick it or add hot sauce.Banana Leaf Sticky Rice: It was fine.Seriously I did not go in expecting anything because I had never even heard of the chef or eaten at Thistle Hill. However it does NOT deserve all the hype it is getting. INSPIRE me with your food! That Perilla Leaf makes such a strong statement that every dish after dish was such a killer disappointment. If you know where to buy the best in Asian food also served on those same plastic dishes, which is so freaking easy in NYC that it's ridiculous, then you know this is not the spot to frequent.

I wish they would lessen the talk about family style (it makes veggies feel bad) and emphasize the deliciousness of all the items.Thanks to Talde for entering Park Slope with a delicious bang!",0,0,0,Patty P.,"Oakland, CA",9,53,0
3.0,4/25/2012,"I'd be lying if I said I came to Talde purely for the food. As a top chef fan, I thought that chef Dale was one of the best chefs they featured, and I was eager to visit Pk slope when I heard he opened his namesake restaurant. The space was surprisingly spacious, and it's a little old-school in a good way, made even more visually appealing with an open kitchen.  While we didn't hear any angry tantrums or f-bombs from the kitchen, instead, we were bombarded by a waiter who, while kind, was also uncomfortably pushy. As none of us 7 had ever been there before, he told us that all plates were meant to be shared and that he recommended  4 or 5 apps and 4-5 entrees for the table. While we mulled over the menu, he definitely laid on the pressure for us to get multiples of certain dishes to a point where we just had to cut him off and tell him what we wanted. Even after we ordered, the waiter was relentless. We all appreciate attentive service, but there's a difference between asking whether you want another drink once, and asking it 5-6 times over the course of a meal. The guy just needed to chill as his service left a slightly bitter aftertaste to a pretty solid meal. Out of the 10~ dishes we shared, highlights were mainly the apps and sides including the filipino sausage hawaiian bread buns (like a heavenly slider on a buttery, slightly sweet bun), the juicy and pleasingly salty pretzel and pork dumplings, and the squash/tofu/kale salad which reminded me of the northern spy food co. kale salad. Their shrimp fried rice was beloved at the table as well as the special market greens of the day, which were sugar snap peas. Unfortunately, the entrees were kinda duds. This Korean thought that the korean fried chicken should've been renamed Buffalo fried chicken as the sauce reminded me more of buffalo wings than the soy/garlic flavors I expected. Also, the short ribs were flat and dry compared to the kalbijims and braised short ribs I've had elsewhere.  There's only one dessert, and it's huge--as much as the waiter tried to convince us to order 2-3 bowls of the halo halo shaved ice, we got one for the table, and it was plenty. The captain crunch was a nice touch that worked with the milky shaved ice and jelly, like a momofuku cereal milk 2.0. If I lived in pk slope, I could see Talde being a monthly spot for drinks and some apps. There's a frenetic vibe, and the place was packed on a friday night. Also, I like that they take reservations for parties of 6 or more. Talde has a solid neighborhood spot going that just needs some fine-tuning. And chef Dale doesn't have to worry about this being an episode of restaurant wars.",3,1,2,Eric K.,"New York, NY",62,159,26
1.0,4/25/2012,"Wow. I dont mean to discredit anyones reviews but I will :) or hopefully for those of you who dont feed into the many gimmicks of bourgeois eatery. First off Im not going to go into great lengths to describe every dish. Between the Pork Dumplings, Fried chicken with grapes it was all sub-par food sold to you with fancy jargon and sophisticato explainations that make you feel what your eating is important. Dumplings in Sunset Park for 1 buck out flavor these pretzeled porked overpriced appetizers. The chicken was the same, the chicken I used to get from the corner Chinese restaurant 2 wings for 1 buck....exactly the same. Its cool how they threw in some grapes to cleanse the pallete but for 20 something dollars it was ridiculous. The worst was the waitress with her over the top smiles alluring us to buy a bunch of food because she feels that reflects  their dining experience.

4.0,4/25/2012,"Choosing just one appetizer off of Talde's one-page menu was never going to happen. Thankfully, my friend Marissa was down to order a feast with me. To start, I opted for the Pretzel Pork & Chive Dumplings, which came about from Dale's time on Top Chef. Although they were good, I was hoping for steamed dumplings instead. For some reason I imagined the pretzel as a filler with the pork and chives rather than the actual wrapper. The filling, however, was so flavorful and delicious. The chives added a nice crunch, while the pork was succulent and extra salty thanks to the pretzels.When Marissa told me the Kale Salad was one of her favorite things on the menu, I tried not to balk. I love kale, but I hate salads. I promised her I'd try a bite or two, but I didn't think I'd enjoy it much. Thankfully, I was so wrong. The tempura flakes scattered in with the crisp kale made for a textured bite that was anything but boring. Throw in some apples and squash, and you've got yourself a bright mix that had even this salad hater going back for seconds.The entrees offered at Talde are a nice mix of fish, chicken and hearty meat. I've recently become obsessed with fava beans, so the Long Island Fluke with fava, cilantro and brown butter seemed an appropriate choice. I still have dreams about this dish. I even tried to recreate it at home to no avail. The fluke was flaky and moist, with a richness from the brown butter like nothing I've ever had before. I mixed it with a side of Shrimp Fried Rice that was a fresh, elevated spin on the classic take-out staple. Dare I say it, but the fried rice actually tasted almost healthy.Marissa ordered the Whole Market Fish with a smattering of tumeric-tomato in banana leaves. It was such a fun dish to share and customize with tortillas on the side. A dab of fish, a spoonful of rice and some greens make a pretty tasty match-up.",1,0,1,Victoria P.,"Astoria, NY",25,57,0
2.0,4/22/2012,"I was a fan of Dale from Top Chef and had high hopes for Talde.  The restaurant is nice and the staff was super friendly but the food was just ok.  Nothing really blew my mind.  Personally, I don't think the fusion part added anything to the food.  In some cases, it took away.  The Korean Fried Chicken was not anywhere near as crispy as in any of the other well-know korean fried chicken joints and the yogurt sauce was too much.  the fried rice was really nothing special and not any better than your corner take-out.  for about $20 less, i could go a few blocks up to sunset park and get better asian (chinese) food.  It's too bad, I really wanted to like it.  I'm sure he'll do well, it was jam packed as I hear it is every night.  Good luck Dale!",0,0,0,Syl S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,15,0
4.0,4/21/2012,"I was completely prepared to dislike this restaurant...then I started to eat.I made a reservation for a party of 7 about a month in advance and was offered only a 6:30pm or 10pm time slot. Strike one. The restaurant called me twice to confirm our reservation the day-of, the second time because apparently no one wrote it down the first time. Strike two. Our party then waited 45 minutes to be seated despite the 6:30pm reservation. Strike three.Ah, but once we were seated and appetizers began to arrive things turned around. The pretzel & pork dumplings. The octopus. The Hawaiian buns. Each more flavorful than the next. Then came the perfectly balanced Lobster Tom Kha Gai. Our entrees were the Kimchee fried chicken (tasty), the branzino (perfectly - I mean PERFECTLY - cooked, crispy outside and moist within), and the oyster pad thai (this one has received some rough reviews, although it was too sweet for my taste as a solo entree, I thought it worked very, very well as part of a big family-style feast).It was a meal to be savored.I wasn't that impressed with their single dessert offering - a shaved ice hodge podge with just a few too many ingredients.

4.0,4/18/2012,"This is a thing that frequently happens to me: I elect to go to awesome, meaty restaurants on Monday. Meatless Monday. The realization always occurs around lunchtime before a dinner reservation, and I spend the intervening hours between this realization and dinner moping around muttering, ""I GUESS I'll just get some SIDES.""This is to say that I approached my dinner at Talde with much trepidation and more than a little regret at not being able to try about 85% of the menu, including the much-lauded pretzel dumplings and the ancestor-pleasing (that is, my ancestors) Filipino pork buns. I vowed to drown my sorrows in cocktails (and I did, not that I needed to).Talde's menu left me with a small handful of options: the market vegetable Hawaiian buns, the market ramen, and a couple sides. It is GREATLY to Talde's credit that I didn't miss the meat at all. The mushroom Hawaiian bun (market vegetable = mushroom during my visit) was incredible. Probably more flavorful than 9 out of 10 meat buns I've had in my life. The market ramen broth more than made up for the lack of meat swimming in it. And the roast corn side was a spicy, delicious extravaganza. It also, the server kindly pointed out, has a touch of oyster sauce on it. I responded that I'd pretend I didn't hear that, but legitimate vegetarians beware: the oyster sauce isn't noted on the menu.I'm finding that the best restaurants are the ones where you're forced to order the non-obviously-crowd-pleasing dishes, and you still have a satisfying meal.

5.0,4/18/2012,"So, I live one block away from Talde and have been aware of the hype for months now. I went in with really, really high expectations, and that can often lead to disappointment.There were NO disappointments at Talde last night. On the contrary, every aspect of the meal was outstanding. We got there for a fashionably late dinner at about 10 p.m. and the host seated us at a table at the window within seconds. Our server, Ramon, came right over and introduced himself. He was welcoming, informative, and funny, without being intrusive or over-the-top in terms of his descriptions of the food. My boyfriend and I had some trouble deciding what to order - literally, I could have picked anything on the menu - but we ultimately settled on:-Pretzel Pork and Chive Dumplings-Green Mango Salad-Char Siu Pork Ribs with Watermelon and Spicy Mustard-Korean Fried Chicken with Kimchi Yogurt and Grapes-Banana Leaf Sticky RiceThe dumplings are what every dumpling should taste like. A slight crisp on the outside, tender and flavorful on the inside. Just make sure you try a bite without the spicy mustard first, just so you can taste the complex flavors. I loved the green mango salad, though if spiciness isn't your thing, I would avoid it. My hands-down favorite dish was the Char Siu Ribs - oh man, they fell apart as you tried to spear them with a fork (or chopsticks!). The watermelon complemented the flavors perfectly - so refreshing. The fried chicken was so good that my boyfriend stopped eating to ask Ramon how it had been cooked. The consistency was incredible. The banana leaf sticky rice was presented beautifully, but was probably my least favorite dish, though my boyfriend liked it. I think the banana leaf flavor just isn't my thing.We also had drinks: a watermelon margarita and a perilla leaf mojito, both of which were outstanding.The bill came to $120 with tip - $60/apiece, which is why we had been waiting to go...Talde is a special treat.

The helpful wait staff was great too. They are very careful to explain that meals will come up as they are ready, not in any specific order.  Great way to manage expectations, which I've seen done right in the past (i.e. At Fatty Crab) and not so right (i.e. ???).  Now to the food:  We shared the pretzel wrapped pork dumplings, the short rib soft tacos, the wings and waffles, the bacon pad Thai, tater tots and steamed chicken and lemongrass shumai.  I can't say enough about the food.  Each dish was better than the next, but I do have to say that the waffles and their syrup were so amazing that I was tempted to lick the plate.  The bacon Pad Thai was equally amazing.  The prices were more than reasonable based on other dim sum and tapas meals I have had the pleasure of enjoying.  And what is brunch without Bloody Mary's?  Their Bloody Mary's are to die for. They are super spicy and strong, but in a great way.  Get your butts to Talde asap.  Don't fear the wait...if you expect it and are able to keep yourself occupied with an ipad or smartphone, you won' t mind it at all.  The food makes it so worth it!",0,0,0,Jennifer A.,"West Orange, NJ",116,96,73

2.0,4/13/2012,"oh, talde, i really wanted to like you... but unfortunately, you didn't live up to my expectations.  perhaps it was my own fault for having lofted expectations.  i've never watched top chef, so i have no idea who dale talde even is.  but the reviews, including some from people whose opinions i respect...i was underwhelmed.very easy to get to from manhattan - F train to 7th ave (in brooklyn), 2 blocks, and voila...you're there.  and the restaurant has a great corner location with a fantastic bar.  we went early, like 630PM early, and there was no wait for a table of 3 (FYI: when we left around 830PM, they told a 2-top that the wait was an hour). if i hadn't been super hungover after a soju-filled korean dinner + karaoke the night before, i would've been all over cocktails at the bar pre-dinner.after our server gave us our menus and confirmed that this was our first time at talde, she came back about four seconds later and was like, ""are you ready to order???""  ummm, no...i've barely had time to say hello to my friends - do you really think we've had time to seriously discuss the menu?   since she seemed in a hurry to take our order, we spent some time with the menu... it was a no-brainer that we'd order the pretzel pork & chive dumpling, but the rest of the apps took some deciding... we settled on shrimp toast, octopus a la plancha, and hawaiian bread buns (filipino sausage, crispy long island fluke, market vegetable - which was shiitake mushroom).   and then we waited.  and waited.  and the server didn't come back.  when she finally did return about 15 minutes later, i was so hungry that i decided it was time for a cocktail (hair of the dog, right?).  i asked her if the 'king of siam' was sweet (i hate sweet drinks) and her response was ""no, it's really well-balanced.""  she lied.  i took one sip of that king of siam and couldnt take another.  and i am not one to leave a cocktail unfinished.onto the food...they tell you up front that everything is sorta family-style, and that things will just come out when they're ready... and i'm fine with that.  i'm korean - i'm a firm believer in family-style.  and i was super happy that the dumplings came out almost instantly.  the appetizers were strong - dumplings, tasty (love the mustard sauce with it)... octopus, decent... shrimp toast, weird with the poached egg and gravy, but still good.. hawaiian bread buns, all good (i even liked the fried fluke, even though it reminded judy &amp; viv of mcdonald's filet-o-fish...is that a bad thing? i think not.)  the guy who served the food was really chatty, describing each dish in detail - but it was as though i was the only one at the table... he spoke only to me. odd.it took us a while to sort out entrees, but we went with the whole market fish (i can't remember what kind of fish), which i think we mostly chose because it's served with mu shu pancakes - yum, fish tacos!, singapore chili soft shell crab banh mi, char siu smoked pork spare ribs, tai pan butter bread (which our server described as white bread meets texas toast meets the most delicious garlic bread ever), and 369 (market vegetables).and this is where the food went downhill.  the singapore chili crab banh mi didn't evoke any memories of delicious chili crab in singapore.  the boneless spare ribs reminded me of chinese-american takeout.  the whole fish was probably the best entree, but it was a touch bland...even with fried chilis stuffed inside. the 369 veggies were sugar snap peas coated in green sambal - the most flavorless rendition of sugar snap peas and sambal ever. and the butter bread... i've had better garlic bread at my local pizzeria.  such a disappointing carb intake.at some point during the meal, i couldn't help myself, and i ordered the crispy oyster & bacon pad thai to go (uhhh...for the husband!).  we had thought about getting it, but it didn't make the cut.  the husband and i shared this at home, and it was pretty good - very smoky bacon, yet somehow the dish was light.  and the fried oysters were delish (i ate them separately).  i might go back for apps & cocktails at the bar if i was in the neighborhood (but really, why would be i be in the neighborhood, unless i already had eating plans?), but this is definitely not a destination-worthy restaurant.  one other thing of note - dale talde's already opening another restaurant called 'pork slope'.  now that's clever.",0,0,0,Christine Y.,"Manhattan, NY",4,27,3

That being said, it came pretty damn close. My hubby and I came here around 6:30 PM on a Sunday night and were seated immediately. The waitress was not only friendly, but she was really informative. After listening to what I was looking for, she suggested a wine, and her suggestion was spot on. She also walked us through the entire menu. We opted for the dumplings to start. I told her I didn't like mustard, so she brought a different dipping sauce for me, which was amazing. The dumplings were crispy, without being overly greasy. The pork filling was so amazing that I would eat it on it's own in sausage form. Next we split the lobster coconut soup. It was huge, had big chunks of lobster and lots of corn, potato and noodles. This was spicy enough to make both of our eyes water, but delicious enough that we emptied the bowl. For our main dish, we split the BBQ smoked pork shoulder, which was served with some yummy cilantro watermelon. This meat was taken off the bone and was absolutely succulent. It had a rich smoky bbq flavor and literally melted in your mouth. I would definitely come back for this. As a side, we went for the sticky rice, which I'm sorry to say was not fabulous. It had a seriously strong seaweed flavor that I just couldn't get past. Finally, we decided to try their one and only dessert, which is a mixture of shaved ice, fruit, tapioca balls and captain crunch cereal??? Anyway, as you might have guess, this wasn't the greatest. At the end of the day, it just kind of turned into a big bowl of cereal. However, the tapioca balls were delish and would probably be enjoyable for lovers of bubble tea. Overall, I thought this place was great. The seats are a bit of a squeeze, and the foot comes out slowly, but in my opinion it's all just part of the experience.

3.0,4/3/2012,"I had the pleasure of sitting at the chef's table which is a nice aspect of the open kitchen design. The bar area by the way is beautifully decorated and the soundtrack of 90's hip hop was such a nice respite from the whitewashed 80's rock mix that I hear in every restaurant in NYC these days (thank you Dale for taking us back to old school Brooklyn!). Highlights of my meal were the Hawaiian bun trio (juicy, flavorful), and the shrimp toast with sausage gravy, which featured the most perfectly cooked sunny side egg I have ever had (kudos to the sous chef). Those two dishes were eye opening - the remainder of the dishes that we tried, while good, did not push the envelope in the way that you would expect from a daring chef like Dale Talde. The oft-cited Korean fried chicken was perfectly fried, yes, but the spicy kimchee sauce that accompanied it was nothing more than Frank's hot sauce. I was expecting a much more interesting combination, but this one lent it the air of buffalo chicken wings. Major letdown. The acclaimed bacon and oyster pad thai exhibited a nice smoky flavor that you don't usually find in pad thai, but the overly fragrant herbs that he added to the dish clashed with the bacon & oyster combo instead of enhancing it.  As for the halo halo dessert - the only interesting twist that sets it apart from the standard recipe was the addition of Captain Crunch - not exactly a culinary feat and frankly I thought the dish would have been better without it. Overall, I expected more refinement in the complexity of the flavors that were featured - instead what I got was a bit of a mish mosh of the kind that you expect from a more inexperienced chef. I would challenge Dale to go back and tweak the recipes and come back with something greater than what he's currently showcasing.

Talde, however, just didn't live up to the hype.The restaurant isn't bad. By all means, don't think we disliked it. As a non-pork eater (no one's problem, but my own), there were very few non-pork options. I had the korean fried chicken with the yogurt, grapes and mint. So, here's the thing- I thought the dish was good, but not good enough for a restaurant this hyped. Had this dish been in a more casual restaurant, that wasn't so expensive, this would have been great. The chicken, while flavorful, tasted like crispy buffalo chicken. Again, I expect more from an expensive restaurant with a top chef. My husband had the Pad Thai with crispy oysters and bacon. He liked it as well. The question is do you like fried chicken for $23? And do you like Pad Thai for $15? Perhaps the pad thai was slightly more reasonable, but the answer, at least for my money, is no. Also, the options are limited, in general. They should consider adding some more variety, and perhaps bringing the prices down a bit.

(We also got a small pitcher of their boozy punch to have with the meal, which went great with the food.) The food is served family-style, so plan on trying a bit of everythign that gets ordered. We started with the buns (1 of each) and the pork dumplings. All were excellent, but the veggie bun was a real surprise, since it was mainly mushroom but still full of flavor. The first of two entrees we split was the crispy oyster and bacon pad thai; it was a really nice pad thai that seemed to have a stronger emphasis on fish sauce as a flavoring than I've seen in other versions -- very good.The stand-out of the night though was the other entree we shared: the pork spare ribs -- it was one of those rare dishes where you and whoever you're eating with each take a bite, make eye contact, perhaps look a bit shocked, then nod knowingly while your eyes close and your brains' pleasure centers melt.

A bargain at $16.Fried Chicken - Wow. Moist with a crunchy shell - not a flaky dredge either but some kind of fried shell-unitard thing like you might see at a Chinese restaurant. Sauce a complete surprise, and delicious. Companion thought five-spice powder figured strongly.. other than that no clue except that we loved it. Halved grapes a bit of a tease since you'll definitely want that sweet palate cleanse, but they end up covered in the rich, salty sauce. Generous portion. Not cheap at $26.Side of rice with bacon in a leaf wrapper - A miss. A small amount of what tasted like shoyu rice and fatty bits for $7.Bottom line is this place is an experience, but it isn't quite a masterpiece and it isn't exactly a bargain either. Definitely try it!",2,1,1,Bret H.,"Brooklyn, NY",15,186,7

And yes, it did foreshadow how much I was going to spend!After patiently waiting for the hype to die down, my friends and I finally checked out Talde on a Wednesday evening. The wait was about half an hour for a party of 4, but it wasn't too bad, seeing that the bar had space and some awesome cocktails awaiting my taste buds.Being Filipino, I just HAD to order a pitcher of the appropriately named Pacquiao Punch. I'd like to describe it as ""the only Pacquiao punch I can handle"". Served in a small pitcher the same size as the glass you can pour it in, I thought to myself, ""Pshhh, I drink shit like that for breakfast!"" Priced at $16, I was pleasantly surprised* to find out it contained 4 drinks.On to the food - we ordered the Hawaiian pork sausage as appetizers - divine. My main entree was the Korean fried chicken, and while it was served with a twist (spicy yogurt sauce, grapes and mint) I still prefer the Bon Chon-style Korean fried chicken. My friend's short ribs were decent, but I believe the winner of the night went to the pad thai, adorned with bacon and fried oysters.Although I must admit I was slightly intoxicated** during my meal at Talde, I got a pretty good vibe from the place and I'd love to come back again***. ____________________________________________________*So pleasantly surprised that I killed an entire pitcher myself.**Because saying that I ate at the restaurant of a Top Chef contestant in the same state that I am when I stumble into Joe's Pizza of the Village at 3 AM is probably a sacrilege in some countries.***And preferably enjoy a meal, sober?",3,4,2,Michelle M.,Hong Kong,1492,1258,5888

3.0,3/11/2012,"Just had pretty good meal at Talde. At first I didn't know this was a new restaurant by a former Top Chef contestant, Dale Talde. I heard 'Bacon & Fried Oyster Pad Thai' and that was what got me excited. My friends and I stopped in on a saturday night without reservations - huge mistake. The wait was 2.5 hours long! We finally got in sunday night (with reservations, of course) and decided that we would go big and order virtually everything on the menu and family-style the meal. PLUM WINE BELLINI - a sweet & bubbly concoction made from Choya plum wine and proseccoPERILLA LEAF - Shiso leaf wraps topped with toasted shrimp, coconut, bacon-tamarind caramel and peanuts. So many complex flavors blowing my mind on that tiny little leaf. Amazing.OCTOPUS A LA PLANCA - Not too tough and grilled to perfection. PRETZEL PORK & CHIVE DUMPLINGS - Interesting combo of pretzel skin filled with typical pork dumpling filling - with a side of spicy mustard. It was a little too greasy and salty for my taste.WHOLE ROASTED BRANZINO - The Branzino was wrapped in banana leaf and roasted with a variety of herbs, turmeric and tomato. They give you a side of mini tortillas so you can make DIY fish tacos. Loved this dish.CRISPY OYSTER & BACON PAD THAI - I was so excited about this dish but ended up completely underwhelmed. It utilizes two of my favorite ingredients (bacon & oysters) but somehow it came out tasting like every other pad thai I've ever had... just greasier. It was disappointing.KOREAN FRIED CHICKEN - This dish is virtually half a chicken fried up Bon Chon style and covered with a spicy kimchee yogurt, blanched grapes and crushed mint. The crisp of the skin was perfect, the sauce was spicy enough, and surprisingly the grapes & mint worked with the dish. We had four people eating this and I ended up with the chicken breast. I hate white meat but I didn't hate this white meat.SHORTRIBS KARE-KARE - This was my favorite entree of the evening. Tender braised short ribs that fell apart at the touch of your fork. It was drenched in this rich, spicy coconut sauce and topped with coconut pieces, peanuts and pickled chilies. So dreamy. I only wish we had more, especially for the price.CAP'N CRUNCH HALO HALO - I would come back over and over again, just for this dessert. It's a traditional Halo-Halo with a twist. Talde makes shaved-ice with fresh coconut, mango, bananas, condensed milk, jackfruit and tapioca... but tops it all off with Cap'n Crunch! So freaking good.Food coma ensued.",1,0,0,Monica L.,"San Francisco, CA",72,98,78
5.0,3/10/2012,"My first culinary adventure into Park Slope was charming as could be. I caught wind of Talde via various foodie emails and decided upon an opportune evening to catch the F train out there. The commute was painless from the East Village and I didn't even mind the hour wait to get a table since the bar at the front of the restaurant was more than accommodating with tasty cocktails. Upon sitting down to dinner we had already seen and spoken with Dale Talde, the owner and Top Chef contestant. My favorite part of the meal was probably the beginning: we had a kale salad with golden beets and apples. I now have cravings for that salad on a regular basis! Other menu highlights were the ramen soup and the oyster pad thai. I read a mediocre review of the pad thai but I have lately taken to oysters and was drawn to the dish. I don't normally order pad thai and I honestly don't even normally enjoy it, but this particular combination of oysters, bacon and other yummies was quite pleasing. I have zero complaints about my meal at Talde and I cannot wait for an excuse to go back.",1,0,1,Mary Cecilia M.,"Manhattan, NY",31,75,4
3.0,3/9/2012,"This place is a welcome addition to the South Slope food scene. The food is fairly tasty, although probably a bit overpriced. It sort of straddles the line between fine dining & glorified cheap eats. This even goes for the decor, it's newly renovated with a nice bar, but there are cheap details like hard plastic plates. The pretzel pork & chive dumplings were good, but nothing better than a nice chinese restaurant. The Hawaiian bread buns are basically glorified-sliders, i wasn't particularly impressed. BBQ pork shoulder might have had one too many flavors & too much sauce. The side of black pepper toast was delicious, but banana leaf sticky rice was nothing special. I'm certainly celebrating having another food destination in south slope, but Talde didn't really blow me away. In my opinion, the quality of the menu wasn't worthy of the high prices. I may go back, there are a few other dishes (shrimp toast, korean fried chicken) which seem interesting.

5.0,3/7/2012,"Why Come Here? Fantastic and unique Asian-inspired food, casual setting, reasonable pricesI recently made the trip out to Talde with a group of six, which thankfully allowed us to make a reservation and skip the two hour waits. This is not to say Top Chef alum Dale Talde's food isn't worth waiting for. His Asian-inspired cooking is some of the best and most interesting food in New York right now. If I were to compare the food to anything, it would be Momofuku, but Talde definitely has it's own thing going. Prices are also reasonable, with only a few entrees coming in over $20. The space, which looks like it used to be an Irish Pub, is lively and fun, which perfectly compliments the food.My advice: Grab 5 friends, make a reservation and get to Park Slope before more critics do. If you don't have 5 friends, it's still worth braving the waits. And you'll be able to choose some excellent cocktails in the mean time (try the Navy Grog).Now onto the food. Since we were a group of six we were able to do quite a bit of damage to the menu. In the interest of space, I'm limiting the reviews below to my top picks. For all reviews and photos, check my DishEnvy page.Perilla Leaf   This one got mixed reviews at our table, but I think the flavor combination was really interesting. I can't place the taste of the leaf exactly, but it has a distinct southeast asian flavor to it.Pretzel Pork & Chive Dumplings Definitely a fun flavor combination of salty and tangy and unlike anything I've had before. I'd definitely recommend giving it a try.Hawiian Bread Buns w/ Filipino Pork Sausage & Crispy Long Island Fluke  There may be a new pork bun king in town. With all respect to David Chang, the garlicy mayo, pickled shallots and sweet buns make these the best I've had in NYC. The lighter fluke doesn't hold it's own with the bold flavors quite as well.Korean Fried Chicken  The spicy yogurt-kimchee is one of the best sauces I've ever had. It adds just the right kick to the perfectly cooked, moist fried chicken. Then the grapes come in and negate some of the spice. Incredible.Halo-Halo  Dale Talde doesn't do desserts, except this one which really evokes a kids breakfast. And it really does taste like a cold bowl of captain crunch mixed with fruit loops. It's probably more interesting than delicious, but you should try it anyway.",0,0,0,Jay Z.,"Manhattan, NY",156,126,0
3.0,3/7/2012,"I don't watch Top Chef and didn't know anything about the chef who opened Talde. The only thing I know was that the place was always packed and if you walk in by 7pm on a weekend, it's an hour and half wait. Anyway, I finally had dinner there on a Tuesday night at 6pm and there was no wait and service was good. If you're wondering why I gave only 3 stars, that's because I'm purely rating the food alone. And to me, the food was just okay.  This is what I tried so far...Pretzel pork chive dumplings - which seemed a bit hard to me. The filling was good but the skin was just too hard and tough for my taste. If I bought a pretzel and it was this hard, I would think it was left in the over for too long and got a little burnt. Hawaiian mini buns - tried all 3 flavors they offered. These were by far the only thing I thought was good about my dinner. I actually like the Fluke the best out of the shittake and sausage. Braised short ribs - the meat was soft but a little bland to the taste. For me, the taste of the coconut milk wasn't really flavorful. I can smell it in the dish but once it's in my mouth, all I taste is just spicy heat.Korean Fried Chicken - the breading was good and crispy but again, overall blandness to the dish except for spicy heat as a kick. It's far from being anywhere near Bon Chon goodness. Halo Halo dessert - only dessert they have and we ordered it because my husband has never had it before. He loves sweet so he enjoyed the dessert very much. It was a little overly too sweet for me, but then again, I'm not a big dessert person so I can't judge this dish.So overall, I thought the food was just okay because all I tasted was just hot/spicy throughout all the dishes. I've had spicy dishes before where there are also other flavors involved and not just heat, heat and more heat.

5.0,3/6/2012,"Ok I didn't know this was a new restaurant by a former Top Chef contestant. All I knew is that I kept walking by the new building after it opened and it was packed every night with customers.So one night (tonight) I dragged a friend here. We were celebrating being away from work and still in the work attire (which scored us a free drink from chef Talde).  Here's the lowdown:Hawaiian bread buns - mini sliders with a choice of vegetarian (shiitake that night), pork sausage, or flute. I recommend the shittake and flute. They're sweet with a dash of pickled radish and something spicy that kicks it up a notch.Pork dumplings are genius. They're somehow a pretzel dumpling hybrid and great with the mustard.Korean fried chicken - always a fan and chef makes it just as crispy as bonchon with spicy kimchi yogurt sauce (not spicy enough for a Korean) and halved grapes.Banana leaf sticky rice - a classic and tastes just like it should.369 - the vegetable special was Brussel sprouts which I have a new found love for. These were good but a little too charred for my liking. Still I ate all of it like a pro eating champion.Shaved ice dessert - I forgot what they called this Philippine inspired dessert but it's very similar to the Korean version (poppingsu). A bed of shaved ice with multiflavored tapioca pearls (boba), lychee jelly cubes and multiflavored jelly slices, cap'n crunch, and bananas pineapples and mango pieces. Drenched in coconut and lemongrass? Juice. Loves. Will create third and fourth stomach for this.If you're a daredevil try this 'Asian fusion'.

The space is big, the ceilings are high, there's a great vibe that isn't overwhelming and a warmth to it all.  One of the highlights of any restaurant are servers who are attentive, knowledgable, excited about the product and know what they are serving.  BINGO!  Right on the money.  Our waiter was not only totally schooled on the menu but seemed really stoke to talk about it, BUT, not in an annoying way like so many restaurants that take themselves way too seriously in NY.  This guy was just interested, spot on and helpful.  Smart! He led us through helpful descriptions of an eclectic, wonderful menu and made it easier for us to decide.I know, what about the food,.  We started off with three buns/sliders that were simply FANTASTIC.  One was fluke, one was pork and one was I believe shitake mushroom, but perfectly prepared and combined with flavorings and sauces that explode out of the buns.  My wife and I said we could have eaten 3 orders of them they were so good!As entrees we had fluke and pork shoulder.  The fluke was lightly prepared, I believe pan seared with some fresh herbs, a delicate sauce accompanied by some beans.  What was so amazing was how hard it is for so many chefs not to overdue the sauces.  The chef hear hit it out of the park with delicate flavors, great accompaniment, FRESH herbs and let the fish really shine through everything.  We also had a pork shoulder dish that again was simply prepared but served with slices of pear that had been most likey soaked and seasoned and really added to the flavor of the pork shoulder. Pork shoulder is soft, but meaty, fatty, but juicy and again the chef let the flavors shine through.  Simply great.To polish off the meal we had the chef's version of halo-halo, a Filipino desert.  This version comes with shaved ice, probably some condensed milk and a slecetion of different fruits like banana, jack fruits, mango and they crazily topped it with ...Captain Crunch.  Fun, fun, fun.

Suffice it to say, the place is really popular and generally serves great & unique food that you won't find anywhere else in PS.We got there at 6pm mid-week and there were a handful of empty tables. By 6:20, they were all full, and by the time we left, there was easily an hour-plus wait.We went a little overboard on food, but being that it was our 1st time there, I wanted to try some of the more popular dishes.Appetizers (best to worst)Hawaiian Buns - fan-friggin-tastic. We got 1 of each bun (pork, mushroom, fish). The mushroom was was OK/good, but the other two were great. This will definitely be had again next time we're back.Pork/Chive Dumplings - very flavorful, even though it was a bit salty. Went great with the miso-like mustard.Perilla leafs - I liked them, the wife did not. An assortment of flavors all trying to outdo each otherSaigon Crepe - it was OK but just too difficult to eat... It basically fell apart once you took a bite. Won't be ordering again.Entrees - We got the Bacon/Oyster Pad Thai & the Shortrib. The wife didn't care too much for the Pad Thai but I thought both were fantastic. The shortib was reeeeeeealllly tender and tasty great. I wish there was more curry with it, but I enjoyed what was there.All in all, it was a great meal. A bit pricey, but certainly worth it. I'm glad we didn't have to wait for a table, but I certainly would, even if it takes over an hour.We'll be back here, for sure.",0,0,0,nitin a.,"Bellmore, NY",5,19,0

4.0,2/27/2012,"I'd eat hundreds of Hawaiian buns if you put them in front of me. Each option, the crispy fluke, the Filipino pork sausage and the mushrooms (that day's market vegetable) was balanced and bursting with flavor. The pickled shallots cut into the fatty garlic mayo, and the mini rolls, if not potato bread, were equally as awesome. I want to eat these magnificent minis at every meal, and they are all I've thought about since stuffing them into my face.Oh yeah, Talde also serves other food too. And it's pretty damn good. Our lovely waitress recommended that we start with the Perilla Leaf, a toasted shrimp, coconut, bacon-tamarind caramel, peanut combination that she said encompassed the flavors that Talde is all about. After that introduction, how could we pass them up? The leaves were an interesting bite, to be sure, but I would do things differently. (I've seen Top Chef. That makes me qualified to comment on how they run their restaurant, right? Didn't think so.) The $5 order comes with five leaves, and with only two people it doesn't make much sense. If you truly want everyone to taste this combination, why not offer it as an amuse bouche, or if that's impossible, $1 per Perilla leaf so folks could just order one per person? One man's unsolicited opinion.Like another? I thought the pretzel dumplings, while tasty and thoughtfully paired with sinus-clearing mustard, were the least memorable dish of the evening.In addition to the aforementioned appetizers, we decided to share the Korean Fried Chicken. Excellently executed, it's sliced white meat chicken with the crispiest skin imaginable, laid atop a spicy kimchi yogurt sauce that is vaguely reminiscent of Buffalo. The latter pairs wonderfully with the meat, and sliced grapes provide a welcome sweet note.We also got the Crispy Oyster & Bacon Pad Thai (as it was our first visit to Talde, we over-ordered like whoa). I, for one, think that pad thai is the blandest, most uninteresting thing to get at a Thai joint...but this dish is delicious. In the words of my date: ""It's salty and bacony. No wonder you like it."" The verdict after one visit? Talde is tasty. The service is attentive, and the casual but quality vibe is extremely welcome in the area. I'm looking forward to coming back and working my way through the whole menu. This might be difficult, as already the place is packed (with babies, if you arrive early -- it is the Slope, after all) every night. I might just have to sit at the bar; they don't offer full dining, but a Kelso Nut Brown and Hawaiian buns are all I need to get by.",21,10,15,Peter D.,"Brooklyn, NY",4675,3021,10459
5.0,2/26/2012,"My boyfriend and I are huge fans of Top Chef in general and Dale was one of our favorite contestants so naturally we were jumping with glee when he decided to open a restaurant in our very own NYC. While Brooklyn is inconvenient, Talde fits the vibe perfectly. It's laid back, hip, and there seems to be more room for culinary experimentation. I am so happy to say that we had one of the best meals to date at Talde. Brooklyn is out there but it's a mere 2-3 blocks away from the F train and definitely not as far as I expected. The stinky part is the wait - you will wait. Unless you come at odd hours, expect to grab a drink (or two) at the bar and enjoy your dining companion's company. The drinks are pretty strong and delicious though so you won't be sad for too long :)My bf and I ordered the pretzel chive and pork dumplings and Hawaiian buns as starters - highly recommended. My boyfriend inhaled the buns and wanted to order it a second time.We also received the Perilla Leaf and if there is one dish that stands out the most on that menu, it's the Perilla Leaf. I don't think everyone will love it but it is original, creative, and with one bite, you are transported to southeast Asia. My favorite dish on the menu, hands down. For the entrees, we ordered the Korean Fried Chicken and the Long Island Fluke with a side of brussel sprouts and banana sticky rice. EVERYTHING was AMAZING. I can not describe how great each dish was executed. There were 3 pieces of rice left and I actually stuck my chopsticks to clean up those pieces as the waiter was picking it up from our table. I know, I'm embarrassing to be around. Of course we had to complete such a great meal with the halo halo. I've never liked halo halo but this great! There was so much going on, and every bite was a surprise. All the flavors were familiar and my bf and I kept playing to guessing game until we nailed down what the ingredients were. All-in-all, an delicious meal and enjoyable experience. Not only did we get to see and meet Dale, we had the great honor of getting a taste of his dishes. A must go for sure!",1,0,1,Salina H.,"New York, NY",27,122,0
4.0,2/26/2012,"Being a Top Chef fan makes you do some crazy things. Like spend 45 minutes on the F train - only to wait for another 80 minutes to be seated. No hard feelings, Dale. It was completely worth it! I think I may have discovered my new favorite soup EVER. If you only order one dish here, make sure it's the Lobster Tom Kha Gai. The dish is an absolute dream. Delicate rice noodles swimming in a lobster infused coconut milk broth. The dish is topped with lobster and corn, which is the perfect complement to the noodles. I also thoroughly enjoyed the Crispy Oyster & Bacon Pad Thai. The fried oysters on top of the pad thai was a great touch. The Whole Market Fish was reminiscent of my mom's cooking - although I will have to say my mom's turmeric tomato sauce still takes the cake. Do not be intimidated by the whole fish! Talde makes it customer friendly by deboning the fish for you. The drinks at Talde are solid. I really enjoyed the Plum Wine Bellini and the Lychee Martini. While waiting to be seated, Brian M. and I split the Perilla Leaves and the Pretzel Pork & Chive Dumplings. The Perilla Leaves are definitely interesting. Each leaf is a small aromatic bite that really leaves you intrigued. My favorite little ingredient atop the leaf is the dried shrimp. Yum! The dumplings are pretty standard, but a good appetizer to share if you need something to hold you over while waiting to be seated.  If ever given the option to sit in a spot where I can watch chefs work their magic in the kitchen, I take it. It was so exciting watching the whole team hard at work, bringing Dale's creativity to fruition. The buzz in the room is enthralling. You can really feel how appreciative every customer is for the delicious plates in front of them. I am so pleased to see Dale's restaurant doing so well. I can only hope he expands into Manhattan one day...but until then, I will make the trek to get my hands on that heavenly Lobster Tom Kha Gai!",3,1,1,Nancy D.,"New York, NY",321,343,75
5.0,2/23/2012,"My neighborhood cries out for an ambitious restaurant  with flavors and influences from Asia (southeastern in general). Although we're lucky enough to have Talde in Park Slope, it would be a great restaurant anywhere in the city.  Perilla Leaf - excellent, spicy, bitter, aromatic, sweet, salty, altogether in one biteSaigon Crepe - very good, crispy texture, again very nice broad spectrum of flavors typical to southeast asiaWonton Noodle Soup - excellent, comforting, unctuous, 2 kinds of pork (wonton and smoked), crunchy broccoli rabe, and a rich gooey 6 minute eggShortribs Kare Kare - very good, the meat was well cooked, again a broad array of flavors, nutty, only small complaint is I wish there was more sauceBrussel Sprouts - excellent, wok stir-fried, smoky, crunchy Black Pepper Butter Toast - very good, soft, tasty vehicle for transporting the kare kare sauce to my mouthHalo Halo - with Cap'n Crunch cereal, the only dessert choice, i'm just not a fan of halo halo in generalAtmosphere was a bit crowded and loud.

4.0,2/23/2012,"The best way to experience this restaurant is to share dishes with 4+ people. I recently went with 3 other people and we ordered a varied of dishes to share. We started with the octopus - which was the crowd favorite We, also, had the Wonton soup (large enough for 4), the shrimp toast and the pork dumplings. For the entrees we ordered the fried oyster bacon pad thai - so yummy!, the Korean Fried Chicken, the whole fish (which was surprisingly tasty and not dry) and the spare ribs. The plum wine bellini makes a perfect compliment.The only negative is the long wait - about 2 hours.

4.0,2/21/2012,"First off-- expect a wait. Party of two (waited around 1 hour) arrival time 6:30PM The staff was great, very friendly- the hostesses were alert and on point, not needing to be reminded of people's names which made things run smoothly. The upside to the wait was the bar where you can order appetizers off of the main menu and enjoy a drink or two while you wait for your table.Reasonably priced drinks $5-7 beers, $10+ cocktails. Standard nyc prices. @ the bar we ordered: Perilla leaf appetizer- which were not so exciting in terms of presentation and size but had a definite kick with the tamarind sauce  Grilled Octopus appetizer- perfectly cooked not chewy at all and good amount of flavoring with this tahini mustard sauce and potatoesWe ended up sitting at the chef's table right in front of the cooking area where we ordered: Saigon crepe appetizer- my FAVE! crispy and delicious, piping hot and perfect shrimp to bacon ratio. You could really taste the bacon grilled flavor. Kare kare: perfectly tender braised short ribs, the sauce was a little weak in terms of portion and taste but it had a delicious crunchy coconut and peanut topping. (PS no rice with this dish just an FYI)Crispy oyster pad thai: noodles were PERFECTLY COOKED throughout the meal it maintained that ideal chewiness without being too chewy and never soft or overcooked. The oysters were underwhelming- fried in tasteless batter and once you bit into it the oyster was piping hot but also tasteless. The noodles and the smokiness of the chinese bacon made up for it thoughhalo halo: traditional shaved ice with mango, bananas, milk, gelatin, and captain crunch- DELISH.Pros: the diversity in menu options, quick service, great staff, got a picture with Dale who walks around throughout the night :)Cons: long wait",1,0,0,Elizabeth L.,"West Caldwell, NJ",104,111,124
4.0,2/20/2012,"Being a huge fan of Top Chef, I was very excited to try Dale Talde's new restaurant. At the same time, I didn't want to get my hopes up to high. Asian fusion restaurants usually don't do it for me. I'm glad to say that everything I had was delicious and unique. Great job Dale!So here is what we got:- Perilla leaf - I'm actually not a big fan of those tiny dried shrimp in Chinese cooking. The flavor is a bit strong and sharp, but the addition of mint and peanuts did turn down the shrimp and made the dish pretty decent. These served as an amuse-like start to the meal.- Hawaiian bread sliders with pork sausage - Oh my goodness, my tastebuds jumped for joy! I love the soft, sweet Hawaiian bread, the sausage was moist and flavorful, and the sauce was delectable. I could have had a whole meal of these.- 369 vegetables - They were roasted brussel sprouts. So simple, yet might have been one of my favorite dishes. I didn't even know I liked brussel sprouts.- Whole market fish - A whole branzino deboned and wrapped in a banana leaf and grilled. There was a heaping, steamy pile of tomato, dill, and various other herbs as well. Amazing! Please get this... not only a dramatic presentation but a very very well done dish.- Fried oyster and Bacon Pad Thai - This was a great dish as well. The smokiness of the bacon paired well with the oyster and actually complemented the acidic pad thai well. Unfortunately there was a really spicy chili in it that roasted my taste buds and gave me indigestion afterwards. This kind of made me unhappy.- Short rib kare-kare - The sauce was great, and the black pepper butter toast was perfect to dip in it (although they were very good by themselves... seriously... toast with butter and black pepper? so good). The short rib was a bit dry and overcooked but still a pretty decent dish.Overall Talde met and surpassed my expectations. I definitely enjoyed myself.",2,0,0,Brian C.,"Los Angeles, CA",642,474,0
5.0,2/20/2012,"I was apprehensive about Talde, not wanting to get my hopes up too high.  Would the food be up to expectations?  Would I be priced out of the customer base or lost in a shadowy world of endless reservations?  After my first time here, I'm happy to say this is a place that has the whole package: I'd be happy to come back to on a date, with my parents, for a birthday dinner, or maybe just every week for the rest of time.Dinner starts at 5, and I get the feeling people must come and wait outside before then.  They only do reservations for parties of 6 or more, so be prepared to wait for a while (though the egalitarian quality they're going for with this policy works).  I came in a party of 3 at 5:30, and waited at the bar for about an hour before a table was ready.  As others have mentioned, this was exactly the amount of time that the host told us we'd be waiting, so good job by him.  As long as you're aware that an hour-plus bar trip will be part of your dinner, it's really a positive.  The bartenders are friendly and helpful, and the time passes quickly over conversation and delicious cocktails.We had the pretzel dumplings, tofu salad, pad thai, and fried chicken.  All 4 were awesome.  One of party has celiac, and both the bartenders and waitstaff were spot-on with their knowledge of which items she could have.  To our delight, almost half the menu is gluten-free, including the fried chicken!  Our waitress took very good care of us, checking in exactly the right amount.Looking over some of the past reviews, I get the sense that Talde has really tightened up on some aspects that may not have been perfect when it opened.  The service was attentive, informative, and friendly.  I thought the dumplings were delicious, and using the spicy mustard vs. the chili-garlic vinegar transforms the dish.The kitchen is open to the dining room, and yes, you can see Dale killing it in there.  But even if you couldn't, his concept design concept shines all the way through.  In between fine dining and neighborhood hangout, food that is comfortably Asian-American while avoiding the pretension of Asian fusion, I see now that there was no reason for me to be worried about this place.  Today's Monday... sounds like a good occasion for Talde.",2,0,0,Luke Y.,"Singapore, Singapore",151,242,50
4.0,2/20/2012,"Talde's website describes itself as a a casual Asian American restaurant and bar.  I think that's a good way to describe the food--Asian American--as opposed to Asian fusion.  I actually didn't have high expectations coming into Talde (though I was a fan of Dale on Top Chef) because I generally don't like Asian fusion.  I usually feel like if I want Asian food, I'll just get ASIAN food, you know, done by people who know how to do it well (minus ridiculous prices).  But Talde is not really Asian fusion, or to the extent that it is (there are certainly non-Asian elements in the dishes, such as bacon Pad Thai), the food here is really closer to the Asian end of the spectrum.Overall, great food, great service.  Here's a list of what I tasted, in order of preference (I've starred the ones I would get again):1. ***Whole market fish.  The bronzini was cooked perfectly with tomato jam, wrapped in a banana leaf and grilled, and served with mu shu pancakes.  My favorite dish of the night.  2. ***Hawaiian bread buns with Filipino pork sausage.  Had this to start off the night and it was superb!  Slightly sweet, extremely moist.  A close second to the fish.  3. ***Stir-fried market vegetables (brussel sprouts).  Yes, one of my favorite dishes of the night was veggies.  It's hard to describe, but the brussel sprouts were really good.  I was picking at it throughout the entire meal. 4. ***Saigon crepes.  Shrimp and Chinese bacon served with a tangy sauce.  Pretty good dish to nibble on, and the actual crepe part was crunchy and delicious.5. ***Black pepper butter toast.  It's a simple Chinese style butter toast topped with black pepper.  Nothing fancy, but if you love Chinese butter toast, this is a good dish for you.  And if you haven't had Chinese butter toast, give it a try!  It's simple but good.6. Perilla leaf.  This concoction has all sorts of good things going on--dried shrimp, bacon, mint, peanuts.  It's an explosion of flavors in your mouth, but just so you know, isn't going to fill you up.  Try it for the flavors, not to satisfy hunger. 7. Bacon pad thai.  Hard to dislike anything with bacon in it, but this was not one of the better dishes (though others at the table certainly liked this the best).  I think I missed the tanginess that comes with more traditional Pad Thai.  This was on the more fusion-y end.  8. Short ribs kare-kare.  I was disappointed with this dish because although I liked the  curry sauce, the short ribs were not that tender.",1,0,0,Ray L.,"Alameda, CA",70,166,3

Pulled pork was the special and did not disappoint. The rest of the evening was better than average but not worth the hype. Plenty to share with entrees.

3.0,2/17/2012,"Not a Top Chef fan at all and wouldn't recognize the chef if he slapped me, BUT very excited for an Asian-fusion option in Park Slope and the menu sounded intriguing.Four of us arrived before 7PM on a Monday night and lucked out: only a 30-minute wait AND there were four stools free at the bar.  My ""bellini"" with plum wine and prosecco was very generously poured.  Unfortunately, the bartender that night had attitude.  Asked about a drink on the cocktail menu, he  rolled his eyes and sighed ""it's fruit punch"".  He was equally unhelpful when someone else described a beer he'd had at the bar a couple of days before, and the bartender replied, ""that's not really helping me.""  No attempt to describe what was on draft or otherwise help a customer make a decision.   Kind of surprising, since we've been served by this bartender before at Thistle Hill and he's not usually an ass.  Not the most pleasant way to spend 30 minutes, looking across the bar at a surly guy who'd obviously rather be elsewhere.We were seated after exactly 30 minutes (kudos, front of house).  Our waitperson gave the hard sell on the perilla leaf appetizer and told us a couple of times that the food was served family style.  When we ordered entrees, her rap was (almost verbatim) ""we serve family style, so you should each eat everything that comes or else someone might wait a while for their entree since they won't all come at the same time.""   Family style or no, that's just an excuse for the kitchen that's not well organized.  Not impressive.OK, so the food!Appetizers:Perilla leaf - five tiny leaves with dabs of sauces, would be presented as an amuse bouche at most restaurants instead of a $5 app.  These were the most flavorful thing we ate all night - salty, sweet, spicy, crunchy all at the same time.Pretzel pork and chive dumplings - overcooked, almost burnt.  The filling was OK, not much different from any Chinese takeout pork dumpling, and the so-called ""spicy"" mustard was not.Hawaiian bread buns - yum, sliders!   Good bread, nicely hot fillings, not overly seasoned but tasty nonetheless.Shrimp toast - urk.  Overcooked egg, lumpy lukewarm gravy. Entrees:Fluke - picky Spouse raved about this.  It was steaming hot, beautifully presented and nicely seasoned.  Winner.Pork shoulder - described on the menu as BBQ and smoked but neither was in evidence.  A good, tender piece of braised meat but not much taste.  The 'miso mustard' tasted of neither, merely a mild sauce of indeterminate origin.Short ribs - another winner.  Well seasoned and melt-in-the-mouth tender.Shrimp fried rice - don't bother.  White rice with a few baby shrimp and egg bits scattered throughout.369 - that night it was stir-fried broccoli rabe and...edamame?  Good with a little garlic bite.Dessert:The server told us the dessert that night was the shaved ice thingie with Captain Crunch and candied lychee (which was canned, not candied, as far as I could tell).  Unmitigated DISASTER of a dessert.  Almost flavorless melting shaved ice, unpleasant sliminess of canned lychee, soggy cereal, scattered nuts (I think sunflower seeds?) and a truly nasty bright green chewy gel that tasted like fibrous Jell-o.  We each had a spoonful and left the rest to melt.  When the server cleared it away, she mentioned, oh yeah, they also had Sweet Melissa apple pie that night but dessert was in transition since they hadn't yet hired a pastry chef.  REALLY.  Never woulda guessed THAT.Overall, some real ups and downs.  I'm interested to give this place another try and see if the service improves and the food gains a little more spice and flavoring.",2,0,0,Emmeline C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,66,0
2.0,2/17/2012,"I was very excited to have dinner at Talde but had over a 2 hour wait on a Saturday, despite arriving at 6:15.  Tried again Tuesday and was seated in about 30 minutes.  The decorations of the bar and restaurant are first class, way better than the competition in Park Slope.  The whiskey selection is excellent.  I enjoyed an 18 year old Yamazaki scotch while waiting.  Bartender was friendly.All downhill from there.We had the Parilla leaf appetizer. Delicious, but SO tiny.  Really unbelievable how small it was.  Then enjoyed the lobster soup, kind of spicy Thai style soup.  Very good, but similar taste to what you'd get in a cheap Thai restaurant.For dinner we shared a short rib and side of sticky rice.  The short rib was really beautiful, but too dry.  The sticky rice just wasn't sticky.  We enjoy way better sticky rice at home (home made) and in Dim Sum restaurants.For dessert there was only one offering, which we did not order.  Some friends who ate there the same night loved it (shaved ice with captain crunch cereal and other stuff).My biggest gripe is that the plates and silverware are really cheap and below grade for eating.  Local chinese restaurants serve on nicer plates.  Talde went with kitchy colorful plastic plates that look interesting, but I felt like I was in a really cheap place.  Same with the silverware.  Anyone who pays for fancy food, small portions, and waits for a table deserves better.",1,0,0,stephen b.,"Brooklyn, NY",58,14,0

4.0,2/15/2012,"As a restaurant in Park Slope, this is one of the better restaurants in terms of their dishes. I'm a picky eater where I refuse to dine out and eat medicore food, so I was happy to hear about this place.Yes, Dale Talde was there managing the kitchen and plating all the dishes. Though I was not surprised, there was a Valentine fixed prix meal that night. It was unfortunately not communicated on their website and when people made reservations. For the people sitting around me, all were pretty surprised that there was no a la carte that night. One table even left after finding out it was only fixed prix. Lesson learned by the restaurant and by people who know now to ask before making valentine's day reservations.The food was spectacular and it made the whole experience so much better. The fixed prix meal had a few things that were from the a la carte menu and some that didn't.  - The perilla leaf was portioned well and had a nice kick from the pepper and crunch from the cashews.- The shaken lamb salad was to die for with well marinated medium rare lamb with a nice kick from the peppers over a bed of basil and cilantro.- Hamachi appetizer was good but too much mayo was used in the sauce. Unfortunately the menu didn't tell people it was raw. The woman , who was pregnant, found out too late when they put the plate in front of her....oopps- Black Bean Brown Butter Lobster - Too bad they don't have this on the a la carte menu! I'm sure it would be a hit. the dish reminds me of how my dad and uncle cooks lobster the authentic asian way...MMMMM- Pepper Sirlion and Kare-Kare Short Rib - Good cuts of meat are used but i was not a fan of the curry curry sauce. Dessert was:- Shaved Ice Sundae (aka Halo Halo a philipino dish with an american twist) - I did like the dish as it had fresh coconut and captain crunch as a topping. Not a fan of the canned lychees that were used. It also had a nice kick of heat maybe from white pepper ?- Ganache Tart - I took one bite and stopped eating it. It reminded me of a fiber 1 snack bar ... which not bad, was not the consistency i was expecting.In terms of service, the servers were attentive, perhaps, a little too much. I got a sense I was rushed. For example, on of the waiters wanted to take my boyfriend's dish while he still had some food left. For example, I had a tail of lobster and they came and asked if I was still working on it. I had to them them we were still working on it. I can probably count two hands in terms of the number of times I was telling them I was still working on my plate.  Very frustrating. You can also tell if they were rushing because I was still halfway through my appetizer when they delivered the entrees , which I thought was weird. The restaurant still has a few to learn about service and not rushing its customers, but the food makes it all better and want to come back to see if anything improves. Also their cocktails are boozy which was great! A great addition to the neighborhood.",1,0,0,Hong L.,"Brooklyn, NY",317,656,218

3.0,2/12/2012,"I was really excited to try Talde.  I trekked from Hoboken to Brooklyn on a Sunday night to go to the much buzzed about restaurant from Top Chef alum Dale Talde (I am fan of his particularly since he got his temper in check by All Stars).  So possibly my high expections are leading me to rate this a 3 vs 4 star.  If I lived in Brooklyn, I'd probably lean more towards the 4 star mark but an hour trip coupled with hour wait led me feeling a little eh about this place.  Don't get me wrong, the food is generally very good, but the overall atmosphere coupled with the wait and location make this worthy of a one off visit versus a destination restaurant for me.After reviewing the current comments, I decided to try some of the most well-received dishes:PRETZEL PORK & CHIVE DUMPLINGS-I suppose I can understand why people are going gaga over this, it's basically a delicious pork and chive dumpling with really crunchy, crusty and salty dumpling skin served with hot mustard.  It probably appeals to people's junk food junkie type of cravings but I was the most disappointed in this dish.  The interior dumpling was delicious (although not too different from a pork and chive you'd find in any restaurant in Chinatown) but I hated the crispy skin.  It was too hard and crusty on the roof of your mouth and it was like a salt lick with the coating.  I much prefer the classic dumpling.SAIGON CREPES-This was delicious.  I liked the smokiness of the Chinese bacon and shrimp but it also had a light, fresh feel to it with the lightweight crepe and fresh herbs.HEIRLOOM SQUASH & SILKEN TOFU-They should really call this kale salad, that is the predominant ingredient in this salad.  I love kale and this has a mix of regular kale and tempura fried kale and there was some nice textures and tangy flavors with the apples and dressing and sweetness of the beets.  I thought this dish was certainly tasy but it wasn't quite exceptional.  It's hard for a salad to blow someone away.CRISPY OYSTER & BACON PAD THAI-This was another favorite dish of mine.  I guess it's that damn bacon.  I like the fried oysters and the flavors in this pad thai.BBQ SMOKED PORK SHOULDER-I was hoping this shoulder would be more fork tender but it was more like a slightly overcooked pork chop.  It was a little dry and at times I got what I believe was a strong essenece of fennel which isn't my favorite flavor.  This dish comes out extremely simply, just a hunk of shoulder and some julianned pear strips on top.  This was disappointing, I should have gone with the Korean fried chicken instead.All in the all, the food was good but there were only 2 standouts and the same number of disappointments for me so it ends up being a wash.  If I lived in Brooklyn, I'd give it another shot but as it stands, I don't feel it's worth another trip to Park Slope!Also, the decor was weird to me.  It reminded me of an Asian British pub, it felt confused.  Also the hand soap in the bathroom was the really harsh, smelly antibacterial sort that lingers on your hands through 3 subsequent washes which automatically conjures up school bathroom images for me..",3,1,1,Lisa W.,"Hoboken, NJ",141,211,0
5.0,2/12/2012,"Came here on a Saturday around 5:30 and there was an hour wait. My parents and I opted to wait and get a drink at the bar. Two stoli and club sodas & a lychee martini - I think those were the only things that weren't amazing.We sat about an hour later and had a very nice waitress who told us all the meals were served family style and the specials. We looked at the menu for a few minutes and decided to start with the: Perilla Leaf, Pretzel Pork & Chive Dumplings and Octopus with potatoes.The dumplings came out first, they were crispy and had an air of pretzel in the dough, the inside was juicy and perfectly cooked. I preferred them without the spicy mustard. The Octopus with potatoes was delightful, the octopus was hot and flavorful (a little hint of spice) and the potatoes were cold and they mixed together great. Lastly, I ate the Perilla Leaf. My Dad and I had the same thoughts- we had never tasted anything like it before, the girl said that it was a leaf with all the overarching flavors he used in the restaurant. It was great.Then the entrees came, first the crispy oyster & bacon pad thai- I wasn't sure what to expect, but the extra flavor from the bacon and oysters really changed the overall taste of the pad thai (in a good way) I added a little hot sauce and it was awesome. Then the Korean fried chicken came out. The outside was crunchy and spicy and the middle was juicy and succulent. Lastly, the Long Island fluke came out, it was cooked in brown bean butter and cilantro. Again, it was perfectly cooked and full of flavor. All three were great.We opted to get the halo halo for dessert- it sounded a bit weird at first, captain crunch with coconut milk and fruit. It also tasted strange at first, but then after two or three bites it was delicious. It completely cleaned my pallet and the three of us were scraping the plate for more...

A group of four of us came to dine here on Sunday night. We waited patiently at the bar sipping our cocktails until a small group of cool people left and made room for us in the cramped back quarters. Please note: it is cramped back there and you ought to be skinny or anorexic to sit comfortably, with out having to reorganize to let people through. I guess the owner was doing the rounds and he seemed like a pretty nice guy.The Food: We started with the signature perilla leafs that are very tasty, but very pricey at 5 bucks a leaf. We worked our way through the menu and the fluke sliders were delicious.  Fried chicken comes with a batter so thick, that is takes away from the chicken. You can get better fried chicken else where in the slope for less than $23.  My friend had a vegetarian ramen offered on the menu, which contained a great variety of vegetables but some how she found it overwhelming with MSG, complaining of a numb tongue after consumption.

And the menu's obsession with all things porky was a little obnoxious. I think sticking bacon in everything is a ploy chefs use to trick unadventurous eaters into thinking they're real snout-to-tail foodies--it's also a real ""fuck you"" to vegetarians.  Shrimp fried rice was greasy and tasteless.

I truly appreciated the glass of complimentary prosecco they offered, a thoughtful touch for a woman dining alone. I brought my iPad to read, but the dynamic kitchen ended up providing all of the entertainment I needed for the evening. The staff checked up on me frequently enough to feel taken care of, but not so frequently as to become obtrusive. Even the busy back of the house, including chef Dale, checking in on me. I started with the delicious pretzel dumplings with spicy mustard dipping sauce. They were crispy, salty (in a good way), and fabulous. For my main course, I had the Korean fried chicken. The double fried coating was perfectly crispy, while the meat remained moist. The sauce was a bit spicy (reminiscent of a slightly vinegary wing sauce), but countered nicely by the sweetness of the grapes. On my previous visit, I had the Hawaiian bread buns, a trio of sliders. The pork sausage and market vegetable were delightful, while the fluke was unfortunately a tad dry. Luckily, you can specify which 3 buns you would like, so I will probably forgo the fluke next time around. I also tried the squash and silken tofu salad, and I just have to say that fried kale=amazing! I also had the oyster pad Thai, which was also quite good. I recommend squeezing the provided lime wedge generously onto the dish, as the acidity amps up the flavor nicely.I look forward to trying many of the other menu items on my future visits. I'm particularly intrigued by the perilla leaf, which looks like a lettuce wrap zapped with a shrink ray. I figure that it must pack a flavor punch. As you can tell, I obviously enjoyed the food.

Yay!The open kitchen is fabulous. I never watched Top Chef, but for any fans out there, it is probably a cool thing to watch Dale Talde and his crew cooking in front of you. FOOD:  We started with the pork and pretzel dumplings. AMAZING! They were crispy and delicious and I wish we were less people at our table so I were able to eat more of them.  Next, we had the pork Hawaiian buns, which are essentially little sliders. They were very good. The shrimp toasts, which are getting a lot of praise, were not my favorite. The sunny side up egg on top is a nice touch, with a side of gravy to dump all over. It comes out looking like a delicious plate of french toast and eggs . . . it looks beautiful. Not for me though. This followed with the Kale silken tofu and butternut squash salad. I am not a Kale eater and I wanted to order the Wedge. To me this dish sounded foo-foo. BUT LET ME SAY IT WAS MY FAVORITE THING!!!!!!!! Crazy good. Loved the crispy bits of Kale. OMG! As I say this, I wish the place were open for lunch because that is what I would eat.Then, we had the Korean Fried Chicken. I am not one to order fried chicken (or any chicken for that matter at a restaurant) but WHOA! That was GREAT!  Crispy on the outside, moist and juicy on the inside. The spicy sauce is spicy but fantastic. Finally we had the fried rice which was fluffy and tasty and far superior to your typical fried rice dish.For other Park Slopers . . .  we went with our kids and they enjoyed all the food. There were some dishes there that may be a little spicy for a picky eater, but there are things on the menu that would be more ""kid friendly"" flavors.Overall, I am so happy to welcome TALDE to this neighborhood and wish it good luck.

We started the experience at Talde with a 20 minute wait at the bar, sipping beers - (we originally wanted the Punch, but they were out). It was a typical Park Slope crowd coming in and out at 6:30 on a Friday night (aka quite a few strollers but I guess that's what you get when you go out to eat that early).Once seated by an incredibly friendly host and hostess, we ordered the Perilla Leaf, which we were advised was the signature dish that more or less sums up the menu - delicate little leaves that packed a punch of spicy delicious flavor, I loved them. The Hawaiian Breads (get one of each - market veggie, fish, sausage) were great. Easy to cut in half and share. The Korean Chicken was also good - but the Pad Thai was where it was at for me. Clearly on the next trip, which will happen very soon, I will need to order the Briskit.  I have to wholeheartedly disargree with the person who posted that Song makes better Pad Thai than Talde. I think that is one of the craziest things I have read on Yelp (and Song/Joya is my favorite Thai spot so I am NOT a hater by any means).

We were seated quickly even though the place was busy, and ordered the pork dumplings with spicy mustard, the Hawaiian buns, a couple sides, and the pork shoulder with miso mustard.Pork dumplings: the dumplings have an interesting pretzel taste and texture and are unusually crispy, though not in a bad way. The spicy mustard is spicy and mustardy but didn't have too complex a flavor beyond that.Hawaiian buns: the pork had a somewhat smoky, enjoyable flavor, but the fluke was dry and overcooked and a chore to finish even in a small size.Sides: sticky rice and black pepper toast. The toast was fine but unexciting, needing more salt or something to liven it up. The sticky rice was adequate but hardly different than what one would expect from a decent Chinatown joint.Pork shoulder: the biggest disappointment, despite being recommended by our waitress. A large slab of meat with seemingly minimal preparation: one garnish and some sliced cucumber. We were left wondering if there was some missing glaze, because the meat by itself had only a slightly complex flavor and seemed overcooked. The garnish was a ""miso mustard"" that didn't have any noticeable miso taste and tasted similar to the pork dumpling mustard, just less spicy. Compared to, say, Lupa's pork shoulder, which is priced similarly, this seemed undeserving of being on the menu.An off-night? The recipes in general seem simple and unadorned enough that they require perfect preparation in order to distinguish themselves, which they definitely did not receive.

The Wonton Ramen soup which was really great, reasonable, and very filling. It wasn't magical though, nothing like the Food Hall's Ramen. The broth was very good though, as was the pork. The final dish we got was the fish. Our waiter kept talking about the dish as if it was fish taco like, with little pancakes. The fish was best on it's own, without the pancakes, which added nothing to the dish. The sauce was good, but the fish itself was pretty flavorless. Our waiter was nice.

2.0,1/16/2012,"Talde is, in a word, ready. The facilities are certainly conducive to the kind of semi-casual, observational dining that latter-day television foodies savor; the big booths provide wide tableaux for cellphone food photography and the ambient lighting and music make everything seem very busy, and very happy.  The waitstaff, eager and plentiful, powerwalk through the dining room, illuminating for confused customers (though no one seemed to be) the intricacies of the menu which Chef Talde, as he is ever called in his eponymous restaurant, has assembled to slay park slope palettes. The man himself, looking alternatingly relieved and commanding beneath a hat with his own name stitched on the front, stands to one side of the open kitchen beneath some well placed lights talking to friends and well-wishers between bouts of intense concentration as he plates pretzel dumplings or calls orders to his assembled team. Everything is beautiful, everything is comfortable, everything is ready - but the promise of an Asian fusion cuisine inspired enough to float that aging, sagging style is woefully unfulfilled.      Fusion is a coming together, a transformative combination that when executed adroitly creates a new cuisine greater than the sum of its parts. The menu and the chef's very public history in the kitchen should put any arguments appealing to ignorance to bed - he knows what he's doing. He's cooking the food that everyone expects him to cook, and in that regard excelling. What I mean by that is simply his combinations aren't surprising, but they are exciting. Crispy Oyster and Bacon Pad Thai is not rocket science, but it should be pretty fucking good, shouldn't it? (Bacon, by the way, graces approximately 1/3 of the items on the menu). Sadly it's nothing to write home about. It's a great idea, but the Pad Thai is only about as good as the eight dollar lunch special on Flatbush avenue. The oysters are crisp, crunchy, and perfectly delightlful - but four great bites in a family style dish hardly gets the gold. The pretzel dumplings taste at best microwaveable, like trader joes potstickers served with a slightly-too-bitter tahini based spicy mustard that pales in comparison with the real deal condiment, available now at your neighborhood take out spot.  The fluke was, perhaps most dissapointingly of all, overcooked into a pasty mush, drizzled with something vague and acidic possessing the consistency of lobster sauce, and  topped with parsley and the generally bland if healthful lean protein that is edamame. That's not to say the food was bad, because it certainly wasn't - but it also wasn't good enough. There's no depth of flavor, no love affair with ingredients (besides bacon), no passion. Everything is calm at Talde, and while on paper the menu excites, on the table it leaves me longing for the cuisines it draws from. Times have changed, and this is Brooklyn - the kind of novel lowbrow/highbrow fusion light that flies with tourists gets yawns, tumbleweeds, and crickets in this borough. Sunset Park is right down the road, literally, so we don't suffer from a lack of real deal Asian fare for comparison. Opening nights can be tough, I'll come back in a month or two and try again. Talde is ready, but still waiting to figure out how to make it work.",7,1,3,John S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0
5.0,1/15/2012,"Some people are going to love this place simply because Dale Talde is recognized as a seasoned contender on Top Chef.  Others will love it for the happening decor, with handsome Asian-inspired carved mahogany wood blending well with classic exposed Brooklyn brick.  Still others will love the equally handsome patrons (present company excluded), pulsating to a groovy (but not too loud) playlist.  I don't give a shit about any of that.  Either show me good, authentic food, or show me a twist that I didn't expect.  Talde delivers the latter.Every once in a while a TV show will come along and dare you to think a little differently... The West Wing, Sopranos, The Wire, Breaking Bad.  Initially they seem familiar, but when you get into the details you realize there's some geniuses at work.At Talde they've done a wonderful job of putting unique spins on familiar dishes while also making the unfamiliar seem normal.  A slider, but with fluke.  Pad Thai, but with bacon and oysters.  A simple rum and coke cocktail with the rum coming from the Mekong Delta.  I had no expectation of what Filipino pork should taste like, but it was probably one of the best sausage bites I've ever eaten.  It punched me with flavor and spice.  Suddenly the black pepper butter toast on the menu doesn't seem so odd or intimidating.  They won me.  There's a nod to seemingly all parts of Pan Pacific/Asia:  Hawaii, Vietnam, Korea, China, Thailand, Japan and others.  But unlike eateries that try to be all things to all people (and end up failing everyone), Talde is restrained enough to keep things tight.  In fact there's no more than 6 apps and 6 entrees on the opening menu, coupled with a dozen more sides, soups and salads.You can sit in the dining area or grab drinks and select apps at the bar.  I counted 10 draft beers that ranged from Miller High Life ($3) to Coney Island Mermaid Pilsner ($5) to Hitachino Red Rice Ale ($10).    There were a dozen wines, 6 sakes, and 10 house cocktails including the Brooklyn Sling and Pacquiao Punch.If you don't want to plunge in and dine, have some dumplings ($6) and a beer at the bar.  No biggie. They are brand spanking new so time will tell if this review is worthy of your attention.  But for now, I'm going back to try the Korean Fried Chicken if for no other reason that Fried Chicken needs no celebrity, decor or scene.  It simply needs some love and I'm betting this place delivers on that promise.",14,6,13,Jonathan E.,"San Diego, CA",419,1158,1807
5.0,1/15/2012,"Wow!  This place is going to be BUSY!  I am reliving the dream of last night's dinner in my mind and still smiling.  Six of us shared a number of the family-style dishes and they started out great and just kept getting better.  You will like everything, but for our group, the best of the best were the Hawaiian bread buns, the pretzel pork dumplings, the Korean fried chicken, the market ramen, the Long Island fluke, and the oyster and bacon pad thai.  The service is extremely friendly and professional, the decor is beautiful, and the atmosphere is sophisticated yet relaxed.  The owners really know their stuff.",1,0,1,Amy R.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,8,0
