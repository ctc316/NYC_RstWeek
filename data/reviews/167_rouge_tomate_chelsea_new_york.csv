3.0,8/26/2018,"Ate there recently on a Thursday evening with a friend and was shocked to see a dining room maybe 20% full. Shame because the food and service was lovely. The salmon confit appetizer lacked something -- one more element maybe? -- but the focaccia was addictive, and both our entrees were delicious.One HUGE let down was the wine list. What happened? We actually came for the wine, not knowing how much the list had been pared down. I know the old wine director isn't there anymore, so wasn't expecting the old award-winning list, but was expecting at least something reminiscent of the old list. What remains is sad. It's a small, uneven list still in its old binder, with illustrations of regions they barely have for sale anymore. A total shame.",0,0,0,Brooke W.,"San Francisco, CA",85,15,0
2.0,8/24/2018,"Everything at Rouge Tomate was fantastic...except for the food. The room was lovely, and I appreciated that the noise level was reasonable even though the restaurant was fairly full. I love it when I don't have to shout across the table. Service was spot on. Waiter offered thoughtful descriptions of certain dishes, and the wine guy was also very helpful. By now I really wanted to love this restaurant, but the food absolutely sucked. The mushroom tartare, salmon confit, squab, and black bass were all bland and underwhelming. The best thing we had all night was the cheese plate, but I could have put together something similar from Whole Foods. One Michelin star, two Yelp stars.",0,1,0,Oscar M.,"San Francisco, CA",16,56,1

5.0,8/21/2018,"If I could give 6 stars, I would.  I'm local to RT and called up on a Thursday night asking if I could walk over for a quick dinner.  I walked in by myself, fresh off a 5-hr plane flight, hungry, and hot from the muggy summer night.  It was late, so I didn't have time to change first and was still wearing sneakers and a hoodie over some nicer casual clothes.  The hostess welcomed me without a glance at my less-than-dressy attire and asked if I'd like to sit at the ""Chef's Table"" because she had some space there.  I jumped at this opportunity, which can be rare.  It led to one of the best dining experiences I've had in NYC.  Since I was alone this time and didn't need to share dishes or compromise on what was ordered, I decided to order based on my wine.  The sommelier came over and we had a great discussion about the type of wines that I wanted to explore and the 3-glass wine flight that he recommended for my goals.  He then offered suggestions for food pairings, leaving room for me to make some choices rather than just having one dish suggested per flight glass.  I ordered lightly because of the summer heat:  the heirloom tomatoes app, the Walu app (my favorite menu item), and the veggie mushrooms dish.  While I waited for my order to be prepared, I could watch the kitchen as they worked.  The meticulous quality check on each dish before it was served was apparent.  While I waited for my order and while I ate, the pasta/veggie chef and I had a fun chat about all things from food to finance.  He's in the (maybe un-enviable to some ?) position of working right in front of the Chef's Table bar and cheerfully talked with me and other guests while he worked.  During my meal, the head chef (the owner?) was incredibly generous.  As I tried my wines, he allowed me to order an additional mini-tasting portion of the oysters so I could try all the food pairings that the sommelier suggested for my wines.  One of the bonuses of sitting at the Chef's Table, the chefs -- noticing that I ordered only light summer food -- alerted me that one of their best dishes, the short ribs, was only going to be on the menu one more day and urged me to try it.  (They explained why it wasn't staying on the menu, which I won't go into here, but it made sense.)  Of course, with that kind of insider alert, I ordered the short ribs knowing that I couldn't finish another main dish.  They were delicious and I'll miss not being able to order the short ribs again.  Thanks to everyone, my meal was amazing dance of wine and food pairings throughout the evening.  Things continued to be wonderful even after I paid my bill. When it came time to leave, they allowed me to take photos on my iPhone of the wine bottles I tasted so that I could remember them.  And, very specially, the pasta/veggie chef suggested that I take home my leftovers (1/2 each of the mushrooms and short ribs dishes) and gave me perfect suggestions on how to prepare them the next day with a couple ingredients that I had at home (eggs and potatoes) for another meal!  Thanks to his suggestions and instructions, I had another very tasty Rouge Tomate meal at home the next day.  Many thanks to the entire RT staff, and especially to the head chef (owner?), the pasta/veggie chef, and sommelier, for a memorable spontaneous summer evening and meal.",0,0,0,Susan H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,4,0
4.0,8/19/2018,"Went here with a friend to check them out for restaurant week with high expectations since they currently own a Michelin star. I can't quite say I was as impressed as I was hoping, but the food was still very good. We wanted to try as many things as possible, so we ended up splitting everything.Walu carpaccio (4 stars): This wasn't a particularly large dish, but the flavor was definitely there.Chilled melon-coconut curry soup (4.5 stars): I absolutely love curry and this dish did not disappoint--definitely a great portion size also.Sea bream (3.5 stars): This was decent, but nothing particularly memorable overall.Glazed short ribs (4 stars): The short ribs were cooked pretty well, though not as tender as it could have been. The serrano creamed corn was great, as were the braised greens.Spaghetti alla chitarra (4.5 stars): This was one of the best things we had all night as the spaghetti was cooked perfectly and the sauce has a nice richness and spice.Chocolate mousse (3.5 stars): This mousse was good, but it was very reminiscent of some others I have had around the city. Overall, this place serves up some great plates, but didn't hit the high marks I was expecting from a Michelin starred restaurant. Nevertheless, the restaurant week deal is great and definitely worth checking out if you get the chance.",2,1,1,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",746,1843,225
5.0,8/14/2018,"Out of the restaurants that I went for Restaurant Week, this one certainly topped the list in terms of quality and novelty of its dishes! Each course never failed to pleasantly surprise me.For the first course, I had the Walu Carpaccio. It was savory and chewy, while the citrus yuzu and soy were the perfect sour/salty balance. I love raw meats, so this was probably my favorite course. My date ordered the chilled melon-coconut curry soup, which, involved quite a few components of flavor that went very well together. It was a very interesting dish to experience, and he paused after every spoonful to process all of it.The glazed shortribs for the second course were incredible. The meat was so so tender and perfectly juicy without being fatty. The sauce and greens also gave the dish a warm, hearty feel.For dessert, the Summer Berry Pavlova that I had was light and fruity -- the crispy meringue base melted nicely in my mouth. My date actually liked it more than I did, but maybe I just prefer something more substantial. The Chocolate Mousse, though, was something else. Everything about it was so decadent and rich -- the creamy chocolate and pistachio were like shots of heaven. The cherry paste and thin flakes were also essential touches that provided texture -- think Ferroro Rocher. My date said he wished he could get an entire bowl of this dessert, which says a lot since he doesn't normally have a sweet tooth.The restaurant does have a unique focus on health and environmental sustainability, so the portions are not large. However, the creativity and complexity of the dishes makes it an highly satisfying experience. Not only do I highly recommend this place to others, but I'm very curious to try more items here next time I'm in NYC!",0,0,0,Cindy Y.,"San Francisco, CA",349,3,6
4.0,8/9/2018,"We went for the restaurant week. The food was good, great flavors and complexity. The wine pairings were very good. The ambiance is quite casual and slightly loud conversation level. Our server was not too chatty. We have to wait for a bit between courses. The portion is quite small for dinner in my opinion, it is more like a lunch portion so I am kind of disappointed on that part. I wish they would serve some bread so at least I can soak up all the delicious sauce and get more fulled at the end of the meal.",0,0,0,Min-Ching K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,16

5.0,8/7/2018,"This restaurant is well deserved with Michelin one star. Food is great. We came here for the restaurant week menu. For appetizer, Walu Cappacio was tasty. It was well seasoned and the taste was balanced by fish, seasoning and vegetables. For main course, short ribs are incredible. The meat was well cooked. It was very tender and had a lot of flavors. Dessert was not outstanding but still solid. I got chocolate mousse and it was pretty good. My fiends didn't like their Berries. The base was like hard candy and it was too sweet. Service was good. The manager and bartender were very nice. The environment and ambience were great. It's a casual but chic place. It feels very comforting and relaxing. I've got to mention the cocktails here. I got Kale and it was so refreshing. I know I'm kidding myself when I feel that the drink is heathy haha. My fiends loved Cucumber one a lot.

5.0,7/31/2018,"Rouge Tomate Chelsea earns its Michelin Star for good reasons: its knowledgeable and friendly staff, its farm fresh ingredients, its creative and delicious dishes, and finally its unique mission. Their goal of creating a well-rounded menu that remains mindful of the environment and the health of each person that walks through their doors is inspiring, to say the least.

4.0,7/26/2018,"Came here for dinner for Restaurant Week Summer 2018 and made reservations ahead of time. Me and my date arrived a little early but were seated immediately anyway. For the appetizer, I ordered the Walu Carpaccio which is really good if you enjoy raw fish. My date had the Chilled Melon-Coconut Curry Soup which was alright. I personally prefer my soup hot which was why I didn't particularly enjoy it when I tried it. For the entree I ordered the Sea Bream which was cooked perfectly and practically melted in my mouth. My date ordered the Glazed Shortribs and he said it tasted so good that I had to try a bite. The meat was so tender and perfectly cooked. The sauce that it paired with was also delectable as wellFinally, for dessert, I ordered the Summer Berry Pavlova which was so light and flavorful that I was glad I opted for something new. My date had the Chocolate Mousse which was also amazing and came with a dollop of strawberry sorbet on top.Overall I definitely enjoyed my dinner here.

4.0,7/26/2018,"We went there for a NY Restaurant week. I have to admit that after reading recent reviews, my expectations were that the plates are going to be small and that after the meal there we'd have to have another dinner for a more affordable price. Anyway, I wanted to go for an experience.The plates were not small. For the first course, I had  a chilled melon-coconut curry soup, which was delicious with the touch of spiciness (I'm not a huge fan of spicy food, but this was actually very nice); my friend had heirloom tomato, which was quite good, too. For the second course, we had sea bream and spaghetti - we loved both of those. And the desserts were out of this world. Pavlova was melting in the mouth and chocolate mousse was very full of different flavors and crunchiness. We also got wine pairing, for $27 pp - a different glass for each course - sounded like a great deal. Overall, nice decor, the service was great, the plates were served as soon as we finished the prior course, the staff was very pleasant. Most importantly, we were not hungry at all, it was a perfect amount of food. One star less - our table was beneath a leak.",0,0,0,Alexandera Z.,"Manhattan, NY",1,5,6
1.0,7/25/2018,"It appears, reading reviews, that this may have been an off night. The reputation is very good.  The staff at reception was charming.  The wait staff inside, when we could get their attention, was just fine...but illusive.The food -- squab for me, oysters and fish-for-two for my co-diners -- was uniformly disappointing.  The squab was tough (had to ask for a better knife) though the veg was tasty.  The fish was reportedly bony and disappointing.  Hmmm. Given the price point, not a successful evening.Oh...and the table was set beneath a leak...actually two leaks.

5.0,7/21/2018,"This place is incredible! Where to start???Went there on a Saturday for an early dinner (5:30) and didn't have a reservation. The hostess was incredibly gracious and immediately sat us in the dining room. We had Caroline as our server and she was attentive, friendly and informative. Ok. First of all, we ordered wine by the glass and the sommelier came over to our table and poured for us (100% class). We immediately knew this was going to be good. We ordered the oysters on the half shell and WOW mind blown. There was a refreshing tangy herb granita and lemon foam on-top of the oysters. DELICIOUS. We ordered the Dover Sole for 2 and it was probably the best Dover Sole I've ever tasted. It was the entire fish cooked in butter over germs. It came with chewy herby rice and sautéed baby zucchini. It was beyond perfect. For dessert we ordered the carrot cake which came with vanilla ice cream. It was so tasty!!! Here's the thing with Rouge Tomate.... the portions are not huge and I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT! I like a smallish ""normal size"" portion and not the typical Gargantuan size generally found in lower end restaurants. Quality over quantity is what I believe in. If you want enormous portions best go to Friday's or Olive Garden.",1,0,0,Lori C.,"New York, NY",0,39,7

4.0,6/15/2018,"I wanted to love this restaurant because I love the concept of seasonality and a health-conscious focus. I went for a tasting menu - perhaps ordering a la carte would be more successful. I can't fault the cooking ability, but it was hit or miss and kind of boring. Started off on a high note with the amuse bouche: an oyster on ice topped with caviar. Followed with Walu, which was one of the best courses. It had a beautiful silky texture, and yuzu is one of my favorite flavors. The White asparagus was very odd, the puree was too strong and pungent and none of the flavors complimented each other. I was really looking forward to the hokkaido uni, and it was tasty but not nearly as fresh as I expected. The halibut needed more seasoning, and I expected more from the description of ""spring pea, almond, enoki mushrooms"" all of which I love, but fell flat. The onion-glazed squab was the opposite, with a very punchy concentrated glaze. I found the squab too fatty, but if fat doesn't bother you then it's quite a good dish. Roasted to crispy-skin perfection and paired with delicious morels. Next was creamy goats milk cheese with preserved lemon and toasts - this was fantastic. We finished with ""wild strawberry & rhubarb"" - as a dessert lover, I was not very satisfied. The portion was very small, consisting of a canele of vanilla ice cream, a few stewed fruits, and crumbled lavender sable. A slightly fancy ice cream sundae anyone? Too small, too simple. Service was fine, they had run out of 2 of the beers we asked for, but were friendly about it. The ambiance is modern and trendy, with an open kitchen near the back. I would've preferred sitting closer to the kitchen as the view of 18th street isn't that nice.",2,0,1,Lillian Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",461,285,1300
2.0,6/2/2018,"Don't understand this restaurant, it was half empty and remained so through the night, yet we could only eat in the bar that has a weird menu that has five burgers and a sea bass for main. As a pescatarian I found that very limiting and because my boyfriend had the sea bass I ended up eating fish apps for dinner; the food was good but I left hungry. The main menu had lobster and other fish yet we could not have it nor could we sit in the half empty dining room (they told us the wait is an hour). Will not return. It doesn't have the vibe or the chef of the old restaurant in Midtown. Some kind of gimmicky process for seating.

I like it because this is a dish I used to order with a friend of mine whenever we go out. And this dish reminded me those carefree days. This was a Long Island duck, and for some reason it sounded funny. Others had the chicken and halibut, all are very tasty.The one thing that I found interesting abut this restaurant is how unpretentious this place felt given how precious many San Francisco based Michelin tends to be.

Oyster with caviar as an amuse buche was transcendent. A crudo of fish with a glass of dry champagne started off the meal. This was followed up by some sake' and another fish course. The fish courses were fresh and distinctive without heavy handed sauces and a lot of butter to compromise their pure flavor.  By the time you get to the duck course your palate has acclimated to the lightness of the fish and the mushroom gratin, but you adjust, with some over the top Chateau Neuf du Pape.

5.0,2/7/2018,"A lot of Michelin starred restaurants are the same. Many even have variations of the same dish, but Rouge Tomate is refreshingly different. Firstly, it's casual upscale dining... no hushed atmosphere and a decor that doesn't make you feel underdressed! Secondly, it's as much about the beverages as it is the food. Often the matching beverages are a very nice, safe, expensive wine list, but at RT they get experimental which is fun, different, and less expensive. We had a cider and a sherry amongst some interesting wines and it made a refreshing change. Also, the cocktail list was extensive/exhaustive but everything we tried was a worthy interpretation of a classic or something fresh and fun.

1.0,1/21/2018,We went to rouge tomate last night and what a disappointment! Who to be angry at? The guide Michelin for allowing them a star or the restaurant itself? 1. The service was poor. Our waitress was cute but useless. We asked her to inquire about the dégustation menu and the modifications that could be done to it. She never asked anyone and never got back to us. Then she ignored us most of the time. 2. The presentation of the food is not what you expect from a 1 star. The presentation didn't look nice or appealing. Everything was in brownish colors3. The taste of the food was dull! Nothing extraordinary. You couldn't taste the freshness of the products.4. For desert we had the chocolate mousse. How can you miss a chocolate mousse? Well they did! Lost in an ocean of brown foam that didn't make you want to dig in it when finally you go for it the mousse is not even tasty! Rouge Tomate Chelsea is just another dull restaurant like the 20000 other you find in Manhattan that doesn't focused on taste but on style. Only difference : they have a Michelin star.

4.0,12/16/2017,"Really good wine? Yes.Really good shared plates?  Yes!Really good thoughtful decor and design?  Yes!!Looking for a natural wine bar in Chelsea?  We were and checked out Rouge Tomate.  The decor is stunning, from the vibrant rouge painting outside, to the woodsy, white accented interior.  Be sure to go the bathrooms upstairs and make sure you take a selfie with the mirrors on the staircase.Wine was so fantastic.  I prefer ordering to be a conversation, so I asked the waiter to help me select something for my particular taste.   Choose a mineral, creamy Hatzidakis Assyrtiko which was phenomenal.  Enjoyed the wine, then ordered a few plates which were shared.All the food was farmhouse style, with the pickled mackerel being the most sophisticated.  Cauliflower was in a béchamel sauce that I could have easily made at home. Carrots were a bit over roasted for me, plus the top was shedding and made them a bit hard to eat.  Mushroom tartare was a favorite.If I lived in the nabe I'd certainly be a regular.",8,6,8,Gina R.,"Jersey City, NJ",425,197,708
4.0,12/12/2017,"I came here for a large group dinner; our party was seated in an open area at the front of the restaurant and offered selections from a prix-fixe menu. The service was wonderful and accommodating to the various members of our party who had various allergies, although the menu already caters to various diets. I myself do not have allergies, but know that the people who were intolerant of gluten, dairy, meat, etc. still had a satisfying meal.

4.0,12/10/2017,"Booked a reservation here after two friends tried it out with mixed reviews, and happy to report that I loved it. My boyfriend and I ordered items a la carte, as I wasn't very taken with the tasting menu and also didn't want to consume on that level (both monetarily and calorically). We started with the cocktails, which met the hype level of every rave review I've read on this page. I had the grapefruit #4, which was excellent and balanced the grapefruit flavor and alcohol perfectly. I forget my boyfriend's drink since I was so smitten with mine, but I do remember that he also enjoyed it greatly. We then ordered the walu crudo and roasted cauliflower, which were both delicious. I was blown away by the duck as my main dish. It was incredibly juicy and flavorful, and the plating was exquisite. My boyfriend looked longingly at my plate as he enjoyed his still tasty but inferior salmon. Unfortunately we did not listen to my friends and forgot to order their recommended lemon tart as dessert, instead opting for the panna cotta, which we both did not care for. It did not have much flavor and was kind of just tasteless jelly. I would return to Rouge Tomate to try out more cocktails and have the duck again. It wasn't difficult to secure a reservation at prime time on Friday night, and the location is fairly convenient. It's definitely deserving of its shiny new Michelin star and is a great spot to impress your date or friends and family.",7,3,5,Elaine Z.,"New York, NY",495,291,132
5.0,12/6/2017,"If you're looking for fresh, artfully executed, healthy-ish food and drinks in an open, well-decorated space you can't miss with Tomate. Been here once for dinner and once for brunch, would come back for either.A standout dish is the roasted cauliflower (aka 2017's version of beet salad). In a sea of cauliflower preparations stretching across town, Tomate's stands as the Moses. The use of fennel and some of the best almonds I've had make this a must try.Tomate has a Michelin star now, but I don't necessarily see it as a special occasion restaurant or a spot that's going to serve you a meal you're going to remember for years - but I don't think it's trying to do that.

Mushroom farfalle had overcooked pasta and undercooked maitake (normally my fave fungi), blessed with a total absence of seasoning. The gritty cauliflower starter was nestled in a bed of strange raisin-filled ""cream."" If you like your broccoli dehydrated, heated and flavorless, go for it. Simple side of roasted baby potatoes were unevenly cooked. Carrot side very pretty but entirely flavorless. Salmon cooked perfectly but blander than bland. (Do they employ a highly skilled flavor-eliminator?) Speaking of work, the service alternated between painfully slow & oblivious to obsequious bordering on silly.

4.0,11/30/2017,"My friend was able to snag reservations at 6PM on a Saturday, and of course I had drop everything and check out the newest addition to the Michelin guide. I believe our original reservation was in the bar room but after inquiring about the tasting menu, the hostess was gracious enough to move us into the main dining room. Though I had all intentions of getting a glass of wine, I ended up with the Sherry Cobbler because...well, I'm disgusting enough to giggle about finding name-fellows in the menu. But it was delicious! I'm not a huge fan of Sherries, but the drink was a perfect balance of sweet, refreshing, and fruity. There are a good variety of cocktails, both classics and specials, that all sound very interesting and I would like to revisit for the drinks alone. The tasting menu started off a little rough, mostly because the mushroom tartare rolled off the plate into my lap; luckily I caught it so there was no need to panic, but the server was definitely ruffled because he was overly careful about serving the dish to other tables as the night went on. No harm no foul, but perhaps the presentation requires another thought - the tartare was delicious and now memorable, but the oyster didn't particularly stand out. The Cauliflower Custard may have been one of my favorites from the evening - the texture and taste of the buttery uni paired well with the smooth egg and cauliflower custard. Not the most inspired of dishes, as Casa Mono does a similar creamy eggs with sea urchin (although this was better), but nice nevertheless. The next two courses were not particularly well balanced; the Walu Crudo was overly soaked in lime juice seemed to cross over into ceviche-land and the mushroom risotto was heavily peppered. Apart from the shaving of truffles over the top, the risotto didn't stand out in any particular way from others that I have had. The plating of the salmon was beautiful - edible flowers and roe over the crispy salmon, on top of a dollop dill yogurt. I tried the dill yogurt with the salmon, but found that it was better off without. The roe and salmon pairing is quite mischievous and reminds of me the tongue-in-cheek ""oyokodon"" (literally, parent-and-child) in Japanese cuisine. The edible flower was a nice touch and provided a slightly spicy and refreshing contrast to the salmon. Because it's been a couple of weeks, I don't remember much about the duck entree - so, evidently, it was nothing to write home about. The deconstructed Lemon Tart dessert was quite a surprise - I loved how the sourness of the lemon popped against the lightly sugared meringues and buttery but not crumbly ""base"" of the tart. However, the Rooftop Honey dessert was gimmicky; while it's cool that the honey came from the roof of the restaurant, honey usually has the underlying flavor of the flowers the bees visited and this had none of that. They obviously know this and tried to compensate with the lavender base but...at the end of the day, its mediocre honey drizzled over vanilla ice cream. Although there were a number of misses, I enjoyed the experience and if you're going to make the trip here, definitely try out the tasting menu once. However, if I were to return, I would probably try out cocktails and order bites a la carte instead. Their entry into the Michelin guide is justified as the food, presentation, and service were good, but as with most New American restaurants these days, the ""story"" of the tasting menu needs more buttoning up.",4,3,3,Sherry Z.,"Manhattan, NY",267,105,88
3.0,11/19/2017,"Went here for dinner last night.  Beautiful atmosphere, but a bit on the noisy side.  Service was EXTREMELY slow.  We sat for more than 45 minutes with our menus before the waiter finally came to take our food order.  Luckily, we did get a bottle of wine first (nice and extensive wine list and good advice from the sommelier) and were able to enjoy that while talking with our friends, but it was inexcusable to have to wait so long for the waiter to return.  Service for the remainder of the meal was adequate.Food is excellent, but the entree portions are very small, especially for the price.  One of our friends promptly ordered a side of potatoes after seeing the size of her entree (and she is not what I would call a big eater).  The sides were a reasonbale size (just as big as the entrees to give you an idea of how small they were) as were the desserts.  So, I would plan on ordering a side dish in addition to your entree for a decent meal.Overall a nice restaurant with great food, but some points off for the long wait to order and the entree portion to price ratio.",0,1,0,John M.,"Yonkers, NY",22,4,0
3.0,11/6/2017,"As a new entry on the 2018 Michelin guide, Rouge Tomate was the first of few to catch my eye. Unfortunately, I seem to have walked in with unreasonable expectations, as the experience - while good - left more to be desired.I opted for the Tasting Menu, which consisted of 8 courses, inclusive of an amuse-bouche and 2 desserts for $95. When we were being served, the waiter mishandled the amuse-bouche plate and dropped the mushroom tartare onto my friend's lap. Thankfully they managed to catch it, but it was strange how he walked away so nonchalantly afterwards with a curt apology.In my opinion, the remainder of the meal was a somewhat clumsy mix of several different identities. The Cauliflower Custard and Walu Crudo had striking semblances of Japanese and Hawaiian cuisine, the latter of which was way too sour that wasn't quite balanced out with the puree. The mushroom risotto was fantastic - it was rich and creamy, but disconnected from the previous courses.The salmon was a bit overcooked, but the roe more than made up for that. Duck was good, but again, nothing memorable here.Throughout the night, I think we were served our courses by three different people, only one of whom actually explained what was on our plates. The consistency was lacking there, and it would've been nice to gain some insight as to what every dish was supposed to be that evening.Overall, I see why Rouge Tomate managed to claw its way to a Michelin star for this coming year, but purely because of the chef's ability showcased in each individual course. As a cohesive meal, however, I was left confused and debating if the restaurant even knew what they were trying to present.",6,3,3,Dan C.,"Manhattan, NY",24,128,24

We tried like 15 cocktails great selection - amazing staff Food was very average at best and not worth the prices. We shared everything and clearly it does not justify those prices.

The restaurant is a bit loud. If you really like serenity this is not for you. The portions are small.

3.0,9/17/2017,"We had dinner at Rouge Tomate last night with a group of friends, and I was excited to try it out - I had heard about it before, and after walking by it a few times, it is clear that the ambiance of the restaurant is very nice. Different shades of rustic wooden slats cover the walls, giving the restaurant a very homey feel (certainly different from feeling like you are in the heart of Manhattan). There's a bar area and some high-top tables in the first section to the right after entering, followed by a more typical dining room that has the kitchen in the back, with soothing green lighting (mimicking a tree, if I had to guess) hovering above it. The seating is simple - we sat around a large circular wooden table with alternating chairs of black and white. Although it took a little bit of time for our orders to get in, the food came out at a leisurely pace thereafter. The drink menu has a decent selection all around, with the beer being pretty solid (I very much enjoyed Grimm's Splish double IPA) but the cocktails being disappointing...I had both the Penicillin and Grapefruit #3, and both tasted a bit watered down, with the former having an egg white fizz that was too thick, meaning I had a lot of it left over when I finished the rest of the drink.Given the prices when ordering a la carte, doing the prix fixe menu makes the most sense ($49 for 3 courses). All of the starters are vegetarian, while the mains have fish and meat but are a lighter take on them. Of the dishes my wife and I had, the best was unequivocally the mushroom tartare - the mushrooms were diced up and cooked perfectly to imitate the texture of raw meat but having the hearty, earthy flavor of sauteed mushrooms. On the other hand, my wife's apple celeriac soup was too light and, to be a frank, a very bland and uninteresting dish. The mains were solid on balance, but I felt that while the roasted pork loin (what I ordered) was cooked very well, it was - again - too light, with a consomme that lacked much flavor or salt. The burdock it was served with as a result didn't have much flavor, and it was a bit on the crunchy side (i.e. for being braised, it seemed undercooked). My wife's salmon was cooked pretty well, but I was surprised to encounter multiple bones while eating it - and for $36, it was not remarkable relative to the many other salmon filets I have eaten elsewhere. The veggie sides were also okay, with the potatoes being the most familiar and homey (roasted in oil and garlic), while the charred broccoli had a nice texture but didn't really retain much character from a flavor standpoint. We finished off our meals with the panna cotta, which was a nice, refreshing way to finish the meal.I like the ambiance of Rouge Tomate, but given the prices - and the (relative) lack of options you have in selecting from the menu - there are definitely other places in NYC that do it better. It's worth a visit for sure, but I would probably wait until the menu changes (assuming it does by season) to consider coming back again.",2,0,0,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",371,1653,169

Fun and thoughtful but it forgot to be tasty. Tried a couple other cocktails too and those were much more successful.

3.0,8/24/2017,"The restaurant was fairly empty when my friend and I went. We had reservations for a Saturday night at 8:15 pm, so I would've expected more of a crowd. Despite the low crowd it was a nice place.Customer service was friendly and they were very accommodating and patient around any sort of dietary constraints. This spot works for vegetarians, gluten-free, paleo.I ordered the salmon dish, without the green goddess dressing (which has dairy). Instead they made another herbal, oil sauce, which was perfect. Though I will say, the menu said ""Organic salmon"" and there is no such thing as ""Organic"" salmon. There is no such certification. I didn't give them flack for it, but I will say it's a little bit of a flag when restaurants are clearly using buzzwords to describe menu items...and empty buzzwords, since there is no such ""organic"" salmon. It definitely lowers my trust level in them.My friend and I shared the broccoli, plums, and pine nuts side dish. It had a kale and basil pesto on it. I was impressed with the flavors of this dish. We both really liked it!My friend ordered the mushroom appetizer and liked it.It's a bit on the pricier side for what you get.

5.0,5/28/2017,"I had dinner here on a Friday night with my sister and a friend and we were all blown away my Rouge Tomate.  We were initially drawn to the restaurant because of the cocktail menu.  These days in NYC, a creative and well-done cocktail list seems to appear at your table at every restaurant but this one seemed particularly intriguing.  For example, the seasonal cocktails incorporated fruits and vegetables of the season to create exquisite drinks.  We tried the Kale, Rhubarb, and Pineapple Pachona and loved them all.  I think the favorite drink of the night was the Eucalypto.  My sister and I are currently scheming on how to recreate it.  It was just so velvety and divine.In addition to drinking, we did eat!  For starters, we opted for all the crudo/carpaccio options with the char being the winner although all three were excellent.  For dinner, we ended up all getting the scallops and I can certainly say we were pleased with our decision.  The scallops were enormous, plump, and perfectly seared with a nice crisp skin to complement the soft meat.  The scallops were accompanied by a nice selection of leeks and broccoli rabe, and we added a side of asparagus.The interior of the restaurant is absolutely beautiful.  There is an open kitchen and huge wooden beams with plants hanging from them.  The tables are very spaced out so you don't have to listen to the couple next to you fight about their Memorial Day Weekend plans.  Finally, the service was outstanding!  Our waters were always full, the waiters were friendly without being overbearing, and they corrected a minor mistake with a drink order in a gracious and accommodating manner.  Rouge Tomate, you have won me over!",4,2,5,Alexandra K.,"Jersey City, NJ",228,149,538

5.0,3/28/2017,"You honestly can't go wrong with anything here. I loved everything here as much as I did at the old location (which honestly, I only went once but sampled practically the entire menu).The new location in Chelsea feels more home-y and cozy and will surprise you how big it is once you venture upstairs in search of the restroom. I loved being able to see the action in the kitchen as well as still being separated to enjoy the company of my dining companions.As tempting as it was to just say, ""Give me one of everything!"", we restrained ourselves to the following: the swiss chard gratin, anchovy, cauliflower salad, fluke crudo, tuna, venison carpaccio, wild boar, and striped bass. I might have missed a dish. HA. For dessert, we shared the cheese board and the ""chocolate"".I was surprised at how much I loved the fluke crudo the most and moreso than the tuna! Each bite of fluke was just jam packed with flavor - uni, basil, kohlrabi, thai chili - easily my favorite dish of the whole night. Not to say that we didn't enjoy the other dishes - but this one stands out in my mind, even a month later after my visit. The cauliflower salad was also a star dish that I just couldn't get enough of. The venison was not nearly as scary as I anticipated. I don't generally like venison but this version was really good. Cocktail wise, they have an interesting list and I opted for the ""Climate Change"" cocktail with a melting clementine pink peppercorn ice cube. I had to laugh (and try it) but also like ""oh dear""...melting. Yeah. Ha. It was fun. Also very strong. Service was on point all night.

We probably chatted with at least 3 staff members while ordering and eating. Everyone was personable, chill and helpful. The menu is amazing. It's very plant focused but there are plenty of items for carnivores as well. Everything including drinks, is local, seasonal and committed to sustainable farming. I loved that it was so clearly stated on the menus. We tried leek and potato with smoked haddock and oysters. Fantastic! We also split the bison burger and the Moroccan spiced turkey burger (added an egg for both). The bison was absolutely phenomenal! Turkey was good and unique but nothing like bison.

Absolutely phenomenal and I don't think I'll ever be able to order a drink with egg whites without pretending to have a mustache for at least 3 seconds.

5.0,1/1/2017,"Hands down, RT is the best new restaurant in 2016 in my book :)I came back here the 4th time with my BFF for NYE / pre-birthday dinner last night. Everything, from food to service to the live jazz band, was PERFECT. On arrival we were seated promptly as requested - at our usual counter seats overlooking kitchen in action where all the magic happened. Chef Andy was busy directing the crew.  Right after ordering food and wine, we were served the Hummock Island oysters on the half shell with ginger lemon ice. Fresh and juicy, loving the ginger zinc!We opted for the 3 courses NYE dinner (5 courses also available but would be too much food for us). My favorite was the  steamed black bass with mussels and fennel in a dressing with hint of turmeric and lemon (?) The fish is perfectly cooked tender and moist. It went very well with the shredded fennel and crispy lettuces accompanied the dish. Light and refreshing . The tiny gnocchi came with the dish were al dente and toothsome best vehicle to soak up the dressing. I ventured out with a chinuri a Georgian wine from Iago' s wine which was crisp refreshing with hint of white tea and ginger; high acidity . It went seamlessly with the fish. For appetizer, I went with the fluke crudo with uni (not hiding my uni-whore face) , basil, kolrabi and thai chili , simple looking but complex flavor as you could imagine from the ingredients. Fluke is quite boring fish for me but this one was anything but boring. Pairing very well with a honey, caramel - like young (2012) savagnin by Stephane Tissot, Arbois ,  Jura, France. It was exquisite. The well curated wine list at Rouge Tomate is one of the reasons I keep coming back.  And of course there would be dessert. It would never go wrong with dark chocolate with cherry sherbet. To make the experience even better, I got the Guatemala coffee to go with it. Life is complete ;)After dinner we lingered another 30 mins for the live music on a glass of wine - they played my favorite Duke Ellington ""Take the A train"". If I was not wearing a 5 inch Louboutin I would have danced to it :)What a wonderful dinner and a great start of the New Year.

5.0,12/25/2016,"Though I never made it to the original Rouge Tomate, the Chelsea location shot to the top of my list immediately after opening. It seemed too good to be true: uber-healthy Michelin-grade food and wine? There's no way that my experience could match the hype. Fantasy and reality rarely match. But, the emphasis in this case is on ""rarely"". We had the pleasure of dining at Rouge Tomate on Sunday night and couldn't have been more enthralled with what we encountered along the way. Both the food and drinks were divine (as were the folks preparing said ingestibles for us) and the service-was top-notch. Pricey, yes, but that was more than anything the result of how excitable I get when confronted with wine selections like the one at Rouge Tomate. We arrived 15 minutes before our reservation, and it was pretty clear we'd be in for a treat upon walking in. The hostess offered us a few possible courses of action along with checking our coats for us. We opted for sitting at the bar with our now-best friend, Alejandro (our very refined mixologist). We vowed to take advantage of the unbelievable wine list during dinner, so we decided that to start the night off with a cocktail. Rouge Tomate divides its menu in Classics (twists on classics is more apt), Specials and Seasonals--I went for a Whisky Sour (blended scotch, south hill pommeau, apple-ginger syrup, lime, allspice dram, egg) and the bf went for the seasonal Market Apple (white rhum, apple consommé, lemon-rosemary shrub, apple-ginger syrup, orange - hot drink). Both were fantastic and perfectly proportioned. If you've got a hankering for a warm beverage not called a Hot Toddy, the Market Apple is your go-to. The only hot drink I've ever enjoyed. All thanks to Alejandro, who I became fast friends with after discussing our favorite cocktails bars and mixologists in the city. If for no other reason, we'll be back just for him. Once we sat down at our table, we were blessed with yet another member of the Rouge Tomate staff. Being a wine place more than anything else (they have a master sommelier on staff), all servers here are clearly rigorously educated on all things wine. Our waiter let us compare a number of wines side by side, which was informative in a number of ways. This place offers almost 30 wines by the glass (basically unheard of) so that allowed us to try a bunch more than what we would've had otherwise. What we settled on: Riesling, Bloomer Creek, ""Barrow Vineyard Reserve"", Finger Lakes, NY Grenache Blend, Laurent Charvin, Châteauneuf-du-Pape, France Merlot / Cabernet Franc & Sauvignon, Domaine du Pech, Buzet, South West, France Carignan, Laurent Tibes - Clos des Camuzeilles, Fitou, Languedoc, France. A number of the wines here are ""funky"", meaning they don't taste like your typical ""wine x"". If you like to get a bit adventurous with your beverages, you can easily do so here at your leisure. I highly recommend the Riesling and the Domaine du Peche, but all are fantastic.Food-wise, Rouge Tomate serves clean, healthy plates, consisting mostly of veggies and seafood. Pretty much my ideal meal. Everything is quite shareable, so have at it:  Guinea Hen w/ radish / prune / crostini: ALooks like a block of cat food, tastes like heaven. I'd never had this type of terrine before Rouge Tomate, and it's got a fan in me now. Immensely flavorful, a perfect starter.Seatrout w/ uni, Thai chili: AOh boy. Slightly cured seatrout with that decadent uni on top. Four beautifully constructed, well-rounded bites. It's like sushi got an extreme makeover, royalty addition. Light but still immensely flavorful. Mushroom w/ fingerling potato / roasted garlic / watercress: A+Another delicate, refined small plate. Proportions were excellent, flavors were hearty and earthy. Broccoli w/ walnut / maitake / sunchoke / sarvecchio / spelt corzetti: A+Broccoli two-ways, each stellar. Another dish boasting hearty/earthy flavors. High marks for seasonal dishes here. I adore sunchokes and they were delightful here. Don't be fooled like I was, re: spelt corzetti--this doesn't feel like a ""pasta"" dish. It's advertised as ""make your own ravioli"" (they're flat, round pieces of pasta) but only a few come on the plate. And though I hadn't tried sarvecchio cheese prior to dining at Rouge Tomate, a healthy dollop of it came on this plate and it was heavenly. I'm scaling up my ravioli from now on.Tilefish: A+Probably the simplest preparation of the night, but certainly not boring. Perfect texture, clean preparation. Chocolate Mousse w/ blood orange / coconut / lime: A+Though we weren't planning on ordering dessert, we couldn't pass up this fluffy masterpiece. An unbelievable mix of flavor and texture. Crunchy, fruit, creamy, juicy, decadent. Must state again that the service here is sublime. They take hospitality seriously here, and it shines through at every turn.

The service: Most of the staff are perfectly on-point, and the restaurant is staffed very well every night.

The only problem when I was there the other night was that our food took more than an hour to come out. I knew because we were sitting right by the kitchen, and I could see the kitchen clock. We ordered around 7:10 and our food arrived at about 8:30. When it did come, one of the three things we ordered was missing. The waitress said she hadn't heard the order, although I could've sworn she repeated it to us.

2.0,10/30/2016,"I went to Rouge Tomate last night and I have to say that I am rather disappointed. I'll start with the POSITIVE :1- I would like to mention how friendly and professional the young lady taking/confirmation reservations was. I had a reservation at 9:30pm and called the morning to see if she had anything between 8 and 9. She called me the afternoon to let me know that 8:30 had open.... she said she would do her best to find me a spot and she did. It is VERY rare in NYC when a restaurant tells you that and they actually do it. Plus, she was extremely friendly !! She is a great asset for the restaurant.2- The place is very pretty and well decorated.3- The chicken liver dish is their best one4- Our waiter was nice, professional and customer service orientedNEGATIVE :1- Reading the reviews on yelp, I had very high expectations about the food. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but it was not anything exceptional. The venison is good but not outstanding. Very disappointed by the mushroom dish because it tastes too much like mayo. Likewise, the cocktails sounds amazing on the menu, but I tried three, and again, it was good but sounded a lot better reading them rather than drinking them. 2- I am sure that the whole dinning experience would have been better if we had not felt left out. Next to us, there was a couple of French Tourists (I live in NY but I am also French). They politely asked the waiter if someone spoke French so they could be explained the menu. Someone, whom I believe is one of the managers (If not the manager) showed up as he was French. He was very polite and started to explain to them the menu.... I was listening as it was interesting to me to learn more about their products.... Then the manager offered them a ""welcome drink"" and gave them a glass of Champagne or Sparkling Wine. How nice of him ! Do I get one if I speak French to you as well ? However, it started to become a little awkward when he treated them to a full wine tasting experience. I think at some point, they had more than 4 glasses of wine tasting on their table. Even the French lady (who knew I could understand the whole conversation because I had spoke to her previously) was looking at me a little embarrassed everytime a new glass would arrive on her table because she knew I was totally understanding what a great treatment they were receiving. We were not expecting anything for free, we can afford a glass of wine... it is just not very classy to give a special treatment to the table next to you speaking in another language without thinking that someone else may understand you. If you want to give a welcome drink and a wine tasting experience to some customers but not all of them, then do it discreetly ! It is  like waiting on line at Starbucks the customer in front of you is being offered their coffee while you have to pay $5.

Beautiful space, great service, huge wine list, menu-to-impress, good food.But it seems Rouge Tomate 2.0 only uses typical NYC ""recipes"" on how to run a ""perfect, trendy"" restaurant in the city. Which makes it boring and without a touch of originality. No-risk, play-it-safe attitude... except maybe for the snails in the chicker liver appetizer ?They have venison. They have snapper. They have mushroom-only dishes. They have acorn squash. They have Bourgogne aligoté. But do they have imagination ?",3,0,0,Benjamin K.,"New York, NY",15,375,555
5.0,10/27/2016,Great new neighborhood restaurant. Concise menu but all of it is seasonal and delicious. The place is beautiful.  The staff is friendly. The wine list is on steroids. Too bad that could not be as concise as the menu. I find Sommeliers creepy - just give us a good list that fits on one page - like the menu. Otherwise - great!  We'll be back.,0,0,0,Craig d.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0
5.0,10/24/2016,"Truly amazing!!!!  My husband and I was such big fan of old rouge tomate, we are so excited to see that rouge tomate finally finds its new home and also so excited to see that it has kept a lot of previous employees. How sweet it is! To be honest, I find that this new rouge tomate is even better than the old one from the food to atmosphere. I love how the menu is set, it is very flexible, you can choose from snacks, small plates, and big plates. Every dish from the different categories is well portioned and also well priced. We tried pumpkin humus from snacks, it was so fresh and so tasty and made such a good start for the meal. Next we had Mushroom, Mackerel and chicken liver from small plates. I have to say I loved all these three dishes, they were so delicious and also had so interesting combination of different ingredients, which made dishes not only tasty but also very memorable. I am fascinated by how creative the chefs are and also just amazed by how they really do everything perfectly right even just for the small plates. The chicken liver is the best chicken liver dish I have ever had in my life. For the big plates, we had ling cod and venison. The cod was perfectly cooked, all the ingredient complimented the fish very well and made it a very delightful dish. The venison was cooked to perfection. It was tender and juicy, loved that it was served two ways, made it more enjoyable. Forget to mention,the drinking menu is very extensive. I guess that drinks is really specialty of rouge tomate. Myself is not a drinking person, but the two girls sitting next to us kept talking about how great the drinks was, and how great selection of the drinking menu had.The service was fantastic! The waitress was warm, professional and on top of things. Manager Rachel and Amir made us feel so welcomed and special, made our dining experience to another level. The restaurant was beautiful, it has two parts, outside is bar room, no need for reservation, very alive, I saw a lot of people hanging out there, seams a lot fun. Inside is the dinning room, very comfortable and relaxing, it is alive but not aloud, you can still enjoy the conversation. It is really a great place for a lovely date, or night out with friends and family. I love how people are just enjoying themselves, no showing off, no competition, no anything pretentious which is very different from a lot of places in upper east side. I can not express how much I love this new rouge tomate. Actually after visiting it, I begin to ask myself, why should I waste my money on so many other places, I should  just go directly to rouge tomate, it is simply the best place to have great meal and great time.",0,1,0,zi x.,"Manhattan, NY",3,189,0

4.0,10/12/2016,"ROUGE TOMATE HAS A NEW HOME!!   SAME DELICIOUSNESS in a warm more welcoming Chelsea venue housed in two landmark carriage houses is what we experienced upon our first visit to Rouge Tomate which  reopened for a soft opening last week. We have been awaiting the reopening of one of our favorite NYC restaurants with bated breath and when we were finally able to pay our friend Pascaline Lepeltier a visit in her new rustic restaurant, we were not disappointed. The more casual, intimate and earthy setting sets the perfect stage for a fun evening enjoying healthful, creative and well-balanced dishes. The wood floors, wood beams and exposed brick and recycled wood walls as well as sleek lines and contemporary furniture and lighting are perfect for the more casual Chelsea restaurant. The downtown address in no way implies that the chefs are more ""lax"". The food remains as terrific as ever. We tried as much as we could on the menu. Everything was delectable with emphasis on local produce and healthful preparations, I cannot wait to return so I can order the MUSHROOM dish which tastes like a more healthful and intricate beef steak tartare, but is vegetarian. YUMM! Hospitality was at its best also. We were very well taken care of by Pascaline whose real passion comes through in all she does, by the very friendly and efficient general manager Rachel and by our server Edgar who was pleasant and on point throughout the evening. The eclectic and one of the biggest wine lists in the city is a refreshing change from many wine lists which feature bottles which are just too pricey. This selection is a reflection of  the soul and passion of Pascaline Lepeltier, sommeliere extraordinaire, who is a wizard at wine pairing! My husband and, I am sure, everyone who is familiar with Rouge Tomate, is looking forward to seeing what she comes up with her wine pairings moving forward!",0,0,0,MICHELE S.,"New York, NY",29,40,0
4.0,10/1/2016,"New American restaurant (w/ hints of Scandinavian influence), serving, according to their webste, ""great food without compromising people's health.""That's the impression that I got after dinner........Very healthy cuisine, but w/o compromising on flavor. Beautiful interior (stunning entrance to the restaurant) w/ open kitchen.Reasonably price menu.Highlight dishes:  Tilefish w/ toast starter, the mushroom, mackerel, and amberjack appetizers.For main, enjoyed the venison & the ling cod.  Enjoyed the venison, served two ways, the most.They even make their sodas in-house; Tried their unique cola, which was very good.Excellent service (Many thanks to Yvette for recommending all the dishes.).Recommend.: 8 calendars",4,1,1,Go B.,"Westwood, CA",57,267,10365
5.0,9/28/2016,"Welcome back Rouge Tomate!!  Excellent decor, outstanding wine list, and as expected, no disappointment with their menu.  As the first to the restaurant tonight during their reopening to the general public, I can assure you everything you remember from the original location is included here in a more intimate space.  Unique and creative presentation, incredible flavor, and well thought out ambience makes Rouge Tomate the top NYC restaurant we remember. If you didn't make it to their previous location, don't miss out on this one.  It is by far, the best restaurant New York has to offer.Food as art",0,0,0,Steve g.,"New Haven, CT",0,12,9
