4.0,4/25/2019,"I have dined here many times, and have had many good meals. Buttermilk Channel is a very nice restaurant that can get a bit loud once it fills up, and can be a bit pricey. I also don't  like waiting on a line to get into the sole bathroom in the place. Try the mussels, they are always tasty, and the toast points are perfect for sopping up the juice. They frequently run a steak special that is overpriced, but tasty, and wines by the glass can be great sometimes. I keep going back.",0,0,0,Randall M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,37,0
5.0,4/23/2019,"Where can I possibly start?  From the moment you enter this place, the amount of natural light filling the room makes for a beautiful dining room.  The bar is to the right, and is truly a bustling spot.  I've been twice: once with girlfriends and the second with a friend and fellow blogger.  I'll share my review for both visits because I am OBSESSED with buttermilk channel.First visit:We came for lunch on a Friday.  Glad we had a reservation bc the place filled up quickly.  We ordered several items and were absolutely impressed by the quality of the dishes.  We ordered the grilled cheese, whipped ricotta toast, buttermilk chicken sando, and a side of veggies.  I had the grilled cheese (because I'm a kid at heart and grilled cheese is amazing) and it was so delicious.  It had apple and bacon and I was in HEAVEN.  I tried the fried chicken which was perfection, as well as ricotta toast.  We left with full bellies and smilesSecond visit:We came for brunch on a Sunday and it was so crowded ( no reservations on the weekends, so come super early!). I sat at the bar and chatted with the kindest bartender, I believe her name is Lauren.  She comped my glass of Prosecco which is the ultimate act of kindness, and my friend arrived.  We were seated rather quickly (within 10m of her arrival).  We ordered buttermilk biscuits, sausage with peppers and onions/egg scramble, pork chop, and the warm cinnamon bun. Holy Toledo Batman! This was just as delectable as my first visit.  The buttermilk biscuits were so moist, flaky, and a perfect amount of fluffy.  The eggs were scrambled to perfection too. The cinnamon bun was made of a cloud of warm, sweet drizzle, and my friends porkchop was tender and juicy.I'm already planning a third visit, more than likely sooo because I don't want to share anything. Also, pricing is quite perfect, and the service is incredible accommodating and kind (hi Elijah!) Cheers to you Buttermilk Channel",0,0,0,Morgan R.,"Brooklyn, NY",187,46,72
3.0,4/17/2019,I came here with reservations on a Sat (highly recommended) with a group of 6 ladies for a celebration. The waitstaff and vibe was really nice and we all enjoyed the experience. They even had a vegan option which was nice yet it had almost no protein (a spoon of quinoa?) so 2hrs later I was starving. Savagely hungry. After dinner we headed out to a location nearby where there was no food options (vegan or not) so I was a bit stuck. I thought I'd top the meal off with vegan ice cream from VanLeeuwen but that was sold out so everyone else shared desserts. I'd say as a vegan I wouldn't come back but the non-vegans seemed to enjoy and really love the options. When walking in the restaurant there had to be at least 1-2 chicken/waffles on every table so that's most likely a really popular entree people come for.,1,0,2,Candy B.,"Forest Hills, NY",403,385,187
5.0,4/17/2019,"While meeting up with my sister and brother in law for a trip to Europe, we decided we should see our last night home with some good ol American Fried Chicken. This was an amazing choice. Since we went on a Tuesday night, it wasn't too busy. They have a great selection of tasty specialty cocktails and wines. Our server was friendly and prompt. We started with homemade pickles and bacon maple almonds. I will admit that my sister and I weren't so sure about the almonds, but they were scrumptious. The pickles were delish too. All four of us ordered the chicken....best choice ever. The portion was huge. It was not overly greasy and was super crispy. The meat was so juicy and tender. You basically get a half chicken and a good portion of coleslaw. The coleslaw was light and crispy. Needless to say, we were all stuffed and happily so. I'd definitely recommend this place!EDIT: I forgot the cheddar waffle!!! I dunno how,  because I hate all of them. Added a little syrup and you're in heaven.

4.0,4/15/2019,"Had dinner on Saturday evening, it was the first warm Spring day and outdoor seating was an option in which was a must. I met with the hostess on the inside which was bright and noisy, but not too loud.My date and I were the only ones outdoors in casual wear though dressy attire is nice. Service was absolutely wonderful, I definitely enjoyed our server. We did get a cocktail (Lucha Vavoom, tequila/honey/lemon) which wasn't what I call 'on the strong side' but matched well with the AMAZING meal we ate.I ordered the mushroom-barley veggie burger topped with thinly sliced bread and butter pickles, a cabbage slaw and french fries. Honestly the best veggie burger i've ever had. Split with my date was a grilled flat iron steak. Prefered on our end was rare style.

5.0,4/1/2019,"Came here on a Sunday for brunch at 11am, and was quoted 1 hour wait for 4 people. The restaurant is rather small, with tables kinda on top of one another - definitely not a place to bring a stroller, in fact, they ask for you to leave it up front. There are also a few tables in the patio out front (less of a wait) and bar seating (first come, first served). The wait list is never ending here, it was one party after another coming into the restaurant. I believe they do take reservations, but we didn't realize until after we arrived. Finally after about 1 hour and 20 minutes, we were seated in a larger table by the front of the restaurant. We ordered their homemade pickles to start, and their buttermilk pancakes to share. The larger long pickles were delicious however, I wasn't a big fan of the ones that were sliced in thin pieces - they were very saturated in this tangy tasting pickle juice. The buttermilk pancakes came in an order of 3 super fluffy and delicious pancakes with a dusting of powdered sugar, served with butter and syrup.For the entree, I ordered the fried pork chop with cheddar waffles. It was a large piece of breaded pork chop, not too dry, and well seasoned. The cheddar waffles paired perfectly with it, just the right around of cheddar and not too heavy of a batter. It was also served with a small bed of greens. I tried my friend's mushroom scramble and it was pretty delicious. The scramble was served with a piece of hash brown that looked super crispy. I tried their classic Bloody Mary - the menu states it's very spicy (it's really not). The bloody was very thick and tasty. It is only served with a piece of pickle - no olives nor the works. They have another Bloody Mary option that is served with an east coast oyster sitting on top of the glass - it looked rather interesting. I will probably try that next time. Definitely one of my new favorite brunch spots in NYC. Highly recommend - just make sure you make a reservation!",1,0,0,Monica C.,"Brooklyn, NY",319,101,139
3.0,3/31/2019,"Gotta be honest, I do not understand the hype. Am I missing something? Hour wait. Average food. I'd compare it to good airport food. We had the salmon plate and grilled cheese with a side of biscuits. Not memorable.",0,0,0,Meryl D.,"Half Moon Bay, CA",0,4,0

4.0,3/14/2019,"My boyfriend and I shared an order of the hash short ribs, fried pork and cheddar waffles, a side of bacon and a single pancake. The portions were fairly large for my small stomach. In reality we could have probably just shared an entree with the two sides. The short rib hash were pretty disappointing. The highlight of the dish was probably just the two fried eggs. The rib was dry and had no flavor. The hash was just little pieces of potato. The next time I dine here, I would definitely skip the hash and probably just order an appetizer, the fried pork with cheddar waffles a side of bacon, and a single pancake.",1,0,0,Kristy C.,"New York, NY",420,132,60
5.0,3/11/2019,"I don't know if I've ever had a dish that was so good it made me angry, but the Pecan French Toast here did that. Angry because after my first bite, I didn't understand why I hadn't eaten it every weekend since moving to New York. It is a ""where have you been all my life?"" type dish--delicious, ethereal. Of course it's not good for you, and it's so rich I would recommend you bring along a dining companion or two and split it, but good lord, order it.The rest of the experience at Buttermilk Channel is just as good. I've only been there for brunch, but have eaten across the menu--from the scrambles to the grilled cheese--and can honestly recommend everything I've had.It is a wait, particularly if you show up at peak brunch hours (say, 11:30 onwards). There isn't much of a waiting area, either, but the waits are generally as advertised, and the weekend maitre d' is one of the nicest people I've ever met--genuine, welcoming and proactive.

1.0,3/11/2019,"This has been one of my favorite places to dine in Brooklyn because of the menu and it was the place I met the great love of my life, until yesterday. Having ordered our meal and enjoying a side of Hash Browns until a hair was the first of my disappointing experience. While the manager came over, he was rather flat in his apology and made no offer of a guest recovery until my partner interjected the fact that this issue resulted in me not wanting to continue eating my meal. Further points include, One, we only saw our server twice and the second time was him dropping check and you really don't even want to know the observations of the kitchen and the actions of the entire crew including the Chef.   I know, as an Executive Chef there are many challenges in this business but it is my absolute undeniable responsibility as the last hands and eyes on every single plate to ensure and exceed every guests expectations.",1,0,0,Miles T.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0

4.0,2/26/2019,"I had really high hopes for the pecan French toast after reading all the reviews but my sister and I were disappointed. My first bite of it was a letdown. It was way too sweet and indulgent for me esp since it was literally drenched in a pool of syrup. I feel like I gained 10 lbs and 4 cavities after eating this. On the other hand, the pork chop and cheddar waffles were surprisingly good. The pork chop was sliced thick, crisply breaded and seasoned well, and cooked perfectly. I didn't taste too much cheddar in the waffles but I think it was made with a corn meal batter which was an interesting change in a good way. I'll have to return for dinner to try to chicken and waffles!If you come here definitely get the buttermilk biscuits!! $6 for 2 of them that comes with butter and strawberry jam. They're huge, crispy on the outside and super soft on the inside.",1,0,0,Katy X.,"New York, NY",217,83,175

All the food that came out around me looked delish as well. Downside: The wait was close to an hour (arrived at noon on Sunday) but Lisa (who greeted us pleasantly at the door and we later discovered was the owner) made the wait enjoyable by offering us coffee and/or cocktails. If/when I'm back I'll come towards the beginning or end of the brunch rush (which was hard to gauge because even at 2pm there was still a steady crowd!),2,0,1,EarthaStarr P.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,191,42

4.0,2/11/2019,"Came here with some friends before heading to Other Half at the advice of basically everyone.I got the ABC Grilled Cheese and a walnut sticky bun, and my friends both went for short rib hash. All of our meals came with a sort of mixed green side salad.The sticky bun came out first, and was every bit as warm, gooey, soft, and sweet as hoped for. It was also much larger than expected, given the $4 price point.My sandwich was really, really good. The bacon was deeply smokey, and the cheese nice and rich and salty. The apples and aioli were less noticeable forces, though they added a subtle sweet/tartness and richness, and were excellent complements. On top of that, the bread was perfectly crisped. Though I don't typically enjoy salad much, the side salad was actually pretty good. I do, however, wish they had listed on the menu that the side a salad as I probably would have subbed it out for something else since it seemed they had many other better, more filling/indulgent sides.I did try to the short rib hash and thought it was OK though not amazing.

While our waitress was collecting our menus, my husband asked to have a side of fries added to his order. She replied ""WE DON'T HAVE RICE"" so quickly, we didn't have the chance to correct her before she turned on her heel and left to put our orders in. Uhhhh excuse me? Just because we're Asian doesn't mean we have to have rice at every meal. I was so offended and shocked that this would happen in Brooklyn in 2018, but I guess there are insulated pockets in even the most cultural cities. I get that she simply misheard, but it's the underlying prejudice that I perceived behind her reason for mishearing that offended me (husband was too nice to mention it). It's a shame; we live down the street and their fried pork chop really is delicious, but this experience left a bad taste in my mouth.

My mother had the rib hash she enjoyed it but me personally when I tasted it I felt like the ribs hash was pretty dry. The waffles from the pork chops were pretty good such as soft and fluffy which made it more enjoyable.

3.0,1/2/2019,"Service was a bit slow, and our server was pretty unenthusiastic and slow to attend to us, but I'm used to this in NYC. In terms of food, we ordered the popovers, sweet potato soup and lamb salad. The soup was incredibly sweet and must have had added sugar/honey in it, as it was literally the sweetest sweet potato soup I've ever tasted. The popovers were interesting in texture, nice and soft, but a bit too salty as they had been sprinkled with large pieces of rock salt (which stuck to the honey) - it would have been better to have the honey/salt on the side in my opinion. The lamb salad was fairly nice. The lamb was very well cooked and fell apart easily, and the cauliflower was nicely roasted, however the salad as a whole was also way too salty. Overall, the food wasn't terrible, but I think the chefs need to tone down the over seasoning, as it could have been great if not for the over sweetening/saltiness.",0,0,0,Review S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,1

We'll definitely be adding this to our brunch rotation.My family was in town from DC & Baltimore on the weekend after Thanksgiving so I wanted to take them to eat lots of yummy food while in town. We came here for Saturday brunch because as soon as I read ""Fried porkchop & cheddar waffle"" out loud to the group, they were sold (in fact, clamoring to go is a better way to describe it).Half of us ordered the porkchop & waffle and the other half ordered short rib hash and the Eggs Huntington. I wanted to get the Portland but, since my boyfriend was getting it, I know I'd get to eat some of his so I went with the Eggs Huntington because I was super intrigued by the biscuits.The fried porkchop and cheddar waffle was the absolute star here. Everything else was really good too but the porkchop was UNBELIEVABLE. The most tender pork with a perfect crispy shell paired with a savory and fluffy waffle perfect, for soaking up maple syrup. YUM. Also the portion was huge but everyone finished that bad boy right up!We also got the Star of the Sea Bloody Mary.

We were quoted 20-30 minutes when we first arrived at 1 pm or so on a Sunday, and the wait ended up being close to twice that (even more frustrating was the fact that we got a text that our table was ready and then had to stand awkwardly in the foyer for another ~20 minutes or so). Likely as an ""apology"" for the wait, we were brought over a walnut sticky bun before our meal, which was delicious and large - would definitely get again at $4.For our mains, my boyfriend ordered the pancakes ($12) and I had the short rib hash ($16). He also ordered a cold brew and sides of bacon and biscuits; of the three, only the biscuits came. The bacon was forgotten altogether, but the cold brew made it onto the check which we had to get taken off.  Short rib hash was meh. It was extremely, extremely dry,but did have a good flavor to it. The fried eggs on top, however, were cooked perfectly. Portion size was a little smaller than I would have liked.

The waffle however was on the soggy side. Still a great dish but a crispier waffle would be better. The duck meatloaf was not as good. I understand duck is kinda salty already but this meatloaf needed less salt. The mashed potato/corn sauce provided some sanctuary from the salty meatloaf.

The pork chop was freshly fried and came out piping hot so the coating was still nice and crunchy. The meat was flavorful and juicy (a little too salty but went well with the sweetness from the syrup). The cheddar waffles were very cheddary indeed. Not sure if I can justify paying $18 for this again but it was good.House made pickles: This is a must get it if you like pickles, especially bread and butter pickles. It comes with an assortment of pickles and went well with the pork chop.Pecan pie French toast: A lot of reviews raved about the french toast so I had to give it a try but it was just alright to me. The first couple bites were good but I wasn't the biggest fan of the texture since it resembled bread pudding more than toast.

I ordered the ABC Grilled Cheese, which is a grilled cheese with apples, bacon and cheddar. I mean, how can you screw up a grilled cheese??? Well, we now know. The cook did not ever cook the sandwich on the grill!!! He/she/they took two pieces of stale wheat bread, two plain old thin apple slices, barely cooked bacon and a massive hunk of cheese and smushed it into a panini press. The cheese was completely uncooked and not at all melted, the sandwich was not even buttered on the outside, the meat was practically raw and the apple slices were not even seasoned! They looked like those crappy sliced you get from a bag out of a kids meal at McDonalds. WORST GRILLED CHEESE EVER! I paid $14 for something that I could have made at home for less than one dollar. Not only that, it was served on a plate with a MASSIVE (and I mean massive) pile of pickles. There were more pickles than sandwich. 6 giant pickle slices topped with thin slices of pickles. Who in their right mind eats a sandwich with a bowl of pickles? There was a ""salad"" on top of the pickles, by that I mean 5 leaves on top of my pickle pile, which had so much salt on it that it was untouchable.

But this place is Not very good. It has a great atmosphere, but the food is too over priced and the food tasted very poor. Now when I say the food tastes poor, I should had said that the food just tasted like Salt. I have never had so much salt in a meal before. Hell the salad that came with my eggs Benedict tasted like a whole packet of salt was mixed in with it. The eggs Benedict was just Ok.  It was cooked right. But yet again the eggs were so salty. I don't get heart burn often, but once I got home I had to go buy some Tums and then I vomited .  Way too much salt that it has made my stomach unsettled for 6 hours now. Next the price of the meals, etc were way to over priced. I wanted to get a waffle on the side of the meal which was $6. When I got it. They only gave me one half of a waffle. I asked the waitress where the other half was and she said that that was how they serve it. Come on now, how cheap and greedy can a place be to only give a customer a half of a waffle and charge $6.

4.0,8/11/2018,"One of the perks of NYC Restaurant Week, is exploring new neighborhoods and discovering new dishes.After my preliminary research online, I read that this American bistro in Carroll Gardens is best known for its ""duck meatloaf and buttermilk fried chicken with cheddar waffles."" Why not? I have had chicken and waffles before, but I love to see how chefs reinvent this popular dish. It was packed inside. Given the anticipated downpour, no one risked dining outdoors. We were warmly greeted by the hostess and server.If you want to read the menu, bring a flashlight. I am all for ambiance, but not at the detriment of my eyesight (especially since I wear glasses). Even with the candle on the table, the lighting was way too dim for me to order. Thankfully, I already knew what I had in mind for the $42 prix fixe dinner. It was a three-course meal - appetizer: market greens salad (mustard greens, peaches, radish, black olives & shallot vinaigrette); entree: buttermilk fried chicken (cheddar waffles & savoy cabbage slaw); dessert: mini pecan sundae (vanilla ice cream and whipped cream).Delicious. I will admit, I was a bit hesitant about the cheddar waffle and  maple syrup mixed with balsamic vinaigrette. When that entree was placed on the table, my eyes grew wide lol at the large portion. Delicious meal. Great service. Full tummies. All smiles. Even the bathroom was nice, neat, and spacious.I thought it was nice to see how much they value customer feedback when the server handed me a comment card, but that just isn't my style.

(see picture attached).  It was pretty salty fora me...in short a 2 star as they didn't screw up my sunnyside up.  Now for Huntington Benedict.  It was okay for my hubbee which gets a 3.  Service was great.Over all a 3 star and can give it another try if I I will be in the area.  Owner is very nice as well as the staff.,1,0,0,Sherie S.,"New York, NY",5,189,74
4.0,8/11/2018,Finally made it our here for brunch (and in general). We got there right at 10 and walked in right when they opened. I enjoyed the food I I got which was the grilled cheese. My wife got the short rib hash and I wasn't really as sold on the taste of that dish. Though she liked it. The cinnamon roll is so awesome. I also really liked their biscuits. Really big and fluffy. I also got a local beer on tap. The selection wasn't huge but they had a few good choices even on their limited beer list. The bathroom was nice. It was a private one but there was only one and you could tell people were irked at the long line. I'd come back here  to try dinner for sure as their kitchen is cranking out a lot of good looking food.,0,0,0,Jonathan I.,"Brooklyn, NY",61,88,85

There's a coffee place a few doors down if you want to sip while you wait.The whole restaurant is super cute and has a southern vibe, with the wooden interior design. They have a good sized menu for brunch, and we got what seemed to be the most popular items. They also have a few different bloody mary's to choose from.Bf got the pecan pie french toast, I got the short rib hash, and our friends got the fried pork chop with cheddar waffle and one of the scrambles.I enjoyed all the dishes!- short rib hash: lotssss of meat with fried eggs on top and toast. Not too salty, but a little heavy if this is all you're going to eat. I suggest sharing or splitting with a sweet dish-pecan pie french toast: suuper soft and creamy! the bread must be soakedddd before cooked. Again, I could only have a few bites of this because it's pretty sweet.-fried pork chop with cheddar waffles: delicious!! I highly recommend this. I'm a sucker for cheddar waffles, so I really wanted to get this dish but the whole thing just sounded a bit too much for me. I had a few bites from my friend though and it was just enough!!

I was completely turned off by her poor demeanor but figured the food was always good here so it'll be worth the wait.

I said we were waiting for our drinks and she said ""well do you want to wait for another table since you're not ready?"" I could not believe it! Are you kidding?? why not offer to seat us and have someone just bring our drinks over? My husband ended up waiting behind and just brought it over. Was the food delicious? Yes.

However the food was very mediocre. Among four of us, we were able to get all the items interest us. The fried pork chop was okay, incomparable to any katsu place in the city. Probably shouldn't compare with Katy's, but the texture and flavor was just meh. The pecan French toast was too sweat, and so soft in my opinion. But the first bite was fine. The short rib hash was probably the better one we got, but nothing memorable. And the lamb salad, which was the reason why I picked this place to try out in the first place, taste like left over.

Now on to the good stuff..the food was delicious. I had the grilled cheese and it was yummy, not breathtaking but a solid choice. Someone in my party had the French toast and I had to say this was the highlight. Next time, I will most definitely get this dish with the syrup on the side. My boyfriend had the eggs Benedict and he also said it was a solid choice. The drinks were also good and strong. One star down is simply because of the service.

My sister unfortunately had hers undercooked, asked for another, and still got another pork chop undercooked. I'm sure this is a strange anomaly, for 4 others of us who ordered it had ours well done.The atmosphere was very hip.

I wanted to try the pork chop and the pancakes as well but I settled on the Short rib hash and was offered a single pancake to try out as well for $4. The pancakes are huge so one might have been a good number to go with and complimented my choice well. Everything hit the mark and had a nice presentation.A wait is likely on a weekend, but the surrounding area has some nice shops to poke your head in while you wait so it cuts down on the standing around waiting.

I always wanted to try this restaurant for brunch but dinner works just fine! We sat on the long table in the middle of the restaurant - I honestly thought it would have been a bigger space but it was pretty small. Everyone ordered either rose or cocktails, which were okay but pretty pricey for small glass. Funny thing was that when the waitress brought some drinks to the table, she spilled one entire drink on my one friend who did not order any drink and left him soaked. They were pretty apologetic about it.We ordered beer-steamed mussels, brussels sprout and french fries for the table. The mussels were good, we loved dipping the bread into the sauce. I'm a sucker for quality fries - they were good but just a bit too salty. No complaints about the brussels sprout either, they were perfectly seasoned. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken over waffles - it was pretty good. The fried chicken wasn't overly breaded but it was a little dry. I loved the waffle, it was fresh and wasn't soggy. The order of chicken and waffles was bigger than I expected - I wasn't able to finish it. I tried my friend's burger - it wasn't bad but nothing special about it. The staff was friendly especially with bringing out the cake we got our friend - they sang happy birthday with us and all. The service wasn't bad.

However, Buttermilk Channel is one of few brunch places that have me looking forward to the weekend.At 11am on a drizzly Saturday, there was already a wait to be seated. Thankfully the 20 minutes passed quickly and soon enough we were ready to feast. We ordered the roasted mushroom, spinach, and goat cheese scramble, the fried pork chop and cheddar waffles, and the pecan pie French toast.- Roasted mushroom, spinach, and goat cheese scramble: For me, the winner of the meal, which is saying a lot given that this is simply an elevated take on scrambled eggs. By that I mean the eggs were pillow-soft and the mushrooms perfectly juicy. Even the side salad was more than just an afterthought.-Fried pork chop and cheddar waffles: An alternative to your standard chicken and waffles, the waffles were wonderfully savory to pair with the sweet maple syrup. The pork chop was perfectly cooked, we made sure to clean off the meat to the bone.-Pecan pie French toast: I rarely go down the sweet route, but we were feeling gluttonous on this day, and we were rewarded with this dish.

2.0,6/13/2018,We read the reviews and traveled in on a Saturday night excited to try this place.  1st and foremost the value for the money is one of the lowest places in Brooklyn. The place is mega loud and the seating is extremely uncomfortable. The food was ok -- but the service was extremely slow -- took over an hour to get our food -- and then when they served my burger the committed the ultimate no-no -- I order the burger without cheese -- and they served a burger where they had apparently made it with cheese and then scraped it off -- and my medium burger was well done -- most likely why it was taking so long.  When you are charging $20 for a burger -- you should be able to get it to the customer as they ordered. Throughout the evening -- we had to flag the server down for refills on our drinks -- it was a total bust.  I think this restaurant is living off a reputation it no longer deserves.,0,0,0,Steve M.,"Montclair, NJ",106,168,100
5.0,6/9/2018,"This is one of my favorite American restaurants. It continuously delivers on classic American fair. The burger is made up of a thick Patty. It's nicely charred on the top and juicy in the middle, as its cooked to temperature. This is one of the prime examples of what a gourmet burger should be. The burger comes with a generous side of fries which are nicely salted and crispy on the outside and soft in the middle.The fried chicken and waffles are amazing. The best part of this dish is the sauce. It is a sweet vinaigrette sauce. It acts like a maple syrup substitute. The sauce even goes well with the fries.The best part of visiting this restaurant is the desert. The pecan pie Sunday is off the hook. It is served in a glass with layers of pecan pie alternating between vanilla ice cream topped with homemade whipped cream. The whole dessert is very creamy and rich yet you can finish it between two folks.

The syrup isn't overly sweet and the french toast was so fluffy and warm. My mouth is watering just thinking about how delicious this was!Eggs Huntington ($14)- I would give this dish a 3/5. The egg was cooked to perfection and the ham was lightly salted. The ratio of this was a little off and I just wished that there was a liiiitle bit more ham because it was sliced pretty thin. As for the buttermilk biscuit, there was a little to much biscuit to egg/ham ratio.Fried Pork Chop & Cheddar Waffles ($18)- The pork chop and waffles came with maple syrup. The pork chop was very crispy and it was packed with a lot of flavor, however I'm not sure it was worth $18 though. I had an okay brunch experience at this place but after the Pecan French Toast, I am sold on coming back again.",3,1,2,Julie C.,"Queens, NY",61,141,356

From the service, to the food, to the vibe - it was an all around wonderful experience.They do not make reservations for brunch on the weekends! As other reviews mention, I highly suggest arriving earlier than planned to anticipate a wait to be seated. If the option to make a reservation is available, definitely take the opportunity! - I came with a party of 5. When we arrived I gave my name and the kind hostess took my number. She said the wait is about an hour and that I would receive a text when the table was almost ready. The wait was worth it, trust me!We ordered the following: Buttermilk Pancakes, Eggs Huntington, Bibb Lettuce Salad, and Fried Pork Chop & Cheddar Waffles. All were exquisite. The highlight was the pancakes. They are so fluffy and delicious. I haven't had pancakes that soft and fluffy in so long. The wait to get the food wasn't too bad considering how busy they were.Our server was awesome - super nice and helpful.

We had 2 orders of short rib hash (in which we both agreed was not that great) we also got an order of the cheddar waffle which was great.

I chose to get the fried chops with cheddar waffle and i think it was okay. I wasnt entirely mind blown however...this is why the 4 stars instead of 3...i tasted their buttermilk pancakes and their french toast (from my sister and husband) - now those two were pretty delicious!

4.0,5/14/2018,"This brunch spot has been on my list of places to try for a long time so I finally got to try it out with my fiancé for our 7th year dating anniversary back in January 2018. We came on a Sunday around 11AM-12PM since our dating anniversary landed on a Sunday this year.  The wait was around 30-45 minutes. Parking was a bit of an issue because we just had a snowstorm a few days prior to our dating anniversary and there was a lot of snow.The restaurant has a homey and somewhat cozy atmosphere to it. The service was on point and staff is friendly. Since it was a freezing day, I started off with a cappuccino which I thought was amazing and superb! My fiancé got an iced coffee. For entrees I ordered the Eggs Huntington (buttermilk biscuit, poached eggs, Hollandaise sauce, lox and accompanied with Field Greens). It's originally suppose to have Benton's Country Ham, but I substituted it with lox instead. This was probably one of the best combinations I've had of eggs and lox because I have had it at different diners and brunch spots before and it just never satisfied my tast buds. The poached eggs were poached just perfectly and the Hollandaise sauce was just right! Field greens went very well with the entire dish.My fiancé ordered the Fried Pork Chop & Cheddar Waffles with Poorfarm Maple Syrup which looked massive and delicious! The fried pork chop was seasoned perfectly, had a slight crisp and moist texture to it. The cheddar waffles were soft, fluffy and didn't have an overwhelming cheddar taste/flavor to the waffles.Overall, a cute and comforting brunch spot minus the fact that there's a long wait. I would most definitely like to come back for brunch and perhaps enjoy their outdoor seating area. I would highly recommend coming here for brunch/comfort food and it's located on a nice and quite area of Court Street. So definitely worth checking out!",8,1,3,Jessica D.,"Brooklyn, NY",564,847,2210

And what a cute restaurant - loved the decor. I read a lot of reviews that expressed the astounding service but I didn't find anything remarkable. Maybe it's because I've come to an expectation that people can be... you know, nice. Not to say our service was bad, because it definitely wasn't. I loved our meal and our experience but I found this place to be overpriced - hence the four stars.

5.0,5/13/2018,"(I'm basically ranting about their great customer service)This is my second time visiting this restaurant, but my first time here for brunch. I went on Mother's Day without a reservation and I was told that the wait would be two hours for a table for two or sooner if I wanted to sit at the bar or outdoors. Even with the long wait I give them a 5/5 not only for their food but for the overall service. Here is why:1. The hostess was amazing! She had 100+ people on her list. I am sure it was a stressful situation but she handled it extremely well. She remained kind and professional. She'd check in on people who were waiting and made every mom feel special with a greeting. 2. My waitress was lovely and attentive but not overbearing. She delivered our drinks promptly. A pet peeve I have is when I am waiting forever for the bill, another forever to pay the bill, and a finally forever to receive my card/change back. That was not the case! 3. THE FOOD. Simply put the brunch was delicious and their mimosas were perfect. I was afraid that the drinks would be watered down and that the food would be rushed. But that was not the case. It was the best brunch I've had and I consider myself to be a brunch snob lol.

The service is warm and friendly.  Service is solid.  The restaurant is candlelit and definitely charming. We have eaten at the bar and in the dining room. If I'm with just one other person I prefer dining at the bar.  Tables for two are actually too close together for my liking. Tonight, we ordered pop overs, chicken and waffles, duck meatloaf, a huge steak with disco fries and a green goddess salad. All were ample, tasty and satisfying.

4.0,5/3/2018,"Been planning a trip here for 2 years. I've tried twice for a weekend brunch and the line was too long. This time I was there when they opened. It was one of the first good weather days of the years, so we sat out in the sun and had plenty of space on the patio. A bit of nice warm coffee to get us started and we were ready to eat. Tried the classic Bloody Mary and antipasto bloody as well - both with great flavor and well worth the cost. At the price you're probably not diving in for a full on boozy brunch. For entrees get the cheddar waffle and pork chop. A thick juicy chop on top of a savory waffle. Thought they'd give a full waffle, but it's only half and much smaller than the chop. Also had the short rib hash. The short rib was ok and a nice mix in for the eggs. Came with a side of nice grain toast as well. Service was a bit on the slow side but it makes sense once I saw the tons of people inside the dining room.

5.0,4/30/2018,"Buttermilk Channel's food and service were out of this world amazing. We walked by here on a whim on Saturday night and saw the large crowd forming outside. We checked online and saw that there was actually a reservation available 15 minutes later, at 8:45PM. Score! We came back after having a drink nearby & were welcomed by the hostess. She told us that our table was eating dessert and would be done shortly. (Meanwhile walk-ins were being quoted over a 45 minute wait......check online vs walking in people!) We were escorted to the bar to await our table and ordered a couple of cocktails-The Honey Suckle Rose (gin, sparkling rosé, lemon & honey) was smooth but also kicking my butt. This drink packed a punch. My husband loved the Fox 8 (Gin, Dolin Blanc Vermouth & Sales Aperitif). Though we ended up being seated past our reservation time, the hostess was above and beyond at informing us what our estimated seating time would be. Once seated, service continued to be very efficient and detailed. I asked about gluten free menu options and was told in detail what there was. We ordered an appetizer and our entrees, and shortly after we received a bite of house made pickles as an apology for our extra wait time. Since I had told the waitress I was gluten free, they brought these especially. This attention to detail was much appreciated. These were fantastic. Our next course, the beer-steamed mussels (cherry peppers, celery leaves, green olives, & grilled country bread) was spectacular. This soupy goodness contained endless flavors after every bite. These were some of the most succulent, juicy mussels I have ever eaten. My entree, the Pan-roasted arctic char, with crispy polenta cake, concord grapes & jalepeno brown butter was at the level of delicious where you want to just drink it out of a straw. This was many levels of perfection, from the perfectly done fish to the amazing textures and flavors in the polenta. I'm normally a super slow eater but devoured this baby quickly. My husband had the duck meatloaf  which was also friking ridiculously delicious. The entire dining experience was just so amazing here. I really felt as though the staff cared about us during our visit & it was amazing. I can't wait to come back to Buttermilk Channel for brunch or other occasions.

No balance on the plate at all, it was absolutely not something you can eat a whole plate of because you'd feel sick afterwards. I had the salad which had nice fresh ingredients but was extremely vinegar-y. Again, lacking some balance there and all I could taste was the bitter and sour shallot vinaigrette.

The food: For me it was just average,  nothing to really brag about.  The presentation can surely do with improvement (food was  on an oval plate which I think needed to be bigger so food don't fall off, eggs were in a lil cup that you would put olives in); the taste was like ok I paid my money so might as well eat some of it (however I must say the French toast and Pancakes were definitely good, only 2 things that was truly enjoyed by our table ).At our table we had mushrooms with scrambled eggs , Lox with scrambled , Eggs Huntington and Lamb Salad, French toast and Pancakes. The toast that comes with your Omelette was like one sandwich cut in four pieces and then you get 2 pieces.

The toast was a bit too hard for me so it was difficult to chew. The eggs I could not eat because if tasted way too fishy.

4.0,2/25/2018,"I'm giving them 4 stars because my first visit last July 2017 the food was really good. I had the pecan French toast and it will not disappoint. However, this time I opt for the pork chop and waffles (chicken & waffles are only for dinner time) and it was very underwhelming. The most disappointing part of it all was that it was super salty. My friend had the same and they kindly sent it back. But when it returned it lacked taste. So we gave up. We didn't make a fuss but I gather they would have been pretty helpful about it. Prior to this I had an old fashion at the bar at 10;30am. Judge your mom! The service here is great and rather small. So the wait can be long but worth it for the pecan French toast and pancakes.",1,0,1,Jemima C.,"Washington, DC",173,175,208

Boar ribs with grape potatoes were roasted and stewed in a rich mustard tangy bbq sauce with compote. Finger licking good. Oh my.The popovers and ribs on roids should've clued us into what a bellyful meal we were about to partake...That buttermilk fried chicken and cornmeal waffles with That balsamic ""crack"" maple syrup... my oh my.

The menu is a bit limited - special scrambled eggs, pancakes, waffles, and some other sandwich lunch type food. Overall the food was delicious - the only thing that bothered me was that the side bread was hard as rocks lol. Other than that the best thing to be honest was their pancakes + their music selection.

We came there for an early dinner with our toddler, it was pouring rain, we walked in 4 minutes before they opened (literally at 4:56 pm) since the door was unlocked so we thought they were open. The hostess says, ""We're not open yet!"" and literally shoves us out of the restaurant into the rain and locks the door. The hosting staff is despicable! And that, to me, speaks volumes of the owners since they actually hired her - especially into what is supposed to be a neighborhood, family-friendly restaurant. Utter disbelief.

It came in this cool loose leaf glass and it was nice because when you go to other places it's a tea bag and that's all you get but you really get a nice size of tea . I had the one of the scrambles the house cured lox with green onions and cream cheese . It came in a little bowl mug which was really cute . It came with salad hash brown and toast . What I loved about this meal it was hearty , it was seasoned to perfection and just so good . Even down to the salad. I also had a walnut sticky bun .

Both were great. We also ordered a side of bacon which was very good, and a side of biscuits. which was MASSIVE. it comes with 2 and honestly i could have split one and been just fine.coffee was okay, not great, but not bad.Overall, a very pleasant experience.

The skin is very crispy and the meat is so soft and juicy. The slaws is fresh and some hint of spicy. 2) grilled cheese sandwich- I think is ok not bad but not special.3) side of fries- just regular friesOverall in my opinion this is the place for fried chicken sandwich!

2.0,9/24/2017,"Just had brunch here with my boyfriend. He's been here once before a few years back. He told me it wasn't as great as everyone said it was but wanted me to judge for myself. Especially since I had this place bookmarked for sometime now. So we finally went today..The woman put in our name & told us a 30min wait or more but they will text us when a table is ready. It was pretty hot & since they only had 2 fans going we decided to go cool down somewhere else. We went about 5 blocks away to get some orgaic juices. 45 min past, no text so we decided to walk back. The woman must have forgotten b/c when she saw us, she reacted as if we just walked in for the first time, she got us a table though. So always check in, don't rely on that text, you may not get it. I've read about the sticky walnut bun, so l ordered that & my boyfriend asks what l thought. I said it's dry, too much cinnamon & no walnuts & barely any glaze. He said ""that's exactly what l thought when l ordered it last time l was here"". So strike 1.We ordered coffee & an iced coffee (if they had simple syrup to sweeten up the iced coffee). The simple syrup looked like water (not syrupy like it should hence the name). I had tasted my coffee before l used that & before l poured in the milk. It tasted horrible so l thought let me add those & see if it still sucked.. it did. I asked my boyfriend what he thought of his coffee, he says ""it's really weak & tastes bad"" so we called our waiter over & had him take'em back & we just stuck with water. Strike 2!Then l ordered their popular Pecan Pie French Toast, which was not bad, although mine had a smoky bacon taste to it so l'm assuming they put it on the same stove plate as someone's bacon. Not good for Vegetarians! *So you Vegetarians beware*. Still not bad & definitely better than that sticky bun! The Bf had 2 poached eggs on ham & toast w/a side of salad. He said the poached eggs were over done & the whole thing just tasted mediocre. Where are all these great reviews coming from??I went online for the bathroom at the end of our meal, the line was in view of the kitchen & l saw one of the chefs (who had a long beard but NO BEARD NET, yuck)...he grabbed a pancake (with his bare hands)..from a pile of an already cooked pancakes to heat up. l guess for whoever ordered pancakes, l'm glad l didn't order those! We definitely wouldn't come back, especially with that long of a wait, to be let down with the food.

5.0,9/19/2017,"So last Saturday I died and went to brunch heaven!!! Literally. I had one of the best brunches I've had in a long time. It was one of those experiences that had me smiling and rubbing my belly all day.For quite some time now I've wanted to try buttermilk channel but walking by and seeing the weekend line has made me shy of the situation. I decided to finally give it a go as I couldn't resist their photos here on yelp.I came on a Saturday and showed up around 12:15pm. I was told it would take about 40 minutes to be seated which I was fine with this time around, I gave them my number and they said they would text when a table is available. About fifteen minutes later I got a text and bam I was in! So just a tip, give it a try you may get a table sooner than the expected wait time.I ended up ordering the pancakes, the short rib hash and a sticky bun. To be honest after I ordered I was worried I chose the wrong thing as the amazing french toast kept being served around me, (next time I'm trying it for sure it looks incredible)Well, let's just say I was not disappointed at all!Where do I start?....The sticky bun was sooo good. It was not too swee,t so it was enjoyable every single bite. It was soft chewy and had just the right amount of icing on it.The short rib hash, it was more than I expected. Loads of short rib with hints of potatoes here and there served with a bed of greens and mini toasts topped with two sunny side up eggs. I can still taste it now, it was so flavorful and everything on the plate complimented one another The pancakes....three fluffy, buttery fresh cakes served with the lightest and most perfect syrup I could have imagined. They were probably the best pancakes I've had.All in all I will 100 percent be back, probably in a few days as I can't wait too long to experience the goodness againAlso, the staff were all very nice!Oh wait....i also got a side of bacon.....best bacon ever!!!

I guess except for the volume levels of conversational patrons and tight bar seating. After all, it is midday Saturday brunch service.Onward to the food... I've been meaning to visit this place for quite a long time. Luckily, I now live nearby. I woke up this morning with a craving for American food, so I decided to give it a go. I ordered the Eggs Huntington and a side of Cheddar Waffles. It was good. You can definitely taste the freshness and vibrancy of the ingredients; the delicious buttermilk of both the biscuits and waffles; the richness of the eggs and hollandaise; and the beautifully light, tangy dressing on the greens. I commend them for sourcing locally and ethically, which probably justifies the price. The plates came kind of room temperature, though.The service was okay. The hostess was quite lovely. The light-skinned server at the bar, not so much. I guess that's hipster Carroll Gardens for ya!Would I return? Perhaps. Not for a while though.

4.0,9/8/2017,Overall Buttermilk Channel provides a pretty good dining experience. My wife and I visited shortly after opening one day because I read that they can be a line outside depending on when you visit so we wasted no time. Buttermilk Channel has been in my bookmarks for a while and so I was amped up about this meal. Walked in we were greated by a friendly hostess who showed us to our seat and followed by our waiter. Menu was provided and we ordered. I got the fried chicken that was raved about in the reviews along with a side of fries. To drink I had a beer off tap. When my meal came out it not only caught my eyes but also the family who was just seated next to us. Presentation is perfect. Food was amazing. I was so full I even had to get a take home box. I definitely recommend the fried chicken meal when visiting but other items on the menu also sound amazing. Four stars instead of five because they can surely improve on the sauce that comes with the fried chicken and the menu prices that surely did add up.,3,0,0,Brock S.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",51,191,278

I had the lox for brunch and it came with a side salad- the salad was great!I would come back sometime. I don't understand why people wait in line for hours to eat here. They actually have a little crowd waiting outside on weekends before it even opens. Tip from a resident in the area: if you go before 1, there's no line.

On the other hand I knew I wanted chicken and waffle no sides no appetizers and a glass of wine to tingle my taste buds. For the price the chicken and waffle portion is appropriate.

The dessert is banana pudding and pecan pie sundae. The banana pudding is just okay for me, it is like a puree banana with cream and popcorn, too sweet for my palate.

Why you may ask?...Because that is exactly how delicious the french toast tasted while having Brunch at Buttermilk Channel!-lol. It was the epitome of food greatness but I will come back to that in a bit....Buttermilk Channel is located in the Carroll Gardens section of Brooklyn which is quite a quiet and neighborly place. We decided to come here for brunch after I went on Yelp and saw all of the fantastic looking food in people's postings. Once we arrived at Buttermilk Channel, we were definitely able to confirm not only great looking but fabulously smelling food! I will never be able to verbalize just how wonderful the aromas were that emanated from the various dishes. All we did was ooh and aah at every single plate that went by us....It is a true testament to them having a extraordinary selection of options on their brunch menu!The friendly hostess informed us that we will have to wait about 30 minutes, however we were probably seated in about 15 minutes which was nice. Buttermilk staff provided prompt service as we received water, napkins etc. quickly. Thanks to Allison and Laura for being so lovely!Ok....so I had the Pecan Pie French Toast w / side of bacon. I have to give Kudos to Chef Chris because that Pecan Pie French Toast is two of the best tasting buttery pieces of french toast that I have ever had! Crispy around the edges and soft, fluffy goodness in the middle. Oh my.....the syrup and marvelous pecans that complimented the french toast made it perfection throughout each and every bite!

But what really left the bad taste was the surly, incompetent service. Admittedly, we were a large group. But we'd made a reservation the day before and had been counseled to come in two groups. So we did -- and no reservation had been communicated to the servers. They seated us, grudgingly, then treated us with ""attitude"" the whole meal, as if our $200+ expenditure on a slow Wednesday was not worth their time. One meal was never delivered, and when the guest mentioned it to have it removed from the bill, the server was openly rude.

The chicken is a must - perfectly cooked and served with amazing coleslaw and cheddar waffles - but everything else that I tried was also incredible. The ice cream here is Van Leeuwen (one of my favorite ice cream spots) so we got to enjoy that in our sundae, which paired nicely with our hot apple dessert. Would give this place 6 stars if I could.Note to self: return to try the duck meatloaf and pork chop that everyone's going on about.Edit 6/2017:Brunch was just as great this time! I repeated my order and added a side of biscuits as well. They were awesome but definitely not necessary on top of everything else. Fried pork chop and cheddar waffles were simply phenomenal, as was the eggs and hash dish.",1,0,0,Gab G.,"New York, NY",208,1651,5011
3.0,6/24/2017,Do not get any salads ! They are very overpriced and nothing special. I had received 4 pieces of lettuce with massive amounts of feta cheese and shreds of bacon. The price was $14. Not worth the money.,0,0,0,Alexsandra G.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,9,3
4.0,6/24/2017,I just came here for brunch and the maitre d' (who I think was the owner by the way she treated us) was very nice and accommodating. I am not a pork eater but the fried pork chop (which I got because they said the buttemilk chicken was only offered for dinner) was very good. The cheddar waffle was also good although I was disappointed to see that it was only half of a belglan waffle (the amount of food was sufficient but since the menu didn't say half then of course I was expecting the full thing like most other places. I think this should be stated under the entree description.) My dining partner had the short-rib which they were very happy with (I tasted it and also thought it was very good). We got biscuits on the side which were filling but rather plain and dense- I could have done without these. Overall we had a very good meal with courteous and timely service; I would recommend it.,0,0,0,Ana D.,"Manhattan, NY",2,106,166
5.0,6/21/2017,"I came here for one thing and one thing only: buttermilk fried chicken! I got the chicken sandwich and it was filled with generous portion of fried chicken pieces, a mound of vinegary rough cut cole slaw, three pickles, and a garlic mayo sauce. They were served as two halves and you the customer are left with the challenge of assembling the chicken sandwich tower without it toppling over. It was amazing! Better than chick-fil-a. Better even than shake shack. The chicken was tender and juicy with a pleasantly crispy batter. The cole slaw was excessive and drips out as you eat the sandwich. I ended up eating the remaining slaw with a fork after I demolished the contents between the fluffy yellowy buns. Service was great and friendly too.

4.0,5/26/2017,"Guys this review is SO LATE. We had a gorgeous brunch at Buttermilk Channel  on December 4th 2016, after an all-nighter that began with a light supper at The Good Fork, a Bon Iver Show at Pioneer Works, and then a late night dinner at Prime Meats, followed by hours of whiskey and cards until day broke. I haven't written about this experience because the whole time is sort of blurred together as one contiguous hedonistic stream and maybe I've only just recently recovered from the epic hangover I accomplished but don't judge y'all ok? A Bloody Mary or two, the morning after a big night, fixes all. And when the Marys are freshly made, stuffed with crispy, salty and assertively flavored garnishes, served with compassion and tenderness, one's faith that another day will be had is restored all that more quickly. I know you're nodding. I know you've been there. After a brief wait (because we chose to eat at the bar, if you're targeting a table, be prepared for a longer wait), we each ordered a Classic Bloody Mary and got to feeling human as we chose our mains. I had the house-cured lox plate because I'm a sucker for fried capers yet had I been feeling less ""fragile"" I would have ponied up to the warm lamb & romaine salad with roasted cauliflower and olive croutons--because you guys FRIED CAPERS!!! are featured in that dish as well. As it stood, I needed something that had nursery elements like rye toast and cream cheese. Good grief it was delicious. The fish was delicately cured and served with said fried capers and a few tomato and red onion slices. By this time I was having coffee and smiling brightly. All was well. My dining companion chose the Eggs Huntington because he is completely focused on biscuits. Perhaps a little obsessed with biscuits, if I'm to be honest. Anyway. Who am I to judge? Friends, when Hollandaise is made well it's glorious, right? Sunshine-y gold, silken and just a tiny bit sharp, either with lemon or white wine, emulsified into melted butter, yolks, a splash of water and a bit of white pepper. Guys. The Buttermilk Channel Hollandaise is the Daenarys of all Hollandaises. This sauce was so fierce two additional sides of it were ordered. Two. And were eaten with a spoon. Also, the eggs were poached perfectly so the yolks spilled over just as they should on the generous serving of ham. This is not a dish for a weak appetite, be warned. And you must speak ""biscuit"" to do it justice because otherwise what is the point? A few words on ordering: we noticed that people were not fooling around here. This is a multiple dishes kind of place. The couple next to us had three sides, three mains, a couple coffees and were making steady work of what seemed to be a pipeline of martinis, while softly discussing desert choices. #Goals, right?!  What I'm saying here is that even though there are salad options to be had, one comes here to get one's eat on. It's expected. I suppose we were sort of disappointment to our server as we didn't order desert, but come to think of it, we ran hard with the double Hollandaise sides so I believe we scraped by with a modicum of BMC brunch dignity. Btw, the vibe is very pleasant. The service is super efficient and cheerful and the clientele bond together united in the sheer joy of tucking into what I think is one of the best brunches in town. Can't wait to go back for that warm lamb and romaine salad (with fried capers!) after a full night's sleep. Maybe see you there!",2,3,3,Pritha R.,"Brooklyn, NY",53,123,8
1.0,5/22/2017,"In a search for a new brunch spot we went to Yelp to find a new hype spot to try. We landed on Buttermilk Channel and thought to ourselves ""how could 1k+ people be wrong?!"" So we hiked out and did the whole hour wait to see just how delicious this place was. Boy, were we sadly underwhelmed. We got menus 20 mins after being seated and only because we asked someone who was not or server for them. He was confused because he came to our table to drop our Bloody Mary's off and asked if we had in fact ordered them. We said yes we did. Then he giggled and said of course why wouldn't a brunch spot have bloody Mary's and placed them on or table. That was the nicest encounter we had had during our whole visit.Or actual server visited our table once prior to that to pour our water, took our drink order, and then he left his metal pitcher of water on our table not the normal carafe of water that all of the guests get placed on the table. A few moments later after getting our drinks our server came and finally took our order. The encounter was really brief he came up to our table and asked if we are ready to order and we ordered.When our server dropped your order off he asked if he could get us anything else we said yes pepper and hot sauce please. He returned with the hot sauce and forgot the pepper so he had to return with the pepper again. Later we asked for an additional knife because my friend and I agreed to share our orders so we needed an extra knife to cut through the pork chop. We never received it. I ended up using my butter knife to cut through it.Here is the food review:*Bloody Mary (original) was extra salty and the only flavor I could really taste was the peppercorn *Eggs so fried I had a hard time cutting them up because the bottoms were so tough from being over cooked * The brisket dry & bland. No flavor. Not even a small bit of flavor from cooking in it's own fat. Just dry meat. * I had three pieces of potato in the entire hash* The waffles were comparable to any diner waffles that I've eatenThe pork chop was good but nothing to really write about glorifying it. *The best part of the meal was the syrup for the waffles and that's not worth treking forSo all in all service wasn't great, food wasn't stellar, and I really don't see a need to go out of the way to make this a destination. I'd rather get a diner breakfast for 2 @$30 then a flavorless meal for 2 @ $60 here.",1,0,0,L. M.,"Brooklyn, NY",23,64,121
3.0,5/21/2017,"Awkwardly... my boyfriend told me about this place from a date he was on yearssss ago. Being that it was a nice day and they have outdoor seating I decided to give it a try. He ordered a burger and I decided on the chicken with cheddar waffles because I saw multiple people saying it was good. The food is huge. His burger looked so juicy and when he cut it in half it was cooked just right. My food came with balsamic maple syrup which I did not enjoy and had a difficult time getting it out the bottle. The chicken was not dried up, but it was bland. The cheddar waffles was okay, but i felt the syrup did not mix well with it. If we do come here again I will definitely just get the burger or if i come for brunch, the chicken sandwich.",1,1,0,Tamara L.,"Brooklyn, NY",119,41,29

4.0,5/14/2017,"Brunch in Brooklyn on Sunday + Mother's Day 2017 = one hour wait but worth the taste, sense the flavor of American cuisine.  One hour wait, at the bar counter, going solo as an independent spirit was no exception to the wait.  My bill states ""solo"" for one guest.  I am weary from a hard and difficult work week but my spirit was strong, positive and unbreakable with great defense.  I search for a deeper meaning in life as I continue this journey.  Upon my departure I overheard from a patron who was standing outside waiting ""the wait is two hours"" as getting here early is a greater chance for a lesser wait.  Buttermilk Channel has a country feel, cozy phlegmatic ambiance which is very bright, homey during the daytime of white wall panels and exposed brick.  I can imagine be it very intimate for couples at night.  Customer service and hospitality is attentive and professional.  The hostess was very informative and kept cool to triage the wait and new arrivals in an orderly matter with a tablet.  Brunch classic staples as eggs Benedict, chicken and waffles, French Toast, rib hash, hash browns, fries are offered and, of course, Mimosa and Bellini.  Buttermilk Channel modified the classics by upgrading chicken and waffles with cheddar waffles and fried pork chops covered in maple syrup while poached eggs, biscuit, ham and Hollandaise are a delicious upgrade to the traditional eggs Benedict.Pecan Pie French Toast $13 - Bourbon, molasses and toasted pecansA southern version of bread pudding which I believed it tasted spiked with bourbon and sweetened with molasses topped with toasted pecans.  The bread was harden on the outside which my knife was unable to cut through. The toast is pie shaped of triangle dimension.  There are no fresh fruit accompanied with this entrée.Hash browns $5 - an addition of two round slightly burnt hash browns with ketchup accompanied.  The inner potato filling was comforting.Bellini $10 - perfect pairing for brunch.One unisex facility is available for the entire business, thus watch your time and be mindful of the line.  All major credit cards are accepted.  Business cards are available and pstrons receive a comment card to make any critical comments as well as the option to be on their email list.  Buttermilk Channel is refines brunch where folks flock to respond the calling.  Come for the biscuits, come for the French toast, come for the eggs - stay for a quality meal.",5,7,7,Tina C.,"Queens, NY",2001,4196,9889

However, it is absolutely worth the wait! If you want to avoid the wait, I suggest trying to come as soon as they open. I got here about 30 minutes after the opening time and was able to snag the last bar seat. Eggs Huntington- These were just okay. I feel like it should have came with a thick slice of ham rather than the thin slice.

5.0,3/7/2017,"My friend and I decided to go here on a whim because we couldn't decide where to eat brunch on Saturday afternoon. We usually grab food in the city but since we were both already in Brooklyn, we saw how many reviews this place got and wanted to try it out for ourselves.Because it was freezing outside, we only had to wait 20-30 minutes, but we were immediately greeted and felt welcome. The host and servers were really sweet even though it's probably always hella packed which made for a great experience.I got the pork chop and cheddar waffles. AMAZING. This dish made Buttermilk my top brunch spot. My friend got their version of lox benedict and she thought it was good, but i found it too salty and buttery. Then we shared some buttermilk pancakes because... that's the name of the restaurant sooooo duh. We were not at all disappointed. They were super fluffy and delicious and legit soaked up all the syrup mad quick. I will say the portions were good and worth the price, since it's average NYC brunch prices.

After the food arrived and the waiter asked if everything was alright, he never really came back. It took a but to get my water refilled. Got the fried pork chop and cheddar waffles. It was delicious. My only issue is that my pork chop wasnt cooked and still pink in some areas. This may be because it was very big. My boyfriend got the same thing and his was cooked all the way through.  Also got the short rib hash. I wouldnt recommend it. Its not real hash; there were like three pieces of potato in it.

We were a bit late with the whole planning of the event (three weeks out?), and were overwhelmed with finding the right place to celebrate in such a big city, but working with Jennifer was wonderful. She made us feel like family, and she seemed genuinely excited to help us plan our dinner. (Meanwhile, a few other places we queried made us feel like a hassle.)  While we initially had an idea of what we wanted to order for our families, she also made a few very helpful suggestions. When we arrived, the whole table was set with candles and special menus made just for us.  (What a wonderful keepsake!!)  We started off with two kinds of champagne, and a few small snacks/appetizers (pop-overs and pickles... both delicious!).  We had the squash tart to start, and steaks for the main course (both melt-in-your-mouth fantastic), and then Jennifer had planned a special berry tart for our dessert, which she brought out on a cake platter first. The service was superbly friendly and talented, and they made the experience that much more enjoyable.  All-in-all, the food was top-notch, and the ambiance was lively, but romantic.

2.0,2/14/2017,"Went there tonight for valentines dinner.  Not worth the money at all.  Last year we went to Riverpark and spent less money for way better ambiance, way better food, and a much better cocktail list.  First time to this place (and I've been wanting to try it) and it's the last, although the normal dinner menu looks much better.  We had the winter salad (literally 6 slices of various citrus fruit, a few roasted root vegetables, tiny micro greens, and very very little yogurt dressing with no taste so you didn't even know it was there), the squash tart (the pastry was WAY over cooked that when I cut it it almost flew off the plate and table), the vegetarian pasta (this was good with a respectable portion), scallops (delicious with a respectable portion), and the pecan sundae (this was really good).  The apps were horrible, but the entrees and dessert were good (but not great).  The fact that they charge $90 for this meal was ridiculous.  If you look at their normal menu, the same meal would have cost maybe $60 per person including the ""complimentary"" popovers they served (they are $3 a la carte on the normal dinner menu).  Maybe it would have been worth it if the ambiance was better, but this place was crawling with children - most were well behaved, but still, if it's a family-friendly restaurant, then price it accordingly.  We got a sitter, I don't know why it's impossible for other Brooklyn parents to do the same on a special occasion.  If you don't have a sitter, go to Bare Burger like the rest of us.   I expected much more from the place that had the highest priced prix fix menu for comparable restaurants in Brooklyn.",0,0,0,Lori M.,"South Brunswick Township, NJ",4,52,0

There was no wait for a table during Saturday brunch despite the restaurant being busy.The lox is smoked in house. It has a deep orange hue and had a great balance of saltiness and savoriness. The platter came with toasted capers which toned down the flavor of the capers yet added a crunchy texture to the platter.The fried pork chop and waffles was interesting twist on chicken and waffles. The breading in the pork chop was crispy and flavorful. The pork chop came out very juicy. I liked that both of the dishes cake with a small serving of salad.They have a small selection of draft beers all of which were craft options.

5.0,2/10/2017,"One word: Amazing! I was visiting from San Francisco for the week and decided to spend a day in Brooklyn with a friend to eat and shop. We stumbled across Buttermilk while searching for a decent brunch spot and decided to dine in. So glad we did! We were greeted with a smile and the hostess was welcoming and friendly. We were seated immediately, which was a plus. We started with a round of cocktails (which were delicious!) and placed our order for food. I decided to order the Fried Chicken Sandwich and my friend ordered the Hanger Steak Salad in addition to a side of fries and side salad. Our drinks came out soon after ordering, and were some of the best drinks i've had at a brunch spot in quite some time (which says A LOT considering how much of a foodie I am). The bartender was extremely friendly and personable. Our entrees were unbelievably flavorful and the chicken was to die for. The combination of coleslaw, pickles and the side salad I ordered really completed the meal. Everything tasted so fresh! The side of fries were perfect for munching on and sharing as well. As we continued to sip and eat, we were consistently checked-in on by both our server and those who just happened to pass by. As someone who works in the service industry, I know how frustrating it can be to be left alone or even ignored - so i'm thankful I didn't experience that here. We contemplated ordering another round of drinks, since they were just so good, but were running behind schedule, so decided to take our last few sips and asked for the bill. Overall, it was a 10/10 experience for my friend and I. I want to thank the staff at Buttermilk for creating such an amazing and memorable experience for a first-time like myself.

5.0,2/5/2017,"When we first walked into the restaurant and saw how crowded it was we knew it was going to be a long wait. The women who greeted us concerned our thoughts but telling us it he wait would be just over an hour. After killing time for an hour we were told we had a table ready for us to sit at. After looking at the menu we got grapefruit, the walnut sticky bun, and the pickles as our appetizers. The grapefruit was refreshing but pretty sour though I guess that was to be expected. The pickles were a tab sweet but still had that ""pickley"" taste despite the seasoning. The sticky bun was my favorite appetizer by far. It was warm, sweet, crispy on the outside. I will defiantly get it again the next time I come here. For our entrees we got the pancakes, French toast, eggs Huntington, and the pork chops with cheddar waffles. The pancakes were HUGE and fluffy. Though they were nice and crispy on the edges the serving size was so large my sister could only eat 1.5 of them out of the three they provided. The French toast was fantastic though part of mine was a bit overdone. It was hard to cut the outside layers but the inside was soft and warm. It was all topped off was a hazelnut syrup that really brought the meal to the next level. My father got the eggs Huntington and he said it was good. Since he is vegetarian he replaced the meat that was supposed to come with it with spinach; he said the substitution was very good. The only meat eater at the table ordered the pork chops with waffles and their verdict of the taste was that it was ""really good""All in all, my only complaint about this restaurant was how hard it was for me to cut a part of my French toast since it was over cooked but even that small mistake was overshadowed by how delicious everything else was. I recommend this place to people who won't mind a hit of a wait. Also, people who are vegetarian will have no problem finding something scrumptious to order.

2.0,1/30/2017,"We tried this spot out for Restaurant Week and had a mixed experience. The hostess was cold and rude, which was jarring since she kept us waiting by the door for several minutes as she chatted with other diners, giving them hugs goodbye. Seemed like a friendly place, but what a icy reception. When we sat, our waitress darted by several times before eventually coming back to take our drink order. She was also quite clipped, rude, and completely unfriendly. I've rarely ever come to a restaurant and had TWO staffer come out so inhospitable to their diners. She came back and mustered out maybe a handful of words to take our order and then bristled away. Our drinks and BBQ oysters (delicious!) were brought out by other staff who were actually very friendly. The girl who came by to refill our water was also great. We wish we had ANY of those people as our server, as the one we had was ridiculously rude as the night rolled on. She came back to the table behind us to chat casually with them throughout the night, but ignored us as we tried to get more water, drinks, or ANYTHING. We would have loved another round of drinks, but she never came by to ask. Once the food came, we were hoping to be blown away, but sadly it wasn't that great. The duck meatloaf, which we both were looking forward to was dry and bland. The chicken and waffles came accompanied with a balsamic syrup reduction. Thankfully so since the chicken was under-seasoned and the waffles were soggy. The pecan pie sundae was tasty, but the chocolate pot de creme was lacking any real chocolate flavor.I'm not going to paint the whole staff with the same brush, but the hostess and waitress were enough to put us off permanently. The busboys/girl, and I think even a manger (owner?) were great. The food...not so much.

A friend arrived before me and said the wait was going to be approximately 40 minutes, but 20 minutes later she got a text saying our table was ready! Given the name ""buttermilk"", I figured I'd had to get something made with flour or milk here. I got the eggs huntington, their variation on eggs benedict I suppose, and my friend got their buttermilk pancakes with a side hashbrowns. Key note: you can either get the full size of pancakes which has 3 large stacks, or just one stack! It's not on the menu, but my friend asked the waiter if she could get less and its totally doable! One thing I gotta say about the eggs huntington: goodbye overrated eggs benny! They replace your usual english muffin with their homemade buttermilk biscuit and my god. It's a game changer, especially with their's. Highly recommend this!My tried my friend's buttermilk pancakes 15 minutes after it came out, and it was still warm, crispy on the outside, and fluffy on the inside. Imagine your usual pancakes, but with quality. Must be that buttermilk they use lol. Brunch alcoholic drink prices were a bit steep, especially for Brooklyn so I decided to opt out on that.

4.0,1/2/2017,"Not just another brunch restaurant in the Park Slope/Carroll Gardens neighborhoods.Having now been here twice for brunch, with both experiences with the food being just as good as the other, I officially give my nod of approval for the brunch experience here. In my recent visit with my girlfriend, we visited on New Year's Day for brunch. Surprise, surprise -- unlike many businesses where the employees are catching up on their sleep from the previous evening's debauchery, Buttermilk Channel is up and running for brunch from 11am-3pm!On New Year's Day, most of the businesses were closed around the area so it was pretty much an errie and unusually quiet day in the neighborhood .... except for Buttermilk Channel where it was bustling with a pack of hungry (potentially hungover) customers. We put our name/phone number on their waiting list and received a text from them when our table was ready, which was about in 1 hour. Not too bad for a wait considering we arrived at around 1pm.When we walked in, the restaurant was indeed alive and well with brunch lovers alike. We were seated promptly, with which I immediately noticed how close the tables were scrunched up next to each other. A little breathing room between tables would have definitely been appreciated, but we didn't let that tidbit ruin our brunch at all.From my previous experience and current knowledge of the more popular brunch dishes here, my girlfriend and I went with the Fried Pork Chop & Cheddar Waffles, the Eggs Huntington .... and, for good measure, the Pecan Pie French Toast to shre. Honestly, I don't know what we were thinking, but we were in a really good mood so we completely obliterated one New Year's resolution just like that.EGGS HUNTINGTONThis was my main entree and it was a bit disappointing. Just like my 1st time here, it was nothing more than an Eggs Benedict to me. The poached eggs were good and it spilled all over the buttermilk biscuits beautifully, but it left me wanting more. It was just ""OK"" to me. Eggs Benedict lovers will love it, but I'm more of a hearty breakfast person.FRIED PORK CHOP & CHEDDAR WAFFLESThis was my girlfriend's entree and it was absolutely a winner! I had this the 1st time I came here too and the pork chop was fried thoroughly, but the meat itself was tender, juicy and savory. It didn't hurt that there was maple syrup to not only pour onto the waffles, but also onto the pork chop. Each bite of pork chop, waffle and syrup was a bite of heaven.PECAN PIE FRENCH TOASTThis one was the wild card, but overall it delivered. The pieces of french toast were huge and sat in a river of really sweet, but savory syrup. We didn't touch it for the 1st few minutes, which was a mistake. Although the french toast was very good, it was also very sweet and got a bit soggy because it sat in the syrup for too long. If you have a sweet tooth though, then this dish is clearly for you. It has all the components in it to melt your teeth like a sugar cane.To close, the service was quick and prompt and our waiter came back to fill our coffee and water. The food took a bit long to come out, not only for us, but also for the table next to us. To me, it was a bit too loud for brunch as all of the conversations were bouncing off of the walls making it difficult for me to hear my girlfriend talk. However, the food was good and the place was really pumping, which is a good sign of success. Not sure if we'd be back here again for brunch since there are just so many options in the area, but it's a great choice for any one who hasn't been.",4,0,2,Chris E.,"Brooklyn, NY",530,1118,9624
3.0,1/1/2017,"Whenever trying a new brunch place, I always start with trying their French toast because I'm a big big fan of French toast. A soft warm delicious French toast would start the morning just right!The French toast at Buttermilk Channel was relatively smaller portion compared to those at other brunch places.  It was delicious at the first few bites, but even though the portion was smaller I couldn't finish it because I felt it was too much too sweet towards the end. Also, the texture was way too creamy so that it was more like eating creme brulee than eating French toast.And my friend said that the scrambled egg she ordered was ordinary.They don't take reservation, and expect to wait 1+ hour please.Overall, it was definitely worth the try given its popularity on Yelp, but it's probably not worth the wait.",0,0,0,Christine Y.,"New York, NY",110,133,295
4.0,1/1/2017,"Buttermilk Channel is a well known brunch spot in Brooklyn but it's out of the way for me so I haven't had a chance to try it until today, which happens to be New Years day 2017. We arrived around 1:11 and put our names down for a table of four, we were estimated an hour and fifteen minute wait. We were seated at around 2:50. For any well known brunch place in NYC during prime time, that wait is pretty normal. They take your phone number and text you when it's time for you to come back and especially if the weather is nice it's a cute area to walk around. I just suggest having this in mind - that this place will have some kind of wait, probably at minimum like 30 minutes.  All of this is to say, we weren't angry or surprised by the wait, but what was pleasantly surprising was how kind the hostess was to our party. Though we were seated pretty much around the same time she estimated the wait would be, she was super apologetic and even gave our party complimentary drinks. We didn't have to mention this to our waitress after we sat, ordered, or ate, we received the bill and the waitress confirmed at that time the drinks were on them. This service was really exceptional, which is something you don't get at every trendy restaurant in the city, and I appreciated it a lot. The Food - I ordered the short rib hash, my boyfriend ordered the fried pork chop and cheddar waffles. We also ordered a short stack of pancakes to share (because what better way to start the new year?) The good: My eggs were cooked perfectly, the pancakes are seriously divine. The kind of average: I think that my food may have suffered as a result of our table being one of the last ones served (they end brunch at 3 pm) - I felt that my food was over salted, the hash was rather dry and tough, and even the vinaigrette on my side salad was quite salty. The cheddar waffles seemed to be normal waffles, not cheddar ones, or the cheddar flavor didn't come out very well. Also, the pork chop was a little dry and sort of tasteless. That said, for both meals, the perfect bite where you get a little bit of everything was quite tasty, but I can't say that each component of the meal stood out on their own. The star of the day was absolutely the pancakes - slightly crispy but big, fluffy, and soft in the middle - the perfect receptacle for some butter and syrup. I would definitely make the trip and wait again for these pancakes, which are truly crave worthy.   Ultimately, this isn't a place that I may often go to because the distance plus the wait are pretty large. That said, I can absolutely see me craving these pancakes once in a while and braving any storm to get them. The restaurant is cute and the service is really so stellar that I certainly recommend this as a spot for any person (especially a pancake fan) to try at least once.",0,0,0,Elissa H.,"Brooklyn, NY",284,18,39

4.0,11/29/2016,"Came here for brunch this past weekend with a girlfriend of mine. We waited only 10 min for a table on a Saturday which I was nervous based on the wait times other people claimed to have waited. I'm guessing because it was only 2 of us and others had larger groups.I wanted the waffles (I'm a waffle girl) but they didn't have the option for chicken and waffles, only pork chop and waffles and I don't eat pork. So I opted to get the side of cheddar waffles, a side of turkey sausage, and a side of hashbrowns. My friend got the pecan pie French toast and a side of bacon. I must say the food (although the portion size was seemingly small) was AMAZING. I loved the cheddar flavor in the waffles and the hashbrowns were seasoned well. My friend couldn't stop raving about the pecans from the French toast. We were sitting within elbow space of another family and the guy basically sucked the pork chop bone dry so I think it's safe to say that he enjoyed it.

No big deal, but the guy that shows up is flustered and clearly coked up. No ""my name is Jim, yada yada yada"", just kinda rushing the entire thing - we felt like we were delaying him somehow. That really set the tone for the whole experience- while eating we're constantly asked if we're ""finished with that"" while we're both mid-meal, by him the busboys- we're not eating slow at all. Also, at this point in the evening there's plenty of tables open but also plenty of other customers there too - not like we were keeping anyone there. We've both NY'rs who've waited tables before and don't expect too much - staff at this place are seriously a little rude. Nice wine list  - but food was weak.

I had the pork chop and cheddar waffles. The waffle portion was very small, pretty much half of a waffle. It was fine, basic. The pork chop lacked flavor and seasoning but it was cooked well. I wouldn't order it again. My partner had the French toast. She sent it back. It was gooey on the inside. Weird and gross. She decided to just get biscuits instead. Biscuits taste like flour only. She had a bite and didn't want it. They didn't charge us for the items we didn't like. Which was good. I didn't try the friend chicken, it's not served during brunch.

It would've have changed everything had we not practically been treated as invisible and had our server been less absent and more considerate of the fact that we waited MUCH longer than a number of the people that arrived after we did to even GET a chance to order our food. We got our food after they got their checks and were prepping to go. NOT ONCE did our server come by to apologize nor explain to us what the hold up had been all about. I think that was what was most disappointing about the entire experience. I understand that things happen and I like to think of myself as pretty considerate but the fact that there was NOT an ounce of acknowledgment for such a long wait is what really made the experience very very subpar and which makes me very very unlikely to want to go again. Very disappointing especially after being so excited to go.

We also ordered some sides, bacon, biscuits and French fries. The French fries were cold. All of the sides were also overpriced....$6 for 2 biscuits (a bag of flour costs $3....). The side of bacon was $7????? It was nice and smoky but undercooked and thin. There is no fresh fruit on the menu........well other than grapefruit and endive....no thanks.

Was quoted a wait of 45 minutes for table of three but only waited about 25 minutes on a Saturday for brunch. Ordered the pancakes, pecan French toast, mushroom/spinach/goat cheese scramble and fried pork chop & waffle. Took a while for the food to come out but we ordered coffee beforehand so had something to sip on while we waited. Everything came out at once and was delicious with a capital D. Pancakes were nice and fluffy sprinkled with powdered sugar. Pecan French toast was the winner, came with two large pieces and a light whipped cream that went great with the syrup that the toast came dipped in. Scramble was good  and came with a salad and small hash brown. Fried pork chop & waffle was huge and well made but we couldn't finish it and ended up taking to go.

I'm moving away from NYC and have been dying to go here for a very long time. I had my going away part in Brooklyn and we wanted to do brunch beforehand. It was a few weeks ago when it was close to 100 degrees, so just totally uncomfortable outside. My friend had put her name in before we got there, so we had a 45 min wait (no reservations for brunch) - no big deal. After getting a drink near by, we were called and headed in to our table. The place is very cute, quaint, very Brooklyn. The food started to come out to other guests and it looked amazing. The Bloody Marys were good - BUT it was hot. AT first we thought we were just cooling down and then I can't imagine the temperature got below 85 at any point. It seemed like the air wasn't working, but everyone was hot, uncomfortable and it was very hard to enjoy the food from there. And while the food was good, it was NOT worth sitting in an UNHEALTHY temperature. The service wasn't good either and no one seemed to care that the patrons were uncomfortable.

Our waitress seemed a bit overloaded with all the tables and I didn't get any coffee refills in the 1.5 hours we were there but otherwise she was nice and attentive.

Other than that, the mussels were good. The bread was completely charred and burnt. For the entrees, we both had the infamous buttermilk batter fried chicken and cheddar waffles w/ sweet balsamic maple syrup. Wow, the savory waffles really balances with the sweet syrup! The chicken was actually succulent and moist unlike experiences with dry chicken meat elsewhere. It was so good! Now we see what the hype and rave is all about! For dessert, Hub opt for the pecan sundae while I had the chocolate pot de creme. Both were exceptionally wonderful but we were beyond full especially after our cooking class. The food is great but the lighting is dimly lit and dark. Except for the candle lit tables and chandelier, it's hard to see the food or the menu. Their brunch looks delicious so we'll def return to try it. As for the dinner, I think it's a good experience. Still, it's a bit overpriced for fried chicken even if it is insanely good.

I was sadly disappointed by the fettuccine and sent it back for chicken & waffles in exchange. When presented with the chicken & waffles I was excited to try it, but yet confused as to why the chicken looked super over cooked. I tasted it and I was super unsatisfied with the lack of seasoning applied on the chicken. The waffle was super salty. I knew it was a cheddar waffle..but still.

The short rib hash with sunnyside eggs on top was delish and whatever they put on their mixed green side salad was so good and a perfect add to the whole dish. I didn't try my cousin's scramble, but she loved it and ate up the whole plate. The pancakes were HUGE to say the least. They were both heavy yet fluffy at the same time with a nice crisp on the outside and super soft on the inside.

It came with a thick piece of toast. The broth was buttery and spicy, perfect for soaking pieces of toast. The entree was a whole roasted porgy fish with pinto beans on the side. I did not like the fish. It was too salty in places. The dessert was delicious: chocolate mousse topped with cream and super thin cookie.There was another highlight to the experience.

I normally sit with my girlfriend at the bar, we feel is more quaint. As we waited for some bar stools to clear up, I decided to order some drinks, that project took 15 minutes, I was never acknowledged or even glanced at so I can place my order.

Fifteens minutes after receiving our menus, we finally get to order our meal. So now I'm feeling a bit excited because I usually go there for the pork chops and waffles and was looking forward to it.

I was disappointed once again, the pork chop was half the normal size they usually serve, there was no crisp breading like it normally comes and the pork chop was extremely dry, really not edible.

2.0,6/23/2016,I really wanted to love you buttermilk channel. But I just cannot. I came here on a weekend with my Best friend that was visiting from Philadelphia. Our tradition is that we must have brunch whenever we go visit one another. The wait was 30-35 mins wait for a party of two however they were full and there were plenty of waiters. Maybe I was just hangry. After waiting in the hot sticky weather for 30 mins we finally got sat down in a tiny corner with a tiny table. Our server took a while to come but he came after 5 mins ish. He started our order with some coffee. First things first thing place only has cocktails and alcoholic drinks no where on the menu offers anything else so I guess you have to ask them what they have. I was super disappointed. The coffee isn't good at all. I ordered the egg Huntington with ham. My best friend got the egg mushroom with goat cheese that comes with hash brown and toast. we shared an order of buttermilk pancakes and a order of cheddar waffles. First of the egg huntington was SUPER SUPER SALTY. I knew the ham was going to be salty but the biscuit and cheese was SUPER SALTY as well to the point where it removed a layer on top of my mouth. As for the egg mushroom and goat cheese it was okay. The hash brown didn't look like a hash brown at all it just looked like a sad piece of potatoe. The cheddar waffles didn't have much taste to it. Just a plain waffle nothing amazing. The best part about this place is the pancake. It was nice big and FLUFFY. YUMMMMMMMMM. The service here is just OK. My cousin paid for the meal so she asked for change back. Waiter gave her a nasty look as if she wasn't going to tip him. but we obviously did a large amount. Then he decieded to smile. Anyways I had higher expectations for this place. Disappointed.,0,0,0,Connie L.,"Voorhees Township, NJ",113,130,75
2.0,6/21/2016,"This place is still packed and I like the vibe, bar, the menu, and in general the service. But dinner the other night was horrible. The server misunderstood one order and though he was apologetic, the wait was 25 minutes to fix the mistake. A cod dish was so wildly over-salted that it was inedible. I'm sorry I didn't send it back. (I never send things back, which is a mistake. But I'd lost my appetite by then.) Others in the group reported over-salting, too. Bad nights can happen, but at these prices... I'll probably be back though because I had good experiences when the place first opened and hope springs eternal.",0,0,0,David E.,"Brooklyn, NY",280,11,0

And that iced latte is probably the best in the area.I've come here a few times and never had a chance to eat here because of the wait, but I gave it a try thinking that the only way to get a table is a table for one. And I did, gladly sat at a table instead of a bar (you'd think they'd seat me at the bar).I originally wanted to try their pancakes cause when you speak of pancakes in NYC, Buttermilk Channel is always high up there in the rankings. But that French Toast caught my eyes and I just couldn't resist, it turned out that it's warm, crispy on the outside, sweet, with a soft texture that melts away in your mouth. It's so buttery. I ordered a side of harsh browns and they were so tasty and crispy without being burning hot. Their staff is quite friendly, even though the hostess could be a little ""cold"" to my liking but she got me a table. :) I am dying to come back for other dishes.",0,0,2,Weili H.,"New York, NY",266,156,134

5.0,5/24/2016,"I have been here so many times and it is excellent every single time. This review will focus on brunch, but their dinner is stellar as well.Ok, let's talk about the food. S#!T it is good. My wife and I consider ourselves brunch aficionados, connoisseurs even, and this is consistently the best brunch we have had in all of NYC. Normally when we go to brunch we have a standard order, split an eggs benedict then split a french toast, because why decide whether you want savory or sweet when you can have both (see, I told you we were experts). The problem is their other savory dishes here are too good to skip. Their eggs benedict (technically called eggs huntington) is what all other eggs benedicts hope they can become when they grow up. First off, it is served on a biscuit and then the biscuit is topped with thinly shaved country ham (it is like they crafted this benedict specifically for this VA boy). Next, sitting atop the biscuit and ham is a perfectly poached egg...seriously...every time is had been perfectly cooked...how is that possible. Next they top the egg with a lemon-y hollandaise, some scallions and just a pinch of maldon sea salt. Simply amazing. I love my wife a lot, so I let her order that.My decision comes down to choosing between the short rib hash or the pork chop and waffles. It is impossible to go wrong here (except that I can't eat them both). The short rib hash has a delicious and tender short rib which is balanced with a hint of sweetness from sweet potatoes, all topped with two fried eggs and paired with some seriously good toast. The pork chop and waffle amps up both the saltiness and the sweetness. A Fred Flintstone sized pork chop smothers a nicely cheddar laced waffle and when you pour the maple syrup on top it creates heaven in your mouth.Because I can't skip the savory dish, we tend to invite along others to join us for brunch. We pretend it is so we can show our friends this great restaurant, but it is really so we can split ""Table Toast"" (french toast shared with the table, it's my own phrase, you can use it just remember where you got it). Regardless of whether you are full at this point in the meal, DO NOT LEAVE THIS PLACE WITHOUT GETTING THE PECAN PIE FRENCH TOAST. Two super thick pieces of, crispy outside, custard-y inside, french toast sit on the plate covered in the most delicious pecan pie sauce (I mean it really tastes like pecan pie) with a big heaping scoop of home made whipped cream. It is so good, you'll pretend that you're just going to have one bite...and then after tasting it you'll be fighting your table mates to scoop up the last bits of pecans.Oh, and I almost forgot about Doug and the great service. All of the servers are pretty great. Plus, on most days Doug, one of the co-owners can be found at the restaurant greeting everyone who comes in with a welcoming smile. If you go, be sure to say hi and tell him I sent you.",2,2,2,Mike C.,"Brooklyn, NY",64,12,7

3.0,5/23/2016,"The food here was good and all, but for the amount of attention this place gets I honestly expected it to be way better. The service was decent, not spectacular but definitely not bad. Maybe it's something more special on account of the wasteland its surrounding neighborhood used to be, but it's changed a lot over the last 5 years so I don't get why there's hours-long waits for this place when the chicken and waffles over at Sidecar on 5th Avenue are *way* better. The same dish is also pretty good over at The Dram Shop on 9th Street. As for pancakes, they were OK here, but again, for the money and quality, Dizzy's and Daisy's are two go-to spots in Park Slope that are pretty unbeatable in comparison, without the hours-long wait.It's entirely possible I just haven't had their signature dish (whatever that may be), but with so many great options close by that don't require starving for hours before being seated, it's just not worth the wait for decent but not incredible food.",1,0,0,Anthony O.,"Brooklyn, NY",21,28,4

Pancakes were really good but not so amazing that I'd come back just for them.Returned for dinner on a Sunday night at 8pm and the atmosphere was quiet and relaxed with candlelight. We were seated immediately. Popovers with honey and sea salt were each devoured in a bit each. Delicious. Husbands mushroom and barley burger was SUPERB!!! He loved it (he's a meat eater and I'm surprised he ordered it no less enjoyed it so much). It was served with their slaw and pickles on brioche bun. Although I didn't care for the pickles (I dislike mustard flavor), I actually enjoyed the slaw which I never ever eat. I ordered the vegetable bowl with ancient grains.

The bf and I ordered a few things to share with our plates, he had the short rib hash and i had the mushroom, spinach scramble - eggs were cooked perfectly fluffy and slightly under done. As sides we shared a cheddar waffle, bacon and hashbrowns, everything was delicious.

1.0,4/24/2016,"So my husband and I arrived yesterday around 7:30 the hostess took my husbands name and told us it would be a 45 minute wait which was fine. We went down the block to a cute little bar called Mini Bar which had some really stellar cocktails you must check that spot out if your ever in the area. Anywho so we have a round of drinks and before you know it its 8:30 and still no call from the waitress about our table which seemed odd. We walk back down to the restaurant and are instantly greeted by the hostess who seemed a little ""disheveled"" and maybe even ""tipsy"" my husband inquires about our table and she says ""oh yeah what was your name Sean right?"" mind you my husbands name is Henry. The Hostess then taps a few buttons on her tablet and tells us she has a table ready for us now no apology just a big ole goofy smile on her face. So basically if we had not walked back into this place we would have never gotten a table because the Hostess totally forgot about us which is a friggin mess. We sit we are greeted we order drinks and food from the waitress and the wait begins. I ordered the Fried Chicken and Waffles and a side of roasted veggies and my hubby got the Hanger steak and whipped mash. We got our drinks and waited 45 minutes for our food to arrive by the time the food got to us we were starving. I mean we had expected dinner at 8 not 10 so we dug in. The  chicken was overly breaded and tough with little seasoning and hardly any meat under all the coating my waffle was cold like it was actually cool instead of warm but I could imagine if it had been hot it would have been pretty good. My husbands steak was good but the portion size was laughable for the price like literally 5 or 6 little tiny slices of steak and a spoon full of spinach. The veggies were pretty good you cant really mess up roasted veggies to much but the large brussel sprouts didn't seem edible so I left those alone. All in all the best thing about the meal was the healthy portion of whipped mash potatoes which now that I think about it did kinda taste like instant lunch room mash, so maybe there really wasn't anything special about the meal at all. When it was time to leave the server told us that she in fact was leaving so her partner would be taking over but he never came to the table and we ended up getting the check from the drunken red headed hostess. We paid someone else and when we left a waitress from outside grabbed our bill off the table and that was that, no goodbyes no ""sorry we forgot about you"" and no ""please come agains"". The bill came to about 120.00 with tip but the food did not reflect those prices AT ALL. I mean for 120.00 dollars I could have went to Sweet Chick and gotten way more food with way more flavor. I was really looking forward to this experience from all the reviews I was expecting to really be wowed but instead I was WTFed instead I mean the food was so sub par the menu prices almost seem like a bad prank. I'm actually really sad I wasted a babysitter, 120.00 and a nice dress on this place. Next time we head to Sweet Chick and get some real food.",0,0,0,April N.,"Far Rockaway, NY",0,9,0

5.0,4/10/2016,"Went here for brunch today with my family, there was a wait out the door ofcourse.. But to me that only means how good the food must be. I do not mind waiting for GOOD food! So our wait was 1 hour long but we are a family of 5 so no complaints!! When we were seated we were immediately greeted by our server. I ordered the eggs Huntington along with a side order of bacon, hash browns and buttermilk biscuits to share. My 2 daughters both ordered the ABC grilled cheese, which came with a salad our server asked if I'd like to change the side to fries but since my kids are pretty good with salad they said they'd rather that! My husband ordered the pork chop & waffles, and my aunt ordered a egg scramble with roasted mushrooms, spinach and goat cheese. Everybody was completely happy with their meals and I had a bite of the ABC grilled cheese and OMG!!!! It was so full of flavor I loved it!

Go on a monday & get their special prefix menu if you're a bargain hunter & want a sample of what this place has to offer. They never fail me & I will ALWAYS go back.

3.0,3/27/2016,"This place is a bit further from my house than i expected so getting here was definitely a trek but i had heard great things about the food so i expecting the trip to be well worth it. We were a party of 4, i went in gave my name to the hostess she told me it was a 40 minute wait and I'd get a text notification. I think this is a pretty cool system. It was a bit crowded at the door during this time; people were adding their names to the waitlist, trying to enter, trying to leave, looking to see where the hostess was at one point i was standing really close in-between a party of 2 eating at the bar. In about 35 minutes my phone buzzed letting me know our table was ready. I like the ambiance of the place, very homey environment. It was fully packed and the noise level reflected that. The customers were a mixed crowd which i always like, lots of families with their children brunching. Our server was very pleasant, quick (for it to be that busy) and accommodating. We ordered; short rib hash w/ sunny side up eggs (2x), buttermilk pancakes and bacon, fried pork chops and cheddar waffle. The hash (my order) was decent, i had to add some salt and pepper it needed a bit more seasoning but i was satisfied with the portion, presentation and overall taste of the meal. The pancakes (my daughters order) were ok, she did not enjoy them too much which made me have to taste them because ""come on 7 yr old they are pancake!!"" but i was with her on it; they weren't that great. The fried pork chop (my moms order) i only had an amuse bouche taste and it was delicious. When i later asked my mom if she enjoyed her response was ""ehhh, it was food so i ate it!"" She was thrown off by the cheddar waffle. I would maybe go another time to explore the menu more. I was a bit underwhelmed this first time.",1,0,1,Cieanne E.,"Brooklyn, NY",160,128,244

We placed our order and received it in a timely fashion, food was warm and looked appetizing. I had the chicken and cheddar waffle entree, which was good but my only qualm was that I felt that the chicken could have been seasoned a bit more it was a little on the boring side. The cheddar waffles though were on point they tasted like macaroni and cheese in waffle form . The place had a good atmosphere, conversation  flowed, music wasn't loud and overbearing.

4.0,3/18/2016,"Came here last night for dinner/drinks with a friend! We got really lucky and didn't have to wait at all (party of 2 on Thursday night at around 8:30pm).ATMOSPHERE: 4 starsVery charming, dimly lit restaurant. Good for date night or just for dinner with friends. Some of the tables were very close together, though, and when it was full, it felt a LITTLE cramped, but what else is new in NY.FOOD: 4 stars- Oysters with Grapefruit Mignonette: the mignonette was great! We ordered a dozen oysters and had a mix of the two types of oysters for the day, one of which was saltier, while the other was creamier. I personally preferred the creamier one, but both were solid selections. Very fresh!- Buttermilk Fried Chicken with Cheddar Waffles and Savoy Cabbage Slaw: AMAZING. As someone who takes her fried chicken very seriously (I'm currently at three meals in a row of fried chicken), I must say this fried chicken was really on point. The portions are rather large -- one wing, one drumstick, and one breast, but I couldn't get enough. The skin is perfectly crispy and peppery (mmm), while the inside is juicy, tender, and all kinds of delicious. It went really well with the savory cheddar waffle -- yum. The slaw was also a great complement to add a bit of freshness to the dish. Highly recommend you also drizzle lots of maple syrup on top of the chicken AND the waffles. Salivating just thinking about this.- Buttermilk Whipped Potatoes: objectively, very tasty whipped potatoes, however I was so blown away by the fried chicken that I kind of forgot about this dish.DRINKS: 4 stars- The Westlake (Bourbon, Elderflower Liqueur & Regan's No. 6 Orange Bitters): solid drink. The elderflower adds an interesting twist, and the drink is strong without being overly sweet. I had two!- Old Fashioned: my friend ordered an Old Fashioned and liked it!SERVICE: 3.5 starsWasn't TERRIBLE, but it did take a while to get our food orders in, and to get the check.PRICE: 4 starsTotal per person came out to $75 post-tax, pre-tip. With 20% tip, the total was $90/person. This includes two drinks each, a dozen oysters, two entrees, and one side, so I felt it was well worth the price tag, especially considering how good the fried chicken was!OVERALL: 4 starsVery solid restaurant in BK. I would definitely come back.

The buttermilk pancakes really are decadent, super fluffy and flavorful although I would have liked some choice of topping (perhaps blueberries or chocolate chips?) It's generally just three very dense and fluffy pancakes with nothing on the side. We also got the biscuits (how can a southern girl not?) and despite the awesome jams and butters that came with it, I was left unimpressed. The biscuits were dry, flaky...dare I say, basic.

After realizing they don't serve their chicken for brunch (WHY), settled on the Fried Pork Chop w/cheddar waffles ($17) and a side of biscuits ($5). The fried pork chop is well breaded, a bit oily, yet substantial. The cheddar waffles pack a punch - crisp, filling, though a bit on the salty end (best eaten with a sauce). The biscuits are super fluffy; presented with jelly and butter that goes altogether well. To wash it down, ordered an overpriced orange juice ($4) - why is every drink here so expensive?Service here is efficient considering the crowds they have to deal with.

I saw and tasted some blood in my big piece of chicken. The cook probably rushed my dish since it was a Friday night and they were busy. Now, I'm ok with having some blood in my steak, just not in my chicken.The waffles that came with my dish were tasty though! Crunchy with a mild hint of cheese.Overall, would I come back? Nah. $27 for a fried chicken dish... I can feed an entire family for less than $27 at KFC if I want fried chicken!! I'm a fried chicken expert and I can tell you that it's very cheap to make good fried chicken. Nonetheless, it was a nice atmosphere, the staff were friendly, and I still had a decent Friday night with my friend here.",0,1,0,Nana Y.,"New York, NY",12,71,41
4.0,1/19/2016,"Great brunch spot. I've been for both brunch and dinner but the Brunch menu definitely stands apart from other places I've been. My husband always gets the Short Rib Hash, which is eggs with perfectly crisp short rib on top, and I get the Buttermilk pancakes, which are the perfect amount of fluffy every single time. The wait time is roughly 45-50 minutes each time I go on a Saturday or Sunday. Go in, put your name down, and stroll down court street until they're ready for you. Its a beautiful neighborhood and the restaurant offers a family friendly trendy atmosphere.",0,0,0,Riki K.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,24,34
3.0,1/19/2016,"Update: Unfortunately they've raised their prices to the point where it's kind of insulting. $18 for 2 scallops? $27 for fried chicken? It's good, but not that good. Also, the service was really mediocre compared to past visits. So disappointing, so taking two stars away.Oh dear Lord, the maple and bacon roasted almonds...I've died and gone to heaven. They always have some solid vegetarian options, but I'm big a fan of the chicken and whatever fish dish has found it's way on the menu. Brunch also never disappoints, and the staff is very attentive. The atmosphere is casual, understated and cozy without making you feel like you're on top of your fellow diners, and I just have to comment that the color of the walls is the prettiest shade of pale yellow.

4.0,1/14/2016,"Aside from having an awesome name (#1), Buttermilk Channel has been a mainstay in the Brooklyn brunch scene for quite some time. But BC is more than just brunch, it is one of the most underrated establishments in the borough with its eclectic menu and its impressive take on refined American cuisine.Brunch is one of the many reasons folks will come, which is a fabulous time to visit even if the wait is long on the weekends. I love the Short RIb Hash ($16) and the Buttermilk Pancakes ($11) are fluffy yet delicious. While the Eggs Huntington ($13) is really a fancier, perhaps tastier version of eggs benedict, the Fried Pork Chop + Cheddar Waffles ($17) is an upgraded version of chicken and waffles. Hash Browns ($5) are also served here but sadly in patty form. Doh.The dinner menu consists of a seasonal variety of dishes grouped by first and second courses. I won't lie, I've been less than thrilled with most of the first course options, but the food in the latter group has been fantastic. The Duck Meatloaf ($28) is exactly as it sounds, but accompanied by a very tasty dirty rice, pickled okra, and pickled peppers. Folks are ga-ga over the Buttermilk Fried Chicken ($27) which is full of flavor and crunch, but the Pan Roasted Hanger Steak ($28) has my attention for its juicy preparation and unforgettable bite. Even the Burger ($18) is one of their better choices, which also comes from super crunchy fries as well.Versatility is one way to describe the cozy interior. It's perfectly bright, homey during the daytime and wonderfully dimmed for an intimate ambiance at night. The service is fairly prompt and professional and the prices are expected for the area. Ultimately, BC is a nice establishment for all occasions, be it a date, celebratory dinner, or the occasional bite while hanging around Downtown Brooklyn.____________(#1) Which is the same name for the mile long path between Brooklyn and Governor's Island.",25,11,12,Jando S.,"Queens, NY",2723,3529,17072

This menu is meat-lovers galore, but still has lighter, vegetarian options for those looking to eat their food's food. They have a solid bloody mary and brunch cocktail menu that hits that sweet spot of offering a nice variety of drinks without being too overwhelming. I personally recommend the Star of the Sea bloody mary - it has properties of a bloody cesar but the celery and peppercorn infused vodka gives it a little extra kick. For food, I got the fried pork chop and cheddar waffles and Friend got the lox scramble - both were delicious. The scramble was rich and filling and came with some extra fixings on the side like toast and potatoes, while the fried chop and waffles left me at a loss for words; the side salad it came with might as well have been garnish in comparison to the rest of the entree.  Totally recommend if you're in the neighborhood.

Loved the sauce and it had this spicy kick to it. It also came with 2 pieces of grilled bread. But mine was a little burnt. For entrees, we both had the fried chicken and waffles. When it arrived we didnt expect such huge portions. It came with a drum, thigh, and the breast with a side of coleslaw. The chicken was very crispy and moist! The cheddar waffles with the syrup was amazingly delicious. The waitress was very nice and attentive. The atmosphere was very cozy and dimly lit.

After reading the reviews, I tried the chicken liver mousse (should have been shared, but I'm a glutton), duck meatloaf, pecan pie sundae, and apple crostata (I shared dessert!).

Chicken was crispy and juicy combined with the sweetness of the syrup and savory waffle, it was reallllly good. The mushrooms had a lemony yogurt which was also really good to cut some of the fattiness from the chicken. Mussels were good and was a large portion but the bread it came with was wayyy too burnt which kind of ruined it a bit for me since I like to soak up the sauce with bread.

3.0,12/2/2015,"My friend suggested us to try their fried chicken, so we all make a LONG trip to Brooklyn. I am so mad because the fried chicken can't even make it to my top 10. It was less than mediocre. I did not like the breading, it's almost like baked rather than fried chicken. This is the kind of place with table cloth and candle light, where you pay $14 and only get 2 ribs. I understand they try to go to the high-end classy path, but don't mess with the fried chicken. When it's called fried chicken, it's not meant to be healthy, so fry that sh** And the meat itself was pretty tender but tasteless. I have to use my hot sauce tactic (hot sauce makes everything taste better).I did like their appetizers esp. Delicata Squash Tart. My friend had the duck meatloaf. It's good but it's not like you gotta take a 50 min trip to try it. For dessert, I was in love with that peacan pie sundae. Their service was super SLOW. It would be more justifiable if it's like a weekend. We waited around 10 min for the waiter to take the initial order and more than another 10 min for him to take our dessert order. In between, it was very hard to locate him. He didn't come and check if everything was ok after the entree were given to us. You want to be a high-end restaurant right?

Fried Pork Chop & Cheddar Waffles $17 - Not a bad alternative from the chicken & waffles. The skin was crispy, but not over-cooked. The pork chop was very juicy and flavorful. You get a huge pork chop but the waffles were small. The waffles sat underneath the pork chop, causing the waffles to be flattened into a pancake. I dowsed my pork chop and waffles in maple syrup. Best decision ever.Short Rib Hash $16 - Too dry and burnt. My fiancé had to use some of the maple syrup for taste. I was expecting something with more flavor, and bigger.

4.0,11/9/2015,"I love this place and the pretty street it's on! I absolutely love brunch and I love Carroll Gardens, so this was the best of both worlds! I'd seen Buttermilk Channel on quite a few brunch blogs and articles naming the top brunch places in NYC/Brooklyn, and I was excited to try it! My boyfriend and I went on a Saturday morning and it was busy. We got a seat at the bar (we wanted to sit outside but didn't want to wait). I like this place because it's casual and great for families. We spend a lot of time in Bushwick and the vibe at restaurants there can be a bit different. This would be a great place to bring parents, family, friends, etc. It's also good for groups! I also really liked the big windows and the light that they let in to the space. We were there on a late spring day as the weather was just warming up, so it was nice to sit in a nice, bright spot! We each got coffee and a mimosa. I got the pecan pie french toast and my boyfriend got the esposito's hot sausage scramble. They were both really yummy! The only thing about the sausage scramble is that it kind of resembled something that you would make in college, like eggs in a cup. The flavor was much better though! My french toast was a really rich and I was too full to finish it, but we switched plates and finished both! I think the menu has something for everyone here, with good portion sizes and prices. I'm from South Carolina and went to college in Charleston, SC, and I felt at home in the atmosphere and with the food!",0,0,0,Elizabeth C.,"Brooklyn, NY",312,147,1088

The chicken on the other hand was not seasoned very well at all.  Portions were large but taste was bland and lacked any character-just a mouth full of crunch!I have had better fried chicken from supermarket hot tables..sorry Buttermilk get somebody to put some heart and soul into the chicken.Oh yeah it seems like everyone in the place had children and babies dining which caused a din of chatter and crying.,0,0,0,Walt L.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,19,0

Here are all the things that weren't to my expectations:1. Daughter's pancake was not fully cooked. Now, when I say not fully cooked I mean it was runny like pudding in the center. Unacceptable. They did make us another and removed it from the bill.2. The French toast was brick hard around the perimeter and soft in the center. Maybe that's how they make it but I didn't care for it since it forced me to only eat the center or crush my pearly whites.3. The egg whites I order were fine, nothing exciting about egg whites anyway but despite they were well done, they oozed with liquid. Gross.4. The fries we ordered were extremely salty- my husband said it was to make up for the tasteless eggs :-)Our waiter and the ambience were nice enough but it was a totally wow-less experience and hubby and I agreed it doesn't warrant a return visit from our family.

Chicken pieces were small and did not justify the price. There were large pieces of pepper that seemed to be used to give the chicken some flavor, but resulted in a floury and peppery mess.

Probably the best bacon I have ever had. The pancakes were so good they tasted homemade and original not like cheap diner pancakes thats are thin and flavorless. The poached eggs over the biscuit was probably my favorite. Im not very creative when it comes to food but the sauce was good and the biscuit was so soft if I hadn't gotten full between all that food and the Long Island Iced Tea I would have ordered extra biscuits. The wait was an hour and a half but it was so worth it and theres enough in the area that you can explore and head back when the host texts you.

Except perhaps the honey & sea salt popovers, which were as scrumptious as they were adorable. We ordered two orders for our party of 5. The inevitable fork battle that ensued over the last one would rival that of the Trojan war over Helen of Troy. The beer steamed mussels are alarmingly spicy, but a nice appetizer to begin your meal.

But what I have tried here has been amazing every time. My personal favorite is the fried pork chop -- which is so large that it is almost sinful not to split it between two people -- served over a cheese waffle. The pork chops are meaty, and the buttermilk crust reminds me so much of my southern mother's crust and version of the fried pork chop. I also have loved the grilled cheese sandwich here. My friends have raved about the eggs benedict. Few restaurants make a Bloody Mary as good as the one here, and my personal favorite is the one made with bourbon instead of vodka. I love that this restaurant texts and / or calls when the table is available. Since I live around the corner, it makes it very convenient for me to come here without waiting around in boredom until a table becomes available.What to improve? The hosts sometimes can be a bit ""bothered"" or perhaps, in their defense, overwhelmed. A little less New York personality, and a little more warmth at the host stand, would keep the experience aligned with the friendliness and goodness of the rest of the place. But that's small beans.

So you should either come early or come later on for brunch. We put our names down before 12PM and didn't get seated til almost 1:30. We went to a nearby tea shop to have a drink before returning for our meal. They text you when the table is almost ready.Now for the food.... SUPER YUMMY.

The ribs were pretty good served on some beans that were very good. (1star)The duckloaf, I personally did not like the flavors, my friends said it was okay just nothing special. The fried chicken and waffles  were way over cooked. If you like crispy fried chicken, it was great. The waffle was also more crispy and not fluffy. Plus I would have preferred it without the cheddar. The service was good. (1 star)We shared a pecan sundae which was ok. The ice cream is good. I ordered a blueberry tart which was bad but they replaced it with a chocolate icebox which was marginally better.  I think when the prices are fairly high, you expect something more.For fried chicken and waffles I would just go to sweet chick in Williamsburg.",0,0,0,Albert E.,"Brooklyn, NY",59,74,3
4.0,8/29/2015,"We've been coming here since we moved to the neighborhood 8 years ago but don't go that often since it's still often too impossible to get into!  We are of the mindset that if we can get in with no wait, great!  If not, we go for plan B since we hate waiting and there are so many great restaurants in the 'hood.  However, I'm impressed that it still has all the hype after all these years.  The reason is because it's such a great experience--from the comfortable atmosphere, perfect servers and hosts--attentive and friendly without being intrusive, and the consistently excellent food.  I only docked a star because I sometimes wish the menu would vary a little more and sometimes the overall menu is a bit heavy for my taste...and a rare once in a while I think a specific dish is just ""good"" but not mind-blowing.  That being said, when I am in the mood, Buttermilk rarely disappoints and is more often than not, perfectly executed!   Last night we went for dinner and I had the burger for the first time in many years.  It was possibly the best burger I've had in the city.  It's definitely the best burger I've had in a long time.  Heirloom tomato, cheese, PERFECTLY cooked medium rare, juicy, flavorful...everything I want in a burger!  We also had the heirloom tomato salad with grilled peaches....wow, so good, my fiancé used his spoon to drain all the delicious tomato/peach juice from the bowl.  They had a special app, squid and cucumber, which were very subtle flavors so were overshadowed by the heirloom tomato salad.  In the past, we've had the chicken liver mousse with pickled grapes to start...omg...just so decadent, creamy, rich, delicious and the pickled grapes are a perfect complement.  Sometimes we'll get a couple raw oysters with the yummy grapefruit mignonette. My fiancé always (Always!! how boring!) gets the duck meatloaf.  Clearly he really loves it since he refuses to order anything else.  I haven't been for brunch in a long time but the few times I've been, I always get the Eggs Huntington, similar to an eggs benedict.  I LOVE a poached egg and these are always perfectly executed. Even though WE don't like to wait in line, I can understand why people do.  This place is the real deal.  If you haven't tried it, definitely also check out the owner, Doug's newest restaurant on Atlantic Ave, French Louie.",0,0,0,Heather B.,"Brooklyn, NY",40,85,62

The food looks amazing, the menu is enticing, and the reviews had me SOLD.

A really good drink that my dumb ass can't remember the name of...2. Half dozen of East Coast Oysters - somebody slap me! whew! that grapefruit topping was clever3. Buttermilk mashed potatoes - never been so happy to commit a sin in my LIFE4. Corn - LISTEN AGAIN...I HATE corn on the cob but the mexican style I can't seem to pass up on.

This chicken was sooooo good it's going into my chicken list I just can't resist. The waffle was ok I would have preferred mine way more fluffy, but I was too focused on the chicken to even give a damn about the waffle :-/. The syrup was tasty as well.6.

2.0,8/23/2015,"We were excited to try the brunch menu after reading many good reviews. When we got there the place was packed which we thought was a great sign. There was a 40 minute wait. They took our name and number and we were told that they would text us when a table was available. We loved that idea since we were able to walk around the neighborhood while we waited. We started off with the coffee which we were looking forward to based on the reviews we have read. Honestly, it was comparable to average diner coffee, which is to say - unremarkable. I ordered the Rancho Gordo Heirloom Bean Stew and my girlfriend ordered the A-B-C Grilled Cheese. The Bean Stew came with one fried egg and about 6 tortilla chips (see pic). I thought it was ordinary as if it was canned beans with some spices added to it, and the portion was rather small. The Grilled Cheese was tasty ( I had a few bites of hers) but the side of salad it came with was small and the dressing was very salty. Service was good from both the hostess and waitress, however, if you are claustrophobic, I would rethink coming here as you will be sitting very close to strangers.May go there for Brunch again in the future since the food that we glanced at on the other tables such as the pancakes and french toast did look rather good.",2,0,0,P A.,"Bloomfield, NJ",5,6,38

The waitress came by once, about 5 minutes before it arrived to hurriedly tell us the food would be out soon. My boyfriend had the bean stew and it was awesome- especially the tortilla chips. I had the eggs Huntington (eggs Benedict on a biscuit). The eggs and hollandaise sauce were great, but the biscuit was hard. I ordered the hand made sausage on the side, but was served bacon.

1.0,8/22/2015,"Biked all the way here for a cute date Saturday brunch. Let me be frank here: food is okay (minus the fact that they don't know how to cook pork), but service ruined it for us. 1. Everyone here just gives zero fucks. It's not like they're trying to insult us. It's just that they're apathetic. Asked for hot sauce from 3 different people; one got back to us in 20 minutes. Waitress doesn't even say hi. 2. Slow service. we did sit outside but it took us about 10-15 mins to get any service,  including water. Damn, it's hot outside, it's summer, I'd like a glass of water please. 3. My boyfriend ordered pork chop and waffles. Half way through, I notice that his pork looks pink, looking like flesh. I call it out to a worker, which took a good 2-3 mins because they don't come outside to check on anyone. He got us a more manager looking guy, who doesn't even apologize and says ""sometimes a fatty part may look pink"". I grew up eating meat all my life. Are you trying to telling me that I can't tell the difference between raw meat and a pink fatty part? He takes the plate away to the kitchen and comes back 5 mins later. Again, no apologies, but just says ""yeah it's just a fatty part. Do you want another one?"" As if he expects us to say no. NO APOLOGIES. how the hell are you even a manager? As I am already done with the meal at this point, my boyfriend says ""no, I was almost done with it anyway."" Manager: ""ok cool."" Walking back in briskly. Excuse me? No sorry? No ""let me make that on the house""? Also, his plate never came back. There was clearly half of the plate already on there. Maybe they were afraid that we will take a picture of it and call them out? Check comes, fully charged for food that we didn't even eat half of, because they fucked it up. Way to ruin my only in-town Saturday brunch date. I couldn't give less fucks about this place. Sorry dudes, you picked the wrong people, too.

5.0,8/20/2015,"Oh, Buttermilk Channel. I've had your delicious fried chicken at Smorgasborg before, but it was a real treat to finally dine inside you. Is that weird to say? Phrasing, I suppose.Anyway, we had a reservation, which was good because the bar area was super crowded with people waiting halfway into our meal. To be expected.Love the ambience here. Unlike some other stuffy restaurants in Carroll Gardens, Buttermilk Channel is more casual (I mean, they're known for their chicken and waffles). It's boisterous, and everyone's having a good time.But enough with the formalities, let's get to the food. I know that's why you're reading this.Started out with the popovers ($1 apiece), which were a nice alternative to just regular bread. There was honey and sea salt, so if you like savory/sweet, you'll like em. Not much crunch to them though, so they were more like super airy biscuits than popovers.Also had the chicken liver mousse to start. I know liver puts a lot of people off, but I love it, and the one here was no exception. It had pickled grapes for some contrasing sweetness and a generous sprinkle of sea salt. Yum.We also ordered the barbecued oysters (which I hear are a southern delicacy). However, they forgot to bring them out, and when I asked our waitress, she was super apologetic and comped them for us. We would've gladly paid for them, but at $3.25 apiece, we were more glad to not. Can't say I'm a huge fan of cooked oysters. I think the bacon totally overpowered the natural oyster taste, but hey, didn't have to pay for em.For my entree, I went with the duck meatloaf over dirty rice with pickled okra. I did not know I needed this dish in my life, but I do. As someone who never had meatloaf until my teens, I've always had preconceived notions of what it is, or how good it could be. This duck meatloaf was better than I could ever have imagined. The meatloaf wasn't too... loafy. You could easily break it apart with your spoon and scoop a nice heaping of dirty rice and loaf into your mouth. Oh, and that sauce. So great. The pickled okra was unexpected (didn't really read the menu thoroughly), but they were amazing. They were on the crispy side, and not slimey (I know people have texture issues with okra). There were also shishito peppers on the side for added kick. Just a perfect dish all around.Of course, I couldn't go without having the fried chicken. Split a dish with a friend. Every bit as good as I remembered. Gigantic portions. Delightfully fluffy waffle. Crispy skin. The darkest maple syrup I've ever seen. Cabbage slaw on the side. Definitely bucket list worthy.I also have to mention their drinks. We did a handful of cocktails. I went with the Westlake and the Old Gal. Both were great, but I liked the Westlake better. Then again, I'm a sucker for St. Germain.If you're ever in doubt whether you should go to Buttermilk Channel, my answer is an emphatic yes. Just make sure you make a reservation or come on a weeknight!",7,4,5,Kenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",884,3337,12015

The meal somehow got lost in the kitchen or there must be a new chef. As always, I began with the St Louis smoked ribs, which are generally delicious topped with a mustard sauce that is exceptional. This time around someone decided to experiment with a soupy concoction that was more like ribs in a soup. It was disgusting. In my attempt to right what was soon to become an awful meal, I ordered the baked sea bass. It was as bad as the St Louis Smoked Rib Soup.

4.0,8/2/2015,"Maybe I should have known that if you order a fried pork chop and cheddar waffle, then a food coma is soon to follow. But it was a great food coma.There are so many great brunch places in NY and Buttermilk Channel is among them. For a Saturday brunch, we only had to wait fifteen minutes to get seated-- which is basically unreal for a solid brunch spot. The service was also great. Never had an empty water glass, always had what we needed to brunch it up.The ingredients are high quality. The waffle has the right balance of cheddar and sweetness while the pork chop was fried to a slight crisp on the outside but was tender and easy to cut. The salad provided the healthy side cutting through the carbs and meat. Mimosas are generally over-priced but I feel like getting a drink with brunch at BC isn't as worth it. It's good but you can plainly see that you can make a pitcher at home for what you pay for here. But in terms of the price for a drink in NY, it's on the more reasonable side. The coffee was standard.Vibes: lowkey hipster. Based on the look of the menu and the decor of the restaurant, you kind of have an idea of the place you're coming too.

1.0,7/26/2015,"Went there today with my friend and her husband. Between us we had three kids under the age of five. I had been hearing great reviews about this place and could not wait to try its food. Never did. The customer service is horrendous and the place just not family friendly. At least that was our experience. We had an hour wait and got crammed into two tables outside in the sun, (each table sits two patrons). After our hour wait, we waited for 20-30 minutes to get the menu at our request. waited for about another 15-20 min to order our food. During this wait, seeing that the kids were getting super overheated from the sun and unbelievably hungry and  that the other two tables in our section were vacant, we moved the patio umbrella to cover our kids. As our food arrived (another grand wait time), we thought to ourselves ""victory!!!"", until the manager comes out and tells us we need to move the patio umbrella to the center of the section. When we explained to her that it was because our kids were really overheated from the sun, she said that it was our choice for deciding to sit in the patio and waiting another 20 minutes to sit inside. It took us that long,if not longer to get a menu and if this was the case out of curtesy, we should have been advised of this but this choice was not even given to us in the first place. It was a plain lie since I was right behind my friend when she was talking to her about where we could sit. We had ordered six entrees for our party of six and thus to begin with we should not have been crammed to a four top and out of consideration been aided in our concern in a kinder way. When I went inside to speak to the manager about this situation to try to resolve it, the manager turned out to be the same person. She spoke to me in a really condescending manner and rolled her eyes at me saying ""don't feel entitled because you have children"" and waived her hand at my face.  Needless to say, not a family friendly place.

I would advise sitting inside during the summertime because it can get hot sitting outside, especially if the sun is blazing. The food was delicious! I ordered the pork chop and cheddar waffles and my boyfriend ordered the short rib hash, which came with 2 sunny side up eggs. The pork chop was very crispy but certain parts were dry, however the syrup was a perfect compliment to the pork chop and waffles. There was only a hint of cheddar in the waffles, which made it more savory. I didn't enjoy the dressing on the mesclun greens but is a minuscule complaint.

The chicken portion was considerable however there should be four waffles instead of the two served. Food was not spectacular as everyone hypes it up to be. Coleslaw was good (although I'm not a coleslaw fan) I could eat the coleslaw that's how I know its  good. I have definitely had better fried chicken and waffles. Anyone looking for a better chicken and waffles spot can try milk River in Brooklyn and Soco in Brooklyn as well. Maybe this place is the best chicken and waffle spot in Gowanus/Park slope but definitely not all of Brooklyn.  Not comparable at all.",0,0,0,Makeda s.,"Brooklyn, NY",56,15,0

When she finally arrived at our table, she did not introduce herself and did not welcome us. She cut me off even before I could finish my question about an item on the menu. She passed us and another table off to another waiter who was immensely better and nicer. I think his name was Noah. The manager was amazing though. She sent us a complimentary walnut pecan waffle which was warm and wonderful. The food again, was the best! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu.

Nothing here has a great depth or subtlety of flavor. I've tried a few times, and it never really impresses me. When dinner is running me comfortably over $50pp, I expect to leave my meal happy.

Buttermilk Channel is the first place I've gone where you could taste the QUALITY of the food. Despite eating quite a big brunch, I did not feel uncomfortable or sick after eating so much. It is evident that BC uses really fresh and quality ingredients. Came here with a friend for brunch on Saturday. We started with bellinis and the Court Street bloody Mary. So good! Gave you a nice buzz, but not too much of one. The Court Street bloody Mary came garnished with antipasto! After much deliberation, I settled on the A-B-C grilled cheese. I think it's called the ABC grilled cheese, because they're schoolin' people on how to make the grilled cheese. Apples, bacon, and cheddar baked into what felt like butter soaked fresh bread was heaven on earth, soooo good. I got a side of bacon which was absolutely delicious and different than other bacon in its bold flavor. My friend got the burger which she loved and a cheddar waffle which was great. The house made pickles are perfection, you must try them! We could taste a lot of buttery goodness in a lot of what we ate, and it was just amazing. The restaurant 's ambiance can only be described as darling, adorable, country meets Brooklyn, and fun. Our waiter was the best, provided excellent service. Considering I'm not allowed to live at the Buttermilk Channel, I'll settle for visiting all of the time. Place was busy but soooo worth the wait.

But we weren't discriminated or treated differently. It was wholesome and friendly. Food...their wasn't much options on the menu for my liking. It was very few. I went with the course 1(ribs and potatoes) it was REALLY good. I wish they had it as a regular sized meal. But this was more so a starter.  My bf had the buttermilk chicken and waffles(regular entree) which I dived into as well  and that had a different taste(unusual to me in a good way)but it was good as well. my overall view of this place was great I gave it 4 instead of 5 only because of the lack of diversity.

They did give us a complimentary Pumpkin Spice Bread to make up for the wait, but then it took over an hour for us to receive our food after ordering. Our server didn't even check in to apologize about our delayed food until after we have already waited for 45 minutes. They gave us a complimentary Sticky Bun but this was too big a blunder to make up for with sugared bread. Our server was nonchalant about the computer error that caused the wait, and a manager never came over to speak to us or apologize. To top it off the food was just OK and highly unimpressive. The decor is nice, mimosas good, but that's it... I won't be returning.",2,1,0,Ashley H.,"Chicago, IL",1,5,1
5.0,4/16/2015,"I dined one wintry Tuesday night with two Southern guys who fiercely believe they ""know fried chicken."" Each guy told a tale of his mamma's great recipe. We'd arrived a bit early and there were few occupied tables so I was a nervous that the guys would be disappointed. They were happy to see the bar had a very special bourbon. They ordered it and began to feel that indeed coming to Carroll Gardens was a good idea. I was surprised when they then ordered the fried chicken (after their trash talk). I guess they wanted to put us Northerners to shame. They had to eat their words as they ate with real gusto the fabulous signature chicken of Buttermilk Channel. They loved it! And the restaurant filled up completely while we were there, showing how very popular it is.  Plus we had a  great waitress. She had the kind of ""attitude"" that makes for an entertaining evening - the guys loved her too.  All around the service was just right.  And I was thrilled when my colleagues from the deep South treated me to dinner.  Very sweet like the tasty desserts we enjoyed.  Can't wait to take my husband to BC.",0,0,0,Rie L.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,23,1
5.0,4/15/2015,"One of the best places for brunch - hands down. I've honestly tried almost everything on the menu and it's difficult to choose a favorite. Definitely start with a bloody mary - classic, court street, or star of the sea - you can't go wrong! I personally like the court street bloody mary because it comes with a trio of antipasti (olive, cheese, meat) that puts a big fat smile on my face.The scrambles are always a good choice (I like the mushroom, spinach, and goat cheese) and comes with yummy hash browns. The burger is also delicious and if you're looking for a heart attack overload - the french toast is the way to go. It's hard to choose a favorite, but I've never had a bad meal here. Another tid bit - if you have room - get the sticky bun...it's SO good.Service is usually good, but sometimes a slow - the restaurant is always packed during brunch.

The sausages weren't remarkable, and tasted like pre-made breakfast sausages from a bodega. I won't ever go back.

We were given a tasting of popovers which were overdone...our cheese slab was served with burnt, inedible crostini...we both opted for vegetarian menu and my harvest vegetable plate was comprised of dried out overcooked vegetables that were indiscernible because they had no flavor left...at least the bean stew was edible but nothing special.

I been craving chicken and waffles and been wanting to try this place for a while. After spend hours at the doctors office I decided to come here for dinner. The atmosphere is nice and that is a plus. My first course I had the mussles and they were the best I've ever eaten. They weren't rubbery. They were nice and tender literally melting in my mouth. The broth was good. Wasn't salty and I can appreciate that. The bread however  was grilled and had too much of a charcoal grill taste to it. Main course I had the chicken and cheddar waffles. Wasn't nothing to rave about. It really wasn't that great. The chicken  was crispy and nicely seasoned but they put a bit to much salt after taking it out tge fryer. That clashed with the cheddar waffle, which was meh. The cole slaw was bland, couldn't eat it and the syrup wasn't great either. It tasted like a balsamic syrup reduced with maple flavor.

Sorry, Buttermilk Channel, I wanted to love you so much, but you let me down.  I had heard this place was amazing for over a year, and I had been waiting for an opportunity to try it when I was in the area.  Finally, I broke down and coerced a friend to come to Carroll Gardens specifically to eat here for brunch.We arrived at opening on a Sunday and the place already had an hour wait.  I didn't realize that they took reservations, but if you do decide to come here, make reservations.  We were seated at a small table a few seats away from the door and it was freezing cold during our meal.  People kept standing in the doorway and holding the door open.  Not fun.  The place has a cool feel to it though with exposed brick and a communal table in the back.  I have heard that the service is slow, but I actually thought that the decor and service were fine.  Also, I appreciated the 80s/90s dance music.The part that was disappointing for me was the food.  We started with coffee and a banana walnut sticky bun ($4). The coffee was great--really delicious flavor.  And the sticky bun was good and definitely fresh.  I ordered a goat cheese, spinach, and mushroom scramble ($12).  It came with a small ""salad,"" that barely had any dressing on it--it was basically plain arugula.  It was also supposed to come with toast and hash browns, but the kitchen forgot them.  I asked for them and they brought them out--I'm glad I did because they were the best part of the meal.  The scramble itself was served in a small cup and I could barely find any mushrooms, goat cheese, or spinach!  Total letdown!  My friend had the heirloom bean stew ($16), which tasted like an Indian or Moroccan stew.  It wasn't what either of us expected.I wished this place gave me more than it did, but it just felt like a typical brunch spot with nothing special.  I don't see myself coming back to try their dinner if it's as average as the brunch.",9,1,1,Logan J.,"Boston, MA",160,318,450

The custard was topped with light whip cream and came with two chocolate-dipped hazelnut shortbread pieces.  The texture of the custard reminded me of butterscotch pudding but a lighter version of it.Would like to come back to this place for brunch!",0,0,0,Mei W.,"San Francisco, CA",56,42,119

(Scroll down to the asterisks if you only want to read about the food)Let's start with reserving. I called to make a reservation for my birthday brunch and was told the maximum was 8. I then asked if I could make two reservations with the tables near each other and was again denied. I later had a friend call and request a reservation for the same time next to the my group and she was told no. What's ironic is between the 8 of us we spent well over $1k so if they would've been a bit  more considerate they could've nearly doubled that (surely more than what they would have earned on people just popping in for brunch). It reminds me of that scene in Pretty Woman when the sales clerk wouldn't let JR buy anything not knowing she had tons of money to spend. Lady, it's my Dirty Thirty Boozy Brunch.  We came to spend! We arrived and were seated, after a relatively small wait, which we didn't mind bcz we were chatting. Our server was amazing and super attentive.

No maple syrup needed. Too sweet! + Bacon: Premium cut. Not fatty. DELISH! - Cauliflower and leek soup: Too creamy and heavy. Also too much Olive oil drizzled on top. - French toast: Crispy outside. Gooey mess (like pancake batter) inside+ Egg scrambles: best item on the menu. Savory and complex flavors. Really good. - Eggs Benedict: not so great. *according to my brother*- Complimentary birthday banana pecan cinnamon roll thing: too much glaze and dryI didn't get a chance to sample everyone else's food and I only trust my brother's critique to add to my Yelp review.

A relaxed but romantic atmosphere.BYOB w/ corkage fee ($25- No Corkage Fee Tuesdays!, Good to know for next time)Started with the Squash Tart which was on point. A very flaky tart/tartine with ricotta cheese, squash and topped with a brown butter vinaigrette salad. Followed by the beer-steamed mussels;  a great dish to share. Not salty at all, but very garlic-y, which makes the flavor.My gf had the Buttermilk Fried Chicken (of course). Hands down one of the best fried chickens I've had. A not too thick-not too thin, just right fried coating with a juicy-meaty center. Its a large portion, enough to share. It's half a chicken!I had the Duck Meatloaf. I was skeptical from the photos I had seen, but it's a decent portion with bursts of flavor with every bite. If you're not a fan of duck pâté, then this may not be the dish for you.We ended the night with the Pecan Pie Sundae and my oh my was it worth it.

The toast was a tiny brown crouton soaked in butter. I could only have a bite of each half. The rest was too hard to bite into.  My sister had the pancakes, and they were pretty good.

I have to say I really find it accommodating and refreshing when restaurants have a vegetarian menu and their regular dinner menu. It just makes things a lot easier when you go out with a group and either you or your friends are vegetarians. That aside, the food here is impressive. The cauliflower-leek soup is a good choice for 1st course. It's creamy and just the right temperature (don't you just hate burning your tongue at the beginning of the meal?!). I also ordered a side of the corn bread with the chile-maple butter which was I think only 1 piece of cornbread maybe 2? I'm forgetting because the portion was so small. Definitely thought they could've given more cornbread...definitely try the chile-maple butter - it's to die for! Second course was the New England Hake. The Parmesan crust wasn't overdone or too salty ensuring that I could enjoy the fish in balance with the other flavors: mix of the orange-fennel broth and beans. Next time I go to Buttermilk Channel, I will definitely order Caputo's fresh linguine all to myself! I could only sample a small portion from my friend and it was the ideal pasta dish. Tasted fresh and perfectly portioned. I salivate at the thought of it! Another dish I was able to try was the buttermilk fried chicken. It reminded me of southern-style fried chicken - another hit.

My eyes widened as I clasped my left hand to my chest. The only way I could express my delight and surprise was involuntary 'OMG!'The food was amazing. Fried pork chop was dusted with a light airy breadcrumbs; it was so juicy and perfectly seasoned. The short rib hash- salty, fatty, fried burnt bits of short rib with a sunny side egg. Break the egg yolk, mix the yellow yolk in the hash with a bite of their salad- in short, it was delicious.

While I can't say that Buttermilk Channel served me the worst breakfast I have ever eaten, I can say that it was damn close. It all started with the biscuits---they were a hard, doughy undercooked mess. I also ordered the short rib hash. The hash itself was good but the sunny-side up eggs were overcooked. The yolk didn't move and the whites were rubbery. It's not often that I have a sunny-side up egg but I'm fairly certain that they aren't supposed to resemble what I was served. Isn't the yolk supposed to be runny and not just sit there in a state of congealment? The tiny, dry toast corners didn't help matters either.

I thought my food was quite good as did my friend. We thought that the cheddar waffles would be savory, but they were actually sweet and they came with maple syrup. The texture of the waffles was amazing as well: crunchy due to the corn meal, sweet from the powdered sugar and probably sugar in the batter, and slightly savory because of the cheddar.

So, instead my husband ended up ordering some fried pork dish with waffles. i don't know if it was the time and day, but they were lacking a lot of the items from the menu. We were told about the shortage as my husband's food came out. We were told they ran out of their waffle batter, so we got some pancakes instead. Again, this was told as they brought out our food. In addition, the substitution was made without our consent. I was surprised due to the fact they are known for their chicken and WAFFLES. How can they run out of the batter for what they are known? The pork dish was also lightly pink which isn't good when it comes to pork. We hoped for the best and still consumed it due to the long wait we had to endure to get our food in the first place. It was ironic how the table next to us, who had more people and ordered after we did, got their food first. We also tried ordering one of the doughnuts as dessert, but we were also told they only had one, exactly one, doughnut left. So, I got to have that one last doughnut.The service was mediocre. Our waitress seemed very miserable to be working there. She wasn't thrilled when we asked about some items on the menu nor when we tried to order dessert. Once we ordered our food our waitress was nonexistent. Also, we were told about the changes by someone else who brought our food out.

The waitress was quite good and that's what the three stars are for. She seemed to have inadequate help and was constantly having to go to her busser to tell him what to do.  Where was the management to take care of that?  She did a fantastic job despite the other moving parts in the front of house not really moving.  The food was just okay.  It was perfectly good, but nothing stuck with me.  For this pricepoint, I would rather go to Brucie in the neighborhood or ABC Kitchen in Chelsea.  It's stressful to have to watch one person making everything happen while other people are staring at bottles and puttering around.  This experience was from a few months ago, so hopefully this was just an extremely off night for the place.  But there is nothing about the place that even appeals to me to give it a second chance.  Mediocre and front of house seemed mismanaged and chaotic.",0,0,0,Jessica K.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,19,1

Usually I have to ask for tabasco, but this didn't need any. The pickle was pretty awesome too. They have four different kinds of bloody marys which I'll be coming back to try.For brunch, had the short rib hash which is amazing and my girlfriend had the sausage scramble which was good but honestly not as good as the hash.Finished it all off with a sticky bun at the recommendation of the bar keep, good choice.

I had 2 appetizers so I could try a couple things-the flatbread and the mussels-both were perfect. Not too filling, great flavors and presentation. I was full after both but had to try the butterscotch panna cotta-and didn't regret the decision, it was so so good. Service from the bartender was just the right amount of neighborhood friendly/laid back and perfectly anticipating exactly what I wanted and right on top of it (i.e. another glass of wine-she always had the bottle when she asked because she knew).

The signature pork chop and cheddar waffle is a huge amount of food but so good. The sweet and savory flavors go so well together and everything is cooked just perfectly from the crispy crust on the chop to the chewy interior of the waffle.

While having brunch on a very busy Sunday, we brought an 11 month old child who was the center of attention. She was treated with the most amazing love and affection by so many of the servers and management. If you can find mgr Michael, he will make sure you are given the very best of what Buttermilk has to offer. Next, if you can request Chelsea as your server, she is truly fantastic. She will lead you through an exceptional dining experience.  Warm, friendly, and caring.I truly could go on and on about how well we were treated here...Now for the food-- it's straight up Delish!!! No joke, the reason the line and wait are long is because the food rocks. We had a brunch feast and each item was perfectly seasoned. Portions were large, and so yummmmm. First off we were given a plate of sweet baked treats that satisfied every flavor sense. The scrambles were so tasty and fresh!! Every item we ordered was hot out of the kitchen and made to perfection. Even the prices are really fair for how high quality everything menu item is.

I even used the mussel shells to scoop up the sauce. The bread that was on top however, is every dentists' nightmare. Super hard. Watch out esp if you have anterior crowns. The chicken waffle is not worth the hype at all. I like the batter used but I was really expecting something... Unique. We actually wanted to grab Popeyes later if anything. Both chicken are good but for the price I can get a family meal ( complete different experience, I understand)The hubs got the duck meat loaf. He enjoyed it and it's true.. It's unique. good food, fast service and friendly waitstaff but IMO, it's really nothing special. Sorry",0,0,0,Nancy N.,"Baltimore, MD",88,131,93
3.0,7/22/2014,"Maybe it's because the boyfriend and I didn't order the fried chicken and waffles, but we didn't find this place particularly AMAZING, but it wasn't bad either. It was good, but not GREAT.If I lived around the area, I definitely would stop by here again to eat on occasion, but if just visiting, I'd rather go to other places to try out now that I've crossed this one off my list. The two of us arrived on a Saturday morning for brunch right as it opened, and there were around 7-8 people already waiting for the place to open! First off: the atmosphere is really nice--laid back, and has a pristine, Southern farmhouse feel to it, and the staff is also very friendly. Now what you're all really here for is to get the scoop about the food...so I'll get to it!WHAT WE GOT:1. Side of Cheddar Waffles:Mmmm the cheddar is subtle but definitely there--perfectly crispy on the outside and fluffy inside. 2. Eggs Huntington:I thought it was good, but not great. Boyfriend wasn't a fan, as he thought it was barely warm.3. Heirloom Grains (I'm not sure if this is still on the menu anymore):This was soooo good. I loved this--perfectly soft boiled egg with the grains seasoned perfectly, wonderful taste of the mushrooms (not overcooked/mushy), with the asparagus, pea shoots, and green chickpeas--everything went well together. I dream about this dish.4. Side of hashbrowns:Yum! Crispy on the outside, and perfectly cooked potato on the inside.Overall, we enjoyed eating here for a very laid back morning, but nothing really wow'd us (except for the heirloom grains on my end..but seeing as it's not on the online menu anymore...who knows.. :( ) I think if I were to go back here, I'd try the chicken and waffles, but now I don't really have a reason to go back.",1,0,0,Shannon N.,"Berkeley, CA",476,178,230
3.0,7/20/2014,"Came here for brunch and the execution of the food is great without question, but we just weren't blown away. Maybe our expectations were too high? Both meals (salmon scramble and eggs Huntington) felt overly salty. The banana sticky bun was great and the coffee was good.

3.0,7/18/2014,"I have been here twice.Food: The fried pork chop and cheddar waffles didn't blow mind. I know...I know W-T-F?! The pork chop was soooo deep fried that the meat was dry. It was also overly salty for my liking. The cheddar waffles weren't as cheesy as I hoped they would be and also dry...it seemed like the overall dish was stale or sat in the kitchen for too long before it reached my table. I also had the pecan French toast...now this was delicious, if you have a sweet tooth and I do! My husband didn't feel the same about this dish as I did. The French toast has the sweet sauce, some kind of caramel maple syrupy sauce and nice chunks of pecans all over them and my plate. They also have whipped cream on the side. The French toast is also large portioned, it really is a meal by itself. Service: The waitress never made eye contact with us, which really diminished the appeal of the atmosphere. She never asked us if we liked the food. Also, at the end of the meal they give you a postcard to fill out with comments. I wanted to fill it out but she never gave us a pen and when she finally did to sign our receipt, she took away the post card...was that on purpose? I don't know.Atmosphere: typical hipstery brunch spot, very minimalist. It's a ""eat up and go-get out of here because we are so busy and exhausted"" type of atmosphere.

The ABC grilled cheese was horrible....the smoky bacon was overpowering and not well cooked; the green apple was soft and unpleasant to bite through. This dish could really be improved by using non-smoky bacon and creating an apple spread instead of pieces of soft hot apple. 3. The Huntington Eggs (i.e., Eggs Benedict) were good, but the ham is very thin and the dish lacks flavor. 4.

Pancakes really tasted homemade and light...sadly I love ihops pancakes way better. YIKES! CONS: The hostest was really nice but thats not what made the experience bad...She was OVERLY nice...so nice we waited an hour and some change to be seated and the place wasnt super packed as expected! There was a group of women who finished there meal about 10 min ago and was just sitting there talking about how lonely and single they are (im sure).

She said o yes they are.....OKAY 45 min go by and my friend walks in there and tempts to ask the group of ladies nicely when will they be done?...but before she could finish...the hostest said ""They'll be done when there ready"" WTF!? How rude of her to let paying customers who have been so patient wait for overly talkative women just sit there like their the only freaking people in the world!..I think the hostest should have politely told the group another party is waiting to be seated. She was waaaay to nice in letting them just sit there. She had no balls to tell them to get their butts up!.....but since she told my friend ""they'll be done when their ready"" was an invitation for the group to chill longer..which they did!!! No way!

The duck was a small dish soaking in its sauce on a very thin layer of puree, the jam was nowhere to be found.We then had a crumble and a chocolate cake. Both very plain and not really tasty too...

A lot of their dishes I felt were missing the ""Trio"" that I normally look for when I eat brunch: Carbs, Protein, Greens. 3. I'm sorry ""Porkchop & Waffles"" sound more like a dinner item than ""Chicken & Waffles"". Chicken and Waffles should definitely be on your brunch menu, not dinner. 4.

We waited about 30 minutes for a table which was fine, ended up next door at the mexican restaurant and had a glass of sangria. For a busy Saturday afternoon, the staff was extremely pleasant, and professional. The restaurant was spic and span, including the one stall unisex bathroom! The hostess called me on my cell once our table was available, and sat my group of 4 in the front nook of the restaurant. We had the cutest sever (but you know me, I forgot his name)  brown hair, glasses, super sweet, super cute (yikes, that's my second time calling him cute :) . He gave us great recommendations... probably the reason we ordered 6 different brunch items from the menu. He said the best thing on the menu was the fried pork chop and waffle... and it was. I don't eat pork, but that chop was so crispy on the outside, and warm and juicy on the inside. I may have to permanently join the SWINE team. Oh, and it was huge!I ordered the burger, medium rare. There was a little confusion, so when the burger came out medium well, I was a little upset but it really wasn't a big deal, especially since we had so much food. But a guy standing by the door, who looked as if he was just waiting for someone, came over to our table, apologized for the well done burger and took it away. Another burger was brought out promptly, cooked medium rare to perfection. Thanks secret shopper guy. That was amazing, and great customer service!

I think I just hit the jackpot!I love fried chicken, and I'm one of those people who will bite your hand off if you put it near my bucket of fried chicken. I guess I'm so used to eating fried chicken out of a bucket, so it was refreshing walking into Buttermilk, where all the tables had white table cloth and the lights were dimmed down creating a romantic rustic first-date kind-of ambiance. My friends and I opted for the Monday night special, which was a pre-fixe 3-course dinner including a leek soup/walnut salad, an entree, and a dessert for $28, which is a fantastic deal considering that a fried chicken and waffle entree is already priced at $23 on any other day. I decided to start with the salad knowing that my entree was going to be quite heavy (obviously, I ordered the fried chicken and waffles), and I knew that I was planning to top-off the dinner with their pecan pie sundae. The food from the beginning to the end was delicious from the complimentary popovers delicately drizzled with honey to the pecan pie sundae which wasn't overwhelmingly sweet. The only thing I would not order again would be the ""Fair Harbor"" cocktail beverage. I am a big whiskey/bourbon fan, and I ordered the cocktail based off of the waitress' recommendation. However, it tasted like cherry Tylenol.

3.0,3/9/2014,"There's nothing special about the brunch here, and yet people line-up in droves before they open, so we had to see what all the fuss was about. We were seated near a window, but still felt pretty cramped, as the tables are REALLY close together. The first strike was the ice water, something neither my teeth nor stomach appreciate, especially in the morning and in winter. I would have preferred the water to be slightly chilled or at room temp, as is customary at an upscale restaurant. Second strike was the coffee. They serve Brooklyn Roasting Company coffee, which was very bitter, so they either over-brewed it or the beans weren't roasted properly (I haven't liked their coffee anywhere I've tried it, so it could be the latter). Meanwhile across the street at Prime Meats, they serve Stumptown coffee, which is not only roasted in the same zip code, but is always roasted to perfection and is absolutely delicious. My husband and I both ordered different egg scrambles, which come with toast, a hash brown, and a side salad, plus two sides for the table - grapefruit wheels and a  cheddar waffle. The grapefruit wheels never came (strike 3!), but the cheddar waffle did, and it tasted like a plain old waffle, if you ask me. Our scrambles were pretty good. I tasted a tanginess in the egg batter, which may have been buttermilk powder? Whatever it is, I guess that's what makes the folks keep coming back for more. The side of toast was a joke (generic sliced whole wheat bread), the salad was wilted and flavorless, but the little hash brown had great crunchiness on the outside and a well-seasoned interior.

Normally, when informed of a long wait, I would just move on to the next place, but there was such a huge crowd outside that I thought this spot must be some kind of hidden neighborhood gem with amazing food. Decided to be patient and give it a shot.  It was also out of the way for us geographically, so I knew that if we didn't try it that night, we weren't likely to come back.  The hostess didn't help the experience; she had a weird attitude and kept extending our wait time.  By the time we sat down I was quite ""hangry.""

5.0,2/27/2014,"This is my neighborhood spot, and one of my favorite restaurants ever. First, the people. Jennifer at the door is wonderful--she has an incredible memory for faces and names and she is just such a lovely, warm person. I never asked the cute bartender's name (the one who often wears a newsboy cap), but when I eat dinner alone at the bar from time to time, he's efficient and noninvasive (he can also be charming and dryly amusing when I'm feeling chatty). The owner is there a lot, and quite friendly. The waitstaff is competent and professional. Next, the food. Their menu is a locavore's delight, with a southern twist. Did you know they have a vegetarian menu if you ask? I really like the fact that they have small bites in case you want a little snack and not a big appetizer. From the snacks menu, the bacon almonds are a standout. If you're in the mood for something a bit more substantial in the way of appetizers, they usually have at least one excellent soup on the menu. I've also tried their ribs, which are delicious and as big as an entree at many places. Their sides are great too--in particular, the fries and seasonal side veggies are consistently great. You can't go wrong with any of their entrees, but my favorites are the lamb salad and the duck meatloaf. I also love their steak, and they always have one or two excellent fish dishes. I enjoy their fried chicken with waffles as well, but as far as southern-style restaurants go, this dish is a bit trite. Maybe go to a true soul food restaurant if you're craving chicken and waffles and don't bother with it here--they have so many other standouts.They always have a great selection of (local) beers and wines, and inventive, cheekily named cocktails (the Carlos Danger, anyone?) As far as desserts are concerned, the real standout is the pecan pie sundae. To die for. Truly. I always order a half portion because it is so rich! When I don't want something sweet, I go for the cheese plate. The sourness of the pickled grapes, crunchiness of the toasted french bred, and sweetness of the honey counterbalance nicely with the creamy/saltiness of the cheese. I'm starting to get hungry just thinking about it.Their brunch is great too. I usually order one of the scrambles and a side of fries. Delicious!The unfortunate thing about this restaurant is that it is almost ALWAYS crowded, and doesn't take reservations for small parties (I think you need like 6 or 8 people to make a reservation). Expect to wait at least 45 minutes, sometimes more than three hours. I think one of the reasons for this is the food is great and isn't that expensive. You could try on a Tuesday or Wednesday night, and you may get lucky. Another trick is find a friend who lives nearby and put your names in in advance (you have to do it in person), and then hang out at your friend's place until they call you. Or you could swig by the Mexican restaurant next door (they have decent margaritas), grab some chips and a beer, and hang out there until they call you.If you can handle waiting a little bit for something good, by all means you must go there.",0,0,0,Jenny H.,"Brooklyn, NY",35,5,0

Personally I started off with the cauliflower & leek soup.  It was very satisfying.  The only thing I didn't like were the raisins in it but that's just my preference so I took them out.  Next, I had the buttermilk fried chicken and waffles.  This was again very satisfying.  They really do give you a good amount of food (leg, breast, thigh, half waffle, slaw).  The chicken is fried just right, cole slaw was a good balance of texture and moistness, and waffles were crispy on the outside but soft on the inside.  Then I finished it off with the coffee pot de creme.  It was good but my friends go the mini pecan pie and they said it was amazing.Our waiter was great.  He was very knowledgeable about the menu and when he didn't know something he found the answer right away.  He was very attentive and even brought us hot sauce for the fried chicken without us having to ask.  Also, atmosphere was warm and family friendly.Overall I gave this place 4 stars because the food and service are very good but the food wasn't amazingly good in my opinion and the food is a tad bit pricey for what it is.  I'm sure if I hadn't gotten the prefixed dinner it would have ran me $50+ not including drinks.  I'm excited to come back and try the other menu items and I would recommend this place to anyone.",1,1,1,Sonia I.,"Freeport, NY",4,34,3

2.0,2/8/2014,"I was so excited to try this place out. I went originally a few weeks ago around 11:30, I believe, and was told the wait was about 45 minutes to an hour for 2 people. Both I and my friend were starving so that was not an option. A few weeks later I was determined to be there early, because I was sure the wait was due to the unseasonably warm day during the winter.  Boy was I wrong.  The place opens at 10 and and I arrived at 10:30 to a 30 to 45 minute wait, and yes it was the tail end of that window that I received a call saying a table was now available. I was really looking forward to trying the cheddar waffles and was in the mood for scrambled eggs and hash browns. I ordered the scrambled eggs and asked for a substitution of the waffle for the toast. My food came out pretty quickly but to my dismay it was not all I had hoped. The potions were tiny. Thank God I went to a cafe down the block before hand and had hot chocolate and a muffin during my 45 minute wait otherwise I would have been starving. Now let's talk about that food. So my waffle substitution was a quarter of a waffle.  I repeat a QUARTER of the waffle instead of toast, which was a dry as the Sahara. The fact that the syrup never made it to the table didn't help. The hash browns were actually a hash brown (singular) that was guaranteed to raise your blood pressure because it was so salty. I also ordered an apple juice which was 3 bucks but practically came in a shot glass. This meal was SO not worth the wait or anticipation. Our server was not memorable at all.

It has a cozy feel to it but I've experienced better.We entered and was greeted right away by the host...we had 2 options regarding seating.1- close to the door2 - further down but sorta in the middle...we opted for this seat. It was very close to the table beside us that I could hear there convo. Getting real tired of these crammed spots!App - I had the apple & chicory salad. Pretty good....def bitter, but the walnuts and dressing balances it out more or less. Oh, I also tried the cornbread w/ their specialty spread, which was decent.Entree - our waitress told us abt the special and highly recommended it. She was very pleasant. We took a few and decided...I got the special - whole roasted bobo chicken, w/ potatoes & shallot.My honey got the fried chicken and waffles, w/ mash potato. He wanted to substitute the waffles for the mash potato but perhaps it was missed in communication.Anyway, the food arrived....presentation was cool. Tasted the potato, which was SUPER SALTY! I began cutting into the chicken and it was tender...a lit too tender for me. Should've stayed in the oven/roaster for a lot longer. Anyway, I get to the leg and the feet of the chicken were still on!!!! That totally freaked me out...I had to put the feet back in its snugged position, but at that point I was already turned off. Needless to stay I did not enjoy my food.I also tried the mash potato, which was also SALTY. I'm sorry but the chef hand was a bit heavy with the salt.Oh about our waitress - initially she was very pleasant but after the apps and taking our orders for the entree, we did not see her again. Oh, for dessert, she didn't ask if we wanted but just placed the dessert menu anyway. At that point, there still wasn't any inquiry about the food or even how we are doing.

We even stayed well into the wee hours of the morning and we felt nothing but still warmly welcomed, even at that hour!It was our first time and in addition to fantastic service, the food was delicious and very much enjoyed. The complimentary popovers were a nice touch, maple almonds are a must, but the fried chicken is not to be missed!  So food wise, the fried chicken was a huge hit- people especially were surprised how great  the coleslaw and waffles were also. A couple of us girls had the porgy, which was delicious, and the brussel sprouts were great also. The special cake was a huge hit- vanilla cake with salted caramel filling and chocolate butter cream.

I would have rather waited for a table than be seated and wait for the food endlessly.Whenever we asked the hostess or waiter about our food, we were promised it would be out ""any minute"" which of course, was not the case.Service (meaning water refills) were a bit sloppy too as I had an empty glass for quite sometime.A few minutes before our food arrived, the waiter served us 2 donuts on the house (which was a nice gesture but would have been appreciated 15 minutes before that as we were really hungry).We shared the buttermilk pancakes which was just about the best pancakes I have ever tried (not heavy and dense but fluffy with a batter like taste) and the omelet with goat cheese, spinach and mushrooms which was served with a side salad and one hash brown. This was equally good.I don't doubt other items on the menu are also good or dinner for that matter, but to wait so long for our food (when it seemed other people were being served) was pretty annoying mostly b/c we each had an appointment and I felt that I had to eat quickly.Service wasn't good but the food was and although I wouldn't go as far to say it was worth the wait---b/c I don't appreciate waiting so long for anything, I would give it another try.My score would have been higher if it wasn't for the ridiculous wait.",2,1,1,Johanna B.,"Brooklyn, NY",468,560,1574

5.0,10/14/2013,"This has become my favorite brunch place in NY.  This place serves absolutely amazingly delicious food.  They make the best french toast I've ever had.  The outside was deliciously caramelized and crunchy and the inside was fluffy and moist and just heaven!  The chef also makes the best fried pork chop I've ever tasted.  The pork chop was moist, tender, and best of all super flavorful.  It was also crazy big, I think it was bigger than my face.  Their cheddar waffle was pretty yummy too.  You could taste the little cheese bits they put in the waffle. The short rib hash was not short on the short rib as some places are and the short rib is nice, tender, and juicy.  Buttermilk also has a pretty tasty bloody mary selection and my favorite was the court street bloody mary. All in all, this place is hands down better than any brunch spot I've had in Manhattan or any of the other burrows in NY.  I can't wait to go back and try their dinner fare.",1,0,0,Red J.,"New York, NY",188,259,6
5.0,10/10/2013,"On Friday nights, this place is jumpin' - even at 7pm! Maybe I should say especially at 7pm. It seemed like the parents with children were just clearing out, but there was quite a wait and my partner and I opted to dine at the bar. We were more than pleased with our choice, because the bartenders are amazing! Not only can they mix great cocktails and suggest nice wines, but they are fun to chat with too! Dinner was delicious even though we didn't try the famous chicken & waffles. Everything we had, from drinks to salads to oysters to entrees was delicious - I won't go into it all but I will single out the Fluke as absolutely FANTASTIC and highly recommended by my server - good call, and also you have awesome glasses! The fact that smoky jazz was playing heightened the experience for us - a great BK neighborhood gem of a restaurant.

5.0,10/3/2013,"For her birthday, my girlfriend was weighing here options, and ultimately settled on here.  Why may you ask?  A location (relatively) near Prospect Park, it being in Carroll Gardens, and having some of the best fried chicken in the city.  I'd heard of Buttermilk Channel before, and after placing that I'd read about it on Chowhound and elsewhere, I quickly seconded this.  We came at 6pm on a Saturday and were seated immediately.  The place had 6-8 other tables, but wasn't even half full.  This didn't last for long, as it was absolutely packed by the time I left with people from all walks of life: families, older people, young couples, etc.  The service was spotty at times but our actual waitress was very good.  The beer list is decent as is the cocktail list.  I paired a Brooklyn Sorachi Ace with my steak, and I got a funny-named cocktail (something about an older woman) that had scotch, rye, an orange liquer, and a herbal liquer in it.  It was really good, but a bit pricey at $12 for a tiny glass.  That is to be expected, at this ""quality"" of restaurant.  It is also expected that the food must be great in a New American restaurant at this price point with this critical acclaim.  Luckily, Buttermilk Channel did not disappoint.We got popovers to start, which was a pleasant surprise.  I haven't had popovers for probably over 5 years now (fuck I'm old).  I ordered the steamed mussels (green chili, aioli, grilled country bread, $12) to start, and my girlfriend ordered the mustard-glazed grilled bacon ($7).  The mussels were excellent; they were huge, plentiful, and packed with flavor.  The green chili they were cooked in resembled a variant of salsa verde with green tomatillos and onions, which I absolutely love.  The aioli wasn't entirely necessary bit didn't hurt either.  The grilled country bread was good stuff, but they probably could've done without the grilling in order to better act as a sponge for the sauce.  My girlfriend complained about her bacon, saying it was way too fatty.  Cut thick enough to make Peter Luger's bacon look thin, she was right about it being too fatty.  Too addictively, deliciously fatty.  Seriously, the bacon was mostly fat, but once you get past that it has to be some of the most tender, succulent pork fat I've tasted.  I could eat this stuff all day.  It even came with a small salad just so that you can feel slightly better about yourself.  My girlfriend had a waiter take this dish away, otherwise I would've cleaned the plate.  I got the special Delmonico steak for my main (~$36), while my girlfriend played it safe with the buttermilk fried chicken (cheddar waffles and savoy cabbage slaw, $23).  I'd never had a ribeye or a Delmonico steak before, but my steak tastes have gradually been growing towards fattier steaks in search of more flavor.  Given this--and my philosophy that the best restaurants are those that you can try something out-of-the-box that you wouldn't normally order and end up loving it--I went for it medium rare.  Great choice!  The steak was fatty, tender, and packed with flavor.  There was a bit too much grizzle on it for my tastes, but I'm unsure of whether this is just typical for this cut.  I wish I had asked more about how it was prepared though, as it came dressed in balsamic vinegar and oils.  This complemented the steak well, mind you; I just didn't expect it as there was no description on the menu.  These liquids mingled nicely on the bottom of the plate, making a tasty meat juice soup.  There were also several peppers around the dish.  Most peppers were sweet, juices and tasty, having sucked up the steak's flavors--except the one lone, random  extra-hot pepper.  I was not expecting that one at all, and while I have no problem with spicy food, it only served to curb my enjoyment of the dish.  My girlfriend had the much bally-hoed fried chicken.  I was only allowed one bite, but it was crisp, moist and flavorful.For dessert, I got the vanilla ice cream float with Manhattan Special ($7), and my girlfriend got the chocolate tart ($8).  I am a huge fan of Manhattan special and the ice cream they used was great, so there was no way for this to be anything but great.  Very refreshing to see a basic item like this on a fancy restaurant's menu: if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  My girlfriend's chocolate tart was chocked full of deep, dark chocolate flavor, albeit being a little small; she didn't seem to love it, though.Slight imperfections aside, Buttermilk Channel lived up to the hype for me.  This place is a great restaurant because it has all the characteristics of one--not just because someone wrote an article in the Times oron Chowhound.  It proves it is a great restaurant in how it executes its dishes first and foremost, how serves its customers, and how it makes itself more than just another restaurant in a trendy area.  There is a buzz here that is palatable beyond pure hype.  I would definitely love to come back again.",3,1,2,Justin L.,"New York, NY",900,1005,34

Even as I saw it pass the table it looked amazing. Looks can be deceiving. There was something about it that I can't pinpoint that tasted off. I am picky but to my credit 2 others got the French Toast and felt the same. The other two got the eggs Huntington and agreed there was something salty about it.

4.0,8/31/2013,"I came here for brunch on a sunny Saturday afternoon. We luckily didn't have to wait, despite going at 12:30 when everyone suddenly gets stricken by hunger. I ordered their eggs huntington which is a classic Benedict with a thinly sliced, cured ham instead of Canadian bacon and a biscuit instead of an English muffin. This was absolutely delicious. The hollandaise sauce was great and the eggs were poached to perfection where it's nice and gooey in the middle. Though the biscuit does a nice job of soaking up all the egg yolky goodness, I thought it was just a tad too heavy for me. I could have used a little more ham too- it left me wanting more. I tried some of the pancakes too and they were simple and fluffy. They didn't seem to offer any toppings, which I generally enjoy, but these were top notch simple pancakes. I ordered the banana walnut sticky bun and thought it was mediocre. It looks better than it tastes. A bit anticlimactic for me. We got a side of biscuits with jam and they finish the biscuits on a grill which left them slightly burnt on the outside. Our neighbors at the restaurant had the same problem too.

3.0,8/12/2013,"I was really looking forward to going to Buttermilk Channel. We already arrived 40 minutes past their opening time, 10:00 AM, and there was already a line of people waiting. Luckily, we were only a party of 2, so we wound up waiting no more than 10 minutes before being seated.Sadly, it was before noon, so we weren't able to order any alcoholic drinks. Some may want to plan on going after 12 PM, especially if you like Bloody Mary's which Buttermilk specializes in several different concoctions.Coffee will run you $3.00, with free refills, which is sourced locally from The Brooklyn Roasting Company. Their coffee is quite good and worth trying, with a medium body and not too much acidity. It's a cup of joe that I can enjoy having a couple cups of.For my entree, I ordered the Short Rib Hash ($12.00), which consisted of 2 sunnyside eggs, 2 half slices of whole wheat toast, and organic greens. I was rooting for this dish, especially after becoming a huge fan of the Duck Hash from LIC Market in Long Island City. The short rib hash was shredded up and abundant complimented with cubes of potatoes. Tasty, but slightly dried out and definitely no where as good as the formerly mentioned. My 2 sunny side eggs were overcooked past the point of perfection, both yolks were for the most part 75% solidified with only a small trace amount of runny yellow yolk. The edges of the egg white were over-fried to crispiness, something which I normally wouldn't mind, but everything seemed to just go wrong. The toast wasn't bad, lightly buttered and lightly toasted just enough so that I could hold it without the bread flopping over. However, the highlight of the meal seemed to be the side of organic greens which at first sight appeared to be deceptively undressed and boring. But instead, there was a light dressing and very subtle note of saltiness that made for a very enjoyable salad. I did have a chance to try the Buttermilk Pancakes ($7.00) which was a big hit. Airy with a hint of sweetness, making for one of the best pancakes that I've had in a while. I usually don't like pancakes, but these were so darn good and definitely worth trying.Our waitress was very nice. Not once did I have to get her attention as she always seemed to come at the right time, refiling our cups of coffee and water. Despite the crowds waiting outside, she never rushed us to leave.Maybe my dish was a freak accident as the general opinion of Buttermilk Channel seems to be positive. But such minor details, such as an overcooked fried egg should never go unnoticed. Perhaps I should have told my waitress, but I'm not one to complain to the staff about my food unless there is some sort of bug in it or the food is just unbearably bad.

They had a type of rancid after taste that I really couldn't stand, so I had to cover it up with the syrup they give you.  The chicken was prepared well though, it was super crispy and as any good fried chicken should be.  The waffle was decent, but nothing spectacular.  Honestly the clams that my friend had were probably the highlight of the dinner.  Her clams tasted so fresh and the broth it was cooked in was so flavorful.  I think I just need to return on a different day and try it again.",0,0,0,Karmen A.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,4,0
5.0,8/5/2013,"This place hooked me with their presence at Smorgusburg where they serve the best chicken and waffle combination I have ever had  in my 30 years of living.The food:  The Friend Chicken and Waffles is must try!  Lets start with the chicken.  It is breaded a bit heavier than I usually like it with spices that are just perfect for friend chicken.  It's so crispy, the initial crunch can be audible throughout Brooklyn!  Take a big bite to enjoy the delicate chicken contrasted with the extra crispy skin.  Somehow they managed to make it not greasy at all.  Enter the Waffles.  It's texture mirrors the chicken: crunchy exterior with soft tender interior.  The best part about this duo is that once you eat up all the skin on the outside, just fork the chicken and crisp edeges of the wafflles and dip it in the balsamic maple sauce....can't be beat!  Back in the day at Smorgusburg they also served a watermelon gazpacho type condiment with it but not anymore :(   Be warned they don't have chicken and waffles for the brunch menu.  But what they do have is pork chop and waffles.  Excellent pork chop with a nice crispy exterior on great waffles.  Not as good as the chicken but a close second.They have great oysters as well!The setting: nice date place!  For brunch its nice and airy with a clean fresh feel to it, probably due to its bright blue, white and pale colors.  Overall: best friend chicken and waffles I have ever had, and I have had alot",0,0,0,Cheng R.,"Bellaire, TX",144,100,165

Trust their advice about wine: you will discover interesting new things.Atmosphere is a balance of romantic and friendly. The 10-person table in the middle adds to the feeling.Great oysters.

2.0,8/3/2013,"They only serve two things here: Chicken with cheddar waffles ($10) and bottled water ($1)Unfortunately for me, they ran out of waffles so I got two pieces of fried chicken for $8. You would think that if this was the ONE food thing you were serving, you would have enough of both elements.What I really wanted was the total package and because there were no waffles, I had to imagine what my meal could have tasted like had there been some.On the plus side, the chicken was definitely delicious - the skin extra crispy and the meat tender and juicy on the inside.",0,0,0,Patty L.,"New York, NY",371,455,822

4.0,7/30/2013,"I've been wanting to try Buttermilk Channel's Monday pre-fixe dinner for ages. Last night I finally made it there. I was meeting some friends at 7 and I arrived a little early, the F train was a convenient 2 blocks away. The place is adorable as so many others in BK are. They have seating outside which I would have preferred but one in the crowd is not a fan of eating on the sidewalk. I put my name in and sat at the bar. The bartender was great and she made me a Paper Moon: Rye, aperol, amaro, lemon and a spray of absinthe that definitely hit the spot. When I arrived around 6:30 the place was pretty empty but by 7 when the rest of my party arrived the place was packed and we had to wait about 20 minutes for our seats at a communal table. My friend ordered the Carlos Danger, she couldn't resist with the whole wiener scandal. It was made with mezcal, grapefruit, honey & campari rimmed with some sort of smoked sugar. It was bitter, but I liked that. We all decided to order the pre-fixe. I started with the watermelon and radish salad with black olives, arugula and lime vinaigrette. This was a perfect, refreshing summer salad. Both of my friends went with the chilled zucchini and basil soup with pumpernickel croutons and goat feta. I personally don't like chilled soups, had this been warm I would have ordered it as well but when tasting it, meh. For entrees I ordered the parsley crusted hake with summer beans, basil, hot pepper and green olive. I'll have to say that I thought this was just OK. I guess I'm not a fan of the consistency of hake and it did have a bit more of a fish smell than I usually like. My friends each tried the other two entrees that were offered, the chicken and waffles and the linguine with broccoli rabe, pecorino, spicy sausage and chile oil. I tasted the fried chicken and waffles and thought it was very good. I never did get to taste the linguine as my friend had the protective arm around the bowl which leads me to assume that it was quite good. We ordered a bottle of the Bonny Doon Carignane, us being Cali girls and all we needed to represent. It was serviceable and exactly what you would expect from the eccentric Randall Grahm. The dessert is where we were completely sold. All three of us opted for the mini pecan pie sundae with whipped cream and vanilla ice cream. I barely got down to the pecan pie part as I was loving the ice cream and whipped cream. The ""filling"" was uber sweet but the whole thing was delicious! Our service was fine, we did have to flag our waitress down a few times but she was slammed. I would definitely recommend the place, not entirely for the food but the whole experience was pretty great.",0,0,0,Leslie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",82,444,2

Brunch is also solid here.  The pancakes and fried porkchop are delicious!",0,1,0,Joe S.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,22,0

3.0,7/27/2013,"Tried their fried chicken and waffles at Smorgasburg, and have to give them kudos for fantastically juicy chicken and soft, toothsome waffles.The skin of the fried chicken (usually the best part), however, was oddly ""crunchy"" and dry, rather than ""crispy"", lacking that usual ethereal texture that I have come to love and adore with fried chicken.  There also seemed to be a lack of seasoning in the particular batch I had, which made it the entire experience a bit difficult to redeem, regardless of how wonderfully juicy and tender the meat happened to be.Maybe that's just their style and I just happen to dance to a different drummer, or something about cooking their fried chicken outdoors under a tent.  But the end result is still the same, next time I'm at Smorgasburg, I'll be setting my sights elsewhere for my fix.",1,0,0,Dan T.,"New York, NY",111,430,157
4.0,7/23/2013,"The first time I've ever experienced Buttermilk Channel was at Smorgasburg. It was the first tent I went to and I couldn't help but say to the person serving me..""your tent smells the best."" I indulged myself with their famous Fried Chicken and Cheddar Waffles with a balsamic maple syrup. It was a magical, juicy, sweet, and salty combination. Their fried chicken and waffles are only available on their dinner menu so plan accordingly if you ever want to try. During brunch on the weekends at the actual restaurant, you can get their Fried Pork Chop and Cheddar Waffles. I personally like the fried chicken better, but can you really go wrong with anything that's fried and covered in syrup? It was really good but the health nut in me felt pretty guilty afterwards. After I was defeated by the fried pork chops, I knew I was going to get the Eggs Huntington for my next experience. I mean, if you're going to a place that's called Buttermilk Chanel, you have to try the buttermilk biscuits, am I right? The eggs benedict filled me up, the biscuits were rich and flaky. I did think they were a little salty for my taste, that and the side salad but overall, a good meal most definitely. My friends and I decided to splurge and share the Pecan Pie French Toast with a bourbon molasses glaze over the top. The french toast was crunchy and toasted on the outside while the inside was soft, creamy, and custardy. The freshly whipped cream next to it was light and heavenly with the perfect amount of sweetness. I would only recommend getting it if you had a really strong sweet tooth that morning. Our server was very kind as well, telling us to relax and take our time with the check.

Consistently terrific food, and relatively reasonably priced; I feel like they could probably get away with charging two or three bucks more per entree than they do. (But don't do that.) As I'm sure all the other reviews have said, they don't take reservations and there's usually a huge line, so the deal with here is that sometimes it's Tuesday, or it's like 5;00 but you're so starving that you don't even care if you're eating with old people, and at those times you go ""Oh hey, I bet there's no line at Buttermilk Channel.""",0,0,0,Alex R.,"Arlington, MA",44,185,6

So, i decided i was not going to stuff waffles and chicken in my face in such a tight space. I asked for the sunday pecan. Best.decision.ever.Let me describe: ice cream that isn't too sweet with homemade whip cream and some thing like caramel toffee and pecans. Perfection.

5.0,7/22/2013,"When I think of Buttermilk, I imagine a cute country cottage, which is exactly how it feels like when you walk in.  My friends had warned me that there's always a bit of a wait for brunch here, so we decided to get here by 10am.  We thought we'd be the only ones there thinking ahead by getting there right when it opens, because seriously, who really eats brunch at 10am when alcohol isn't served until noon?!  To our surprise, there were already a couple of groups of people outside waiting.  Luckily, they promptly opened the door at 10am, and seated everyone accordingly.  We opted for an outdoor seat since it wasn't too hot out.  Unfortunately for one of the tables, since their table was against the wall of the restaurant, they were directly below the windows of the apartments upstairs.  I think someone might've poured water or something outside their window, which landed all over the table's food!  The people who were sitting there explained the situation to their server and he kindly moved their table, and I assume they also got new plates of food.I ordered the Eggs Huntington and although it looked tiny, it surprisingly filled me up.  This might also have to do with the fact that my friends and I ordered ANOTHER entree, in addition to our individual ones, to share.  This, might I add, was the best decision ever that day! We ordered the Pecan Pie French Toast.  Now I don't usually like sweets for breakfast, but this french toast was unlike any french toast I've ever had.  The inside did not taste like bread at all, but it had more of a creamy custardy cake consistency.  That consistency mixed with the bourbon molasses was the perfect mix.  I wish all french toast tasted like this!!

5.0,7/22/2013,"Dinner Review (5/5)Brooklyn is the way to go for food! I came to Buttermilk Channel to celebrate my 26th Birthday and they especially made it extra special for me. I hope you get Polly as your server as she was very delightful!Decor:I adore the brick wall as it brings so much class to the restaurant. The bar to the side had gorgeous drop down lights, which are very elegant. Polly sat us to the corner of the restaurant next to a window lighted with tea-light candles. This gave a very romantic feel for the place as well as giving us our privacy. As I walked through the doors, the staff greeted us as if we were on their VIP list. Food:1) They started us with fresh baked fluffy bread with a glaze of honey dressing which was fantastic!2) Next we had their chilled zucchini and basil soup with pumpernickel bread and their flat bread appetizer. The chilled soup was very refreshing as it was a hot summer day and the flat bread was full of flavor. 3) Moving on to the main entrees: We had an order of the Parley Hake and their Duck Meatloaf. Normally, I don't order duck because it's very fatty, but Buttermilk Channel knew exactly what they were doing. It had the right blend of flavor and the meat was very tender and juicy. Originally, my Hake (which is a fish) was undercooked. Without question, Polly sent it back to the kitchen and asked the chef to make me a new plate. Second time around, the dish came out perfect!4) Last but not least, the desserts were the highlight of my night. We originally ordered  just one pecan pie sundae that came with our pre-fix meal, but Polly was extremely nice and threw in another dessert on the house. We ordered the chocolate lava cake and it was very rich in flavor. I believe it was the store manager or owner that walked by our table and asked how was our night going. We chit-chated a little and I told her that I came out here from Queens to celebrate my Quarter Century +1 Birthday. She immediately asked Polly to send out another scoop of vanilla bean ice cream with a waffle and a small birthday candle on top.  I was extremely impressed with the service I received from Buttermilk Channel. This isn't your average All American Restaurant. If you want to enjoy a very romantic evening with a special someone for a reasonable price, definitely come by here. Also, stop by on Mondays as they have a 3 course meal for only $28. Please remember to tip your waitress generously and let them know their service was appreciated. Would love to come back for future cravings!Brunch Review (3/5)I'm still leaving a 5 star review because I think their dinner menu is AWESOME! However, I wasn't a huge fan of their brunch menu. They now sell pork chop with cheddar waffle instead of the typical chicken and waffles. The pork chop was somewhat bland and dry while the waffle wasn't as fluffy as I wanted it to be.

I've been here for brunch and their brunch is great. Had their chicken and waffles then. I knew all about it before my company ordered them, so we move on. Candied bacon almonds should be served on those peanut trucks spread out across the city!Mustard glazed bacon is awesome especially with the frisée and golden raisins. Scallop dish is solid nothing outstanding to me. The duck meatloaf I found was great. Hearty, flavorful with a side of thick whipped potatoes to go with that jus was very satisfying. The Deer Hunter is a good way to start your night, gets the juices flowing with a good selection of beer on tap. Wine list is a good size and selection but it was a guys night out and really we know jack about wines. Coffee pot de creme is an enjoyable way to end the night.

It deserves a better name!  It's warm, flakey, buttery and sweet.  It's so light, it's as if an angel blew it's hot breath into some dough and then blessed it with a honeyed kiss before putting it onto my plate.  I could definitely eat like 10 of those.Okay so back to the other stuff.  The chicken was so crisp, it startled me when I bit into it.  You know good fried chicken by the sound it makes and let's just say that this piece of chicken crackled and sang a beautiful symphony that resonated deep within the confines of my stomach before touching my heart.  I did not care for the red cabbage slaw, took two bites and then gave up.  The cheddar waffles were also yummy, just waffles with a bit of creamy saltiness.  The maple/balsamic syrup is so good.  I begged my boyfriend to just pour it all over the chicken and the waffles (he refused to and will be having a stern talking to later on).  I got the hake which was moist and perfectly cooked.  It had a nice crunchy later on top and I could not get enough of the spicy sauce that it came with.  The pecan pie sundae was delicious.  I did have this one extremely unpleasant bite where it tasted like a lump of play-doh but I managed to wash it down with more pecan pie.  We got another dessert, I forgot what it was called but it's coffee flavored and it comes with two small, thin cookies.  It was also nice but I am definitely getting the pecan pie sundae all to myself next time.The staff was extremely attentive and recommended a great white wine that I really enjoyed.  The interior was elegant, simple and almost homey.  It was pretty noisy with all the people talking and loud music going so I couldn't really enjoy a conversation with my boyfriend.  But the food kept me busy so I'll let that slide.",1,0,0,Angela G.,"Bayside, NY",19,22,17

I much prefer fried chicken with my waffles as that pork chop was a little tough and lacking some flavor. Buttermilk pancakes were delicious and nice and thin. My friend said it was the best pancakes he ever had. The biscuits (it comes as 2) were also good; however, I am a sucker for buttermilk biscuits so I may be biased.

5.0,6/23/2013,"This is a great place to come for a dinner while waiting the hour or so to get called for your table at the nearby Lucali.Everything I ate here from the hot, complimentary popovers, to the extremely satisfying and rich dessert, was amazing. Even though I knew I was about to eat a large pizza once my name was called for dinner #2 at Lucali, I couldn't help but order a lot of food here since everything was so good.It seems to be tough to get a table here unless you get here pretty early, but we were lucky enough to snag a seat at the bar, where you can still order off the full menu.They brought us some hot, fresh, complimentary Popovers right when we sat down, so we were off to a very good start. I haven't seen a popover I haven't liked, and these were definitely up there with some of the best.For the entrees, given the name of the place and just about every reviewer mentioning it, we had to get the Buttermilk Fried Chicken ($22). It's worth the hype here - the fried chicken is amazing, and the waffles and slaw they come with are perfect complements. We also got the Duck Meatloaf ($24), which was incredible as well. It was so soft and tender and also pretty buttery.And yes, don't judge me, but we got a huge dessert too before dinner #2 - we saw several people ordering Doug's Pecan Pie Sundae ($8), so I just couldn't pass up on it. This was an amazing dessert - you get some huge chunks of pie combined with some really good ice cream for a perfect end to a great meal.The atmosphere in here is really nice too. It's got a hip crowd at times, but then also when we went it seemed to be a lot of families with little kids. And I guess as a mix of both of those crowds, I heard Beyonce brought Blue Ivy here recently for brunch.I'll definitely be back here, possibly for brunch next time, and not before another meal, so I can really order a lot of food.",13,6,9,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1694,69834
2.0,6/22/2013,"I struggle with giving this place 2 stars because the atmosphere was nice, the waiters were helpful, and we were seated rather quickly for a Saturday brunch (especially since we showed up at 2:45pm and brunch is over at 3).  With such a good start, how is it possible that I could give this place two stars? Simply, it was the food :-/. I had the fried pork chop with cheese waffles, my friend had pancakes with a side of sausage and eggs, and a 2nd friend had ribs hash with sunny side eggs. To start off, one friend found a hair in his food (NOT good, he simply took the hair out and starting eating, but had it been me, I would've FLIPPED my wig). He said his ribs and hash were ""ok, nothing to write home about"" nor was it anything to come back for. For a drink he had a drink that started with ""hunting"", which he liked but it came in the tiniest glass! Here's this 6'2 guy drinking out of a glass that looked like a child's tea set in his hand, and it cost $12! Ridiculous! My cheese waffles were actually pretty good, but the fried pork chop had no flavor. No seasoning, or anything. I ended up covering the pork chop in syrup to give it some taste.  I'd also had a side of their buttermilk biscuit and that also had no taste. I covered that in the jelly in order to eat it (and even then, I only ate one of the biscuits). My mimosa was pretty good (and believe me, I've been to restaurants where a mimosa isn't made correctly). My other friend said her pancakes were ""DELICIOUS!"" but she hated her sausage, and that too she didn't finish. Her side of eggs were ""ok"".

We split the spare ribs (which was good actually) and the fried chicken and waffles but when we ate it, it was completely tasteless. Absolutely the worst fried chicken we have ever ate before. When I asked my friend about this, she swore the chicken was salty when she had it so I guess the chef messed up our order and didn't season it at all.

Fantastically warm atmosphere, so romantically lit that you can barely see your food - which doesn't matter, because it's all delicious.

4.0,4/7/2013,"I wanted very badly to give this a five-star review. The food and drink at Buttermilk Channel are everything they're billed to be; we absolutely loved it. We went in a small group and sampled around the menu, getting a few seafood and a few meat dishes. My duck meatloaf with whipped parsnips was an absolute treat, the hake was perfectly moist, and the famed fried chicken was as good as advertised. The one drawback to the food was dessert, which was decidedly less inspired than the main courses; we'll be skipping it in the future.So why four stars? The restaurant itself is beautifully appointed, light, and open. The service is friendly and prompt. And they have a list of wines and draft beers (not to mention the full bar and cocktail list) to complement their superb food offerings. Unfortunately, we went to dinner on the early side of dinner (thank you, visiting parents), and in Carroll Gardens that means children are afoot. There is some inevitability to that - people do have kids, after all - but it is all but impossible to savor a glass of wine or enjoy a plate of steamed mussels when someone's child is running between the tables and neither the restaurant nor the parents seem inclined to do anything about it. My advice (which I will be heeding): go later, wait in line, and enjoy your meal without any children around.",1,0,0,Ty B.,"Portland, OR",3,10,0
5.0,4/7/2013,"I was with a friend on a Saturday afternoon and we were casually strolling around for a brunch spot. When we passed this spot, we both noticed some amazing-looking food on people's plates at the tables outside, particularly the french toast. We only had to wait 5 minutes for a table, and we both ordered it after the waiter said it's extremely good and probably the best choice. When our french toast arrived, the table next to us (with 6 people) gasped and asked us what that was and exclaimed how delicious it looked. It was immaculate. Just when I think I've had the best french toast of my life (at some spot in Manhattan), I come across this place and think it may have just taken the top spot. The pecan topping, the incredible texture of the crust and the inside, and some nonsensically delicious whipped cream-ish stuff on the side... perfection.

There is always a wait here for brunch on weekends so try to get here a little before it opens at 10am (and there will already be a short line outside, crazy!) They also do take reservations so that's a plus too, what a rarity in these days of snobby overplayed hip restaurants.My absolute favorite entree here is the scramble with hot sausages (since i'm not a poached or sunnyside egg type of person). My friends have tried other poached and benedict egg dishes and loved them just as much too. The pancakes are also fluffy and buttermilk-y the same way they are at Clinton St. Love!

We ordered cornbread to share in addition to my prix fixe, which included the tart, chicken & waffles, and bread pudding. The complimentary muffins(?) they started us off with were amazing and I've never had anything like it. They were like muffin shaped puff pastry glazed in a sweet sauce baked so that it was crispy yet chewy. I'm now in love with it. Cornbread, however, was not impressive and a bit dry. I just prefer mine moist with more flavor. The acorn tart was surprisingly good - flaky crust topped with cheese and greens. Chicken was nice and crispy, syrup had an interesting balsamic taste to it, and the overall dish was huge. Bread pudding was too sweet for me.

2.0,3/12/2013,"I was so excited to brunch here.Usually, it ends up being Frankie's 457 for brunch, since they open a little later (at 11) and the prices are more reasonable. And hey-- Frankie's never lets me down.But one morning, my parents were in town, so I met them + my brother and his wife at Buttermilk Channel for brunch. And we got a table immediately, because we were extra timely. And again-- I was so excited for this food. Everyone talked it up /so/ much.And it just wasn't that great. The French Toast was sickeningly too sweet, like couldn't eat it too sweet... And we love french toast.The pancakes were just okay.The corned beef hash was just okay.Here's what was really interesting, was when my boo ordered a cappuccino... And the waitress brought him what I could only describe as a shot of poorly-tamped espresso made in an older, imperfectly cleaned/maintained machine, and then with positively scorched milk just lumped on top. That's not a cappuccino. But we would've let that slide-- especially since, upon hearing the milk burning in the tin, we both turned around, and saw that our server was preparing the drink; not a real barista.But no.... Because when the server brought it over, she didn't just set it down in front of him, and sheepishly sulk away, embarrassed by the steaming cup of crap she'd just placed before a guest. She actually had the nerve/ disillusionment to loudly proclaim upon serving the drink ""This is like the best cappuccino I've ever made, it's sooo good!!!""....My boo just laughed, and I flatly said, ""Really? Because it's definitely not a cappuccino.""And the server just kinda seemed confused and smiled and walked away.HIRE A BARISTA IF YOU'RE GOING TO CHARGE SO MUCH FOR POORLY PREPARED ESPRESSO DRINKS, AND YOUR SERVER IS GOING TO TRY AND RECEIVE ACCLAMATION FOR SAID-CRAPPY DRINKS.In the meantime, we will leave the ridiculousness for the masses and stick to Frankie's 457!",1,4,0,Kathleen A.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,68,0

The service was good as my waiter was able to accommodate my mock-tail order with ease. There are no mock-tails on the menu. I guess the place was somewhat full, but not really packed. We ended up having to wait longer than I expected for our main entree to arrive. I ordered the duck meatloaf and was really happy with it. It was a small - regular portion which was fine with me. It was moist and interesting, but in a good way. My guest ordered the fried chicken, but was unfortunately, underwhelmed with it. The texture was good enough (juicy inside and crunchy outside), but it wasn't seasoned very well, if at all. I tried a small piece of the chicken and totally agreed with her. I honestly don't get what all the rave reviews over the chicken are for.

4.0,3/10/2013,"The vibe of Buttermilk Channel is quintessential ""New-Age Brooklyn"" - and that's not a bad thing!!!Sadly these days in both Manhattan and Brooklyn a lot of places try to manufacture that hip vibe and its usually quite apparent, and a turnoff in my opinion. At Buttermilk the buzz in the restaurant is completely inline with the stellar food on the menu. We went as a party of 4 and got to the restaurant at 8pm on a Saturday night and were fully prepared for an hour to hour and a half wait, they quoted us an hour and 45 minutes so we ended up going a few doors down to Palo Cortado for Sangria (which was good) while we waited. We got the call about an hour and 15 minutes later and were seated right near the front door. My fiancé and I sat against the window on a seat built into the wall which could have been more comfortable but not too bad. As for the food, we were brought out popovers for the table which were incredibly tasty and then ordered the little neck clams and the slow roasted pork spare ribs to start, both of which we enjoyed. The 4 main courses we ordered were 2 chicken and waffles, 1 burger and 1 flap steak. Everything was great, everyone seemed to enjoy what was ordered but nothing had that ""wow"" factor with the exception of the mashed potatoes (a must order) side which is the only reason I held off on the 5th star. After reading the other reviews we ordered 2 of the Pecan sundaes to share and that was a great decision - the sundae was without question the star of the show!

Still please play something a little less cheesy! Those feelings aside the dim lighting can cause waitresses to almost spill the water (close!) but can put you at ease. The bartender makes a good drink. I loved my Il Diavolo with tequila (yeaaa) bitters, cherry, and it was garnished with a pine leaf.They first served a toasted airy bread that was almost like a croissant but shaped like brioche. I wasn't sure but it was slighty crispy and filled with air in the middle. The appetizers offered included roasted chestnut soup which was creamy and excellent. The foie gras is actually not the best I've had but they intermix it with ham and I just don't like ham that much. The buttermilk fried chicken is key. That is what you come here for. Its extra crispy, juicy, not greasy like the chains and comes with syrup and a waffle (prix fixe on V-Day). The Duck meatloaf which is topped with foie gras and served on a bed of brussel sprout leaves is awesome. The risotto and chestnut ravioli with black truffle wasn't as flavorful as I expected (where was the truffle flavor that I love so much??) but it was good and I ate it all up anyway.Their pecan pie sundae is awesome.

Luckily we snagged two seats at the bar instead. Take that, families of five! We ordered prompty. Then we waited... and waited... The bar tender / server was very apologetic and even brought out complimentary jelly doughnuts to lift our spirits. And lift our spirits they did. The doughnuts were soft yet chewey and the strawberry jelly filling was divine! After one bite of the buttermilk pancakes, I could no longer fault them for the 25+ minute wait for our food. These were some of the best pancakes I had ever had. Perfectly simple and dusted with a snowy coat of powdered sugar. Yum. Would have given five stars save the slightly elevated prices.

And I'm so happy to have ordered it because it was AMAZING! Perfect breading, meat was moist and juicy and the sweet and savory combo was so satisfying.

We also ordered the rib hash, the ABC sandwich (apple, bacon, cheddar) and the pumpkin and butternut squash soup. I have no complaints about any of these dishes. The ABC sandwich was my friend's favorite - the ingredients were balanced so you could taste each ingredient distinctly; again, the perfect blend of sweet and savory.

Anyways, we got here and I ordered the butter milk fried chicken, honestly, the chicken wasn't significantly different from chicken that are in Popeye's, maybe the cook that night wasn't on his A game. My date had the ham wrapped blue fish which was A-ok.The spotlight of this place that night was definitely the dessert! Definitely get the pecan pie sundae!

5.0,1/21/2013,"Exceptional food and service within a room with exceptional natural light and interest. Clearly patronized by young families and with a great kids' menu.  Vegetarian menu is exceptional as well; essentially a modification of the dishes on the regular menu.  Owner/managers constant presence and interaction with patrons takes the service to high level as they respond to potential aggravations during peak dining period without even being asked.  Pumpkin & sweet potato soup, wilted kale and escarole salad, Caputo's fresh linguini and cheddar waffles are definitely recommended.  The desserts are the proverbial heavenly.  Great wine list with some exceptional selections.  Wish they'd serve some substantive bread but the popovers and even more the cornbread will do.",1,1,1,William J J.,"Cleveland, OH",0,17,0

5.0,1/21/2013,"One of my favorite restaurants in Brooklyn, Buttermilk Channel has consistently good food and enough variety to keep coming back. One of the most amazing things about this restaurant is how perfectly they cook their meat; the fried chicken (a signature dish) is always perfectly cooked and juicy, unlike any other chicken I've had. The ribs were amazingly tender without being mushy, and the burger I had (medium rare) was expertly done. I don't usually rave about burgers, but I have to say the burger at Buttermilk Channel is really well balanced and lets the quality and taste of the beef really shine. The service is also very good at Buttermilk; the wait staff is both knowledgeable and friendly, and very accommodating. On a recent visit I had a bit of a problem with the way one of my dishes was done and the waiter, kitchen and manager (owner?) were apologetic and quick to remedy it. No matter how good the food is, bad service can kill a restaurant and the owners of Buttermilk seem to understand that.My only complaint with the restaurant is that they don't take reservations, which means it's pretty typical to wait for 45 mins to an hour and a half if you're dining during prime time. And prime time starts pretty early as families in the area (with kids in tow) fill the restaurant by 6:30 or 7:00pm. The bar at Buttermilk is usually overcrowded, so it's worth going elsewhere for a drink before dinner, and thankfully the hostess will call your cellphone to bring you back when a table opens.All in all, Buttermilk Channel is not just a great neighborhood restaurant but a Brooklyn-class restaurant worth a trip.",0,0,0,Will E.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,40,1

The texture was a bit offputting but the sweetness and saltiness were good. Kale and Escarole salad to follow was good, but i wasn't sure if it had egg whites or cheese. The menu said pecorino but it tasted to bland we concluded it was egg whites. Brussel Sprouts side dish was coated in mustard, it was overwhelmingly mustuardy and spicy. I think a more subtle dressing or just less of it would have been on point. Chicken and Waffles were so-so. I think the waffles were supposed to be cheddar but they tasted plain. The chicken was fried very crisp, but i thought the flavor was lacking. To compare, my favorite fried chicken place in NY is Hill Country. The food wasn't bad, it just wasn't in line with my expectations after reading all these amazing reviews. Perhaps the chicken was bland after eating the super spicy mustardy brussels.

4.0,1/2/2013,"The brunch food at Buttermilk Channel is quite possibly the best in the area, but you may find the wait slightly off-putting.The first part of Buttermilk Channel you'll likely sample is the wait. And quite a wait it is too. In fact, if you're not from New York, it serves as quite an eye-opener as to how long locals are prepared to wait for their favourite tucker: up to an hour in Buttermilk Channel's case. In my case, only a bout of power-walking from my friend and I to get there for 10:30 kept the wait down to a mere 30 minutes.Once finally inside, you'll be greeted by the sight of well-groomed and rather contented locals from Cobble Hill. I can well believe that celebrities have been spotted here.The food goes some way towards meeting the hype, if not in my opinion all the way there. The stack of pancakes I helped myself to was probably the largest artfully arranged such stack I laid my eyes on, with delicate dustings of icing sugar and of pleasingly rough, hand-made shape. Very tasty they were too. I also had the much recommended fried pork chop, which was okay, if not really much more than its description: rather like a pork schnitzel but with the added inconvenience of bone and gristle to deal with. Still, it pleased me, as did the orange juice. The biscuits, however, were better at Prime Meats though.The service is okay: Quick, polite, but they made a slight (quickly rectified) error with one of our orders.Overall, a pleasant experience. If the waits were the same, I'd choose Buttermilk Channel over Prime Meats.

A lot of the people got discouraged with the wait time and left. We hung around and were luckily seating in less than 30 minutes. The hostess was nice enough to accommodate us quickly. Everything on the menu looked delicious. We ordered:Pecan Pie French Toast - This is the BEST french toast i have ever ever ever eaten. It's topped with bourbon, molasses and toasted pecans. A super delicious dish. The french toast just melts in your mouth and I loved every bite of it. It is overwhelmingly sweet so i recommend sharing this with someone. I ordered it as my main dish and was not able to finish it. The Roasted Mushroom, spinach and goat cheese scrambled is served with toast, hash brown and a small salad. The deep fried little hash brown was amazing. Small perfectly fried and full of flavors. The scramble was absolutely scrumptious. You can't go wrong with a combination of mushroom, spinach and goat cheese. Excellent dish!!Buttermilk Biscuits -  Side of buttermilk biscuits was just OK. They taste good if you eat it hot, but if you leave them for a few minutes, they are average. Not the best biscuits i have had!I will definitely come back here for more.

My friends and I all got the $25 3-course special and since there were 3 of us we got to try one of everything on the menu. I had the apple and turnip salad which I loved even though I hate turnips. I tried a little of everyone's entrees and my favorite was definitely the bluefish; I just wish there was more of it especially when you compared it to my fried chicken entree. I loved the crispy crust, but most importantly how they didn't overcook the chicken breast. Dry fried chicken is the worst. (I even microwaved a piece the next day and it was still super moist!) But it wasn't anything super special. The pecan pie sundae was as tasty as everyone said it'd be. But overall, I don't think I'd come back here...unless it was a Monday of course.

2.0,12/16/2012,"I very recently decided to try the Buttermilk Channel for dinner, based on the recommendation of the people who work at a very good local restaurant.  I was disappointed to say the least.  The service was terrible, and the food was mediocre, with a 'flare' that was absolutely disgusting - coming from a person who has no problem doing their own hunting and dressing of animals.When I arrived, I stood in the doorway and had to wait about 5 minutes before I could get a very gruff waitress to answer that I did have to wait for the hostess to give me a seat, which took another few minutes.  Then the same waitress dropped off my menu and didn't even say welcome.  After a bit longer than was necessary a drink steward finally took my drink order, followed by the original waitress who wasn't at all pleased that I had some questions about their appetizer portions.  I ordered their Muscles appetizer and their Steak dinner, and patiently waited.The complimentary bread course was promptly delivered, and started the meal out in a pleasing fashion, but after a pause, the Muscles began the disappointing spiral downward.  The Muscles weren't very well cooked, some were rubbery, while some were cool.  The tastes had promise, if the dish were better executed.  I had to use my bread plate for the muscle shells until with about 5 muscles left the waitress FINALLY brought me a larger plate for the shells, the bread plate overflowing with the other half dozen muscle shells.I was still willing to give it a better rating, until the dinner came - and had a big foul-smelling bone on it.  I was upset that the waitress hadn't asked about sides and since she didn't come back until half way through the Appetizer I couldn't order the Brussels sprout side.  So instead of just giving me a plate with the meat and garnish (which would have been good) they also included a big hunk of bone that just stunk up the whole meal.  Smell is a very integral part of any meal, and for the chef to include the bone, stinky as it was, shows that they either don't care or only value looks.I won't be going back even to try the cheddar waffles, and I hope your experience is better than mine was.",0,0,0,Alaric S.,"Temecula, CA",0,11,3
5.0,12/15/2012,"I shlepped all the way to Carroll Gardens knowing I'd have to go even further home but it was well worth the trip.I appreciated the restaurant's atmosphere and home-like feel.  The menu was pretentious but the ambiance was not.  A little discouraged by the unique choices, I came for one and only thing:  fried chicken.Monday nights they have a $25 menu special, which consists of 3 courses, an appetizer, entree and dessert.  One is left with two choices in each course.When you first sit down, they bring you honey glazed popovers with a dash of sea salt.  Absolutely delicious, but I warn you that you should eat these with a fork and knife and not your hands.  If you use your hands, be prepared to get up and go wash your hands in the bathroom because you will get the honey all over them.Next course, sweet potato soup with crostini with pumpkin butter spread.  I think the soup also may have had butternut squash in it.  It was delicious, natural, and something I think I could make at home.  I would have liked to see a dollop of creme fraiche on top.  (FYI the crostini can be sticky too so be careful when handling).Entree, fried chicken.  It's pretty much half of an entire chicken, so go hungry.  The chicken has a perfect layer of fried goodness on top that was so good I could have eaten it by itself.  The chicken was very moist and flavorful.  Underneath you find two large waffels which honestly I lost my interest in them because I was so into the chicken.  There was a side of syrup which I think had a cherry flavor but I'm not certain, and the cole slaw that didn't have any mayo was a great side.  Our waiter was really nice and served us a side of mashed potatoes on the house.  I get there was tons of food, but if you go you should order the mashed potatoes, they were fluffy and I could have had the entire container if I wasn't sharing it with other people.Dessert - Coffee pot de creme.  So creamy and delightful.  The coffee beans on top cracked as I bit down and got stuck in my teeth so I could have gone without that, and I wasn't really interested in the cookies that came along with it.To sum it up, the service was great, the Monday night special was a bargain, and the restaurant itself was inviting.

2.0,12/10/2012,"For a Brooklyn restaurant to have over 600 mostly stellar reviews is some impressive feat, no doubt.  Buttermilk Channel is one of those few Brooklyn reaturants that has achived this.  And with that said, I now say the following five words: I just don't get it.I won't be as pretentions as to say ""this place is"", but rather ""I found this place to be"".  I found this place to be so overrated.  My disappoinment raneth over after eating here.  Everything was just so, well, meh.I'll give the place 4 stars for ambiance and service.  That I cannot take away from this place.  It's beautful inside, boasts a nice crowd, and the staff are extremely attentive.  But the food just disappointed, big time.First off, if you're going to do Chicken and Waffles, you've got to do it right.  I know my Chicken and Waffles.  I live in Harlem and eat it all the time, plus I've spent lots of time in the South eating the real deal, as well. Buttermilk Channel's Chicken and Waffels tasted more like something they just shouldn't have tried to make.  I also had the steak.  Cooked medium.  It was like rubber, and not any flavor to at least make up for the rubber feel.  Just so disappointing.  The bone marrow sauce seemed rather gimmicky too.  It did not have the best flavor, and it was a pain to get to.  I had to dig into the bone to get it.  Another thing that bothered me was the Sangiovese wine.  It was as cold as ice.  When I asked the waiter why, he responded because it's wine on tap.  Wine on tap?  Dear Lord, I'm not even going to start on that one.  Just all wrong.  Red wine should not be served cold, and not from a tap (lest samples be served like in some wine stores).I've been waiting years to go to this reaturant, and once I finally did, I was really so sad that it disappointment me this way.  I think it's fair to say I won't be back.  I would say, to be fair to the restaurant, that my review goes well against the grain of so many other great reviews.  But frankly, again, I just don't get it.  I have the feeling this place's ambiance may trick people in believeing the food is better than it really is.",7,2,2,Jason M.,"Little Falls, NJ",450,241,44

The mousse came with some nice fresh whipped cream, and that was wonderful. But they topped the dessert with what seemed like some pretzels right out of a bag. It just didn't do it for me.

This time, my wife and I decided to try out staying in Carroll Gardens in Brooklyn, not only for a change in pace but to see how the area has transformed from the time I used to attend Polytech.My nephews, who live in the area, said we had to try out Buttermilk Channel. The menu looked great so we headed over to meet them (plus one of my nephew's girlfriend) there on a Tuesday night. It's a smallish size place but the atmosphere was pretty cool and we were set up with a table right by the window. The wait staff was very attentive and service was overall pretty good. Another thing we all liked was the nice draft beer menu as well as the good wine list (not too expensive).We each started out with an appetizer. I had the butternut squash and pumpkin soup. That was made with coconut milk not cream which was not only great for the flavors, it was perfect for those who are lactose intolerant! Super tasty without the heavy cream overtones. My wfe had the kale salad to start and loved it. For the main course, all the guys picked one of their Tuesday dinner specials, the lamb shank. I've got to say that it was one of the better lamb meals I've had in a while (big thumbs up). It was both a decent size portion plus the meat was tender and nicely cooked.

4.0,11/20/2012,"I really want to love Buttermilk Channel. I really, really, really do. The food is definitely five stars but the service is bordering on three. I'm torn on giving it four stars, but here you go. Four shiny stars.Weekday evenings are probably less crowded than the weekends, especially for brunch! And they don't take reservations, so you'll have to take your chances then.The fried chicken with the cheddar waffles are a must! The skin of the chicken bursts with flavor and is crispy, an essential for fried chicken. The seasoning and flavors are perfection.Service is a bit strange and awkward. We had two different people waiting on us, asking us the same questions, even after we explained that the other person was helping us. We were waiting for our food when we saw our plates delivered to the table next to us. They had ordered the same thing. And they had ordered after us. It was difficult to flag down someone to get my water refilled. The delivery of the check was very strange as well. After we received the bill, they only charged the card for a portion of the meal.  Nice, discount, right? But being a woman of the utmost integrity, I pointed that out to them so they could fix it. Charge me more, darn it! That was a strange incident.Even with these strange mishaps, Buttermilk Channel still manages to be a 4 star establishment, as fried chicken speaks the language of my heart.

A golden brown, perfectly fried, meaty pork chop with cheddar waffles of course (happy face). It was damn good! What a lovely combo.

The broth was perfect, and definetly wasnt your normal white wine broth. The clams were allright, wish the portion was a bit bigger. The chicken liver mousse was the ultimate winner for the night as it came with this thin crispy cracker-like bread to be spread on. The mousse was extremely RICH and chilled, it was perfect.

4.0,10/2/2012,"Buttermilk Channel is one of those restaurants with a split personality. Let me explain.First, there's the Buttermilk Channel during brunch, where you'll end up waiting at least an hour while the cranky hostess may or may not actually be nice to you, and then, after an extra spicy bloody mary or two, you'll sit down to a delicious meal that makes up for the attitude and the wait.And then there's the Buttermilk Channel for dinner, not very crowded even on a Monday night when they do their $25 prix fixe special. You might have to wait a little bit, but the bar and hostess are very accommodating. The food itself is where they shine--the popovers, salad, ham wrapped bluefish and thick grits are all great choices, and you can't go wrong with their classic fried chicken and cheddar waffles. For dessert make sure you get the pecan pie sundae (nothing else compares, and I don't especially like regular pecan pie).

4.0,9/19/2012,"One of my favorite meals in Brooklyn,by far.  I have been meaning to make it out to this destination for some time.  My deep love of southern food and fried chicken made this place seem perfect, and in many ways it was.We opted out of the prefix special on Mondays, just so we can try more stuff on the menu.  We started out with the bbq'd oysters which were fantastic.  Considering, I shuck about 100 a day, it was nice to have them prepared in a completely different way.  After that, we had the flat bread.  The ricotta was delicious, but it seemed very thin and soggy by the time we were halfway done eating it.  It was nice to see the squash blossom/ricotta combination done differently, rather than stuffing and deep frying it.Then for our main courses we had the fried chicken and waffle, and the duck meatloaf.  I thought the fried chicken was fantastic.  The crispiest I've had.  I wish I knew how they do it.  It is seasoned perfectly.  The coleslaw was terrible and disappointing at most.  It tasted bland as could be.  I am not sure, but maybe they just cut some up some cabbage and put it on the plate.  The waffle was pretty good.  I only got an aftertaste of cheddar, wish it was more flavorful.  The duck meatloaf was delicious.  The onion rings on top were great, I am pretty sure it's the same batter as the fried chicken because both were equally crunchy.  The corn pudding was weird, seemed just like shucked corn on the plate with some seasonings.  I usually want corn pudding to be baked goodness.  We finished with the pecan pie sundae which was pretty good.  I was surprised.  I thought it would be a real pecan pie with vanilla ice cream, rather than a deconstructed version, but still very tasty.  The drinks were okay.  I had two beers which were alright.  I thought the service was good, but way too overwhelming.  I thought after the 4th person asked us if we needed anything it was time to chill out.  I like good service, but sometimes I am just trying to unwind and do not need someone interrupting every sentence I try to have.  The server was knowledgeable about the menu, but honestly, I don't feel I need to know what ricotta is.  Overall, great experience, I would love to try brunch, but the massive wait leaves me astray.",1,0,0,D F.,"Brooklyn, NY",58,5,0

4.0,9/6/2012,"Buttermilk Channel was a lovely, solid restaurant to take my boyfriend for his birthday dinner.Tuesday night is free corkage, so we brought a nice bottle of Grenache and they opened it and poured it immediately so it could breathe a bit. Service was friendly and appropriately timed. The only thing that was a little weird was a food-allergy issue. I told the waitress I'd heard great things about the popovers they bring instead of a bread basket, but that I had a dairy allergy so could she please check whether I could eat them? She did, and they did contain dairy. She then brought two popovers (one for each of us?) and put it in the middle of the table (for us to share?) although I'm allergic to them. It's not a big deal, but the small gestures sort of make a big difference- some dairy-free bread would have been nice!The menu isn't particularly friendly to someone with a dairy allergy, but we managed to eat really well.We started with some tasty snacks: Brooklyn Pickles, as well as MAPLE-BACON ROASTED ALMONDS. Get. These. They are SO GOOD. You get a LOT here, like probably enough for four people. We took half of them home. The almonds are sort of akin to the Nuts for Nuts guys on the street (those sugary delights that smell like Christmas) but with a salty-maple thing going on. And crusted right in there were very hefty chunks of thick-cut bacon (house cured, I believe). If you like salty-sweet-fatty (aka, if you're a person with taste buds and a conscience), you'll love these.I got the warm lamb and romaine salad. They were nice about substituting the dressing for one that did not contain dairy. Each component of this salad was delicious, but it wasn't the most cohesive dish I could imagine. That being said, the lamb was plentiful, succulent, and melted in my mouth. The kalamata olive bread croutons were nice, although seemed a little stale (I think they were just poorly toasted, or grilled, or whatever. I think they should have either left them fresh or really gone all out and pan-grilled them in olive oil!) The roasted cauliflower and fried capers were lovely, and the soft-boiled egg was a great finish. The romaine was fresh and crunchy, despite being among these warm components.  When I say the dish wasn't cohesive, it wasn't as though pairs of ingredients didn't seem to go together, it just wasn't executed quite as well as I would have hoped from Buttermilk Channel, given all the rave reviews. That being said, I did eat the salad with a different dressing than the chef normally uses, and this salad is by no means one of their famous dishes (compared to the fried chicken, the duck meatloaf, or the pecan pie sundae for example). I loved eating it, and I would even recommend that you order it if you like lamb! My boyfriend got the market salad (nectarines, radishes, mixed greens) to start, and then the duck meatloaf. His salad was particularly non-cohesive. The nectarines were completely unripe, and the lime dressing didn't do much for the salad. We both agreed that the mixed greens seemed busy, and that sticking to plain baby arugula or spinach might have made more sense. The duck meatloaf, however, was OUT OF THIS WORLD awesome. Please, please order this. It's succulent and rich, on a delicious fresh corn pudding (I didn't try the pudding but my boyfriend alleges it was wonderful). On top of the meatloaf (which incidentally looks rather small but ends up being an incredibly hearty portion) is a GIANT wonderful crispy onion ring. Each component of the dish stands on its own and melts into perfect harmony with the rest of it. I can't recommend it any more strongly!We lingered after the meal over our bottle of wine, and we were so pleased by the relatively small pricetag on the bill- definitely owing to the fact that it was free corkage night and we didn't have to pay for drinks$s$s. We were rather disappointed that Beyonce didn't make an appearance, since she and my boyfriend share a birthday we thought maybe Jay Z would take her there like he did for New Years Eve.

5.0,8/31/2012,"Did you know that Buttermilk Channel was the name of the (walkable) channel that used to exist between Brooklyn and Governor's Island?

We arrived here for the Monday night prix-fixe, and everything was divine. The salad, fried chicken and cheddar waffles (or the bacon wrapped trout - we did exchange a few pieces), and the pecan ice cream sundae were all delicious. At $25 a set, it was practically a steal. The greatest find of the night was probably the Torrentes wine. Recommended by both the bartender and our waiter, the wine is more ""orange"" (fermented with the grape skin) rather than white and it was a wonderfully complex and full wine.

3.0,8/14/2012,"It's like most people think the hour+ wait for brunch is a necessary part of the brunch experience but on a Sat or Sun morning/afternoon when I'm STARVING, long waits are not an option. Luckily, I came here close to opening time with my bf in the spring and we only waited about 20 minutes.I listened to fellow Yelpers and got the hash browns and doughnuts to start. The jelly doughnut was good although a bit small - I much rather prefer to get one double in size for the same price from Dough. The hash browns were a HUGE disappointment because they taste the same as McDonald hashbrowns.I ordered the eggs huntington and subbed the canadian bacon for lox for a small fee. The lox was such a small portion of thinly cut smoked salmon that it was barely visible underneath my egg. Other than that, it was just a standard poached egg with hollaindaise sauce. My boyfriend's fried porkchop and cheddar waffles were much more enjoyable and interesting than my dish, although I wonder why they don't serve the more traditional fried chicken with this dish...Service was whatevs, nothing special but I wasn't expecting amazing service during the super busy brunch time.

Bacon Grilled Cheese on a hot and humid day was not a good choice on my part, which really had nothing to do with Buttermilk Channel.The restaurant is really warm and inviting and casual. Despite the hipstery trend and weird attire that we saw the staff wearing, our lunch was incredibly enjoyable and it was really nice to just kick back and relax.Get their biscuits, they were delicious too and tasted like real southern biscuits.Caveat: I had a bellini here and it was $4 and perhaps the WORST bellini i have ever had.

Hooray.We sat behind a couple -- a normal girl and a guy who looked like a fat McLovin (McChubbin). I ordered a mediocre cosmo and my friend The Gentian Sling. He didn't really like it. That's my drink review.We split the Chicken Liver Mousse and the Rabbit Rillettes. Both excellent.I had the Duck Meatloaf, which was outstanding. It tasted like unicorn meat (magical and soft). It came with one onion ring, but the ring was so big it was like maybe five onion rings combined into one. The best part about the onion ring was that it was crispy and didn't slug on your face (you know how sometimes you bite into an onion ring and the whole sloppy soggy onion comes out and burns your chin with all its grease? Yeah, it didn't do that). Lastly, on the bottom, was the ginger puree. Lighter than mashes potatoes and sweeter in taste, it went perfectly with my loaf of dead duck and fried onion circlet (which was so big I could have worn it as a small crown). As we ate, McChubbin  began arguing with his girlfriend. ""I have allergies to cats and to dogs,"" he complained, ""and I want you to take that more seriously. It's like every time I tell you, you just shrug me off. I want to be comfortable! Breathing is something I actually enjoy!"" I could see her body heaving with her deep sighs. I wondered what she was doing with such a Khaki pants monster. He went on to complain about her ""saying what he wanted to hear but not being genuine enough about it"" and later exclaimed ""I MADE A MISTAKE I DONT KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU!"" when she quietly countered his attacks with a comment of her own. My friend got the burger, which was forgettable. I forgot that he had it until I asked him. He liked it. He described it as ""whatever.""Watching McChubbin  made me think of a great idea for a sitcom: The Most Annoying Man in the World. It would be about a guy who everyone hates, even the audience. No redeeming qualities. Nothing remotely likable about that person. Just an annoying, pretentious, anal, condescending-yet-unintelligent dude who walks around being The Most Annoying Man in the World. We also had the house pickles, which were good but ""just pickles."" They could have come from a jar. Buttermilk Channel's outdoor seating area is dog-friendly as long as your dog sits outside the little barrier-thing, which allows him to stay super close to you while staying out of the server's way.

The mussels had this green chile sauce that was sooo good. The mozzarella was sooo fresh and the anchovy basil sauce was such a nice touch. As the main course I had the chicken and waffles, the chicken was sooooo delicious. The waffles were incredible, not your traditional one either. They were cheddar waffles...YUM!

4.0,6/20/2012,"Despite getting lost twice en route, I'm glad we stuck with our original plan to visit Buttermilk Channel.   Everything I could ask for in a restaurant:  delicious food; fantastic and charismatic service; great décor and ambience.  Finding it was like a Godsend. Our waitstaff was kind and very helpful.  He brought us nuts and bacon when they found out about our plight to find the restaurant, and he helped us find our way back to the subway to get home. Talk about service!You must have the buttermilk fried chicken with cheddar waffles.  It may go against everything I believe in terms of healthy eating, but it was so worth it.  The chicken feels more like it is baked; it does not have the same greasy and heavy feeling that fried chicken usually has. And while some of you are thinking ""cheddar waffles?"", let me assure you the cheddar gives the waffle a nice, sharp bite.Benton's Ham Wrapped Trout was almost as good.   I don't think I've ever had grits before; they were a nice touch to the meaty, flavourful fish. Dessert was my favorite part of the meal.  While my wife won the main course pickin', my dessert choice buried her's.  I don't care how stuffed you are, order Doug's Pecan Pie Sundae.  It is exactly as it sounds: pecan pie and ice cream served in a parfait glass like a real sundae.  The pecan pie is nice and sweet, and when mixed with the ice cream, it is such a nice finish to the meal.   The chocolate chunk bread pudding was a very nice dessert, just no pecan pie sundae.  Salted chocolate butterscotch is a nice contrast to the sweet chocolate.The decor is quite nice and the atmosphere has a class vibe to it.  There's just something about it that makes you feel very cool.   If you're looking for a nice place to take a date, take that person here.",2,1,1,Jacob K.,"Vancouver, Canada",68,82,1

""Thing One"" smartly observed that since the last time she ate at Chez Panisse she had not enjoyed a complex meal where the original and unique flavors all worked as an ensemble, but stayed totally distinct. She had the mussels in green chili sauce and a salad. (I am so proud of her ability to articulate what makes a good meal special: a great Father's Day gift!) The warm lamb salad with soft boiled eggs, roasted cauliflower and olive-bread croutons was, simply sublime(See picture). The Eggs were so rich and fresh it makes me lament how base supermarket eggs are, even when cage free and all of the other marketing pablum I pay extra for is figured in. The fried chicken and cheddar waffles my partner and son enjoyed were sparkling: the sweet-savory syrup served with it brought everything to life. I was most impressed by the subtlety sweet-savory cheddar waffles, which were light, crispy and not overpowering: slightly sweet and mildly cheddary. We all loved everything (even Thing Three's kiddy meal of pasta with red-sauce was perfect). The deserts were amazing: strawberry icecream that tasted like farmer's market strawberries was amazing.

2.0,6/10/2012,"Two stars for the decor.  Went Saturday for dinner..5 o'clock.  Ordered slab of cheese and got. 1 inch x 1  1/2 inch piece of cheese with a condiment cup of honey and a condiment cup of wet grapes....as app cheese was tasty but not enough.   Mussels were good in a green chile sauce as per husband and son.   The complimentary popovers were burnt tasting but could have been awesome...with something sprinkled on them rather than thrown on a dish and a drop and I mean a drop of honey on the dish for 3 of them.  Wine glass for 12$ was filled  1/3 rd of the way.  I had the trout wrapped in ham.....the Smell of the ham made me feel like I was on a farm or at the zoo in the pigpen....it was that strong of a foul odor....the fish was deboned wrapped in the ham, NOT...I picked out at least 9 small bones...thanks.    The grits were cold and mushed together so I thought it was mashed potato, when I told the waitress I ordered the grits she laughed and said it was grits....sorry waitress...it was like eating cold mashed potato...sweet peas side was good but the 6oz serving size did not merit the cost.    My husband had the dried out, tasteless...no seasoning at all, fried chicken...so hard and dry on the outside, and dry on the inside as well...my son had the lobster....2 bites of lobster and it's over....we had the pecan Sunday which was good but nothing special.....I had a stomach ache all night and I can't eat breakfast this morning...thanks buttermilk, you won't see me again....what a waste of $180.",1,0,0,Christine D.,"Bergen County, NJ",26,64,30

5.0,6/5/2012,"Yes, you usually have to wait for a table at Buttermilk Channel, especially since Beyonce and Jay-Z made it all cool & trendy and whatever, but with good reason. The food here is great. To be honest, the one time I had dinner here I had the pasta dish, and it was good, but not mind-blowing in any way. BUT the pecan pie sundae I had for dessert more than made up for it. The cocktails are also pretty great.As far as service is concerned, I've never had a bad experience here. One time I put my name down for brunch for 3, and then waited about an hour for the table while my two friends arrived. My name was called, and my one friend still hadn't arrived, but they still let us sit down. He was massively late, we must've been sitting without him for like 10 or 15 minutes, but the waitress didn't hassle us at all and was very nice, which I didn't expect (seeing as brunch is about as sacred as Christmas mass in New York City, and most places won't even let you in the door if your full party isn't present and ready to sit down.) I appreciated her patience with us, and we had a great time. The food was phenomenal (I prefer the brunch to the dinner, hello pecan pie french toast!)Anyway, sometimes a good thing is worth the wait.

4.0,6/3/2012,"Went here for brunch today.  Cheddar waffles were bomb.  Nice mix between savoury and sweet.  i had the home cured salmon.  it was well done.  we were a party of 5, and everyone got a different dish.  cant complain about any. loses a star because i called ahead for a reservation and when i showed up they said that it wasnt a real reservation because they dont do that. on the phone i said ""id like a reservation for 1"" meaning 1 pm.  she said we only do reservations for 5.  i said perfect, i have 5 ppl for 1pm.  we get there, and there is a crowd, and we have no reservation.  huh?  so whereas i shouldve been seating by 1, we didnt sit till about half an hour later.  bellinis and mimosas for $4 are totally worth it, although many brunch places offer these as part of your meal.  short rib hash was delish. waffles were decadent, more like a desert than brunch.  lamb was tender.",1,0,0,Samantha A.,"Brooklyn, NY",167,20,27

The hush puppies were also really good. We also ordered the buttermilk fried chicken and the duck meatloaf.

5.0,5/26/2012,"Buttermilk Channel often has long waits but I will say that it's one of those places that's totally worth it.  Your best bet is to go early-- right when they open for brunch or right when they start their dinner service.  I've been here a bunch of times & nothing is ever bad.  Some highlights are the pecan pie french toast (rich & decadent but SO GOOD) & the fried chicken & cheddar waffle.  Their homemade breakfast sausage is both sweet & spicy & incredibly delicious.  For dinner I've gotten a great fried pork chop with the cheddar waffle.  But my favorite meal was their duck meatloaf with a Huckleberry sauce & a big golden onion ring on top.  Good lord.  It wasn't just my favorite meal at Buttermilk Channel, but one of the best I've had in the city!!  And I'm not even THAT big a duck fan.  Definitely give this place a shot-- just go early or else prepare to wait a while.  (The pay-off is worth it though!)",3,0,1,Matt P.,"Brooklyn, NY",68,120,8

2.0,5/20/2012,"Seeing all the amazing reviews for this place, I have to admit I was expecting some amazing food. The place is cute and the service was good, so I really wanted to like this place and find my new favorite fried chicken, but it was no where along those lines.Walking into the restaurant, instead of being hit by delicious aromas of fried chicken, all I smelled was a hint of mold and dirty mop water. That was a bad way to set the tone for dinner.The chicken was ok, but would not even make the top ten in my mind. The thigh was juicy, but the breast was dry and bland. Also shared a rib-eye, and it was a decent piece of meat, but no real char from the grill or any flavor. And it sat in a pool of some reduction, which was not very aesthetically pleasing.I wish my meal lived up to the other reviews, but it definitely did not.",3,0,0,Diane Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",247,1155,126
3.0,5/18/2012,"Nice spot, I can see why it is so popular. But holy SALT. And let me assure you, I love salt, like eat half jars of pickles at home while making dinner LOVE salt. But their food was over-seasoned. That being said, I loved the decor, the staff was very nice, and the service was effortless. No attitude! We waiting exactly 45 minutes, as we were told by the hostess we would. She took our cell number so we could wander down the street for a cocktail. Our waitress was helpful with the menu, suggesting that if we shared a few starters and snacks that probably one entree would be enough for my friend and I. It's so refreshing to have a waitress who is honest and not trying to up-sell the entire bill! We shared a bottle of Gruet, a nice minerally sparkling wine that goes with pretty much anything. We had the pickles which were awesome (and appropriately salty), the BBQ'd oysters, which were succulent, smoky, and beautifully presented. The mustard greens salad had radish, pickled sunchoke, and dried pear (I think) and was lightly dressed. Then came our entrees- the famous chicken and the hake. Now the chicken was mouth numbingly salty. I felt like my tongue was shriveling. Had it been incredibly juicy and succulent, I would have been more understanding about the saltiness, but I think this order was slightly over cooked. It was a shade darker than I would have preferred, and tasted accordingly. The battered coating was hard and the interior was barely clinging to its last drop of moisture. The hake was a let-down as well, the sweet mild fish was bread-crumbed to death, reminiscent of a filet o fish. The vinegary beans served with it were also a bit too sour and salty for the dish. It wasn't up to par with the rest of the meal, even the salty chicken. I will definitely go back, as there were more pros than cons, but I'd probably order heavy on the apps and maybe skip the mains all-together. I would also only go here with a party of 2 maximum, as there are very few larger tables and a tiny dining room.",0,0,0,Katherine B.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,34,0
5.0,5/17/2012,"My boyfriend and I have wanted to try Buttermilk Channel since moving to Brooklyn in August. The only question I have, after our dinner this week, is: WHY DID WE WAIT SO LONG TO GO TO BUTTERMILK CHANNEL?Seriously, top five meals I've had in the NYC area. We went on a Tuesday - free corkage night! - and as soon as we walked in, the waitress brought us wine glasses. The place was pretty empty at 6:30 but when we left at 8:30, it was jammed. It's a small restaurant, but very charming, with soft lighting and an attractive wooden bench lining one wall. The food. We started with the House-made Pickles: both spears and rounds, which were delicious. I think they used a special kind of vinegar, because I'd never had anything like it. If you like pickles even a little, you must try these. As were enjoying the pickles, our waitress brought out a plate with two complimentary popovers (still hot from the oven!) drizzled with honey and sprinkled with flaky sea salt. It melted in my mouth.For entrees, we shared the oft-mentioned Buttermilk Fried Chicken with Cheddar Waffle, and the salad with olive-croutons, fried capers, fresh mozzarella, and soft egg. The chicken was amazing - a little hard to eat, but so tender and flavorful, my mouth is watering just remembering it. The salad was unbelievable - the croutons were little pieces of bread studded with pieces of kalamata olives, and the fried capers crunched between my teeth. So satisfying.When the waitress took away our entree plates, my boyfriend said, ""I think we should get dessert, because I think dessert here is going to be REALLY good."" Normally I don't order dessert out, because it tends to be overpriced, and I'm more of a savory person, but I had a feeling he was right. The dessert was amazing! I had a coconut pot de creme, which managed to be sweet without being cloying or overpowering, maybe because it was cut with light whipped cream and crunchy flakes of roasted coconut. My boyfriend had the chocolate chunk bread pudding, which, for all of you chocolate lovers, was fantastic.The best part? The bill for all of that food came to $60, or $35/person with tip. Not something I can afford to do every week, but I feel like I got MORE than my money's worth.Go! Buttermilk Channel is calling.",3,1,1,Claire M.,"New York, NY",302,343,13

4.0,4/8/2012,"Buttermilk Channel.I didn't realize that it was named after an actual body of water. I thought it was named after the buttermilk fried chicken.Which wouldn't be that bad. I heard about the restaurant in my search for chicken and waffles. The waffles didn't disappoint. The chicken...surprisingly did. Which is why the restaurant gets 4 stars.While the buttermilk crust has a delicious crunch and the chicken was juicy (borderline undercooked but just right), I guess I was expecting a little more flavor in the actual chicken itself.It is a wonderful restaurant. It seats about 50 I would say, so it's not the largest space, but the environment and ambiance is cozy and comfortable - AKA - perfect date spot. They don't do reservations for less than 6 so watch your timing - this place fills up quickly and the wait can be kind of long (mines was about 30-45 minutes).The service was great and for you beer and wine connoisseurs, there's a great selection (not fond of it myself).The cheddar waffles are delicious. Not too cheesy, but a good hint of cheddar and sweetness in the dough. The syrup was a nice flavor with a fruity reduction taste.The 'bread service' honey with salt popovers would be so much better if they weren't as brown and crispy as they were.Also, the dessert? Marvelous. I had the chocolate bread pudding with salted butterscotch and side of their ice cream - yummo.The prices are a bit high ($15-20+ for an entree), but the environment, ambiance, and service are worth it.

5.0,3/21/2012,"Came on a Tuesday Night, and did not have to wait. Sat outdoors and enjoyed the nice breeze. It was such a relaxing serene feeling. Buttermilk Channel definitely has a great atmosphere. And, the foods were very delicious! Service was good too.We ordered: 1) BBQ Oysters with Smoked Bacon & Green Onions, 2) Caputo Handmade Mozarella w/ Basil & Warm Anchovy Sauce, 3) Hanger Steak, 4) Buttermilk Fried Chicken, 5) Pecan Pie Sundae, and 6) Coconut Pot de Creme w/ Pistachio Shortbread.The BBQ Oysters with smoked bacon and green onions was alright. I am not a big fan of oysters so I didn't really enjoy them as much as I should. The oysters are fresh, and seasoned with bbq, bacon and green onions. The oysters were quite small, and is a bit pricey as each oyster cost $3 each. We ordered 6 pieces of oysters, and that was already $18.The Caputo handmade mozarella w/ basil and warm anchovy sauce (which comes with 2 small pieces of bread) was truly delicious! It was very fresh, and savory. The anchovy sauce complemented the mozarella and bread well.The Hanger Steak was another delicious item. It was very tender, and tasty. This dish also came with a bone marrow, which was an interesting culinary experience. The salad that came with this side was very fresh and crisp.The Buttermilk Fried Chicken dish was my most favorite.The fried chicken was so crispy on the outside, and tender on the inside. Definitely one of the best fried chickens (that comes with the waffle combos) I have eaten. I was a bit disapointed with the cheddar waffles. I prefer the waffles from Clinton St. Baking more. The cabbage slaw was good - not too much mayo on it.The Pecan Pie Sundae was good, but it was not that astounding. The pecan pie pieces were a bit too sweet for me. However, I was very fond of the vanilla ice cream. The Coconut Pot de Creme w/ Pistachio Shortbread (Dessert) was truly amazing! I wish we ordered 2 of these (instead of the Pecan Pie Sundae). The coconut creme was out of this world, and the pistachio shortbread was so tasty. I did not see this dessert on their menu online, so I am assuming that they change their dessert options often. But, I hope they will have this next time that I visit Buttermilk Channel.Had a wonderful time at Buttermilk Channel. Great food, atmosphere, and service.

4.0,3/19/2012,"This is one of my fav Brooklyn places, with an updated Southern American cuisine. Returned on an early Thurs evening after not wanting to wait over an hour on Sunday nite.   I got the Thursday special -  Berkshire Pork - a tender shank of pork with mussels and clams in a spicy tomato broth. It was devine - the pork was extremely tender, while the pork skin was crispy. Interesting combo - shellfish and pork - but it works!  The cauliflower soup was a decadent cream based affair that was heavenly, as were the squash tarts.  The only miss was I ordered the brussel sprouts as a side and never got them.  The waitress apologized profusely, but wish I had tried them.

5.0,3/17/2012,"Wow I think I have found one of my favorite brunch places in BK. Everything was delicious. A bit on the pricier side but frickin' amazing. Unfortunately, I am still off meat for Lent so I didn't get to indulge in the porkchops and cheddar pancakes, but I shall return...Eats:Pecan French toast with fresh whipped cream: Impossibly thick challah bread french toast covered in pecans, maple syrup and pure sweetnessHash browns:If your meal doesn't come with these, definitely get a side order. These hashbrowns are perfection. They are perfectly fried hockey pucks... crunchy inside, soft chivey inside. Watch out you might get burned by the hot oil. Wait a minute, take a deep breath, then sink your teeth into it.The Huntington: AKA Eggs Benedict. I had them replace the ham with lox since I'm off the meat but it was still yummy. Nicely poached eggs with a good homemade Hollandaise.Cheddar waffles: Just cuz I couldn't get the porkchops, doesn't mean I couldn't get cheddar waffles. Order these as a side if no one at your table gets the full order. They are nice and crunchy and you can really taste the sharp cheddar.Drinks:The classic bloody Mary: Whoa, but 9 bucks whoa? TBD. It was immensely  spiced and seasoned. Capers really added to the full, complex flavor of this tasty bloody.Come here early! We got here around 11:30 and there was a 10 minute wait.

The waffles, the scrambles, the salmon platter! I had a really tough time choosing.Cute and charming. The decor inside Buttermilk is adorable. Exposed brick walls, trey ceilings... It definitely had a very country, quaint feel to it.Great Sunday brunch music. They played The Beatles for our entire meal!With every entree you purchase, you get your choice of drink.. (Bellini, mimosa, OJ, apple juice, tea..)My group and I ordered a plate of pancakes for our table. They were sprinkled with powered sugar on top and stacked five high. They were delicious and fluffy..!Friendly staff and super nice hostess. She kept my Cons: Longest wait in the history of mankind. It is crowded here! And popular! And we waited 50 minutes to be seated.I ended up ordering the scramble with salmon and cream cheese. I should've stuck with my gut and gotten the sausage and pepper one but I wanted to be fancy and ended up with weird watery / creamy eggs. My dish came with toast, a side salad and one hash brown. I was really disappointed with my scramble! It just wasn't good. My sister ordered the salmon platter which was your run of the mill lox and cream cheese.For my drink, I ordered an apple juice. They gave me a glass about 3 inches tall - it took me all of 3 sips to finish it. I guess only children usually order the apple juice but really? Bottom line: Buttermilk Channel served up standard fare with nothing to really write home about. Just because this place has such consistent, rave reviews - I'll probably come back to try another dish.",1,0,0,Stephanie F.,"Brooklyn, NY",501,455,8
4.0,3/13/2012,"DH and I ate here last night, and were seated immediately.  Phew!  Usually, long lines swarming in front, especially for weekend brunch, but I guess early Monday night's the time to go.  We had the $25 three-course meal.  Fried chicken was amazing, as everyone has already stated. I'm from Maryland and we do a pretty mean fried bird.  The light crispiness of the crust, combined with the finger-licking juices was very memorable.  A little under-done, but I'm not dead (or sick) yet.  The balsamic-reduction (?) sauce could have more more tart, rather than sweet.  It was almost cloying.  Remarkable also was the fried trout with creamy grits an some sort of roasted vegetables underneath. Salad and soup were good, not great, although I really loved the crunchy croutons. Dessert was delish - two parfait-like creations, not sure what exactly, but they involved a whole lotta cream.  We were kind of too stuffed to appreciate them fully.  Oh, and definitely be bad and get the bacon almonds.",1,0,0,Alice C.,"Los Angeles, CA",236,234,0

2.0,3/12/2012,"As vegetarians, Bf and I don't usually go to these types of new-American/comfort/southern restaurants because we find them to be expensive, over-hyped, and not very vegetarian-friendly anyway since there's been such a huge resurgence of bacon and duck in the past few years.But, we were invited to a birthday dinner here, and I was so excited upon reading that they offer a separate vegetarian menu.I know this place is way popular, so I was surprised that my friend was able to get a reservation for a large party of 8. So of course I was not surprised that we ended up having to wait for over 45 minutes to be seated. They were very apologetic about it though, and offered us some dishes of their maple and bacon almonds and hush puppies during our wait, and I did appreciate that.Here's my review on the (vegetarian) items we had throughout the night:Hush puppies: Ok, came with this spicy/creamy dipping sauce that was nice.House-made pickles: Ok I guess? I didn't love them but I'm generally not a big fan of pickles anyway.Popovers: Dry, burnt, underwhelming.Fries: Good, crispy. It's pretty bad if you mess up fries.Cauliflower/apple soup: Delicious. Thick, warm, a little sweet. A little cup of comfort with some crispy croutons on top.Fresh-pulled mozzarella appetizer: Cheese tasted very fresh but kind of bland. Nothing else memorable on the plate: couple pieces of bread, balsamic vinegar.Linguini: Vegetarians beware: we suspected that it might have been cooked with chicken stock. It tasted like chicken, and it there was a telling film of animal-like oil in the dish. Pretty mediocre overall, and I just picked at all the mushrooms in the dish since I just like mushrooms.Cheddar waffles: Ugh, nothing good on this plate. Waffles were dry and burnt. Brussels sprouts were overwhelmingly salty. Coleslaw was just coleslaw. I again picked at all the mushrooms from the plate because I like mushrooms, even if overcooked.Pecan pie sundae: It was just sweet stuff piled into a milkshake glass, had no depth.

The bar area was packed when we entered so we had to a) put our names on the list for a table and then b) wait for a seat by the bar. In the time that it took for the bartender to whip up our first round of drinks, the hostess found a seat for us at the bar. Super attentive staff!We had a 45min wait for a table which, while annoying, was made bearable by the delicious cocktails and warm atmosphere. The hostess periodically checked on us and updated us to our status/ waiting time which we really appreciated. Once seated we ordered a few selections from their raw bar, their homemade pickles and the fried chicken and lamb salad as entrees. The fried chicken and homemade pickles were both delicious.

5.0,2/26/2012,"I rarely write reviews but after an especially great experience last night (I've probably been 5-6 times in total) I've decided to share. This is everything you want a neighborhood restaurant to be. If you have a bad experience here, you probably ordered poorly or your taste buds do not function properly. Instead of raving about the fried chicken or bitching about the long waits, I will instead provide you with useful information.1) Sit at the bar if you are 2 people. It blows my mind that people will wait two hours for a table for 2 when bar waits are frequently less than 30 minutes. There is plenty of space, the bartenders are friendly and informative, and it's actually much easier to converse with your dining companion. 2) The house cocktails are very good and the beer selection is perfectly adequate.  The wine list is good, but there isn't a ton under $40.  It is what it is.    3) If you're an oyster fan, have some oysters. I'm not a connoisseur, but I've taken some raw bar fans here and they all rave. 4) GET THE DAILY SPECIAL. They're specials for a reason. Notably, the Saturday ribeye is outrageous.  Seriously.  Outrageous.5) If you don't get the special, the duck meatloaf and the warm lamb salad (which sounds weird, especially as an entree) are both awesome. You are not obligated to order the fried chicken.  It's good, but it's not the star.  I said it.6) Yes the brunch (and bloody mary) is good, but dinner is far more enjoyable. Honestly, a restaurant that does brunch better than dinner is either 1) a diner, or 2) doing something wrong. That is an entirely separate rant from which I will spare you.7) Vegetarians: rejoice!  In addition to having a few selections on the normal-person menu (the mustardy brussel sprouts are a nice side, by the way), there is a separate menu just for you.",1,0,0,Brad C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,11,0

5.0,2/21/2012,"""Oh God,"" said my fiancé as the sauvingnon blanc he had just knocked over spread across my lap in a chilly puddle of shame. ""What if this had been our first date?""But it wasn't our first date. It was our gazillionth date. He could have knocked over ten glasses of wine. He could have set his sleeve on fire. He could have friggin' climbed up on the table like King Kong and start swatting tiny airplanes out of the sky; it wasn't going to distract me from trying to remember whether or not I had unplugged my hair iron before we left home. That's monogamy, everybody. Of course, the amazing Buttermilk Channel staff does not share my general listlessness and they snapped into action the second that wine hit my lap. I looked up to ask someone for a towel, but towels were already there. That wine was mopped up, cleaned up, and replaced in five seconds flat. I felt like Cinderella in that scene where the birds help her get dressed, if Cinderella had been covered with wine and wearing a pink sports bra under her dress.Those little details matter, you know? When that wine spilled, the staff handled it. When I couldn't decide between two appetizers, our waitress gracefully pointed out which one would pair better with our entree. And although I didn't visit the kitchen, it was clear from the food they kept sending out that they had paid some damn good attention to the details back there too. It was a Sunday, so we decided to order the special of the night: roasted chicken with kale and bread stuffing, a poached egg, and sage jus. We also ordered a little cup of their homemade pickles (because I am currently going through a pickle phase), a Westlake Cocktail (because I'm also going through a bourbon phase), and a squash tart with ricotta cheese and brown butter (because brown butter isn't so much a ""phase"" as it is a ""lifestyle"").I started with my cocktail, which had bourbon, elderflower liqueur, orange bitters, and a gloriously fragrant little slice of orange zest. I loved it, although it made me feel old to realize that five years ago I would have preferred to drink whiskey and sprite with maraschino cherries from a sugar-rimmed plastic cup. Sigh. Anyway.All of the food was so consistently delicious that I would be hard pressed to pick a favorite. I would order everything again in a heartbeat. For dessert, we shared the much-lauded pecan pie sundae and the coconut pot de creme. I don't usually like pecan pie, but that sundae was amazing and easily outshone the more mild-flavored pot de creme. Our entire meal, including one cocktail, one beer, one ill-fated glass of wine (which was replaced for free), a cappuccino, and a much-deserved 20 percent tip for the waitress, totaled only at about $100, which struck me as exceptionally good value.  I'll sum it up like this. Among the things my fiancé doesn't really like are: 1. spending $100 on a meal, 2. going to Brooklyn (I know, he's a heathen), and 3. knocking over drinks in public places. And yet, as we left, he casually said, ""I'd come back here.""That's a huge endorsement, folks.",11,13,6,J K.,"New York, NY",225,161,134

Terrible.2. The overall meal was meh.  Meh, I tell you.  No other words. Just three letters that reflect a sound to summarize our lame disappointment. The long, belabored critique of our visit on what we ate:- House-made pickles served as round slices and thick spears.  Fine.- Fresh mozzarella balls skewered with crusty, oiled bread, laced with tiny anchovies and broiled until golden. Alright. (Good, not great.)- Pureed cauliflower soup was promising, smooth and creamy with crushed pistachioed crunch.  Good.- Green apple and arugula salad, with all two thin slivers of green apples and seemingly novel but absolutely ordinary blue cheese sandwich accompaniment.  Average.- Popovers. Fine.  Would have been better if they served it to us early in our meal instead of wedged awkwardly after our first course because they forgot to bring them earlier.- Ham wrapped trout, served on a thick bed of grits and roasted radishes.  Decent. While the gf loved the flavor of the grits, I couldn't get over its unbecoming, thick and chunky texture. The trout was definitely fishy - the good fishy that true fish lovers enjoy but on-the-fence-loving-fish-people would not particularly appreciate, and we enjoyed the salty balance added by the ham because lord knows how the chicken needed some of that balance...- Fried chicken and cheddar waffles.  Ridiculously disappointing.  I mean, if you want your chicken to be coated in thick cardboard-textured batter, the decently moist flesh bland beyond belief, then you will not be disappointed.  For others who enjoy actual flavor, you are best to skip this one, unless you have a habit of carrying an emergency package of soy sauce or salt in your pocket.  Seriously.  Don't do it.  The waffles absolutely stink too.  They were served as hard as hockey pucks and tasted like Cheez Nips (I mean, I like Cheez Nips, but I like bouncy, light waffles too).- Chocolate chip bread pudding with salted chocolate butterscotch.  Skip. Move on. Dense. Overly salty (smother it on the fried chicken?).  Sad.  Yuck.  Go on already.- Mini-pecan pie sundae.  Awesome.  Spectacular.  Layers of huge, softly-caramelized pecans, velvety vanilla ice cream and lovely whipped cream in a cup.  Simple. Savory. Sweet. Great.  The meal's only saving grace.For us, the best part of the meal was saved for last.  However, you should just go on and skip the whole charade of the meal though, and head straight for the sweet, pecan pie sundae goods.",2,3,3,Han C.,"New York, NY",147,397,80

5.0,2/9/2012,"I am quite choosy when I hand out 5 stars for a restaurant. It's as though I'm giving a student an A+, which is just as rare. Buttermilk Channel calls their cuisine ""New American"" I call it, well done Southern food (it seems influenced most by Southern cuisine) And as readers of my past reviews know, I am hyper critical of any NYC restaurant dolling out ""Southern Food"". Buttermilk Channel somehow does it right though. The night I came they were serving a Duck Meatloaf with cheese grits, not exactly Southern, but the influence is certainly evident. It was superb, and I can't stand meatloaf. It was one of those singular meals for sure. Ah, I'm already getting ahead of myself..........when we were seated, which sadly took forever (the one and only drawback of the place), the server brought over these amazing brioche poppers covered in honey and crushed sea salt. Incredible. We all ordered salads as first course- all were phenomenal. As I mentioned, the entree was superb- I even cleaned my plate with another brioche the server brought me. The desserts were all equally incredible. I had a bread pudding that was among the best I've ever had (and I cook an amazing bread pudding). My friends ordered apple pie and a chocolate dessert- both just as good as the bread pudding. If I could afford to eat here more often and the wait not so terribly long I would eat here weekly if not more.

3.0,1/26/2012,"Had a relatively lovely dinner here--service was a bit slow and we spent waaay too much money on watered down cocktails, but the food was solid. The maple bacon almonds were delicious, as was the simple apple-arugula salad. I wasn't starving so I ordered the squash tart for my main course, along with a side of bacon from the charcuterie. The mustard grill on the bacon was delicious, but the cut was a little fattier/thicker than I generally like. Sometimes I think the word ""bacon"" is thrown around too liberally. But I digress. The squash tart was good, but the ricotta lacked that heavenly flavor that you sometimes come across. Not the end of the world. My friend enjoyed her mussels. I think it was just a case of not ordering entirely correctly. Either way, I'd definitely go back--for brunch, for fried chicken, etc.",0,0,0,Alex H.,"New York, NY",15,99,0

The cheddar waffles they are served with are pretty awesome, though. You should get the duck meatloaf instead - really rich and delicious. Everything is good at brunchtime, too.

4.0,1/22/2012,"First off, I went here on a Friday night around 7:30 and I had called ahead to see if they take reservations. Unfortunately, they do not, only for parties for 5 or more. I was placed on the waiting list for both the table and bar, so whichever was quicker, I was sure to get my grub on. I took my boyfriend here to celebrate his belated birthday. We waited around 45 minutes to sit at the bar. I ordered red wine while my boyfriend ordered the Kelso beer (which has a great crisp taste, as recommended by the bartender). We then ordered the raw oysters and the barbequed oysters with smoked bacon as the appetizers. We love raw oysters, so this was definitely a plus for us. The barbequed oysters were great as well. Both of these appetizers were presented beautifully. For the main entree, we ordered the Maine lobster (which was the special on Fridays) as well as the trout. One of the lobster sides, which was hard to see because of the lighting, was raw. And so, I told the manager in which he insisted we stay for dessert. I wasn't being a pest, but just to let him know that the lobster was raw. The Maine lobster was overall delicious and full of flavor and it came with some kind of pasta noodles as well. The trout was delicious as well, sauteed to perfection. We then ordered dessert--the Pecan Pie sundae, which was real great. As we got the bill, the Sundae and a cup of beer was waived due to the raw Maine lobster. This place is great if you want to take your significant other, or a friend. But the wait is long and it is far from the train station (especially if it is cold out). The food here is unique and delicious. Highly recommend this!",1,0,0,Rita L.,"Manhattan, NY",72,279,759

My date and I pretty much ordered one of each of the items on the menu skipping the pasta, because we eat that at home, naturally. The salad was exactly what I expected from apples and blue cheese, good. The pumpkin soup was multidimensional and flavorful. We had the fish and the fried chicken next. The chicken was disappointing, not as crispy or as flavorful as I would have liked it. The fish with the mustard sauce was good, but I may have ordered something different if given the chance. The pecan pie and the chocolate bread pudding were pretty good for dessert. Overall, with all the hype this place gets, I wouldn't say it lived up to it.

Because you want this meal to last as long as possible and who doesn't want fried chicken for breakfast?Maple & bacon roasted almonds, house-made pickles, maple-glazed grilled bacon, cheese plates with pickled grapes(I have no idea what that tastes like)...

After waiting an hour, I have the say the food was ok to good but not the best I've had. I ordered the pork chop with cheddar waffle and my husband ordered the ABC grilled cheese and a side of sticky bun. I couldn't taste the cheddar in my waffle but my pork chop was good. It was a bit fatty, but I think the fat helps flavor it. The grill cheese was good but the sticky bun tasted a little stale. Both our dish came with a side of salad which was way too sour. It wasn't drowned in dressing so I'm just going to assume the dressing itself was very sour to begin with.The reason why I didn't rate this higher was because of the long wait time and the food really wasn't worth that wait.

The first time, we cam here for brunch, and we were seated immediately at the bar. The bartender served us, and he was very nice. The brunch, I admit was delicious, and exceeded my expectations. I had the eggs florentine sandwich. Normally, I'm weirded out by soggy spinach, but this was perfect. It was seasoned nicely and had delicious sauce, and fantastic flavor. We really wanted to come back and try dinner though. One night, my husband, daughter and I decided to see if we could get a table (there's always a 45 minute wait). We were able to score a small table outside within a few minutes. We were excited about this. Our server (the stereotypical hipster), started out nice. He seemed attentive for the first few minutes. He initially check to see if we were ready to order, and when we said we needed more time, he didn't come back for at least 10 minutes. I ordered what sounded like a decent pasta dish, my daughter got a kids dish, and my husband decided to try their famous fried chicken and cheddar waffle dish. I was really looking forward to this. Our food took almost 40 minutes to arrive, and in that time, our waiter decided not to show his face. He kept checking on the table next to us, but wouldn't check on us at all. We kept waiting for him to look our way, but he never did. When our food finally came, it was just not good at all. My pasta sucked. It wasn't flavorful at all. I was so disappointed. My husband asked if I wanted to taste the chicken, and it too was just not good. We both agreed that not only have we had better, but that this shouldn't even be in a restaurant. I've honestly made better fried chicken. When our waiter checked on the other table again, we had to call him to get his attention. I didn't want to have to do that.  After the long waits, my daughter just wanted to make sure she got her dessert that was included with her dinner. When the waiter came, he just started writing the check, even though we hadn't asked for it, and he was about to stiff my daughter out of her dessert. What did she do?? So I explained that her meal came with dessert. I know it had options but he insisted it only offered vanilla or chocolate ice cream. She ate her dessert, and we ran out of there so fast. We will likely never return.There's something wrong with these places that are getting cocky lately. Especially in this economy. This is not the first restaurant we've been to where our server has copped an attitude. We're always smiley, and friendly with our servers, and we're very good tippers so long as the service is good. I'm getting really tired of dealing with attitudes on servers.",4,1,1,R A.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,39,0

The prices are very reasonable, especially since a drink is included with your entree. My boyfriend and I ordered the pecan pie french toast, butternut squash soup, and short rib hash. We were hoping ordering three entrees would get us an extra drink, as it did for the people next to us, but the butternut squash soup definitely was a dainty appetizer size.French toast was the highlight of our brunch. I loved that the molasses sauce was on the side: the toast itself is quite sweet and decadent, so it was nice to pair the two at your own discretion.

Negatives:  I don't know if it was the day or what, but the pixie-haired hostess was equally as surly as our server.  Another negative: We were seated smack-dab in the middle of the extremely narrow restaurant so our elbows were constant targets.  Yet another negative: One bathroom. Positives:  The biscuits are pretty awesome.  Free drink with entree.  All of my positives basically reflect the kitchen.  I have no complaints in that respect.  In closing, I know serving can be a pain.  But I also had a lot of fun.  When a server assumes the worst from the get-go, it's a terrible sign.",0,0,0,Todd A.,"Los Angeles, CA",140,49,1

When we walked through the door the hostess just stood there with a look of contempt on her face as she eyeballed all of us coming in from the rain. After a long awkward pause I had to ask her for a table for four. As she scowled and grabbed her menus, I was wondering who would ever hire this women to greet and sit people at their restaurant, she was downright scary, think Cruella De Ville.  I also had a stroller which she looked at as if she had never seen one before in her life.  I easily closed it up and put it to the side as she watched with a giant puss on.   I did do my research on this restaurant and looked at the childrens menu that they display on their website so I figured Childrens menu=children are welcome. There were other children in the restaurant and all were extremely well behaved.  My kids are also little foodies and have been to many a 4 and 5 star restaurant. I liked the food, I ordered the duck meatloaf and my husband ordered the fried chicken, my children after serious deliberations and suggestions from the waitress (who seemed put out by their questions) ordered from the childrens menu. The food was quite delicious and all of us tasted everything on the table and were very pleased wih our selections. I am not a drinker but since it was our wedding anniversary I decided to splurge and go for a fancy cocktail. I had two of them and I am pretty sure they didn't contain any alcohol at all and at 11 bucks a pop that is just wrong. There is one bathroom. We actually had words with an impatient women who was banging on the door after my daughter and I were in there for 1 minute. The atmosphere was very awkward and uncomfortable. I am very soured on the experience.  The food was good, the drinks were awful and super expensive.  The service sucked.  I would not return to this restaurant with or without my children.  I really wanted to love it, my son goes to school across the street and I thought this might be a great place to hit when I don't feel like cooking.",0,0,0,Theresa F.,"Brooklyn, NY",68,5,0

The waffle was pretty good as was the pork but there was a pork to waffle ratio problem - too much pork and not enough waffle. On second thought, I guess that would only be a problem for some people. The sweet maple syrup on top of the pork and waffle is all the sauce you will need for the chop and it works very well. I still would have liked more waffle.The french toast was sweet, thick and soft and rivals the french toast of Jane as some of the best in NYC. Not much else to say about that.

I think this is why the chicken is moist but the flavor is overpowering.  The cheddar waffle was awesome though.  And I loved our bread pudding desserts but he thought they were also too salty.... they're big fans of salt there!Honestly, the food wasn't BAD - I would have been ecstatic if it had been half the price, but we walked out of there feeling raped which is never a good thing.  I'm glad we tried it, but we won't be going back. $18 for a few pieces of mediocre fried chicken is what they're known for?  no thanks.",0,0,0,Rachelle R.,"New York, NY",57,335,39

4.0,8/21/2011,"Kelly Kapowski sighting!  Yes, I saw Tiffani Amber Thiessen dining here with her family. I didn't get all weird about, nor was it the highlight of my life, but hey...I won't lie, it does add a little something special to the brunch experience at Buttermilk Channel. I mean really, how many Cheerio childhood breakfasts did I enjoy while watching Kelly conquer Bayside High? Many! So, it was nice to have her around for this one, too. Regardless, I finally made it to Buttermilk Channel after several foiled attempts. We rolled up about 12:45 on a Saturday, were faced with a 30 minute wait, crowded around the bar (not a lot of inside waiting room, fwiw) and took in former-TV-cheerleader speckled crowd. At precisely 30 minutes our group of 4 was ushered back, squarely situated with ample coffee, mimosas (one complimentary with brunch!), bloody marys. Orders were placed for short rib hash, porkchop waffles, pepper and sausage scramble, and other delicacies. OH! And a jelly douhgnut amuse bouche that sent our blood sugar and attitudes soaring. The food was on point. I won't rave on and on about it, but certainly it was not disappointing. My short rib hash was a bit average, but the pork chop and waffles were killer. Service = excellent. Crowd = large. Weekends = crazy.

5.0,8/20/2011,"My friend and I decided to dine at the bar rather than wait for a table. This was a great decision, the bartender was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. I came here without a huge appetite and planned to order a salad, after taking a look at the menu, this pipe-dream went out the window.We nibbled on some 'bacon-maple almonds' while we waited for our food. They were slightly sweet with big cubes of house-cured bacon. Mmmm. I wish all bars were equipped with bar-nuts of this caliber.I had the ham-wrapped brook trout. Crispy ham and trout-skin on the outside and fresh flaky fish within. It was served with creamy grits, some wilted greens, and some type of sweet tomato chutney. I took care to compose each bite for maximum flavor. The portion was perfect, generous but I was able to enjoy every bite.My friend ordered the duck meatloaf, which was UNREAL! All meatloaf should be made out of mallards.Despite our best intentions, we split the pecan sundae for dessert. This thing was HUGE and looked like an ice cream truck and a pecan pie collided.

If you walk in and are surrounded by a million people trying to look in-the-know waiting for a table, then walk south and have a burger at Dubuque.Strolled in for brunch one day and was happy to sit right away.

They work well together and the sauce is delightful. The most amazing thing is that the chicken will still be crispy the next day. It is rare to find a place where even your leftovers are delicious. AS for brunch, the pecan pie french toast has the tendency to be a bit dense but the pecans provide a wonderful balance. However, the eggs huntington are a sight and taste to behold. Going way beyond the ordinary benedict, the flavor is rich but not overwhelming, filling due to the hearty biscuit used. As for their wait time, I have figured a small way around it.

I ordered the steak because we all wanted to order different things. The daily special was the lobstah from RHLP, and it was delicious from the bit that I tried. The steak was a little tough at medium, and a little bland - nothing spectacular. LUCKILY FOR ME, my friend who ordered the chicken wasn't too hungry and found it impossible too finish her dish - SCORE. The chicken was good. It was juicy, and the batter was very crispy but not the type that would leave your palette feeling raw. And cheddar waffles? Great.

With any entree order, you get your choice of Bellini, OJ, or mimosa. Everything looked great, seriously. We settled for the scrambled eggs with hot sausage and onions (since it came with a bunch of sides) and shared the pecan bun. The scrambled egg set up was innovative- the eggs were served in a saucer-like cup on a plate that was filled with sides of our extra biscuit, mini hash brown and mesclun salad. The bun was delightfully amazing, but our other carbs were just okay. Given that the place has ""buttermilk"" coined in its title, we were disappointed with the biscuits. Eggs were good but nothing special. We had no room to eat the toast. Of course, the decor is awesome. Place has lots of lighting and that intimate, charming feeling with many dining options, e.g., outside, at the bar, as a big group in the middle of the restaurant, etc. Service was great, too, once we got seated.

4.0,7/23/2011,"After having had an incredibly delightful brunch at Buttermilk Channel a few months back I decided to come back and tackle the dinner menu. My brunch experience was great overall and although my group and I waited over an hour to be seated. The host was incredibly apologetic and offered us the maple bacon roasted almonds, which were nothing short of incredible, to tide our roaring stomachs over. I ended up ordering the Eggs Huntington, which was tasty but not necessarily remarkable. I ordered a side of waffles to see what all the chatter was about and wow...totally lived up to the hype. Absolutely incredible. I gushed about it to our waitress and she suggested that next time I have the Eggs Huntington, I should ask for it served on a waffle instead of the biscuit. Um... fuck yes I will!Ok, so back to dinner... I went last night with a friend and we ordered the foie gras to start with. (I know some people are touchy about foie gras but let's face it, if you're not a vegetarian or vegan why start making double standards on what animal part is and isn't acceptable to eat?  Just enjoy being at the top of the food chain.) The foie gras was tasty as expected and  with a nice sized portion. I ordered the Chicken and Waffles and my friend the Duck Meatloaf. As much as I was looking forward to getting my hands on some waffles again they just weren't as I remembered them. The chicken was tender and the skin incredibly crispy but sadly not extraordinary.  I was really hoping it would beat the fried chicken at the Brooklyn Bowl but alas it didn't.   The sauce that it was served with the waffles and chicken was ill fitting. I couldn't quite place the taste of it but after having been to a handful of waffle houses I wasn't left very impressed. A delicious meal mind you but perhaps I just came in expecting too much. The star of the evening was the Duck Meatloaf. Dear lord, incredible! Why have I never had this before?  It was fantastic and if I could have traded plates without my friend noticing I would have.

4.0,7/11/2011,"Ah Buttermilk Channel. I've been meaning to visit you for SO long. Ever since I read the rave reviews in countless magazines and blogs and then found out that an old friend who I grew up going to summer camp with is the owner, I've been meaning to get there. It took me way too long to finally go and when the 3rd annual random friends brunch came around (a little party I throw every year where I post an open invite on my facebook wall and the first 10 to respond join me in the fun) I thought this was the perfect pick.When we arrived, we were immediately greeted by Doug's (the owner) awesome wife and drink orders were taken while they got our table ready. My spicy bloody mary, complete with a homemade pickle spear, hit the spot. I LOVE horseradish, and this drink was bold and flavorful with a serious kick to it. The pickle was a cute, creative touch, so much more interesting than the typical piece of celery.When we were seated, Doug was kind enough to send over some snacks to munch on while we drank, got acquainted, and looked over the menu. As you can see by my first picture, we were hungry. We chowed down on the treats way too quickly for me to remember to snap a picture. What you see there are the remnants of homemade pickles, walnut coffee cake and these incredible maple, bacon almonds that I seriously would have eaten all of if I wasn't supposed to share with the others. Deeeeelicious.The menu is a bit quirky, totally comfort-food oriented, and what I'd call down-home-creative. The big hit at the table were the pork chops over cheddar waffles, but everyone enjoyed their own meals as well. I shared the mushroom, spinach, goat cheese scramble and the pecan french toast. The scramble was awesome, especially the many different kinds of mushrooms, and I really enjoyed it. The salad and toast that came with it rounded out the meal nicely, but the little potato pancake was a bit on the greasy side for my taste. Very crunchy and hot though, and I'd imagine that people who didn't grow up in Jewish families who make outstanding potato latkes would probably have loved it. The pecan pie french toast has been talked about on almost every review I've read so I felt like we had to try it. It was VERY sweet, made with fresh, delicious, thick-cut bread and served with a scoop of fluffy whipped cream or marscapone, or maybe whipped ricotta (oops, I forgot to ask) and covered with bourbon, molasses pecans. This dish WAS delicious, but I would really put it into a dessert category instead of a main course. I happen to have a pretty serious sweet tooth, and this was even a little too much for me.The overall vibe of Buttermilk Channel couldn't be more perfect. Hip, without being at all pretentious. Trendy, but also very chill. Relaxed, comfortable, warm, and the kind of place that locals must adore meeting at every Sunday. It's a bit off the beaten path for me- over an hour to get there, but even so, I will probably be back. Many thanks to Doug for making this event super special, taking such good care of us, and welcoming us into his second home.",0,0,0,Carey Y.,"Sarasota, FL",407,338,3

Score!I am one of those people that has to eat within an hour of waking up, so brunch never appealed to me. I never understood the concept, but I was willing to experience it. Our wait was atrocious. I think we waited over 40 minutes, but it was worth the wait. A truly diverse crowd. A lot of people with tattoos and a lot of different races. I love Brooklyn, but you knew that already. I felt at home. Diversity breeds good genes. Apparently, this place is known for their Bloody Marys, so I tried the oyster Bloody Mary. Pretty damn good. Spiced right, and you could barely taste the alcohol. That is a plus for me. And I felt the effects later. I tried the Egg Huntington platter. Poached eggs, Canadian ham, biscuits, a bed of greens with Hollandaise on the side. Great dish. I like runny eggs and this dish fulfilled my desire for runny eggs. I now know that I don't like Hollandaise. In life, it is important to know what you don't like...A great brunch experience.

3.0,7/5/2011,"I'd like to think I just built this up too much. I want this to be my fault. I really do. I saw this place first on The Food Network, and like any good Yelper, I logged on and attempted to verify the claims. 390+ reviews and 4 stars...I'm in. This was the first stop in the ""NYC"" segment of our summer vacation. Previously we were in Atlanta, and we ate well. So, this being New York, and considering all of the research I've done, my expectations are rather high. Not to mention, my @$$ is on the line here. I'm the guy booking our reservations. In essence, I'm 'recommending' these restaurants. So if something turns out bad, or even mediocre, that's a reflection on my decision-making ability.So, first night out the gates in New York, and I come up short. Not cool. But let me clarify -- not everything here was mediocre. In fact, everything started off well. From the day I made the reservation, and when I called back last-minute to add a guest, and even the our initial greeting -- everyone was quite friendly. So, rather than craft a long-winded play-by-play, let me give a few bullet points of the things I liked and disliked.Pros:- Friendly host staff- Very kid friendly - even to the point that they served my 4-year old son his meal well ahead of ours without us having to request it.- The bread they served us initially: Amazing!- The flatbread and the bacon that started us off: Delish!(at this point in the meal ALL of our high expectations had been met)Cons:- The baked oysters: Ehhh. This was the first disappointment. I wanted to love them, but they were just okay.- The fried chicken and cheddar waffles: I mean seriously...THIS is why I came here. When someone reputable says that this is (one of) the BEST things they ever ate, I'm getting it. And I did. I took that first bite with great anticipation. The experience: underwhelming. Let me take another bite, I thought, to see if the flavors start to pop. Nope. Okay, another...nope. And then something completely unexpected happened -- the more I ate, the worse the dish got. I found the breading quite soaked in oil. The chicken was almost flavorless apart from the taste of the oil. The waffle: it was decent. Better than the chicken, but not nearly enough to elevate the overall quality of the dish. The coleslaw: a slightly better version of your grandma's coleslaw. The problem is, I hate your grandma's coleslaw. I won't eat it. This, on the other hand, was just good enough to eat.- The server: She wasn't overtly rude. In fact, at first, before my food experience began to sour, I completely ignored the little signs that told me she had a holier-than-thou attitude. Whatever it was I thought I had noticed, I was there to have a great experience, and I was going to ignore it. But as the meal went on, I couldn't ignore it. Frankly, she just wasn't very friendly toward us. Uggghhhh...I'm disappointed that I'm disappointed. I REALLY wanted to love this place. But I didn't. Hopefully tomorrow night will be better.",1,0,0,Eric J.,"Huntington Beach, CA",99,15,12
4.0,7/3/2011,"Brunch at Buttermilk Channel was as good as I was expecting.  We were quoted a forty minute wait but probably only waited about twenty minutes. I had heard that Buttermilk Channel made the best bloody marys in the borough, and I was very pleased with the classic, which was spicy and strong as promised (I've found that other places get away with skimping on the vodka, but that was definitely not the case here).I ordered the scramble with Esposito's Hot Sausage, peppers, and onions, which was fluffy and tasty and served with two slices of fresh toast, a golden brown, super tasty deep fried hash brown, and heaps of a lightly dressed mixed greens salad. We also split a side order of the cheddar waffle for the table, and it was truly an epiphanic culinary experience--perfectly browned, rich, with a good balance of savory and sweet.Minus one star because service was very slow, and it was quite difficult to get water refills.  There were also some pesky flies buzzing about the dining room, which interfered with my enjoyment of the meal and caused me to wonder if there were also some in the kitchen.

5.0,6/25/2011,"5 stars for brunch. Haven't been for any other meal, but I find myself trekking out from Astoria time and again for brunch here.I always order the same thing: Short stack of pancakes, side of hash browns, side of bacon. And I always leave here smiling. In fact, I can't stop beaming from the first moist, delicious bite of pancake that I take. I have no idea what they put in it (crack, maybe?), but DAMN are those pancakes good! And I'm not even a pancake person. The butter that comes on the side of the pancakes is also pretty life-altering. If it were socially acceptable, I would eat multiple ramekins of that butter. I would bathe in it if I could. It's got some vanilla twinge to it, oh man just thinking about it makes me want some right now! Anyway, the short stack is an excellent deal at only $6. The maple syrup is also super high quality tasting, but the pancakes are so good, you really don't even need it.The hash browns are a perfect counterbalance to the sweetness of the pancakes. You get two smallish discs of crispy salty goodness, which, while a small portion, is the perfect amount. The ketchup they provide is Heinz, which makes me happy. I think the hash browns are $5.The bacon...mmmm, bacon....it's thick, it's crispy, it's salty, it's chewy, it has an excellent taste. It's a pretty sizable portion (around 3 or 4 large slices), so I usually split it with a friend. I think the bacon is around $4 or $5 an order.When you order something from the brunch menu, you get a free alcoholic beverage. I ordered a bellini the first time I was here, and it tasted a bit off, so the waitress was nice and brought me the peach juice in a separate glass from the sparkling wine. The peach juice is SO good-I now order it like that every time I come just to savor the juice and wine separately. Speaking of service, all of the servers I've had here are nice and pretty laid-back. The hostess is very helpful, and wants everyone to enjoy their experience. We got here towards the tail end of brunch one day and she warned us they may not have a table by the time they stopped serving, but she ended up being able to seat us just as they were about to stop serving.Just as an aside, I've noticed that in order to finish my whole meal here, I need to have a snack beforehand, otherwise my stomach just can't handle all of that food that early in the day! So if you're stuck waiting for a table (don't worry, it usually goes quickly), have a small snack to warm up your tummy!",1,0,1,Jessica M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",241,180,17

My wife's father ordered the chicken and waffles which were fried to perfection... crispy, but not too much, and the waffle was delicious as well. Everything's good with syrup isn't it? The waiter, in addition to giving us great wine suggestions, overheard that we were going to the North Fork the next morning, took it upon himself to go behind the bar, ask a few people, and wrote on a napkin the best vineyards that we should visit.

Our waitress had a cooler-than-thou demeanor and ignored us for the entire meal. One water refill and that was when we got the check (which we had to get from the busboy). Seriously, when you charge $18-25 per entree, you should have good service. The food was bland. I got the chicken/waffles, which was too overcooked. Husband got a Portuguese style stew that seriously had no complex flavor and was room temperature. Go to Pies and Thighs if you want good chicken.

Unfortunately, I was horribly disappointed by the customer service this time around.  The hostess was terribly rude to my 66 yr old mother and to one of my best friends (a fellow New Yorker) when we first arrived and asked for a table.  Because our party wasn't there at the exact same time, we were treated like 3rd class citizens.  We sat at the bar looking at free and empty tables while we waited the 10 minutes for the remainder of our party to arrive.  And, when we were all there, the hostess told us it would be 30 minutes (this was at 6pm on a Sunday).  We got a few drinks and an appetizer at the bar as we waited.  When my friend went back to check 15 minutes later, the hostess was rude again.   So, we decided our patronage would be more appreciated at a different establishment: we went to Prime Meats 2 blocks up and had an excellent meal.  Too bad Buttermilk Channel - you had a devotee and now we will never return.  Be careful and choose your hostesses better.",0,0,0,Rachel C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0

4.0,5/28/2011,"This review is for brunch on Saturday.I was a bit worried about the wait after reading the reviews, but it turned out this place is nowhere near Clinton St Bakery's wait, where you have to get there before opening or else wait forever. There was a sale I wanted to check out at noon, so I didn't want a huge wait. I got there at 10:15. I would say that there was no wait (for small parties) until 11am. The restaurant is extremely well lit and decorated conservatively. We sat at the bar. I started with coffee and OJ. The OJ looked freshly squeezed, but it actually isn't. Sad face. The bloody marys looked popular and I would've gotten one, if I were in a diff state of mind. Service was attentive, but not obtrusive. I think our dishes came out fairly quick. There was no 'omg, I'm starving, where is our food' moments. On to the food:- Fried pork chop and cheddar waffles with maple syrup. This is the perfect dish for those who love sweet and savory. The pork chop was pretty lean and perfectly fried/seasoned. The cheddar waffles (two pieces) reminded me of cheez its, in a good way. The perfect bite consists of a piece of each, dunked in maple syrup. Portion size was large. - Short rib hash with over easy eggs and toast. Also, well executed. Not fatty at all. - Short stack of buttermilk pancakes. I guess it is difficult to go to a place with buttermilk in the name and not try their pancakes. The pancakes are served with butter and more maple syrup. It is on the richer side. Each bite reminds me of a nice shortbread cookie. This is a solid brunch place. Unless you have a particular hankering for one of their offerings (their menu is extensive, unique) or live close by, I would save it for special occasions.",1,0,0,Irene H.,"New York, NY",207,1190,366
4.0,5/26/2011,"Went in for an impromptu dinner and the quality continues.Really enjoyed the flatbread with ricotta and ramps, a nice crunchy sea salt bringing out the rampy-ness. {yep, that's a word.}The popovers were Maine-worthy and I didn't even mind having to deal with the sticky sauce all over my hands.The hake with endive, fennel and black grape salad was something I want to make over and over again in my own kitchen, it's so my style -- warm, fresh with that feeling of eating soup inside on a rainy spring day. Having just done a ton of cardio before dinner I was ravenous so I jumped at the chance to try Adelaide S.'s fried chicken, something I would never permit myself to order. I liked the breading, but there was something off about the chicken that I could not put my finger on... the cheese waffle was okay, tasting the cheddar more from the smell than the amount of cheese in it.For dessert the bread pudding was very good, a nice spongy almost Belgian gauffre-y texture to the cake and smothered in a creamy caramel with a spoonful of whipped cream.The dark and stormy had no lime juice in it and the ratio of rum:ginger beer was a little off, but once the ice melted a bit it took the edge off and was pretty good.

2.0,4/17/2011,"One of the more underwhelming restaurant experiences I've had in a while. The boyfriend made plans to go to the restaurant after a visit to the Brooklyn Botannical gardens to see the cherry blossoms. Because our visit to the gardens ended earlier than we anticipated, we decided to walk to the restaurant. Since he usually has excellent choice in restaurant, I assumed that it would be awesome, as usual. First impressions were promising-it's pretty much what you would expect a place with the word ""buttermilk"" to look like...very country-esque. Hungry from a half day of walking, we decided upon the Caputo's Handmade Mozzarella with Basil and Warm Anchovy Sauce, Slow-Roasted Pork Spare Ribs, Warm Lamb and Romaine Salad, and the Buttermilk Fried Chicken (a choice that was heavily influenced by all the raving reviews).The meal also started out with a bang-the mozzarella was delicious (and I don't think it was due to our hunger!), with just enough flavors to make it interesting, but not too much as to be overwhelming. The pork was excellent as well, and perfectly roasted with a sauce that had an unexpected (but well-received) kick at the end. The second course. Sorely disappointing:The lamb salad had its moments (e.g. the cauliflower), but the lamb was not extraordinary, and the boiled egg was way too salty (so much for Bloomberg's war on salt!). Halfway through the meal, I realized that I was continuing to eat merely because I felt like it'd be a waste of $16.  We ordered the chicken despite our initial concerns that it was too ordinary. And it was little more than ordinary. According to the boyfriend, the highlight of his meal was the cole slaw (eek). The fried chicken was good, but it was just fried chicken, and the waffle was good, but it was just a waffle (with syrup that was very fluid and ""pure""). His last piece of chicken was also a bit bloody. Worth $18? Probably not. Take home point: the food is fine, but probably not worth the $$$.

I love burgers... all burgers... I don't discriminate... and this burger was as bland as plain oatmeal. The Soup was ok, but still not good. I'm not going to crave it- ever. Even the white dipping sauce for the fries was gross. And the fries were too crunchy and dry. Honestly... it's like they let all their food sit on a Ronco food dehydrator before they served it.

4.0,3/23/2011,"Buttermilk Channel is a small, neighborhood gem of a place.  Classy yet homey, serving up comfort foods that are straightforward but well-prepared and beautifully presented.  Located on a quiet corner in south Carroll Gardens.  The small bar sits to the right of the entrance.  Decor is something like modern country: brick lined and off-white walls, pale wood tables, chairs, and flooring, colonial window panes, and a simple, elegant chandelier.  Service was competent and efficient.Mondays feature a prix fix 3-course menu, a very good deal at $25.  Their regular dinner menu is not extensive but has a little for everyone, and appealing selections.  Big, airy popovers instead of bread for the table; sadly I didn't get to try them (too busy eating everything else).  The maple and bacon roasted almonds were crunchy and flavorful, addictive and terrible, in that so-good-but-so-bad-for-you kind of way.  The very generously portioned chicken liver mousse came in a bowl, with crispy bread slices and sea salt; deliciously creamy.  The roasted pumpkin and sweet potato soup was lovely, sweet and savory.  Their well-known buttermilk fried chicken was a big portion for one person at half a chicken.  Arrived sitting on top of waffles with a side of slaw.  The skin was excellent, light, very crispy, nice flavor.  The chicken meat, both white and dark parts, was very tender and juicy.  I felt the meat lacked flavor, which was the only thing keeping me from raving about this fried chicken.  A fantastic balsamic maple syrup accompanied the dish and helped with the flavor but shouldn't have been necessary; it did go nicely with the light waffles.  Roasted mustardy brussel sprouts on the side were excellent.  For dessert, their pecan pie sundae was the highlight, with ice cream sandwiched between rich, pecan goodness, topped with fluffy whipped cream.  I am addicted to the pecan pie at Peter Luger's and this was just as good, only deconstructed.  The chocolate and caramel tart was also good, but honestly overshadowed by the pecan pie sundae, but my personal bias is probably playing in.Overall, I liked Buttermilk Channel a lot.  Solid, comfort food and just a nice place to dine in.  I probably won't have the fried chicken again but would love to try other items on their menu.",2,0,1,Valery C.,"Forest Hills, NY",56,837,9616

Like a ricotta or goat or something. And it was just.... yeah.My dining companion said the burger was probably one of the best burgers they had ever eaten. As for me, lots of chicken. 2 waffles. And I was spent.For dessert we ordered the chocolate caramel tart with salted peanuts. And it was salty.. But it was great because I was already full and didn't want to overdo it.Basically, this place.. is... so good. So what if everyone is doing new american cuisine? Not everyone is doing it well.  I just wish they would turn the lights up at night. I even suggested it to my waitress but she said the owner was pretty adamant about keeping the lights at a level which would require us all to get reading glasses in the near future.

After a brief discussion on whether or not the bartender was more ""lumberjack"" or ""seaman,"" we sat down at a cute two seater near the entrance. The menu was very much ""home cookin'"" and reminded me of the dishes you see at The General Greene. Lots of fried chicken and roasted, oily vegetables. One of the main reasons we chose Buttermilk, besides their reputation, is because they have a vegetarian menu with about 5 or 6 main veggie dishes. The waiter brought us two delightful and fluffy popovers as our bread. We ordered the hush puppies as a ""snack"" and the butternut squash tart as a first course to share."" The hush puppies were crispy and delicious. The tart had interesting flavors. It was sweeter than we expected but still great. My boyfriend ordered the fried chicken and waffles and I ordered the cheddar waffles with roast brussel sprouts and mushrooms as our entrees. My veggies were very roasted (meaning there is no doubt they were swimming in oil) and my waffles were fair. Considering everything else was so hot and crispy, I found them to be cold and limp. Great beer and wine list as well.  Our bill totaled around $100. Overall, this is not a health food place! Come hungry and be prepared to see lots of fried buttery dishes. Like other Yelpers, I think it may be overrated considering that my dining partner and I felt like the menu was very familiar.

The cubed and refried short rib was simply too much of fat, even for a bacon lover, it just was not an optimum breakfast choice.The toasted & prebuttered wholeweat bread was quite unpleasant surprise.

Aside from the complimentary orange juice, I also had the coffee. Me likey because it's nice and strong! He had the mushroom, spinach and goat cheese scramble. Just the right amount of goat cheese without making you say 'ewww'. The eggs were served in a small, deep bowl. There was also a side of mixed greens and toast. Ordered the cheddar waffles and this, I thought was very interesting. I loved how they incorporated the cheddar cheese into the batter without comprimising the fluffiness of the waffle.

Since I was trying to make my trip to New York as cheap as possible I figured this was my best bet. A somewhat upscale place with cheap dinner? I'm so there!Buttermilk Channel is a restaurant you go to with a small group of friends to laugh, dine, and drink for hours. It has a homey comforting feel as if this was a dining room in a modern home. The decorations are sparse and the lighting is low. I was attracted to the space but it was a nice summer night that I opted to sit outside.I was given the menu for the three course dinner. The main courses were the most varied consisting of three choices. You could choose from chicken and cheddar waffles, a pasta dish, or a fish fillet wrapped in bacon and mashed potatoes. I had seen every dish on another table with the exception of the pasta dish. The chicken and waffles looked delectable and the bacon wrapped fillet with potatoes made my mouth water. I choose the pasta dish. The first item set in front of me was a sweet biscuit covered in honey. A departure from the rest of the menu I thought. It was tasty but I found it unusual for a sweet item to be first. Next came a corn chowder which would have been fabulous if it wasn't lukewarm in temperature. Next came my pasta which was missing a key ingredient: flavor. The pasta was mixed with greens, mushrooms, and corn kennels but it the flavors didn't mend together so it felt was if I was consuming a bowl of plain pasta. I doused the dish with Tabasco sauce and pepper and with that it started to taste a bit better. A bit deflated that my previous entrees weren't as I had expected, I was nervous about dessert. To my delight dessert was exquisite! I choose the pecan pie sundae and it was layers of pecans, ice cream, and whipped cream. Lovely, addicting, and a burst of sunshine on a cloudy uninspiring dinner.

In the end, the short rib hash won out and of course, I had to order the cheddar waffle. Let me say first that I am a fan of any cut of beef that has been cooked for hours. That is exactly what you have to do with short ribs in order to melt all the fat and end up with meltingly tender beef. This is what hash should be. I'm use to hash being mostly potatoes and a little main event. This hash was definitely mostly main event with the potatoes going along for the ride. The short rib meat was so tender and it looked like that some of the vegetables that were cooked with it were included in the hash. I have to admit that I'm not much of a fan of waffles However, I think I may have found the waffle that has changed my mind. The combination of the sweet maple syrup with the salty tang of the cheddar was a party in my mouth. I love it when sweet and salty come together in perfect marriage. I am actually drooling right now thinking of that waffle. You can count on it that I will be back when the fried chicken is on the menu.",2,0,0,Phi N.,"Brooklyn, NY",100,81,234
5.0,10/11/2010,"What an amazing experience we had last night at Buttermilk Channel! The service was excellent, the ambience was just right, and the food was delicious. The house-made bread & butter pickles were addictive - I'm not usually a fan, but could have eaten a bowl myself. Not too sweet, the perfect mix of flavors. We shared three insane entrees. The warm lamb & romaine salad was absolutely perfect - salty, crunchy, creamy and meaty. It was definitely a dinner sized portion with lots of moist pulled leg of lamb over romaine and frisee. Certainly enough for one person if you're not into sharing. The duck meatloaf was nuts! From the giant onion ring on top to the jus at the bottom, this  made me close my eyes to appreciate the perfection. Because we were sharing, the rich, creamy flavors never overwhelmed, but I might not get this on my own. Then, of course, we had to sample the buttermilk fried chicken. Three large pieces of super juicy chicken perched on a not-too-large waffle. The syrup was not too sweet or mapley, which was perfect for dinner. Cole slaw went super light on the mayo and was a nice crunchy compliment to the other flavors and textures. I can see why this is a crowd favorite - it didn't disappoint. The chicken even held up as a 1:00 am snack - still crunchy!  It was hard to pick a favorite among these 3 gems, and I would recommend all three. For dessert we tried the pecan ice cream sundae and the chocolate & caramel tart. Both tasty but they didn't blow our minds. But the coffee was very good, hot, and strong, which is a big plus for me. (There's nothing worse than ending a meal with a weak cup of coffee...ugh) Thanks for a wonderful evening, Buttermilk Channel!

5.0,10/5/2010,"I've been here over a dozen times now and I live in Queens. Yes, it's a trek but it's worth it. I'll start with appetizers. The ricotta flat bread is divine. It's savory and rich but still delicate. The pickles are TASTY TASTY goodness if you're all for super sour, crunchy, salty pickles. The hush puppies, which we got for free (waiter mistake), were delicious but overshadowed by the pickles and flat bread. The bacon strips are also delicious. Topped with a sweet glaze and a side of sharp greens. They have some good beer choices and some nice wines as well.The star of this restaurant is the chicken and waffles. The chicken is always juicy and perfectly seasoned with skin that has the perfect crunch. The cheddar waffles are warm, crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, with a surprise savory flavor from the cheddar. All of this topped with the sweet, tangy balsamic syrup... I DIE. Its really just a flavor adventure with multiple layers of flavors all combined into one orgasmic orgy. The pecan pie sundae is delicious if you're a nut lover although it's overwhelming size requires about 4 people to finish it, especially after all that fried chicken and waffle.

4.0,9/7/2010,"Despite being New York City born and bred, I sometimes feel like I have the stomach of a down-home-cookin' Southerner and Buttermilk Channel definitely fulfilled my comfort food craving.After a 7.5 hour, traffic filled drive from DC (where I currently live), my sister, her fiance and I headed straight to Buttermilk Channel--15 minutes late for our reservation to meet friends.  I cannot tell you how many times I said in the long car ride back home ""FRIED CHICKEN, I'M COMING FOR YOU"" and fried chicken is what I got.  And hush puppies. And cheddar waffles. And cole slaw. But more on the main course in a bit.After drooling over the menu all day at work, I decided to start with a Greenpoint beer and hush puppies.  The hush puppies were little bundles of warm, moist, tasty goodness.  They were perfect balance of sweetness and saltiness.  The green chili aioli was scrape-the-bottom-with-your-last-bite good.  It was a spicy yet cooling accompaniment  to the hush puppies.  I also got a bite of someone's homemade mozzarella with warm anchovy sauce -- it was good, but could have used a touch more anchovy and touch less balsamic reduction (but I'm biased because I much prefer savory to sweet).Now onto the main course.  Like I said, I have somewhat of a savory tooth (and a non-existent sweet tooth) so I ditched the syrup that came on the side and dove right into the fried chicken.  Crispy, juicy fried chicken deliciousness.  The portion was big -- a drumstick, thigh and huge wing/hunk of chicken.  Paired with the cheddar waffle and a little bit of cole slaw (which was not at all mayo-y, crunch and a had a little kick of red onion) I found myself devouring the whole dish.  Total reward for the long car ride.  I even managed to squeeze in a bite of my sister's duck meatloaf.  HOLY MEATLOAF. Most succulent meatloaf I have ever tasted. (Sorry, mom.  I still love yours too).  That dish is definitely a must eat for my next visit.All in all, a lovely dining experience and I definitely plan on returning (maybe not on a Friday night but definitely with a reservation - highly recommended) because there's plenty of duck meatloaf and fried chicken to be eatin'.",3,3,4,Kourtney W.,"Washington, DC",4,5,0

2.0,9/6/2010,"Just tried it last night, heard great things, completely underwhelmed. The food is a kind of Americana or 'down-home' style cooking; locally sourced, organic, farmers market, yada ya ya. The wine list is actually very interesting, all American wines, some interesting choices. Only two reds and two white under 40 dollars (and just barely), most ranging around 45+. Shame.I knew we were in trouble though when I ordered a 2005 Barbera, Uvaggio from Lodi, Ca and they brought out a 2008 Barbera from Santa Barbera and didn't mention anything about a substitution. I don't remember being presented the bottle before the taste (I am not saying it didn't happen), but after the waitress poured our first glass I noticed the mistake and sought to inquire. The waitress hadn't even noticed and she did not know what was going on, she swore up and down that it was the only Barbera they had. The manager came over and told us the list was out of date. 'Sorry', but he had 'just tasted it last night' and swore to us 'it was excellent'. Thanks for trying to convince me that the wine I did not order was up to par. The wine was fine, but come now, a big difference between 2005 and 2008 and two completely different vineyards.The menu was a standard new American bistro. Split into apps, first and mains; ie; Lamb with fried capers, buttermilk fried chicken, duck meatloaf (?), Roast chicken for two(yawn)... Nothing special, the main courses were so underwhelming that I ordered two first courses instead.When you sit down they give you a few pop-overs for a starter bread, drizzled with clover honey and chunky sea salt. The pop-overs were a tad dry and not quiet as richly-eggy as I've had, but it was a fun and tasty way to start.We ordered; Hush Puppies with green chili aioli, foie grois/pork head terrine, watermelon arugula salad, chili-rubbed ribs and scallops with rhubarb and fennel.Hush-puppies were good, cooked perfectly and well spiced. The sauce was not spicy at all, (if there is chili in here it must be the secret part of the sauce.) The presentation was a joke. Four (yes four) small hush puppies the size of large marbles stacked in a tiny glass cup with mayo (oops aioli) on the bottom. So to dip the hush-puppies in the sauce you had to remove the top ones and set them on your plate and then eat the bottom ones first and then dip the aforementioned top ones in the sauce. Ridiculous. Not to mention they cost $5 dollars per order. 1.25 per tiny (and I mean tiny) hush puppy? Please...Terrine next, which was also very tasty. Came with pickled onion and shredded cabbage and standard crunchy toasted bread, all drizzled with a little too much balsamic reduction. Again the portion for cost was ridiculous, this shouldn't be Jean Georges haute causine, not if your fronting down-home cooking, certainly not at these prices. Perhaps they were rationing for labor day?Arugula salad was mediocre, skimped on the water melon and way way too much lime (and I fucking love lime, really). Baby-back ribs were tough, seasoning was nice, but had no guts, no punch. The perfect dish for someone who doesn't like spice or is a giant pussy. Have had awesome versions of both dishes at Fatty Crab, run their and have both.Scallops were quite good, perfectly cooked. Fennel and Rhubarb salad was very very tasty.Decore was about the same as the food uninspired. Trying to be down-home and straight forward, but coming off as boring. If your gonna try for soul, have some. This place is perfect for Brooklyn yuppies. Actually reminds alot of something like Sarabeth's on the upper west side, which is not a complement.Bill came to 100+ dollars before tip. Spend your 100 dollars somewhere else; Marlow and Sons, Momofuko Ssam Bar, Fatty Crab, Cassimir, Westville East, Frankies, there are so many to choose from.

One of my friends mentioned Buttermilk Channel, where she said we'd find some of the best chicken and waffles. After having Roscoe's in LA and Lolos in Phoenix, I knew a thing or two about good chicken and waffles, so I held her to that.As we first arrived at BC, I was blown away. My expectations were along the lines of a hole in the wall in Brooklyn, not the very nice and trendy restaurant that we saw before us. After an hour wait, my group of 7 including myself sat outside on their enclosed patio. We had fantastic service, especially for a group our size. The chicken and waffles were excellent (we had 7 orders!). You get 1/2 of a cheddar waffle, cole slaw, and a 1/2 chicken sectioned in to 3 pieces. The chicken was tender, the skin was crispy, the waffles were fantastic, and the cole slaw was delicious. While there were many positives, the chicken was too boney with not enough meat (especially for $18) and the balsamic reduction I thought could be sweeter (it being a stand in for syrup).

But does the food actually live up the the goodness of butter?A solid, maybe. Came here for brunch on a Sunday morning, and after enduring a 1 hour wait we were seated outdoors.

The homemade pickles also had a sweet and sour combination, but you have to be in the mood for them or be really hungry.

3.0,8/3/2010,"BRUNCH review only.  Maybe if I go back for dinner they'll redeem themselves a star.The food was good.  Brunch dishes also come with a complimentary Juice, Mimosa, or Sparkling Wine (I did find it odd that Coffee wasn't an option, but since they use Gimme Coffee, offering that stuff free for brunch could cut into their margins...)I ordered what was basically Eggs Benedict (this version was served on a biscuit).  Eggs were poached beautifully.  The hollandaise was lovely.  Bisquit was dense and buttery.  Yum.  It came with a side salad (I would've preferred some type of carb, but that's just me).The dish was executed really well.   But...it wasn't anything special in my opinion.  In fact, it was kind of a brunch let down.  It was majorly crowded/loud, and something about the atmosphere was very...pretentious.  Brunch should be about being comfortable, and I wasn't that morning.  Plus, even though the food was tasty, it wasn't worth schlepping all the was from Park Slope to Cobble Hill.If you live in the neighborhood, I say go for it for brunch.  If you don't, I say sleep in a bit longer and eat somewhere closer to you.I do want to try their dinner service.  Right now, they're at a 3.5 starts for me.",1,1,0,Jordan S.,"Denver, CO",31,138,22
4.0,8/3/2010,"Genius...one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration. ~ Thomas EdisonIt is quite apparent that a lot of perspiration, serious thought and hard work have been invested into Buttermilk Channel.  As a tribute to the area's history, the  restaurant  is named for the tidal strait between Brooklyn and Governor's Island in New York harbor (not their well known buttermilk fried chicken).  The deceptively simple decor creates an incredibly warm and cozy atmosphere through the use of strategic lighting.  Everyone on the staff appears to be warm, friendly and extremely efficient.All the menus (brunch, kids, vegetarian, dinner and dessert) are all very well thought out, with careful attention to quality food sources and artisanal preparations.  Items, such as the house-made pickles, ham and foie gras terrine, buttermilk whipped potatos, buttermilk fried chicken and pecan pie sundae, can make you mouth water just by reading the menu.  The dishes delivered to each table are creatively plated edible art work.  The complementary popovers are a lovely way to start a meal which by every indication would be perfect.Unfortunately, my meal was a bit of a let down.  I started with house made pickles which were OK.  An order of duck meatloaf followed.  Although it was well cooked and moist, the meatloaf was  bland. I yearned for my spice rack.  My companion's warm lamb salad was also bland.  The ham and foie gras terrine was enjoyable. (I have a weakness for foie gras and almost any cured pork product.)  I also enjoyed the pecan pie sundae despite (or maybe because of) the sugar coma which resulted.  Frankly, the only item which lived up to my expectations was one which we did not even order, the grilled pole beans with lemon and sea salt.  They were simple and absolutely divine!  A lovely couple seated at a neighboring table took pity on me after seeing our disappointment with the meal, and allowed me to sample their order.I cannot fault the efforts of Buttermilk Channel.  It is a good restaurant which excels in many ways; however, I do hope  the team finds the 1% inspiration needed to bring the food up to the level of the rest of its efforts.  For now, it is only practically perfect.",1,0,1,Elle B.,"Brooklyn, NY",15,26,8

4.0,7/26/2010,"I'm pretty frugal, so catching me at a place with 3 $ signs is very very rare.  But I could not help myself when I saw this place on TV (I think it was the Cooking Channel), and this lady was going on about their chicken and waffles being *amazing*.  To be honest, I've never tried chicken and waffles in my life.  I've had fried chicken before, and I've had waffles separately; but the thought of putting maple syrup on a perfectly good piece of fried chicken seemed like it would ruin it.  I've never been a fan of mixing savory and sweet (I never eat my turkey with cranberry sauce).           Well, I thought it was as good a time as any to give it a try, especially since it seemed like a lot of people are raving about it.  I used my birthday as an excuse to go, since I always need an excuse to eat at pricey places.  It was pouring on a Tuesday, and we figured, 'what the hey, we won't need reservations'. WRONG.  We waited for 50 minutes for a table, and there were so many people waiting that there was no space at the bar even.  I thought this place HAS to be good if people are waiting on line on a rainy Tuesday.  The hostess and waiters were very professional and friendly--apologizing profusely for having us wait (when it's really our fault for not reserving a table).           I wasn't too ecstatic about paying $18 for fried chicken; but when that plate came....boy oh boy!  It was 3 pieces of chicken and a big waffle.  I dug in, and was amazed at  the flavors in my mouth.  The batter used for the chicken, was slightly sweetened--not overly, but just a touch that perhaps even most diners would have missed it.  And then the waffle, with a bit of cheese baked in the batter, was just a touch savory!  This was genius food, with such restraint.  To top it all off, there's a slightly sweet syrup to go on top of everything, I think it was a balsamic reduction syrup.  This syrup is definitely a LOT less sweet than maple, which is perfect for me, it tasted great, but to be honest, I didn't need it.  In fact, pouring some on made my gorgeous crispy waffle turn to mush on my plate, since the 'syrup' wasn't very syrup-y, and therefore doesn't coat your waffle, it mostly gets soaked into the waffle.  So I stopped using it.             We also got the duck meatloaf.  I scoffed at how small it was for $20, but I can't scoff at its flavor.  That is seriously the most flavorful meatloaf you will ever eat--full of smoky duck flavor.  The large onion ring was kind of confusing and slightly odd on the plate, but provided some nice texture contrast to the (somewhat soft) meatloaf and the (very soft) parsnip mash underneath.  The mash was also quite flavorful, but there wasn't very much of it at all.  My poor boyfriend had to watch me eat my food while he finished his in 12 minutes.  I let him have a drumstick.

5.0,7/20/2010,"As far as brunch places go, this place is top notch. I've been to other brunch places that claim to be, or others claim to be the best brunch in NYC/BK. But how they are all so wrong. This is the place to go for brunch.After months of constant insisting by a friend, we went to Buttermilk for some Sunday brunch. With most places, when you get there between 11am and 12pm the wait is relatively short. However, because of the location of Buttermilk and its immense popularity, there is frequently a long wait. For my friend and I it was only about a 25 min, but we opted to sit outside in the heat because we were too hungry to wait. The wait after us was about an hour for most people. So if you should decide to go, I'd recommend to go early and be prepared to wait. On the bright side, the food does come out from the kitchen at a fast pace.After hearing so much about the delicious food, I had expected a lot, and Buttermilk Channel delivered. Every thing that we ordered was fantastic. The summer watermelon salad was great. I highly suggest it, especially for those who like goat cheese with their watermelon. Then there was the warm butter milk biscuits, served with a side of warm butter and a little jar of home made jam.  I also tried the buttermilk and cheddar waffles. It sounds like a weird combo, but its fantastic. Especially the fluffy waffles with the sharp cheddar and some maple syrup. I did not try my friend's ABC grilled cheese (Apple Bacon Cheddar) but it smelled great. I had the Scrambles with house smoked salmon. I don't usually like smoked salmon in my eggs, but this was great. Unlike most places, this dish was filling, and served perfectly. The eggs were fluffy and filling and not dry. Finally, the coffee was really good. Unlike most places, the coffee was flavorful and not burnt.Moral of my post, Run, don't walk to Buttermilk Channel for brunch.

4.0,7/15/2010,"Typically when I see reviews that seem to be strictly ""I want this restaurant to father my children"" or ""I will burn this shithole to the ground with my own hands, and laugh"" I fall in line with one of the camps and assume the other camp is full of bitter ex-employees/random psychopaths or delusional family members of the owner/people who think wet cardboard is ""pretty tasty :) :) :) luv it guyz lol!!!!""Not so with brunch at Buttermilk Channel.On one hand, I thought the food was pretty damn good. I got something that involved eggs in a cup, toast, and the cutest li'l hashbrown ever, and it was solid. I'm an asshole about eggs (I think I might actually hate eggs, something happens about 5 bites in where I get angry/grossed out/sad) and these eggs didn't upset me. They weren't too wet or too dry. Good job. We got side orders of the pickles  (that even my pickle-skeptical husband liked) and the cheese waffle, and I decided I'd probably punch someone for the cheese waffle. I wouldn't stab anyone for it, it's not THAT amazing, but it's easily good enough for a punch. I'm not remembering what my man got because he inhaled it, although I seem to remember snagging a piece of biscuit that was really nice. The food came out very quickly, and we were seated immediately in spite of the host informing us that we'd walked in about 20 minutes before brunch ended. We've definitely gotten turned away by places in this context so they win points there.On the other hand... here's the part where I agree with the people who are angry: our waitress seemed generally irritated. Listen, I know food service can suck as a job, but don't wait tables if you can't approximate believable friendliness. I'm not saying I could do it - in fact, my own lack of acting skills is why I worked IN the kitchen when I worked in food service. I get that you can theoretically make more money if you work OUTSIDE of the kitchen, but... can you really make that much more, if you're getting smaller tips because you're just kind of surly and you disappear a lot? Whatever, I'm just saying we'd have been much happier if it wasn't an ordeal to get our coffee refilled or get more milk for said coffee (which we never got), and yet somehow she was all up on us when we were pulling out our wallets to pay. I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE SURLY IF YOU'RE EFFICIENT, but if you're only around when the wallets open AND you're acting like I personally ruined your day, then I think it's time to consider jobs not involving contact with customers.As we were leaving, someone who I presume is involved in owning the place told us ""this is hardly us at our most glamorous, you should come back for dinner.""

My friend had the Trout stuffed & wrapped w/bacon with creamy grits- she loved it! & I had what I specifically went there for: their Fried Chicken & Waffles. It was excellent. The chicken was lightly spicy, crispy, crunchy but the meat was tender & juicy. The waffles were light but didn't detect the cheddar, & the Balsamic syrup was divine & a wonderful accompaniment- big portion too 3 pieces of chicken.

The Boy came for the coveted fried chicken and waffle. He glanced at the menu and nothing swayed his mind. I took the vegetarian menu and was delighted to see a vegetarian entree that had the cheddar waffles! Though I'm a vegetarian, I despise mushrooms. I asked for no mushrooms. We also got the hush puppies to start. Hush puppies: small app (probably best for 1 person) was fresh and hot and the aioli was delicious. Would definitely get again. Chicken & Waffles: he loved it and said it was worth the wait. Waffles w/ asparagus: these cheddar waffles are soooo good. Sooo worth the wait. The asparagus was grilled and had a nice smoke flavor, perfectly cooked so it was tender but not chewy. The mustard sauce was fresh but had a bit too much horseradish taste than I like. The cabbage slaw that came on the side was a perfect accompaniment. Normally coleslaw is drenched in mayo. This was light, though a bit too heavy with the red onions, and very fresh. For dessert he had the strawberry rhubarb tart and I had the chocolate caramel tart. My tart was delicious, salty and sweet. His hot fresh strawberry rhubarb tart was off the friggin hook. I hate strawberry rhubarb pie but I took one bite of this tart with a bit of melty vanilla ice cream and I couldn't help but utter a guttural moan. I would definitely come back here (despite my hatred for the F and G line) and would have no problem waiting around for an hour or more. I do like walking around in that neighborhood.

The hush puppies were the BEST I have ever tried. Hot and smooshy and so delicious. The flatbread was garlic-y and covered in cheese (can't go wrong) and the cheese plate was also very tasty. The real revelation on the cheese plate, however, came in the form of pickled grapes. A little strange at first (we thought they were olives) but very delectable.

4.0,5/4/2010,"Food is very yummy. The prefix has some nice selections off the main menu. I ordered the green tomato soup to start, which I thought was interesting and the little grilled cheese that goes with it hit the spot. Another dinner pal thought it was too acidic. I had the pasta- texture was nice but the pieces were a bit disjointed. Couldn't really get all the components in one bite...I guess that is the nature of peas. Could have used more pecorino. Heard the fried chicken was slamming as well as the brook trout. Pecan pie sundae made me smile. Also ordered the pickles, flat bread and chicken liver mousse off the main menu to share with the table. All very tasty. Biggest complaint is with the first server we had. She was incredibly indifferent and almost seemed put off if you had any questions. For example, she seemed very annoyed that after everyone ordered their food we added the three things that we wanted to share to have at the beginning. She never told us that she was leaving/finishing her shift so we had a second server for the rest of our meal who was lovely.

3.0,4/19/2010,"Went to brunch here this past Sunday after hearing good things about this place from a few coworkers and it's been on my ""Places to try"" list. We expected a wait so when we were told it was 45 minutes, there was no surprise. Walked around the area and then about 50 min -1 hour later, we got the call that our table was ready.  When we got back to the restaurant, the hostess told us that there was only seating available outside! Firstly, it was a somewhat cool day (50 degrees and kind of cloudy) and sitting outside was not something I really wanted to do, especially after waiting an hour. She should have been asked where we wanted to sit!  Secondly,  as she was telling us this, I saw about 3 empty tables inside!!  I asked her ""how much longer is the wait before we could sit inside?"" and she ""went to check"" and miraculously .. ""Oh, there appears to be a table inside!""  It definitely seemed like they were trying to get people to sit outside first since there were clearly like 8 tables open out there and many other people waiting to be seated.  That left a bad taste in our mouth but whatever, we were willing to get passed that and see what the food was about!  The décor was nice! Spacious, simple and having a very airy feel. We got seated and decided to share something sweet and something savory, so we ordered the pecan french toast, eggs benedict and a side order of the cheddar waffle. While waiting for our food to come and enjoying our coffees and mimosas, the Manager (?)came over to us and started telling us ""how he has a party of 4 and he's so sorry but would appreciate if we could shift our seats to accommodate this party."" Of course we moved and squished into a tiny little table between two other table.  Talk about strike 2. If the first incident didn't happen, it probably wouldn't have been a big deal, but it did and my boyfriend was pretty annoyed at this point. Greaaaaaaat! We finally got our food and I must say, I thought everything was delicious so I want to be fair there. I will say, I wish the cheddar waffle was a little warmer (it was kind of cold, but I'm not sure if that's how it's supposed to be?!) but the taste was delicious. The pecan french toast was amazing!!  I loved the eggs (which came on top of a biscuit), my boyfriend not so much.  In general, I thought the food was very good. He didn't love it but I think it's because he was off put by the entire situation.  He mentioned to me that the only way he would feel slightly better is if they took one of the drinks off the bill, and that they did..    so, we will give them credit there since that was the right thing to do.All in all, I'd come back for dinner, but it would have to be with my girlfriends b/c my boyfriend said there was no way he would go back..  Oh well!

Got there at 11.30 and the restaurant was packed and already turning tables from the first seating (Daaang you brooklyn people get up early!!). I was impressed far beyond expectations. Excellent scrambled eggs (we had the plain, with lox, and with sausage and they were all good), INSANE pancakes, the shortrib hash with poached eggs - a little heavy on the star anise for my taste, but a huge hit with the Pho' lovin friends that ordered it - the lamb salad very good, and the almonds with a bacon maple glaze... mmmmm. I was eyeballing the fried pork chop and waffles, but decided I didn't want to have a heart attack before I had a chance to explore the shops along Court St. While I had to wait until noon for the bloody mary I was jonesing for, the waitress delivered a round to our table at 12:00.01pm.

I even liked the grits, which were creamy and polenta-like. My fiance had the fried chicken. The skin was super-crisp. It might be a little too browned for some people's taste, but I was impressed with the level of crispness and the juiciness of the chicken within. I know that's a tough balance to hit, so it shows that the kitchen knows what they're doing.The people sitting next to us at the bar were working through the snacks and small plates.

The green tomato soup was fantastic. The best thing we ate all night, I thought. Fresh and simple and balanced with some cream and maybe shallots pureed in there? It was great. We got a second bowl when our waitress spilled half of my beer into the first serving.We also shared the baby turnips with honey. They were fine. A little too much liquid for my taste, but they were good. Not great.We split the much-lauded chicken and waffles. Here was the biggest disappointment of the night. It was just mediocre fried chicken, at best. The waffles were similarly boring, and there wasn't enough of them to truly act as a side to the (admittedly large portion of) fried chicken. This just was not a memorable entree.We finished by splitting the pecan pie sundae which was f-ing delicious. And filling. Can't tell you how much I enjoyed that sundae, and half of it was plenty.But this place just didn't have much charm for me. The walls are sterile, not minimal, and the space just felt too pre-fab for me to ever get comfortable. The service, even before the beer spill (which, frankly, wasn't a big deal, I've done that at tables too) felt impersonal and cold. But after she soiled the table her demeanor just felt more and more cold, like it was our doing.I don't  know. It's not  a bad place.

We all (3 top) jumped on the buttermilk fried chicken, two soups and a salad and the pecan desert.  The salad was fresh and carefully put together, the soup was wonderful proving the basics.  The desert was more than just ice cream and sugar in a fancy dish, the chef put some thought and time into prepping the pecans & cream.  The buttermilk fried chicken seemed to be the obvious choice as a namesake, but not so much. The pieces were small but we all received a good portion. The meat was very juicy and hot. The breading was the problem, a bit too crunchy and dry.  However clean with good flavor. I'd go back and try again, maybe it was just a busy moment and it stayed in a bit too long.The service was great. Not nearly as pretentious as I expected.

And what laid before me this New Years weekend afternoon?? *Pecan Pie French Toast...all those words together don't sound nearly as wonderful as this melt-in-your mouth french toast tasted. The homemade whip cream complimented the fluffy texture of the toast while the pecans coated in bourbon-infused molasses slowed my roll when chewing. An absolute delight, could easily be a desert. *Short Stack of Buttermilk Pancakes...for 5 measly dollars you get a NOT-so short stack of buttermilk pancakes that are so delicious in their purity that I wouldn't dare taint them with anything but maple syrup. *Cheddar Waffles-ordered these as a side out of curiosity. They were tasty, beginning with a sweetness reminiscent of your traditional Belgium waffle continued into savory overtones of cheddar with strength to even power through maple syrup. Unusual, but recommended. *Buttermilk Biscuits-These were on point in terms of flavor however even with some jam were a bit dry (not to be confused with crumbly); perhaps they weren't as fresh as biscuits in general usually need to be to be in peak condition as the place was a well greased machine of patrons and they probably don't make the biscuits to order.

3.0,2/24/2010,"I came here for the first time last weekend, after having had this place on my radar (and my official Yelp bookmarks) almost since it opened.  Mainly its been on my radar for brunch, as brunch takes precedence over dinner in my book; plus dinner is considerably more pricey.My brunch companions and I arrived around 9:58 on Sunday morning and were shuffled in the door promptly at 10, where we were settled with some coffee.  One bone to pick - they charge you for coffee, despite the conspicuous lack of a price listed for it one the menu, where the only mention of coffee is at the top of the menu, right under the blip about the free drinks that come with your brunch.  Shady!  Second bone to pick - you can't get a mimosa until after noon, so if you come early like we did, your ""free brunch cocktail"" deal suddenly doesn't look so good.I got the Short Rib Hash; my friends ordered the spinach/goat cheese scramble and the Eggs Huntington.  I was pleased they let me substitute the toast that comes with my meal for a biscuit.When the food came it was cold; the biscuit looked as if it had once been toasted but was now stone cold, and not as flaky and buttery as a biscuit should be.  The short rib hash was not stingy with the meat, but the flavor was nothing special - same for the salad that came with it.  My companions both said their food was good, but I got the feeling that it was only ""good"" in the same way that mine was.  Edible, but nothing special.Brunch for three came out to about $50 including tip, for cold food, no booze, and overpriced drip coffee (which should ALWAYS come standard with any brunch - they can afford to give me coffee if I'm paying them $12 for $0.50 worth of eggs).Three stars because the place was cute, brunch prices were standard, food was fine, and all in all it was a fun time.  We also stayed chatting until almost 1 and they just kept refilling our coffee, and our server was sweet.  However, it was a letdown after I'd been waiting to try it for so long.  I'd come back if I were in the area, but I won't be trekking down to Buttermilk Channel again otherwise.I have a feeling that maybe if you come during rush time, the food might get to your fresher and hotter, and that if I were to perfect my ordering it would be a 4-star brunch standard...Pecan Pie French Toast WHAT!  (We also saw some kids getting coffee cake with ice cream and syrup on top - those kids know how to play it!)",0,0,0,sarah d.,"Brooklyn, NY",62,79,2

The host fawned over us with grace and attention once she realized who my companions were. So, although my perception of the staff may have been slightly skewed, each element of the evening worked like a well oiled machine with unlabored friendliness, impeccable timing, and with nay a hint of pandering. After ordering from the generously sized Vegetarian menu, the first dish (actually more of a cup) to appear was the dill-icious House-made Pickles ($3) yelp.com/biz_photos/rU9c… a lovely crunchy cousin from the Claussen's clan. The spears and chips offer slight different flavors, but I devoured them much too eagerly to remember their distinctions.Caputo's Handmade Mozzarella with basil and black olives ($5) begged for salt. You'd think the olives would have sufficed, but, um... they didn't. The Sweet Potato and Goat Cheese Croquettes ($5) were unexpectedly uber goat cheesy and only mildly sweet potatoy, but as a girl who doesn't believe in ""too much cheese"" these were a-ok with me.Next came out the Delicata Squash Tart ($10) yelp.com/biz_photos/rU9c… a flaky buttery pastry layered under house-made buttermilk ricotta and savory squash medallions delicately held together beneath a lacy doily of cheese. It is a robustly soft dish that crumbled into a beautiful disaster as we stabbed it greedily with our forks.My BF ordered the Caputo's Fresh Linguini ($16) yelp.com/biz_photos/rU9c… miles of noodles fill the wide bowl along with brussels sprouts, roasted mushrooms and a confetti of pecorino and toasted breadcrumbs. After stealing bites of this dish, I still do not understand how someone would consider putting bread on pasta a good idea... that is unless you also feel that crab saturation is scandalously decadent... but this concept has been unfortunately driven out of our society by all the diet fear mongers out there. With the frequent mentions of the Cheddar Waffles ($14) yelp.com/biz_photos/rU9c… raining in from all culinary fronts, I felt I had not choice but to order them despite the fact that vegetarian accompaniments sounding less then savory. The vulgar mound of assorted roasted mushrooms were uniformly bland, the brussels sprouts were tender under the outer charred leaves but the dijon mustard vinaigrette smothered the nuance right out of them, and the cabbage slaw was a complete nonevent.Despite the entree letdown, a fateful truth of most vegetarian food, the small dishes that preceded them won me over.

3.0,2/7/2010,"My husband might drag me back here because he pronounced his warm lamb salad 'genius' but my pork chops and cheddar waffles were as bland as the sterile dining room. The pork was indistinguishable in its flavor and texture from the innards of a chicken cutlet from your standard pizza store and the coating was like  too much Shake N Bake from your mom's in Cleveland. The waffle was lukewarm and only had a cheddar aftertaste that reminded me of Cheese Nibs. Even the accompanying syrup was bland and tasted like water-down agave. The not-Stumptown coffee was good and I liked the lightly pulped orange juice. I was depressed at having to pay $15 for this meal, so great in conception and so flavorless in execution. Meanwhile, my SO was babbling happily about 'delicious jus' this and 'incredibly tender meat' that in between lusty bites so if you are going to Buttermilk Channel, consider that a lamb salad endorsement.",0,0,0,Alexis L.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,121,0

Regardless, the restaurant was packed on a Monday night.  We were quoted a 30 minute wait but were sat much sooner.We were treated to complimentary popovers and enjoyed a snack of sweet potato croquettes.  It felt like we were at somebody's grandmother's house.  Maybe that's what they were going for, but who's grandmother?  Mine never cooked fried chicken and duck meatloaf.  But I sort of wished she had.The service was good and the atmosphere comfortable, but the food was slightly disappointing.  The buttermilk chicken and cheddar waffles were very heavy (they were so dredged in batter that I couldn't even tell it was chicken) and rather cold by the time I got it.  The best part to the dish was the light and sweet maple balsamic.  I wish this place was called Maple Balsamic Channel.  It doesn't have the same ring to it, though.The apple and turnip soup was rather bland.  And the kale salad had difficult textures and strange temperature contradictions.  Nothing here was bad, but it was all rather underwhelming.  It's a cute place and I'll probably give it another chance, but it's not worth crossing any channels to get to.-eatthisny",2,1,2,Brian H.,"Astoria, NY",41,121,0

4.0,1/12/2010,"When a restaurant dares to use the word ""buttermilk"" in its name, I'm not going for wheatgrass shakes or sushi or Korean bbq.  The word ""buttermilk"" evokes pancakes, fried chicken, ice cream, and other artery-clogging but delicious foods. Fortunately, Buttermilk Channel does the word ""buttermilk"" proud with its brunch.There are a couple minor barriers you'll have to overcome: 1) the wait: when we arrived at 1ish on sunday, we were told the wait was going to be at least 1.5 hours. But if you don't mind sitting at the first-come, first-serve 10-seat bar, the wait can be as short as our 10-minute one; 2) the distance: it's not close to too many subways and is more in red hook than cobble hillBut oh the food is worth these minor obstacles--I was disappointed that they don't have their fried chicken and waffles on the brunch menu but my feeling was short-lived. The short rib hash w/ 2 sunny-side up eggs seemed like 95% short rib and 5% hash, a ratio that I was very happy about. The lox, scallion and cream cheese egg scramble was creamy and decadent, and it came with a savory hash brown and biscuit (which we wisely substituted for toast thanks to the advice of other yelpers). We also split a short stack (3) of pancakes that my g/f couldn't stop eating. I think there was a hint of vanilla in the batter that gave it a nice little kick. One of the best things about BC is that no brunch dish is over $15, and it comes with your choice of juice (although granted, it's a pretty small glass). The service was friendly and attentive at the bar, and I already have my sights set next on the pecan pie french toast after I lose a couple pounds from this meal.

We heard that it gets packed so we made reservations a little on the late side (had a crazy night planned for Saturday). Surprisingly, we all woke up early and starving. The staff was incredibly accommodating and moved up our reservations to satiate our empty tummies. We were given a great corner table and our waitress Caitlin was a saint. She knew from the look of us to promptly bring coffee was patient while we stared blankly at the menus salivating and wondering if we could maneuver ordering everything. As a former waitress, I know it can be very irritating when a table asks for a new thing every time you go there i.e. ""can we have some ketchup? syrup? more coffee? OJ? We had Caitlin running all over the restaurant and never did she roll her eyes or tsk, just kept smiling.Now to the food, after intense deliberation I ordered the Eggs Huntington. I normally am skeeved by runny yolks but they were just the right amount of runny to soak the warm biscuits with ham and hollondaise heaven. I definitely recommend it. The pancakes - though traditional - looked unbelievable as well. Brunch comes with coffee or tea AND juice, mimosa, bellini, or sparkling wine. Why only three stars?

5.0,12/10/2009,"This was one of the best meals I had during my 4 months in NY!  Our party of 4 arrived around 7pm on a Sunday night.  It's somewhat inconvenient that they only take reservations for a party of 5 or more.  So we ordered drinks at the bar and waited.  The wait wasn't so bad though, considering they initially told us at least 45 minutes and a seat at the communal table.  Instead, we waited around 20-30 minutes and got our very own table.  We picked this place because it had a separate menu for vegetarians, but also had an incredible variety of interesting dishes.  It sure didn't disappoint.  Our vegetarian diner was delighted with her cheese waffles.  Based on a recommendation from our server, I went with the most popular dish of buttermilk fried chicken.  I didn't even realize it came with waffles as well...and of course syrup for dipping!  =)  It was excellent, along with the bacon wrapped trout ordered by the guys.  How can you possibly go wrong with anything that has bacon in it.  Really enjoyed the sweetness of the prune jam, which worked well with the saltiness of the bacon.Oh, I almost forgot about the highlight, which was the complimentary cheesy bread they serve at the beginning of the meal.  It was so warm and lovely; I wanted more!  We also shared the spiced ribs, which were good, although I thought could have been more flavorful.  The squash tart was nice as well.For dessert we split the pecan pie sundae and apple bread pudding.  I preferred the warm bread pudding, although my dining companions ate up the sundae, which is apparently their most popular dessert, according to our server.  I found it to be too sweet, but it was finished at our table.  I might be generous giving it 5 stars, but we had such a disappointing meal the night before and spent double what we spent here.",2,1,1,nini t.,"San Francisco, CA",18,126,17

We showed up on a Friday night and were told we had an hour and a half waiting ahead of us so we put our names down (as well as our phone number). We went to a nearby bar and got a call 45 minutes later letting us know our table was ready. Nice.We arrived and were thanked by several employees for, ""being kind enough to wait"". Pretty nice considering waiting is pretty expected at a place like this. I appreciated that a lot. Makes you feel like not just another number, but a customer that they care about making happy.We ordered a bunch of stuff to start out (bacon/maple almonds, cheese plate, mustard crusted bacon). It was all pretty good. I liked the blue cheese and the mustard bacon best. Thought the almonds were a bit overrated, though interesting.We both had the fried chicken and cheddar waffles, because really, what else would you have on your first visit? It was solid. Very well done fried chicken - crispy and flavorful without being greasy at all. It really was a sort of ""gourmet"" chicken and waffles.For dessert (of COURSE we had dessert...) we got a cookie plate and a root beer float to share. Both solid, though nothing spectacular about either one.I'd come back and get the chicken and waffles again.

Ugh, I guess that's what we get for coming late.  I ended up getting the house cured lox, green onion, and cream cheese scramble.  I had a muffin prior to coming (bad move) so I wasn't able to enjoy my meal to the fullest.  However, I DID order the court street bloody mary and it was tasty! The decor was also very simple, quaint.  The little cow located randomly on the brick wall was cute.One word of advice - get here early for brunch so they don't run out of the all the goodies!Will def be back to try what was originally planned.  A lot of ppl were ordering the maple and bacon roasted almonds so that is a must try next time around.  At one point we thought it was some sort of conspiracy to temporarily stop serving certain items off the menu to get patrons to return.  I think it's a great idea :) See ya soon!",3,3,2,Jen R.,"Los Angeles, CA",158,245,378

4.0,11/16/2009,"All right, y'all. Times are Tough 2009 continues its theme. It's almost been two weeks since I've written a review. I've been crippled by a work project, a dwindling bank account, and exhaustion, so I've barely ventured beyond the compounds of work and home. I have a draft saved for a review of the Union Square Wendy's. And I was giving it three stars.* WHAT IS GOING ON?!So when Preeti B asked me out to brunch on Sunday, I jumped at the opportunity. Anything to avoid leftover pizza, am I right?** Plus, I've been meaning to check out Buttermilk Channel for a while.We were extremely lucky to have beautiful weather on the day we went because it's true that there will always be a wait. ""Thirty minutes, but be generous with me, please,"" said the hostess. Of course, of course. Half an hour later we were seated outside, a romantic table for two.Here's where Buttermilk gains my respect: Your brunch includes your choice of tea or coffee, as well as your choice of orange juice, mimosa, bloody mary, or champagne. THANK YOU. Never make me choose between a mimosa and coffee. I'll skip the caffeine for a buzz in most cases, but I will be Grump McGrumperson regardless.I ordered the scrambles with mushrooms, goat cheese, and spinach. Dee-lish! I was mainly in it for the additional sides: hash browns, two pieces of toast, and a little salad. It beat paying $4 for an extra side. Preeti, on the other hand, ordered the Pecan Pie French Toast, and after tasting it, I was left slack-jawed. Then we got into it about which is better: Cake or Pie? To which I replied, ""Pie!"" and Preeti said, ""Well, you are from Pennsylvania."" Props to my Society of Friends!The inside layout was a little cramped, and there's only one bathroom (albeit, a lovely perfumed one!) so don't hold it in. Buttermilk may not be a total home run for me (the food was good but I could probably make what I ordered at home), but the ambiance and prices make it worth it.And heck, it beats Wendy's. __________* The review started out as a joke until I realized I was actually reviewing it.

For entrees, my hubby got the fried chicken which was also bland (but juicy) and generally overrated (the slaw it came with was great though).  He asked for 2 breasts but one was a strange cut w/out a lot of meat on it.  One tasted almost undercooked.I got the duck meatloaf, which was too salty.  The onion ring it came with was totally tasteless, and the turnip/parsnip puree was just ok.Hubby got the root beer float for dessert which was WAY too wintergreen-y.  My cappuccino was terrible.  BUT my choc/caramel tart was AMAZING.  I practically licked the plate.All that, w/one glass of wine, was $100 for dinner.  PLEASE save your money and go elsewhere!  It is SO not worth your time (90 mins?

Will just add some points of interest and personal experiences.We got there at 1, they put our names on the list and took my number so we could wander off and do some shopping. Called about 20 mins later, earlier than expected. They are super-professional about seating, so it makes waiting in line relatively painless. By 1:30, the line was crazy, but I got the impression that if we'd gotten there a bit earlier, we wouldn't have had a problem. Food: I had the pecan pie french toast, and it's as good as it sounds! My friend had scrambled eggs w/ hot sausage etc. (or something) - she was slightly underwhelmed. We got sides of cheese waffle (what an amazing invention! Do try - I don't know how they get them so cheesy!) and apple cider donuts (also pretty tasty, though not rant-worthy).(One of the) best part(s): Free coffee/tea AND a choice of mimosa, juice, sparkling wine and something else included  - let me repeat that - FREE MIMOSA! That takes it from being an averagely priced brunch place (most items c. $10) to being an amazing deal, at least in my books. They also have this incredible Bloody Mary menu which had me drooling at the descriptions (they also looked really tasty and big) but which were a bit too pricey for me to justify ($8-10 each).Note: by the time we got there, they had run out of pork chops, so if you want your Sunday morning pork fix, get there early.Note 2: There seems to be a couple of noise complaints in other reviews, but we sat in the back and had absolutely no problem hearing each other.

The place didn't start filling up until around 7;30 and by 8pm it was crowded.

Everyone unanimously loved the Bacon almonds, pickles, flat bread, and the pecan pie and peach cobbler sundays. I disagreed with the group on the bread pudding. I found it a bit dry and as a consequence the burnt edges didn't add a yummy burnt sugar taste but just a burnt taste. Everyone individually loved their entrees. I had the scallops & mussels with soba in basil broth. The scallops were cooked to perfection. Nicely seared on the outside and plump and juicy inside.  The broth was delicious.  The only negative was the lack of bread to sop it up afterward.The wine list had a good range of prices and varietals, mostly domestic, with a couple of NYS's better offerings.

(plus one.) for example, not sure if it was the best business decision, but the waitstaff held a table for a party of eight that was more than 45 minutes late. instances like that are impossible to find in NYC ... or any other establishment for that matter. we started off with the sweet potato and goat cheese croquettes for appies as well as the house rolls. the rolls were sweet and doughy but i wasn't a fan of the croquettes. for some weird reason, they tasted and smelled like unwashed, oily hair ... how i know this? don't ask. as for entrees, i had the lamb salad while the rest of my fam had the scallops. (i would ordered the latter as well, but felt that i needed to add some diversity to the table!) i throughly enjoyed my plate and felt the soft-boiled egg that came with was a nice touch ... until i ran into a huge hunk of fat midway. mmmm, lamb fat. FYI - the scallops were smothered in basil which i loved. we ordered cookies and the pecan sundae for dessert. i didn't try the cookies - they looked overdone - but the sundae was layers of yummy goodness. in fact, i think mama polished it off which is jarring because i've never seen her do that in my 25 years of being her daughter.since ma is totally traditional, some call it backwards, the bro - the man of the house (ha!) - footed the meal. however, i'm not complaining - this night was one of those rare instances where i fell into my proverbial baby of the house role, black car home and all.* - karma sure is a bitch - i think god was punishing me for being a fat brat in my youth. each block she whined, ""are we there yet?""",5,5,5,Aimee O.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",282,238,10

It's very near the Gowanus Canal and is in a cool nabe that's rebounding quite a bit since I was last in Brooklyn in 2008.Had a really great cocktail while I waited for my friend. It was a cooling gin drink.

It's really the kind of food that you want to have for dinner every night of the week but are too tired to make at home after a long day's work. So yes, it's American food, it's nothing spectacular, but it's well-cooked and good. The wine and beer list were well-selected and short enough for someone starving with low-blood sugar (like me) to be able to read and quickly choose from.The service is really nice and the environment is very relaxing. I love the type of interior where you hardly notice it because the designer thought for weeks about which white paint was perfect for the natural light streaming through the front windows. The temperature was perfect, acoustics were good enough for conversation but you could definitely hear the tinny restaurant noises in the background. Nice touches. I applaud them for their attention to detail and comfort which make this restaurant a haven.",0,0,0,Michelle B.,"Cincinnati, OH",28,127,8
5.0,8/14/2009,"Perhaps the best dining experience I've had on Court Street. Admittedly the restaurant is my ""go-to"" place for special occasions so I have the haze of a beautiful woman and a birthday or two that likely contribute an extra star to what might otherwise be a 4 star review - but hey, the excellent atmosphere is why I pick the place for special occasions to begin with.Heavy, rich, comfort food in sane portions. Huge windows with natural light, fantastic (no really, I mean it) fantastic staff.But please, don't go there for brunch, I hate all you people on the line ahead of me.Actually I take that back, you all have great taste and I'd like to add you on facebook.See you at the Channel.",1,0,0,Gordon M.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,30,0

I went during Memorial Day weekend and the scene was lively, but not overcrowded. Our group of five sat at the large center table and enjoyed the charming, sun-drenched dining room as much as the yummy food. My pecan pie french toast was so delightful that I paid no attention to what my friends were eating (but from the sound of things, it seemed that they too were enamored of their breakfast), and the buttermilk biscuits were perfectly flaky.  I'll definitely be back to try their dinner.",0,0,0,Maleeha K.,"New York, NY",9,22,0

3.0,8/4/2009,"First, the restaurant is beautiful and I am glad they are in our neighborhood.  The staff I encountered on my first and only night to eat there was so kind (host, hostess, waitress, bartenders) and welcoming.  I felt like they wanted my business and they treated us very well.  My 3 star rating is because we had a few let-downs with our dinner.  We ordered the flatbread with squash blossoms and buttermilk ricotta to start.  Sounds wonderful and delicate, right?  It should have been, but whoever prepared it had a seriously heavy hand with the coarse salt.  I'm not opposed to salt and my husband is always telling me that I should add more to my cooking, but we could not eat more than 1 piece.  I had the bacon wrapped brook trout and it was good.  No complaints, but no real excitement.  My husband got the fried chicken. The chicken was great and I consider myself someone that knows alot about the dish.  However, the waffle was bland.  It would have been better with potatoes.  What redeemed the whole meal was the PEAS side dish!  Get it if you go and eat them with your fried chicken.  We did not try dessert.",1,0,1,Katie T.,"Austin, TX",1,87,0

I got the bacon wrapped trout, which was delicious. My husband got the friend chicken. The chicken was nothing to write home about, but the waffles that come with it were AMAZING.

5.0,7/17/2009,"Update: 2/20/2010Last night we ventured to Buttermilk after getting hour long waits at Frankies and Prime Meats.  Boy did we make a good decision.  Again, Jennifer, the lovely hostess at the front was more than accommodating and gracious- we sat at the bar for dinner.  I really feel like something has changed here, the energy was different and the food was spot on.  We started off with the baby back ribs - a dry rub, scented with tarragon and served with a simple slaw.  The meat was tender and flavorful.  Vegetable tart was ridiculously buttery and very tasty as well as the bacon.  For the main course we had the Skirt steak cooked to the chef's liking (always do this folks) as well as the fried chicken and cheddar waffles. Simply divine take on the Southern classic and incredibly delicious.  How could we walk away without having a couple of desserts? We had the Pecan pie sundae; I believe I got one bite in before my comrades finished it off.  As well as the Bread pudding - you won't be able to stop eating this.The staff, the food, the scene (jason schwartzman was there) was fabulous. We could definitely call this a regular spot for us. Original Review:(Summer 2009)Buttermilk Channel - for some reason, the name makes me think of a viscous-sour-yellowish river with fried chicken floating down... but I am from the south, so of COURSE i'll think of fried chicken, or buttermilk biscuits... ok, enough of the diatribe!  Since we're new to the neighborhood, the top of the list is to find the best food haunts and I read some good reviews on this place. Unlike my interpretation of the name, the place is named after the real Buttermilk Channel en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bu… - so, i'm not too far off in my imagination!  The crowd is definitely a mix of people grabbing grub after a day of work to young hipsters with kids and then the yuppy crowd too.  I tried one of their Signature cocktails; the blackberry something of the other - take my suggestion and skip this one; it's bland and boring.  The hostess was amazing and got us in an hour early, it might have something to do with that we figured out we have the same last name, but regardless, she was super friendly!  The menu is simple, american fare with lots of local grub from Caputos up the street.  I opted for the Mozz with bread and pesto - it's.. boring and the bread is larger than the mozz - so , skip this.  My husband had a green salad with dandelion greens and beautiful turnips - a great summer choice.  For dinner, husband ordered the bacon wrapped trout and I had the Beef.  It was SOLID good food, not overwhelming portions but after a couple of glasses of wine, set us back a good $100.00 or so.  I'm not really sure the food constitutes paying $100, but you could tell that BC uses great ingredients and they pay attention to the food, which in my opinion is a MUST.  SO, will we go back? Yes, we'll try the brunch one of these days - but the price range definitely makes this a non-regular haunt for us.",0,0,0,Tonsies S.,"Manhattan, NY",29,101,3

I asked for horseradish (I like horseradish on my hamburger; sue me), and they grated it fresh for me.  The burger would have been a 9+ on a 10 scale even without the horseradish, but .....You get the point.Excellent service.  Waiter would probably have turned actual somersaults if we had asked.  (See comment about horseradish.)Some reviewers fret that B.C. is loud.  We didn't find that, but it wasn't awfully crowded when we were there (Tuesday evening).",0,0,0,Bob K.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,8,0

The hostess met us on the sidewalk and was so casual and friendly that I thought she was a patron waiting for a table. The manager/owner person talked to us for a bit and came to take a drink order right away.Btw, the drinks are lovely, inventive and carefully made. The brunch prices are super reasonable and are accompanied by juice or tea and i believe a drink (unless ours were comped by the lovely person we spoke with). The brunch is classic with a little comfort food twist... I saw the porkchop and cheddar waffles and will order it next time!The pancakes are special, order a short stack to share or pecan french toast for the table in addition to your meal. I ordered the short ribs hash and it was a real delight. The hash was delicately spiced and tender with two sunny side up eggs that were perfectly soft and had slightly crispy edges.  Hubby ordered the Benedict (which was called something else), it was served on a real buttery homemade biscuit with thick cut ham that was tender juicy and out of this world. The hollandaise sauce was rich and slightly lemony Mmmmm. We will return VERY soon. Hopefully I can make it here with the girls for dinner & drinks this week as well.

5.0,6/29/2009,"Amazing.  Absolutely wonderful.  Our new favorite place.The Service: everyone here, from the girl at the door to our waitress, was friendly and helpful.  Ask for recommendations on food/drink, as we basically created our whole meal this way.  The wine choices were perfect.The Food: very much comfort food.  Simply put: wow.  The chicken was so moist and the sauce for dipping was perfect (sweet, tangy, spicy).  We got bacon/sugar infused almonds which were out of this world.  The burger meat was unreal: moist, cooked, flavorful.  The pecan sundae was packed with flavor and yet, simplistic at the same time.  Both my wife and I had the perfect glasses of wine, selected by our waitress, that we actually wrote down the names of them (which, to this day, we have never done).  The decor: here is my first negative.  It is a bit noisy during busy times.  Once things calmed down a bit, it wasn't as bad.  But during peak hours, holding a quite conversation would be near impossible.  The bathroom is about 10x more comfortable and homey feeling than my own bathroom.  Cost: it's not cheep.  But, at the same time, there are reasonably priced items so you don't feel like your getting ripped off (IE: the amazing burger and fries dinner is $11).  Expect a wait during busy times.  But, swing by and put in your name.  Also, they do have a big table in the middle.  So if you had a big family gathering (like 10-12 people), and you could afford it, this would be perfect.",1,1,1,Mike P.,"Brooklyn, NY",89,309,59
4.0,6/19/2009,"It's like walking into a Manhattan establishment. Really. My girlfriend and her mother went here to eat and since they were locals of the neighborhood, they said that you really couldn't walk down this block at night and expect anything good to come out of it.Well here comes Buttermilk Channel, a newer addition to the lovely sky rocketing (and yet, still somewhat quiet) Carroll Gardens. Packed to the brim with an awesome Yelper at the hostess helm, we got drinks in the front corner of the long bar, and it's basically a very pristine place. It's old school decor, and seemed like a place that Dillinger would go to for brunch; the soft yellows and extremely friendly waitstaff combined to a great experience. It's a bit rollicking but that's exactly what a gangster would need to get some anonymity going.It's not a cheap place by any means, but the bacon-wrapped trout was pretty amazing (I love fingerling potatoes). I think our appetizers were nasty good; I had a few oysters which I downed and felt like a million even though I was wearing shorts.Is it my kind of Brooklyn? Probably not. Like I said it's kind of like you got shot back into Manhattan a bit, either Tribeca but more likely uptown.

4.0,6/8/2009,"A friend once noted to me that Carroll Gardens is basically ""urban utopia"", and I think I'd have to agree.  They've got quiet, tree-lined streets, dozens of high-quality independent businesses, and nary a high-rise in sight.  It's not touristy or douchey, and it's serviced by the F train, The City's Most Useful Subway Line.  I'd totally move there if I weren't madly in love with my apartment in DUMBO.  Buttermilk Channel sits on the southern tip of Carroll Gardens, and its modernized comfort food, its reference to a local waterway, and its fresh whites/dark wood decor are the neighborhood embodied.  Classic, nostalgic, but new.  I've been now for both brunch and dinner, and can say with confidence that I'd highly recommend the former, but the latter not so much.  If you do go for dinner, without question start with the chicken liver mousse.  SO DIVINE, and they were super nice about giving us extra toast so we weren't reduced to licking the bowl, which we absolutely would have done.  It was incredible.  The entrees didn't work so well for us--the waffles (as part of the chicken and waffles) were too dry to be helped by the drizzle of balsamic reduction that accompanied them--at least for me, waffles need to be smothered in maple syrup, no substitutions.  And while the bacon-wrapped trout had promise (how could it not, being bacon-wrapped?), in execution it seemed not very well thought out.  The trout itself was cooked perfectly, but the bacon wrap--which was really more like a tiny bacon ribbon--didn't add much of anything in the way of flavor, and the fingerling potato and ramp ""hash"" was not at all hash-like, but simply a couple of fingerling potatoes sliced lengthwise and tossed in mustard.  I'm sorry, but where I come from we call that potato salad.Brunch, on the other hand, YES YES YES!!  $10 or $11 gets you an entree, coffee or tea, and a champagne cocktail.  How are they even making money on this?  My Eggs Huntington (essentially Benedict, but with biscuits and fancier ham) were probably the best egg dish I've had this year.  The ham was smokey and juicy and utterly amazing.  The eggs were perfectly poached, and the dish came with a nice little side salad, so I didn't feel like a complete oinker (I felt like a complete oinker an hour later at the Brooklyn Beer experiment, where I pretty much had a second brunch).  My friend's short ribs hash happily fell well within the category of ""hash-like"".  Delicious, supremely affordable brunch?

4.0,6/8/2009,"There are moments in a person's life in which guilt is washed away and true pleasure reigns. This was the feeling I had, in an instant, when I bit into Buttermilk Channel's Bacon in a mustard sauce. For $5 you were served two pieces of thick-cut, high-quality bacon in a slightly smoky, sweet mustard sauce that brought hosannas from on high as your mouth rejoiced in it. This bacon could stop wars. It could start religions.Okay, enough about the bacon.  (But it was very, very good.)  The place is pretty loud, so if possible, sit outside (or just talk even louder than the crowd).  I'm not into very loud dinners so I don't think I'd be happy eating indoors.I had a fantastic time at Buttermilk channel for a number of reasons. My Fair Harbor cocktail was essentially a well-made Dark and Stormy.  Delicious, albeit somewhat pricey ($11). Oysters on the half shell are one of my many weaknesses, and my neighborhood suffers from a lack of places that serve them.  So I was delighted to order 8 of the succulent bivalves with the accoutrements of a housemade cocktail sauce and a blood-orange mignonette. At $2.25 a piece they weren't a steal but they were very good oysters and that price is maybe on the low end of standard for NYC.At the recommendation of a friend from an earlier BBQ in Fort Greene I ordered the Duck Meatloaf, not knowing what to expect.  What emerged looked like a large burger patty with an onion ring on top, in a gorgeous vibrant green puree of salsify.  The dish was rich, almost overpoweringly so, but flavors that made my eyes roll back into my head at least once.Service was excellent.  Tight, professional, never cloying.We got there at 7 on a Saturday and were seated almost immediately; by 8 o clock they were quoting over an hour wait.The only complaint, besides the noise was that the apple popovers (replacing what most restaurants would serve as bread) were slightly burnt and not good.I will go back, definitely.  They have a very good thing going, but know this--eating here will break any and all diets.  And that is something to embrace!",15,11,13,Matt D.,"Brooklyn, NY",93,53,1

2.0,5/10/2009,"For my first trip out to Brooklyn, I decided to go to Buttermilk Channel after hearing some good things about it.  The wait was about an hour long, so I had high hopes.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.The place was loud- very loud.  I found it a little difficult to hold a conversation over the noise.  Atmosphere-wise, it wasn't anything spectacular, the usual dim lighting, some exposed brick but this part seemed a little out of place with the rest of the minimally decorated white walls.Service was...interesting.  First of all, when I asked for a wine recommendation and told the waitress what kind of wine I liked, she said ""I know exactly what wine to get you"", and left the table without telling me what it was or anything about it.  The wine itself was ok, not really what I was looking for.  When I asked what her favorite things on the menu were, all she said was ""Everything is good.  But a lot of people order the chicken and waffles"".  She didn't really offer any helpful information or details.  Later in the meal, when she handed us the dessert menu and I asked her what she recommended, she said she had never tried any of the desserts on the menu so she didn't know.  Isn't it part of the waitstaff's job to be knowledgabel about the food the restaurant serves?On to the food:- Sweet potato and goat cheese croquettes:  completely boring an unforgettable.  Basically it was a fried ball of mashed sweet potato, without even a hint of goat cheese, or any other flavor.- Cheese plate:  the cheese itself was pretty good, although we didn't really get an explanation of what they were, but the biggest issue was the bread that was served with it.  It was completely charred!  What kind of restaurant serves its customers burnt bread?- Fried chicken with cheddar waffles:  The chicken itself was pretty good; moist, crispy skin, the way fried chicken should be, although I wouldn't say it was particularly memorable.  The cheddar waffles it was served with was actually kind of cold.- Duck meatloaf:  more of a duck patty than meatloaf, this was an amazing dish that I absolutely loved.  Served on a bed of creamed spinach and topped with a large crispy onion ring, the flavor was incredible.  I almost licked my plate clean.- Chocolate chip bread pudding:  I was told it was served warm, but it actually arrived room temperature, with the top of it slightly warm.  It was extremely dense and aside fromnt he bits of chocolate, it was kind of bland.Although I'm glad I went for the duck meatloaf, I definitely won't be back for another visit.",1,0,2,Velina L.,"New York, NY",283,558,9

4.0,5/4/2009,"BRUNCH REVIEW: I live right up the street from this place, so I've been wanting to stop by for some time now.  My cousins and I decided to drop in this past Sunday for brunch.  We opted for the no reservation approach-- mostly because we figured like most NYC brunch places, they didn't take reservations... we were wrong!  Score one for Buttermilk.We arrived around 11:30am on this rainy, dreary Sunday morning.  There was, predictably, a 45-minute-to-an-hour wait, plus everyone was smushed up inside the area immediately next to the door.  Not wanting to stand around for an hour, we left and wandered around the neighborhood for a bit.  They took our phone number down and said they'd call when our table opened up.  After about 45 minutes, we headed back to Buttermilk.  Unfortunately, due to weather/parking issues and reservations showing up late, our table still wasn't ready.  So we stood inside browsing the menus for another 15 minutes or so.  Right around then, I thought to myself, ""y'know, they have been very gracious and apologetic about the wait situation, but it'd be really nice if they offered us some complimentary drinks to tide us ove--""  And before I could complete my thought, along came the manager to apologize and offer us a free round of drinks/coffee.  Another point for Buttermilk.We finally were seated after a total of roughly an hour and half wait.  They sat us at the end of the communal table, which, given the ample amount of space afforded to each place setting at the table, I thought was actually pretty nice and added to the homey feel of the place.  We ordered some bloody marys (I got the Classic, my cousin got the Court Street garnished with antipasti from Caputo.  She won.), and our food.I ordered the Salmon Platter.  I have to say, the salmon was pretty great and the dish as a whole was very tasty.  I think because I had been waiting around for so long, it wasn't quite enough to fill me up.  It's a good thing my cousins had some leftovers...One cousin ordered the Short Rib Hash and the other ordered the Fried Pork Chops & Cheddar Waffles.  Both were very good (my mouth is starting to water just writing about them).  The Hash wasn't too salty (which is my complaint about a lot of hash) and the Pork Chops were very juicy and tender.  The Cheddar Waffles were a near-perfect combo of salty and sweet (with the syrup).  Outside of the crazy wait (note to self: make reservations next time), the brunch as a whole was very solid.  It didn't blow my mind, but it's definitely worth coming back for.  And, if nothing else, I'm really excited to try their dinner!",1,0,1,Eugene S.,"Chappaqua, NY",74,31,4
2.0,5/1/2009,"Completely average. We went for comfort food, had comfort food but wouldn't go back.Buttermilk seems to have a bit of a rep for its fried chicken and this was the best bit of the meal. However, it was under spiced/ seasoned for my taste and in being served with waffles was a bit strange for me (though I understand this is a standard side in the South and the American I was with enjoyed it).  The rest of the food was a failure from a chef who should have stuck to the basics.I had what was described has home made mozzarella, basil and bread. What arrived on the plate was a kebab with semi bbq'ed mozz, squashed olives, some toasted bread and basil paste over it.  I am not quite sure what was meant to happen with this dish.  It doesn't work as a kebab. It didn't work any other way either. The mozzarella wasn't good enough, the other ingredients were over oiled and a slimey splodge. The other things we ate were pickles (average but needed more vinegar in the prep), a cranberry salad (fine) and a sweet onion soup with the cheese on the side (underwhelming).Apart from that it is a nice venue with good drinks and would be a good place to sit and drink at the bar in the summer.

3.0,4/15/2009,"Oh, Buttermilk Channel.  I had such high expectations for you.  All the blogs were gushing, you're on my street, even the Times ventured out to dear old BK to put their two cents in.Cut to the actual dining experience.  High marks for decor, service, and menu.  However, subtract points for the execution of said menu.  My romaine salad with warm lamb and romaine was the un-saladiest salad I've ever had in my life.  My plate received a mere two sad leaves of lettuce (albeit big ones), topped with many enormous and squashy looking somethings that I can only assume were the croutons described on the menu.  In my experience, croutons a) are crunchy and b) don't make up 85% of a salad.  The lamb, while tasty and tender, was difficult to distinguish from the croutons, though perhaps this was because it was so scarce on the salad.  Points for the roasted cauliflower, which was flavorful, easy to identify and pre-cut into nice, bite-sized florets, but subtract serious points for the fact that the fried capers I had been looking forward to did not make an appearance on my plate.  Oh, and there was a soft-boiled egg sitting on top as well, but since it was mostly cold & congealed (temperatures were all off on this dish) I forgot about it until just now.  All of the ingredients (when present and of the proper texture) should taste very good together, and the flavors themselves were not bad at all.  However if I'd wanted to gorge myself on carbohydrates, I simply would have asked for more of the delicious goat-cheese popovers that were brought to our table at the start of our meal. What should have been an intriguing combination of textures (crunchy croutons, lettuce; soft & runny egg and lamb and capers) and temperatures (cold lettuce; room-temp croutons; warm egg, lamb and capers) were instead a homogenous mush.Now that I've attacked my entree, I must say that the dessert was very good.  However, the dessert was three scoops of ice cream, which is fairly difficult to get wrong, but the taste was richy, creamy and excellent, ie, not diet ice cream.  Yum.  With three m's.  And extra points to anyone who can tell me what movie that is from ...Buttermilk Channel has a lot going in its favor.  The residents of the surrounding neighborhoods are in love with the place as it was consistently packed throughout our meal, service and decor are excellent, and the menu looks delicious.  Once the execution of each dish is polished, I think the restaurant will be a winner, but for the time being I can only recommend ordering with care, and sticking to the more straightforward items on the menu.",2,1,1,Linnea N.,"Washington, DC",9,10,0
5.0,4/13/2009,"I kept hearing about Buttermilk Channel. The New York Times ran an article, some women were gushing about it on the subway, and then I passed by it not long ago while going down Court Street. My nose sniffed a fad-laden, perhaps pretentious and maybe not so enjoyable experience, but boy, was I wrong. Buttermilk Channel truly pleased in every sense of the term. I kept searching the menu looking for something to criticize or scoff at, but it was not possible. Truly New American offerings are presented in a thoughtful and coherent manner that keeps with the uniqueness of a place like this. I went with a couple of friends on a Sunday evening and we were in for a real treat. I'll start first by saying that they don't accept reservations for parties under five. I guess it's popular enough, and totally excused based on the quality of the experience I had thereafter. We cleverly arrived around 4:45pm to wait for them to open at 5:00pm, thereby successfully avoiding a wait of any kind. We were promptly seated at 5:00pm and it was all excellent from there. Impressively so, by about 5:15pm, the place was packed and it already appeared that a wait list had materialized.The menu offers a truly impressive variety of simple, but elegant dishes that are sure to please. We started with the sweet potato & goat cheese croquettes and an organic green salad to start, both of which were lovely. I went off on a mini-tangent about how nice it is to see sweet potato used in a more savory approach - Fantastic. We were served a few Yorkshire Puddings instead of bread on the table, which was great - I had the duck meatloaf as my entree, which was presented beautifully on a layer of creamed spinach & celery root, and in a pretty generous portion. Another person in my party had the lamb romaine salad which looked delicious and everyone was really pleased. The wine and beer list is extensive and made to make any native New Yorker proud - All their beers are New York State, and a handful of their wines are too - Mostly Long Island and Finger Lakes. We ordered a very reasonably priced bottle of North Fork wine which was exquisite and I couldn't get over how lovely the presentation of everything was. The restaurant itself is a bright, buttery yellow space that is sun-splashed in the early evening and warmed by dark wood floors, exposed brick and tasteful lighting and candles. The prices are very reasonable for the caliber of a place like this and I was really satisfied above and beyond with everything. Overall, Buttermilk Channel is truly superb and I can give it my highest recommendation.",3,1,5,Justin S.,"New York, NY",862,480,83
5.0,4/6/2009,"I love this restaurant.  I have been here for both dinner and brunch and both were excellent.  Dinner was a bit of a special occasion, and I can't imagine a more perfect dining experience. My partner and I are both ""pescatarian"", but we decided to stick with the vegetarian menu (major bonus for having a veg menu!) we started off with house made pickles and sweet-potato croquettes as ""snacks."" Both were flavorful and the pickles in particular were uniquely fresh tasting. (I should also mention that I ordered a glass of Zinfandel which was delicious and my partner had the oatmeal stout which was served in an enormous glass mug, full to the top!) Next we were sent a squash and ricotta tart as our appetizer. The ricotta was amazingly light and fluffy and the tart was delicate and not too filling. For entrees we had the pasta with pumpkin and black olives and the fennel and white bean stew. My favorite dish of the evening was the pasta. The contrast of the sweet pumpkin and the salty olives was brilliant. The stew was also very good--I loved the kale that accompanied it. For dessert we couldn't resist the apple cider donuts and a glass of late harvest zinfandel. I say the donuts are totally worth it and will transport you back to childhood fair grounds.Now for brunch. I was with a group of 5, so we sampled a lot! We started with bloody mary's that was garnished  with a fresh east coast oyster and we were sent the delicious donuts and coffee cake muffins. Off to a very good start! For the table, we shared pickles, a salad of kale, endive,& hard-boiled egg, a short stack of pancakes, a cheddar waffle,  and apple and fennel soup with bacon. The pancakes were light and fluffy, the waffle savory and hearty. My favorite was the salad which was deliciously salty with anchovy dressing. I also has the egg scramble with house cured lox and a few others had the scramble with mushrooms and goat cheese, and a side of sausage. I loved my eggs which were creamy and salty. The great thing was even though we had a ridiculous amount of food, all the portions were on the small side so it was easy to sample everything. I loved the freshness of the flavors and the quality of the ingredients shone through with every bite. There is an emphasis on local ingredients and that both keeps the costs down and reinforces the casual elegance of the restaurant.

4.0,4/5/2009,"Deliciousness. My friends and I had to wait about an hour for a table, but the food was worth the wait. I ordered the roasted mushroom, spinach, and goat cheese scramble; homemade sausage; and the cheddar waffle. One of my friends ordered the warm coffee cake afterwards for dessert. Personally I feel that the sides and the baked goods were far superior to my main brunch dish. The homemade sausage was terrific -- sweet, a touch of cayenne, and the crispy sage leaves were a wonderful accompaniment to the sausage. The cheddar waffles were perfect. Usually waffles are too soft and soggy, but these were perfectly crisp AND soft. The savoriness of the cheddar (and I think the waffles had some cornmeal as well) and the sweetness of the maple were a great flavor combination. The coffee cake was so good. The scramble was good, but not as good as the sides. The salad wasn't anything more than the usual baby lettuce and spinach leaves and a touch of vinaigrette. The hash brown was very crispy, crunchy, and tasty. Loved it. Will definitely come back here for more.",2,1,1,Elle P.,"Brooklyn, NY",346,870,25

Definitely a five star experience. Between the squash tart, the burger, and the root beer float could be my everyday diet (though I'd be 500 lbs which wouldn't be good for anyone). We've had the sausage sammy (skip), the fried chicken (slightly dry), the deconstructed ravioli with pumpkin or squash (good, but not revolutionary), the whole fish (a tiny bit small).

4.0,3/12/2009,"I listen to Frank Bruni, and I'm not ashamed. In the past, he had led me to some of my now favorite restaurants, and Buttermilk Channel is no exception. After reading his flattering review of B.C. in the Times, I figured it was time to venture beyond Frankie's on Court Street and give it a try. I was impressed. I will return.I love the fact the B.C. gives props to the neighborhood, featuring Caputo's mozzarella and Esposito's sausage on the menu. There is also a general focus on local, sustainable, etc. etc. Imbibed:A house cocktail with champagne and Amaro, sort of an herbal, more serious French 75. A nice aperitif. Local beers...nice selection.Consumed:Maple and Bacon roasted almonds - Addictive, delicious smokiness.House-made pickles - one of the best dill pickles I've ever had, crisp, fresh with a great bite at the end.Daily special of pork cheek schniztel - I was slightly disappointed with my entree which then made me envious of the burger and fried chicken being enjoyed at the table. Thankfully, my husband gave me one of the cheddar cheese waffles on his chicken plate and that made up for the inconsistencies of my dish, The schnitzel was underseasoned, as was the accompanying celery root puree. The pork cheek meat is richer that the chop that normally gets pounded into a schnitzel and thus needs an extra hit of salt and definitely some acid to balance the flavors. This dish was too ""one note"". Pecan Pie Sundae - At the behest of Mr. Bruni, I had to order this dessert. Ridiculous, even if it did put me over the edge. Really, decadent, comforting dessert at it's best. Sweet, salty, and memorable.",2,0,3,Lee T.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,67,0
4.0,3/4/2009,"There's something extra romantic about the idea of opening a restaurant.  Despite the odds being stacked against you, you invest your heart and soul in it anyway.  I love that.  I love the boldness and daring and of it and the core belief that you must have in something.  I like it even more when a restaurant shares that with you; when the owners appear in the front of the house and greet you, check in with you throughout your meal and tell you to come back soon when you're on your way out.  It makes the city less sterile and the world a little warmer and, I think, your meal a little tastier.Buttermilk Channel tonight hit all those marks.  The owner greeted me as I walked in, held the door open for me and welcomed me. My friends who were sipping drinks at the bar because I was 15 minutes late (sorry guys, and screw you F train!) were able to transfer their bar tab to the table.  Too few restaurants do this.  It's classy and should be done everywhere -- you shouldn't have to settle up at a bar six feet away from where you'll eat your dinner.  Two points, Buttermilk.Another two points go to the restaurant for having a separate vegetarian menu.  While a meat eater myself, I always feel for my non-meat eating friends whose dining selections are more a process of elimination than they are a matter of choice.More points go to the place for the ambiance.  It's on the corner of the street so there are lots of paned windows and it's decorated with lots of white and nice light fixtures.  The music was good and jazzy and the overall feel was homey and warm.Now, on to the food!  One of my friends had eaten here before so she told us we *had* to get the sweet potato and goat cheese croquettes and delicata squash tart, with buttermilk ricotta, brown butter and greens.  She did not lead us astray.  Both were amazing. The croquettes were nice and smooth and salty -- the salt was really nice, I thought -- and the sweet potato really came through. They were fantastic.  The squash tart was incredible, especially with the amazing ricotta.  Now if only I could figure out how to make it myself....For entrees we shared the fried chicken with cheddar waffles and a winter slaw and duck meatloaf with creamed spinach and duck jus.  Both were delicious.   The fried chicken batter was crispy and flavorful and the meatloaf was tender and tasty. We closed the evening out with the pecan pie sundae, which was good.... but not spectacular.  Don't get me wrong, pecan pie filling and ice cream are independently great but I just didn't think the two combined were particularly special.  Good, just not special.All in all, I'm a big fan of this place and their menu left me wanting to try a lot more.  Can you say bacon wrapped trout?  Hello!?!  I'll be back.  Big fan.",5,0,4,Katie Z.,"Pelham, NY",95,216,9
4.0,3/2/2009,"Buttermilk Channel filled my inbox last week with reviews and mentions in NY Mag AND The New York Times. Not one to succumb to reviews other than ones from my fellow Yelpers ;), I knew something was going to happen at this place and needed to try it. My friend Jay and I decided to grab brunch this past Sunday as he had a place right across from his apartment that was great. That place HAPPENED to be Buttermilk Channel! They knew the owner and he brought us to the table in the back on the window. This place was packed at 2:30 on a Sunday. I had an itch for breakfast and ordered two biscuits with hollandaise ham and eggs. Jay's bf did the same while he ordered two massive pieces of french toast with sugar and almonds. Add in a complimentary bellini and a bloody and this is a pretty nifty brunch.That said, I want to come back for dinner. (Miriam W /Chantelle K?)

4.0,2/23/2009,"When I got the Tasting Table Newsletter about Buttermilk Channel is looked really great so I checked out the website. I was so excited to see that it was owned by Doug, a former coworker! Then I read the brunch menu - YUM. I ""convinced"" a friend of mine to check it out with me though after she read the menu it didn't take much convincing. We arrived at the restaurant and there was an hour wait. It seemed kind of crazy but I had made the trek from Manhattan so I was going to wait. The restaurant looks wonderful - really simple, but really comfortable - it was a place i would want to just hang out at the bar for the day. My friend and I noticed 2 empty seats at the bar so we decided to have brunch there - it was a great people watching spot and we didn't have to wait at all for our bloody mary's, which by the way were delicious. I ordered the the Star of the Sea which was good, but I didn't taste the cucumber and dill. My friend ordered the Court St which was fantastic, I will get that one next time! We started with the Maple and Bacon Roasted Almonds which were really tasty, though i wouldn't have minded if they were a bit crunchier. As it was my friend's birthday she went all out and ordered the Cheddar Waffles and fried pork chop - Yuuuuuuuuum! Seriously, it was awesome and I can only imagine how much more awesome it would be a cure a hangover. I had the short rib hash (the bartender's favorite, she said she ate it everyday!) and it was tasty, but I felt like there was something missing - just that certain Je ne sais quoi. Overall though everything was really well done and it was such a pleasure to see a successful new restaurant owned by someone I used to work with! I know I said I could spend the day at this restaurant, but to be honest, half of the day would be spend in bathroom and for only good reasons. That bathroom is bangin'!

4.0,2/22/2009,"Buttermilk Channel is on par with Grocery and Good Fork as another destination restaurant in Red Hook/Cobble Hill/Carroll Gardens (ReCoCa?).  In fact, we're lucky to have the stretch around Buttermilk include notable locations like Frankies and South Brooklyn Pizza.Reservations are not taken for parties of 4 or less.  We were informed of a 45 minute wait when we arrived at 8PM.  We were halfway through our first drink at Minibar when the maître de called and let us know that our table would be ready in 10 minutes. Those in line ahead of us decided to eat at the bar. They offer a separate vegetarian menu however we ordered from the main menu.  We started with skewers of mozzarella and basil, which was very good but difficult to split between 4 people, and the sweet potato and goat cheese croquette place, which was fantastic.  For appetizers, we sampled the apple and cauliflower soup, squash and ricotta tarts, and a plate of Rhode Island and Newfoundland oysters.  All were excellent.  The oysters came with an unusual vinegar and orange sauce, as well as some lemon slices.Main dishes included pasta cooked al dente with a sweet potato and pumpkin mash, duck meatloaf, trout and bacon with jonnycakes, and the fish special.  My pasta was fantastic as was the duck meatloaf. Dessert servings were large and better shared.  We ordered the delicious pecan pie which is layered with ice cream in a tall ice cream sundae glass.   Apple donuts were freshly made but a bit dry.  The chocolate bread pudding with orange was awesome. Midway through, the owner Doug came by our table to check on us.  We complemented him on a creative and excellent meal and really lovely setting.  Service by the waitstaff overall was attentive and extremely polite but seemed a little shaky on some minor details, e.g. mixing up who ordered each plate on two of our courses.We ordered a bottle of Claar Cellars cab/merlot blend which was one of the lower-priced bottles on the menu and very good.

5.0,2/15/2009,"""They could've served me brunch in the bathroom, and I would totally have loved it.""Strange, yes, but allow me to explain.  My friends and I arrived at Buttermilk Channel on a sunny Sunday afternoon, at precisely 12:20 pm.  The wait, we were told, for a party of three would be about 15 minutes.  We stepped outside to wait, but almost immediately were called back in.  Apparently, the party before us needed a high-top chair for their baby and the only empty table couldn't accomodate it, so we were seated rather quickly.  [Another note on the wait:  As we had our brunch, I had my back to the front, but my friend noted that the wait was getting considerably longer]The atmosphere was warm; the decor aesthetically pleasing.  Wholesome white walls, exposed brick (with a tiny cow hidden in a little pocket in the wall), hardwood floors, etc.  The whole place had a very New-England-Bed-and-Breakfast feel to it.  Cozy and simple.  Our server, Doug, was a little busy but charming, good-humored, and as attentive as possible.  He came to refill our coffees three times throughout the meal, and when there was a tiny mix-up in the kitchen with one of our plates, he caught the mistake and immediately took care of it.The FOOD!  I ordered the Esposito hot sausage, peppers and onion scramble.  The scrambles ($10) are served in a little bowl on a platter with toast, a hash brown patty, and mixed green salad.  The hot sausage scramble was actually surprisingly spicy (not unbearably, but noticeably).  The hash brown and salad were great - the salad had a very light vinagrette dressing on it.   I also ordered a cheddar waffle on the side ($4) because I read such good things about it on Yelp.  It was.  DELICIOUS.  I very much recommend trying one.My friends ordered the mushroom scramble, the pecan french toast, and a side of the breakfast sausage.  I think the mushroom scramble was fine.  The pecan french toast looked amazing, although the portion was a teensy bit on the smaller side.  I'm not sure how much french toast a person could eat, though.  I'm not much for the sweet breakfast foods.  The breakfast sausage side looked like they were homemade.The entire meal was incredibly affordable.  Brunch comes with a complimentary choice of coffee or tea AND mimosa, bloody mary, or juice.   So for a total of $14 dollars, I had the scramble, a side, coffee (endless), and a mimosa.  It was the perfect brunch.After the meal, I popped into the bathroom.  [Does anyone else think that you can truly gauge a restaurant's merits by the state of its bathroom?]  Um, forgive me if this is a strange recommendation to make, but... I think you should check out the bathroom.  In addition to the usual, there is a white bureau with a silver tray, which bears a pitcher with fresh tulips (gorgeous) and candles.  The entire bathroom is candlelit, and the mixed scent of candles and tulips... *happy sigh*No complaints.  Completely happy.  :)  Enjoy!",2,2,1,Kyu K.,"East Brunswick, NJ",66,195,331

They start the meal with popovers, which probably gave them an unfair advantage--I love popovers.The service was really nice: they called us when our table was ready and the manager came by to check on our meal half way through. They have a friendly vibe, which is a great addition to this side of Carrol Gardens.",1,0,1,karen b.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,17,1
5.0,1/25/2009,"I went here last night with some friends, knowing nothing about this place, and had one of the best meals that I've had in a long time.  The food was uniformly excellent.  We got some of the homemade pickles, the croquettes, and the bacon-wrapped almonds for starters -- all were excellent.  I had the fried chicken and waffles for my entree, and I was very pleased with the tenderness and flavor of the chicken.  My only suggestion would be to improve the balsamic maple syrup that came with the waffle -- I found the flavor to be a little too strong and not sweet enough to complement the chicken and waffles.  (It's hard to improve on a classic, I know.)I cannot rave enough about the pecan sundae that I had for dessert.  It was supremely satisfying and endlessly addicting.  I sampled some of the other desserts at our table, as well (the bread pudding and the coffee float) and found them all to be exceptional.The service was great and the staff all seemed very friendly and welcoming.  I really liked the decor as well -- it's a very warm and comforting atmosphere.I will definitely be returning to Buttermilk Channel.  Even though Carroll Gardens is a bit of a hike from Manhattan, we had such a positive experience that I won't hesitate to make the journey out there again!",0,0,0,John D.,"New York, NY",11,36,2
5.0,1/25/2009,"I've now been to Buttermilk Channel twice and both times I was thoroughly impressed with the food, service and atmosphere.  The second time there was a bit of a wait, so I warmed up with a delicious hot toddie.The goat cheese croquettes are delicious and I really enjoyed the bread thingies (I believe they're called popovers).  The squash tart was also enjoyable, especially paired with the mixed greens, great combo and the cauliflower soup is very rich and tasty.  I was also very pleased with my sweet potato and pumpkin pasta.I'm really glad I forced myself to try dessert, because that pecan pie sundae is phenomenal.  And I highly recommend the coffee soda float.On top of everything, the service is great.  The waitstaff is warm and attentive and the owner even stopped by to check in with us!I will definitely go back to this little gem in Carroll Gardens!",1,0,0,Jen B.,"New York, NY",7,16,0
5.0,1/25/2009,"Went last night. House-made pickles, sweet potato and goat cheese croquettes, maple & bacon roasted almonds (smoky, sweet), grilled kale & endive salad (nice grilled flavor, bit crunchy for me but then again I like my steamed broccoli flaccid), duck meatloaf with creamed spinach and the most perfect onion ring on top - crisp and the onion didn't come out like some big wet noodle after the first bite. Amazing.Sampled from neighbors - ribs, fried chicken, winter pasta. Service - top notch. Will go back.",0,0,0,Homer F.,"New York, NY",18,18,8
4.0,1/22/2009,"A friend suggested we go here for dinner and my first thoughts where:- that name is a turn off- another locavore place? blah!I went for dinner, not super excited. Thankfully, it was really, really, really good. Flavorful and light local fare, and the bacon wrapped trout was so perfectly cooked i could have eaten three portions. The bratwurst was also a hit. The waitstaff were super competent and the kitchen was very accommodating when we asked for a slightly custom order. If I lived closer I would make it a regular place.As for the name - after you hear the story behind the name (look it up on their website) it becomes quite charming, but I wish they'd dropp the ""channel"" part.",1,0,1,maya v.,"NY, NY",12,6,0
5.0,1/12/2009,"A lovely restaurant.  I'd describe it as old New American. They take classics like meatloaf, fried chicken, grilled sausages, creamed spinach, fish, and present it in a way similar to what you'd see at Chestnut on Smith Street or Applewood in Park Slope.The sweet potato/goat cheese croquettes are yummy, as are the home made pickles.  Amazing trout wrapped in bacon, and the broiled chicken looks and smells fabulous (from the table next to us)An impressive wine list with a lot of prize winners from Finger Lake and L.I. wineries.  I'm impressed that they have Herman Weimer Riesling (though not by the glass), though they do have Dr. Frank by the glass, which is good, but not as good as Weimer. A great dessert selection.  The room is pleasant.Mangement:  If you're reading this, I'll up you a star for Weimer by the glass and if you put a curtain by the door during the winter. I was the second table in and every time someone came or left, we got an arctic blast.I'll be back soon.",1,0,0,Matthew P.,"East Stroudsburg, PA",56,280,136
4.0,1/5/2009,"Checked this place over the weekend and the service was amazing.  The food was good, too.  They sure know how to do bacon right!!  The snack of maple almonds with chucks of salty bacon sure hit the sweet/salty combo right.  The sweet potato croquettes were light and good.  The cauliflower and apple soup was also yummy and creamy.  And the greaseless friend chicken with cheddar waffles and an intense maple based sauce were good.For me the desserts were a bit of an afterthought.  Tried the pecan pie sundae, which consisted of a parfait of pecan pie, caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream.  Talk about a toothache - it was way too sweet for me. But then again, isn't pecan pie always too sweet?",0,0,1,Kathy T.,"New York, NY",123,269,6

It far exceeded any expectations I had! The oysters were sweet and lovely, and the steak with bone Marrow (yum!) was DELIC!  Been back a couple times now and the food is good, not mind blowing but it takes time and I have every confidence with a little time they'll perfect everything.The owner (his name escapes me now) is always around. He's chatty and gracious and the rest of the staff is equally as warm and welcoming. The menu is diverse and solid.

I trust her taste and had been curious to try out the restaurant but in and out of town. Tonight, my boyfriend and I were coming back from vacation and had a car so drove over to Buttermilk Channel. Truly awesome. The meal was absolutely delicious - grilled kale and endive salad - yum!, the burger was as my friend said - outstanding - , and the staff and owner made it feel like a place that will not only thrive but will be a staple of excellent food and warmth in the neighborhood.

It was, as the Great ones are, heavily influenced by the company and the timing, but even so...I am a picky fucking eater even when my mind is on other things. And this place is super awesome good. Potato and Goat Cheese croquettes? A MUST!!!! Cheese tasting plate was pretty good if a little towards the pungent side of the spectrum. It had these really good little fruits on it. Mmmm. I had the apple and cranberry mixed green salad, it was good but could have used something more in the dressing which was just lime juice and olive oil. My dining companion had the Kale salad. A MUST!!!! Then, Fried Chicken. A revelation: THIS IS FUCKING DELICIOUS, OH MY FUCKING GOD I CAN'T BELIEVE BOTH HOW GOOD THIS IS AND HOW COMPLETELY AND YET TEMPORARILY HAPPY I AM AT THIS EXACT MOMENT IN MY LIFE.Followed by bread pudding, very good but next time I'll go for the pecan pie sunday. Great drinks, particularly the one with the rum and ginger beer.I plan on going here a ton on many occasions, but it will always be indelibly tied to this one moment.

5.0,12/27/2008,"A couple weeks ago I was in Brooklyn visiting my brother.  On my first day of arrival, a Saturday, my bro suggested we try the Buttermilk Channel for an early dinner as I was very hungry after the flight. It turned out to be one of the best restaurants I've dinned at in a while.  And definitely surpassed all other restaurant experiences I had while visiting New York. It was busy, but since it was still early we were promptly seated and greated by a very warm atmosphere and wait staff.  I found that they had quite a wonderful menu with reasonably priced appetizers and main courses. For appetizers we tried the homemade pickles which were very crisp and delicious as well as the bacon almonds which were coated with sweet and savory heaven.We had the ribs and bacon wrapped trout with johnnycakes and greens, both of which were perfect!  The beers selection was decent as well.The pecan desert was soo fantastic as it was made from real pieces of pecan pie chunks.  I'll surely be going back the next time I'm in the area.",1,0,0,John M.,"Seattle, WA",2,21,0
4.0,12/22/2008,"So the past few days have been drenched in end-of-the-year get togethers with close friends.  As we ALL seem to live in Brooklyn these days, it's just too obvious to go out in and around the boro, right?Okay, so, I'd heard great things about B'milk Channel, through Andrea Strong's blog, and various other sources, so we eagerly anticipated eating here.Meeting our peeps (Chris and Beth) proved to be a bit more difficult than I thought, but maybe led to the discovery of a site for an uber-cool speakeasy (more on that after we open it!).  While waiting, though, the wine list proved worthy (all North American), and the smoked almonds were so fantastically good (bacon and maple syrup) that I didn't mind waiting and could in fact have stayed at the bar forever!Alas, we sat at a cozy corner window table (thought it would be freezing but was in fact warm and, well, cozy).  There's a daily specials menu, and everything seems to generally fall into either the local, seasonal column or the Brooklyn youngster seeking comfort food category.  We deftly split the menu, touching on all aspects.Cauliflower soup, organic greens salad, cheese plates abounded for appetizers.  Short ribs, hake, and duck meatloaf did justice to the kitchen's skills.Desserts included Apple Cider Donuts (Farmer's Market worthy) and brioche bread pudding (great ratio of bread/custard).I will definitely be back, many times.",1,0,1,Alexis K.,"Brooklyn, NY",132,105,7
3.0,12/15/2008,"Beautiful restaurant, friendly staff, if the food catches up it could easily get 5 stars:The newest addition to Carroll Gardens (for now Frankie's up the street just unveiled a new building & everyone is a buzz what may be coming to the hood next).  I really like the thought behind EVERYTHING that has gone into this establishment.  From the name (after the channel of water connecting governors island to BK) to the map on the menu that explains the name, to the bistro style menu - lots of options.  Supporting the local (and I mean very local merchants the italian shop Caputos & the pork store on court street here in carroll gardens) and great lines.  They only take reservations for parties of 5 or more and luckily we were 5 on a Tuesday night however, we had to reschedule or reservation to Friday.  When we arrived they didn't have the reservation on the books however handled it very very well. Comped us drinks until we were seated.  As for the Food it is good - not amazing, not compelling but good.  For a area that has become a foodies dream the food needs to step up a little.  Sweet potato croquettes too fried not enought goat cheese sauce, schnitzel was amazing, fried chicken texture over fried but flavor very good, nimen ranch steak rubbery, warm lamb salad good.We passed on dessert but had a great digestive - the mistletoe; try it you'll love it!",0,0,0,Cara C.,"Brooklyn, NY",26,65,0
4.0,12/12/2008,"When I walked in I was greeted by Buttermilk Channel's owner, Jerry Seinfeld. Sorry, a look alike. He had the teeth, the hair, and the sweater, but since I adore Seinfeld all of this was vrey endearing.He led me to my table while I waited for my two girlfriends to arrive, and even though they were both about a half hour late, I was treated very kindly by my waiter. He had a genuine answer for all of my questions, especially when it came to cocktails.I ended uo getting a hot toddy - excellent but cooled quickly. When my friends finally arrived, we decided on what to order, all the while feeling the warmth of the service and the candles (oh, and the alcohol.) We began with housemade pickles (great - not too sweet,) and sweet potato croquettes with goat cheese dressing. These were like little fried truffles; knowing there'd be more food to come I abstained from going beyond a single ball.Then our real appetizers came. My friend had the cauliflower soup with apple - very good and creamy but too little! I had the endive salad which tasted little like its namesake anchovy dressing, but it made me feel relatively healthy. The winner was the delicata squash tart with ricotta...despite the fact that my friend ordered it, we all devoured it like a pack of hungry wolves. Definitely order it. Entrees were slightly more hit/miss, and very meat heavy. I had the buttermilk fried chicken, which was super crispy and moist, over a cheddar waffle sweetened with powdered sugar. To add to the sweet savory elements, maple balsamic dressing acted as a perfect dip. The buger, topped with onions, cheddar, pickles, and ketchup and mayo, was also really good, but this is coming from someone who has abstained from burgers for years despite her secret love for them. It comes with fries, which I did not try due to my general dislike of them. The ""miss"" of the night was the breaded hake. It came on a really nice kale stew with bacon 'n stuff, but the inside was raw! Too thick to be sashimi. Our waiter was very gracious though, and took it back to get us a new, freshly cooked one. Now, keep in mind that this dinner has been going on for a few hours by now due to our talkative nature. But we finally settled on desserts and got three to share. My favorite was the pecan pie sundae. Really that's all it is: pecan pie with ice cream and whipped cream in a parfait glass. Every bite was a corn syrup feast for the tongue. The carmelized chocolate bread pudding was good, but it was made better by the citrus cream on top. Added an extra dimension. My relatively least favorite was the dish of warm oatmeal raisin cookies. They were great, but not something I'd order when I could easily make them myself. After our dinner had concluded, the owner offered to call a car service to whisk us away to our abodes. We were also told to come back again soon; as you can see the niceness seeps into all the cracks.Another point of interest: if you don't like talking to complete strangers, you will probably feel uncomfortable when not one, not two, but three different people strike up a conversation with you on the line for the bathroom. Not just ""nice restaurant, eh?"" but a deep discussion of the food and ambience. You've been warned, but I personally was charmed. Sure the name is wacky but the food is overall delicious and a real treat. I'll be back.",3,0,0,Liz E.,"Flushing, NY",39,416,228

What are southern expats in this neighborhood supposed to do?So, yes. We were all excited about the fried chicken.We all became even more excited when we learned that they served their fried chicken with a little waffle. Good lord.But let me back up. This is a very attractive restaurant. Somewhat spacious for the hood. Simple but handsome decor. Good sized bar. The front of house person was friendly and accommodating and all that.We started with a few small plates. The bacon: awesome. The sweet potato croquettes: awesome. The local mozzarella with anchovies and balsamic: awesome.For the main courses, I had the duck meatloaf. Delicious. Hearty and warm and flavorful served atop... something that escapes me. I cleaned my plate.My friend had the fried chicken and it *looked* good. Not ""TV Commerical/KFC"" good, but ""Actual chicken that has been fried"" good. It also tasted good. Crunchy skin with some spices. Juicy meat. Yums.The ladies both had some sort of fish - one of which was wrapped in bacon. They both gave thumbs up on those.Dessert? We had a few. I'd gladly come back anytime for the pecan sundae or the donuts. Both were stupid good (and by ""stupid good"" i guess I mean ""crazy good"").Service? The waitstaff was on it. No problems.Only minor complaint... their wine list. I see what they are trying to do (all domestic) but for people who tend to avoid california wines *and* north fork wines it doesn't leave a lot to choose from.

4.0,11/30/2008,"Buttermilk Channel, named after the strip of water between Governors Island and Brooklyn, opened last week in Carroll Gardens.  The atmosphere is clean and minimalistic, yet warm and inviting and is a welcome addition to the otherwise quiet strip of Court Street.  The menu has some classic southern elements to it (baby back ribs & chicken & waffles); however offers some gourmet and inventive twists (head cheese, duck meatloaf & flap steak served with roasted marrow).  The wine list featured mostly US wines, with an emphasis on those made in and around NY state.  The selection was reasonably priced and did have a couple of CA wines, if you are looking for something a little more robust and complex than a Long Island wine can offer.  They also had a nice selection of draft beers which are served in borderline too cold/frosty beer mugs.Maple glazed, salted ""pop-overs"" were brought to the table instead of the perfunctory bread and butter, which was a nice down-home start to the meal.  We began with housemade pickles, spinach ravioli, an endive and kale salad and local oysters on the half shell.  The spinach ravioli were very delicate and subtle-- the pasta itself was nearly translucent.  The endive and kale salad was a favorite of mine.  It was served with homemade croutons and a soft boiled egg in an anchovy dressing.  The anchovy dressing really made the salad.  The only complaint I have is that the kale, which I believe is a lacinato (or black) kale, was not de-ribbed, and while the leaves are tender enough to be eaten raw, the ribs are too fibrous for the likes of most people.  The oysters (we ordered Malpec and Welfleet) were delicious and very fresh tasting and were served not only with lemon and cocktail sauce, but also with a kimchi type accompaniment. For entrees, the highlight of the meal was the fried chicken with waffles and winter vegetable slaw.  While the cheddar waffles themselves were not better than good, the fried chicken was tremendously moist and cooked perfectly.  The hake with wild mushrooms, bacon wrapped trout and hamburger were also very nice.We skipped dessert, however next time I will save room for their root beer float-- because when is the last time you have seen that on a menu?The service was surprising strong, considering the restaurant opened less than a week ago.  While all of the waitstaff was not completely comfortable describing every menu item, service was friendly and efficient. Price-wise, with tip, we ended up spending about $50 per person.  A little more than we would normally spend in this area; however we did not mind, as the food, service and atmosphere were a little better than most places the neighborhood.",3,0,2,Rachel D.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,0
