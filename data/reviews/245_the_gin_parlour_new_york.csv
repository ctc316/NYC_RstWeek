3.0,11/9/2018,"Gin gin gin.  You will find it at Gin Parlour because they have virtually all the gin in the world.  The drinks here are a bit pricey but the pours are quite generous and it probably includes the classy setting of the Intercontinental Barclay (a classic NYC hotel where the bar is located).  In case you want to catch a game, the bar also has a large screen tucked away in the back.  I would have given Gin Parlour a 4.5 star rating but the table service was pretty bad.  We had to ask for our check threes time and waited 10 mins to order our first drink.   Also, Gin Parlour (by its name) has a limited selection on other types of spirits and beers.",0,0,0,Hank W.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,152,880

3.0,10/15/2018,"I desperately needed a martini a la Blake Lively in, ""A Simple Favor"" and as such found a place that's known for their gin selection. The bar is right in the lobby of the Intercontinental. It's good, but it'll cost you...my one martini was $25. Pro tip: gratuity is included!",0,0,1,Alison D.,"Dallas, TX",103,176,77
1.0,9/12/2018,"Nope -  not great, not even good.  Located inside the Intercontinental Hotel Barclay, the Gin Parlour charges 15% gratuity on all sales,  plus a city occupancy tax of 5.875%.  Doesn't matter if you are staying in the hotel or not.  Literally thousands of bars and restaurants in Manhattan to go get a great gin  Martini without tacking on service charges and extortion fees.  Oddly enough, the Gin Parlour doesn't know how to make a dry martini - at least they couldn't make me one!   Generally speaking, when places force you to pay a specific 'gratuity charge', the service usually suffers.  The service at the Gin Parlour was not worth 15%.   Zero desire to ever go back - a total rip off.",2,0,0,Eric H.,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA",425,404,112
2.0,8/16/2018,"By all accounts online, it seems like it would be a nice hotel restaurant. In reality, it's an extension to the hotel lobby where you can order food and drink that is done decently, and costs an absurd amount. Service is nice, and it's not a bad spot if you want to find a quiet nook to have conversations you don't want shared readily.",1,0,0,Joan H.,"New York, NY",213,485,3

3.0,7/9/2018,"Nice hotel lounge - it is not intimate and removed. The Gin Parlour is open access and you can sit and watch all the comings and goings in the hotel lobby. They REALLY DO have hundreds of premium gin!  Our bartender let us sample several before we committed. We found a few new gins we will definitely purchase in the future. However, one word of advice, get an itemized bill. The tip is included on the bill and we only received the totaled receipt to sign. If we had not asked for the itemized receipt we would of double tipped the bartender.... perhaps that was his intent?",2,1,1,Rob H.,"Norfolk, VA",135,591,336
4.0,4/29/2018,"I'd been meaning to pop in here for a bit, as it's a cool-looking hotel bar near my office. I finally came for drinks with a coworker one day. It was nice that it wasn't too crowded even during happy hour hours, and we found a cozy seat in the back. The crowd was super interesting--some of them must have been dressed for a formal event that evening, and many were older, but the effect was that it seemed there were people from different eras, which only added to the ambience, since the menu groups drinks by time period. We tried a few different drinks, one of which came in a giant hemingway mug, but the classic gin & tonic was the only one that was really amazing. And it WAS amazing (the others were too sweet and weird). It's pricey, but if you love a gin & tonic and want a little hideaway from the bustle, come by!",0,0,0,Mari K.,"West Hartford, CT",245,585,2028
5.0,3/16/2018,"This hotel bar is a five-star gin joint if you're a guest at the Intercontinental Barclay. The food and drinks are enough to allow you to stay in the hotel on a winter day or night and not feel like you're missing out on the cuisine and craft cocktail scenes of Manhattan. I'd suggest it's closer to four stars for others, since the pricing is hotel-appropriate. Or even three stars if you're looking for a bar with a scene, or maybe one not full of tourists from around the world anyway. Love that the design is themed around recreating the ambiance of a classic Park Avenue home. It's simple, but elegant great drink list, themed by eras from Silent Film to Post War to Disco! The wine list is pretty good. But not a ""wow"" for someone visiting from Northern California.Gin Parlour offers the same menu for lunch and dinner. One friend enjoyed the Chopped Fattoush Salad, which is made with lentils instead of chick peas. Another loved her Roasted Organic Chicken Cobb Salad. I was surprised by the quality of the truly excellent Green Pulse Salad. I added grilled chicken, which danced with the harmonious cast of organic greens, toasted red quinoa, chickpeas, sprouted black lentils, feta and sunflower seeds dressed with a bright but subtle lemon thyme vinaigrette. As alluded to above, I stayed at the hotel during a wintery stretch and enjoyed a few meal here. The Cubano Sandwich was pretty good. An actual thick slice pork shoulder, but with Swiss cheese oddly enough. I had great expectations for my last meal here. The Fried Chicken Sandwich delighted my friend, so I saved it in anticipation of the glory I imagined. Really, kimchi buttermilk-brined chicken delighted my imagination. However, it arrived at my table slightly overcooked. The savory salty chicken was engineered to contrast with the sweet pickles, but it landed just short of the runway. Anti-climactic, sure. But there was a last-minute save by the New York Cheesecake. Yum. Well done.",4,1,5,Ted R.,"Oakland, CA",1032,682,630
1.0,2/4/2018,"Had a long flight and was exhausted. Got to hotel and was too tired to eat elsewhere and contemplated for two hours on whether to pay a lot for food downstairs or call an uber. I decided I'll go downstairs to Gin Parlour. Bar tender was nice and made a great drink. Nuts were good. Then I ordered the herb 1/2 chicken which wasn't much of a price difference from Upstairs menu (was trying to be cheap). But I ordered anyway. But when it came out the peas were still hard and the chicken was dry and small. I thought to myself, 'if this is organic why is it dry and tasteless?' They do pride themselves of local ingredients and fresh but this plate was bad. I sent it back. Second try, same problem. I tried my best to like it and enjoy it but it was damn hard! So I sent it back. Restless I ordered a cheeseburger...how can you go wrong with that? I took it up to my room and started to eat it...it was small, vegetables were old like it was cut days ago and the it had no seasoning!! I had to mask my burger with the quarter cut of pickle they gave me and sauce! And it was a $28 burger! So pissed.",1,0,0,Chasity R.,"Tahlequah, OK",3,62,87

5.0,12/18/2017,"Located in the lobby of the Intercontinental Barclay I'm not usually a fan of hotel bars. Overpriced and usually mediocre, usually in my opinion best go looking elsewhere.  The Gin Parlour is definitely an exception to that rule.The bar is located across the lobby from the reception desk and is spacious and welcoming for hotel guests and yes even those who have sought out this gin joint. The menu boasts two whole pages of different gins from around the world. In addition, signature cocktails, wine and beer, and an assortment of other liquors to enjoy. We had a Manhattan and Gentleman Caller, I would pass on the gentleman caller and try something else next time.  Th Manhattan was awesome, as was the old fashioned.  Be warned the cocktails are all super potent, although with a 15-20 price tag they should be! Also the bar nuts must be dipped in some seasoning from high above, they are without a doubt can't miss! The only complaint I have here is that they seem to be short staffed but otherwise competent, professional, and super friendly!

3.0,8/4/2017,This is the lobby restaurant inside the Intercontinental Hotel. I came for restaurant week based on the menu I saw on the Restaurant week website. When I got there the menu was different. The food is nicely presented. The apps were really good. Calamari and the Sausage delicious  The Skate entree was ok. It was slightly over seasoned. The Pork Lion was so so. It came with crackling that was so old it was like chewing leather. The deserts werenok. The sorbet was very tasty. The service was hit and miss. It took forever just to get bread and despite a empty restaurant it took a while to get food.,1,0,0,david l.,"Brooklyn, NY",70,441,1255

A wide selection of gin from all over the world, a friendly and knowledgeable bartender to talk to you about each gin and cocktail, and an innovative cocktail program using a lot of homemade ingredients.$18 is steep even for NYC prices, however both cocktails I had were fine. The Singapore Sling was well balanced and not too sweet. The Hong Kong Soda? was very tasty with homemade Szechuan  peppercorn cola, yuzu, and a gin from Asia.  The bartender had some great recommendations for cool cocktail bars around the city.

3.0,4/9/2017,"A hidden gem in midtown. I'm surprised that this place doesn't have more reviews! I really liked the theme: cocktails, whether new or classic, made with gin as the base spirit. Try a new twist on traditional gin drinks, like the G&T, Singapore Sling, or Gimlet. Better yet, try a whiskey cocktail, such as the Manhattan, with gin substituted for your usual bourbon or rye. Why not?If I'd only tried the incredible gin old fashioned (Two James Old Cockney Gin, Cocktail & Sons Spiced Demerera Syrup, House Made Bitters) I'd definitely have given Gin Parlour four stars. This concoction allowed the complexities of the gin to shine, and the syrup added just the right amount of sweetness. As a lover of old fashioneds, I really appreciated this cocktail.The rest of the drinks I tried ranged from quite good to meh to kind of horrible. The other drink that I actually ordered rather than just tasted was the Midtown Apothecary (Uncle Val's Peppered Gin, Yellow Chartreuse, Solerno Blood Orange Liqueur, Lime). It was tasty and refreshing and mostly tasted like slightly peppery Chartreuse. You'd think that with so many interested ingredients, the cocktail would be a little more complex. For $18 (expensive even by New York standards), I was a little underwhelmed.The worst drink of the night was the Forget Me Not (Bitter Truth Pink Gin, Beet Juice, St. Elizabeth Allspice Dram, Lemon). This tasted like a beet smoothie you'd get at a juice stand for $3. The balance was all off.Other drinks that I sampled from friends' orders included the Quintessential G&T (too sweet, fell a bit flat); the Madhubala (Opihr Spiced Gin, Coconut Washed Manzanilla Sherry, Honey-Sumac Syrup, Mango Chutney; I liked this one); and the William Bradford Gimlet (Plymouth Gin, Cranberry, Blueberry, House Made Spiced Lime Cordial). The service was on point. Our friendly waiter was quick to refill our delicious complimentary truffle popcorn and bowls of nuts, upon request. By the end of the night, he got that we were super hungry but were not about to buy dinner, so he brought up some house-cooked potato chips, gratis. The place is super classy, too. This is definitely a good midtown spot, especially for fans of gin and swanky atmospheres. If you're looking for the best-tasting cocktail you've ever had, though, TGP might not *quite* hit that spot.",4,0,0,Laura O.,"Manhattan, NY",341,548,34

5.0,7/19/2016,"The Gin Parlor is inside of the newly renovated, very lux, Intercontinental hotel. Don't be deceived, this is no regular hotel lobby bar!The head bartender Jose treated us to a unique educational introduction to the world of gin.  We learned about the history of gin, the different types, where they're made and then tasted a few of the classic gin cocktails.  We started with the Quintessential G&T (that's gin and tonic) which was carefully prepared with a variety of fresh fruit and a house made tonic that is carbonated on the spot. It was finished with a juniper leaf attached to the glass so that one inhales the scent while imbibing. It was phenomenal. Next we had a drink I'd never heard of (and I'm pretty lushy so that takes some doing!). The Martinez is a gin cocktail made with Old Tom gin (this is a class of gin, not a brand name). Old Tom gin is aged, as exemplified by its rich brown color, and it's richer and sweeter than London dry gin (i.e. It's not Seagrams) the Martinez was different, tasty, and strong. Even the bar snacks were exceptional. We nibbled on roasted spiced nuts and what I believe was a truffled popcorn. I wish they'd bag and sell that popcorn!All in all it was more fun and a better experience than any hotel bar I've enjoyed in the US.  Highly recommend! And if you see Jose, tell him Jami from Florida said hi!",4,2,2,Jami M.,"Orlando, FL",42,87,198
