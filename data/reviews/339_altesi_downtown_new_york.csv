5.0,3/31/2019,While shopping around my daughter and I decided to stop here for a bite to eat. We ordered chicken parm and calamari which was all soooo good as it was fresh and seasoned well. Might I add that the staff was nice.,0,0,0,Lynnie J.,"Fort Greene, Brooklyn, NY",1,24,8

2.0,3/10/2019,"Went there for the brunch and was very disappointed to find that they didn't use real chicken in their menu (picture attached). Hard to imagine that a restaurant with so many positive reviews served food like this...Even Wendy's serves real chicken, not an imitation chicken patty like these guys used. Definitely a big turn off for this place and disgusting to be honest...We also did the bottomless brunch drinks and the mimosas were mostly orange juice. There are a lot of other good options in the area that I would choose over this one.",0,0,0,Sean M.,"Huntington, NY",0,12,5
5.0,3/1/2019,"So much menu, so little time.  Our visit to Altesi was a little early, so the place was pretty empty. Fine by me!  Such nice decor - the wine wall is awesome - and I love the modern pops of orange.  They have this super tasty spicy oil that I drizzled on everything, and I mean, everything!  The bread basket got oil, the pizza got oil, the meatballs got oil.  I didn't stick around for dessert, but I might have taken it that far.",1,1,1,Adriana P.,"Sayville, NY",70,61,175
5.0,2/27/2019,"I came to this restaurant when I was really hungry, and I left completely satisfied.To start, the bread is amazing. The crust is perfectly crisp while keeping the center soft and chewy, so already, my meal was off to a great start.I ate the squid ink tagliolini with shrimp and a spicy tomato sauce. The noodles were cooked perfectly and everything tasted great. It wasn't too spicy, but had just enough of a kick. Definitely going back next time!",0,0,0,Philip S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",753,166,257
4.0,12/27/2018,"My husband and I went here for dinner on Christmas Eve. The food, wine and ambiance were all great. However I'm giving 4 stars because we felt the service was a little rushed. And I know it sounds funny bc most people complain about slow service but in this case it was rushed. The wait staff barely let us finish what we were saying before walking away and I barely swallowed my last bite of entree before the dessert was brought out. Especially on a nice occasion such as Christmas Eve  it's nice to take your time. Again, though the food, wine and ambiance were all great   And the Tartufo I had for dessert was delicious but just something to consider as far as the rushed service.",0,0,0,Erica R.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,17,0
3.0,12/25/2018,"My family went to Altesi Downtown for Christmas Eve this year, and it was exactly what we were looking for. Comfortable seating, affordable menu, great service, and most importantly - didn't break the bank (which can be very hard to find in Soho). Everyone at the table (with the exception of one), decided to go with the fixed priced menu ($46) for Christmas Eve which included one appetizer, one entree, and dessert. I got the Fried Calamari to start, which was great. Cooked perfectly, and the sauce was different from traditional italian restaurants - tangy and a little bit spicy. Highly recommended! My brother got Caesar salad which looked pretty standard, and my mom got Mozzarella and Tomatoes, which were creamy and fresh.After the great round of appetizers, I had high expectations for the entree . I ordered lamb shank after seeing many positive reviews on yelp about lamb at Altesi. It was disappointing. It looked good, but was 80% bone and the little bit of meat was fatty and tasteless. My dad agreed, but what can you expect for a $46 fixed price menu! My mom got the chicken which seemed a little better. My brother that didn't do the fixed price ordered Tagliatelle con ragu di Agnello, which is pasta, lamb shank ragu and fresh ricotta cheese. The portion was smaller than other italian restaurants in the area, but he was happy with it. My dad and I were still hungry from the minuscule portion on the lamb, so we ordered a margarita pizza. It came out and it was much smaller than expected (if we knew, we would have ordered two!) but it was very good. Thin crust pizza, perfectly made, crispy and delicious. Dessert was next, and it was excellent. Everyone else got Tartufo, I ordered the sponge cake with fruit and both were delicious. I don't drink, but everyone else ordered wine and felt the prices were reasonable. I saw a lot of other Yelp reviews commenting that the wine pours were skimpy, but they served the wine in carafes and it looked like a pretty standard glass to me.Overall, the waiters were friendly and great, and they didn't rush us at all (important when with family). All the food was acceptable, and it didn't break the bank. I will gladly return to Altesi Downtown. I think next time I'll try the non-fixed price menu, order more pizza, and - if it's better - revise the star rating on this review higher.",0,0,0,Chris B.,"New York, NY",110,61,237
4.0,12/17/2018,"On a rainy Sunday afternoon while my family ate at a different restaurant, I roamed the Soho neighborhood in search of pasta with a patio so that I could eat with my dog. We were in NYC from Boston with a 13 yo and a dog. Every time I come to New York, I have a hankering for handmade pasta, made beautifully. I usually don't factor whether the restaurant is dog-friendly but that was my condition last Sunday. I happened upon Altesi because it was the only restaurant with a large awning and seats outside that would accommodate my puppy. I was practically the only person in the restaurant. I wasn't that hungry and I had been walking for some time but most restaurants in the area with outdoor seating were either awkwardly situated or did not look that appetizing (seating by the entry way, jazz band playing right next to the table etc). Boy what a pleasant surprise to eat the simple but beautifully executed pappardelle with mushrooms.Perfectly cooked pappardelle noodles bathed in a pecorino sauce. Was there cream, wine? I couldn't tell but it was delicious.Whoever cooked this little dish cared about the way it was executed. It will remain one of the most perfect pasta dishes I have enjoyed, and I have eaten a lot of pasta. Cheaper than Cipriani in the neighborhood, lovely decor and great service. My dog was largely ignored by the wait staff but I could care less because the pasta was perfect. I will be back! Thank you Altesi for making my sad little walk in Soho a meal that I will never forget.",0,0,0,Mimi W.,"Arlington, MA",0,48,1
5.0,11/9/2018,"Highly recommend the fettuccini with truffle and green peas. Buttery and just creamy enough without an overpowering truffle flavor. Reasonably priced too, at $21. The focaccia they serve with pasta was also perfectly baked and seasoned. Tried the black tagliolini squid ink pasta and it was DELICIOUS. Other notable item menus that I will try when I come back are the Lamb Ragu and the Papardelle. Can't wait to come back!",0,0,0,Joanna K.,"Evanston, IL",230,16,0
3.0,11/8/2018,"This place is pretty disappointing. Service was good and the noodles were well done but the sauces were seriously lacking. The Alfredo sauce was way too rich and didn't have any seasoning beyond the cheese. Similarly the lamb pasta had lamb that was too dry and the sauce had no complexities to the flavor. This place gets a 3 because it had a nice ambiance and good set, but for the price, the food only gets 2 stars.",0,0,0,Linda H.,"Portland, OR",0,26,0
4.0,10/3/2018,My friend and I popped in here for a late lunch on Sunday and were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. I got the endive and pear salad and it was fully chopped and had a really nice fresh taste. I also started off with the grilled octopus appetizer which was delicious. The salad was definitely not enough as a meal so I would recommend getting an appetizer to round it out. My friend got the avocado toast with poached egg brunch special and she said it was delicious. That was served with a side salad. This restaurant has a nice sidewalk area with tables and was perfect for an outside meal since the weather was great.,0,0,0,Katrina W.,"Princeton, NJ",3,43,15
5.0,9/18/2018,"I had a delicious lunch here. The cacio e pepe was so good, and this is a dish that is easy to mess up.

Delicious.",0,0,0,Ali S.,"Alexandria, VA",4,8,0
2.0,8/3/2018,"Very average food. Got the pappardelle - tasteless. A friend got the the black spaghetti. The pasta was over cooked and the sauce was average at best. The server was annoying.

5.0,7/21/2018,Highly recommend this gem in SoHo! I had lunch there and the menu was great and very reasonably priced. I got the Tagliolini Neri con Gamberi and it was INCREDIBLE. They make all of their own pasta and really know how to flavor it. I can't wait until I'm back in town so I can eat here again!,0,0,0,Ashley C.,"Los Angeles, CA",158,14,13
2.0,7/9/2018,Ordered takeout from them last night.  Two meatballs $16 a very small serving of fried calamari $16.  Very expensive for food that was just ok.  Never again.  I gave it two stars only because the men who worked there were so so nice.,0,0,0,Sandra F.,"Ramsey, NJ",0,18,0
5.0,6/20/2018,"I had such a terrific brunch at Altesi starting from the moment we entered to the moment we left. The decor is so inviting, modern and fresh it was as if it's calling my name. (I also love orange). My friend and I were starving and ordered most of the menu but the highlights were definitely the carbonara which had delicious pieces of bacon in it, the tartare, and of course the tiramisu. When I took a bite of the tartare I was suprised as there was this crisp sweet taste. I realized it was apples and boy did it compliment the dish. It was absolute perfection.The service was wonderful, everybody was so happy to be there. The pricing was also so reasonable compared to some other place I've been to. I would love to go back for dinner sometime but definitely recommend them for brunch all day ereeeday.",5,4,5,Rebecca A.,"Brooklyn, NY",649,275,2445
3.0,6/13/2018,"My husband and I came here last night for dinner before hitting a comedy club in the Village. The service was good, albeit a bit slow towards the end of our meal even though the restaurant was quiet. As a very picky Italian I'd say the pasta was just ok and no better, it might hit the spot for most people. The calamari were tasty but I found the wine pours to be on the skimpy side unfortunately. I think there are definitely better places to spend $130 on a dinner for two.",0,0,0,Amy Z.,"San Francisco, CA",74,8,0

5.0,2/27/2018,"Lovely Italian restaurant in Soho, everything is delicious here, starting from the pasta to their thin pizza. I love thin crust, because it makes pizza ""light"" without giving up on the taste. I recommend this place also for brunch on the weekend, great eggs benedict with salmon.

2.0,2/12/2018,"Came here for Restaurant Week since it had so many good reviews but unfortunately I didn't have a great experience. The waiter kept insisting on giving me and my husband a happy hour menu even though it was over. My husband asked for a cocktail list but the waiter said ""they have liquor and could make him whatever he wanted"" (?!). He wasn't being rude or anything, he was actually very friendly. We think he was just not knowledgeable enough... For the main, we both had the tagliatelle which was way too bland. For dessert I had the creme caramel which also lacked flavor. With so many great places in the city, I don't think I'll be coming back. Sorry!",0,0,0,T T.,"Manhattan, NY",9,44,7

4.0,2/6/2018,"Stopped in during restaurant week and definitely ate everything that we could get our hands on! We ordered from the prefix menu for RW, and everything we tried was delicious. Two of us started with the tartar - they used a mix of avocado, cucumber, and green apple and it was a delightful surprise. Our third friend went with the meatballs which were amazing. For the main entree, one went with the lamb shank: enormous and fall off the bone delicious, and two of us went with the papardelle which was equally amazing. We tried all three listed dessert options, two bottles of wine, and definitely the complimentary bread - which you will want to order more of. All in all the service was on the slower side but we definitely enjoyed the food.",2,2,2,Courtney W.,"Washington, DC",281,434,201

4.0,12/21/2017,We went there with my mom 2 weeks ago. Reservation made just couple hours before going there and it was pretty easy. We ordered bottle of wine Chianti as server suggested. We had for started lobster and asparagus salad and fried mozzarella and for main we had grilled octopus from starter section and pasta with sun dried tomatoes and artichoke. Everything was very good food wise but after coming home I realized I was charged more for octopus plater( I honestly did t know that there were octopus app and octopus platter) but I did point to server from app sides it's not a huge difference but I just feel like it was not fair. But also my fault that I didn't look at the bill right away(I never do usually trust to server). Still was a good meal just know next time I need to make sure what I'm getting and what I'm paying for.,0,0,0,Anastasia E.,"New York, NY",5,48,7
4.0,11/19/2017,"We were starving and looking for good pizza on a cold, rainy Saturday night.  All our known places were packed so we took a chance on Altesi.  It looked a bit nicer than we were dressed for but they had open tables and pizza....win-win.  The pizza is outstanding!  While we were waiting for our food they brought over a basket of pizza crust brushed with olive oil and spices and cut into bits.  We could have eaten 10 of them.  So good! The only negative was we ended up spending a lot more than we had intended to when we set out for pizza, but I'm glad we did.  I'd do it again.",0,0,0,Bobbi B.,"Glen Allen, VA",0,4,1
5.0,11/17/2017,delicious... great service. Bread in the bag with a house made hummus. Yummmmm. I got the four cheese pizza in there pizza oven and it was amazing.  The calamari and aioli was divine.

4.0,11/9/2017,"I'm not sure why this place was so desolate on a Sunday evening, given the food and service demand a sizable crowd. No matter though - it's the rest of the island's loss and our gain! I loved my squid ink pasta with a blend of clams, mussels and shrimp topped with an incredible spicy red sauce. The name of the wine we had escapes me currently (probably because it was written in Italian) but it was the 2nd from the top in a half bottle (school night, ya know?). I imagine they don't change their wine list all that often given the options were presented in a pretty impressive leather-bound binder. The lasagna was also pretty perfect - seemed like they replaced some of the traditional lasagna pasta with a thinner, flakier layer of something that made a wonderful difference. The generous topping of Parmesan cheese the waiter sprinkled on top wasn't bad either.  The meal ended beautifully with a chocolate soufflé and a side of pistachio gelato - SO good! I didn't think the paper napkins or cardboard place mat really fit with the rest of the meal, but other than that I loved everything about this experience. Would do again.",0,0,0,Anne-Marie B.,"Katy, TX",193,263,158
4.0,10/11/2017,Came here for dinner with a few friends because a colleague had recommended the food as being very authentic Italian.  He was right!  The meal started off with a delicious basket of free fresh out of the oven pizza like bread and homemade white bean dip.  I could have eaten the entire basket of bread by itself except I had to save room for my entree.  For my main meal I had the black pasta with seafood and spicy tomato sauce which was very tasty.  The portion was very generous compared to many other Italian restaurants in the neighborhood so I was stuffed by the end.Will definitely come back for seconds.,1,0,0,Lucy M.,"Brooklyn, NY",79,234,46

It's so new, we weren't sure why it was so empty. The staff was extremely accommodating and generous. Overall, no one dish stood out to me as the best I've ever had. The fried artichoke hearts were delicious, we went through three orders.

3.0,9/16/2017,"We stumbled upon this restaurant and immediately fell in love with the vibe of it. The space is great. It's open and airy and the seats were so comfortable. We started off the meal with bread and white bean dip. The dip was phenomenal. We ordered two bellinis but got two violas instead. Small mistake but the drinks were great so we kept them. We then ordered mussels, the endive salad, and the chicken pesto pizza. Everything was pretty okay. Nothing really stood out other than the dip. The service was terrible though. The waiter seemed lost and didn't know anything about the menu. He got the order wrong a few times. The bartender continued to disappear, so we ended up waiting triple the time.

4.0,9/4/2017,"Great place to sit and enjoy a wonderful long weekend brunch outside with my lovely wife. From pasta to pizza and brunch with a twist of the Italian flavors, you can't go wrong with any dishes that Altesi presents. Their pizza comes in a long board and shaped more oval than circular. Not to mention a fresh sunny side egg on top for the missing Italian flare. No matter what you put on the pizza from truffle oil to prosciutto, you will taste that these slices are made with fresh tomatoes and mozzarella. Delicious wood oven cooked pies and heated with just the right temperature to crisp the dough but not ruin the flavors with burnt edges. A must try for anyone who is a fan of pizza.",2,0,0,Louis N.,"New York, NY",375,218,459
