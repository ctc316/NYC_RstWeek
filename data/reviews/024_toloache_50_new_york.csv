3.0,4/24/2019,"I have tried many different mexican restaurants before. The dishes in this restaurant is extremely small. For example, I ordered guacamole as entrée. It was a very small bowl. I was so surprised. For a cheaper price, I had a bowl 3 times more guacamole as I have eaten here. Though, the quality of the food was ok. As the main food, I ordered tortilla soup and enchiladas borrachas. I liked the main dish. But again the quantity of the tortilla soup was very little. I had also trouble getting the attention of the waiter for some services.",0,0,0,Amir F.,"Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada",13,11,163
4.0,4/23/2019,"When we visited NYC a few weeks ago to see Dear Evan Hansen on Broadway, we wanted to find a good Mexican restaurant for our pre-theater dinner. Thanks to all the positive Yelp reviews, we ended up making a 5:30 reservation for my family of four, and were seated right away once we arrived. The restaurant is large, with two floors, and is well decorated. Our table was upstairs near the wall, and seemed a bit quieter for having conversation. The waiter was patient about us needing some extra time to peruse the menus, and he made sure to explain several of the dishes, and answer our questions regarding portion size. We started off with the trio of guac for $27 which turned out to be addictive, and was great for all of our spice levels. My older daughter and I loved the fruitiness of the medium one, while my younger daughter preferred the milder type, and my hubby liked and devoured all three of them, including the hot one. As for drinks, we ordered a couple of glasses of blueberry hibiscus on the rocks, and OMG, were they ever tasty! Sweet and strong! For our meals, my younger daughter chose the manchego cheese, corn, black truffle, and crema quesadilla for $17, and my older daughter ordered the los tacos with suckling pig, cactus salad, salsa verde, and queso fresco for $15. I went with the yellow fin tuna ceviche with soy, sesame, avocado, cilantro, and Thai basil for $16, and my hubby settled on the los tacos with Bohemia braised brisket with avocado, red onion, salsa, and horse radish crema for $15. The flavors were all complex, but sadly,  the portion size was real disappointing, especially when factoring in the cost per dish.... Prices are ridiculously high for what you get. To be honest, by the time our show started at 8, I was actually ready for another full dinner. I know the menu states that the los tacos are appetizer size, but who would think that the quesadilla would ever be so small! Even my tuna ceviche was tiny for just one person. We probably won't be back.... It's hard to justify a tab for almost $150 with tip, and feel hungry soon thereafter. In fact, within 30 minutes of finishing our meals, my older daughter and I stopped for drinks at Starbucks. I ended up treating myself to a vente size mocha java chip frap to round out the dinner, and later got a slice of pizza to hit the spot before bed. 4 stars for quality and taste of food, 5 stars for the restaurant's atmosphere and the service we received, but 3 stars for value.",0,0,0,Janet R.,"Brookline, MA",1,87,5
5.0,4/23/2019,My experience at this restaurant was truly amazing. Our server Sharon took the time to go over the menu with me. As vegetarian it's imperative to find options that are delicious and filling. She paid attention to detail like none other! Definitely will return and try some new things. It's difficult to find authentic Mexican food with vegetarian options!! So I'm so happy to have found this place.

4.0,4/12/2019,"Since my husband and I had limited time to eat dinner between part one and two of Harry Potter, we made reservations at the this nearby Mexican restaurant, which was recommended on the Harry Potter website. The restaurant has a vegetarian menu upon request, with many different options. As a gluten-free vegan, I was told I could only get the quinoa paella main course and the spicy kale side. I was expecting to be able to get tacos with gluten-free corn tortillas, so I was slightly disappointed by my meager options. I was also told I could get the black beans, but not the rice. Luckily, the quinoa paella and spicy kale were absolutely delicious. The quinoa included generous amounts of asparagus, carrots, baby corn, mushrooms, and cauliflower, and was topped with shaved truffle. The combination of flavors and textures was delicous. The spicy kale was in a super spicy light broth that I found scrumptious. I also got a side of guacamole, which was was creamy yet still had avocado chunks in it (which is my favorite texture of guacamole). I savored every bite of my meal and fully enjoyed it. My husband opted for the cheese quesadilla, which was more of a tostada, because it was so small. The two women sitting next to us also got quesadillas and their entire conversation consisted of them discussing the tiny portion and what a real quesadilla should look like. (The tables are very close together and we could hear every word.) My husband enjoyed it, but could not get over how tiny it was. His side of avocado fries, which were crusted with panko bread crumbs, were very generous in size, though. I always find it hilarious in restaurants when the sizes are bigger than the entrees. I definitely recommend Tolache if you are ever in need of a good veg-friendly restaurant in the Broadway district. If you are vegetarian, rather than vegan and gluten-free, the vegetarian menu is quite generous.",1,0,0,Cait M.,"Willow Grove, PA",5,38,66

Excellent decor and lots of buzz for a weeknight.Started off with a Frozen Margarita ($13), which was slushy and excellent. for food, had the Pollo Toloache ($25) - a marinated chicken breast swimming in sauce and served alongside pico de gallo and other accompaniments. Meat is moist and the other parts of the dish didn't take away from the chicken at all.

It was a huge group of us that showed up before our reservation on a busy Sunday but the manager accommodated us right away! Not only that but they also accommodated extra people that ended up joining us later! Really appreciate their efforts to make us comfortable and feel welcome! We all ordered different cocktails and every single one of them was delicious and did not skimp on the alcohol! My favorite was coconut mojito! But honestly, all cocktails were such a joy to drink! For food we all ordered different kinds of tacos and guacamole! And every last bit of them were delicious! We cleared all the plates effortlessly!

2.0,3/20/2019,"Been coming here for years but it seems to have fallen off. The host stand was very disorganized, made us wait for no reason. Finally seated us at a very loud table so we moved. The way this place is set-up it gets very very loud and everyone is cramped. The food is good but overpriced even by NYC standards. Charging $2 for a tiny side of sour cream is just nickel and diming your customers. This also used to be a nice place with a good crowd but on this visit the clientele also has gone downhill. People constantly on cellphones, flashes going off, shining lights everywhere, chewing gum, being excessively loud, etc. just not a respectful or respectable crowd anymore. Won't return.",0,0,0,E.

All I have to say is that by the end of dinner she was raving about how amazing the food was and we had alot of it. We ordered guacamole, kale, corn, shrimp tacos, pork belly tacos, quesadillas, plantains, margaritas, ice cream and cake. I will definitely be back! Do be aware that our food was like $200 between the 3 of us, but it's New York! That's actually alot cheaper than most places. Plus I had 2-3 glass of wine myself alone.

5.0,2/27/2019,Everything I had from here was of top quality. And the taste was excellent. Gaucamole seems to be a very popular item here. I went with the frutas option. Gaucamole was very fresh. It had fresh pomegranate and mango in it. Combination of gaucamole and fruits is very good. Salsa which came with it was also really fresh. I am pretty sure they made it there. Chips was good too. Breakfast burrito had excellent flavors. If you go for brunch I highly recommend this item. I also went for chapulines which is nothing but grasshopper taco. Grasshoppers were fried crispy. The taste is very different from a regular taco. It has some grass kind of a flavor to it is what I felt. For a first timer you may not like it much. Overall this is an excellent restaurant.

The tacos are true street tacos (2) With little to no meat at $15-18. It's not your street tacos that some may know and love from Mexico streets.Honestly, my wife travel around d world and come to New York twice a year but relied on previous reviews and generally are spot on but this place fell extremely short.

Y'all know that post-broadway show feeling of really craving some guacamole after seeing incredible talent on stage and convincing yourself that drowning in guacamole will help you convince yourself that you're completely fine with your lack of talent compared to those you just witnessed. This place did just that! The guacamole was so fresh and delicious and the chicken enchilada didn't disappoint either. The enchilada was a littlllleeeee too lost in the sauce, but hey, we've all been there. I would've preferred a little less sauce but I went with it and it was still sooooo good. I also got their margarita with peaches in it and it really helped me cope with my inability to tap dance after witnessing those who had to have been the best tap dancers in the country. All in all, cool vibe. It is pretty pricey and dark in there, but definitely would return on a day where I'm feeling bougie. Happy to say this place cured my talentless sorrows.

5.0,2/3/2019,"Great find in the theater district, but get a reservation or hope you're lucky and land a bar seat (like we did!).Cool vibe and despite the bustle everything felt very authentic. The place is pricey for what you get, but that's normal for this area. Food came out quick and we had plenty of time to make our 8p show.We shared a bunch of stuff, here's the skinny:Margaritas - sitting at the bar we HAD to, and they were good. I like a traditional margarita but they have some more exotic options if you like to step out.Guacamole - do it. Delicious and made to order. My partner doesn't like spicy but you have mild, medium, and hot options - I'll try the hot next time. Salsa isn't chunky, it's more of a sauce, but still tasty.Tacos - we got the squash tacos and chicken tacos. They're all size so not gonna be more than a snack for most. The squash tacos had some heat but not too much, tons of flavor. Chicken tacos were great, chicken was slightly crisp and cubes small, and lots of meat for the size of the taco.Quesadilla - this is unique. It's more like a flatbread. It's very good, but definitely not what you're expecting. Picky eaters may want to stay away, but I suggest being adventurous here!Plantains - delicious, cut thinner than most places, and pair surprisingly well with the chipotle ketchup the give with it.Rice and Beans - same as any other place, they're served in individual bowls, and could probably feed a table of 4. We couldn't finish them!",0,0,0,Chase P.,"Marietta, GA",162,52,42
3.0,2/3/2019,"I came with a family of 8 people for the first time. It's great for groups. There's a ton of space, with two floors. I suggest reserving though. It's right by Broadway shows, so expect a show crowd during the evening hours. The service was pretty good, and our waiters were friendly and attentive. As for food and pricing, not the best bet on Mexican food in town. It's expensive for what it is, but I'm not surprised considering the neighborhood. The food was very average.Most of the group had the Carne Asada, and some had the tacos. My bf had the Pollo Toloache. We all  shared the trio of guacamole (mild, medium, and spicy). The guacamole was okay, but I couldn't honestly taste the difference between them. The spicy wasn't spicy at all. The mild was on a slightly sweeter side. The chips and salsa were great. As for the main entrees, one guest asked for medium rare, and it came out too rare. Another guest also had a miscooked steak. They enjoyed their food otherwise, and the chef was accommodating in recooking the med-rare steak. I wasn't super hungry, so I decided on the pescado (fluke) tacos, at an overpriced $16 for 2 tacos, plus a side of rice and beans. The tacos are definitely more an appetizer. It wasn't the most picturesque looking set of tacos. The tacos were dry and pretty bland, so I put the remaining salsa from the table on it. The fish had no flavor and the toppings, which included guacamole, were much too skimpy. I felt my tacos were reheated in a microwave or oven versus cooked fresh off the grill, which is likely the case since the entire plate plus the lime was warm. Seriously, this can't fool me. The rice was a bit dry, and the beans were just fine. I tried some of the Pollo Toloache, and I thought the chicken was really bland. Overall, I felt flavor was missing in everything. I also wasn't keen on how pricy their tacos were considering the flavor and portions.If I return, I'd consider other dishes. Alot of dishes I tried lacked flavor and had inconsistency in cooking. For the pricing as well, a bit more was expected. I don't recommend the pescado tacos at all. As for having a group meal, it's a good choice considering the amount of space. It's also right by Broadway theatres, so it's a legitimate option after shows. Otherwise, I would skip.",7,3,5,Sara L.,"Manhattan, NY",721,552,3545

1.0,1/28/2019,"Yikes. What happened. I came here two years ago with a friend and had such a great experience, with good food and great service. Came back last night with a small group and it was a complete disaster. Let's start off in the beginning... The waiter took forever to come to the table to ask for drink orders. He asked if the table wanted still or sparkling water-- at most restaurants in NYC, that usually means the still or sparkling is tap water and it's on the house (or they'd specify otherwise). The table said we'd like both since people were split, and they proceeded to take the water glasses off the table and walk off, so we had no idea whether they heard us or what we were going to expect. We then get a bottle of $8 pelligrino for the table, and before we can say anything about NOT wanting a bottle of pelligrino and were fine with tap, they run off before we can put in drink orders. Another 10-15 minutes go by, we order drinks and regular water. It takes another 10-15 minutes before we get drink orders and the person bringing the drinks has no idea who ordered what. The margaritas were terrible. I have no idea what's changed but either the flavors were unbalanced or they used some kind of artificial flavoring. Rosa Mexicana has significantly better margs. We then order food after having to flag the waiter multiple times. Same thing happens. The food takes forever (45+ minutes after we ordered), the whole thing is a mess with them not knowing who ordered what and not letting us just tell them (my friend tried to let the waiter know that he ordered the steak and the server told him to wait while he was trying to sort it out... what, why, we just told you?). Two people ordered carne asade and the food wasn't cooked properly (example we ordered medium and got medium rare... and the other ""medium"" was overcooked and incredibly tough). It's also strange that a steak comes with herbed mashed potatoes.. what happened to regular rice and beans? My friend asked if tacos came with cheese. Waiter said yes. We then proceed to get charged for ""extra cheese"" ($2.50 btw). The food was lukewarm and the enchiladas that came with the steak were just a giant lump of solid cheese because they had gone cold. The tacos are $16 for two tiny tacos (they are not kidding about appetizer sizes). When we tried to order a second round of drinks, the waiter brought an extra margarita. I told him I did not order an extra drink. He then says well if you didn't order it, we're going to get rid of it, so do you want it? I said well sure if you're just going to toss it, of course I'll take it. And then he proceeds to charge me and gave me an attitude when I asked for it to be removed from the check. My friend ordered off the restaurant week menu. He was supposed to get dessert. The waiter forgot and had to be reminded. We asked at the end if we could do split checks since everyone ordered different things (entrees, sides, multiple dishes, drinks, etc). The waiter refused and said to just figure it out ourselves and let him know, which, naturally was a mess. It's easier for us to tell you what we ordered and for you to run separate checks than to have us figure it out individually, including calculating taxes etc. The waiter would have benefited from giving us separate checks... if you're asking us to calculate tax and tip ourselves, you're not going to have a happy group of customers and you're not going to get tipped as well, in my experience. Plus it would've taken him two minutes and it took us 15 minutes to try to break it out individually for him.  $30 carne asade... $14 guac... $16 margaritas... $16 for two tacos... for those high prices, i expect MUCH much better service and quality. You need to tell customers when you are charging them for random things. It's ridiculous. I also don't understand why dinner took over 2 hours... the restaurant was 1/3 empty on a Sunday evening. Not planning to come back again. The food and service are not worth the price. Go to Rosa Mexicana or Cascabel and don't waste your time here.",2,2,2,Stef S.,"San Francisco, CA",132,779,6

For my main, I had the suadero tacos, which is their brisket tacos, and it was absolutely divine! Easily some of the best tacos I've ever had. The rice and beans that accompany their taco dishes s a generous portion size and leaves you feeling satisfied.Pro tip: get the guacamole trio as an appetizer --- three different styles that are all equally amazing.

We glanced at the menu and decided to both get quesadillas. They were about $15 dollars each. When they came out, we were so surprised at how small they were! We almost decided to order seconds. Lol. Although small, my shrimp quesadilla, which also had pineapples on it, was DELICIOUS! My friend enjoyed her chicken quesadilla as well. Since we were still hungry, we ordered desserts, which were good as well. The entrees were a little expensive, but with what we paid for the small quesadillas, a drink, and a dessert, we might as well have ordered the entree and been satisfied.",1,0,1,Candra S.,"SAINT ALBANS, NY",63,93,156
5.0,10/18/2018,"This former Michelin Star restaurant is no joke. Authentic as you can get to eating a meal in the heart of Mexico, the food is on point and not a single dish was a disappointment.Upon entering the restaurant, there was already a line out the door. I guess that's how good the restaurant was. When I finally was able to step through the threshold, every table was taken, including the bar area. I got on the waitlist for 2 and went to a nearby bar before they phoned us that a table was ready for us.Service was one of the best qualities they have. The waiter was super helpful with menu choices and suggestions. Overall very professional. When one of us got up to use the bathroom, they came over and folded our napkins and placed it back in proper position.The food exceeds my expectations. Starting off with the guacamole, we got the frutas ~ medium which was made with avocado, pomegranate, vidalia onion, mango, apple, habanero, and thai basil. It came with chips and some kind of other sauce which was quite interesting. This alone went for $14.I got two tacos: Pollo and JM Pescado. These went for $14 and $15 respectively. The one comment I have to make about these tacos is that these are the soft shell wrap you find in Mexico when you order tacos. This is what makes these tacos 100% authentic as most other places serve you hard shell tacos which is Americanized via Taco Bell or it's those bleached white tortilla wrapping.We got two sides: rice and beans and cactus fries. The cactus fries are legit from cactus plant, also my first time having cactus. They also have dried grasshoppers if you really want something authentic, but I digress. The rice and beans I would share between at least two people as they really fill you up.To end the dining experience, we got their signature churros which came with cajeta and chocolate dipping sauces. Talk about feeding your sweet tooth.Overall, I ate too much. My wallet took a beating, but it was all worth it as the experience, service, and quality of the food were exceptional. I would recommend making a reservation if you're coming in with a party as this place collects the foot traffic from being in the theater district and previously awarded Michelin Stars.",6,4,7,Jacky C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",171,360,205

A bit of a long walk from Times Square where I was staying but so worth it! It was about 5:30 on a Saturday night but we got seated relatively quickly. The hostess was a bit rude when we came in not even acknowledging us until we stood right in front of her trying to get her attention for about 2 minutes so that's why I'm docking a star. However, after we were seated our waitress and maybe an owner or manager that was walking around were absolutely delightful! The food was DELICIOUS and the ambiance was perfect.

My parents are notoriously picky when we go out to eat (they expect to be wowed by food if they're paying for it lol) and they really liked this place. Stand out items include their spicy guacamole and the veggie enchiladas. Most menu items have a vegetarian option or can be made vegetarian if you ask.

We were quickly seated, with no attitude when we asked if we could sit at a less busy part of the upstairs room. The restaurant's appearance was very clean and classy, far different in presentation and decor than the Mexican restaurants we frequent down south.The menu had a fairly decent amount of options, and we all were able to find something that sounded good to us. We couldn't have prepared for just how great the food was! We let our waiter know that we had to be next door at the Gershwin in less than an hour, and he made sure the food came quickly for us. The timing didn't affect quality nor presentation! My Grandmother and her best friend raved over their dishes, though I'm unsure of what they ordered.

But didn't stop me from eating it (avocado, tomato, red onion, & chipotle queso fresco).**Upon further review of photos, I think they gave us 2 tradicional guacamoles, instead of the Rojo - one of us told the waitstaff that he was GF.  So probably not spicy for good reason.I ordered the Toloache Margarita, which was fresh, delicious, and not too sweet!  Hint of blueberries, subtly tequila-ey. YUM. For lunch my sister and I split tacos, we had Pollo and the Carne Asada.  The chicken was nice and had a good spice on them - the Manchego cheese was sharp and delicious.  The Carne Asada was good with a delicious heat and fantastic tequila salsa - the queso was subtle and added a nice creaminess with the  heat.  Two tacos per order makes it the perfect sharing dish.  The tortillas were corn and fabulous - the rice and beans were authentically perfect - creamy beans and flavorful rice, you can't go wrong there.Check it out - definitely order the guacamole.  And at least one margarita!",17,7,11,Robin G.,"Princeton, NJ",1226,381,2328

After letting the Mgr and host know of our challenges with one of our party they moved heaven and earth to move tables so our party was accommodated downstairs with easy seating. The mgr was fantastic as were the staff. They truly capture the meaning on customer service. Drinks were taken-chips and very good guacamole was served followed by an assortment of very good and well prepared dishes. As a bonus we had two orders of warm Cherros with chocolate sauce which everyone enjoyed. Service service service topped off by the very attentive server Jessie provided a great experience for 10 people comprised of sisters-niece-nephew-friends all who enjoyed themselves. This place made sure to go the extra mile to insure a great night.Irwin Z,0,0,0,Irwin Z.,"Chatsworth, Los Angeles, CA",0,133,6

4.0,5/21/2018,"The BF's dad + girlfriend were in town for the weekend and we had tickets to see Wicked. They had left the restaurant choices to me. A quick search for delicious restaurants in the area led me to Toloache 50. I made reservations via OpenTable about a month in advance, since I knew the location was very popular with the pre-theater crowd. Even a month in advance, my options were either 5:30 or 7:00 - the latter was cutting it close to our show time. I realized a week before our reservation why timing was so scarce - it was Cinco de Mayo! I had inadvertently picked a Mexican restaurant for dinner right smack on May 5th. Go figure. We arrived a little before 5:30pm and had a tiny bit of a wait. We were then escorted upstairs to a table for 4. We ordered guacamole and chips and drinks to start. The guac was so good! I ended up with an open-faced quesadilla and BF had the ceviche. BF's dad and girlfriend both got a fried cricket taco. I tried one. It was ok. I'm not sure I would order it on my own. Dessert of churros and a crepe cake were both OK - nothing special to write home about. Service was quick and food came out pretty quickly as well. We ended up being super early since dinner was so fast. Good tip for others looking for a quick pre-theater dinner, they can get you in and out within an hour - even during Cinco de Mayo!",4,0,2,Michelle T.,"New York, NY",369,1165,1125

Well... the texture is probably more like .... biting down on a really soft nut, like a cashew? Something like that, but really good.

If only the prices were as low as back home, I would have one less reason for missing the west coast! I ordered the beef burrito with chips and salsa; the burrito was a little small but packed a lot of flavor and texture; the insides were quite tender and marinated really well. They give more chips than one person should eat alone, although I wish that also came with more salsa. All in all, a good Mexican place in the east coast!",0,0,0,Eric K.,"New York, NY",639,101,162
3.0,5/10/2018,"Toloache is another average Mexican restaurant in the Times Square area. It has it's moments but it's not anything special. The food is good, but the prices are kind of high for something like that. It gets love for not being a chain. That might make me  come back some time. It has a street burrito. It's about $8, which is kind of high because it isn't that big. The burrito was packed with vegetables. Based on the taste of the food alone, I say it's good but I've have food that good before. The service was a little slow. It wasn't exactly busy, but there were a few other customers. The food came eventually, and then it was finished. A good think before going here is knowing how busy they are. If you need faster food, they have a location on Broadway.

4.0,5/10/2018,"Recently went here for lunch with a group from work. Given it's Times Square-adjacent location I didn't have the highest expectations, however  Toloache is pretty solid!They have a pretty broad menu at Toloache both in terms of food and drinks. It was hard to decide - everything sounded so good! I had some soft of a watermelon and tequila drink. It was really refreshing and tasty. A bit expensive considering a fair amount of the glass was taken up by chunks of watermelon, but I wasn't paying so I didn't mind. For food we shared the trio of guac and all three were so good. The spicy one was probably my favorite and for anyone who isn't a fan of heat, it was subtle. For my entree I had a trio of ceviches. Each was unique, well balanced, fresh and flavorful. I would absolutely order this again if I returned.If you're looking for a delicious meal near Times Square, Toloache is a great bet. It's a little pricey, but that's to be expected for the area. The food and drinks are awesome though.",0,0,0,Liane C.,"Brooklyn, NY",188,70,7
4.0,5/9/2018,"You have to grade midtown/theater district restaurants on a curve. Compared to other parts of New York, you typically pay a lot more for what you get. What you want is a good, consistent, delicious meal that doesn't leave you feeling like you've been caugh in a tourist trap.Toloache 50 has been one of our theater district mainstays for years. It has a neighborhood feel, a highly consistent and creative kitchen, and a wonderful menu providing a wide range of delicious options from complex entrees in the $30-$35 range down to simpler tacos, salads, ceviches, and simpler nibbles for the budget and calorie-conscious.

3.0,5/6/2018,"We really needed an excuse to celebrate cinco de mayo and enjoy some Mexican cuisine in the city, so I snagged 3:30 reservations at Toloache. When we arrived at 3:30 there were approximately 3 parties ahead of us. By the time we were seated we had waited 15 minutes.As many reviewers commented the tables are TIGHT! The table itself had to be pulled out to get in and out of the booth seat. There was only about two inches between the tables on each side of us. We also agreed with the reviews that the restaurant is loud! We get it, it's cinco de mayo and it's a restaurant in the theater district but the noise isn't enjoyable, it's just loud patrons. We were hoping for some live music or something festive. Nothing of the sorts. The food was delicious. To start we had traditional guacamole and chips and salsa. Perfect! We both ordered tacos, one order of carne asada tacos and one order of lobster tacos. People's complaint of small portions is valid. The menu says ""appetizer portion"" and there really are just two small tacos for $19 (lobster). But delicious? Yes! We also ordered a side of Brussels sprouts and rice and beans. All delicious. Service was efficient and friendly. Would we return? Maybe? I just don't know if the space and the prices are worth it.",3,1,1,Jerrod B.,"Stamford, CT",157,84,164

It wasn't spicy at all, but had a nice flavor to it. The Margaritas are reallyyyy good, but they're expensive (luckily, I was on the company dime and this was a work lunch). The quesadilla caught me by surprise because I didn't know it was going to be an ""open-faced"" quesadilla. They should probably make that more clear, but luckily it was still very delicious so I didn't mind that it wasn't exactly what I thought I was ordering.

I'm just saying that as someone who has grown accustomed to average Mexican in NYC. The guac here is good, but where the wheels fell off is pricing and a CARDINAL SIN that was ruining carnitas. It's so simple, it's just pulled pork. I mean, I appreciate it's hard to do well. But to mess up, you kind of have to try. They came in chunks, which I've never seen, but that's fine. What's not fine is including gelatinous flaps of rubberized skin, and chunks of cartilage that popped when I chewed. Nothing that you charge $25 for should ever pop when you chew. Maybe if it was less, I'd be alright with an occasional pop. But for $25, to have a pop in every bite? One star.",3,0,0,Zack G.,"TRABUCO CANYON, CA",0,5,0

4.0,4/27/2018,"I'm giving Toloache 50 four stars because I think it is a really great restaurant in an area dominated by tacky chains and overpriced restaurants targeting tourists. Although it doesn't look like much from the outside your opinion will change once you step inside. The restaurant is split level, always vibing, always full and managed by lovely staff. They definitely pack the tables in there and a reservation is a must, it is constantly busy.As others have said the portions at this restaurant err on the smaller side for the price. At places like Dos Caminos or Fonda you will definitely get more bang for your buck. However for the area it is pretty good value. The tacos are on the smaller side (2 per serve) but are padded out by the rice and beans. I think the enchiladas are a decent size.When I went for lunch today we ordered mild guac, vegetarian enchiladas (me), chicken enchiladas (my dining companion), a side of rice and beans and two cocktails each. The mild guac was tasty, of course way too many chips and not enough guac (isn't that always the case?). I would have ordered a medium spiced one but that comes with pomegranate etc and we weren't sure we wanted to complicate it. The enchiladas were really tasty and a good size, I had to box up most of them. The rice and beans were good but I probably prefer the ones at Fonda - these ones were less creamy/blended. For cocktails I tried the grilled pineapple/jalapeno mezcalita and the mango/tamarind one.  The first one was definitely dominated by jalapeno and the latter by mango. All in all very good drinks, boozy enough and not too sweet.With the exception of one fairly apathetic female sever all the other staff were lovely, friendly and attentive. Fortunately we were not stuck with this server as everyone jumps in to give a hand, run food and check on you. We even spoke to a manager who was really friendly.A few other thoughts:#1 -  going to the restroom is a bit of an ordeal if it is busy (and you happen to be sitting downstairs). You need to push past everyone milling in the doorway to get up the stairs, walk through a bunch of tables on the next level and then gather to wait for one bathroom. I guess there isn't much they can do about that because the space is quite crowded/utilized to maximum capacity.#2 - I wish they served the poquito picante cocktail here that they serve at Toloache Thomson (damn that is such a good drink).#3 - As it gets very crowded the place gets noisy. And as above...a reservation is a must.All in all I have nothing but warm feelings towards this restaurant. I think the food/experience is good and I'd be happy to return at any time.",0,1,2,Cri C.,"New York, NY",283,238,1702

We had a reservations so we, luckily, didn't have to wait long. The food is out of this world. I ordered the shrimp quesadilla. It wasn't the traditional quesadilla that you think of with a tortilla stuffed with meat and cheese. It was a homemade tortilla baked like a tostada. It was crispy. The ingredients were served on top like a pizza. It was fantastic. I also had the ceviche which was also different that what I've had before. We had the pulpo. It was served warm on a tostada. They also had fabulous margaritas. Im picky about my margaritas. I usually don't think them out because I don't like margarita mix but you could tell these were very fresh and not too sweet.

5.0,3/23/2018,"I've always wondered what it would be like to attend a fine dining Mexican food restaurant. Well, now I know, and I will never be the same after eating this awesome food.First off, let's talk guacamole. Guacamole and me are never far apart from each other, and here, at Toloache, they serve three different kinds of guacamole (my heart). I loved all three of them, but the most interesting and most delicious was the pomegranate guacamole. Refreshing, light, and full of flavor, you have to try this, and I guarantee you will never have one like it again. Second, if you're in the mood for a summer-y drink, ask for the watermelon lemonade. Not too sweet, and the flavor is so nice. Third, one word, TACOS. I don't think I've every had more delicious tacos in my life. I opted for the Lobster tacos, which were so delicious, and I was shocked at how well the corn tortillas stayed together. Usually I'm not a fan of corn, but these were really something else. Finally, MEXICAN HOT COCOA. If it's a cold day, I would highly recommend trying some. It's a very unique flavor.

It's a big, bi-level space with a nice ambiance-- I would imagine this could be a fun pre-theater stop.Restaurant Week was still on but we weren't feeling hungry enough for a full three courses. Do note they also have a separate vegetarian menu, which I liked. I went for the quesadilla with huitlacoche and truffle ($17), while my coworker had the quinoa paella ($22).It came out about 20 minutes later or so. The quesadilla didn't impress me much. I liked that it had actual truffle shavings on it, as well as a generous bloop of huitlacoche cream, but it was concentrated in the center of the slices. It otherwise tasted like a standard open-faced cheese quesadilla, studded with corn. Rice and beans were nothing special. The portion was good for me, but I'm not a big eater, so I would recommend splitting some guac or something first. My coworker's looked good, but also looked on the small side given the price. Service was quick and efficient. I liked the atmosphere. I think the menu has some promising things on it, and it's a bargain given the location.

While their sides were good, the main was only ok... $12 for two small azz tacos when you can get bigger and better ones for $3 elsewhere in NYC?? Insane.

My sangria was delicious but it was overly strong. Which I personally appreciated, since I wasn't trying to get hammered. I had the Toloache chicken. The chicken itself was a little bland. But combining it with corn sauce it came with it made a huge difference and added some spice to it. The flavor from the sauce with the bland chicken really worked together. I also had the corn on the cob which came with a chipotle mayo on it. I think the corn on the cob and the guac were the best things on the table. This kind of leads me to categorize this place as a place for appetizers and drinks. Not so much for a place to have a fantastic dinner. The ambiance is very cool.

Do not get me wrong, the tacos were decent, but the price point is a little high for two mini tacos. The pricing could be due to the restaurant Times Square/Theater District location, as things tend to be a little pricey in the touristy areas. I have eaten more flavorful tacos at ""lower tiered"" restaurants in the city, aka taco trucks. I did not care for the cactus fries. My dislike probably was due to me being adventurous and trying something new; rather than the restaurant's method of preparation. Perhaps, the entrees are the way to go at this place. The service was very exceptional, our server really explained the menu's specials to us and he pretty much was on top of everything.

2.0,10/9/2017,"As a long time, devoted fan of Coppelia, I was eager to give Toloache 50 a try when posed with the challenge of finding a decent restaurant in this area of Midtown. While I recognized straight off the bat that the prices were meant for unsuspecting tourists, I was still down to shell out a LITTLE extra dough if the flavor and quality was right. Ultimately, the price tag is just not worth the experience. While the chilaquiles I ordered did taste authentic and flavorful, and the skirt steak was cooked nicely at medium rare, I also paid an insane $22 for them. If you break it down to the ingredients required to make Chilaquiles, there is just NO reason for them to cost this much. Maybe if the portion size was just a little bit more generous. The most expensive part of the dish was the 5 slices of skirt steak, so you basically pay $22 for 15 tortilla chips and some skirt steak. Crazy. You can find equally good chilaquiles in New York for half the price - so GO DO THAT. I also ordered a side of sweet plantains, which again, were decently executed, but overall nothing to write home about. I've had better, and the $9 price tag is totally absurd!! Plantains cost next to nothing and are not complicated to prepare. In summary, only go to Toloache if you are, like me, desperately in need of somewhere to go in this part of town and are low on options. Otherwise, save yourself a boat load of cash and go to one of the many other delicious Mexican restaurants in this city.",0,0,0,Micole R.,"Manhattan, NY",1,21,5

We had to start with a guacamole because, well, who is not a guac fan! We tried the fruit guacamole which had mangoes, chillies and pomegranate. It was quite unique and flavorful!We ordered the mushroom & cactus tacos, truffle quesadilla, fish tacos and chicken quesadilla. Now, the food was in general not very flavorful, being a mexican place- reason being, its right in the middle of times square and thus, is super tourist oriented & thus quite bland. The portions were quite small too! I have never left a mexican place hungry until here. The tacos had 2 corn tortillas and a portion of rice and beans. I wanted maybe 1 more taco to feel full. The quesadilla was quite small in size too!The service was friendly and the waitstaff answered all questions about the menu (which had a lot of names in espanol).So well, we have decided to only eat burgers (maybe shake shack & the counter) when in times square :)",2,2,1,Garima K.,"Jersey City, NJ",159,138,150

You can't beat the service - everyone there is super nice and helpful.  Only drawbacks: you may end up sitting really close to other patrons because the place is busy, the food is on the expensive side, the atmosphere is fun and lively so if you are looking for a quiet dinner this place is not for you.",0,0,0,Jimmy S.,"West Palm Beach, FL",545,13,1

Like, close enough to pick off your neighbors plate. I thought we were done with the cramming elbow to elbow thing?The guacamole gave this place its extra star - 3 types available, and the classic is guac at its creamy and tasty best.

We then got the ceviche, which was surprisingly in taquitos. They were okay, but my boyfriend loved them. We also got two tacos, which I really wanted, but I would have actually been okay without. Definitely the most 'meh' of the night. We shared the lechon dish--I've had loads of lechon in PR and while you can't beat fresh lechon off the spit, this was a nice spin off of it.

After about an hour we finally got to sit down.      I was very pleased with my experience at Tolache. This was one of the best upscale Mexican restaurants I have been to in a long time. In part what made it great was the service. They were gracious and hospital. Each dish was creative and unique. Especially the elote (corn on the cobb.)

The meat is quite tender and the accompanying chipotle salsa, avocado, onions and cilantro very well balanced. However, I felt like I barely had enough sauce to fully experience the taco and the ""entree"" itself was two tiny ones - it should be called an appetizer! I take little bites, but I finished both tacos in four bites (two per). The dish came out with rice and beans to constitute an entree, but I wish the kitchen served another taco sans the rice and beans.

1.0,4/4/2017,"Cheapest entree is $22. You have to pay extra for chips and salsa.  Rice and beans are also considered a side and you have to pay extra for them. They will also try to scare you into buying bottled water(""would you like bottled water......or tap water...."" said the waiter ominously).  Horrible return service, we got suckered into buying the stale chips and asked twice if we could have more salsa but no one returned with more salsa before our check came.  Food is gimmicky and sub par, lots of sauce on enchiladas that resembles more of a thick tomato soup than any sort of enchilada sauce.  Margarita was sad and weak, more of a margarita slushy in a small glass.  We were looking for a reasonable and popular NYC Mexican restaurant and got stuck with a $70 bill for 2 enchiladas and a side of chips and salsa at this joke of a place.  If this place is a 4 star Mexican restaurant than I've lost all respect for New Yorkers.",0,0,0,Jonathan B.,"Maple Valley, WA",3,4,2
1.0,4/3/2017,"Very disappointed in this restaurant from the moment we sat down. Our table for two felt cramped and unusually close to the neighborhjmg table. Although the couple next to us were not especially loud, we couldn't help but hear every word of their conversation. Not the intimate conversational atmosphere we expected from a high  priced Mexican restaurantUpon greeting us, our server asked if we would like tap water or sparkling. This immediately raised concerns about the water quality. Sorry, but a resaurant that charges $20-30 per entree should serve safe, good-tasting filtered water, instead of putting their customers on the spot and uneasy as soon as they are seated.The food was not anything spectacular and if you want chips or sides you have to order and pay separately for them. The entrees did not come with rice and beans or anything else, so esssentially everything is a la cart. We ordered the chips and salsa. Chips were not tasty at all. They were a little dry and stale and had an overcooked/burned taste.  The amount of salsa served was skimpy and not enough for the amount of chips brought out. When we requested more, it never came.We ordered vegetarian enchiladas and chicken enchiladas for our entrees. They were fine, nothing spectacular, certainly not worth $20-$26. It would cost an additional $6 to add rice and beans. Don't come here if you are hungry.Overall the service was sub-standard. The server who took our order never returned to check and make sure we were satisfied or needed anything. Different employees brought the food out and cleared our table.

They have a huge selection of drinks and the servers are equipped with the knowledge to recommend you something that you'll definitely love. After getting a peligrosa, my friend and I asked for a recommendation and the server made us our very own special cocktail which was delicious!I'm not a super big fan of tacos but really enjoyed the ones we had here. We weren't super hungry so we decided to just go with the Los Tacos appetizer size (two tacos per plate). I ordered the costilla & tuetano (beef short rib & bone marrow) and it was so great! The server made sure to let us know that it's a cult favorite. The sauce was so savory and complimented the tender ribs. I also had the pescado (baja-styled fluke) which was pretty good but not as great as the other.The service here is great and the bartenders and servers were amazing and attentive.

3.0,3/14/2017,"The service at Toloache trumped everything, everyone was so amazing and accommodating. We were in the mood for Mexican food, so we checked Open Table. They were booked, but since we were close by, we decided to stop by and press our luck. They told us we were good for a table and motioned us to the dining room upstairs. The place was packed. The dark interior, the loud chatter of the diners going to or coming from shows, and the candles on the tables all added to the vibrant atmosphere. We took our seats, ordered our margaritas and appetizer and looked over the rest of the menu. I had the prickly pear margarita...the bright, purple color matched the intensity of the flavor...so good and strong! We also munched on the guacamole sampler. There were 2 types of guac and their salsa. Both guacamole bowls were good, one was a traditional, the other had a spicy kick to it. What really blew me away was their salsa. A nice smooth blend of what tasted like roasted tomatoes and spices. I could have just had this and I would have been good. For my entree, I ordered a bowl of quinoa with a variety of roasted veggies on top. The quinoa was cooked perfectly, as were the veggies (carrots, asparagus, mini corn, etc.)Normally I would not go to Toloache if I had the option of any Mexican restaurant at my fingertips. The food was good, but nothing memorable. The prices are high for what you get. When you go to Toloache, it's for the location and the atmosphere. Like I said at the beginning, the service was great, and that's what would definitely lead me back through the doors if I went again. Being in Hell's Kitchen close to all the theaters, it will be packed on a nightly basis, so I recommend that you make a reservation.

I have to say that she was right.   We definitely had enough time for a great dinner(not rushed) with time to spare.  When we arrived at the restaurant, we gave our name for our reservation, and they led us to our table immediately.  Our Waiter was fast, efficient and the food was very good!  Definitely recommend it.We all  loved the food and desserts and I loved my margarita!",0,0,0,Barbara B.,"Palm City, FL",15,27,0

As vegetarians, our menu options were limited, but what we did have was pretty good. I had the truffle and huitlacoche quesadilla, which was really tasty! I loved how the corn and the cheese went together, and that funky huitlacoche, which I had never heard of, let alone are, before was earthy and delicious. It was definitely the best part of the meal, so I highly recommend those. My dad got enchiladas, and I tried them, but I didn't like all the vegetable stuff going on there. The guacamole was interesting, but expensive. The desert was good (chocolate cake) but relatively standard. I wanna try the churro dessert if I come back!

The hostess (I want to say manager or owner or something; she was more than merely a hostess) had to turn a couple parties away, as they had no reservation and she was fully booked!  I appreciated how they asked us if we had a show to get to (we did), so as to let the servers know.  Food was good, though I would've appreciated the spicy guacamole being spicy.  It was flavorful, but lacked the heat I really wanted.  All the dishes on the table were prepared well, with interesting flavors.

1.0,1/2/2017,"Two words: FOOD POISONING. Felt straight out of the scene from bridesmaids. We are in town from Miami and decided to give this place a shot. My not so wise boyfriend ordered the grasshopper tacos ($15 for 2..) and guacamole and chips ($15 uhh..) for myself since I wasn't too hungry. Guacamole and chips was great and boyfriend seemed thrilled with the taste of insects (gross) so we deemed it a success. An hour later on the subway I thought I was gonna pass out from the frantic desire to find a bathroom. Hardcore stomach pain all night and many frequent trips to the bathroom later, my boyfriend mocked my weak stomach. It wasn't until the clock struck 11pm when he began to say he didn't feel right. His face gave off that terrible greenish undertone and he proceeding to sweat. We had to get off on almost all 11 stops on our transit back from China town to Long Island so he could throw up in at least 8 subway trash cans. He hasn't stopped throwing up all night and he's running a fever. Moral of the story: Don't eat grasshoppers. Secondary moral: if I can get sick off guacamole and chips, it's probably not safe to eat anything here.

They know you are there for dinner but you have to get to a show, so every step needs to be quick and easy. We walked in at 6:30pm on a Friday night without a reservation. They asked us what time our show was (8pm) and seated the four of us immediately. The server didn't wait long to get our drink order and offer to bring fresh guac to the table. I order the La Pirata cocktail which had Mount Gay rum, fresh blackberry puree & Thai basil. It was tasty and not too sweet. We ordered the mild guac for the table, which came with chips and a salsa. It was a blended salsa that must have had some interesting peppers, because it was spicy but flavorful. I shared the skirt steak entree and a side order of rice & beans. The steak was cooked as ordered, medium rare and was very tasty. All the entrees were on the smaller side, so I would highly recommend supplementing with a side, all of which are fairly priced. You definitely got value with the rice and beans side. We were all sad we didn't have time for dessert because every dessert that came out was steaming hot and looked delicious!The only downside was the lack of bathrooms. There is one small one downstairs and one upstairs. Only one person can go in at a time and they are coed, which creates an awkward line of people near the kitchen service area.

Had lots of expectations as I have heard good words on it through multiple channels. Ok here we go.We had a large group so ordered a series of apps to share. One of the top three guac for sure - avocado was perfectly smashed and mixed itself well with the tomato dices. It was also seasoned well. In general I stay away from cheese, yet the fundido and black truffle quesadilla simply made my mouth watering, that I simply could not skip. So cheesy and chewy! Main dish was a bit underwhelming...my short rib was slightly overcooked, and a bit too meaty...good, not great.I guess I would rate it 4.5/5, many dishes were worth trying - grasshoppers were a no brainer for example, texture-wise very similar to soft shell crab and did not carry any weird flavor at all (only slightly on the salty side). On the negative side, I should say I got really annoyed by how unorganized this place could get to - took us a long time to get seated and another long period of time to finally get our order through. Not gonna blame upon it as it was supposed to be a busy Thursday night...A must-try in the city!",6,4,7,Elaine H.,"San Francisco, CA",1221,1748,5633

We started off with a trio of guacamole for the table which was yummy, especially the one with the pomegranate seeds. The Burrito Huevon (aka breakfast burrito) was not enjoyable, donde esta the Mexican flavor or any flavor at all? I ended up picking out most of the egg and eating the tortilla. The ""hash browns"" were more like the potato sticks in a can. I just expected more. To boot, the prices were pretty expensive. Saddened that my first NYC brunch was such a letdown.

3.0,9/21/2016,"A great location and a fun, bright atmosphere make Toloache a fun happy hour spot, but otherwise only ok food, pushy service, and high prices make me think there are better options for Mexican in the city.Stepping in, you're greeted with a tall, beautiful dining space that spans two floors and features warm lighting and fun tilework covering many of the walls. The menu features a number of Mexican favorites - traditional tacos, a number of ceviches, and a variety of main courses featuring beef, chicken, seafood, and more. I came with a large group and we all shared a few orders of the guacamole trio. Each order came with three small bowls of guac - traditional, spicy, and a medium guac featuring fruit. The flavours of all three were fine, but even with 6 bowls of guacamole floating around the table there was not much to go around. All three salsas also seemed to lack seasoning and were on the bland side. For my main, I ordered the Pollo Toloache - a pan fried chicken breast with a black bean dumpling and sweet corn pico de gallo. The chicken was cooked very well and the corn pico served with it was sweet and played well with the chicken. That being said, whether it was the pico or chicken, my main came out swimming in a pool of red liquid which made the presentation rather sloppy looking. Portion size was alright but not generous either.Overall the food was decent but nothing special. Service on the other hand was a mixed bag at best. The host and I assume one of the managers were very helpful in helping to accommodate the large group, but the servers themselves were very pushy and constantly kept telling our party to order more appetizers and dishes even after we had said we were fine. They also had trouble explaining some of the dishes coherently. We had some folks who had specific allergies and some who did not eat spicy food and many of us could barely understand what was being shouted back to us after asking questions. That could be troublesome if something important was lost in communication. Finally, for the space, while the decor was beautiful, tables are packed together very tightly. We were constantly being bumped as patrons and servers tried to squeeze by each other behind our table. Given the high volume of people as well, it was very loud at times and hard to hold a conversation.Finally come svalue. The trio of guacamoles costs $27 per order while my chicken rang in around $25. Other starters run in the $13-$20 range while entrees run around $30. So Toloache has its bright spots - the location itself is convenient and some of the food can be good, but iffy service, an excess of noise, and finally poor value for food quality and amount would make be think again before returning.",1,0,1,Philip T.,"Washington, DC",69,181,114
4.0,9/21/2016,"So I came here with a few friends on a Wednesday night for some light dinner and drinks. For starters, the staff was really nice and accommodating. We were seated right away. There are two levels to this place and both levels are quite large- so there's plenty of room. The atmosphere is really nice too- perfect dining lighting and low music playing in the background. To start the night off we each got a glass of the red sangria which was nice and strong. No complaints about the way it was made at all hahaAs far as the food goes- I enjoyed what I had ordered. I ordered the carne asada tacos and thought they were delicious! The thing is- it's a pretty small plate. Granted- I was looking for a small plate so it was perfect for me but if you are looking for something larger I wouldn't get the tacos- or perhaps get two orders if you are really hungry. Also, for the table they put out chips with salsa and guacamole which was also really good. And for dessert- we split a flan and a chocolate cake piece- and both were fantastic! Especially the flan with the caramel over the popcorn pieces! All around- the food was great. Overall- it was a nice place with good food and drinks. One thing I wasn't so happy about though was the bill- I mean I get it's Manhattan- but yikes. Be sure to bring your credit cards or lots of cash. One little thing that bugged me about the grand total of our bill- we asked for more salsa with the chips they put on the table and she charged us for the extra salsa but failed to mention to us we were being charged. I know it's just salsa- but communication woulda been nice on that. Overall- I did have a nice experience here!",0,0,0,Danielle M.,"Queens, NY",336,283,620

The place is quaint, though very small so I can't say a large party would fit comfortably.The hostess saw that I had walked in alone and told me she could give me a small table but ""you'd have to give it back with an hour"". I had never heard of that; giving a paying customer a time limit to eat because she's here alone? I would've maybe understood if they were extremely busy, but with the exception of 2 tables, all others around me were empty.I sat since I came all the way out for Mexican food and ordered the enchilada plate which was described as: Pulled chicken, tomatillo 5 chiles salsa borracha, Mexican cheeses, crema, radish salad | $22* The sauce tastes a little better than your run-of-the-mill ""El Pato"" canned enchilada sauce. * The ""radish salad"" is a handful of shredded lettuce and 3 slivers of a raddish.* The enchiladas (came with 2) themselves were a small tortillas, not the regular-sized ones you'd expect. It didn't come with beans and rice as EVERY TYPICAL ENCHILADA PLATE DOES. But hey, my fault for assuming it did. This place is pretentious and expects you to order that separately as none of their dishes come with sides. For $22. I left hungry and ended up getting a slice of pizza at Famous Amadeus around the corner. I'm not sure about anyone else here but if you're paying $22 for 2 small soaked tortillas, you'd expect to at least leave full. The servers themselves were polite and kind.

I understand that this is NYC and the theater district but $15 for two small tacos is a bit much, and $12 for a glass of sangria.

Since my friend told me this place has the grasshopper tacos, I decided to give it a try for Restaurant Week. Toloache definitely has the Mexican vibe with Latin music blasting in the background, colorful decos and a handful of Spanish staffs. Love how they present the dishes in Spanish; it makes me feel like being in a foreign country for a quick lunch. We got pomegranate Guacamole to start. It was good but not special. Great guacamole can be easily made at home anyways. For appetizer, we had tacos al pastor (pork tacos) and shrimp ceviche tostada. They were good but just can't match the authentic, humble ones I got in Mexico at the price of $1. The chef did a good job marinating and cooking the pork though. For entrees, we had the entraña (skirt steak) and salmon that comes over a tostada. Dang, we ordered tostada twice. Too much already. Steak was tender and juicy enough though. Desserts are a bit much on the sweet side. Would rather spared my calories and a supplement price for a frozen margarita instead. Have to give some compliment for the waitress. She was super nice, attentive and even offered us a sample of the grasshoppers! Finally, I got to taste them: soft, sour and spiced.

5.0,8/14/2016,"Toloache is boasting a new menu for restaurant week 2016 and the selections are creative and inspired. In a sea of overpriced mediocre Mexican chain restaurants, Toloache earns big points in my book for their unique spin on the cuisine in a great setting and is a better bang for your buck$$$. Interesting, well-thought out combinations make this upscale Mexican dining experience a hit. For lunch during RW week, my companion and I got to sample a nice selection of dishes and all were very good. The pork tacos had a smokey rich flavor and the shrimp cerviche on crispy tortilla was light and playful. The steak entree with Brussel sprouts was very tender and they complimented each other well. The salmon entree had little pieces of cactus on top which I enjoyed- though it was served on a crispy tortilla, I don't think it was necessary for the dish as the flavors stood on their own. The profiterole dessert was cool and icy inside which was perfect for this hot day. As a first timer to this restaurant, I also had to try the guacamole with frutas (pomegranate seeds, mango). I was concerned that the addition of fruit would make it too sweet but it didn't- it was refreshing and a great guacamole overall. I highly recommend. As a must-try, you gotta try the remarkable grasshoppers that put Toloache on the map! The crispy texture and spice seasoning make these little guys an unforgettable dining experience.

Other than that, it was smooth sailing. Oh wait no I forgot their appetizer off the restaurant week menu with watermelon was disgusting. Worst appetizer I ever had . But I did order a side of guacamole that came with what looked like a tomato soup and also a bowl of tortilla chips. The soup was not necessary and masked the amazing flavors of the guacamole .The entrees I tried were the black cod off their dinner menu and the split roasted crispy chicken off the restaurant week menu. Both were torn up relatively quickly. The cod was the better of the two as it was rich and buttery and decent sized for $32. As for desert, we got the cream puff and the chocolate flan. The chocolate flan was really savory. The combination of the strawberries , chocolate cake ,flan and whip cream was a match made in heaven . The cream puff option off the restaurant week menu wasn't good in my opinion but my date liked it ..

5.0,8/2/2016,"Toloache must be the best Mexican restaurant in the city and probably the best one I ever been to. I said it last time at the other location in Thompson St. This chef is a rockstar! He really knows how to make incredible dishes with the most well known ingredients. There's nothing ecclesiastical about it. It just how is prepared and the quality of the products.Once again we went for RW since overall the place is a little bit expensive if you go in a regular day, and restaurant week makes it possible to fine dine at these kind of restaurants.Everything and I mean every single thing we ordered was to die for. There were no favorites... Or maybe yes, they were ALL favorites.I went with my girlfriend and we had different things so we could share and taste everything.As a starter, the pork tacos (or tacos al pastor for the ones who love this bite) were probably the best ones I ever had. The tenderness of the meat and the sauce that was marinated into was just unbelievable. So fresh! As well as the shrimp ceviche tostada. You wouldn't imagine this kind of flavor coming out of a regular shrimp tostada but it was out of this world. The sesame hint and the crushed peanuts made the difference. Soooo good!Then the star of the lunch as always: the entraña (skirt steak). Wow! They know how to cook meat. It melts in your mouth. Top quality meat. And the Brussel Sprouts!! These are one of a kind. They remind me of a taste from Argentina. Those childhood memories that you feel you are in Ratatouille. Flashback and tears coming out of your eyes. I could eat a whole bucket of that Brussel sprout side.The salmon that comes over a tortilla it's very good. Not a must but good if you are already eating the entraña. If not, other TWO entrañas haha.Then the desserts are surprisingly amazing. The combination of flavors is to die for. There was nothing left on the plate. Nothing! If I weren't in a restaurant I would say I would lick the plate. Anyway, the almond tart comes with a caramel and chocolate that is incredible and a special mention for me since I'm a coffee ice cream fan and this espresso ice cream was one of the best.The profiteroles killed it! I didn't expect this kind of taste. A cream that is almost like a crema pastelera with very delicious dough and great sauces and chocolate. Even the blackberries were awesome.Definitely my favorite place for Mexican!",3,2,3,Sebastian K.,"New York, NY",41,373,0

The space is rather cramped and the managers kept walking up and down looking for empty tables to fill, while the servers tried to rush patrons through their meal to add another body in their seat. On the other hand, if you're limited for time you might appreciate this approach.It is noisy as all get out and not the place for conversation. I thought I would become hoarse after an evening of raised voice.Wait staff were always upselling for every item ordered from the menu.We ordered the lobster tacos (the best!) carne asada tacos (ordinary) fried Brussels sprouts with queso fresco (love it!), ripe plantains (always a favorite), spicy kale (nice alternative, and flan (comfort food).There is lots of competition in NYC and we'll try another which offers delicious food as well as welcoming hospitality.",1,1,0,Carolyn M.,"Alexandria, VA",18,171,26

4.0,6/16/2016,"The food here is fabulous, but expensive. We went to the restaurant prior to a Broadway show, and after checking on with our reservation, we were asked if we were seeing a show and what the start time was. That was nice. The service continued to be excellent the whole dinner. We decided to skip the extensive appetizer menu and go right to the entrees, figuring that that would be enough to fill us up. I ordered the pollo toloache and a side dish of avocado fries, which I had heard were very good. The chicken breast was a full breast, not just a cutlet, and it was really tasty. The sweet corn pico de gallo gave the dish a wonderful flavor, and the black bean dumpling was good, too! The avocado fries were really delicious, but they were $12. I figured that was my appetizer. My husband ordered the tumbada, which was a paella. Usually, a paella comes in a pot with lots of rice, and is more than enough food for one. For $34 he was presented a plate of paella. Now he said that it was really delicious, but certainly not enough food for him! If they had just even given more rice, he would have been happier. So then, he ordered guacamole, which was nothing all that special. We should have ordered the fruta guacamole. Finally, he ordered the chocolate flan for dessert. A large slice of two colored flan, with whipped cream and sliced strawberries was served. He said that it was the best flan that he had ever had. All told, with one beer, the food, the tax and the tip, the bill was $131. Like I said, the food is delicious, but it is expensive!",0,0,0,Marcia S.,"Shrub Oak, NY",2,38,0

Luckily, the girl at the front was very friendly and prioritized us since there had been a problem, so we were seated before 6:30. We thought that was extremely nice of her and we were very appreciative since we were so hungry after our show. I was told the only sodas they had were Coke and Sprite, which I found odd in a place with such a big bar, but whatever. I had an iced tea, which was very small and I did not receive a refill after I drank it. My glass was simply taken away.We ordered some of the appetizer tacos, which were delicious but small. I guess that's what we get for getting appetizers for meals. That was fine, we had plenty of room for dessert.Dessert really made this place for me. I had the chocolate cake with dulce de leche ice cream. It was fantastic. My mom had the tres leches cake and hers was great too. Wouldn't mind coming here again just for dessert, but other than that I was fairly unimpressed. This place is loud and it's very hard to hold a conversation in here.

The table ordered several anyway.  It was good, but comments were that one was too sweet (the pomegranate one), one was too spicy, and the other one was just right.  Our orders included the lobster tacos, the mushroom tacos, chicken tacos, as well as fish.  The tacos had shells that were about 3 inches in diameter, if that.  We got 2 to a plate, along with some beans and maybe a cup of rice.  $12 However, it was delicious.

So to me, if we are talking credibility, that's it. From the staff to the food to the drinks and atmosphere, the restaurant was a homerun! We began with guacamole and chips, I would suggest getting the traditional. We tried the spicy or and the fruitier one but the traditional was still better. And it was great! The chefs are mashing the guac right in front of you in their front kitchen. The margaritas were very strong, especially for my 100 lb mother, but they were quality! Very good tequila and made with squeezed juices, not mixers. Finally, we both got the scallops with quinoa risotto and it was one of the best things I have ever ate!

I ordered the blueberry margarita.  My drink did not take long.  The margarita was purplish in color and tasted more like a regular lime margarita and not much like blueberry which I was actually glad about.As for food, I ordered the shrimp Toloache. My dining companion ordered a dinner entree but I forget what. When my entree came out It was piping hot and looked inviting,IN the menu description it described it as spicy and thankfully delivered on that promise. The sauce was very spicy to the point that I was glad for the spaghetti squash that topped the dish as it was crisp and a bit sour.  The black beans were at the bottom and it was a different taste with the shrimp than I am used to. I liked the texture combination of the shrimp and the beans along with the softened crispy tortilla. It was cooked crispy but the sauce made the tortilla a bit soft.When we asked for the check it did not take long to get it since they were so packed.A word about seating. The bar is to the right. The small counter we sat at was not that conducive to eating entrees but it would be fine for appetizers. There are tables on the first floor and second floor.

Come and get you Grasshopper on and wash it down with a margarita ( you may have to, lol).I'm always on the look out for unusual and or unique cuisine options. In celebration of Cinco de mayo I was thrilled to see ""Grasshopper"" on the menu. Coming  from a mind set that believes if someone or culture chooses to eat it then why shouldn't I. I've had the opportunity to consume several different types of insects in my life including live grubs and scorpion, but never cooked grasshopper. Slightly crunchy, seasoned with a hint of heat and just a little moist within the exoskeleton. Yummy for my tummy. I enjoyed the earthy grassy taste, my inner neanderthal felt quenched for my desire for the bizarre, oh how proud Andrew Zimmern would be of me.We sampled many other guacamole and queso options, all scored high marks as did the beef, pork, chicken and beef tacos. Strangely they didn't offer tongue, head cheese or tripe? Portions seemed average to smaller, but acceptable.The Margarita's were satisfying group wide, I chose and  pounded two well made jalapeños flavored,  I will not be denied my need for heat.Yes nice decor, yes good food, yes good drinks at reasonable prices in the bustling Time square area.

First of all- they claimed that we did not have a reservation...when I have proof of calling & even confirmed the location. So we went to the bar to wait for a table to open up and start ordering drinks. I hear the older woman hostess aggressively YELLING my first and last name...so I guess they found the reservation? Because I only said my first name whilst attempting to check in. Anyhow, a table was ready- yay! We went ahead to pay for the drinks but the hostess gives us a nasty look, proceeds to shout my full name & impatiently motions for us girls to hurry up to the table. Classless.IT GETS WORSE. We were seated around the window and some dude from outside whips out his penis & starts masturbating right in front of us. Wonderful.Moving on...We brought our own cupcakes & had asked for a candle on one of them for the birthday girl. They said it would be $1 per person which we were cool with. Out comes the dessert dishes FIRST then the cupcakes WITHOUT a candle on any one of them. Thanks for ruining the surprise.Insult to injury, we got charged $16 for the ""distribution"" of our own dessert. Which of course we refused and ended up paying $5 as promised after speaking with the manager (who was pleasant, so the 1 star on this review goes to him).The food was boring & portion sizes were laughable.

5.0,3/31/2016,"East of 9th Ave offers us a scary, tourist-ridden section of NYC and Toloache is one of the few culinary offerings that makes the trip beyond 9th Ave okay. It isn't the cheapest meal, but try Toloache for lunch as they have many of the same gastronomic highlights as the evening menu. Their cocktails (priced $13+) sounded delicious but we didn't indulge during this recent visit. We ordered:Pomegranate guac (Medium spiciness), toro taquitos , truffle quesadilla, and spicy lobster tacos. Everything was delicious. The guacamole was pretty straightforward and frankly sounded a little more exiting than it was but the guacamole was executed well regardless of its creative shortcomings.The toro ceviche was awesome- 4 little ""taquitos"" served in hard shells with two juicy lime wedge. It had just the right amount of spice and zest and acted as a great palette cleanser before moving on to our entrees. The truffle quesadilla does not have any meat on it but you hardly miss it when you're hit with the distinct fragrance of black truffles and cheese. The spicy lobster taco (two tacos served with rice and beans) was meaty and seasoned nicely. Service was attentive, prompt, and we were in and out fairly quickly!Perfect for: non-stuffy business lunch, lunch with friends while romping through midtown",0,0,0,Janet S.,"New York, NY",285,39,30

The avocado fries were pretty good, never had them before so worth a shot. Then the tuna taquitos. These were ok, however nothing special. Also a little heavy on the raw onion which was a bit overpowering. The short rib quesadilla was decent, but nothing to write home about either. Extremely small portions for everything. I understand these items are intended as apps, but typically I would say 3 apps should be enough for a meal.

5.0,2/27/2016,I ate here with my mother and sister after a show. It was excellent. The whole experience was great. We had a reservation and our table was ready as soon as we got there. The hostess asked if we were seeing a show in case we needed to be in and out quickly which I thought was very considerate. Our waiter was Gustavo. He was friendly and extremely knowledgeable of the menu. He answered questions and gave excellent recommendations. Here's what we got:Appetizers:Chips and salsa were brought to the table along with a chipotle sauce which was smoky and spectacular Traditional guacamole- your standard house made guacamole. Great flavor. We devoured it. Quesadilla de tuetano- this was a crispy tortilla with short ribs and bone marrow on it. The savory meat and marrow was mouth watering. Langosta tacos-spicy lobster taco. These were cooked to perfection and well seasoned De lechon- suckling pig carnitas. These were amazing. I could have eaten a thousand of them. The pork was so fell apart and melted in your mouth. The tiny bits of cactus gave it a nice tart kick. Entrees:Camarones toloache- shrimp was perfectly cooked and the sauce was amazing. This is one of their signature dishes and was recommended by our waiter Gustavo. It was excellent. Carne asada- tender and cooked medium rare as asked for. Flavor was delicious. Potatoes weren't anything special. Tumbada- paella with seafood. Portion was perfect and plated beautifully. Seafood was succulent and seasoned well. Octopus was extremely tender. Sides:Fried brussel sprouts queso fresco-crispy and seasoned well nicely balanced with the cheeseDesserts:Chocolate flan- chocolate cake with flan on top. Cake was light and moist. Strawberries complemented it nicely. Flan-classic flanChurros- crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Spectacular. Chocolate and caramel sauces went well with them. To finish off the night the manager came over and offered us 3 shots of tequila on the house. First he asked if any of us were driving which again I thought was very considerate.

4.0,2/25/2016,"Went for NYC Restaurant week, and was pleasantly surprised to find such a great spot in the theater district, which is usually devoid of any good non-touristy restaurants. Only thing preventing me from giving this place 5 stars is the overpriced margaritas, which are quite small, but may be a product of this place's location in a tourist district.

Drinks are exceptional as well... PACKED with alcohol, but perfect balance of flavor and zing.APPETIZERS:-    Callos de Hacha: Seared sea scallops w/ quinoa risotto, porcini mushroom, and huitlacoche butter-    Costilla & Tuetano: Beef short ribs w/ bone marrow, Thai basil, and roasted red onion-jalapeno chiles toreadoWe're big diver scallop fans, couldn't resist the temptation of devouring these divine morsels. Who knew cheesy quinoa would go so well with scallops! Very mild cheese flavor with the mild seafood flavor pairs so effortlessly and cohesively. Tacos were notably fresh.

Medium rare is the way to go - not too tough and still juicy and flavorful. The seasonings were perfect.3) Flan & Tres leches - Lovely end to the meal.

4.0,2/1/2016,"I've lived nearby Toloache for years always finding myself curious what was beyond the green and purple fluorescent lights of this ""Bistro Mexicano"".  I found it easy to pass by until one night coming back from a failed dinner in the Meatpacking District - well, I was full but Le Boyfriend was starving - we decided on Toloache for Mexican noms for him and fancy drinks for the both of us.  I was looking forward to going to this pre and post Broadway musical pit stop and I wasn't disappointed.  It turned out to be a delicious dinner, which has had us come back occasionally and was good enough for me to want to send upper management from L'Oreal here for a business dinner.The first time we came here, I originally Yelped margaritas on my Yelp app and Toloache came up.  I'm glad it did as there just happened to be a reservation available on Open Table so we just went for it!  We were about ten minutes early but were seated right away upstairs.  (I would later learn after coming here on other occasions that you're much better off making a reservation ahead of time versus arriving and waiting 20+ minutes for table). The atmosphere feels sophisticated for your local Mexican venue but it is very laid back as well.  The décor is pretty - especially with the tiled bar downstairs where you can eat and enjoy fresh margaritas (or possible free shot..) and the candles and dim lighting upstairs serve intimate vibes upstairs. My one gripe is when you arrive to a sea of tables on the upper level.  It's pretty cramped so you may want to check your coat and bags if you have them however you'll feel more comfortable if seated near the lights against the wall.  The cramped feeling also happens downstairs as well by the bars and stools opposite it, since it's near the kitchen but for the locals and theater goers this doesn't matter because the food and drinks are worth it and better than the sometimes sad restaurant alternatives that are offered closer to Broadway.Their menu has a little something for everyone: people who hate spicy food, love spicy food, or people who are (at least to me) adventurous enough to want to eat grasshopper tacos.  Menu highlights absolutely include their drinks and guacamole (three very different kinds and guarantee to heat you up) and the fact some of their food, like the quesadillas, are made in an ample wood-assisted oven.  However, if you have a large appetite, I don't encourage you to have their tacos simply because they're small and you'll wind up ordering more only to find yourself unable to finish the second order (totally happened to me).  But their entrees are on the larger side and promise to keep you full.  For certain times of the year, they adjust the menu according to the holidays.  Por ejemplo, they offer a Passover themed menu which includes a Mexican spin on Matzoh Ball soup and other traditional Jewish meals - pretty thoughtful and unique!    Toloache also provides pretty good, attentive service and their bartenders are very knowledgable on their tequila.  It's almost like they're putting on their own Broadway show, one that you probably shouldn't pass by since it would be a real treat to go.",0,0,0,Anna F.,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",262,241,2188

I also ordered a Mezcalita de Piña margarita - delicious. The only thing we could have lived without was the short rib taco that we ordered in addition - it was tasty, but a bit on the fatty side.

3.0,1/5/2016,"Came here after an unusually warm Christmas day following a trip to Rockefeller center and Times Sq. I had been wanting to go here for a while, mostly because they had a really good vegetarian menu. Got in at 8:30 PM (I had a reservation) and the place was packed. I didn't expect it to be such a tight fit, but I guess that's expected in NYC. We were led upstairs and it was REALLY tight. Making it even harder, was that we had a toddler with us in a high chair. We ordered a bunch of things from the veg menu- guacamole trio, tacos, open face quesadilla, veg quinoa paella, enchiladas, sweet plantains and cactus fries. The only item I didn't like were the cactus fries, everything else was DELICIOUS. The guac trio was very tasty! BUT- portions are extremely small for the price. We also ordered drinks- a tropical margarita, cilantro jalapeno margarita and sangria. I was surprised they didn't have pitchers of sangria, so we just ordered glasses. Drinks were good, not the best I have had though. Desert we ordered the churros, chocolate cake, apple tart and mango tres leches all which were good. Overall, the food is very tasty, but the ambience is not what I expected (too crowded) and the portions are wayyy too small for the price.

2.0,1/3/2016,"Small, crowded, almost stifling place where tourists come to mingle. I had been here a few years before and didn't find it near as annoying. Maybe it wasn't filled with so many people not from the area, I'm not sure, but I wasn't impressed.I don't know why I don't give this place one star. They charge you by the (smallest) glass (ever) for soft drinks (at $3 each) which is a mortal sin in my book. I understand it's the cheapest way to make the most money, but you could be a little less gauche about it. At least give an adult size glass for that. Either way, I wouldn't return ever just because they do this. If you want locals to come here stop treating them like tourists. My girlfriend and I ordered the guacamole. It came premixed (not done at the table like better restaurants do) in, again, the smallest bowl they could find, while charging an outrageous amount ($15). The chips were nice and salty and really held up to the dense guacamole. So, plus for that. They had what tasted like a really nice, yet thin and almost watery, side dip that had a nice smokey adobe taste. Not terrible, but alone it would have been insufficient. Paired with the guac it wasn't terrible. We each ordered ceviche out of the three they had. My friend had the perauno and it was presented beautifully and tasted divine. I ordered the hamachi and almost spit it out from all the lime juice used in it. It was also a much smaller portion and presented messily. I wasn't impressed with mine at all. Seriously, watch out for the pucker factor, you won't be happy unless you like the feeling of sucking on a lime with every bite.We then ordered quesadillas. I ordered the shrimp and my friend ordered chicken. Beautifully presented, although hers looked very sparse compared to mine. I remember hers not resembling a quesadilla so much as an open faced tortilla. Mine was made like a normal quesadilla. Both were very flavorful, but again, don't look for value in this food, you won't find it. If you want to spend a LOT to barely get a taste then this is your place. I'm not really sure how they get such great reviews. If you head AWAY from Times Square (or even go to Iguana's just a few blocks over where you get real value for great food) you'll find a lot better. Will not return.Edit: I live almost right in Times Square so I understand how expensive everything is, but this place is just exploiting tourists. Regardless of how good food tastes, to pay this amount of money for what you get is highway robbery.",4,2,0,Nic P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",305,581,269

Good flavor but dish fell short. Didn't care for Burrito Toloache - pomegranate beef short ribs.  Just not a flavor we liked.  Presentation very nice on all dishes.Wait staff and hostesses very friendly.  Attractive decor.  Nice looking bathroom, too!  Enjoyed ourselves.  Would highly recommend.  Great theater-district restaurant.",0,0,0,Wendy M.,"Princeton, NJ",0,9,0

Prime real estate....Anyways, once seated, our server was extremely friendly, speedy, and helpful. He easily made up for the issues faced in the beginning of our experience. First and most importantly, bite the bullet, spend the money, and get the triple guacamole appetizer. Their three guacs are each different and amazing and that's coming from someone who doesn't care much for the stuff. If you only want one order, I'd recommend the spicy guac. It's not unbearably hot by any means, but it offers a unique smoky flavor that is like nothing you've tasted. Their chips always came out warm and the salsa they brought was very thin but damn was it flavorful.I went basic for my entree and had the chicken enchiladas. Very good. I think I've had better only once before. The shredded chicken was all tender and the cheese was fresh and melty. The sauce that was smothered over top was amazingly flavorful.

Whoa boy that cream they put it in it made it so delicious.The lobster tacos were a knockout - perfectly seasoned a just a hint spicy. (On a side note, despite my low spice tolerance everything here was unbearable.) The waiter was telling the truth when he informed me the spice was light and was just there for flavor. My only regret was the dish's small portion size; it feels wrong that you can finish those tacos in two minutes. The rice and beans were standard. But man, just thinking about those lobster tacos makes me want to order them again.The place is slightly on the pricey side, which along with the smaller portion size is not the best combination.

4.0,10/20/2015,"Nice looking place. Service was friendly and attentive from the moment we arrived--we were careful to make reservations. The waiter noticed right away that our little deuce table wobbled a bit. He came back twice to adjust it.As for the menu, We had trouble choosing amongst the unusual looking appetizers, sides, ceviches and the entrees. Upscale, modern mexican dishes that showcase the food, not the toppings. Here's what my sister and I shared: A beautiful, cakelike square chunk of tender, moist suckling pig, crackling skin and all, served with just enough reduced gravy underneath. It's served with a rich corn pudding. A truly delicious open faced short rib and bone marrow quesadilla--more like a crisp tostada pizza than a floppy cheese filled folded mess. Perfectly fried brussels sprouts tossed with a tart cheese--bordering on umami. The only misses, in our opinion, were A) The fruit style guacamole. We were expecting plenty of mango, pineapple, or citrus chunks, but really it was the regular plain guac with some pomegranate seeds sprinkled on top as far as we could tell. B) We both thought the dishes and sauces could stand a bit more spice and heat, or at least they could offer a choice. That's really the only reason I don't immediately grant five stars. Considering the location, atmosphere , presentation, service and overall quality, we both considered the pricing reasonable and the portions fair.Next time we'll ask the waitstaff to kick it up a notch and see what happens.And we will be back, this is a little gem in the heart of the theater district.",0,0,0,Rob P.,"Fort Lee, NJ",2,30,0

4.0,10/7/2015,"I commend Toloache for taking standard Mexican fare beyond the ordinary. You'll find a whole lot more than steak, chicken, or ground beef with some shredded cheese and some lettuce on a tortilla. This isn't the place where you'll find authentic Mexican food, but this certainly isn't Chevy's either.The avocado fries and elote (corn on the cob) are my favorite side dishes, and their guacamole trio to share is always a hit for the table.Their taco selections are unique and whether meat, fish, poultry, vegetarian, or are adventurous enough to try the chapulines (grasshopper, which I recommend highly)...there's something for everybody. The food is delicious, and though the spiciness needs to be three notches higher to be more authentic, there is plenty of flavor overall. The drink selection is also stellar, and you should certainly get the Mexican hot chocolate or Cafe Olla to wrap up your meal.Service and ambiance are stellar and whether for a business lunch or a romantic date, Toloache is stellar!",2,0,1,Danesh I.,"Kew Gardens, Queens, NY",217,304,393

Nonetheless, great food and great drinks. It's Times Square so expect a majority of the restaurants to be a bit on the pricer side. I had the prickly pear frozen margarita and the traditional mojito. Both very good and a bit too easy to drink! We started with the ceviche sampling of 3 - it was very light a great way to taste without being stuffed. I had the skirt steak, as it is my favorite cut of steak and it was delicious. I also liked how the entree came with guacamole, potatoes and even a mini mole enchilada.

3.0,8/14/2015,"My friends and I came here to try out their restaurant week menu since it looked pretty good. Let me start off by saying that I really wanted to like this place. .. especially as I was the one who chose the restaurant. The prices here are high but as expected considering it's the theater/tourist area which is exactly the type of place you should try during RW. Things started out promising, we ordered our drinks and they came right away.  Our server was nice enough but seemed to be in a rush and this was the theme throughout our dinner.  I ordered the ceviche as an appetizer, mero al ajillo (grouper) entree, and for dessert the pastel de elote (corn cake). The ceviche was delicious!! There was a nice selection of fish,  shrimp, octopus, corn and yummy avocado. After the ceviche, my expectations were high for the rest of my meal... sadly my fish was mediocre at best.  It was cooked medium rare as I like it but the flavors did not mesh well.  It tasted way too garlicky and salty at the same time,  the brussel sprouts were the best thing on the plate.  The corn cake dessert was good but nothing especial. My biggest issue throughout our dinner was the sense that they simply wanted us to be done as quickly as humanly possible. The timing between our courses was super short. This would have been good for someone who's there on a short lunch break but it didn't feel right if you're trying to enjoy a nice dinner.  I was still working on my  salty fish and there was about half of it still on my plate when they cleared my friend's plates and brought out the dessert for all of us.  They just put mine on the side as I was clearly still eating my entree.

4.0,8/11/2015,"So I'd heard this place had some of the best guacamole in NYC. Tall order right? Let's see how they measured up...First things first: no reservation, no Toloache for you! Toloache 50 is located in the heart of the Theater District, so business will always be booming. It's not hype -Toloache was great. Being located where it is, you will most likely have a show or two to see right after dinner. The hostess was great with this as they 2nd (right after asking about your reservation) question she asked, and the waiters were also aware enough to keep in mind that you may have a show afterward, so they work with you with that. Had to wait a few (not long) for the reserved table, and once seated, the service was quick & smooth without being rushed. The food was also great with a very accessible menu & staff willing to make recommendations. The margaritas are excellent too. One thing to consider though - it's not a large place, and it is popular (Toloache was turnt UP on a Tuesday), so expect a little wait, and expect it to be crowded & loud. If you can handle it though, it's a TON of fun. Also, try the Trio.Does Toloache measure up to having some of the best guacamole in NYC? I'd answer, but I'm too busy making my way back for their Trio de Guacamole & a margarita or two. If you're on a date & looking for a romantic rendezvous, but you're the type of couple who would rather YELL THINGS AT EACH OTHER instead of whispering sweet nothings, Toloache could & should be for you.

They really packed in the patrons so you didn't have a whole lot of room, portions were very small so if you're hungry you might need to stop at Taco Bell afterwards and finally the prices were rather high for what you got.  The margaritas were very tasty but again small and rather expensive for what you got.

So-so service, but really not so sure you could expect much more given the level of MAYHEM in this place. Seems acceptably clean, but hard to tell given the number of bodies packed into this space. The guacamole flight is quite good, made fresh by two ladies you can see in the lower dining room working what appears to be a ""guacamole bar."" Ingredients were fresh and tasty. Salsa type ""red sauce"" was also good, though not ""salsa fresca"" Americans are often used to. Ceviche flight was quite bad. Fish was fresh enough, but flavors were very poorly combined or just not tasty at all. Why on earth anyone would put what tasted like orange juice into ""tuna ceviche"" is beyond me. I was unable to finish the ceviche and that is practically unheard of for me. Atmosphere is deafeningly loud.

We first got the Trio of Guacamoles to share, which come with the traditional, fruity and spicy guacamole and a basket of chips. I especially liked the fruity one, which had a pleasant pomegranate flavor. For entree, I got the De Lechon (suckling pig carnitas) tacos, which were some of the better tacos I've had in the city. But the rice and beans served on the side were not so great, which was disappointing since the tacos themselves were rather small in portion.On the other hand, the venue is clean, spacious and well-decorated, so it doesn't feel too stuffy or chaotic even when it's busy at its peak lunch time. The service staff were quite friendly and attentive as well.

2.0,7/26/2015,"If only this place was cheaper I would give it a much higher rating. I'm a B.O.B (Baller on a Budget) and this place breaks the budget. I tried Shrimp $16, Lobster $19, and Suadero $15 tacos . I am not a fan of seafood but the shrimp and lobster tacos were delicious and I wanted more.  The Bad: You only get 2 tiny tacos for $16-19!! per order. Also a Mexican Restaurant that doesn't give free chips & salsa?? Despite being so expensive? That's a no no. You have to order it separately which is another $4. Guacamole & Chips $14. If you are a big eater than prepare to spend here in order to feel satisfied. The food is good, but value vs price I think it's overpriced and you get small portions of everything you order. You can find cheaper options with bigger portions for Mexican food in NYC.I would return if it were cheaper and I knew that the portions would leave me satisfied.

Had lovely, spicy mezcal cocktails and a really rich truffle risotto/seafood dish. Amazing. Boyfriend got the suckling pig and it was rich and delicious. Got dessert, too, and a nice big shot of Kaluha in my coffee. Good thing Book of Mormon was so fun and lively or we surely would've slipped into a food coma from our meal here. We ate at the bar and had a nice time talking to the bartender and other patrons seated nearby. It was crowded as anything in NYC, but we didn't feel our food took too long nor that we were being processed in n' out like cattle. Hungry, hungry cattle.

The Entrana was not that bad and it came with a side of kale, which surprisingly was a good combo together. (I'm not even a kale fan btw!) but the chicken... That was delicious! It came with a very flavorful saffron rice and a dab of green sauce on the side. The only con was that the chicken was slightly on the dry side but aside from that, it was really yummy! As for the dessert, we got one of each since there were only two to choose from and we wanted to try both: Pastel de Elote (corn cake) and Panna Cotta. I didn't like the corn cake so much but the Panna Cotta was really good! The caramel, Chocolate and popcorn all worked so well together.

As I said, I stayed on the safe side and ended up ordering the Chicken Toloache. It was described as ""Chipotle-marinated chicken breast a la plancha crispy Mexican cheeses-pinto bean dumpling sweet corn-pico de gallo."" It read like I was getting a plate of mess and that's exactly what it looked like. The chicken tasted good, but it was the very thick.

We were in a huge rush this weekend and thankfully they had a table open. We were in and out in 40 minutes, and that's with stating with chips, salsa and guac.The guacamole was really enjoyable but perhaps not worth the $14 price tag. We ordered the medium version and it really wasn't spicy at all. It was a decently sized portion though. The chips themselves were better than most chips offered at Mexican restaurants. They didn't crumble and weren't oily at all. The salsa wasn't spicy either, rather it had a smooth sweetness to it. Really easy to go few the first few baskets of chips, and very hard to resist ordering more once the meals came. I ordered the quesadilla de pollo and for $12, it was an absolute bargain. I was really surprised by its presentation. I expected a greasy, super cheesy quesadilla with a scarce amount of chicken, rice and beans. Instead, the quesadilla itself looked very sophisticated, with a bit of cheese and salsa sprinkled on top, chicken stuffed in the center, and rice and beans served on the side.

It did not come with regular lettuce but kale. The kale was very tasteless and unappealing. I had to use the chips and salsa we ordered as an appetizer/side to add more flavor to the kale (I tried to finish it and not waste it). I ended up putting kale (I had a large plateful of it) on the tortilla chips and then put the salsa on top and then eat it to withstand the bitter taste.Other than that, the rest of the food was pretty good (corn on the cob, ceviche). We were disappointed that they only serve burritos for lunch and not dinner (yet they serve quesadillas for dinner, which makes no sense).

5.0,5/27/2015,"Leave it to me to finally find a delicious Mexican restaurant the week before I move back to California. The chips. The guac. The salsa. All mouthwatering. Asked for the guac spicy and for once a restaurant took me seriously and it had a nice kick to it. I ordered the carne asada tacos without the meat (because vegetarian). They were very flavorful. And it was nice to not get a weird look or have to explain myself because I ordered a meatless item sans meat. The beans were good, the rice wasn't dry which is usually the case at most of the Mexican restaurants I've been to in the area. Enjoyed the atmosphere, it was relaxing. The staff was very friendly, took time to explain the menu and assist in ordering drinks. Try the original mojito, you won't be disappointed. Would definitely go back if time allowed.

5.0,5/26/2015,"Toloache is definitely one of the best Mexican restaurants I've ever been to, certainly my favorite in New York.  I usually go for lunch and cocktails.  I am always blown away by their delicious food.  Toloache is conveniently located right by Times Square.  I would recommend calling ahead to see if there is a wait, however, I am always seated quickly.We always order their freshly made Guacamole as an appetizer.  They make the Guacamole in front of everyone in the center of the restaurant.  It's so good.  Their Queso Fundido is also delicious.  I recommend adding the Chorizo to the Queso.As for the main course, I am a fan of their tacos.  The tacos are wrapped in a fresh corn tortilla.  All tacos come with a side of Mexican fried rice and black beans.  Their entrees are very large and tend to overwhelm me.  The tacos are the perfect size, especially if you want to save room for dessert, which you definitely should!  My favorite tacos are the Suadero (braided brisket) and the Thai Basil short rib.  I've heard that the classic Pollo (chicken) tacos are also very good.As for dessert, I love the Flan.  It's very light.  They drizzle raspberry sauce and caramel popcorn over the flan.  They also top it with Pansy flower petals.  The presentation is beautiful and it's very tasty!Their cocktail menu is excellent.  It would definitely be a fun place to go for margaritas and appetizers.",2,0,0,Jane B.,"Buffalo, NY",274,399,5557

The alcohol is so well masked that you don't realize how much booze you have actually consumed until  you start feeling silly and start blabbing at the dinner table. So order and drink with caution.The food is also worth your while. Their portions are a little small, but order several dishes to share with your table so you get to try a little of everything. I have been here several times, but some of my favorite dishes are Trio de Guacolmes, because I just love anything with avocados, Quesedilla de Huitlachoce & Trufas, next time, I am ordering that one all to myself, definitely not enough to go around because its so irresistibly good. Another favorite off the tacos menu is the Camaron tacos, because I also love shrimp. But garlic chipotle shrimp? That itself sounds mouth watering.Lovely atmosphere, great place for a group, plenty of seating (both locations that I have been to have two floors, but if you are coming on a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday night, call ahead to make a reservation just in case).",0,0,0,Irene H.,"Boston, MA",390,251,286

I had the guac for starters, cactus fries because I am greedy and the Carne Asada as a main course. Everything was tasty and the grilled skirt steak was gorgeously done. The Cactus fries were a surprise. They sort of taste like a mild pickle but deep-fried and served with some delish toamto sauce.Whenever I go to Mexican, Thai, indian etc restaurants I feel a bit afraid they'll serve me super spicy food, even if I repeatedly ask for mercy.

3.0,5/17/2015,"The faded Spanish mission facade held a string of star tin lanterns in its dark window, with a small delicate and whimsical pastel green and pink neon sign high up that said ""Toloache"" in cursive, suggesting the softness of flowers. That's not quit what the feeling of tiny bug legs caught in the back of my throat elicited, even the next morning after my meal.But it was the grasshopper tacos $15 that snagged me into this place, two perfect fresh corn tortillas, like petals, with loving brush strokes of complex green tomatillo salsa and plush avocado.  I was still surprised when the plate arrived, with no discrepancy.  It was clearly a plate of bugs.  Piled high, scattered like corpses from a nests genocide.  The dark sophisticated and playful dining room barely detracted from the visual of their faces, and fine legs.The crunch and texture wasn't enjoyable, almost too hard and insubstantial at the same time.  The flavor of the tacos, without the bugs, were wonderful, and I even managed to devour my carnage of villa insectos. Toloache feels like a little village inside, decoratively a winner of the myriad tex mex haunts I've seen as a personal resident of lonestar country. Not far from gawdy Times Square, Toloache is unusually comfortable and a bit classy, yet still manages to feel a little touristy and exploitative, in vicino of the mounds of chain hotels, like enormous bright dirt dobbers.Guacamole and ceviche samplers for $25, as well as enchilada plates didn't help the sting, but the quality is there.If you are looking for an adventurous mission of culinary entomology in a bar hop, this place gets a certain blue ribbon, despite its nefarious mission of proselytizing to short term out of towners after a Broadway show, but the food really isn't bad, and the margaritas looked decent as well.",5,2,3,Scott L.,"New York, NY",5000,2401,4299

1.0,5/13/2015,"With only a few days until Mother's Day, I had trouble finding a restaurant with available reservations.  Fortunately, Toloache wasn't fully booked.  It's close to the theater district, where my brothers live, so it seemed like a good choice.While getting settled in, we all said hello and caught up a bit.  The staff was hovering over us the whole time, clearly trying to pressure us to order quickly and making our first few minutes in the restaurant really uncomfortable.We started the meal with a trio of guacamole, a ceviche, and the queso fundido with chorizo.  I was disappointed to find that the guacs and ceviche were underseasoned and thus, lacking in flavor.  However, the real problem was the queso fundido, which arrived almost cold with the cheese having hardened back up and the grease from the chorizo completely separated and floating on top.Next came the entrees.  I wasn't particularly interested by anything on the menu, but saw ""chapulines"" (grasshoppers) and figured that would be worth a try.  When they arrived, I was upset to see that they hadn't been cleaned.  They were just deep fried whole, including the legs.  You might find chapulines prepared this way at a roadside stand in the middle of Mexico, but at a restaurant, they should be properly cleaned - these were not.  I tried to eat them anyway, but they scratched my throat going down and I had to give up.This lead into the next uncomfortable service interaction when I asked for them to be taken off the bill.  They called over a manager who tried to argue that I need to pick a replacement taco before ultimately acquiescing.To close out the meal we ordered a few desserts for the table.  One of my brothers ordered the hot chocolate without the cinnamon, which piqued my interest, so I ordered a hot chocolate too.  When they arrived, both of ours were poured out of the same carafe despite the fact that mine was supposed to include cinnamon.  He gave my mom a taste and the first words out of her mouth were ""wow, that's a lot of cinnamon"" - which made us laugh because she hadn't seen us order.My brother was fine letting the cinnamon issue slide, but our chocolate wasn't even warm, it was flat out cold.  When asking to have it warmed up, I also mentioned that his wasn't supposed to have cinnamon and the waitress insisted that neither of ours had any cinnamon.  This was clearly wrong because you could see the ground cinnamon floating on top.  Besides that, mine was supposed to have cinnamon, so even if she were right, the order would be wrong.All around, this was a terrible Mother's Day experience and I would not recommend Toloache.",0,0,0,Anthony D.,"New York, NY",158,38,2

The place was packed when we arrived and I was so glad that we were seated immediately even though we didn't have a reservation during the busy dinner time. The hostess at the door was very sweet to trust that we would have their table back to them before their next reservation. We were seated on the second floor next to the wall. The food was very pricey for the small portions but that is a given due to the location of the restaurant. The guacamole was super fresh and the tacos tasted great.The lack of a great rating is solely due to the terrible service we experienced. For whatever reason, our server seemed to be unhappy with us. Maybe since we didn't order much meant that he was going to have a small tip? Anyway, when we paid, the server left my boyfriend's credit card at the register and when we brought it to his attention that our card wasn't there, he quickly went to blame us that maybe we dropped it. After seeing that we even used our phone flashlights to search the floor, he begrudgingly said he will check the register.

3.0,5/4/2015,"My only complaint about this place is the price, I mean come on, the tacos are good but do you really think they are $8 a piece good? Me thinks not.... We stopped in early on a Sunday evening because we were craving some Mexican food that we could walk to so I eatered the best and found this on the list. I started with a watermelon martini which I asked for, it was not on the cocktail list but they did have fresh watermelon juice and I received a strawberry martini. I didn't send it back because I just wanted a vodka martini with some fresh juice and that's what I got. My bfriend had the margarita that had some spice and tamarind in it, I can't recall the name but it was good. We ordered the rojo spicy guacamole to start and although it was very good, not that spicy unfortunately, the chips certainly aren't home made like at Anejo and the portion is very small for $14. We decided to split 3 different orders of tacos:1. Langosta - spicy lobster, salsa, avocado - these are 2 small corn tortillas topped with a very small portion of bits of lobster for $19...that's $8.50 a taco, COMPLETELY not worth it.2. De Lechon - Suckling pig carnitas, cactus salad chicharron, salsa verde, queso fresco - these mostly consist of pieces of fat, not in a bad way but fat none the less for $143. Suadero Bohemia-braised brisket, avocado red onions, cilantro, tomatillo salsa horseradish crema these were definitely my favorite and the only ones that were in anyway substantial for $15.I mean call me crazy but I really don't think 2 drinks and a couple tacos warrants a bill over $100 but that's just me...as good as the food was I'm going to drop them down to 3 stars for the non-existent QPR.",1,0,0,Leslie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",82,444,2

We said yes and ordered cocktails. The guac came quickly with the chips and the drinks soon after. The guac was SO fresh and delicious. The waiter took our orders and persuaded my friend to go with the sea bass special and I went with the Toalache chicken. My friend was hesitant to get an entree because she didn't want too much food but the portions were perfect- not so little that your left hungry and not so large that you can't finish- even my friend who eats like a bird was able to finish it. She asked if it was spicy and they said no but they would give her a spicy sauce on the side and she LOVED it! She even asked where she could buy it. As for my chicken- so juicy and deliciously marinated. The black bean and cheese dumpling on the top was amazing.. My only complaint is that there wasn't more than one!Since we were in a hurry we didn't have a chance to order dessert (sadly, for me) but I'm sure it wouldn't have disappointed given the quality of the meal.

My daughter and I were looking for a light dinner in advance of a college admission meeting.  The place was empty when we arrived.  We asked for a table and were told that we could have a table but they would need it back by 6.  No problem. We were seated upstairs in a completely empty space in a not great table.  Five minutes later another couple - clearly also without a reservation - were seated right next to us.  Only people in the place -- we all could have held hands.  Our meal - while delicious - was rushed and we felt very unwelcome.  There was no reason for this.  We left the place 40 minutes later and the whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth.  No customer should ever be made to feel uncomfortable in a restaurant, not even in NYC.",0,0,0,Nicolette S.,"Belmont, MA",2,31,0

Our server greeted us immediately and gave us his recommendations. The house salsa and chips were excellent. The salsa was more of a puree and had a kick to it. The chips were not overly salty and were very crispy. For an appetizer we started with the chicken quesadilla. It was small, but had an amazing taste. It was not greasy at all. Most of the cheese was served on the outside of the tortilla, which gave it an interesting flavor. I had the enchiladas which were stuffed with pork. The flavor on the pork was amazing. My wife had the seafood paella, which was a huge plate. The highlight of her dish was the grilled octopus, which we both had never had. It was so tender! We will both be looking for that at restaurants going forward. The house margaritas were also tasty! Our server brought out a sampler of desserts for us on the house, which was really nice. The flan was the best, and when I return I would go with that. One of the best Mexican restaurants we have experienced. The pricing was good. Our total was $170, but $75 of that was in margaritas.

But the guacamole, not something I'd have ordered for myself (I like it spicy) was really, really good. It tasted so fresh and the chunks of fruit really worked. The salsa was good, too, but I was kind of put out paying for what normally appears on your table for free until I saw the whole bill, which was relatively cheap, so I didn't mind. Be warned, though, the salsa is not what most mexican restaurants serve, it had the consistency of tomato sauce but it was really flavorful. The tortilla soup was amazing.

4.0,3/5/2015,"**Restaurant Week Winter 2015 Review**Of all the other RW's I've attended so far this season (Clement, Junoon, Gallagher's Steakhouse), Toloache is my favorite.  It's a bit surprising that a place in the Theater District actually tastes good.  The place is fairly large with a decent capacity since they have an upper floor and it doesn't smell greasy or anything.  They have an open guacamole bar in the middle of the restaurant which is a bit awkward.You have to get the house habnero hot sauce - this stuff BURNS, but it's amazing, especially with the tacos and enchiladas.As my appetizer, I chose the pulled pork tacos - you get two fat corn tortilla tacos packed full of juicy pulled pork.  The pork was full of flavor and juicy to the point that it was dripping out of my taco.  Make sure you add lots of lime and the awesome house hot sauce.  For an appetizer... this is pretty filling.  My colleague had the lobster bisque which she said was way too salty and rich.My colleague and I shared the carnitas enchiladas and the salmon for our main courses.  The salmon was actually a fairly large piece (with crispy skin on the bottom side) over a bed of broccoli and roasted corn kernels.  The salmon was cooked very well and required no extra seasoning.  The veggies it sat in were flavorful and complemented the salmon well.  As for the enchiladas, the carnitas seemed somewhat similar to the meat that was in my tacos.  I didn't like the sauce the enchiladas (2) were covered in... something tasted strange about it.  I prefer salsa verde over my enchiladas, but no problem when you douse it in the hot sauce!  Salmon was better than the enchiladas.Both the tres leches (comes with vanilla bean ice cream) and the flan were a nice end to our meal.  The tres leches was soaked with delicious milkiness, but the vanilla ice cream was probably not necessary.  The caramel flan was very sweet and rich, but smooth - this was too sweet for my colleague.  I prefer a more ""eggy"" flan.Overall, a nice experience at a Theater District restaurant.",3,0,0,Allene T.,"Manhattan, NY",2170,1311,3584

3.0,3/4/2015,"I have extremely mixed feelings about this place. I'll start off by saying the tables are VERY small, expect to be sitting on top of the people next to you. It was also absolutely freezing at any table near the front because the door was malfunctioning and letting in cold air. However, my biggest gripe by far was the drinks. They were absolutely disgusting. I had the skiiny margarita, the peligrosa, and the other margarita  I cant remember the name.. but it was the only other drink (besides peligrosa)on the menu that was spicey. All three were undrinkable and I ended up paying for them all- basically 50$ down the drain.  The skinny marg was the best of the three.. I could tolerate it.. but whoever comes up with the flavor combos for the others is nuts.  The food was the only thing that saved the experience. I really liked the guac and the briskett tacos. I dont think I'd go here again because of the drinks and fact that it's just too small. If you don't mind that, the foods good enough to enjoy.",0,0,0,Melissa A.,"Howard Beach, NY",14,107,61

I had to ask for an order of tortillas, so I could mop up the sauce. The 3 of us shared the medium-hot guacamole, which was chunky & creamy, blended with cubes of fresh fruit & topped with a toss of pomegranate seeds. We asked for hot sauce & were granted not only a tomato-habanero blend, but also a scorching purée of straight chili peppers. The vegan among us ordered a quinoa ""risotto"" topped with sautéed veggies. Minus the cheese, it was still beautifully plated, filling, and delicious.

4.0,2/25/2015,"Classic Mexican Dishes with Some Added FlareFood: 4.5 starsThe presentation of the food leaves a good impression upon you once it arrives at the table. You almost don't want to eat it...almost. I suggest ordering from the signature dishes (JM dishes on the menu) since they are the ones recommended by the head chef. The Torta Ahoganda is delicious.  A generous portion of avocado blends well with the pork and red cabbage. The only change I would make is to have the tomato sauce a tad bit spicier, but that is nitpicking. The salsa on the shoestring fries is downright delicious. Crsip, fresh, flavorful. I wish there was more of it when I first started eating it. The guacamole is excellent and flavorful especially the traditional guacamole, but it is exorbitantly priced. I understand this is an upscale restaurant and avocado isn't a cheap fruit, but $14 is pushing it. If you are with a 3-4 person group go with the Trio since you will receive the same portion of guacamole for $25 which saves a little over $10. The frutas is interesting because it incorporates mango, apples and weirdest of all pomegranate. The flavors don't seem compatible, but it creates an interesting pairing. The spicy was the most disappointing since it didn't contain any remnants of spiciness. My fellow two diners are adverse to anything spicy, yet they stopped just short of licking the bowl clean. Service: 4.25 StarsUnsure what to get, the servers are more than happy to provide you with recommendations, especially for diners who flip-flop more than John Kerry (yes I know what reference is more than a decade old). Service is quick despite a crowded restaurant. Ambiance: 3.75 StarsEspecially during the cold winter, it is a welcoming place to warm up sitting at a table near the brick oven where they cook the quesadillas.During the lunch and dinner rushes the restaurant will become a little cramped on the lower level (mainly the bar at dinner).Make sure to use a bit of elbow grease on the outside door since the suction from the other door seals it like an airlock. It is a good warmup for your meal. Overall: 4.25 StarsThe majority of the dishes are classic Mexican, but some dishes have a few added ingredients (e.g. Frutas guacamole which includes mango and pomegranate).The alcoholic drinks are standard. The slice of grapefruit was refreshing.The food is on the expensive side, especially the guacamole, but if you are looking for something different it is a nice place to try.I highly recommend a reservation during the lunch and dinner rush, but especially during the hours leading up to the Broadway shows.",0,0,1,Philippe B.,"JACKSON HTS, NY",82,281,835

The primary reason we ended up here was because of the restaurant had a vegetarian menu and amazing reviews.As we arrived, we were greeted pleasantly by a lovely hostess and taken up to our table. Almost immediately we were offered water and provided with menus. The waitress was very pleasant and provided us with recommendations when we asked.We ordered apps to share:1) Trio de guacamoles - one traditional, one with apple and one with spice. This was awesome. I enjoyed them all.2) Avocado fries - this was good but nothing to drool over! In fact I was a little disappointed that they served this with ketchup.3) Queso fundido - delicious - can't ever go wrong with melted cheese :DMains:1) Sopa de Tortilla - this was amazing! I could have drank it from a glass! I would order this over and over again.2) Quesadilla de Huitlacoche y Trufas - this was underwhelming. I was actually a little disappointed by this. Their version of a quesadilla was a tiny tortilla with melted cheese over it... the portion was incredibly small for a dinner size main.3) Enchiladas Vegetarianas - great - sauce was delicious4) Tacos de Hongos y Nopales - I reluctantly ordered this but i was so happy with it. It was one of the bes mains we ordered to our table.Dessert:1) Churros - warm and cinnamon-y served with melted chocolate and caramel 2) Pastel de Chocolate - warm chocolate cake with dolche de leche ice cream. This was so delicious. I was so sad that I was sharing with the table! I high recommend one dessert per person.The drinks were unique and delicious.The service was so lovely.

3.0,1/22/2015,"In December I brought a few visiting out-of-towners here for dinner. My steak (Carne Asada) was COLD. Like it had been sitting in the kitchen for a while & just thrown on the grill for a few seconds to warm up before serving. That didn't do the trick at all (shouldn't have been done in the first place), because first bite in you could feel the minimal warmth on the outside & cold meat on inside. It was a really busy Saturday night so I didn't bother complaining as it would have taken even more time for them to get something else prepared. And perhaps it was a one-time mistake. I've been here for dinner several times now & really like the place; good drinks, good food, good service. Everything else that night was fine too, love the Avocado fries.

I wish they offered the traditional guac ingredients in a medium or hot option - if you want to increase the spice you have to get one with fruit or with chipotle and cheese.

We made a reservation for 530, we were greeted instantly and seated in a reasonable amount of time in a great seat by the window. The inside of the restaurant was decorated nicely and it seemed like a charming place.  We both ordered drinks.. kinda pricy. In mine you could taste that there was tequila, however my husband's was supposed to have Mezcal in it and we were pretty sure the bartender completely forgot to add the alcohol in his which was pretty disappointing. Since it was early and we had a pre theater seating, we decided to do some appetizer samplers (guacamole trio and ceviche trio). The guacamole was nothing special, the best one was the one with pomegranate seeds in it. It was fruity and nice but the others were pretty plain. The ceviche trio however was pretty good. One was very fresh tasting with watermelon, another came out as teeny tiny tacos which we both thought was cute, and the last was mostly forgettable. For our last shared dish we had the short rib tacos. They were quite good. They came with bone marrow and caramelized onions. Too rich for one person so I am glad we shared. Overall the meal was par and really pricy for what you get which is I suppose, the story of Midtown. Would we go back?

I had made a 3 people reservation originally and my wife made the mistake of arriving at the restaurant 20 mind earlier than our reservation time. The restaurant was about 50% full with plenty of seating but we were refused seating with ""we only seat full parties"" message. When we asked what to do then (given that the 7-8 bar seats were full and the tables were not, we were asked to sit and wait on stools that were directly on the path of the staff that were coming in and out of the kitchen. We received obviously no service as i actually would have ordered drinks given that we would need to wait.  Waiting before the full party arrives is nothing new for nyc but when the bar is full and the tables empty, seating customers in uncomfortable no-service zones doesn't make sense. This kind of inflexible ""we have written rules that we will die by"" sort of attitude makes me feel like the restaurant believes they are too good for their customers.Once the third person arrived, we were taken to our table which was cozy. The pictures on yelp look very interesting. Service though was truly abyssmal. Again, at a half full restaurant getting the attention of our server was like chasing a deer with a bow and arrow in a forest. When i was able to ask a question about an item, before i could process the answer and maybe ask a follow-on or actually order, our server managed to teleport out to safe distance from the evil customers. Regarding the food, i lived in texas for a long time and have experienced varying degrees of mexican and tex-mex greatness and the taste of the items we ordered wasn't the worst but wasn't the best either.

I think we had probably had a least 5 different servers come to our table throughout the night.  Unlike Mexico where the enthusiasm didn't add up to much actual quality this place made me feel like family.  I have literally never said that about a restaurant in my entire life, but they were so amazingly attentive, friendly and genuinely happy to please me I was about ready to move in.  I truly believed I had seen stellar service before that night but this place raised the bar.  Hands down the BEST.  Typically I'm pretty reluctant to turn control over because I have a very particular palate (and I know from experience ""recommendations"" are normally just salesmanship) but I threw caution to the wind when the waiter asked me how ""adventurous"" I was feeling when I ordered a margarita.  Well sir, challenge accepted!  He urged me to try their signature ""toloache"" and assured me that if it wasn't to my liking he'd take it back no charge.  After one sip I fell in love.  It was the best margarita I've ever had.  The hibiscus literally does the tarantella on your tongue.  When I thanked him for the recommendation, he beamed back at me which I found endearing.  When you start off on such a great note you might as well go all the way so I took every recommendation they gave me.  We had the spicy guacamole, the lobster tacos and then an apple tart for dessert.  I had one standard margarita and one pomegranate. (My husband ordered something else but I forget what it was).  It has been a long time since I remember enjoying a meal that much.  The lobster was so decadent and well balanced with just the perfect amount of butter.  Guacamole was definitely a donkey kick to the mouth but I told them I was ready for spice and it delivered.  I'm still amazed I ordered dessert because it's just not my thing but we cleaned our plate.  While I must admit that the original margarita was just average the pomegranate was wonderful.  Not as good as the toloache but that is on a level all its own.  For each course and drink a different waiter came over to suggest something.  It was always polite, didn't interrupt our meal and was done with such warmth it made an already beautiful meal epic.  My husband had 2 of the Mexican beers in addition to all I mentioned and our bill came in at a very reasonable $117.  Places like Toloache are the reason I keep falling back in love with Manhattan.  Only here can you unearth such a gem.",1,0,0,Cristina M.,"Jamaica, NY",123,53,69

3.0,12/6/2014,"Whenever I dine out in New York City I always find myself in the illusion that every restaurant there is amazing. So when I decided to eat at Toloache during restaurant week I was ready to be amazed. Much to my disbelief, the food was just...ok. Nothing special. Now that's not to say that the food was ""bad"", I was just not very impressed. And this is coming from someone who is not a picky eater at all. The food can be described as ""mild.""  Not in spice level but in seasoning level. The atmosphere was romantic with dim lights and small tables. Drinks were pretty strong so if you like tequila then that's a plus for you. Give it a try yourself.

5.0,12/6/2014,"Loved it! This midtown gem offers healthy Mexican food with big flavors. Stopped in upon arrival in NYC for a quick bite before Wicked. The low-lit, warm environment is very inviting. We came in early around 5 so they were able to accommodate us, but any later, make a reservation for sure. They have a wonderful drink selection and can help you select the perfect margarita. I wanted something not sweet where I could taste fresh lime and the tequila, and they had the perfect choice for me. My husband tried the scorpion which had pink grapefruit juice. The cocktails were wonderfully crafted with fresh ingredients.Next we chose to start with guacamole. They have 3 types - mild, medium, and hot. We chose the mild but their bold salsa on the side was a great pairing if you need an extra kick. We asked for veggies in lieu of chips and they brought us cucumber and jicama strips which were a fresh, light alternative. For dinner, we split their special which was Hollywood fish on a bed of roasted broccoli. This dish had beautiful presentation with interesting Mexican flavors throughout. Could've licked the plate. All in all, very pleased with the fresh, whole food selection with creative flavors from beginning to end of our meal. Not the typical Tex Mex cheese laden fare you see at most Mexican restaurants.

We started off sharing tacos: carne asada..really good and they had a nice little kick of spicy nothing overbearing & we also had the suadero tacos they were the BEST! Perfect combination of brisket, tomatillo, horseradish cream..so good almost ordered another order of them. Our server Gustavo was really nice & attentive. I asked him for recommendations and he was very thorough in terms of what each of the top entrees had and made them delicious. For entree my boyfriend ordered the Bacalao (miso-tequila glazed cod fish) I'm not a big fan of fish, but tried it and hands down absolutely amazing flavor. It didn't even taste fishy. I ordered the Camarones Toloache, not a big portion but delicious.

Lots of interesting cocktails to choose from.Friendly service from the front door all through the meal, with managers stopping by as well several times.We shared the lobster/kale salad (8/10), scallop/quinoa (10/10) and cricket tacos (8/10 -- really tasty!).Seafood paella was really flavorful and a normal sized portion for one person. It had grilled octopus which you don't usually see; only the two iodine shrimp detracted. Another shrimp order was overcooked, but not iodine at least. The beef short-rib was amazingly tender and richly seasoned (or so my wife said, she finished it before I could grab a bite!). The Pollo Toloache was super juicy in a sweet/tangy pico de gallo.The ice cream with desserts were awesome and the plum tart was great.

Then when I asked for a table she said we had to be out by a certain time since they needed the table. Which to me personally was rude giving the fact that there were 4 other tables available plus the second floor which didn't have anyone. I ignored it since I was looking forward it the food here. The waiter was much nicer but the service was a bit slow I understood since a big party came in. We had the trio guacamole which was pretty good as other reviews stated but wasn't as great as I had expected. The food we order was bad it was pretty good but wasn't up to what I had expected.  The food portions were a bit small which left me a bit hungry. I guess if you order a bit of different things and share it would be better? Overall it was okay would I go back maybe for a light lunch one day in the distant future but not for dinner.

3.0,9/17/2014,"I'm generous so I rounded up - I really wanted to give this place 2.5 stars.

The tables were very close to eachother to the point where you can clearly hear other conversations next to you. For the price point of this place, I expected more space than a standard Chipotle.Service:Rather slow (which was ok b/c we weren't in a hurry but it was 4pm on a weekday so c'mon!). Our waiter was nice but when it came down to order our entrees we were told that half the menu was unavailable b/c of a kitchen issue. I was annoyed that we weren't told earlier b/c they had so many opportunities:-when we made the reservation earlier in the day-when we walked in and was greeted by the hostess (which by the way seemed very uninterestd in everything).-when our waiter took our drink & appetizer ordersFood/drinks:Drinks were goodFood was good but very small portions.

3.0,8/18/2014,"bf and I came here for an early dinner before Wicked, and Toloache is conveniently almost right next door to the theater. I'll start by saying they are EXPENSIVE! well we did get a couple of sangrias between the two of us($10 a glass and they DONT do pitchers). the bill came out to $295!(before tax or tip) and this is after my abysmal entree was comped (see below)I made a reservation thru the website and they seated us right away, but they seated us so close to the kitchen and bathrooms that my bf's chair was constantly getting bumped into and it was annoying. eventually a better table opened up in the middle of the floor and we asked the hostess if we could change tables, she was very accommodating. we started off with drinks and the guacamole which was delicious! really fresh and seasoned perfectly. for apps I had the lobster tacos -- VERY small for I think $17? and you get two itty bitty tacos. but those two bites were delicious. my bf doesn't eat meat and the choices were pretty limited, so he had a quesadilla which he really enjoyed. now entrees is where they lost us completely. my bf had the chefs version of a meatless paella with quinoa. GROSS. it had no taste and it was in such a tiny bowl with these large vegetables hanging out of it, just NO. I ordered the rib eye, and I ordered it medium rare. came to the table it looked great, I cut into it and it was well done, not just well done but so overcooked and charred to the point that it was making my mouth dry just chewing it. I'm really not one to complain or send back food so I just left it alone. well, one of the managers (I guess there's 3 of them??) noticed and came over to ask if everything was ok. my bf told him it was overcooked, he apologized repeatedly and said they will make me a new one (I really didn't want to make a fuss). he was even nice enough to take away my bfs meal and bring a new one so we could eat together -major points for that. so the new food came out pretty quick, he asks me to cut into it, I do and say it's ok (it wasn't). again it was so horribly dry and overcooked it was inedible, what a waste of a beautiful piece of meat and for $40 you think they could get it right . ANOTHER manager comes over because he noticed I wasn't eating, I tell him no no I'm just full (not wanting to complain) and he asks me honestly is it ok, and I say no it's overcooked and they offer me something else but at that point it really wasn't worth the trouble. they were really apologetic about it, even sending us over free dessert and shots of tequila. dessert was delicious. drinks were really expensive and not worth it. in the end they took the steak off the bill, which I would've been happy to pay for. definitely won't return because of the food inconsistencies. it just happened to be convenient before show time & that's probably what draws people in. it was pretty pricy - actually overpriced-  if the food had been all around excellent I wouldn't mind the bill. they definitely win major points for their excellent service though, the managers are really on top of making sure the customers are happy.

I might be wrong but I think it is listed as $$ on Open Table but it should actually be $$$, at least. We were two people, and we each had an appetizer, an entree, and two drinks each. It was close to two hundred bucks.Also, as is to be expected, the place was mobbed for every second that we were there, which was a Wednesday night around 6:30.

Para Empezar1) Ceviche de Pescado2) Tacos de Chuleta I would pick the ceviche de pescado over tacos de chuleta. The ceviche was presented beautifully. It tasted like it had a number of different seafoods. It was refreshing and different. The tacos were also good. But you can get similar tacos elsewhere, and it didn't have the wow factor the ceviche had. Plato Fuerte 1) Entrana Skirt Steak + Brussels Sprouts -- They had some kind of special sauce with the skirt steak and brussels sprouts. Overall, amazing amazing dish. But I do have to say my favorite part was the brussels sprouts-queso fresco ""salad"" (not really a salad, more like pan fried brussel sprouts). The queso fresco went really well with the dish. Dessert 1) Pastel de ChocolateThis dessert dish was really rich and for all you chocolate lovers, this is for you! For me, it tasted more like a cold, rainy day dessert and not what I was feeling for that day. But overall, great flavors.  2) Lemongrass Flan + Berries This dessert was refreshing and delicious.

With that said, being cold was probably the high point of this outing.   The food: tasty, ridiculously, small portions that were outrageously overpriced. Enough said.

Our waiter was fantastic. He waited on us hand and foot. We ordered the trio de guacamole. I didn't really care for the frutas guacamole, I'm just not even sweet things, it wasn't spicy at all. The traditional and rojo were great. $24 is very pricey for a sample of 3...We also tried the saudero tacos which were so good. The short ribs were tender, literally melted in my mouth.. Really small portion for $13. For our entrees, L ordered a steak and I had the beef short ribs. I think the short rib tacos were definitely tastier than my entree. I probably ordered 4-5 drinks for myself, I don't recall what I had, but they were all pretty good. Not enough to get me drunk though. The prices are a bit high, but I think the quality of the food surpasses what you can get at a cheaper Mexican restaurant. This is probably the best Mexican restaurant I've been to.

3.0,7/23/2014,"After watching ""Unique Eats"" a while back, we decided to check this place out since it was in the area. We ordered de lechon tacos, quesadilla de huitlacoche y trufas, callo de hacha and trio de guacamoles.The de lechon taco consisted of this suckling pig with crispy skin with a cactus salad and salsa verde. Not a fan of only one tortilla with kind of dry edges, but the crispiness of the pork was unique and enjoyable. However, it needed the guac and red sauce which was fine since we ordered the guac trio. I also kind of don't understand why everyone strongly recommended the trio. One type was fine. It was nice that the tortilla chips were refillable. My favorite guac would be the spicy. The tradicional guac needed more salt and felt bland. The frutas guac was interesting and my second favorite. The truffle quesadilla was also unique, but since it was not ""sandwiched"" like a usual quesadilla and just had cheese lay on top of it, it was pretty much like a tortilla chip. The flavors were there though with the blend of cheese, mushroom and truffle oil. The sea scallops with quinoa risotto was a very small portion. It wasn't too bad, but the quinoa risotto fell a bit short for me.Although the food wasn't too bad, I don't feel it was deserving of the prices. I can enjoy better Mexican food at better prices elsewhere. Reason I would try this place again is if I wanted to try the avocado fries, margaritas that many are raving about or if I'm ever adventurous enough to try the grasshopper tacos.",3,1,1,Jill R.,"New York, NY",533,91,479

2.0,7/21/2014,"This past Saturday (7-19-14) my husband & I decided to try Toloache for a pre-show dinner.  We are from the Boston area and have many fine Mexican restaurants near us & enjoy this type of food very much.  To start we had the chips & salsa.  The chips were not warm and the salsa had a metallic taste and ketchup consistency.  No chunky tomato or cilantro or lime- did not taste like freshly made salsa.  We both ordered the  Chicken Enchiladas  which were just ok.  The cold shredded chicken lacked seasoning and sauce was just bland in my opinion.  I had to request two sides of sour cream just to enhance it enough so I could get through it.  We also tried the avocado fries but weren't amazed by this item.  Making avocado unhealthy by frying it seems like a not a great idea.  For dessert, I ordered the flan for us to split & it was actually very good.  The service was excellent, our waitress was very attentive & the manager asked how our dinners were.  Toloache has a cool atmosphere & decor though wish I had known about the upstairs room as it would have been nice to sit up there & have a birds-eye view.  Definitely won't revisit.  I would give it an overall rating of B- but would like to emphasize that the service & atmosphere were great- probably a great place to meet for a margarita after work with friends.  Amazing that New Yorkers think this is good Mexican food.

I love Mexican food and this was on par with some of the best tacos I've had, but really...$12 for two tacos with a filling that I could consume in a single, albeit large, bite? I had to order a side of rice and beans to curb my appetite. Wonderful taste, but doubled my bill. Oh, and don't forget a $3 can coke portion (they pour it in a glass in the back). I quickly finished it before the main course came out and they asked if I'd like another. Sure! When the bill came I noticed that I had been furtively charged $6 for less than a 20oz bottle of coke. Cool. Add in my guacamole appetizer (also delicious) with a generous 20% tip and I'm now at $50+ for my drink, guacamole, two tacos, and rice+beans. Good food. Decent service.

On top of that, the food was excellent! Don't expect plain old cheese quesadillas and chicken tacos here.Choosing from the drink menu was not an easy feat. Everyone got something different, but I opted for house Margarita. SO GOOD.As usual, we split a bunch of dishes:Trio De Guacamoles (Traditional, Frutas, and Rojo)-After a while, they all start tasting the same but I had absolutely no complaints. The fruit one was the most unique, but my favorite was the rojo.Fried Brussels Sprouts and Avocado Fries-Portions were small, but they were sides so I wasn't too disappointed.

Started out with some authentic guacamole with a side of habanero sauce (we like it hot) and a couple of drinks......it was looking good. Service was fast and polite. We asked about the name of the restaurant and our waiter told us an interesting story concerning it's origin (you'll have to go to hear it). It was a scorcher outside so we downed plenty of water and it was consistently refilled. A lot of people don't mention or seem to care about drinks being taken care of but it's a pretty big thing for me.Finally, our entrees came out from the kitchen. They looked like fairly small portions but we dug in none-the-less. The amount to which I enjoyed this entree can only be compared to that first ice cold sip of beer by the pool after a hard day working outside, but for an entire meal. The table fell silent as we were lost for words....or just too busy stuffing our faces to talk. With our plates empty and our stomachs full we leaned back in our chairs and tried to comprehend what had just happened to us.

We ordered the ceviche trio (hamachi, crab meat, and yellowfin tuna) and each one was delicious and refreshing. Also, the frutas guacamole was awesome! I love guacamole and the addition of the fruits took it to another level. We also ordered the quinoa paella and the short rib tacos. The quinoa paella was actually quite flavorful (and presentation was cute) and the meat in the short rib tacos was SUPER tender!So what went wrong? Portion sizes!!! After ordering, we asked our waiter if it would be enough for us. He said maybe, because the only large item we ordered was the paella ($27). We decided to stick to our order, because if anything the paella should be filling. Well, when the ceviche trio came out, each portion was super small! But this wasn't such a big issue because it was an appetizer after all. However, when our paella came out, we were all taken aback. It was just a little bigger than the palm of my hand! I didn't understand what the waiter meant when he said that this was going to be a large dish. It was really off putting because it was like tapas size but with a huge price tag :( We ordered a side of avocado fries ($7 & delicious btw) and the portion was bigger than that of the paella! I am very confused.Other than that, service was friendly. I noticed that a lot of reviewers are raving about the authenticity of this place.

Also, I should mention I LOVE Mexican food- basically if a restaurant has guacamole I'm in!

We put our name down and THANK GOD 2 guys up at the bar, so we sat there and got a drink. FYI, we didn't move from that spot for like 3 1/2 hours! The bartenders were so much fun and were playing around with us and making us all these fun drinks.. I was having a blast!Then, the manager was buying us drinks and it overall was a really good time. We only had some appetizers, but everything we ate was delicious!!! THE GUACAMOLE WAS TO DIE FOR!!!They literally make the guacamole right in front of you.  If I remember correctly I think they had like 3 different kinds, and my friend and I ordered 2: the regular and the spicy.  Both were phenomenal. I really have nothing bad to say about this place! However, I do recommend you definitely make a reservation before you go because it was super crowded (I sent another friend there and they said it was packed also).  Also it is a little pricy so just keep that in mind, but it is really good!! Everyone was super friendly, and the bartenders were extremely outgoing!I would DEFINITELY recommend it here!!",1,0,0,Danielle B.,"Town of North Hempstead, Long Island, NY",1,5,0

3.0,5/17/2014,"Good food, but extremely expensive and small portions. I've never eaten four tacos in a row until I dined here.I had the most difficult time trying to order non-sparkling bottled water here. The waiter acted as if he's never heard of it in his life before. He brought out sparkling water, tap water and asked around the staff what I meant. It took a really long time, but I finally got non-sparkling bottled water but to add insult to injury, the bottle costs us $8. Lesson learned, just drink the damn tap water.Although the food tasted good, it didn't blow my mind and warrant the hefty prices. The portions were so painstakingly small that I wondered if I stepped into a tapas joint. I ordered the steak tacos entree, which turned out to be two very small tacos that you can finish in about two bites. I had to order another set of tacos, which took a while to get also. I ordered plantains as well, which definitely helped fill me up in place of the small tacos.There are thousands of restaurants in NYC, this is one you can skip if you're an out-of-town visitor.",1,0,0,Shirley J.,"Chicago, IL",525,329,891

The ingredients were super fresh and the flavor was great. For sides ordered Fried plantains, which could be the best I ever had and fried Brussels sprouts, queso fresco which were outstanding.

However, when we had asked how long we'd be waiting, the host said they're just waiting for a table to leave. Then 5 minutes later, we see someone else being seated. I asked about that and she said they had a reservation before us. That's completely understandable, but why make it seem like we were next in line when she could've just said after another reservation, then it would be us. In addition, when I asked how much longer would we be waiting, she just stated, we're waiting for a table to be cleaned. Well, how stupid did she think I was trying that on me again. So I asked whether I was the next table or if there were more people in front of us. And she just rudely repeated they were waiting for a table being cleaned. So I asked again. And again. And each time she rudely repeated the same thing. It wouldn't have been that difficult just to tell me if I were first in line or 5th in line. I've been a host before at a restaurant, and I know not to be that rude especially since it wasn't my fault at all. I wasn't blaming her for me waiting, I just wanted an honest answer.Oh and the food was fine. Guacamole and chips were fine. Guacamole fries were...basically fried pieces of guacamole.

But you know what? Once you get past the visual trepidation of eating something that looks like it crawled out of a crack in your kitchen wall, they're actually quite good. Fried up all crispy like with a hint of salt and apparently chock-full of protein. It packs a punch and it's certainly worth trying here at Toloache. Would I get them again? Sure - at least I know grasshoppers don't sit knee-deep in their own fecal matter while being pumped full of hormones like most meats that end up in my tacos.

Don't force yourself to choose.They serve 3 different kinds of guacamole, all $13 each. You can also do a trio for $24. We went with the fruta (avocado, pomegranate, Vidalia onion, mango, apple, peach, habanero, Thai basil). They called it medium spice. It tasted mild to me, but it was nonetheless delicious and very unique. And it was literally ready in one minute, as the bartender promised.

4.0,3/7/2014,"Really Really packed because it was a Friday night and because of the area it's in, but my party and I had a positive experience here. We celebrated my cousin's birthday here because of a friend's suggestion and we didn't really regret it. Here's the thing, this is not authentic Mexican cuisine. This is haute Mexican served in one of the biggest tourist traps in the country. Case in point: 8 of us racked up a $600 bill. And we didn't even order dish after dish. The food was fantastic though. The appetizers are not sized to share even though their prices suggest otherwise. We had their shrimp quesadilla (about the size of a very small plate), their guacamole and their ceviche. The shrimp was succulent and well prepared, the guacamole really lived up to the reviews and the ceviche was fresh.We were the glad the guacamole was good  considering it cost about as much as a full meal would in another restaurant, but the portions really are on the small side.Their bartenders are skilled enough but I only had a Tanqueray and tonic and a couple of their frozen mango margaritas. Those were also priced at the typical midtown price. We had brought a cake to the restaurant but were informed that if we wanted to eat it there, we would be charged a ""plate fee"" of $4 PER PERSON. That's quite a punishment for not ordering from their dessert menu, so we decided to save the cake for later.I ordered the Lechon Prensado, which was a really dense cut of ""baby suckling pig"" served on vegetables, and aside from the fatty skin being cooked to the point where you couldn't chew through it nor get through it with a steak knife, the meat was succulent and very well cooked. It's very loud in here so be prepared to raise your voices to have a decent conversation. Would I go back? Probably not. Would I miss it if I never went back? Nope. Do I think it's worth the money? Not at all. But if you don't mind paying it, you'll enjoy the food. Also, service was attentive and quite pleasant.",4,1,3,Hooney H.,"FLUSHING, NY",299,191,232

The staff was very cordial, the drinks were nicely made, and the dishes were charming. Taste-wise though, the seemed more fusion to me than Mexican. The grasshopper tacos looked great. They arrived crisped but were way too sour.

4.0,2/22/2014,"I came for restaurant week lunch and was impressed.  I was initially skeptical about going to a celebrity chef restaurant with multiple locations... But their restaurant week menu was quite generous and provide ample selections for all of us to choose from.Service is impeccable.  We never had to ask for water and the waiters and waitresses all had high energy, compatible for the restaurant.  Our plates are changed promptly.  The venue is very airy with the high ceiling and I was glad we got seated on the second floor.  They serve refined Mexican fare.  Much better than Don Caminos or Rosa Mexicano in my opinion.  We started with the spicy guacamole.  Not made table side but it was different with the chipotle smoky flavor.    I was able to finish my spinach salad with figs and goat cheese in less than 5 minutes.  That speaks for itself I think.  I don't know what kind of spinach they use but it was good.The Seabass was also perfectly cooked.  The skin is crispy and the flesh still silky.  Served over ratatouille like concoction.  The portion is just perfect for lunch.Maybe we were too full by dessert time, we couldn't finish the flan and tres leches.  The flan has a slight gritty texture I think so maybe they didn't temper the egg patiently.

3.0,2/22/2014,"Toloache offers good but not great Mexican food. Like other Yelp reviewers, I enjoyed the guacamole. Of the three versions (traditional, frutas, and rojo), the *frutas* was the most tasty and interesting. The medium-spice guacamole managed to balance a number of unique flavors (pomogranate, apple, basil, and vidalia onion) without becoming a sensory overload. The *ceviche de langosta*, which similarly incorporates a bold assortment of tastes (lobster, strawberry, avocado, yuzu, truffle and red onion), did not achieve the same harmony. To be fair, I almost always find it near blasphemy to use lobster in a dish that doesn't highlight the lobster's flavor. But, to me, this dish was a particular no no --- strawberry lobster? ick. For my main, I ordered the *pescado taco* (tilapia, jicama slaw, and guacamole) and the *camaron taco* (shrimp, hearts of palm slaw, and tamarind salsa). Each order comes with only 2 tacos, so definitely make sure to get two taco dishes if that's your main course. I liked both the pescado and the camaron taco. They weren't super flavorful, but the fish/shrimp was light and fresh. For dessert, I tried the pastel de chocolate, which was alright--your basic warm chocolate cake with ice cream. But, the stand out order at our table was the mexican coffee, which is spiced with cinnamon. A must try!The service was incredibly friendly. The staff pleasantly accommodated our table of 8--including two grandparents with walkers. The ambiance was lively and fun. But, the food was just good and, in NYC, you can definitely do better than that.",2,0,0,Margo L.,"New York, NY",219,93,4

2.0,2/20/2014,I had good expectations for this restaurant as I read the reviews and was really in the mood for some mexican food while visiting New York. But I got to tell you that I did not like neither the ambient nor was in love with the food. We decided to start with the chicken quesadilla which was ok but not even close to the best quesadillas I have or the one I can cook at home. Then I decided to try some tacos and my wife went for what was selled to be the daily especial which was a beef chilli. The tacos were ok but the beef was a shame. Not only the beef had nothing to do with chilli but it came with a huge amount of fat and nerves making almost impossible to eat it. After that we decided to leave and have dessert somewhere else. But not only the food was quite disappointing. The service was ok and the waiter was polite but they seat us on a table nearby the hostess desk which I dont have problems with as long as they dont keep taking people inside the restaurant that are waiting for tables right behind my chair. At the time I paid the check and decided to leave I could barely move my chair to stand up and leave. I believe my rating represents an expectation not well managed followed by a bunch of small mistakes made by the restaurant.

The dinning room has a upbeat city feel. A little tight but it worked.Food was very good and had some different choices. We started with a bowl of their house guacamole that was plenty and served with home made chips. Very fresh and good. My wife had walnut cream soup that she enjoyed very much.For entrees, my wife had skirt steak with roasted Brussels sprouts. She enjoyed it and the meat was cooked perfectly. I had the beef short rib. It was served with mole sauce that was well prepared and contrasted nicely with the quinoa that was roasted. Very good. The beef was more of a barbecue texture than braised, which was a nice change.For dessert we shared a sponge cake covered with mango cream icing with a raspberry sauce.

I was pleased. I ordered chips and salsa which was okay. The only thing was the salsa tasted like tomatoes blended with jalapeños. The food was pricey for Mexican food. I can get better Mexican food for less. It was bland and expensive for no reason. I ended up getting their red velvet tres leches. I think that's the only think I enjoyed but the cake didn't even taste like red velvet. It tasted like strawberry.

The portion was not huge but it was enough to satisfy me. The seafood was so fresh and flavorful! I was so impressed with how tender the octopus was, I thought I was eating cod! Meat lovers must try their Carne Asada. The skirt steak is tender, salty, and cooked just right. This was one of the times I wish I didn't have to choose between two entrees. Delicious sangria is almost a mandate at all Spanish restaurants, so make sure to try theirs!Out of all the upscale Spanish places (Dos Caminos, Pampano, Havana Central, etc), this one is definitely the best!!",2,0,0,Josephine Z.,"Queens, NY",787,445,182
5.0,12/16/2013,"If you read the three star and under reviews of this place, you will see one complaint that is common to almost every one - ""pricey for Mexican.""  I am kind of tired of hearing this.  In this country, people think Mexican food should be ultra-casual, fast, and ridiculously cheap.  Not always.  Mexican food rivals any ethnic cuisine in terms of flavor and sophistication, and I know I'm not the first person to make that observation.  Comparing this place to a taco joint - which a few people do on this page - is absurd.  This is high end food.  Would you compare Ray's Pizza to Babbo?  I went to this place tonight and the food and service were outstanding.  I had tacos de costilla, tacos de lechon, queso fundido, and a quesadilla with huitlacoche.  A Negra Modelo and an eponymous five star margarita with blueberry.  An excellent dessert (housemade strawberry ice cream/tres leches).  I was with two other people - Midtown Manhattan, we had a nice, filling snack of small plates, two drinks, and a dessert.  99 bucks.  That doesn't seem way out of line to me.Don't get me wrong, I believe that cheap but quality Mexican food is a joy to discover and to eat.  But please don't compare apples to oranges with a place like this.  Sorry.",3,0,2,Michael N.,"Bloomfield, NJ",52,101,2

5.0,12/4/2013,"Woah.... let me preface this review with a general statement about my restaurant picking tactics.  I always (ALWAYS) use Yelp! Generally though, I hate going to places that are in touristy areas.  I always feel like it's a trap, and the food will be mediocre at best.  So naturally when walking around Times Square, and stomach growling, and too far to get to the Village or Soho, I yelped and found this place with my sister.  The reviews were good, it was close by, so we went (breaking all rules by going somewhere with tourists running around everywhere).  Best decision of our day.  We walked in around 6:30-7pm, and there was no wait.  We were a group of 5 and we got seated immediately.  It was fantastic.  Given this is a Mexican restaurant, we all got margaritas.  I got the margarita with basil.  A little fizzy... but I enjoyed.  Warmed me up.  To start we got the trio of guacamole.  There was the mild, medium, and then the hot.  The medium one had pomegranate seeds in it.    Soooooo tasty.  I can't even decide which one was the best.  But those pomegranate seeds were such a great addition.  Gave it this nice crunch, and sweetness, which balanced out the slight heat from the jalapenos.  They also served this pureed tomato sauce on the side with the chips.  Super smoky and spicy!  LOVED IT.  I think we went through 3 little bowls.    It's a different take on plain chips and salsa. For our meals we got a bunch of tacos.  I stuck with the Saudero, which was braised brisket with a horseradish sauce.  They come 2 per order and on corn soft shells.  I thought mine was great.  The horseradish sauce was a great touch.  The meat was super tender and falling apart.  But then I tried the Costilla & Tuetano.  Yeah.... my tacos did not stand a chance against those bad boys.  We're talking short ribs with bone marrow.  Sounds weird, sounds not too appetizing?  Yeah, don't listen to those voices.  Be adventurous.    I believe in stepping out of the box.  I played it safe and went for my tacos because of the horseradish cream.  Silly me!  Although delicious, go for the other ones!!!  You won't regret it. So next time you find yourself in the theater district/Times Square... stroll into Toloache.  You won't regret it.",1,1,1,Jennifer P.,"Boca Raton, FL",113,113,79

Our waiter was knowledgable and helpful. He recommended fresh watermelon margaritas that were to die for. My husband had their signature suckling pig which was flavorful and juicy. I had the carne asada....a wonderful piece of skirt steak cooked to perfection that came with a cheese enchilada with mole sauce and guacamole...yummy!! Our friends shared a spicy lobster taco and some fish special that they loved.  The service was wonderful and even though they were packed we never felt rushed.

3.0,9/14/2013,"Went here on 9-13-2013. I like it. I didn't fall in love with the place because it was ultra touristy and very full. The service was great however the price was too damn high. I mean, I spend more than I should eating out and usually never complain about the bill unless my experience doesn't match up. In this case, it did not. The manager didn't even ask me how my meal was and did so for both of the tables next to me. Maybe because I'm not important but also maybe because he didn't care about my experience? (-1 star).The food price for two of us came to $91 not including gratuity (.5 star). I felt somewhat cheated because I don't think the portions justified the pricing. Of course I ordered the Fruit Guac as everyone here on Yelp recommends it. It was delicious and I don't mind paying $13 for Guac. Fine. It was fresh and tasty. Good job there. I ordered the Skirt-steak with the potato gratin and mole that comes with it. It was a lot better than my previous week's experience at Buenos Aires downtown in the East Village. A lot better. However, not the best I've had. (-.5 I wanted to really love this place. I came here two months ago and didn't have a reservation and did not feel like getting dinner at the  bar so I came back to try it. So many good reviews on yelp can't go that wrong right? Partially. It was better than average but had a lot of missing elements to it for the experience. I don't think I'll go out of my way to come back but I had to try it and I wasn't 100% disappointed but still felt cheated because the experience wasn't as great. For less than what I spent here, I could go to Patron in Hell's Kitchen and have a better time.  All-in-all, everyone should try it. The price is a bit of an issue for me but it's not going to clean me out. However, I did not like spending that much money on an average experience. 3/5 for Pricing4/5 for Ambience3/5 for Food 2/5 for Experience",2,0,0,Sajid Z.,"Bronx, NY",142,157,26

5.0,8/17/2013,"Another fantastic Restaurant Week menu - most of what I ordered is not found in their everyday menu, but the taste of the meals reflects the dedication of the restaurant in offering the best Mexican food in Manhattan. I had the Ceviche de Camaron as an appetizer: it had some spiciness that made the shrimp taste a lot better. For the main course, the Enchiladas de Carnitas, I was left savoring the taste of the cheese, tortilla, and meat as I finished the last bite; if that isn't on their regular menu, it should be. The dessert, the Flan, I later found out is one of the classics - and rightly so. Hands down one of the best flans I've ever had. Their drinks are also creative and great, I highly recommend the De La Calle Margarita (jalapeno in a margarita is a must-try).

The atmosphere is great too -- The dark wood and dim lighting transports you from downtown NYC to a small Spanish village.We started with the guacamole sampler, which was a smart choice. The four of us ended ordering a second round. While I normally opt for the spiciest of guacamole's, my favorite this time was the milder of the bunch, filled with pomegranate seeds. The chiptotle was my second favorite (although the color of the peppers turned the guacamole an unappetizing brown color).Margaritas are strong (but small) - you'll want at least 3 ;)For my main, I had the truffle quesadilla (which is normally an appetizer), and stole a chicken taco or two from my group. So good. The rice and bean sides was a great way to upgrade the quesadilla from appetizer to main entree status. The sides are BIG and definitely shareable.

This is no Sunnyside, Queens, nor is it California.The bf and I visited for weekend brunch on a rainy, dreary Sunday chiefly for the fact that we didn't want to make it downtown. Toloache was within walking distance, so I guess you could say we settled. Our meal was fine, including the guacamole rojo (sadly not at all spicy) and chips, his pork pozole, and my huaraches with chorizo and fried eggs. While I didn't find the guacamole to be very spicy, the portion was substantial enough that we still enjoyed it as a starter. At about $13, that bowl better have been substantial. Our mains were of decent size as well, although not exactly great in taste. Toloache suffers from a bit of an identity crisis in my opinion - the food kind of straddles the line between dingy bodega and new age taqueria. Sadly though, I don't think it achieves either of those identities. But hey, what do you really expect from a restaurant in the middle of tourist central?

Yes, Toloache is on the pricey side, but we didn't mind because the quality of the food and the service met our expectations. Best maragaritas I've ever had.  I downed my prickly pear margarita to build up some (wo)manly courage for what came next.Ok, the grasshopper tacos - they were interesting. Thank you, Toloache, for using dim lighting because I didn't really care to see all the buggy details of my dish. They were crunchy (obvious) with an earthy, almost mushroomy taste (not so obvious). They are marinated with lemon so there's also a sweet/tart taste to them. Overall, not bad, except for having a bug leg stuck between my back teeth throughout the meal...The waiter seemed impressed that we ate the tacos with such Zen (thanks margarita) that he told us most people would order the chapulines just to take pictures to upload on facebook, and then promptly ask the dish to be taken away completely untouched.

The shrimp ceviche was also an interesting take with chilis and peanuts.

My friend and I ordered the trio ceviche sampler for $27 to start. Sampler came with:-Ceviche de Langosta (lobster, strawberry, avocado, yuzu, black truffle, red onions) -Atun (Spicy yellowfin tuna, key lime, Vidalia onion, radish, watermelon) -Hamachi (yellowtail, Meyer lemon, cucumber, Huichol salsa, crispy avocado)It was fresh but three tiny portions for essentially $9 each? Oy. I could have gotten 3x the total amount of yummy ceviche at places like Pio Pio nearby for the same price! And by tiny I do mean tiny. I know I have a big mouth but I could have finished all of these dishes in 2-3 bites without even trying. Eating in public has its drawbacks. Still, I'm glad I got to try the ceviche though as I had heard conflicting reports on it. For our main dishes, we decided to get some tacos since the entrees like paella and skirt steak seemed too heavy for a quick bite. I ordered the Langosta Tacos (spicy lobster, morita salsa, avocado) and he ordered the Chicken Pollo tacos (chicken breast adobado, pico de gallo, manchego cheese). I think I expected more from my lobster tacos. At $19 they were underwhelming as I don't think the flavors popped at all. The rice and beans were just your average rice and beans with the beans a little watery than I would like.Overall the food is fresh and they have an interesting menu (hello grasshopper tacos?!) but for the sizes and the amount of money, I don't necessarily think it's worth going out of your way for.Note: Do not go here during lunch rush hours on the weekdays as it is crazy busy and filled with suits!",2,1,1,Leslie D.,"New York, NY",1565,656,1217

4.0,7/13/2013,"Why Come Here? Dodge the tourists and have a solid Mexican meal in the Theater DistrictRight Amount for 2: an app and 2 tacos or quesadillasAs New Yorkers, we do our best to avoid the ten block stretch of Midtown West filled with bright eyed tourists staring at brighter lights without a semblance of the appropriate speed to walk on a Manhattan street. But at some point, probably before taking in a show, you will be forced to enter Times Square and will need to satiate yourself in the surround environs. For most, this means sucking it up and eating either at a chain like Applebees or Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. or having an extremely mediocre pre-theater pre-fixe of the Italian of French variety. There are, however, a few legitimate options hidden in this culinary wasteland and Toloache is one of the best.Toloache comes from the team behind Yerba Buena and occupies a bi-level space closer to Eighth Avenue and therefore offers a little reprieve from the hubbub to the east. The interior is sort of Irish Pub meets Mexican restaurant with dark wood and mosaic tiles. The first level draws a decent size crowd at happy hour, but the upstairs provides a quieter option. Overall, it's nice enough for mom and dad but lively enough for a group a friends before a show.The food is best described as approachable gourmet Mexican. Think sections of Ceviche, Quesadillas and Tacos with toppings like shrimp, brisket and even grasshopper. Don't expect a massive helping, but with most smaller plates coming in at $15 it's a moderately priced option for the area. From what I've seen on two visits, you can't really go wrong on this menu or with any of their signature cocktails. And the tortilla chips are freshly made and among the city's best. Below are my top picks:Rojo Guacamole (2/4) If you like Chipotle in your guac, you'll be very happy you started your meal with this. Split if with a friend and order some tacos and you've got a solid meal for about $20 a head.Costilla & Tuetano Tacos (3/4) The unexpected combination of short ribs, bone marrow and thai basil produced a flavor thats rich and spicy but refreshing.Quesadilla de Cameron (2/4) A nice blend of sweet and spicy with the pineapple salsa balancing the chili de arbol.",3,0,0,Jay Z.,"Manhattan, NY",156,126,0

2.0,7/2/2013,"Came here with a group of 10 last year. Atmosphere was a little dark for our liking, and it was too crowded to carry on a conversation. Plus there's only one bathroom in the entire restaurant. Menu is very Asian-Mexican fusion, with items like Adobo marinated japanese eggplants and exotic ones like Oaxacan-style dried grasshoppers. Price is pretty steep compared to quantity of food. $15 guac could be split amongst 2 people, not 5. I got a Quasadilla de Camaron with shrimp, chili del arbor salsa, onions, and pineapples. Like a Hawaiian-Mexican style pizza. It tasted a bit sour, probably because of the pineapples and the salsa.I was amazed by the simpleness of this dish - basically it was ingredients scattered on what appeared to be a thin layer of tortilla bread. All this for $13? Not worth it. Berenjena Adobada, which is the Adobo marinated Japanese eggplant, lentils, sweet plantain, and achiote-habernero salsa. I tasted a bite of her eggplant, was pretty good though.Bottom line: Not worth the hype.",3,1,1,Vivian L.,"New York, NY",621,27,459

Though none had Chocolate, which I was hoping for after Chef Medina's Mexican Chocolate challenge on Iron Chef.

2.0,6/12/2013,"After reading the reviews and the Zaget ratings, I was extremely excited to try Toloache.  I LOVE Mexican.Basically the food is pretty good, but far form the top Mexican in NYC.  We split the guacamole (above average), shrimp quesadilla (awesome), and queso fundido (nothing special) as appetizers.  For an entree, I had the Short Ribs, which had an amazing presentation but lacked some pizzazz/flavor.  My mother had the Carne Asade, which she liked (it came with an enchillada that I tried and thought was rubbery).  My brother had the carnitas, which was definitely the best dish on the table.The ambiance and the price were really the negative things about the Toloache.  First off, the place is just too expensive for the quality of food served, the portion size, and the dining experience provided.  The ambiance is very loud.  Upon arrival, we were squished into a corner 4-top which was seemingly impossible to wiggle out of to use the restroom.  When requesting a different table, we could not be accommodated (even though we had a reservation).  Additionally, the AC was blowing on me the entire dinner to the point that I had goosebumps and it really tainted my meal.  After requesting it be lowered a couple of times, and the waiter telling me it ""was"", I just gave up.Overall, the food was okay, but I would not recommend.",3,0,1,Jennifer C.,"Manhattan, NY",191,327,14

We had the ceviche de langostino, black truffle quesadillas, tacos de tuetano&costilla (bone marrow and short ribs tacos) and we has crepas con cajeta for dessert. Everything was sooo delicious and flavorful. CEVICHE DE LANGOSTINO: citrusy goodness. So refreshing. Had strawberries and guacamole in it and surprisingly everything ingredient complemented each other really well. QUESADILLAS: really small and it is open-faced. Really delicious with some black truffle sauce and sweet corn on top. Kinda hard to mess up cheese, corn, and black truffles. Did I mention it's really small?TUETANO&COSTILLA TACOS: Two bite-sized tacos. SPICY! There is Thai chile mentioned somewhere in the ingredients but it wasn't spicy to the point that my mouth is burning and i can't taste anything. It has bone marrow and short ribs that are well-seasoned and bursting with juice and fat. We both had to wipe our mouths afterwards. Sooo tasty and good! Probably my favorite dish out of everything we ordered. CREPAS CON CAJETAS: I ordered this because my friend did not want anything chocolate. I did not know what to expect ordering this but this was really great way to end dinner. It comes out with two triangles of stacked warm caramel crepes and a dollop of banana ice cream. The crepes had a hint of goat milk flavor which made it interesting and the ice cream was refreshing even though it wasn't a sorbet. When you think of caramel and banana you would immediately think it would be overly sweet but it wasn't cloying at all. There was a birthday party going on upstairs and service was a bit slow at times, and may be I went home a bit hungry but overall I had a good experience at this restaurant.

Be prepared for crowded tables and lots of noise, as this is not the place for an intimate dinner.I had heard that the restaurant was pricey and served small portions. ""Si"" for the former, but not so much for the portion size. The issue is really with the tacos... the menu tells you that you get two small tacos, but I suspect a lot of visitors see the price and miss the fine print and think their tacos are a Tex-Mex meal. They are not.We ended up ordering more food than we could eat, so don't go overboard.The guacamole trio was a great start, with three medium-sized bowls: traditional, fruit, and spicy red. My husband preferred the spicy, but I thought the traditional was best.We continued with lobster ceviche and the famed (feared?) grasshopper tacos. The ceviche was well done, one of the best I've had. The grasshopper tacos weren't as intimidating as I imagined, but the flavor just didn't do much: dry, and overly spicy salty.For our main courses, we had a chicken mole and the carne asada. I thought the carne asada was good, but my husband declared his mole the best he'd ever had.We had a nice selection of margaritas to accompany: a bit on the small side, but very tasty.Overall, a good spot for upscale, more traditional Mexican fare in the theater district.",0,0,0,Brian A.,"San Jose, CA",5,56,5

2.0,5/6/2013,"My friend and I definitely dropped the sombrero on this one. We came here last night for dinner, which was a huge mistake. It was a total Cinco de Nightmare! Setting aside the obnoxious mariachi players, the rushed service, and the crowd, perhaps this place, on any OTHER day, would deserve 3 stars. Regardless, the food wasn't all that great. I was really disappointed as I am a fan of Julian Medina's Yerba Buena. DRINKS: As soon as I sat down I was kamikazed by the waitress with the drinks menu and ordered the prickly pear frozen margarita [$11] in haste. It was actually very good, sweet but with a strong alcohol flavor. I was also surprised by its smooth consistency much unlike the cheap frozen margaritas you'd find at Dallas BBQ. FOOD: My friend and I shared the Guacamole Trio [$24] which included the traditional [mild], frutas [medium] and rojo [spicy]. The traditional was VERY mild and could have used an extra pinch of salt and pepper. The frutas variety was very heavy handed on pomegranate. I failed to see the apple, mango, or peach in it. The rojo one tasted fine, though not nearly as spicy as it could have been. Aesthetically, it was really unappetizing due to the chipotle queso fresco, which made the guacamole look like it sat outside for a day or two [that unappealing brown color]. The chips were unremarkable. The bright spot though was the salsa which I found to be really tasty. The waitress literally grabbed all the plates in a hurry and as she cleared the table pretty much asked [or stated] that we were done. For an entree, I had the Lechon Prensado [$26]. The flavors were interesting, the avocado puree was just.....mushed up avocado, the lechon was dry and flavorless, the baby vegetables were pickled [and you can't really screw that up], but I was thrown [as other people seem to be] by the inclusion of the baby corn [or we Chinese Food or Mexican or do we have a food identity disorder?] We also shared the avocado fries [$9] which were perhaps the saving grace of this meal. They're essentially deep fried avocado slices accompanied by a dipping sauce. Though for the price point, there were not nearly enough. The sweet plantains [$5] were mushy and cut unevenly so that one was thin and burnt while another was hard and undercooked. Not worth it. They didn't have the regular dessert menu and were trying to pawn specials. We passed. The bill came to $100 including my drink.

4.0,5/3/2013,"This was my second visit to Toloache in the past few months.  It's a great alternative to the abundant Italian options in the theater district.  The first time I dined here with my parents after a show and this time with a larger group of 6 before a show.  Unfortunately, tunnel traffic was not on the side of my dining companions this time and they arrived 45 minutes late to our reservation.  The staff of Toloache was very understanding and accommodating and the waitress ensured we would be good to go for our show (which was now in under an hour).Food: On my first visit we sampled the guacamole tradicional and were all pleased with it and the second time around we had the trio of guacamole.  All three guacs were delicious, especially the rojo, however, they could have given us a bigger basket of chips as we ran out but still had plenty of guacamole left over.  For my main course I had the Camarones Toloache.  The portion size was perfect with 5 huge shrimp on a crispy tortilla covered with a flavorful creamy sauce.  Two of my dining companions had the same thing, two had the Carne Asada, and one an order of tacos.  All the entrees were a hit.  I had the Carne Asada the last time and was very pleased with it.Drinks: Order a drink! It doesn't have to be a margarita.  There was a mix of drinks ordered around the table and everyone was pleased with them.  I ordered the prickly pear margarita both times and loved it.  Bonus: they are STRONG!Overall, Toloache is a great find in an often overcrowded and touristy area.  Yes, the restaurant is tiny and you'll have to move out of the way of the waiters and other patrons once in awhile but Toloache provides a unique and high-end spin on Mexican cuisine without breaking the bank.  The location is great for shows, the service is quick and attentive without hovering and the food is inventive and delicious.",2,1,1,Alexandra K.,"Jersey City, NJ",228,149,538

3.0,4/19/2013,"Very small portions for the amount you pay. It's the most I've ever paid for Mexican food in relation to portions (yes, I am including Rosa Mexicano too). I had the carnitas tacos (stated it was appetizer size) but two small tacos with no sides for $15, come on. My girlfriend had a quesadilla. We shared a lobster ceviche which was outstanding, but again, we only ate 2-3 small bites of lobster each. Where's the rice and beans on the side? And $12 for chips and guacamole? Cocktails are inventive and fruity. Not enough alcohol, though.Dined in the upstairs section. Seating was very close together.

At $60/person we shouldn't have left hungry, even in touristy Times Square.  We had a reservation which they barely honored although we were on time. That was a problem as there is nowhere to stand.

They have a fruity guac that looked interesting, but I was feeling the savory. The margaritas were also very yummy.-Fun atmosphere. The decor reminded me of fancy-ish Mexican restaurants I went to as a kid. Kind of kitsch-y and ridiculous, but still fun.-Relatively quiet. Granted, I went on a Monday night, so I'm pretty sure that had something to do with it.The meh:-Ridiculously small portions for high prices. My friend and I split the quesadilla and tacos, and we were pleasantly full, but not stuffed. Which is always neat when you aren't spending a lot of money. We got the quesadilla with truffles, and it was really good, HOWEVER, it was the smallest quesadilla I've ever eaten in my life. Only one tortilla, some cheese and truffles, all for $15.-A little too close to Tourist Square for my liking.Glad I tried it, but likely will visit other Mexican restaurants instead of returning back here.",0,0,0,Amanda S.,"Brooklyn, NY",351,210,9
4.0,2/27/2013,"Absolutely love the food here.  They are a big reason why I've put Rosa Mexicano behind me.  It's not that the food at RM is bad, but rather you get roughly the same quality here but at a somewhat lower price point.Where to start?  I'm a fan of pretty much most of their menu.  Can't say enough about their tasty enchiladas, excellent ceviches, flavorful guacamole, awesome tacos, and the big surprise, their incredible corn on the cob.  I always make a point of ordering this no matter what.  It's that good, right down to the last tender kernel.  Drinks here are also pretty solid.  Their mango mojitos are deadly.  I always end up drinking way too much of this, but it's so worth the hangover.  Margaritas are also decent.  I docked a star because the seating here (especially on the first floor) is pretty tight.  It also gets mad crowded here at times, which partially explains why the service can be painfully slow at times.Unfortunately this place is no longer a theater district secret.  People flock here and for good reason.  Just leave yourself enough time in case service gets slow before you need to catch a show.  The convenient location will definitely be a plus for theater-goers looking for a great place to eat before the show.",15,12,13,Kevin W.,"Manhattan, NY",1288,747,1083

If your ordering tacos you have to order 2 selections because they are 2 tiny tortillas. Drinks are in small glasses so you will order about 3 each over the meal. Whenever you go out for Mexican you expect to be full and drunk, and you can do that here, but its going to cost you because you have to order more than you would think.

4.0,2/24/2013,"This is a restaurant I really want to hate.  It's smack in the middle of the Times Square Theater district, always noisy and crowded, and expensive, which, when accustomed to nibbling one's way around the latino neighborhoods in Freehold and Lakewood NJ is tantamount to sacrilege.  I can't though.  The food and service here is fantastic and while the atmosphere leaves something to be desired, the decor does not.Drinks here are a bit on the pricey and small side, but are balanced by being ridiculously good; It is scarily too easy to tack on an extra hundred dollars to your tab in drinks alone.  One of the best selections of tequilas and mezcals to be found anywhere.  Decor is cozy and relaxing with lots of colorful tilework and pretty lanterns.  It doesn't hurt that the glass stars remind me of those on the rooftop restaurant Cafe Luna, at the Little Arches hotel in Barbados.  And, it bears repeating, the food is fantastic.  I've loved every dish I've had, but the tacos de pescado (fish tacos), are a particular favorite and it's hard to not order them every time we visit.  We refer to them as eye-rollers as the lucky recipient of these morsels will unconsciously roll their eyes back into their heads in ecstasy at the first bite, much like a great white shark in a feeding frenzy.  Another favorite is the cafe de olla (cafe brewed in a clay pot, hence the name, flavored with superfine sugar, orange and spices), which is delicious ambrosia as is, but even better with a shot of perfectly matched tequila.  Service is surprisingly warm and attentive.  You'd expect a place with a revolving door clientele of theater-goers not particularly concerned with attracting regulars, and therefore cutting corners on service, but Toloache is the exception; I always look forward to returning.",1,1,1,Bechi C.,"Howell, NJ",25,83,25

3.0,2/21/2013,"If possible, we would actually rate the restaurant 3.5-stars but we decided to decrease it to 3 because of the rude host and slow service.Toloache was our first experience at a higher-end Mexican restaurant and the food did not disappoint. Again, the overall 3-star rating was mostly for the price (expensive for small servings) and the service (very slow). Also, the hosts were extremely rude--it's a very crowded restaurant with tables right next to each other so be prepared to get pushed around and be able to hear your neighbor's conversation. Food: The guacamole had rave reviews but for us, it was nothing special. We only tried the regular guacamole but the other two options (chipotle and fruit) looked interesting and worth a shot next time. As for the small plates and entrees, the shrimp tacos are a must-try!! The dish was absolutely delicious and the shrimp was very moist and tender. It is definitely the best shrimp tacos that we have ever tasted. Other notable dishes were the lobster tacos and the skirt steak entree. The skirt steak was cooked to perfection (we prefer medium raw) and was very juicy. I can imagine that the skirt steak tacos would be just as good.Drinks: We had a couple of red sangrias which complimented the meal and were delicious. The red sangria actually comes un-mixed where you see the lemonade and red wine poured separately but this does not take away from the taste.Dessert: Unfortunately, we did not get to try the desserts as we were pressed for time but they had quite a few options both traditional Mexican and non-traditional. We did overhear diners nearby complimenting the richness of the desserts so we would certainly try it next time.All in all, if it were not for the high prices and small servings, we would have given the restaurant 3.5-4 stars.

2.0,1/12/2013,"Let's start with the three people--the hostess, the person who seated us, AND our waiter, all reminding us we had to vacate our table by 6:30PM. We knew that when we made the reservation, so the reminders were not necessary nor particularly welcoming. Still, reviews we'd read here on yelp made us hopeful about the food. We were horribly disappointed. Fruit guacamole did not have any spiciness, even though it was supposed to have habaneros in it. The ceviches had only microscopic bits of fish, and the yellowtail one was oily and not fresh, smelled and tasted fishy. The fish taquitos, two teensy ones for some exorbitant price ($13, maybe?) disappeared in two bites (but they _were_ good). Soft tacos were also small and overpriced, the brisket one flavorful but cubed and messy, not shredded as our waiter informed us; the shrimp and garlic one was iodine-y tasting. The huitlacoche tacos and quesadillas were okay but also small. We stopped there--no entrees, desserts or coffee--paid $160 for four people for basically nothing, and went out to Burrito Box on 9th Avenue. They have beautiful Mexican hanging lamps here, and tasty chile/lime salt rimming their drinks. Those are the nice things I can say about this place. My two stars are a generous rating, but it's a clean and attractive place, albeit REALLY LOUD and touristy.",0,0,0,Julietta A.,"Mount Kisco, NY",1,12,0
5.0,1/8/2013,The Spicy Guacamole was monster good. My wife had the arugula salad appetizer and the sea bass entree.  Both were excellent.  I had the halibut ceviche which was good but needed a couple more grape tomatoes for my taste.  I had the skirt steak done medium and it was perfection.  It came with a spicy steak sauce that I'm going to have to try and duplicate at home.  Dessert was chocolate flan with strawberries for me and the peach crepes for her.  Mine was incredible and hers was just great...

I say tapas since the entrees aren't that filling. It's good for a girl with a light appetite, but would probably just be a tease for a guy. But that doesn't mean they aren't good. A each of us tried something different from the food and drink menu. Definitely will come back for the drinks, short-rib tacos, and the flan.

LOLOf course, we had to try their margaritas.  I had a traditional margarita on the rocks, and Mom ordered the Hibicus Blueberry Margarita.  She did let me have a sip of her drink.  Both margies were really good so we ordered one more to share.  Also, I received a complimentary shot of premium tequila by checking in on Foursquare - SCORE!The service was good, and overall we had a great time at Toloache.  My only critique would be the prices: $13 for the guacamole appetizer, $13 for two shrimp tacos, and $17 for the lobster tacos, then add in a few cocktails (at $13 ea.) plus tax and tip and you've spent a benjamin easily! I would've like to try some other items on the menu but my wallet was NOT having it.  So, if you plan to dine at Toloache be prepared to spend some major dinero.  You won't be disappointed...",2,2,0,Adrienne M.,"New York, NY",55,66,5

It has this Mexican them of course, since it is a Mexican restaurant after all, but they have a lot of foliage which I love.  They used cactuses and lovely flowers to decorate the place.  The service is really friendly.  Our server was very attentive up until he kept mixing up our drinks.  It wasn't a problem though because he gave us what we ordered so we simply switched them around after he left so he didn't feel bad.   GUACAMOLE - First we started off with the guacamole.  This is a food item that all my girlfriends and I have a huge appetite for always so we're expecting some good guacamole after reading the reviews on Yelp.  Sadly, we were let down.  Where was the tang?  Where was the kick?  Where was the burst of flavor?  The guacamole did have this smokey flavor which was interesting.   Get this though - it was was like $13!!!  Are you kidding me?!  Maybe it's because I'm from VA where avocados are cheap???  LOL I don't think so... last time I checked they're imported here the same way they are imported to NY I'm sure lol.  Guacamole takes about 10 minutes to make and a portion for a party of 6 would require 2 avocados...pretty sure it should be no more than $5-$7 including profit.  When I make it or even when one of my girlfriends makes it it would taste 10x better. TACOs - This was a whole other story.  These were amazing!  I had the fish tacos, my friends had the beef marrow tacos, shrimp tacos, and lobster tacos.  All were wonderfully prepared and so delicious.  I think my favorite was the beef marrow one. If you go here you HAVE to get the tacos.  So good!DRINKS - these were amazing.  I think I'd come back for their drinks and tacos. Their red sangria was so good.  I had a margarita that had blood orange in it and it was amazing.  They have very unique margaritas.  FLAN - this was really good and tasted really custardy (if that's even a word).  It was so yummy.  DISAPPOINTMENTS - Charged $1.50 for getting hot sauce...what?!  There was seriously a spoonful in our condiment bowl.  It was crazy.  Also, a friend of mine got the cheese quesadilla with mushrooms and discovered that they had charged her an extra $2 for adding the mushrooms when it didn't say on the menu that it was an extra charge.  $2 is not a big deal but it definitely makes the customer feel misled.  Again, the gauc was disappointing.

3.0,12/16/2012,"Came here on a Thursday for lunch and the place was packed! Luckily, we only had to wait for 10 minutes for a table of 5. Toloache is a loud and higher-end Mexican restaurant with a large menu of food and drinks. SPICY ROJO GUACAMOLE ($13): Based on the reviews, we had to try it. However, we were very disappointed because the guacamole wasn't spicy at all and lacked flavor. I believe it needed more lime and onions... the portion was small as well.  SOFT TACOS: We ordered a large variety to try: Costilla & Tuetano (beef short ribs and bone marrow $16), Camaron (shrimp $16), Pescado (tilapia fish $16), and Langosta (lobster $19). All were delicious! My favorite was probably the shrimp because it was very tender and juicy. Each dish came with beans and rice. However, for the price, I believe that the tacos should have come with 3 instead of 2 because I was barely full.FLAN ($9): Like others mentioned, the flan was amazing! It had a great thick texture, the caramel sauce was just the right amount of sweetness, and the strawberries on top added a nice touch. No complaints!Our group tried a bunch of drinks as well. Both the red and white SANGRIA were delicious with plenty of fruit. The cocktails with tequila and rum were strong but still tasty!Overall, service was friendly and attentive but we were disappointed that they charged extra for things that they shouldn't have such as hot sauce ($1.50 for a tiny spoonful whattt?).

All were excellently made and they were strong enough if you know what I mean, but not overpowering with the alcohol.We ordered skirt steak and some other steak dish with a side of plantains. The steaks were cooked perfectly and the sides with the skirt steak (gratin and I ordered some rice instead) were so good! I have zero complaints with the food. I'm a sucker for skirt steak therefore extremely critical, but it was really delicious. My mouth is watering just thinking about it!For dessert, we ordered the churros with the different dipping sauces. They were so good.. I just wish they gave me a dozen churros.

We were meeting friends for the first time at this restaurant so we have no other experiences to base it off of.  The menu is ""Mexican"" but the recipe is far from Mexican food. The quality of ingredients were fantastic but it's as if San Francisco or NorCal got ahold of a Mexican restaurant and said ""ok let's make everything as healthy as possible"". So there are definitely interesting plates and entrees.  But the serving size of the entrees are absolutely ridiculous. And by that I mean the entree is literally what you'd expect as an appetizer.  And the appetizers couldn't even satiate a single person. The guacamole serving size was atrocious.  It was decent at best. The Atun (tuna type ceviche) was good, but it was for the size of a single person.  The pescado tacos were actually good and a decent size. The ""enchiladas"" were literally toddler sized flatbread/thin crust pizzas with some ingredients.  The prices were far too high for the serving size of the food.

In addition, I was charged for mushrooms which were supposed to be included in my entree. When I inquired with the waiter he gave me a bogus excuse and said it was an error on the menu. The extra money wasn't the issue, although I felt that he should've taken it off since it is their fault. I just wished they would inform their customers about charging for silly things like hot sauce and more importantly not charge for things which are supposed to be included in the entree.

Things I liked:1) Guacamole. Freshly made, extremely flavorful, and served with bottomless chips. We ordered the tasting trio and everyone agreed it was awesome. 2) Great selection of tequilas and mezcals. I'm not a connoisseur, but 100+ of anything is a lot. The tequila drinkers in my group were happy.  I was a little confused as to why my margarita on the rocks was room-temperature, but the flavor was fine. 3) Good service. Our party of 12 was a few minutes late. We called ahead to let them know we were running behind and they were still able to accommodate us. +1 for customer service. We were waited on well all night.   4) One of the better options in the gastronomic wasteland that is Midtown West. Things to keep in mind: 1) The crowd. It definitely catches the pre-theater and Times-square runoff, so probably not a great place to take seasoned New Yorkers or people who want a leisurely, lingering dinner. 2) It's LOUD. It was pretty hard to talk to be honest, and we were sitting very close together. It was also loud in that everyone-is-talking way, not a this-music-is-so-clubby way (ahem, STK)!3) Actual food was only OK. We had 5-10 of the tacos (nothing to write home about), the queso fundido (just cheese in a pan) and several of the quesadillas (the shrimp one was one of the better ones).

5.0,10/26/2012,"I cannot emphasize how much I am in love with this place. What a gem. The SO and I went here for dinner the night before I was leaving NYC for the west coast, and it was AMAZING. I should start by saying that, until having dinner at Toloache, my favorite Mexican spot in NYC was Rosa Mexicana. Now that I've been here, I'll never go back to RM.The atmosphere here is great. It's loud enough to fill silence, but quiet enough to have an intimate conversation without shouting. There are candles on the tables, which are cheesy, but they add to the intimate atmosphere.Let's start where our meal started: guacamole. Now, we weren't really feeling the fruity guac, so we ordered just the spicy variety. It was some of the best I've had, ever.Next came our margaritas. Tonight, they had a guava special drink that was TO DIE FOR. I'm a margarita freak, and these were up there on my list of best of all time.Main courses were on par with the rest of the meal (although I think this is the only area where Rosa Mexicana beats Toloache). I had the Pollo Toloache, and the SO had Enchiladas Borrachas. Both were quite good.We finished off our meal with Churros, which, of course, were great, as well.I'll certainly be back next time I'm in the city.",3,0,2,Andrew B.,"Irvine, CA",17,151,1

I have to say these were probably the most interesting and creative variations on guacamole we had ever tried and we loved them all. I'm not normally a fan of the mango but gobbled up the fruit inspired one. We also had the queso fundido which definitely isn't ""light"" fare but was pretty darn delectable.

It would be hard to go wrong with the menu they have, but I highly recommend the camaron tacos and enchiladas borrachas (pulled chicken with tomatillas salsa, cheese, and crema). We also had the chips and guacamole and the sopa de tortilla.I would order everything again in a heartbeat with the exception of the tortilla soup, which was disappointing in the context of the rest of the great meal.

The tacos had two kinds of mushrooms, along with cactus, cheese and nice spices. They were flavorful, but too salty. Both of them were gone in literally 6 bites.

3.0,8/29/2012,"After my fiancee had Toloache for dinner at work one day, she insisted that I come out and try them. We wandered through Times Square to end up in the middle of the Theater District at this nice spot right off 8th Avenue. There's a good amount of seating inside, and it was easy to get a seat at the odd hour (around 4:30 PM) that we showed up at. Service was very quick, and the server was very useful in explaining the dishes, along with his personal favorites.I didn't do anything too special drinks-wise, but they do have a decent selection of margaritas and tequila. My fiancee had a lemonade, which is a bit on the pricey side ($5), but it tastes very fresh and a little more natural (probably because it has a good amount of lemons and limes in the cup). The standard guacamole is a bit pricey for the size - I feel like you get more bang for your buck at a place like Dos Caminos, but it was still pretty delicious and, as always, deceptively filling. We split 3 different types of tacos - the braised brisket, the fish, and the spicy lobster. Far and away, my favorite tacos were the braised brisket - the beef was extremely tenderized and melted in my mouth, The lobster was pretty good as well, although it's not the most tender lobster meat I've had. The fish was pretty standard; while the tilapia was plenty flaky, the sauce in the taco definitely was the main contributor of flavor to it. For dessert, we sampled the churros, which were crispier than expected. The cinnamon and chocolate dip were pretty flavorful, but I wouldn't say the dessert was worth the price.Toloache is a bit on the overpriced side - the tacos aren't huge, and 2 tacos will probably cost around $15 on average. I'd come back and try some more of the tacos, but for what we spent (close to $100 on the above after tip) - it's not a place that I would make a regular habit of visiting. Considering that there are probably trucks or joints like Brooklyn Tacos that can give you comparable portions for much cheaper, I'd probably be more inclined to spend my money there. Good flavors, but the price is a bit off-putting.",2,0,0,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",371,1653,169
3.0,8/29/2012,"Toloache is near Times Square on 50th between 8th Ave and Broadway.  Toloache's menu is divided into the following small plate categories: Guacamole $13; Ceviche $14-$15; Soups and Salads $9-11; Quesadillas $12-$15; and Tacos $10-$17.  These plates are meant as appetizers but some like the Guacamole and Ceviche may be ordered as a sampler and this is best if with a group.   Toloache's main plates range from $18 - $32.I first ordered the red sangria. Unfortunately, Toloache does not serve this by the pitcher so beware how quickly the tab will add up, because they are good and you are going to want more. We started with the Guacamole sampler ($24) and of the three, all of us liked the ""Rojo"" best. After the Trio de Guacamoles were cleared we ordered a tasting of three different Ceviches ($27).  The chef included a special ceviche for us which was not on the menu and included fish from the special plate of the night.  This turned out to be my favorite because of the inclusion of mango, but all three were tempting.For my main dish, the waiter talked me into the ""Tumbada"" ($27) which is described as Veracruz-style paella.  The seasoning was perfect and the rice was delicious but the shrimp and fish in particular were over cooked and bit dry. If I were to go back again (based on the plates I saw being served) I would try the Camarones Tolache ($26) or Carnitas de Lechon ($26).The prices are in line with what one might expect from a NYC restaurant.

I made reservations on OpenTable to be safe but it wasn't necessary as there were a several open tables when we arrived. The restaurant was dark but had a distinct cantina-like feel to it. The menu was simple and broken out by appetizers/soups, tacos (though appetizer sized), entrees and desserts. Since it was late, we opted for a light dinner, consisting of spicy traditional guacamole, tacos and avocado fries. The guacamole tasted fresh and had a decent kick though it was a little heavy on the tomatoes and needed more flavor. I ordered the skirt steak tacos which consisted of two small flour tortillas, a small serving of steak and small cubes of avocado. The flavors were incredible but I was left craving more. My friend ordered the shrimp tacos and while she claimed they were good, she didn't completely finish the meal. We ordered a side of avocado fries which consisted of strips of avocado breaded in panko and fried. My friend wasn't a huge of fan them, but I found them rather unique and delicious - the avocado clearly fresh with the perfect amount of seasoning and very lightly fried. In retrospect, I wish I would've had more. Overall, the meal was good though a little overpriced with the final bill coming to around $50...which is expected of any decent restaurant in midtown.

Other than these, you might be disappointed with both quality and quantity. I had once quesadilla with beef and bbq sauce.

I'm not usually one to eat in times square because it is way to crowded and over flooded with tourists, however I decided to give my mom a break and did my yelp search for the area. We were both craving Mexican so we settled on Toloache. Since its between 8th and Broadway its a tad bit away from the craziness of center of times square. That was a plus. We enter into the beautifully decorated restaurant and it was PACKED. The waitress informed us that it would take about 15-20 mins, not too bad. I had completely forgotten that restaurant week has also started so I'm sure most of the crowd was because of that. Anyways, we decided not to order off the restaurant week menu but it looked pretty good. Both of us don't really eat much so we decided to split an appetizer and a entree. We first got the garlic shrimp tacos. The portion was a lot smaller than we anticipated. The tacos come out as two tiny little things,  but nevertheless It was delicious. For our entree we got the paella type dish, and it was definitely enough for one person, even two people to share. It was also very good. I was still not full so I ordered another taco dish - chile skirt steak taco.

5.0,7/16/2012,"One of my favorite restaurants in Manhattan. If you're looking for some unique Mexican food, you can't go wrong with Toloache. Best guacamole I've ever ordered (my personal favorite is the ""frutas""), and you've gotta try the huitlacoche (aka ""corn smut,"" a plant fungus that sounds a lot worse than it is). Of course, the thing that really drew my attention to this restaurant in the first place was the presence of ""Tacos de Chapulines"" (grasshopper tacos) on the menu. What started as a dish that merely piqued my curiosity has turned into my favorite item on the menu. I've ordered them all three times I've been there (though I've been lucky -- the only downside with the chapulines is that they're seasonal). For those who are curious about the taste, they're kind of smoky, nutty, and tangy, though to be honest, their flavor is really unique and not comparable to any other food I've tried. They taste excellent -- try 'em! For those worried about cleanliness, the diet of grasshoppers is a lot more nutritious than that of, say, lobsters, and they're low in fat and high in protein. This is the only restaurant in NYC that has an insect dish on the menu (to my knowledge), and I hope more follow suit! After all, the 80% of the world that eats them can't be wrong, right?Highly recommend, especially if you're in the Theatre District to see a show!",3,0,0,Jason T.,"Chappaqua, NY",0,2,0

In any event he brought the free chips with the guacamole, which we were under the impression that it was maybe complementary.  However, after 1:30 minutes of poor service during lunch, the bill comes and there is a charge of $13 for guacamole.  It was just dissapointing to be hustled like that and it left a sour taste from going back there again.",0,0,0,Renato Z.,"New York, NY",0,6,0

Located near the super touristy times square area, Tolache is far enough away to be a place I would recommend you try if you're around the area, especially considering your other options are chains and pizza joints. The tacos were fine - they don't rank at the top of my all time favorite tacos list, but they sufficed. I tried the Hongos y Nopales tacos. They serve two tacos per order and each one is freshly prepared. I also tried to guac which was salt-less (i had to ask for  the salt shaker and i rarely salt up my food) The cocktails were good; as many other reviews claim, they are indeed strong and tasty.Service was fine - we came, we ordered, we waited, we ate, we left.

Our meals were served. My friend had a quesadilla (which was basically something I could have made in my microwave at my hotel for less than the $13 she paid for it, horrible entree) and I had the fish tacos (which, tasted like Chinese food...and I am almost 100% sure it was NOT the fish stated in the menu, I almost gagged thinking about what I could be eating). I did not finish my fish tacos because I lost my appetite. Service was not good, and many of the waiters awkwardly stood around tables watching you eat. We got our bill, it was over $50.

The crowd was a mix of tourists, theater go-ers and some who just got off work in the area like us. We waited about 20 minutes at 7pm. The restaurant has 2 floors and we were seated upstairs, the space is tight but we managed to squeeze through. Service was ok, a bit slow - though that didn't bother us since we had more time to catch up.As for the food - we ordered Guacamole to start and shared as appetizers. I ordered skirt steak and my friend ordered short ribs. Mine was alright, it was slightly overcooked and cold/dry; my friend enjoyed her dish which I had a taste of, it wasn't bad. We skipped dessert since nothing caught our eyes. By the time we finished, the restaurant was less packed, likely because half the people left for their shows.

It is true Mexican gourmet cuisine and so most of the menu is not typical Mexican food but incredible all the same. They used to have foie gras tacos that blew my mind. My favorite thing to do is get a drink, different sides and tacos and dessert. The restaurant is it's busiest for pre-theater dinner. The other night I went for late night tacos and dessert and it did not disappoint. My boyfriend and I got the spicy guac, lobster tacos, pork & pineapple tacos, plantains, crab tacos, flan and churros.

Clearly everyone in the restaurant was only having drinks (no one even had ordered food) but our waiter kept pestering us about what else we were going to order and if we ""were okay."" (Seriously, ""are you okay?"" is such a weird way to check up on a customer.) Another waiter took the napkin that my dad had placed next to his plate on the table, while he was still seated there, and started folding it up. Don't they normally do that when diners have left their seats to go to the bathroom or something? The food itself is overpriced. The guacamole tasting with all three types of guac was yummy but not worth $27. I thought the fruit guac was the best and maaaaaybe would consider getting it again, but the other two were clearly not worth $13 for a tiny bowl.

4.0,6/10/2012,"Fine upscale Mexican dining.  Based on the single meal I enjoyed solo at Toloache, I daresay they've succeeded in giving even plebeian staples a touch of unexpected refinement.In a touristy area filled with mediocre food chains and big box restaurants, Toloache is a surprise both in food and decor.  Warmly colored in golds and browns with bright tiles set throughout, casual with a touch of elegance.  Its entire first floor dining space is visible at a glance, with a stair leading up to a small upper level.  There is a full-service bar with television tuned to sports news.It was at the bar where I settled in, selecting from their list of mezcal-based cocktails, the attentive bartender serving as my host. Tequila and mezcal anchor the beverage menu, served straight or in cocktails.  Decent cocktail although not top-shelf by any count.  Recommend straight tastings of their tequila and Mezcal over cocktails, if your standards are high.Their menu is cheerful and appealing, food offerings span guacamole, ceviches, quesidillas, tacos, burritos, tortas, and platters.  Some are marked as specialties of the chef.One taco specialty, the langosta, is cleanly arranged on a slim, rectangular plate, two tacos beside a neat mound of rice and pool of beans.  The immediate visual impression is petite, each single tortilla topped by a bit of cubed lobster, sliced avocado, and salsa. It's an elegant taco, each component high quality, well-made.  The first bite confirmed it as excellent, the whole did not last more than 3 bites.  One of the best lobster tacos I've had, each mouthful tasting of sweet fresh lobster and creamy avocado, slightly spiced and well-seasoned.  The accompanying rice and beans were also delicious, not simply an afterthought.The recommended hamachi ceviche was non-traditionally arranged in a circle, each slice topped with salsa and a sliver of cucumber, eaten as one refreshing bite.Their rendition of churros came finger-lengthed and neatly cross-stacked, flanked on one side by Mexican caramel and on the other by chocolate sauce.  Deliciously and satisfyingly crisp and light, a great fried dough dessert perfectly accented by the smooth, earthy sauces.My personal inclination for Mexican aside, Toloache is a terrific dining option in the theater district, Mexican classics wonderfully interpreted and excellently prepared.

I was very hesitant to stay in the area as, well, it's Times Sq. touristville & we were all hungry and needed a decent meal. Someone in the group just ducked into Toloache and that was that. I understand that restaurants have a lot of bases to cover - environment, service, keeping ahead of area competition and on and on but at the very core a restaurant should deliver a good meal. That means, fresh food, good flavor and enough food to ensure your patrons leave satiated (ie full). Toloache, hit the mark on two out of the three - the flavors are there but the portion sizes are RIDICULOUS. When the plates were put down, the happy chatter at the table came to a slow halt as each person stared down at what were, at most, lunch appetizer sized potions. One of my table mates had the shrimp taco - It was two TINY soft tortillas, that were two bites each - four bites of food. I had a shrimp ""quesadilla"" which was a flat flour tortilla, 3 inches in diameter, with cheese, onions and maaaaybe two minced rock shrimp on top - grand total = four bites of food. You simply cannot serve portions of this size & not leave your patrons feeling taken advantage of. It's a clear formula - lure in patrons with the promise of significantly lower prices than nearby restaurants, then pass off two bites of food as a main course. It has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with a ""style"" of food (haute Mexican) it has to do with food cost ratio and what they can get away with in a tourist area. With drinks we ended up paying about $80 bucks each and we were all going home to rummage through the fridge for dinner.

If you're alone expect to be seated at the tables by front window.  Still no one rushed me to hurry up.There is a brunch on Sat & Sun-- lots of dishes with eggs etc and several types of guacamole and ceviche (you can taste all 3 types for $27.  I ordered chips and salsa and looked over the kazillion types of tequila available but didn't want to end up crawling to the theater so I chose the Campechanos (veal head/chorizo/chicharron stew) Remembering that this is a chef driven bistro--the long wait for the fabulous food was okay--but the black beans and rice were  splckt!

3.0,3/7/2012,"I went here to celebrate a birthday and it was a good thing we had reservations because the place was packed. From walking in the decor was festive, but to be honest it was pretty cramped in there. Especially the second floor which squeezed in more tables to fit the tourist throngs of Times Square.Either way the food was pretty good, albeit pricey (but expected with a place in the Theatre District). We ordered a red wine sangria which was a little on the weaker side, and a mojito. Also, ordered two shots of tequila and the waiter was attentive and helpful in helping us navigate through the extensive tequila list. we asked for something out of the ordinary and he catered to our request. He recommended a fiery tequila, smooth going in and spicy/fiery going down! If you're there to have fun with friend definitely try out their drink/tequila menus.Dinner was lobster tacos/pork tacos/chicken enchiladas. The lobster tacos were exceptionally delicious and so were the enchiladas. Just be aware that this isn't a mexican restaurant where your getting the ""bang for your buck."" The tacos were the size of my palm, and the enchiladas were about half the size you normally see in typical Mexican joints. The guacamole was hearty and delicious filled with different flavors and vegetables, really had that homemade touch to it. Guacamole and chips alone, dangerous combo, so don't fill up on it before the rest of your meal!  All in all a filling meal.Last two notes, the place was so loud I could barely hear my partner, and second the place is very family friendly. The entire second floor consisted of families and kids.

We finally arrived at 10 PM, and there were still a lot of people dining. The service was good until the end when we had to flag down our server for our check. The red sangria was very sweet - I recommend skipping it.

From the way the fish was cooked, to the sauce that it came withDessert:1) Flan de Naranja  (Orange custard, roasted pineapple, chile ancho sauce 2) Pastelito de Manzanna  (Mexican cinnamon-nutmeg glaze, vanilla ice cream)- Even though I was stuffed, I couldn't stop eating the flan.

We did not order any tacos, but based on the quality of the tortillas and the appealing look of the tacos that flew by to other tables, I'm definitely going back to try a whole array of them. The staff is friendly and professional. They serve you everything with a smile and with elegance. You do not have to pester your waiter or the bus boy, as they have already taken care of your every need (and caprice) before you start asking for more of this or more of that.

Toloache has been on my radar for quite a while, but I never managed to make it in for dinner. Thanks to my recent Mexican kick, I decided to finally visit the restaurant's 50th Street location.All of the drinks on the margarita list looked absolutely scrumptious, but the Toloache--one of the eatery's signatures--was a no-brainer. Made with blanco tequila, hibiscus and blueberries it had just the right amount of tart to sweet ratio.I'm a super nerd who always checks in on Foursquare. If you aren't a user, I suggest you download the app immediately. Two margaritas for the price of one is a pretty awesome deal. Just sayin'.The Avocado Fries certainly didn't disappoint. I wish there were more of them! Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, the coating was light enough the fries weren't too greasy. I'm honestly not sure what was in the dipping sauce, but I could eat it with any kind of fry and be satisfied.Alright, here's where things get weird. I ordered the Grasshopper Tacos. They really are little grasshoppers--legs, heads and all. Surprisingly, the tacos were quite delicious as long as I didn't look at what I was eating. You could definitely tell there were insects inside the taco (it was super crunchy), but the overall flavor was great.I probably won't order them again (I'm not that crazy), but I'll definitely be going back to Toloache.",0,0,0,Victoria P.,"Astoria, NY",25,57,0
5.0,1/6/2012,"Being a gringa, a long-time lover of Mexican food, and also an avid cook of Mexican cuisine I am oft disappointed in what passes for Mexican cuisine.  I was not expecting anything out of a Times squarecentric Mexican Restaurant.  But, Yelp has not steered me wrong on too many of occasions so, when my boyfriend insisted we see the tree before it got taken down I agreed in lieu of some overpriced Mexican whilst there.  We started with a guacamole, it was fashioned by a pantry chef, a woman, out in the open in the back of the restaurant.  She churned away appetizers with such passion and verosity throughout the night.  We chose the medium Guac, it contained apples, mangoes, etc. and was sprinkled with pomegranate seeds.  It was very nice though, apparently there is a foursquare tip that you should ask for cilantro in the guac because, I do not believe it comes with any(only thai basil) but, I am not a foursquarer, my bf is (which led us to a buy one get one Margarita Sweet!). For apps we also had the yellowtail ceviche.  Besides being excellent, it alos came with a fried avocado strip which I have never seen before and although it was only a garnishment, really appreciated.For entree I sampled tres tacos($10-$13 for two small of each) Mushroom, Shrimp, & Brisket.  I really enjoyed all of them, very interesting accompaniments for each and impressive that the thin corn tortilla under each stayed in tact without having to double it up.  My bf had the short rib entree, which was perfectly cooked and quite flavorful.  Sooo, all in all I was very happy with our experience.  Our waitress, I believe her name was Lady, was quite excellent, great timing (we never waited too long or felt rushed), gave her suggestions from the get go,which I personally appreciate, and was very cordial.  The staff was on top, clearing plates quickly, refilling water, etc. I was very impressed.  The manager came over to the two gringas next to us and started chatting them up, creepily offering them free drinks (which they declined) and then later on sat with some other Latin American diners, chatting them up, as well as other patrons, all while completely ignoring us, perhaps he may have not known I speak Spanish quite well and may even be willing to give the restaurant 5 stars in this sweet ass yelp review??  None the less, I was very happy with this Restaurant, and will go back next time I am forced to be in the area.",0,0,0,Mary K.

3.0,11/30/2011,"We visited Toloache for lunch during NYC's Restaurant Week.  Upon arriving, however, we were informed that they had made a mistake by including lunch on their Restaurant Week menu - we would have to order from the brunch menu.  Both the hostess and waiter were a bit rude and impatient while refusing to discuss the issue with me.  We decided to accept it and ordered our brunches.  A few minutes later, though, we noticed the couple next to us ordering from the Restaurant Week menu!  I approached the hostess, who explained that she'd been told since they made the mistake, they needed to offer the lunch specials (which was my argument from the get-go).  Again, she was a bit rude and offered no suggestions as to our predicament, since we had already ordered our brunch items.  Finally, and uncharacteristically, I asked to speak to the manager.  At last we found someone who was friendly and helpful, and he offered us drinks to make ammends.Now, onto the actual food/drinks.  I ordered a brunch huarache which was very good - tender meat, good flavors.  My wife had a huevos dish which didn't quite measure up, especially in regards to the prices of the entrees.  Our complimentary sangria (usually $10 for a small glass!) was admittedly delicious, but the price tag stopped us from ordering seconds.  Overall everything seemed a bit overpriced, even for New York.  And we were very soured by the rude staff and initial incident.  Food and drinks, in my opinion, were well done if you're willing to spend a pretty penny for modest portions.",1,0,0,Bill L.,"North Brunswick Township, NJ",216,33,1

My girlfriend and I live on Staten Island and go here as much as possible. We receive such a warm welcome and it is very refreshing. Victor (the manager) is the nicest man and will go out of his way to introduce himself and make sure your dinner was exceptional. The food was delicious as usual. Drinks are perfect! Absolutely no complaints. If you complain about this place than you cant be pleased. Even if the food wasn't delicious and fresh id still come here for the service- that of course is not the case. Try for yourself though. It's in a convenient location and if your visiting from out of state I would highly recommend going here and then seeing a broadway play. PS Neil Patrick Harris was here when i was just a few hours ago and he thinks the staff is great that's why he frequently stops by. I must write a better review but as for now - I just want to thank the amazing staff as I know they read this and a special thank you to Victor.

1.0,11/19/2011,"This is a mediocre way over priced restaurant. Every time I have been forced to eat in this place I felt rushed.  The food is too too expensive for what it is. The place feels cramped and you will feel as if you are being processed in some forced feeding factory; but amazingly enough  the decor is somewhat pleasant as judged by someone who saw to the reconstruction of a 400+ years old  colonial home in the Central Mexican Highlands. If you can,  avoid this place and save your money. If you must eat here due to friends wanting to eat Mexican,  stick to the most basic  dishes, but expect to pay a lot for just very ordinary food served in a rushed fashion; sadly, you might have a better meal if you went to a Chipotle  just down the street on 8th ave. This restaurant is attempting to market itself as serving  haute Mexican Cuisine; the problem is that high Mexican cuisine is way too complex as it incorporates Mesoamerican, Arabic, and Spanish traditions and it takes time  and subtlety to prepare. Toloache fails too terribly in all but the most mundane of dishes.  Oh yes, I forgot to mention that Toloache feels entitled to  serve minuscule portions, probably because they want to make believe their food is very exquisite; If they served larger portions they probably would deserve around 2.7 stars rating.Toloache  Margaritas' are not terribly horrible, but way too overpriced. I have been to this restaurant maybe 3 times, the last two times forced by Anglo Saxon friends, and every time I left with the same feeling of having been ripped off.  In reality this restaurant deserves a rating of 2 out of five stars, but I gave it a one star as punishment for their misguided and ill conceived pretensions.   If I can, I will never return to this restaurant until I hear that they have abandoned their airs of  make-believe upscale Mexican food.",0,2,0,Pritio M.,"Manhattan, NY",1,83,21

The downsides? The drinks, while creative & delicious, are pretty small and disappear quickly while running up the tab. The place was pretty crowded and the host desk doesn't do the greatest job managing things. The tacos are pricey at only 2 per serving, and at least the carne asada tacos were nothing special.

So much flavor; pomegranate, mangos and peaches = awesome!! We then moved on to the tacos, I'm not a fan of yellow corn so that biases me a lil but I did enjoy the fish tacos, the shrimp and beef. As much as I love lobsters, their lobster taco was too spicy for me. Entrees: I had the short ribs and they were absolutely the best thing I've ever had, super super tender, amazing flavors of chipolte and mole, whatever came with it was ok but I was more than satisfied w. the short ribs. Both my hubby and our friend has the rib-eye and after a taste, I wasn't really crazy about it. Ended the night with dessert consisting of churros which were outstanding, crispy and sugary, and a whole assortment of other goodies. the only other thing I remembered that I enjoyed was a lemon tres leches cake but it was so tiny bc it was part of a samlper, but it was very good!

The service was also exceptional. At one point the waitress told us her ""recommendations"" which turned out to be almost the entire menu! It was well appreciated though. I will say it is on the expensive side. But I was full from my caesar salad a la Toloache and my truffle and manchango cheese quesadilla. Be warned that their quesadillas are not like the ones you get at other Mexican style restaurants. This is most definitely an appetizer, but it packs quite a punch of flavor and is just super, super cheesy. I did manage to have a few bits of my friend's steak dinner and it was delicious as well. And I highly recommend starting with guacamole. We had the spicy and the plain and both were very well seasoned and presented. The mango mojito that I drank was also perfect for the meal! The atmosphere is on the upscale side and when we walked in at 8 the music was Latin and soft, however around 9, it turned into club music which was a bit odd.

The hostess was so overwhelmed by what looked like a gaggle of Girl Scouts or ""Book"" Club goers (maybe the girls were in their early 20s), but she seated us as soon as she could once I told her we had a plane to catch an hour and half later. It was nice she actually cared and accommodated. I get the sense most hostessi in NYC seem enamored with their power and that our schedule wouldn't have made a difference. The waitress was the same way - very prompt and responsive. *the guacamole and salsa appetizers. We had some guac sprinkled with pomegranates - it was pom-wonderful! The salsa was thin, not like the salsa fresco (totally making up my Spanish here) with chunks of fresh tomatoes you typically get. The mediocre: * Our entrees. The bf got tacos and I got a Queso Fundido all to myself (Note: sure, a bowl of cheese for dinner seems unhealthy, but I rationalized it - and you can too! - by reasoning that really it is just a make-your-own Quesadilla! Or a cheese-only fajita). I was actually incredulous that the 4 tiny tacos were enough to satisfy my boyfriend's appetite, as he usually can eat twice that much, but he seemed happy with them. Me, not so much - both of the fillings (pork and pescado) were much too moist to be on a taco and made them soggy. I thought there were grills in Mexico? My Queso Fundido was delicious, but also sort of runny which made it sloppy to eat. * The drinks. I had the Toloache. It was small and very magenta. * The tres leches. Not terrible, but it had frosting on it that was kinda grocery-store-bakery-case-cake-ish. The inside of the tres leches was mouthwatering and moist (and here the moist was good, unlike the Fundido and the tacos) Overall: meh, probably not coming back.

1.0,6/26/2011,"Yes, I'm a tourist here in NYC, but even folks from Indiana know when we've been snookered. I ignored some of the negative yelp reviews for Toloache that mentioned small portion size. I thought the menu looked creative and decided to take a chance anyway. The variety of tacos looked good and I can deal with smaller plates (hey, it is times square). What really honked me off was the rude waiter who was obviously trying to up-sell us all night. Even though the menu makes no mention of it, the tacos are considered appetizers (expensive apps they are @ $12-14 per). The waiter pushed the gaujillo-rubbed steak (which my wife ended up getting out of frustration), I got the chicken enchilada entree and I asked for a simple cheese enchilada for my 10 year old son. We did get the guacamole frutas, which was good, but nothing special. Food arrives and deep disappointment sets in. Despite the contemporary presentation, the enchiladas were absurdly plain...seriously, no better than strip mall Mexican food found anywhere in suburbia. My wife's steak was cooked properly and was tender, but again nothing special and certainly could not taste any of the spices (I guess the contempo-Mex interpretation went over my head;) ) My son's enchiladas were simply two corn tortillas with cheese oozing out each end, but throw some watercress on top and...TOLOACHE STYLE! They had the nerve to charge $17 for this, $20 for mine and $30 for the steak. The wait staff clears the plates and does the waiter ask if we would like to see the dessert menus? No, he throws them on the table before I told him we were not interested. $97 bucks + (small) tip later, I'm a little lighter in the wallet but hopefully you'll be a bit wiser than me.",0,0,0,Tim L.,"Brownsburg, IN",0,1,0

I was craving Mexican & I've been to Every Rosa Mexicano multiple times, so I decided to broaden my horizons & try someplace new. I ""yelped"" Mexican food & was led to Toloache.I grabbed a seat at the bar. The restaurant is very noisy. Good thing I wasn't trying to carry on a conversation.I started off with a classic margarita which was good but really sugary. (more than usual)I asked the bartender about the Tortilla Soup & he recommended it. It was amazing! Although the portion was small, I was tempted to order another bowl.I decided on the Pollo Tacos & while waiting for the entrees. I asked for chips & salsa which I had to pay for. That is one pet peeve of mine, when I'm at a Mexican place, I expect free chips/salsa. Not so much here. The chips were ok, served warm & they were thicker than normal. The chipotle salsa was just OK. I left almost all the chips/salsa untouched. The chicken tacos were very tasty - simply served with chicken, pico, manchengo cheese with a wedge of lime on the side. You know, I live limes. I can add lime to just about anything. I would marry a lime if I could, but I digress. It was a good dish BUT the serving was SMALL. Only 2 small tacos, it looked more like an appetizer than an entree.Now, being that I have to fit into a wedding dress (no, I'm not really marrying a lime) in just a few months & i wasn't incredibly hungry to begin with, I am perfectly ok with the amount of food served. However, i have a feeling most folks would not be.The total bill for 1 drink, soup, chips/salsa, and 2 tacos came to $ 36 before tip.

Their was quite a crowd, but the waiters were certainly keeping up.  I love a place that is quick with the recommendations and they seemed very knowledgable.I started with a frozed margarita - which certainly doesn't fall into the extensive bad margarita in new york group - but it wasn't great either.  It did however do it's job and got me drunk.The quacamole is good, BUT I think the additional crunchy fruit actually brings it down.  I don't want a giant quac covered piece of apple, mango or peach sitting on my chip.  The salsa was unique from other restaurants. I believe it's chipotle flavoring. If you are up for a nontraditional salsa, it's great.The ceviches were dynamite. The shrimp had a wonderful sweetness with a citrus kick.  The hamachi was less flavored letting more of the yellowtail flavor come through with a bit of heat.The shrimp tacos were small - but just enough.  Every flavor came out - garlic, chipotle, a wonderful tamarind salas.  The hearts of palm slaw provided just enough crunch.  The rice and beans were boring and unflavorfull.I felt like Toloache focuses on it's stars and let's everything else slide by.  As someone who loves rice and beans, it was a bit of a letdown.  However I would 100% go back for the ceviche and maybe ask for a salad on the side of my tacos.",0,0,0,Sarah S.,"Hoboken, NJ",124,17,0

I felt like shrimp and love having sides of rice and beans. The black beans were tender with a flavorful sauce. The rice, seasoned lightly and garnished was flaky goodness. The quesadilla was well balanced with shrimp and cheese. Not thick globs of cheese but evenly spread out chihuahua cheese. The quesadilla was topped with a fruit salad which actually worked out with the seafood. Literally cleaned my plate up.

Don't get me wrong- I love tex mex food as much as the next guy, but this is AUTHENTIC Mexican food, so I just don't want anyone to be disapointed. The real highlights at Toloache are the guacamole, the tacos and the quesadillas. Their main dishes are very good, but in my opinion they pale in comparison to the rest of the menu. The ideal meal here is a guacamole trio (the fruit guacamole may sound strange to some, but is honestly the most delicious thing I have ever tasted.. I have brought MANY people here and everyone, even the most skeptical has almost ended up licking the bowl.. its that good), an order of the fish tacos, the lobster tacos, the shrimp tacos and the brisket tacos, the huitlacoche and truffle quesadilla (which is really just a thin open faced tortilla covered in a light coat of cheese, truffle oil, corn and huitlachoche and then put in a brick oven to crisp) and the short rib quesadilla, followed by the churros and the flan.

I'd heard great things about them, but the mojito was just fine mojito. The regular margarita was not particulary special. The worst part of the night was the overbearing service. I don't like being hassled or pushed to order something, so when our server said that there was only one more sea bass left, and then used the SAME LINE for the dessert  (one left!) by accident.Also, having to wait 10 minutes when you've made a reservation frustrates me, but even more so when you're left to stand in the middle of the room holding your jackets.

One way and one way only.... I was unwilling to budge. But In my infinite intelligence and vast wisdom I was wrong.Toloache has the elements of a traditional Mexican restaurant. The margaritas are there, OK good cause I could not live without that, and most of the traditional ingredients are there, AS THEY SHOULD BE, but this is where it gets odd. Tilapia and lobster Tacos? Braised Short Rib quesadillas? Brick oven suckling pig? This ain't your regular Mexican. I tried all the Guacamoles, giving the most props to the spicy rojo. And honorable mention to the standard.  For the main I got the pollo toloache. I was disappointed in the lack of sides and the no free chip policy but I can deal with that as the main was good and delicious. Not to spicy a good mix between spicy and smooth. I would eat this in a taco if they  had it....  For a side an individual of Spanish decent there was only one choice which I need not explain...

This place would have gotten 5 Stars, but I was misinformed by our waitress that they do have grasshopper tacos available, but in fact they were all out...To make up for it. I had a couple of the Scorpion Mezcal Margaritas which were AWESOME! I love the salt and chili flakes that rimmed the glass. It added saltiness and heat to each sip. We started off  by getting a few appetizers. First we got the Traditional Guacamole that consisted of  avocado, tomato, onion, cilantro and serrano pepper. Really simple and tasty. We then ordered the Spicy Yellowfin Tuna Ceviche , key lime, vidalia onions, radishes and watermelon. Really fresh and refreshing. The lime and watermelon go well together. It adds a touch of sour and sweetness to the tuna. this made it very good.To finish the round of appetizers we decided to get the Quesadilla de Huitlacoche y Trufas. The name maybe long, but it was well worth the pronunciation. The quesadilla was made with Manchego Cheese, corn, Huitlacoche salsa and BLACK TRUFFLES.... Yes I said Black Truffles. The mixture of everything blends well and just melts in your mouth. Since the Grasshoppers weren't available we got the De Cabeza Tacos which have braised veal cheeks, onion, cilantro and chile de arbol salsa. The meat was really tender and flavorful, but I still had Grasshoppers on my mind.Enough about the tacos and on to the main course. When I saw tuna on the menu. I immediately thought of sushi. I know I wasn't at a sushi place, but I wanted some raw tuna. The Atuna al Pastor was just the thing. It's  Adobo rubbed tuna with rajas con crema rice, grilled pineapple and chipotle salsa. When asked how I wanted it cooked, I said ""Rare"". Tuna is much better raw than cooked in my opinion.The dish did not disappoint at all. The tuna was seared to perfection. The grilled pineapple bits added sweetness to the spicy sauce. It was my perfect pick me up dish to get my mind off of the grasshoppers.All in all it was a perfect dinner. The wait staff is excellent and on their ""A Game"". I will definitely be back and hopefully get to try the Grasshopper Tacos!",6,2,5,Ron C.,"Brooklyn, NY",1379,1157,1998

3.0,2/20/2011,"Flavorful, but small portions.I went to Toloache for a late lunch on a Friday afternoon.  There was a sizable crowd.  There was nothing remarkable about the decor, nor the service.  My only frustration with the service was that the waiter was hesitant about stating a preference when I asked him about two dishes.  But that's just a pet peeve of mine, so again, no major complaints.I started with the Carne Asada Tacos.  The beef was cubed and coated in a flavorful [and greasy] gravy and garnished sparingly with cilantro.  This is served on the thinnest, tiniest little corn tortilla. It felt like a relatively light meal -- if you overlook the fact that the oil dripping from the meat basically soaked through the tortilla leaving a greasy mess all over my fingers.  Now, don't get me wrong... I don't mind a little grease and it was certainly delicious.  If they could work on minimizing the grease a little bit, it would be a very nice entree.  My boyfriend had the Braised Short Rib Quesadilla.  This was actually more like a mini pizza -- yes, everything there was actually quite miniature.  I would have preferred a bit more meat, but the dish was a great balance of textures and flavors.  Both of the aboveforementioned entrees were served with rice and beans.  The beans were average, good, but no superb.  The rice was sadly white rice, with corn in it... I thought it was a bit odd and expected yellow rice.  After eating our tiny entrees, my boyfriend and I were still hungry, so we ordered the Lobster Tacos.  Now these were a SHOWSTOPPER. Yum yum yum yummmmmy.  Succulent bits of lobster meat was served with cilantro and a moderately spicy sauce on a[nother] tiny corn tortilla.  I thoroughly enjoyed it. For dessert we had the Lemon Tres Leches Cake.  I love tres leches cake and order it every time it's on a menu  This one was just okay.  The lemon flavor was out of the norm and a nice touch, but it wasn't anything spectacular.The Red Sangria was quite good.

2.0,2/11/2011,"I came to Toloache with a reservation on a Friday night with 2 of my friends. All of our food was actually very very good i was pleased. The serving size of each meal was very small for the money, but me and my friends split everything. Our server was pretty quiet and i could barley hear him. I was a bit confused with who was our actual server since we had many different people bringing out out food, taking things away and asking for our order. After we finished eating they took away our plates very quickly and passed out dessert menus. The one waiter seemed to be very impatient and it really seemed like his goal was to get us out of the restaurant and out of the table asap. He gave us our dessert menus, and came over twice to ask us what we wanted before we had a chance to look it over. Once we ordered our dessert, right as we were done he took our plates away and brought the check to us quickly after. Me and my friends were catching up and hoping to sit around and talk for a while but that particular server seemed to want us out and was rushing us. It wasn't even busy for a friday night as their were lots of other tables open and available for customers. He came over and took our bill from us before we even put our cards in. And once we did put our cards in we asked for 40 on each card and he turned around and came back and was very rude to us because he didn't understand how much we were giving for the bill. He wasn't friendly at all and very rude!All in all, the food was good, maybe could have been cheaper, the drinks were okay, and the service was CRAP. some of the worst service i've had in the city for an expensive bill.

3.0,1/3/2011,"I thought Mexican was dead; Mexican was dead as long as New York was concerned. I have long stopped trying to find a reasonable answer as to the dearth of authentic restaurants of certain cuisines - be it Italian, Peruvian or Mexican - despite the prominent immigrant population. Generally, there exists a correlation between influx of immigrants and the development of that particular type of cuisine in the receiving nation: For example, there was a flood of Italian immigrants to Argentina around the turn of the twentieth century; therefore, there are many good Italian restaurants in Argentina. However, this rule of thumb seems to have failed in New York. Where do Mexican people in New York eat? Admittedly, there are only less than a quarter million Mexican immigrants in the New York area, but they still have to eat, do they not? Finally finding a new Mexican restaurant worth trying, of all the 365 days in a year, I had to venture out on the day when New York stood still in the blizzard. My stomach really rules. Sopa de Tortilla I was less than excited by the generic tomato soup. Even the spiciness and the fried sticks of tortilla failed to make the soup more interesting on the palate. For tortilla soup, I prefer the simple chicken soup variety, especially the Yucatan chicken soup. Quesadilla de Huitlacoche y Trufas Described as Mexican ""pizza,"" the corn tortilla version of quesadilla was baked until crispy, topped with melted cheese and paper-thin slices of, presumably, the black truffle. The manchego cheese dominated the tiny quesadilla; the black truffle and huitlacoche, if they were present, were there only in spirit, and they provided only a visual contrast against the creamy yellow of the cheese and tortilla but nothing against the taste. Tacos de Hongos y Nopales My blizzard night started to look better with the first selection of taco. The corn tortilla was light and flavorful, which contained chunks of crunchy cactus and aromatic maitake (one of my favorite mushrooms). The queso fresco was salty and creamy, which harmonized the mushrooms, cactus, tomato and the tortilla. Tacos de Camaron However, the second round of tacos was the deciding factor: These incredible shrimp tacos made me a believer in their tacos. The shrimps were cut into large chunks and grilled to perfect succulence. The hearts of palm slaw not only enlivened the tacos with its dainty sourness in conjunction with the faintly sweet tamarind salsa, but it also gave the tacos a twist in texture - a gentle bite to the chunky shrimps. It was prodigious to trap such multitude of flavors and textures in such a small circle of corn tortilla. Avocado Fries Toloache did a noble job: The avocados were thickly cut and evenly dusted with very fine bread crumbs and evenly crispy from one tip to the other. The sweet dipping sauce, a complete mismatch, was suspiciously similar to the Worcestershire sauce, although I would have placed my bet on tamarind since it was a Mexican restaurant. This dish failed to persuade my firm conviction that avocados are invariably better off raw than cooked: The heat destroys the green herbal flavor of the avocado and it also turns the creaminess of the luscious flesh into a starchy mash. Berenjena Adobada A bold study of the sweet and spicy: The tender eggplants were simultaneously sour from the adobo marinade and the salsa and sweet from the plantains, while the gradually intensifying heat from the habenero promoted the diner to desire another serving of the sweet and sour to quench the heat - however, only to be entrapped in the sweet-sour-spicy spiral until all traces of the dish were eliminated. The lentils, although only playing a side role, were also expertly cooked to retain its nutty texture.ChurrosThe weak paleness of the churros was unconvincing; my skepticism was soon confirmed by my first bit into the mushy dough saturated with frying oil, which, if it were a steak, I would have called ""rare."" The temperature in frying these Mexican doughnuts must have been too low; thus the dough had soaked up the oil without gaining any flavor. Despite the word, ""cinnamon"" on the description, the churros were blanco in color and taste. The accompanying lukewarm pot of runny dark brown liquid could have been anything but chocolate, while the serviceable cajeta (caramel) was thoroughly wasted on this plate of misery. Pastel de Chocolate Quetzalcoatl might have blessed the Mayans with a gift of chocolate, but he certainly must have walked past Toloache. The chocolate cake was barely warm and barely chocolate despite its deep color bordering on black. The color of the dulce de leche ice cream was as light as a poorly made tea with milk and just about as exciting. This sorry rendition of dulce de leche ice cream would not be allowed to pass the custom into the land of dulce de leche - a.k.a. Argentina.",3,0,2,The World Digested A.,"Tokyo, Japan",8,119,85

On numerous occasions I've ordered their veal cheek, mushroom and pork tacos, and have been left glancing around to see if anyone will see me sneak a lick off the delivery container to mop up any remaining flavor. During restaurant week and on their 3-year anniversary, I decided to pop in with a large group to enjoy their specially priced margaritas and even grab a table for a site down meal. Although the place was packed, we were seated promptly (table for 7!), and able to enjoy too many margaritas - their blueberry is a must try!  While I'd be apprehensive to order some of their fried items for delivery for fear of it arriving soggy - the cactus fries and homemade guac are a must try.  Needless to say I'll be back, maybe lunch tomorrow?",1,0,1,Lindsey T.,"Portland, OR",33,170,34

I was slightly disappointed with the lobster tacos with morita salsa and avocado.  There was a good amount of lobster, but I found the tacos difficult to eat because I was choking on the spices and the inexplicably excessive amount of grease disintegrated the tortillas (I can understand grease coming from marinated pork but less so with lobster).  For $17, if they aren't going to provide rice and beans, the least they could do is splurge on the corn and provide a second layer of tortilla.  Other taco toppings, such as maitake and huitlacoche mushrooms, cactus, queso fresco, did not taste like they belonged on a taco.  Service was acceptable.",5,2,4,Lisa D.,"Brooklyn, NY",772,625,1139

2.0,8/30/2010,"There's a general lack of fine dining Mexican restaurants in New York; granted, Aaron Sanchez does an admirable job w/Centrico in Tribeca.  Barrio Chinno serves up more of a scene than good food, and the same can be said for La Esquina.  Mercadito is largely unimpressive, and Rosa Mexicano is a commercialized, dumbed down interpretation of Mexican.  (Rick Bayless, please save us!)Enter Toloache, which recently received a gilded single star from Sam Sifton of the New York Times.  My dining companions and I visited on the eve of their 3rd anniversary, lured by the prospect of the $3 margarita special.  Though thoroughly weeded by the onslaught of fellow deal seekers, the management did an great job of dealing with the rush of diners and tending to issues.  Unfortunately, the service was easily the most commendable and memorable aspect of the dining experience.The food was borderline pedestrian.  A trio of guacamole ($21) was thoroughly insipid, requiring a dribble of nuclear hot habanero sauce (available upon request), to provide necessary intrigue.  A  jicama salad ($10), was painfully ordinary - Chevy's or Chili's could provide an equally bland offering.  Brisket tacos ($12) were meaty, satisfying, and easily the best thing I tasted that evening -  though I did miss the bold flavors that could be had for a fraction of the cost at Tehuitzingo, just a few blocks over.I do appreciate what Toloache represents.  It's laudably authentic at times - grasshopper tacos and huitlacoche (corn fungus) are available for the adventurous.  And i'll recapitulate that the service was truly top notch.  However, the food, congruent with the Theater District, accedes to the uninspired, vanilla flavors that are inline with the culinary tolerance of a Midwestern tourist.  Thus, this is the gamble of opening a restaurant in the Theater district - guaranteed customers from the Broadway/tourist crowd, but at the same time, guaranteed mediocrity.More Toloache coverage:midtownlunch.com/categor…",10,3,3,Chris H.,Hong Kong,170,603,2140

Margaritas are tasty and the fresh guacamole made this avocado hating guy enjoy more than a few chips covered in the green, mushy stuff. Only issue I had was that I felt a little rushed.. ordered the guac and entrees at the same time expecting the guac to come out first.. not the case (well to be fair, it did hit the table first, the entrees landed about 30 seconds after). I would have preferred some time to enjoy the chips and guac, then onto entree.. but whatever, maybe I should have been clear when I ordered. The food was pretty good, not great. I had some pork dish with some sauce and stuff - I guess it wasn't that memorable.. but still tasty. 2 of the moderately priced entrees, spicy guac (which wasn't really spicy, but still good), 4 margaritas and the bill was in the $150 range with tip.. how did that happen? Oh, I think my margarita was around $13 (and one of the lower priced ones at that). That being said, I'm glad they rushed me out the door so I could continue my drinking elsewhere. On a side note, they did give us 2 free shots when the bill came.. so that was cool.

They make the kind without clamato juice, which is my favorite. I'd say this beer-lime juice-salsa-and-salt concoction is one of the city's best. For dinner we both had some tacos. I had the carne asada, which was tasty and the Date had the brisket tacos, which were marinated in Negro Modelo (brilliant!) and muy bueno. My only complaint is the tacos fell apart after one bite. It may help to add a second tortilla, which is how tacos are normally served in Mexico anyways.

My group also shared lots of different kinds of tacos, with the carne asada and tilapia being the best of the bunch. The traditional guac was very good, but I thought the red (spicy) wasn't great. The spice didn't enhance the avacado flavor; it simply overtook it.Our server was friendly and accomodating, and it wasn't too loud for my group of six to all hear each other at our round table upstairs.

Awesome).The entrees, on the other hand, were mediocre.  I had the Veracruz paella which is not at all like ""regular"" paella - more like a few pieces of seafood with a little rice in between. My fiancee had the chicken enchiladas and she was not that impressed either.Best part of the meal is the chips and guacamole. You can order ""regular"", ""spicy"", or ""fruity"" guac...and the fruity version is awesome.  It has mango, apple, and avocado and tastes delicious.Service was schizophrenic; one of our waitresses was excellent and the other was terrible.

Toloache is a typical midtown tourist trap, that uses the worst, least authentic ingredients and charges exorbitant prices for small portions.The guacamole was passable, so if you get stuck here, go with that and a margarita, though if you're really after some generous and delicious foods and good tequila drinks, don't even hesitate, pay for a cab and go straight to Mayahuel in East Village instead. The cab fare will seem minimal compared to what you'll spend at Toloache, and still leave hungry.The waiters kept grabbing things off the table before everyone was finished, and we felt rushed the entire time - this was odd, since our entire dinner, with drinks, appetizers, and mains took under one hour.  The quesadillas were very small and consisted of a toasted flour tortilla with some low-grade cheese melted on top.

We ended up starting with both the guacamole and ceviche tasting platters.  Although both were pretty tasty, they were no where near enough food or high enough quality to justify their steep prices.For the main dishes we were all completely underwhelmed.

The margaritas were ok - nothing special - and the guacamole wasn't memorable (the spicey wasn't spicey, the fruity was just guacamole with apples and some pom seeds, and the regular was pretty standard).We decided that the entrees didn't look very exciting so we would try a number of the bites like the avacado fries, tacos, quesadillas, tamales and empanadas. The best part of the whole meal was the quesadilla de costillo and  the apple salsa under the empanadas.  Otherwise, the veal cheek taco wasn't good... the avacado fries were interesting, the tamale wasn't great, and empanadas themselves weren't inspiring. I'm usually not very picky about Mexican food - but i was disappointed with this restaurant.  It was over priced for very standard food.   I would give it a one star but we didn't try an entree so maybe there was something interesting in that list.

When we arrived we were told the menu was not available *sigh.*The owner came to talk to us. He was very friendly and helpful. He said the chef was willing to go out of his way and make items on the menu if we liked. Not wanting to be annoying we declined and ordered from the regular menu.The service was great throughout the evening. The drinks were AMAZING. I had two muddled blueberry margaritas that were to-die-for. I'm allergic to avacado but my friends tell me the guac trio was great as well. I stuck to the spicy bean dip which is very addictive.The entrees were a little disappointing in my opinion. Portions are small and my $20 enchiladas were good but not great. I expect great from $20 dollar enchiladas!!! The flavor combo was interesting (it included apples) but nothing I'd go back for. I prefer Baby Bos enchiladas by far.Dessert was good, mini churros in chocolate and caramel dipping sauces. Nothing too phenomenal but tasted good.

The quesadillas were also a big hit with the group. We had the spicy shrimp, short rib and truffle ones. Short rib was the best of the three, hands down. I ordered the grilled tilapia with apple and cactus salad atop potato gratin. I literally cleaned my plate. The texture of the fish was crispy on the outside, just the way I like it. I also ordered a side of sweet plantains that came with spicy ketchup. Interesting combo, but I don't think interesting in a good way. They don't need sauce. They were sweet and greasy and perfect. I also sampled the avocado fries. As if avocado couldn't get any better, they breaded and deep fried them. Genius. For dessert, we got two samplers and two orders of churros with dulce de leche and chocolate dipping sauces for the table. The sampler included miniature molten chocolate cake, tres leches cake, flan, sweet and spicy corn cake and sorbet . Being the champion eater that i am, I obviously helped polish it all off. Save the leftover churro dipping sauce for the chocolate cake.",0,0,0,Taryn M.,"New York, NY",10,33,0
4.0,6/29/2009,Came here for a work lunch last Friday. We started with guacamole - my favorite was a spicy one with strawberries. I want to try to copy that one for my apartment.We had the prix fixed menu and I started with the Tamal De Puerco which was really yummy. Not too much cheese or sauce and it was cooked perfectly. For an entree I had a Chicken Enchilada which was delicious- the chicken was incredibly tender and the amount of cheese and sauce was perfect. Not a complete overload. The portions were a good size that didn't crazy fill me up.Their drinks were great too- I had a prickly pear frozen margarita then followed it with a watermelon margarita with chili hot sauce on the rim.,0,0,0,Lauren G.,"Park Slope, Brooklyn, NY",166,461,75
2.0,6/27/2009,"I am a big fan of Mexican food (as it is presented here in the US...I have never been to Mexico so I am sure the real Mexico food would be slightly different). Yummy!!! In some countries that I lived in, Mexican restaurant is not that common so I still feel like Mexican food is a rare treat...;) And those frozen margaritas....dang, I already salivating. Unfortunately, this place is a total disappointment, especially in considering the bill. Portions were small, skirt steak was dry, shrimp dish didn't have that much shrimp...which was the theme of the dinner. There was always something slightly off about the dishes. The frozen margaritas was just right and tasty (although size was a bit small... I am a big fan of frozen margaritas at Cancun).Maybe it was because we were a huge group (about twenty people or so) and the kitchen couldn't catch up. But considering the size of our group, the wait staff was pretty attentive (maybe a tad aggressive in suggesting drinks).I would go maybe for a quick drink and some tacos before venturing out for the night.

3.0,6/25/2009,"So I dined here last week with some colleagues on a prix fixe menu. Considering the tourist trap nature of the neighborhood, I was pleasantly pleased. Mind you, I am not from NY, so you can take this review for what it's worth. What does one expect in the theatre districts? Olive Garden? The salad bar at Food Emporium? The later is a step up from the former. Alas we are talking about Toloache. We had freely flowing drinks- sangria for me which admittedly was a tad too sweat. That did not stop me from consuming two of them though. The starters were unremarkable, such that I cannot recall what they were. I believe shrimp something, and a green salad of some stripe. The main course was talapia, tasty without being overdone. Although a colleague whose reviews I trust did not like his talapia. So here is what I can say, of all the many, many cheesy Italian places in  the theatre district Toloache is more pronounced as it is one of the few Mexican restaurants. Which, let's be honest are somewhat scarce in NYC in the first place. If I was dining in the 'hood, I might return.",0,0,0,Daniel S.,"Chicago, IL",10,71,7

She told us to just wait at the bar.  After waiting for half an hour, we wound up leaving without an apology or a dinner.  For a neighborhood full of decent restaurants, this place could stand to drop the pretentiousness and leave their customers with a better impression.  Oh, and the prices are absolutely ridiculous.  Overrated and Overpriced...  What a shame.",0,0,0,Jack L.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,0
4.0,6/15/2009,"I was crossed between giving this place 3 or 4 stars but I gave it 4 for the fact that the decor was kinda cute and the bathroom was clean enough that I would walk inside. This place has changed my mind about guacamole. I don't hate guacamole. I just don't like avocado. I usually pick out large chunks of avocado out of everything. It's that buttery creamy weird taste. Ok I'm losing focus...back to the food. We got the guacamole with frutas and I think the avocado kinda enhanced the flavor. Although there were no large chunks of avocado in my bites. I picked through the guac and only took hold of pieces of fruit covered in creamy green stuff. Yummy! So I ordered the short ribs quesadilla and the los tacos camaron (shrimp). BF ordered the los tacos pescado (baja style tilapia) and the corn on the cob. My tacos came first tasted it and it was good. Dont judge me but the only other mexican restaurants i like are those dingy tex mex places and Chipotle. I've had Dos Caminos and Rosa Mexicana. They just don't satisfy what I search for in mexican food (SOUR CREAM!). But note I have never been to Mexico so I don't really know what ""real"" Mexican food tastes like. But when my BF's tacos arrived his overpowered mine. His was much tastier. Next up for tackle was the quesadilla. It looked delicious and I loved the fact that it was cooked in a brick oven so it had a nice crunchy edge. My BF also got the corn which he said was ok. I didn't try any so I can't make any judgment. I was too full to have dessert, maybe next time. Overall I think the restaurant was pretty good. I would come back to try a few other dishes but the grasshoppers won't be one of them.",2,2,1,Bonnie W.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,25,0
5.0,6/12/2009,"""My client wants me to find a lunch spot that will satisfy her ceviche craving, preferably in Midtown.  Any idea?"" asked one of my colleagues. Of course, I loved this inquiry and the prospect of a culinary research project. The geography preference and limiting menu would be a challenge, for sure, but if I could not come through, who could?   I began to check menus for Mexican restaurants in the epicenter of Manhattan and slowly worked my way out. After a few failed suggestions (closed for lunch, etc.), a light bulb went off - Toloache, the classy Mexican restaurant that hides just east of Times Square. I had passed the spot many times and had added it to my restaurant dream list. When I confirmed that the raw fish appetizer was available here in three varieties, all of the pieces fell into place.  The lunch wound up being so delicious that my colleague opted to return the following week for a different corporate excursion. I was able to join on this occasion and could not have wished for a better meal. The beautiful dining area was built with Mexican tiles that encased from under foot and on the surrounding walls. A balcony level provided a quieter alternative and view of the unique ceviche and guacamole bar below.  We started off with salty tortilla chips and a warm roasted tomato and chipotle salsa. The creamy tomato broth was thick with spice and flavor. We added a tasting of Guacamole into the mix, sampling three different blends. The traditional version was enhanced with peppery Serrano ham shavings.  The fruity variety was packed with pomegranate, sweet Vidalia onion, mango, apple, peach, and a spicy mix of basil and habanero peppers. The final and most intense version contained a smoky chipotle flavor, similar to that in barbecue sauce.  Then, I had to try this intoxicating ceviche that tempted us back to this lunch destination. Again, we settled on the trio sampling.  One small plate balanced a shot glass of full shrimp hiding amidst a custard of tomato salsa, onions, and lime. Each bite characterized a Spanish sofrito and the shellfish of the Mediterranean. Another ceviche consisted of thinly sliced Yellowtail topped with cucumber, salsa, and avocado. The hamachi was delicate and almost breakable.  Its flavor was enhanced by the juice of a Meyer lemon. Lastly, a bowl of spicy Yellowfin Tuna cubes were tossed with radishes and fresh watermelon. Key lime and Vidalia onion balanced the acidity. The ripe watermelon surprised my tongue with a tingly crisp that led me to vote for this as my favorite of the three.The massive meal continued with a Mixed Greens Salad topped with radish slices, crisp almonds, and unique mini jicama sandwiches stuffed with avocado puree. Orange slices garnished and added color to the dish. A tamarind vinaigrette provided the spice necessary for true Mexican cooking.   Now it was time to move on to entrees and sides. My Pescado tacos contained moist, yet not greasy, tilapia fish sticks lying between a spicy jicama slaw and a creamy guacamole spread. The texture and flavor components were all present and well-blended. I was disappointed that ""baja-style tilapia"" apparently meant deep-fried, but the dish was fantastic regardless. My tacos were served with hearty black beans and fresh yellow rice. I sampled my colleague's Tumbada, a paella of shrimp, chorizo, chicken, clams, and octopus. Each substantial piece of meat and fish provided a satisfying crunch when poached with my fork. The delicate rice had a seasoned essence that infused each bit of protein with a savory flavor. Our sides included the crunchy Avocado Fries with spicy ketchup dipping sauce, the savory Huitlacoche Mushrooms, and the creamy Sunchoke Poblano Gratin. Is your mouth watering yet? We proceeded onto our dessert course, where we tasted several treats and sipped some of the richest, most chocolaty coffee I have ever had the pleasure of rousing to. Though I normally find the texture of Flan to be rather off-putting, the Toloache version was topped with a rich coffee and caramel glaze, as well as tart fresh berries. The sweet components enhanced what I normally find a bland way to end a meal. Another interesting dessert was the plate of crepes that were stuffed with caramelized goat's milk, almonds, and banana ice cream. The flavors might not sound appealing, but they blended nicely. The crepes acted less like the traditional cylinder casings and better resembled the layers of a succulent lasagna. Last, but certainly not least, came the cinnamon-dusted Churros, which were plated between sweet caramel and rich chocolate dipping sauces, so equally tantalizing that you were forced to make a tough decision.  ...Ah, I can breathe a sigh of relief as the tale of my lengthy meal comes to close. My only advice is to run to Toloache so that you can soon partake of their Mexican goodness and so that you work up the appetite to enjoy an experience as substantial as my own.",2,1,0,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640

Yes, ladies and gents, I swore that my quesadilla had ketchup on it and wouldn't be surprised if it was in fact our beloved tomato paste sauce since Toloache's thin, fragile so-called-home-made tortillas also deceive: they tasted store bought to me. I saw a woman putting something in the oven, but don't play me: you can't pass Associated Market tortillas for fresh ones! The carne asada in the tacos was overspiced to the point I didn't know what flavor I was tasting and at for $7.50 a piece (since the plate is $15 and you get two measly tacos), I could have gone to Chipotle and been much happier. The hamachi ceviche plate was tiny; my boyfriend almost ate it in one spoonful. Toloache's decor is beautiful and it's obvious they have a grand selection of tequila, but the food is far from authentic and highly overpriced for the quality and quantity of food you are served.

I didn't pick up on the spice in the guac, but it was delicious still.Looking back on it, I'm glad she had been here before because she explained that while the food is delicious, the portions are not very big. For example, you are afforded only two tacos with an order ($11-14). Keeping that in mind I ordered Carne Asada tacos and we split a Quesadilla con pollo. The quesadilla wasn't very good. The tortilla was left on the grill too long and it was too crispy for my liking. The chicken was also sub-par. The tacos however, were amazing.

There is just no reason that it has to be this big (has she ever said that?), and there are times that I just can't eat the whole thing.Sometimes I cut it open and just eat the rest of the amazing shortribs, eschewing the beans and rice. Sometimes I save some of it, even though I'll never eat it.  Sometimes I force myself to eat it all, and then I feel ill for the rest of the evening.The sweet plantains, if they are not soggy, are the best things in the entire world.

I'm paying for these things. Give me my damn sour cream.They also have GRASSHOPPER tacos. And they were pretty good. Question: Is grasshopper permitted if you're a vegetarian?

4.0,11/5/2008,"From Toloache's signage outside, you'd think that the restaurant was a strip club, which is unfortunate because for those simply passing by, it would be easy to assume this observation and never look twice (but it could also work in their favor...depends on you!). However, for those of us in the know, Toloache is like a rare gem that seems somewhat undiscovered. Housed in a two story space, Toloache is bright, open and airy. From the warm terracotta flooring to the beautiful Mexican tiling on the walls, the restaurant definitely has an authentic feel. Taking front stage, just to the right of the bar, is a small square shaped open kitchen, complete with a wood-burning brick oven, where culinary magic takes place in the preparation of homemade guacamole and an array of fresh ceviches. Overhead, charming dark wood beams house track lighting, adding Southwestern aura and illumination to the entire restaurant. Adding a touch of elegance to the casual space are crisp white table cloths and swanky mustard-yellow leather chairs and banquettes.After grabbing a seat at the bar, I ordered a prickly-pear margarita on-the-rocks and nearly 5 delicious sips later, Teddi arrived. We were seated immediately, just as the restaurant slowly started to fill up. Michael, our adorable waiter, took our order consisting of: communal chips, salsa and guacamole, cheese enchiladas with green sauce for me, and cheese quesadillas with huaticochle for Teddi. Three minutes later, a basket of tortilla chips, a bowl of guacamole and another of salsa arrived. The chips were golden, crunchy, salty and warm which was a pleasant contrast to the cool guacamole. Smashed buttery avocado meat was mixed with chopped tomatoes, a pinch of sweet white onion and cilantro, and a passive dash of jalapenos that gave the dip a nice spicy kick. Though the guac was incredible, I think I actually liked the smoky salsa better! The perfectly pureed potion's flavors of tomato, chipotle, salt, spice and garlic blended precisely together to the point that, had you given me a straw, I would have drank the stuff! Shortly thereafter, our entrees arrived. My plate of cheese enchiladas was almost too sexy to eat. I snapped about three photos before I couldn't take the suspense any longer...And dug in! I'm convinced that the corn tortillas enveloping the white cheese were homemade. The green chile sauce served as a moat to the two enchiladas, which were topped with more white cheese, crema, cotija cheese and some sort of chopped, pickled fruit. This may sound like a strange mix of ingredients, but I will never forget how unique and brilliant the flavor of the sweet and crunchy fruit mixed with the predominantly savory ingredients. Truly phenomenal. By first glance of the Spanish rice that accompanied our meal, I could tell that it was pre-packaged instant rice...And my first bite proved it.

4.0,9/26/2008,"I was in NYC with my friends and spur of the moment we decided to head out and see if we could score some tickets to see Lion King, we got there late, missed the cheap tickets and were THIS close to purchasing full price and we bailed out at the last minute, we weren't in the mood to spend $180 a pop.  So we were walking around just talking and taking in the sights when we stumbled upon Toloache.  We just wanted margaritas.  Their bar is stocked with all sorts of tequilas, I'm not a connoisseur, but I was impressed by the sheer volume, there was a Frida Kahlo tequila! I wanted one just for the bottle.  We ordered a Toloache Margarita, which consists of Frida Kahlo Blanco,  muddled blueberries, lime and hibiscus, it definitely had a kick, however we found it a bit too sour, we asked for a bit of sugar and it was perfect! We had 2-3, at which point we started getting hungry.  So we ordered their classic guacamole (tradicional).  You could see the guacamole station at the back, the big black stone mortar, I was getting so excited.  But when it came it was in a standard small bowl..boo!  I was expecting alot more, but it turned out to be a good portion and it tasted great, slightly chunky, a nice subtle kick that increased the more you ate, so it was redeemed. The chips were excellent as well.  Then we ordered chicken and carne asada tacos, both were delicious as well, it was comparable to taco's I've had on the west coast.  But the biggest difference is the price, these were some pricey tacos!  Hence I removed a star.  The service was excellent, they were friendly and helpful.  The restaurant is very nice, it has traditional, colorful, tiling done  in a tasteful way, it's two levels and the light fixtures are wrought iron. I loved the atmosphere and the music, not the usual cliche mariachi stuff, they played cool mexican spanish rock.  I'll definitely go back when I'm in the city.  oh! they also have grasshopper tacos! called chapulines.  I'll try to muster some bravery and try them next time.",2,2,2,Jimena M.,"Sterling, VA",118,185,11
4.0,8/27/2008,"Proof that promotions work.I'd never even heard of Toloache, before reading on Midtown Lunch that they were doing $1 tacos.  At many places this would only be a slight benefit to your wallet, but Toloache is a pretty high scale Mexican joint.  And they were doing it for dinner, yay.So I went and the tacos were pretty good.  I was most interested about the mushroom and cactus ones, and they were fairly tasty, if a little on the bland side.  Same with the chicken.  The pork, however, was awesome.  Just a little bit of spicy and a little bit pineapple-ey.  Yum!They, like many upscale Mexican joints, have an extensive tequila list, which is always appreciated.  I wasn't terribly fond of the guacamole sampler they served.  The food was fresh, but the guac itself was a bit bland.I'm not sure how often I'd go back if they weren't doing $1 tacos, but at least it's on my radar.  And if you're a restaurant on my taco radar, it's probably a good thing for you.",1,1,1,Adam R.,"Brooklyn, NY",424,744,153

Naturally, I max out at 7, since they are 2 bites per taco. They offer the pork, chicken, or mushroom tacos for $1. It takes roughly 15min for my food to arrive. I ask for hot sauce. I get a tasty Habanero sauce in a little ramekin. I would have to say that I probably like Pampano Taqueria better. Funny that I met the midtownlunch and seriouseats guys.

Be warned, the small plates and los tacos on the menu are very small. You would have to order more than one plate to have a full meal. Order an entree if you want a regular meal.

5.0,5/29/2008,"Yes, expensive, the plates are very small, but very rich and filling. I'm always looking to try great new restaurants, partly because I love em, but also for the expressed purpose of Yelping about them, and how great they were. Lately though, even at some of the new happening joints, I'm just not blow away. Nothing I would say was a 5 star meal. This was.We started with fresh Watermelon margaritas which were cooling, not very sweet and perfect (except the pulp from the watermelon kept clogging my straw). Soon came some freshly made corn chips, and we ordered the trio of guacamole (comes with a sweet one, a regular one and a spicy one), all of which were enhanced by also dipping in the regular salsa that came with the chips, a slightly smoky and mildly spicy brown dipping sauce that was terrific.I had to try their version of mexican corn, which I wouldn't say was close to as good as Havana or the Red Hook Ball Fields, but definitely held its own, they use a chipotle mayo instead of cayenne pepper. Rather tasty.Next we all got a taco, I went with the Carne Asade, which was amazing, came with two little ones and the meat was succulent and well accompanied by the pickled red onions. Also with this course we decided to get the Corn cakes with Fried Quail eggs, which was good but tiny (4 to a plate, its a biteful).I tried both the chicken and short rib quesadilla, both of which were total winners as far as I was concerned, the short rib with more like a pizzette, as there was no top tortilla, and the chicken quesadilla was a very thin version of the classic that had some nice queso fresco on top. All in all, finally a restaurant I can get excited about, and in the heart of the culinary wasteland of and around Times Square. Delightful!",0,0,0,Dave P.,"New York, NY",172,411,321
4.0,4/19/2008,"The food gets a solid four stars. The drinks get 5 - they're to die for. My one complaint is that it seems overpriced considering other options for 4-star Mexican food in the area; for example Zona Rosa on 56th and 5th. Also, the portions are small - don't even think of just getting an entree if what you want is a meal. However, it's beautiful and romantic, so if you're trying to impress that special someone, book a table at Toloache. I would suggest booking early.",0,0,0,Jenny B.,"San Francisco, CA",19,87,0

It was a very satisfying meal, the sangria came with plentiful chopped up pieces of fresh fruit, and the service was great.

They turned away several couples while we were enjoying our dinner. We started with the traditional guac which was delicious! We also had the roasted tomato salsa which was, in my opinion, better than the guac! I got a prickly pear frozen margarita while I waited for my dinner, and it was good. For dinner I had the Carne Asada... It was cooked perfectly! It was fabulous!! the seasoning on it really brought out the flavors of the meat which was very tender and juicy! It came with a side of guac, a potato gratin which was delicious and had a great cheesy, buttery flavor without being overly greasy. It also came with a small cheese mole enchilada which was very good despite the fact I'm not a huge fan of mole sauce. For dessert we shared the days special,  fondue for two... it had all the fixings: churros, fruit, brownies, and was delicious as well!I loved this place it was so cute, had great atmosphere, and the wait staff was friendly and helpful.

4.0,1/27/2008,"Julian Medina is a crafty chef, having landed two stars as chef de cuisine at Maya and later helping pen the original menu at SushiSamba (it takes guts to stand behind a yellowtail roll that combines such disparate ingredients as jalapeo and lemongrass). But it's the lack of one particular ingredient at Toloache, his ambitious Mexican restaurant in the Theater District, that makes his cooking stand out.In the over 15 dishes sampled, not one featured the wet blanket condiment of choice at thousands of Mexican joints and Taco Hells: lettuce. Cool on a sandwich, essential in a salad, this shredded buzz kill has no place near a tortilla--and thankfully Medina has banished the produce from his Oaxacan-inspired kitchen.  And unlike splashier cantinas in the city, where $17 margarita-fueled cackles and the Gypsy Kings fill the air, the cavernous location is cozy, with mosaic tiles and colorful pastorals lining the walls (but still sophisticated enough to sell their own $17 reposados). This tidy compromise between upscale and traditional also translates to Medina's cooking.Fresh truffles, Manchego cheese and sweet corn--ingredients that greatly range in price and world origin--make up the rich center of a quesadilla ($13), which is fired within the restaurant's massive hearth, adding a pleasant smokiness and char. Guacamole (arriving without the embarrassing tableside mashing), is available in three varieties ($11) with homemade corn chips stealing some thunder, and causing more, with an addictive crunch that left the basket at our table throughout the meal.It is obvious that Medina knows how to accent a tortilla. Braised veal cheek tacos ($9) are garnished with sweet onion and pack a salty crunch with each bite, while sweet corn tamales ($10) are only tamales in theory--a light mesa cake is served separate from a heaping pile of chicharrones, rich pork fat pan-fried in more mole verde and its own fatty goodness.With pride (and a 10-minute tourism bureau stump speech) the server mentioned that the chicharrones was a traditional Oaxacan dish, along with grasshopper tacos ($9), a dare-worthy dish that tastes worse than is sounds. He even seemed a bit skeptical about the flavor of dried Orthoptera, but was nevertheless clear about its significant place in the southern Mexican kitchen.The foie gras taco ($14), not so much.To think this poor duck, who was force-fed gallons of corn mash, winds up as part of a taco. Julia Child is surely rolling over in her grave. The foie gras was seared properly, but was too big (each hunk was as thick as a plump Ballpark Frank) and bold to accompany a corn tortilla. The veal sweetbread taco ($9) was a much better example of using trendy ingredients in traditional cooking. Small hunks of thymus go naturally with fresh sweet corn and smoky pasilla salsa.The entrees, on the other hand, are outmatched by the small plates. Chicken enchiladas ($20) lean sweet with a fig salsa and quince salad, while a brick-oven suckling pig ($25) tasted mysteriously like the chicharrones--it was basically the same crunchy preparation with smoky pork piled high atop a tortilla, making the age of this swine a non-factor. This is heavy, organy fare, but pastry chef Roberto Villamil makes dessert worth holding out for. An inventive Meyer lemon tres leches contrasts the simple, cinnamon-dusted churros. And who would have thought Patron XO worked with caf con leche? It may just be common in the cantinas and coffeehouses of Huatulco. But we were left to wonder as our waiter had punched out for the evening.",2,2,2,emcee b.,"Brooklyn, NY",10,39,0
