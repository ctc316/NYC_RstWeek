1.0,4/29/2019,Decided to try this restaurant again even though I've had a few bad experiences. The appetizer was extremely rich even though the pasta had a creamy sauce....like a frozen dinner.  The steak was tough and fatty which was not great.  My friend didn't eat her chicken which she said was tasteless.  Not one decent dish but the breads are great.  I've had too many bad meals here and it was too pricey.  So disappointed since it is a very pretty restaurant.,0,0,0,J.

1.0,4/24/2019,"HORRIBLE! I was really looking forward to my meal at Vancluse but I was extremely disappointed. I ordered my steak medium rare and it came out well done. When I mentioned it to the waiter, he actually tried to convince me that it was medium rare when there was no pink whatsoever. He begrudgingly got me another steak but was very rude for the rest of the service. As I live in the neighborhood, I was looking forward to dining here but after my horrible experience, I will never return. Also the little drop of foie gras they give in their pate is definitely interesting looking but not worth it in terms of taste. Try JoJo's instead.",0,0,0,Ramona T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,0

5.0,4/15/2019,Great service and food at Vaucluse! I hosted a very small bridal shower brunch for my sister and the restaurant was so friendly about the requests I made and very attentive. Our server was very sweet too; he took pictures for us and offered complimentary beverages for the occasion. The ambiance and food was exactly what I was looking for; modern/chic decor with white table cloths. If you go for brunch do try the French toast!

I had the steak with frites with the delicious poivre sauce. Oh my, it was so good. My hubby loved the duck. We ended with the delicious and surprising L' orange creme brûlée with rhubarb ice cream.

5.0,4/2/2019,Went there last night for my brothers birthday. Big group it was about 11 people my first time was just 2 of us...and all I can say is WOW. The new Omar's section to the left side is epic. The food is on point decor modern and hip. To start the service was extra attentive to every single need. Even for a Monday it was a little busy but not once did that stop them from focusing on our group. We tried pretty much everything on the menu. Of course the pasta is always one of the best dishes. The Caviar oysters unbelievable honestly my only complaint would be they only have 1 wild caught fish option and the rest is farmed. Well to be clear the rest of the fist they could not get a very clear answer from the back so they recommended only 1 they they knew was. Very happy they even went the extra mile to ask for me when of course they could have just said yes. Highly recommend large or small groups.,0,0,0,Tim S.,"Weehawken, NJ",0,4,4

3.0,3/1/2019,"Vaucluse is another restaurant (newish I believe?) from chef Michael White of Marea. I'd been to Marea before and wanted to try this place for awhile, especially because of its chic dining room. So my friends and I picked this place for a girls' Christmas lunch on a Sunday. We came in at around 1pm, with a party of four. We were seated immediately, and brought copies of the menu and waters. I noted that the dining room was certainly every bit as impressive as it looked in pictures, with an all-white, carpeted interior, large windows that let the natural light in, and white cushioned booths. Within a few moments, we ordered, with just one thing to share as an appetizer, and separate main dishes for each of us. The wait time for our appetizer (leeks) was average for a New York restaurant. We had been brought slices of complimentary bread and butter while waiting also. The leeks were garnished with crushed nuts, and contained the flavor of a strong olive oil. It was not terrible, but not remarkable either. Our main dishes were presented shortly. Myself and a friend both had the Niçoise salad- for a salad, this was quite good, with generous pieces of lightly seared, fresh tuna, amidst hard boiled egg slices and greens. Our two other friends had the epaulettes and chicken paillard - both remarked that their dishes were delicious. Vaucluse has a classically French dessert menu, and some of the girls opted to share an eclair, which they were both pleased with. Service was impeccable and prices were standard with New York restaurants. I suspect their dinner menu might contain more elaborate dishes than the brunch menu, and would come back to try a meal at a different time. Would recommend for a long lunch/dinner.",0,0,0,Su L.,"Manhattan, NY",122,268,1107
4.0,2/21/2019,Generous well prepared portions for a great price point at this level of service and elegant ambiance . Almost too much food for a multi course dinner - when does anyone say that ?Decor classic modern muted neutral tones - chic simplicity Came for my mom's birthday on a Sunday night Party of 3- we all did the $95 4 course prix fixe with $60 wine pairing (which was not listed on menu). Sommelier was very attentive and willing to pair according to personal preference which was much appreciated . Wine was all good but nothing amazing. Food was nicely presented and well seasonedStars were truffle risotto and rabbit ravioli (heaven)At end of the meal in addition to a nice happy birthday candle and chocolate message on my mom's dessert they gave her a birthday card signed by staff and more sweet goodies in a bag which was very classy and thoughtful Only negatives -wait staff never explained dishes they were serving and my veal chop ordered medium rare was delivered medium However I think this is one of the best values in the city  for a prix fixe for this pricepoint and level of diningHighly recommend and plan to check out their next door restaurant Omar which is more downtown chic and steak friendly,0,0,0,anabela D.,"Queens, NY",17,194,0

2.0,1/13/2019,"We spent our NYE night there thinking it was going to be amazing to ring in the New Year there considering the price we paid. The food was great thank goodness!!! So that's why I gave some stars...BUT -The staff seemed scattered and unorganized. I asked questions about the menu and wine list and the waitress didn't seem to know much about it. ""I don't know"" seem to be the answer. There was suppose to be live entertainment and music in the main dining room and they were rotating the live band back and forth from the other room the lounge which then there was no music at all. They should not been so cheap and just had two bands one in each room. At one point several minutes before midnight when its suppose to be lively and exciting it became quiet and boring. I asked what happen to the music and nobody new what the problem was but finally someone told me they were having technical difficulties. Also for a French restaurant you would think they would have a French red wine listed in the prix fix list but unfortunately there wasn't. I should of looked at these yelp comments prior these would of been helpful. Think twice before scheduling a special evening there.

1.0,12/25/2018,"My family and I have been to Vaucluse multiple times and it has always been superb - UNTIL TONIGHT. Let me further preface this review by saying we come to NYC from Los Angeles every Christmas season we can, and made our Christmas dinner reservation at Vaucluse because we wanted our meal to be special.This was our first visit since they split their restaurant in two, and the quality has plummeted. To begin, they first attempted to seat us in the ""nightclub"" room which they assured us was the same menu as the main dining room because of it being Christmas, but the room had a completely different vibe than what we were expecting, and we requested to be seated in the main (more sophisticated/elegant) dining room, which they obliged. However, this was just the beginning.My mother ordered a Cosmopolitan with a lime twist, and it came with an orange. No big deal, mistakes happen. When we sent it back, requesting again a lime - it came back with lemon. We thought maybe they were out of lime. They were not. Upon a third request, they offered to bring us lime on the side. Which they did, but it would have been nice for them to either make the drink once again, or credit it for the inconvenience (though I drank the Cosmo anyway, so... whatever.)The service was some of the slowest we've had in New York, even by fine dining standards. At one point, before our pasta dishes, we asked our server where our course was, to which she replied, ""I was wondering the same thing, let me check."" When they came, I asked if there had been an issue and she said, ""no, they were just shaving the truffles (black) over one of the pastas - giving it some extra love."" ""This whole time?"" I asked, ""yes."" she replied. The remainder of our meal was sub-par as well. The food itself was nowhere near worth the price paid. The aforementioned pastas were all gummy (we ordered all three offered on the prix fixe menu), and the entreés were mediocre at best. My dad and I ordered the Tournedos (filet) and my mother ordered the Loup de Mer (Branzino). Both of which were bland and mushy. The fish was almost inedible. The filet was tough by filet standards and lacked.... something. Flavor? I don't know, but at ~$500 for three prix fixe four-course meals, your money would be much better spent at Bouley (At Home/Test Kitchen) or at The Grill NY. Both of those restaurants have comparable bill totals with far superior quality. Bouley (either one) is admittedly more expensive, but the experience is unmatched and honestly, just spend your money there. Chef Bouley truly cares about his food and the REAL love he puts into it. We even had a better meal for lunch at Eataly, in the Oculus mall for less than $200 (and that was ordering two pizzas, two pastas and a salad among the three of us). Obviously this is a far different environment and cuisine region - but my point is that the value to quality ratio at any of these places is far superior to the experience we had tonight at Vaucluse.It's unfortunate, and upsetting - Vaucluse was one of our favourite restaurants but we will not be returning as our time in New York City is too precious to be wasted with giving them another chance, and there are far too many other quality restaurants.",5,0,0,Lauren L.,"Los Angeles, CA",37,8,0

Perfect service from both the hostess ( Ms. Rachel Baique ) and the server ( Mr. Finley McDonald) -very attentive, graceful, and accomodating.2. Excellent choice of Vine ($14 -up) selections, quality and quantity , and manner of serving 3. The appetizers: The Foie Gras (an extra cost of $6), the Pate:(pork terrine, housemade bacon, smoked duck, foie gras, pine nuts), and the smoked salmon selections were excellent. 4. The main dish selection of Trout  with Almond was cooked to perfection -the best; the Cajun crusted Halibut was tasty but slightly over cooked; the Duck Leg  and Lamb Chops were acceptable.1. Desert:  The cheese plate was good; however the various sweet deserts (e.g. Crémeux aux Framboise) we had were below average.Comparisons1. The Foie grass was as good as Tocqueville, better and larger than If one by land, if two by Sea and Chez Napoleon.2. The Halibut  at Al Fiori-chilled with caviar topping was better than others. The cost independent of drinks and tips) of lunch for two is about $100 in Vauclouse , $170.00 at Al Fiori, $140 at Tocqueville,  under $100 (lunch or dinner) at Chez  Napoleon -but $300 (dinner only) at If One by Land, if Two by Sea.

1.0,9/23/2018,"Very disappointed by this restaurant. Don't bring France into your name and cuisine when you don't even master the basics of cooking.We did the 6 course tasting menu. The waiter announced foie gras that changed into octopus after 5 min. The first courses were not bad but very disappointing as the flavors were not really matching but at least it was well cooked. The only good course we had was the black truffle ravioli. A signature dish from the restaurant according to the waiter. Really tasty but extremely small. 5 tiny raviolis and presentation was terrible. Raviolis out quickly on a plate without any organization.Meat course was lamb chops. Those were literally raw. We talked about it before the course arrived, as my wife and I really don't like lamb when it's undercooked and it came out raw... and the funniest moment was the dessert. One of the worst dessert I ever had! A mix of condensed milk with supposedly white chocolate topped with some sour flowery tasting sorbet. Each layer by itself was bad but mixed it was even worse.

Noticeably this elevated dining area has a totally different feel from the front of the restaurant.  An edgier crowd was my first impression and a disco ball that rotates, huh? And then Omar emerges in a black velvet tuxedo making his way to each table. He's quite a character, was not sure how to interpret the whole scene. He seemed very personable but what is his talent? The food and service overall was very good but I really could not enjoy it because it was too loud and too dark. There was a loud drunk group and so much yelling! Perhaps I am getting grumpy and old but I wish we were sitting in the more refined front section of the restaurant.

5.0,2/17/2018,"This is currently my favorite Michael White restaurant. We went for the dinner $89 prix-fixe yesterday, which consisted of an appetizer, pasta, entree and dessert.We started off with a glass of whisky for the H and a non-alcoholic cocktail for me, which were delicious. For appetizers, I chose the special for the night - scallops and the H had lobster soup. I do agree the chef has a salty palate but fortunately so does the H and I . The scallops dish came with bits of rice crackers, on a bed of purée and with mushrooms that were cut to mimic scallops - very playful and creative. I was really obsessed with the dish. Lobster soup was comforting on a cold February night. Next was pasta - tagliatelle with black truffle and the famous epaulettes. Pasta with black truffle and cream - how can it be bad, this is almost cheating at this point. The epaulettes were really unique - you can barely taste the rabbit as the sauce was super tangy. The H and I each preferred our own pasta. For me, the simplicity of well made pasta with truffles is more than enough. Portions are substantial, so at this point, we were already quite full.For our mains, the veal chop and lamb chops. Great temperature on the meats and once again I prefer the veal chop with the lobster on puff pastry. We had to pack half of our meal to save space for dessert. Dessert was chocolate soufflé and bread pudding. This was my only small disappointment for the night. When I think of soufflés, I think of a tall ramekin with a raised top and fluffy consistency. Their version of a soufflé was more like a molten chocolate cake. Still delicious though and I finished every bite. Bread pudding with banana sorbet was pure decadence - just pure banana. Ambiance was the best of all Michael White restaurants I have been to (Marea, Ai Fiori, Osteria Morini). This is a perfect date restaurant - comfortable seating, light live music, quiet enough so that you can have a real conversation. Sometimes the stars align and you end up having a great evening at a restaurant - that's how it was for us. Service was attentive and understated - we were not left wanting but also didn't feel people hovering, which is a great balance. One gripe was we were seated next to an entryway for service personnel and every 2 minutes someone is coming in and out of the door. One time a service personnel forgot to catch the door and it slammed really loudly next to me, stunning me of the peaceful atmosphere. So if anyone tries to seat you next to a service door on the first floor, try to request for another table.",1,0,1,Teresa T.,"Palisades Park, NJ",18,78,92
3.0,2/15/2018,"+ Service+ Interior Design - White Label BurgerVaucluse lived up to the hype of every list lauding its timeless interiors. With two dining rooms and an artful bar in between, a weekday lunch drenched in sunlight felt like something more. I can't count off everything that was brilliant, because a lot was. From the Robin's egg tinted plus seating couches (or maybe they just gave the impression of blue) to thick-weighted menu paper fitting of the Altamarea  restaurant family, almost all felt right in the world. The weekend lunch menu offers up some of the best; escargot nested in bone marrow, a light creme glacee or sorbet to tie up the meal, and rows of entree options will set you back only $39. My one recommendation is if you have an unsophisticated palate like mine, please stray away from the White Label Burger. Though I had endless joy with the fresh fries and brioche bun that came with it, the patty itself, under the guise of being aged meat, couldn't agree with my taste buds.

3.0,2/6/2018,"This review is or 2018 winter Restaurant Week lunch.Service was on point, although we waited for more than 15 mins for our entrees; food was flavorful, although it's on the salty side. Get crowded when close to 1 pm even on a week day (long wait like 10 people in line).I had lobster & crab soup as appetizer, but it was too salty. Still yummy, though, with a rich crab flavor. But as an appetizer, it was too much in my opinion. Then I chose the duck sausage pasta as my entree. Again, the flavor was very strong and it was creamy and a bit oily. As to the duck sausage, I was expecting it to be those in the jambalaya, but I totally forgot that this is an Italian dish and this is a French restaurant. The sausage was actually like those grounded meat in the Italian meat sauce and its portion was tiny. Also, this pasta dish tasted pretty much like the appetizer soup. Guess they used the same base broth? So I suggest that you choose one of the two, not both, unless you really love heavy salty meals.The dessert was the best part. We had both desserts and loved them a lot. I liked the citrus sorbet on my Vanilla Bavarois, pleasantly sour and refreshing, and my friend's Crémeux au Chocolat is the best milk chocolate mousse I've ever had. Rich, creamy, chocolatory, but not overly sweet. I've never had such a flavorful Restaurant Week lunch, because I still could taste the pasta when I burped hours afterwards (sorry I know this sounds gross, but seriously, I was talking about 6 or 7 hours gap).Forgot to mention that they have tasty sourdough bread as complement with light butter.

4.0,2/1/2018,"Restaurant week lunch visit. The styling, ambiance and service are excellent. The luscious beige cushioning of the dining area with low soft lighting and neutral tones throughout (were there fireplaces? It felt warm) mixed with the mirrored paneling and tablecloth service, it may seem stuffy initially but quickly became comfortable. Definitely channels Martha Stewart color palette and etiquette. My favorite actually are the amazing teal submarine bathroom doors and the subtlest signature painting that ran the length of the hallway like a runner facing the lavatories.But you want to hear about the food. I had the pate, duck ragout taglitalle and chocolate cremeaux. And sauvignon blanc And Malbec tasting compliments of my superb server. The pate is a beauty and so lovely. A bit under-seasoned allowing the raisins, pistachios, dried apricots and truffles to shine though the treated meat. Wrapped in what tasted more like a pastrami than bacon the terrine pate needed to be dipped in fantastic droplets of tart fresh stone mustard in the mini side salad. The frisée, cornichon, microgreens and baby watermelon radish were all raw and wonderfully complimenting to the sizable meat patty. Even though I said no wine (twice) my server graciously  brings me a small glass of semillon and sauvignon blanc. Sweet and floral notes paired well with my appetizer. The Taglitalle. Didn't look that good. To be quite frank, it was bland. To a point that I'd even asked for a bit of salt. If you know me, I veer on the side of low sodium as it is. The ground duck was flavorful with the porcini, herbs and carrots in a bath of delicious butter broth but I would've wanted a bit more kick. Perhaps some spiciness or lemony tang. And a bigger, bolder cut of meat. The pasta was fresh, super al dente but completely unseasoned- seemed rather one note and forgettable. I'd eaten all the topping and slurped the sauce and left a handful of pasta. He brought me Malbec, which I could not refuse. It really started and ended my favorite course- dessert:Now, the chocolate. I think I have a new favorite. Barely sweetened but so cold and so thickly creamed it almost tasted like a paste- cremeaux is spectacular. Just think the most luscious stick on your tongue and the roof of your mouth chocolate gelato. The espresso sabayon (weird whipped cream, thicker and bitter) with dollops of dark caramel and cacao nibs topped the wondrous solid emulsion. Halfway through I moved the toppings to the side opting for chocolate alone. Oh wow. It's my jam. Or cremeaux. Just love saying that.I'm an expensive but a good date.

5.0,11/21/2017,"One of my favorite restaurants in Manhattan. I've been twice now and both times memorable. First, a note on the price. This is not more expensive than a lot of other places far less good. As with every restaurant, it depends how you order. Yes, if you get an appetizer and entree and drink expensively, it's going to be a bad tab. But if you split an entree with guest and get an appetizer each (their appetizers are quite large and if you eat small portions as a rule, more than enough for one person as an entree), it's not more than 15% above the average New York restaurant with entrees in the upper 20s and lower 30s and appetizers in the mid-teens. Second, unlike the majority of upscale restaurants in New York, Vaucluse is spacious. Even the littler banquette tables don't feel cramped. They spent an absolute fortune on the decor and everyone is well-dressed. No jeans. Men wear jackets and women are dressed like ladies. It's all very nice in an era of casual Friday where cufflinks are increasingly scarce. The service is extremely professional. I went the second time on a Travelzoo offer. There was some confusion over the deal--not just for us but the table next to us. They handled it well and it was still 75 less than the dinner for two would have been without the offer. Must Have Dishes: 1) Leek appetizer. We ordered this because the entrees were so heavy, we didn't something lighter. I wouldn't exactly describe this as light. It's a very large section of a leek (3 inches diameter) full of butter and I can't really say  much more than that except that it was one of a few culinary orgasms in our meal .2) Escargot: Unbelievable. This is not snails in a silver tray. The escargot are integrated into a rice-y dish. It was a couple months ago so I can't remember more. But at 22, this is more than enough for an entree. I will go back by myself to the gorgeous bar and have a martini and escargot for dinner soon. 3) Duck: Transcendent. Hands down the best of my life. Yes, this is fatty but it's not gamey and I've never had duck so juicy. DO not get the trout. It's horrible. Just a flat piece of fish drowning in butter, though the baby asparagus are excellent and plentiful. We were too full for a major dessert but the lavender gelato was tremendous. All of them were and you can mix and match. A nice thing to have after dinner somewhere else with coffee or a glass of wine. I am in love with this restaurant.

5.0,11/14/2017,"5 stars for the food, 4 for the service. We used a travelzoo deal to book this restaurant, paid about $120 for a $186 value. For us, definitely worth it. There were some itemized limitations (for example, we were allowed 2 glasses of wine at $15 each, 1 appetizer worth $19, etc.), but the way they applied the voucher, was not as granular. So no matter what we ordered, the voucher would basically cover up to $186, and we had to pay any amount that exceeded that. I loved everything that we ordered: Crabe et avocats - was like a play on a crab louie salad, steak frites - the steak was amazing and perfectly cooked, didn't even need the accompanying red wine sauce, millefeuille aux fraises - again, amazing; the crunch of the puff pastry, the cream, the accompanying ice cream, that didn't seem to melt no matter how long I left it, and all washed down with a light Château Maupague rose. Service was slightly hit or miss for us. The water and bread was refreshed regularly. Because we don't go to fancy restaurants often, we did tend to ask a lot of questions, and in turn, felt talked down to at certain times. Also, not the restaurant's fault, but the one train that does run near the restaurant broke down, so we were rather late to our reservation and ended up taking a taxi instead.

We called the waitress over and asked her how much that would be and she very smugly said an additional $32.  I said forget it, the regular Patron is fine.  We then asked for bread, to which she responded, ""we don't bring bread until your menus are closed and down on the table and you are ready to order!  There were 4 of us and we all ordered the price fixed meal.  I ordered the steak medium rare; it came out well done.  When I showed her that it was well done, she started to argue with me and told me that I was wrong.  It was extremely well done, no question about it.  She finally took it back.  My 3 friends were done eating and my replacement meal still hadn't come out so I told her to forget it because I didn't want to eat my dinner when my friends had all just finished theirs.  Her response was a cold, OK!  We then ordered dessert.  My friend is gluten free.  She kept telling her wrong info on gluten free desserts.  My friend settled for sorbet which was brought out with an elephant ear cookie on top of it (clearly not gluten free).  By this time we were so tired of complaining that my friend just took it off and put it to the side and asked the waitress if she could have a macaroon instead (which was gluten free)  She brought out 2 macaroons for her which were the size of a nickel and told her it would be an up charge of $12!  It was a ridiculous experience~we all felt like we were in a Seinfeld episode!  When we left we complained to the manager who just kept saying ad nauseum, ""I apologize, I apologize!""  Well after a $600 meal, ""I apologize"" is not sufficient!!",3,0,0,Elyse K.,"Mantoloking, Monmouth Beach, NJ",0,2,0
5.0,10/23/2017,"This review is long overdue. Had a lovely experience here. This place is elegant, spacious and clean. The whole place seems to work like a well-oiled machine which was impressive. Definitely recommend making a reservation for this place. Hosts were welcoming and polite. Water is refilled constantly. Bread is presented to you in a giant basket for your selection. Your glass is always half full. Service is attentive but not in your face. Our waiter was sassy and fun! He even walked me to the restroom. The staff really goes above and beyond. We ordered from the Restaurant Week menu. The food was great! There's a lot of attention to details here. They even added 3 options of wine ($9/generous glass red, rose and white) to the menu. I had the rose and it was a great choice.We started with the grilled leeks and salmon rilletes. My friend loved the toasted almonds on the leeks. The whipped salmon to baguette ratio was perfect. The Veal entree is very rich. The polenta was delicious and buttery! The portion was large and satisfying. Had their duck ravioli and it was an interesting dish. The sauce very good, earthy and had some mushrooms in it.Dessert was delicious and just what we needed. Chocolate mousse was paired with a light and lovely lavender ice cream.

1.0,10/21/2017,What a disappointment. This was our second time wasting at vaucluse. The first time was in June 2017 and was amazing. Everything incredible. This time we came back for my wife's birthdays so excited and we were disappointed at every turn. The service was still very good but that was about it. The food was not good at all. We started with the leeks which were fine. Then we shared 2 pastas one with truffles and a special short rib agnolotti. But were not good but the special was terrible. I've had better pasta on an airplane. The burger which was amazing last time was just ok and we had a lobster salad which was mediocre at best. The table next to us sent their food back 3 times. All in all we were so disappointed. We said something to the waiter nicely and he said Raj we have a new chef in the last 4 weeks. Well sorry but something is wrong. All in all. Very disappointed. They were not on their game last night.,0,0,0,David E.,"New York, NY",0,9,2
4.0,10/15/2017,"Vaucluse is representative of today's evolving Upper East Side, classic French preparations atop white tablecloths, but in a refreshed and modern approach. Very much enjoyed the space and its design elements. It really fits with the location. Overall, the pastas were a clear highlight - made in house with delicious fillings. Protein mains were good in concept, but executed a tad unevenly in cook and seasoning. Returning, I think the Vaucluse bar is a perfect stopover to enjoy the pastas and/or burger with some of their excellent wines and cocktails when in the neighborhood.Atmosphere:- Modern luxe, an understated and sophisticated elegance - great design work.- White table cloths, but not stuffy or outdated.- Very UES clientele, though includes a nice mix as the evening progresses and in the bar area.Food:We elected to go with the Prix Fixe ($89) which includes an hors d'oeuvre, pasta, entree and dessert. It is quite a bit of food, and you are probably better off with a scaled down version just sharing some of the items. We sampled:- Scallops Special (Sunchoke Puree/Chips, Orange): Great combination of flavors and perfect cook on the scallops. Nice dish.- Pate en Croute (Duck, Chicken, Foie Gras, Mushroom Duxelles): Quite substantial portion for one person. Nicely done, but a bit too heavy for a prix fixe given all the other courses.- Casoncelli (Butternut Squash, Sage-Brown Butter, Amaretti): Excellent pasta, highly recommend.- Epaulettes (Rabbit and Reblochon Cheese, Black Truffle Jus): Excellent pasta, highly recommend.- Canard Aux Figues (Figs, Wild Mushrooms, Camargue Rice): Nice flavors, though fat under-rendered and a bit chewy - need a bit more cook time. Also over salted. Enjoyed the unique rice which accompanied. Good concept, just needed some tweaks.- Cote De Veau (Baby Carrots, Chanterelles, Tomato Confit, Marble Potatoes): Very sizeable veal chop, classic flavor combinations, a tad under salted but nice otherwise.- Millefeuille Aux Fraises (Puff Pastry, Strawberries, Fromage Blanc Ice Cream): Classic - nicely done.- Vacherin Aux Framboises (Honeycomb, White Chocolate, Raspberry-Thyme Ice Cream): Quite unique texture, have never had anything quite like it, but found enjoyable and light.Beverage:Began with a martini ($21) which was prepared as I like, while my wife enjoyed the 2015 Charles Baur 'Cuvee Charles' Riesling from Alsace ($15). With dinner, we loved the 2013 Chateau des Tours Cotes du Rhone Reserve ($85), a smooth and elegant representation of the region. It paired nicely with the meal. Think the beverage program here does a good job.Service:- Our waitress was pleasant and generally good overall; she did realize when runners brought out only one of our hors d'oeuvres and acted quickly to rectify.- Sommelier was very nice and knowledgeable, we ended up with precisely what I had in mind and had a good interaction.",2,0,0,D.

Right amount of salt/sugar balance. The fried pig trotters were good, but not very memorable. Anything fried is usually good. Salmon spread also good but not very memorable. The crab/corn soup was good. Enjoyed the sea bass entree. Right amount of crispiness in the skin.

It was nice and crispy but the sauce toned down the richness of the pork. The ravioli was pretty good too, except that it was served on a rather large plate for its portion size. The chocolate mousse was wonderful too, except that it was kind of hard. I had to use quite a bit of force to take a bite with my fork. The quinoa with the ice cream was a little bit unusual.

3.0,8/14/2017,"I came here last night with my family after seeing Kinky Boots on Broadway. It was our first time trying restaurant week in NYC and we were very excited. We arrived a bit early for our 7pm reservation, but they were kind enough to seat us at our table. Upon sitting down, our waiter promptly came to our table to get our drink order. We ordered sparkling water and much to our surprise, they make and bottle their own sparkling water rather than selling a brand name bottle, like Perrier. My only issue with the sparkling water was there there was not enough ""bubbles"" and what was there disappeared pretty quickly and became flat. However, on the plus side, there was always someone ready to refill my glass and there was no charge for the bottle. Because we were ordering from the restaurant week menu, we ordered our appetizer, main course, and dessert at the same time.For the appetizer, I had the Salmon Rillettes. This was absolutely delicious but I wish I had more of the toasted baguette to put the salmon spread on. I ended up using a fork to eat the rest of the salmon. Maybe I could've used the rest for the small pinch of side salad. For the main course, I had the Agnolotti, which is ravioli stuffed with duck confit. This was something that I've never had before so I knew that I had try it. I loved every bite of it. The sauce was amazing and I wish I had more of it. The ravioli were small, so unfortunately, it wasn't filling. I ended up having to take a couple of bites of my mom's stuffed veal. My only issue with the ravioli was the plating. It did not look elegant at all. It literally was ravioli and some baby mushrooms spooned into the middle of a flat plate, so by the time the waiter brought it out to me, it looked like it had slid a little off center. I think a curved dish, like a shallow bowl, would have been a better option. For dessert, I had the chocolate mousse with lavender ice cream with a cup of coffee. The ice cream was creamy and the lavender taste surprised the taste buds. It flavor wasn't overly powerful but it wasn't your typical vanilla ice cream either. The chocolate mousse a little bit disappointing because I was expecting it to be soft and silky, like mousse typically is. However, cutting into this mousse slice with my fork required a little effort, like they had just taken it out of the freezer a few minutes ago. I know the desserts are not made to order, but they could've gave it some time to soften up seeing that we had ordered dessert in the beginning of our meal. My mom, brother, and I had ordered a cup of coffee to go with our dessert. The woman who had brought out the coffee had gone to another table first and then came to our table. I guess she didn't have enough space on her tray for everything because she had 3 saucers/spoons but only 1 cup. She quickly realized that she needed 2 more cups and she sent someone to get them. Our waiter passed by shortly after and looked at our table in shock and confusion. As soon as we explained to him that the young lady had gone back to get 2 more coffee cups, he quickly walked towards the kitchen to make sure the cups were coming. Even though we are very understanding people and rarely cause problems at restaurants, we felt that this was very unprofessional of an upscale restaurant. If the woman did not have the space on her tray she should've made a separate trip to our table instead of trying to do multiple tables in one trip. My last issue with our dinner, happened near the end. After we had finished our bottle of sparkling water, we were not asked if we wanted another one. Instead, 2 people (one of them being our waiter) had tried to fill our glasses up with regular water and we had to tell them that it was sparkling water in our glasses. It surprised me that they did not know (or forgot) what our drink order was.Overall, I felt that Vaucluse was a great restaurant to try out and I might go back again to try foods on the regular menu. However, there are a few things that I think need to be worked out before they can earn a 5-star rating in my book.",2,0,0,J T.,"New York, NY",80,55,62

2.0,8/4/2017,"Umm. I don't understand all the awesome reviews of this place. Granted, we came for restaurant week, but so did others who gave stellar reviews. The ""grilled"" leeks did not have any trace of grilled flavor or markings, and were on the bland side with a odd, slightly sour one-note sort of flavor. The pied de cochon was okay, kind of like a thick chicken patty but made of ground up pork feet bits, something you might find in a school cafeteria trying to be fancy. The vegetable risotto kind of punched you in the face with a strong salty flavor I couldn't quite place, but it might have been decent had they toned it down a notch. The duck confit agnolotti were fine, but a few of the ravioli had hard under(/over?)cooked corners, and I didn't detect much (if any) duck or duck flavor. And the veal breast was not at all what we were expecting, rather than a solid cut of meat it was ground up veal bits reformed into a weird veal patty type thing. At least it had a decent crispy sear on both sides? To top it all off, everything was served lukewarm and nothing was hot enough, not even the bread. The desserts were fine. That's really all I can say about that. I gave this place two stars rather than one because nothing was inedibly horrible, and service was fine enough considering the whole restaurant week thing. But, even at restaurant week prices I felt ripped off, so I can't even begin to imagine paying the ~$40 or so per usual entree. Talk about underwhelming food. I think the only people who come here and like it are those with too much money who wouldn't know delicious food if it walked right up to them and jumped into their mouths. Huge disappointment, and this place makes me rethink ever trying NY restaurant week again.",1,1,1,Melissa W.,"Sparta Township, NJ",219,359,7
5.0,8/2/2017,"Vaucluse was chosen as my 3rd restaurant week option for the Summer 2017 season and oh man did it not disappoint. This place easily deserves 5 stars on accounts that it hits all points across the board. My girlfriend and I got reservations for 7pm and it was pretty busy already by the time we got in. If you are planning on doing restaurant week make sure you get a reservation via open table.Vaucluse is an upscale French restaurant and the decor and atmosphere feels that way as well. The restaurant is very minimalist but it has enough where its clean and very aesthetically pleasing. Seeing that this is high end I would recommend wearing a button up or jacket.For food my girlfriend and I decided to order 2 appetizers from the regular menu plus the restaurant week items.AppetizersPate en Croute- This dish was one of my favorites and reminded me a lot of Paris! The pate was very fresh and delicious. The dish does not come with bread so make sure you ask for a side of it. Spread the pate on the bread for a delicious appetizer!Escargots- I was not a fan of this dish at all. It was probably my mistake for not fully reading the description. i thought this was full snails from the shell but it actually is snails mixed in with rice. The dish itself was okay, just tasted mainly like butter and rice. I would not get this dish again.Pied de Cochon- Oh man this dish was so good! The pork was super fatty and delicious. It had a nice crispy outside and a very soft and juicy inside. You cannot go wrong choosing this restaurant week appetizer!MainAgnolotti- This dish was very delicious! Each of the ravioli was stuffed with duck confit, I never had anything like this before but loved every bite. The dish also wasn't overly saucy which I loved. Dessert Mousse au Chocolat- I felt that I have been saying this about every dish but the dessert was amazing! The chocolate was super rich and hits the spot after a nice meal. You will not go wrong getting the mousse if you are a chocolate fan.Overall, I had a great experience at Vaucluse.

The pig trotter was fun and well-balanced, while the grilled leeks was (to my surprise because, well, leeks) light and flavorful. We then tried the Agnolotti and Veal. The Agnolotti was very good, though I felt like it was missing something. The veal was delicious and I loved the crispy polenta with it. For dessert we had the Milledeuile aux Fraises, Mousse us Chocolat (yumm), and the Parfait aux fruits (also light and yum).

2.0,7/28/2017,"Restaurant Week and the Wine is a $9 bargain, the rest...The social historian and expert on class differences in the US Paul Fussell wrote ""top class food, resembles British, being bland and mush, with little taste and no chances taken"" This two-year old bastion to Park Avenue taste and style has mastered the attitude and the menu which promises intriguing tasteful treats in an non-threatening setting but validates Fussell's observation.  So our $29 restaurant week meal consisted of a smoked and fresh salmon mélange that tasted mostly of egg; a chopped and fried pig foot nugget, dressed with some greens and something pickled that was mostly crunchy, salty and generic, a bronzini provencal (bronzini is the go-to fish for this summer's restaurant week menus.I guess everyone was beginning to complain about the ubiquitous chicken and salmon) that had some tomatoes and other veggies mixed on top of it and tasted mostly steamed and a duck confit ravoli with seasonal savories that reminded me of steam table cafeteria ravolii and where were those savories.  And the two tired desserts--a fruit parfait, mainly whipping cream served in a droll container that reminded us of a plastic ice cream cup, and a light chocolate mousse with a dark chocolate crust that actually tasted like chocolate.  But the $9 glass of wine was unique, for its size, perhaps 12 oz, and it's quality.  The service, perfunctory, and even though we had late reservations--2:00 p.m. and the front dining room was full of empty tables and the back dining room also, we were led to the last table in the back dining room in the corner next to the serving entrance.  I couldn't resist commenting, ""Oh, at least we're still in the dining room""  the hostess looked blank.  The bus boy regularly walked through with bread but we were invisible.  When we finally got his attention, his basket was virtually empty.  He fished two pieces of multi-grain out and disappeared through the service door.  I understand it's restaurant week and restauranteurs are a cynical bunch but this is my second visit to a restaurant I had doubts about the first time I came after it opened.  But the imaginative menu writer remains and it tells a great story!",0,0,0,Melanie R.,"New York, NY",11,42,0

4.0,5/28/2017,"Came here solely on the basis of Gotham social burger club voting their White label burger #2 of best burgers of 2016. Upscale restaurant with very tentative service. Waiters by the walls watching your every move but not to the point of being intrusive. Not your casual dining experience  so be prepared for the diners dressed in suits and cocktail dresses. Beautiful decor with spacious tables for two which include big couches to sit side by side with your partner in crime. We started with the pate just because we have to try pate everywhere we go. Great flavors and texture. The fat with enclosed crust was a unique touch to the average dish served with a side of bread. The spicy mustard on the side was a great compliment to the dish. Now, for the star - White label burger. Was it good? Yea...was it the best I had? No. On first bite, I didn't get that wow factor. Cooked to a perfect medium rare and was very juicy in the middle. The tomato jam and dijonniase was good but not the best combination I've had either. It was more of a leaner beef blend that I like. It was good but not sure if it meets my top 3 burgers.

We felt that the level of service was just right; not overbearing, not rushed, not awkward. Best way to describe it was it felt personal with a pleasantly professional touch.My only complaint, is that I am not familiar with French wines. Italian and Californian, yes. So when I asked our server for help in choosing, I think she shared her favorites instead of suggesting my preference from taste & balance.

I had heard great things about the burger here, so I figured it was time to check it out now that there was a flash deal at play.The cocktail menu is pricey at $18, but very nicely crafted.We shared that burger (the ""White Label Burger"") as an app. The patty is an aged beef blend; the cheese is fontina; and it's topped with a tomato jam and dijonnaise.They cook it nice and rare, so you don't lose any of that aged funk to the heat. It's a potent burger, and part of me still loves a classic roadside American burger better, but this is kinda like having a steak between a bun. Definitely nice.And like any good French joint, it's served with frites.These were pretty good, but not quite on the level of Boucherie, which has now become my benchmark standard, to which all French fries must be compared.We also tried the calamari stuffed with lobster and rice.Unfortunately there wasn't much lobster to this dish. In fact, I couldn't really find any or taste any in the bites I had. In any case, the tomato sauce was nice, as was the cook on the squid.My wife had some rabbit, truffle and cheese ravioli for her entree. This was a small portion size for $25, but they at least warned us ahead of time that it would be.They were excellent. Each raviolo seemed to be partitioned, with one side having the rabbit, and the other side having the cheese.Of course, I had steak.This was served with some dressed watercress, but I quickly brushed that bullshit aside. I sliced it up so you could see the perfect cook temp on this prime NY strip steak.This was actually a steak frites, so it came with more fries and a peppercorn au poivre on the side. Well, I asked for it on the side so I could get this intense shot of foodpourn.Did you just bust? Because I did.I ate every bite. It was a great little steak. I didn't detect any aged flavor, and I assume they would have advertised that if it were the case. Not too bad at $44, but on par with the Jubilee rib eye steak frites that I had just the other day for $40. 8/10.We shared a lemon tart with basil ice cream for dessert. This was really pretty, and tasted a bit like a key lime pie with the herbaceous basil ice cream on top. We liked this a lot.Oh and I should mention that this place also brings out an amuse at the beginning, as well as petit fours at the end. I only snapped the amuse, which was a tiny popover style bread with a truffle cream filling. The dessert capper was a chocolate hazelnut bite.",6,0,1,JohnnyPrimeC. C.,"Manhattan, NY",199,213,4300

5.0,2/17/2017,"Vaucluse has been on my radar for some time now, as part of our burger tour de NYC. (Don't judge me for coming to a nice French restaurant and ordering the burger!) We had a reservation and were promptly seated in the massive restaurant. The place is broken up with partitions which allows the noise level to stay at a reasonable level and it has a more intimate feel, even though it is really huge. Like the space, the wine list was huge. Given that I'm not a professional on wine, let alone French wine, the Sommelier helped us pick out a reasonably priced bottle which was great. Always nice to have a professional pick something for you, then blindly picking by price or name. My friends and I started with the Epaulettes, which was rabbit ravioli with an awesome soft cheese called reblochon, and a black truffle sauce. OMG - so delish. The portion we ordered was the smaller one (and we each had 3 pieces of the ravioli) -They were small - bite size. This came in an entrée size too.We also ordered 2 white label burgers to share, as we usually do and a side of our favorite - Brussel Sprouts! All of the food was really excellent and the burger ranked pretty high on our list. The service was fantastic.

3.0,2/6/2017,"My husband and I just came here for my birthday dinner this past Saturday night.  We had a 7:15PM reservation and we were really excited to try Vaucluse being so close to home. We arrived at the same time as an older couple whom we gave the lady to go ahead.  The maitre'd smiled at them right away warmly, had the coat check take care of them and led them away, not a word or eye contact to me.  I repeat our reservation to another person that was behind the desk after the maitre'd walked off with the other guests. No response. Another group came in and the hostess return to assist them and then another couple came in and was directed to their seats.  The maitre'd came back and then summoned a waiter to take us to our table without even a glance at our direction.  It was the rudest greeting I've ever encountered at such a nice restaurant.   We were seated at a table directly on the side of the waiters' traffic route on the mezzanine level where there were mostly empty tables.  The waiters were nice and sommelier who also took our order was very nice.  At some point, I saw the maitre'd walked up and down my aisle and glanced over but never greet or made eye contact.  Very cool and aloft for someone who represents fine dinning. The ambiance was nice, sleek, modern and very much our taste. It reminds a little of Per Se and Daniel. For starters, I had the head cheese and hubby had the rabbit ravioli.  The headcheese was a large serving and definitely heavier for me while I enjoyed stealing hubby's rabbit ravioli (delicious!). For entree, I had the bass with clams and potatoes. Very well balance dish.  It was mellow in taste where one seafood flavor does not over power another.  Hubby had the steak with foi gras which was amazing.  We dined over a bottle of nice 2012 Chateauneuf-Du-Pape. The wine was absolutely delicious.  We were very happy with wine and food. We ended the night with cappuccinos and a shared sorbet which I have to give credit to the chef for stellar flavor on such a light sorbet but yet so flavorful.  My favorite part of the dining experience is the food. I would give the food a 4 stars but the maitre 'd's snobby reception and dismissal of my existence for a good 7 minutes has me questioned either she hasn't had the best training or that I wasn't wearing a fur coat.  I was really expecting better service given that I came here for my birthday dinner.

Others at my table had squid ink pasta with lobster (a table favorite), octopus (very good, my personal favorite dish of the day, but not the best octopus I've had) and oysters. My main course was a pan seared sausage with assorted root vegetables. It was very salty. I was glad it was topped with a bright, acidic salad but it was one of the few dishes I can remember not wanting to finish at a restaurant. I had chocolate cake for dessert which was good, but nothing special. Their ice cream and sorbet flavors were varied, interesting and tasty. As for service, it was polite and attentive but we struggled to get good descriptions of dishes (even receiving innacurate descriptions).

3.0,11/26/2016,"I came to Vaucluse yesterday evening with two other guests. For our appetizer round we ordered for the table and got the escargots, the veal tongue carpaccio and the rabbit pasta (epaulettes). The rabbit pasta was by far the best among them and one of the most delicious I've had in the altamarea group's varied restaurants. The veal tongue carpaccio came in at a close second. The escargots however were rather lackluster. The rice and the sauce it came in paired really well but the escargots didn't actually bring anything to the dish. They weren't particularly flavorful, the texture changed little as the rice gave a chewy element on its own. I would definitely skip this next time.For mains I had the bouillabaisse, one of my guests had the rabbit saddle and the last the butter poached lobster. The rabbit saddle was very good, flavorful and cooked adequately. The butter poached lobster was also similarly well done. I did not enjoy the bouillabaisse. It came with shrimp, crab meat, mussels, clams, and a white fish that I believe was sole. Sea urchin was mentioned but I don't believe I ever saw it. These items were all fine, cooked well and belong in a bouillabaisse. The accompany grilled bread with rouille was also without issue. I took two primary issues with it; the addition of spiciness didn't really improve on the dish in any capacity that I could determine and the usage of bell peppers lurking in the soup were nearly overpowering versus the comparatively delicate seafood.For desserts we had the gateau, the vaucluse tart, and the citron tart. The gateau was triple layered with chocolate, coffee cream and a caramel layer with a salted caramel ice cream. I thought it was pretty good. The vaucluse tart I thought was the best, effectively combining the best flavors of a Ferrero Rocher into one gorgeous dessert. A deep rich dark chocolate, hazelnut glace, pralines, the works. This was my favorite of the options. The citron tart was bright with lemon and citrus flavors and if that suits your palette is a great pick.Where I really took off points however at Vaucluse was for service. I rarely if ever nitpick on this, frankly most of the time it does not bother me. If I get enough water, a decent explanation of what I'm ordering if I ask and get checked in on every now and then I'm fine. I was however NOT at all happy with the way I was treated today. I attempted to order our appetizer and pasta round first as we hadn't entirely settled on our main courses. I was abruptly told by the waiter that the restaurant does not accept incomplete orders and that he would just gives us more time before promptly waltzing off. I do not mind the policy. If that's how your kitchen handles things the most efficiently that's ok. But at least be marginally more polite about it. It could easily have been a ""I am sorry but due to the busyness of the kitchen this evening we won't be able to take an incomplete order, so I will come back in a few minutes to check in on you again."" Succinct, to the point, and it doesn't make your customer feel like they are an imposition upon your time.My second ""stand out"" issue was after my appetizers were cleared, one of the men came back and dropped off dessert menus at our table. Our waiter promptly intervened before I was handed a menu much to my confusion but shouldn't there be enough communication between staff to know what stage of the meal I am at? In most cases this is an honest mistake and one I can roll with, but prior actions have already put a bad taste in my mouth and now I am questioning why exactly am I paying for a fine dining experience where no one actually seems to care about me as a customer.I would recommend Vaucluse if the service issues didn't bother me as much as it did. I certainly thought most of the dishes were delicious. But I'm not going to pay to get treated like this.",1,2,0,Hamilton Y.,"Manhattan, NY",3,51,2

4.0,10/24/2016,"After our delicious shopping spree on Madison Ave. we had a delectable lunch at Vaucluse. It's one of our favorite restaurants in our neighborhood. Luxurious and comfortable, posh and elegant. The cuisine is refined and with lots of classic French dishes that brought me back to our many vacations in Paris. To start, I had the Poireaux Vinaigrette, my date the Caviar sélection, paired with a gorgeous vintage champagne Salon 1999 (a great vintage, very well poised and vibrant). The poireaux melt in the palate and the crunch of the almonds and saltiness of the anchovies was divine. The caviar was stunning as usual. For our mains I chose the Bar en Croûte de Noisettes which paired perfectly with a Nuits-Saint-Georges ""Les Saint Jacques"" from Cruchandeau.I deliberately chose this wine while telling a very funny story about a certain creature. ""Les Saint Jacques""  is about to be upgraded to a Grand Cru status in Bourgogne. One of the best Lieu-Dits in Burgundy, although I prefer the wines from Henri Gouges.

My cousin brought me for my birthday dinner on a Sunday night - and it was completely packed by 8pm, which is not surprising. The waitstaff is incredibly hospitable and thoughtful, without being overbearing. We shared the octopus and beef tartare to start - definitely the best octopus and beef tartare I've had. I had the trout for my entree and my cousin had the steak frites. We split a bottle of Montrachet throughout the meal and had the chocolate mousse for dessert.

I also had the scallops with herb butter sauce, which was cooked perfectly and came with onions. The beef tournedos were served a perfect medium rare, and melted in my mouth.  It came with baby carrots and a potato puree with a sweet demi glace.   The portion sizes were quite large for a pre fix and we very much enjoyed our meal.

5.0,9/22/2016,"was fantastic. Lived in NYC and work in f&b hospitality. Was invited by a friend to come, so I brought a friend as well. We sat at the bar next to the service station. Was served by Izzy. Man knew how to make a cocktail, like wow! I have a Ketel martini, my friend got a old fashion(twice) then I got a sazerac (twice) , overall we were very impressed (we are both managers). Even watching him make cocktails for the service bar was impressive (from a professional and management view as well)Now the food, amazing. We have the octopus, happy hour flatbread (to share) and the diver sea scallop appetizer. Everything was superb. The Diver scallops texture was to die for, the octopus and grain textures complimented each other like a marriage, and the flatbread was rich but light at the same time.We were complimented with extra dishes as well, a seafood black squid ink pasta, I love black squid ink pasta, always order it whenever I see it, this dish was out of this world! The spicy and creaminess, and the perfect texture of the pasta with add ins of seafood garnishes(lobster, mussels, etc), as you can tell, I was in love with it.Then dessert, a duo of gelato with a light sugary crisp pastry and a custard type mouse (can't remember) with grape concord granita and raspberry jam? They both were the most perfect ending to this experience. I have never been a fan of Concord grapes in anything, besides eating grapes alone, I found a a new passion in gelato and grapes with this introduction. Overall this experience was up lifting and awakening of a standard of service and food I have never experienced in NYC before of almost a decade. The environment, the personalities of the service staff, the drinks and the food, it is untouchable. Even better than Jean George by light years. I will be returning, constantly and I think my friend (who has only live in NYC for a year) will bring his wife here as well.I do not understand the comparison to the Seasonsbefore here in this property, this place stand way on its on and it a category barely touchable.",2,0,1,MK M.,"Jackson Heights, NY",285,367,119

The location at 100 East 63rd Street is not for Millennial's as it attracts an older more sedate clientele as in the past when the space belonged to the Park Avenue Cafe and later to Summer, Fall, Winter, Spring. What drives the sedate monied crowd away is the loud music in the front dinning room which interferes with conversation of table mates.

3.0,8/19/2016,"Vaucluse- is Micheal White's French white-linen restaurant on the UES.- a great place to get great table service for Monday night dinner. Especially in the summer.- serves a decent juicy White Label burger, slathered in Dijon mustard with a tin of hot-from-the-oil freshly fried fries- a way to get a decent dish of squid-ink spaghetti with fresh perfectly tender lobster, mussels and sepia (cuttlefish). The seafood was cooked to perfection: tender, plentiful bites of the ocean. The pasta was a little dry (even though it was coated with butter) and missed a briny taste but the breadcrumb toppings were crispy buttery perfection. Unfortunately, my friend hated it. - a bit pricey for the average Millennial (each main dish ranges from $ 26- 64)- a way to meet new staff (apparently they train the new staff in the summer) (How did I know they were new? Because the young host (~26 yo?) shook my hand for a little too long and said very earnestly ""Nice to Meet you!"" (which was sweet and refreshing!)

Surprisingly hearty portions, $8 RW wine was a generous pour as well as a nice quaff.Service: the busboys were warm and friendly compared to the server, but overall, the service was typical Park Avenue ladies-who-lunch spots: superficial and selective politeness to outsiders.

All of the food was beautifully plated with just the right amount of food (if not a little more). I ordered the leeks, bluefish and pavlova. I never knew leeks could be eaten chilled, but Vaucluse definitely surprised my taste buds in a positive way. The bluefish was perfectly paired with a corn succotash, and the pavlova had the perfect texture. I really liked how the main flavors - the tartness of leeks, the juiciness of fish, and the creaminess of custard - stood out in all of the dishes.

4.0,4/13/2016,"Came with a Gilt City credit voucher because this restaurant is definitely pricey French cuisine. If you enjoy a classic fine-dining experience, this is a good option to try. Think small portions, multi-course meal, prim and proper service, a tinge of pretentiousness. The bread is amazing! Get everything in the bread basket. For a light appetizer, the Poireaux Vinaigrette (grilled leeks, toasted almonds, mustard seed vinaigrette) was delicious. The leeks are cooked down to a soft, sweet, and mild vegetable; the topping was deliciously nutty and lemony. The Chef is somewhat known as a pasta genius, so I had high expectations for the Épaulettes (rabbit & reblochon cheese ravioli, black truffle). It was definitely tasty, but a bit too precious for me. Filet de Veau Façon Rossini (veal tenderloin, foie gras, caramelized onion tartine, black truffle jus) was my favorite - highly recommend. Perfect coins of tenderloin alongside a ridiculously unctuous tartine/tower of foie gras, crunchy toast, onions, who knows what else but it was so delicious I didn't think about it too much. A PERFECT bite altogether. The turbot was rather disappointing, a little too simply prepared and a little too acidic. The Paris-Brest (pâte à choux, caramelized white chocolate, praline croquant) was more of a breakfast pastry-type of dessert, like a cream puff filled with nutty mousse. Really light and airy yet satisfying.4 stars for food, 3.5 stars for service, 4 stars for atmosphere.The service was alright, perhaps not as warm and welcoming as I'd hoped (especially after the voucher was mentioned). The food is classic rather than unique and interesting.

That is not to say that the dishes aren't traditional, for they are. But everything from plating to ingredients seems top notch.A standout was the salad Lyonnaise, the best I've ever had, with an absolutely perfect poached egg and sinfully good fried croutons. And the pomme frites that came with the burger were superb, crisped with duck fat, and almost hollow.A compact selection of wines by the glass manages to offer a little of something for everyone.

The space is beautiful.  The bar looks like a great place to hang around.  Our table was nice, with plenty of room. The waitstaff were excellent.  There were a couple of hiccups in the service, but they weren't a big deal.  Our group had cocktails and wine by the glass.  The prices were fair for this kind of restaurant. We were brought the wrong wine once- but fortunately, the waiter brought the bottle first so that we could taste it.  The sommelier took away my glass of wine because the waiter had poured it into the wrong kind of glass.  The issue was managed with aplomb.  The bread was excellent and we were offered refills a few times.  It took a while to attract our waiter's attention to order drinks.  Appetizers were really good.  The salad eaters of the group were happy.  I loved my pate.  The accompanying cornichons and mustard were really good.   We all ordered the evening's special, beef bourguignon.   It was a bit more high concept than usual, with a big chunk of short rib as the centerpiece.  It was served with excellent noodles.  We had ordered the (amazing) pomme frites to share.  They didn't make it until after we were done with our entrees.  The manager was very apologetic and comped us for the frites and for dessert.  I didn't eat dessert, but my friends ordered chocolate mousse, a Napoleon like pastry and a fruit plate.  They were all really good.  We spent around 2 1/2 hours in this restaurant.  We were not rushed.  It felt more like dinner in a friend's house than in a restaurant.Overall, a really nice evening.  4.5 stars.  Just a couple of mis-steps away from perfect.  I was particularly impressed with how the staff handled the few (very) minor service issues.  I would definitely go back.",2,0,0,Joel S.,"New York, NY",37,675,16

Vaucluse delivers modern, yet classic French fare. Let me start from the beginning:After being seated and searching the menu, we were served our drinks (dirty martini for me), a selection of breads (the best baguette I've ever had), and an amuse bouche (salmon on a cracker, but fancier).My friend and I started with the beef tartare which was a good portion size. I love the pickle and toasted baguette accompaniments. As our entrée, we shared the veal tenderloin and the entrecote, both of which were delicious.The best part of the meal, however, was the duck fat French fries.

Was grateful for this since we arrived starving. Though the restaurant was packed we were able to order and get the meal started in no time!Porte-parole cocktail was refreshing & strong (came in an adorable small glass) Nice selection of bread prior to the first course Started with Saumon Fumé (smoked salmon) while my other half ordered the Épaulettes (rabbit and cheese ravioli). Both were delicious but I have to admit his dish was a clear winner!!Continued the meal with a half bottle of red wine (Cháteauneuf-du-Pape Piedlong 2013)... Pleasant For the main course I enjoyed the Macédoine de Homard (lobster; supplement) and my other half continued with the Filet de Bar (wild striped bass)... If you're on the fence about what dish to order and you love seafood, go with the lobster! It's fresh and guaranteed to satisfy Prior to dessert my other half had to order another plate of the Épaulettes (rabbit and cheese ravioli)!! To conclude our meal I had a selection of 3 artisan cheeses served with warm cranberry pecan bread... I specifically asked for soft cheeses only... Yummmm My other half had the Paris-Brest. He finished this eye catching choux pastry in 2 minutes... Obviously too good to put his fork down Overall, price / quality ratio of this meal was spot on...

So it was with mixed feelings that I decided to try out chef Michael White's new French outpost in the Midtown East. In spite of its not-exactly-prime (other than for after work crowd) location, this place was buzzing, and my table for two was unable to score a reservation on a Friday night (admittedly with only a day's notice). We chose to battle with the masses in the lounge area - it was a bit of a disorganized free-for-all, but we managed to score ourselves two seats at the bar after waiting for about twenty minutes. Everything after that went swimmingly..My bourbon and elderflower cocktail was delicious. I told the bartender that it might have been the best cocktail i've ever had. My date also enjoyed her poire fizz (in spite of hesitations of it containing raw egg, she does not appear to have food poisoning today!).The food was pretty phenomenal. We split a chicken and truffle soup, a duck confit ravioli and a seafood bouillbaise (daily special) with a side of brussel sprouts with lardons. Pretty much everything hit the spot. The soup was rich and delicious (a very generous portion of truffles dominated the flavor profile), and the pasta was cooked to perfection. The duck within the pasta might have been some of the best I've tasted. The bouillbaise was a little classed up with the plates arriving with a selection of seafood, and the soup being poured in table side. Brussell sprouts were well done, and the bits of lardon (bacon) never hurts!Definitely more Marea than Nicoletta; I was very glad to have gone.",8,0,0,Ashwin T.,"New York, NY",166,217,108

4.0,11/23/2015,"KenScale: 8.0/10Michael White has already produced several Italian winners in NYC, from the ethereal Marea to the pasta temple Osteria Morini to underrated Ristorante Morini. Recently, he and his Altamarea Group decided to try a new French venture in Upper East Side showcasing elevated brasserie-style food. Obviously, I had to explore what the kitchen at this new restaurant was turning out; overall, the experience was quite satisfactory and there were a lot of dishes to like.As my dining companions and I showed up for a dinner of four on a Sunday evening, we were able to sample a variety of dishes. All Michael White restaurants have displayed strength in the pasta department, and the epaulettes (rabbit and reblochon cheese ravioli with black truffle) was another winner that displayed wonderful balance of flavor. Beef tartare was also expertly prepared, with very nice texture. I haven't had escargots (snails) in a while, and the one at Vaucluse, which comes with red carmargue rice, feta and garlic-parsley butter was solid, although the butter could've been toned down a little. Chilled Maine lobster with celery root and green apple was also alright, but the portion was a bit too small. For the main dishes, there were more mixed results. Pan sautéed trout with lemon brown butter and capers was nicely cooked, but the seasoning could've been slightly toned down. The roasted duck l'orange for two, which seems to be quickly become a signature dish here (also gaining a bit of notoriety with whopping $46 per person), was also juicy and tender, but not to the level that I think would justify the price tag. On the other hand, entrecote (aged prime center cut ribeye) was fabulously cooked, and the fries that came with it were also very delicious. Don't skip the desserts at Vaucluse. Millefeuille with milk ice cream here was one of the best desserts I've had this year (not only does it look beautiful, but the rich and decadent flavor was simply mind-blowing), and the Paris-Brest with caramelized white chocolate and praline croquant was wonderful as well. Presumably due to its location, getting a reservation wasn't particularly difficult and the restaurant definitely seems to cater more to older crowds and the dining area seems a bit more on the formal side. The restaurant has a full bar with extensive French wine selections.

5.0,9/17/2015,Great experience for us. I took my fiancée one Saturday night to check out the latest from the Alta Marea Group and she loved it. These guys are pretty much at the top of the game in my opinion.  The price is great for the quality  and every dish we had was delicious. We listened to the server's recommendation and had a few signature cocktails.  My favorites were the lobster ravioli and the signature Julep. Chef Michael White was even there and checked on our meals. We enjoy everyone of the groups restaurants from Nicoletta to the Morini's and this is another great addition. If you don't know what to get; try any pasta! Do it!,0,1,0,Rob Z.,"Manhattan, NY",103,72,11
5.0,9/17/2015,"Lived up to the hype of the reviews and recent publications.  Everything from the ambiance right down to the bread (they bake in house) was on point.  On a busy Saturday night, we never felt rushed, our server was extremely attentive and did a wonderful job guiding us through the menu. With a vast wine list it was easy to navigate something to pair with the incredible food. The tuna crudo was delicious as was the watermelon and heirloom tomato salad.  The Maine lobster dish was perfectly prepared and very tasteful.  I personally loved the veal and foie gras with black truffle jus.  Just the right balance of flavor and portion size for that rich dish.  For dessert we enjoyed the crisp meringue and the souffle.  The manager Tye was very friendly and mentioned they may soon be serving a brunch/lunch menu.  A fabulous addition to the UES and I hope the attention to detail does not fall off once this place settles in.  Cannot wait to try it again soon!!",1,0,1,Mark A.,"New York, NY",132,24,12
5.0,9/16/2015,"Amazing experience, with service and dishes to match. I came here last night just 3-weeks into the opening and the places is bustling with clientele of all ages. The hostess Rebecca was quick to have a table ready for my 8:15pm, and Jack was a delightful, knowledgeable waiter who did not steer me wrong with any dish. We started with the Tuna Crudo, had two pastas; Crab Macaronis and Duck Confi Ribbons, both delicious and vibrant as Michael White's dishes tend to be. We then shared the rack of lamb, and tuna, both a perfect medium rare. Then topped it off with the  Paris-Bierut dessert, which was just the right amount of sweet and light to end the evening. Would definitely go back for more!",0,0,1,Lynn P.,"Brooklyn, NY",77,4,2

5.0,9/14/2015,"Michael White has done it again. Vaucluse is a big hit -- from the moment you walk in the door. Let's start with the butter. They churn it themselves and it is delicious. Flavors I have never tasted in butter. Add this to the perfect bread and if the meal goes downhill, you would still be happy. But it doesn't. The pasta is the usual perfect pasta from Chef White. The main courses excellent. I had the blanquette de veau which was pretty perfect. My husband's Bar a la vapeur was also excellent. Our chocolate tart was outstanding. Hopefully Chef White will earn some more Michelin stars.",2,0,1,Tony R.,"Manhattan, NY",11,219,1
5.0,9/13/2015,"This was the ultimate dining experience. The staff and service were warm and attentive without being intrusive or overbearing. The food was extraordinary and phenomenal: from the cocktails right down to the dessert. The atmosphere was comfortable, elegant yet casual, intimate yet friendly. The decor was inviting, I cannot make enough positive comments about Vaucluse. A must visit for any occasion!",1,0,0,elisa c.,"New York, NY",11,1,0
3.0,9/12/2015,"Upon entry, my eyes lit up. What a beautiful atmosphere! Calm, quiet, and elegant. The bread and butter were delicious! I mention this because they were noteworthy. Everything was great until my husband ordered the bouillabaisse. The flavor was good but the shrimp were nearly raw. Inedible. We told the waiter and he brought the plate to show the chef. I guess the chef didn't much care. He took a glass of wine off the bill. We weren't looking for a discount. In the end, I got the impression that that's the way the chef likes to cook the seafood. Be prepared for this and make a specification of need be.",2,0,0,Hannah S.,"New York, NY",0,10,0
5.0,9/11/2015,"L. Wylie, Village in the Vaculuse (3d ed., 2009) is a wonderful book.   Vaculuse, however, is very much the Manhattan version rather than the small town in the south of France.   The service is excellent.  Attentive without being obsequious.  Goldilocks chose the portion sizes.  The ambience has a buzz without being a hard rock concert.  The flavors are interesting without being obscure.  As my colleague said:   This is a home run.",1,0,0,Brandon B.,"Manhattan, NY",1,13,0
5.0,9/10/2015,"Did not expect it at all. If I could give 4 Michelin stars I would. Great food, perfect sitting, warm service. We had salmon and chicken for main course and let me tell you those guys outdone any competitors by far, honestly. Wine to choose from- great selection and price. Can not wait to go back, which is tomorrow",0,0,0,Will B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0
4.0,8/31/2015,"What a pleasure it was to enjoy dinner here on the restaurant's opening night. Having been to many of Michael White's establishments it was quite exciting to get to shake his hand when he came around the dining room to introduce himself. Now my review may be a bit biased because I was there on opening night and everyone was on their best behavior but you can smell great food and equally great service a mile away and these two things will surely not dwindle as the weeks/months go by. My boyfriend has a severe allergy to eggs and we have NEVER experienced a more courteous and attentive server to his allergy, and we have dined at many of this city's fine establishments. The server would check on food, like the bread and petite fours upon signing the bill, even before we had them brought to our table.It was refreshing to know we were in good hands. There are two separate dining rooms, upon entering the one to the left is definitely more hip and lighter in spirit where the one on the right is a more formal dining room (like upstairs Ristorante Morini) where you can tell the UES big wigs were sitting ( I was blinded by the bling on these 75 yr old woman). I only wish they sat us in what appeared the younger section of the restaurant as I despise those stuffy dining rooms. The food was delicious and I would like to commend the Chef on assigning REASONABLE UES PRICES FOR THE PORTIONS!!! We didn't break the bank. To be more detailed, two glasses of wine, two appetizers and two entrees were $150 before tax/tip. I would call the menu more modern french, you won't see too many classic french dishes, which again was very inviting. Do sample some of the pastas even though you are not at one of his Italian spots, the homemade farfalle with lemon creme fraiche, salmon roe and smoked salmon was divine and paired nicely with the a lighter seared scallops entree which the server did recommend and I followed her lead. We also had the beef tar tar (what a size..) and the swiss chard wrapped trout (o.m.g). No desserts for us but the options looked equally as great.i give it 4 and not 5 stars as I mentioned I don't like sitting in stuffy dining rooms, all the more my fault for not speaking up though. Highly recommend getting here a.s.a.p.....Bon Appetit",0,0,0,Brittany N.,"New York, NY",0,10,0
