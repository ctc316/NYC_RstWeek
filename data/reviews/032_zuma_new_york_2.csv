4.0,4/28/2019,"Very over priced and that's why it doesn't deserve 5 stars. Nevertheless, the miso black Cod was to die for! The fish just melts in your mouth and the miso sauce goes so well with it. It is $42 for a small slab of fish but it's definitely worth it if your celebrating something special. The Chilean sea bass was disappointing and really didn't have much flavor. The sushi was ok but I think it was because i ordered a super basic roll (California roll). The Japanese sweet potato was a great side. If you pls on getting dessert here, I highly recommend the sundae with banana ice cream and toffee. It is probably the best Sundae I have ever had. It has these chewy toffee cake like bits in it and it goes perfectly with the ice cream. Again, great food but very over priced",0,0,0,Sara N.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,5,7
4.0,4/26/2019,"Fancy Japanese with authentic japanese chefs with amazing beautiful decor. Of course it's pricey. The indoor is humongous with sushi bar. There is also upstairs which seems to be a bit less formal and better for drinks. Also the restroom is on the 2nd floor. The walkway to the restroom is fantastic. Sometime they have sakura tree. It has such pretty decor, I can live in there. It's nicer than my room.Food is really good too. Sushi and rolls are all above average compared to other upscale sushi restaurants. They are served on all very pretty plates. It's not a place where you would dine everyday, but definitely worth a try. It just feels nice eating in there.",0,0,1,Jae C.,"Westwood, NJ",4,132,353

2.0,4/18/2019,"I'm really disappointed in my favorite restaurant. Went last weekend with 4 other couples. Spent well over $1500 on our bill. Tons of drinks, apps, entrees, huge dessert sampler. The customer service we received was unacceptable. They messed up our drink orders from the second we sat down and it went downhill from there. No one seemed to want to be bothered with us. We were given a lot of attitude from our waitress. She even slammed a drink down in front of my friend for an error that was on her part. Drinks and sushi was ordered that never even came to the table. I don't know what happened. I thought it was an off night but was reminded by my girlfriend that last time we went they forgot about her chicken dish and she received it after everyone already finished eating. Someone spoke to the manager expressing his frustration and we watched the manager say ok and then went to hang out by the sushi bar without taking any action to correct all of the things that went wrong with the dinner. I absolutely love the food and atmosphere, it's seriously a 10/10 but until they figure out their service I have to give them 2 stars. :/",0,0,0,Bianca R.,"Valhalla, NY",122,5,0

3.0,4/12/2019,"I went here for my girlfriends birthday and it was a decent experience. The waitress didn't seem like she wanted to be bothered with us and gave me the check before I could even ask for it. I wanted to get more drinks but felt like she didn't want to deal with us at all. I ordered the Rib Eye and my girlfriend ordered some skewers. For $40+ I was shocked how mediocre the Rib Eye was. Honestly I've tasted better at chair restaurants. The food was incredibly disappointing and the price tag was insulting. After eating we went upstairs to the bar area where everyone seemed to be more accommodating and friendly. All in all it was a very mediocre place with a lovely interior decor that presents itself as a high end restaurant. However, the most important aspect of the restaurant, the food, was extremely boring and bland. I would probably never visit again as the food was that insulting.",0,0,0,Nashawn O.,"Baldwin, NY",83,22,0

2.0,4/5/2019,"Went on the Friday after Valentine's Day and I don't know if they got destroyed the night before or what. Cocktails at the bar were quite well done.Hostess came to seat us, only to arrive at unprepared table and be taken back to the bar. Once seated again, had to wait 20mins just to get drink order taken.Once our food order was taken about another 20mins later. The food came out in a strange order. Then while eating, server came by to say the kitchen was closing, we advised her our steak and calamari hadn't come out yet. She said the steak was on the way but it appeared that our calamari had been forgotten, as it magically appeared. Unfortunately, it was most definitely not worth the wait. It was extremely bland and dry. I guess at least it wasn't rubbery but I had to drink it in soy sauce to get any type of flavour out of it.The bill was about the only thing ""epic"" about this experience.

5.0,4/2/2019,"My wife and I came to this restaurant for our 5th wedding anniversary and it was a great experience. She wanted ti splurge a bit and I agreed. This restaurant doesn't look like anything from the outside but the interior design is very contemporary. We didn't have a reservation so they asked if we mind dining at the sushi bar area as they were full,  we agreed. And good thing we did. The food tasted fanatistic and the presentation is on par with what you see in those fancy Top Chef TV shows. We had a great time here, the wait staff were attentive but not overly annoying, eg: bugging us if we were just sitting there having a nice conversation after we finished our food. The manager came by and checked on us as well. I do have to say that the portions are very small so do not expect to be full when ordering what you think you want/need. We knew that from the pictures on Yelp beforehand. And the restrooms are very trendy as well, definitely something to checkout.",0,0,0,J L.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,8,13

As a vegetarian going to an upscale sushi place is daunting but the server made sure to point out great options and even brought out a dish that was off menu.

4.0,3/26/2019,"Came here last night for dinner and can't stress how much of a positive experience I had. We were seated promptly at 8pm and were immediately greeted by our gracious host who took the entire evening to guide us through our first experience at Zuma. Our host explained the different options we had to choose from whether we were into raw or cooked dishes. He explained they have 3 separate kitchens which cater to our choices for the evening. The dishes are all served in tapas style, which make it good for sharing and indulging in the variety of culinary options offered. We started off with a tasty garlic and sweet chilli glazed edamame dish along with a fried softshell crap appetizer with wasabi mayo dressing on the side. The crab was tasty and paired wonderfully with the wasabi mayo. While I'm not a fan of wasabi, it was pleasing as the taste was not prominent and easy to ingest. We then moved on to the chicken skewers (3 orders in fact) lol - My dinner mate has a selective choice for cuisine. The cubes were all perfectly grilled and again perfect for sharing. For our main, we selected the skirt steak along with a set of 8 prawn, avocado rolls. The steak was cooked medium and tender. The roll had a slightly fishy taste at first but I quickly acclimated to the taste which was fairly enjoyable. The rice was slightly dry - something I'm not used to when I've had sushi rolls in the past. For dessert we tried the malten chocolate cake drizzled with a caramel sauce and a scoop of ice cream. The chocolate was rich and perfect for sharing. For drinks - An Old Fashion, which they make with a Japanese Whiskey infused with their personal twist. The orange slice came branded with the Zuma icon, which made for good presentation. We were seated closely to other tables which made for pleasant conversation. We made friends with a delightful couple from the UK, who told us they also have a Zuma in London - def. gotta try it! Everyone we spoke to warned us about the bathroom mission. The bathrooms are apparently located pretty far from seating so don't wait til the last minute to go. The ambiance is sexy and classy, great for a date night or special occasion with a group. I loved taking in all the architectural specs of the place and would recommend it to try at least once.",4,2,4,Elizabeth M.,"Brooklyn, NY",347,114,202

We've never eaten anything here that wasn't good and we normally do the omakase.  I wouldn't come here for the sushi, it definitely isn't a sushi spot.If I had to describe the omakase against others around the city, I'd describe this one as high margin and basic (like basic b**** basic), but we just happen to like all the things they serve like the sesame spinach, miso black cod, massive dessert bowl full of ""exotic"" fruits, chocolate molten cake and passion fruit coconut custard.It certainly isn't high end or elevated cuisine so I'm not sure the pricing makes sense.  If you are looking for value, this isn't the place for you.",2,0,0,Andrea B.,"New York, NY",1,18,27

2.0,2/1/2019,"Really disappointed with this place. I was excited to really check this place out since it was nearby work, but honestly, after coming here I regret even entering the place. So I had lunch here for restaurant week. We had the dumplings, and the salad, with the salmon terriyaki, california roll, and yuzu cheesecake. The food was alright. It's good but it really wasn't anything special, however the one thing that I was really pleased with in terms of the food was the Yuzu Cheesecake. The presentation of it was lovely, and the textures of the plate was quite impeccable. Now what really brought me down about this place was the service. We had a reservation at and came a little earlier than the set time, yet we spent a good 20 minutes waiting. It didn't make any sense to me because the spot that we were reserved for (sushi bar) was actually empty the whole time. Maybe it was the lack of servers, idk but the service just went downhill from here.Maybe it was our waitress, but she definitely was not very professional. She was never very attentive with our waters, and it was difficult to try to get attention. It's really the little things. It took forever to get our plates taken away, and when we asked for a menu midway our meal, the way how she gave it to us was just very rude almost as if she just did not care. My mom was a little bewildered because the menu almost hit her face. I really wanted to like this place because I had high hopes for it, but honestly its all at a loss just because of the poor service and the food is most definitely not worth it.",2,0,0,Jennifer L.,"Kips Bay, Manhattan, NY",103,48,119

Gorgeous interior - similar to many upscale Japanese restaurants like Tao and Nobu 57. Cool bar and innovative drinks. We were escorted to our table upstairs which had a drastically different vibe from the feel downstairs. It was like we were in a different (not trendy, dark and quiet) restaurant. It's an enormous space, and the downstairs is definitely happening!We shared everything and all dishes were good, though nothing truly blew us away. The sushi pieces were my favorite. Very fresh, flavorful and tender/melt in your mouth. Shishito peppers were mostly spicy, which was great. Rock shrimp was ok - small portion. Raw Yellowtail app was delicious. Tuna and salmon tartar was an interesting presentation. Flavorful but almost too chopped.Sushi pieces were delicious (salmon and yellowtail). Soft shell crab roll was good (don't expect tentacles because you won't get them), and yellowtail jalapeño was fine. Cod was cooked well and the sauce on the side it was served with was tasty. Wish the fish had more miso flavor. Ribs were tender but needed more sauce. Drink list was vast - we had a nice bottle of sake we shared. Overall, a hot spot to hit post work.

He tried really hard to sell us the tasting menu but since we had a lot of picky eaters in our group we chose to order individual items. Waiter was not friendly as he should have been.

And the booth we were seated in was like a little oasis in the middle of the restaurant. Our waiter basically ordered for us, and everything he decided to feed us was fab. Standouts were the yellowtail and the miso cod, but we enjoyed everything we tasted (spinach/sesame, sushi, rock shrimp tempura, calamari, chicken). The lychee and rose petal martini was divine....I gave it four stars instead of five because it was pretty expensive for what it was.

3.0,8/13/2018,"Bad idea to go for restaurant week.. mom and me were excited about trying some quality Japanese food. We were greeted by a warm receptionist who escorted us to our seat. Zuma's ambience is gorgeous and interiors are superbly done.Then arrived our server, on knowing that we were there for restaurant week her smile reduced to half and she plainly asked us to select our pick.I picked salmon tartar with Yuzu. It was quite nice but it was barely 2 crackers to finish your tartar with. Next I ordered vegetarian tempura, the mistake for which I take full ownership... Like who orders that unless you re a vegetarian in a Japanese restaurant? Was oily and bland.For appetizers my mom ordered chicken skewers... Umm well no comments... It was just average. For entree she tried salmon teriyaki with pickled cucumber, it was a good quality, well cooked and tasty salmon, we rlly enjoyed that. All throughout our server was least interested in us.. she would drop by transactionally with no smile and zero warmth.Highlight of our lunch was the Yuzu cheesecake (for which we paid extra $8)with Strawberry sorbet and sesame. Not only was it aesthetically eye pleasing, it was equally delicious in taste. The cheesecake was of melt-in-the-mouth texture, not too sweet and has the right amount of cream. That paired with Strawberry sorbet and sesame crunch was a deadly combination. Full marks for the dessert.I think it's a bad idea going to high end restaurants like Zuma coz they kinda treat you second class but 50% satisfied with our menu tasting.",2,1,1,Meghna S.,"Manhattan, NY",36,85,126

5.0,7/26/2018,"One of my favorite dinner experiences in NYC. My sister and I were in town just to eat. Yes, we go from DC to NY all the time to fill our weekends with yummy food. Reservations were really easy to make on open table and it was really easy to find. Lucky for us we were staying 2 blocks over and found is very convenient to walk there. From the moment you walk in the mood is set with the dim lighting and dark hall. Very intimate and chic. The host sat us quickly in a perfect corner table with half booth and half chair seating. The high ceilings are stunning to look at and gives the restaurant a grand feel keeping with the intimacy of the atmosphere.Dave (SHOUT OUT TO THE BEST SERVER) was our server and was very sweet from start to finish. I told him about my gluten-allergy and he handled our orders with such care and attention. As my friend did all the ordering, he pointed out what I couldn't have and brought substitutions. He brought tamari sauce, calamari, and checked on us frequently. We had the following items on the table, all were mouth-watering:1-Ika no kari kari age (crispy fried calamari with green chili and lime) GF and amazing2-tsubo-miso gake hinadori no oven yaki (brely miso corn fed chicken oven roasted on cedar wood. NOT GF but my friends devoured it. 3-Grilled corn- literally melted off the cob, GF, and to die for. 4-Lobster no oven yaki (Lobster in butter sauce) GF and the best I ever had. 5-Pecan sundae- NOT GF but again, my friends inhaled it in seconds. 6-Zuma chocolate special- flourless cake with ice cream, GF, and perfect combination of sweet, hot, and cold. David was so attentive and while he and other staff checked on us, we never felt bothered or rushed. It was amazing to see the restaurant so lively and busy and they allowed us to take our time and enjoy the food. Soon after, the manager Sean came by to check on us which was really nice. He was very engaging and genuine. That is rare. Before you leave, go upstairs and enjoy the restrooms, they are so pretty. And great places for a quick photo upstairs.

5.0,7/22/2018,"My food-savvy daughter led us to Zuma.  She tells us that Arianna Grande comes here a lot with her new fiance, SNL's Pete Davidson.  ""That's cool,"" I said to my daughter, ""maybe we'll run into them there.""A celebrity sighting is always fun but really, we all know what really matters is the food.  Is the food worthy!!?  That's the question!When we checked in, they made us feel like rock star VIPs.  It was a great start to an evening.  What a difference it makes to have quality staff at the door checking guests in!  Why don't more restaurants get the importance of this??!Speaking of rock stars, our waiter Byung was one.  He was literally the perfect waiter.  He took time to engage with us, give us enthusiastic guidance on the menu decisions.  He heard us talking about the small size of the table and he offered to get us re-seated at a larger table.  Crowded Friday night, so it was clear he had to pull strings to get it done, but he got it done!  Since we changed tables, the waiter was supposed to change too.  But when we playfully complained about losing him, again, he pulled strings and served us anyway despite being out of his section.  Request Byung.  Your night will go swimmingly.  :) Cocktails were all winners.  Talented bartender(s) for sure.  We had the RHUBARB, MOSCOW MULE and the one with PASSION FRUIT/RASPBERRY.  We hardly order more than one cocktail, but last night we were motivated to go the second round.  Back to praising our waiter Byung...we heard us talking at the table about how the Moscow Mule was light on the booze and the next one came much stronger (just like magic).  That's what a good waiter does naturally - you don't have to ask.  They just pick up on your cues and make it happen.ROCK SHRIMP (5/5)  We've had the ROCK SHRIMP just about everywhere including Nobu (where the trend probably started).  The portion here is much less than what we've had at other places, but that said, the quality of the shrimp and presentation had all the others beat.  Dusted with matcha powder, and fine threads of dried red chili.  I could go bulimic on these.ALASKAN KING CRAB (5/5)  Again, portion was modest but quality was great.  Sweet morsels of crab meat with a buttery ponzu sauce. I could eat a bucket of this.BEEF TENDERLOIN (5/5)  Two 4 oz. pieces, cut up into tender, medium rare cubes, slathered with some teriyaki and sesame seeds.  Nice char.  What a great side dish if you're feeling carnivorous!YELLOWTAIL (4/5)  If you've had this elsewhere, and chances are, you have -- it's just like the rest.  Not bad at all, just the same thing you've had elsewhere.  Thin slices of yellowtail in a tangy brine with some bite from the jalapeño.  By all means, try it if you haven't had it!NIGIRI ASSORTMENT (5/5)  It all checked out FRESH.  Their cuts are slightly thinner than other places but it didn't bother me because the freshness and flavor were both there.Everything about our visit tonight rang the bell.  From our initial entrance to the hostess lobby, to our exit,  Best restaurant so far in on our NY trip.  Zuma makes me want to use a word that I don't normally use - delightful.  There, I used it.  Our evening was delightful thanks to Zuma.Need I say it?  Yes, we will def go back and YES, you need to get there!",20,11,13,Darien R.,"Milpitas, CA",777,738,465

It also happened to be the day after the tragic loss of Anthony Bourdain, someone who opened my eyes to trying new things. We arrived before dinner started so we went upstairs to have a few cocktails before we ate. The bar area upstairs is beautiful and the cocktails were fabulous. I had the rubabu which was an amazing mixture of sake vodka and rhubarb--so refreshing. I had also ordered the wasabi mule, but when it was served, it didn't compare to the rubabu cocktail. When we closed out our tab, the bartender had removed the half-empty mule--not necessary but incredibly kind of him. We proceeded downstairs to a table and had one of 3 tasting menus they offer. I am not adventurous when I order food for myself, but I will generally try anything once. Each course that was served was more delicious than the last, I wish I had pictures. The Chilean Sea Bass sashimi practically melted in my mouth. Red snapper sushi was to die for...and the watercress salad had a dressing that makes my mouth water thinking about it--kind of a wasabi vinaigrette. And the ""main"" was sliced steak covered in truffles, king crab legs in a wasabi crème and a beautifully cooked piece of fish.

I felt like a celebrity walking to my table with fancy lighting everywhere. Second, the drinks were to die for. I drank the Sakura Sour, a more upscale take on a whiskey sour made with Japanese whiskey and added flavor with peach bitters. The group I was with also ordered the Golden Pineapple drink which was served in a giant pineapple goblet of sorts. Next, all the food was delicious. As someone who isn't a big fan of seafood, I was sold. The sashimi was great, the tuna and salmon tartare was phenomenal, and the shrimp dumplings were really yummy. My favorite dish was the skirt steak with chimichurri, it was sooooooo good. To end the night we had a bunch of desserts. Of all the things my table ordered, my favorites were the flourless chocolate cake with marscapone ice cream (holy cow I didn't know I needed marscapone ice cream in my life) and the strawberry cheesecake.I've gotta say, I was pretty impressed.

5.0,3/8/2018,"Wow, hot spot alright! People kept strolling in as I was waiting for my friend to arrive. It was one large group after the other and a slew of private events happening on a random Feb. 2018/Wednesday night. There are two levels of dining spaces and the super high ceilings make it visually appealing and feels airy when you walk towards the seating area on the main floor.  You don't feel crowded at all despite the foot traffic.  The wooden decor and rich caramel colored leather chairs made it very inviting. This place boasts three kitchens too!My friend and I opted to sit at the Chef's table (Fireside) to see some of the cooking action.  (You can opt for the sushi bar too but I chose this one).  It was entertaining to see the sous chefs grilling and prepping the delicious looking seafood, veggies, and watching them make robata skewers.  Smelled good too and it wasn't like in my face so that was good.We started with cocktails and enjoyed ours very much, so much so that we ordered the same drinks twice! My choice was the Raspberry Passion Fruit cocktail ... sweet and refreshing.  Had just the right amount of alcohol.  Onto the food:  - Yellow tail sashimi appetizer was excellent, super fresh and nicely plated.- King Crab roll was scrumptious.  Meaty and neatly rolled.  Totally recommend this.- Entrée:  Miso Black Cod for my friend.  I had a taste and the wasabi citrus sauce was a good surprise.  The fish was covered in the sauce and surprisingly didn't over power the taste of the cod.  The miso complimented the wasabi citrus really well.  This was well executed in texture, taste, and presentation.  Yum.- My Entrée:  Rib Eye steak with wafu sauce and garlic chips.  I wish there were more garlic chips ... so good.  It should be offered on its own (as a tasting).  The rib eye was tender and juicy.  Totally a fan.  The wafu sauce, a vinaigrette type of dressing (think soy sauce/rice vinegar, and mirin), was the perfect seasoning for this rib eye.  Would totally order this dish again but of course, I'd like to try more of the menu.  Especially on someone else's dime!  This is a place to impress if you can hack it or just treat yourself for a special occasion. Desserts:       A must try - the green tea and banana cake, served with coconut ice cream and a toffee sauce.  A gorgeous presentation and the flavors all worked well together.  I tend to not have a sweet tooth and would prefer a cheese plate any day but this, this dessert knocked it out of the park.  I would come back for this and the sushi any day!  One other dessert my friend ordered, seasonal but if they have it, get it.  It was a deconstructed pecan pie...see photos, they speak for themselves.  Awesome sauce!Side note: per a reliable source, this place has plenty of celebrity patrons. If you're lucky (as I was), you'll spot a few of 'em inside - likely upstairs.Also, they do participate in Restaurant Week but only for LUNCH.  Reservations recommended all the time...don't think you're getting in without one unless you're feeling lucky.",8,3,6,Jeannie T.,"Queens, NY",372,532,7611
2.0,3/7/2018,"I almost always have great experiences or try to emphasize the great things rather than the bad but I was dissatisfied coming here. Concierge at my hotel recommended this place and the car took me over. Their doorman seems useless, hate to say it but if he's not opening doors, hailing cabs or serving some purpose why're you there? I was seated in front of the chefs which I thought would be a lovely touch to dinner but they were younger guys talking and joking around. Usually the chef is the show, not in this case. The food was lackluster at best. I ordered edamame, tiger prawns tempura, some sashimi.. Nothing was memorable and I hate to waste food but I left a lot behind. The fish didn't seem very fresh. I think what totaled dinner for me was the obnoxious, rude and loud dinner party a few feet from me. Not only were they apparently trashed, but glasses were broken and profanities were shouted. Not classy, not okay and other guests shouldn't be subjected to this on their night out. I'm 21 and carry myself better than a table of 40+ adults!!  There was no effort to calm the behavior or rectify the situation and guests were evidently bothered by them.

I honestly didn't like anything expect the cooked fish dishes and the rice with mushrooms. The dessert array is also interesting. The alcohol was also pretty good. I am a huge foodie and as you can see really tried a variety of dishes I thought that the fish was fishy and the portions were small without the best flavors.

The waiter also forgot something and instead of offering to take it off the check, he rushed off to get it as we were putting our credit cards down to pay. He was polite, but perhaps a little inexperienced.  Overall, I would suggest they tone down/refine the trendy vibe and focus more on quality of service and food.

Both years had a small open bar for folks and a sushi table (pre-made, platters set down) to the back.Last year was passed appetizers, a failure in the crowd near the door tackling anyone with a tray and food didn't get to the others until late -- lots of hungry people.This year, better - a few passed appetizers:- cod on lettuce, not as good as the miso cod elsewhere- chicken skewers with spring onion was good- a salmon tartare on a piece of bread was goodOther dishes were arrayed in stations (beef, chicken, sushi, etc.) which made for a much happier crowd. Drinks passed around (a special tequila drink) and the servers kept the area clean.Better spacing, still need to improve on the food (definitely not Nobu), but overall a better experience this year especially as this is one of the few sushi venues near this location that can accommodate a larger crowd and an after-party when the main party is over.",6,3,3,Hank C.,"Jersey City, NJ",1732,2830,1188

My friend & I were excited to try this new restaurant and had recommendations from friends about how great it is. We are two well dressed, attractive women who basically got seated behind a wall where the waiters put the orders in. This, in an earlier seating, when there were many other spots open. We moved our seats and ordered the rock shrimp, the dynamite spider roll & the yellowtail roll. The rock shrimp was ok. I was expecting Nobu quality and it definitely was not. The sushi was bad as well and to make it worse the soy sauce was so salty! We asked for low sodium and apparently that was it! You couldn't even use it on your sushi, it was that bad! We are not picky and will pretty much eat anything especially since we were so hungry. But we were so disappointed in the first course, we did not bother to even try an entree.

The last time I had a waiter try to upsell me into the $100+ Toro Tartare 3x until finally taking no for an answer.  The time before that I had a server take our order, and not check back with us for 30 min.  When he finally returned we asked where our appetizers were, and he informed us that ""Good food takes time"".

Loud lounge music, though all tasteful and easy to have a conversation over.DRINKS: Cocktails are delicious. Wasabi Mule was a personal favorite, and the Julep is worth trying as well. Tried the chocolate martini after dinner, but it wasn't for me. APPETIZERS: This is where Zuma shines. Their menu is designed for sharing - highly recommend trying a lot of small dishes rather than dedicating yourself to your own entree. The sushi rolls are delicious, with fresh fish and rich tastes. The robata grill appetizers are all served sizzling hot, with perfectly cooked meats and fish. Loved the shishito peppers, and the tomato eggplant salad is a must-have. FOOD: Honestly, by the time we got to the mains, we were pretty full from the appetizers! Be mindful of that when ordering. I had the robata ribeye, and it was absolutely incredible. DESSERT: Hidden tip for reading this far. The kitchen can prepare a special dessert for you, exotic fruits served on a ice-tray in a tropical assortment, with one dessert per person (chef's selection), for something like $16 each. Get it, it's absolutely worth it.

They even have a catwalk corridor to the bathrooms which makes you feel like a model on the runway.To really enjoy the experience, I suggest coming 10-15 minutes early so you can sip on the libations at the gorgeous bar on the first floor. The cocktail menu changes slightly but I do recommend the Julep (tequila based mixed with passion fruit, grapefruit) or the Cooler (tequila based). Both were refreshing and not overpowering.The first two times I dined in was on the first floor. Once was to try the Omasake Signature and once with the Premium. The Premium Omasake was by far the winner because we got to try a larger array of their best dishes. At the end you get this HUGE dessert boat filled with sorbet, chocolate cake, banana green tea cake, exotic fruits & more... like nothing I've ever seen before! My second visit was for my birthday and we had a little mishap with a worm found in a friends salad. The manager took care of it by offering us free drinks, although we're not sure if it was actually reflected on the receipt. Flash forward 1.5 years, I returned to celebrate a birthday. My group of 5 dined in on the second floor which has more of a loungey vibe. We opted in for the Omasake Premium and had different dishes this time, all the finiest tasting. The third time around was my favorite experience so far because 1) Felt more comfortable in the lounge seats 2) server was super friendly and accommodating (he recommended fresh wasabi for us and came back to grind it for us) 3) food was delicious.Prices are a bit on the expensive side. $138/pp for the Premium omasake and the dessert special is not included but the food and experience is worth it.

I told her I'm joining a party of 4 girls for a birthday. She asked for the name and I spelled it for her. I don't know if she misheard but she retorted ""nope, no one by that name."" Luckily, someone else stepped in and sort of guessed who I might be joining and escorted me to the table. No one asked to check my coat - an option that was made available to all the other girls at the table.The food was great, though! I sampled some of the vegetarian items including the edamame, a vegetarian maki roll, an asparagus appetizer and the famous Kinoko No Kama Meshi - a rice hot pot with freshly grated truffles.The ambiance is lovely, the place is great - table service was pretty good too.

We sat down at the bar upstairs to have one drink before our table was ready, which was somewhat pleasant, and when we were invited to be walked to our table in the lounge upstairs, we got stopped on the way as the host was interrupted by a busboy. As we stood there for 5 minutes, awkwardly, the busboy then turned around and ran into me with his full force; the white wine went all over my dress and tips of my hair. Accidents happen, and while the busboy was very apologetic, the host simply ignored the situation, didn't offer napkins or at the very least to bring me a new glass of wine, given the full glass I had just ordered was spilled all over me. Food in Zuma is almost never a disappointment, but the black cod we ordered was terrible.

I was glad my coworker made a reservation for the 5 of us, because by about 12:30 the place was packed! Immediately upon entering the restaurant we were wowed by the sleek and modern decor of the place. From the dark entry area to the large stone and wooden design in the restaurant, it was all very upscale feeling. I decided to opt for the Ebisu lunch menu for $35, which comes with a miso soup and 3 course meal. I was happy with the number of options available. Upon ordering I selected the avocado tempura, salt grilled branzino, and almond cake. All of it was fantastic! If you're one of those people who like to pick the skin of your fish, I'd advise against doing so with the branzino, so much of the great texture and saltiness comes from the skin of the fish! Only negative part of the experience I'd have to say were the sushi rolls. Based on what I tried, I'd stick to other entrees. I can think of a lot of other places better for sushi, and for some reason the carrot in the two rolls we got (eel and shrimp tempura) just tasted awful.

She was so rude and unprofessional she didn't even tell us to wait or anything...literally all of us standing there like lost children, after 10min of waiting I started getting really annoyed (this was on my birthday mind you)I ask her a question and she pretended like I didn't even exist and on top of it ignores me while answering someone else behind me,wow sorry for being pretty that you have the need to be stank to me because you're ugly and miserable you have to take it off on customers. I had to ask someone else if they could Please let us know where we would be sitting or if we should stand there at the entrance next to coat check. Unbelievable, like how do you leave a group of people just standing there for no reason without even saying anything to them. It's not like we are club rejects either. All of my friends that were invited are either in entertainment/hospitality/journalism,modeling and acting industry. So I know it's not our appearance and even if we were nobody's we were there to spend money and try to have a nice time. Unfortunately this was by far the worst birthday experience I ever had. By the time we were seated the seats they gave us were wack and it's not like they were sold our either there were plenty of open tables. At this point I didn't even bother saying anything because I was already furious. My friend ordered wine as soon as we sat down and it took half an hour to receive it we literally had to ask our server where is the wine, it's as if they didn't even care for our business. Our dinner was overpriced and all I had was a salad. Totally Not worth it. Yes the foodIs tasty but for the price you're better off going somewhere else. The venue is cool but that's where the money goes...just to look good and hip but they treat you like shit....with the experience I received there I would NEVER go back again or refer anyone here. Their staff is AWFUL! There's way too many restaurants in Manhattan that are actually top of the line so for Zuma staff to act like they're the only restaurant in town is sad because that's how most places go out of business.

2.0,5/5/2017,"Zuma was a pricey disappointment.Let's start off with the good -- the place is spacious.  If you're looking for a place to host a group event and have a huge (probably corporate) budget, then Zuma isn't a bad choice.   Also the interior is lovely, so I'm happy to give +1 star for beautiful surroundings.(....buuuut I also suggest looking at HOWL AT THE MOON in Hells Kitchen for group events.  That place has the same feeling of spaciousness, and since it's more like a dive bar, the hit to your wallet will be less severe.  In this economy, all I expect from corporate holiday parties is free drinks, so HATM is perfect.)Moving on to the food -- we ordered a variety of sashimi and rolls.  The rolls came out on a serving plate, but the sashimi came out on a bed of ice.  Ugh, it was awful!!!  I'm so spoiled by the amazing sushi bar at Sushi Ann where you get room temperature sushi that is melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  My internal narrative on seeing the on-ice delivery was that:1. Zuma received frozen fish from the fish markets2. Defrosted them3. Realized they didn't get high quality fish, so they put the fish back on ice in order to dilute the flavor.4. Serve chilled on ice to clueless tourists who don't know what good sushi/sashimi isI would not come back if you're looking for legit sushi.  There are too many amazing sushi places in NYC to waste a meal at Zuma.",7,5,1,Elle W.,"Santa Monica, CA",208,285,372
3.0,5/2/2017,"Typical, super trendy restaurant in New York. We came here for a friend's birthday dinner on a Thursday night. This restaurant is far more massive than it looks on the inside, they had a dj spinning along with a packed restaurant. If you are looking to bring a first-time date, this is the spot! If you are hoping to get an intimate, date-night to catch up...definitely is not the spot! We waited for some time to get our table and sat by the bar...I ordered the lychee rose petal martini. It was WAY too tart and definitely expected it to be a bit sweeter. My boyfriend ordered the julep which was also not good. However, the wasabi mule was pretty decent. In terms of food, the waitress was super accommodating given that we had a rather large party in tight space. She made sure that I knew what my vegetarian options were and remembered everyone's orders pretty thoroughly. The edamame dumplings and artichoke tempura were both mediocre and to be honest, overpriced. The avocado salad was also okay.

I ordered the prix fixe lunch & all I basically had was the appetizer and the soup. I left a $20 on the table and got the hell out of there. It appears that unless you are Asian, white and/or having a business lunch you simply won't be treated well. Life's too short and there are too many other good Japanese/Asian-fusion restaurants in NYC to be bothered. It's unacceptable. I've had such a great stay--this was the only really awful experience. Lesson learned. My sense is this is the type of place that won't dare improve because they know people will keep coming. But if you're like me-an experienced solo traveler (with money to spend), and very discerning about service and quality, you'll skip this joint.

I generally prefer smaller izakayas for Japanese food and places like Bohemian, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised of the quality.

As a person who has dined at the finest Japanese restaurants across all of NYC, I would say that I know what fresh fish and flavorful dishes taste like. I ordered seared tuna which was bland and stringy. Seared tuna is supposed to have a slight crisp texture which it lacked. The cod which was considered a chef's signature dish was burned, contained tremendous bones (which is very unlikely in a Japanese restaurant when the chefs are trained to debone fish), and did not have any flavor whatsoever. The spicy tuna roll was minuscule, contained yet more bones and lacked spice. The house salad, which they brought out after our entrees, had no dressing and when I requested a side of dressing I was appalled at the consistency of the dressing. The dressing was overly sweet and too chunky. Lastly, I ordered green tea ice cream which was the worst green tea ice cream I have ever tasted. I could have gotten a better scoop of ice cream at your local dingy sushi corner restaurant. The only nice thing about this place is the presentation, which made the food look interesting and delicious, but don't be fooled!!

1.0,12/30/2016,"Horrible! My cousin and I came in at 6:45 and we ordered a bunch of the dishes that the server recommended. It seemed promising. The place is big and has an attractive decor and nice ambiance.Our server was pleasant enough. Our cocktails were good. We tried the Bellini and the elderflower gin cocktail.The edamame was fine. Tuna and salmon sashimi were OK, not the freshest but acceptable. I found the tofu appetizer to be pretty disgusting. It was really watery and soggy and I did not like the taste at all.I ordered the $85 toro tartare with white truffles and this was seriously disappointing. The truffle  didn't actually smell or taste like truffles at all (or anything for that matter.) I order truffles regularly this time of year. I know what they are supposed to taste like. Maybe this place is banking on their diners not knowing any better. But as someone who eats truffles regularly and does know when something isn't quite right, this was a very disappointing dish.The worst part of the night was when just as we were in the middle of eating the ONE really good dish we ordered (the black cod entree) the ""manager"" (who was about 22 years old) rudely interrupted us to tell us that we had reached the end of our allotted time slot and would have to leave immediately.My cousin and I are two young women, we had a reservation, and we each had full cocktails that we were still drinking, and we had entrees on the table that we were still eating, (including the $85 plate of truffle toro tartare that I was going to finish just on principle.) We had been there less than 90 minutes, and were seated in a table way off to the side with empty tables around us, and we were planning on making the most of our night and ordering another round of drinks and desserts. But then the servers and bussers clamored around us and abruptly cleared our plates. That pompous, rude and completely unprofessional manager stood hovering over us until he saw that I had taken my credit card out of my wallet.Of course, since we were being kicked out of our table, we weren't asked if we'd like to see a dessert menu (yes, by the way, we would have loved dessert!) The manager saw that I was obviously not happy about being kicked out of my table. When they  brought my check (I still tipped 20%) the manager said smugly  ""I'm sorry if you feel offended in any way, but these are the rules of Zuma, and you should have read the rules before making a reservation. Did you read our policy?""I told him that no, I hadn't read the rules, I simply called and made a reservation. He then scampered away and came back a few minutes later to say if we really wanted to stay (yeah right!) that maybe they could work something out and we could try to find somewhere to sit or stand at the bar upstairs. Sorry, I don't think so. We would have just liked to stay at the table that we reserved to finish our dinner like normal people. On my way out I let him know that I was also in the hospitality industry in NYC and this isn't how the NYC hospitality industry works. It's just bad business. The restaurant was not busy. There were empty tables. We wanted to spend more money in their establishment. But instead we were embarrassed in front of other diners and asked to leave at 8:15 pm. Zuma, you're in NYC now, and wherever your  manager came from, you should really educate him (and probably yourselves) on how to run a successful NYC establishment and not humiliate two ladies who just wanted to have a nice dinner and blog about our great experience. Instead we had a truly awful experience and I am writing this instead. You ruined our night.The food was mediocre at best, and the behavior of Zuma's management was simply appalling. Obviously I do not recommended anyone come here. If you bring a date here it could potentially be humiliating. There are so many MUCH BETTER Japanese restaurants in NYC.

Very good service in both scenarios and the food is honestly very good. I don't think it's necessarily very authentic Japanese - but it tastes damn good. Highlights: rock shrimp tempura - a nice departure from regular tempura with a spicy kick, the miso cod that's so rich and it melts in your mouth, shishito peppers that come with this addicting dipping sauce, buttery corn from the grill, and a very expansive cocktail menu.Your credit card will be hurting, but trust me that Zuma is not just a flashy place, the food here is worth coming back for.",1,0,0,Cat S.,"Manhattan, NY",447,371,0

However there was zero communication that the bar had a limited menu. I'm used to being able to order off the regular menu at the bar and a tend to even prefer a dining experience there so  this was very disappointing. The service was totally subpar considering we ordered a lot of food. The waiter totally ignored us, never even noticed that our drinks  were empty for ages until we had to alert him. Even when we did -he still did not take away our old empty glasses. The new ones arrived each time without any words or eye contact and they were just OKAY. Nothing to rave about. I tend to tip well at the bar considering I like the experience of chatting with the bar tenders, drinking , and dining- not this time!To make matters even WORSE we discretely told the bar manager and she confronted him IN FRONT OF US, putting our bartender/waiter in an incredibly awkward position which I then confronted her about.

Second: The waiters at this place are clueless.  In order to turn more seats they let the waiters take orders and then have other busboys or closest person take care of the table.  I placed our order with the waiter, then the bus boy filled in half the dinner to act as the second waiter. There was no coordination between the two and they got numerous things wrong.  They simply forgot to bring drinks 2 separate times we asked. A third waiter brought me a soda and poured it for me.  He then spilled 1/4 of it all over the table, looked at me and then just walked away without cleaning it up.  It was actually comical.

1.0,6/16/2016,"Just ate here last night...LITERALLY HORRIBLE. I will absolutely never come back here again. Not only was the food average, but our server talked to us maybe one time. He kept sending over a different lower level server to take our order, etc. The menu is extensive, very overwhelming and confusing so we asked for help. Obviously we asked what dishes are popular and well known since it is a fairly hot restaurant. The woman just advised us on the most expensive item from each section of the menu. In general I felt like I was being rushed out the entire night and the food was VERY BELOW AVERAGE. So what if the décor is nice? If the food and service are terrible, why would I come back? We also spent a ton of money and left feeling very hungry. Each dish is about 2 bites and you have to order like 15 dishes to feel even remotely full; which will set you back about $500 if you also order drinks.Definitely do not go anytime soon.",0,0,0,Elyssa S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,20,3

Part of my job is to entertain clients and I've spent well over 15,000 at this restaurant over the past 6months. The service model here is broken and if it continues to treat customers poorly this will be another new restaurant with lots of potential that fails in NYC.

1.0,6/4/2016,"I went there with good friends and was very excited. We had a very nice server, who took time to talk us through the menu and everything we ordered was delicious. We were having a lovely time. Shortly after we paid the bill a Japanese man in a suit came by to ask us how everything was and if it was our first time there. I proceeded to share with him how it was our first experience, of course wanting to give positive feedback. He didn't wait for my comments and very abruptly proceeded to tell us that we needed to vacate the table as he had another party to fill it with. We were stunned as we had wrapped up and were about to leave anyway.  Needless to say his unprofessional behavior soured the whole experience and ruined our night. We should have been given a heads up in a different way, which anyone with any kind of good manners would have known how to do so. Especially when there were many empty tables on a Saturday night at 9pm.  I feel bad for the people who work for this person as he was a poor reflection on them.",0,1,0,B C.,"Bellmore, NY",1,6,0

He quickly turned to ask us to leave soon as there were others waiting for the table. This was Saturday night at 9 pm and there were few empty tables and hardly a mad rush waiting. We spent close to $800 amongst 4 people to hear this.

NOW, let me explain why I'm doing one star. We had reservations and then they come over and tell us to hurry up because they had a group waiting.

1.0,5/13/2016,"I don't even know what the hype is all about. Don't get me wrong the The place and ambience and decor was beautiful and vibe was cool the service was not as bad as the reviews on here ,,,,when you walk in you have two bouncers in the front who open the door for you as you walk in you check-in with the hostess downstairs and they send you upstairs so you could wait for your table or for the rest of your party to arrive they have a cool bar . But beware the bartenders up there were a little snobby but they do make a mean drink I must say ,,anyways let me share my horrific experience so we went there for my girlfriend's birthday dinner !!reservations were for eight people our reservation was 8:30pm one of my girlfriends arrived at 8:18 and she checked in than me and one of my other girlfriends arrived at 8:36 and we check in and 3 others showed up at 8:50 and originally it was supposed to be 8 girls 2 girls canceled and they called  the restaurant ahead of time to change it too 6  because the reservation was under her name they had a family emergency so at 8:50 I approached the hostess upstairs at this point I said to him there is six girls the other two canceled is our table ready he said you need to go downstairs and re-check in and let them know about the change in the reservation so I went downstairs I spoke to the hostess downstairs and she told me that was fine just to go upstairs and they will let us know when our table is ready so we went right back to the bar we were drinking 9:50approaches I went back to the hostess I said is the table ready yet and he told me that somebody is sitting at the table that you're  supposed to get ... so I turned around and I said to him do you know how much longer will it be !!! He said give me a few minutes I'm doing my best to clear a table for your party at that point I said is there a manager I can speak to he said sure that even took over a hour unreal so now the hostess comes up to the bar and says your table is ready we got seated at 11 PM to eat and we got there at 8:30 and never in my life have I ever waited for a table that along with a reservation or without a reservation so I said to him this was unacceptable and that he should go talk to his manager and give us one round of the drinks on the house that's 6 drinks to accommodate us meanwhile we spent at the bar and easy $500 between six girls on drinks waiting to be seated to eat for 2.5 hours I was furious as we sat there over looking the menu the waiter was so sweet he saw that we were upset about how we were treated maybe that's why he was super nice to us we put our orders in as we were done ordering the manager rolls up to the table and say which one of you asked to see the manager or speak to a manager he walked over to the table with his panties in a bunch my gosh up tight are we !!!!!!!!!!!  I said I did. He said what seem to be the problem I said the problem is it's a 2 1/2 hours for me and my girlfriends to be seated to eat and all I asked for was the hostess to ask you to give us around the drinks on the house to accommodate us he walks away 10 minutes later he comes back with a pen and a notepad telling me that the reason we sat late is because everyone was late and that's your problem not like really dude you need to go reanalyze your life !

4.0,5/12/2016,"Great ambience, good food and super nice staff.  What I love most about this place is how surprisingly kid friend it is! Its hard to maintain a foodie status with a 19 month old but Zuma makes it easy.Food wise, we loved the Seared salmon app, beef tenderloin, alaskan crab robata. The tuna tataki and yellow tail were also good but my fav was def the salmon.  We also tried the spicy yellowtail roll and the freshness of their fish was consistent throughout.  The only miss was the tempura which I felt needed a bit more flavor and perhaps the dipping sauce could be a tad saltier.  Otherwise it was a great meal. Yes prices are high but consistent with this type of quality and ambience. I can't wait to go back and try some more of their inventive dishesThe restaurant reminds me of Nobu but in their heyday with more variety in flavors and options. For you parents out there - we had a 6:30pm Thursday night reservation (thats when you have to eat if you had a kid) and was running about 20 min late and they did not even blink an eye. The hostesses fawned over my child. I had to change him before we sat down and I was surprised to see a changing table in the bathroom! The hostess waited patiently outside for what was certainly way too long and she happily walked us to the table where they had a high chair ready. Then another hostess came by and asked if my son would like a coloring book with crayons!  I was blown away - what high end restaurant does this now?!  Kudos to you Zuma!  Service was quick (which is important with an impatient 19 month old) and everyone was super accommodative! I rarely have time to Yelp now but felt their service really deserved a shout out.",1,0,1,Kathy L.,"New York, NY",109,298,69

5.0,5/9/2016,"If I could give this place more than 5 stars I would. First I would like to address the 3 stars and less reviewers, many stated ""good atmosphere, good food. service etc etc"" then why give it 3 stars? Another reviewer gave the place 1 star and clearly stated the place was fantastic but he ran into a another difficult customer that the restaurant could not control. Well, did not know restaurant owners and servicers were the law force. Anyways, I hope these negative reviews that do not make sense do not deter you from coming to this magnificent restaurant. Anyways, lets begin with the atmosphere, the restaurant decor is delicately placed, that gives you a modern, Japanese, feel to it. The upstairs is much nicer than downstairs in my opinion so if you can get a seat upstairs, try for that. Perfect for dates, a night out with your friends. Moving on to food. We had the following off of the menu:Food:- yaki taraba gani: king crab with ponzu lime butter- kinoko no kama meshi: rice hotpot with wild mushrooms and japanese vegetables. - Pork belly and beef skewers - suzuki no ozashimi: seabass sashimi with yuzu, salmon roe and truffle oil- maguro no tataki: sliced seared tuna with chili daikon and ponzu sauce- a dish of sashimi with assorted fish- Watercress saladMy opinion about each dish. The king crab was a small entree, so if you are planning to get full off of it,do not plan on it. It is more of an appetizer. An amazing dish that is full of flavors and not too heavy. The rice hotpot, was to die for, a 50 dollar dish that might deter some people but I would suggest to definitely get it. A mix of flavors that you will not get elsewhere. The pork belly skewers literally melted in my mouth, beef and pork were both marinated beautifully. The seabass and sashimi. The salmon roe mixed with the sashimi, you would expect a really fishy, or sea taste to it but nope, just the exact opposite. The tataki was seared perfectly and the daikon and ponzo sauce together was the perfect sour, sweet taste in your mouth. The dish of sashimi with assorted fish. You knew that each of the fish was made fresh. My least favorite was the water cress salad, it had a really strong wasabi taste in each bite which made it difficult to eat. I can be biased though since I do not like wasabi. Drinks:Both non-alcoholic - dont remember the exact names but see my pictures for better reference. - Strawberry -Green Tea matcha, mint Both drinks were very refreshing but I preferred the strawberry drink more. light and refreshing as the green tea match was a bit more sour. Lastly, there was the dessert. Assorted rare asian fruits with a bit of your regular fruits. A yellow, mango dessert which had a mix of sour and sweet was perfect for me. I thoroughly enjoyed the lava cake with the vanilla ice cream was perfect. The sorbet was the perfect sweetness. It was the perfect night.",7,0,4,Caryn C.,"Lindenhurst, NY",968,275,110
5.0,5/2/2016,"First of this place is pricy, but food is delusions, if  you don't plan on spending a lot don't come hungry here, the portions are small some are smaller then others especially the appetizers, so with that said and from reading reviews we decided to go with pre-fix menu option for $98 a person, with pre-fix menu you get a lot of food and you get to taste different dishes.",1,0,1,Kate S.,"Brooklyn, NY",404,33,128
5.0,5/1/2016,"Zuma is a great place to come with friends, bring clients or even just grab a few drinks at the bar after work. They have awesome modern design when you walk in. High ceiling, stone wall mixed with dark brown wood (mahogany?) dim lightning. Atmosphere is quite loud, but that's how you know this place is poppin' haha. I had a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon 2012 red wine and also the Sojen cocktail. The Sojen cocktail has vodka, matcha powder, coconut syrup and tastes sweet but has a nice small kick. If you love matcha like I do, go ahead and try that. As for food, my party couldn't decide on what to get. I saw some items that really caught my eye at first like the Wagyu beef 6oz steak, the pork belly, chilean sea bass... so our server recommended we try their tasting menu with their top items chosen by their chefs. We were pretty reluctant at first because of the prices, but we ended up deciding to splurge because why not. We ended up going with the premium tasting menu and without disclosing what was in there I was definitely say it was well worth it. Many of the items that had caught my eye on the menu were already included in the tasting menu. I will say that the Wagyu beef was exceptional, it was cooked to the chef's recommendation and it was quite rare and chewy, but very tasty. The pork belly was also another item that was very memorable, it tasted amazing! Many many amazing dishes later we were presented with the most beautiful dessert platter I have ever eaten. I'm not even joking. This thing had ice cream in the center with vanilla, mango, strawberry flavors. Spongy banana bread on one side, a sweet chocolate brownie on another, turn it around again and you have cheesecake with strawberry drizzled syrup, assorted fruits around it including lychee,watermelon, blackberry, grape, strawberry, pineapple, dragon fruit (what!), melon, kiwi, blueberry, and creme brulee.

There are no real personal touches. This is a successful chain of upscale Japanese brasseries in every city where you expect to find a Zuma. My preference is for restaurants with more warmth and individual character, however I have to admit, the NYC Zuma is a well oiled machine that hums along smoothly from the decor to the service mostly to the food especially.The food was all excellent:Rock Shrimp tempora - Super crispy batter and shrimp with real flavor. the sauce was delicious if unnecessarySpicy Beef Tenderloin - Perfect medium rare chunks of tender meat. Not very spicy but nuanced flavor from the sesame and the sauce.Skirt Steak - yes, we doubled down on the steak. Also tender and perfectly cooked.Rice Hot Pot - The best of the dishes we ordered.

4.0,4/3/2016,"Zuma is one of the few spots in midtown that is suitable for drinks with the girls, taking clients or a quick lunch. The food is good and the bar is always popping. I've been here multiple times and always return. Pros - the food, cocktails and decor are definitely the star of the restaurant. Some standouts include:1) miso cod - Even though this dish was made famous by nobu, I think Zuma does it better than anywhere else in nyc. The cod is always super flaky and flavored perfectly.2) fried tofu - Even though this is such a simple preparation, but is served perfectly nice and crispy on the outside, while remaining nice and soft inside. The dressing is also the perfect complement. 3) sushi, rolls and raw fish - The raw fish dishes all have nice flavors and fairly fresh fish. I like the salmon tataki and the uni sushi.4) cheesecake - I love how the cheesecake is nice and light with some bright flavor accents. Cons1) small portions/value - It's a bit hard to get full on the food. I think the food is definitely a bit overpriced. I would suggest going with lighter eaters for dinner. The one raw fish dish I do not recommend is the toro scallion roll, as it is tiny! However, for lunch, they do offer a lunch menu that's a great deal.2) service - The service is very inconsistent. I have had wonderful, amazing servers and awful, forgetful ones. My most recent server was incredibly attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. The time before, it was clear that the server forgot to put in the order for miso cod. We had to ask for it twice and then could not find her, so we had to speak to another server. There was not any apology or acknowledgment of how long it took. I would definitely return to Zuma.

I didn't expect something like this to be here but to my surprise, this place does very well. The restaurant is very spacious with two floors. It's a very chic location which reminds me of Tao but the food is a lot better. The Beef tataki was on point with a kick of truffle. The Soft shell crab had the perfect crisp to it with the wasabi mayo sauce. (hate soggy soft shell crab). The Black Cod was delicious and may be even better than Megu which usually has me drooling when thinking about it. The service was OK. We had a fairly large group and the host placed us in a small lounge like seating upstairs. We were cramped and asked for a chair to be added at the end of the table but they 'ran out of chairs'. Ten Minutes later, another waiter pulled out a chair for the table behind us..

At the end of the meal we could not decide what all our favorite were since they were all delicious! Ones that stood out was the mushroom rice, beef tataki , black cod, jumbo prawn. The venue was beautiful and large. The downstairs looks more of a formal restaurant setting whereas upstairs was more of a lounge. The reason I didn't give this place 5 stars was because how they sat my party of 9. They had three large sofa seats on one side while 5 people were squished on the booth side. When we asked if they would provide us another seat to use at the end of the table, they said that they were all being used. When looking around our section, there were a few tables of 2-3 people with 4 seats.

5.0,3/6/2016,"Zuma NYC is probably our favorite restaurant in New York... Food is always delicious. We love sake and they have one of the best sake selections of anywhere we've ever been. Menu is big enough to consistently go back and get something different every time. We usually start with some sushi, rolls and hand rolls and then a lot of small share plates.Some of our favorites are the Alaskan King crab legs, the yellowtail scallion hand rolls, can't go wrong with the black cod or the scallops.Desert if great too.Bottom line: everything is great.

Came in about an hour before closing but the host and wait staff didn't miss a beat. Ordered the miso soup which was great and a crab roll and tuna roll which were fantastic. Also ordered the signature Zuma chocolate cake, which was nice. Had a friend invite herself when she found out via social media that I was at Zuma. Texted me she was going to join.

They did not even accommodate us in any way for the inconvenience.  Definitely not worth going back.  There are way better high end sushi restaurants in this city.,0,3,0,T W.,"New York, NY",0,12,0
5.0,2/10/2016,"New York restaurant critics - no doubt chagrined by Zuma's belated opening in New York after successful outposts in Dubai, Miami, Istanbul and Hong Kong after the original London location - weren't kind to the brand when it came to the city. Why should NYC be last on the list, why such an afterthought? After all, the super-rich haven't stopped parking their money here. It might be easier to ignore such relics of the early-naughties, themselves far too close to the eighties' slick and flashy izakaya abominations; for Zuma is definitely big and brash and pricey. I visited the Knightsbridge location in 2004 and again in 2014, but lunch in this midtown location on a hot summer's day will be most memorable for the lamb chops, thick cut and marinated in miso, then seared over the robata grill until dark and sticky outside, and pink inside. Their version of a Chawan Mushi, remixed for dessert but less egg custard and more fruity-foam, was unbeatable. The $25 restaurant week lunch deal was in effect, and made it so much more accessible, but prices hover around the $21-23 mark for most dishes, which for such splendid fusion Japanese fare is really rather reasonable.

4.0,2/4/2016,"Went to Zuma on Tuesday night for a friends birthday and it was excellent! I loved the vibe of the restaurant as soon as I walked in and the decor was beautiful. The downstairs had an older/more relaxed feel and upstairs was a more happening bar area/lounge.We went upstairs for a drink first and then tried to get seated in the lounge area. We had a reservation, but it apparently was for downstairs and all of the lounge area was already reserved. We decided to sit in the bar area at a table and it ended up being fine/better off that we sat upstairs. My friend and I decided to share a bunch of different dishes. Our waitress had let us know that's usually how most people order at Zuma and it just comes out whenever it is ready. There isn't a way to request a certain dish to come first. We first had an order of edamame for the table and then ordered to share: -Ebi no tempura: AKA Rock Shimp Tempura was one of my favorite things we shared. I loved how the spicy mayo sauce came on the side as a dipping sauce. Most places I've been actually has the sauce already on the shrimp, but I liked having the option. -Gindara to ebi no gyoza: Shrimp and cod dumplings were EXCELLENT! I think the best thing we had. So delicious. -Gyu to shishito no kushi yaki: Beef skewers were really tasty! Cooked perfectly, but the peppers were a little bit too spicy for me. -Pirikara maguro maki: this spicy tuna roll was just OK. I thought everything else we ordered was significantly better. -Kinoko no kama meshi: this is a rice hotpot similar to risotto with mushrooms. My friends mom had this and we just tasted some, but it was AMAZING. Good to know for next time. -Zuma Special Chocolate: This chocolate cake is really the reason why we came to zuma and it didn't fail our expectations. The best thing we had a Zuma and I would come back just for the cake. Overall had a great experience at Zuma.

3.0,2/3/2016,"Went to the Zuma in Miami and loved it. Had to try the NY location one day. I went for lunch for restaurant week. Everything was mediocre, ESPECIALLY THE ONE THING I LOVED THE MOST FROM THERE (their rice hotpot with mushroom and jap veggies and truffle!). I started with their salad (comes with the pre-fixe). It was good.  No complaints. Off to the appetizers. I tried the seared tuna with chili daikon. It was decent. Nothing too memorable. Moving on to the entrees. Had the chirashi sashimi don and tried the beef tenderloin with sesame red chili. I enjoyed the beef tenderloin more than the chirashi sashimi don. The beef was cooked nicely and the flavors weren't that overpowering. So the most important thing in this visit was the rice hotpot. Although I saw the person put in truffle, the truffle was not present to my nose or palate. It was not as flavorful as I remembered and dreamed about. Tasted like soupy bibimbap here. Finished the meal with their yuzu key lime pie. Nothing too heavy but nothing I wanted to waste my calories on.

Instead, we are left staring at four different menus and waiting a full ten minutes before anyone comes and asks us for our water preference. We manage to flag down a ... waiter? manager? not really sure as there seems to be so many different roles. We tell this nicely dressed person that our table is extremely wobbly and we would like to order - he is nice but tells us that he will find someone to fix our table then take our order.

4.0,1/22/2016,"When I was in HK over the summer, I really wanted to try Zuma. But with time constraints, I missed out so I was so happy to see that there was a location in the city! My party of two booked a table for 12:15pm on a Friday for lunch. We were brought to the second floor dining room, which is a lot more quite than the main floor. The decor is modern and just so stunning. It is comparable to the high end Asian restaurants such as Hakkasan, Buddakhan, and Megu. There were only two tables when we sat down, but after a half hour the lunch rush began. There is also a large bar and a lounge area on the second floor in addition to the dining tables. The seating was a bit close because we could hear the conversations of the two parties next to us. But I guess space is valuable in Midtown! We both participated in the Restaurant Week menu. Salad: There's a nice Asian twist added with a fried lotus root.Miso Soup: Standard. Unbearably salty. There is no way you can finish this small cup without downing two glasses of water. Appetizer: - Chicken yakitori: The chicken was moist and seasoned well, but I thought it was missing a kick. - Seared salmon shiso: My immediate reaction was that the portion was tiny. It was like a scrap sliver of fish. But the taste was good and fish was fresh. I just wish I could have had a larger portion to taste the fish better.Main:- Chirashi don: The absolute best part of the meal! The tuna, salmon and yellow tail were so fresh! The portion was small but enough with the set menu. This is a must try!- Seared beef: Tiny. Not memorable. Dessert:- Yuzu cheesecake: The cheesecake had a slight yuzu flavor which was too overbearing. It tasted fresh and wasn't too heavy. I would come here again just for this! - Chawan mushi (passion fruit custard with mango): There are three layers to this custard like dessert with mango slices throughout. Light and fresh tasting.

But, Zuma was my girls' lunch spot in Dubai and hey it is restaurant week, filled with nostalgia off I went. A table for 2 please. $25 each. The food was amazing the service was exceptional. Allow me to elaborate: We ordered from the set menu for RW, which was a relief because going through their menu on an empty stomach ...well anyway we got chicken skewers and seared salmon with shiso for a start both were ok good. Table next door ordered the chefs maki roll, I wish we did that too! Mains were chirashi don which was so fresh and really omg yum pieces of fish over rice; and the spicy beef tenderloin that melts in your mouth before you could say arigato. The worst part about the beef was the size, I suggest ordering a side of rice with that. All mains came with a generous salad and miso. Zuma's miso is really one of the best. Chawan mushi and yuzu cheesecake for dessert. Chawan mushi is a MUST, we looked every inch of indignity fighting for the last mouthful. It was unbelievable, I don't even know how to describe this, but if heaven was a panna cotta...you know what I mean. The fact that we were there part of RW didn't change how amazing the staff were, not just to us but to the guy who came 5 minutes before the kitchen closes to get his RW fix Zuma I salute you and will definitely be back.",1,1,1,Nora B.,"Financial District, San Francisco, CA",10,65,34

However, I'm not sure it's the type of place I would go back a second or third time. The waiter told us it would be best if we went with the pre-set menu but since that didn't include some of the special things we wanted like the beef tataki with truffles, we ordered normally. The waiter told us how many dishes we needed. We ordered just about that much, maybe a bit less and it ended up being wayyy to much food (and believe me when I say I eat a lot). Other then the fact that it's seriously expensive, it's a great place to go because of the beautiful ambience and really good food.

I expected more for $50 a pop. The food tasted great. The maki rolls were delicious, as was the shrimp appetizer and a little less so the chicken skewers. The chocolate lava cake with ice cream is delicious though. The place felt just alright. The decor and service is great.

I did come for a private party, so I did not PAY for this meal, so I can't comment on the value although I suspect that it costs a pretty penny. Another issue that allowed me to downgrade this place to 4 stars was the service. Things came out at odd times because they were backed up. We had about 10 courses, and we waited for 30 minutes between course 3 and 4! That's a really long time without any explanation until someone asked. They also didn't space out the dishes in an even way on the table so it required people glancing anxiously at the dishes that were quickly disappearing. 1. Tomato and eggplant salad with ginger and scallion dressing: An absolutely simple but delicious mix of fresh large-leaf greens with seasoned organic tomatoes. Loved it. 2. Prawn and black cod dumplings: One of my favorites of the evening. I didn't know what was in here initially, but really could taste the prawns, which was uniquely flavored.3. Spicy fried squid with green chili and lime: This was not that good. Pretty standard calamari, a little overcooked and over-fried.4. Salmon slice rolled: I think this was what it is. Very very fresh and good with the sauces and seasoning.5. Tuna sushi: Also very fresh and good. Nothing special though.6. Rock shrimp tempura: Small but well-fried.7. Assorted veggies tempura: Loved this. In some ways the diversity in veggies make it an interesting assortment of textures.8. Spicy lobster miso soup: I thought it was just really really good miso soup with a distinct seafood flavor. But now I know that it has lobster (flavor) in it. Nice!9. Sweet potatoes: Baked and with drizzled ponzu sauce, slightly fried, this is another one of my favorite dishes of the night. Keeping the skin on the potato made a huge different.10. Barley miso corn fed chicken oven roasted on cedar wood: This is very interesting! The chicken is juicy, but there was something else on the outside that I can't quite place that made it unique. Hard to describe.11. Rice hotpot with wild mushrooms and Japanese vegetables: So good!! They make it in front of the table, then distribute the rice in small bowls. The mushroom flavor permeates the dish. Really great.12. Dessert tray: This had a peach pudding, tiramisu, cheesecake, sorbets, crème brulee, and chocolate molten cake. It's not even on the menu that I can see, but this was the highlight. It's a beautiful display (see photos). Everything was amazing, especially the peach pudding, tiramisu, and chocolate cake.

You walk through majestic wooden doors to enter and you're immediately greeted by several people at the coat check. They direct you up the stairs to get seated by the hostess and there's a DJ spinning music at the corner. (Why anyone would need an actual DJ spinning tunes at a restaurant is completely beyond me.)My friends and I got there right on time for our 8pm reservation and were told that our table was not ready. They directed us to the bar which was packed so we ended up standing awkwardly in the middle of an active walkway where waiters and waitresses were walking by with food. After 15 minutes, they eventually seated us right beside the DJ and a loud speaker. This made it very hard for us to hear each other speak as the decibel level of the music was bordering on deafening.I was honestly expecting to be blown away by the experience. Sadly, I don't think any of it justified the exorbitant prices of the food. Severely overpriced for the small portions (I know it's tapas style, but c'mon!), although the quality of some dishes was pretty good. Our waitress recommended that each of us order at least 3 dishes each as portions were small. As I was with a party of 4, we ended up getting around 12-13 items to share. Overall, our group had mixed feelings about the food. We came to a general consensus that the fish dishes were a lot better than the meats. For example, the fish dishes were fresh and flavorful, but the meats we ordered were tough and average. At the end of the dinner and after having spent an embarrassing amount of money, we left the restaurant still hungry. The bottom line: Unsatisfying and not worth the price..

The food was unexpectedly good. The sushi was comparable in quality and price to some pure-play sushi restaurants that are respected for both qualities. And the robata and Japanese-inspired was also good. The wine list contained some decent wines at decent prices. And the service was friendly and efficient. In short, I was open to returning to Zuma. A trip to Miami and a visit to Coya, which I understand is owned by the same group, and where we had a great meal, convinced me. And it was a good experience, food, wine and service wise. The lamb chops and the corn in particular shone. The service was efficient, if not particularly friendly, and price wise, our meal was quite competitive with second tier restaurants in NY. So I talked the restaurant up to friends. I told people to ignore the tourist trap decor and logo victim clientele and focus on the food quality and (relative) value proposition. Unfortunately, my last visit highlighted all the restaurant's weaknesses. When we got there, right on time for our reservation, we were told our wait could be 15-20 mins. As we live a block away, we decided to go back home and asked the lady at the reception to call us when they were ready for us. We were finally seated more than a half hour late. Our waitress was slow in coming. The food was good, but the service was seriously wanting. After making us wait for our table, we were peremptorily told the kitchen would close shortly, and should order quickly. And when the bill arrived, we had been charged twice for beverages, because ""the original order had been dropped before they could bring it to us, so the bar had to ring it up twice"" and the duplicate order hadn't been removed.In the end, the food at Zuma is good enough to cause me to give it 2 stars, rather than 1. But its shortcomings on service and attitude are very real. Zuma is competing with restaurants that deliver world class food and service. It's just not good enough for the big time.",0,0,0,Preethi U.,"New York, NY",0,4,0

The food is pretty good, but I would rather go to a trusted neighborhood sushi spot and be treated nicely, then spend money in a place that doesn't know how to accommodate customers.A friend and I went early to celebrate her promotion. We had a reservation for 3, but our one friend would not make it for the 6pm reservation, we figured we would be done by 730 and meet him upstairs. We were the very first in the row of two top tables, which were flanked, by three top table. We asked if we could have a different table with a little more room in case our friend arrived earlier, they insisted that they had reservations for all and that it gets ""too busy"" they would not be able to sit us unless the full party was there.  OK, OK, this is such a NY thing - I've heard this before - but let me emphasize that we were the 1st and there was a three seater right next to us AND at the end of the row of seats we were sitting in. An hour later they sit two women at the three top, OH and you guessed it, two people at the three top on the other side. Our friend showed up, was treated rudely, and when we asked our waiter if we could squeeze him in, he said he would have to ask a manager. The manager NEVER came over - our friend ended up leaving. Meanwhile about 5 minutes later, one of the managers did go over to the table next to us to talk to the two women at the three top and fawned over them, gave them his card.

2.0,11/10/2015,"I went there in August and had the Premium Tasting menu. It was excellent. No complaints. Based on this, I made a reservation with a colleague in early November. From the second I walked in, the experience was awful. I was a tad early so (like last time) I went to the ground level bar area near the entrance to grab a pre-dinner drink while I waited. The bar area was completely packed as opposed to the last time, when there were two seats perfectly awaiting us. This time it was three deep at the bar and no bar tender ever even lifted his head to look for anybody wanting to order a beverage. Eventually, I saw my companion and gave up on the drink. I wanted to sit downstairs in the main dining room, where it is a little more relaxed, not quite as LOUD and the tables are standard as opposed to high tops (which I typically hate). Of course we were immediately told to head upstairs to see a second hostess who sat us upstairs crammed between two other high top bistro tables in a loud corner near the DJ. Crappy table. Last time we were seated downstairs by the window and got a great server. Again, no luck this time. We opted to only get the ""classic tasting menu"" this time as I was not as hungry so I figured it would be great items, only fewer of them. I was wrong. The items that arrived at the table were all the starchy, inexpensive items such as the large and ridiculously spicy salad to share or the baked sweet potato slices with a little teriyaki sauce drizzled on top or the risotto with mushrooms which was totally average and under-seasoned. The best thing that arrived was the hoisin glazed chicken and by the time it got to the table I was almost throwing-up in my own mouth I was so full of starchy, carby, fillers. Don't expect anything to be reasonably priced here - and that's okay - after all, its Manhattan, its a huge space, the décor is really gorgeous and its a place to be seen and have fun. But they should turn the music down a hair to make it just below ""night club"" volume and the servers should be a little more informative with the guests to ensure they order the right things based on the appetite and taste.

Waiters were actually super nice, including the manager who came over and was incredibly charming. They were very passionate about explaining every dish, which I thought was cool but unnecessary. But fun? Went with one girlfriend and we were seated upstairs at the lounge.

The mushroom tastes like asian zhongzhe (sticky rice?) which is a personal favorite of mine. They're both mild enough for non-Asians to be able to accept, as well. The special rolls weren't awesome, though - what was most disappointing with their truffle one and uni: it just didn't taste fresh, unfortunately. Drinks: RUBABU was recommended and AMAAAZING. I love passion fruit, and for some reason never realized there were passion fruit cocktails?? My friend told me that it made the alcohol on my breath smell lovely, so...Pretty potent, as well.Their bathroom is to die for, though.

Decor is consistent with the high ceilings, dark lighting and unique silverware with Asian flair. We all received a miso soup to start. I ordered the chef's maki roll and the salmon tartare for my two appetizers - pretty similar to what I had at Miami Spice. They were tasty and small portioned, as I had come to expect. The only issue was how long the entrees took to come out - we expected a business lunch to have the timing of one.

4.0,10/13/2015,"Was nervous to come here given the horrible service reviews.We arrived a few minutes before our reservation time (Sunday night of a holiday weekend), hostess told us our table wasn't quite ready yet, so we were directed to the bar. Couldn't get the attention of the bartender to even get a drink menu despite bar being COMPLETELY EMPTY --not a patron except us two ladies, but no matter because someone came over to take us to our table before we could be fully annoyed by the lack of service at the bar.It was a crowded and packed restaurant for a Sunday night, especially given this place's rather odd location near Grand Central. The banquette was covered in menus and other people's bags, but it may have been the fault of the couple next to us, not the result of inattentive staff. We had an omakase voucher from Gilt City (no savings at all -- you pay the full price of the meal), they took that, and we didn't have to order! Not sure which level of omakase they were giving us; their menu shows three levels availble. We would also be getting two glasses of sake to pair with our meal. The first glass came out right away, so we didn't even have a chance to order cocktails. Our first dish came out at the same time (a sashimi with garlic) and we were happy to start eating because we were starving. Apparently, we finished our first glasses of sake quite quickly because the bemused server brought us our second glasses a little sooner than the courses they were paired with, just so we wouldn't need to go without. Both sakes were solid. The food kept coming at a lightening pace and the food here is quite good! Solid quality and fabulous flavors. Here's what we got:*Sashimi with picked garlic -- strongly flavored and yummy.*The seaweed crackers that accompanied the tar tar was perfection. Tartar tasted fresh. Ours was tuna only, no salmon.*Edamame was oversalted, but you could remove the salt. Beans were otherwise perfect.*Dumplings were not made available to us; we got sort of a rock shrimp tempura which was pretty good. The dipping sauce as fabulous.*Maki was alright and the sushi/sashimi were fine. Nothing special but did not lack for freshness. Overall, didn't disappoint.*Salad was DELICIOUS, but so large. By then, I was getting full, though I still managed to drink down the miso soup (fine, nothing special) that followed.*THEN, the rice hot pot with mushrooms and veggies arrived and it was SO SO SO GOOD! I wish I'd had (a) more room in my belly; they would not pack us the leftovers to take homeOR (b) not eaten the edamame or soup or salad because I would have preferred the rice hot pot instead! They had told us this was the last dish when they set it on the table, which I found a little confusing since the Gilt menu also listed a rib eye steak and Japanese sweet potato as the final entree course before dessert. Felt a little shortchanged, but it really didn't matter because I was STUFFED. Truly stuffed. Hmm, maybe two bottles of sparkling water will do that to you. LOL*And then came the desserts which we had to sample and they were fabulous. Both a huge thumbs up. A little heavy for Japanese cuisine, but excellently executed.The only hiccup, if you will call it that, was that towards the end of the meal, our service really tapered off. It had been quick and attentive (though I did have to ask for lime for my sparkling water more than once), but once we got to the rice box, everyone disappeared. Basically, the everything up to the rice hot pot took about an hour. Then it was about 40 min for the dessert and check. Dessert took quite a while to come out (didn't matter -- we were full), but then it took a long time before they cleared the desserts. Then it took forever to find someone who would give us our check. When we got it, the check was wrong; they never deducted the $200 we'd already paid via the voucher. We handed the bill back to them, with a CC, and mentioned that the voucher needed to be deducted. They promised to be right back. The manager came back to us a while later with a corrected bill but no CC. ??He spat out at us, ""I took care of it."" and walked away. Okay, but where's the CC and/or the receipt to sign? We finally got it, signed what needed to be signed, and headed out. I was happy with our servers but the snotty manager at the end of the meal turned me off, for sure. Still, we left a good tip because our servers had been solid.A little to scene-y here to be taken seriously by foodies, but the food was strong enough to stand up to scene-y-ness. I would not buy the Gilt voucher again, though I would come back. I'd pay out of pocket to try the omakase; I'd also get cocktails, which sounded interesting. Hopefully, they are mixed as well as their dishes are prepared!I would choose Zuma if it were less food-focused night and more of a party&drinks night, where we wanted decent food on top of a lively spot.

I had tried a gin based drink another time, with a minty sweetness to it (I should really remember my drinks or maybe the drinks are affecting my memory).Moving on... The food was spectacular!First time I came, we came with a big party so we had this HUGE platter of sashimi which probably should have been the highlight of our meal, but continuously brought out food that left me speechless... literally didn't talk the whole night because I was too busy eating.The second time I was here, I tried this amazing salad with these tomatoes (I keep forgetting the names of the food and drinks!) and I have to say, this was the best dish I had that night. I thought I'd never say a salad was the highlight dish of the night, but this night it was and the party I was with agreed as well. I wish I had remembered the name of it so I could recommend it to others.The desserts were amazing too. To satisfy your whole experience here, you have to top it off with their desserts. They put an equal amount of focus on all aspects of their food, that their desserts are just as good as their entrees and sashimi. All in all, the food & drinks were spectacular, the service was extraordinary, and the atmosphere was great!Shout out to the chefs, cooks, the servers and the managers for the great experience.",2,1,0,Kyongil L.,"New York, NY",785,52,40

The waiter checked and he said it would be out soon. After waiting some more, We had the manager check on it and he said the chef felt it ""wasn't up to standards so they were making a new one"" aka they forgot about it.

The Cappuccino was made just the way I liked it. Not too foamy and not too light. The entree, Chirashi Don (Fish) was my favourite.   You can taste the freshness of the salmon, the tenderness of the tuna and the lightness of the sushi rice. Resolutely,the interior decor of Zuma New York is stunning as well. A feast for the eyes, everything about the restaurant is designed in detail in order to reflect the warm atmosphere and the 5 natural elements. Not to mention, the pillars incorporates the industrial feel to the restaurant - just like New York City. I was seated in the main dining area on the 1st level. Service was quick and efficient. Floor managers were very warm in greeting customers too. Everyone makes you feel special.

But the freshness of the sashimi was really what got me to love this place. The only reason i didn't give five stars was because there were apparently too many food runners/servers that they brought out our three out of four appetizers first, and then my girlfriends entree which got cold while i waited for my entree. At that point we said we didn't receive our fourth app, which was then brought out shortly after. One server asked if we were ready for our entree round now (which we already ate), and another server followed shortly after with whether or not we enjoyed our dessert (which we didn't receive yet).I would come back for drinks and appetizers, but not sure about a full course meal unless you have the time.",0,0,0,Milan P.,"New York, NY",24,36,68

3.0,8/14/2015,"I was super excited when I found out that Zuma opened up a branch in NY as I loved the one in London.  Zuma was actually my favorite sushi place in London when I did a brief stint there for work.  I was doubly excited after I found out that it was still restaurant week and the menu looked incredible.  However (spoiler alert), I walked away disappointed and slightly hungry.  Please note that the review below is purely for the ""restaurant week dinner menu"", which we had to ask for, as it was not included in the stack of menus the hostess left when she seated us.  For the appetizer, I picked ""Chef Selection of Sashimi"" and ""Beef Tataki"".  Each dish had three pieces, the sashimi included tuna, salmon and I think yellow tail.  It was ok, not the best pieces of sashimi I had this week (see my reviews for DomoDomo).  The beef tataki was interesting, each of the three pieces of beef wrapped a piece of daikon, which provided it a nice crunchy texture.For the entree, I picked ""Grilled Chilean Seabass"", which was overcooked, as such, the piece of seabass was a bit tough, moreover it was flavorless.  We were still hungry after the appetizers and entree, so we ordered a few rolls and popcorn tempura for the table.  The rolls were good, but nothing to write home about.  While the popcorn tempura was an interesting idea, I was not crazy about the execution.  You basically get a piece of corn with a small bit of batter in each bite, it wasn't very satisfying, maybe a cluster of corn would've been better?I ordered the ""Chawan Mushi"" for dessert, but I also tried my friend's cheesecake.  I really like the chawan mushi, it was custard-y with a passion fruit flavored foam and pieces of fruits on top.  I am not quite sure about the ""exotic fruit"" part as described in the menu, it did come with a single gooseberry, which I guess could be categorized as ""exotic"".  Regardless, the dessert was my favorite course.   The drinks were delicious, which along with the desserts, were the highlights of our dinner.  I think I would come back again to try the rest of the menu, as the restaurant week menu was pretty mediocre.",0,0,0,Kat J.,"Jersey City, NJ",137,196,1246
4.0,8/12/2015,"Zuma is a beautiful restaurant and on the pricey side of things. Most of the food isn't 100% justified for the price - and if that's what you are looking for, this is probably not the place for you. If you're just looking for an aesthetically gorgeous place to dine with posh ambiance - come here.The food and drinks were good - the service was spotty and I think it's really because of the high volume due to restaurant week (waitress was friendly but came only to check maybe once and the drinks took too long - I received two apps before my first drink). The salmon tartare with rice crackers were so satisfying - the salmon was very fatty making the tartare's consistency luscious. Scallop skewers were fine too but nothing to really rave about. The sea bass was good - nothing extraordinary but done well as expected from this restaurant. The sushi rolls were divine but pricey as you can get the same quality in any high end sushi restaurant for less. We ordered the Uni sushi (yummmm), tuna sushi, spicy tuna maki roll (thought they went heavy handed on the wasabi in the roll), and salmon roll (asparagus in the roll was a bitter touch - probably would be better if they used baby asparagus), California roll with Alaskan crab (the name of the roll doesn't do it justice - crab was sweet and plentiful), and the waygu beef roll with truffle (2 very tiny pieces for $24 - not worth it and don't get it).

FOOD: again bare in mind this was the Restaurant week menu: started with Rock shrimp and Cod Gyoza, which was some of the best Ive had in a long time. Followed by salmon tartare which honestly was underwhelming, mushy and nothing stood out about it. , also amazing. Entrees were a Miso Glazed chicken grilled over wood chips which was a small portion but really flavorful,  along with a black cod which didnt have a miso glaze but something more along the lines of a soy situation, either way it was fantastic. Again i try not to judge a place based on a restaurant week experience because you'll often go back during regular hours and it will be a slightly to very different vibe and situation.  I'll more than likely stop in here again, maybe a little later and not so close to the ""after work"" crowd.",0,0,0,Nik C.,"New York, NY",313,46,1

For restaurant week you get 2 small plates, 1 entree and a dessert each. We got the beef tatami, grilled scallops, yellowtail sashimi and nigiri to start. For the mains we had the sea bass and wagyu skirt steak. All of the food was very good, but the portion sizes were extremely small. Had I been starving going in I would have probably left hungry. With 1 cocktail each the bill came in at $111 not including tip. I would have given them 3 stars based on the fact that while food was tasty the portions were just tiny - however I jumped it up to 4 because we had good service. When I made the reservation on open table I indicated it was my friend's birthday. They acknowledged this and put a candle in her dessert. I have done this at other restaurants and it has been ignored so they got kudos for this. The restaurant is huge and nice a nice buzz to it.

First off the place is huge!  It's two floors and it seemed like they had a few private rooms also.  I really liked the decor too, it just felt like a cool place to be.  We were a group of 7, and seated upstairs in a little private section off the bar.  It was cool, we were overlooking downstairs.  It was a bit noisy and our table was huge, so it made it a little difficult at times to have a conversation with the whole table, but it was good spot.  The restaurant week menu was pretty good.  You got to choose two small appetizer dishes, one main and a dessert.  I went with the rock shrimp tempura and yellowtail sashimi for my first two dishes.  The yellowtail was really good, very fresh.  It was three small pieces, so it was nice we had two appetizers.  The rock shrimp was good too, but Nobu has spoiled all other rock shrimp tempura for me, and nowhere else is as good as them.. at least that's what I think :)  For my main I got the chillian seabass, which was so good.  It was cooked perfectly!  There were two options for dessert, a green tea and banana cake - which I hate both green tea and banana - so I had to skip that.  I went with the chawan mushi.  I had no idea what that was, but it turned out to be pretty good.  It was sort of a custard like dish with fruit, and I ate the whole thing.   Also the cocktails here were very good! I usually stick to wine, but the cocktails all sounded really good.  They're on the expensive side, but usually cocktails in NYC are expensive.. but these were very good, so I'd make the splurge.  I had a raspberry and passion fruit martini.  It was sweet, and didn't taste too strong, but I definitely felt it.  Then I also had a Zuma mai tai, which was very good as well. Very pretty.   Overall I really liked this place.  The food and drinks were good, and I liked the feel of the restaurant itself. It's prob not someplace I would typically go, but I really would like to go back.  The only thing that wasn't great, was like how others have said the food comes out when it's ready.  So all of our appetizers came out separately, but two of the people in our party had ordered the dumplings as one of their appetizers, and they finally came out when we all had finished our mains.  I feel like they must of somehow been forgetten about, since we had asked a few times about them, and were told they come out when they're ready, but that seemed really long.   A manager came over and apologized, so that was appreciated.  That was really my only complaint.  Like I said, I would like to back there.",1,0,0,Rachel W.,"Manhattan, NY",284,202,541

Thankfully a member of our party thought they had a restaurant week menu and asked for one. We ordered off the restaurant week menu because, why wouldn't you when they have all of your favorites on there for a fraction of the price? Anyway, I ordered two yummy appetizers and the steak for my entree. Ordered it medium rare, and it comes out practically pink. After the rest of my party that ordered steak devoured their dishes, I was still chewing on my second piece 20 minutes later. So I asked for the waiter and said my steak is rare. He said he would bring me out a new order and that the chef agreed with me that it was too rare. 22 mins later no steak. So we complained to the manager who used every excuse in the book before apologizing for the mistake. She said ""well it's restaurant week so we're busy."" Another one was ""well items on our menu come out at different times."" Finally she offered to take an appetizer off our bill. Everyone else liked their food and I liked the apps, but for the price and given that we've been to the Miami and Dubai location, I expected more.

Getting to the point checked in, friend not arrived, and I asked for four top booth- said she is saving it, but she will get us a ""nice table"" We end up sitting at the sushi bar and two women that look like a disheveled mess sit in the booth. Really???You put ME at the sushi bar when we were there first with a partially empty restaurant? Food- miso soup- just take salt and place it in your palm and it's exactly the same. I probably drank a gallon of water today and I still taste salt from eating half. Sashimi tuna- some nasty brown looked like it had been sitting out all day. And edamame was undercooked- how do you mess that up??? Or probably we ended up with the leftover stuff...never acceptable with someone who is practically a restaurant analyst and critic. However, I had not intention on complaining in front of my friend and they probably wouldn't care anyway as I don't look like their ""regular customer."" On a positive note specialty salmon roll excellent and staff very attentive with water and clearing leftover edamame after you eat it- good job. I would order the first page specialty items and steer clear of appetizers. The food coming out did look excellent- can't deny it.

1.0,7/28/2015,"**Restaurant week review**I get that the restaurant week menu portions are obviously small but c'mon.Appetizers: rock shrimp with lime and chili tofu (3 TINY pieces)yellowtail sashimi with green chili relish, ponzu and pickledgarlic (3 TINY pieces) salmon tartar (3 TINY Pieces) prawn and black cod dumplings (3 Decent pieces) Mains:Grilled chilean seabass with green chilli ginger dressing (Decent Portion) rib eye steak with wafu sauce and garlic chips* (TINY) Desserts: green tea and banana cake (Decent) chawan mushi (TINY) The appetizers weren't all that great, (nothing you can't get at a mediocre sushi spot)... with the exception of the ""Prawn & Black cod dumplings which were DELICIOUS! The Grilled sea bass entree was one of the best I've tried. The rib eye on the other hand was smaller than a Mcdonalds burger. -_- The desserts were okay. We were given the most horrible seats possible within the restaurant. Seated right next to the waiter kiosks system where all the water jugs are stationed. There were PLENTY of seats open. Okay no biggie. The place looks like nice inside but it's fully of snobby people. Bottom line, The food is a hit or a miss. The only thing we liked was the sea bass & prawn+black cod dumplings. Would NOT recommend this place to anyone unless you want to be surrounded by judgmental douche bags. My Suggestion? Nobu!",6,3,2,Sultan M.,"Brooklyn, NY",10,27,6
5.0,7/28/2015,"Very impressed with their restaurant week special. Best tip I can give? Go with a friend so you guys can share the two appetizers you get to choose (each), the entree, and dessert. I took a friend who can eat a lot and even he was stuffed by the end. Ambience is really cool and the music is quite loud, kind of like a club. Appetizers:Shrimp- The best appetizer IMO. I was surprised how much shrimp they gave :) They're fried to a perfect crisp and it comes with yummy sauce. Salmon Tartar- Had to get this and no regrets at all. Not nearly as big as their full sized one that comes with tuna but it was still so good. Great flavor and the shrimp chips they come with are so light and crispy!Beef Tataki- This is RAW beef for those who don't eat it! Really good if you know how to enjoy it. Only complaint is that the portion was super small (3 pieces). Dumplings- Standard, good dumplings. I'd go for another plate of shrimp over these though because the portion is also not that big. Main Course:We both wanted to get the rib eye but they were sold out so we got the skirt steak instead. By this time, we were still hungry and although the dish looks small, it was quite filling. Tender meat that is cooked the way you like it (I prefer medium rare to medium) and it comes with these fried garlic chips that are so good with the meat. Dessert:We got the green tea banana cake (I think that's the name) and it wasn't as good as I thought it'd be but still very yummy. It was an interesting combo. But tbh, we were already so full that we couldn't even finish the cake, which leans more on the heavier side. For drinks we got an Old Fashioned and a glass of Ruinart Champagne. Their old fashioned was good but I'm not an expert on those. I liked the champagne and I'd recommend if you don't like your champagne too sweet. Also it doesn't leave a weird aftertaste--very good very bubbly.",16,6,7,Tiffany E.,Hong Kong,515,345,1029

I asked him to pick the wines and food for the table. They have everything from sushi to steak to vegetarian, something for everyone! Jordan's picks were excellent!

By the time we left there,the friend said sorry to me more than a hundred times for having me there with her. That what it was... Ridiculous!!It took more than 30 mints to have the waiter comes to us for drink order. We ordered the drinks and the restaurant week menu for one each, it took more than 20 min but finally miso soups and salads came but not drinks. For appetizer, they served mine first, it was supposed be yellow tail SASHIMI, but 3 pc of very thin sliced yellow tail which they shouldn't have called it SASHIMI. Then 10 mints later, the friend's appetizer didn't served yet, but the waiter came to us and asked""did we serve sashimi yet?""Friend's appetizer came to her 10 min later, we were shocked and frozen. It wasn't even appetizer. It should be called a little tiny finger food. The only piece of a scallop...It took another 30 min to get the main dish which is called spicy tenderloin. It wasn't spicy at all. In fact, it was kind a sweet sauce as TERIYAKI. They cheated on the bill as well. Added the drink that we didn't even order, and unbelievably the couple who was seating next to us got the same issue as we did. They must be good at cheating on the bill. In addition, the cocktail that we ordered didn't taste any alcohol flavor at all. We were wondering if we picked them up from the non alcohol list, but they were on the cocktail list.

1.0,7/21/2015,"The experience at the restaurant was absolutely terrible. I was there this past Friday, June 17th with 2 other friends for an Omakase seating.To start, we were shoved in a back corner where we were constantly asked to move our seats because it was in the way of the servers path to get to another table. We were supposed to have sake pairings throughout, however, we only received (2) during the entire seating. We were also supposed to receive a dessert platter which did not come at all.In addition to that, our waiter was an exceptionally rude individual. Since we weren't receiving the sake pairings, we ordered drinks off the menu. We had to request our 1st round 3 times and didn't receive them until over an hour later. Our second round of drinks was requested twice. He spoke to us like children the entire time. Every time he asked a question, he would say ""ok, enjoy"" and walk away before even getting a response. They kept leaving empty, dirty plates on the table after bringing new dishes over. We had to ask a few times that the empty plates be taken away. When the food was brought over, they were not explaining what we were eating. They would just set it down on the table and walk away. We would have to call someone over to explain to us what the dishes were. At one point they brought sake glasses over so we thought we would be getting an additional pairing and then 15 minutes later they came and took the glasses away and we didn't receive an additional pairing throughout the rest of the meal.It seemed that our waiter thought we were more of an inconvenience than anything. As if we were asking him to do something outside the scope of his job.We spent over $300 a person for a dinner that was a complete nightmare.  For having paid that much per person, I expected much better service and treatment.We even arrived early for our 9:00pm reservation, at 8:45pm, and did not leave the restaurant until 12:30am due to the lack of service we received.Each of us have dined at the Miami location several times and were sincerely looking forward to the New York experience which completely fell flat.The saving grace that earns it 1 star?

They have some really cool and exotic drinks and the bartenders really take pride in the drinks they serve. The food and the service at dinner were by no means very good. Our waiter was extremely slow and it took us about an hour to get our food even though we only ordered simple sushi rolls. It didn't even come out at the same time so some people were eating while others were just waiting. Our waiter said that they only had one sushi chef in the back making the sushi which is absurd.

I ordered the businessman's $24 Chicken Teriyaki lunch. After waiting far too long, a clumsy waiter came up to me and asked if the soup and salad was for me. I nodded and he practically dropped it on me. The salad was beautiful and complex but the dressing was carelessly added far too lightly to the extent that most of the salad had no dressing. The miso soup was spectacular. A glass of water was almost dropped in front of me. While eating anther waiter asked me if the chicken teriyaki was for me. Very sad that the kitchen is incapable of keeping track of which meals go to which diner when the restaurant is almost empty. The beautifully prepared grilled marinated chicken breast was juicy and soft, but almost cold. It would have been nice if it were hot.  For dessert I ordered the exotic fruit, which was amazing.

For two people? When my sister and I balked at this (we shared four dishes), the waitress said we might be hungry because it's tapas style so she could come back later and we could order more dishes-which was really subtle. The four dishes we shared: rice hot pot, cod dumplings, miso cod and corn. All were winners except the hot pot, it was bland, and we hardly made a dent in it. The miso cod was outstanding but it's a tiny piece of fish for $37. We shared the special chocolate-not on the menu for dessert, which was warm with gooey hazelnut chocolate inside and the banana green tea cake which was very good with a generous portion of nuts and toffee surrounding the cake. Needless to say we were quite full. So, make sure you don't listen to your money-grubbing waiter or waitress who will try to make you order more dishes then you need.

It was my birthday. Need to work on finding better hostesses.     3rd time around: so upset with the service. We had schishito peppers which were painfully hot and they didn't even refill the water. I specifically asked for this truffle roll which they make with steak tartar to be made with tuna instead. I emailed before coming here and was told yes.

2.0,6/1/2015,"If you appreciate your hard work, money, and like being treated like a prince or princess, get in a cab and head up to NOBU. While some of the dishes are quite delicious and noteworthy at Zuma, it is a far cry from acceptable. To be positive , I want to note that our waiters were kind and pleasant. However, it was the hostess that tarnished our experience to the point where we will never be back. This is not our first time at Zuma, we have been many times in miami and a few times In nyc. It's always on our minds if we can get a reservation.  With that said, we had a 7 o'clock reservation last week. Admitting my, we were late and announced it upon arrival to the hostesses. While two sat pleasantly and smiled, we apologized for not calling and that we were 15 minutes late.  She straight faced looked up and said""you're 17 minutes late"". There was an awkward silence and for a second I thought we may not be given our table. She paused and directly looked into my boyfriends eyes. It was so uncomfortable it forced a second apology out of him. An apology she was waiting for so we can sit!   Fine- she gave us a good laugh and we were still ready to eat!  All the food was good,  no lies there.  However we did get the rice bowl with truffle ( an extra 38 dollars which we are happy to spend for truffle). It arrived, with no truffles on top and no real noticeable flavor of it either. We asked if they had maybe forgot to add it. The waiter , without going to check, said ""no it's in there"". He did not confirm, or offer additional. Those two combined situations are enough to send all my business to Nobu where they treat you like humans and make special occasions feel special.

1.0,5/31/2015,"Don't be fooled. If you have ever been to Zuma in Miami or London, or elsewhere, Zuma NYC will not meet your expectation. Cost aside, which is a given when you book at Zuma, the service was offensive. Everything from the ""models"" who barely greet you on the 2nd floor, to the bartender who was incapable of making a cocktail (even if the instructions are on the Aperol bottle, Ps. he tried 3 times), the food was 100 percent mediocre to conclude the lovely evening.

2.0,5/31/2015,"This place is for tourists, fans of Asian fusion cuisine, clubbers, or people who just appreciate the decor more than the food itself. We came on a Saturday at 6 and weren't seated until everyone arrived. We were seated in a table with plush leather chairs. It was actually quite nice, but felt kinda loungey. I guess that's why I see a lot of people who are dressed like they are about to hit the club-short dresses, high heels and casual button down shirts, which is not my scene. We were told that Zuma serves family style, and that it's best if each person orders 3-4 dishes. Since each dish on the menu was $15 and above, with entrees that looked good going for $40, we decided to order the ""omakase"" classic, the cheapest one on the menu. The classic one doesn't include any of the signature dishes such as the spiced tenderloin or the cod which we all wanted, so we decided to get those two dishes in addition to the ""omakase"". The classic also doesn't include any sashimi, so I'm wondering WTF is actually in this ""omkase"". Turns out cheap shit you can get anywhere else for $25 or less. I was extremely disappointed at what they served us for this so called ""omakase"". The drinks (at $18 per) was tasteless and watered down with tons of ice. I ordered something that had tequila, lychee, lime and elderberry with ginger, but tasted just mostly like watered down tequila. One of the worst drinks ever at such a steep price. First off, let me tell you what a joke the ""omakase""/""tasting menu"" was. I was expecting a small plate of tasting for each person, but that was not how it was. Instead, everything was served in 2 plates where the 7 of us picked off it. What kind of tasting menu is this? If I'm paying over $50, I expect my own plates of food. The first plate was edamame which wasn't part of the ""omakase"" btw. The waiter straight up asked if we wanted any edamame to start off with and we just said yes. For $7.50 a plate, you can just shoot your toe off. So the first actual plate of the ""omakase"" was fried calamari. It was nothing spectacular. Then came about 5 more dishes where each of us had 2 pcs. There was salmon sashimi that was marinated in some vinegar based sauce. It was actually good and refreshing. Then came gyoza that had cod in it. It was ok and you can taste some shrimp. Next was a roll that seemed to have tuna in it. That was one of the best dishes, which was sad because it's just a roll! Next up was yam that was overly smoky and definitely one of the worst of the night. After that was the mushroom hot pot. The rice was a bit too mushy for my liking, and it was a bit salty. Barely any of the earthiness of the mushroom permeated the rice. There was no umami taste at all. The last dish to come out was chicken, which was way too salty and tasted like my dad's ginger Chinese chicken. Basically all of this was $58 per person! If you go to a restaurant with an omakase of that price, you can get a much better deal and actually sample sashimi. I know we were told that there would be no sashimi in this classic ""omakase"" but I honestly had no idea that it just included the above dishes, which at no point would cost $58. Come on, gyoza!!!!!!!!!!!! And each of us only got 2 pcs of each, with the exception of the calamari. I basically was not full up to this point, but then our other entrees came out.The cod was not that great. It tasted like the one I made at home using Nobu's recipe. The one at Nobu is definitely the winner. The beef tenderloin was quite good, but if you ordered it as an entree, it would just come with that, with nothing else, not even rice for about $40. Desserts were mediocre. No one really liked the banana bread. It was not moist. The other dish which was like pudding was ok. Tangy and tasted like passion fruit pudding with mango strips. All of this came out to be $111 per person, which definitely was not worth it, especially the soda, costing at $6 a pop. It came with the ""share with"" bottle. The price would've been justified if the dishes were spectacular and unique, but none of the dishes were. It wasn't anything different and it all tasted like something I have had before. I am just really bummed that I paid all this money for very plain food that was not innovative at all. Never have I paid this much money and been so disappointed with the food.If you want exceptional food, don't come here. If you're looking for decor only, then this would be the place.

1.0,3/18/2015,"I went to this restaurant back in February on Valentines Day.  We were a party of 8 and a friend of ours had a reservation for four.  Not associated with ours.  She was seated at her time, 9:30 pm.   They kept saying we didn't have a reservation together so we need to wait.  Well wait we did.  All the way until 11 pm.  The entire 1.5 hours we waited, we kept asking the manager why he couldn't seat us at the 2 top and 6 top right next to each other.  He said no because 2 other people were waiting for the table.  There was another 2 top next to the original 2 top but he wanted to put them right in the middle so we would have to wait further, out of spite.  After all 8 of us kept pleading for 45 minutes, he finally asked these people to move to the other table and put us together.  But even before that, we waited at reception to give them our coats for about 5 minutes.  They just ignored us and looked at us like we were homeless.  Finally after being seated, the hostess and waitress apologized to us profusely.  But we were told that we should order family style because otherwise food would take too long to come out.  Really?  In NY?  8 people takes too long?  Well we had people with food preferences and allergies and couldn't order family style.  So while some of us were already eating dessert, others were waiting for main courses.  Food was okay, nothing better than your neighborhood sushi place.  Afterwards, we went to retrieve the credit card being held at the bar for drinks.  First they couldn't find it, then it took three people to try and scan it, which they couldn't do.  So after that terrible night and very UNROMANTIC, I tried to contact Zuma to let them know of the terrible service.  No answer.  Finally I sent them the same email 5 times in a row.  I got a response from one of the ""higher up"" managers, ""J. B.""  He listened to my story and told me that was terrible and he would speak to his bosses and see what they could do to make it better.  Just give him a few days.   Well, almost a week passed and suddenly I get a call from my friend who had a completely different reservation, sat at a different table and didn't even know what was going on with us.  She said she tried to make reservations and she was told she ""could not be accommodated"".  Basically she was on the ""temporary non-accommodation list"" as he put it.  I call it a blacklist.  I emailed J.B. and told him what happened.  He called me 5 minutes later and after a back and forth for a few minutes, he basically told me I was very vocal on the social media sites and if I want to remove the bad reviews I gave Zuma NYC, he would gladly accommodate my friend.  Is that called blackmail?  It surely is!!!!!  Well I felt bad for my innocent friend and removed the reviews but all the while I was boiling inside.  I didn't think it was okay for him to treat me like this.  So I did my research and found out this was a problem with many restaurants and companies in NYC.  So I emailed J.B. back and basically told him to remove my friend from the ""temporary non-accommodation list"" and put her on the VIP list offering her free meals for what they did to her.  I said the reviews are going back up with the addition of the attempt to make me remove bad reviews.  Apparently this worked as my friend got a phone call apologizing to her and of course removing her from the ""temporary non-accommodation list"".  Oh and I'm not on the ""temporary or permanent non-accommodation list"" either.  Thank you J.B.  I feel so special.  Isn't that funny.  Well the reviews are going back up everywhere because people should know how they treat you in Zuma NYC.",3,3,1,Ella B.,"Brooklyn, NY",381,10,0

1.0,3/5/2015,"ohhhhh zuma, i am so SAD to write this review. i used to visit your location in dubai for years and LOVED it. i was so excited to hear you were opening in NYC and anxiously awaited for months until i recently came for lunch. and it was a disaster. and i tried to speak to management about it and no one even bothered to come by our table despite all our problems or call me back when i called and asked to speak to someone but instead was asked to leave my name and number and promised a return phone call that never came. SO SAD. food first:i thought the food was as tasty as always. - the sushi rolls here are really good. we had the spicy tuna, the caterpillar, and the chirashi. - the miso cod lunch that came with salad and soup. good portion sizes and the salad dressing is so darn good. - edamame with chili paste was a nice twist on the usual salt dressing here. and it is a very large portion - beef skewers were a bit of a let down. the meat was a bit tough and there wasnt much seasoning or flavor going on. but this was the only bummer on the food front. now to the service were everything was a mess. again, i tried to talk directly to management about this but no one ever responded to my requests. so here goes:- 3 food items there were NOT ours were put on our table (both tables on either side of us also got incorrect food)- we specifically asked for edamame and beef skewers to start when we ordered. we got the soup and salad together almost immediately after sitting which was fine, we were hungry. then maybe 10 minutes later we got the miso cod (hmm, this doesnt seem right). then we got the skewers about 10 minutes later after we were almost done with the cod (hadnt seen our server to ask in the meantime). we finally got the edamame several minutes later as they were clearing all our other ""starter"" dishes. - then we waited about 30 minutes before we got our first sushi roll. sushi drama to ensue below...- our 3 sushi rolls were served at 3 separate times (we saw many sushi platters going by with multiple rolls on one plate, that would have made way more sense). these were the last items were were waiting on and it took 30+minutes to get all 3. a 1st roll came (again we ordered these all at the same time so not sure how they decided to send them out separately). it was tasty. then it was gone. then we had to ask our server no less than 4 times where our other rolls were. a 2nd roll finally came so we chowed down on that. then waited. asked again. server checked with the kitchen and came back to tell us all our rolls had been served... ahem.. clearly not to us! (which shouldnt be that surprising given 3 wrong dishes were put on our table but we sent all of those back, i guess someone just ate ours instead?). we told them which specific roll we were still missing. a manager was engaged (or maybe another server but at this point there were multiple people involved over at the sushi bar though no one was talking to us) and finally they brought us the 3rd roll. except they brought us the wrong one (it was the same one they had served us first). unbelievable!! we were beside ourselves (and actually laughed out loud bc what else can you do). our server noticed immediately, probably bc we were laughing and looking completely bewildered. he apologized and took the roll away and we finally got our last roll maybe 35-40 minutes after we got our first one. - the whole meal took 1:45 which made me late to my post lunch meeting. so you can probably see my point here. this was pure chaos. wrong food. horrible timing. disorganization in the service staff. and after all of this NO ONE ever came by to apologize. we had to ask our server for our check 3x before we finally got it and then rushed out to try to get to my meeting on time. i called the restaurant around 4pm that same day to speak to a manager but was told everyone was down on the lunch floor and someone would get back to me shortly. i left my name, phone number, brief description of the issue, and the reservation name. but never heard back from anyone and that was a week ago. so yelp here it is. the food is tasty (but pricey so know what you are getting into). but the service and management from my perspective is a complete disaster. they have been open for a month already so i would expect for them to have way more of these kinks worked out. and at a mimumum i would expect management to be in tune with poor experiences like this and respond appropriately to their customers. but alas it seems like zuma will be a fond memory for me from my time in dubai that is not meant to be replicated here in NYC.",10,6,4,Christina H.,"Manhattan, NY",54,533,110

1.0,2/27/2015,"Where should we start. Great potential to be a hot, trendy place but the service is one of the worst I've experienced in New York City. Primarily blaming the lack of professional service in the hostesses and waitresses. Extremely rude from the moment we walked in telling us we had to leave in 2 hours because they had another reservation after ours. Excuse me, but can we sit down first? They proceeded to come a third time to our table to remind us we had only 2 hours to order and eat and they would move us if we exceeded past the time. What a lack of respect and consideration for your patrons. Long story short, we were billed incorrectly where they charged $35 per glass of wine and said it was a miscommunication with the wine connoisseur. This isn't acceptable and we had to make the manager aware of this mistake. Frankly, I wouldn't go back ever again or risk taking our clients to avoid a bad experience.",5,1,0,C P.,"New York, NY",2,11,0

4.0,2/25/2015,"As an out-of-towner, I was pretty impressed with Zuma. To start, the space was gorgeous. With its tall ceilings, it was spacious, trendy and a place I just would love to ""be seen"" at. A business lunch brought me to Zuma based on the recommendation of my business associate. It was both of our first visits to Zuma and were excited to try as much of the menu as possible.Contrary to other Yelp reviews, the hosts were very pleasant and not the least bit rude. Our server was knowledgeable of the menu and was able to give great guidance for specific recommendations. Our food was delivered by several different servers and we didn't see too much of our main server throughout the meal. Some of the servers provided much more detail than others about the dishes that arrived at our table tapas style. Although we didn't see much of our server, our waters were constantly being refilled and there wasn't much that we needed him for. So onto to the food! We really tried to pick something from each section of the menu and ended up with the following dishes:-Yellowtail sashimi with green chili relish, ponzu and picked garlic-Sweet corn with shiso butter and shichimi pepper- A two piece sushi dish that is slipping my mind at the moment-Lamb chops with miso and picked myoga-Black cod marinated in saikyo miso with homemade hajikame-Spicy beef tenderloin with sesame, red chili and sweet soyI thought we also ordered the rock shrimp, but I do not recall tasting it. We did order the green tea and banana cake and ashai sundae, however I had to leave to catch a bus before the dessert came out. Pro-tip: they have a business lunch menu if you have limited time. So everything was great but the standout by far was the cod. It absolutely melted in my mouth and was very flavorful even without the sauce. The beef tenderloin was also cooked to perfection, and the sesames added something special to an already nice piece of beef. Thankfully the meal was a business expense as it seemed fairly pricy. Each plate was on the smaller size so I couldn't see myself coming back for a casual meal. I would certainly consider returning for a special occasion, and would recommend it to others who don't object to a steeper price tag.",4,0,2,Michelle P.,"Philadelphia, PA",496,1276,7174
5.0,2/24/2015,"One of my favorite restaurants.. My boyfriend and I waited anxiously for the NYC location opening after trying the Miami location. We heard some mixed reviews regarding the food.. However, we loved every bite tasted and second spent here! The restaurant is huge, beautifully decorated, dimly lit (but you can see everything) has high ceilings and a romantic feel. There is a lounge area upstairs where you can hang out by the bar and enjoy the many different specialty cocktails that are available :) We were overly excited to eat. We came here for Valentine's Day for an early dinner - 6:00pm. We were a couple of minutes late, called ahead and were told that it was no issue. We arrived about 5-7 minutes late and were seated right away after checking in our coats. Our waiter was really nice and friendly. The drinks were sooooo yummy (do not remember the names.. unfortunately).Now for the food: - tuna & salmon tartar w| some delicious seaweed crackers (amazing, melts in your mouth.. might be the best I have ever had) - rock shrimp tempura - YUMM - fried calamari - delicious- edemame w| the chili was amazing - so simple yet so tasty- the black cod - so delicious & it melts in your mouth (not going to lie the piece isn't large for the amount of $ you pay)- spicy tuna roll (this was the only roll that I remember the name of for some reason, we got a couple of other rolls) all of the sushi was delicious and everything was fresh! However, I will mention that the sushi rolls in Miami were more elaborate and there were more choices to choose from. I hope that Zuma will add a larger variety of sushi rolls but overall we were very satisfied. Desserts were phenomenal!!! Get the Zuma Chocolate Cake!!! It's not on the menu (not sure why) but it is heavenly. The Miso Creme Brûlée was also delicious!! Will definitely be coming back here! And I cannot wait!!",6,2,3,Julie A.,"Brooklyn, NY",348,84,1595

2.0,2/17/2015,"As a regular at Zuma Miami, was excited that the New York location was finally opening. Had a hard to get reservation for Friday Feb 13th. We arrived early for our 8:30pm reservation, and were told they didn't have it. We showed the email confirmation and still nothing. At 8:30 when the rest of our party of 4 arrived, they said, just wait in the bar. At 9pm, they finally sat us, said they did have the reservation after all. The decor and atmosphere are absolutely beautiful.  We had a prime table location in the main dining room, hungry and excited to taste some of our favorite dishes. We ordered a bottle of cold sake, waiter came back to tell us they were out of it, he didn't have a drink menu with him, so we had to ask him to get one so we could pick another. After getting our sake we were anxious to order our favorite dishes. We knew exactly what we wanted and ordered several rolls ( all fresh and delicious),tuna/salmon tartar ( delicious & consistent w/ Miami), kinoko no Kama meshi (rice hotpot w/ wild mushrooms and Japanese vegetables), were disappointing, watery did not have same taste or consistency as Miami), baby chicken ( were out of it), Rib Eye no daikon ponzu fumi ( steak) kinda tough, not as tasty as Miami) mushrooms ( great), maguro no takaki ( plain, not very tasty). We had to pour our own sake, as waiter was never refilled our glasses. Desserts were good, Zuma special chocolate and green tea & banana cake, we asked for a combo dessert for 4, but waiter said they couldn't do it, we saw it come out for another table as we were eating our dessert. Was a bit surprised. The waiter was mediocre at best, not what we are used to at Miami. Overall, the food was inconsistent, service mediocre ( both because of waiter and hostess). Having been open only 3 weeks, they are still working out a number of recipe issues, and service issues, which are highlighted against the top service and food at Zuma Miami.

Rock shrimp: they are fried shrimp with a side of spicy mayo, that's it.  Avoid the artichokes with truffle oil and zucchini. The salmon tataki and the spicy edamame were very good.

A little pricey for the meal maybe but if you don't mind the price tag, you get a quality satisfying and creative meal. There was lots of variety and included the usual stars with a twist. We had sushi and sashimi (aji, tai, kanpachi, and toro), spicy lobster miso soup, beef tataki wrapped around daikon, grilled beef wagyu, pork belly skewers, corn and lobster tempura, Japanese mushroom rice hotpot (kind of reminded me of risotto), tomato and eggplant salad, King crab with ponzu lime butter, scallops with caviar, crunchy sliced artichokes, and seabass sashimi (not in that order, that just happens to be the order I remember) it in. The dessert platter sparked the envy of surrounding tables and was everything I want in dessert on one plate. Exotic fruits, Japanese custard (kind of like panna cotta), some sort of tiramisu that looked like a dirt plant, white chocolate coconut truffles, ice cream and banana green tea cake. Venue was really neat looking and felt trendy without being pretentious (we also went for lunch so maybe that's why it felt casual).Service was great. Our server was a lovely lady who was sweet, pleasant and friendly. It was sometimes a little hard to understand the description of the items when they were presented by the Japanese servers but I appreciated the effort! The bus boys were efficient but at times a little quick to clear the table (you would literally have just lifted the last piece up to your mouth to have the plate underneath with all the sauces scooped away)!

Firstly the food is merely ok. The sushi was as good as any high end place in New York but the robata grill was a dissapointment.  The timing was off and even though we sat at the robata bar both things we had (Alaskan king crab and zucchini) were cold. The killer was dessert. We ordered 2 glasses of Moscato do Asti and they both came out flat. No big deal, we mentioned it to the server and she promptly brought us 2 fresh glasses. Only problem? They were warm and served in much smaller glasses than the first round. We didn't drink either of them. Then....the bill came. $271.00 for two of us. Both glasses of Moscato were on there even though we dIdn't drink any of it and to add insult to injury they charged us $3.00 for ponzu sauce. We mentioned all of this to the manager who gave me a firm handshake and apologized but didn't take a thing off the bill.

It might be that I didn't order the right stuff, but I didn't feel like spending $40 for a small piece of fish.Zuma reminds me of Nobu in that it's a flashy Japanese restaurant with a 4-letter name and really pricey food that tastes good but isn't really worth it.Much like Nobu, the Maki are very mediocre, so I fell for the idea of ordering the cheaper stuff from the sushi menu again, and was pretty disappointed. I just can't bring myself to spend $10+ for an order of nigiri that is also fairly average, so we tried some of the somewhat reasonably-priced rolls instead, which aren't as reasonable as they appear when you see how small the pieces are.We were seated at the sushi bar, leaving us completely ignored and doing our damnedest to flag down our very sweet waitress whenever we needed something. The place is huge, and is ideal for bringing a date to impress, but not necessarily to go out for a satisfying meal. On to the sub-$30 items we felt like ordering:- Zuma Salad ($15)Much like you would expect from a typical salad, this was very average. Skip it.- Yellowtail Sashimi ($15.50)Again, this reminded me exactly of the dish at Nobu. This was overly enthusiastically recommended by our server, and it was just pretty good, but not really satisfying for 4 thin slices of fish for nearly $16.- Vegetable Tempura ($14.50)This was at least more substantial, and pretty tasty. It consisted of 6 or 7 sizable pieces of deliciously fried assorted vegetables, and wasn't too greasy. This is a good choice to help you fill up since a lot of the other stuff is small.- Chirashi Maki ($11)- Spicy Tuna Maki ($11.50)- Unagi Maki ($14)The maki mostly all tasted the same. Cut into 8 small pieces, they were pretty good, but really weren't much better than a high quality take out spot. It's probably a better value though, considering that one of the small slabs of fish costs about the same as these 3 rolls.- Rice Hot Pot ($19)A big clay pot of piping hot rice with plenty of mushrooms, this was pretty good, though it was a bit mushy, especially with the added consistency of those mushrooms.- Shiro Miso Creme Brûlée ($10)Dessert was definitely the best part of the meal. Served with pear crisps and yuzu ice cream, it wasn't quite a proper version of creme brulee, as the top layer was not at all crispy enough, but the whole thing together with the ice cream made for a satisfying combo.- Green Tea and Banana Cake ($10)This dessert was even better. Served with coconut ice cream and peanut toffee sauce alongside the tall, thin cake, it was also a nice combination of contrasting flavors. I would skip a pricey main course and get 4 desserts instead next time.I don't see a need to return here, but they'll do just fine with big groups and happy hour crowds for sure.",28,6,8,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1694,69834
3.0,1/28/2015,Food was pretty good but it's sooo slow. Went for a business lunch and it took almost 2 hours for 3 of us to eat. Don't go here if you have a schedule to keep.,0,0,0,Bill C.,"KNICKERBOCKER, NY",0,3,0
5.0,1/27/2015,"Venue - STUNNING! Staff - BEYOND amazing!Food - FANTASTIC!I'm a huge Zuma London fan and did have my reservations that the new NYC branch wouldn't be a match, but for the first time in my life (!) I was wrong!The steak is simply phenomenal. It literally melts in your mouth. Highly recommend the chocolate pudding for desert. Totally full of calories, I'm sure, but well worth it!Our server (Skylar?) was beyond amazing. She knew the menu to perfection but actually asked the right questions as to what we like to eat, rather than her favourite dish. Super efficient and a true delight.Can't rate this place highly enough.",1,1,2,Alex W.,"New York, NY",36,9,1
5.0,1/27/2015,Zuma is a beautiful restaurant and has a really cool vibe. I've been to the restaurant in Miami before and I think they are very comparable. Things you MUST order: the king crab with ponzu lime butter and the spicy beef tenderloin with sesame with red chili and sweet soy. I went to Zuma over a week ago and I still can't stop thinking about either of these dishes. The drinks are also awesome. They have a speakeasy craft to them and are super creative and beautiful. Zuma is a must try in my book!,0,0,0,Arielle F.,"Manhattan, NY",2,11,1
1.0,1/24/2015,"Waiting forever for Zuma to open.  Got to the front door without a reservation. Greeted by the host - no tables but suggested we go upstairs to the lounge. We said ok no problem - we were then informed no sushi available on upstairs menu. Ok no problem. Walked upstairs greeted by hostess who insisted we must check our coats. I said i would prefer to keep my  coat. So i proceeded to the bar - with my coat. Ordered a $22.00 tequila and club, next thing i know the maitre d came up and said its Zuma policy - you must check your coat. I told him i wanted to keep my coat. He said you must check it. Uuuummmm check please - and he let us leave - you want to make it in this town - loose the attitude - see ya Zuma",11,2,3,Milo A.,"New York, NY",33,9,0
3.0,1/24/2015,"I have to start saying its nicely decorated and it's one of the biggest Zuma restaurants I've been too, the drinks are great. I've been to Zuma in London, Dubai, Miami and I love everything about them but I was so disappointed with NYC Zuma 's food, the quality doesn't meet other zuma's. We asked for spicy tuna roll and it was not that fresh, we had to send the black cod back as it had a very bad fishy taste /smell, espresso was really cold . DJ/ music wasn't good at all and to be honest I would give 6 out of 10. Btw, manager came and apologized . Please check your bills before you pay as They charged us 6drink instead of 4",4,1,0,Sahel G.,"Jersey City, NJ",11,33,19
4.0,1/23/2015,"I have been anticipating the opening of Zuma  in NYC for the longest time after getting to go in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, London and Miami. It is one of my favorite restaurants in the world, which is why I'm giving the NYC location a high rating. Unfortunately though, the NYC location has a lot of kinks to work out and doesn't deserve 4 stars yet in my mind. This particular location is overstaffed and to make matters worse, the staff are undertrained. Our waitress messed up our order and did not even try to fix it. We ordered the Wagyu beef but instead got the ribeye. When we told the waitress, we were told ""No, you ordered this."" Excuse me? I think we would know. Get your Wagyu options straight. On top of that, the busboys tried to clear every dish even when there was still food on it and we had to fight to finish our meal. The food was for the most part consistent, so it did not disappoint. I'm going to give it a month and try again.",0,0,0,Helen B.,"Manhattan, NY",118,59,63
5.0,1/21/2015,"4.5 starsIn short: the food is fantastic. However, they still have a few kinks to work out - waiter doesn't seem as familiar with the menu as he should be. We were the first customers but they were ""out"" of my first cocktail order and the scallop tartare.  They did make it up to us by offering a complimentary chefs dish (see below) which was delicious and a very nice touch. - cocktails have high quality ingredients and are very well prepared. We had robabu and sin city and love both. - excellent sea bass sashimi appetizer- very fresh scallop sashimi- really great take on Gyoza- beef tataki has a generous amount of truffle and flavorful sauce - rolls are good but nothing special (had their version of California roll) -scallop skewers - perfectly prepared and fresh - tuna tataki - well executed with tangy sauce - we got this dish ok - pork belly skewers - nicely seared, juicy with creamy mustard sauce - they have is a special wagyu  beef with truffle roll to try to make up for not having the scallop sashimi. Very nice touch by management and it was fantastic. Definitely something they should add to the menu soon.- green tea and banana cake - great- chocolate cake - good but nothing special- shobacha tea - good",0,0,0,Victoria B.,"New York, NY",0,21,9
5.0,1/19/2015,"Certainly on its way to be one of the top restaurants in the city. From beautiful setting, excellent service to superb Japanese food. Even If you don't like sushi you will find out that this restaurant offers excellent cooked choices. We loved the spicy beef, lamb chops and prawn.",1,0,0,Peer D.,"Ridgefield Park, NJ",0,24,1
4.0,1/16/2015,"I was lucky enough to be invited as a guest for their soft opening. Let me start off by saying how gorgeous the restaurant is. The stone, the lighting, and design is incredibly beautiful. The service: Shelby our waiter, was very on point. Upon seating, he changed out our white cloth napkins for black ones so that we wouldn't get lint on our black/dark clothing. This is just an example of the level of service we received that evening. With that said, onto the food:We started with the beef tataki (gyu no tataki to triuffle) and all I have to say is WOW. This dish was the definition of perfection.  The delicious flavor of the shaved truffle hits first, which then gives way to the beef and then ends with the perfect amount of acidity in the pickled daikon and Yuzu sauce to balance out the richness of the truffle. Again...Wow and a must order when you come. Next was the prawn and black cod dumplings (gindara to ebi no gyoza), which were delicious. The skin is very thin so it wouldn't interfere with the large chunks of prawn and codfish. A delightful and juicy bite of creamy goodness.The Sushi was fresh but not their strong suit. They did a seared preparation of O-Toro, but I think they should have left an already perfect piece of sushi as is. The sear made the O-Toro taste more like SeaBream than the usual melt-in-your-mouth Toro. Don't change something that's already perfect. Also, The sushi rice was too thick and heavy, and the portion of rice to sushi was a off as well. (My review of the sushi may be a bit harsh because I am comparing it with some of the top sushi restaurants in NY like Nakazawa and Soto)The Black Cod was another dish I was  Particularly impressed with because I have yet to try a fish dish that I really enjoyed. (I've been so disappointed in most fish preparations that I almost started a blog that focused on finding the perfect fish dishes) The Black cod was the best preparation of cod I have ever had. A very simple dish that highlighted the cod, which was also cooked to perfection, with a simple drizzle of miso mustard to add a slight sweentess.  Amazing and thoroughly impressed.Next, we had the Madagascar tiger prawn. The sheer mass of this prawn was surprising. Unfortunately, the preparation of this dish did not live up to it's presentation. The Prawn itself was perfectly cooked, but the flavor was a bit disappointing. We also had the scallops skewers, shitake mushrooms, and the ribeye, which were delicious yet paled in comparison to the other exceptional dishes that I tasted that evening.",3,1,0,Naya L.,"Rockville Centre, NY",54,7,1
4.0,1/16/2015,Got invited to friends and family and it did not disappoint. The staff was pleasant and was always attentive. The food was good and the drinks were refreshing. The beef tataki was a great dish to start off with. The truffle on top def enhanced the flavors. The Madagascar tiger prawn was a nice presentation.  The miso mustard black cod is a must order. Really good. Def try this place out. Will def go again. The food took sometime but it was a soft opening so they will work their kinks out.,1,0,0,Jeffrey L.,"New York, NY",24,5,15
5.0,1/16/2015,"Second time is a charm!  Ever since I first dined at the location in Abu Dhabi, I have been dying for this location to open its doors and embrace my heart, soul, mind, and wallet again!  There are no exact words to describe the experience of Zuma, but I will try my best!The moment you walk in the doors, the staff is kind and present with warm smiles.  The smiles are because they might be working at the happiest place on earth - sorry Disney, you have been topped.The food, the food, the drinks, the food...The portions are not small nor are they large.  The portions are simply perfect in size and quantity. They give you just enough to then say, ""I need to come back for just that one bite.""  And you will.The drinks?  The wine list?  Yes. Yes. And, yes.  The staff?  They might be the second greatest thing about the place, next to the food.  Unpretentious, easy going, smart (like not jerky but real) and human.My favorite is this black cod that comes wrapped in a leaf of the tree of life.  How they cook it...couldn't care less because it melts into my tongue and then begs me to take another bite.  The dumplings with prawn and crab - seriously, do I need to say more?If you need, desire, crave something new and GOOD, spend your time, and money, at Zuma...you will not regret it one bit.",2,0,1,Dannielle G.,"Houston, TX",25,81,12
