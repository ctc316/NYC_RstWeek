2.0,4/29/2019,"A tired old diner setup charging tourist prices.  When you walk in, you can sense the aura of lingering disappointment.  This place is so bad that it has its own metaphysical energy.My wife had the eggs benedict, which wasn't bad.  I had a lobster roll, which was a couple pieces of lobster on an oversized crusty piece of toast, with stale potato chips thrown on the side.  We both had some of their very standard coffee.The bill came to $80, so $95 after tip.  At that point, my hotel's $40 breakfast buffet seemed like a bargain.  Even the price for room service would have been comparable.",0,1,0,Patrick M.,"Macungie, PA",52,50,10
4.0,4/22/2019,"Got to know this restaurant through lunch takeouts! They do have the best miso salmon salads in town. It is definitely unbeatable with more than 10 different veggies and fruits and delicious miso salmon! However, the price is quite hefty for a salad ($26) so it is more of an indulgent experience than a daily order!",0,0,0,Majer M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,28,47
4.0,4/8/2019,Great location on 48th and Lex on the 1st floor of Hotel 48Lex. Nice bar area and great option for breakfast/brunch and you'll see a good mix between business people and casual diners for lunch. Food generally good and you have decent vegetarian option as well. Brunch is awesome lunch is okay. Restroom is on a different floor and you need to go through the hotel elevator so sub-optimal but otherwise good option.

4.0,3/31/2019,"The food here is excellent. Friendly & conversational staff. We made our reservations for 10:15am on a Sunday through Open Table, and it's good we did because the place was (expectedly) busy! Great location in UES. We had the chicken & waffles eggs benedict (benedict of the week), home fries, and egg whites/chicken spinach wraps. All three were well seasoned & full flavored. Coffee was good but overpriced ($5 for a cup, refills seem to be free though). I tried the Moscow mule mimosa. Great ginger/lime flavor. Rating this 4 stars due to the slightly exaggerated prices. $22 for French toast is a bit steep, but I suppose it's to be expected for the neighborhood.",0,0,0,Starryshoulder ..,"Allston, Boston, MA",0,5,0
4.0,3/25/2019,Came for dinner and drinks with a couple of friends.  Decor is nice.  It was very crowded in a Tuesday but perhaps that's to be expected in New York.  I ordered a glass of rose and a glass of Sauvignon blanc later on.  Both weren't great.  My friends liked their drinks one had a watermelon cocktail and the other a glass of Champaign.  We had a kale artichoke dip with chips for an app.  It was really good.  Then for dinner I had a salad that was supposed to have chicken and quinoa but they easily switched it to salmon for me.  It was really delicious.  The salmon was cooked perfectly and I liked that it was cut and seared into bite sized pieces.  Everything in the salad was very fresh and tasty.  I would definitely return for that salad again.,1,0,3,Sandy J.,"Westwood, NJ",193,186,185
4.0,3/23/2019,"Happened to be in the area and came across this awesome place. I will say we came earlier than the usual crowd on a Saturday so we had no wait and got seated immediately. We got coffee, a fruit salad and Fried Chicken eggs Benedict special which was 5 stars on its own. The location was nice modern with elements of classical charm. The staff were very polite, helpful and attentive. Overall I thought it was a nice quick satisfying brunch in a really nice environment.

5.0,3/7/2019,"I had came here yesterday for lunch with my team at work and it was great! We work a couple of blocks away and wanted to go somewhere for a team lunch that was sit down and a bit nicer than the places we typically would go to so we picked here. Being that it was the middle of the work day, we each had work to get back to, so we informed our waiter that we had a time limit, and they were very accommodating and speedy. We had made a reservation and our table was ready right when we arrived. This is in a very business-y area, so I'm sure they are used to this on a daily basis as they probably host multiple business lunches daily. Inside is very nicely decorated and is a large place. I would definitely recommend coming here for a work function, a place to take a client, or just for a regular meal.We ordered off the lunch menu and I had such a hard time choosing because there was so many delicious sounding things to pick from. I ended up getting the grilled mahi sandwich and it was delicious. There was avocado on the sandwich and they did not cheap out on that at all, there was sooo much. It was also served w chips that were really good. One of my co-workers ordered the miso salmon salad and that looked delicious as well and I almost regret not ordering that! I will definitely get that the next time I go back. Another co-worker had the kale salad and added chicken which was bone-in, and I typically don't like bones in my chicken, but hers looked amazing. It was cooked amazingly and looked so tender and flavorful, also something I'd be interested in ordering.As soon as you walked into the restaurant, you get a huge whiff of truffle, so we had to order the truffle fries for the table and they were delicious!Great choice for a Midtown-East lunch, would be great for dinner as well.

3.0,3/4/2019,"This place is very close to where I work so I decided to take one of my clients here. I ordered myself an eggs benedict and to be honest, it was not bad at all but it wasn't amazing either. However, I would've given it 4 stars if the service was better. The cups were dirty before I touched it and it takes a while for the servers to notice me, I would say it was a subpar dining experience and wouldn't rate it more than 3/10. It was also very pricey for a regular meal.",1,0,0,Cindy K.,"New York, NY",330,75,166

5.0,2/22/2019,"Had such a wonderful meal here last Saturday. The food was absolutely delicious. We ordered lobster rolls, short rib, and eggplant parm as our mains. All amazing. Sides we had Parmesan truffle fries, shaved brussles sprouts, mac and cheese, shishito peppers, and crispy cauliflower. My brother originally ordered the mussels instead of the lobster rolls but at the last minute the manager came by to tell us that the last batch was not good and that the chef did not feel comfortable serving them. She was super apologetic and offered to make him anything on the house. She ended up making a bunch of lobster rolls (double the normal portion), gave us the side of crispy cauliflower (holy crap--best thing I ever ate--think rock shrimp but cauliflower), and comped everything that he himself ordered including his glass of wine. She really went above and beyond and for that (along with the yummy food and cozy ambiance) I will be returning!",0,0,0,J N.,"Manhattan, NY",0,17,3

Kobe meatballs weren't my fav lil too tough.  I order the pork chop was sliced off bone was very good.  Others had steaks all enjoyed.  They got us in and out fast to make show.

3.0,1/20/2019,"Went for brunch on a Sunday with my boyfriend.  He got an omelette with spinach, ham and mushrooms. I got the Belgian waffle.  We got a side of chicken sausage.  He enjoyed the omelette - it was a solid B, nothing to write home about.  It came with hash browns, a small salad and toast.  The waffle was too dense for me.  The taste was pleasant enough but it was just too doughy and frankly a bit dry.   The fruit pieces - banana and strawberry - that came on top were a bit of a random combination with the waffle but tasty enough.  The sausage was just ok - the patties were a bit small.  For the price point, which is a dollar or so above other brunch spots in the area - thinking of the smith and La Pecora Bianca - we were hoping it would be at least as good.  Alas it was not.",0,0,0,Rose S.,"New Haven, CT",2,6,12

1.0,12/24/2018,"Wow! I was hopeful to be able to post a great review about their breakfast food because it looks really yummy....however we never found out the answer. We waited ONE HOUR for our breakfast food to be brought to our table - yep eggs, pancakes, omelette etc that take 7 minutes to cook. Our waiter was very forgetful, never checking back with us with coffee refills. He spent 15 minutes stapling receipts together while we sat and waited. When we finally had had enough, we had to inform the hostess we were leaving- without ever getting our food. She summoned the manager who tried to get us to stay but we were already out the door. Good management would have been out on the floor helping their staff, delivering food, refilling coffee etc. instead I'm pretty sure our waiter forgot our order, and he let us sit there for an hour- without apology or checking in on us- until we finally got up and left! Very very poor service and management here! Tables around us that were seated after us got their food....it was just a terrible experience.

Everything from the tuna taco appetizers to the salmon salad were wonderful, and the lack of romaine lettuce was not too impactful. Service was attentive but not overbearing, and note one has to descend to the 'SC' level to find the restrooms which are in the adjacent hotel.

At first they told me it would be a 30 minute wait, then gave us a table stipulating that we had to be finished in an hour (fine by me). Had the delish Belgian waffles with banana and fruit, especially enjoyed the fruit butter it came with. Side of bacon was crispy without being dried out. Fresh squeezed OJ was sweet and fresh. Service was friendly but slow due to the crowded room. Pricey but that's to be expected in tourist-ridden midtown next to a Marriott.

We shared the French toast, and each got Eggs Benedict. The French toast has a delicious carmelized top and was plated on top of a blueberry lemon compote sauce.

I haven't had brioche since before I became vegan because brioche is never vegan. I called the day before the dinner to clarify if the bread was somehow vegan and the employee I spoke to said it was. I asked if she could double check because I was still suspicious. Another employee came to the phone and said it was actually NOT vegan but they could sub vegan bread if I wanted. That's what I did and it ended up being really good but they really need to clarify the menu!I'm lucky I knew to double check but it's irresponsible and kind of immoral to label something vegan on the menu and then serve a dish that contains eggs, milk and butter.",1,0,2,Becky F.,"New York, NY",70,435,58

It's not a big spot but the high ceilings and generous glass frontage never makes you feel cramped.  Without reservations you might have to grab a seat at the bar. The restaurant is located on a corner and allows for plenty of window seats which I love. Overall, they have a great brunch menu with something for everyone. The cinnamon roll pancakes were the star of this brunch. They are super sweet and might be a little too much for one person but perfect to share. I loved the cream cheese frosting and the candied almonds. I'm always afraid the pancakes will be too dry and boring, but these were definitely not. I would come back for the pancakes. We also tried the vegan impossible burger it was above average, and I applaud them for having a great vegan option on the menu.  For sides we had the sweet potato quinoa hash browns and parmesan truffle fries. The hash brown was ok but not exciting the truffle fries on the other hand were very good and complimented the sweetness of the pancakes. The food was great but unfortunately, I'm a little disappointed with the service. They seemed a little stressed and inattentive.

The mimosas had too much OJ even after asking for there to be a light touch on it, and that happened on the second round too even after asking it to be even lighter the second time.Our group shared the cinnamon roll pancakes for the table and these were quite tasty, fluffy and not dry. It's probably too sweet for 1 person to eat the whole thing unless you have a major sweet tooth.2 people ordered the eggs Benedict and another the avocado toast.  The avocado toast looked very good with some pomegranate seeds sprinkled on top and was also a generous portion size. I don't like classic Benedict so didn't try but the potatoes that came on the side were crispy and well seasoned though a little dry and so needed a lot of ketchup.

The burger was less impressive. It was quite large and had a lot of toppings, but lacked flavor. We got the sauce on the side, but even adding that to the mix didn't punch it up for me.

Great for a group or date night especially if you want to chat with one another. Good service and nice decor. It has an old school yet modern touch to it. The drink menu is fun. They have lots of fun drinks like lush lemonade and randy shandy. I would recommend trying one of their drinks especially if you want something different. They also have a good selection of wine by the glass. As far as menu, freer variety of vegetarian options if you don't eat meat like me. For apps, we got the fried cAuliflower which I highly recommend   if you are a fan of rock shrimp. The kale and artichoke dip is a great sharing option. We also tried the calamari which was very good as well. For entrees, we tried the impossible burger with the side of chips. Delicious! Especially if you don't eat meat. Our friend ordered the fried chicken which looked really yummy. We also ordered the gem Cesar salad, which had a nice light dressing not heavy and creamy like typical Cesar dressings.

No could I get you something else for you toast, just No.I won't come back as there are plenty of places to grab an equally tasty breakfast where the service leaves you feeling good about being their valued customer.If you do not place much stock in service, the food I had was worth the price paid.",0,0,0,James C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,2

I had asked for a specialty cocktail but without one ingredient and was told it was not possible because they were all pre made. But for $15 per cocktail at a pretty nice restaurant, that should not be the case. Also, we got the steamed mussels to start which were delicious and came in an amazing wine sauce, but there were quite a few unopened mussels. One or two is usually normal, but there were about five.

3.0,1/1/2018,"The good: the food here is excellent and well thought out. The combinations and ingredients all worked well together and were really tasty. We had the crispy cauliflower, which was unique and flavorful. This was also the case for the spaghetti and vegan burger. I would eat here again just for the food, but would probably get take out and here's why: My wife and I decided to try the Lexington Brass because of their location and their menu, which was very vegetarian friendly. We were excited about it and then walked in and were greeted with a sign that mocked those who choose a vegan or vegetarian diet. It was odd considering how vegan/vegetarian friendly the place is and upset my wife, but we preceded to sit anyway because we did not want it to ruin our last night in the city. For an upscale looking place with such a great menu, the decor was a bit conflicting with the TV in the sitting area, but it's small so I can understand. However, I think less seating and better use of the space would be appreciated. We were seated immediately but right next to the cash register, which resulted in an interruption to our conversation every time the waiter needed to ring someone up. If this was a casual dining experience, I'd be okay with it, but this is not a cheap place. The service was also okay, but not exceptional for a $100 meal. And that's what it comes down to really, the food was probably worth the money, but the service and experience really brought it down.

It was tender but the herb crusting and overall not very flavorful.  Needed more spice and salt for sure.  There was nothing special on the menu for the holiday and no acknowledgement of the special occasion even though noted on the reservation.",0,0,0,Malia K.,"Honolulu, HI",289,126,49

The biscuit was cooked on the outside but raw on the inside. Good thing I saw it before biting into it. Raw dough can give you a stomach ache. Plus, the collard greens were cold. Presentation was good. They had a tiny fry basket for the chicken and a measuring cup for the mashed potatoes. They comped mac and cheese in place of the biscuit. The flavor was there but tasted a bit floury. I would have preferred they asked me what I wanted instead of just giving me something in place of it. Questionable if I'll be back.

Seating is not only tight, but certain two tops are located against the waiter and busboy stations, so if you're unfortunate enough to be seated there (we were) your meal is constantly interrupted by busy waiters clanging silverware and spilling water.  Our server was obviously more interested in being anywhere but there, and not only was the wait for our food extensive, he was oblivious to us when we tried to flag him down for something as simple as coffee.  My wife requested English breakfast tea which he insisted they had, but instead brought another tea already steeping with the label conveniently ripped off - and she is enough of a tea aficionado to know it wasn't what she ordered.  I had eggs Benedict which were OK, and my wife's waffles were fine, so had the waiter been polite, the seating more accommodating and the food prepared on time, Lexington Brass would have been just OK.",0,0,0,Bill R.,"Bonita Springs, FL",1,64,0

3.0,12/2/2017,"We had our Thanksgiving meal here after watching the Macy's parade. To me it was just ok. My niece's glass had a lipstick mark on it & it wasn't from her. The waiter wasn't very apologetic about it. Maybe it happens a lot? For starters we had ricotta chestnut ravioli, truffle Mac n cheese or butternut squash bisque. I chose the ravioli - that was actually probably my favorite part of the meal. I tried the Mac n cheese and just thought it was ok. The ravioli was really good, I would definitely eat it again! For our main dish we had prime rib or turkey. One person had the prime rib & said it was pretty good. I had the turkey, it was a little dry. I could have used a bit more of the gravy. We had green beans, sweet potatoes & cranberry sauce as sides. I'm not a huge cranberry sauce fan, I tried it & it was a bit tart (as cranberries are) but I had to try it. The beans & sweet potatoes were both pretty good. Dessert choices were pumpkin cheesecake or apple pie. I went with the cheesecake. It wasn't as dense as I like it & could have had more pumpkin flavor. The scoop of ice cream that came with dessert was ridiculously small. I had a bite of the apple pie & it was better than the cheesecake. They started cleaning off the table while were were putting in our coats, made it seem like they wanted us to leave asap.

3.0,10/12/2017,"Ive gone to Lexington Brass several times prior to last night. The food is usually very good and the decor allows you to dress a bit more casual or dressy if you please. That being said last night the one disappointing factor was the  overall service. I was with two other people and walked in to Lexington Brass at about 7:35 and the hostess asked if we had reservations, which we did not. She said it would be a 30 minute wait because they were waiting for people to arrive. There were many open tables. So someone in my group went into open table on their phone and made a reservation for 740 pm as there was availability. The hostess looked frustrated (as she was outsmarted) and said ""Well, you'll have to be out before 830 because we'll have more people coming. "" I found this rude , and haven't experienced this prior. As we were in a rush we said no problem and sat. We ordered almost immediately (burgers are fantastic, as is the octopus appetizer, could have done without the cauliflower rice) , but our order was not ready until 830. We hadn't complained about the long wait, but the hostess walked around and glared at us. The best part- per my last picture, there were Plenty I'd open spots the entire time, even at 830 when we received a glare. Overall, I do love this place but please!!

My dad and sister had flown in from an early flight Saturday morning and we wanted somewhere nice to eat that was open early enough. Based on yelp reviews I was anxious we didn't have a reservation in a Saturday morning. But we arrived around 8 am and it was pretty empty, with only one other party there. It was very classy and small. There were only maybe 10-15 tables and a bar. Later I noticed a large curtain that opened and revealed more tables.The service was great! The waiters were very attentive and helpful. There's not really anything to complain about it. I ordered the waffles. And I was honestly very shocked by how much I enjoyed them! I didn't have high expectations because they're just waffles, but I was proven wrong. They were literally the best waffles I've ever had. Though I must say I don't usually order waffles, so that might have something to do with it. The waffles came in four small triangular pieces with berry butter. It was adorable. I can't speak for the others in my group because I didn't try their food unfortunately. I did want coffee but I didn't notice a coffee selection on their menu and I was embarrassed to ask about what different kinds they could make. But then again, I'm sure an avid coffee drinker would know exactly what they wanted. Even though I loved their pancakes, the portion was quite small for the price. From what I can remember, I was not full but they costed around 18-20 dollars. That was a bit of a let down. Although I could tell because it was a classier place they knew they could get away with higher prices. Also random note -- their restroom was difficult to get to.

I got a reservation on open table and was able to sit down immediately. Lexington Brass offers seating at both the bar and the regular dining room. It is best if you come in a smaller group, due to their size and how busy it gets they may struggle accommodating large parties.Lexington Brass offers a diverse range of options for breakfast. They have your typical omelets, oatmeals, yogurt, or more interesting fares such as the Avocado Toast.Every time I come here I get the same thing. I go with the Avocado Toast with a side order of chicken sausage. For the toast I get my egg poached and I highly recommend you do the same! When the yolk of the poached egg leaks onto the avocado it makes the bite taste out of this world. The portion of the toast is large as well so you will definitely be very full!The staff this time around were super friendly and very quick. We were greeted immediately by our waiter when we got seated and he promptly put in our orders. Our food arrived very quickly as well even though it was busy.The one downside of this place is that it is pricey.

The meatball appetizer was legit. The burratta appetizer was my least favorite of the appetizers. I've had many a burratta in my life, and this wasn't a good one. Three of us had the steak frites and one of us had a salad with steak.

4.0,2/21/2017,"My husband and I stayed in the adjoining hotel, so we ate here for brunch, dinner, and breakfast over the course of a few days. Brunch and breakfast were excellent, the french toast was amazing and the eggs were perfectly cooked (and I'm pretty picky with eggs). My husband loved the egg white omelet, and he's not usually an ""egg-white"" kind of guy. The oatmeal was tasty and a healthy option as well. It was always packed for breakfast/brunch but we never waited too long for the food and the atmosphere was fun.Dinner was not as fantastic. The ""catch of the day"" was just okay, and the carrots were so overly glazed they almost tasted like candy. I got the Caesar salad with chicken and it was pretty good, but almost the entire salad was made up of what I call the ""butts"" of the lettuce (the hard pieces at the very bottom of the leaves). There were also chopped scallions in it, which is odd for a Caesar salad. However, it was well-dressed and the chicken was really good. Another thing that struck me as weird was that the restaurant was practically empty (it was 5:30 pm), yet when a family with 2 small children came in, they sat them right next to us. A few minutes later, another family with small kids came in, and there were seated on the other side of us. The tables are very close together, so you're maybe 1-2 feet away. It was awkward and I'd think that if so much of the restaurant was free, you wouldn't surround a couple with loud families. At least a table or 2 away would've been nice.

Greeted by the bartender and got the menu. The selection was pretty good. It varied from eggs to waffles to avocado toast. I never had avocado toast and the ingredients for this one sounded good. We also got an Benedict royal and truffle fries. We split each dish so it was plenty of food for two. I couldn't stop saying how amazing the avocado toast was. The pomegranate seeds really added a good crunch, feta cheese added the salt, the radish another crunch, and the egg just tied everything together. I would go back for that for sure. We had the avocado toast on multigrain bread because they were out of the bread it came with. Benedict was good, not memorable but delicious.

3.0,12/27/2016,"I've been here twice and I've ordered their steel cut oatmeal twice and guess what? It was cold. Twice. Now, I understand that when you make steel cut oats this is probably something you cook a big vat of first thing in the morning and then you just scoop it out as needed throughout the day. But there comes a time when someone needs to step up and say, ""Hey guys? The oatmeal we're serving is cold. And not cold like 'Calm down, Goldilocks, everyone knows you're super-picky about the temperature of your oatmeal' cold, it's more like, 'Seriously? You're calling this *hot* cereal with a straight face?"" So, yeah, maybe they should look into a new method. But that said, once you've sent it back and waited 15 minutes for them to make some fresh for you, it's tasty and comes with many topping options like acai berry, coconut, flax, pomegranite, berries, walnuts, apple compote etc etc. Note: the acai berry comes in liquid form which I've never seen but maybe I just don't know much about acai berry? I'm willing to admit that. See how honest I am? That means the oatmeal must have really been cold. But it's good when they get it right. They also have a kale salad on the menu called ""The Best Kale Salad"" which looks decent but as a kale salad aficionado, I'm not sure it looked the best. The vegan burger however is on point. It's made with hearty ingredients including sweet potato that you can taste and it's served with sweet potato chips on the side - I'm sensing a theme. The staff is actually very kind and that is why I am giving them 3 stars instead of 2 for failing me both times with my oatmeal.

1.0,11/22/2016,"This was one of the most disappointing dining experiences I have had since I moved to NYC. I came here for my birthday and for a small party of 4, the waitstaff made us feel like more of an inconvenience than anything else. We were first seated in a booth and the banquet side of the table was sunken in so I felt that I was sitting in a hole. I asked to sit at a table that had 4 chairs. The hostess seated us, no problem, but the waiter who initially took our orders felt that he needed to tell us not once, but twice, that they don't open the tables up in the back until later. Like, okay, I get it, you like to crowd the front, but since I happen to be sitting here, please don't treat me like I am ruining your day. We ordered food--first apps- the mac and cheese and the meatballs were pretty good and reasonably priced. That was the extent. Halfway through the apps, a new waiter came over and said ""I'm taking care of your table now so if you need anything come find me."" Didn't say his name, no pleasantries, and he was another person who, for the rest of the evening, made it seem like every request was a huge imposition.Dinners--I think this food was just plain weird. Two in out party ordered the buttermilk chicken and it was soggy, greasy, and tasted like turmeric or curry or something that was not listed on the menu. Also, the pieces were all dark meat, which is hugely disappointing. At least give the diner the heads up that you're serving the dark meat pieces and let them choose for themselves. Nobody else at our table really raved about the food. The biscuits on all the tables were so bland and the rest of the meal was just greasy.

The last bar we ended up going to before going to our hotel was Lexington Brass. The drinks were yummy and the bartender stellar! The next morning I realized I had lost my driver's license which is a problem when you are getting on a plane in 2 days! I retraced all my steps including the LBrass bar. The GM in the morning shift went out of his way during the VERY busy Sunday morning brunch crowd to text all the staff who had worked the night before to see if they found it my license. Sadly, it was a ""no"" after much looking. The GM asked for my number in case they found it. I figured it was gone and then at midnight that night, I get a call on my cell from the night GM that they had my driver's license. A porter had found it sweeping and had given it to a chef! The chef turned it into the night GM. They then couldn't find  my number and went as far as googling me online. They ended up finding me after searching in the trash for the lost number.

I appreciated this because we just wanted to catch up. First ordered the tuna tartare tacos and I thought they were a joke. Sure presentation is important but what an itty bitty portion! It was basically 6 tiny potato chips shaped into a taco shell with the fillings on the side so you could add them in. Didn't have nearly enough flavor. I thought they were steep price wise and was concerned the rest of our meal would also be similarly teeny. So imagine my surprise when my chicken entree came out and was enormous, as was my friends veggie burger. The chicken was cooked well, teetering on over cooked, with a crispy skin and lots of lemon flavored quinoa. It was certainly the healthier option on the menu and I really enjoyed it (and left much more full).Towards the end of the night I felt they were sort of rushing us out as they repeatedly tried to take my friend's plate away, but eventually got the memo and let us take our time.

The server sort of attempts to clean the dress back with a cloth, but we end up just shrugging it off.The avocado toast, while it is listed under appetizers, in my opinion was more than enough for a hearty brunch meal. The pomegranates placed with the avocado was a great combination: it was a perfect balance of creamy and crunchy texture. The bread was a bit too hard for my liking, but it didn't bother me too much because the spread with everything on it was just too good.",1,0,1,Shelley W.,"Hoboken, NJ",159,65,200

The hash was burned and not very good. One egg was more of a soft-boiled consistency and didn't have a runny yolk. The grapefruit was great.

4.0,7/17/2016,"Gluten Free: YesCasein Free: YesLexington Brass provided a solid dinning experience. The bar is the main focal point in the main portion of the dinning area.  There are low top tables that line the windows that allow for people watching while you dine. The dinner menu offers a nice selection of reasonably priced items, especially for NYC. There are many options that are expense report  friendly. One of the best features of the menus, is that it is clearly listed if a dish is Gluten and/or Dairy free, as well as vegan. This restaurant offers a surprisingly high number for GF options. The ingredients used in the dishes were fresh. The execution though, seemed to be a bit hit and miss. The R.O.C for example, was inconsistent in taste and balance of flavors.  While generous in portions, 1/3 of the chicken was extremely moist and juicy. The rest, was dry and relied on the lemon-garlic sauce, which proved to be extremely acidic at times.If you want to eat at a specific time, I would highly recommend making reservations via OpenTable.

At 7AM, there must have been 2 other people there besides us. So, they were not busy. We got our coffee, waited 5 more mins to get milk.

4.0,4/5/2016,I walk past the Lexington brass. At least 4 times a week. This was my first time stopping in for brunch. It's located in midtown east by midtown financial district.  a few blocks away from grand central. While walking past I always notice the location is filled. I have read a lot of mixed reviews and that's why I have never stopped here to eat. I was quite surprised by the food. The first thing I forgot to make reservations. Which is a huge mistake on my part. If you eat here. Make reservations!! The location isn't that big and fills up quick for brunch. The staff was trying there best to get us to a table quick. The manager even came over and apologized. He was very nice. Came over to our table a few times while we were eating to ask how everything was. The breakfast/brunch menu is simple. It's not big maybe 10 items. I ended up ordering the traditional eggs Benedict. It was very good everything was cooked perfectly. The person I was with had ordered a brand new addition to the Menu for spring. It was stuffed French toast. I was told that the stuff French toast was extremely good. The chef actually came out and my friend had nothing but good things to say about the French toast. I got a side of bacon. The bacon is really good it comes from a farm that works direct ally with the Lexington brass. I think my fav thing about breakfast and brunch here is the coffee and tea is $5. It's good coffee and tea. They don't serve Lipton it's actual ground tea leaves. Refills are endless!!!Overall. I was very surprised by the food here. I thought it was very good and defiantly reasonably priced for being in the midtown financial district. If you are looking for a good brunch. I would recommend stopping here.

It was very cold out, but different hosts, hostesses and managers kept opening the front door and keeping it open with a door stopper.My dad was very upset about this. My 85 year old grandmother was freezing cold - she was SHIVERING. Even my 24 year old, warm blooded self was pretty damn cold. My dad spoke to our server and said that the entire table was frigid. The server said ""I'll see what I can do,"" and left.I waited a few minutes and the door was still open, our server no where to be found.My dad then stated, ""They're about to lose a 5 person reservation,"" stood up, and was ready to walk out. My parents started fighting about my dad being so dramatic, so I took matters into my own hands and simply closed the front door. I'm not sure why our server didn't do it himself or why it was open in the first place.30 minutes later, a hostess props open the door again. Cue everyone in our area staring at the hostess with murder eyes. Once she noticed about 20 angry people staring at her, she said ""Oh are you guys cold?"" and closed the door.

I had the steak frites and the steak was tender and the truffle fries were amazing. My bf had the baby back ribs and the meat just fell right off the bone.

2.0,1/8/2016,"I've been here twice, both for business meals.  The menu is good for mixed company and the food is delicious.  However, customer service is lacking.  Yesterday I had a 1 p.m. reservation for lunch with my boss and another executive.  When we arrived at 1 we were told our table wasn't ready yet.  Fifteen minutes later our table still wasn't ready so the host offered us a high-top table with bar stools.  Unfortunately we were pressed for time and the host couldn't tell us when we would be able to sit at a table so we sat at the high top which made an already awkward meal even more uncomfortable. The host never offered an apology and actually snapped at me when I politely reminded her that we had a reservation and I was disappointed in the table.  Throughout the meal (which, credit where credit's due, was very good) we constantly had to flag down our waiter who never introduced himself and at one point completely disappeared.  Perhaps if the wait staff improved they could turn over tables faster and honor their reservations.  Overall, this was very disappointing.  It was unacceptable behavior for any restaurant but especially for the price point and neighborhood and honestly put me in a very embarrassing spot since I was entertaining.",0,0,0,Madeline H.,"New York, NY",1,1,0

2.0,1/3/2016,"Gorgeous facility; moderately interesting menu; friendly service but woefully understaffed.  We stopped in for cocktails and snacks on Christmas night and the place was busy.  The bar was full with most of the patrons waiting for tables, so we were able to find a couple of bar stools after about 5 minutes.  There were two people behind the bar, but apparently only one of them could make cocktails and was trying to service the entire restaurant.  The other bartender was attentive and working the bar area well, but cocktails still took forever because only one person was making them and there was a big pile of tickets for the entire restaurant.  They both were working extremely hard but simply couldn't keep up -- management needs to schedule or staff much better.  Maybe it was just because it was Christmas, but it still was a problem.We tried the Tuna Tartare Tacos and were not-so-pleasantly surprised at what we received -- a tiny, tiny portion of tuna tartare with 3 small tortilla chips shaped like mini (1 inch) taco shells.  We chuckled and chalked it up to the place trying too hard for photogenic food.  We then tried to order the truffle fries but were told 5 minutes later that they were not available because the fryer was ""on the fritz"" -- even though we saw dishes being delivered to tables with fries as sides.  With all of the other options within a 10 minute walk, we'll likely not be back.",0,0,0,Aaron M.,"Laingsburg, MI",49,141,98

Meanwhile, the manager was nearby and said he thought they had what was needed ""down stairs"" a bar back went to check. They didn't have it, but Sawyer made a great chocolate drink and the bar back went to the kitchen and made a chocolate topping for the drink that was very good. We enjoyed our drinks, and I stepped to the rest room. When I got back, they'd brought my wife some fresh baked cookies ""to say thank you for her patience"". We had a second round.

We were told our table was ready so all of party went to our table ,with our last member still waiting for their drink.

Our waiter never stopped by to tell us of any delay or drinks while we waited. Finally after requesting our meals it was an hour 15 minutes . By this time half the restaurant was empty our food was hot and was tasty. One item which was an extra was not delivered. Again no waiter was seen walking by to ask anyone for service.

2.0,12/19/2015,"AWFUL SERVICE / NICE DECOR/ OVERPRICED FOR THE QUALITYI could not be more dissapointed with my experience at Lexington Brass. After checking out the lunch menu online, I made a 1:30 reservation for my wife and I. We get there and were told they arent serving ""lunch"" until 4:30. Lunch is not at 4:30. I dont care what city you're in or how late you're up. The brunch still had a couple of non-breakfast-type options, so we stuck around anyway. The decor is very nice, but the tables we sat along the window leave you so close to the strangers you're sitting next to, that it rules out any chance of a comfortable or intimate meal.Our waiter was a 30ish male. This is where the experience fell off a cliff.  In my 30 1/2 years of life, this was by far the worst service any waiter has ever given me. He was completely indifferent and ineffective. Its like he was either unwilling or afraid to do his job. After requesting two glasses of water and saying ""we just need a couple of minutes to look at the drink menu,"" he was nowhere to be found. I finally flagged him down 10 minutes later, so we could order drinks and a starter, as he wandered aimlessly. The beer selection was weak with only 3 or 4 craft beers on tap but I settled for a local IPA. It was solid. When our waiter came back with our drinks, we put in our food order. The wife ordered the $19 cheeseburger and I ordered the organic chicken. The cheeseburger came out with the bottom of the roll already soggy from the juices. She had to eat it with a knife and fork. Never a good thing. Other then that, the beef was good but the burger was worth $10 at most. Very basic flavors. Not much seasoning. The chicken was supposed to have crispy skin. It did not. Otherwise it was good. At this point, another beer would have hit the spot. Shame I didnt get to enjoy one because our server never returned once during the meal. Our waters were filled by a lady that looked like a manager. She also didnt ask if we would like to order another round of drinks. The couple next to us ordered a diet coke from our server at one point, and a few minutes later I saw him meandering over to another table when he still hadnt brought the drink back. We finished our meals and waited for our waiter to notice. He never did. Our plates were collected by a bus boy. Still no waiter. We put our coats on and sat there with nothing on the table. Nothing. Finally I got the attention of the female manager so that we could get the check and get the hell out of there. Bottom line, the decor is nice, the food is decent but way overpriced, and the service is an ABOMINATION. I still tipped 18% just for the off chance that our server was having a bad day, but I made sure to write a note on the receipt that the service was very poor.",0,0,0,Anthony L.,"Glenside, PA",109,22,9

I got the 8oz steak with regular fries instead of the truffle fries. The steak was good and was the perfect size. The fries were amazing.

1.0,10/2/2015,"The food and cocktails were delightful, however the service was not. I understand when you're at a diner just buying coffee, the host wants to rush you out when new people come in. But when you've purchased food and multiple drinks at $16 each, well, you can expect to hang out at least 10 minutes after your final sip. Having the host continuously approach your table with an annoyed face (but plaster on a super fake smile) and ask if you'd like anything else doesn't exactly make you feel welcome. And the two busboys looming over you as you're signing to a pre-installed tip doesn't help. Also didn't love having to creep around the busboys who swept in the moment I signed to grab my purse.

I ordered a coffee and the Pumpkin Spice Waffles; My boyfriend ordered a Revitalizer juice and the steak and eggs. The juice had a lot of ginger in it which is easy to do if you arent careful. The waffle was much bigger than anticipated! It was served on a cast iron skillet and came with fresh strawberries and blueberries, a bruleed banana and a pat of cinnamon butter. I was hoping for a more dominant pumpkin flavor and It was pretty chewy, but good overall. The steak and eggs came out just as ordered and included toast, preserves and a small mixed green salad.

The only negative was that all the other stuff on the bun made it almost impossible to pick the burger up to eat it without everything falling out. I easy overcame this by eating the burger with a knife and fork...but still. As for the truffle fries...yum.

Service was definitely not an issue for us that morning.We ordered the chicken and waffles. The portion was big. We got 3 big pieces of chicken. The fried chicken was tasty. I like white meat and their meat was moist. We also got the truffle fries with extra parmesean cheese, I liked them because it was nice and crispy. The lobster roll was unbelievably small and it tasted completely different then the typical mayo or butter ones. I liked it a lot but wished it was bigger.

The best I can say about our experience here is that we were seated quickly. Our server rarely visited us, even after having to ask twice for a beverage (the first...not a refill). The relatively bland food was delivered after an extensive wait. It took a very long time for our check to be delivered, which was probably for the best, as it gave time for the food to settle.

4.0,8/14/2015,"I'm shocked by all the negative reviews I'm reading about Lexington Brass online! My experience here was nothing but pleasant and tasty and I fully expect to come back and enjoy myself again.I came here with two co-workers for lunch at 1 pm and we were surrounded by suits with a similar idea. We work just down the street so I've always been tempted to try this place, especially since their lunch menu has such great diversity.Everything about our dining experience here was pleasant. We were seated right away at a table by the window and got cold water and drinks. My iced tea was perfectly sweet, but a bit pricey. I wasn't starving, but I couldn't resist getting an appetizer and a meal, so I ordered the faro bowl and the watermelon feta salad. The faro bowl was just as good as I expected it to be. With added avocado, the faro bowl was satisfying and not as dry as many wheat bowls are. The watermelon salad was underwhelming in size and a bit too lemon-y, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. My co-workers both got the avocado toast, which was more of a guacamole than avocado.Overall, I immensely enjoyed my experience at Lexington Brass.

I sat next to the window and my entire row complained about the same exact thing the service! I dined alone so I was able to pay attention to everything and I wish I had a distraction so my experience wouldn't have ruined my day! I had a couple who was sitting next to me whisper are you from here because we're from Texas and was wondering if the bad service is a ""New York"" thing.... I proudly claimed my NYC born and raised status and let them know that this was not a ""New York"" thing and there's so many restaurants here that will make you feel good for dining at their establishment but unfortunately Lexington Brass is not one of those places.Our server had a bad attitude the whole time I was there not only with customers but staff too! I seen him stomping away from the host, I seen other waiters picking up his slack and taking his orders because he was no where to be found and customers needed service. it was just a horrible experience and I'm upset I wasted my money here. The host knew this guy was a jerk I often seen her rolling her eyes and just sighing at his antics. seriously my whole row had complaints on this guy.The atmosphere of Lexington Brass is nice I like the décor which is why I wondered in. Its my bday week and I wanted to treat myself to a nice lunch and the looks of this place went with what I was looking for. The restaurant does have a snooty undertone to it and I'm wondering if that has to do with the lack of service or concern? The actual food which was the Croquet Monsieur came out cold and the fries would of been great if they was HOT! I love truffle fries and theirs tasted good as far as flavor and the pungent truffle aroma but like I said they was cold. I wanted to complain and have them reheat my food but the way my stomach was set up and my timing I just couldn't invest energy into that and the thought of possibly having to read my waiter to filth if he got out of line with me because he definitely seems like a out of line type of person was just too exhausting.As I was leaving the host asked my if everything was okay and if I enjoyed them. I advised her that the food would have been great if it was hot and the service really really sucked!!! immediately she asked me if my server was (forgot his name) and I said yes!

We were brought to a window side table which was good as we were out of towners.  Drinks were ordered which came out quickly, and with the direction of our server we decided on East Coast oysters.  The oysters were fresh and briny, and were a great choice! Seeing that Pat LaFrieda was the beef distributor, we decided on the Brass Burger and the Buttermilk Fried Chicken.  The burger was incredible and juicy, cooked to a perfect medium rare, and the chicken was crispy and flavorful, with creamy mashed potatoes.

1.0,3/21/2015,"Nice looking bar. In theory everything would have been fine.  The wife and I stopped by for a glass of wine. She ordered the Cava which after ordering they stated they were out of the brand she ordered. The bartender gave her a choice of the 2 other sparkling wines and said they would charge her the amount for the wine she originally wanted. Fine by us. Check came and he charged us for the actual cost of the wine which was $11 more per glass. I told him that he said it would be per the original ordered price of $12 a glad for the one she wanted but they were out of. He said he asked the manager and she said no, charge them actual. If he had said that from the beginning she may have made another choice. To me it was a bait and switch and totally unnecessary. $23 for a small glass of sparkling is steep even at NYC prices and this place doesn't honor their word.

It seems to be subcontracted out, just like this sad excuse for fine dinning.I ate here toward the end of my Thanksgiving stay (at the Hyatt 48 Lex) as I visited my elderly mom in Brooklyn, right before she fell sick into a Coma, a few months later.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ANYWAY 2 Stars for the BEER!The rest was either horrid, or not worth remembering....so still with just a BEER!!!",7,6,1,Paul M.,"Pismo Beach, CA",838,540,11530

4.0,2/10/2015,"9/10Food was great. Brunch food is tough because you can't WOW customers, but you can only disappoint diners. Little upside, big downside. I thought everything we got from the champagne brunch was fantastic. For this champagne brunch, let me tell you, I wish I had the money to do this every single weekend. First, the champagne was solid. It was not the cheap stuff. Bubbly and crisp, just the way I like it. They also give you fresh OJ and peach mixer for a bellini. You create your own drinks with your preferred ratios. Great!I also give this place a rating of 9 because of what I observed from the table next to me. One of the diners complained that her dish was undercooked. The waitress could have easily been disgruntled but she was very apologetic and brought the food back to the kitchen. After we were enjoying our meal for a bit, the other diner was waiting (like a gentleman) to eat his meal with his date. After a while, he asked if his dish could be reheated and brought out with her dish. The waitress was once again apologetic and gladly took his half eaten meal. As they were waiting, the couple ordered another round of drinks (wine), and the waitress promptly told them that they would be on the house and apologized once again. Soon thereafter, the table received both meals and the guy received a brand new meal. Even though this couple may have been a tad high maintenance, the waitress did not fuss over it, but rather approached the situation exactly how they should.

A man came to wrap up our food and my boyfriend and I clearly stated we wanted it all boxed up and he comes back with just 4 pieces of the fried chicken. He didn't wrap up our mashed potatoes, biscuit, or the truffle fries not to mention we barely touched either items so there is no reason as to why they would not wrap them up. The man also put both our chicken into one container not even separate ones like they should. We notified our server who brought us more fries but no mashed potatoes! We had to then ask for the potatoes AGAIN! However, I am very disappointed that the manager did not come to speak to us.

It was busy but not chaotic so we really didn't understand the extremely slow service.Our reservation was for 7:30, and we were seated right away by a bored-looking hostess. Our waiter came by to offer us water, which he brought. And that was the last we saw of him for 15 minutes while we waited for him to come back and take our order. After walking by our table many times and chatting it up with one particular table, we finally caught his eye to flag him down. After taking our order, it's another 15-20 minutes before someone else brings out the appetizer. At this point, almost an hour will have gone by before our actual entrees were brought out (by someone else) - still no appearance of our waiter except for his checking in with the one table where he knew the guest. When we were done our meal, we once again couldn't get his attention so we asked someone else to grab us a box for the leftovers. Even with a doggie bag on the table, he still didn't look over and come by to offer us dessert, coffee or the bill. We caught another waitress' eye and she brought over our bill - which ended up being the wrong one. To add to that, at this point the fire alarm had gone off for the second time in the 1.5 hrs we sat here for dinner.We finally got a hold of our actual waiter where we told him we got the wrong bill.

No one ever checked on us at any point--I waited over 15 minutes to ask someone for ketchup. I asked the guy that brought the food and he said it would come. After 5 minutes I asked another server to find our waitress. He returned and said she was coming. Nope, never did. When someone in our party got up to use the restroom, he saw our waitress eating at the bar and reading the paper!  Finally, the waiter of an adjacent table took mercy on us and asked us if we needed anything. Everyone else in my party was done eating their food and I had not even started because I had been waiting for some ketchup. This waiter finally brought it out. When we were done eating, our waitress came by with the check and just dropped it off. No comment whatsoever. She picked it up again and ran the credit card and then dropped it off at the table, promptly turning around and leaving. Nice. Really tainted my experience.

Our waiter was waiting on definitely way too many tables on his own. It took him forever to take the order, then forever to deliver drinks. It was all good since we were on vacation and reading through the reviews I expected 2 hours for brunch. Courses started coming and everything tasted a OK. Nothing really outstanding, there were eggs benedict, waffles and frittata. But wait, where was the 4th course? We sat around for a looooong time, then the waiter showed up with our checks. We asked about the 4th course and he was in huge surprise that we didn't get all of our food. He came back in a bit and asked if we were sure we didn't get it, since they crossed out the food as they delivered. Umm, REALLY???

The hostess asked our name under the reservation, we gave it. She said ok and walked away. She came back and asked our name again. Huh? We were seated and I ordered a soda. Our waitress returns and places the soda in front of my friend across from me. Much later in the meal she finally comes by again and I ask for a refill. She refills and comes back and places it again in front of my friend. Huh? Just little things like this the whole meal, definitely not a smooth operation. As for the food, the chicken barley soup was really bland. The shrimp and cous cous was also bland and only came with 4 small shrimp for $21, pricey and stingy.

3.0,11/30/2014,"Since it is late November and it is cold to be walking too much for food, I ended at Brass, which happened to be right across the street from my hotel (The Lexington). The place looks nice and since we have our 4 y/o niece with us, sound like the perfect place for brunch on a cold frosty Saturday noon. To be really honest, this place has everything to be the perfect breakfast-brunch place, at least in lower mid-town, the only thing is the execution. If they can perfect that, they will be thrilling, trust me.Let's start with the hostess. There were 2 hostess (for what I could see) on that particular Saturday, but seem to have some kind of communication disruption in between them. One of them told us to wait while the other one wanted to give us a table right away and then they kind of argue to each other (in front of us, the customer... got the point?) Ok... enough... let's bypass that little 'incident' with the hostesses and go to the restaurant itself.The brunch menu is kind of standard but it is vast enough to get a meal for anyone, pretty much. The only thing I have to point, is the fact they do not have any full plate, like french toast or pancakes eggs and bacon. You have to order them separated, and will cost you around $32, but I have to say, the triple cut maple caramelized bacon was fantastic and really abundant. If you order that bacon ""side order"" as they presented it in the menu, you can feed at least 2 (may be 3) persons. If you look it that way, you will get to the conclusion, the price is absolutely right, so do not start with me, please, when I say the price you pay is fair enough  (I'm very used to get nasty emails from people for saying this kind of things. Guys this is Manhattan, lower mid-town, Lexington ave, pretty close to grand central and the fashion district, you expect something fancy and cheap? DREAM ON !!!).My wife and my niece order burgers. I will overlook the fact, my wife ordered a bacon-burger and it came with no bacon, but they fixed the problem almost immediately by bringing 3 strips of crispy, fresh, already grilled bacon. The temperatures on the burgers were perfect, exactly what we ordered. I only give this place 3 stars due to the execution. Technically we have to wait to get seated (when there were seats available and the two hostess ""fought"" about getting us seated right away) and then the amount of time we waited for our food. As we could see, the hostess had a reason for not seating us immediately. Or they have some lack of personnel in the kitchen or they are really slow in that area. From the moment we ordered the food till we got served it was 35 minutes. I was able to identify the people who were seated there before us and I realized they were serving one table at a time, once a particular table was served, they moved to the next one, that way, 35 minutes later it was our turn. As you may understand this is kind of unacceptable, especially for a place of this characteristics, location, menu and price. So, if you can overlook the fact you will be waiting a long time for your food, I will recommend this place for breakfast or brunch. But if you are in the need of a quick, good breakfast before going to the office, avoid this place at all means, our you will be arriving late to work.... cheers !!!",2,0,0,Rudy J.

The iron steak came with bulb of roasted garlic, the kind that you squeeze out yourself and then get rewarded with delicious candy like goodness. The salad dressing actually dressed the salad instead of drowning it. Brussels sprouts were a special tonight so we chose them in a side and it was dish well done.

You need to use the elevators to go downstairs to use the restroom and it takes forever to come.Food:  Ordered baked egg avocado blue crab salad. Salad was very blahhh. No  much taste aside from the egg itself and the crab.  It needs salt and some type of dressing.  The avocado was fresh at least.  However, the crab salad was poorly designed. It was too simple and boring.  The taste did not go well with the egg.   The dish, itself, was poorly design and tasted very poorly.  It looked good though. The portion was too small for brunch. That was more like a tapa style dishes. So I personally think it was overpriced for lunch for sure. 1.5/5Service:  The waiter was serving over 4 tables. He was trying his best to keep us content by checking on us and refilling our water.  Overall, he was a good waiter but I do wish he knew the menu in more details.   3.5/5Atmosphere: iAside from the poor design of the bathroom, I think they couldnt do anything about it.  The atmosphere seems to be very chill and classy.  It looked big from the outside, but the inside can barely sit no more than 50 -60 people.    3/5",2,0,0,Michael W.,"Orlando, FL",158,212,466

The management team does a great job with letting their employees socialize with the guests. One of the managers named Kiwi really encourages her team to interact with the guests which makes everyone feel a little more comfortable. Sawyer and Brett were two more servers who served us and both of them did an awesome job also!

The plates were two different types of frittata, salmon Benedict, Croque Monsieur, and some waffles to close it out. All I have to say is fresh, fresh, fresh! The juices were freshly squeezed, the frittata had extremely fresh vegetables, the salmon was on point, and the berries on our waffles were above par. It was a good serving size for two but I would even recommend three people to share this meal. The ambience is pretty chill, reminiscent of a speakeasy.

Also the place was 100% empty and the hostess put us in the back next to the server station where we got to listen to the servers chat about their tables while one of them treated us to deep hacking coughs over our table. To our disappointment they don't service liquor until noon, which I guess is a NYC law? Serves me right for brunching in Brooklyn usually. I got the chicken and waffles since it was one of the more inventive menu items.

The ""caviar"" that came on it was such a minuscule amount, it would have been better if there was a touch more. Honestly, I could have made it better myself at home. My friends had the chicken and waffles which they said was good and it was a huge portion. Our waiter, Brian, was horrible. My friends asked for more syrup that came with their food, but didn't know it was honey butter, so they asked for more of what they had and he seemed SO bothered that he had to go get it that he pretty much ignored us after that the entire time. Everyone around us was being attended to by him except for us. Maybe it was because they were ordering more drinks and we were not (my vodka dirty martini at 16 was pretty basic and not worth it) however, we had come to have a good time and ended up not ordering more drinks because of the poor service.

My bf started off by ordering Johnny black on the rocks (the drink he always gets) so when the drink came and it didn't smell nor taste like black, he called it out to the waiter. This particular waiter was nice about it and brought it back to the bartender who wouldn't admit to pouring the wrong liquor. Instead he made up an excuse of reusing a mixer that already had some other alcohol leftover. Uhh except its black straight so you don't need a mixer?!Somehow another tall waiter took over our table. He started pouring water from the glass bottle and my friend noticed a drenched, big dead fly on the tip of the bottle. Disgusting. I tried to remain positive and told my friends to stop being so dramatic so we ordered our dishes. 40 mins later some of our food arrived, but the asparagus we ordered never came. The waiter was giving attitude and never once came to refill our water again nor check that we had gotten everything. I guess my friends were right to complain.Apparently the manager was around and was alerted of our situation but didn't comp any dishes or drinks or even apologize.We left without leaving a tip because no one deserved it.

We were going in for the day from CT and needed somewhere close to the train. It's a very short walk, maybe 5 minutes. The service was okay. The manager was openly rude in front of us to a server calling in that they were going to be late, so that wasn't a great first impression. As soon as he hung up the phone, he was as sweet as pie to us. So, a bit fake. We had two servers--one young blonde woman that was SO nice and attentive and one young guy that took care of us later that seemed annoyed with everything and was quite rude. The food we ordered (coffee, chicken and waffles, chicken sausage, beer waffles and truffle fries) was tasty and just the right portions were served so we didn't leave feeling gross. The make-your-own bloody mary was a nice surprise and it was fun to fill out the card and personalize it. Cost-wise, it would have been less if we didn't opt for the bloody marys with top shelf vodka and add-ons like bacon and oysters (worth it!). But in the end, we spent about $115 with tax and tip. The drinks were maybe $30 of that.  My only two concerns were that the tables were too close together (I don't want to eat in someone else's lap!) and the bathrooms were in the basement of the hotel that's adjacent to the restaurant, so you had to go to the lobby, down an elevator and through a hallway to get to them.

4.0,4/12/2014,"This place may not be the most inventive in terms of it's dishes but it's good. Really good. Hubby and I went here for brunch today and left beyond satisfied and full! Strangely enough, we've probably walked by this place countless times and never noticed it.  Not because it's unnoticeable but likely because the entire storefront is windowed allowing you to see right through it. From the inside these windows help create an outdoor experience without having to bear the elements (only necessary when the weather isn't as gorgeous as it was today)! So onto the dishes. Here's what we had and how we liked it. Parmesan Truffle Fries: perfectly truffled. Didn't make us want to forgo truffle for the next few weeks because of an overpowering taste. Brioche French Toast: I'm not a French toast person for the most part but the lemon butter and sliced grapefruit and oranges created an amazingly intense citrus flavor that complemented the sweetness of the syrup baked into the brioche very nicely. Would try again although honestly next time we might go for the super fluffy pancakes we saw the waiters bringing out! Sausage and Pepper Omelette: we substituted the sausage for chicken sausage instead and loved it! Fluffy fluffy eggs with Gruyere and broccoli and peppers blended together perfectly and I didn't even need to sprinkle any salt on it! Lastly we had the French press coffee which was exactly what we needed to wake us up before enjoying our brunch and day! I will say while he ambiance and food were worthy of a second visit - the waitstaff needs to take a lesson or two in etiquette. Our waiter never greeted us.

4.0,3/19/2014,"Lexington Brass is more known for brunch than dinner, but the dinner is spot on as well. I came here with a couple of girlfriends to share some plates and catch up on life. It was a Tuesday, so it was pretty quiet. Not to say it was quiet - there were people here and there at tables, but it wasn't packed and it was pretty easy to get a table without a reservation. Service was quick and easy. Our server was adorable and super nice, despite our asking many questions about the specifics of the dishes we were contemplating. They were a tad bit slow in refilling waters, but luckily I was downing cocktails, so it wasn't too big of an issue.We ordered the following:Grilled octopusBrussels sprouts (without the bacon)Cheese beignetsMac and cheeseTuna tartare tacosThe standouts were the cheese beignets and tuna tartare tacos. The tuna was fresh, guacamole was tasty and nicely spiced, and the chili aioli was a nice touch. I personally could have used some more heat, but I think I'm just a spice addict. The cheese beignets were addictive. We almost ordered another round and had to stop ourselves from gorging in order to save room for dessert.Grilled octopus was good but not outstanding, and I liked the mac and cheese, but it wasn't anything special. I was a bit disappointed in the brussels sprouts. It's probably just a different preparation than I'm used to, but I really love the nutty taste of roasted brussels sprouts. The mustard was a bit overwhelming in this dish.For cocktails, I highly recommend the cucumber cooler if you want something refreshing. Not terribly inventive, but always a crowdpleaser. I was between the Fire Cracker and Heat Wave (can you tell I like spicy? haha), and ended up with the Heat Wave, which was basically a delicious spicy margarita. YUM.For dessert, we ordered the trifle, which was...interesting. I don't know if I loved it, but it was definitely creative and inspired. I also took home some cookies to share while watching movies. Delish!All in all, I would rate this a 3.5. I don't think it's a must-try restaurant, but definitely a solid and reliable standby.

Over brunch you can design your own Bloody Mary and the cocktails at dinner time are truly potent. I wasn't too impressed with the truffles fries ... Really skinny fries, but not enough truffle, but the food in general is delicious! One thing: the toilet is not on the same level and one needs to take the lift to a mysterious place labeled SC!

2.0,11/25/2013,"I had a hard time deciding how to rate Lexington Brass.  The location is excellent, the decoration (american bistro style) is nice and they probably have the best brunch deal in midtown Manhattan -- $89 for a party of four, including some of their most popular dishes and a bottle of Cava with three different juices.  In addition, their ""make your own Bloody Mary"" menu is fantastic and you can't go wrong with your choices.However, it is decidedly amateur hour at the Lexington Brass.  I wish I knew our server's name because I would commend him.  Except for our waiter, everyone else from the host / hostess and bartender to the busboys were clueless. The hostess had forgotten we had checked in and would have left us waiting at the bar past the 20 minutes we had already waited if I hadn't asked about our table.  The bartender would not bother to clean up after the people who had left the stools and just left us there, sitting in front of a pile of soiled linen, dirty napkins and bloody mary glass marks. He was more concerned with looking at himself on the mirror than looking after his clients.  And the busboys seemed straight out of a circus, crossing each other over setting and retrieving our plates.  Lexington Brass has a lot of potential, but they need to put the right management in place and live up to higher standards.",1,0,0,Eduardo H.,"Hollywood, FL",92,36,13

She loves the afternoon bartender James and the unparalleled kale salad. I popped in on a Saturday night...tonight! I entered and never realized that this was part of the famed EMM Group, that opened and run other places like CATCH in the meat packing district, The General on Bowery (which btw has amazing sushi!). I learned this when the mgr, Cleo, popped by to see if everything was okay. And the best part is that JAMES was working! He IS amazing and so is his barback-tender, Walter, who was making sure we were good the entire time! I felt taken care of, invited into a chill zone (figuratively- b/c outside is literally!) and it made me a slight bit jealous that my friend gets to pop in here after work and I don't haha!If you live in the area you should stop by at least once!

We were greeted by the host/ manager, not quite sure, but she was nice and sat us right away as the place wasn't too busy. We waited a few minutes before the server finally greeted us, couldn't tell you his name cause he never told it to us. But he also seemed to be the bartender. He brings us our drinks and takes our order. I order the waffles and the pancakes with everything on the side for my girlfriend. I think we wait for a good 20 minutes or so before the food is brought out. Out of the corner of my eye, I see the food runner bringing out the food but stopped by the server. Our items were being delivered incorrectly, all of the toppings were still on top and not on the side as ordered. So I'm like, ok brownie point for the server. So I'm thinking he'll come over and say something as he noticed that I saw what had just happened. Nope, not a word. The food runner comes back out in 2 mins. First thing I do is check the pancakes, they had scraped everything off and flipped things over. I had to call someone else to get our server. He apologizes and takes the pancakes away. Then I start to check the waffles, they were burned...The host/ manager lady comes back out.

3.0,11/3/2013,"3.5 stars. Summary: Food was tasty, but menu was a bit generic, and overall the restaurant was pricier than what it could have been. Had mostly a finance happy hour bar feel.Lexington Brass is one of those restaurants that doesn't really do anything wrong, but is priced in a way that makes you feel like you're paying about 15% too much for what you get. The food itself was solid, but nothing on the menu really stuck out for being super unique. It's mostly an all-American menu, but they're able to execute on the dishes well.They had an interesting cocktail menu, but again these felt priced at the level of some of the most exclusive speakeasies in NYC, but were mostly of average quality. This is probably also why the place was packed with businessmen at what was obviously a corporate happy hour when we arrived. That type of happy hour really personifies the overall atmosphere of the place.Service was great, and the location is pretty convenient.

2.0,10/21/2013,"I have been here at least a dozen times in the past year. The food and the service are typically great. Tonight I experienced such disappointing service that I felt compelled to write a review as soon as I got back to my room.Of all the times to experience bad service, I had a client with me who had just traveled from overseas for 20 hours. I chose this spot because it has always been a go-to spot for quality, eclectic food- and no hassles.We had a reservation and were sat pretty promptly.  There were 2 of us and we shared 2 appetizers and each had an entree. This took 2 and a half painfully slow hours. I was mortified as I knew my client was exhausted. Our server was James and he was MIA most of the time. Took a while for him to take our order, even longer for our apps to come out (they were luke warm by the way- so I know they sat in the window). Then there was a super long gap until our entrees came out. When they finally did they too were luke warm. My steak was well done (I ordered medium) and no one ever came over to check on us once they dropped off our entrees. Our water glasses were empty. We had originally planned on dessert but it got way too late. I finally got up and walked to the hostess stand and asked if we could get our check, and I mentioned that I had not seen our waiter in a while.We waited an additional 10 minutes and the check finally came.  I left a $10 tip which was 10% - that was generous. We got no apology or even acknowledgement that things took so long. I don't know if the waiter is clueless, or just taking a lot of breaks, or what, but there was no one around to even flag down when you needed somehting. Maybe because it was monday night, maybe there was no manager, who knows...but they were really slacking off tonight!The appetizers were great- pot of mussels and the lobster w/ rice noodles. Wish they had been served hotter. My client had the scallops and she liked them- but they weren't hot. I had steak frites (overcooked). This is served with truffle fries which are normally delicous, but again, they were not hot.I will probably go back there because it is across the street from where I stay weekly for work- but just really disappointed in the lackluster service tonight.

2.0,7/28/2013,"A group of 8 of us chose to eat at Lexington Brass and cancel our reservations at Catch (the same owners). This was a mistake, as the food, service and atmosphere was disappointing. I find this to be extremely odd as I have eaten at the two other restaurants with the same owners and had amazing food and experiences (Catch + Abe and Arthurs). The restaurant had three other tables occupied and for such a spacious restaurant you would expect there to be somewhat of an ambiance, sadly there was none. Furthermore, I ordered a glass a red wine and it was awful. I ordered 4 oysters only because they were charging 3 dollars an oysters. I do agree that these amazing aphrodisiac require a lot of maintenance and preparation to serve, however, at home I buy oysters for a dollar each. The 4 I did try were great, and had my favorite sauces that accompanied them ( mignonette sauce, cocktail sauce and lastly my personal favorite, grated horseradish). I then ordered the Vegetable salad as I was told it was small because I was planning on sharing fish with my friend and didn't want to order too much food. The salad was not small at all ( a plus for a $10 salad) however the salad itself was nothing I expected. The menu read, Vegetable salad: tomatoes, hearts of palms and olives. I requested no olives which they followed. Yet the hearts of palms were hard as a rock, which everyone knows is not the kind you want to eat. An overabundance of lettuce and a lack of dressing. Overall, the salad was a let down. Lastly for my main course,  I shared the cod which was extremely salty.

There is nothing remotely inviting about it, although things improve somewhat once you enter and see a brasserie cafe set-up with a large dominant bar (photo: bit.ly/12epSXz). Jamie W. and I came here because the idea of a Croque Madame sounded pretty good for a Sunday morning before heading into Central Park. Even on  the so-called day of rest, there were still power breakfasts in play as we were squeezed onto the banquette where we had to move our twofer table in and out for me to enter and exit. It was hard not to eavesdrop on the neighboring conversations.Unfortunately there wasn't much of interest to roll my eyes about. The breakfast menu is pretty much regulation for a place of this ilk (photo: bit.ly/1180Le0).

He was hoping for a deeper pumpkin flavor with every bite, but we think they took a few shakes of the McCormick pumpkin spice and were done with it. Bland and not worth the extra calories. As I stated, I went for the $16 Croque Monsieur with the $3 Fried Egg on top, which they refused to call a Croque Madame.For an upscale joint like this, I found it surprisingly greasy with little effort in sopping up the excess oil in the cast iron pan that served as the plate (photo: bit.ly/14GAGzm). It had the requisite ingredients - baked, ham, Gruyère cheese - as well as some chopped jalapeño to give it a much needed bite. The egg was well turned and the brioche was thick though overly saturated with butter. The side salad was a nice contrast though oddly placed in the cast iron (photo: bit.ly/19KOYGk). Meanwhile, I was sipping my coffee (photo: bit.ly/15VmuSz) hoping a power couple would sit next to us negotiating a big acquisition. But no, it was a couple complaining about their hotel room at the Waldorf-Astoria.FOOD - 2 stars...disappointing breakfast fare for such an upscale placeAMBIANCE - 3 stars...power suit convention masquerading as a French-style brasserieSERVICE - 3 stars...rather clippedTOTAL - 2 stars...probably should go back to Pershing Square for this type of power suit spot but it was Sunday for Pete's sake",8,5,5,Ed U.,"San Francisco, CA",4521,4629,37977
4.0,6/4/2013,"We had a gilt city coupon which was confusing at first to our waiter and the hostess, but resolved quickly and pleasantly.  Our service improved immediately when our waiter was replaced by someone with more experience.  Drinks were a little slow to arrive, even though there were very few diners.  Music was a bit loud at first, but maybe toned down as more diners arrived.Food was excellent - I had the duck/beet salad, which was actual duck confit (exactlyl as the waiter described), and my friend had the fried baby artichoke salad - also excellent.  Fried chicken was cooked perfectly, crisp on the outside, and moist on the inside - and not oversalted.  The swiss chard and mashed potato sides were great accompaniments.  Cheeseburger with avocado was also perfectly cooked and the truffle fries were crisp, fresh and abundant!  Cherry cobbler with ice cream was also very good.Not sure if I would pay 27 for fried chicken without my coupon, but I would definitely return to try something else on the menu - which is not always the case when you purchase a promotion!",1,0,0,Hui C.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",0,16,1

4.0,4/9/2013,"On Easter Sunday, BF and I had brunch with a couple of friends at Lexington Brass. With all the restaurants in NYC, I doubt we ever would have made our way over to Lexington Brass if not for a Bloomspot deal. The deal we had featured brunch for four and you had a choice of five entrees, two sides, along with a bottle of sparkling white wine & mixers. We didn't realize that the deal was for 12-3pm and made reservations for 11am. Our waitress explained to us that NYC Blue Laws prohibit the consumption of alcohol in restaurants before 12 noon on Sundays.. WHAT?! NYC still has Blue Laws?!(foodrepublic.com/2012/05…) Fortunately, she was super nice about it and told us that she would get us started on our meal while we waited for the clock to strike noon.The meal that we were served was slightly different from advertised on Bloomspot. Rather than allowing us a choice of five entrees, we were served their featured Champagne Brunch which is a six-course chef selection family-style tasting menu. The regular menu price is $85 for four (we paid $65 for the Bloomspot deal). This wasn't a big deal since we didn't notice the difference at the time and there was PLENTY of food but we did lose out on an additional entree and we probably would not have chosen the frittata as one of them.Anyways, onto the food..Jelly donuts - This was an order of 5 jelly-filled donut holes. None of us are normally fans of jelly donuts but we all said that these were pretty good. Freshly fried, filled and sugared.. these were warm and tasty.Brass ale beer waffles with bruleed bananas, fresh berries & cinnamon butter - These waffles were light and crispy just the way Belgian waffles should be. I liked that they weren't skimpy with the fresh berries- strawberries, blackberries, raspberries and blueberries. The bananas were sliced and topped with a dusting of sugar and then bruleed to give it some light caramelization. I liked the cinnamon butter and syrup that accompanied the dish. Not sure what kind of syrup it was but I liked that it didn't have a strong, overpowering maple flavor.Buttermilk pancakes with lemon butter & fresh berries - Another dish that was super generous with the fresh berries! These pancakes were on steroids! They were bulging in the middle with a perfectly formed outer crust. The texture was atypical of any buttermilk pancakes I've ever had and reminded me of a lighter, fluffier version of grilled corn cakes. The butter had just a touch of lemon flavor which I thought went well with the berries. This was probably my favorite dish of the meal.Benedict Royale with smoked salmon & caviar - Not sure if I've ever mentioned this but I'm not a huge fan of eggs.. That being said, imagine a perfectly poached egg atop a generous amount of smoked salmon, a perfectly toasted English muffin, a dollop of Hollandaise sauce and a sprinkling of caviar. If you like eggs benedict and you like smoked salmon, this was an excellent rendition of a classic dish. I liked that they used high quality smoked salmon.Sun-dried tomato & feta cheese frittata - Again, not a fan of eggs so I only had a small bite. I thought the feta cheese might be a tad too strong but it was actually quite mild. I didn't taste the sun-dried tomatoes. This was everyone's least favorite dish but that might have been because it was the last dish served and we were all stuffed!Truffle fries - The fries were crispy with a touch of Parmesan cheese and a drizzle of truffle oil. Not the best truffle fries I've ever had but still decent.Sparkling wine & mixers - At 12 noon, we were served a chilled bottle of sparkling wine with small carafes of peach nectar, cranberry-pomegranate juice, and OJ. The peach nectar was my favorite. It was nice and sweet and made a great bellini!We also ordered the 4-cup French press coffee for the table. Lexington Brass serves Stumptown coffee, a roaster known for their use of high quality coffee beans. Please note that 4-cups actually means four 8oz cups or 32oz total! All in all, Lexington Brass serves an excellent brunch in a comfortable, low-key atmosphere. The decor has a Mad Men vintage feel to it and even though the place was packed by the time we finished our meal, it didn't feel overly noisy or crowded. I would highly recommend it and would def come back again. Tip: The six-course Champagne brunch is a bargain considering all the food you get, in addition to the booze. The four-person brunch can easily feed 5 ppl.",8,1,3,Sharon L.,"Flushing, NY",26,87,180

The buttermilk fried chicken and kale salad were some of my favorites although the kale salad was a little heavy on the salt. The raw bar tower was super fresh. The lobster mac & cheese was good, but not worth having the lobster in it since the mac & cheese overpowers it.

The fried chicken was great but it was thrown in this iron skillet and served. The presentation was sloppy. The downfalls were minor as overall the food was delicious.

4.0,4/2/2013,"So I bought a Bloomspot deal for $65 for a tasting brunch for 4 including a bottle of sparkling wine--I mean you can't beat that price, especially when the reviews looked good! I booked it for a day that I didn't realize was the same day as the St. Paddy's parade--until we were all delayed by traffic, blocked roads, etc. To add to that it was snowing! Well one of the girls was on time, but the rest of us not so much--so I called to push back the reservation & they were very accommodating. When I got there I joined my friend at the bar & we sat there taking up space & just drinking water as we waited for our other 2 friends. Hostess & bartender were both very nice, and the place had a cheery & spacious feel to it. When our 3rd friend got there we finally decided to get the table & at least start drinking while waiting for the last person. The sparkling wine was accompanied by 3 little carafes of fruit juice mix-ins (peach-strawberry was the best) which was great. Our 4th person was super late because it was so impossible to find parking, and in the meantime some friends showed up unexpectedly & pulled up chairs just to chat. I felt bad for our waiter, I'm sure it was confusing & aggravating but he was SO friendly & sweet. Anyway we were starving by the time the last person arrived, but we were not prepared for how much food they brought out! They brought us both sweet & savory--jelly-filled doughnut holes (hot & fresh, mmm), waffles, pancakes, truffle fries (YUM), salmon eggs benedict (good), a frittata...wow we could not even finish it. Our poor waiter had to switch off with another waiter midway because his shift had ended--yeah that's how long it took to get ourselves together, just chaos! Well we had a great time anyway what with the great company & ample food & wine, despite the miserable weather & other hassles. Oh and at the end I realized my wine-addled brain had miscalculated tax + tip, and so they had to get a manager to void that out & re-do the transaction--he did so without argument or complaint. I was thinking they must have thought we were such a nightmare, but you'd never know it since they were all so very nice. I was very impressed by the service & would definitely go back!The only weird thing was to go to the bathroom you have to go through a curtain into the hotel & then take an elevator down to the basement--but at least it was nice & clean, so I didn't mind much.",0,0,0,Ipsita D.,"Union City, NJ",2,79,33

4.0,3/19/2013,This is a great option in a neighbourhood that lacks a soul. Lexington Brass is a very welcome addition and clearly sets itself apart from the classic steakhouse around that cater to the bankers' crowd. Not that I have anything against bankers or steakhouses but sometimes too much is just ... too much!So back to Lex Brass: great spot with a lot of light. Decor is contemporary without being overtly trendy. The menu is fairly short but very well executed. It's modern American with some interesting creative flair. Tuna tartare tacos are great and so are the salmon burger or their excellent and decadent cheese burger (add some bacon if you want!). For lighter option the Nicoise is just what you want with super fresh tuna that is cooked to perfection (read medium rare). Although I am not too much into dessert they are pretty good I must say. Good cocktails too with a knowledgeable bar staff.Prices are in line with the neighbourhood but definitely it's a notch above the surrounding options.

The cheese is spread on like cream cheese throughout the whole omelet.  We got a side of truffle fries which you cannot go wrong with, just order them, always.  My dad had the frittata with chicken and roasted peppers, it was done perfectly and was very tasty.  The frittata was a huge serving and could definitely be shared.  Service was a little slow and nothing special which is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars.  Ambiance is classy and relaxed.  I will be back for brunch and drinks again.",0,0,0,Jamie S.,"Manhattan, NY",3,48,2

4.0,2/7/2013,"We had the most delightful time here for brunch showering babies or baby shower as you normal people call it. We had a deal voucher and it was a 6 course meal with champagne. You accommodated our 6 person party and did not protest when it became 7. You started us off with peach juice, orange juice and pomegranate juice which we mixed with the champagne to make our own bellinis, mimosas and vampire specials. We had the fried doughnuts which were nice and sugary and sweet but resembled donut holes. I would say I liked the doughnuts a lot. Then came the french toast with fresh fruit and pancake/corncake looking item with fresh fruit- mostly berries and peach pieces. The pancake was very fluffy and refreshing. The french toast had nice flavor and a nice crispy edge and didn't fall apart like soggy wet messes once you pour on the syrup like when you go to other places.We were also served with frittatas and croque monsieur but by that time I was overly full. The frittata was good and the croque monsieur looked like finger sandwiches that you get at afternoon tea but with melted cheese of course. The eggs benedict came next with the nice runny yolk that always makes me think of  the moon crying. They substituted the salmon with ham which slightly disappointed me because i was looking forward to the salmon but then again they were accommodating our friend who was with child and could not have raw fish.  In addition to all this we were given truffle fries and we all made room for the crispy fragrant fries. 100x better than McDonalds fries believe you me.The view on lexington was fantastic the room had a nice airy feel and quality to it because of all of the natural light coming in. Its nestled next to all of these fancy hotels and you can see a lot of limos pulling up all of the time. I would return here again for brunch because of the good service and the good portions and if I was in the area and wanted to go to a not shabby place. The only strange thing is having to take an elevator to the bathroom located on level SC. But it is just one flight down so no biggie.

4.0,1/7/2013,"During our trip to NYC, we ate here for 1 breakfast, 1 lunch, and 1 dinner.  Overall the service was great, the food was delicious, and there was great creativity in the menu.Although you will find plenty of business types and suits here, it is still casual enough for tourists to enjoy (and we did).  Of the three meals we had, dinner was probably the best - mostly likely due to the cocktails (and we tried many).  Service at dinner was average (while the other two meals it was superb).  The French Onion soup was huge, flavorful and nearly comprised a full meal!  The deserts were outstanding as well.  The jelly doughnuts made in the morning were equally deserving of a shout out!  Every dish we had was tasty and worthy of a return trip.  This place is bit pricy, so it is more of a treat.  The support staff were great all three meals, constantly filling waters, removing dishes, etc.,  The atmosphere was great too.  All in all I would certainly return.  There are a few items on the menu that I still want to try.",2,0,1,William L.,"Chicago, IL",154,162,220
4.0,1/5/2013,"What a pleasant surprise! After reading so many mixed reviews on this place, I was a bit worried at first, but it ended up being a great night! I came here with five of my girlfriends to celebrate my birthday on a Friday night. The place is a lot smaller than I expected inside but our table for 6 was comfortable and the ambiance was nice. Service was friendly and attentive and the food was very good.To start we had the mac and cheese and the fried bay scallops. The mac and cheese was a bit dry and mild, but the bay scallops were delicious and served with a yummy buffalo sauce for a twist. For entrees we had the fried chicken, steak frites, tuna burger, duck and foie tortellini (starter), and pork buns (starter). The fried chicken was tasty and a huge portion. Might be good to split between two people if you don't have a huge appetite. The honey butter sauce was delicious as well. The duck and foie tortellini were also quite good with a tasty sauce. The pork buns were a mix of sweet and spicy and good to try. We did make room for dessert and they brought out a candle on one of them which was nice. The ice cream cake was to die for and you have to try that! The creme brulee was delicious as well, but the cream puffs were on the drier side. Our coffees were all brought to us cold, but when we mentioned this to the staff they brought us new ones and comped us for all of them, which was nice. Overall it was a great experience and I would definitely recommend dinner here. I am glad we chose it for my birthday celebration for sure!",0,0,0,Cynthia M.,"Manhattan, NY",351,1226,25
5.0,1/2/2013,"new york is full of unexpected surprises.. and here's another one! lexington brass has, hands down, THE BEST FRENCH ONION SOUP, and this is coming from a FOS addict. the broth is thicker than your average base, the onions are simmered perfectly, mouthwatering gruyere cheese gushes over the sides and is perfectly burned on the top, and the dense bread is ideal for soaking up the broth. what really makes this soup so special, however, is that they add sherry to the base. i know, i know alcohol makes everything better. the way the onions pick up that sweet sherry flavor makes it so unique and absolutely outstanding. it is served in a huge crock and definitely is a meal in and of itself ($12).EMM owns lexington brass (think catch and abe & arthur's) so there's your scene give or take some tourists and midtowners. i've tried a bunch of other dishes on the menu and they are good, but now i just come here for the soup. it is colddddd out there new yorkers, this is definitely the way to warm up (you know, foodwise).;)",1,0,1,Amie R.,"Manhattan, NY",340,103,62

4.0,12/17/2012,"A very close 4 star, but not quite yet!I definitely enjoyed brunch there, though I thought some things could have been better executed. The first order of truffle fries we received came out a bit stale, but the second one redeemed itself. However, a good restaurant should always be consistent.  We started our brunch with the jelly doughnuts, which were great. I mean, what's not to love about a pillow like ball of fried airy dough filled with tart strawberry preserve? Following the doughnuts was my eggs Benedict royale, done up with smoked salmon and caviar. The caviar was a treat that went along nicely with the smoked salmon, but the hollandaise was a bit lacking. The flavor of the sauce was there, but the chef seemed to be stingy  on the hollandaise. It throws off the whole point of an eggs benedict when the amount of hollandaise barely covers the poached egg. While I wasn't incredibly impressed with my plate, the croque Madame my boyfriend ordered was awesome. A touch greasy, but are you really counting calories when you order a croque Madame? I took a bite..... well, two bites of the sandwich, and was immediately hit with a big crunch. Not only was the bread crisped up perfectly, but the ham was also fried to a crisp as well. Along with the oozing of the melted cheese, plus the yolk of a runny sunny side up, it was simply devine. Lexington Brass is a place I would go back to, even if it's just to try the chicken and waffles, which the table next to us ordered. It looked amazing.... and when I do head back next time, I will make it a point to have extra hollandaise put on my benedicts!",2,1,1,Kristy T.,"Queens, NY",36,133,91

We ordered pot of mussels, soup, artichoke  salad the which never received.  Approx 1/2 hr into not getting appetizers I could not find our waiter to let him know.  Two kitchen staff show up w/meal and our server then comes over and we let him know.  My husband asks for manager, they send over a Host, Jay not professional.  Jay offered to get appetizers going, we mentioned too late, as meal being served.  Jay (host) apologized as my husband explained how server, Scott never came over to our table to check if appetizers came out.  They were also out of everything we asked for. Bread, a basic ceasar salad  All this host, Jay could do was apologize.  We dine frequent and diverse places (high end and everything in between).  We were not looking for a free meal but a least by our drinks.  As we were about to leave, I went over to the host myself and said are you going to do anything for us and he replied ""no"" with a ""smug"" look!  The meals were VERY SMALL PORTIONS!  I ordered rack of lamb ($38) two small lamb chops.  The truffle oils fries, on my daughter's dish were overly done with truffle oil!

Sauteed kale was cooked but still crunched so not overlooked nor slimy. Also had a savory biscuit with delightful honey butter. There were 4 pieces of chicken (2 were small) and I couldn't finish it all; brought one piece home. I also had a Hummingbird cocktail which was well-executed, light and florally.

I've always felt taken care of. Mashia is my go to bartendress during the day and at night, Aaron makes some kick ass cocktails. I've been for brunch, lunch, and dinner and have always been surprised and pleased with my meal. The food choices are accessible and delicious from the tuna tacos to the goat cheese beignets to the pork buns to the lobster BLAT. Even as a rabid meat eater, the vegetarian farro dish is what I crave. At dinner the steak has never disappointed but its the roasted chicken that was the most surprising. It comes with this arugula salad with olives and tomatoes and the meat of the chicken thighs- ridiculous. Brian and Cassie are both amazing servers. They're sweet and informative with the perfect amount of table talk.  Nothing bothers me more than when a server doesn't know when to leave a table, and both of these guys were incredibly charming.

1.0,9/19/2012,"I was just going to write a review based on my abysmal experience for just drinks yesterday when I remembered ""Oh, yeah, I did have lunch here one time"" It's that forgettable. I guess I can start with that review. I met a date for lunch months ago during the week and it was very busy. We were seated at the worst table which is tucked up in the corner by the bar and I think I had a few things hit me while busboys were rushing by. I had the completely bland tuna tartare tacos with guacamole & chili aioli and my date had the totally average cheeseburger. As you can tell from my boring review, neither of these were memorable, much like my date. I stopped in yesterday afternoon around Happy Hour time to try to avoid the coming tornado and being whipped around by wind and rain would have been preferable. I sat on the far side of the bar when it was only about half full and I had no less than 3 bartenders look right through me. I was there a good 15 minutes with a few of zombies just talking amongst themselves behind the bar before I finally moved to the other side of the bar to see if I could get some service. Once I did I ordered a Makers Manhattan, up and the only plus side is she asked me if I wanted it shaken or stirred, a real Manhattan is only ever stirred. The drink was fine but I hate when they immediately ask you for a credit card, we're not at a college bar looking to skip out on our $11.87 beer  tab. I told her i didn't want to start a tab and I asked her how much I owed her. She thought a minute and in a questioning voice asked ""$15?"" Wow, think she just pulled that out of nowhere but whatevs, it is ripoff midtown. I had to wait for my perpetually late girlfriend so i just sat at the bar and watched the tourist try to look natural and not amazed that back in Kansas they could get an entire round of drinks for the bar for the price of 1 cocktail. The bartender then brought out some flat breads ""on the house"" and proceeded to offer them to everyone around me. I guess because I was by myself she didn't want to set down the whole flatbread the size of a kindle in front of just lil ol me. I was just about ready to take my tip back when she looks at me and says ""oh, did you want to take a piece before I set it down?"" Gee, thanks.

Here's what we had:- Both east and west coast oysters (I am the kind that don't need condiments when eating oysters and these oysters are tasteless)- Deviled eggs (actually quite yummy but why the heck would I eat deviled egg at a midtown establishment?!!!!)- Some taco chip with diced up tuna (wow, this dish gives me 90s flashback...so outdated and the tuna is def not of high quality)- Everyone had salad including me...mine is a ""nicoise salad"" with 3 small pathetic pieces of medium cooked tuna (BTW, I asked for medium rare). Price of this super duper small salad: $24...must be the overhead and the location to justify the hefty price. It really should be no more than $10 based on the amount and the quality.- Saving grace was the dessert...however, how hard is it to put some chocolate together and make girls giddy?Our waiter was very attentive to select folks at the table...however, we all agreed he talked way too much and was hitting on one of the co-workers who is at least 7 years his senior.This type of establishment makes me wonder how they will survive and why people would come here to eat in the first place!

My friend ordered our drinks and the bartender gave a look and shook her head at his choice saying 'I'd be happy to make that if that's really what you want but honestly, we have much better options on this menu and since you're using a coupon you better make it count!' This kind of honesty was unexpected and refreshing and worth my 4-star review in itself. Once we finished our drinks at the bar, we were brought to our table and our friendly waiter walked over and greeted us warmly. He informed us that although the rules of the coupon were pretty specific, he'd be more than willing to make some substitutions if we were looking to try other menu items. When does this ever happen? I haven't even gotten to the food.We started with the maple pork buns (recommended on here) and the lobster mac n cheese (a side dish that we were allowed to sub in for an appetizer). The pork buns were tasty but tiny...the mac n cheese was dynamite. Big chunks of lobster. Bread crumbs sprinkled on top. For the entrees, my friend got the fish special which was striped bass over some creamed corn salad thing which was really tasty. I got the steak frites with truffle fries. I've def. had better cuts of meat at other, less expensive, restaurants. The fries were really tasty though. I'd say overall, the sides and drinks were better than the actual entrees.Along with my 4 star rating I would recommend this place for after work cocktails and some light munchies. I would def. go back and see if I enjoy the other entree options more than what I ordered the first time around.",2,0,0,Adam S.,"New York, NY",10,34,3
3.0,7/29/2012,Came on discount deal so was not able to really check out the wine list or taste their raw bar since those were not included.    This place is likely more lively on Wednesday and Thursday nights considering the neighborhood as very subdued on Friday as able to just walk in.  The food was good as enjoyed my tomatos and burrata and tuna burger though it was a bit heavy on the sauce.  The pork buns were moist and the truffle fries were delicious.  Both cocktails I had were above average and the list had nice twists on the classics.  The wine included in the deal was terrible but that is not surprising since trying to save money with the deal as no way it was a 50 dollar bottle and hope the wines on their normal list are better quality for the money.  Liked how they brought in brass in various places including with the bill holder.  If in neighborhood and wanted good cocktail would happily come back and get the truffle fries to tied me over but for the price of the meal would likely not eat here again.,0,0,0,Bryan C.,"Hoboken, NJ",179,395,788

2.0,7/15/2012,"Let me start by saying that I expected more from this resto group.A good go to spot in midtown is hard to find.  LB does not fill the void in this area IMO.  I think it was the management and wait staff that turned me off initially.  I was waiting for friends at the bar for a bit and I heard them speaking to one another.  I didn't appreciate the banter about the patrons.   I will say that our bartender was fab. He kept our glasses filled.  We eventually  ordered dinner at the bar.  Just meh. The pork belly buns were the best thing we had and the truffle fries weren't that bad either.  I also think the wine list seemed a bit high.  Sometimes you want to grab a drink after work without it costing. $50, ya know?I didn't hate LB but I didn't love it either.  I'd see no reason to come back.

A fantastic deal. We were worried we'd get crappy service and portions since we were using the vouchers to dine there but we needn't have worried. Everyone at the restaurant was super nice and the food was really fantastic. There wasn't a single thing we ordered that we didn't love. A special mention for their delicious and truly amazing buttermilk fried chicken and fish and chips. Also amazing, their chilled avocado soup, tune tartare tacos, scallops, and pork buns. All made fresh, with the perfect level of seasoning and flavor and good sized portions.Their cocktails were pretty good too especially Sweet Savannah and Pomegranate Fizz. We'll definitely be back really soon. The only thing that was a little inconvenient but not a big deal is that they don't have a restroom inside the restaurant. You have to walk into the lobby of the Hyatt hotel and take the elevator downstairs to use their restrooms. Not all that out of the way though and worth it for the food and ambiance.

One thing to be mindful of--ask how much their ""special appetizers"" cost. We were asked if we wanted to try their tuna tacos, we said sure, but were later surprised at the price of the appetizer: TOTALLY insane!You should check them out, order their herb-truffle fries, and try out there somewhat messy, yet flavorful steak sandwich.

5.0,5/24/2012,"Lexington Brass is my favorite neighborhood spot, I bring all of my friends and colleagues here and they all agree its a jewel in the middle of midtown. I live and work in the area and have been eating here since it opened and it has never let me down. Totally obsessed with the fried chicken, which is not only my best cure for a hangover, bad day, crappy mood or misbehaving boyfriend - but it is the ultimate comfort food and my go to when I feel like cheating on my healthy lifestyle. Tuna tartare tacos are addicitive (as are the drool worthy truffle fries and the devilled eggs) and they serve my favorite nicoise salad outside of Paris. I have tried almost every dish on the menu (and most of the cocktails) and it's all delicious. Have always found the staff to be welcoming and friendly without being intrusive and they treat the regulars like old friends. I've been under the care of the lovely Eleanor many times and she is fabulous (ask for her section - she is the one rocking the perfect red lipstick and cool glasses) - she is a total doll, knows what to recommend, never leaves you waiting for long and doesn't hover, which is a pet peeve of mine. I always walk out a very satisfied, well fed customer. Brunch, lunch, dinner, drinks  - I would be happy to eat here every day. Contrary to other good spots in the city, there is no snootiness here - just really good food, great service, lovely ambience and a great location for anyone who works or lives in midtown.",1,0,1,Riqie K.,"Manhattan, NY",1,6,2

I actually was deterred from going because of the negative reviews! I'm glad my boyfriend forced us to go  after he saw they had homemade jelly donuts on the brunch menu.  The food was SPECTACULAR! We had the donuts which literally came right out of the deep fryer - doughy and sweetened to perfection. They went light on the jelly and heavy on the sugar on the outside which I was happy about.My boyfriend got the chicken and waffles, which were awesome and very generous in portion size. One big waffle and 4 pieces of chicken with melted butter and maple syrup. The chicken wasn't the crispiest, but it was incredibly moist and delectable.I had the maple chipotle pork belly stack. When it originally came out, it seemed small with a side salad, but it was hearty! The 3 thick pieces of pork belly on top of an English muffin was perfect. The only complaint we had was that the ""5 cup french press"" really only served 3 cups. Their explanation was that the cups were big and actually held closer to 1.5 cups - which is fine, but my expectations weren't really managed. Though, I have to admit, the coffee was excellent.

No one at the bar is getting bread or water - all tables are of course. My salad showed up at the same time as my entree (literally 3 minutes after ordering - both arrived).

3.0,4/3/2012,"Minus one star for inattentive bartenders.  Only the manager has a service oriented attitude.  Disappointing for a hotel restaurant.  Burger was good though.Tip to bartenders: People at hotels are typically in a rush.  Don't mix in your chores and socializing.  If someone is trying to pay.  Focus purely on that and get them on their way.  If someone is without a drink, ask him right away.  If you can't fix the drink immediately, tell them ""I have x orders ahead of you"" or whatever, but don't just leave them hanging/wondering.  Overall, I probably won't come back to the hotel even though I'm diamond platinum with Hyatt just because of the poor service.   I left without spending about $50 of my hotel credit just because I decided I'm not going back.  I might try to convince Hyatt to give me points instead next time (if there is one).Update: Manager is checking out the yelp reviews.  At least he's on top of it.",0,1,0,Doug B.,"Newport Beach, CA",1004,236,340
1.0,3/28/2012,"Just came from having breakfast here. A friend of mine was in town on business and I suggested this place for a quick breakfast, mostly because there's a dearth of  places that open before 8:00 am in this neck of the woods. Of course, now I feel like an ass for doing so. Sorry, friend. Nothing really worth noting in the ""pro"" category, except that it's a block from my office and opens at 7:00 am which I suppose helps it out in the convenience category. And the decor is nice.Now, for the ""con"" aspect of this review: THE OMELETTE. I wish I had taken a picture, because the omelettes we were served (I had the mushroom/gruyere, my friend had the bacon/cheddar) did not resemble anything even remotely close to eggs. It was one big, smooth, rubbery disc of pale yellow weirdness. I kid you not, It looked like Jell-O and polyurethane foam got together and had a baby. A confusing, unnatural, grotesque baby. And there was a bizarre crusty film on the top - like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for a few hours. Seriously, we sat there trying to figure out what on earth they could possibly do to eggs to get them to look like that. And then we stopped because we really didn't want to contemplate that kind of horror. I tried to get past the texture, but the taste wasn't rewarding enough to continue with that kind of herculean effort. The mushrooms were also rubbery and the gruyere was scarce. I don't know how the chef could send those ""omelettes"" out of the kitchen. Was it a joke?  Unfortunately, we were too pressed for time to send them back and order something else. I knew it would be an overpriced meal, but I wasn't expecting to pay $4 for a cup of coffee and $8 for a bottle of plain water. My bad for not examining the menu more carefully, but if I'm paying $8 for a beverage, it better damn well have some alcohol in it.

I've entered pescatarian status again, so this really hit the spot. The burger consists of ground tuna and scallions, and is covered in an interesting sauce.

The service was excellent and the food was good; although I thought it was a little pricey but maybe that's a New York City ordeal. I believe that the restaurant personnel creates an atmosphere which dominates half of ones overall experience at the restaurant. We were greeted by two lovely people and our waiter was also very helpful and pleasant to deal with. I liked the fact that he was cheerful and prompt with his suggestions. Only little downside is that I had to ask for a refill on my water, I know most waiters/waitresses are typically unaware of this, but a good waiter does not need to be asked for a refill; especially on water. The food was excellent, everything looked fantastic and tasted amazing too. The raw oysters were surrounded by a good amount of condiments. We ordered the eggs benedict and the steak and eggs which were all very delicious. Every course came with a side of potatoes which consisted of a nice integration of deep fried hash browns and little chunks of fried potatoes. The interior was nicely done, it had an old school diner feel to it. I must point this out since I've been glancing over at other reviews, but who cares about the noise level! It's not some fine dining restaurant, and I thought it wasn't as obnoxiously loud as a dim sum restaurant!

We were seated at a table that could comfortable seat maybe 3 people. When asked if we could sit elsewhere (there were multiple better tables available) we were rejected.2. Waiter came around to take drink orders and we wanted to order a few appetizers to start. The waiter would not take our appetizer order until we had our entire order ready, saying that it would confuse the kitchen staff. Ridiculous!!!3. One person in our party has a food allergy to truffle oil so asked if the truffle fries could be substituted for something else. The response from the waiter was NO. Then she asked if the fries could be prepared without truffle oil, which he said was possible. Unfortunately when the food came out the fries did have truffle oil, rendering them uneatable.4.  When making the reservation I asked if the restaurant could bring out a dessert with a candle for the birthday girl, the reservation person said no problem and that they do this routinely. After we ordered dessert, no candle came out. I had to speak with the hostess to have this rectified, and finally they brought out a YOGURT with a candle on it. If only our waiter was paying attention he could have put the candle on a piece of cake that we ordered, not on a yogurt bowl which looked ridiculous.5.  Lastly, unfortunately one member of our party got food poisoning from this dinner, and had to spend half of the night sick in the bathroom.Overall major failure. Skip it, there are plenty of better places in Midtown east.",4,1,0,matt g.,"San Francisco, CA",0,15,0

4.0,11/4/2011,"Midtown east is so hot right now! Ha! Was excited to check this place out as I am a fan of Abe and Arthurs food not just the scene.  Finally a great place for dinner and drinks right near the office!  Had a great crowd and was super lively.  Very loud almost has the feel of The Smith mixed with Pastis.  LOVEDDDDDD our gay waiter he was absolutely adorable and wanted to put him in my pocket- ask for BRIAN!  Ordered a bunch of appetizers- deviled eggs w/ cavier awesome, lobster mac and cheese - awesome, tuna tar tar tacos were so so nothing special to me. Truffle fries - classic.  All in all it was a good experience and I'm happy that its nearby.  It is weird that its in the Hyatt but don't mind that!",3,2,0,Amanda M.,"New York, NY",202,33,7
3.0,10/27/2011,"Smaller than it looks on the pictures. Very Parisian with white marble top tables and the bar, B&W photos on the wall. 7:00 pm bar dinner. Gotham Project Zin from the tab is a great table wine ($12)...I had fish and smashed chips. They should call this smashed potatoes. Nothing to do with the Fish&Chips you normally find in the UK. I had to ask the waiter if they will bring the chips separate and  he pointed the plantain looking vegetables on the plate. Overall small portions, nice atmosphere, men in suits (for single ladies) :-)",0,0,0,Asche A.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,83,89
2.0,10/9/2011,"I would love to like this place but I don't. The menu is uninteresting and tastes mediocre.  Had dinner and the service wasn't great, the steak and the appetizer were overly salty and the latte was lukewarm-even the second time around. Overall, extremely mediocre and add the price factor and you soon realize it's better to skip it and go elsewhere-like The National down the street.",0,0,0,Syddie A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,137,15
2.0,10/4/2011,"I am amending my review of Lexington Brass following my second visit.  The experience was disappointing from the quality of the food to the lack of knowledge of my server.  I will not be returning to LB.Sassy Brass in Midtown East!  Welcome to the neighborhood!  I had a great dining experience at the bar:  5 cheeses, truffle fries, artichokes and the sweet corn ravioli. The food was excellent and I truly enjoyed the full truffle flavors. I tried a liter of the CA Zinfandel on tap and enjoyed it.  The wine list seemed a bit limited and lacked medium-priced wines (for a Manhattan establishment) but would order the Zinfandel again.  The staff was accommodating and friendly.  Two thumbs up for Turtle Bay (where I have lived for 16 years and tend to be disappointed by the restaurant options).  I shall return....",1,0,0,Candi O.,"Manhattan, NY",4,5,0

Such a simple dish, but made unique and delicious - definitely crave-worthy :) They have a good selection of cocktails and wine, everyone was really polite and our waitress was attentive.  I heard they have a great lunch/brunch menu as well, so I will be checking that out soon!",1,1,1,Irina K.,"New York, NY",1,6,0
4.0,9/16/2011,"Lexington Brass is a new restaurant in midtown east from the Abe & Arthur team.  It's only been open for about a week and I went last night.  I am already a fan.  The bar is very sleek and the ambiance is great.  We sat at the bar and ordered some drinks, the tuna tacos and the cheese plate.  The tuna tacos were really good as was the cheese plate.  This place is a bit pricey, but you already know that going in.  Since the venue is new, they are still getting caught up and there were a few bumps.  For example, several of the beers were unavailable and my dirty martini was not so dirty (also the olives were not the best).  Despite this, I like this place and am cutting them some slack for being such a new establishment.  Overall, I would definitely go to Lexington Brass again.",5,0,2,Divya M.,"Manhattan, NY",21,50,0
4.0,9/9/2011,"Having walked passed the northeast corner of the 48th and Lex cross on a daily basis for the past several months, I eagerly anticipated the opening of a brand new hotel restaurant that offers an excellent view of Lexington Avenue. I believed this new restaurant would offer the promise of a comfortable, classy dine-in lunch option. Fortunately, that promise was realized.Lexington Brass, brought to you from the people behind Abe and Arthur's, opened its doors (yesterday) in the lobby of the Hyatt 48 Lex for lunch serving American bistro fare. The menu offers a raw bar and appetizers in the $11-$20 range, and seafood/steak entrees in the $30 range. Traditional sandwich and salad options are also available. Upon the first visit, our selections included an appetizer of Deviled Eggs (with caviar), a Pot of Mussels (and truffle fries), and a 1lb. B.L.A.T sandwich (bacon, lettuce, avocado, and tomato) accompanied with field greens.The pot of mussels was a healthy-sized portion marinated in a light cream sauce that was a bit on the bland side. Luckily, the mussels were fresh and flavorful on their own without the  sauce. The BLAT was delicious and leans on the heavy side. While the portion of lobster isn't as generous as an actual lobster roll, one half of the sandwich is already coma-inducing. In saving the best for last, the deviled eggs with caviar was excellent. Fresh and sturdy egg whites and egg yolks that taste every bit like egg-yolk without hints of mayo, mustard, or tartar sauce. The caviar offered a small change of pace in taste, but was simply icing on the ""egg"".Undoubtedly, Lexington Brass is not a cheap meal. A $100 lunch for two would not be unreasonable. However, for the ambiance, comfort, service, and quality of food in the heart of midtown east Manhattan, it is probably worth the occasional splurge.",7,0,4,Nelson W.,"New York, NY",463,563,951
