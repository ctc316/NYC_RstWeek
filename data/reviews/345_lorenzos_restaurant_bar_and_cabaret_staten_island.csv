2.0,5/1/2019,"The food here is average. There is no beer on tap. The wine selection is limited. There is a happy hour menu which provides some small and tasty selections for about seven dollars per dish. These are worth trying. For breakfast, there is no espresso coffee just the regular drip filter.

4.0,4/10/2019,A really nice restaurant attached tied to the HGI.   Breakfast is also served here.    This is a combined dinner and breakfast review.   Ample seating and a full bar with decent seating.   Lots of tall tops in the bar and 4 tops in the main room.  There is a stage for bands or shows.   There is a wine room for groups.    The food is good to very good.   I had the cavatelli after reviewing the menu for a good 10 min.   I juts couldn't make up my mind.  I spiced up the cavatelli with Parm and black pepper.   I wish the sausage would have been spicier. Order the lemon caper sauce for your bread.   Wow is it good.   Bread also comes with 3 different options. Oil peppermix and butter.   My colleagues were both clean plate rangers on their seafood parapadelle dish.  Neither stopped eating until it was gone.    Breakfast is hot and cold for $14.95.   I asked for poached eggs.  They were runny instead of the medium I expected.   I should have had the omelet.  Turkey and pork sausage options.  Bacon of course.  They also do Pancakes.   Normal fruit and breads.    Worth the money if you don't have status at Hilton.   We will be back to the HGI and this restaurant,0,0,2,Doug S.,"Madison, IN",27,204,264
3.0,3/30/2019,I hate giving poor reviews but they all can't be 5 stars. This place is stunning and beautiful. The problem was the food. It was a retirement party for my boss. I think I was expecting so much more and that did not happen. The food was tasteless and bland. I'm not sure who the chef was but he must have had a bad day. I may give them another chance but will not be back no time soon,0,0,0,Melvinik S.,"Staten Island, Staten Island, NY",76,73,266
4.0,2/25/2019,"My husband and I stopped here for dinner tonight quite unexpectedly,after my doctor appointment in the same parking lot. We were hungry so we ordered the sweet calamari as an appetizer served with sweet peppers and pine nuts. This was very tasty and delicious . It was cooked perfectly. We  both ordered  steak. I ordered the Delmonico rib eye. Cooked perfectly medium like I asked and seasoned so well. My husband got the fillet Mignon and said it was one of the best steaks hes had in a long time. The were both more flavorful than any steakhouse I've been at. They came with parmagiane steak fries and I subbed out them for mashed potatoes . We were both so full, we skipped dessert. Definitely will be back there next time im  craving a steak. The dining room is beautiful and the waiters are all so friendly . Service was very attentive .

3.0,2/23/2019,"Wishing I could give 5 stars,  the food was not bad,  I ordered room service and the food is always delish, but the restaurant is not what it should be.  It has so much potential, but the waiters seem like they are not at all trained in friendliness, it is a very strange feeling.  I would love to give 5 stars because the piano player for valentines day dinner on the 16th was amazing.  The owners walked around and spoke to everyone which was a great touch however the waiters, restaurant manager...does not convey a warm feeling like the owners did.  They are all in a rush and maybe just tired or annoyed...I dont know.  The bread was hard, not warm.  My steak and veggies were good. Hubby had the same...portions small, we ended up going back to the room and ordering room service.  Room service food was amazing.  Our room wasn't as clean or updated like the first time we came here and stood the night on salsa night.  Hoping to go back for the next salsa night and valentines day dinner next year, hopefully the owners read this review and if you do please less tacky cheap decor....  stick on snowflakes on the windows, balloons around the piano?   Who ever decorates needs to be fired.

1.0,2/21/2019,"Staying here at the Hilton Garden Inn and decided to eat at Lorenzo's with my fiancé. I'll get straight to the point and let it be known that the food is terrible. The water glasses that were at the table were dirty and we asked for them to be replaced. (Wasn't water spots, was actual Food particles on glass). Decided to order our food to go so we could bring back to our hotel room. Regret doing this because once we got settled in to eat, the food didn't taste good at all. After a few bites of what we ordered we both felt as if we should of went back down stairs to see if we could be refunded. The breaded chicken in the chicken scarpariello was dry and hard to chew. The lemon Chardonnay sauce was just overwhelming. My fiancé ordered the Lobster ravioli with arugula/diced tomatoes and she was disappointed about the quantity of what she paid for. This is my first time hearing or eating at this place and it wasn't a very pleasant experience. Maybe I need to explore the menu a little more before I judge the quality of this restaurant based off the two Entrées we ordered.",0,0,0,Josh T.,"Staten Island, Staten Island, NY",154,2,0

Upon asking for my name, they new right away we were the winners of a Valentine's day brunch they offered on social media. The decor was beautiful, new rugs, balloons and as usual a phenomenal pianist.

1.0,2/15/2019,"Literally the most uncomfortable experience I've ever had. Boy oh boy where do I begin?My fiancé and I just got in from a 4 hour car ride and wanted something to eat. Lorenzo's was close and within walking distance. We're still in our travel clothes: sweats and crocs (so not exactly suit and ties).The doorman greeted us and escorted us to our table and poured us ice water and walked away. We were the only people in the ballroom we were seated in aside from a couple who were the drunkest individuals I have ever witnessed (but we'll get back to them in a second).We looked at the menu expecting burgers and steaks because it is a bar and grill. No, it was only things we couldn't pronounce and absolutely ridiculous prices. We settled on Fried Calamari, a bowl of Tomato Basil soup, and Parmesan Steak Fries. A young man brought some bread to the table and honestly this was the highlight of the meal. Our food came pretty quickly, and the Tomato soup was so bitter and acidic I couldn't eat it. The fried calamari was lukewarm and extremely chewy. It also didn't have any flavor. Not even salt and pepper could save it. The ""steak fries"" were potato wedges and were barely cooked. They were rock-solid. Disgusting.My fiancé and I couldn't eat any of the food and were chuckling about how bad it was. The manager ripped one of the bus boys a new one right in front of us. He screamed in this kid's face, waved his arms around, and when the kid wanted to ask him a question, he shushed him and told him he was close to being ""given the boot"". I have never felt so uncomfortable. Now, let's go back to the hilarious couple behind us. They were sitting on the same side of the table and cuddling while eating, which was already odd. Every time the server approached them, the gentleman would scream ""I need more butter!"" Or ""I gotta have another fork!"" Which was entertaining. When he got the check he argued with the server about the price. Again, very uncomfortable. Then, 4 different servers asked us if the food was okay because I guess they saw that we weren't eating. We just smiled and asked for our check each time. We paid our $35 and tried to get out of there as fast as we could. Our server asked why we didn't eat and we said we didn't find it appetizing. He walked away without saying a word. What an experience. Never ever again. Good try, Lorenzo's, but you missed your shot. Gross food, weird atmosphere, uncomfortable service.",0,0,0,Morgan R.,"Thomasville, PA",94,6,0
1.0,12/6/2018,"I came her to celebrate my dad's birthday and I cannot Recommend this restaurant. Where do I begin? To start, we ordered a few appetizers. Calamari and mussels. Mussels were ok but the calamari was HARD as a rock. It was so hard that I couldn't put my fork in it.Delmonico's ribeye? 1/4 inch thick? Forget about it! Steak tasted like it was straight from the freezer. Bland, no taste. Cmon, Lorenzo's! Throw some salt and pepper on it!  I could of made a better steak at home with my eyes closed.Price wise your going to be spending close to 100 dollars per person if you order apps, entree and a couple of drinks.Would I return?

Me and my family dined here on Easter and i must say, i was VERRRRY DISAPPOINTED! It was a pre-fix dinner and not the buffet. Anywho, some of the bread was hard as a rock, gingerale was watered down and ended up ordering coke and the waitress forgot about it. Some of the food wasn't well cooked and some was too dry at this point we just wanted to leave.

3.0,1/10/2018,"""Room service"" requests for the Hilton Garden inn are fulfilled by this restaurant. According to marketing in the elevators and found throughout the hotel, a guest may look to room service to fill ANY  request, even those out of the ordinary. In their examples they mention ordering a flatbread that is not on their menu or ordering something simple like eggs w/ a specific ingredient and toast. (I'll touch back on this later)Due to the ""bomb cyclone"" ice storm which affected much of the NE states, my travel to the hotel was hindered with repeated flight delays, etc.. Short story, when I got into the hotel, I decided on room service and staying in. I surfed reviews first, so I knew to expect underwhelming food. Surfing the web revealed that local area restaurants could take up to an hour delivering food and most closed by 9 or 10 pm. Not having a car and it being late, options became all-the-more limiting. My order: Fried calamari, Limoncello salad & Parmigiano crusted Tuscan steak fries. The Calamari looked par-fried. It didn't have any color, nor was it pleasing going down. I reside in that camp that believes fried anything should have a nice golden brown coloring.. yeah? Also.. I'm not a fan of marinara sauce with fried items especially when it's bland. The salad could have been solid but was oversalted, I'm guessing it was a fault of the dressing. The salad came w/ Granny smith apples sliced, candied walnuts, sun-dried cranberries and Limoncello thyme vinaigrette. Last, the steak fries. Not fry-like, enormous potato wedges heavily coated and baked in parmigiana cheese. They should think about pairing it with fun dips. A cheese sauce, horseradish something or they could doctor up the wedges so that they have an accent color from herbs. Ketchup alone didn't do it justice but served a second purpose as an additional sauce for the Calamari. My room service charges were in the ballpark of just below $40 dollars.. with a 20% tip auto-added on for delivery.....(Really?!) However, it was nice that it was served atop a round service platter with SS covers and white cloth napkins. On the side they included two goblets of water with lemon wedges, a nice addition since I hadn't ordered any drinks.Thinking of my stay recently. I was towards the tail-end of the trip and wanted some fruit. Per the advertising in the elevators (feel at home with room service, they will try to get you ""anything""), figured I could request something like a smoothie. (I needed a banana and figured a fresh fruit smoothie would give me a good fill of fruits.)Well, I spoke with the bartender. Let me tell you.. she made me feel foolish for inquiring about a smoothie. She didn't want to ""muddy"" her blender it seems. (It's a typical effing blender that most Americans across the country make smoothies in. It can take maybe 50 seconds or less to wash out any debris.) I'm asking for something simple, not filtered juice or anything extreme. In any case, she found a banana on ""its last legs"" so I was offered that.  If not for the advertising in their elevators, I never would have asked. Instead, hired a cab and gone to a local juice shop.If it wasn't next door to the hotel you know what I mean? I'm curious about their cabaret and events but not enough to go out of the way.",10,4,5,Jacob J.,"Chicago, IL",727,2602,3100

It's a huge round banquet table, very bad for conversations so I asked if we could have a smaller table.

The bloody Mary's were all prepared and had been sitting for a while because all the ice had melted, the waiter had to stir them to make them look drinkable. The food was disappointing.

They even gave my mom a private room even though she didn't have enough guests (40 I believe) because it wasn't being used-- at no extra cost. The food was great. I'm usually not a fan of mass made ""party food,"" but Lorenzo's has it down. The first course was an arugula salad; penne for the pasta course; choice of chicken, beef, or shrimp for entree; and my mom took care of dessert. I chose the shrimp, and loved it. The guests also couldn't stop praising the food. The drinks were on point as well. I've also been to Lorenzo's for dinner.

I can get toasted and stumble upstairs to bed. Maybe this is a little reckless since this is only Wednesday, but who are YOU to judge, Internet?? Danielle, the afternoon bartender is friggin adorable and so sweet to everyone. Being that this is a hotel bar, all walks of life come in. I'm currently in my work clothes (jeans and steel toe boots) sitting next to a man in a suit sitting next to a women in a leopard print cardigan. The hotel bar is the great equalizer in our society, you know. Food is a little above basic since they serve the full restaurant dinner menu at the bar. I'm told the chicken martini was great; the green beans looked so fresh and green. Their bolognese was bland, in my opinion. There's no richness to it, just canned tomato taste. Butternut squash soup is seasonal and different from any other place I've had. I couldn't put my finger on it, but there was a bit of spice I found warm it wasn't overly sweet. As tempting as they might be on happy hour special, I'd skip the traditional calamari and wings on flavor alone. Calamari was tough and under seasoned while the wings were tough and dry.

1.0,4/20/2015,"Sunday we went to the Mothers Day  Brunch served in the banquet room.  Our server took complimentary drinks (Mimosas, Bellini, and Bloody Mary)  and told us to help ourselves to the buffet.  With the exception of the omelts, food was overcooked, cold; seafood (oysters, shrimp, calamaria) were mushy.  When we got the bill they charged us for the supposed complimentary drinks and tacked on a service charge.  When we questioned the server we were told the drinks were not comlimentary and the other server was wrong.  Needless to say the bill for 6 people came to just under 500.  The original cost for the meal for 1 person was 49.99.  Richard Nictros should be ashamed for the poor quality and the charge for the drinks.  We go out often for brunches (Water Club; Pasticierro Bruno) i will never frequent the Hilton (Lorenzos) again",9,3,0,Carole S.,"Staten Island, NY",0,4,0

For dinner I had the Artichoke & Shrimp Ravioli but I imagined it would be something else, like shrimp and artichoke's in ravioli but it's plain ravioli with big shrimp and artichokes in a butter-type sauce. It was okay. My two friends had the salmon dish and seemed to enjoy it. When we got there we had to go through about 3 drink orders because the bar didn't have different alcohols. Now since this restaurant is in the lobby of a Hilton hotel I found it strange that they didn't have everything fully stocked on a Saturday night. The waiter was okay. He didn't seem to knowledgeable about his job. I might be back to try a different main course, because the apps were good but not anytime soon.",3,0,0,Kathryn H.,"New York, NY",45,181,55

The menu has a pretty decent selection and the prices are definitely on the high side. Their drinks, Lemon Drop Martini and the Sour Apple Martini are extremely delicious. Also, very pricey, which helps me realize I'm still in NYC. I didn't like the fact, a Apple Martini was $10.50 and a Sour Apple Martini was $12.I had the Goat cheese appetizer on a bed of salad. Very delicious, and I enjoyed it a lot. I had the lobster meat, mushroom, and artichoke hearts with Risotto. All the vegetables had a smokey flavor to it. You tell our food was made from scratch. Very delicious as well. My pockets were pretty empty by the end of the night. My supervisor had the steak. Cooked very well and season to perfection. He had no complaints.

2.0,12/29/2013,"The only reason Im giving this rating is our waiter. In short, he was terrible. We came in around ten thirty on Saturday morning for the breakfast buffet after a fun night enjoying our room in the hotel. We had on our pajamas and the hosts sat us right away.  Jimmy J was our waiter/server according to our receipt. He came off a little aloof at first,  I thought,  hey,  it's still early,  maybe hes not up yet.  The dining room was empty and it was buffet style so I didn't expect much service... that is until we asked for coffee and then juice and it felt like I was bothering him by asking. Fast forward. We came back for dinner later that evening and to our surprise, we had Jimmy again. Poor guy.Poor us.We were seated right away and the dining room was beautifully lit and the lounge pianist was so soothing and set a wonderful mood.Jimmy coldly asked us if we wanted drinks, and swiftly left. He never stayed at our table more than a few seconds to interact with us. Again, I felt I was bothering him when we finally ordered. Other patrons near us got a sweeter Jimmy. He laughed with them, I over heard him mention specials and other things that weren't on the printed menu he dropped on the table.  (Our meal was wonderful! Great prices and great portions!)We were alone most of our meal. A different host checked on us. I saw jimmy check other tables many times before he returned to ours, which he simply peeked at whole swiftly passing us. He didn't ask us what brought us to the area. He had seen us twice in the same day. I would have told him it was one of our birthdays and that's why we even came here in the first place. Instead, I had to flag him down to see a dessert menu. He seemed to rush the check on us and by this point, my partner and I were just not feeling welcome at all. We swallowed our drinks and left.We really wish we got one of the other servers we encountered.Hopefully this message gets to Jimmy and the management at Lorenzos.",2,2,0,Alyssa N.,"Manhattan, NY",12,14,21

3.0,2/16/2013,"I came to Lorenzo's Restaurant on Valentine's Day so keep in mind it was a Pre-Fix Menu Holiday Experience. Upon arrival it was a little busy as expected for Valentine's Day. We arrived for our 8 pm reservations and were seated at 8:40. 40min after our reservation. Now most people would be upset but I can honestly say the wait never worked out better. We enjoyed Pomegranate Champagne at the bar and once seated we had the best view in the house to watch a live band performance of Frank Sinatra Classics. The decor It's not over the top or eye popping but does the job. A classic Rustic look. Onto the food and service. For appetizers we had the calamari w/ pine nuts and a honey balsamic vinaigrette glaze amazing is the only words to describe. Crab cakes were cooked to a light crisp with great flavor not mushy, over creamy or mayo. Our entrees were cooked well. The surf  and turf was perfectly cooked. The red snapper was good but a couple little bones but isn't an easy fish to remove pins from. Dessert was fantastic with an apple tart w vanilla ice cream and the white chocolate moose w a strawberry tuxedo design for creativity. All in all would definitely return even for just the calamari even if it is a different twist on an Italian classic. Drink prices are fair compared to the upstairs lounge ABOVE.
