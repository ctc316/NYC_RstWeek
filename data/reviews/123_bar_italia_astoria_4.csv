4.0,2/15/2019,"Came here for dinner and a drink with a buddy of mine on a Saturday night, and had a very pleasant experience!  This place has a cozy, relaxed atmosphere.  It looks pretty small from the outside, but is a lot longer and larger towards the back when you walk in.I just ordered the Astoria Pizza off of their appetizers menu (wasn't feeling pasta that night), which was a simple white pizza with prosciutto, ricotta, and truffle oil; my friend got the squid ink pasta.  While the pizza was admittedly a bit doughier than I would've liked, it was still solid!  Wonderful service too -- maybe it was just that it wasn't terribly busy when we walked in, but our bartender was friendly and attentive the entire time we were there.  Even struck up a quick conversation with us, which I can always appreciate!  They also have a standard selection of beers on tap at a standard price of $8 per pint -- nothing too much to say there!Overall, I would definitely come here again if I was in the area!",0,0,0,Alex L.,"Charlotte, NC",370,113,35

4.0,1/3/2019,"Went here on Christmas Eve, as I didn't feel like making all the fishes myself. Service was good, but the place was empty. All pastas are homemade and it shows, nice fresh flavor. I had the squid ink pasta with shrimp, it was tasty and nicely presented, others enjoyed their dishes as well (Carbonara and peppardelle dishes). The wine list is sparse and mainly South American and South Pacific, very few Italian and French wines. Was not able to pair the way I wanted to, and that's kind of a big deal to me. Happy hour deal/beers were good though, but drank before the main course. Would definitely like to try the calamari and the frutti de mare, this place is close by and seems to be a safe bet.",1,1,0,Peter D.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",125,270,4
5.0,1/2/2019,"Astoria local here. I popped into Portalia on Saturday around 2pm to try out their brunch menu. Service was great; I was seated within one minute of arriving and our server was very prompt and professional being attentive to refilling glasses of water and checking in on my order. I tried the gnocchi and burger - both were delicious, cooked perfectly and I knew immediately that I would be back to try their dinner menu. Lastly, I tried the warm chocolate brownie with ice cream bar sticking out - a fun dessert to share and indulge in. This place is a great addition to Astoria's growing dining scene with superb quality of food and attentive service to customers.",0,0,0,Shabe A.,"Astoria, NY",0,1,4
5.0,12/30/2018,"The restaurant is super cozy and appealing. The atmosphere is great. I loved the Twilight Zone and Buster Keaton. The music was perfect as was the attentive staff. Best of all was the food. I had an array of appetizers and loved them all, especially the meatballs. They make a darn good meatball! Also had a salad and chicken parm.

4.0,12/4/2018,"This is my new favorite neighborhood restaurant.  Comparably affordable, but FEELS expensive because the service, food and wine are excellent.  Tonight, having the risotto special with salmon& sweet peas. The focaccia bread is excellent, and they're now serving with a delicious tomato/basil/goat cheese sauce.  And it's $6 wine all night!UPDATE - the management has changed and there have been ups and downs.  Some of the happy hour options have changed for the worse.  Valeria behind the bar is very gracious and attentive - love her!  Still a good neighborhood bar.  And the Caesar salad is good even with Arugula (still a little scared of romaine if I don't know where it's from!).  It has potential to be a top notch Italian bar and I want one in Astoria!",0,0,0,Liz U.,"New York, NY",313,6,1

1.0,11/18/2018,"Went today for the first time, was excited to try after reading so many positive reviews about their brunch. There were several good things about our visit: wait staff and hostess were very friendly. Restaurant is super cute. Bar has a tv if you want to watch the game. Great space for events. Clean. Unfortunately the overall experience was not good and will keep us from coming back: I attempted to order two dishes but was told they did not have the ingredients to make them. (Would be helpful if we were told this when we sat). Husband ordered a Bloody Mary and it came out almost straight tomato juice garnished with a lemon. waited 40 minutes for food - was told it was due to two large parties that sat right before us. Ok, no problem...except when the food came out it was not good. (This place is not cheap btw- so I'm expecting the food to be on point). There was still shell on my shrimp that I discovered after eating it. My home fries were too undercooked to eat. (Positive -The eggs were perfectly poached.) My English muffin was soggy instead of toasted. Both our dishes had no taste. Husband ordered omelette with mozzarella tomato and spinach, however the tomato and spinach must have been left in the kitchen. The side of bacon I ordered was almost too undercooked to eat (one piece was). Overall, not a good experience and very disappointing after hearing/reading so many positives. Don't mind paying $50 for a brunch if it's worth it. Guess we will stick to our regular spots.",1,0,0,Kimberly R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,5
1.0,10/26/2018,"Unprofessional, rude and bad customer service. Apparently in this place customers have no right and can't be honest about their liking or disliking of the food and drinks or else the owner's wife will come to you with a rant",2,0,0,Tawhid I.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",1,4,1
1.0,10/26/2018,"I AM LIVID AT THIS EXPERIENCE. We walked into Portalia for some nice drinks and food; per usual. There was only one person working who didn't acknowledge us till we went and sat down ourselves. How is there one person throughout the entire restaurant serving food, bringing water and utensils, making drinks and waiting the whole food area? Poor planning but we decided to let it go and resonate with her. We later discovered it's the owners wife! Throughout the whole experience, we showed extreme patience. When it took 20 minutes for her to attempt to make 2 drinks for people who came for the bar, that's an issue, but we did not complain. She asked me how I liked the drink and i said ""it's great, just a little sweet."" So she replied ""no problem I'll make it a little stronger"", & after she fixed it she asked ""how is it?"" I said ""it's good now thanks!"" Then she asked my friend if she would like to wait for the bartender (we know him and he makes great drinks) to make the drink for her. She said ""it's 6:59 he starts at 7 so once he is here he will make it"". So my friend said okay, mind you we keep waiting and now it's 7:15 no sign of the bartender, and my friend has been waiting for a drink for 40 minutes.So when the bartender was arriving, we all decided to leave and told the bartender to forget about the martini. That's when I explained to my friend ""dude she's probably the owner or something. Maybe they were short staffed today & look, she is running around working. Let's not leave, we should give them a chance. Businesses have unforeseeable circumstances that come up."" So my friend is like okay and tells the bartender, ""actually you know what, I'll have the martini"". So he makes it & we decide to stay and order food. We got the white sauce mussels and margherita pizza, ordering from the bartender. Then all of the sudden, owners wife comes into my face and says ""it wasn't nice that you said you liked the drink I made and then told the bartender you don't want it. Liar"" and I'm just like WTF.. so I replied ""I never said that, I'm still drinking the drink so what is the problem?"" And she walks away. Okay whatever, we ordered food now we shouldn't walk out so we just decided to wait for the food then leave. We didn't order another round. Second point, I really enjoy the mussels here and have gotten 2 bowls at a time every time I'm here! I even told her, ""the mussels here are the best I've had in Astoria"" but when they arrived they were cold! So I told her, ""these are usually piping hot, can you please warm them up?"" And she goes ""first you complained about the drink and now this? This is not cold! Ugh"" and walks away with the bowl. Still keeping our composure, we sat there. The bartender kept apologizing and was very nice, he totally understood us, or so it seemed. He even told us "" i know you guys come here often, I'm sorry for that"". First of all, why is there only one person catering to the WHOLE restaurant? Of course the food will be cold and everything will be late! Secondly, she was giving the couple behind us first class treatment because they were having a meal, not the 3 customers who walked in after. I have been here before and the servers and bartenders are very nice. But this woman, she needs to relax and learn how to treat customers. Especially ones who are so understanding! This restaurant is your bread and butter, this is your provider and source of income. Don't act like that towards customers who give you business, so there is food on your table at home. It's simply unacceptable and I'm greatly sorry I won't be coming back to a place where the ""owner"" is like that. & PSA to the guy below who posted my picture without my consent from ARIZONA, NATE F. Don't comment on a situation you know NOTHING about. Especially when you're not even from here and have only came once where the wife was clearly catering to you more, since you got a full meal. Please mister owner, tell your wife to stay home so she doesn't drive away any more customers! She doesn't know how to serve people. The only way I would continue coming here is if I get an apology from the owner. As a family of business owners, I understand these situations occur. I will definitely re-update my review based on this situation.",3,1,1,Johura M.,"Greenpoint, Brooklyn, NY",110,48,136

3.0,5/25/2018,"I last reviewed this restaurant in 2016. At that time there wasn't a lot special about Portalia that other restaurants of comparable cuisine couldn't offer already. As I was back walking along Broadway, I thought another review was in order. Looking at the prices, the menu looked reasonable for a traditional Style restaurant, so I thought I would give them another try. Since 2016 they have made their restaurant a little more swanky with an open bar.I was looking for tasty soft food at a reasonable price and selected what I thought was a moderately priced house ravioli of the day. That was a big mistake. My bad. The actual price for the ravioli was not listed on the menu, I was charged $21 for the pasta and $7,00 for two cokes (no refill). Altogether over $30 for what should have been a very reasonably priced dinner. You can see exactly what paid for dinner on the attached copy of the check. I am not planning to return. I feel I was nickeled and dimed! That's no way to enjoy dinner on a beautiful spring day.",3,1,0,Neil H.,"New York, NY",7,348,2563

1.0,5/15/2018,Update 5/15. I spoke with open table they looked into the system and saw the reservation was there. They are opening an investigation into what happened. We didn't get to eat until almost 8pm because all other places were packed with mothers day patrons. I think what happened is the owner is anti family or anti kid and when he saw my infant daughter with us didn't want to deal so he made up not having our reservation. The second I walked in and was told what happened this coward of an owner went and hid in the back like a weasel. I hope open table removes there restaurant from there service.

3.0,5/14/2018,"Came here for an early Mother's Day dinner,we had reservations and were seated immediately. The decor is beautiful, it has a cute, cozy, elegant vibe. Food: For appetizers we had mussels (yum) and margarita pizza, which was underwhelming. The pizza wasn't bad, just not very flavorful.We ordered bread and were provided with what looked like sliced white bread and a tomato/goat cheese sauce: A bit dissapointingPenne alla vodka: Made wellSalmon: Kind of bland and no side dishes to go with itRicotta Cheesecake: DivineTiramisu: DeliciousDrinks: My sister had a blood orange cocktail which literally tasted like orange mouthwash, (I kid not), it had a bitter aftertaste and was very poorly made. The worse part about this drink is that we were informed by our waitress that we could not change the drink, that we would be charged for it, so our best option is to have the bartender re-make the drink. She also indicated that we should have know what we were ordering based on the description, TF?!! Basically the drink was re-made, still tasted horrible and my sister ended up having sprite. We paid for the nasty drink. Beware and mindful of what cocktails you order.I would say stick with wine.Not sure if I will be returning.",2,0,0,Janita R.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,3,0

The brunch menu had a little of everything: eggs, salads, pizza, and pasta. My sister and mother both had the pizza. The Astoria pizza with truffle oil was amazing!!! I had the smoke salmon and Brussel sprouts. Both were absolutely delish. The smoked salmon with the low fat cream cheese and red onions were softer and less salty than I've had with other cold salmon dishes. The sprouts came with pancetta. The waiter was very kind and continuously filling our drinks for the 90 minute unlimited brunch. I would absolutely come here again for brunch or try it for dinner.

2.0,5/13/2018,"I wanted to believe in this place so much, given the rave reviews. However, I was disappointed. We came in a bit before 5 on a Sunday on Mother's Day without a reservation. It was packed. I started feeling positive... ok, if there were this many people here before the dinner rush, it must be really good. It was pretty much downhill after that. We sat at the bar and ordered. The appetizer came fast so I decided to pace it and not get too full for the main course. Big mistake. Our food did not arrive till more than 45 mins after. Our server said it was because they were backed up due to a big table. The big table had 10 people. The tables started emptying out. Pretty soon, the restaurant was already half empty and our food still had not arrived. If they can't handle a pre-dinner rush, they have no reason to be in business. Eventually when our food arrived, it was still a disappointment. I have had better. Patience is supposed to be rewarding, not in this case.",1,0,0,Clovy P.,"New York, NY",0,6,1

5.0,4/29/2018,"Went here tonight for the first time and was blown away. Went early (6:30pm) bc I had my 15 month old baby with me. I always try to get in before the dinner rush cause I know babies can be a nuisance. And in classic form he was...wasn't too loud but definitely made a mess...pieces of food all over he floor...either way the service team was very nice and not bothered by this baby of mine. So from a service stand point...5 stars!Now to the food...we started with the spinach salad which had goat cheese almonds and pears? Possibly apples? Can't recall...but a solid starter...clean flavors not too much dressing. My mother got the baked cod which was outta control...the fish itself was crusted in coconut and placed on top of mashed potatoes and sautéed spinach. The fish was lightly sweet from the coconut and the potatoes were savory and garlicky so the combined bite was so perfect! I had the Astoria pizza which was ricotta, prosciutto, arugula, and truffle oil...again it was a hit! Generous on the truffle oil but not overwhelming. Oh yeah and the sangria is HUGE! And STRONG! Two thumbs up...we will definitely be going back soon!",0,0,0,Beata D.,"Chelsea, Manhattan, NY",0,5,0

4.0,2/20/2018,"This past weekend me and the Mrs wanted to celebrate Valentine's day a little later than usual so naturally, being the greaseballls that we are, I needed to find a new & classy Italian restaurant to start off the evening. After browsing Yelp I came across a small little place called Portalia in one of my favorite places in NYC, Astoria, and the reviews & pictures were enough to win me over.I was a little worried to find out that I would not need a reservation for a table at 7:30-8pm on a Saturday night but I figured what the hell we're only 2 people. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by the extremely loud laughing and hollering from a group of friends at the bar. Needless to say I asked for a table waaaayyy in the back to hopefully drown out the obnoxious conversation going on up front.Our waiter was nice and detailed the specials to us. The menu was very compact which I liked allot. The fewer the selection the more well versed the chef usually is on your dish. We ordered the Prosciutto, fresh motzarella and roasted red pepper platter which was heavenly. However, the bread that was served to us seemed very cheap, almost like wonder bread, served with a dipping bowl of vodka sauce.. a little disappointing. My girl got the Penne with chicken while I went more adventurous and ordered the special: the filet mignon & mushroom risotto. Although the wait was long for a restaurant serving only 4 tables I can honestly say that it was worth being patient for. The risotto was delectable - creamy but not overwhelmingly so and the pieces of steak were tender and busting with flavor. As for the Penne, she seemed to love it and my taste confirmed that it was certainly cooked to perfection. We ended the night with the Lava cake (a classic desert you can barely mess up) and we threw in the towel.My only complaint was at the end when my frugal behind tried to pay with a $100 active AMEX gift card that, for some reason, they said didn't work. This was pure nonsense and I believe the owner just didn't want me paying with two means of money. Whatever. I sucked it up and threw it on my card but that did nag me a bit. It should be noted that an appetizer, two main courses (1 being a special), two glasses of Champaign & desert was only $85 bucks. That's a great price for great food! Despite the wonderbread like loaf, the screaming drunks at the bar and the lackluster effort by the staff the process my payment correctly at the end of the night, the deliciousness of the food well stood a review of two solid thumb up. If you're ever on Broadway in Astoria and want to stop on in for some fine Italian dining at a very reasonable price then I highly suggest Portalia.

Some of the dishes had a salty undertone which was weird (and I love salt) - specifically the meatballs and fries. The pasta was the best dish, we had the carbonara but again not as spectacular as expected. We also ordered the portalia burger which was a bit lacking in flavor but did the job for my hungover boyfriend. The service and ambiance was the high point.

4.0,9/13/2017,"So my GF was craving Italian for a while and we just kept putting it off until I finally pushed the phone in front of her and said ""find one"". Astoria has a nice selection of Italian restaurants with all the well known names and 1000 plus 4 1/2 out of 5 star reviews. We wanted the path least traveled and she picked a winner. We went early to avoid the crowds and noise. We always seem to sit at the bar if we can, my experience in restaurants with a bar-the best person to ask what's good is the bartender. He suggested the crab cakes to start and they were really yummy, the salad that's served with it was just as good. For an entree he suggested the burger or the almond crusted salmon. We agreed on our next outing we would definitley try it but sitting in an Italian restaurant I chose the Gnochi and she the Penne with sliced chicken. I haven't eaten Gnochi in such a long time I forgot how much I love this meal, the four cheese blend was so good I don't think I spoke to my GF for the first 5 minutes, head down fork up. She kept trying to offer me some Penne but....head down for up. When I finally surfaced from the four cheese wave I tried the Penne. The pasta was cooked perfectly, the sauce was rich and smooth and the chicken nice and tender. All told with 3 glasses of wine and three Peroni's $90 with tip.

5.0,6/24/2017,I pass this lovely little gem all the time and am taunted by their never-ending Happy Hour (seriously - every day and all night until closing!).  I stopped in once on a date and was highly impressed.  I had the pleasure of returning his past week and have been smiling ever since!  What's good?  A variety of choices of  $6 wines and $5 (or 6?) beers (sorry-I just drink wine!).  I believe they have house drinks on Happy Hour as well (again I just focus on wine).  There are even some nibbles on the HH menu as well!  Both times I have been there I am stunned by the deliciousness of the wine (this ain't your normal Happy Hour Shitty House Wine Which You Still Drink Because it was so Cheap and You're On a Budget).  I am MORE stunned by the size of the glass and the HEALTHY pours!  You get more than your money's worth for that $6.  That's my kind of Happy Hour.  The ONLY catch is that you have to sit at the bar.  This isn't really a catch at all because so far there is usually room and I had the pleasure of meeting/chatting with the owner Antonio.  The only time I'd rather not it at the bar is on a lovely night when you would rather sit in the outside seating - but it is a small price to pay for the Happy Hour deals! I ordered the penne vodka off the regular dinner menu and thoroughly enjoyed it as well!  I almost don't want to share this review for fear my secret will be out - but more people should be enjoying this loveliness.,0,0,0,J M.,"Astoria, NY",14,16,2

1.0,5/15/2017,"Hi- I don't usually take the time to write reviews unless I either feel really strongly about a place bad or good. And for this place, definitely a bad. I would give it no star if possible. Firstly, when I entered, the host was a guy dressed in a trucker cap and blue jeans. We honestly didn't know if he worked there. He asked how many we had and we said two. He then said there's no room currently... that was it. So my boyfriend said okay we will sit at the bar and wait for a table. The host said okay everyone should be done fairly quickly.So we sat at the bar and there are 2 tvs- one with the news on and the other a UFC fight. Maybe this should have been a red flag from the start that there's 2 tvs with hip hop music playing in the background while people are dripping blood from fighting that this really isn't going to be a good Italian restaurant. Like everyone mentions the happy hour prices are great. And when asked what time happy hour is, the bartender said it's all day everyday... cool. Eventually we were at the bar waiting for a table for 30 minutes. Since we were hungry, we decided to eat at the bar. We ordered the Cesar salad and  2 dishes and it came out an hour later!! The salad was $12 and it was literally the saddest thing anyone has ever seen. When the 2 dishes eventually came out- it was drenched in sauce and mozzarella that is for some reason was in shredded shape... so obvious this wasn't fresh. PLEASE PLEASE do not go to this place! We only tried it because it was in the neighborhood, it was raining cats and dogs and the decor seemed nice from the outside.

5.0,4/30/2017,"I came here recently for brunch and to catch up with a good friend - it's definitely off the beaten path of restaurants closer to the subway, but worth walking the few extra blocks.Drinks during brunch are $6 each I believe, or you can opt for the $18 unlimited option for 1.5 hours (I believe it was mimosas, belinis and a peach or mango champagne.) If you're planning on having a few drinks, definitely go for bottomless - our waitress was super attentive and refilled our glasses whenever they hit the half empty mark. I love that they have a good mix of breakfast and lunch options during the day - my friend got a frittata with a side salad, which she loved. I opted to get the bucatini carbonara which was super heavy but really delicious....I basically licked the plate clean.  I spied a neighboring table ordering smoked salmon and avocado crostini - I'm a sucker for all of those ingredients and will definitely get that next time. Portalia goes completely unnoticed from the outside, but the interior is really cute. I love the natural light coming through the skylight in the back along with the plants hanging down over the tables.

I am so glad we were not disappointed by the choice! I had already been here once for a delicious brunch with the husband some long time ago and always said I had to try their dinner... leave it to me to finally do so after having lived two blocks away for so long, now being a mile away. We were immediately served soft bread sticks with a delicious goat cheese tomato sauce that served as a perfect dip. We ordered the Portalia salad to share and I'm glad we did because it included a generous portion. The chicken was grilled to perfection with just the right amount of pesto dressing on the greens. We ordered the ravioli of the day which was butternut squash with a date sauce that was AMAZING! It was very sweet but I am glad that I added a little grated Parmesan and fresh pepper on top to help add that savory element. Needless to say I did not need dessert, besides the fact that I was full my meal felt like a dessert as well. Definitely a good Italian option and as most Italian restaurants are the prices are a bit high so more for a splurge day. The salad was 14 and the ravioli was 18.

We were seated promptly by Antonio, whom I assume is the owner, who was very knowledgeable about his menu and had a very kind-hearted personality. We ended up ordering the Chicken Picatta and my girlfriend had a special Pasta of the Day which was a sweet potato stuffed Gnocchi (I Believe) with some extra things in there with a big glass of Sangria. It was great. My meal was filling and really good - the perfect portion size, honestly - but, and I never do this, I couldn't help but grab a few Gnocchi off her plate - they were fantastic. I had a sip of her Sangria (I wasn't feeling too well to grab a drink myself) and it was very good... I would bet if I got my own drink it'd also be made in a similarly good fashion. Prices are reasonable and I feel the flavor in the meal resonate that. We wanted a more intimate dinner so we sat to the front where there's a few tables (there is a bar and a larger seating area as well, but sometimes you just want to be with locked in to your date) and I loved the artwork on the PORTALIA sign on the wall - it kept bringing me back to a Mediterranean place.

Salmon Benedict wasn't great: egg was cold, english muffin cold and not toasted, bad qualify salmon (edible but not enjoyable) side potatoes no flavor and not crispy. Bloody Mary ok.

The food is amazing, feels like you're in little Italy without taking a train to the city. I was so surprised when the waiters came out with a creme brûlée with a birthday candle on it.

It's end of summer, folks are away - I get it. But that's no excuse for the bartender to be on her phone the entire time at the other end of the bar, and while she is pleasant and friendly, I have to prompt for her attention every time (several times and counting). Again, I get it - we all have lives and I'm not trying to be harsh or anything, but this is/should be straight forward hospitality standard. Moving on people - the music is killer. They're busting out the freshest beats from the 2000s at a very tasteful volume, which in my opinion, makes all the difference.

2.0,8/20/2016,Dreams of a good Italian place gone bust. My best friend and I were super hyped hoping we had found a go to Italian spot but we were disappointed. Let's begin with the fact that the AC in this restaurant is not strong enough to properly cool it to a comfortable level. How can one enjoy a meal sweaty and all. We asked the waiter about the AC and he explained the problem with the strength and that their customers have often complained about this. So if you know about the problem why not fix it owners? Next appetizers the complimentary dipping sauce was perhaps the best thing of the night. We ordered the pear and goat cheese crostini and the polenta. Problem the bread used for the crostini was not crispy and not enough goat cheese the pears were lovely. Find a better bread and put more goat cheese and this would be a home run. Polenta needed seasoning and it was clumpy really this is an Italian restaurant come on. Mains bucatini carbonara overcooked pasta made with cream!!! A real carbonara is not made with cream and it had an off taste like the butter and the bacon were a bit old couldn't place the odd taste. Couldn't eat more than a few bites. The risotto of the day spinach and shrimp. A bit more tasty but again overcooked it was more like porridge. The shrimp in the risotto were fresh though. Would we return sadly Not. Food gets one star the other star was for the wait staff. Shame. Pictures look good of the food but the taste does not match the appearance.,0,0,0,Laura C.,"ELMHURST, NY",31,34,154

It happened to be ravioli stuffed with crab and lobster. I have to say the ravioli was delish and super filling since I couldn't even finish it.I also got to try the pappardelle which was really good.

The food is good and the alcohol isn't watered down like most places, in fact, they pour champagne straight from the bottle and give you a tiny little pitcher filled with orange or peach juice so you can mix it however you like.

1.0,8/10/2016,"This is by far the worst restaurant I've ever been to. My boyfriend and I go to dinner every week together and we always try a new place. First of all - we ordered a Caesar salad which was not on the menu (I can see why). The lettuce was wilted, the croutons were stale and on top of that it was overly salty. We said eh maybe it's not their best options which is why it wasn't listed. I ordered the chicken piccata and my boyfriend ordered linguini with clams.Our dinners came out and both of us just looked at each other. when you get chicken piccata it should be thin slices of chicken. It was ONE large, thick, undercooked piece. It was so rubbery I took one bite and started gagging. My boyfriend said the pasta was terrible. Whatever broth/water/whatever they cooked the clams in they just poured over the pasta and served. The waiter didn't come over one time to ask how everything was. We decided that we would just pay for our food and leave and get dinner somewhere else. On the way out the poor guy asked us if we weren't hungry and why we didn't eat anything. The only, and I do mean ONLY good thing I can say about this place is the décor. It's so cute inside! Unfortunately I will never be returning.",1,0,0,Michelle G.,"New York, NY",0,10,1

I had the sea bass and discovered a hair in my food. I told the waiter and he said he would take it off the check.  After coming back from the ladies room, the owner approached me on the side and said that the hair didn't come from the kitchen and I didn't prove it came from them. I told him I was holding the hair with my fingers as I told the waiter and he didn't ask for it. I asked if he was calling me a liar and he said no but it's not from his staff and he would NOT remove it from the check. Both he and the waiter said ""ok, don't come back here then"".  Wow nice way to treat your customers. They obviously just care about one thing and it's definitely not customer satisfaction or cleanliness. On top of the terrible service they went ahead and added a 20% gratuity. Right.

Service is awesome. Our server was a guy, very polite and attentive. Now, the bad... Don't ever expect your meat to be cooked as you asked for. The first time I was here I thought I couldn't explain myself so they gave me my meat undercooked. Well, every time I go, the same thing happens.

My friend and I shared the caprese salad (which was so amazingly fresh) and I had the pappardelle. I would eat that every day if I lived in the area. The noodles were large but delicate. The sauce was smooth and creamy. It was a large portion but so worth the extremely full stomach afterwards. The bread and sauce that comes before your meal is also surprisingly delicious. Could almost be a meal by itself. The staff were all so warm and on top of everything. Always refilled waters promptly, cleared away finished plates, brought the menus and bill promptly. Also, we liked the decor inside. Not overly done or cheesy. Nice casual atmosphere but also classy. A mix of modern and old styles.

I've been here several times and i always sit by the window when I go. It's beautiful on rainy days and sunny days alike. The service has always been good as well as the food. For my carnivores, the pork chop with black cabbage is a sure winner. It's the size of something out of the Flintstones but it is tender and delicious. The pasta with quail egg is also good. I don't think i've ever had a dish that I didn't like here, the food has always been good. The drinks are a different story. This is not a place that i would recommend a drink, and when i say drink i mean liquor. The wine i imagine is fine, but anything that requires the bartender to mix, i would skip. I've had several ""too sweet"", ""too watery"", ""too something"" every time. And i'm not picky. I'll drink and eat almost anything (lol) but this place just can't get the drinks right, so i stick to the food and i get my drinks elsewhere.

The outside had a bit of a crisp to it, and the inside was warm and juicy- Fried calamari: surprise - they came with a few fried zucchini pieces. Pretty good serving size and overall, they were pretty crispy- Lobster ravioli: I like that they make their own pastas, buuuut I was expecting this to be a bit thinner. filling was great, and the cherry tomatoes helped balance everything out. - Ricotta cheese cake: I was a little iffy about the fig ice cream, but it totally works!

THIS IS THE BRUNCH SPOT! The interior is polished and pleasant; we sat by the windows which let in a lot of natural light. The general ambiance was definitely just a plus. Their menu was not extensive but had many quality dishes to choose from. Their brunch alcohol deal is unlimited bellinis, mimosas, or bloody marys for $15. This is deal is 100% worth the price which is already reasonable IMO. The servers are very attentive and were constantly refilling our glasses with champagne and gave us a little cup of OJ to add ourselves. French Toast- this dish was delightful! It was cooked to a perfect toasty/crunchy texture and tasted like speculoos. The struggle with French toast for me is dealing with the sogginess especially after the syrup but this place has figured out how to keep the bread moist but not a soggy mush. Salmon Burger- the flavor of the burger was delicious as well. The salmon patty had great flavor and went well with the arugula in it. The dish also comes with great crispy fries. Steak and Eggs- the dish was underwhelming. It wasn't bad but it wasn't anything special at all. This dish has the option of sweet potato friesAvocado toast- it comes topped with avocado, an egg, and bacon bits. A single piece of toast is $6 and I didn't find anything great about this side. I could take it or leave it. Bottom line I absolutely love this place! 10/10 would (and will) come again!",3,1,2,Sylvia K.,"Fresh Meadows, Queens, NY",616,32,65

This restaurant is a great place to get turnt in a classy way (if that makes any sense) For $15, you can have unlimited mimosa, bellini or bloody mary for two hours. What I LOVE about this place is that they refill your drinks so fast, you literally don't see the bottom of your glass. On top of this super attentive service, they also have delicious brunch menu. French toast- crunchy and savory. recommend Salmon burger- huuge portion and it comes with amazingg/super crispy french fries. recommendSteak and egg- meh i would get smth else. avocado and egg on whole wheat toast- ugh just yas. they only give you one toast though.I would definitely visit this place again.",2,1,3,Sophie P.,"New York, NY",154,99,142

For dinner we ordered the Ravioli of the day, pappardelle, branzino, and a veal cutlet. All looked spectacular, my dish the Pappardelle did not disappoint and I would highly recommend.We followed with vodka martinis, all well executed, followed by espresso and desserts: cheesecake, crem brûlée, panda cota, chocolate cake.

5.0,2/14/2016,"Getting a reservation for Valentine's Day dinner, the day of, was pretty easy. Only issue, no one informed us that they were serving a Valentine's Day special (select) menu. But no worries, there are several delectable options to choose from. We chose to go with the Autumn Pear Salad with Candied Walnuts and Balsamic Vinaigrette (torn between that and the salmon tartar). Salad was refreshing and light. For the main course, we went with the lamb chops and squid ink lobster stuffed ravioli.  The name suggests that too much is going on in be ravioli dish but the chef executed it to perfection. Unfortunately, neither dish is on their regular menu but after asking the sever, they do occasionally roll them out as specials.  To wrap up dinner and pair with the complementary champagne we decided to share a passion fruit mousse.Dinner was fantastic. The staff was fantastic. The decor was fantastic.

4.0,1/23/2016,"Drunch Review!Came on a Sunday afternoon with reservation, but it wasn't needed as the place wasn't super packed. They have a lot of options for brunch entrees from typical eggs benny to what they're known for - pasta. Our party of 7 got a wide variety of things and it seems like the more brunchy items are a smaller portion. I got eggs benny with crab cakes, they were good, but on the smaller side. So to the more important topic - the unlimited drinks. For an additional $15, you can get unlimited bloody marys, mimosas, bellinis, or straight champagne with your entree (or for $3 per drink). Specify before you order because they give you a gold rimmed champagne glass if you're doing unlimited (we didn't, so we had to call them over for refills in the beginning). It's fun because they fill (often overfilling) your glass with the champagne and give you a small thing of orange/peach juice for you to our yourself. Service is great, our waiter was funny and on top of filling up our glasses. He even brought out another bloody mary for our friend when his glass was basically still full.",1,0,1,Connie L.,"New York, NY",38,375,184

Wine selection was nice and the bar area seemed to fill up fast.I would give this place 5 stars, but the service seemed just a little slow (maybe the food takes a while to cook).

4.0,1/6/2016,"To kick off the new year, our group of six came for Saturday brunch and have a bit of fun. Surprisingly, at 1130, the restaurant was still empty. We all arrived at different times but they let us sit at the table and wait for the rest of our party. No rush or dirty looks (but that makes sense since we're the only ones there).Brunch prices were fair, with prices ranging between $10-$20 depending on the meal. You can add on the endless drinks for 2 hours option for $15, and they don't force everyone at the table to add on the option. They let you switch between mimosas, champagne, bellinis, and bloody marys. No exaggeration, our glasses were NEVER empty. I'd drink perhaps a third of the glass and they would come top it off with champagne right away. Even as we got ready to leave, they offered us a few more glasses as we waited to finish paying the bill.If you order champagne, they'll give you peach syrup and orange juice on the side for you to make your own mix, if you do so please. The mimosa was surprisingly quite sour so getting the champagne is definitely a better choice so you can adjust to your own liking. The bloody mary was pretty delicious - slightly chunky with a lot of black pepper (not so fun biting into black pepper though so careful with that). It was a great way to end the meal (specifically, great way to cut the edge from drinking all that champagne). Unfortunately, despite all that we drank (can't even count how many glasses since they kept refilling), the drinks were fairly weak so everyone left pretty sober.As a side note, they serve Illy coffee for $3. It smelled delicious. So fragrant. Great pick me up as we waited for our food/drinks.There are a few pasta options on the brunch menu with pretty good portions. I had the pappardelle - homemade noodles in a creamy tomato sauce. It was like eating sliced non-layered lasagna, or for you Asians, like eating chow fun in a tomato sauce. Good sauce, and the pasta is silky, but nothing to really rave about. Friend ordered the linguine, it looked and smelled delicious with quite a bit of clams in it. The taglioni also looked pretty amazing but didn't get to try it.Another friend had the salmon burger and raved about it. Even at well done, the burger looked very juicy. Comes with a side of fries as well. Their pancakes were also super fluffy and quite dense. One order of pancakes would fill you up without ordering anything else.Friends also ordered the eggs benedict with crab cakes. This was unfortunately meh. Two eggs, two crab cakes, and some salad. Yes, that's pretty typical for an order of eggs benedict, but it just was not filling enough compared to everyone else's order. The crab cakes were also nothing to rave about.Service though was good. Like I said, our glasses were never empty. At the beginning, our server had great charisma and really sold the food. Everything sounded delicious. Unfortunately, more people started coming in so his attention shifted away from us to accommodate the other tables (but he was the only waiter at that time so no judgment there). A good portion of the time, it was the busboys that were refilling our drinks. We were never rushed to finish our food (it did take a while to come out though) and never rushed to stop drinking.Ambiance was great. Not ridiculously loud music, although a little odd choice of music (current top hits). A rustic homey feel/decor. Bathrooms are down some stairs though. Not sure how safe that is if anyone does get drunk on the endless drinks.TL;DR - go early for brunch, order champagne or bloody mary, get a burger or pasta. 3.5-4 because the food and drinks really aren't all that special but they're nothing to complain about. Service overall was good and we had a great experience there. Would definitely consider coming back again the next time we want local bottomless brunch.",0,0,0,Janice R.,"Flushing, NY",101,14,25

At first the staff seemed a little overwhelmed, but I have to say they recovered and handled it well. Bottomless mimosas/Bellini's/ bloody mary's for only $15 for 2 hours- I love the way they offer the bottomless- although Bloody Mary's are made at the bar, the Mimosas/Bellini's are a little unique- they constantly fill your glass with champagne and give you a small cup of either orange of peach juice. BEST IDEA EVER. I had the shrimp dish which was pretty good. Nothing out of this world, but good. If we weren't getting our buzz on we probably would've been pissed about the wait, but at least they had the mimosa's coming!We brought a cake, they sang happy birthday, and the staff, again, were very pleasant. There's just one little thing. As we were leaving, the waitress had to kill a roach in between our table and the table over.... the poor girl at the other table almost screamed, but the waitress quickly handled it...

It did end up being over $12 for a relatively small slice, but our server was wonderful and cheery. He even put a candle on top and sang happy birthday to her as he brought it out. There were very few people in the restaurant so the bartender was chatting away to one of the other patrons and the servers and host were talking to other customers in the space.

4.0,9/27/2015,"Portalia surprised me. My first impression upon walking in for brunch was that this restaurant is a bit confused. They're clearly going for a trendy atmosphere with warm wood tones everywhere and the huge bar being the main focal point, but the top 40 rap/R&B playlist seems to clash, as does the almost kitschy ""Portalia"" lettering hanging on the wall in front. Usually these would have been red flags for me because in my own experience, restaurants' identity crises tend to carry over into the cooking -- but that wasn't the case at Portalia! My date had the burger and though it fell apart halfway through, he said it was very good otherwise. The fries that came with were also really, really good. I had the linguine alla vongole which was huge with tons of clams -- well priced at $16, too. I was stuffed by the end. Brunch drinks are $4 each or $15 for 2-hr unlimited.

Our server was professional and did his best to keep everyone happy.  With that said I feel that the kitchen needs to work on their timing.  3 of our 5 appetizers came out together and the remaining 2 came out at least 5 minutes later.  Our entrees came out in 3 waves and took way too long in between each wave.  Dishes need to be served at the same time.  As for the food, it was quite good. Our table shared a variety of appetizers.Crab cakes served with a salad and red pepper sauce.  Nice crisp on the outside and loaded with tender crab on the inside, very enjoyable.Grilled Calamari served with red onion, cannelini beans, green beans, tomatoes seasoned with olive oil and lemon.  The calamari was tender and the ingredients worked well together, and while good it was a bit on the bland side.Mussels in a white wine sauce were cooked well and had a hint of smoke to them.Meatballs were tasty in a wonderful tomato sauce that was great for sopping up with some bread.Poletna with mushrooms was my absolute favorite.  Creamy polenta (which you almost never see) was decadent topped with mushrooms, it was all so savory and divine and fantastic.  I would return just to eat this dish again.Entrees were all good sized portions.  The Fettuccine (which was actually linguine) with bolognese was comforting with great flavor.  The skirt steak was delicious as was the pork chop.Dessert we had the Affogato.  A bowl of vanilla gelato with espresso poured over, if you like coffee and have never tried it, you need to.  It's scrumptious.All in all it was a lovely meal and that we all enjoyed; if the flow of the food can be improved it would be a smart move to become great.",2,1,3,Krista M.,"Kew Gardens, NY",353,719,289

I sent it back.  The third time it was still rare.  I sent it back. The fourth time they brought me a new steak and it was delicious.  If they could have only gotten it right the first,  or even second time, I would have been happy.  The owner came and talked with us and was very apologetic.  He bought us desserts and a glass of wine.  It was nice but still aggravating and dampened the night as we had limited time because we had a baby sitter watching our child.  I have to mention that it was the first time we had ever used a baby sitter.   So we returned tonight with our toddler and my in-laws. The idea is to rush when you have a toddler in tow.  Upon arrival we were told we had a ten minute wait that actually ended up being closer to a half hour.  It's fine,  it happens.  Can't predict how long someone will sit for.  We told the hostess that we were going to want to order immediately or even before we sat if she knew the table was opening up.  We were not given that opportunity.  We were just sat when a table was freed up.  Waiter came over and we told him we were ready to order.  It took over a half hour for the food to come and we were told that it was because the filet took a long time.  We responded ""you know it's supposed to be cooked medium right?"" To which he said ""we have a large party with a lot of meals"". So it wasn't the filet,  it was having a large party.  For the record,  the restaurant was almost full but there was nobody else waiting for a table.  When the food came my wife asked them to bag her food to go and she left with our toddler as he had been there for to long already and was getting loud. She wasn't  happy. The food: my filet was really good and cooked properly.  The roasted vegetables, that I ordered to replace the spinach,  were  great. The mashed potatoes...were forgotten and I had to ask them bring them out.   How do you forget to put the potatoes on the plate?   My father in law ordered the meatball panini. They brought him an order of meatballs.  Not the sandwich.  When we asked the waiter about it he said ""no that is what you ordered"".  When he returned I questioned him about the panini being a sandwich.  He asked us to hold on and went to speak to the owner that had spoken with us on our first visit.  The owner came over,  apologized and offered the correct meal.  The other two meals were good. They were chicken parm and spaghetti and meatballs.  If this place can get their act together we'd return but the good food is over shadowed by the poor service.  First visit we thought it was just an off night.   Second visit makes us hesitant to return.  It is very close to where we live and I'd really like this place to clean up their act because the food is actually good when it's the right meal and served as ordered.  Sigh...",0,0,0,Gregory F.,"Astoria, NY",7,18,0

3.0,4/29/2015,"Table for 16! We made a reservation, therefore we were seated immediately. It wasn't too busy on that Saturday night so I guess it was okay to reserve such a large table. Okay, being seated immediately made me happy but everything went downhill from there.We ordered, I understand that since it's a huge party, the food might take quite some time, BUT 1.5 hours?! HOW? What are you cooking up in there? The worst part was when they keep coming to us, saying ""the food is going to come in 20 mins, 10 mins, 'soon'."" Bringing my hopes up but smashing it down to the ground right afterwards. The food finally came; and it was warm, win! I ordered the veal scappolini. It was soooo salty. I had to wash every bite down with water. I didn't even bother complaining because I was too hungry to wait for them to make another order. We waited 1.5 hours for our food but we finished everything within 15 mins - it was actually really funny to me. What a waste of time. I do want to compliment the appetizers though. They came out so early on in the evening that sometimes I forget I ordered it. We ordered the calamari and crab cakes. Calamari was fried perfectly and the sauce was good. Crab cakes were amazing!! So much crab meat and also prepared perfectly. Ahhhh, I should've just ordered the crab cakes as my entree. The fries were really good too!It's very easy to find street parking around the area.

It was for a double birthday brunch. They graciously sat us, with a promise the rest of our party would arrive :) The did and everyone was happy.The waitress made sure all of our glasses were filled for the whole 2 hour brunch. (can I BOLD this?!)However, there was a little disconnect when ordering. I asked for the Portalia, then was asked if I wanted the burger or the pizza. But the description was clearly of a salad, and nothing else on the brunch menu was called Portalia. Also, the Portalia (salad) called for avocado pesto dressing which I was really looking forward too. Nope, just a little oil and vinegar with a dash of seasonings and avocado ganished.The Romain and mescaline salad also had some mescaline that should have clearly been thrown out.To get a little more picky, I suppose if the walnuts were sugar roasted, the dish would have delivered more of a brunch flavor profile.I will tell you this; despite having a few hiccups with my dish, the aptitude of the service will always bring me and friends back.Everyone left happy :)",3,2,2,Mitch B.,"Orange County, CA",863,127,392

This was my second time dining at the restaurant and we had such a good time!I thought it was nice that we were seated even though half of the group didn't arrive until about 30 min later. We took advantage of the bottomless brunch special which was a choice of breakfast and lunch options and an additional $15 for unlimited drinks (bellinis, mimosas, or Bloody Mary's). Entrees ranged from $10-$15. I had the French toast which was crusted with brown sugar, topped with powdered sugar, and finished with cinnamon. There were blueberries, strawberries, and blackberries on top to sweeten up the dish. I thought the meal was tasty but almost slightly burnt. I finished it anyway. My friends all ordered different items from the brunch menu and everyone enjoyed their meals. The service was fantastic. We never had to look for the waitress and our drinks were always filled. The waitress was kind enough to send our dessert with candles for our friends' birthday which made it extra special. If you go you have to sit in the front by the open French windows or in the back where there is a nice sun view that makes you feel like you're in a courtyard in Italy.

2.0,4/10/2015,"Portalia, what happened to you?! Something seems very odd about this place, it is nowhere near the place I have previously raved about. Everything started normally enough. We sat, we ordered and we waited to receive our favorite crackolicious sauce and bread, but, when they put the basket down we were bummed. Gone is the sauce and bread basket we've grown a Pavlovian response to; in its place olive oil and pieces of plain bread grilled in a sad attempt to seem appealing. We felt like kids on Xmas who ripped through wrapping paper in hopes of revealing a shiny new toy but received generic underwear and socks. Now, let's talk entrées. My gf ordered the tried and true branzino while I opted for a hearty steak panini. Having had the branzino before my gf thought she knew what she was getting but when the dish came out it was a sad version of its old self. Even more upsetting it was riddled with bones and I kid you not, even SCALES! The piece of fish was probably half the portion that it once was and even so my gf did not finish it.As for my steak panini (if I can call it a panini as there were no grill marks and the bread was pretty much a roll), it was fine enough...when I actually chewed into a piece of steak that is. The filling was so anemic that at times it looked as if I was having a vegetarian sandwich. Halfway through I abandoned the bread and just ate the steak. This truly was upsetting to us so much so that we even inquired if there had been a change in management or ownership. My hope is that the former Portalia will return but until then, I think we are done here.  Oh and just as I neared finishing this review I started experiencing a terrible stomach ache.",1,0,0,Mal M.,"Queens, NY",0,30,33
2.0,4/9/2015,My mother made a reservation for 17 people for Easter Sunday and my big birthday (not saying what number) for my closest family members based on my recommendation as I have been here at least four or five times. When we got there at 2 the tables were not ready and the owner snootily and snarkily told my mother that they don't do parties nor take reservations on Sundays because of brunch and whomever took the reservation made a mistake even though my mother called a few days before to confirm and ask them if they could hold the birthday cake in the refrigerator.They at least 20 minutes later gave us two tables across from each other and not alongside each other so that we were separated and it was like we were not together at all. The attitude of the owner was as if he didn't care at all.

When I ordered a cake for my mother's birthday, since we didn't order a desert they didn't even us anything. They should of gave us a desert on house after all we were the only table. Oh and I can't forget how terrible the service was. The diet coke came 15minutes later. I could understand if it was busy but no it was dead. The chef definitely changed.

2.0,4/5/2015,"Full disclosure: it was a very busy Easter brunch for them. WARNING: they do not do reservations for brunch. Apparently, a hostess from the previous night didn't get the memo. A large part of WHY we went in the first place was due to the fact that they took a reservation for brunch on Easter. We were surprised/impressed. Anyway, when we showed up very hungry expecting to be immediately seated, they apologized for the confusion and insisted they would seat us asap. We were seated about 30 minutes later. We were confused by people walking in after us being seated before us.As for the food, everything was visually appealing but.... my wife's Salmon Benedict lacked flavor (it neither had smokiness not seasoning). My Portalia Burger (mind you, it carries their namesake) was ordered medium rare. It came out medium raw. None of the proteins had bonded inside. It was pure, pliable ground mush. Seared and served. I asked for the problem to be fixed. They generously left me the fries which were great.When the burger came back (after my friends had all finished their meals), it was well done (as were the fries this time). Apparently medium rare is the unicorn of temperatures. I would have been fine with medium. Dry and crispy? No thanks. I would have sent it back again if my friends weren't ready to leave. I guess I'd have to suggest they leave such a great sounding burger off the menu if it can't be served to temperature during peak hours. At least they didn't charge us for it.

As soon as I walked in a young woman greeted me and I asked if the kitchen was still open and should have known from the response it was going to be a great experience. She said we're open until midnight come on in! We immediately sat down and ordered immediately as we were completely starved. Our waiter was super attentive and very very pleasant. Now onto the food...I ordered the Bistecca, skirt steak, fingerling potatoes and arugula. My pet peeve is when I order medium steak and receive the driest piece of filth. This skirt steak was perfect! So juicy! The potatoes were good but could use a little salt. Not sure what type of dressing was on the arugula but it was tasty! My boyfriend had the pork chops with red cabbage and caramelized apples...he cut that pork chop like it was butter! I tasted his pork chop and man oh man was it delish!

I have tried the crab cake benedict, the salmon burger, the pancetta benedict and the bistecca panini. Out of these, I think the crab cake benedict was my favorite, but I liked the salmon burger as well. We got the unlimited drinks deal which when we went included bloody marys, mimosas, champagne.. and maybe sangria? I can't remember. On the first visit, the bloody marys were GREAT and when I switched to mimosas, they were ok, though mostly oj. On the second go, the bloody marys were tomato juice with no spice/flavor. I usually don't complain and I know that when you offer an unlimited deal, there tends to be mass batches made so sometimes it doesn't always balance out, but I'm still paying for it.. so I did call the waitress over and she topped it off with a little more vodka, but it was just ""eh"" til we added more tobasco and pepper. I thought maybe the second round would be better since we had commented the first round, but nope.. I switched to mimosas cause I figured it would be easier to handle.The food on the second go wasn't as tasty as we wanted, either and there was barely any pancetta on the benedict.

Simply a heavenly combination. The service was great, our waiter was super attentive an funny, yea we loved that. Did I mention how incredibly affordable this place is? Just with the decor, dim lights and food, anywhere else they'd charge a lot more for a plate of pasta. I went with two other friends and together we ordered 2 specialty drinks 3 entrees, a side of veggies and 3 desserts. I was expecting the check to be around $200, but Nope nowhere close. We were shocked at how economic it was. I guess we were so amazed with the food that we knew it was worth a lot more than what we were paying. The only thing that I wish was a little better are the drinks, although everything in them was fresh, the flavors didn't come together quite as well as everything else. That's the only reason I'd give Portalia 4 stars, but for the food, it's already got 10 stars in my book. Can't wait to go back and be amazed once again!

The ambiance was quite lovely - dim lighting, rose petals on tables, even some romantic pop/R&B music playing faintly in the background. Our server was friendly and often checked up on us.  Upon seating and ordering, the bus boy immediately served us sourdough and a raisin/walnut bread with a tomato bisque-like sauce to start. It was delicious. We started with the Valentine special ""Beet""ing heart salad - beets, goat cheese mousse, walnuts, orange wedges, and baby arugula. YUM! Excellent start. For my entree I had the fazzoletti - thin scraps of pasta with saffron and veal ragu. To say the least, I finished the entire thing. My boyfriend ordered the gnocchi, which was too salty and creamy for my liking but he enjoyed it. For dessert, we shared the strawberry shortcake special.

I would put more stars if it wasn't for the rest of the service experience that was lacking. My girlfriend and I came in on Valentine's Day. It was a snowy day so traffic and the subways were very delayed. We had a reservation at 6 and called at 5:45 to let them know we would be a little late. The hostess who picked up said it would be fine and no problem! We get to the restaurant and go up to the hostess. I knew it was this hostess because she was the same person who answered the phone when I called. We apologized for being a little late again but said that we had called and mentioned we were running late with the traffic delays. She gave us a look and said that we were late and they were turning the tables in two hour sections. She then switched over to saying we could wait until 8 pm for a table. We were looking forward to a great night at Portalia, but she made us feel like we were being inconvenient. We felt really bad for being late but we had specifically made a reservation and also called when we knew we would be a little late. And when we got to the restaurant, the hostess made it seem like we would lose our table. She finally reluctantly gave us our table and we sat down. But the experience was already kind of ruined for the night. We were so excited to come and now I feel like that night could have been much better if we went somewhere else.

The owner came and greeted us warmly, and told us how the restaurant was named - such a cute story!  He was trying to decide on the name, and his son said to merge their two cultures together - Portugal and Italy, and Portalia was born.  Service was quick and great - no pressures.  Food - delicious.  Drinks - crisp and fresh.  Throw in two amazing friends in holiday cheer and it was just a perfect NYC night out.  We are already planning our next get-together here.",0,0,0,Dani H.,"ASTORIA, NY",3,7,0

Wonderful food- excellent service- priced accordingly for quality , well prepared, high end ingredients. I will be going back - the next time to dine in!",0,0,0,Suzanna W.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,0

4.0,12/20/2014,"I recently had my brunch bridal shower here and the day of was perfect. We had the back area reserved and the waitress, I think her name was Christina, was outstanding. She went above and beyond for me and our guests. The food took a little while to get but once everyone had their food there were only rave reviews. I've been here for brunch before and was always happy with the food and service so when it came time to pick a place for the bridal shower this was the first place I thought of.If you're thinking of having an event here, here are some of the learnings my maid of honor learned while planning:- spoke with Antonio (the owner) first to set the date and start getting pricing. We secured the date, the cost per person, and the area where our party would be seated. Antonio said he'd work with us on a good rate for the addition brunch hour since their special is only for two hours.  The conversation was great and it kicked off the planning. We were also really excited that they were not charging a fee to secure the back area. Everything sounded great. From here we were handed over to their on site event planner . . . - the Planner is where I think service is lacking. Looking though some reviews it looks like we aren't the only ones. She quoted my friend at a higher rate, said we had to pay a fee for the space and because the date was now in high demand. We wanted to bring a cake in and they wanted to charge $2 per slice. This would have made the cutting of the cake more than it actually cost . . . Also if you have a large group they cut down the menu and you have to pick from a few items. It didn't end up being a big deal but it's just something to keep in mind. - we visited the restaurant the day before to make sure everything was set. We went in and luckily for us Antonio was there. We talked through some issues that we had with the planner and questions we had. He reassured us he would be there the day of party which made us feel much more comfortable. Like I said, the day of was great. The food and service (Antonio and all the wait staff) all get 5 stars but the experience with the planner made me go down a star. If you're looking for dinner, brunch or a get together with a group this restaurant will meet your expectations.",2,0,0,Edith G.,"Astoria, NY",12,110,10

May not be universally appealing but unique.2. Calamari: FRESH ASS seafood. You can taste it in how soft it was! Very tasty!! The little pieces of fried veg in here is nice.3. Pappardelle in cheesy tomato sauce- delicious!! It gets tiring to eat halfway through tho:x at first it doesn't seem like a lot but it's very very filling, I had enough for lunch the next day!4. Mixed Seafood pasta: They were accommodating to sub in a different type of noodle, and again... Fresh ass seafood. It was also plentiful. Very good although on the salty side5. Creme brûlée was okay... Skip on that one. I felt so welcome in this restaurant, and overall loved the food. The prices are extremely fair for what and how much you get. Quality is here!!

The Hostess showed us that there is no reservations on the books and it should be fine but will have the owner call us to confirm. He did after a few hours that evening and confirmed our affair can happen but he will confirm with the office manager and call back the next day by 12pm.  (sign #1)3pm came the next day and still no response. So I called for the office Manager and she confirmed we are good to book. She asked me to email her my CC info to put a deposit down since her desk was too messy to take over phone (sign #2). Once I emailed her the info she replied back in 15 mins saying they can not make the booking! A few exchanges of trying to find out why and all said was there are small reservations and we can not accommodate you in the big back area. So then why say yes? Then dead silence with no responses received! Can not believe this is how people are running their business operations. Being a restaurant manager for many years, this is an embarrassment to the industry!  I now am keeping a close watch on my credit card for fraudulent activity by them.Thanks for not-keeping it classy Portalia.. now my family, nor my 16 guests that day, will ever step foot into Portalia.",3,1,0,Andriana S.,"ASTORIA, NY",1,8,8

I have ordered delivery from the restaurant once before and decided to wait until I had an actual restaurant experience to review. My delivery order a month or so back was amazing, the pappardelle pasta was delicious (so fresh) and the calamari didn't arrive chewy at all, unlike I have had experiences with take out before. Last night, I was accompanied by three adults and my toddler. We made last minute reservations, about a half hour prior to our arrival and had no issues what so ever. The place is beautiful and has a great ambiance. The waiter was extremely friendly and sweet to my baby girl (I've had servers not acknowledge her or seem annoyed in the past). Our server informed us of the specials for the evening and two of us ended up ordering two lobster ravioli topped with scallops in a saffron sauce and MY GOODNESS...it was amazing. A part of my top two lobster ravioli  experiences Ever. We also tried the grilled shrimp endive salad and it was SO delicious. My boyfriend had the salmon, and loved it. The Sauvignon Blanc was delicious and didn't hurt my pocket at $7 for a generous pour. I loved my experience so much, that I returned the very next night with my mother and daughter. She herself is a lobster ravioli LOVER so I crossed my fingers and hoped they were still featuring the special and with our luck they were! I definitely would have been excited to try another entree if it weren't available.

I have never had veal that cut like butter. Portion size was perfect - some might think large, but with how good it was, there was no shot at leftovers.

I went with the Estrella like she suggested and she let me taste the Angry Orchard, which is a hard cider that almost has a prosecco like quality to it. I'm not a fan of ciders, but that was good.The pasta, for $12, was probably as good as I could've asked for in that price range. Not the freshest or best quality penne, but it was cooked al dente and the spicy tomato sauce was done well also. The bits of grilled chicken was a bit dry but since there was a fair amount of sauce in the dish, it wasn't too bad.I really enjoyed the one hour I had to myself at this place.

The waiter only came around to ask if we wanted anything else to drink. One of the bust boys refills your water constantly, which is the only nice thing about the service. Food- The food was mediocre, if not poor. For an appetizer, we ordered the fried calamari, and the caprese salad. Ehhhh... one of the tomatoes was yellow....For our entree, I ordered the bisteccc (skirt steak). I specifically asked for medium rare, only to have a well done steak. I was hesitant about returning it, as it already took 1 hour for our food to arrive. My friends ordered the seafood pasta, and all they said was ""TOOO SALTY"" At the end, I bought a cake from the outside. BE CAREFUL, apparently its $2 per person for them to cut.

Just from walking in the first time, I liked the gold and brown colors, the light lighting, and the overall look. But the food and the service is what really makes this Astoria's best. Portalia is one of the best brunch spots in all of the city!! I recommend the BISTECCA PANINI, a skirt steak sandwich with fresh mozzarella. I choose this sandwich almost every time I've come for brunch and its always juicy and delicious. The steak and ingredients are always fresh and it comes with some pretty tasty fries as well!! My second favorite would be the PORTALIA BURGER! It is extremely juicy with onions, bacon, and mozzarella.A dinner at Portalia is also top class. First, when you sit down the waiters brings fresh breads and a bowl of hot marinara sauce with goat cheese for the table. Its a nice touch that you really don't really see anywhere else. Then I usually get the fried calamari which is always nice and crispy instead of the soggy stuff usually find. Then for my main, I usually get the skirt steak which comes with roasted potatoes or the pork chop with red cabbage. The skirt steak is really gamey and packs tons of flavor while the pork chop is almost outdone by its side, the red cabbage with bacon!!! Overall, This place has really high quality food, especially for being a restaurant in Astoria.",0,0,0,Mike K.,"Campbell, CA",198,107,0

4.0,2/19/2014,"I've been coming to Portalia for about 2 years now, pretty consistently since they opened, so this review is long overdue. Portalia is one of the best brunch spots in the neighborhood and a dependable destination for quality Italian fare, joining the [Astorian] ranks of Vesta and Via Trenta. While it can be difficult to choose between the three, Portalia is definitely your spot if you roll deep; they can easily accommodate groups of 8-12 people. And even if you don't travel with an entourage, the elegantly earthy yet homey Tuscan ambience of the restaurant makes it a great spot to bring a date or treat the parents. I really wish they'd get rid of those two giant flat screens behind the bar though. Why, Portalia, why?BRUNCH (weekend 11am-4pm):Portalia's brunch menu includes a wide range of brunch classics and heavier lunch options. Just the eggs benedict alone gives you a choice of canadian bacon, pancetta, smoked salmon, crab cakes, or spinach and gorgonzola. Standouts on the menu are the French toast, eggs benedict (with crab cakes!), both burgers, and of course the pasta. Pass on the pancakes*, paninis**, and pizzas***. Mimosas, bellinis, and bloody marys are just $3 each, and you can do bottomless drinks for $15, though I'm not sure WHY you'd do bottomless unless you're planning on having at least 5 drinks (6+ to make it a deal o_O). Also keep in mind that refills on coffee aren't free; you will be charged per coffee ordered.DINNER:Dinner at Portalia always hits the spot. I love the gratis starter: warm goat cheese and marinara sauce to accompany the bread, though it now hits the table pre-mixed which takes a lot of the fun out of it, but I suppose too many people didn't know to mix it. Portalia makes a solid rendition of my favorite pasta dish, linguine alla vongole (baby clams, cherry tomatoes, pinot grigio) - seasoned just enough to let the clams shine, though I wish there was a touch more broth. And I've also discovered a new favorite in Portalia's fazzoletti allo zafferano (rough cut pasta with saffron and veal ragu) - the meaty ragu is hearty perfection. Portalia's risotto of the day is usually a safe bet and a must if it's paired with their osso buco. There was one time (out of maybe four or five times) where the risotto was too loose, but I'll chalk that up to a fluke because the other times it was the perfect consistency. If you still have stomach space after your entrée, don't pass up on dessert! Their apple tart and their flourless chocolate cake are both killer.Note: closed Mondays*best pancakes in Astoria: Sweet Afton**best paninis in Astoria: Il Bambino***best brunch pizza in Astoria: Diwine",16,6,13,Amy S.,"Astoria, NY",272,308,2490

They had this one drink at happy hour that I absolutely LOVED - it was a passionfruit martini with a shot of Prosecco on the side.  It was both affordable and delicious and when I changed jobs and wasn't seeing the same group of friends as often anymore, it was definitely one of the things I missed.  I finally got a chance to come back here about two weeks ago, and was sad to see that my favorite drink had been taken off the menu. My bartender was very sweet, and she still made me one at the happy hour price anyway, but the happy hour drink selection just wasn't as good as it used to be.

Their staff was able to accommodate our party of seven without a reservation easily, and the service was on point all night. The restaurant owner even came by several times to check if everything was to our satisfaction. FOOD: For our appetizers, my boyfriend and I shared the Torta di Granchio and Prosciutto Di Parma Peperoni & Mozzarella. I was disappointed that for $12, you only received two tiny crabcakes. But it was quickly redeemed by how fresh/soft/delicious the mozzarella was. As for our entrée, we both ordered the Osso Buco special. The lamb was very tender, and the sauce was fantastic. But was it worth $36 per plate? I don't think so.DRINKS: Their special that night was the Blackberry Sangria. It came in a glass and carafe, which easily poured another two servings. You can definitely taste the brandy, and hints of brown sugar.. delicious! Their Passion Fruit Martini is very agreeable, as well.Overall, I really liked Portalia.

I think they have an option for an entree, one mimosa/Bloody Mary and a coffee/tea for 15$ which we never go for because let's be honest, you need way more than just one mimosa. But either way both options are a steal. The service is pretty good, and the food is amazing. You can tell everything is freshly made.

I personally love eager servers, while at the same time providing a down to earth personality, which is what Portalia succeeded in. In my field of competitive spinal implant sales I am required to entertain spinal surgeons. I couldn't pick a better place for this, especially on the weekends. I am able to have dinner and talk buisness, and as dessert comes the music begins to play louder and our party moves to the bar for some of the best cocktails and great entertainment.

We enjoyed happy hour pricing on a few drinks and an appetizer (fried calamari - which tasted surprisingly light and fresh). Our bartender, Olga, was professional, attentive and sweet (and had a generous pour - my favorite part).For our main course we ordered the ravioli of the day in Alfredo sauce and a salmon burger with avocado - both outstanding!The owner, Antonio, took the time to greet and to get to know his customers.

I gave it two stars for two things, great ambience and amazing Tiramasu. But, we'll get to the dessert later. Since we were a party of 20 we had a prix-fixe menu which makes it easier all around, I had the calamari which was chewy and kind of bland for my first course. For my main entreé I chose the Risotto with sausage and broccoli rabé. Bad choice on my part, for an Italian restaurant they DID NOT know how to make a risotto, it was unflavorful, with no taste at all. The only good part of my experience came next, chocolate molten cake and tiramasu. All the wait staff seemed eager at first, coming over taking drink orders, bread was brought out right away but then two gentlemen who were not dressed in a uniform started to help our flustered waiters which fine, managers or owners should help but then some teenage looking kid with a Stewie shirt started helping and I felt like they got him from outside walking on Broadway.

I came here with 3 friends and was looking forward to finding a new favorite spot in Astoria. The service was incredibly slow. We had to order drinks a few times with a few different people, before they finally arrived. We asked for silverware at least three times, and the server started clearing our table before we had finished our appetizer. I ordered the fish of the day- Mediterranean branzino, and asked for it to be clean- no bones, no tail, no eyes. I wasn't joking. It came with all attached. My friend asked to sub her potatoes with mixed vegetables. The server confirmed this was fine- her plate came with potatoes. When we were finally ready for the check, getting the servers attention required getting up out of our seat, searching for him in the restaurant and flagging him down. The staff was nice- which is why they get two stars instead of one. The place was empty for a Friday night. The fish was dry, the orders were all wrong and the service left much to be desired.

It was a nice, welcomed and greatly appreciated offer that we of course took. When served, we were asked if we wanted fresh cracked pepper on it. Sometimes these little things just make me so happy.Jess got the Linguine Alla Vongole and I, the Spaghetti fruta de mari. Both were pretty good. Not mind blowing, but good enough. Since we had room for dessert we ordered the flourless chocolate cake. It was probably the best dish we had that night - but isn't dessert always? Especially if it's chocolate and you accompany it with a nice cup of illy cappuccino? The restaurant's interior is a bit weird in that it is faux fancy with a large TV. It's not too bad though.

5.0,4/30/2013,"This is by far my favorite spot in Astoria. From food, to the decor, the music and most importantly the service, Portalia is hard to beat! Now since it's NY, you can get somewhat decent Italian food almost anywhere depends on how much you want to spend and how far you want to travel. But one thing, you cannot find anywhere is the 5 stars, excellent service and the very welcoming cozy atmosphere! Well that's why we kept going to Portalia more than 5-6 times in past a couple of months! This chic friendly Italian restaurant is conveniently located on Broadway and 35th Street, Astoria. Which by the way is easily accessible from both train Stations (N/Q) lines and (R/M) also have plenty of street parking. Now, lets get to real business-Food! For dinner , appetizer, I'd recommend Calamari alla Griglia, and Torta Di Granchio. They have pretty amazing pasta selection, personally my favorite is  the 4 cheese Gnocchi-the BEST Gnocchi I've had outside of Italy ;) My other favorites are the Filet Mignon, the lamb chops and the pan roasted chicken breast! For Brunch, they have pretty decent unique selection-my favorite is the French Toast and Ouva Benedict. I don't what magic they put in their french toast recipe, I can never get enough of it! Now my favorite part-the EXCELLENT service! The owner, Antonio and the staff are fantastically beyond amazing! We've been going there since it started opened and never had a day that we left unhappy.

4.0,4/19/2013,"So last Saturday night my boyfriend and I wanted to go out for a nice dinner and try something new in the neighborhood. I wanted Italian as it had been awhile and when pasta cravings hit, they hit hard. We did a quickie Yelp search and Portalia popped up with pretty decent reviews so we shrugged our shoulders and decided to give them a go - especially convenient as they were a short walking distance from his apartment.Portalia is a pretty restaurant as far as ambiance goes that serves a diverse menu of Northern Italian favorites, suitable for vegetarians and carnivores alike. Dim lighting, candles on the tables, mod/art deco décor - nice place, but nothing insanely special. Good for dates though and I thought we had hit the jackpot when I saw the chalkboard sign out front proclaim ""Live Brazlian Music Tonight!"" - Portuguese is easily my favorite language when spoken by Brazlians (it's got a softer, more melodic sound than it does in Portugal...but aaaaanywhoo) and so I was excited.Turns out ""Live Brazilian Music"" is a man with a guitar, gelled up curly hair and a really sweet/pleasant voice who is seemingly Brazilian and pretty much singing romantic songs and performing some interesting covers. One of the said covers was Creed's ""With Arms Wide Open"" - I KID YOU NOT. THIS HAPPENED. But at the end of the day, it made me smile and laugh (at him...lol) and so he WINS. In his defense he also sang ""Besame Mucho"" and so I'm sure there was lots of *boom chicka wah wah* later as a result...Kay, so food. I was VERY, pleased by the dishes we ordered. I was seriously in between their RISOTTO DEL GIORNO  but unfortunately they were sold out of it, the GNOCCHI QUATTRO FOMAGGI (Four Cheese Gnocchi) and the PAPPARDELLE (ribbons of Fresh Pasta with Mozzarella, Tomato Sauce and a Touch of Cream) and my boy got the same thing and asked for no ""edits"" - I asked for them to be a little more generous with the cream. The  ribbon pasta came exactly as described and was presented as very long, thick and pretty wide (think 2-3 inches) width-wise. It was delicious, fresh and VERY obviously made in-house. This was NOT out of the box pasta and it was cooked perfectly. My sauce was creamy with tomato sauce mixed in and I accepted a generous portion of fresh parmesan cheese and a splash of grated black pepper. For dessert we decided to split one of their truffle offerings as we were both very full to begin with from the very dense pasta platter and the bottle of red wine we were sharing. We were in between their super chocolatey truffle with chocolate gelato a warm fudge center and covered in dark, semi-sweet chocolate flakes or the one we ended up getting - we had their Amaretto Chocolatey amazing thing. I can't find these on their website's menu so I'm describing it simply as I remember it...So make a snowvball of delicious Amaretto flavored gelato, put some warn fudge in the center and add fresh strawberries, rasberries and blueberries in tow and then roll it around in a sea of crunchy almond bits and decadent dark chocolate chips...yes, desert was delish.I do regret not trying their burrata or polenta as I am a fan of both items and they use truffle oil in their polenta so I figure it must be amazing. Portalia also has a pretty fantastic sounding weekend brunch special with ""all you can drink"" on I think mimosas and bloody mary libations.

It's weird.This place has a very 'Euro' feel to it, from the servers to the decor to the bizarre loud Eurodance music that was playing over the PA drowning out any attempt at quiet conversation, to the even more bizarre choice to have two Mexican guys play live music in the back of the dining room. It sounds cool, but trust me, it was just weird. I would not go here on date night.The food was very good, although that was kinda different too. I had the four-cheese gnocchi, which was good, although very filling. I don't recall for certain, but I don't believe the menu said anything about the fact that the gnocchi was in an alfredo-style cream sauce, rather than a tomato sauce. Again, made for a very hearty meal.But the weirdness of this place was off-putting to me. It did not feel to me at all like an Italian restaurant. Maybe I'm not the kind of guy they're targeting. Either way, my first trip there was also my last.",0,0,0,Mike C.,"Wyandanch, NY",48,136,2

5.0,4/14/2013,"Came for Sunday dinner after typing ""dinner"" on the search line and selecting Astoria as my neighborhood. Met there with my friend and sat in a cozy spot in front of the bar. Our server, Silvia quickly approached and introduced herself and took our drink orders. We started with the eggplant parmigiana appetizer. I love the fact that it was there because I'm usually always in the mood for eggplant but not necessarily always want it to be my entree. The eggplant was perfectly cooked and the tomato sauce that with it was perfect. I ordered the pappardelle, which happens to be my favorite kind of pasta, and they came out perfectly cooked with just the right amount of sauce. My friend ordered the rigatoni with ricotta and eggplant, again the eggplant was perfection, and the sauce was really good as well. To finish off I got the creme brulee which was custard-y goodness and didn't have that crazy thick crust that just gets in the way. It was light yet indulgent. The owner (I assume) came by to check on us when we got our entrees which I thought was very thoughtful. The service was great, Silvia always checked on us and made sure everything was perfect the whole evening.

For 18.00 you get coffee, an alcoholic beverage of your choice (I had the Bloody Mary which was REALLY delicious, and I'm very picky about my Bloody Mary's) not to mention it was a good sized drink (usually these places that include a drink give you a juice glass full of a droppers worth of liquor) and an entree.

5.0,2/22/2013,"Dining at Portalia is truly an impeccable experience. I believe that the owners have succeeded in their mission to bring a Manhattan experience and level of quality to Queens. And, of the many restaurants I've visited in the area, I believe Portalia to be the best of the bunch. In an area as heavily saturated with eateries as Astoria, that says a lot.The dining area and atmosphere at Portalia is refined, chic and intimate. Service was of the highest quality. We were greeted and treated as though we were long time regulars. And though the overall vibe could easily be misconstrued by outsiders as intimidating, we were met without an ounce of pretentiousness.The focaccia with goat cheese mixed with tomato sauce dipping accompaniment was a welcome change from the standard butter or EVOO, balsamic, salt and pepper combination that is usually presented at Italian restaurants. We ordered the crab cake appetizer, as well as the grilled octopus with fingerling potatoes and bitter greens to start. Both were perfect. My boyfriend proclaimed the crab cakes to be among the best rendition that he's ever had. And, the combination of contrasting textures and flavors regarding the octopus were unique and extremely well balanced.I ordered the grilled lamb chops, and would have licked my plate clean if it were socially acceptable. They were well seasoned and cooked exactly to my requests. The spinach provided a lean counterbalance to the fatty deliciousness of the lamb. While browsing other reviews, I noticed that the lamb largely goes unordered by many in favor of the maiale or steak offerings, but I believe it to be a hidden gem on their menu. My boyfriend's salmon was accompanied by a mustard cream sauce that he enjoyed thoroughly. He commented that he found it to be a bit overcooked, but to Portalia's defense, we did not specify any cooking preference at the time we ordered so it could be perceived by some as an oversight of our own part.We were too full to enjoy dessert, but if any of their offerings taste as good as they looked, I can safely say that you won't be disappointed. Their wine selection was well varied as deserves mention as well. The owner, who greeted and seated us, clearly takes pride in his restaurant, and his attention to detail shine through when dining here. There wasn't a single aspect of the entire experience that didn't meet or exceed my expectations.",10,6,10,Camille M.,"New York, NY",173,486,380

5.0,2/11/2013,"I have been to Portalia a few times with very good experiences, but it wasn't until my last visit that I was able truly understand what makes it so special.My girlfriend and I were there for brunch this past Sunday, I ordered the Pappardelle and she had the Tagillini, both amazingly fresh pasta dishes with bright, flavorful vegetables and some very impressive shrimp in her dish. We then followed that with a fluffy Ricotta Cheese Cake and a Gelati/Sorbet sampler, again both delicious. This was all topped off with unlimited mimosas for an additional $11/person.The food was great, but here's what really sold me. During the meal we happened to start a conversation with the owner Antonio (a few of his people couldn't make it that day due to snow so he was bartending and bussing tables.) Immediately, his passion for the business was obvious as he spoke of how the restaurant makes their pasta fresh in-house every three days and how he personally shops for the ingredients his chef's use versus going through a supplier. From produce to meat and fish, he said he shops locally for everything based on what looks best that week, helping dictate his specials menu that accompanies the many solid entrees. He told us his goal was to bring Manhattan quality cuisine to Astoria without the pretense or the price. Right away this won us over as we have a lot of pride in our Astoria food/drink community. He went on to explain how he was investing in many upgrades to the space to enhance his customers' experience. Most notably, installing  a retractable projection screen for big events as well as hosting live music/dancing nights, to appeal to all different tastes. Finally, he mentioned his plans to convert the front of the restaurant into a cafe style open-air space, providing a comfortable environment for everyone to ""have an appetizer and a drink, even if they can't afford to eat out much"". I thought that was incredibly classy and spoke volumes about his commitment to the neighborhood. I was to stress that I have no connection whatsoever to Antonio or his business, but was so impressed by the 5 minutes we spent talking that I wanted to share it with other Astorians.

5.0,2/6/2013,"Randomly stumbled upon this place on a Wednesday night and I'm incredibly glad I did. I've lived in the neighborhood for 3 years and this is by far one of my favorite places already. It started with a bottle of Sangiovese (they have a great wine list), a few slices of Italian bread and a delicious tomato sauce with goat cheese (which later on the owner, Antonio, told us he was inspired to make after a trip to Venice). This is the real deal sauce! It felt like someones ""nonna"" was making it in the back.I ordered the Arugula salad (disclaimer: I'm personally obsessed with arugula and if its on the menu, I have to have it!). It was arugula that was grown upstate and the owner personally picks it up every Friday. Delicious! Zesty and fresh!I then got the ravioli, which was stuffed with Ricotta, Mozarella di Buffala, and Spinach, and covered in the signature tomato sauce. It was so creamy and rich. My friend ordered the pan seared chicken breast and I only had a taste, but it was seasoned to perfection.Antonio, the owner, was incredible. We were lucky it was a slow night because we got him basically all to ourselves. He's really charismatic and cares about his customers and the quality of the food. He told us Wednesday is normally his slow night, so he hired a musician for those nights.

4.0,1/2/2013,"My friend told me about this place and ended her sentence with triple exclamation marks!  TRIPLE!  Portalia is a well kept secret of Astoria.  Literally.  Even with Google maps equipped on my phone, I must have passed by it 3 times before noticing it's presence.  The interior decor more than makes up for its reticent edifice.Price-wise, more than I would expect for Astoria, almost Manhattan prices, but did the food stack up to the competition?  We ordered 3 appetizers/antipasta/insalada to share (I could never tell the difference as to why they break down pre-meal, meal, and dessert so much).  The Carpaccio Di Manzo was good thinly sliced beef with a bed of arugula.  The Bresaola Della Valtellina Olio E Limone was good thinly sliced beef with a bed of arugula.  Basically the exact same dish, but re-arranged as one had the meat on top and the other had the meat on the bottom.  The meat was distinctively different, but let's face it, there wasn't much of a difference between the dishes, so get one or the other if you fancy that sort.  As a third app we had the Polenta, which had good flavor, but as most chefs warn, Truffle oil is good in small doses.  Polenta tasted a bit heavy on the Truffle.  The pre-meal was essentially experimenting with flavors we haven't really had before, but blew my socks off was the pasta dish I ordered.I had the Bucatini Alla Carbonara, a popular dish claimed the waiter.  (Of course I'm sure all the dishes are popular dishes according to him).  Some say a good Carbonara can identify you as a good italian chef, and Portalia amazed me.  The quail egg seemed to give it a different flavor along with the black pepper parmesan.  I'm not sure if it was a combination of everything, but I felt beyond full after the meal and well satisfied.  I really should have threw in the towel, but I gave in for some dessert, which I hardly ever do.  My friend ordered Affogato which is essentially ice cream with ""illy"" espresso, probably what I would order the next time IF I succumb to the temptations of dessert again.  I had the regular sampling of gelatos and sorbets...not their best foot forward as I thought it was way too sweet.The expansive menu doesn't overwhelm and the quality of the dishes we had on our visit makes me want to try other things.  Until next time.",0,0,0,Chester N.,"Astoria, NY",121,174,1

2.0,12/8/2012,"It was raining, and we had been trekking around Astoria for awhile, after finding out that the restaurant we originally chose was closed! So, as an improvise, we chose Portalia. It was nearby, and the reviews were quite stellar. However, when the food arrived, there was a disconnect between the food and the reviews. It is sad to say that Portalia was not good at all. For the night, we ordered the mussels as an appetizer, I ordered the veal scallopini, and my friends each ordered the pork chop, branzino, and the veal ragu pasta. The mussels were cooked with the red sauce. The sauce was ok, a little bland on the side, but some of the mussels were not fresh at all (it reminded me of a toilet that had not been cleaned for about half the year). As a note, never order any specials of the night. It is the restaurant's attempt to get rid of inventory that has been sitting around for too long.My veal scallopini was terrible. The meat had an old taste to it, similar to what you get when you eat leftover meat. I got a very strong meat flavor (not a pleasant one). It was very bland, and it seemed like they only used salt to season it. There was no use of herbs, butter, or anything else to enhance the flavor. Italian or not, it was just very bland and old tasting. The broccoli rabe was undercooked to the point that it tasted like chemicals (similar to what you get with undercooked bok choy). Again, it was flavorless-no hint of garlic or anything at all. Did they even cook it? The garlic was half raw. I tried my friends' pork chop and branzino. Again, bland as water, with the use of only salt to season. The pork chop was a bit sweet, but it just tasted like sweetened water. Sadly, the most likeable dish was the veal ragu, and that's because it had the best flavor. It wasn't the best pasta dish, but it was still better than all of our dishes combined.  For dessert, we ordered the creme brulee and the flourless chocolate cake. The creme brulee was standard as any. The cake was pretty good too, but the pistachio ice cream did not taste like pistachio at all. Also, it was icy and hard. For all of this, including a bottle of wine, the bill came out to be around $200. Not bad, but I expecting a far tastier meal. I can see why this restaurant was on the empty side for a Friday night-they need to revamp the flavors. The food definitely needs work. The service was pleasant though. However, towards the end of the meal, I can hear some brouhaha in the kitchen. There was some hooting going on back in there. It was quite unprofessional for a nice restaurant.

2.0,10/29/2012,"If you're an Italian food aficionado, Portalia is sadly not the restaurant for you. I wanted to like it so much, but the food is the main reason for hitting a restaurant, and it's just not up to par.My husband and I hit Portalia originally shortly after it opened. I remembered us having a good experience and loving the food, so I was excited to try it again recently. I don't know if they lost something between then and now, but it was not the delightful experience I remembered. When we came in, we were greeted and taken to a table of our choosing, which was nice. They have a booth near the bar that's perfect for a couple and is super cozy and romantic. We were pretty excited. But here's where it started to go downhill. We watched our server walk by our table a few times before he stopped by to greet us, and considering they have specials, we would have appreciated a quicker greeting time. It took such a long time for him to come to our table, which was also unpleasant since we were both thirsty and wanted to order something besides water. When we finally were able to put our drink orders in, they took forever to get the drinks to us. The one good thing: a glass of wine here is huge. You certainly get your money's worth.We decided to forego an appetizer since we knew they'd bring out bread and a tomato sauce with goat cheese. We put in our pasta orders and settled in. We assumed the bread and sauce would be brought out shortly after our order. Not so. As we sat there, I kept wondering if we were ever going to get bread. Finally it came. Note that they don't provide you with a bread basket; they serve individual pieces of bread, which wouldn't be a problem except for the fact that there's way more dip than can be used for two pieces of bread. The sauce wasn't even good this time. Even with the goat cheese mixed in, it tasted like a sauce I've gotten in a jar from the store. Our entrees came out within two to three minutes after receiving the bread and sauce. There wasn't much space on the table, and eating bread with dip became awkward because of the large dishes in front of us. My husband had a dish with eggplant, and he noted that the eggplant was mostly burnt, so it didn't taste very good. I had pasta with some kind of veal ragu. The pasta was undercooked, but the meat was overcooked. The dish had no flavor and bad texture. I made myself eat it because I was so hungry, but it was bad. I love Italian food and usually find even fast food Italian to be good, so the fact that I didn't like this is pretty significant. The dessert was the only good part of the meal, but it was an ice cream dish--you can't really mess that up.Someone who seemed like a manager did come by later in our meal to check on us, which was nice, but being so close to other people, we didn't feel comfortable voicing our true opinions. Perhaps we should have anyway. Our server didn't come by the table very much; we ended up spending most of the night asking anyone who happened by our table if they could get us something. It wasn't the worst service we've ever had, but considering the type of vibe this restaurant presents, we expected better. The final verdict: Portalia is more ambiance than good food. It's a shame but true. It's not a bad place to grab a drink, but if you want an Italian meal that will blow you away, I'd suggest you go elsewhere.",2,1,0,Jaime B.,"ASTORIA, NY",74,72,3

3.0,9/19/2012,"Went here for brunch with a few peeps on Sunday, Sept 9th.  The restaurant is small, but I liked the intimate feel of the place.  The skylight made the place bright and airy.  We were surprised to find out the bottomless drinks (e.g., mimosas and bellinis) were now $13, not $10 as advertised on their menu and website.  Still, it's a decent price to pay for bottomless drinks - I could only manage 1.5 of their mango bellinis.  Others in my party managed to chug down a few bloody Marys and belinis; they definitely got their money's worth.I ordered the UOVA Benedict, which came with two poached eggs with hollandaise sauce on top of two slices of an English muffin, two crab cakes and dressed greens.  I'm usually not a fan of eggs Benedict as some hollandaise sauces can be too heavy, but Portalia's tasted lighter than most.  The crab cakes were the star though - chunks of real crab meat with just the right amount of seasoning.  Other items ordered by our group were the pollo panini (chicken sandwich), linguine alle vongole (clams sauteed in a white wine sauce and tossed with fresh linguine), bistecca panini (steak sandwich), and the pancake (not pancakes, folks).  For dessert I ordered the white chocolate creme brulee.  It's more dense and rich than what I'm used to but it was so delicious!With the exception of the pancake, everyone enjoyed their respective meal.  The pancake was one thick cake...see the pic to understand what I'm having a hard time describing.  The staff were friendly, professional and kept our drinks filled.  It was a different experience, hearing house and dance music blasting away (before noon) as we ate.  However, I guess after a few drinks people will be in a partying mood.  I surely felt like dancing after a bit, haha.",1,0,1,Jade M.,"Tempe, AZ",51,130,726
2.0,9/15/2012,"I'd give 2.5 stars if possible- saw it had a great rating based on 70-some odd reviews here we decided to check it out for ourselves.  It's a nice looking place on Broadway- decent beers on tap (I always notice this) as we walked past the bar to our table.  I found it strange we were there at like 7:30pm on a Wednesday night and there was no one else in the place. The staff is really friendly and attentive I'll give them good marks for that.  Unfortunately, the Prosecco was the best part of the meal.  I had the Veal Scallopini- wasn't anything like I expected- It was really salty and mustardy-tasting with huge caper-berries.  The meat was rather chewy and not tender at all like you'd expect from a good veal.  We had some sauteed brussell sprouts they were good (bacon was a good touch).  My girlfriend had the rosotto primavera- it was a ""special"" but nothing too special kind of boring in fact.  The vegetables didn't seem that fresh but all in all it was ok.   I'll def. give this place another chance but really wasn't all that impressed this time around.",1,1,1,Jason L.,"Union City, NJ",45,19,0

The omelet was fluffy and had great smoky meat flavor from all the pork in there. It also came with mixed field greens and fries.We sat pretty much outside which was nice to get  tan and eat.

4.0,9/11/2012,"I still consider Portalia the new kid on the block. I have visited twice and the food was good, ambiance lovely, service prompt, and experience great. The food: The brunch menu is fairly standard for the neighborhood. My table had a  bistec panini and uvo benedict with canadian bacon. Both were tasty, came with a side salad and/or fries. I also had a cappucino, which I don't remember much about. The food is good, but not stellar. I came for dinner recently and ordered the linguine al vongole (with the clams) which was prepared well, flavored just right, and the pasta was firm. The sauce was a bit saltier than I like, but that is typical for this dish, so I'll let it go. Food overall is 3.5 stars if you consider the higher than average Astoria price point. The ambiance is what makes Portalia probably one of the better restaurants in the neighborhood. With a Tuscan feel, sky light, some greenery, and mood lighting, the restaurant feels intimate, romantic, and yet a bit familial. Its not uber fancy, but going through the door does make you feel a little special. Tables are not too loud here and conversation is polite. The service here is also quite good, with friendly service, a family business like pride in quality, and plenty of hello's and goodbyes as you come and go. They don't rush you or pressure you, they just are happy you came to visit and hope you really enjoy things. The waiter did have to confirm one of orders to make sure it went through right, but I rather he confirm than he make a mistake too late. The owner or manager keeps a good look out over the place as you dine, and is genuinely interested in how things are going. I'll probably be back and am happy to see Portalia in the neighborhood!",3,0,1,Suanne L.,"Brooklyn, NY",198,982,843

5.0,8/13/2012,"I was on my way to another bar in Astoria on a Friday night in early August and something told me to walk into Portalia -- best decision I made all week. The food spoke for itself: the ravioli were fresh, the sauce was light and flavorful, the wine was yummy. The service was really good: everyone was very sweet and attentive; the owner chatted with me for a while; seems like a great guy that opened the restaurant because of his pure love of food and nothing else.Before I left I knew I would come back (and I did, for brunch, a few days later -- their uova benedict were delicious and unique in that the English muffins were ever so slightly grill-charred and the resulting aroma and flavorful was so unexpectedly good). Pretty decor without being over-the-top. The menus were faux ostrich leather, so they looked great without sacrificing the birds! Although ostrich meat ain't so bad ;) I highly recommend that you try this place. It's unlikely that you will walk out disappointed. Lastly, the name is pretty awesome (Portalia = Portugal + Italia, the dual heritage of the owner), and I'll have to see next time if they have any Portuguese-inspired items on their menu. By the way, this is first Yelp restaurant review ever (first review was of a limo company). That doesn't mean I'm not opinionated or objective -- it just means I'm usually too lazy to craft reviews (too full in the belly and too drunk ;) In this case, I had a really good time and figured I would support a local business.I've written too much already.

2.0,8/11/2012,"Portalia is nestled along a busy avenue in Astoria.  The decor is nice and the seating was satisfactory.  The manager was super nice as was our server.  To start they bring over marinara sauce with goat cheese and one piece of bread per person.  However the bread was really small.....I suppose you could ask for another piece to lap up the rest of the saucy concoction but the small pieces we received looked like a slice from a cucumber sandwich? Anyway, the appetizer salad we had was good.  I had the tagliatelle.....it was really good. I liked the sauce and there was a little meat in it. It  was everything that I expected.  My husband's meal seemed a little on the small side.  He had another pasta dish with clams.  We had gelato.  That was really good.  All in all there was good service and our dinner tasted OK not sure if it stacks up as much as everyone else raves about it but whatever.  I would go again but there are other places in the area that are a small cut above.",1,1,1,Christine C.,"Bronx, NY",19,17,0

2.0,7/29/2012,"I came here with high hopes after reading the amazing Yelp reviews, but sadly, we had a less than optimal experience. Maybe they were just having an off night.We were greeted by the host who was also our waiter. He was pleasant, but he didn't even read specials until we asked about them and he was very busy taking care of what seemed like every table in the place (which was only about 6 tables, very slow for a busy Saturday). We got a bottle of wine and ordered. To our surprise, no bread was offered or brought to the table.Maybe we ordered the wrong things, but we found our apps (fresh mozz with tomato and beet salad) to be pretty average, and the branzino we got was cooked nicely but the sauce and vegetables that came with it were unbelievably bland. Maybe we should have gotten pasta, but we didn't want anything that heavy. Nothing stood out and my husband actually actively disliked the fish dish. The service was spotty throughout. No one asked us how it was. We ordered the flourless chocolate cake for dessert. Surely that would redeem the night? Alas, it was overcooked and almost rock hard. Fortunately the pistachio gelato (the best thing we ate) moistened it some.The bill was about $100 w tip, which is pricey for the area. I was not at all impressed.

4.0,7/20/2012,"After spending some time going through countless of reviews on Yelp, I booked a table for 9 on a Saturday night to celebrate my birthday with my family at Portalia. We started off with a bottle of wine(forgot the name) and a few appetizers:Grilled Calamari - A bit overcooked and the grill marks made it bitterFried Calamari - Cooked perfectly. Yum!Polenta with mushroom - My fave out of all the appetizers. I've never had polenta like this.Crab cakes - Very tasty Entrees: (Tip: They make their own pasta)Goat cheese with truffle oil ravioli in mushroom sauce (Special) - Wow! The star of the night. I love truffle oil and this hit the spot for me.Pork chop with apple sauce - Apple and pork are a classic combination. Pork was nice and juicy.Carbonara - My 2nd fave. Well seasoned and not at all heavy. Fettuccine with salmon and asparagus in pink sauce -  A little less sauce would've made this dish perfectBranzino - Best one I've had so far. Cooked perfectly! Crisp skin but the meat is moist and tender. If you're looking for a light meal, this is a good choice.Bisteca - I think it's flank or maybe skirt. Meat was cooked to medium rare served with greens. Of course we had to get dessert. We were full so we decided to share.Flourless choc cake with pistachio gelato - Sooo good! If I wasn't so full, I'd order one for myself.Tiramisu - I thought it was a bit too soggy but the strawberry compote on the side was delish! Apple tart with vanilla bean gelato - It was a bit too tart and the crust was too hard. It didn't taste fresh.Overall, we had a very enjoyable night. They didn't rush us and the servers were very attentive and friendly especially Julia. The reason that I only gave it 4 stars is that they must've turned off the a/c.

5.0,7/13/2012,"This has to be my new favorite place in Astoria. I randomly picked Portalia after deciding that I wanted to go out for dinner last night, and I was impressed-- so was my boyfriend, who usually doesn't have anything good to say about most restaurants. He doesn't really have anything bad to say either, just for the record.Looking in from the outside, it looks tiny, but the restaurant is a lot deeper than we expected, and when we arrived we were allowed to pick our own seats. In this case, it was right by the open window, to feel the cool summer breeze (which is an anomaly for a summer night in NYC, so enjoy it we did.)We decided to order tuna tar tare, polenta, and risotto of the day (turned out to be filet mignon). Everything was so delicious-- the polenta made me do a ratatouille moment-- it tasted like the mushroom cream soup my mom made for me as a kid, and it stirred up some warm feelings inside. It could also have been the wine. The tuna tar tare was the biggest tar tare I've ever experienced in my NYC dining, and it was delicious!

4.0,7/4/2012,"In my never ending quest to find the best Italian food in Astoria, I ended up at Portalia for a Tuesday night dinner with the wife.  The food was great, but ambiance could have been a little better.  All in all, it was a very enjoyable evening.Summer in NYC means you're gonna be real hot walking in, and the host (who I believe may have also been the owner) sat us directly under the A/C vent.  We got a nice cold bottle of Prosecco, and ordered very quickly.We were first given some toasted Italian Bread with our wine,  while olive oil and balsamic were available, they also served it with a tomato purée served hot topped with melting goat cheese.  A very unique and not the cheapest way to serve the bread, and I instantly knew I was in for a good evening of dining!For an app we shared Crab Cakes - the portions were somewhat small, but they were absolutely delicious.  Seared to perfection, a perfect seasoning, and full of lump crab  meat instead of filler and bread crumbs.  Served over a small arugula and cherry tomato salad, and with some sort of apple puree, the dish was exceptional.For my entree, I ordered the Pork chop.  It was a decent sized serving, probably up near the 10oz range, served with shredded cabbage and perfectly seasoned fingerling potatoes.  The only downfall was that the pork chop was slightly dry, it probably was cooked a minute too long.My wife went with the Pasta Carbonara, and it was the star of the night, absolutely deeeeelicious!!  The pasta was obviously homemade and cooked al dente, served with a Carbonara sauce and thick pieces of Guanciale (a thick, fatty Italian bacon).  The sauce was heavy on butter and cream, so not a good choice if dieting, it's probably a good 1,000 calories... A very, very delicious 1,000 calories!Portalia had a very friendly staff and the restaurant has a very nice atmosphere.  But the loud trendy music was a turnoff.  It would have been nicer with jazz or easy listening, the food and decor were just crying for some Sinatra.  The music kept changing up too... all trendy, from pop, to mariachi, to house.  But nothing that said Italy or even New York!There is a full bar with two large HDTV's - we were treated to the Mets and some poker on ESPN when we first arrived.  There were more people at the bar than in the dining room,Overall I left full and very satisfied, in a meal that was delicious and worth the $100 bill, which included a bottle of prosecco.  Give it a go, you should enjoy yourself.",0,1,0,Mike F.,"Bridgeport, CT",371,189,14
2.0,7/3/2012,"Lately, I often ponder: when is the right time to pass the baton?""What have you heard of the restaurant?""""Not much. Frankly, I'm surprised by the 4.5 star rating after 50+ reviews""""Who all have reviewed it on yelp?""""I'm scrolling through the reviews. None of my yelp friends have - but the restaurant has glowing reviews from the new class of yelpers. Hey! someone even has won RoTD for it!""Trust. It takes a lot to gain it, but only a moment to lose it. It's not to be taken lightly, and certainly never for granted. Now it's possible that our extremely poor experience was an outlier, and the restaurant is normally on top of its game to merit the high rating - but, I have to debate amongst the alternative explanations for the yelp reviews: 1) Did alcohol impair judgment? 2) Was it the company that transformed merely passable food to be ""as good as it gets""? 3) Was the whole experience more feel-good on account of complimentary apps/entrees?Seriously...  This was pretty absurd in my books. I've never sent a plate of pasta (Fazzoletti allo Zafferano: rough cut pasta with saffron and veal ragu) back to the kitchen for being undercooked. I don't understand what's so orgasmic about their tomato sauce with cheese? Is it because it's free? What about the quality of the bread that accompanies the sauce? Or, that of the Polenta? Is it the use of ""White truffle oil"" that is supposed to compensate for the hash of a corn meal the dish turned out to be? We didn't even eat half of it!I like the owner. He kept an eye on our experience (especially once the pasta had been sent back), and nodded affirmatively when the server showed him our dessert, allowing it to proceed to our table. He got that right. The Torte al Cioccolato was the one saving grace of our meal, even if the dessert promised pistachio gelato and we were instead given Stracciatella. This was the best version of molten chocolate cake my jaded taste buds have had lately. I wish he'd be more hands-on, though - as his staff isn't up to snuff. Compared to the servers at nearby Trattoria L'incontro that can remember 50 specials from memory, the servers here couldn't even read from the notes in front of them!!The clear lesson is that there are some things in life one can't delegate blindly.

4.0,5/24/2012,"I have only had the pleasure of dining at Portalia once so far, for dinner with my boyfriend. We are almost always in Astoria, so we were a bit surprised that this place was under our radar for so long. Additionally, when we walked up to the restaurant, we almost missed it. It has a tiny glass and stone front, which is really chic. Once we approached the door, a European-looking man swung it open for us and greeted us warmly. He introduced himself (can't remember his name, I'm bad with names) and seated us within seconds. When you first walk in, there are tables to your right and a long bar that stretches through most of the restaurant. The walls are a sort of dark brown/maroon color and there are mirrors from the floor up to about waist-height, creating a sort of chair rail. I was in aesthetic bliss when we were seated. From the mirrored walls to the glittery sconces, the chic chairs and table settings, etc. I would have given the place 5 stars if this were only based on decor. But, I digress.So we were seated, and I took the booth side, because I always do. It was super comfy. It also wasn't crowded, so I didn't feel like I had to keep my bag and jacket practically in my lap. One of the waiters brought us menus. A few minutes later, a young boy, he couldn't have been older than 17, brought us some bread (they had whole wheat, walnut, and white bread; heaven) and a tomato dip with a little circle of goat cheese in the middle. It was fabulous. I much preferred it to the warmed-over-frozen-then-warmed-over-again with enough-salt-to-cause-coronary-problems butter that is typically served in high-end restaurants. Furthermore, though I am not Italian, I consider myself a sort of snob when it comes to red sauces, because my aunt makes a mean Sunday sauce and nothing I sample really comes close to hers, but this was out of this world. Again, digressing. So the complimentary sauce with goat cheese was great and the bread options were great.Now, onto the food. The boyfriend had salmon, I believe, and I had the roasted chicken. My chicken looked like it may have been a cornish hen, though I am not entirely certain. We went on a Friday night, after a long day of work, and I could have been semi-inebriated off of my one glass of red wine, but, again, I cannot recall. Anyhow, the roasted chicken was delicious. It came on a bed of lightly sautéed vegetables. I rarely finish my meals, but this dish was good. I didn't have to bring any home in a doggy bag. We chose to order dessert and asked our friendly and attentive server for a recommendation. We decided on the Apple tart and the chocolate cake with pistachio ice cream (yes, 2 desserts; we were being fat asses that night, don't judge). The apple tart was divine and the pistachio ice cream that came with the chocolate cake was to die for. I wanted to ask the server if it was homemade because it tasted so authentic, not like the soft serve pistachio you can get at any commercialized, generic ice cream place. This was the real deal.I can't wait to come back! This is a great date-night spot or even a place to bring your family. I was thoroughly pleased.",0,0,0,Stefanie D.,"Beechurst, Queens, NY",5,47,5

I live in Astoria and generally head to the usual spots for brunch--Sanfords, Ovelia, Brick, etc. One day, I was driving down Broadway and noticed a sign for unlimited mimosas with brunch for only $10. Love at first site! I came with a friend for a catch-up brunch. From the first moment I walked in, I loved the decor and energy of the place. It feels like you've been transported to a trendy spot in the city. Within a few minutes, we had our first mimosas and our glasses were never empty. The french toast was amazing and the fruit was fresh and a perfect compliment to the dish. We spent three hours there just chatting and sipping on our champagne. We were never rushed and never ignored.Since my first visit, I've been back about 6 times and have told all of my friends about this place (they've all loved it too)! Each time I return, the owner, Antonio recognizes me and personally welcomes me. That is the type of service that makes a good restaurant great. The staff is friendly and always goes the extra step to make you feel at home and show how appreciative they are of your business. A lot of these reviews complain that the place is empty. I've never had that experience but in all fairness, it has only been open about 5 months and it takes time to build a loyal following and reputation. I know that soon it will be packed for every meal (I was reluctant to even write because I am so worried I won't be able to get a table soon). Portalia is truly a gem!",0,0,0,Victoria S.,"East Northport, NY",13,4,0
5.0,5/3/2012,"First of all. I rarely rarely give 5 stars. Really. Look at my reviews. 5 stars for me basically means if this restaurant is a person I'd want to have babies with it. Many of them. Um.. anyways. I was going to book 8 for the nearby Vesta but they were filled up. I frantically searched for an alternative and came across Portalia. The correct choice. I got there with another friend and was welcomed by very friendly staff and very very clean environment. I mean... I don't have enough vocabs. But the place is so clean and high class looking you have to go to Yelp to double confirm its only 2 dollar signs. If you're dirt poor you can consider proposing here. You get the point. We went in and they even placed a ""reserved"" sign on a very cozy area with corner couches. So classy. And because I invited girls, it took one hour for everyone to arrive. During this time they were very attentive and kept refilling my glass of water. I loved this place and the food wasn't even up.Okay food round. Bread basket. It came with this tomato-like sauce with a slice of goat cheese on top. Definitely more delicious than your average fatty butter. You pig you.I got steak. Forgot what cut. I ordered medium rare and it came medium rare. What can I say? It was good. It looked good and it tasted even better. My friends got some pasta, made with the catch of the day. Amazing. It came with pretty generous servings and waiter will come around offering pepper and parmesan. Take both. I won't say I'm a great food critique. But I do have pretty picky taste buds so I know what is good food. This is good food. You're just going to have to take my word for it. The service was of course excellent. Something about their smile that makes you feel very at home, even for an Asian guy. Very inviting and un-intimidating staff. Weird selection of adjectives I know. Well... seeing how much I am willing to embarrass my writing just to write this review - you should go!",3,5,5,Qian W.,"Queens, NY",327,349,61
5.0,4/23/2012,"As stated by most of my fellow Yelpers, this place is amazing!  I first heard of Portalia thanks to ""Why Leave Astoria?"" and decided to try it out.  The decor is elegant but not pretentious.  Antonio, the owner and host, was extremely friendly and down to earth.  The business also seems to be ""all in the family"", which I like.  His son is a bus boy and I believe he said his brother worked there too.  On to the food! We had a cold antipasti appetizer with buratta cheese.  You break it in the middle and then spread the smooth cheese on crostini.  Delicious!  We also ordered the beef carpaccio (thinly sliced and fresh) as well as the fried calamari.  The fried calamari is mixed in with some fried zucchini and squash, which complemented the dish perfectly.We all shared a pasta, linguini alle vongole.  This is one of my favorite dishes and it was prepared with just enough garlic and oil.  For dinner we split the branzino and salmon, both fishes were delicious.  Their creme brulee was also divine and I know my mom enjoyed their stracciatella gelato, which reminded her of Italy.  Overall, this is certainly a neighborhood gem.  I also hear they do a great brunch, which I of course plan on trying sometime soon!",2,0,1,Christina F.,"Astoria, NY",18,4,0

5.0,3/22/2012,"Faced with the inevitability of eating Mexican food for dinner yet again, I turned to good old Yelp to find some nom nom noms. Lo and behold... Portalia. Having seen amazing reviews, we decided to give it a try. OH MY GOD.IT IS SO GOOD.From the moment we set foot in the restaurant, we were transported to a glamorous restaurant that would be at home somewhere near the Mediterranean. We were given choice of where we wanted to sit; we chose the back. Tablecloths!! Then came... manna from heaven. Or, rather, came some yummy marinara sauce/goat cheese stuff with fresh bread. OH MY GOD. SO GOOD. WANT MORE.And then, the food. I had the salmon risotto, the fiance had some kind of cheesy pasta that I don't remember how to spell. Decent size portions, peppered and cheese-d to your taste. (Is cheese-d even a word? It is now.) The balance of the flavors is perfect. It's quite clear that the chef isn't a typical American with no sense (don't mind my prejudice, I'm from a country that knows how to cook without HFCS and MSG in everything). When time for dessert came, we picked tiramisu. I almost wanted to cry... it was amazing. Most place have no clue how to make tiramisu. More often than not you get a thick chocolate-espresso cake. Not here. Oh, god, it's so good. More people need to go here. Better than Samford, Michael's, or any other place in the area.Our waiter was very attentive, and polite.

4.0,3/15/2012,"Really tasty food. On par service. My boyfriend and I went here on a Sunday night. A girlfriend of mine had told me about their brunch but I was Jonesing to try them for dinner. We passed on appetizers bc we were just medium hungry but share the ricotta gnocchi and the pork chop. Both were delicious. I should also mention the tomato sauce with goat cheese that was served to us with the bread.  It was really flavorful. Y boyfriend didn't want them to clear it from the table when our food came!The gnocchi was very light and fluffy and came dressed in a chunkier sauce than came with the bread but had very similar flavor profiles. We made sure to sop up the remaining sauce with leftover bread when it was done. The pork chop (single cut) was cooked perfectly. It was seasoned so well and came with black cabbage and roasted fingerling potatoes. It was also topped with apples and a honey Dijon type of sauce. We also asked for a wine recommendation  and were steered towards the Montepulciano, which I love. They said that they sell a lot of it and if we didn't like it, we could pick something else since they sell it by the glass and it wouldn't go to waste. It was great so we kept it but it was nice to know that we had the option. We shared the tiramisu for dessert which was also lovely. I'll definitely be back for another great meal.

The inside of the restaurant is cozy and dim. It's a romantic place to eat on a date. The service was excellent, but it could be because the restaurant was quite empty when we arrived.

The entire staff was incredibly friendly, patient, helpful, and hospitable- probably some of the best service I've had in Astoria. The ambience of the place is beautiful. Since it was brunch, we sat up front close to the windows and got some sun there. The rest of the restaurant is just as nice- warm, relaxing, and inviting. We both ate a delicious clam soup- hers was a white brother, mine was red, both we great- and then we split a sandwich.

The service was impeccable.  The owner and our waiter/the bartender were extremely attentive (and from reading the other reviews, it doesn't sound like this is just because it was a slow night).  Our waiter Daniel had some great recommendations and he was very honest with his opinions, which was appreciated.The complimentary bread and marinara/goatcheese dipping sauce is out of this world.  We had the crab cakes, which were very light and tasty.  I had the Branzino with roasted brussel sprouts and cauliflower - which I recommend.  Great piece of fish and the veggies basically made the dish for me. My girlfriend had the skirt steak with fingerling potatoes.  I tried it - and it was really great.  I think next time we'll move on to some pasta dishes because they make all their pasta in house.  For dessert, we got the chocolate cake and the apple tart because we're fatties and it was really delicious.Safe to say that we'll be back often (happy hour = half priced wine and appetizers).  I've been looking for this kind of restaurant for a while in Astoria.  I hope this one sticks.",2,0,1,Steve K.,"Astoria, NY",7,14,0
2.0,2/29/2012,"My boyfriend and I went here last Sunday for brunch. We weren't sure what we were in the mood for and remembered that we had seen great reviews for this new spot on Broadway. We arrived around noon and were seated right away at a sunny table up front. Our waiter brought us water and asked if we would like anything else to drink, followed up with ""we have unlimited mimosas."" So of course my male counterpart jumps on that, only realizing after looking over the menu that it's an extra $10 for the unlimited drinks. Though it is not uncommon to offer unlimited drinks at a cost for brunch, the way it was presented was a bit misleading; if he had realized it would be an additional cost he wouldn't have ordered it. I however opted for orange juice... and when it arrived the entire rim of the glass was covered in dirt and dust. Very unappetizing. After finally flagging down a waiter, who whisked the glass away, another waiter came to apologize, but then I still waited almost 10 minutes for a new glass of orange juice... though at this point I was suspicious and didn't really want to drink it (Tropicana for $5, fyi). Our meals then arrive, the bf ordered the Challah French Toast with fruit, which I believe he enjoyed since it disappeared pretty quickly. And I had the Grilled Radicchio with Smoked Mozzarella. When my meal arrived it was very different from what I envisioned, it was actually sautéed radicchio (not grilled) with some sort of parma (I couldn't find an online menu so I'm not totally sure what kind of meat was included) completely covering it and smoked mozzarella over the top. The entire dish was assembled, and then placed in the oven to melt the cheese. The dish was interesting though the radicchio was overly bitter so half way through the dish I found myself only eating the ""parma"" and cheese. Overall, it was an ok meal. Will we return? Perhaps after Portalia is opened for a bit longer and they work out the kinks.",0,0,0,Tarah T.,"Columbia, MD",7,164,9

We sat at a table towards the back of the restaurant and it was set beautifully.  The whole room is decorated nicely actually. We had wonderful service from the hostess to the wait staff. All 5 of us ordered appetizers and entrees and we were all very happy. The food was fresh and delicious.  They brought out a dip for the bread which was a red tomato sauce with goat cheese. Outstanding. And my sister and I commented that it tasted just like our Italian grandmother's sauce (or as we call it... gravy). I am definitely going back to Portalia soon.

5.0,2/17/2012,"Amazing neighborhood find!! Portalia is the third restaurant that has occupied the space since my husband and I moved to Astoria, yet Portalia is the first restaurant into which we have ventured. The innovative classic Italian menu was intriguing, as many of the other ""Italian"" places in this area are really more ""Italian American.""The decor is warm and inviting and the music is not overbearing. The owner, Antonio, greeted us personally at the door and let us choose our own table. Our waiter was incredibly friendly and was there to help us with our drink order as soon as we sat down. He recommended a lovely red wine for me (did not push the most expensive, which I appreciated). You could tell he was more of an old-school waiter who really tried to make it more of an ""experience"" for us even if it was just a casual, late dinner out on a week night. Wine: I got the Montepulciano (not too sweet as some can be), my husband got a Palm beer (points for having a high quality Belgian beer on tap!)Primi: we shared the Pappardelle, which was perfectly al dente and the Buffalo Mozzarella was very fresh. Secondi: I chose the Pork Chop (!!!!)- OUTSTANDING. Perfectly cooked, and the apples in mustard glaze which topped the meat were pure goodness. The sides were just as tasty and I really don't think I have ever eaten broccoli rabe that I have been so enthusiastic about before! My husband had the Linguini Special which had some kind of smokey Duck Breast Ragu with spinach.....Whoa...I am not super fond of duck, but this dish came together very very well. The portions were very generous and the prices were perfectly appropriate. Antonio chatted with us for about 15 minutes on our way out and we found that he he buys from our favorite butcher, so we know he buys great meat products. All of the pastas are made in-house and he is very enthusiastic to talk about each kind he makes. He told us that he lives in the area and sees places come and go, and he believes that if he cares about his food and puts out a great tasting product and gives friendly consistent service, then the customers will come.....Well it worked for us and we plan to come again!!",6,0,1,J T.,"New York, NY",0,4,0
4.0,2/17/2012,"Went there recently for a birthday dinner and I have to say that everyone in our party was impressed. The modern decor and ambiance was terrific. The service was very good and extremely attentive - the owner was extremely nice and came over a number of times to personally look after us and to make sure that everything was perfect. The food was excellent; from the marinara with goat cheese they put out for you to dip your bread in while you look over the menu, to correctly preparing the various cuts of steak our party ordered, to the perfectly paired seafood dishes. I had the seared tuna over caponata, which exceeded my expectations and would highly recommend.  The menu, while not overly extensive like some places which hand you a book to browse through, provides just the right selection of dining options and all with a very nice modern mix of dishes - not your typical red-sauce Italian dishes. (If a place has too many items on its menu, you have to question just how fresh everything is...)  Actually, they give you at least two choices for every option you'd be interested in ordering: a choice of risotto dishes, a few atypical pasta-styles, like pappardelle and taglioni, and good selection of cuts and seafood. Plus, the owner indicated that they could even prepare something off-menu, if you asked. The prices were about average for a good Italian restaurant (~$25 for meat/seafood entree).My one personal disappointment was the gnocchi, which our table split a half-portion of. They were OK, but we felt they were a bit overwhelmed by the marinara sauce they came in. (Plus, I'm a bit spoiled after having the gnocchi at Tazzina (Glendale) - easily some of the best gnocchi in NYC!) The desserts we ordered were also outstanding and put a perfect finishing-touch to our dinner experience. All in all, everyone in our party felt that we'd definitely make another trip to Portalia in the near future. As the place is relatively new, the were still working out some minor kinks with the wait-staff's knowledge of the menu, how things are prepared, etc. But their eagerness to help was definitely a plus.",0,0,0,Marcel G.,"Glendale, Queens, NY",0,4,0

4.0,1/23/2012,"I joined an exodus to Portalia lead by Moses, I mean Evan.  Instead of manna from heaven, we dined on Northern Italian fare, admittedly heavenly:  ~~Seafood risotto - 5 stars - this was actually Amy S. entree and she offered a taste of it.  I think risotto brings out Portalia's A-game.  The consistency was impeccable, the chunks of seafood were firm and the taste was just delightful. I can just imagine whoever made it stirring it continuously on the stove.  It was the best dish of the night in my opinion. ~~Polenta - 4 stars - although I am not a big fan of polenta, this dish just made me a convert.  I loved the texture, the taste and how comforting it was on the tastebuds. I can feel the love in the preparation although they did use truffle oil and I'm still on the fence about its use. ~~Lamb -  4 stars -  it was perfectly cooked (I want it a bit pink), tender and perfectly seasoned.  It was Evan's entree and he was generous in giving everyone a taste of his meat. I would have given five (5) stars but it was a smallish portion. ~~Guanciale -  3 stars I had it as an entree and I wanted to see how it compares to one of my favorite chef's version.  However, as far as I can recall that version used guanciale in a pomodoro base so it would not be an apples to apples comparison.  It was creamy and a bit overpowering so t I think the seafood risotto was several notches better. ~~Torta di Granchio or crabcake - 3 stars - I wanted chunks of crabmeat which were absent and the serving was on the small side.   ~~Fazzoletti with Veal Ragu - 4 stars -  This was Megan's entree and since all of us were tasting each other's dish, I had a good taste of this.  It was rich, comforting and perfect.  ~~Calamari -  4 1/2 stars - Moses, I mean Evan, gave me a bite of the calamari. It could be the robes and the decalogue he was carrying but I thought the calamari was sensational.  It was crispy, served hot, not flour-y, I loved it!  I also give four (4) stars for the Cabernet Sauvignon they served at happy hour prices ($7 per glass until 7:30 p.m.)  After happy hour, Raphael, Amy and I got a bottle of wine for $30 to go with our meal.  Five (5) stars for the service as everyone from the staff to the manager and even the owner, I think, collected coats, poured water, checked in on us, etc.  After our meal, they gave us a taste of most of their desserts, compliments of the chef.  That was a nice gesture for our big group. :) And in Astoria, it is often done by most restaurants. like Taverna Kyclades but Portalia went a bit further by giving a taste of ALL of their available desserts:~~Tiramisu was heavenly, authentic and not too sweet.  ~~Chocolate creme brulee was a nice surprise but I prefer the traditional one.~~Flourless chocoloate cake with pistachio gelato was the most elegantly    presented of all the desserts.  ~~Apple tart was perfection, and the dried apple was beautiful and delicious.  I     think this is the perfect dessert for the pork chop which Mike B ordered but     I never got to taste of because he was at the other table.   ~~The raspberry sorbet resonated as the perfect ending for me because it was a    beautiful contrast to the richness of the food. Bravo, Portalia!  I see myself and my best friend strolling to and from our home, pretending that we are in Bergamo.  By the way, they do offer brunch and by adding $7 to your entree, you get unlimited mimosas.  Finally,  molto grazie to Evan, our resident Moses who can even top feeding manna from heaven by simply bringing us to Portalia.  :)",12,6,11,Lara G.,"Astoria, NY",308,424,252

Italian restaurants (this is also applicable to other European cuisine in general) with a million options clearly do not know what they are doing. there were a few daily specials, the usual meat/fish options (pork, chicken, beef, salmon, tuna), veggie plates, and pasta. the food was nothing short of spectacular. we got some marinara sauce with goat cheese to kick off - a great topping for the warm bread. then the bruschetta came out. simple and to the point - bruschetta need not and should not be complicated.we split some appetizers at our table. the fried calamari was perfect - not too chewy, but not overly fried. the polenta was great (sidenote, my late grandfather had a friend we called ""Signor Polenta"" because he loved the stuff) and topped with some mushrooms.for a main course, I had the maiale (pork chop) with an apple/mustard glaze, cabbage, tomato, and Tuscan potatoes. holy crap! a great portion, and the meat was so tender. the glaze really added a nice punch to the pork chop. good balance of veggies too. we were given a plate of fresh gnocchi to try out. delicious and perfect consistency.at the end, they assaulted us with what seemed to be every dessert on menu. strawberry gelato, apple tart, tiramisu, banana cake, pistachio ice cream, creme brulee, chocolate cake...the list went on. good thing Wilford Brimley was not there to declare his state of DIABEETUS and admonish us to check our blood sugar and check it often!I will note the disclaimer that some stuff was comped/discounted. still, the prices here are really good, entrees are in the $15-25 range and the price of drinks is great. we gave a good tip because of the outstanding service. Yelpers have no right to be cheap with tips as we eat and drink for free at all those Elite events! if you disagree with me, then it looks like we should settle this with a knife fight.atmosphere was great. not too casual but not stuffy either. a good balance. music was low but audible (heard a lot of Beatles - SWEEEEET), and there was a TV by the bar (playing sports at first - eh; playing Archer later - HELL YEAH).really, there were no faults with this place and I wish them the best of luck in this rough economy. I will definitely be coming back and bringing more people!",10,6,9,Mike B.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",187,1514,175
5.0,1/11/2012,"I just got home from Portalia. I am at least slightly tipsy (arguably more), and am about 15 reviews behind. But this restaurant demands attention. First we got a marinara and goat cheese topping on the house with some delicious bread. Great start. Then we shared crab cakes. Crab cakes are always mushy and similar-tasting. These crab cakes reaffirmed my belief in God.For dinner, I had far and away the best osso buco I've ever had, served on a bed of perfectly cooked risotto. We literally spent the entire meal saying wow, and cleaned the plate completely.Then the pastry chef came out and personally explained each dish. We went with the Torta di Mele (apple tart). Again, you expect an apple tart to taste like everywhere else - frozen crust, processed-tasting apples, etc. This was incredible. We washed it down with a complimentary glass of port.I've lived in Astoria for 7 years, and for whatever reason, this particular location has gone through 6 different restaurants. Portalia needs to last - the other reviews don't lie.Francisco's service was fantastic and I had the chance to meet the owners (George and Antonio) as well. I promised them I would tell you people to come eat here. So do it.",15,11,15,Evan R.,"Long Island City, Queens, NY",418,465,99
4.0,1/1/2012,"Went here tonight for the first time and really enjoyed it!The marinara and goat cheese dip was a nice treat when we sat down. Our appetizer, polenta with mushrooms and truffle oil, was spot on. I was a bit nervous since, believe it or not, a lot of places don't really know how to make polenta properly, but they nailed it.For a main, I had the pappardelle in a tomato cream sauce and my boyfriend had stracci di pasta in a veal ragu. My pasta was done perfectly and, according to the BF, his entree was really good, as well. We also shared a side of the melted leek and onion custard, which was quite tasty. (Don't let the description scare you!)The staff was attentive and the owner (I think?) kept checking on us to make sure everything was okay. (It was!)Finally, a good Italian place on Broadway. Huzzah! We will definitely be back.",0,0,1,Lori P.,"New York, NY",44,102,16
5.0,12/31/2011,"I've lived in Astoria and have been eating on the ""Broadway strip"" for over 12 years and the dinner I had at this restaurant ranks right up there with the best.  I thought I'd challenge them and order the pork chop because you never seem to get a good one anymore and they blew me away.  As a matter of fact everyone in my group was raving by the end of the meal. The waiter (Francisco?) was great and the place is pretty sharp by Astoria standards. The price was right given the quality.  I'll definitely be returning soon.",1,0,1,Sammy N.,"Astoria, NY",0,7,0
5.0,12/26/2011,"We came here after debating on which Astoria Italian restaurant to head to. Let's say it was so great back we came again the next night- after eating dinner at another restaurant! From the time we walked in the staff was honestly the nicest most helpful and attentive I have come across in a long time- especially for one at this pricepoint. The service was honestly impeccable.  Food: Over two nights we had the Crab Cakes, Polenta, Risotto, Salmon, Carbonara, Tiramisu and 2 apple tarts. The menu is straight forward and I rather enjoy that there isn't 6 pages of options. The menu may not be extensive- but it's authentic and is NOT your typical American Italian- you can tell everything is prepared fresh when you order- including the hand made pastas. Everything was cooked perfectly and tasted exceptional. It truly was a top meal in my lifetime. I highly recommend anything listed above, and can't wait to try other options. The apple Tart is possibly one of the best desserts I have ever had- thanks to an amazing pastry chef here- The crust was crunchy yet light- the apples cooked to a sweetness and topped with a delicious Vanilla Gelato. I've eaten in just about every major city- and I would hold this place against any meal I've had.Atmosphere/Ambiance:The place was quiet both nights as they have been open only a month now. It was nice to have a quiet dinner, un rushed by a waiting crowd in NYC. The decor fits perfectly and even the bathrooms- a test of a quality restaurant to me- was clean and taken care of. I feel there's a great ambiance here and coupled with the food and service creates a very welcoming atmosphere. Overall: I've eaten at many a NYC italian places and I will recommend anyone and everyone take the short worthwhile trip on the subway or cab to try Portalia out. Thank me later. Please tell your friends too- this place deserves a crowd and will become a standout in the area. The pricepoints are perfect as well- $10 apps, $17 entrees. Good luck finding this high of food in midtown for that!",0,0,0,Chris L.,"ASTORIA, NY",4,2,0
4.0,12/20/2011,"So after hitting up all three Brooklyn Bagels on a Sunday around 11:30, I somehow ended up stumbling across Portalia and their sign outside that said ""Brunch $10."" At this point I think all four of us were sold because we just needed to eat. Now I have walked Broadway time and time again, and couldn't decide if I just hadn't spotted this place or if it was new. As we strolled in I noticed only one other guest in the entire restaurant. The wait staff came running down to the greet us and bring us to a table. Once seated and menus were handed out, the waiter was kind enough to go around to everyone at the table and put our napkins on our laps. How fancy, and this is Astoria! After reviewing the brunch menu, which was slightly odd as it wasn't your typical brunch fare, we came to some decisions. While ordering, my friend and I who both live in the neighborhood had to ask the question that was really bothering us ... how long have you been open?! They had only been open at this point for 3 weeks and this was their first Sunday of running a brunch menu. Interesting! The menu had some breakfast food, along with some fish options as well as pasta. But three of us decided to have french toast and my mom had an egg white omelet with spinach and Canadian bacon. Now mind you, we had all gone out and boozed the night before so we were hungry and looking for something to soak up the left overs. The french toast was brought out on a square plate (I love square things!) with the most beautiful arrangement of fresh fruit. But since the plate was a little too big, it made the french toast look lost and if you didn't splurge and spent the $3 for fresh fruit, it would have been an eye sore! The french toast was absolutely delicious although I could have used a third piece. It was extremely sweet and with the maple syrup, the sweetness was a full force ... which I love! The fresh fruit was everything from bananas, strawberries, blueberries, blackberries. It really added to the dish. Ps if you're going to do brunch here and are hungry, I suggest ordering the french toast and a order of pancakes (comes with 4) and splitting. I mentioned this to my girlfriend after and well ... we were kicking ourselves that we didn't think of it sooner! My moms omelet was a nice size and they were more than accommodating to give her an egg white omelet. It was full of veggies and Canadian bacon. Now she made a very good point, it didn't come with toast nor was it offered on menu ... she didn't want toast but she thought and even told the waiter some people expect toast with an item like that. I agreed! The decor in here is outstanding. The bar area is absolutely beautiful with the dark wood work and on the other side the exposed brick gives this eatery a rustic feel. We did scope out the dinner menu which looked just as delicious and reasonably priced. You can tell their new as the waiter would have gotten down on the ground and done anything for us, which is amazing service!! I would like to go back here for dinner and see how the food is, I have a feeling its going to take a while to work out the kinks or understand the brunch scene a little better.",4,1,3,Lauren L.,"Astoria, NY",414,331,602
5.0,12/16/2011,Very good upscale Italian restaurant in Astoria.  The service was great and attentive. The food was awesome and the music and atmosphere were terrific. We'd definitely go back there soon.,0,0,0,beth f.,"ASTORIA, NY",0,3,0
5.0,12/16/2011,"I am always skeptical of new places with only a few reviews and all of them being very high, that being said I have to give this place 5 stars, it was that good.  This place is a classic Italian restaurant that leans towards more authentic versions of the dishes as opposed to Americanized versions.  Which is nice because there aren't too many similar options in Astoria that are this good besides L'incontro, Picolla Venezia and a scarce few others.  This one is also more modern than the others I mentioned.  I had the truffle polenta for a starter, it is a big portion, but it was so good I was almost licking the dish.  I had the sea bass for my main, it was cooked perfectly.  I had the chocolate tort for desert, and this is why I am fat, I couldn't stop eating it, haha.  I was with a big group and we shared some different pasta dishes which were cooked to a perfect al dente, I felt like I was in Italy.Check it out if you need a new place for a holiday dinner or a date, you wont be disappointed.",1,0,2,Ryan T.,"ASTORIA, NY",12,32,0
4.0,12/13/2011,"Portalia is the shiny new ristorante to take up residence on Broadway, right next to Brooklyn Bagel. I'm not sure exactly how long they've been open, but it seemed to appear overnight and its clean new signage and sparkling clean windows caught my eye. The menu looked tasty, so I suggested it to friends for our dinner date the next night.The space is lovely and open, clean lines and warm light. The staff has the excitable eagerness of those yet to become bitter and jaded and discontent. In fact, I don't believe our server had waited on a single table in his life. Bless his little heart, the poor guy was struggling, stumbling over specials and completely unfamiliar with the wine menu (which is actually fairly small). He seemed nervous and looked like I imagine I did the first week I had ever served. All that aside, though, he was a sweetie, so we looked past it. We were quickly brought a variety of fresh breads and a tasty tomato sauce with a chunk of goat cheese in the middle! The menu is pretty outstanding and we all had a hard time deciding what to get. The specials were extensive and had a few gems, too, and only added to the indecisiveness. I went with the tagliolini special, with alfredo sauce and shrimp and peas. The dish initially came from the kitchen sans shrimp, but they were all extremely apologetic, and I expect a few kinks from a new business. When I finally got to dig into it, I was rewarded with a deliciously creamy, cheesy alfredo. Everyone else was similarly satisfied with their meals, and I'm especially excited to try the pork chop my friend ordered. Overall, I'm glad we gave Portalia a chance and I suggest you do the same - I can only see it getting better!",1,0,1,Megan C.,"Astoria, NY",236,265,45
5.0,12/8/2011,"The inside is absolutely beautiful. Very nicely done. It feels clean and upscale. The bar is long and comfortable with lots of room. Very expansive selection of liquor, and pretty decent wine list with reasonable prices. An impressive menu with pastas, entrees and appetizers, all interestingly different and not the usually expected Italian foods. The dessert menu is creative. The espresso was perfectly done. Owner is a charming guy, he was sitting at the bar having a meal and was passionate when speaking about the restaurant. I was very impressed. Try the paper thin Manzo Carpaccio, comes with thinly shaved slices of aged parmigiano and a bed of fresh arugula tossed lightly with olive oil and seasonings. I like this pace.",0,0,0,Joe L.,"ASTORIA, NY",0,2,0
5.0,12/2/2011,"Just  the gem this neighborhood was looking for.I eat out a lot more than anyone really should, so I know a thing or two about a quality meal. The prices are amazing for the amount and quality of food you get here. The owners hands on approach to customer service is something to be commended.I'm not one for writing reviews or trying to sell people.

5.0,11/30/2011,"Cannot say enough good things about this place. I live right around the corner from Portalia and have watched as it prepared to open. Finally got a chance to try it and was not disappointed in the least bit. Fairly large wine selection , many of which were priced fairly. The menu itself had an impressive selection of food. We started with caprese salad, and then moved onto the risotto special and filet mignon. Capped it off with the best tiramusu I've ever had and I'd say you got yourself a contender for one of the best local restaurants in Astoria. Of course the complementary round of after dinner drinks didn't hurt at all.Service was exceptionally good. Their attention to detail was tremendous, along with a professional courtesy that rivals the finest restaurants in Manhattan. The owner was available to appear at each table and speak with he customers, something I appreciate, especially when trying out a new place. To put it blunt: TRY THIS PLACE. As far as what Astoria has to offer, I challenge you to find another place as good as this.",1,0,0,Michael T.,"New York, NY",2,6,0
