4.0,5/1/2019,"This is a great steakhouse. It is a very spacious area with lots of seating available. They have an appetizer Buffett station with a wide variety (salad, meat and cheese platters, pasta, etc). Then they have servers constantly coming around with a wide variety of meats to try. It was a great experience and very filling! Dessert was not included in the per person cost but I ordered the chocolate molten cake and it was amazing! My only compliant was the waiter did not come around too often and took too much time getting the check/paying.",0,0,0,Ashley A.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",147,36,0
1.0,4/29/2019,"I had a dinner date with my cousin last night at the uptown location, after visiting LA branch and visiting the dallas location, I can clearly say this location is a disgrace comparing to the other, very lazy Waiters, not enough personnel, it took them almost 20min to come back to our table with new meat to offer, I had to ask for the mashed potatoes twice, without even them offer that for the first time, the waiter spilt the coke on my cousin, I asked for a new plate no one had never came back with one, so I had to get up and look for a new one all by myself, that location doesn't do justice to the chain name, I paid almost $200 for a very little while it didn't worth it! Very disappointing.",0,0,0,Adi A.,"Dallas, TX",44,7,0

2.0,4/23/2019,"I am extremely disappointed with the service at Fogo de Chao. This review is NOT for the food. The food is absolutely delicious. We came here on a Tuesday evening, with a reservation from open table and I had stated that it was our anniversary.The service is SLOW. They did NOT explain the menu. We did NOT know who our waiter is. We had to flag down several different waiters so that we could obtain the sides that were already included with the all you can eat. The gentlemen that bring the different types of meats are very lovely and did their best to accommodate us. The waiters were MIA. It's pathetic that we order a bottle of wine and we have to pour the bottle ourselves. Unfortunately, I think this is the last time that we will be coming here. Our last two evenings here (Valentine's Day and this evening) were very disappointing in terms of quality of service. They waiters should be more attentive to the needs of their patrons. Again, I want to reiterate that the food is delicious and the gentlemen that bring the food around are also very nice. This was NOT busy evening. If it were, I'd excuse the poor service.",0,0,0,Hilda E.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,9,1

5.0,4/19/2019,"Came here during a weekday and made a reservation for 8:30PM online. They're quite busy, so make sure you reserve in advance so you're guaranteed a decent time.The place itself is big with two floors. They sat us at an excellent table and explained the menu. We did the $70 rodízio deal that came with a buffet of good appetizers and fresh fruit. The salad bar was a lot bigger than most of the rodízio spots I've visited prior and everything on there that we tried was delicious. The meats came back to back! They're a lot faster than anywhere else I've gone to. They were very generous with the portions and the meat was so well-seasoned and perfectly cooked. Unlike other reviews I've seen, the waiters with the better cuts were frequenting all the tables. I must have had filet mignon and the picanha at least 4 times. I didn't try one thing that was over cooked and they were very good about giving us meat that was cooked as requested. Highly recommended restaurant. Great for families, friends, or date night. Plus, a cool add-on was that I won a free dessert from their scratch-off promo. Didn't get to use it this time (we were stuffed) but would def use it again soon.",6,3,5,Michelle D.,"Montclair, NJ",152,286,537

4.0,3/31/2019,I came for my 1st time on a Friday after work. To start when I walked in I loved the decorum of this restaurant.  Very nice. I had a 615pm reservation but arrived at 545pm so I decided to get some happy hour drinks. The cucumber mint smash was amazing. A refreshing cool after work cocktail. The mango Habanero was also Very good.  The bartender was attentive and served me and my guest right away. At 610pm I checked in to get my table and was seated right away. The hostess was pleasant.We get to the table and our server came to us immediately.  I didn't even get a chance to sit down yet. Lol. But I thought that was great service.The salad bar was good. A nice variety of selections and tasty. Now for the meat selection. The bacon wrapped filet was oh so good. The picana was seasoned and tender. The garlic sirloin also very good. The lamb another amazing taste of meat. The pork rib lacked seasoning and flavor but was tender. Never got to try any beef ribs. Was very disappointed. It would have been 5 starts but there was one server who had the filet and picana but he kept passing us by although we had the green side up. We had to stop him every time. Felt intentional but again I did not let it ruin everything else that was good.I will definitely be back.,0,0,0,Kim W.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",153,58,60
1.0,3/28/2019,This was special.  We arrive at are told it'll be a few minutes after zero type of greeting.  We sit at the bar and check in after 15 minutes.  Again told it'll be a few minutes.  Other parties arrive ... and are promptly seated.  We check in one final time and are given the runaround.  So glad we went to Del Frisco's instead rather than continue to plead our case to be seated.,0,0,0,Josh F.,"Bronx, NY",125,173,2
1.0,3/26/2019,"This place is a s**t hole. I got scammed three times on the same trick, in Baltimore MD, Troy MI and last night here in Manhattan.Company runs scam scheme by selling gift cards with 25% rebate (get $ for every $100 gift card purchase). When you buy the card they don't tell you about any restrictions but when you come to use it you are out of luck.I went with some people from work to 53rd street location because we had four $25, last night (friday March 22nd) to enjoy happy hours. The bill was not too big but I wanted to use those four gift cards towards. Server took my payment and came back very rude and impolite telling us those cards can't be used for happy hour items and drinks. WTF ?I threw those BS cards on the floor and put everything on my credit card. I even left $50 tip to servers because isn't their fault they work for such a horses***t company.This morning I wrote email to Robert Agostinelli, the founder of Rhône Group, the owner of Fogo de Chao to tell him about the scam his company runs.It is not about $100, who cares about the money but is about the principles.

4.0,3/23/2019,"Came here with my girlfriend to have dinner for our last day while staying in south beach. Overall we had a very good experience here. The selection of meats for the rodizio was amazing. We started with the salad bar and then went on to flip the button over to the green side so we can begin to enjoy what we came here for. The first item we tried was the filet and it was one of the best cuts we've ever had. Then we tried lamb chops (sad to say we only got to try it one time, as it was delicious. Nobody ever came around with it more than that one time). Then we had top sirloin which was tasty. The bottom sirloin tasted better than the top sirloin, even though most times I'd say the opposite. The Parmesan-crusted pork was amazing and I wish I was able to eat pork more often than I do. The churrasco was too bloody so I gave it another try the next time around and that piece was a perfect medium. The pork rib seemed a bit dry and the bacon-wrapped chicken and beef were also a bit dry. The ribeye had lots of flavor and I enjoyed every bit of it. The staff were all great and I learned that the restaurant also has a NYC location and I plan on making a reservation to go there within the next few months. I definitely recommend this Brazilian steakhouse.

4.0,3/19/2019,"My review will be based from a vegetarian's prospective(at a steakhouse...I know). I visited here with my boyfriend and his family to celebrate his 25th birthday. I had booked the reservation 2 weeks in advance and called in to inquire on their outside cake policy and cutting fee to my surprise did not exist. A big plus in books! Upon arrival we were greeted immediately and waited 2 mins to be sat down. We were directed to go downstairs where we saw a clear top view of the dining room. Just as pictured and even better! It was my boyfriends first time experiencing a Brazilian steakhouse and he felt like a kid in heaven with endless meat options. Overall, our experience went well up until our waiter approached me stating they could not find the cake. In this moment, he ruined the susrpise.

5.0,3/18/2019,"Fogo the chao it is a restaurant that goes beyond the quality of a good steak . It made me felt in love with the food, the tradition of how the serve and the enviroment of a classic , fine dining and overall warming welcoming experience.I had to call twice to postpone my reservation and they kindly did it with happy aptitude. My friend and I experience the full buffet, and had an amazing meal. The meat , steaks, chicken was amazing. The best for me was the steak ribs. Tender, juicy and high quality meat. The sides are amazing( felt in love with the mushroom salad from the bar menu and the polenta).The wine selection is carefully selected, and a wonderful experience for the wine lovers, like me. I have to say that house by glass are reasonable pricy and the quality of those are notorious for  having a selection process. Try one of the malbec from Argentina recommended by the server who asked me about my taste , a full body house and gave me a nice one.I had been in places with a similar concept of Rodizio, and honestly it is a service experience, wine devoted flavours and amazing quality of meat plus the experience of a well modern, spacious luxury but warming restaurant.A restaurant for everybody and every ocasion",0,0,0,Carolina S.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,0

5.0,3/13/2019,"Fogo de Chao is my absolute FAVORITE restaurant. All-you-can-eat high quality meat already sounds amazing. I came here with my boyfriend during restaurant week for $30 per person. There was an unlimited salad bar along with fruits, cheeses, soup, and more. We also were given the most delicious starter bread I've ever had. The bread literally melted in my mouth as I ate it, as if it was filled with something. I always randomly crave that bread all the time and wish I knew what exactly it was. There were so many different meats, like beef, filet mignon, chorizo, lamb chops, and more. Be careful when you have your your card flipped to green because the servers come by and slice up a piece for you quickly.

My family and I made reservations and showed up 15 mins early. We were seated right away. Our waiter was extremely busy so our table was well taken care of by a manager. She did not let us go without. The timely manner is which they handled a request by anyone at our table was quick. From the salad bar to the plantains it was all very well done.

5.0,3/9/2019,"I'm in love with this place! All-you-can-eat steakhouse? Sign me up! Just thinking about the waiters slicing off tender, succulent pieces of beef onto the plate makes my mouth water. They have so many different cuts, from top sirloin to filet mignon to filet wrapped in bacon. There's also a couple types of lamb. Wouldn't recommend getting any of the chicken or pork (even if they are delicious), because you're there to eat beef!! You can ask for some accompanying sauce as well. Both the green (chimichurri) and red sauce are amazing. It's always a shame when you first sit down and they bring the warm, cheesy bread because it's so tempting but you don't want to eat too many pieces and get full on that. 1 or 2 at most. The garlic mashed potatoes side is also irresistible. Then head over to the market table, which has a nice diversity of items for accompaniment. Roasted vegetables, chickpeas, cheese, fruit to eat after the main course.Dinner price is $66.95 per person which is on the pricier side.

The waiters and waitresses were so amazing. Very helpful in explaining the dinning layout, as it's open buffet (unless you want to order something off the menu). The different cuts of meat were prepared perfectly and the best thing was that they asked you how you liked your meat cut.

3.0,3/3/2019,"I came here for their restaurant week dinner deal which is $42 (excluding tax and tips) for unlimited meats and salad bar. The difference between this deal and the regular full churrasco experience is that for the restaurant week deal, you can't get the beef ribs, ribeye, filet mignon and lamb chops. For this deal, you also get some sides (cheese bread, crispy polenta, mashed potatoes and caramelized bananas) throughout the meal. At the end, you get to choose a dessert, either cheesecake, chocolate mousse cake or key lime pie. The lamb and top sirloins were my favorites because they were so tender. The other options tasted average to me. All the side dishes were delicious, especially that cheese bread (looks like a cream puff)! With unlimited side dishes, soups, and meats, you'll get full pretty fast. It was a bit overwhelming for me. I would recommend that you come try this place for restaurant week first  because the price is so much cheaper compare to the regular price of $67.

3.0,2/28/2019,"Just to start things off - I tried to apply for a job here once, and no, I didn't get the position. But when I look at it I'm Sooo glad I didn't! It's NOT like home style Brasilian cooking... with that soul, that flavour! And get this - the people that work there are NOT Brasilian either. Eu sou Brasileiros (I am Brasilian), and I know how Brasilian food is cooked and is suppose to taste. Maybe they mean Brasilian ""Inspired"" or ""Fusion,"" but the flavours remind me more like a Spanish American dish, the way Dominicans or Puerto Rican people cook Smh  Even where I'm working now washing dishes and prep cooking, I work closely with a BRASILIAN chef and BRASILIAN employees who know our culture's cooking - Fogo de Chão doesn't compare. However, I didn't wanna seem sour about not getting hired here, so I just figure I have extra dough in my pockets these days, and want to splurge - why not see what's the big deal here... And lo and behold! I Wasn't Missing Anything At All LMAO!  I ordered the braised beef rib slider, with caramelized onions, smoked provolone, on a brioche bun, trust me, wasn't anything special. Their feijoada wasn't that great neither. In case you don't know what ""feijoada"" is, it's a black bean stew, with sausage and beef, spices and herbs. I think the spices were there... but the stew was TOO damn soupy, and some the beans kinda mushy, so I don't know... Not how I usually make a black bean stew, unless I'm heading for a lukewarm tasting bean soup or chilli like Fogo de Chãos' nasty mess... Ewww. And what kills me most - it's a Brasilian Steakhouse... with no Brasilian cooks!? Whatsoever! Folks, don't waste your time or money here. Half that stuff they making there you can make at home with the right ingredients. Funny how NYC restaurant employers and staff are so busy trying play racist and favouritism amongst who they hire or serve (especially when you're a dark-skinned, Black/Latino man like myself), but none of these bitch asses know how to cook a good meal Smfh But we all know that old saying goes: 'when one door closes, another opens.'

She was very nice and we were offered a free round of wine. Although it was a nice gesture we had plans to go somewhere else for an hour.

Because this place was great! Except this ONE SERVER he was HORRIBLE  . Not sure if he was racist sexist or just a douche of a persons! I'm a small person and I know that sometimes people don't take me seriously for that reason but he kept ignoring me! Even when I straight up asked him for something!! So RUDE!! Never have I ever. I wish I got his name so I could reach out to management! Like why would you treat your customers that way! Or anyone for that matter  ! I don't get it ! The salad bar and meats were amazing! So was the wine! And even dessert . The place is really nice! Really wish this one server wasn't so awful! Really takes away from the experience,2,3,1,Sabah S.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,47,116
5.0,2/21/2019,"By far the best Brazilian food in the US. I often feel like I'm far away from my home country; therefore, I turn to Fogo and their full experience. The meats are incredible, the servers are all quick on their feet, the atmosphere is perfect (not too loud). They have a large variety of exotic Brazilian food in the salad bar, and some amazing and tasteful cuts of meat. I particularly enjoy the Fraldinha due to its flavor and tenderness (you don't even need a knife to cut it!!)I go there a few times a week and if you're ever in a city with a Fogo, I'd highly recommended it.The desserts are also so delicious.

They had seated us under the steps away from the center aisle so the staff that walks around with the rods barely made it over to us.

Our reservations were at 845 but we got there at 8 and was able to be seated immediately, which was beautiful. You go up to the buffet area where there are salads, fruits, this honey glazed bacon that was amazing; pretty much various sides. Then for restaurant week you had sides of mashed potatoes and 2 other items I can't remember and tried as much meat as possible. So many I couldn't even remember the names, unfortunately but most of them were good. More on the salty side for me but I think I'm a little more sensitive to salt than the average. It was a nice experience, so I would come again and be more intentional with my meat choosing. Everyone was friendly. My boyfriend bought me a ring and one of the waiters got really excited thinking he proposed lol. Overall, my experience was a good one. Drinks were Eeh.

4.0,1/30/2019,"It was my third time coming to Fogo de Chao (second time at NYC location) and every time I've visited, I came for restaurant week. Since my last visit in Summer 2018, they've improved. It's $42 for restaurant week and they offer a few less cuts of meat (filet mignon, ribeye, beef ribs), but honestly, you don't even realize you're missing those cuts. In the future, I'd rather coming during the summer than winter because the selection of fruits and vegetables at the salad bar were lacking compared to other times I came. Not their fault though. My favorite from the salad bar are cantaloupe melons paired with proscuitto (MUST TRY if you haven't heard of/tried the pairing before, it's an Italian classic!!) I'm not a fan of olives, but there's a lot of olive options.Last time, cuts of meat were a little inconsistent; either overly salty, or not seasoned enough, or overcooked and dry, etc. But this time around, none of that! Every cut I tried was perfectly seasoned and had lots of options of medium rare to medium well. My personal favorite cuts are the lamb steak, bottom sirloin and garlic steak. I would also skip on the top sirloin because it's the cheapest and leanest cut. Their service also improved as well- my glass of water was never past the half empty mark and the servers started remembering what cuts we were mostly going for. (Shout out to the guy who was serving the lamb steak, he gave me really thick pieces every time without asking after he heard me get excited over the lamb) Overall, I left happy, very full and satisfied!

Being that I've been to over 10 of their locations, I have to say the service here is the worst by far. There were only two of us so we got put by a side table. One of us ordered the panseared salmon which took one hour and five minutes to come out. And when it came out it was as dry as a rock. About 45 minutes and we asked the waiter about the order and he had no idea we had ordered it. About 15 minutes then we got some cold bread and lukewarm mashed potatoes and lukewarm side dishes. The Salad bar was OK But it is generally much better in there Baltimore or Chicago locations. For a steakhouse, It boggles my mind how their best cut has become the lamb. Most of the beef is simply of inferior Quality and not what it used to be. Finally for dessert we had the tres leches cake which was incredibly good. Overall Going into this place one knows that they are not going to get USDA prime beef and people go more so for the experience.

And the garlic steak! Incredible juicy flavor!Everything else including the ribs, sausage and other cuts of beef very tasty as well but everything is just very salty,The salad bar which accompanies the dinner package is very good as well as the mashed potatoes,polenta and sweet bananas that accompany your meal,The drinks are outstanding and all and all it was a wonderful dining experience!I would definitely go to this place in moderation though if not you will be needing an angioplasty before you know it!

Basically we had a reservation for 7:30 so much party walked into the restaurant for our reservation. She gave us the most rude and angry look while telling us to move aside for other customers. As if we were in the wrong to be there. This was a Friday night experience. At first I thought it was just me overthinking it, but people in my party asked me if we did something terribly wrong.

I actually really liked the beef ribs but I had a second time and it wasn't nearly as good so I guess theres some consistency issues. I really wanted to love this place especially for the price I was paying but I really didn't. Even the salad bar was lackluster overall.

The flavor is always on point though.Price: I would round up to maybe $70 per person. Not a bad price for a night out in NYC. I feel it is justified based on the quality of meat.  Service:  Service is a hit and miss. I had on point service from this chain and I've had service where the waitress looked lost.

If you like to try a large quantity and variety of various above average meats that are mostly cooked medium, and don't mind the meats being a bit cool and dry by the time it's served, then this is your place.  Personally I prefer a single serving of very high quality meat, cooked exactly the way I like.",0,0,0,Jonathan K.,"Brooklyn, NY",57,333,4

The price for dinner was $42 (excluding tax and tip). I enjoyed Fogo's salad bar more than churrascaria plataforma, even though most people say they enjoy churrascaria plataforma's salad bar better. At fogo, they offer a ton of fruits, different salads (fruit salad, potato salad, etc), smoked salmon, salami, pepperoni, etc. They also have rice and beans at the 'hot' station. Fogo offered cheese bread, mashed potatoes, plaintains and some fried potato/yam thing for their side dishes. All the side dishes are mediocre but the cheese bread was amazing! They also offered 3 sauces for your steaks. Chimichurri, BBQ, and habanero sauce. They all tasted good! My favorite cut of steak was the bottom sirloin as it was not as raw as the other cuts. It was also not as tough and chewy.Like any brazilian steakhouse, it was overwhelming. It was packed for dinner but the servers/people carving the meat were very fast and efficient. Every time we flipped over our cards, they would come extremely fast. What I did not like about fogo was that all the meats were a little too raw. I love my steak medium rare but I feel like i got medium raw for everything. At least at the other steakhouse, if requested, they would bring it in the kitchen to cook the meat some more. At fogo, they ignore your request and cut you whatever slice of meat they want. I would always ask for medium or medium well because I kept getting raw slices of meat but I always got medium rare (raw). The dessert was just okay. The slices of cake were very thin.

The only thing is you can't get filet minon and a few other special meats. However there is still a huge variety of meat you can try! They also have a decent sized salad bar with really delicious greens and fruits and cheeses to go with your meat. They also served mashed potatoes and sweet and fried plantains to the table.

5.0,7/26/2018,"Meat lovers rejoice for this is your heaven. All you can eat meat perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned and best of all - it comes to you.Disclaimer to those who don't know how Brazillian BBQ works. This restaurant is $50 a head (not including drinks). You are given a plate for the Salad bar first. Here's a tip... DONT FILL UP ON THE SALAD! SAVE ROOM FOR THE MEAT! Once you're done with your salad, you're given a two sided coaster that have a STOP and GO on each side.Basically the servers come around with 15 types of meat to your table and you just sit and enjoy it. You place the coaster to the Green GO side when you want to be served. The waiters will see it and come and offer you whatever meat they have, fillet mignon, lamb chop, quail, etc. Once you have enough on your plate, you tun the coaster over to the RED STOP side. Once you've finished your plate, flip it back to the green and rinse and repeat!This place is worth the trip if you're a hungry person and a hearty eater. The quality of meat they use is evident in the taste of the food. The meats are perfectly grilled and perfectly seasoned. They aren't over seasoned so you can still taste the cuts of meat and enjoy them.Don't worry if you're not a big Beef eater - they have poultry and some lamb and pork too. No fish. And if you're a person that only eats well done beef - make sure you tell the server because each skewer has different levels of 'cookedness' from Well done to Medium.Great drinks too.

Some meats were tastier than others. The fruit was fresh which my husband and I had a lot of. The kale salad was great. The white rice and black bean sauce was good. We all were full because it's all you can eat. You can easily get overwhelmed because they come around every 5 seconds with a new meat. Overall I had a great time and the food wasn't that bad.

Enter right off the Main Street into a beautiful lobby where you can wait at a cute little bar or go straight downstairs to the dining area.Come hungry! This place offers unlimited table side service of delicious meat cuts and an open salad bar. It was an overwhelming experience with waiters busting back n forth offering slices of all kinds of meat and baskets of warm bread (my favorite). The mashed potatoes were so good! I could get enough.. no literally. I asked and asked for more but the waiter never brought more to the table so I could only think of how delicious the first small portion was. At the end of my unlimited dining experience when I could stand the sight of meat anymore we were offered a selection of desserts that all looked so good. I could only choose one unless I wanted to eat myself into a good coma. The bill for 4 people came to about $400 with tip which is pricey but worth it for the food and experience alone. It's not something I would do often but once in a while would be nice. Random side note, the bathroom has the softest most plush paper towels. It's the good stuff lol !

There were so many different varieties of meat that came out. Some types were dryer than others while others were extremely juicy.

4.0,6/11/2018,"This is a nice place to go for a one time experience kind of thing and for people who really love meat lol (I guess that would be an understatement). The indoor decor of the restaurant is very nice. The restaurant could get a little loud due to large groups. There were so many different selections of meat that it was hard to remember which cuts we actually liked lol but most of them were good. Even the chicken breast wrapped in bacon surprisingly was juicy and tender. The lamp chops were great along with the various cuts of beef and steak. As for the seasoning, it's a hit or miss. I think they don't think they spread the seasoning very well. Some parts would be super salty while others don't have much flavor. So I can see why some people complained that it was way too salty. The service was excellent. they were very attentive in serving us the meat right when we flipped the card. They came at us every few seconds actually with a different kind of meat which is great ! We never felt like we had to wait around for them to get to us.The ""salad"" bar was great too ! It's not just a salad bar. They have lots of wide variety of things too duh as different cuts of cold cut Italian meats, cheeses, potato salad, greens, salmon lox, etc. They give complimentary birthday desserts which was great ! Anything from their dessert menu. We got the papaya cream with liquor dessert. Very unique and light ! Was it worth $65 bucks per person for this ? Only if you have a huge appetite for meat and can eat a lot. I wouldn't say the meats were MIND BLOWING amazing, but they were good and if you can eat your money's worth, then great !

I really wanted to enjoy the filet mignon but it had a weird texture :( I think I drank so much water that I was more bloated from that than the actual food. Definitely pricey and not worth the $64.

I've seen a better buffet at Sizzler. The meats are salty AF and basic. What happened to having different cuts and different kinds of proteins ? Am I expecting too much for $65, before drinks, dessert and tip ? Wait, what ? Add those missing links and your bill is at, or over, a C-note. Fine, I get it. Their rent is ridiculous. Sure, overall, the staff is friendly and efficient. The restroom is very clean and maybe next time I'll throw up half way through, so I can keep the party going. I'm not sure these are reasons enough to warrant the price tag. One could do lunch at almost half the price. I'm told by staff the options are the same as it is at dinner time. I'm skeptical of this advice, but will give it a go and update, since I got a gift certificate for a free lunch/dinner. If that's true, it's kind of fucked up they charge so much more for dinner for the same menu. I'm giving this shit show 4 stars for one simple reason, it's a spectacular spectacle. Plataforma is slightly better, because you get more protein options & Rainhas (in Queens) is the gold standard.

My favorite cuts were the ribeye, filet mignon (bacon wrapped and normal), and the top sirloin. Instead of the usual fried bananas, they caramelize their bananas here too, and they are delicious!

For a reasonable set price there is this unlimited amount of meat that comes straight to you shortly after you are seated . There is an unlimited market table with fresh fruits, prosciutto, salami, nova, salad, soup, rice/beans , etc . If you need to take a break you can switch the card they give you from green to red . If you are ready for more flip the card back over . All the meat is top quality , my favorite was the chicken legs and filet mignon.

I have never in my life experience such bad service.When sitting down, the waiter spoke to us like he was doing us a favor for being there. He was not nice at all. He did not introduce himself and walked away with an attitude.They don't communicate at all. You don't know who is your waiter. You'll get asked by 5 different waiters if you want water or if you're ready for the check. After i had asked for the check and gave in my debit card, we were sitting waiting for it. Someone that looked like that manager came up to the table and asked ""Is there anything else you are waiting for?"" Sort of like kicking us out. I can't make this up.The worst of all, I had requested a birthday desert in advance. When one of the waitresses came to offer a desert menu, i secretly got up and spoke to one of them and i reminded them that i had requested a birthday dessert. The girl said she'll find out and i went to sit.THEN SHE COMES TO THE TABLE AND ASKS ME OUTLOUD ""Did you ask for the birthday dessert in advance or just now?"" ??????? Why would you go up to the table and ask this so loudly when i obviously went in secrecy  ? i mean common sense????? I told them to forget it. That it was supposed to be a surprise.I had ordered a creme brulee and my mother in law got a cheesecake, my husband did not order a dessert.They put a candle and a ""Happy Birthday"" on the cheesecake.. which was once again for my mother in law.Seriously, i do not understand how this place holds up with this service.

However they do have a salad bar that's beautiful and a wheel of parmesan cheese that they literally shave the cheese off so that was amazing. They also had a few different types of cheese which was nice. I had a nice red wine with the meats and it was a good compliment.

The meats came out very slowly and they were mostly repeats. It also took over 15 minutes to get the check and the check was sitting on the other table the entire time but the female waitress did not bother giving it to our table. We had to ask twice to get the check. I had the chicken wrapped with bacon, filet mignon, lamb, and sausage. They tasted okay. The salad bar was very limited compare to the other Brazilian Steakhouses I went to. The rice that they had was very hard too. I do not know why this place has such high ratings. I had the tomatoes, rice and beans, peppers, and fresh mozzarella. It was just so limited. Half way through the meal, the wait staff finally gave us the sides, manduras and polenta. The only highlights were the drinks and cheese bread. I also had drinks-Guava Do Sul- it has Belvedere Vodka, guava, lemon, La Marca Prosecco and the one with the cucumber in it was really good.I do not recommend this place as the service was slow and there are too many repeat meats -not enough variety.

So we celebrated my birthday and traditionally (past 5 years) we would go to Plataforma Churrascaria on 49th, however I saw this place and decided to give it a try. The reservation was made for 6, but when we got there we had three more friends who surprised me which made that now a party of 9. The Manager and greeter both refused to seat us at a larger table and when asked to utilize a table in the back that was not being used I was told it was for a party of 20, who apparently did not show up because we were there from 8 till 10:45. The person serving us (Christiana) service was horrible and we went long periods of time (10-12 mins) without anyone coming over to us serving meat. I had to apologize to my family & friends because we would not habe gotten such a lousy service at Plataforma. The mood there is always upbeat and everyone has a smile and make sure the customers are doing well. The money that was paid here was definitely not worth the service that was given. I honestly feel cheated and would not return to this Brazilian Steakhouse. Not everyone's experience will be the same, but I am just sharing my experience. At the end of the night, the server was give the check and she made a face when the bill was being split with cash & card. Then the manager comes over to the table just to give the receipts to another server to give to us. Really??? Are you too exclusive to interact with the guests?

It is a very classy, upscale restaurant without the strict dress code, uptight patrons,  and outrageous prices. I can't tell you how many different meats I ate, but never had it repeated. The dessert was my favorite. I had the tres leches and my boyfriend had the flan. Both was great as if homemade. What topped the whole experience is that we had a very polite, honest and courteous server; Julian.

1.0,3/17/2018,"If you want to finish your dinner being physically harassed ending with a 911 call and police showing up while management exemplifies what it means to be incompetent, then Fogo de Chao is the place to go too. After a lovely dinner with my 10 week pregnant girlfriend, we went upstairs to get our coats only to be approached by a man who put his hands on my girlfriend and then slapped my ass. Clearly seeing he was intoxicated, I asked the lady at the front desk (who saw everything and asked if she could do something) to call security or management to have this man escorted out. The first manager came upstairs, looked at the situation then left because he didn't want to deal with it. The employee who got our jackets said out loud, ""are you kidding me?! Did he just come upstairs, see what's going on only to leave?"" Then matters escalated as this intoxicated individual wanted to fight me. My pregnant girlfriend was getting scared, as one would expect, so I asked the employee at the desk to call 911. Finally two mangers came and had to ask the gentleman to leave. He would not leave and forced himself past the two mangers into my face and continued to try to fight me. I asked in a (forceful tone) if they would remove him from the restaurant after I heard a restaurant employee say he didn't even dine there, that he just walked in from the street. What shocked me was management let him berate my girlfriend and me with language I can not say on yelp while they did absolutely nothing about it. Finally after a few attempts of this intoxicating man trying to charge me, did they restrain him and took him outside. We waited while the police came and management did nothing to rectify the situation. They let the intoxicate man stay outside the restaurant (at one point giving the manager a hug and he actually hugged him back which shocked me because I'm just payed a $230 bill yet this guy gets special treatment with a hug). They let him stay outside the entire one so we had to wait for the police to arrive. Once the police arrive the man fled and the police even yelled at the two managers for their poor handling of the situation. If I spent $230 on dinner, i don't expect to be physically harassed and the WORST part was that management was aware and LET IT HAPPEN. This is completely unacceptable!

We were a party of 8 and we were seated promptly. We made reservations via opentable. It was quick and easy. The service was not superb, but it wasn't terrible either. It did take forever to get our drinks and bill. Also they didn't serve the sides immediately. They brought over the polenta fries and fried bananas a little late. They were also very stingy. They gave us tiny tiny platters of it; only enough for 1/person. The options were also lacking compared to others. Plataforma, a few blocks away, served yuca fries and other stuff as well. The salad bar was smaller than expectation. Most places have sushi and more seafood. This place had smoke salmon, cold cuts, rice, soup and a lot vegetable options. The cheese bread was good though. Might've been my favorite for the night. The guava alcoholic drink was delicious. It's a seasonal drink so it might not be available besides spring. A lot of the meat selection was dry, especially the chicken and pork tenderloin. The filet was pretty good, but it came towards to end of the night and I was already full from the dry meats. You have to ask for medium rare or else they'll give you the dry ends. Instead of waiting for them to come around with different meat, I suggest asking them for the specific cut you want. Overall, this restaurant is only meh but I still had a good time. If you're eyeing the Yelp cash back and you're not very picky about food then come here.

The meats were salted nicely and enjoyed almost everything they brought out from top sirloin, filets, flank steak and beef ribs. The place is a bit on the dark side and is located in a huge sunken basement area but nicely appointed. Service is a bit frantic but attentive and there are tons of staff always around the tables so you are never left looking for a waiter. The weekend brunch is a great deal and kids under 7 eat free so that is a huge plus if you're stopping in midday. However, the dinner seems to have a larger selection of meats and better service.  Personally I would go there for dinner rather than brunch. The buffet/salad bar is a little lazy here though. For example, they don't even take the seeds off the melon or skin off the kiwis. I do prefer the buffets at the other churascarias in the city.

If you don't want you just wait for another one or you can get every piece and make your stomach feel happy :) . So you basically have non stop food coming to your plate.

The first one I got, I think it was the Picanha (?) was the absolute best one of the night. It was cooked to perfection, juicy, and so tender. However, after that, the quality of the meats somehow went downhill. They started to become extremely chewy, some way overcooked, and when we asked for a certain cut, we were told they were being sent our way but we waited way too long for it. Some people just completely ignored us too. The thin cut top sirloin was delicious as well, but again, he only came around once so I wasn't able to get another piece. I really wanted to like this place but I honestly can't justify the regular price. Even with restaurant week, it was about $60-70 per person with tip.

5.0,2/22/2018,"Sometimes I feel like I should be a tougher reviewer, but Fogo de Chao worked its way up to a five star review.  My boyfriend mentioned in passing a couple months ago that he would love to go to a Brazilian steakhouse sometime.  Little did he know that I took that intel and made a reservation for his birthday.  When I finally told him what we were going to be eating, he assumed that this would be a small place where maybe he would get some good feijoada.  I wanted to take his birthday to the next level plus I knew that being from a neighboring country to Brazil, he would know this cuisine better than most.  He is always full of sweet surprises and I live to make him smile.Marcelo's eyes lit up like a jack-o-lantern as we walked down the stairs into the main dining room.  From the outside of the restaurant, it just looked like a modern, sophisticated, and rather empty bar, but the restaurant itself appeared to be fully committed for the night.  The food was just as good as I remembered, and the service bent over backwards for us.  To be fair, this was my first time coming to Fogo de Chao for dinner, and lunch seems to be a bit slow there.  Fortunately, we both brought an appetite as I went to rowing class earlier in the day and he never got around to eating lunch.  Between the cheese puff breads (which happen to be gluten free!), the picanha, the Merlot, the salad with freshly shaved parmesan, the creme brulee (which is currently his WhatsApp picture because it was decorated so festively for his special day), and it simply being a night of wintry romance, it was the perfect night. !Feliz cumpleaños a mi novio!  TQM.",1,0,0,Caroline B.,"New York, NY",457,1247,36
4.0,2/18/2018,"All hail restaurant week and restaurant week dinner pricing! For $42 you get food from their entire market table which is essentially a giant salad bar with salads, fruits, cheeses, and cured meats, as well as a great selection of their cooked meats (though a limited selection compared to their usual dinner menu). We tried every single kind of meat that was offered to us, but we got at least 4 servings of their house special sirloin, and top sirloin - all medium rare of course. The meats were all tender and juicy, some with a perfect crunch and slight bit of fat. The Parmesan pork was disappointing, but their lamb was to die for! Will I be back even if it's not restaurant week? Yes! Their cheese bread was my favorite non-meat food item.... I couldn't ravens 5 baskets of them had the server bothered to come back and re-fill my basket,My friend and I left quite full, and the reason for a 4 star instead of 5 is because I'm pretty sure their water gave the both of us stomach cramps.

I grew some balls to ask for it to go (I was willing to pay) but they said no :'( now I'm sad. Service was pretty good.

2.0,2/7/2018,"Deeply disappointed in my latest trip to Fogo de Chao for Winter Restaurant Week 2018. I always put in the time and make the trip back at least once a year. After all, who can resist all you can eat meat?You don't get the super prime cuts when you do restaurant week, which makes sense ($42 vs $63 base). It's still a good deal but I regretted making the return trip this time. I cut the bacon wrapped chicken in half and to my horror - I saw that it was still raw inside. So raw that I could still hear it clucking. It is completely unacceptable that the chicken was raw - what if I had eaten it and gotten sick? I looked over to my friends and I immediately warned him that mine was raw. And his was raw too! We flagged someone down and our waiter seemed confused by what we were saying. Eventually, he understood and had someone take it off our plates. They offered to bring us new ones as they took it away but I immediately refused. It had already ruined the experience. I can appreciate rare steak but definitely not raw chicken. That was the end of it and we weren't even given a complimentary drink or a choice of a prime meat for the raw chicken fiasco. In addition, steaks were also salty and was never served the right temperature (I just wanted medium rare, is that so hard?)Service was pretty poor during the night too. It was finally time for dessert and had a choice between NY cheesecake, key lime pie and chocolate mousse cake. We were given the smallest slivers of dessert (really different from all the prior years). The only reason that this is two stars and not one star is because of all of my prior good experience. I would say it is bittersweet that I'm never returning to Fogo but I'll just think about the raw chicken and I'll get over it.

You have waiters coming around serving high quality meat including lamb, steak sirloin, chicken, pork. The best part is that it's unlimited! I do admit you can get filled up very easily with so much proteins. Last part is dessert with choice of ny cheesecake, chocolate mousse, or key lime pie. Dessert isn't as memorable here but hey, it is a steakhouse after all. Definitely recommend! Make an early reservation bc the place fills up quickly.

For dessert I got the New York cheesecake which was much better than I expected. For the meat of the hand some of the word but salty and the part was definitely dry but if you're going for the steak or sirloin or lamb it comes out perfect. Another thing is that the cheese bread is spectacular it's taste like an asiago bagel.

The staff makes an effort to explain to you how the system works and they are attentive in regards to making sure you're getting all the meat you want. I'm pretty impressed  by the amount of items available at the salad bar. There is a great variety of fruit, cheeses, veggies and cold cuts to keep you satisfied. Now, the grand finale is the unlimited supply of meats that the gentleman walk around with and offer you (if you flip your card to the green side). I really loved the strip steak and thought it had amazing flavor but honestly all the meats were delicious. I'd pass on the chicken though because we eat chicken all the time in our every day lives so definitely just stick to the beef or lamb here. Overall I had a great experience and realized that eating meat fills you up so fast. For $42 at restaurant week pricing, this meal was priced great.

4.0,2/2/2018,"Meattttttt. I've been here three times now in the past three years, and it's been fun and coma-inducing every time. I'd recommend taking advantage of this place during restaurant week. You definitely save a lot and get a lot in return. Atmosphere: large, bars at the top and dining room at the bottom. Reservations recommended.Food: during restaurant week, I think they limit the menu only a little bit so you're not getting filet mignon or prime sirloin. No biggie though, I feel. Let me speak to the wonder that is their salad bar (they call it market table). It's is plentiful, full of fresh fruits and veggies, charcuterie to die for, and things that you wouldn't expect, like smoked salmon. I LOVE their chicken salad, it's like a mixture of chicken and veggies in a light mayo or aioli sauce. They also had this delicious butternut squash salad (i believe that is seasonal cause i didn't see it the last time i came) that had feta in it. I also love their roasted eggplants and asparagus. They also had a yummy yucca soup, and their black beans with bits of steak is tasty.All the rodizio meats are solid. They give you the option of choosing how well you want the steak and they cut the piece for you. And they're really generous with how much they give. I truly enjoy the pork sausage (super juice and flavorful) and the top sirloin (esp medium rare). The lamb is a little too gamey for me. Beef ribs are plentiful and juicy. Also, can't go wrong with bacon wrapped steak. Also, the side dishes. Like, damn. Pao de queijo are these little warm soft cheesy airy bread balls. They are so damn good and fluffy and addicting. The polenta fries are good and crispy. Not too swooned by the garlic mashed potatoes, but only because they're 100% smooth, and I like mine to still have bits of potato in the mix. The caramelized bananas are soft and really, really sweet.Desserts are just okay, but who's coming for that, right? Service: fantastic, you're never wondering where the food is and our waiter was attentive and checked on us often, even asking if we were waiting on specific meats. They also provided a bigger dessert to us during restaurant week since it was my birthday :) Solid place. Fun experience.

It's located in midtown near Rockefeller Center so driving is NOT recommended unless you want to pay an arm and a leg for parking. Its an elaborately spaced restaurant with an modern entrance and staircase to the main level of seating. There's a private room for parties or large groups and the bathrooms are pretty immaculate. The concept: Each person is given a token with a green and red side. The green side means you would like to be served and the red means you don't need anything. Wait staff will be floating around the room with a variety of selected meats including chicken, beef, and pork. As they circle the tables they will provide meat to anyone with a token on the green side. There's a flat rate for this type of ""meal"" that includes some sides like potatoes and access to the salad bar. The salad bar isn't just salad but a selection of fruits, vegetables (roasted, cooked, and raw), cheese, craved deli meats, nuts, lettuce-based salads, and other types of salads (quinoa, green bean, etc.) Altogether the experience is a bit overwhelming especially for someone like me that isn't a huge meat lover/eater.

It's a big restaurant, but the customers sit squished on top of one another. For the amount of money they charge they should really try a little harder to make the whole experience worth while not just rely on the name.",0,0,0,Em B.,"Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, NY",0,18,14

It's non stop the waiters just come and bring you meat, bacon wrapped pork, steak, rib eye, lambs, and so much more. You also get some sides of mashed potato, bread and salad. There's also an open side bar with salad toppings and fruits. Unfortunately my stomach can't handle eating that much food but it's truly worth it if you can!

We didn't even know which server was ours. all they have to do there is take orders and come back and check on us. we get our own food from salad bar and men come around with meat. The meat is to die for. But the server came once and we never saw him again. To the point that my boyfriend never ordered a second drink. We thought they ignored us because we look young. We were dressed nicely, for a birthday dinner and very patient & courteous,  but we were ignored. They also ignored the young couple next to us but served the older gentlemen in the area much more attentively. There were barely any tables but we still barely had any service. We asked for a dessert menu and waited so long that we decided to just ask for the check, which my boyfriend had to get up to go ask for. We'd also reserved the table because it was my birthday and they put us downstairs in the back, and didn't acknowledge the birthday at all. We still left 20%.

5.0,12/15/2017,"This is the famous national chain of AYCE (All You Can Eat for the uninitiated) Brazilian steakhouses. Basically, it entails a bunch of dudes circling ""the space"" and cutting off amazing cuts of meat from a metal stick (bacon-wrapped chicken, sausages, top sirloin, filet mignon, you name it). You can have as much as you want. Is this 'really' how it's done in Brazil? I don't have a clue, but Ioved it. I entertained the place having only eaten a bagel all day, and I was salivating and ate so much food. Research shows your body can take in a ton of food for like 20 minutes before it starts to shut down, so start scarfing right away after your first bite. We had to stop after 45 minutes and barely being able to walk to the salad bar, which is frankly a complete waste of time. Are you really here for salami, lettuce, and cheese?!

So my boyfriend has been talking about this place ever so often ever since we started dating, so since March, I've heard about this place a good 20 or so times. He wouldn't tell me where we were going, but I had a feeling it was Fogo since we were also celebrating our anniversary. This place is really well decorated and I felt like the wait-staff makes you feel like you are right at home. Everyone was so friendly! The salad bar kinda kicked my ass, I knew I was playing into Fogo's game. I packed my plate on and stuffed my face haha. A huge rookie mistake that I don't understand why I made it. I guess I just really wanted to try everything. I'm not a huge steak person but I was really excited about the experience! Though I didn't get to try everything because I got full very quickly, I really loved the steak that was wrapped in bacon, sooooo good!! Then at the end of it, they allowed me to pick a dessert and I picked the Tres Leches. They took my choice of dessert, wrote ""Happy Birthday Stella"" on the place, and put a candle on the cake.

4.0,12/6/2017,"One of the few Brazillian steak houses in new york. Had to try out the Churascaria experience. It's situated in a large space next to a hotel so you'll have a expansive view of the eating area as it's 2 levels. Service was nice as you brought over the different cuts of meat. A card is provided with a red side and green side. Red means no more meat and green means keep it coming. You start off with a salad bar which has many different items. Standouts were the marinated mushrooms, the papaya and melon, the large fresh wheel of parmesean, the charcuterie of salami and cheeses, and the artichokes. They also give you complimentary cheese bread, fried polenta, and fried bananas. All were deliscious. I loved the 3 items which really make a great pre dinner snack.The meats were plentiful. Chicken thigh and leg, bottom steak, and top steak, sausage, and Brazilian style cut of steak. I particularly liked the bottom steak which had nice char and flavor. They cut it to your liking, a more medium outer cut or a more rare inner cut. The showmanship is great as they cut it right in front of you onto your plate with large knifes. It's definitely a experience. Dessert standouts were the cheesecake which was very smooth. It's a bit pricey at $65 and during restaurant week $45 but i'd definitely bring friends or family here.

2.0,12/4/2017,"We've enjoyed eating at other Fogo de Chão locations in the past and were excited for an equally satisfying experience on 12/3/17. You need to show up with an appetite, the men with the meat come by your table quicker than you can eat. But that's the only thing that's quick. We waited a lot during our meal...for the drinks, the wine, the cheese balls...the bill. We wanted to order more wine and even dessert, but we sat there with empty plates and wine glasses so often that when we had a chance to finally request the bill, we took it!One gentleman (a manager perhaps?) stopped by our table and asked how our meal was. We told him we enjoyed the dinner and were done eating and mentioned that we would like to see the dessert menu. He said he would have our table cleared and that he would also have someone show us the dessert menu. Neither happened and after waiting for some time, one young lady asked if we needed anything else and we jumped on this opportunity to ask for the bill. They actually chose not to make more money off of us by not being more attentive. Odd huh?  Oh well. The meats that were brought to the table were pretty tasty (the chicken was my favorite), the potato salad was good, salad bar was okay, the rice was bland, and the feijoada was mostly just beans with very little pork in it (I recommend adding the farofa seasoning on top, it kinda needs it).Lastly, the little bowl with the pao de queijo (Brazilian cheese balls) were tiny and dry. The first bowl had four of these tiny balls in it and the second bowl that was brought to our table only had three. So the two of us split the last one. Now, you see a table with an even number of people and you bring out an odd number of these dry little balls? The fried bananas however, were pretty good. Eat some of those. Oh...almost forgot. Try and avoid sitting by the end of the staircase that leads down to the dining area. Specifically where the hosts stand and meet customers coming down those stairs. That's where we sat and the hostesses all kept leaning on the empty chairs at our table while we ate.",3,1,0,Jon P.,"San Francisco, CA",1,29,0

The large seating area is below as you descend down the staircase. We went during Restaurant Week which I think is a deal. It includes the food bar plus dessert. I think their motto here is to rush you with all the food and then they all disappear. So my advice is go slowly. Once you flip the card to show ready be prepared to say no and enjoy slowly. Of the meats I thought the pork was the best as it was the most tender and moist. I found the rest to be overly salty especially the ones wrapped in bacon.

The moment we stepped into the restaurant, I knew everything was going to be and pleasant experience. Soon as we walk in the hostesses were very nice. They looked up our reservation on the computer and then took us to our seats. Once we sat down the waiter took our drink orders, me and my puppie got a Corona and water. If you been to a steakhouse before, you know how this works. If not, let me explain it, you sit down and the meat start rolling in.. Nonstop! Literally nonstop.. Not but really, you put your belongings down at your table and you go to the salad bar. The trick is not to fill up on the salad bar, so you can enjoy all the meats that they bring around. I tried to tell my puppy that but she loves her bread. I took a little bit of salad and one pice of bread. But their salad bar is tremendous, Believe me. The end of the day you're not there for that, you're there to try all of the delicious, tender, juicy and flavorful meats. When we sat back down there is a complementary mashed potatoes, plantains and a little breads filled with cheese (cheese balls) that were marvelous. Of course my puppy had to get a second order of that because they were good. I don't blame her, They were phenomenal. Especially when they first came out, and they were nice and hot, OMG!! But who cares, you don't go to Fogo de Chão for that. You have to keep your eye on the prize which is all the magnificent meat. On the table, there is a red and green circular card. That controls the flow of the meat. You already know my puppy and I had that card on during the whole entire time, because that's what we're there for. They had all the meat you can think of, they had garlic steak, chicken wrapped in bacon, beef wrapped in bacon, ribs, sausages, Chicken with Parmesan all over it, three different kind of porkchops, skirt steak, lamb and many more. The list goes on an on. And all the meets were very flavorful, none of them were dry. The only bad thing about this place is that, the salad bar needs to be smaller. Because people get caught up on that, and you're not there for that. Me and my puppy also had dessert that dessert was amazing. We have the cheesecake with nothing on it and we had a lava cake with ice cream. Both of the desserts were very moist and also not too sweet. Some restaurants can make a really sweet cheesecake or their lava cake would not be is moist. Fogo de Chão hit it right on the money.

5.0,9/30/2017,"When went to my friend's birthday celebration last night and this place was awesome. The ambience and friendly staff makes this place a winner. Now let's talk food. Every piece of meat was cooked to perfection, seasoned with love very nicely done. The salad bar didn't have a  great selections but still good mostly fruits and greens. Rice and Beans. They also bring mash potatoes and fried plantains to the table . The deserts were delicious with plenary of choices .

5.0,9/22/2017,Love love love this place. We were taken aback by the address after having been to an old location on 3rd Ave. honestly I think I enjoyed this layout better. Elegant but not stuffy. All the staff are friendly. The meats were so fresh and came out like clock work. The buffet was fresh and fabulous as well. The market sides were also delicious! The mashed potato and the house special rib eye were my favsss! I can't wait to go back. Definitely an occasion place but would have it on the top of my list for restaurant week!!

5.0,9/22/2017,"Have been to a couple different Fogo's in different states, and I must say that their quality of food, and service is ALWAYS exceptional.  My favorite's are the Filet Mignon, the House Steak, and the tri-tip. Seasoned well, prepared awesome and tastes amazing. In case you do not know, this is primarily an ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT style restaurant.  They do offer a salad bar, but I never bother because I save my stomach space for the various protein choices that are being served. If you haven't experienced a Brazilian Steakhouse before, I would really suggest that you stop at a Fogo and try it out.  You will not be disappointed at all. It is a little bit on the expensive side, so, if you are a meat eater, then it is worth it...if you are not, or are a light eater, then you may want to try some of the restaurants' other dining options.  Either way, you will love it. Enjoy!",1,0,1,Bill B.,"Reno, NV",61,87,123
5.0,9/20/2017,"Still one of the most solid choices for steak in the city. They recently introduced some new cuts to the menu but I was only able to try the prime rib (from the new cuts), which was great. I usually stick to the fraldinha, picanha, alcatra and lamb (leg, chops) - and I am never let down. Make sure to always have some farofa (manioc flour), vinaigrette and hot pepper on your plate to make the experience more enjoyable. They keep bringing deep fried polenta and bananas to the table - don't miss that.Service was super kind, fast and attentive. At some point I asked for a specific cut to one of the waiters and in less than 3 minutes someone brought it directly to me from the kitchen, which was amazing.

1.0,9/3/2017,I want to give this establishment NO STARS. BUT TO ENTER A REVIEW I AM FORCED TO GIVE IT 1 STAR. So I go out with the Mrs. Once a week for date night. We are big fans of Brazilian Steakhouses. This place as beautiful inside as the building is outside.  However there was not match with its food or service. Our waiter took almost 25 mins to take our drink order (we ordered a bottle of red wine) took another 30 mins for the wine to get to the table. We only saw our waiter 2 more times over the next almost 90 minutes we were there. Once he stopped and topped off our wine. And once to bring us the check.  The meat was severely overseasoned. The salt content was almost unbearable. My Wife couldn't even eat the meat she was given. After trying multiple items they brought to the table I suddenly felt very warm and flustered. My stomach tightened up. I felt like I was going to faint. I walked to the bathroom and began to vomit. Almost to the point of tears from the pain. While I was in the bathroom she decided maybe ordering desert would be ok. She ordered the flan.  What she received as flan was an absolute disgrace. Looked like an overcooked egg custard. There were no air pockets in the flan and it tasted like straight egg. The strawberry that came with it was so under ripe the fork wouldn't pierce it. That was the last draw. We left. Not even 10 feet out the door my wife began to vomit. The process repeated several more times on the way to the parking garage. We were forced to stop FIVE more times on the trip home to vomit. And spent most of the remainder of our night at home in the bathrooms. I myself am a Chef. To me this was one of If not the most horrific experience I've ever had to endure. I find when you go out to a top rated zagat restaurant. Spend almost $300 on dinner for 2 people only to get sick from it  that right there is a valid sign why being clean and conscious of your materials and ingredients is so important! Undercooked meat and cross contamination is VERY DANGEROUS!Seasoning should be added for flavor enhancement. Not dumped onto beautiful cuts of meat like it was. Respect your ingredients. And more importantly respect the meat you serve. These animals give their lives to feed you. If you don't know how to properly season. You should not be on the line. Save your money and avoid this place at all cost!,5,1,0,Anthony M.,"Hewlett, NY",0,3,0

My personal favorite was the top sirloin and the house specialty picanyo (i think), which is apparently the most expensive cut of meat...more than filet mignon.We were stuffed by the end, so we skipped dessert and I walked home to burn some calories.",0,0,4,Harris B.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",32,74,11

Everything flowed smoothly from easy parking, to quick seating, and a good meal. The cheese bread was so amazingly good I wanted to sneak some in my bag and take home. The cocktails are a bit pricey at $16 but tasty. I had one with coconut cream. I can't remember the name but it was sweet, strong, and had lime. Others complained that the sides and salad bar weren't up to par but I enjoyed it all. Everything was fresh and good quality, seasoned or marinated well. For restaurant week you don't get all the cuts of meat they usually offer but it's still more than enough to put you in a coma as they keep coming and coming and aren't shy with the portions. My favorite cut was the leg of lamb. Dessert was included but I was too full so I took it to go but I peeked in the bag it was a tiny morsel of pie. Oh well. My only complaint is that some of the meats were high blood pressure salty. There were a few times I could taste grains of salt in my mouth.

4.0,8/10/2017,"Stopped by for Restaurant Week lunch and was not disappointed. The salad bar was not the most impressive one that I have ever seen, but it had some solid options. Honestly, don't be that guy who goes to rodízio to focus on the salad. The rice and feijoada sides were pretty good and they tasted authentic. Make sure to smother them with farofa (toasted yucca flour). Their signature hot sauce was very flavorful. We made reservations for 3 pm, not knowing that it's when they close for lunch. I'd recommend coming earlier than that so you can sample more of the meats. We had lots and lots of picanha (top sirloin), which came often and it was delicious. The restaurant week menu supposedly includes 10 out of 14 or 17 meat options. You get the sides: pão de queijo (Brazilian cheese bread), mashed potatoes, some fried bananas (skip) and polenta. The service was very chill, but still very efficient and polite. Plates were cleared out often. Water glasses were refilled without having to ask. Our server politely stopped by, before they closed the grill for lunch, to see if we still wanted to have anything brought out. We were so stuffed by then, but luckily for us, there's always room for dessert. We shared the key lime pie and took the chocolate cake to go. Definitely a solid place. Most likely a lot more impressive at dinner time. Great place for groups. I think that they offer happy hour starting at 4 pm (aka Caipirinha time! lol). Make sure to make a reservation. I highly recommend wearing loose clothing and coming here prepared to eat a lot.",3,2,1,Carina C.,"New York, NY",166,409,469

It was so tender and melted in your mouth- The flank steak was also noteworthy- Bottom sirloin wasn't as good as the top sirloin, but still delicious.- Bacon wrapped steak was a bit overcooked, but the flavors were good- Skip the bacon wrapped chicken!I had also called earlier to see if I would be able to order chicken hearts since it was restaurant week. They're usually not on the regular menu, but just ask for them! These were the highlight of the dinner - they were marinated well with a blend of spices.

2.0,8/7/2017,"So disappointed at this restaurant. I came here two years ago with my friends and I absolutely loved it. However, when I came here again a few days ago, I decided that I will probably never come back. I heard that Fogo de Chão was participating in Restaurant Week (RW) and my boyfriend loves meat so I thought that this would be the perfect place to take him. I called two days before my actual reservation date to ask some questions and to reserve our spot. I originally wanted to go on Saturday but was told that the RW menu was only available on Mondays-Fridays. However, the lady on the phone informed me about their Best of Brazil menu, which was available during dinner times. She also informed me that it was $39, a few dollars cheaper than RW. Since I wanted to go on Saturday anyways, this sounded perfect for me. I asked her what was the difference between the Best of Brazil menu and the RW menu and she literally said, ""not much"" so I took that as a good sign since we would basically be getting the RW menu. Just note that the RW menu and the Best of Brazil menu does not include meat cuts!I informed my friend of this deal and she started questioning all of the information that I gave her because $39 seemed too good to be true. Thus, I called again (same day) to confirm that dinner was $39 and another lady said yes. On the actual day of my reservation, I called ONCE AGAIN to confirm that the Best of Brazil menu was $39 because I did not want to pay an additional $20+ when I could easily go during RW for $42. The person that I spoke to on the phone confirmed yes. So, I happily went along with my boyfriend during our reserved time. My boyfriend and I had a very light lunch in anticipation for our big dinner. If you're hungry, the food generally tastes better, right? Not for Fogo De Chão! Maybe my taste buds changed over the years but I thought the quality of the cuts of meat were just average and way too salty. I found myself drinking a lot of water and eating items from the salad bar to cleanse my palate because of how salty the meat was. I honestly think that my boyfriend could make better steak. On the bright side, I loved their salad bar. They have a delicious homemade vinaigrette that everyone should try! Also ask for their chimichurri sauce. It helps bring out more flavor in the meat. In terms of service, the meat carvers took a while to come to our table at times. We didn't mind it too much since we were not in a rush. The waitress also barely came to refill our water, but that was also not that big of a deal to us since they give you a huge glass to begin with. Now, here comes the worst part of the night. We ask for the check and are charged the full price of $63.95 per person. You can probably envision my confusion as I literally asked three different people on two different days if my reservation was $39 pp. I thought that maybe I was charged more because I didn't finish a few scraps of meat? But nope. I asked the waiter to clarify as to why I was charged that price and she said it was because I had the full experience. I told her that I asked people over the phone and confirmed that it was $39 pp and she tells me that that price is for lunch only. I knew that was wrong because the lady over the phone clearly said it's for dinner and on Facebook, it also says it's for dinner. The waitress seemed kind of annoyed at what I was telling her so she brings a manager over. The manager came and asked me what happened and I explained to him everything that I was told via my three phone calls and the promotion on Facebook. He then asks me to show him the Facebook promotion, so I did (I thought this was kind of rude because it felt like he didn't believe me, but oh well). He then proceeded to tell me that I had to tell the waitress in the beginning that I was here for the Best of Brazil menu and that I had the full experience, hence the full price. I take the full blame for not mentioning it in advance because I didn't know. However, I wish that one of the three people that I spoke to over the phone explained that to me so I could have done that. Maybe it was something that I should have known? I don't know. But if you're interested in the Best of Brazil menu, TELL THEM IN ADVANCE when you get seated! Fortunately, the manager told me that he would change the price to $39 pp so I paid about $100 for two people (thank you to the manager who changed the price!). I did really appreciate that the manager was understanding of the situation towards the end.$100 or $200, I don't think I would come back here solely because the meat was way too salty and mediocre. But if you like really salty meat and want unlimited amounts of it, then Fogo de Chão may be the place for you!",2,0,0,Sharon H.,"New York, NY",576,14,33
5.0,8/7/2017,"This is not our first time eating here but it was our friends.  No matter first time or not -  we all had such an amazing evening.  First of all it was packed which surprised us since it was a bit later on a Sunday night.  Even though very busy -  the service was amazing.   Our friend noticed that the first time we flipped our cards to green we had someone there with a meat offering within like 10 seconds.  Our food was SO good.  I never though of myself as a ""rib-eye"" gal but have been thinking about how good that rib-eye was ever since.  The salad bar too, is outstanding.  You want to be careful you don't overdo that! We asked for and quickly got both horseradish and Chimicuhurri Sauce.  Our cocktails and our wine was delicious.  Then we met Gilson, the manager.  What an amazing guy, very friendly and legitimately interested in us having a great evening.

4.0,8/7/2017,"3.5 starsCame here with friends for restaurant week! Even though we arrived a little after our reservation and one person short, the hostess still had no problem getting us seated. I don't know why people make it seem like getting a reservation here is harder than finding the meaning of life...We literally just made the reservation a few days before. No need to reserve a month in advance. There is a clear distinction in where you are seated depending on whether or not you choose the RW option. We got seated in an isolated area in the back corner, away from everyone else but whatever, more privacy. After you are seated, you start by going up to the salad bar for cold options. They have some expensive items like prosciutto and fancy cheeses but everything else is pretty common (ex. potato salad, roasted peppers, bread, etc.). After you return to your table you can flip the little card that they give you to the green side and the workers will start coming over with the meats. I was worried that they were only going to bring over the expensive cuts once, as some reviews say they do, and only keep coming with the less expensive stuff like chicken, but they actually do bring over the good stuff like steak a couple of times.Excellent:- All 3 cuts of sirloinMeh:- Lamb (only because it was a bit undercooked)- Pork ribs (too dry)- Bacon wrapped chicken (too dry)- Pork sausage (too salty)In addition to the meats, the waiters also bring over pao de queijo, polenta, mashed potatoes, and bananas, all of which were good apps. Dessert was a sweet way to end the meal. Get the chocolate mousse cake! So good!Overall, I would consider this a good RW experience. Service was excellent and not snooty at all. Our waiter was literally the best. It's a fancy restaurant but the dress attire is casual. There were some diners dressed in suits but also a good amount of people wearing t-shirts and jeans (us included lol) so you definitely won't feel underdressed. As a summary of the food, you really have to be a meat lover in order to enjoy this place. I thought I liked eating meat but it honestly got a bit too much about halfway through to the point where I needed to balance it out with some carbs. Very good deal overall and I had a good time.",2,1,0,Kevin E.,"Brooklyn, NY",84,612,973
4.0,8/6/2017,"Tip - Come HUNGRY.So glad I made a reservation weeks in advance for Restaurant Week dinner here! I love the concept of unlimited food, or unlimited meat for that matter. RW price for dinner was $42 per person and we ordered a pitcher of sangria for $40. The RW diners are not offered the higher quality meats, therefore I would want to come back just to enjoy the full experience next time. We were offered 3 types of beef (they only came around once), and the pork, chicken, lamb and sausage people came back repeatedly. The steaks were seasoned so well and extremely juicy - I wish we could've gotten more of it :( Once you flip your button to the green side, the meats just keep on coming. There is also a large salad bar with cheese, vegetables, fruits, rice and soup available to complement your meal. At the end, we could choose key lime pie, cheesecake or chocolate cake for dessert. Overall it was a wonderfully filling meal, and I really enjoyed the entire experience of this Brazilian BBQ restaurant.",2,2,0,Kara Y.,"New York, NY",20,90,220

Personally, I'm just not a huge meat eater, and this place serves about the entire farm. Fine cuts of all different meats, chicken, 3-4 different cuts of beef, pork, etc. but I just can't keep up with the big boys. They serve endless amounts of whatever you want. I do however love their customer service, ambiance, and salad bar. Even if you're not a huge meat eater they offer an amazing variety of cheeses, salads, and toppings etc. along with some sides brought to your table.

2.0,7/13/2017,"The quality and abundance of the meat is top notch. That said, all the meat is so heavily salted that the flavor is seriously compromised, and in some cases totally ruined. In one cut of meat, I literally found myself chewing salt crystals inside the steak. Overusing salt is a poor man's solution for adding flavor. The chefs at a restaurant of this caliber should be skilled enough to develop flavorful marinades to enhance the flavor of the meat without salting everything to death. I actually felt physically ill after my meal, with a dry mouth and dizziness as my blood pressure skyrocketed. The crazy thing is that I don't even have high blood pressure.

Also when you tell them it's your bday they'll throw in a decently large sized cheesecake size for the table to share!Overall I thought the garlic steak and ribeye were the best ! They also give table side dishes like mashed potatoes, plantains, and a bread-like roll (i forgot the real name!) my friend complained that a lot of their meats were super salty (might depend on what cut/slice Yu actually get).

1.0,6/22/2017,"My family and I were very excited to try this restaurant since we are big fans of Texas de Brazil, however, Fogo de Chao was a huge disappointment and we will never return. First, within minutes of being seated my son felt something wet on his back. We looked up and noticed drops of water falling from the ceiling, it appeared to be air condition condensation. We were promptly moved to another table and ordered drinks with our server; wine for my husband and me, 2 Shirley Temples for my kids. The server disappeared so we placed another drink order with another server. Our wine arrived but the Shirley Temples did not for the rest of the meal even though we kept asking our server about them. Then my son asked for ketchup with his meal, which also did not appear until we finally asked the 5th server. The service was the worst I have ever seen at a Manhattan restaurant. I continue... the meat that was sent out was low-quality, like sausage, pork or chicken. We told our server, as well as all the gauchos (the guys serving the meat), that we like rare red meat but none came out for another 15 minutes, everything was medium-well done up to that point. A manager came over to see how our meal was going and we told him we were waiting all night for the filet mignon and lamb chops but have yet to see them even though we asked our server several times. Then finally we started to see rare meat come out which was just OK tasting and had a chalky texture (the obvious sign of poor-quality meat). Also, ALL the meats are overly salted, to the point that you cannot eat much of it. Towards the end of our meal, we finally were served the filet mignon and the lamb chops but we couldn't eat much of it because by that point we weren't very hungry anymore.  This is all part of their master plan: mediocre, overly-salted meat, cooked too much, with poor service and they wait for the end of the meal to send out the good cuts of meat. It was a very disappointing experience. Going forward, the only churrascaria we will ever eat at again is Texas de Brazil. There is simply no comparison.",2,0,0,Eva S.,"Ardsley, NY",6,25,1

As for the Radizio itself, the beef ribs and top sirloin were my absolute favorite. Everything was cooked to medium, perfectly pink and juicy.  We did go for dessert at the end, finishing off our meal with creme brulee which was finger-licking good. This meal was also priced very well given the quality of the meat, the selection and the all you can eat nature of the restaurant. The only thing we were missing was grilled pineapple.

Pao de queijo was more like a biscoito globo: not a Pao de queijo at all I always sad that there was no restaurant service in this entire country like the one  FDC provided. I guess not in NYC.

4.0,4/10/2017,Super friendly service and very welcoming to young children. In fact kids under 6 eat free!!Beef ribs were awesome. In fact we weren't disappointed with any of the beef. The chicken was also  tasty.  The sausage was spiced so it's not good for the kids.  The buffet bar is a little lacking. They had no or limited pasta dishes. So the poor kids had no pasta but  they had plain white rice. Only request - Less hor devours and more sides please.  I am looking forward to returning and enjoying the delicious meats!!,0,0,1,Macy T.,"Tarrytown, NY",37,177,145

I enjoyed the selection of cheeses, meats, antipasti and rice topped with pork.I am a HUGE sucker for the cheese filled bread that is served at the beginning of the meal too.My favorite meats: chicken wings and sausage. I thought the chicken was cooked well, crispy skin and delicious center. The sirloin steak-medium temp was nice and juicy and seasoned very well.My fiance had the lamb and he said it was very good too.The space is huge and although it was crowded, I had no trouble hearing my table's conversation.We ended the night splitting the flan and chocolate lava cake.

We were supposed to have mashed potatoes/polenta/bananas refilled like the other tables around us, but we only got the original one. We also never got drink refills. The managers came over at the end after we waited almost 30 minutes for a cup of coffee. When she heard what happened she brought the coffee straight out. Then she came to check again but we had been sitting for another 45 minutes waiting for the check. She tried to make up for it by taking the drinks, dessert and coffee off the bill and giving us a gift card for a free dinner but being forgotten for 3 hours left its mark.

3.0,3/18/2017,"I've been to many Brazilian steakhouses. This place was good. The way it works is you get unlimited meat which is passed around by a waiter and a buffet style salad bar. The salad bar was my favorite part. It was amazing! There was many options (rice, beans, kale salad, Greek olives, huge block of fresh parmesan cheese, fresh mozzarella, prosciutto, and a lot more). Service was outstanding. My water glass was never empty. They were all extremely attentive, nice and helpful.  My boyfriend and I came here because I love meat but he doesn't eat red meat LOL. They are very  accommodating. There is an option for a fish dish a la cart which includes the salad bar ($50). The fish wasn't great. It comes with a mango sauce which was good but the fish itself wasn't good. The meat was okay. The reason I'm giving this place  3 stars is because of the meat selection. It was good but I was expecting it to be better since it's such a known place. I think it's overpriced for the quality of meat.We got one unlimited meat selection, one fish dinner, and 2 drinks it came out to $190 with tip and tax. Overall, it was a great experience.

The meat was not salty, with the exception of the bacon wrapped meats. For the most part, every side is cold except for the soup, rice, beans and potatoes. Two downfalls-The cold salad bar selection lacked starches and cold salads. Also, the price for alcoholic beverages were outrageous!

My phone was low on battery, and I happen to have it readily available in my pockets since I am out of town.. I asked the server if he was able to charge it for me, which he obliged to. The unlimited salads at the salad bar was pretty amazing, but you should save your stomach room for all the meat! .. Eduardo and Eric, the servers, were awesome!! They both came by often and asked how we were, asked what kind of meat we wanted, the cut we wanted and made sure we were attended to the whole night (they came and made sure I had nice rare filet mignon cuts ). Although the food was what you would consider ""fine dining"", the experience was more than worth it, and the service was amazing.

4.0,2/18/2017,"I think this is one of the better Restaurant Week deals. The food is basically the same as a regular dinner with the exception of a few higher end proteins. But overall, it's very solid choice for RW. I came with a group of four and we were all pretty surprised how large the restaurant was, you really can fit a ton of people in there. One point of mention about their food, I have to give credit to their salad bar, their salad bar was pretty awesome. Their marinated mushrooms, asparagus, grilled veg, greens and gherkins were all great, the cheese wheel was a nice touch as was the charcuterie board. Overall, I enjoyed the food but it did find the food to be salty since I was pretty dehydrated later on in the evening. I also thought, even for RW, it was too expensive, I think you would have to eat yourself silly to justify the price.The food:Picanha- This is the signature item at all Brazilian rodizios, and this was my favorite item here. Picanha can generally be very hit or miss but the one here was extremely juicy and tender with a nice outer char.Alcatra-Top sirloin- This was my second favorite piece, it was really good and tender, it kinda had the look and feel of sliced brisket.Costela de Porco- Pork Ribs. I enjoyed this, it didn't have the most meat but I really liked the char from the rotisserie, I also really liked the seasoning on the ribs.Linguica- Pork sausage. I really liked their Lingiuica a lot, it had a really great mouth feel, it was nice and juicy and I loved the flavor.Chicken Leg- I normally don't say much about chicken, because it is chicken, but the one here was super juicy and tender. I hate to say it, but get the chicken leg lolGarlic Steak-  I am a little mixed about this one. While I enjoyed the tenderness of the meat, the seasoning was kinda off putting for me. It was some type of garlic paste but it had a weird flavor and left a weird feeling in my mouth afterwards.Fraldinha- Bottom Sirloin- This was just OK, it definitely was not as sexy as the Top Sirloin.Bacon Wrapped Chicken- The one thing I learned about riodizios is that bacon wrapped anything is usually disappointing. This was juicy and tender enough but it was missing the umph.Bacon Wrapped Steak- I think I preferred the bacon wrapped steak over the bacon wrapped chicken. The flavor was good, but like the above, it was missing that wow factor.Cordeiro- Leg of Lamb. This was my least favorite and the shocker piece. I love lamb and when I saw it, I thought I was going to love it, it was not as flavorful as I was hoping, it was actually kinda boring, really.",14,8,12,Ben L.,"Queens, NY",978,1001,2785

Everything else they had was good too but there was one that I didn't like at all, it honestly was just bland and I couldn't chew it enough to digest it.

For the pitcher of sangria, I don't really drink & don't enjoy the strong alcohol taste but this sangria is fruity & sweet so I like it. Good pair for churrascaria (bbq). On the table they gave cheese bread & fried banana. It taste good. They also used a circle flip go signal if you want more meat then you turn it into green & red for stop giving me meat. Haha! From the sirloin, bacon wrap chicken, bacon wrap steak, marinated chicken & many more its all delicious. All cooked perfectly base on your preference. They also ask what type of meat do you want, medium or medium well but I myself like medium.If you're a meat lover then this is the place for you. I highly recommend going here with an empty stomach.

4.0,2/12/2017,"This is the first first to hit for RW this season. Unfortunately, I made the poor decision of having two slices of pizza 2 hours before having dinner at Fogo. Unlike my dining partners who one had 3 cookies all day and the other had a yogurt for lunch. So when we sat down at our table, I was worried I wouldn't eat my money's worth. We hit the salad bar. It wasn't an amazing selection but it had the basics. I particularly love the kale salad. It took a while before the carved meat was offered at our table. It started with the garlic steak which was amazing. However, it never came back around. I also like the sirloin steak. I tried the parmesan pork and it was dried. We had originally declined the lamb because we wanted to finish what we had. The lamb miraculously never stopped by again. Every time the guy would walk right past our table and not even make eye contact. We tried to tell the wait staff if they could have the lamb over as that was the last type of meat we wanted to try. It took 3 people later for the lamb to finally be over. However, the wait was not worth it. My dining partners thought the lamb tasted gamey. I thought it lacked seasoning. Oh well. For dessert, I had the chocolate mousse cake. It was not bad for a RW included dessert. I would love to try the peach cream next time. I think the medium cuts of any of the beef at Fogo are probably better choices than the chicken, pork, or lamb. I'm taking a point of because the service is subpar, but if you want decent selection of meat in one sitting, this is the place to be.

Is it pretty spacious yet romantic?  5/5Was planning on going to Texas De Brazil but realized, it moved or went out of business, so my friends and I came here for restaurant week (you get all the same things but at a discounted rate - I believe it's about $15 cheaper - make your reservations in advance).  Things I liked. The beef, sirloin was my favorite along with the lamb. We kept asking for the edge pieces. Must get those charred edges. The cheesy bread upon arrival was pretty bomb.I've been to several Brazilian restaurants, and this one was underwhelming. Other places, had lobster bisque, grilled pineapple, and chicken hearts. The salad bar wasn't all that exciting, there were a lot of cheese options and cut up fruit.

3.0,2/6/2017,"The word ""churrascaria"" really rolls off the tongue. Unfortunately, so does some of the meats served during restaurant week. It's roughly $15 cheaper than regular fare, minus the higher quality meat cuts. Hardly worth it, except for the complimentary dessert and the fact that I can say I've finally eaten at a Brazilian steakhouse.Despite my better instincts, I sampled the chicken and pork, both of which were husks of rather bland meats. Lamb was well marinated, although it didn't have that charred taste I look for in most lamb dishes. I believe the only steak cut I enjoyed was the sirloin. It sported a fair amount of gristle and lathered in garlic butter. Ugh, that was good. All the other cow parts seem lacking in moisture or heavily covered in salt. Not entirely a bad thing... just had higher expectations. There weren't any distinct flavors, so it's hard to give any reason why this steakhouse stands out. I didn't even touch the drink menu. For $18 a glass, I'd rather be caught passed out in an alleyway with a bottle.The dessert is obligatory if you want to make the Restaurant Deal worth it because I'd rather pay the $15 more to have an unlimited amount of the higher cuts.

It's a bit out of my price range for a normal dinner so when I saw they were participating in Restaurant Week I jumped. $42 for several courses of meat, unlimited salad bar / set side dishes, and dessert is a total steal. The only time I had a similar experience was at this Argentinian place in Hackensack that burnt down a week after I went there and Yelped it 5 stars RIPANYHOW, I had a good time over here at ol Fogo de Chão - the salad bar had a great selection of various cheeses, vegetables, salads, and even some prosciutto and salami. The plantains, the mashed potatoes and the pop-over-esque bread were amazing. As for the cuts of meat themselves - it was a satisfying variety of various types of meat, the stand outs were the sirloin cuts, the excellent garlic steak, the parmesan pork chop and those like, whats its, the meat cuts in the Yelp photo. Those guys. Yeaaaaaaaaah.All in all, good times.

4.0,2/2/2017,"I've never dined at an ""Authentic Brazilian Barbecue"" venue before so this place was a sure eye-opener. We made a reservation for a party of 3 for a Thursday evening. We were quickly seated and our waiter explained how the ordering process works. The meat was never ending, and you had your choice of different kinds and cuts of meat. They ranged from lamb chops to fillet mignons and smoked sausages. The meats were literally cut right in front of you to the doneness  of your choice. I had a majority of my steaks medium rare- medium. Just the way I like it. There was also an open salad bar that consisted of cooked rice, different cheeses and deli meats...which I later took advantage of. The starters here weren't bad either. Definitely try the garlic mashed potatoes, polenta and cheese bread. We settled for dessert at the end of our meal. Dessert was a great way to end a big meal.

3.0,2/1/2017,"I came here with a party of 16 for a friends birthday, there seemed to be some kind of confusion even tho we had called in advanced and made reservations. After being seated a server came and instructed the table on their system of serving the meats and etc. It was basically an on and off button for whether you are ready for more meats or not. One side being red and the other green so you just flip it over to your desired color. The food itself was average for a Brazilian steak house, I've had better and I've had worst. After a while all the meats kind of taste the same, just a tad different in texture. The salad bar didn't have a huge selection but it was decent. I really enjoyed the candied bacon ( but then again it's bacon so how do you really go wrong with that). All beverages are not included. Overall I only gave them a three star, because it's a bit pricy (I've had better in Long Island for cheaper) and the wait with a reservation cause them a star each.

We were never given clean plates so I ate my meat on my salad plate and I did not fill the meats were in rotation like i'm use to. there was only one server that actually asked how I liked my meat done. Everything was either under cooked or over cooked usually i'm eating until I can't eat anymore but this night i actually walked out ready to go somewhere else and eat.

It's over when I hate myself."", then you will have the time of your life here. Luckily I fit squarely into this category so I was in heaven for 30 minutes before being relegated to food coma purgatory. This place reminds me of Bacchanal in Las Vegas, where you can have a similar experience.This place has an unnecessarily huge entrance which leads down to the main dining area. Kinda like the surrounding banks in Midtown with their imposing but empty lobbies designed to impress. It was like a metaphor for the sheer scale of the meats offered here.Y'all know the drill here. Flip the dual sided card green side up for more meat, and red if you want a break. The waiters were really good about bringing the meat promptly and filling up your plate, but seemed deaf to or were unsympathetic to my repeated pleas for ""medium-rare"". I kept getting the parts of the meat on the outside, which may suit some folks but to me is too burnt, well-done, and salty. Regardless, half the cuts I got were tender and tasted great.The restaurant week dinner special was $43 for 10/16 meats which was a pretty good deal to eat here. You'll be missing out on the filet mignon and lamb chops but there's still plenty of variety. They do go around more than once, in contrast to what one of the reviewers said below.

This isn't my first time eating Brazilian style cuisine and I feel like Ive had better in comparison. We ordered a bottle of wine and the wine was pretty good but I expected a bit better. Overall this is more of an experience. It is fun and definitely something awesome to try!Now as far as pricing we came for restaurant week. So instead of $62.95 pp it was $42 pp. What I was not aware of is the fact that a) you only get 10 out of the 16 meats. Therefore you will miss out on filet mignon and other prime meats and b) they only come around ONCE! Do not pass anything up because it will not come around again if you have special pricing such as during restaurant week. They will NOT tell you this!

3.0,1/15/2017,"Overrated and overpriced.Ive heard a lot about Fogo and I'll even say that maybe this location is just mediocre, but I will definitely go to another restaurant when I want better options for a cheaper more reasonable price.First off, the general ambience of the place is very nice. It is in Midtown, so you should always opt for reservations than walking in imo.The service this night was perfectly fine. Our bread, sides and water were consistently refilled and our waiter was attentive enough.But the food here was a complete let down. I always hear about the salad bar at Fogo and how big and plentiful it is, so maybe it was just this spot but they had just about next to nothing for a Friday night. The only thing I really had any interest in was the cesar salad and some sides of fruit. The meats seemed OK, there was an improper ration of beef to just about everything. We were only offered pork maybe twice and chicken literally once. I wasnt a fan, I felt I did not get the variety of what I was paying for. Im typically a medium cooked lover but on this night everything was a little too bloody for me personally.So for the lack of options in meats and sides (no chicken basically) for $62 dollars pp and $11 glasses of wine, paying close to $200 to eat here felt like a rip off. If I felt like the experience was amazing and there was just so much to choose from it was overwhelming, then I'd totally be okay with the price but it wasnt that at all. 3 stars, no give or take.",2,0,1,Kayla L.,"Manhattan, NY",59,140,111

The salad bar was nothing like the selection in Dallas or even like Texas de Brazil! I spent over $200 for 3 no drinks and was not satisfied at all!

How do you work in a steakhouse not knowing the basic steak sauce. Besides that we had our card flip on green and we even try waving the meat carvers down but they were busy just taking care of the bigger tables and just kept walking past us.

3.0,12/17/2016,"TLDR: Good, but not great and pretty pricey. Place is huge. Staircases almost remind me of something Escher like. Dranks:Maybe bartender was having an off night but my Manhattan was bleh (and I just came from another bar with tasty ones)  and my caparinha had probably an entire lime in it, couldn't even finish it. I had my friend try it without telling him and it was funny watching his face when the bitterness hit. Cocktails shouldn't be funny. Alcohol is serious business! They also took quite awhile to come.You start off and it's like going into battle (in a good way). Literally just minutes apart someone is dropping off more meat! Its great. You try to keep pace lol. Its like you are fighting off the hordes of meat and your belly is your only defense. Best meats: bottom sirloin (super duper good), pork rib was great too but hardly comes around (came once and I asked for it a 2nd time), and beef rib was decent but I had to ask for it a few times and it only came at the end when I was reallllllly full. Also, the mashed potatoes are heaven. I usually never eat them at a place like this as they just take up meat space buuuut I couldn't help myself as they were very good. Not so good: the house steak (skip it) and the ""pricier"" cuts. Never had filet where I thought ehhhh s'okay. Sirloin was wack, ribeye was ok, but it's ribeye, should be drool worthy. So even though they offer higher quality meats than the low cost places, they weren't worth eating. I did like how they offer you choice of doneness tho. Hate overdone meats. Wasn't that impressed with the buffet/ salad bar section either as some other users seem to be. It's nice, but nothing to rave about or pull you away from the meats really. Service was very good for the most part. Place seems to run like clockwork.I had the flan for dessert and it was pretty good, although a tad heavy.

3.0,12/16/2016,"Unfortunately I wasn't able to give it a higher rating due to the service. First off, the food is delicious. The meat selection is good and the temperature is on point.  The salad bar has an extensive selection of fresh plates and worth a whorl before stuffing yourself with delicious meat. The decor is beautiful and intimate. THE SERVICE: I as mentioned in my prior reviews, I have experience in the food service industry. A place with such rave reviews  should also have the service to match the environment. From the moment I walked in, I wasn't too happy. The hostess didn't know A from B. I arrived for a lunch party under a specific name. She indicated that she had no such party but that I should go downstairs to an inaudible room name. I proceeded downstairs and literally wondered around to find a maitre d. ( All of my colleagues shared the same experience upon their arrival) He also was not aware of the lunch party but escorted me to two different rooms to see if I knew anyone. That type of service in my opinion needs to be polished. I understand you are busy and have many things going on but it isn't an excuse. I've worked events with a high volume of guest and I can assure you, if we didn't know where everyone went we found out immediately. For a lunch party of 20+ we were assigned one waitress. Now, I feel that it would have been smarter to assign two; minimum. This waitress never replaced any water. She was asked by various people to bring more water and finally replenished it. The waitress also disappeared for most of the service and didn't clear out plates in a timely manner.  I still had my main course plate when desserts were being served. The dessert itself took a significant amount of time to be brought out. My expectations for a location that is charging premium prices will be at a high standard.

3.0,11/20/2016,"Nice place, but could work on a few things. For a party of 2, we were seated all the way in the back near the kitchen on a table of 4. As we walked in, we were held standing in front of the others, while the staff tried to figure out where to seat us, which was a big disappointment considering the price you pay here. Not only were we placed away from everyone, and given a bigger table, the staff seemed to ""hang out"" in the back, which was a little annoying. Impossible for a romantic dinner when staff is huddled up behind you chatting away, and extremely hard to focus on a conversation especially if your there for business. Besides that, the service was excellent.Love the place card concept. green means keep the food coming and if you flip it over to red, it will stop the food from coming.

5.0,9/17/2016,"While I was in the city, I brought along two friends who'd never been to Fogo (or Brazilian more generally).  They loved it just as much as I do.  The food here was as awesome as expected based on general reputation and my experiences at the Addison (Dallas) location.  Everything on the Market Table was fresh and tasty; all the cuts of meat were great - obviously the picanha's always superb, but the fraldinha (flank steak), New York strip, and leg of lamb were surprisingly great as well; I don't remember previously enjoying those as much as I did here.  Of course, there are always a few cuts (filet, linguica, the parmesan pork, the chicken) that I'm just not that into, as a matter of personal taste rather than anything else, but my friends liked them well enough and the nice thing is they have so much variety that there's something for everyone (even if they're a vegetarian...)What set this visit apart was a service detail: when we made our first and only trip to the salad bar, I was disappointed that they didn't appear to have the candied bacon (which I adore.)  I circled around several times looking for it and suggested to my friends that maybe they just didn't have it in NYC and expressed my disappointment about that to them; I'd been talking it up and wanted them to try it.Well, about halfway through our meal, one of the employees (I don't think she was a gaucho but I'm not sure - wish I'd gotten her name to give her a shoutout) walked up to our table bearing a plate of candied bacon.  She told me they'd noticed I was looking for it and that it had just finished being prepared.  This was really impressive as I never actually asked any of the staff about the bacon - I just assumed they didn't have it and filled up my plate with other stuff.  They could easily have not noticed I was looking for the bacon, or bothered bringing it out even if they did notice - we were all fresh-out-of-college-looking-kids in sweaters/t-shirts/shorts/jeans, customers they have no reason to try to impress relative to the usual New York crowd.  And even if the bacon had never made it to our table, I would've walked out of there extremely happy with the experience.  But they went the extra mile to make our visit perfect.  Big kudos to the NYC Fogo team for making my visit on the road as enjoyable as any of my visits to the location at the original Addison location - as much as the foodie in me typically objects to visiting chain restaurants in new cities when I could be trying something I can't find at home, I will definitely be making an exception to that rule for Fogo!   (Disclosure: I'm a small shareholder in FOGO so I'm obviously incentivized to say nice things about the brand.  Of course, independent of valuation, half the reason I own the stock is that it's such a great concept - the food quality, to my palate, is just as good as any prime steakhouse, and you get far more quantity and variety for a lower price.  My friend from CT now wants one in his neighborhood!)",0,0,0,Samir P.,"Dallas, TX",0,29,0

Servers then come around to everyone's tables with different selections of meat and slice it off a huge slab that you take a tong to and tear off. You literally can have all the meat your little heart wants. They also have these rolls that have cheese inside that are crazy addicting.

1.0,8/23/2016,"I've been prolonging this review for ages. I actually suggested coming here cuz of all the great reviews. We went there for lunch since there's no way I'd ever spend over $60pp on a buffet. Mass produced food is always going to be disappointing no matter what price point but I still had high expectations. I've been to the other Brazilian restaurant in midtown as well. I was contemplating just going with the salad bar even though L really wanted me to try the meat. Our waiter technically decided for me as he assumed we both wanted the full buffet after he asked us whether it was our first time...Yes it was, but that doesn't mean everyone wants the full buffet. 1 star off..We headed towards the salad bar. Grabbed some cucumber salad, mozzarella, manchego cheese, prosciutto, smoked salmon... Bacon... L was here for the meat so he didn't really bother with the salad bar. Our waiter brought us the complimentary cheese bread, mashed potatoes, polenta and caramelized bananas. I tried their cheese bread which probably was the best thing I ate during lunch. I didn't touch the other items. I know smoked salmon is supposed to be a lil salty, but it was way over seasoned for me. It wasn't thinly sliced either and it didn't taste very good. Everything from the salad bar was over-seasoned so I only had a little sample of what I brought. It needed some acid to cut all that salt. It all started to taste the same. The prosciutto was horrible, it was so thickly sliced. When have you ever had thick sliced prosciutto??? It was chewy. I couldn't swallow it so I had to spit it out. Prosciutto needs to be paper-thin! Salad bars should have fresh items to brighten the palate, but everything was so heavy and one note. Bacon was ok.. But once again, more salt. At this point I should've just looked for some plain lettuce to nibble on. Service was excellent, very attentive, they refilled our water glasses constantly. I think I drank over 7 glasses with all that salt in the food and I barely ate anything. If you're looking for a particular cut, they will gladly bring it out to you. I ate one piece of lamb chop and perhaps half a slice of steak and I was done. Salt overload. My stomach could not handle anything else. All I wanted was glass after glass of water. The lil food I ate actually made me so sick. At least the lamb chop wasn't overly salty, but the steak wasn't that good. I gave it to L. I don't recall which cut it was, but I can make a fantastic steak at home. Anyone can, it's pretty easy with the proper equipment. This is why I didn't care for the full buffet. L didn't eat as much as he normally could, he agreed that the food was overly salty, but it doesn't bother him as much as it does for me. I was hoping that he could consume more just to offset my lack of dining, but he didn't want to get sick. My meal mostly consisted of their free water, hopefully it was filtered since it didn't taste that bad. I can totally understand the price reductions or the cheaper menu options that they have right now after we dined at the restaurant. Seriously they need to stop over-seasoning everything. It's not healthy. Use fresh herbs. Different spices. Salt should not be the main ingredient. Maybe some lighter options at the salad bar. My stomach felt queasy the whole day/night. Not a great feeling while walking around Manhattan. About 6- 7 hours later, I was able to eat again and I couldn't believe how delicious a slice of pizza at My Pie tasted after consuming the worst meal I've had in my adult life. The owners at My Pie are committed to using quality ingredients.I'm not a fan of buffet restaurants in general, but it still bothers me even today how an $8 Chinese lunch buffet in Long Island is more enjoyable and didn't get me sick compared to Fogo's $40 churrasco experience. An experience I hope I never have to repeat. You'd have to pay me to eat there. I would never recommend Fogo de Chao, not to friends and definitely not to donors.Totally overrated. Salad bar was extremely disappointing. Not much of a selection. All the prepared salads are full of salt. The meat's kinda bland except for...the salt. High prices, huge restaurant in Midtown does not equal fresh, quality ingredients. It was fairly empty except for a couple of tables during lunch which is always a terrible sign. I just don't understand why this place is rated 4 stars.. 3 stars I could understand but not 4. It's not even that nice inside.Sadly I actually do have to come back and review them once more.

3.0,8/23/2016,"I've been meaning to experience a rodizio style meal. what better excuse than the olympics and restaurant week. came here for restaurant week, which is $29. however, learned that this wouldn't be the full churassco experience, excluding quality cuts like ribeye, beef ribs, and filet mignon, so we opted for the full since it was $39. you can start right away or go to the buffet table. very tasty feijoada (bean stew). I had another churassco later in the week, so this was definitely a quality feijoada in comparison. there's also smoked salmon and capers. pretty decent with the pesto sauce and capers. cheesy bread at table is addictive as well. for $40 they do a good job of coming around with all the cuts, although they don't space out the trips where they bring the meat. in this way, you seem like you living this meat dream, but there is no way you can eat all of it!! I didn't feel that they were trying to skimp in the beginning, but they did slow down gradually. meats are of good quality. they ask you how you like your meat and let you pick where you want it to be cut. would have been fine just eating the house sirloin. lamb is a bit gamey. ribeye and filet are decent but the quality of cut blurs after a while (they seemed a little dry) since you are eating so much red meat. I think it's really hard to get your money's worth. For comparison, you would pay about $50 for a nice ribeye bone-in. I didn't come close to eating a whole steak in this sitting. So you are paying for the ambiance and the experience. The concept is good, but definitely not what I expected. not as fun and not nearly as satisfying. for the $40, we didn't even get dessert even though we paid the $10 to cover the better cuts. they definitely look after the bottom line. waiter got testy after we inquired about the dessert.  after about two hours sitting there, they kept asking us if we were done. couldn't even have a decent conversation with their constant inquiries. come on. there are empty tables everywhere. not sure if i would come  back, but if I did, I would make sure to order a nice glass of cabernet. but just maybe not here.",0,1,1,Peter M.,"Fort Lee, NJ",270,414,887
1.0,8/22/2016,"Im so disappointed of choosing this restaurant for my anniversary celebration. Hubby and I used to live in FL and we had celebrate our last 4 anniversary's at Fogo de chão. We moved to Westchester county almost a year ago and since I wanted to keep the tradition I decided to hit the city and visit the New York location. As mention before I dont live in the city so I call to make the reservation and make sure everything be perfect for our special date. When I call I talk to Ashley I told her I needed a reservation for my anniversary, at the time I call she explain they were having issues with the booking system but she was placing a note to make sure they got us in schedule as soon as they fix the system. Talking to Ashley I told her I was coming from out of the city, also mention all the special details and even said that manager Ezekiel was aware of the situation and will make sure to get the reservation. I ask if I had to call again later on and they said NO. ""Everything is taken care of"". We got there on Saturday, the weather was stormy but we made it anyways. We go in and the hostess was not attentive, I just said my name and that we had a reservation, she look at me like ""whatever"" because the restaurant was not packed, the restaurant is stunning, table was ok, server ask for our drinks, and we went to the salad bar, and ready to eat. The meat and food from the bar was good as always but the sides? Omg the pao de queijo that they serve us was baked like 7 days ago, It was like a baseball ball If it hit you in the head I could kill you, the mashed potatoes and polenta frites were also like preheated. The servers were not paying attention to the flipping cards, not even to refill water. I ask the server for another bread but it never came, also I asked for some churrasco and they never approach my table with it and at that point I didn't want to get more upset and ruined my special day so i said forget it ! At the end we order coffee and obviously the dessert so I could finally celebrate with a Happy anniversary greeting after all this horrible service. but guess what? NOT even a happy anniversary on my dessert. To be honest that was heart breaking for me. Because I took the time to reserve, make the call and assure that every detail was going to be special and it did NOT happen that way, not even close it was the worse anniversary. And the saddest thing is that I could have go to so many places in NY and I pick this place. Sorry but never again they lost us as customer. Also the manager or any assistant never came to our table to ask if everything was ok and thats done in Florida so I assumed its part of the restaurant protocol guess not here.

3.0,8/21/2016,"I was very excited to try this restaurant but it did not meet my expectations. The reservation process was smooth and simple. I barely waited a minute before I was seated. The first time I noticed as I descended the stairs was that the waiter did not bother to even say anything to my party. The atmosphere is impressive. The seating arrangement are very close. Some of the staff had trouble navigating between tables. Our main waiter did not explain the menu to us. He just asked us what we would like to drink and if we were there for restaurant week. When we said we weren't, he just left. So we got started on the salad bar. The salad bar is modest. Some items were better than others. As more people filled the lower level, the smoked salmon was mostly always out. The meats were just okay. They looked delicious but tasted a bit bland. My table would always get the pieces that had the large pieces of sea salt. If we didn't, we had extremely bland meat. The lamb was inedible in some instances. The guy with the lamb chops did not understand that when we flip over our card to red that we don't want anything. But he would still come over and ask and push us to take it. My party was seated close to the back near the kitchen. Once the front of the floor began to fill, we no longer got the meats even if our cards were flipped to green. But we did get a good hour of service before we were forgotten. My table didn't get our sides until 45 minutes into service. I would see other tables receive theirs upon seating. That inconsistency was annoying. The service we received from various staff members was not good. No one was happy or even pretended to be. They were all annoyed except for the meat guys. We had to ask where the bathroom was and we were just directed to the middle of the room. I eventually found it. When it was time to leave, it took forever for our check to arrive. When it did arrive, it was wrong and they charged us for something we didn't order. The waitress who took our check didn't seem surprised by this when we brought it to her attention. The correct check took a while to arrive as well. As expected, once they came over to take our card, it actually took even longer for them to bring it back. I'm not sure how this is possible as I saw other tables receive their checks and pay very quickly. However, I did see many tables dispute their checks earlier during my time there. I didn't think it was a common occurrence. But it is. I had my experience and I'm never going back. Lunch has the same meats as dinner. If you can make it to lunch, do it.

I can't even rank the meats, they are all so perfect, you can get it how you like. I personally don't like the pork or chicken just because those meats tend to dry out over a open fire but people still enjoy them. But you can't go wrong, just get everything!

Also it happened a few times that they gave meat to 2 of us and then just left (although one more person clearly also wanted from the same meat). We were 4 in total...not that overwhelming. We did a lot of meat sharing to make sure everyone got to taste everything but really shouldnt be needed in my opinion. Meat was good but you get only small amounts.

3.0,8/18/2016,"This is my first time in a Brazilian steakhouse. I came here for lunch during restaurant week. It has a nice salad bar. Wide variety of dishes. But flavor wise it was sub-par. The servers each carry around a different cut/preparation of meat. If you flip the card on your table to the green side, they will come to ask if you want or not. The best one was their house special. It might be a belly cut. The other cuts were either over cooked, undercooked or under seasoned. For the price we paid, it is not too bad though.

4.0,8/14/2016,"OK, I admit: I only come during RW. Every RW for the past two years, I've come at least once or twice. Maybe around 6 visits in total? But the RW selection is so similar to the full menu that it's hard to justify paying full tilt (especially in NY where Fogo de Chao is more expensive than other cities like Boston, where I've gladly paid full price).You know what you're getting, and it's almost always solid. The salty meats are impossible to not love, and are incredibly addicting. I could eat the top sirloin all night long and nothing else! And I think I've mastered the strategy by getting as little as possible at the salad bar, skipping the addicting cheese bread and the starches, and just sticking to meat! (They try to fill you up on carbs, but I resist the urge!!). Seriously, it's great and if you're a meat eater, you should go. Oh, and the flank steak on this past visit was, like, 50000x better than I remember it being! It was my favorite meat!!Only reason not for 5 stars was because of the beyond foul hostess staff I encountered a couple visits ago. They were so rude and unprofessional on a variety of levels (including behavior that would be unequivocally dismissal-worthy if any manager saw it in real-time) that I needed to address it with the GM. He was admittedly very apologetic and tried to make things right that night by offering the full selection of meats even though we were on RW pricing.Love this place though.

3.0,8/8/2016,"Restaurant week 2016This was an interesting experience, to say the least. Our last min opentable reservation left us to dine at 11pm on a busy RW Friday night which I was fine with because I don't mind eating late anyway. Luckily, we called the day of to see if we can push it up a bit and had the reservation changed to 9pm that evening. We learned the hostess was surprised the 11pm opentable reservation even went through... because the restaurant closes at 11p. So imagine if we didn't call....whatever the issue is, they need to fix that glitch with opentable ASAP.When we arrived, our table was super dark! The 1 tiny light closest to use shone in between two tables and since we were by the wall I seriously could barely see what I was eating. Is this meat? Or fat? Oops, I won't know till I chew on it, and then decide if I'm going to have to spit it out. Great. Yea, forget taking pictures if you're at this crappy table. I asked for a candle for the table...to which the reply was ""we don't have any""... Um...YES YOU DO UPSTAIRS by the bar! I can see it from where I'm sitting *eyeroll*Aside from all that, it's an interesting system. First course you're going up to the salad bar for everything non-meat related. The servers will only bring you mashed potatoes, PDQ, and a few other starters. PDQ was fantastic! Salad bar was okay- not too bad. Once you return from the salad bar, servers will come by your table with various cuts of steak, lamb, sausages, chicken w/ bacon (skip this), etc. they'll carve it off in front of you and you use your tongs/forks to serve it onto your plate. A card is also left on your table that helps you communicate to the staff if you want them to come over with more meat. So green means ""keep it comin"" and if you flip to the red side It means ""pause, I'm still working on my heaps of food and/or digesting"". Service: the guys serving the meat were literally the most awesome......Everyone else was so blah- from the lighting issue to waving them down for forks/knives, down to ordering the drinks. Dessert was kinda boring: chocolate mousse or ny cheesecake. Other than that, the restaurant itself is stunning. There are SO many tables too- I don't think it's that difficult to get a rezzie. We saw available tables in the huge dining room throughout our dinner. All in all food was decent. But I didn't love the food enough to overlook everything else.

Definitely did not get my money's worth ..I feel like most of the food there was SALTY!! especially the meat...a lot of the meat was too salty for me..so I really couldn't eat much and drank loads of water... this is surprising considering I always eat A LOT at buffets...although the salad bar is buffet style...I only ended up going up there once to get food.Halfway through my meal I asked for a sweetened ice tea but the staff said they don't have sweetened, so I asked for unsweetened ice tea ....never got my drink.

You are seated and directed to where the marketplace salad bar is, and given little coasters with a red and green side to use when you're ready for the meat. Green means ready, red means taking a break, or done. I tried a few items at the salad bar-the lox and potato salad were good. But let's be real - I came here for the meat! I tried a little bit of everything, but my favorite was a garlic infused beef. You're given side dishes of bread (looks like some kind of popover?), polenta fries, fried sweet plantains, and mash potatoes - all very good. My only complaint about the food is that some of the cuts of meat were very fatty. For dessert I had the chocolate mousse cake, and my friend had the cheesecake.

1.0,7/29/2016,"Save your hard earned money and go to a real restaurant. For a restaurant whose sole focus is high quality meat, the meat quality was embarrassingly bad. The Picanha was the only cut that was edible and I use the term fairly loosely. The whole meal was so disappointing I just gave up and am sadly going to be leaving hungry. That says a lot for a place that's all you can eat. I believe I deserve a refund. On top of that the waitress just informed me that there are no refills for my Diet Coke. Who do they think they are at Fogo? I am embarrassed I even came here. I will probably never admit to eating here amongst people who know even the slightest about good food.

4.0,7/26/2016,"Brazilian Steakhouses are one of my favorite meals. If you have not been, it is quite the experience. You start with the salad bar. However, it is a trap. You want to eat just a little bit to save room for the meat. You have a card that you flip to green (you want more meat) or red (you need a break or are done). The gauchos will come with a skewer of meat (steaks, chicken, ribs, pork, sausages, etc.) and offer you some if your card is green. They will probably ask offer anyway even if your card is red. By far, Fogo de Chao is my favorite Brazilian Steakhouse. Except for the Beverley Hills location, I have never had anything but an amazing experience. They have the best salad bar. I love the prosciutto and smoked salmon. In addition, they cook their meats the best compared to other Brazilian steakhouses I have tried. Their meats are very tender and have the best flavor. The complimentary sides of mashed potatoes, caramelized bananas, and polenta. They are all good. In particular, the bananas are awesome. Since dinner is usually $60, the reduced Restaurant Week price provides a great opportunity to try Fogo de Chao. Although they will exclude their most premium cuts for the event, you get dessert which is normally not included. In the rare times I have made it to dessert, the selections were very good too. Furthermore, Fogo de Chao features my favorite soda, guarana. It is basically a cherry ginger ale.If you are looking for places to try for Restaurant Week,  feel free to message me through Yelp and I can share my person list, which includes my Yelp reviews.

I never got a response if they had the wine or not and I never got my iced tea. All their meats seemed to be over cooked and not seasoned as normal. Also, we were never given fresh bread when we asked. Lastly, we asked for the bill and had to ask several waiters until someone brought it. We gave the waiter our credit card as he gave us the bill and he left and proceeded to clean a table, we finally got our receipt 10 minutes later.

We arrived on time and got seated within a few minutes. The wait staff is super nice and friendly. We were taken downstairs to a large dining area which looked really nice. We got all types of salads at the salad bar. The Parmesan kale salad was good; also the basil watermelon salad and the tomatoes and mozzarella. I tried a bit of the split pea soup which was decent. When we sat we turned our coasters over and the meat started coming, lol. I thought the best was the sirloin, garlic steak and the bacon wrapped chicken (minus the bacon). The cuts were nice and tender. Very good. I also tried the lamb chops which were ok too. The best part of my meal though were the pan de queijo balls. They taste so yummy warm. You know the food at a restaurant is good when no one is talking, lol. We enjoyed tasting the complimentary pineapple cachaça; and the birthday girl ordered the mango fresco which she said was very good. We also ordered her a molten cake for dessert and that was pretty tasty as well. The only thing was we didn't realize how expensive it would be and I usually have a groupon or some sort of coupon for places like that, so hence the 4 stars. Otherwise it would have been 5 stars for me but the price was a bit much. I guess I have to come more hungry for it to be worth the price because we only had 1 plate of food.

The hostess didn't acknowledge us when we walked in, before walking away to look into another matter. I have no idea what we did to our waiter, but he was just barely feigning being polite. In fact for some reason, we had 2 different waiters at one point, each asking if we needed another glass of wine. When we asked for the check, there had been a large table of about 10 seated right behind, and I guess he was more interested in the tips from that group. He literally came up behind my girlfriend's back, place the check on the table over her shoulder and rushed away without saying thank you, or anything for that matter. We looked at each other in confusion at the curt behavior. I can only presume that this is a common problem because the manager came over 2 different times and not only asked how everything was, but specifically mentioned, ""...is the service ok?"" Until that last thing with the check, it wasn't great, but nothing worth mentioning, so we didn't say anything. It's an odd question to ask guests, btw. It puts us in an awkward position to have to point out what's wrong, in front of your staff, mid-meal. Service aside, we were a bit disappointed by the salad bar - which was just that, a plain old salad bar, reminiscent of Sizzler. The feijoada (which we applaud you for making daily) had a good smoky flavor to it, but ironically, no meat. The pão de queijo was warm but hard, so it almost felt like a buttered roll? The churrasco was well salted with good flavor, but half the time I asked for medium rare, I was sliced off a piece that was medium well (that's a pretty big difference). So clearly, this was a miss, guys.Como brasileira, eu achei que levar meu namorado em uma churrascaria brasileira seria um otimo presente de aniversario.

Got there around 8 and we were seated only about 15 minutes later (we got drinks at the bar while waiting and timing worked out perfectly). Sweet!As other reviews have forewarned, do not be afraid to turn down the chicken, pork, sausage, and other ""distractions."" (Unless that's what you prefer over beef). I had a bite of the Parmesan crusted pork and it was soooo dry. The best cuts in my opinion were the house special (some type of sirloin, definitely the most tender), top sirloin, and bacon wrapped filet. As far as the salad bar, yes, it's no 5 star buffet but it has a fair amount of accompaniments to cleanse your palette as you're scarfing down mouthfuls of meat.

Some were uneventful stick to these!... my favorites were the:-lamb chops-filet-picanhaHit up the salad bar when you need a break, and grab yourself some smoked salmon, cheese and charcuterie... don't go overboard though; you're there for the meat!They'll bring you out fried polenta, cheese bread and caramelized bananas... all pair perfectly with the meats and they're all done very well, but be wary not to overdo it for the same reason.

A friend who was in the know asked for the short ribs and that was delicious. The sides on the table were all delicious. You will definitely be full with a reasonable variety of meats. Desserts were delicious (I had the tres leches, but others had the cheesecake, chocolate lava, and all enjoyed them). The ""so-so"": service was quite variable. Some were great but some were not so. I found myself being skipped randomly for offerings of meat.  When we asked for the short ribs they came out with it but left after serving only 2 of the twelve on the table (we had to call them back).  One of the servers was rather brusque when we were calling their attention to this.  On the other hand other servers were lovely.  The salad bar was ok, kind of random. Reasonable quality but no where near the steak/meats. Don't waste space in your stomach with the sausage or bacon wrapped steak which was over cooked and dry.  I have to say for the price I would have expected more.",0,0,0,N Y.,"Briarcliff Manor, NY",0,16,4

Salad bar and pao de queijo are always outstanding. Meat selections are pretty good but I usually have to wait to get a nice medium well selections. I've never had the pork or chicken here only the beef. The garlic steak is pretty much life. Make sure you graze at the salad bar until your meat comes otherwise you will fill up quickly and this will likely be the most expensive salad bar meal of your life. Do not come if you are vegetarian or don't eat beef. It will be a waste of money. Get a caipirinha over a mojito. The special drinks, especially the one in the pineapple, is delicious! Apparently they have dessert, I had no idea as I've never made it this far. Make sure you come during Restaurant Week as it is quite a bargain over regular pricing.

5.0,3/16/2016,"This is a review that is long overdue. I had a company team building day and wanted to treat the executive team to a fine lunch, therefore Fogo de Chao was the choice in sunny south beach.

Needless to say, the atmosphere is very high-end and my executive team was extremely excited at first glance of the restaurant. The entire experience was phenomenal and well priced for the caliber of food offered. Again, kudos to the entire Fogo de Chao team.The reason for finally reviewing the amazing experience at Fogo is because I returned to dine this evening with my wife and again the experience was five star. The staff is so attentive and it starts from the top as Imar, the manager on duty, has customers at the forefront of all his staff. Then the decadent food selection is more than one can ever desire.

4.0,3/15/2016,"This is a pretty different experience in terms of meat eating. Something like FDC should be experienced by everyone. That said, I don't think this will ever replace my favorite steakhouses. The dinner scene, probably because of it's location, seemed pretty touristy but local crowd or not, the food was definitely a postiive experience.  So yea you could go to Fogo De Chao and have a more traditional entree but there's very little point to not enjoy the churrascaria experience. A word of caution by the way, the onslaught of meat you will receive if that card is not flipped over is nothing to joke about. Any kind of meat accomplishments you may think you can achieve will soon be put to bed by the speed at which the food will hit your plate.  Now you may think the best route to go is strictly for the prime cuts but their chicken and sausages are nothing to ignore either. Don't think you have hold out for the prime rib or ribeyee or sirloin.  Granted, all well cooked cuts of meat but expanding your pallet beyond a mid-rare cut will provide a better more well rounded dinner.Basically Fogo De Chao is somewhere I'm glad I went too but a place like this,  you need to be in the mood for.

2.0,3/13/2016,I'm not sure whether to give it 1 star for blatantly being discriminated against or 5 stars for the experience. So I'll start the review and see what outweighs what. I work a white collar job and dress up fancy. This is a fancy place. My colleagues wanted to do dinner here and I said why not-  but I didn't dress up. So I appear in my Yankee fitted and sneakers because I'm off that day and walk in there with my gf and homie. Yes homie. We got there before my colleagues.  We were going to be a party of 7 and the hostess said that the wait for us would be 2 hours. Unbeknownst to the hostess - my colleagues were all white and white professional looking that night. Two of them were Brazilians. Once everyone got there- the wait went from 2 hours to 30 minutes. Now- I'm not sure if it was my appearance that they took a long hard look at and said 2.5 hours but I believe it was. My homie believed it was. It could be they wanted the whole party there I dunno but it felt funny. The food was great. Salad bar was a notch above what you expect at pizza hut restaurants. The steaks were excellent and the bread was amazing.  The decor and feel was also quite nice. The pricing- which we got restaurant week pricing for was adequate. All-in-all the culinary part of the experience was great. The service was great. The lady running around with that fresh piña colada was awesome. Waitress was cool and pretty cute. 5/5 for service3.5/5 for food 4/5 for atmosphereWas I a victim of profiling? I think I was. I felt like I was because I didn't look the part of fine dining diner. They allowed other parties to get in ahead of mine that looked the part. Guess a Yankee fitted is too gangster for this place.

The salad bar was one step above Golden Corral and the meat was salty and flavorless (and I believe they serve those 3 free sides as palate cleansers since the meat is so salty and the sides are so bland). I think the people reviewing this place are tourists who are excited to be in New York and don't want their excitement dampened by admitting they visited a subpar joint and paid too much for it.Also take note, solo diners: this place will make you feel really awkward.

This evening was suppose to be an amazing evening for us but this place just ruined everything.Left such a bad taste in our mouth that it haunted us even up until the next day. Can't believe we spent $170 dollars for lettuce and dressing!? We initially thought ""oo wow brazilian place, we are probably gonna get a burst of flavors in our mouth after eating their food!"" but it was soooooooo the opposite!! We usually spent 30-45 mins in a restaurant eating food, after the food is served. We literally were in this place may be 15 mins. We ate and everything else was over. This place is AMAZING for those people who haven't been to any 5 star restaurants. You are basically paying $70 per person for salad bar. The meat that the waiters were bringing around you, was burnt, undercooked, tasteless, cold, red/pink and bloody. There is no such thing as EXPERIENCE in this place. its just a dining room with salad bar and waiters walking around with shish kebobs. The warm stuff in the salad bar like the soup was COLD. everything else the ""steamed"" asparagus the ""string beans"" were COLD! The 3 ""free"" sides (which is really not free) was COLD!! Time would've been better spent in APPLE BEES than here. Hell...we got a better dining experience at the dollar menu at McDonalds. Even Old Country Buffet is WAY BETTER!! This place is just an over priced salad bar!! spent about $170 for lettuce and Italian dressing!!? NOT COUNTING DRINKS!! OH FOR THOSE ITS EXTRA! IM SURPRISED THEY DIDN'T CHARGE YOU FOR THE WATER! We spent close to $300 in TAO and even THAT WAS WELLLLLLL worth it ! NOW TAO! IS AN EXPERIENCE ! AMBIANCE, FOOD, DRINKS AND SERVICE!! Well worth the money we spent! WE have no problems spending thousands of dollars in food with experience but this place I wouldn't even spend $10 dollars in!Will never recommend this place to any of our friends.

We were encouraged to start with the market bar, but not to fill up at all, because they will keep the meat coming. The bar was fit with olives, delicious mozzarella, cesar sald, bread, peppers, potato salad, salami, proscuitto, and so much more! The one item that sounded better than it was was the candied bacon, don't worry about that as there's plenty pork to go around. There is also rice and beans at the market table as well. We started with salad, peppers, salami, etc, as they would compliment the meats chosen.We tried every single one. Or at least I did, my woman got filled up and I had to encourage her to fight the good fight. Every piece, succulent, juicy, so much flavor especially in the parmesan pork and garlic steak. I could give you a long description of how amazing each individual cut was, but I'll get right into the ones that were so good I had to have more than one: parmesan pork, house sirloin, and the strip was the very best medium rare.I want to add this note, I have NEVER eaten medium rare before, and trying it opened up a whole new world for me. If you are used to well done, medium, etc, I strongly encourage you to try a slice of medium rare, you won't regret it, I promise.The only pieces I had any issue with is the lamb was a little tough, and I was given well.done filet that wasn't right. Honestly it was barely a bother considering they typically ask which temp you'd like first.This was a real experience for us both and while we do look forward to returning, we are excited to try the one in Puerto Rico on our next trip.Thank you for this experience, wow.",5,2,3,Devon O.,"Brooklyn, NY",117,216,516

The salads are over salty and side from the cheese and some cold cuts, there isn't much that's worth filling up on.- make sure to sample all the meats/cuts in small portions, so when you find the one you like best, you can keep asking for it. - take your time.

3.0,2/8/2016,"My boyfriend is from Brasil and I wanted to surprise him for his birthday by bringing him to a Brasilian steakhouse. He had been homesick recently since he couldn't go back home for the holidays and I thought this would cheer him up. I made the mistake of scheduling our meal for dinner time. I had no idea that traditional Rodizio was a lunch affair. Despite my mistake, my boyfriend was a perfect gentleman. He claimed that the food was overpriced for what it was, and the ambiance was a bit gaudy, but overall we had a generally fine experience. We wouldn't go back, but it wasn't terrible. The main reason I wouldn't go back is because I had a sense that some of the staff were uncomfortable with some of our PDA, and that spoiled our evening a little. When they brought out the birthday cake, I kissed his fuzzy brown head and told him I loved him. I could feel the judgment from the eyes of the staff when this happened. This saddened me as I know how loving and accepting Brasilian people are after meeting João's parents when they visited him in the big city. We are hoping that the Rodizio restaurants in New Jersey are more open minded.",0,1,0,Jon K.,"Manhattan, NY",1,21,4

They have a great of variety of meats especially beef they also have chicken ribs and lamb. I gave the chicken a try but stuck with the beef. My favorite was the Picanha medium rare, I had three servings of that. It was coated with sea salt and was melt in your mouth goodness. The other cuts of steak were good but not as good due to their toughness. We came for restaurant week, and didn't order drinks so the total plus tip and tax was $48 pp which includes dessert.

I, myself, was not a fan of the chicken here, but the beef was pretty good - could've been better, but I suspect they save their better cuts for those not dining at restaurant week prices.

Some like the pork and chicken were a little dry while others did not seem to be properly seasoned.That being said, the Restaurant Week menu is a great deal and do not regret going.

5.0,1/27/2016,"Came here for restaurant week with a group of 4. Make sure you make reservations because the wait can be up to 2 hours for walk ins. The interior had an upscale feel to it. There were 3 floors. Top was the bar, second was bar and waiting area and the bottom was the dining area. Once we were seated, our waiter explained how the system works and told us we can get started at the salad bar right away. There were many options at the salad bar. Ranges from fruits, veggies, soup, cheeses, salads and various types of meats. I didn't want to get full off the salad bar and only had bits and pieces of some stuff. The apple fruit salad was delicious and refreshing. The brussel salad can be skipped. It was lacking in flavor and tasted like it had been out for too long. Along with our meal came the caramelized bananas, cheese bread, polenta and garlic mashed potatoes. The cheese bread was definitely a favorite of the table and tasted even better when it was hot. The waiters also kept refilling it throughout our meal!Now onto the good stuff: the meat. I think it's all based on luck with the cut of meat you get. I was not a fan of the parmesan coated pork loin. It was very salty and dry. But then my friends had a very juicy piece so it's really all luck based on which piece you get. The bacon wrapped chicken was very moist. Ribs were really good but a little on the salty side. The beef was amazing. This place is definitely a meat lovers galore. The house signature had to be my favorite! Next would be the prime part of the top sirloin. For restaurant week, you only get 3 choices for dessert. You can pick from the cheesecake, chocolate mousse cake and key lime pie. They were average. Nothing over the top. Could be because we were so stuffed from our meal. Overall I had a great experience and would probably come back if they participate in restaurant week during the Summer. The waiters were so polite and they do not rush you at all. You can take your time eating and when you're ready to go, you just have to let them know. They were very professional and friendly for a place that gets very busy. Also make sure you let your waiter know in advance you're there for the restaurant week menu! You wouldn't want to be charged the full price!",2,2,1,Cristina C.,"Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, NY",225,136,461
5.0,1/27/2016,"Absolutely LOVE this steakhouse! The 3rd year coming here for restaurant week... Walk in excited and walk out satisfied. Food: wide variety of fresh cut meats from pichana and Alcatra sirloin, pork loin filet, lamb, pork ribs, to chicken wrapped in bacon. All the meats were carried out fresh from the kitchen to the tables. If you have your card flipped to the green side then you will be approached with meats and it was then your choice to decide if you wanted that meat as well as how you would like it (well done, medium rare, etc). They were cooked to perfection. Melt in your mouth perfection. Even the ""well done"" cuts didn't look overly dry. My favorites were the pork ribs and pichana sirloin. Meats were all -you -can -eat, along with the open salad bar (good variety as well). They also provided side dishes to the table such as fried yuca, caramelized bananas, mashed potatoes, and cheesy bread. Almost everyone at my table loves the fried Yuca. I personally liked the caramelized bananas when I paired it with meats (Mouth watering just reminiscing about it...)Service: pretty good service. Greeted kindly by the hostess and our waiter Aaron (hopefully spelled his name right. Aaron was very patient and attentive from the start. We were pretty indecisive when it came to deciding on drinks. He made sure to provide us drink menus and different recommendations both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. Much appreciated. During our dining, he made sure to ask how we were doing and, at one point, help us grab the attention of the servers because the meats were not offered to us for a while. I admit, I did get a little frustrated and hangggry but Aaron took care of us :) at the end when we were preparing to  leave he even took the time to come over and thank us for dining, as well as apologize for the wait time we experienced for the meats. Aaron gets 5 stars just on his own! Thank you!Recommend? I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant. A great deal for restaurant week but a great deal nonetheless outside of RW.

4.0,1/27/2016,"Came here for restaurant week with the girlfriend. First time here so had high hopes. They have a nice salad bar with a huge selection which is great and a few other appetizers on the table at all times (mashed potatoes, sweet bananas, and polenta). But the main attraction is the meat. For the restaurant week menu, they had chicken, lamb, ribs, pork, sirloin, and a few others. Flip the card to green and the food just keeps coming. Props to them for the fast customer service. The table was always filled with food at all times. Flip the card to red and you can just enjoy the meal. They also had this pineapple drink special for restaurant week which was like their version of a Pina colada but on the rocks and it was really strong (in my opinion). The only reason for one less star is because all the meats were extremely salty. So much so that for the leg of lamb, I was able to taste the grains of salt...",0,0,0,Vince K.,"Brooklyn, NY",79,7,0
3.0,1/26/2016,"I stopped by recently since I heard that Fogo was participating in Restaurant Week. I absolutely cannot resist a good steak. With Fogo offering unlimited steak (and other meats) for only $38?! You wouldn't believe how quickly I booked it out of class to make it to dinner. I got there and received a warm welcome from the hostess who directed me downstairs to my party. We were seated directly beneath the stairs, at a big corner table (there were 8 of us), and we got started right away. The card system was explained and pretty easy to understand. Flip it red, and you're okay for now - no meat needed. Green, and any server that notices will stop by your table to offer you whatever they have. In theory, a great system, but in reality, a little more difficult to execute. It's hard for the servers to always see if your card is green if the rest of the table is red, or even see your cards at all if you're not in the center of the restaurant. Still, I was pretty happy with the service. Everyone smiled, was kind, and treated us no differently knowing we were stopping by for the Restaurant Week deal. On to the food. The steaks were great, although I kept getting a variation between well done and medium rare, even though I asked for medium every single time. Of course, that affected how the steaks tasted to me. The caramelized bananas were the standout appetizer, and I personally liked the chocolate mousse more than the cheesecake (didn't get to try the key lime pie), but neither dessert was really mind-blowing. I think overall, it's a great deal. Come with people that have a bottomless stomach like I did, and you're sure to get your money's worth. Service is decent, and the experience was fun. Good for a one time visit at the very least. They lost one star for the wait time between servings when the servers just passed over our table because they weren't looking closely enough, and the other star for the variation in the quality of their food.",2,1,0,Jen L.,"Brooklyn, NY",185,32,25
4.0,1/24/2016,"Brazilian steakhouse aka Churrascaria = MEAT GALORE! Unlimited assorted meats, sides, and salads!! Churrascaria roughly translates in Portuguese for ""barbecue"". Servers will come around your table with a long spear stick of some sort of meat, each server carrying a different type of meat cut that they will cut in front of you and serve it to your plate. Beforehand, you get to head to the salad bar, which has a nice gourmet quality selection of things to pile on your plate... Some things I was actually impressed from the salad bar was the smoked salmon, the sweet&spicy bacon, fresh mozzarella, and I highly suggest to get a load of their refreshing apple salad to take mini bites in between your meats to help cut through all that constant endless meat flavor and saltiness you'll be having and I can't forget about the pesto sauce from the bar that you could use to dip some of your meat in as well! Let's jump to the meat: all the red meat has a choice from rare, med-rare, med, or medium-well. Med-rare is the way to go for me and has been spot on from here. Majority of the meats has been surprisingly very juicy and seasoned well... and even overly seasoned for a few. My favorites were the house special prime sirloin, top sirloin, and bottom sirloin. The chicken legs had a great flavor in wine. The pork ribs would've been one of my faves since it was falling off the bone but it was the only one that was too heavily salted. Lamb legs were also great. My least favorite were the Parmesan crusted pork tenderloin, it was dry and the Parmesan cheese just didn't do it for me, also the bacon wrapped filet mignon. Your table will also be accompanied with constant refills on filling starchy table sides of mash potatoes, fried polenta fries, caramelized bananas and and warm freshly buttered bread... Which all except the polenta fries I enjoyed as well!Dessert choices were : key lime pie, ny cheesecake, or chocolate mousse cake which were all mediocre.It may get overwhelming so prepare yourselves and don't feel the need to rush! You get a card on the table, red side up means you don't want them to bother you and bring anymore meat for the meantime, flip green side up whenever you're ready to eat more! The same meat will constantly keep coming out hot and fresh all night, so again use the card wisely to pace yourself if you don't want them to bombard you all at once. Other than that, no complaints on the service; they're friendly, fast and efficient. The dining room is quite elegant looking, high ceilings, 3 floors, with a much more peaceful ambiance.I always wanted to try Fogo De Chao and was very happy about them participated for RW which is a very generous thing of them... They're the most worth it for your money on restaurant week! I left extremely bloated, and satisfied with the meal for just $38. However on daily normal nights, it's always $60 which is quite hefty.",4,1,5,Monica P.,"Brooklyn, NY",432,222,440

4.0,1/22/2016,Restaurant Week 2016 January the market table had many choices to chose from. Some of the items on market table were a bit salty which made me thirsty. They came around with the various cuts of meat frequently enough to be non stop eating. The desert was mediocre. This is my third resturant week here and they always have the same desserts. They should try switching up the deserts each year.,3,1,1,Cynthia T.,"Brooklyn, NY",105,32,118
3.0,1/20/2016,"It was my first time at a Brazilian churrascaria. It's nestled right across the street from the MoMA. There are three levels to the restaurant. Downstairs consists of a traditional elegant dining room, whereas the third level features a fully equipped bar. Start yourself off with a Passionate Caipirinha, one of Brazil's national cocktails. Drinking this reminded me of a subtle mixture of both a mojito and a daiquiri. Quite tasty and refreshing!The full churrasco experience at Fogo de Chao will cost you $39.95 for lunch and $62.95 for dinner. You'll begin at the gourmet self-serve salad bar. There are a variety of options which consists of your basic fare but nothing amazing enough that enticed me to return. Besides, my mission here is to eat meat and it would be a no-brainer to fill up on anything other than meat. Each diner will find a two-sided coaster on the table that's pretty self-explanatory. When you want the meats to flow, green is the way to go. FOOD -- Undoubtedly, a meat lovers dream. We were bombarded with about 13 different kinds of meat which included: house specialty prime sirloin, top sirloin, bottom sirloin, filet mignon, bacon wrapped filet mignon, rib-eye, pork sausage, parmesan encrusted pork loin, lamb chops, leg of lamb, chicken sausage, chicken leg, and bacon wrapped chicken breast. If that's not enough, there are also starchy sides that were consistently replenished. This comprised of fried plantains, garlic mashed potatoes, crispy polenta fries, and warm cheese rolls. HIGHLIGHTS -- The house specialty prime sirloin, top sirloin, and leg of lamb were the standouts of the night. The house specialty had a good robust flavor. The top sirloin had a nice crisp while maintaining the juiciness of the meat. As for the leg of lamb, it was grilled to perfection with no hint of gaminess whatsoever. CONS -- I'm all for seasoning and flavors but some cuts were just overly salty. The seasoning wasn't subtle enough to complement the natural flavors of each cut. For the majority, I felt the meat quality was just average. Our first rounds of meats were excellent, however everything onwards seemed dried-out which probably resulted from reheating. Another imperfection is the inconsistencies of the cuts. I requested all of my cuts to be medium-rare, however I received most pieces medium well. Why ask if you can't deliver? My last complaint would be the overwhelming flow of meats. We literally received all 13 meats in a matter of minutes, all stacked right besides each other. Perhaps I'm picky, but I prefer to eat my food warm especially when it comes to meat. Final verdict? If you haven't dined here already, brace yourselves for a full comatose meal. It's certainly a different dining experience and the concept is fantastic. I enjoyed watching the meat-cutters coming out with various skewers of meats that were ready to be carved at the table. However, inconsistency took away from the experience. For this price tag, I'd rather splurge on a better cut of steak cooked to my preference than to stuff myself with a variety of mediocre meats. For those that are hesitant in dining here due to the price tag, restaurant week offers the full churrasco experience for only half the price ($38) with the difference being only in the selection of certain meats so take full advantage!",24,12,14,Annie C.,"Brooklyn, NY",368,131,551

The salad bar was not as big as I had expected - expect cheese and prosciutto plates, hearts of palm, broccolis, asparagus, regular greens, red peppers, etc. The waiters came around and offered us caipirinhas - the Brazilian national cocktail that closely resembles a mojito but switch out rum and bubbles for cachaca - so sweet and oh so dangerous! The private space we booked got very rowdy within the hour thanks to these babies! Each person gets a circle tag on the table with red and green sides. Red for when you don't want to be carved more meat and green for ""yes please bring more."" Being the noob that I was, I left the green side up expecting the waiters to give me time to cut and taste my steak, but nope, they came one after the other without giving me the chance to finish a conversation with the person sitting across from me. I felt like my meal was constantly being interrupted, yet if I flipped my tag over to red, I'd still feel hungry. The servers definitely could have talked slower or skipped me if they saw that I was in the middle of cutting another piece of meat, but oh well, I guess they just didn't want me to miss all the types of cuts they had to offer.The steak sirloin was great but the chicken was very dry.

1.0,12/18/2015,All the reviews have been glowing. We were there last night with a group of 11 people.  Place was CHAOS.  When we made reservation we specifically said we don't want to be near the kitchen.  They crammed us in a corner right near the kitchen.  When we complained they said it was the gaucho runway.  Whatever that is.  They finally moved us.  This place is not conducive for large groups couldn't hear the waiter from the other side.  They tried to push bottles of water wine and drinks. We asked for a cocktail menu and it was only bought to us after almost everybody ordered drinks.  It's clear that they make their money in this area.  Drinks were just okay.  Meats of course were tasty and plentiful.  Our group thought that desert was included in the price so ordered it even though we really didn't need it after consuming all that meat.  The issue here was there wasn't communication from the staff.  Many people in our group were going for the first time.  The $59.95 price became $120.00 which is certainly not worth it.  Do your research on the menu and drinks before going. Place was okay but certainly not worth all those 4&5 stars.,1,0,1,Mike D.,"West New York, NJ",1,24,0
4.0,12/17/2015,"I came here before for a yelp event over a year ago and never forgot about my experience. I was tasked with finding a place for a holiday team dinner and Fogo came to mind right away. This place costs about $60 per person is an AYCE haven for meat lovers. With the AYCE option comes the salad bar which features an assortment of cheeses, cured meats, smoked salmon, veggies, soups, salad and etc. There are over 15+ types of meats that waiters come around with and slice right in front of you. You are given these little place cards on the table (flip green to have the meat come to you, flip red to take a break or stop the flow of meat). My team has never tried Fogo before and they ended up loving the place and saying it was a lot of fun. I would like to thank the floor manager on the night that we went for being so attentive and checking in on us every now and then. The service, and food, met my expectations and I would gladly return here for any special events in the future.",1,0,0,Victoria X.,"New York, NY",580,617,577
4.0,12/16/2015,"This is a review for the restaurant week. I came here twice during restaurant week. Once with my friends and another time with my family. Both times were for dinner. It was 38 plus tax and tip. I really enjoyed the meats and the salad bars. They were very attentive with what cuts of meat they have and how they tasted. With the beef, you get to tell them if you would like a medium rare piece ( which I prefer) or a medium well/ well done piece(which most of my family preferred). The salad bar had a great selection. They also have rice behind the salad bar if you want to have that with your meal. The restaurant week menu also comes with dessert. They were not that great but it's nice that it came with it. If I come back I will only come for restaurant week since their regular all you can eat menu price is $65.",2,0,1,Eric W.,"New York, NY",208,87,34
4.0,12/15/2015,"One of the nicest fogos I've been to, I've been to the ones in DC and Philly. The decor inside here is really nice especially with the high ceilings. Located super close to the Rockefeller Center- this was the subway train station I got off at. We came here for a work holiday party, there was about 30 people. The service is quite attentive and fast. All you can eat meat (keep the green button up for more meat and red to stop). They come by when they see the green button. I recommend staying away from the chicken and sausage. Get the beef (sirloin) and leg of lamb!!!The salad bar has tons of other good stuff- kale salad, prosciutto, cheese, fruits, heart of palms, smoked salmon. There's more but those are some of my favorites.  I usually go for a plate of the salad bar and then come back to the table to start loading on meat. I think the key is to not stop eating or else you will start to feel super full. They give you sides (polenta, mashed potatoes (my favorite one), and fried bananas). They will keep refilling this once you're done. If you don't see what you want just ask, they will come back really fast! Go for the salad bar, beef, and lamb. Let the chicken go!Great for work events or group events! ~$52 for dinner, it's cheaper for lunch ~$35",2,0,1,Jessie H.,"Manhattan, NY",304,1032,721
5.0,12/14/2015,"Courteous and extremely attentive service.  Been there a few times now, and have never had a bad service moment.Well seasoned meats, and more importantly, not overcooked to well-done like way too many of the other rodizio places I've dined in.The salad bar is very nice, but don't overdo it.  Simple side dishes are also included, and the fried polenta is killer good when they're doing it up right--crunchy on the outside, creamy on the inside.Very nice atmosphere with high ceilings that allow the noise from all the diners to go up instead of across to your table.  This is important, because this is not a romantic date night place to be, but it is a great place for small or larger groups.  You eat, you drink, you have fun.  It should be a lot louder than it actually is.Limited dessert selection, but after all that meat you really don't need it.Don't see a server with the type of meat you're looking for?  Ask your table captain or another server.  They'll make certain that those tender lamb chops come your way.The by-the-glass wine menu is heavy on the South American wines, but it makes sense.  There are also plenty of affordable bottles and a small half-bottle selection.Love the bar upstairs, but the street-level bar will do if you've a short wait for your table.This is my go to place if I'm arranging a night out for a group in the city.  As long as there are no vegetarians in your mob, then everyone will be sure to have a great time.",2,1,0,Rich W.,"Princeton, NJ",46,188,229

Service is always fast, and waiters are always very attentive. The pão de queijo appetizer was very well made and best version of the Brazilian bread I've had so far. Overall, the food was amazing although some cuts of the all-you-can-eat meat were too greasy depending on what you ordered and there were some misses like the Parmesan-encrusted pork (unappetizing as it sounds).

I figured that I love good food and that all of these other great reviews raving about this place had to be based on something, right? No, unfortunately.. wrong.The salad bar/appetizer buffet was just as understocked and underwhelming as ever - plates of hearts of palm, black olives, assortments of basic cheeses, fruit platters (why do I want fruit before I feast on meat, again?), really nasty potato salad, ambrosia- and the meats (again we got about 8 options total) are either unseasoned, over-salted or in the case of their 'garlic steak' entirely coated so you can't see or taste the meat beneath the garlic. Other rodizios I've been to have a much better salad bar/appetizer buffet (pasta salad, guacamole, sushi, cocktail shrimp, etc.) and their meats come out sizzling hot out of the spitfire and full of flavor and meat juice. Fogo's meat is dry half the time.. even when you get medium rare! I sit here writing this without having eaten since breakfast and remembering this meal does not make me hungry whatsoever; I'd be more enthused about paying top dollar for taco bell than this place.If you want rodizio in Midtown, Churrascaria Plataforma is your place.

4.0,11/8/2015,"The restaurant is located in a real upscale part of Manhattan; Rockerfeller Center. Soon as you walk in, the place is extremely elegant. Youre introduced to beautiful decor as you walk down the staircase. Immediately, what stood out was the extensive collection of wine. You dont have to be a wine connoisseur to be impressed.     To start off, my friend and I grabed a bunch of stuff from the buffet: white rice, black beans, fresh mozarella, potato salad, etc. Nothing from the buffet dissapointed, except for the onions in the potato salad. Our waitress brought us the complimentary cheese bread, caramelized bananas, and garlic mashed potatoes. All of that was delicious.     Then the meats come out. These guys just keep coming and coming at you. Just when youre about to try 1 meat, another dude pops out of nowhere asking you if you want some of what he has. All sorts of steak cuts, lamb, chicken, pork, ribs. Some of the meats were a little too salty, but I've got to say that nothing was disgusting when it came to flavor. The cut that really stood out was the garlic steak. Wow!!!! I couldnt get enough of it. 1 time I even sent my waitress and a manager to go look for the guy who was carrying that steak cut. Theres no way you can leave this place with an empty stomach.     Afterwards, comes the dessert. Rather than give you a menu or list, they actually bring out a presentation of all the desserts; each in a seperate plate. Everything looks delicious, its hard to choose just 1. My friend decided he wanted the flan. It was too sweet for him. I tried some of it; it was no different than the average flan. My dessert on the other hand....GOSTOSO!!!!! The second best tasting Tres Leche cake I've ever had. Wanted to order another one, but I would probably need a shot of insulin later on.     Overall, the food was great, the atmosphere was oppulent, and the service was fascinating.

Sixty dollar rodizo aka bring on the meats!First they give a little round card that is red on one side and green on the other. I was adamant on keeping my card flipped to green as I was afraid of missing out on something good. Within a few minutes, I had 6 different cuts of meat on my plate and had eaten 3 pieces of steak already. I had to flip the card to red. My date on the other hand kept the card flipped to green. And that's exactly the color his face turned 15 minutes into the meal! You can easily make yourself sick here by eating way too much way too fast. But it's hard to just say enough when the cuts are delicious. I battled myself with the flipping of the card from red back to green and back to red. At one point a server just missed my green card and stopped dead on his tracks when I flipped back to red while he raced to offer me some more food. This type of red light, green light game I really enjoyed.Also ordered these huge pineapple alcoholic drinks. It was a special concoction that included bits of pineapple inside a fresh pineapple. Well worth the $25 price tag.All of the cuts I tasted I really enjoyed. The bacon-wrapped tenderloin was probably my least favorite and the spare ribs were surprising really tasty.Tip: don't miss out on the caramelized bacon at the salad bar.

5.0,9/27/2015,"WOW. Now I definitely see what everyone raves about. My friend told me that she took her boyfriend for his birthday. So I did the same and took our daughter as well. She did warn me that its a bit on the pricier side (I'm on a college kid budget and I have a daughter too lol). But while trying to make the reservations I noticed that they had a special price on lunch (12-3) on Sunday's (40$) for full buffet. PLUS they emailed me a coupon for the fall that saved me almost 30$. That really helped. I cannot imagine how much without those things. Ok enuff about price lets get to grubbin!Although I read up on the place prior to going, the waiter was kind enough to explain how it works because we were first timers. It looks like a coaster for cups; one side red for no meat and one side green for meat. We went to the salad bar which was broad in variation and yummy. After snacking a bit, we went to business and flipped to green bc we were ready for the goodness. They weren't kidding about fast and attentive service. Within 5-10 minutes, we had to flip it back to red bc we got a bit overwhelmed. The waiters were considerate to ask how you like the meat, which was medium well. They complimented the meats with the sides of mashed potatoes, something called pourri? it looks like fried yucca with parmesan cheese and sweet plantains. The waitress always made sure we were satisfied, always filled our water and even sweetly made conversation with my daughter. After we were painfully full we still forced some room for desert. The staff brings over a plate of samplings of the cakes/pies/sorbet that is offered. The young lady gave me a recommendation of mousse which was AMAZING. They even sang and decorated my boyfriend's plate for his birthday.BOTTOM LINE: To skip my essay haha, This might be on the pricier side but its well worth it.

2.0,9/27/2015,"CHEAP WITH MEAT and with a HIGHER PRICE TAG ($10 more) THAN ANY OTHER Fogo de Chao LOCATION.Let me start by saying that I have been to many Fogo De Chao's locations - Chicago, Miami, Las Vegas - and that this is my first review ever. CONSISTENTLY, these other locations exceeded my expectations every time. That's why I was very excited to bring my NY girlfriend here to the NY location, but we were both SO DISAPPOINTED. The NY location not only charges about $10 (that is $59.99pp) more than any of the other locations I've been to, I also got the sense that they were trying to ""save"" on everything, especially the meats. I WILL NOT RETURN TO THIS LOCATION AGAIN.Read the MEATS section.APPETIZERS: I waited 15 minutes for the first refill of the cheesy bread, and I asked 3 times for it, until I finally got it. I mean come on? It's bread.SALADS: Overall the salad bar was good, but not as good like the other locations. The fresh mozzarella wasn't the same quality like the other places, and the rice wasn't refilled for at least an hour, and my girlfriend really wanted rice. We had to ask to get it refilled.MEATS: In every other location you are given a large plate for the meats (""a fresh clean plate"") once you are done with the salad bar. Our waitress gave us, and I quote, ""a side plate"" for the meat, which must have been 5-6"" in diameter, or half the size of any normal main course plate. I have never been given an appetizer plate when I ordered steak in any other steakhouse or in any other Fogo de Chao location. Before the meats came, we told the head waitress we wanted well-done cuts at our table, and after she said she will take care of it, all meats that came were rare. So we literally ended up telling many times to each and every meat server that came to our table that we only wanted well done for our table. Considering that eating raw meat is ""at your own risk"", I felt that it was inappropriate for the staff to almost ""ignore"" our wishes and in an indirect way force us to eat raw meat. Then I began to wonder about the lamb chops and the rib eye cuts - these are arguably some of the better meats served. They never came. Instead we were offered chicken legs, sausage, sirloin, more chicken legs, more sirloin. After 15 minutes I began asking for the lamb chops and rib eye. At first they told me they don't even have rib eye, and then I said your website says you do, so I felt they were angry about it. We waited a long time, I think maybe another 20 minutes, until the lamb chops came well done, which was fine since we understood well done takes time. The only problem was we got one and half lamb chops between the both of us! UNACCEPTABLE. Now I'm going to have to wait for another 20 minutes if I want another lamb chop? I mean was this a game or something? I had to continuously ask for what I wanted and I was annoyed. After another 20 minutes came my rib eye, 3 small rectangles (1""X2""), which was perfect, except the meat server wanted to give me one. I was waiting for like 40 minutes for it, so I asked if the others were also well done, and when the meat server said yes, I said then give me all the 3 pieces. I didn't want to wait another 40 minutes. Reluctantly he did. For $59.99pp, this behavior is UNACCEPTABLE. I wish I was exaggerating.CONCLUSION. NEVER will I go again to Fogo de Chao in NY, and after this experience I will rethink about visiting this chain in other locations. Perhaps the once great Fogo de Chao is slipping.",1,0,1,Sean T.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,2,0

The salad bar was Ok I would have added more simple salads to the selection. Everyone had a little red card at their place, which is typical in Brazilian Steakhouses. When we flipped our red cards to the other side which was green the waiters started to come to our table. They had many tasty skewers of meat, which we took slices from.

2.0,9/8/2015,"First round of meat, excellent. 5 stars all the way. When I turned my card green they filled the plate rapid fire. Maybe because we were there a bit early and the servers needed something to do, maybe they wanted us to fill up quickly, whatever the rationale- we got the meat.  Everyone asked how we liked it prepared, and as I am a rare meat fan I found everything perfect.However, round 2 was less than stellar. It seemed like the cheaper meats came around more frequently, and gone was the asking for temperature. The second round meats were all overcooked, to the point my jaw started to hurt from chewing overcooked meat. I felt bad seeing how much had to be cleared because it was simply inedible. We went for our anniversary after a Broadway show,  When we booked, it asked me if we were celebrating and I wrote ""anniversary.""  I saw a few plates that said ""Happy Anniversary"" written on them for dessert, so despite being stuffed with meat went ahead and ordered. No happy anniversary on the plate.Last thing, as soon as we sat down we got hit up for a pineapple rum drink.  It came with a huge block of ice, and not a lot of drink.  It was off-menu and 13$ a glass, which we only discovered at the end we we saw the bill.  Could have skipped that and dessert and saved myself ~30$.",1,0,0,Ian N.,"Metuchen, NJ",7,886,0

4.0,8/17/2015,"Amazing rodizio place for Brazilian and meat madness food. The cuts are just mouth watering with their traditional ""on the stick"" meats that they cut right in your table. The variety is just overwhelming. Be sure to eat what you like the most and leave space for other options because you'll get full so quickly. Especially with their all you can eat salad bar that has soooo many delicious things like the smoked salmon, manchego cheese, prosciutto, salads in any color and veggies that can be a nice side for the meats. But again, don't over eat because the salad bar can fool you and by the time the meat comes to your table you are already ready to go to sleep. Go for the classics: picanha (i n c r e d i b l e), alcatra and specially the flank steak that melts in your mouth. The bottom sirloin was good too. The other cuts were ok but nothing to die for and especially not to get full with them. The warm pao de queijo in your table makes the difference. You arrive and seat and that cheese bread takes you straight to Copacabana.The sides are ok, fried polenta, mashed potatoes and plantains. The last one was a really good dessert for my palate.It's not a 5 star restaurant because I think the salad bar could be way better or at least have other Brazilian dishes and more variety. The salads were on the flavorless side, lack of dressing. And also not all the meats are great. Stick with what you like and don't be afraid to try other things and leave in the plate whatever you feel that it doesn't make the difference. Also, ask the waiters for the meats you like. We were waiting specially for the picanha that never arrived till we told the waiter. The selection of desserts is not that wide but still a pretty decent cheesecake and chocolate mousse cake. The ambiance is super nice and classy. Good for the value! $38 all you can eat and prime meats.

4.0,8/15/2015,"I usually opt for salad bar only (no way I can eat $60 worth of meat). But for $38, I think I had a chance! This fogo de chao location opened soon after I moved to DC, I was excited to return in time for summer restaurant week! Compared to DC's, the salad bar selection was actually smaller. But I would say it was better prepared - the squashes were nicely charred, the watermelon feta actually dressed in balsamic vinegar, even the green steak sauce was less runny. Meat - Although most diners came for their top sirloins, after trying a bit of everything, I knew where my money/belly was going - chicken drumsticks and pork ribs. The chicken drumsticks were tender and juicy (fell right off the bone!), the pork ribs were perfectly fatty and beautifully seasoned! My dining companion made a comment that I must had eaten two arm length worth of chicken drumstick alone... Plus the pork ribs - meat sweat? the struggle was real. I knew I couldn't refuse the cheesy bread - much bigger than ones in DC, somehow I managed to eat 6 and still asked for refills. Then it dawned me that I still had dessert to come! Key lime pie - half of their normal portion - loved the graham cracker crust but found the pie as a whole overwhelmingly sweet. I would recommend sticking to their chocolate mousse cake instead. Service was attentive and meats were plenty.

4.0,8/14/2015,"My friends and I have come here the last two Restaurant Weeks in a row.  The food is really good, but overpriced if you're paying full price. The concept is really cool, the salad bar is killer, and the meats are awesome but you're mainly paying for the experience.  I never care for any of the chicken they serve, and rarely like the pork, but the steaks are always amazing.  I like my meat very rare, and my girlfriend likes hers well done (or ruined as i call it, ha!) so the wait staff was being really awesome and coming to our table first to give her the well done bits, then coming back later when the rare was exposed.   The cheese bread is awesome.  The mashed potatoes, and plantains they keep on the table are both equally amazing. We had cheesecake and key lime pie for desert.  I'm not a desert person but they were included with the deal.  The cheesecake was good but very small (again might have just been a small portion for the deal), and the pie was ok.  The drinks and wines are expensive but they have a happy hour at the bar upstairs.  The place is huge, and beautiful, and its perfect for special events or big groups.  Go on an empty stomach because you will eat waaaaay too much.  Go with fun people because you're going to need to take breaks in between stuffing your face.      Definitely a place to check out if you've got a birthday or want to splurge a bit.",0,0,0,Jessica S.,"New York, NY",0,3,0

However, you better act fast because the reservations get booked quickly, especially if you have a large party.The first time around, I came with 4 people and we didn't have a reservations because it was booked solid. They told us to come and wait, so we did and they told us 3 hours.... But don't get discouraged, we only waited 1 hour and could have been seated earlier if our whole party was here on time. So key note: EVERYONE MUST BE HERE ON TIME, or you will NOT get seated!You must come on an empty stomach and ready to eat your hard out. How it works:Step 1) You get your appetizers like you would at a buffet Step 2) The waiter should have given you coasters with a red and green side. (Incase you don't know, green = keep the meat coming!, red = so full and can't fit any more in my stomach)Step 3) flip that coaster to GREEN and the meat will start coming! You will have a wise range of meat selections.. Sirloin, chicken wrapped, pork...Step 4) EAT your heart out and have seconds, thirds and fourthsStep 5) once you are full, turn that coast to REDStep 6) Always make room for dessertStep 7) FOOD COMA!!!Quality of food:Excellent!

5.0,8/11/2015,"I had very high expectations for this restaurant and they certainly did not disappoint! Came here for restaurant week and had such an amazing dining experience. They have a very spacious and open waiting area located upstairs where you can sit until the rest of your party arrives; they don't seat you until everyone is present. Our waiter was very polite and fun. So right after you're seated they give each person at the table a coaster, one side is green and the other is red. The idea is that you flip to the green when you want the servers to come by to carve and serve you whatever meat they present to you. There are always multiple servers on the floor so make sure you're ready to eat! When you feel like taking a break you flip your coaster back to the red side so they know to skip over your table. What a cute idea! My favorite from everything I tried was the top sirloin. The chicken breast with bacon was a bit too dry for my tastes but everything else was great. They have a variety of lamb, pork, chicken and steak. Also there's an open salad bar you can go to as many times as you'd like. Along with the meats, they also come to give you plantains, mashed potato and another small dish that they constantly refill for you. How awesome is that? Service here is fantastic.

5.0,8/6/2015,"Throwing down another restaurant week review up in here.Short Story: You're an idiot if you don't take advantage of the restaurant week deal at Fogo de Chao. Idiot. (If you're unable to partake in the gloriousness of a meaty meal, I exclude you from judgement.)Long Story: $38 for all you can eat food is not bad. It's actually somewhat average in this town. When you throw in the fact that you get access to a lovely cold bar with fresh veggies, cheese, and cold cuts like salami, prosciutto, and smoked salmon* in addition to prime cuts of meat hot off the grill, it's bumped up a notch above the typical buffet.Now let's talk about the meat. Holy cow. And pig. And lamb. There's something fantastic about people walking around with giant cuts of meat and offering you said meat. With a late dinner reservation and lack of energy due to hunger, I perked up real fast as soon as I saw the food---top sirloin, bottom sirloin, rib eye, beef tenderloin, pork ribs, pork sausage, leg of lamb. You know I ate it all. My favorite was the alcatra (top sirloin). It was so juicy and flavorful. Everything was perfectly cooked, and I love how they carry meat cooked to varying levels of doneness on the big churrasco skewers so you have options on top of your options.You also get a side of garlic mashed potatoes, fried polenta, caramelized bananas, and cheesy bread. Man, that bread was good. It was light, slightly chewy, and as my boyfriend put it, tasted like goldfish (the cracker, not the fish). You also get a choice of 3 desserts for restaurant week. I went with the chocolate mousse cake but it wasn't fantastic. The meat was the real star of the show.* I've never seen a giant platter of all you can eat smoked salmon before, and as I LOVE smoked salmon, it was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in a long while.

Also love their sides, the caramelized plantains and fried corn meals were unbeatable. And for the meat, make sure you get two portions (or more!) of the ribs and top prime. SO GOOD. Chicken wrapped in bacon is also super satisfying too, but it was a bit salty to my liking. For dessert we had cheesecake and key lime pie. Cheesecake I would have liked it more if it was not as sweet. 5 stars for their bread, selection of meats, and their superb service.

3.0,7/31/2015,"Pretty unimpressed with this place considering their reputation and good Yelp rating. What makes Fogo de Chao unique is the churrascaria style of food and service-- but I think that novelty should only go so far. Yeah it was cool, but I found myself wondering if the restaurant would be as popular had they served the same exact food straight from the kitchen. I was happy with the hostess and overall first impression. She was sweet and accommodating while I waited for my guest to arrive. When she did, we were escorted downstairs to our seats and were soon greeted by a server who seemed to be in a rush. It wasn't that bad, maybe not even worth mentioning. But it was something I noticed.We began at the salad bar which was just a little bit underwhelming. The best parts were the smoked salmon and mozzarella. Looking back at other people's photos, I see that we were missing a lot of the good stuff. maybe because it's restaurant week? But come on. There wasn't any fish, potatoes, pasta. Just your regular salad bar suspects with a few extras like the smoked salmon, prosciutto and salami. Not impressed. I tried not to fill up on the salad bar as I had been warned. A man came over to our table to offer their special restaurant week drink which was a caipirinha inside a pineapple. We ordered one to share. Turns out, the pineapple was a $9 upcharge at $24. Could have done without it. The meats were good. I particularly liked the BBQ pork ribs and sausage. I found they were most flavorful. I also liked the sirloin and parmesan pork. The Parmesan pork was weird though. Not crusted at all, seemed like pork rolled around in Parmesan cheese both in texture and presentation. I could have done without the bacon wrapped chicken. The sides were okay. The caramelized bananas were slightly more mushy than they should have been, the polenta was good and the mashed potatoes were downright bad. Wow, they were SOOO bad. They had literally zero flavor. It was like eating powder that tasted like water.The BEST part for me was the pao de queijo. Soooooo delicious. I was stopping myself from eating them because I wanted to save room but I shouldn't have. They were amazing. The deserts were alright, I had the NY cheesecake as per my waiters suggestion and it was good but could have been colder. It was very soft. And my guest had the chocolate cake which was good. What annoyed me was that I specified that it was my guest's birthday. Both on reservation and to the hostess, but there wasn't any Happy Birthday on her desert plate like I've seen them do in pictures. I'm not sure how they missed this because she even had a happy birthday gift bag on her chair. Whatever. Overall I think that for the money I spent, I could have had a much better meal.

First off, the cheesy bread is addicting and they definitely keep it coming. Next, you have the salad bar, which is not your typical salad bar. At Brazilian steakhouses like this one, there are cheeses, rice, beans, pastas, plantains, etc. so you are pretty much full with just the ""sides"" before the meat event begins to come out ... so take it easy BECAUSE you don't want to miss that delicious, tender, cooked to perfection meats that they bring out and slide right off the skewer for you. All types of steak, pork chops, chicken, lamb, etc. will keep coming your way as long as your card is flipped on the green side. Towards the end of the meal, I was sharing small portions of meat with my friend just so that I can make sure to try it. I'm quite a picky eater and everything that I tried, I liked so that says a lot.

We were able to take advantage of the summer special so for $25 it was a smorgasbord of meat and the amazing salad bar. I've been to many a buffets and this one was by far the best.

When your card is flipped to the green side the servers just keep coming to your table with different meat for you to try. And then there are sides. We had plantain, mashed potatoes and fried polenta rectangles. I can't remember all the different types of meat, but there were many. And then dessert was included!! Ugh. Just go there, eat well and get your money's worth. I may go again before my trip is over.

I've had way better brazilian bbq in Astoria, as well as Churrascaria Plataforma and Texas de Brazil; Fogo de Chao doesn't even compare. The hostess is friendly and the ambiance is 4 stars but I cant say the same about the meats, salad bar or service. First off, they will not seat you until EVERYONE in your group is present; most places will seat the majority of the group but this is not the case here which is very annoying. Second, the salad bar does not have as wide a selection as the other brazilian steakhouses in NYC. Third, we had to flag down some of the servers because the lighting is so dim its easily to miss the green card. Our waiter didnt come by to ask if we needed anything or if everything was ok so service was pretty much non existent. When we were able to flag down servers, the meats were overcooked and under seasoned; most of my medium rare meats were actually well done. As for dessert, I do NOT recommend the chocolate mousse at all! (stick to the key lime or cheesecake) Honestly, I didn't think it was possible to mess up chocolate mousse until now...Entenmann's fudge cake tastes 10x better than the chocolate mousse here. Oh and noise level is unusually high and you have to shout at your guests across the table. Glad I tried Fogo de Chao to see how they compare to the other brazilian steakhouses, but will not be back.",2,1,1,C J.,"New York, NY",43,187,2
3.0,7/28/2015,"Came here for Restaurant Week and overall my experience was generally positive.The staff was warm and the service was above average.  They were relatively attentive and the stream of Brazilian meat offerings was steady from the moment you start eating.  However, I also ate a lot at two of the other big Brazilian steakhouses in Manhattan (Churraschuria Plataforma and Texas de Brazil).  Personally I still like those two options better than Fogo.  There are two main reasons for this.1. I wasn't a huge fan of the meat options.  Even though for restaurant week they didn't offer 5 types of meat from the usual menu, they still had plenty of good cuts to offer such as the signature top sirloin, flank steak, lamb etc.  The issue so much wasn't that the quality was bad, but rather the flavor was pretty inconsistent.  Some of the meat felt bland, while others were extremely salty (the latter being somewhat common in Brazilian steakhouses based on my own experiences).  There wasn't a cut that really stood out positively for me.2. The salad bar was disappointing.  One of the primary features of a good Brazilian steakhouse is the generous amount of options at the salad bar.  Based on eating at Plataforma, Texas de Brazil and even Chima (in Philly) - what was missing here was a real sense of variety.  There was no shrimp cocktail, no soup options, no sushi (which are all offered one way or another at the other Brazilian steakhouses that I went to), and even the smoked salmon tasted bland.  The proscuitto was also tough and unimpressive.  While the salad bar isn't meant to be a place to stuff your face if you're eating meat - compared to their rivals, Fogo definitely needs to work on their variety.It's a shame because the RW deal also included free dessert, which was good.  The chocolate mousse cake was nice, so was the key lime pie.  They also had a special pineapple infused caparinha which was solid.  Unfortunately the place only was average on the two areas that really counted in my book.I'll definitely go back to Brazilian steakhouses in the city .. but given what places like Plataforma and Texas de Brazil have to offer, I'll probably skip Fogo in the future.",3,0,1,Kevin W.,"Manhattan, NY",1288,747,1078
2.0,7/28/2015,"Heard great things about this place.  My family was so excited.  Two of us did say the potato salad was great.  One of us thought the meat was good.  I really felt like it was very average.  I could have gotten those meats at Applebee's or something and saved a TON of money (even though it was restaurant week).  They didn't offer us a menu for drinks, but did ask if anyone wanted anything besides water to drink.  My husband and kids got sodas.  We found out when we received the bill they charge per drink they bring you.  I don't have a problem with that, but they should have told us or offered a menu for us to see it.  We talked to the manager on duty that evening.  We told her we felt like it was just pretty average and about the issue with the drinks.  She couldn't have cared less.  WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!  We will not go back!",0,0,0,Shannon W.,"Advance, NC",0,4,0

4.0,7/27/2015,"I've been waiting to try this location for quite some time. When I heard it was available on RW I made sure I signed up the first day reservations were open on Opentable. Also happened to reserve for the first day of RW. I digress. Brazilian bbq buffet in NYC - what a treat. I don't even want to talk about the normal prices for this place - I paid RW dinner prices and it was delicious.I made a resie at 8pm but we still had to wait like 10/15 minutes. Guess it's hard to gauge sitting time in a buffet. The decor is really up-class high-class. When you get seated, you're greeted by your waiter/waitress explaining the ""red/green"" 'coaster.' Red means 'don't give meat.' Green means 'meat please.' They have a great, beautifully set up salad bar. There is rice on one side, and an island of delicious appetizers. Some highlights include: prosciutto, salami, cheese, smoked salmon, sliced tomatoes, jalapenos, onions, etc. they have salad, greens, vegetables and cheeses. It all is very good.Now onto the meat.. I don't remember everything but I will try my best to remember. Also, in my defense, it was dark lighting inside so my memory is a bit hazy. Also in my defense, the people serving the meat are all of ethnic background, have an accent and spoke softly so it was double trouble hard to hear. Chicken wing - great start huh? Pay top dollar for chicken wings. Just kidding - the chicken wing was my first item and i just remember it was one of the most tender pieces of chicken I've had, with a salty, crisp chicken skin. Linguica - pork sausage. Not a fan - not much more to say than thatLombo - pork loin encrusted with Parmesan cheese. Maybe you'll like it but I didn't. Encrusted may be an understatement to the amount of cheese on it. I remember it being dry as well - pork loin may have been tender? But the cheese made it really dry.Frango - chicken breasts wrapped in bacon. I love this but the chicken was dry. Bacon is bacon so enough said.Cordeiro - lamb. It was very good. Very gamey though aka venison. A very strong taste. The piece I had was tender.Costela de Porco - pork ribs seasoned and cooked. Very good. I only had one piece but couldn't complain.Alcatra - top sirloin. Amazing. Just amazing. Medium rare, well seasoned, tender, almost filet mignon texture.Picanha - top sirloin. Amazing. Just amazing. Medium rare, well seasoned, tender, almost filet mignon texture. LOL you just read the same description twice. I like this one better though. The outside layer had some seasoning and was cooked with a slight crisp.I think that's everything. If not, oh well. All you need to do is turn your coaster thing to green and say yes to everything. Warning, you may become overwhelmed by the amount of meat that comes your way but is that really a warning and is that really a problem? Nevertheless, this was a great experience and I will probably be coming here again for RW.Oh! And the fogo malbec wine was on point.

5.0,7/26/2015,"Came here for Restaurant Week Summer 2015 and it was delicious. You have your pick of the salad bar which has some excellent cheese, smoked salmon and salad dressings. The real joy is the meat, which comes to you round the clock as long as your green coaster is up. The bottom sirloin was my favorite, but their house special steak was incredible as well.  They don't serve the filet as part of the Restaurant Week, but I've had it before and it's delicious as well.  I would say to generally avoid anything encrusted in parmesan (the chicken was particularly dry). For dessert there is a choice of cakes. I enjoyed the cheesecake, but I've definite had better.

5.0,7/25/2015,I've been here two times now. I only come during restaurant week because that is when it is affordable and you get all the perks of regular dinning. For $38 you get the full salad bar which has rice beans and tons of different vegetables and salad. Then we get all the meats and poultry that come around which are prepared wonderfully! I normally like medium well but some meats I would definitely ask for a by under. The service is amazing they are very attentive and quick! Everything is really delicious. During the restaurant week special its $38 per person and you get the full salad bar all the meats for as long as you want and desert. With tax and one drink it comes out to a little over $50 a person which is about half the price if you come on a regular day. This place is a must but you hero come when your really hungry!

We were late for a doctor's appointment, pushing our reservations later and later (like 3 times) was a breeze, no problem at all. Walked in at 1PM only to friendly hostesses, even got our stroller checked in. Our seats were ready in a flash, and warm cheese bread were brought to our table, my favorite part of the meal. Didn't go crazy at the salad bar or the side dishes this time, we just quickly flipped our little coaster over to green and waited patiently for the meat guys to come.Our plates were never empty, the meats just kept flying by.

3.0,7/16/2015,"I messed up. I booked a lunch reservation for two, thinking it was RW. It was not. Shame, shame -- especially as I feel that what I paid for today definitely was not worth the triple-digit bill.Salad/appetizer buffet was beautifully set up (shout-out to the candied bacon that was probably my favorite item on offer at Fogo de Chao [v sad]). Servers who came around with the meats were a little brusque, but whatever, they were busy with the four other tables with diners of 3 each, right? Such a demanding time for them, obviously.The meats were way over-salty, particularly for the filet mignon and the lamb chops, sometimes. Their standard for medium and medium rare did fluctuate in between rounds, with some medium rare options being super bloody and sometimes just pink. Pretty sure I tried most everything worth trying (aka the beef and lamb bc pork and chicken are just a waste of valuable tummy real estate). One server in particular, a young-ish man, was really quite attentive and sweet, so he deserves recognition for his hard work (Katherine, on the other hand, left a tad much to be desired). Beware: the meat is VERY fatty and you'll end up leaving huge chunks of fat/gristle/other unsavory parts of your portion on your plate. Also, I was a bit taken aback at how dessert wasn't included. Somehow, I merely assumed that ti would be included, most likely due to my previous familiarity with the Restaurant Week menu. Long story short, i'ts not included: and my sister's tres leche cake was $11.25 while my chocolate mousse was $11.  For those of you familiar with the venerable Cheesecake Factory, a slice of cake there is around $7-8.

The buffet selection was very limited, I did like the pasta salad. The ribs was the best my opinion but I felt like they kept coming by with the meat that wasn't that popular and the better quality meat was coming out less. Got a free dessert for my brothers graduation and paid for the other dessert which was flan and chocolate molten cake. The cheesey bread is sooo delicious!

It think I may need to be a bigger meat lover to enjoy regardless, didn't live up to my expectation and didn't feel like it was worth the price.So as an FYI, this place has an option of all you can eat for $65. You're given a small plaque thing that is green on one side and red on the other side. Green lets the servers know you want more food and red means you dont want. The restaurant itself is beautiful and is hugeeee. The service is really good as there was always be someone coming to your table giving you more meat if you have the plaque on the green side. The meat was good but some of them were a little dry. I wouldn't recommend getting the chicken, it was a waste of space in your stomach and definitely could have been better. With all the meat options (i think there is 11?) you honestly start to forget what you're eating and what you have eaten. I don't even know if I tried all 11 of the meats. I can't even tell you which my favorite was because  there was honestly just too many! There is a huge salad bar that was pretty good but try not to stuff up on it because you're ultimately paying for the meat so don't waste your stomach for the salad bar.

They open the tables at 5:30pm but you can hang out at the bar before that while you wait for your table. The service is crazy here. A server was at our table literally every 45 seconds with a different meat. I had to flip over to red not because I was full, but because I couldn't keep up with how fast these guys were coming. Every meat is perfectly cooked, and they have very few of those random cheap meats that other brazilian places try to pawn off on you to make you full before you get more of the nice meats. Managers are always walking around and making sure diners are comfortable and have whatever they need. They are always more than happy to accommodate any requests for any specific meat you'd like to try again. The salad bar is also really good. They have a huge bowl of bacon strips. Just bacon strips.

It's literally a cow's rib on a massive cutting board. Not one of those vertical skewers they carry around. You'll thank me. Service: We had a party of 4 on a Saturday night. We get seated and the table we're seated at is really wobbly. I ask to to have it fixed so the waiter crawls under the table and lifts the legs on one side of the table so high that our water starts spilling. He then stands up and walks away. Thanks bud.

5.0,6/15/2015,"Bursting Stomach, Empty Wallet, Worth ItFood: 4.75 StarsI don't recall the name of the majority of meats outside of the filet mignon, but my only recommendation would be to try one of everything. Pace yourself, begin digesting the first slices of the beautiful cuts of meat then start anew. Don't be intimidated by the quantity of meats making their rounds in the dining area. Don't forget to taste the sides and consume at least one plate of each dish, or 4-5 dishes of the polenta (my recommendation). You will be stuffed by the end of the meal, but you' will also be surprised at the fact your body is able to handle so much food. Taste everything, if it is too much share with your fellow diners. Absorb as much of the experience as possible. I sound like a broken record, but Fogo de Chao is a restaurant most people won't be visiting on a yearly basis. Enjoy it now!The only meat that I found to be subpar was the chicken. The reason being the chicken was too dry for my taste.I didn't even touch the salad bar. I forgot about its existence once I saw the meat circling around the tables. Everything is fresh, the mozzarella looked delicious. For private parties it looks as though they have an open bar cart style of handling those events. The variety of alcohols and designs of the bottles almost makes one want to hold a party for themselves and enjoy all the alcohol on their own. Service: 5 StarsHave a special request? Want tea with honey? Want former mayor Rudy Giuliani to sing Happy Birthday to you? Ok maybe the last one is a bit of a stretch. The service goes about and beyond in what they need to do to provide the diners with the best experience possible. Giving proper instructions on the tong utensils, asking what temperature you want, knowing which sections of the meat are particular temperatures. Everyone is well trained and show their professionalism at all times. Your table is carefully watched and if your sides are almost gone they are quickly replaced with fresh, warm ones.Watching the hostess at the front communicate with the other individuals working at Fogo de Chao is interesting. They communicated through walkie-talkie during my visit.Ambiance: 4.5 StarsFrom the entrance you wouldn't be able to tell, but the restaurant is gigantic. From the main entrance overlooking the main dining area to the back room for larger parties you could get lost without the proper direction (maybe I am exaggerating a little). Everything is upscale. Even though there is no real mention of proper attire, I recommend a slightly dressier style of clothing. I feel a t-shirt and shorts wouldn't cut it in this restaurant with such an upscale/trendy atmosphere. I saw two men in Rangers jerseys while eating there, so don't entirely follow my opinion. I do not recall how noisy the restaurant was, the experience drowns out the background noise.Overall (Recommendations): 4.75 StarsFood & Service are spectacular.If you enjoy meat especially at the medium rare and medium temperatures I highly recommend.Expect a bill of approximately $100 per person with tax/tip/drinks/dessert.Come hungry to fully enjoy the meal.DO NOT feel obligated to take a piece of every meat that comes by your table. If you want to slow down it is ok to say no. It will come around again.Relax, take it all in, the environment will allow you to.The dessert is a must have.**Note** If you like your cuts of meat cooked above medium, don't bother. You will not enjoy the value, flavor, texture and everything else the meat can provide you.

4.0,6/8/2015,"This is a big all-you-can-eat Brazilian steak joint in midtown.I've always been a fan of these types of places because you get to sample a great variety of meats to whatever extent that you want. This place offered about 11 or 12 different items.A few different awesome things, like suckling pig, sometimes show up at other places that do Rodizio Churrascaria as well.The idea is pretty simple. Start off at the salad bar, which is typically amazing by itself. I've seen some places offer sushi there as well. I usually go with the smoked salmon, cured meats and hearts of palm right off. This joint had some decent selections (though no sushi):The salmon was amazing. So once you have had your fill of salad, you flip your little circular card over to the green side (as opposed to red), and then the meat guys start coming around:Each diner is equipped with a small pair of tongs to grab the slices of meat as they are carved off the skewers by the swordsmen. Then you start making piles of delicious meat on your plate. Dig in!Above you'll see a little roasted drumette piece of chicken. This was actually my favorite thing they served. So fucking good. There was a lot of different preparations of sirloin, but I think my favorite of the beef was the bottom sirloin, which is pictured just above, next to the lamb chop.Don't forget to slam a beer; shit is salty and you will get thirsty:The sides are free (the meal is a set price) and also ""all-you-can-eat."" Here, you'll want to stick with the caramelized bananas and fried polenta.The mashed potatoes sucked. They were dry and chalky.Save a little bit of room for dessert too, because this shit is pretty good. I had a delicious slice of key lime pie, but they also have flan, creme brûlée, passion fruit mousse, and lava cake with ice cream.Afterwards, the dessert booze cart comes around, along with the bill, of course:",0,0,0,JohnnyPrimeC.

4.0,5/20/2015,"I was excited when I received an invite to this up scale Brazilian barbeque especially being a semi recovering addict of meat down the gullet syndrome (I'm lying like a rug, I love all things meat, shhh I know I'm setting myself up with that statement).  This guy was not disappointed.Oh, the unmistakeable primal urge to rip and tear all forms of beef, pork, lamb and chicken without having to kill and skin then cook it, they do it for you. Sometimes I awake in the middle of the night with meat on my mind with a stash of beef jerky or pepperoni where only I can find in the depths of the refrigerator or cupboard up high, but I digress. If a smorgasbord of endless all you can eat meat on skewers appeals to you, then here you go.I've been to other Brazilian BBQ's in the past, but not like this. First off an unbelievably fresh and quite large salad bar with slices of sandwich type  meat like prosciutto & soppressata, cheese's, roasted veggies like eggplant and zucchini, variety of super hot peppers and of course all types of salad options. I had to force myself to a limit of 1 & 1/2 plates so there would be room for the barrage of protein I was about to encounter.They have a very unique system to let the server's know when to offer and when to by pass you. You receive a coaster that is green for yes filler up and the other side is red for taking a breather. You have to know I saw only green, baby. Now the variety being offered up is as vast as the ceiling is high, you won't feel cramped with these super high cathedral like ceiling in the dining room, that's for sure. Seasoned and cooked to perfection. Every cut of beef known to man, so it seemed, it's hard to remember what you devoured last because they keep coming like waves in the ocean. I always ask for a lil bit of fat slightly burnt with my slice of marbleized wonderfullnes. Lamb that melted in my mouth may have been my favorite, but as I said it's difficult to tell with skewer after skewer filling my plate until it runneth over into my tum tum. So I apologize for not describing the options in greater detail, but this is one of those places you'll have to experience for yourself.Service is impeccable. They not only delivered mouth watering descriptions per item that would make Gordan Ramsey proud, but paid close attention to your beverage needs. Remarkably decadent for a undoubtedly coma laden meat fest.A bit pricey around $70ish depending on choice drinks per person, but in the heart of NYC what would you expect. Impressive wine list. The mixologists keep top shelf cocktails flowing, tonight the ""Old Fashion's"" kept me comfy.Come hungry and leave adjusting one more notch on the belt for breathing room.

4.0,4/26/2015,"Pleasantly surprised when I heard one of my old time faves opened up in the city adding another Brazilian churascarria. The first thing I noticed is the space is very large. The dining area is in the lower level basement but because of the setup (there is no 1st floor really) the effect is of soaring ceilings and the feeling that you're in a cathedral of a dining room, a rarity in NYC where you're often sitting elbow to elbow in a crowded tiny dining room. The food was as good as I remembered it with helpful and polite servers ready to throw a myriad of beef pork and chicken your way. As usually I stayed away from the lesser cuts of pork and chicken and stuck with the filet and garlic picanha. Picanha is the must have as it epitomizes what Brazilian bbq is. It's popular in Brazil and arguably the signature cut here despite it being what I recall is just a rump roast. But it's pretty damn tasty. With all that meat in my belly I had to head to the salad bar (yes I did) for a plate of greens to make sure I was at least keeping to a balanced diet :)",0,0,0,Jiho S.,"New York, NY",74,569,138

The decor was gorgeous with dark wood and sultry lighting which really set the tone for the evening. There was a little wait since we went for dinner on a Saturday but our group had a few drinks at the bar to kill some time. I had the caipiriña,the boys had JW black and ginger, some of the girls had a peach and champagne drink - each of them were reasonably priced and delicious. My caipiriña was my favorite since I love limes. We were taken downstairs to the dining hall to get our dinner started. The salad bar had a wide variety but it wasn't as large as I was hoping for. My favorite items here were the cheese, grilled portobellos, caprese salad and cured meats. After all of that, it was time to get started on our meat fest. Every single cut of beef was delicious! I especially loved the garlic sirloin (juicy and salty goodness), the filet mignon (of course!!), bacon wrapped filet, lamb chops and bacon wrapped chicken. The sides were good, we mostly ate the mashed potatoes and I think the rest went untouched. After dinner, we had one of everything from the dessert menu and our favorites were tiramisu and the chocolate cake.

3.0,4/8/2015,"This is really a 3.5 rating. I never really had Brazilian food or steak (I guess in this context) so I don't have anything to compare Fogo de Chao to. I made reservations for 3 at 6pm on a Friday, the last day of restaurant week. Upon arriving, the decor is nice and modern with very high ceilings. The hostess checked in my reservation and directed us downstairs to our table. No wait, though it wasn't to begin with. Because of the high ceiling, the voices will echo, so it was kinda loud. In result, I didn't hear the waiter too well. He explained how to signal the people with the meat to give us meat. (haha). Which is a circular paper that has red on one side and green on the other. He also said the salad bar was also unlimited so, you may get up as many times as you like. Onto the actual food! Salad bar had a nice variety of meats like salami, smoked salmon, pastrami, prosciutto. There was also cheeses, lettuce, spinach, tomatoes, beans, pasta, chicken salad, rice and beans, bacon, and much more. I only went once because you're here for the meat and not the fillers, plus there's sides they give you (as part of restaurant week). The sides were fried plantains, polenta, and mashed potatoes. (of course bread was included too, which was delicious). Note: all sides were unlimited too. So all of the sides and stuff from the salad bar was good (except for the bread/crostini from the salad bar was very hard.) After eating so much already, it was time to eat some meat. Though it was hard to hear each person to explain what it was, the first few times, I just said yes to everything. I think it's a hit or miss for some items, but the signature sirloin and NY strip are good. The lamb was also cooked well. The chicken wrapped in bacon was dry. There was one piece of meat that was too salty and I don't remember which one it was, perhaps one of the sirloin (I think there was two types going around).So what I found fascinating was the strolling bar/bar trolley going around the restaurant. Instead of a stationary bar, why not have it go around to each table. Man, the bartender was very keen on selling this pineapple/coconut drink that supposedly help digest meat (or something like that). Though it had me sold because it was different and something to try. It didn't have so much alcohol in it, but it was quite refreshing. The service was okay. The waiter came around and checking in on us and I believe a manager came over to us as well. When I asked for chimichurri sauce, I had to ask twice. Maybe the way it's set up, the waiters doesn't do that? only the busboys/runners? I'm not sure. Overall, it was a nice experience. You will definitely get your fill if everything is unlimited. For an AYCE style of dining AND being a chain restaurant, it had up to par food. The one disappointing thing (especially being perceived as a higher class restaurant), the bathroom floor was SUPER sticky. Fogo de Chao is a nice place for a girls night out, a 3rd date, reunion. It's like business casual sort of ambiance. Nice location too! Because it's near 5th ave and across the street from the MoMa.

One of my friends had booked the reservation for us and all I remember him telling me was that because we were doing the RW dinner, we couldn't have filet mignon (plus other cuts which are completely lost on me at this point), but regardless, we had plenty of choices. My most favorite was the Picanha which is a prime cut of top sirlon - apparently very popular at Southern Brazil churrascarias. So juicy, tender and flavorful. I just kept getting it every time they came by the table. The staff was very nice, but sometimes it was hard to flag them down to refill our glasses. Mind you, this is a very large and loud restaurant which doesn't look it from the outside because the dining room is downstairs. I don't think they are quite equipped to handle the large volume of customers - or maybe it was because it was RW. Despite the hiccup with trying to get small plates of carmelized banana, refills on bread and water for the table, I'll be willing to come back again and pay full price for the meal.

4.0,3/23/2015,"NOTE: 4.5 StarsFinally got a chance to try the world famous Fogo de Chao steakhouse and it did not disappoint. There have been quiet a few Brazilian steakhouse's in NYC (and Long Island) that I have been to. Each with their own little perks that make them great. Greenfields has fallen off and the Rodizio chains have all but disappeared leaving Fogo de Chao to take the crown and they have done so. First of all I came here for restaurant week. Didn't end up ordering from the RW 2015 menu which was $20 dollars cheaper. It was nice that they offer that. I don't recall the other Brazilian spots offering that deal so thats a huge plus. The meat selection was amazing. I mean that is what you come there before. The salad bar was not the best. The stuff they had was nice but other places offered quite a bit more as far as sides go and hot dishes. Still all of this is forgotten when a large selection of tasty meats come steaming your way. The other great thing about Fogo de Chao is the service. Staff is very friendly. The waiter would come around and ask if there was something I didn't try that I would like to. It does get business in there and not all the selections will come to your area. Don't deprive yourself, just let your waiter know. Plus there might be a few things not on the regular menu that you have to ask for from the back. So overall I highly recommend this place. The salad bar was meh but everything else was very much on point. If you are cheap sumbitch wait til restaurant week is going on and you can chow down at almost half the price (for 2).",1,1,0,Eric R.,"Westbury, NY",481,272,20

It's pricey but all Brazilian steakhouses are so that is to be expected. This one is definitely nicer in terms of decor and the enormous dining room is a sight to behold.I've also been to the upstairs bar around a dozen times for various functions. Some with food, some without. And I officially declare it the worst bar scene in all of Manhattan. It is expensive, terribly slow service (usually only 1 bartender), and the beer selection is random bottles only from a tin tub behind the bar. It's like grabbing whatever beer is leftover at a backyard bbq out of the cooler, and paying $10 for it. They use sugar packets in the capirinha - not exactly authentic.

All of the other servers and support staff were great. Everyone seemed interested in the quality of our experience. We have been to other Fogo de Chao restaurants and several other Brazilian steakhouses. The main difference with Fogo de Chao is that they have many delicious cuts of meat, and not just one or two good ones like at many other Churrascarias. They also serve their full service of meats for lunch and dinner. That was what made us choose them over the others. They gave us a beautiful complimentary dessert for our anniversary, and that was really sweet. We particularly enjoyed the lamb chops and the sirloin. We wish it was easier to differentiate between all the different malbecs, the menu could do with a few more full bodied cabernets to choose from. One would be wise to disregard any negative reviews during restaurant week. That is not a normal circumstance for any restaurant.

5.0,3/15/2015,"I recently had dinner here on a Friday evening during Restaurant Week March 2015 and had an amazing experience.First off the restaurant itself is spacious and elegant enough that most types of dinner events could be held there easily. The restaurant quickly became crowded but getting a table for two wasn't very difficult as walk ins. Once you are seated your are given instructions on how things work. For one there are cards on the table that are use to request meat to your table or stop. Secondly, we were told that certain dishes were served to the table but salad could be retrieved from the buffet. I also found various types of rice dishes by the salad bar. The salad options were very fresh from what I observed.After we were seated with our salad choices we started with the meat by turning our table cards to green and almost immediately various servers showed up to our table with so many different cuts if meat. Most of the chicken options I was not really a fan of because I found them to be on the dry side. The best meat option in my opinion were the pork ribs - they were seasoned and grilled to perfection. Many of the beef cuts were delicious as well. We ate until we almost burst at the seams - literally. We also ordered a drink called the mango fresca that was a sweet girly tasting drink with a little kick which was perfect for me. I observed that this restaurant was definitely a favorite for guys and most of them did not waste time with a salad or anything green LOL. Dessert was also delicious - I chose the cheesecake while my friend had the chocolate mousse cake.I wanted to asked if doggy bag take homes were allowed but my friend insisted that I not ask. This was because she didn't want any attention to the doggy bags she was packing herself already LOL (She's going to kill me when she reads this!!)The staff was super friendly, helpful and attentive.

4.0,3/15/2015,"We went here for Restaurant Week, which is a tremendous deal -- $38 for all you can eat meat, salad bar, and sides? Insane. Definitely worth it. The place was packed when we went and our table was a little awkwardly located, but it was fine. We didn't spend long at the salad bar (why waste your appetite on anything but the meat, really?) but I enjoyed what I got. The RW menu took away what are perhaps the ""choicest"" cuts of meat (I think we had 8 options instead of 10? Something like that), but it's hard to notice. There's so much variety and all of the stuff comes very quickly. I will say the chicken they serve is rather dry -- I briefly choked on a piece -- so maybe stick with the red meats. The sides and bread are also delicious, and the RW menu even came with dessert. I couldn't imagine eating another bite, but I managed to enjoy the frosting on my slice of chocolate cake. Overall, very delicious! The main drawback is probably just how crammed in all the tables are.",1,0,1,Taylor G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,62,0
4.0,3/10/2015,"If I can sum up my experience in one word, it would be delectable. This restaurant is deceiving from the outside, as it looks smaller from the street.  The moment I walked in, it was a like a SECRET CAVE in the hustle and bustle of midtown. This place was massive and BEAUTIFULLY DECORATED!ON TO THE FOOD:Salad bar/appetizer bar: UNLIMITED buffet bar of a variety of cheese, vegetables, rice, beans, and salad options.  My favorite was the smoked salmon. Sides: UNLIMITED SIDES of Pao de Queijo (Brazilian cheese bread), caramelized plantains, polenta and garlic mashed potatoes. These were refilled continuously throughout the meal, even without asking. We came back with our plates, and decided to flip our cards to green... and at that moment; we were surrounded by skewers of meat. I WAS IN HEAVEN.  Entrées: UNLIMITED MEAT (in order of my preference after a sampling of each)-Picanha (top sirloin with garlic): Being that this is the ""most popular cut"", I wanted to try pieces from different servers throughout my meal.  I was satisfied with every piece, with the meat prepared the same way each time. This was my favorite.-Alcatra (top sirloin): Extremely tender and well-seasoned with enough fat and meat proportions to keep it juicy.-Costela de Porco (pork ribs): Looked forward to these, seeing it being served at other tables. These ribs were very tender with a good balance between fat and meat, making it extra flavorful. However, it took about 45 minutes before these were offered to us. A server gave ribs to tables on both sides of ours, and skipped over our table even when I tried to call him over. -Fraldinha (bottom sirloin with sea salt): I had 2 pieces from 2 different batches. One was saltier than I preferred, but both were tender and flavorful. -Linguica (pork sausage): Well marinated and smelled delicious when the server came to our table. I noticed these were offered more frequently throughout the meal for every table.-Cordeiro (lamb): Very good, perfectly seasoned. -Lombo (pork loin filets): These were encrusted in parmesan cheese.  It may have been the batch we were offered, but it was more on the dry side. -Frango (chicken breast wrapped in bacon): I am a sucker for bacon. However, the chicken was a little dry and overwhelmed by the salty bacon.Dessert: Choice of cheesecake, chocolate mousse cake or key lime pie. We chose the cheesecake and key lime pie. Both were good, but not the highlight of our meals, plus we were extremely full to completely enjoy them! HahaFor the Restaurant Week price of $38 per person for dinner it was a steal (especially when dinner is normally about $60+ per person). The service is accommodating and very attentive when it came to flipping our cards from green to red, or vice versa.

What I liked the most is the smoked salmon with avocado in the side. The meat was ok... It was as you would expect from a Brazilian buffet: they come with meat and serve you with different types of meat (filets, strips, chicken, sausages, etc).

4.0,3/8/2015,"I'm a fan, simply because of the -rare- cooked bacon wrapped filet mignons. They're the most amazing piece of beef you can have. Now, the thing is that often they will serve you medium or at best medium rare filet; claiming it is cooked rare. They can do better, and they do that at other Fogo locations. NYC is a special place on earth...The caipirinha at $14 a pop is a bit too expensive - and not quite worth it - but definitely delicious.As for the meats their bottom sirlion, ribeye, etc etc is just absolutely great - and you can get it served however you want. Pro tip is to take it easy on the cheese bread when starting out here, simply to allow you to sample all the meats.Fogo is place I bring all my out of town friends at least once, just because of the dining experience. Due to a few incidents where I've been unhappy with service (only at this NYC location) I may try out another place next time around, but only if I know that my dear Fogo will remain.If you've never tried a churrascaria this is simply an amazing experience, 'nuff said.",0,0,0,Henrik G.,"New York, NY",12,50,1

4.0,3/8/2015,"After trying Brazilian steak previously in midtown I figured restaurant week was the perfect excuse to give it another go here. With a $20 dollar discount I came in with my twin and 2 friends and we were seated within 15 minutes. You are taken down a long spiral staircase where you pass a large buffett area and a plethora of seating. Quickly after seating we were given little placeholders to flip green if we wanted food or red to stop. After sampling the buffet which had some nice veggies and cheeses, I sat ready for the main attraction the meat. The food was solid but not amazing. I liked the chicken legs wrapped in bacon and the skirt steak. Their house specialty was OK and some of their other cuts of meat were a bit on the pinker side when I had hoped for medium. The service was exceptional however, your plate was empty for maybe 30 seconds before more meat was offered and they constantly came around asking if you wanted something to drink or remove a plate that had enough food on it before to give you a new one. The desert I ordered was the chocolate mousse and it was really great. Overall, this was a successful and fun dinner, I dont know if I'd come back at full price here but if someone is really craving brazillian steak I know where to turn.",2,1,1,Alan B.,"Greenwich Village, Manhattan, NY",302,453,12
4.0,3/8/2015,"Well, this was the second time i've done AYCE Brazilian in NYC. If Churrascaria Plataforma was a hipster, Fogo de Chao is his corporate brother wearing a three piece suit. That is not necessarily a bad thing.I came here with a group of 4 for restaurant week. How can you possibly turn down all the succulent meats of Brazil for just $39.99 (normally $59.99).  We made a reservation 1 week in advance and only had to wait 5 minutes with a cool little buzzer that reminded me of Cheese Cake Factory.Upon descending a steep winding stair case you access the main sesating area which really doesn't feel like New York City. The space is pretty massive. And there wasn't an empty table, because again the discount made it tough to pass up.The service was top notch. Our waiter appearaed moments after we sat and he asked us if we were here for restaurant week, which of course we all nodded vigorously to. He took our drink orders and told us to head to the salad bar first, then we get back they'll start with the meat service.I was very impressed by how healthy the salad bar choices were. If you were trying to go strictly paleo here, it would be easily accomplished. I munched on an assortment of veggies, but I was saving my appetite for the main attraction, all the meat!WIthout remembering every dish in detail, I can provide some of my opinions. The sirloin cut was juicy but a little salty for my likings. Their was an extremely succulent cut of lamb that I ate, which one member in our party (Alejandro) loved and I enjoyed a lot. Their signature prime rib was a touch on the dry side. Their were some other steak cuts that came out. I enjoyed some more than others, but the theme in my mind was that they were all a little salty for my taste. However, that was probably my only complaint as the meats were fresh and for the most part juicy.The desert I ordered (which was included with RW) was the chocolate mousse cake. It was delicious, I think I won in this department as the others who tried the Key Lime Pie weren't as satisifed.I thought the bathroom was really classy also. It was spacious with a marble finish. Again, more of that corporate thing.In the end, I ended up spending about $50 after tax,tip,and my non-alcoholic drink.

5.0,3/5/2015,"UNLIMITED SALAD AND SIDES. UNLIMITED BREAD. UNLIMITED MEAT. Yeah that's what you're getting. I personally think Fogo de Chao was very considerate to participate in Restaurant Week with a menu like that but it did the trick, it got my attention and now I know how amazing they are. Let's start with me being late for my table, It was difficult walking out there in terrible weather but I still insist on trying to show up. I showed up way past my reservation and they gave me a table anyways. I was so rushed, I didn't realize I was about to be brought down two flights of stair case to a big and beautiful dining area. Even though I knew I was there to chow down on plates and plates of meat like a baby dinosaur, something about the staircase and ambience made me feel a bit fancy. The feeling of feeling fancy went away right after my server said we're good to head to the salad and side bar for anything and everything! I was so ready to dig in. The salad and side bar was tricky, there was so many things I wanted to eat there but I knew I had to leave my appetite for the meat. Some highlights from the salad bar was their fresh vinaigrette, smoked salmon, chicken salad, and fresh mozzarella. The brazilian cheese bread, caramelized bananas, garlic mashed potatoes, and polenta that was served for each table was a miss for me. Now here comes the great part, the meat ..Picanha - the prime part of the top sirloin is their most popular cut and which ended up to be my FAVORITE! I usually don't eat sirloin, how did they make it so juicy and tender? Oh, and that layer of crispy crust sprinkled with flavor and then the fatty layer right before you bite into the medium rare insides of the meat, AMAZING. I think I can literally sit there throughout my meal and just eat this cut. Cordeiro - the leg of the lamb was really juicy and tender but could use some extra seasoning. I'm too used to having lamb chops and they're usually gamey but this piece of lamb was not gamey at all, so go for it even if you usually don't like lamb. Costela de Porco - they described it as tender pork ribs and cooked to perfection and indeed it was tender. It wasn't the fall right of the bone part (which I hate) but it was cooked just right. The Linguica (pork sausage) and Frango (bacon wrapped chicken breasts) were a hit or miss. The Alcatra (top sirloin) was a miss, it could've been my because my piece was more on the well done side and I prefer my meat more rare. The difference between the regular $60pp and the $38 RW menu is the prime meat selection. I ended the night with the choice of New York cheesecake, key lime pie, or chocolate mousse cake. Uh, can I have it all? Might as well make dessert unlimited too! It was a great experience, and I'll definitely be back restaurant week or not!",13,5,4,Carrie C.,"Brooklyn, NY",546,336,2421
4.0,3/5/2015,"Fogo de Chao has been on my radar since I was a kid growing up in Puerto Rico. In this Plato's Cave, I formed my knowledge on sporadic glimpses on the mainland (not surprisingly, most of which involved food advertising). On every flight I've been on, Sky Mall (RIP) showcased the fine meats of Fogo de Chao in exotic locations like New York, San Francisco, and Omaha NE. Any request to go here would be outvoted by my parents (even as a chubby child, I did not eat enough to warrant $50 worth of meat, plus my dad is essentially a vegetarian).  So as an adult, when Restaurant Week rolled over and fellow Yelpers Alan B. and Jon B. invited me to try out this restaurant, I was keen to accept. Judging by most of the other Yelp reviews, it seems like no one comes here other than during Restaurant Week, and in this instance, I won't be the exception. Afterall, RW makes this a somewhat affordable treat; I really couldn't see myself dropping about $70 including tax and tip when I can get the same experience for $20 less. This place (a temple of meat, if you will) almost looks like an optical illusion. You rarely find large restaurants in Manhattan--Fogo is massive and modern. There is so much food here, it's hard to keep track. Everything was good, some things were particularly outstanding. FdC is a well oiled machine. Considering how busy they were on a Thursday night during RW, they were extremely efficient in seating us, getting food to our table, providing dessert, and bringing the check in shortly thereafter. I do wish the staff did a better job of explaining what each of the offering entailed. The only explanation you receive comes from menus by the entrance vaguely highlighting the RW offerings. I'd like to know what the picanha is, for example, and how it's seasoned and cooked. The servers just give you a one word explanation of what they bring over. Alright, on to the food. Pan de queso is a memorable Brazilian treat. I can't vouch for how FdC makes it, but it's usually gluten free, as it's cooked with tapioca flour. Don't fill up on it, but do use it to soak up the au jus from the meat (the servers are happy to provide you with some from their trays if you ask). What was outstanding: the skirt steak and one of the lamb dishes. The skirt steak's flavor was enhanced with enough garlic, salt, and pepper to let the cut shine. I have no idea what the lamb dish was called, or how it was seasoned (see paragraph above), but it's one of the best lambs I've tasted. Honorable mentions to the chicken legs wrapped in bacon (juicy and tender), as well as the parmesan crusted pork (also tender, and a good concept overall). I wasn't impressed with the restaurant's ""signature cut"" of prime rib. It was too dry for my taste. None of the side dishes manages to steal the show, so make sure you don't get full on those. The RW offerings included dessert: a choice of cheesecake, chocolate moose, or key lime pie. I chose the latter, as it's one of my favorite desserts. It was decent at best here; while I liked the fresh whipped cream, the graham crackers had an odd aftertaste of chocolate. I'm going to file Fogo de Chao under my ""been there, done that"" category. You come here for the experience, after all. Having sampled pretty much the restaurant has to offer, I would rather pay individually for the lamb, parmesan pork, and the skirt steak. I really just wish I knew what that lamb dish was called, I'm going to be dreaming about it for a while...",2,3,3,Alejandro B.,"Arlington, VA",345,387,18

I had to admit that I made the mistake of high expectation. The decoration is good. But the place is way too packed! Maybe they have to crank up the column due to restaurant week but most tables are less than 3 feet apart from each other. Let's focus on the food. Most of the meat are way too salty with a lot of seasoning.Wonder if it's a trick to get you to drink more water & eat less or due to lack of freshness... The variety seems to be really lacking. You keep seeing 5 of the meat going around but not the rest. I've been expecting the Cordeiro all night and only got it toward the end after asking different waiters 3 times. And by then I was too full to really taste it! I know first world problem but still! Also I really like the chicle leg but it only came around once!

All you can eat salad bar with A LOT of choices and also continuous service of meat for $38+tax+tip. It's such a good deal! The picanha (medium rare) is my favorite meat. I could eat it again and again. I usually ask for two pieces whenever the server comes by with it. It's very juicy. The server cuts the meat in front of you and you can enjoy it while it's still hot.The dessert was okay- just slices of cakes. The manager, Ricardo is great. One of the staff broke a glass near me (not even on me), and they apologized so many times, cleared everything (including tablecloth) from our table, gave us lamb chops (which isn't a RW option), and etc. The service is so great.

There were very few moments where my plate was empty, Fogo doesn't seem to be the type of place to keep you waiting for food. A must-go if you're a proud carnivore who enjoys novel experiences.

2.0,2/25/2015,"Came for restaurant week on our anniversary  for 38$  we always wanted to try it so why not. Salad bar is all you can eat but it was mediocre I only recommend the fresh mozzarella and potato salad. The cheese bread was great and the sides for the table were ok polenta, mash and the sweet plantains. Now for the real stuff I'm a big meat eater so the quality really affected my experience. All of the meats came right off the grill which was great but so overly seasoned  and super salty. They were trying to hide the fact that the quality of the meat wasn't great. The  picanha was my favorite for now. The dessert was meh cheesecake and chocolate cake. The real issue was when I got home I have never felt sick after eating a meal and oh I felt like crap. I ended up throwing up and drinking a ton of water. I know my sodium intake was wayyyy to high. My bf also woke up in the middle of the night super thirsty. So be prepared to be super thirsty because of all that salt.

Quick service, great prices on beer considering the area.Once seated, went to the salad station and grabbed a few items. Nothing crazy, typical salad bar. Ordered the restaurant week special. $38 for 12 different types of meat, mashed potatoes, sweet plantain, & polenta. All average. The meat was alright, some were a bit salty. Quantity is never a problem in churrascarias. The quality is a bit average. Maybe I was expecting better. Although I wasn't able to try their filet mignon, ribeye, and a couple of other cuts. MAYBE that's where the difference maker is. I've been to other Brazilian steakhouses where the quality of meat was much better. Dessert was average. Cheesecake and chocolate cake. Although you can barely enjoy it after eating all that abundance of food.I gave it 3 stars bc of the food. Which is the primary reason for going to a restaurant. But I can't stress enough, the service was perfect. Everyone is on point from the bus boys, to the guys cutting the meat. Everyone does their part and you get that impeccable service whether you pay full price or go for restaurant week.

The mashed potatoes left much to be desired. The caramelized bananas and fried polenta were good. The dessert was ok but they skimped on the portions for restaurant week diners. The best part of our meal was the cheese bread and the Brazilian limeade. The limeade is $4.50 with free refills. You will definitely want to order one of those- so refreshing!

The only difference between restaurant week and regular dining was that restaurant week customers did not get offered certain kinds of meats. Fine by me! The 11 different kinds that we were offered still exceeded our expectations. How they are able to make chicken breast so juicy will be forever a mystery to me. The unlimited salad bar had more than just simple fresh greens; there was a variety of cheeses, prosciutto and other hams, smoked salmon, white rice, beans, and so, so many more. In addition, each table gets 3 free sides - plantains, mashed potatoes, and polenta fries. Needless to say, i was barely able to sit straight by the end of the meal.

For starters me n my party arrived 30 mins late for our 10pm reservations but the still accommodated us n ensure we would stu get the full experience even though kitchen closed at 11. Boy did they ever treat us like we came at 7 pm. From the salad bar to the sides and cheesy bread the waiters and even manager made sure we had food made sure we got extra sides n even let us know when they were gonna shut down the salad bar so we could get more be4 they did!!! Also my friend didn't eat beef do they made sure they brought her chicken breast and chicken legs. The staff just made the whole experience great taking one star off because the messed up on our credit cards kept charging one card twice for two different payments it just became annoying but didn't damper the night!!!!!!

4.0,2/19/2015,"Solid 4 stars for Fogo - Came here for restaurant week (8:30 was our reservation, and they were able to seat us at 8:15 when we arrived).Ambiance: This place is MASSIVE. All (i think) tables are on the bottom floor and there is a large wine cellar on the first floor - there are massive windows so you can see all the wines. It is similar to a Boy's Club (dark wood walls, high ceilings). Food: The restaurant week menu is $40 and they offer you the same type of service as non-restaurant week - unlimited meats (when an exception of a few). Don't even bother with the salad bar - there is not a very wide selection and you should save room for the meat which will definitely fill you up. You get these cards for your table and you flip it to the green side when you want to start eating, and flip it to the red side when you're done. I ate all the meats (aside from the pork) and they were fantastic. They come over to your table and carve the meat right there - you pick how you want it cooked. They also bring you sides - plantanes, mashed potatoes, and polenta. The mashed potatoes were the best, BUT we kept asking for more and they wouldn't bring anymore! So that's a negative - if they ran out, they could have just told us instead of empty promises. For dessert, we tried the chocolate mousse and the  cheesecake.

3.0,2/14/2015,"Fogo de Chão has great service and offers a fun / interesting dining experience (my first time at a Brazilian steakhouse).  However, as a meal option, it wasn't up my alley, and I probably wouldn't return (for the food, at least).As other reviewers have mentioned, the set up is a fancy buffet with a salad bar and waiters walking around with various cuts of meat. Highlights for me included: cured salmon, fresh mozzarella, and pineapple from the salad bar; the house cut (Picanha), Beef Ancho, and Alcatra from the meats. Oh, and the cheese bread -- the cheese bread was very, very good.However, my main qualm with the meal is that while I appreciated the variety, and the various meat cuts seemed solid with nice seasoning... it didn't feel like I tasted anything above ""good"" ('cept for the cheese bread). While the price ($60pp) was a great deal for the quantity / variety offered, I would have preferred one falling-off-the-bones tender piece of lamb or a nice, juicy medium rare cut of filet mignon. Given the Brazilian steakhouse format, I'm not sure if that's possible (or what they're aiming for). Nothing against the restaurant -- I'm probably just not well suited for this format.We ordered the flan and key lime pie for dessert -- I would advise skipping these. Flan was overly sweet, key lime pie was a bit too sour.Interesting bit: I came here for Valentine's Day dinner. At the end, the servers gave us a gift card for a complimentary lunch/dinner at a later date.

I came to Fogo last weekend with my pharmacy school classmates/roommates (all respectful, kind, caring, and professional human beings) it was a birthday dinner. It was a party of 12 and we asked ahead of time if we can split it into 2 checks ahead of time, they waiter said it was fine.

For example it was some of our first time at an all you can eat Brazilian restaurant, the directions were given about the salad bar and making it seem like we would not willing to pay more for extra entrees. As if we weren't aware it was $60/person. I thought- maybe he's just having a bad night) silly me---Not only was the service with our waiter terrible, the waiter charged both checks incorrectly!! On one check, they added an additional person, on the other checks they charged us a 20% tip twice..(40% total) and on top of it they charged us drinks we did not order (the 5 people on my check had ZERO alcoholic beverages) We waited patiently as they brought back the corrected check... To notice this time they charged it incorrectly again. We only had the $59.95/person all you can eat meat and salad bar, no drinks, only hot tea for $3.95The total for 5 people (60x5)+4 for  one hot tea should be: $304$304 +(25.50 for 8.5%tax) +(60 for 20% tip)= $390.3They charged our credit cards to a total of $460, I don't know why they can't just do the math correct. They tried to give is $10 cash back per person and at that it would be too difficult to fix it. We were all in a rush to leave so we just took it event though it didn't cover why they actually owed us, a total of $60... Which still turns out to be an extra person eating all you can eat.

My waiter helped me take off my coat, which got awkward because it was hard to take off due to the many layers I had on, winters in NY are no laughing matter. But the waiter and I made light of the awkward moment and joked about it. It was my first time there so the waiter explained the process. We are given a coaster which has a green color on one side and red on the other. When the green faces up it lets the gaucho chefs, that are constantly circulating around serving, that you are ready for table side service. When you are satisfied you flip the coaster to red until you are ready for more.But first to the salad bar! I would have been satisfied with just eating at the salad bar.It had fresh cut vegetables, imported cheeses, cured meats and sushi. My favorite was the potato salad and the mango shrimp salad that I still think about from time to time. And I hate mixing savory with sweet but it worked this time.  I had to pace myself because I needed to make room for the feast ahead of me. The sides came which were crispy polenta, garlic mash potatoes and caramelized bananas. I tried them and wasn't impressed by any of them. The polenta was mediocre, mash potatoes tasted like the instant kind, and I don't like caramelized bananas in general. But that didn't matter much because I wasn't there for the sides. I was there for the MEAT!  I tried the rib eye, roasted pork, fillet mignon,  New York strip, sirloin, and chicken wrapped bacon. Everything tasted amazing except the chicken was too dry. At one point I forgot I left my coaster facing green and I just kept being bombarded with meat. I was so stuffed I had no room for dessert as usual. My friend used my weakness against me, cheesecake, and convinced me to order some even if I had to take it home. I'm glad I did.

4.0,1/11/2015,"Came for a birthday dinner. It's hard not to like a place whose selling point is all you can eat meat. Some of the meats were FANTASTIC. Unfortunately I can't name which ones because after a few minutes you just start discerning what you're eating based on which animal it came from. So best I can offer is there was a piece of pork which had (I'm guessing here) a lemon pepper dry rub that I thought was delicious. Also one of the many pieces of beef I tried had a great dry rub as well.I'd say my only gripe with my experience is my group ended up being seated in the far corner next to the stairs. As soon as we were being led to our table I mentioned to a friend that we were going to end up forgotten by the servers. And alas, there were stretches where we had to flag someone down to get more food. And our water glasses were never refilled-- which is rough when you're scarfing down pounds of salty meat. I wasn't as impressed with the salad bar as I thought I would be based on other reviews. But that could just be because I'm averse to vegetables. I did find some prosciutto, cheeses and smoked salmon though that were a good appetizer. Definitely not a place I'd come to often, but so glad places like this exist.

The beans had large chunks of pork in them. The steak was perfectly cooked to my liking and served with a delicious chimichurri sauce. Considering I ate this meal in an upscale Midtown Manhattan restaurant for this astonishing price is something to marvel at.

2.0,1/5/2015,"Let me start by saying that Fogo de Chao had always been a synonym for excellent customer service and the unparalleled art of preparing high-quality meats Brazilian style. Having dined at Fogo numerous times over the last couple of years, I had not been disappointed once - a visit to Fogo de Chao was always something special, which is why I decided to make reservations for New Year's at the recently opened Fogo de Chao in New York. I'm afraid we'll remember that dinner for a long way - not in a good way, though.Our server was uninterested and seemingly annoyed he had to work on New Year's Eve - accordingly, service we received from him was just sub-par: After delivering drinks and sides, he disappeared and never checked on us to refill drinks or pick up plates. Service provided by the ""gaucho chefs"" was at a similar low level: Although we were seated quite close to the kitchen, meats would only be served every 10-15 minutes. When they finally arrived, they were lukewarm and either extremely dry or half-raw inside. Undercooked sausage anyone?I informed the manager on duty (Lily) about the situation. She promised to ""check what's going on"" and bring quality of service back to the high level we were used to from our past visits at other locations. Shortly after our conversation, a gaucho chef indeed came with the requested picanha - however, despite our polite request to slice the pieces ""thin"" and ""medium rare"", he cut 2-3"" thick slobs of meat onto our plates that were completely raw inside and simply inedible! I signaled Lily (who had been watching the scene from nearby) and showed her what we had been served. She agreed that for a restaurant priding itself in the preparation of meat, the situation was ""completely unacceptable,"" and she ""didn't know what was going wrong today."" Unfortunately, Lily's promise to ""take our plates to the kitchen and show the chefs"" seemed to be more of an excuse for her to get out of an uncomfortable situation, as she never returned to our table to resolve the problem.The buffet, which we decided to try while waiting for Lily, was equally disappointing: At around 8:00pm, many popular items (such as Prosciutto ham or Parmigiano cheese) were gone and not refilled. On the other hand, I found the men's bathrooms extremely dirty and they looked as if they hadn't been serviced for a while either. Finally, we were not surprised when our waiter came to drop the bill without any comments (not even asking whether we were done or wanted any desserts). No adjustments had been made, however at this point, we were happy to just leave this restaurant.While I'd like to believe that our dinner on New Year's Eve dinner a one-off exception, the indifferent attitude and the clumsy, atrocious service we received from staff and management alike rather suggests a pattern of poor leadership and/or lack of training at the New York location.",2,0,0,Tobias N.,"Issaquah, WA",3,6,17
5.0,1/4/2015,"Really, in a good Brazilian Steakhouse, it's all about the sweet plantains...    From the minute you walk in to the time you leave you are completely surrounded in elegance. As far as Brazilian Steak-houses are concerned, I think this is number one.  You are greeted very cordially by the receptionist at the front desk and if you are not waiting will immediately go downstairs to their beautiful restaurant. where you are met by a host or hostess who will bring you to your table.  If you have to wait, they have a big beautiful spacious bar on he main level.  The restaurant is beautifully lit, not to bright with a very pleasant atmosphere.  The incredibly high ceilings (remember, your down a level,) keep the noise level extremely low.)O.K. So, they start by bring you the ""cheesy breads,"" delicious, but do not fill up on these as there will be massive amounts of food to come.  They have a huge wine list and also cocktails, beer and wine by the glass.   The wine cellar is very unique as it is part of the wall between the two floors.  I tried to get a tour but apparently they are not available.  I thought the per glass charge was a little pricey but not outrageous.Go to the sad bar...  pick up a plate and start...   Tomatoes, mozzarella, asparagus, sun dried tomatoes, check pea salad, sliced salmon, cheeses, roasted peppers, spinach salad, Iceberg lettuce, bacon, and more, more, more...  Again take and enjoy but remember there is going to be a whole lot more to come.  What I really find as a nice touch is that the team is always looking for the dirty plates on the table so you're never sitting with dirty place when you finish and inevitably go for more...Now the meats...   Plenty to choose from and they knew my wife liked medium well to well so they would bring over to my table quickly before they got distributed to another take where they really did not not it so well cooked.  Some of the meats include: lamb, bacon wrapped filet, chorizo, ribs, chicken legs and toward the end of the seating, they bring out the lamb chops.... all of them were cooked perfectly and had plenty of flavor....  that's where Fogo excels, all there food is extremely flavorful and wonderfully prepared.   The sides include fried polenta, french fries, and a spicy mashed potato.   Now lets talk about the plantains....  They are PERFECT  (PERFECTLY PERFECT.) They're lightly fried and not breaded.  We can never get enough and luckily when they see an empty plate, the waiters bring new ones...  If they feel something was on the table too long, they bring a new one....  I can not speak about dessert since I have never left enough room to have it.  But... people tell me that the flan is to die for.On a scale of one to ten this restaurant is a SOLID TEN, but I only have five starts to work with so they get all five (plus the extra five in my head.)  Go, enjoy....",5,0,1,Joel H.,"Mineola, NY",382,388,2889

The food in the Midtown location was just as excellent as it normally is but the services wasn't what we've come to expect and love. We were here twice, once in September and once in December and had the misfortune of having the same server twice. The cheese bread is my absolute favorite but we had been seated for about thirty minutes and it hadn't come to the table yet. When I asked our server about it she casually said ""it's coming"" and then walked away. We finally got it, and since there are only four small rolls, it was gone in an instant. I had to hound my waiter again for it and also tried asking bus boys passing by to get another basket. The same was true for all the sides. It seemed like we had mounds to steak piling up on our plates but the sides were so scarce and I like to enjoy everything together. I'd rather not spend my dinner asking people repeatedly for the same thing, and for a restaurant with prices like the top tier steakhouses, we expect service to match and unfortunately, at this location it hasn't.As a side note: the gauchos are great and they always have wonderful service.

We sat there neglected for about 15 mins until out of frustration we literally grabbed a server by the arm and demanded attention.

The ambiance, food selection and overall presentation were great and I ceratinly walked away both impressed and quite full / satisfied.To start, their salad bar was awesome. Not only were there plenty of fresh vegetables, there was a nice selection of gourmet cheeses and cured meats. It was probably one of the best salad bars I have seen. For the meal itself...man oh man, so many delicious options brought right to your table side. My favorites were the lamb, bacon wrapped filet and the chorizo. The different meats were cooked perfectly and full of flavor.The only reason I can't give them a full 5 stars is because when the group I was with ordered our drinks they seemed to be out of every beer we tried to order and had to settle on a lesser alternative. Also while there was plenty of meat options, it seemed like some didn't come out as much / frequently as we hoped and service would get just a little bit slow at times.This was definitely a very worthwhile, delicious and fulfilling dinner in the Big Apple.

The salad bar is self-served where you can find many sorts of cheeses, salads, cured meats, and veggies to make yourself feel better on what is to come. I helped myself to just a small portion of potato salad (which by the way is fantastic) from the salad bar because I wanted to save myself for the meat. Once we got started, the meats came non-stop. My favorite two meats were the piranha and the alcatra HANDS DOWN! Soo orgasmically delicious. Every other meats were just okay in my opinion. The staff was sure to come around towards the end to make sure we had tried every meat we wanted to and if there were any that we wish more of. The service is excellent and very professional. We ordered pitchers of both red and white sangrias. The white sangria was too sweet and I am normally a sweet white sangria kind of girl. The red sangria was a little better. I would suggest skipping sangria altogether. For dessert, I tried bits of the tres leche cake, the signature papaya cream, and the molten chocolate cake. Go for the molten chocolate cake! The tres leche cake got unbearably sweet after a few bites and the signature papaya cream was just blah. In the end, we each paid about $110 after tax and tips.

If there is a specific cut of meat you would like, just tell the gauchos and they'll make sure it makes its way to you!Things to know:The picanha (spelling?) is amazing- perfectly seasoned, super flavorful, and very tender. It's no wonder it's their specialty/ most popular cut.The lamb chops are out of control. Do yourself a favor and make sure you get these. They don't make the rounds as often as other cuts, so be sure to ask if you have to. And ask for it medium rare. You're welcome.Even though the salad bar is full of really great and tasty things, don't be a rookie! Only grab a couple of things so you can focus on the real star- the meats! Guys, if you want to take your girl on a fancy, awesome, impressive date, I say go no further. This place gives you a serious bang for your buck... UNLESS!

The real star here is of course their grilled meats. The servers were great, they were constantly coming in and out with food every second, but you have to grab their attention, they don't necessarily go to every table. I had the fraldinha, picanha, filet mignon, lombo, linguica, frango, and polenta. Their frango is okay, the chicken wasn't really juicy, the lombo was eh as well, I think they're better at making beef because their filet mignon, picanha and fraldinha were great compared to the other meats. I liked the filet mignon best, the picanha was a little too fatty for me. I'm more of a tender meats kind of girl. As for desserts, I had a cheese cake sample platter that featured, strawberry cheese cake, caramel pecan, key lime and chocolate cake.

Cons:* Overall, I think that the quality and variety of the food at Fogo is good, but can be a LOT better (especially to match the price & upscale ambiance). The options served at the salad bar at Fogo de Chão is meager compared to, say, the bar at Churrascaria Plataforma- which serves many more hot dishes such as risottos and pastas.

What added even more to this was we came during Restaurant Week when the prices were much lower then normal - SO worth it that we will do it again next time the ""Week"" rolls around!",1,0,0,Vanessa M.,"New York, NY",137,662,1286

4.0,10/20/2014,"Back when I was in college in Philadelphia, Fogo de Chão was one of two Brazilian steakhouses in the city. Unfortunately, as it was also the more expensive of the two, I had never been able to visit, so it wasn't until they opened their first NYC location and started participating in Restaurant Week that I was finally able to go. After getting a reservation for six and confirming with five friends, we were set to visit this rodizio. The location is convenient for most in Midtown West and the venue consists of two floors: the bar and lobby on the ground level, and the actual restaurant in the lower level.Fogo has a pretty standard set up, comparable to most rodizio restaurants: Guests are offered a serve-yourself salad bar before starting with the churrascarias. The salad bar is far from ordinary, although it does consist of your standard greens, salad toppings, and dressings. There's also a variety of cured meats (prosciutto, salmon, salami, etc.) and cheeses as well as a tasty array of pre-made salads, which included my favorite apple and walnut salad. It's important not too fill up too much on this course, however, as to leave room for the star of the show: the churrasaria.Each guest is given a circular card that initially appears to be a coaster, but actually serves as an indicator that the diner is ready for the proteins; flip onto the green side to signal ""yes"" and flip onto the red side to signal ""no"". If all goes as planned, waiters will stop by the table bearing a variety of proteins on skewers to ask (if applicable) what cook on your meat you prefer. Fogo offers a dizzying number of options, so it's important to pick and choose wisely among the many selections. I'd advise against getting the Frango, or chicken, even though it's wrapped in bacon or the too dry Lombo, or pork loin. Instead, save up for the excellent Picanha and Alcatra (top sirloin cuts), Pork Ribs, and Cordeiro (leg of lamb). The latter proteins are gently seasoned, tender, and retain plenty of flavor in each cut.It's feasible for vegetarians and pescatarians to eat here, as they have a Salad Bar-only option, as well as a few seafood options daily as well. Regardless, Fogo is definitely better suited for the carnivores and omnivores, especially those with solid appetites.",15,3,9,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827

I had to flip my card to red so many times because the waiters came by often and with a different skewer each time! Although I wish I was able to eat every type of meat, my stomach capacity could not take it. But what I did try was just incredible, melt-in-your-mouth goodness.

4.0,10/6/2014,"I am not sure how a pescavegan ends up writing a review for a mainly meat place, but here goes nothing. And yes I am obviously only able to comment on the fish and veggie options here. Let's just say this place is swanky and very spacious. This is a chain and they have restaurants all over the US. I'm glad I put on a nice dress and some heels or else I would feel like I was under dressed. We made a reservation for 7 people for a friend's birthday. This place can hold many big parties, so not a bad option for BIG GROUPS. It took a few minutes for them to get us to a table, but we didn't mind. There is a nice bar on the first floor and the bartender was very on par with service, even asking if I needed some nuts to munch on since I immediately ordered up a dirty martini. The eating occurs downstairs. We got a nice circular table very close to the salad buffet bar. Five out of us got the meat plate. It is a flat price for $59 and you can eat all the meat and salad bar to your heart's content. There are chips on the table (one side is red and the other side is green). You place the green chip up when you want meat. It is basically like dim sum (where they come around with meats on skewers) and you get what you want. My friends said there was filet mignon, flank steak, pork, lamb, etc. And everyone raved about the meat, so I guess it was pretty good. They also bring out sides of polenta fries, mashed potatoes and plantains. I got the AYCE salad bar option, it was $29. And for that kind of money, not sure it was worth it. Nothing was exceptionally special at the salad bar buffet. The roasted eggplant, grilled asparagus, salmon, and quinoa salad were some of the things I ate. They had a good selection of cheeses and cured meats, but I didn't partake. Desserts were pretty good. I shared a chocolate molten cake with vanilla ice cream. Sweet and oh so guilty. For a party of 7, our bill came to about $570 including gratuity.

5.0,9/23/2014,"I don't have anything to complain about this restaurant. The food is astounding; from the wide variety of  on the salad bar, the cuts of meats, all the way to the desserts. From beginning to end it is obvious that there is a lot to choose from and you don't feel pressured at all. The salad bar is always clean and crisp, clearly being taken care of and attended for at all times. The wait staff is surprisingly good at communicating with one another. Anyone that passes by always pays attention to body movements, whether you need a clean plate or you have a question. There was never a time where I needed to ask for a refill on my drink, because the staff seemed to notice it before I did. The amount of meat that is available to me is astounding. It ranges from beef, to pork, to chicken, and surprisingly enough lamb. All the meats are juicy, and the wait staff communication is impressive. The meat servers remember your meat preference and you only have to say it one time. My favorite part of dinner is the end, where the dessert tray comes around and there's a visual on what I would like to get after being stuffed with pounds of protein. The server who presents the desserts is extremely friendly, excited, and is very thorough in explaining the desserts presented and flavors you can choose from. For the price you pay, you get unlimited salad, unlimited meat, and it couldn't be a better bargain. From food to service you won't be disappointed.",1,1,0,Tiffany Q.,"Houston, TX",300,35,15

Some of my friends got drinks that came in a whole pine Apple. I'm not sure how to say ponchucatu (the bread) when you sit down was delicious. Soft and chewy.   Once the meats come out you realize how great this dining experience really is. Cut after cut of beef are more tender an juicy than you could have hoped for.  Chicken, pork, sausage, and other following meat were no let downs.   Dessert was nothing special, but they were still good.   I could not believe how good all the food was.

4.0,9/23/2014,"I'm tempted to give it 3 stars because the ambience feels so touristy and the prices are pretty exorbitant, but I can't deny that the quality of the meal was still pretty darn impressive.A good friend of mine was in town, and while we were scoping out dinner options he noticed Fogo de Chão as he had been to their other locations in a few other cities and raved about them.  Our decision was made.First off, I hope you're a hardcore carnivore.  Otherwise, you're essentially paying $60 for a glorified salad bar, which actually does have plenty of great options, but isn't what you should be filling up on.Save your appetite for the all-you-can-eat roasted meats that come to your tableside non-stop.  Think Brazilian dim sum.  Beef rules all at Fogo (fillet, sirloin, etc.), and though I don't eat beef, I still had plenty of options.  Chicken, pork and lamb galore!  A few of them were a bit too salty for my taste, but overall the seasonings were great, and the meat cooked to perfection, whether you prefer medium, rare or whatever.  Lamb chops were probably my favorite, very juicy.  Chicken wrapped in bacon was also amazing, but then again, anything wrapped in bacon is probably amazing. Slight deduction as we felt gypped that the Brazilian soda (served in a can) is $4 and desserts are all $12 each.  There's no drink/dessert menu, they simply ask you what you want.  If we had known, we probably would have shared a dessert.  All in all it's a great meal, and you will not leave hungry that's for sure!",3,0,0,Ashwin M.,"New York, NY",134,264,73

On top of that you also get potstickers, plantenes, mash as sides.

After 20-25 mins we care to ask for it, and they forgot. We needed to provide the order again, as this was never sent to prep in the kitchen.

Some of them just melted in your mouth! The only downside was that a few of them were really salty. The bacon wrapped filet was really salty, not too impressed. The salad bar was good, but you would think for $60/person, they would have more options at the salad bar, but in all honesty, you don't come to these places to eat salad, its all about the MEAT! In general, very tasty, and for my 1st time trying lamb chops, I'm a fan! We had the key lime pie, creme brule, and turtle cheesecake for dessert. Creme brule was fabulous, cheesecake was good, a bit too sweet for me though, and the key lime pie was good, Also had some cappuccinos, those we also good, but tiny.

Boy was I wrong.    The first thing I found out was they have a truly wonderful system of service.  we made reservations for 7 pm and we were seated and served by 7.05 pm . and the place was packed. how you might ask? this is like no other restaurant I have ever been to.you are given a round card that is red on one side and green on the other. if you place the green side up.  you will be offered all kinds of different meats and cheeses. one by one about ten waiters will take turns coming to your table with a tray of different steaks chops cheeses etc. one will offer lamb chops the next will offer eye round steaks and so on.   need a break ? no problem. flip the card to red and the waiters will know that you don't want any more food or drink until you again flip the green side up. once you do the waiters will continue to bring you all kinds of delicious food and drinks.    this includes a salad bar with lots of cheeses meats and vegetables that is self serve. and you can serve yourself as often as you like.the price for all this is $59 per person for all you can eat .  the food is delicious. the lamb chops melt in your mouth. Every thing tasted great  out of the six different steaks I tried i found the eye round medium rare and. the lamb chops were my favorites  Not included in the package are drinks and deserts.  They have a huge selection of wines and other spirits.  My wife and I decided to get a glass bottle of diet coke instead which is reasonably priced at $3,50. after that we had dessert i had a nice slice of key lime pie  my wife had a large mountain of warm chocolate cake with ice cream. both of our desserts were $10 each we also had two cups of coffee and two glasses of water for free.    all in all this is by far the most enjoyable dining experience  we can remember so we tipped 22 percent and still paid under $200 .  This is also a very High class elegant steakhouse. we were told that the dress code is casual.but many diners were in suites  or suit jackets or at least wore collared shirts.

I was so obsessed with their cheesy bread that I asked if they are served at the bar or if I can purchase them for takeout (but sadly the answer was no)Yes, it is expensive.

4.0,8/13/2014,"I've been to Brazilian BBQ before, but this was definitely one of the better ones I've been to. Came here for restaurant week with my family to celebrate a birthday. The salad bar, as far as Brazilian BBQs go, was pretty good but nothing amazing. I did like that they had Kalamata-style olives, and my family appreciated the quinoa. They also had a huge bowl of bacon, which was kinda funny. Tucked on the side they had 3 hot dishes going-- one of which was black beans and another which was scalloped potatoes (I can't recall the third.)The servers and wait staff were all incredibly friendly, polite, charming, and helpful.  Although they did constantly come over and ask how everything was, our water glasses were left neglected-- thus the one star off. We resorted to putting our glasses at the end of the table, and it still took 20 minutes to get it filled. With so much seasoned food, this was kind of a drawback.The meats themselves were amazing. My favorite was the house special, the top sirloin I believe. It is a round circle-like cut and is oh my god amazing. The fat is perfectly rendered and melts in your mouth. The bottom sirloin was my second favorite. I highly recommend these two-- batch after batch, I kept going back.The pork sausage was mediocre, and the chicken (both bacon-wrapped and not) was actually really moist and great-- something that usually falls short at churrascarias that I've been to in the past. The lamb was only brought around once, and honestly it was a bit dry and not as rare as the others, so maybe it was just a bad batch. The parmesan pork was only brought over after an hour or so of sitting there, after all of us had finished.The restaurant week deal also included a dessert: a choice of key-lime pie, cheesecake, or chocolate mousse. I got the cheesecake and it was decent, definitely better than I was expecting.Overall, for restaurant week it was a great deal. I'd be happy to return!",0,0,0,Sherry H.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,41,1

Come with an empty stomach or else you won't get your money's worth!A couple of friends and I made a reservation for restaurant week. $38 dollars all you can eat meat? Count me in! Their salad bar is great with many selections. I really enjoyed their quinoa, asparagus, peppers, eggplant, and green beans. What I also loved is their cheese balls! Actually I think they are called cheese bread (the round bread at your table). After I found out it was gluten-free, I had about 5 of them...whoops! They also bring out some side dishes to your table, but my favorite one was the mashed potatoes!Now to the MEAT! I loved the chicken leg (very juicy and flavorful), the ribs, lamb, either the top or bottom sirloin, and the garlic steak! Pretty much everything was good, but the chicken wrapped in bacon was a bit dry and some meats (the outside pieces) were a bit too salty for my taste.Great food and excellent service!

The lamb was good and I'm not a fan of lamb.The cheesy bread was amazing but don't over eat the sides because there's plenty of meat!The only negative was I asked the waiter who took our drink order that it was my BF's birthday so I asked if they can put ""happy birthday"" on the plate of the cheesecake. I guess they were super busy and I also noticed we never had just one waiter - that they forgot and we got a plain cheesecake with no writing.

4.0,8/12/2014,"I love meat, and steakhouses, so when i saw Fogo de Chao on the RW list, I knew I had to come here! Came here for Restaurant Week dinner with my boyfriend. The entrance is a bit nondescript, and we both almost missed it as we were walking down 53rd St. Upon arrival, they lost/couldn't find our reservation. However, they were still able to seat us, so that worked out. The restaurant looks pretty huge, with a lot of tables laid out. As part of the RW menu, we were only given about 8 different options for meats (whereas the regular menu had about 12 options), which was still plenty of food. They do give you a coaster to signal if you want food or not (red means stop, green means go!). The gauchos ask how you want the meat cooked, and it seemed like they mainly had medium rare or well done. I had requested the lamb be medium, and he said he was going to come back, but he never did (sad face). However, I was able to try my boyfriend's piece, and it was super delicious.All the meats we tried were pretty tasty, but my favorites were the beef. They meat is pretty free flowing. They also have an unlimited salad bar (which I skipped out on, more room for meat please!), and 3 appetizers: fried banana/plantains, which were delicious, polenta, and mashed potatoes. They also had a basket of cheesy bread, which my boyfriend and I both loved. More of that too, please!We were pretty stuffed at the end of the meal, but made sure to make room for dessert. I had the cheesecake, while my boyfriend had the chocolate mousse. They were decent, although like another reviewer said, it would have been better with a sauce. $38 per person for the RW menu.  The restaurant does try to be a little fancier than you expect (our server busted out the crumb knife as he was cleaning our table), but overall a good experience.

5.0,8/12/2014,"Came for Restaurant Week! I called in 15 minutes before arrival, and even though I didn't have a reservation, they had a table waiting for my group of 7 once we arrived. All the meat was great! I love how you can specify how you like your meat (I like mine rare), and the server will just cut from a different part of the meat. Don't be afraid to ask for a bigger or smaller portion; they'll happily oblige. The appetizers were good too, especially the polenta fries and the bread. The salad bar didn't have as much variety as the one in Vegas, but it was still a nice respite from all that meat. As part of RW, we each got to choose a dessert (chocolate cake, key lime pie, or cheesecake). I tried the key lime pie, while everyone else got the chocolate cake. The key lime pie was good, but the taste of the chocolate cake I got was awesome. The only negative thing is that there would be periods when none of us had anything on our plates, but no meat was coming out. I actually kinda liked it, since it helped me pace myself, but if you're coming here to get super stuffed then it might take longer than usual haha.

5.0,8/9/2014,"Let me just get this out of the way really quickly: I ate here for restaurant week, and it turned out to be one of the best meals I can remember.Now my reservation was for lunch, 11:30ish, but that didn't stop people from packing the place full. I guess on the closing end of restaurant week, everyone wanted a chance to try it. The staff kept up admirably though - it took a few to get us seated, but after that, they were on point the entire meal.So let's talk salad bar. Being the red-blooded, meat-eating, hippie-hating American that I am, I gave a lot more attention to the meats and cheeses (prosciutto, salmon, swiss cheese, some cheese I can't remember, you get the idea) than I did to the fresh produce and beans, but the options were incredible, and they all looked fantastic.But you don't come here for the salad bar. You come here for the carnivorous carnival that is the many offerings of varied meats. The bacon-wrapped chicken might have been my favorite, but pretty much everything was excellent. My only gripe was that my parmesean steak had quite a bit of grizzle to it, but when I tried a second piece, it was excellent.My advice: Pace yourself. The offers of meat come fast, and if you say yes to every single one immediately, you'll either choke or eat yourself sick. Take your time, savor the flavors. I hope you like your meat on the rarer side though, since I didn't really see anything over medium. Of course, if you're getting steak cooked past medium, you're probably a bad person.Oh, and last thing - the chocolate mousse cake and key lime pie were both excellent! The slices were small and light, which was perfect after the giant lunch. It kept me full right through the day.",10,7,4,Sean E.,"Centerport, NY",201,246,132
4.0,8/9/2014,Steaks are absolutely delicious but pretty salty (you wont recognize it until you see yourself drinking bottles of water after 2-3hrs.

3.0,8/9/2014,"Came here for Restaurant Week dinner.  Overall, the service is friendly, but incredibly slow and inefficient.  If you get a side table, be prepared to have to active track down servers for cuts of meat and even for water.  Food is good, but I  don't know if I would pay the standard $60 for dinner... I came here with a large group of friends.  We had an 8pm reservation for 8 people and when I called to make it larger, I was informed that due to restaurant week, they could not allow for a larger reservation. Boo :(We all ordered the RW menu (you could also have the option of ordering from the full menu), which is slightly limited (no filet mignon) but a good deal at $38pp.  The salad bar had a nice variety of things to pick from.  Smoked salmon, proscuitto, hearts of palm, asparagus, quinoa salad with edamame, grilled eggplant, manchego cheese, and some large balls of mozzarella? Burrata? Among other things.Once we were ready for the meat, service wasn't very attentive.  We had to actively try to flag down servers and sometimes as the bus boys to send certain things over to us, since we kept getting chicken and sausage, but we wanted ribs or lamb.  We were brought hot side dishes, which included fried bananas (love! also they were more caramelized than crispy, but very tasty nonetheless), crispy polenta (pretty salty), and garlic mashed potatoes (not that garlicky).  There are also these very light and fluffy cheese popovers, which were very light in cheese flavor.  I really liked them, and I don't like cheese.  On the other hand, my husband the cheese lover thought that they were too mild.  Almost everyone at the table enjoyed them though.I LOVED the ribs and I really liked the lamb.  Most of the cuts of meat were fairly rare, but you could ask for sections / pieces that were more well done.  The garlicky sausage was also quite tasty.  I wasn't as fond of the different cuts of sirloin.Dessert was okay. We were given a choice of 3 options.  The chocolate mousse cake was the best, although it was very generic, like supermarket chocolate cake.  The cheesecake was heavy and too sweet.  The key lime pie was warm (which makes it decidedly less apppetizing) and very tart.We left feeling very VERY full, and generally happy with our meal, but we all agreed that it was annoying to continuously have to try to flag down meat servers who were ignoring us.  We also had to ask for water several times when our glasses weren't being refilled, and then we had to wait quite a while for someone to bring us the check too.",1,0,0,Ann D.,"Renton, WA",147,321,247
4.0,8/9/2014,Most people are familiar with the churrascaria approach.  A green puck says feed me and red says stop and thus reduces the consumption of red meat to its most binary state possible with the fewest trappings of interaction possible.  The setting is large and densely packed.  Meat ain't cheap nor is being MoMA's neighbor.  Service is more efficient than passionate.  I note that upstairs has a bar with its own menu and a nice mix of desserts and snacks for those looking for a cool place to meet up.,0,0,0,Bob B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,129,0

4.0,8/8/2014,"Among the long list of things I don't enjoy are Restaurant Week and all you can eat buffets. For me, both are just not worth it-- so it's ironic that it was Restaurant Week that convinced me to make a reservation at Fogo de Chao. But how can you blame me? Normally priced at $60, dinner is now $38. Everything from the normal menu, except for the lamb chops & filet mignon, are included. The meats exceeded my expectations, and there were lots of options. I tried them all! They were all juicy, flavorful, and well-seasoned. I requested rare cuts and was actually given rare cuts. The leg of lamb was stand out, and was the only meat that I requested seconds (ok, thirds) of!The sides are refilled as often as you please. That Cheesy Bread is borderline magical; the Crispy Polenta, Sweet Plantains, and Mashed Potatoes are dangerous. And while you may think you're wasting valuable stomach estate on plants by visiting the salad bar, you're not. Breaking up the protein-fest with fresh, roasted, and pickled veggies actually sustained our marathon meal. And marathon it was! We didn't permanently turn our cards over to the red side until 2.5 hours later, and we never felt rushed to leave.But wait, there's more! Dessert was also included, and we decided on the Chocolate Mousse Cake and Key Lime Pie. Even though I told myself I wouldn't over eat... I couldn't help it when these came out!And now...

Did not touch a single sausage offered in order to save tummy space for my favorite house steak, garlic beef sirloin and cheese encrusted pork. I recommend you do the same in terms of gorging strategy. The sausages aren't gonna change your life, so let them pass by.High ceilings and accessible location definitely beats Fogo de Chao's San Antonio and Vegas locations, although I strangely remember Vegas location's salad bar spread to be more impressive.

Instead, pace yourself and enjoy a very attentive staff and very decent steak.  The meat served for the restaurant week goers ranges from incredibly tender to a bit overdone and chewy- what you get is kind of luck of draw, so keep an eye out for waitstaff carrying fresh-out-of-the-oven, not overdone selections.  The medium-rare, hot carvings are incredibly delicious.  Our favorites were the garlic steak (yes, it's literally slathered in garlic butter) and the picanha.Only con was that their restaurant week menu does not include a gluten-free dessert (celiac in the party), and staff seemed a little annoyed that we were asking in the first place.",3,0,0,Jessie K.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,15,0

I am still feeling it almost a day later. As such, I don't think I will go back because I'd probably die of overeating.  I came for restaurant week, which apparently only gets you a few of the meats (not their top line filet or other stuff...but seriously if I had more meat, I would have probably exploded).  From $58 to $38 you get:-complimentary pao de quejo bread which was cheesy and oily but not as bready? I've had better but this was ok.- the unlimited salad bar. It's a mixture of standard stuff- greens, tomatoes, good asparagus, etc but also more South American tropical items like heart of palm, grilled eggplant (very good), strawberry salad, and an assortment of cured meats like really top line prosciutto (normally I don't like prosciutto), bacon, salami, and manchego, swiss and parm cheese.  You fill up just on this. -flip those cards up on green and get swarmed with meat, meat. meat. We tasted the roasted chicken leg (bf said it was dry but I thought it was crispy), chicken breast wrapped with bacon (good), top sirloin (nicely seasoned and crispy), bottom sirloin (also good, asked for a rarer piece- for the beef, you can get medium or medium rare since I guess all of the meats don't roast evenly on the pit), leg of lamb (I normally don't like lamb but this was well seasoned and not gamey or rubbery at all), pork sausage (salty, good), and pork rib (very good and charred).   TOO. MUCH. MEAT.  (toward the end, they will ask if what you're specifically looking for which is nice- lots of people on the floor)-you get the starch sides of fried banana (like maduros, carmelized and deliciously good), fried polenta (strong in polenta taste but kind of just fried whatever), and mashed potatoes (our least favorite, a bit bland). You can get a side of scalloped potato (cheesy), white rice (standard) and black bean (pretty flavorful and I don't even like these). -As for dessert, thankfully, they gave me a small portion of my requested key lime pie. It had a lot of cream on it but tasted like the usual tart/sweet key lime pie. Bf had the cheesecake (it was a little dense). I'm sure they don't make the desserts in house.. so whatevs-We had a bottle of the Trapche Oak Cask Malbec ($42 a bottle) which was acidic more than full bodied but still fruity.

1.0,8/1/2014,"Big mistakeSo, my wife and I frequent this restaurant quite often mainly because the meat is cooked tastefully, lots of food varieties and with mediocre service. However I never thought that we would be offered such subpar service at a restaurant in a busy nyc area where people are paying over $160 for two each evening. This was a monday night.  After we were seated, 5 mins passed and we were not greeted at the table until one passing waiter saw our faces and decided to ask if we wanted something? (Mind you, we never saw this waiter again for the rest of the evening). We ordered our drinks and got up to the dinner buffet for salads, bread, rice and beans. To our surprise, over 10 spots were left empty as we waited around for bread and veggies to be replenished, which never happened until we decided to complain after visiting the buffet 4 times. Once we sat down with our food, we waited not less than 20 minutes until we finally were able to get a waiters attention. We asked for the manager and the waiter stood staring as it was out of the norm. The manager then came 10mins later and we expressed how we are loyal guests and continue our loyalty due to multiple reasons, one of which we thought was their service. We mentioned that we had not received any service all evening, no one bothered to ask if our meals were pleasant or if we needed anything else (which we needed straws) and items were not replaced on the bar after waiting for awhile. She stated, I will talk to my staff, brought a saucer of bread and walked away. When it was time for us to begin our meat service, we waited around for our three dishes: plantains corn meal and mashed potatoes. We were told, the mashed potatoes were coming, and they are still coming but somehow never made it to our table all night. Again we had to get some passerby waiter to get us another drink. As for the meats, we waited around 10 mins each time after a guy stopped to give us some meat until another came around with the same thing. After mentioning the way we liked our meat cooked, no one bothered to even come once to our table with varieties, instead meat close to being raw and bloody was brought to us, the same cuts. We walked out very unhappy and will not be giving our business to this fogo de chao again mainly because after we repeatedly, and politely expressed our concerns, we were not waited on properly and items were overlooked just because we were not a party of 5 or more. It is not my concern that they were busy. They were not up to full capacity, yet were not able to wait on a table of two for petty things like food items straws mashed potatoes and drinks, all which were reasonable requests. Id prefer to go to another steakhouse that appreciates my loyalty instead of just saying they will talk to their staff! I would not recommend this location on 53rd st to anyone who is looking for any sort of proper service or the bare essentials on the food bar.

As to the steak, generally excellent.  The best was the sirloin.  The garlic was very good, but could not seem to get it rare or medium rare.  Excellent lamb chops, but a bit overseasoned.   Super salad bar (even had salmon).  Excellent sides.  Nice warm bread (seemed like a cheese puff).  The service is very good and they are eager to please.  Desserts are pretty good too.Worth a trip, but come hungry.",1,0,0,Randall S.,"Manhattan, NY",837,109,13
4.0,7/24/2014,"I went with a couple of coworkers for Restaurant Week Lunch.  This is a great choice for $25.  Lunch or dinner you get the same food so why not pay less at lunch time?  If you don't choose the restaurant week option, there is also a $38 lunch option which includes filet mignon, rib-eye and lamb chops.  We stuck to the restaurant week menu because there is more than enough meat to satisfy us.When we walked in, we thought the bar area was beautiful.  Then we walked down the stairs and it was just as beautiful in the dining area.  We felt that the staff was very attentive from the moment we walked in.  The salad bar was very impressive.  Such a wide variety of food.  Everything was so fresh and delicious.  In addition to some smoked/cured meats, there was also smoked salmon.Now we are ready for some meat! I love how they had three chunks of meat on one skewer.  They were each cooked to different temperatures...well, medium, medium rare.  Just so happens that our table all had different tastes and this was great.  Our favorites were the chicken drumstick and garlic steak.  One coworker really enjoyed the sausage and the other coworker really enjoyed the lamb.  The only thing that we all didn't enjoy was the chicken wrapped in bacon.  This was breast meat which was a little try.  I think they used Canadian bacon or something of that nature.  Maybe after eating a juicy drumstick, the breast meat just didn't impress.  The meal also came with mashed potatoes, fried polenta and sweet plantains.  I wasn't a big fan of the polenta but the other two sides were good.  At some point a manager came over to see if there was anything in particular that we are still waiting to try and we hadn't gotten the lamb yet.  She had someone come right over with it.  That was very nice.  Of course it wouldn't be restaurant week without dessert.  You had a choice of NY style cheesecake, Key lime pie and chocolate mousse cake.  I had the key lime pie.  It was a little too sweet but I ate it anyway!  They give a sliver and it was not presented nicely at all.  Just a thin slice laying on a plate.  But honestly, we didn't care because we were stuffed but managed to eat some dessert anyway.  The meats are the star of the show at this restaurant.",5,0,1,Arlene Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,54,51

Very different from Plataforma, for example, where there are dozens of them offering various cuts of meat.Buffet much inferior to Plataforma again, with a much more limited choice, and especially no shrimp or maki rolls.When we first sat down (3 people), before we started eating, the manager came and offered to buy us the first drink if we moved to another table so they could seat 5 people. I ordered one glass of wine, not the most expensive one, but sure enough, at the end of the meal, I had to ask the waiter as the drink was on the tab...For the same price, Plataforma is a much better choice.

5.0,7/1/2014,"In a sea of Brazilian churrascaria restaurants, where they carve the meat off swords at your table until your eyes pop out, this chain is by far the best, beating Texas De Brazil hands down.  The service is first class, their sides are tempting enough to fill you up before the star of the show, the meat, but try to avoid them. This one is massive, in a beautiful sub-street space with elegant wood walls and exceptional decor. They have a bar on ground floor and the restaurant below.

4.0,6/27/2014,"Quick overview : -Pros: delicious and authentic rodizio experience, friendly gauchos (waiters), good bang for your buck-Cons: relatively high concentration of tourists, poor reservations/patron inflow systemDetails on each:Pros: -SALAD BAR -  The highlights are the palmito (heart of palm, looks like fat white asparagus cuts), shitake mushrooms (large and flavorful), and the feijoado (rice and beans). I know some may say it's a waste of valuable stomach space to fill up on veggies and carbs at an all-you-can-eat steakhouse, but I've done this a few times, and personally, I've found that you have to play the long game - over the course of a few hours, my body is able to take in a lot more meat if I've given it a bit of variety/balance with the other food groups as well.  -MEATS - The quality of the meat is fantastic. That means that most cuts have just some salt on them and the flavor/quality of the meat will speak for itself. The highlights here are the house specialty (picanha), filet mignon, and the garlic sirloin. Less awesome ones were the ribs and the chicken (still good, but ration that stomach space!). If it's your first time here, I recommend asking for a small piece of everything that comes through the first time, hone in on your favorites, and load up on those the 2nd, 3rd, and yes, 4th, times that they come around. You can flag down gauchos to inquire about a specific cut if you haven't seen it circulating the room in a while. -SERVICE -  Flawless. Friendly, prompt, responsive. Couldn't ask for anything more or anything less. This is what service is supposed to be about - helping you enjoy your meal more without overpowering the experience. -COST - I think dinner was $60pp. Yes, I know, it's not the cheapest place to eat steak. But, I think for the variety, quality, and sheer quantity of what you get, there's not a better deal, especially in NYC. Cons:-LOTS OF TOURISTS - I actually don't mind tourists , but for people who do, I'll flag this for you. I would say on a Saturday night, at least half of the people there looked like they were from out-of-town (don't pretend like you can't recognize them immediately). -CROWD CONTROL - Made reservations for 8pm, seated at 845pm. No one apologized. What's the point of taking reservations if you blow right through them? Management should probably rethink the time they allot to each table. I would not have minded accepting a later reservation if it meant I would wait for less time. Also, this meant that you could see hunks of delicious steak circling the room, only to be all gone by the time it reached you :( This happened to us a few times, though we eventually got all the cuts we wanted. This might be purposeful/never change though, since I think it's in the restaurant's economic interest to make you eat slowly so your body gets full. OVERALL: I would (and probably will) go again, but only on a weeknight when it's probably less crowded.Random tip: wear something with some stretch. The dress code is not that formal here so for girls, i would suggest a loose skirt with some elastic in it, and guys, looser pants with an adjustable belt.",8,5,0,Viv M.,"New York, NY",195,105,17

The meats here were cooked to perfection and the seasoning was spot on.  I am a purist and feel that if a steak is perfectly cooked and seasoned no sauces are necessary.Considering that in most steakhouses in the city would cost you the same price for one cut of meat here you get to have several for the same price.The Brazilian drinks were also very good.  I particularly enjoyed the passion fruit one. The wait staff was very friendly and helpful.Now why I deducted a star.  While eating I noticed other tables having some specialty drinks and asked the waitress what they were.  She said they were specials for the week.  That's all nice, but It would have been nice to be told about them in the beginning, instead of me having to ask.  I did order one and it was delicious.Overall great experience, will be back .",1,0,0,Dmitry R.,"Forest Hills, NY",22,139,54

2.0,6/11/2014,"Note: Yelp deleted my first review, so this a repost.I had some drinks here last night (6/10/14). This place has great ambiance, and the multilevel structure is nice on the eyes.That said, I am filing a 2 star review because of the food and drink problems. One caveat: I ordered from the bar menu, so I don't expect the quality to be as high as the regular menu.Food: I chose the ""filet mignon."" It came back looking like two under cooked hamburger patties. I wish I had taken a picture to illustrate this ghastly situation. As far as I know, filet mignon is one round piece of steak, not two burgers that look like they were prepared in the cafeteria at IKEA. It was frankly quite unappetizing. Moreover, it was $20! If I am going to pay $20 for a mini-filet mignon, I at least want it to look, taste, and be cooked like a filet mignon. Speaking of the cooking, they asked me when I ordered to specify how I wanted it cooked. I said medium. Whether it was really cooked medium or not is essentially moot, as a one inch thickness in a steak can sort of be cooked in any way and you can't really tell.Drinks: Not as big of a problem here, although they did not have in stock my first three choices.

5.0,5/23/2014,"I had referred a friend for a job and they had actually made him an offer and he had accepted so we came here for dinner to celebrate.This place is really family and kid-friendly.  No one would look out of place here.  It has a nice Vegas buffet feel (like Bellagio level) but even more upscale.  Dress ranges from casual to business professional and less of the going out party look.  The interior decor is trendy-looking and beautiful, but without the loud music or the obnoxious crowd.  I love the way they have their wine display set-up.  It is artistic and functional at the same time.  The space is just artsy, whimsy and spacious.I'd never been to a Brazilian BBQ place before, but now that I have gone, I would definitely recommend to people when they have out-of-town guests and are looking for somewhere unique to take them.  There is an unlimited buffet salad bar and they bring you cheese potatoes, bread and banana plantains for your table, but the key is this little disk that everyone gets.  If you flip it green (""go""), waiters pop up out of nowhere and keep offering you meat non-stop.  They ask how you want your meat and some sides of the meat from which they cut are medium rare, some are medium, some are medium well, etc . . . And they keep bringing you meat until you flip the disk red (""stop"").  You keep flipping back and forth until you really are done.  It is just fun all-around.  I think we ended up trying everything and it was all good.  Some  cuts I found a bit salty, but I kinda do everywhere.  None of the meats were too exotic and I was able to eat everything.I had enough to feel sated, but not full.  I think most people would eat till they are bloated in this kind of situation, but I was really there more for the experience.  After all the meat, they bring around a hard liquor cart which looked like a candy cart really just with alcohol.  And then they bring around the dessert menu (which is not included in the price of the all you can eat meat fest) but you end up kinda wanting to end your meal with something sweet.  I would recommend trying one of the exotic Brazilian desserts.  Mainly because you can have the standard creme brulee, molten chocolate cake or cheesecake anywhere.  We ended up settling on the pineapple caramel ice cream dessert which was warm, different and delicious.This was hands down one of the funnest dinners I have had in New York.  I'd gone in kinda expecting pig over a spitfire smelly meat fest with men beating their chests (j/k), but it was actually quite a genteel and civilized dinner experience.  It was almost surprisingly like fine dining.  Service was attentive and the waiters always helpful and polite even if we did have to get up to go get our own salads.  ;P",1,0,0,Christine N.,"Manhattan, NY",138,374,294

4.0,5/21/2014,"**BAR/BAR FOOD REVIEW*I hosted a company event here for about 20 people upstairs in the bar area.  Plenty of space and seating on the weekdays to go around.  It never got crowded... pretty quiet all night.  The space is quite nice, as this is pretty much still a brand new establishment.  One thing though - its FREEZING upstairs - bring a coat or you'll catch a cold or something.Since I basically had no budget, I was able to order a plethora of things from the bar menu (sadly, just the bar menu, no dinner here).I pretty much ordered everything off the bar menu, so here's what was memorable:- Grilled shrimp skewers were pretty much still cold and RAW the first time they came out.  I had to send them back.  If you've never had raw shrimp, I don't recommend it.- Rib eye - delicious, if it comes out the correct temperature that you ordered.  I would recommend this over the filet mignon.- Shrimp cocktail - pricey, but these things are massive and delicious.  The spicy cocktail sauce is one of the best I've had.- Flan - amazing.- Creme brûlée - also amazing.Service was great - at first I thought our bartender hated us, but he was actually very friendly and invited me back anytime.  Definitely a great place if you're looking to host a company or friendly happy hour.",1,0,0,Allene T.,"Manhattan, NY",2170,1311,3573

4.0,5/13/2014,"Fogo de Chao is the best place to have a large dinner party in the city. Came here with a party of 17 co-workers with only making a reservation 1-week in advance. The only hiccup is that want everyone in the party to be seated at once so we enjoyed some drinks at the bar upstairs for about 30-min until all 17 arrived.We all really enjoyed the self-serve buffet setup which had tons of great options. For most of the evening i made myself steak salads which was great! The meat is seriously never ending, but the only downside is after a while, they keep on bringing around the same types. I think they may rotate what they cook every few hours as when we first got there they had a different set of meat selections (during the busier time) whereas towards the second half of the dinner we saw some of the more basic meats coming around. I think in total I only tried about 3-4 different types of meat, of which 2 I actually really liked. If you are worried about the price, $60 is a very good deal for the quality of service and ample amount of food.

The pao de queijo isn't as good as Rayuela's or Union Sq Coffee Shop's but it was good nonetheless. The salad bar is also good. The plantain and the polenta appetizers were decent. The biggest thing that is missing here is fruits or more importantly, grilled fruits (imagining pineapple). That would just be the best thing here - acidic fruit to offset the fattiness of all the meat. I could barely eat more than a couple plates of meat.

4.0,5/5/2014,"I've been wanting to try a Fogo de Chao establishment for awhile now but just never had the chance. So my friends and I planned and traveled to NYC to try it out. We went around dinnertime Saturday. I was very surprised that we were able to walk in without a reservation needed and the host led us to our table right away. The inside is beautiful, modern, very airy. Love the display of the wine upstairs. I really like the lights dimly lit in these types of restaurants, makes the atmosphere more romantic and relaxing. The salad bar has more than just salads, so many sides that you can eat accompanying your meats. Smoked salmon was a hit, a worthy try. I really enjoyed the apple salad as well as the fresh strawberry salad with cheese sprinkled on top.The filet mignon and lamb cuts were da bomb! The ultimate stars of the show. Filet mignon was so tender and melt in your mouth. Get it at medium rare and you're good to go! It was the perfect color. Lamb was very delicious as well, ya can't go wrong with three cuts of lamb: lamb ribs, leg of lamb, and I can't remember the third at that moment! Well, can you blame me? I was in a meat coma.

This is one spacious spot. Walk in and check your coat if you want, have a drink at the bar or just head on down when they're ready and get seated. Staff is professional, nice and efficient (love this). Good food + great service is ALWAYS a win.Tables are not sitting on top of one another so you get your space, plus it makes it easier for the meat to speedily arrive and be sliced off onto your plate. The salad buffet is nice, has the usuals you'd expect and some nice touches like the entire wheel of parmigiana reggiano that is being slowly chiseled for your consumption. There's also a nice big bowl of super crisp bacon whch i unfortunatly couldnt partake in since i gave it up for lent *sigh* but everyone else at my table got some...We all tried something but we all knew to leave room for the main act, seriously tasty, quality cuts of grilled to perfection meat. Tell them how you like your meat cooked and they'll slice off just the right juicy piece for you. MMM MMM MMMNOTE: i like my meat med rare.*sirloin: yum*rib eye: my fave by far all night. so very very tasty and tender.*top sirloin: tasty*lamb: tasty with just the right amount of gaminess you'd expect. tender as well*parmesan crusted pork loin: awesome flavor but i found it a little dry. Quite salty due to the crust but it made it stand out from the other cuts*fogo steak: i wasn't given a med rare piece, it was really the last chunk on the sword so this was overcooked for me and a bit tough plus an 1 inch chunk at the end was just fat. i like marbling but a super thick chunk was too much, that just got trimmed off. this was my least favorite.Still sad I didnt get to try the bacon wrapped chicken or the bacon wrapped filet mignon but that'll be for next time!!!Despite all this food, i made sure i had room for dessert :) tried the tres leche and this was very creamy and rich and sweet. It was good but too much caramel flavor for my taste. there was more cream rather than cake so that overpowered it.Ah yes, we also did get drinks! *Superfruit lemonade: tastes like juice but u know there's a kick comin!*Moscato: sparkling red which looks like rose. sweet bubblyThey also have a fancy drink cart they wheel around the dining room for those in the mood for just liquor.Great time here.

5.0,4/2/2014,"Went to Fogo for a networking event.  It's a brazilian steakhouse, known as a churrascaria,  that is in fact a chain.  However, it is a chain that I can't believe that finally came to NYC. This location only opened recently, with the first location in the US opening in my hometown, Dallas, Texas, 15 years ago.  After visiting the Dallas location with my family, and later experiencing the not-so-good experience at another New York similar type restaurant Churrascaria Plataforma, it's about time Fogo de Chao arrived to New York.  While again only there for a networking event, their signature drink, the caipirinha (made primarily with a Brazilian pure rum called cachaça, pure sugar, and lime) is delicious.  Also had the opportunity to try the filet mignon, ribeye, shrimp, and various croquettes with catfish and cod.  All were absolutely decadent, especially the filet and ribeye.  Decor / ambience fits and is very modern yet sets the mood.  It's a large restaurant but not overly crowded nor too loud.  The bartenders were accommodating and specifically the bartender Emmanuel makes a great margarita.If you've never been to a Brazilian steakhouse, here are your need-to-knows:-their specialty is red meat-for this location, $40 lunch, $60 dinner-you have a disc on your table, green means bring me food, red means stop bringing me food already! (you can always go back to green after you take a break) -they will keep bringing you various meats unto your hearts desire-your meal includes a salad bar, but no drinks, taxes, or gratuities - so keep that in mindThe meats at Fogo are so flavorful - trust me, you will leave so full you won't know what to do with yourself.  Come hungry.

I had the strawberry caprihanna-a traditional Brazilian drink (except I got mine with Vodka instead of the traditional Cachaca Brazilian liquor). The strawberries were so fresh and bursting with flavor, as if the bartender had just picked the strawberries himself. The drinks were not cheap...$15 a pop but well worth it.We were seated downstairs and got started immediately. I limited myself at the salad bar (must save room in belly for meat), but I did have some fresh cheeses and crispy bacon. At the table was a basket of addicting cheesy bread. We got right to work after that...bring on the meat. I tried at least 1 of everything. I'm definitely no meat fiend, but I do know good meat when I taste it. By far, my favorite was the Picanha (top sirloin). Everything was really seasoned and cooked to perfection. Our waiter also brought over some sides-polenta fries (I'm not usually a fan of polenta but these were so crispy and tasty), fried bananas, and mashed potatoes.Somehow, we made room for dessert.

Our waiter seemed to think we weren't worth paying attention to. We are a young interacial couple. Both of us have waited tables before and know how to tip well. It's disappointing when we go out and are stereotyped. Besides the service everything was great. We ordered the tres leches for dessert & everyone kept telling us ""it just came in""... This eventually led to is realizing that it comes frozen. Ours was still hard in the middle. Not the best tres leches. It should be fresh.",0,0,0,Shannon S.,"Manhattan, NY",4,71,10
4.0,2/24/2014,"I must say if they didn't forget to give me their ""famous"" cheese bread, it was possible they could have had a perfect rating :)So I came here for one of my boyfriend's friend's birthday dinner. We arrived an half an hour early to bat traffic and to grab a drink before dinner starts. This is my first Brazilian dining experience. Service: They have amazing service. We were the firsts from the party to check in, we hung out at the bar for a bit. The bartender was super nice and gave us a brief intro to the restaurant since they have locations on the east and west coast, but started in Brazil. I like how the bartender was attentive to everyone who came by. That's the bartender you want when your glass is empty. When we got seated, the people on our table flip to the side that is green, there was a meat cutter waiting for you to take a piece of their delicious meats. But then another waiter had toflip it all back to red becuase we didnt have plates yet. I love how you don't have to wait for anything to order. If you like the product, you just take it!Food: We started our meal at the salad bar. I love how fresh everything is! The fact that they had prosciutto at the salad bar made my day! After we got a few things at the salad bar, the feasting begins. It felt like a meat rush hour at the dinner table because once you flip to the green.side.of the card, it was a swarm.of.meat cutters.waiting to plate you their cuts.  I love medium rare! There was a few cuts that I enjoy as much because it was bot overdone. I enjoyed the sirloin, pork,sausage. filet mignon, chicken leg, lamb shank, and ribeye. But overall, I was pretty happy with the selections.Ambiance:Gorgeous restaurant ! It was so spacious in there. It was modern design with a romantic feel to it.

4.0,2/24/2014,"Brazilian Steakhouse...need I say more? Well, the answer is YES! First off, some people tend to associate an 'all you can eat' joint with mediocre food quality and service. But this place can change those misconstrued perceptions.Came here for my friend's birthday dinner and not only was it a treat for her, but for us also!Decor: Spacious modern design with a Gigantic ~30 foot engraved portrait of a gaucho (Brazilian Cowboy) hung on the wall. Three floors setup with downstairs as the main dining room, and bar on the main and upper level. Service: Greeted by two lovely ladies with a bright welcoming smile. Knowledgeable bartender (that's where I got the word gaucho from) entertained me with the history of the restaurant (not included in this review, visit them and speak with Alex). Wait staff were also consistently attentive, polite, and on point. Food: Plentiful choices at their fresh salad bar. I got prosciutto,  asparagus, crispy crunchy bacon, salami, and kale. (Try not to fill yourself up too much with all the options at the salad bar, as i strongly recommend the 2 minute wait for the meat to start coming is definitely worth your patience.) Quality of the meat was spectacular and shockingly surprising as each cut  were delivered at a reasonably accurate degree of how [well, medium, rare, & your in betweens] you preferred it to be cooked when given the option (e.g., couldn't choose for the Frango- bacon wrapped chicken) while keeping in mind that its an 'all you can eat' setup and that the food is constantly being pumped out and served. The Filet Mignon, Alcatra (top sirloin), Beef Ancho (rib eye) to name a few, were all well seasoned lightly and the true flavor, level of tenderness and juciness of each cut really stood out. And yes, some pieces just melted in your mouth.Barely left any room for desert. (Forgot to pace myself as every bite was just one yum after another.) Luckily I don't mind sharing and ended up splitting a Tres Leches cake.. yeah that was good too!Overall, great job to the restaurant and their entire staff. Deducted a star as we were not offered their recommended (by other yelpers) cheese bread. Maybe I'm just being too harsh...But I'll definitely be back.",1,2,1,Richard K.,"New Hyde Park, NY",6,22,35
3.0,2/23/2014,"Brazilian churrascaria means meat meat and more meat. Beef, lamb, chicken, pork - you name it. Served on great big skewers and cut based on your temperature preference. At the end of the day though, I would have just stuck to the bottom sirloin - juicy, tender, hmm... Most of the other cuts were ok but not very exciting. Very impressive wine list too, though at a cost.",0,0,1,Vanni P.,"San Jose, CA",138,574,2
5.0,2/23/2014,"Seeing as how my bestie is Brazilian, she knows a thing or two about Brazilian barbecue.  We've tried Churrasceria Plataforma and were unimpressed.  When she heard Fogo de Chao was opening in midtown, she had to check it out.  I, of course, being the good friend that I am, joined her.  First, you don't realize the scale of this place from the outside.  You could almost walk by it if there were no sign outside the door directing you to the revolving doors.  When you walk in, you feel like you're not in New York.  The place is huge!  So much space!  You start thinking about the rent on a place like this and you start to realize the price of the meal is pretty decent when you factor in the amount of space and service you get at this place.  We started off with drinks at the main bar.  Alex was our bartender and he was amazing.  We've done the whole caipirinha thing one too many times and wanted to try something new.  So we tried the Superfruit Lemonade and Brazilian Martini.  The lemonade was refreshing with fresh fruit inside.  But the favorite was definitely the Brazilian Martini.  Yes, these are girly drinks, but they pack quite a punch when you're not looking.  Alex also made our friend a very delicious drink that was not on the menu which he calls the Tropical Caipirinha which also comes with fresh fruit bites.  That one was my favorite.Now on to the dining portion.  You walk down the stairs to a labyrinth of tables.  To your right you have the salad bar.  If you've never been to a Brazilian barbecue spot, I suggest you not eat for an entire day before going because this is basically like an all-you-can-eat buffet - on a fancier scale of course.  I decided to just stick to the salad bar and not do the meat portion.  My friend went with the meat.  They come around with all cuts of meat, pork, chicken, sausage - you name it, they serve it.  She said the quality of meat was superior to those of other places she has tried in the city.  The salad bar had enough food to fill me up on my first trip there.  They have different salads - that apple salad was very delicious.  The smoked salmon was also fresh.  I really enjoyed the coconut haddock.  Along with the meat, my friend enjoyed sides of mashed potato, polenta and pal de queijo (cheese bread).  The service was amazing.  No sooner did we finish the last of the polenta than the waiter came with a filled plate of more polenta.  Everyone was very attentive and helpful.  When it came time for dessert, we were torn between usual favorites like the molten chocolate cake or unique items like their signature papaya cream so we ended up trying four (there were four of us btw, so we don't seem so gluttonous).  Of the four, the favorites were the flan, the creme brule and the molten chocolate cake.  The papaya cream was not too sweet and would have been delicious on its own, but when you takes bites of it between all the other crazy sweet desserts, you couldn't truly appreciate it.All in all, Fogo de Chao was a wonderful experience.  Definitely a splurge but totally worth it.  Come hungry and leave in a food coma.",3,0,0,Lynette B.,"Miami, FL",472,548,725
5.0,2/21/2014,"Just finished eating dinner here with a party of 4. This is hands-down THE BEST Brazilian steakhouse that we have been to..(and we've been to a lot of them) The service is impeccable. The waiters all work Asa team and they are willing to get anything their customers asked for. We asked for chimichurri sauce and they actually made a batch for us and brought it out. Then we asked if they had chicken hearts or skirt steak because they weren't part of the rodizzio menu and they brought it out to us. Everyone and everything is above and beyond our expectations.They give you a several different appetizers such as cheese bread, sweet plantains, mashed potatoes and some type of corn cake. Everything was good and it was never empty! As you were going to finish the plate, they bring another one out before the plate is empty.The food was absolutely amazing and the salad bar has a little of everything. Our drinks were delicious! I had the superfruit lemonade (alcoholic) and there was real strawberry purée And blueberries! We also had red wine sangria and that was the best sangria that I've had! And our water glasses were NEVER empty!For dessert, we had flan and tres leches cake. The flan is thicker than usual, but that's common with Brazilian style flan. It was very delicious as was the tres leches cake. I can go on and on..if I can give this place 10 stars, I would! Oh! They also have a coat check!

5.0,2/19/2014,"Wow - that was hands down one of the top five meals I've ever had. My fiance and I were lucky enough to snag a reservation to Fogo de Chao for Valentine's Day, and I was so blown away by the experience that I'm already asking to go back. Just like other reviewer's have said, the service is impeccable (though not as overbearing as some have experienced). Our server was helpful in tracking down meats that we hadn't gotten to try yet (fiance was dying to try the leg of lamb) and answer questions, but generally just let us savor the insane amounts of meat being offered to us. My favorite was the bottom sirloin; the bacon wrapped chicken I was excited to try was totally underwhelming. The pao de queso was great; the other sides sufficient but not really worth the stomach room when there was so much awesome meat to have instead. Two important things: 1. Its totally worth skipping lunch before going here, to have maximum stomach room available. You'll need it. 2. Eat the meat as offered to you, and then turn your card to green. Its best when its still steaming off the stick. so as tempting as it is to let it pile up on your plate, turn your card to red until you can inhale what you have in front of you.",0,0,0,Karla F.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,8,1
2.0,2/18/2014,"I was so excited to try Fogo after hearing nice things and having eaten in the SP location. The place is very nice. That is where it ends. The quality of the meat was low. They didn't serve shrimp (unless you want to pay extra), palm hearts were not fresh, chicken hearts (they said they weren't delivered because of the storm even though it was 4 days ago), no pastels which are a traditional churrascaria appetizer. The sausage was not good quality. They didn't take plates away like in every other churrascaria. The final blow was when they reported to open table that we didn't show up when unfourtanately we did. We were very happy with Plataforma and think it is a better option. It isn't as nice, but what they save on decor they make up with higher quality food and service.",1,2,0,Scott G.,"New York, NY",1,8,0
5.0,2/16/2014,"This was my first Brazilian steakhouse experience.  I decided to take my carnivorous Valentine to Fogo de Chao for Valentines day and in hindsight, it was a genius decision.  We starved ourselves all day in preparation for this meal. Those more experienced had warned us not to fall to the temptation of that salad bar.  But alas, the fresh kale salad, arugula, crispy bacon strips, lox, romaine, olives, peppers were too difficult to resist.  Then came the cheesy breads.  Boy were those hard to pass up, so we didn't and we ate them and they were freaking delicious.  Simultaneously a parade of succulent, juicy hot off the fire meats started.  Filet mignon coming from the right, lamb chops coming from behind, pork sausages and chicken coming full speed ahead.   We had to flip the card over to red for a bit of a reprieve.  Deep breath, sit up straight in the chair, another deep breath and we flipped back the card to green.  Here comes the rum steak, ribs, garlic steak, top sirloin oh and I need some more filet mignon.  My stomach hurts, can't stop now, but I must. Card on red, yet here comes more plantains and cheese bread.  I didn't ask for that, but okay; I'll take it.  Feeling like a complete glutton.  So glad I have my Valentine and he loves me, because I'm so FAT at this point.  I wonder if he will love me this much when I'm this fat?  He claims he will, but I digress.....oh shit here comes some more of that top sirloin must flip back to green!Finally, by the end the meal both of us couldn't lift a finger and were physically unable to flip over the red card.  So they brought us the check.  $60 a piece, which is not that bad considering the carnage.  A completely unexpected surprise is that they gave us a gift card for a free dinner or lunch on them during our next visit as a Valentines Day gift.  Wow! I think they've just created an annual tradition for us.Ambiance and service was great.  This is an absolutely beautiful restaurant inside.  The food overall I would probably give 4 stars.  The side dishes were decent but nothing spectacular however the whole experience merits 5 stars!",7,2,1,Lizi C.,"Colorado Springs, CO",33,492,83

3.0,2/1/2014,"Again, probably a narrow miss for four stars. I've been to Fogo in other cities - NY is not as good, but still not bad. Positives - the meat is very good. The salad bar is good, albeit significantly less extensive than i remember in other locations. The room is very impressive, as if they had handed a talented interior designer a blank check. When we walked in, one of our party commented ""this place won't last long - they can't possibly charge enough to pay the rent on this space."" And the meat is very good.The negatives - the service was borderline overdone - attentive is good, intrusive is bad after a certain point it becomes annoying and distracting - I continually felt like i was being up-sold - i had four different guys offer to help me with the wine list within a 3 minute period, and suggest i consider the jereboams as good value for such a large group, which if my intentions ran to Silver Oak, I suppose it might have been.  Long tables jammed tightly together are sub-optimal for a group of twelve - conversation would have been easier at round tables. And then there are the desserts. This is the first time i have ever ordered dessert at a Fogo de Chao (it's not clear to me why anyone would order dessert after consuming 2/3 of a cow for dinner, but for some reason it seemed like a good idea.) I can't say that all the desserts were bad, but the consistency of the flan could only have been achieved by adding liberal amounts of portland cement to the recipe. I would say it was purchased at a supermarket, but i have never found that bad a flan at a supermarket. The key lime pie was ok, if unexceptional, but the flan was certainly exceptional.So, the ultimate fogo experience still involves a flight to another city, but if that doesn't fit in your schedule, this location isn't bad...and the meat is very good.",0,1,0,Oskar R.,"Atlanta, GA",0,9,0

Even if you don't eat beef, you can make a pretty filling meal out of all they offer at the salad bar and I have to remind myself to save room for the meat! Usually when you go to buffets or all-you-can-eat places they load up on the salt so you drink more water and don't eat as much. I didn't find that to be the case here at all.

We paid the restaurant a visit yesterday and found the food to be extremely disappointing. I made a point to try every type of meat offered, but most of the beef had a liver-like taste/powdery texture and the lambs were VERY gamey. Additionally, most of the meats were dry and even the juicy cuts were tough. The worst was the bacon wrapped filet mignon, which had a chemical taste to it.The only meats I found edible were the port ribs, sausages and the beer-marinated chicken wings. I felt sick after the meal and continued to feel sick this morning.The cheesy Brazilian bread was spectacular and was by far the best part of the meal.

5.0,1/2/2014,"As primarily a pescatarian this was an adventure way off the normal path. It was time for a zag (as in zig) and if you are going to do it a Brazilian steakhouse and the 'gaucho' way of creating a meal is a pretty good detour and for some reason a bit of a tradition to ring in the new year. Looking to take it the full experience of what it was about and leaving the consequences of creating a massive slug of meat in my system for later.The dining experience does not offer a menu of choices, instead what you have is a fixed dining experience. First is the salad buffet which is really quite fabulous. Everything I had was very fresh and quite tasty. Hearts of palm, artichoke bottoms, massive asparagus that is surprisingly crisp yet completely free of stringiness, and much more. It may have only been the starter yet it could have easily been the meal in itself -- not because of it being a bottomless buffet but rather because I found the quality and range of taste that good.When you finish your salad a waiter quickly comes by to swap out your dirty plate for a clean one and then it is up to you to turn your service chip from red to green. Upon doing so what could be described as a swarm of waiters with various cuts of meat start stopping at your table to allow you to select different wellness pieces of their offerings. Everything is carried about on swords where either the pieces of meat are deskewered (in the case of something like the sausages or pork chops) or sliced into your personal tongs.The problem I have here is separating all of the styles that came so fast to understand what I liked the best -- a far easier task on this third visit to Fogo!!! There were a few that did indeed stand out but if you are coming for a visit there is no reason not to try all that is offered to find your on personal favorites. And there is also not a problem turning something away if you want to skip it (like I did with the chicken offerings that came around) or requesting something that did not seem to be making it to your table on its own (like what happened to us with the leg of lamb). There are also sides of warm cheese bread, polenta, garlic mashed potatoes (that are incredibly light), and caramelized bananas on the table that they do a great job of keeping refreshed -- though I had a hard time even remembering they were there as I focused in on tasting the meat!This review is largely the same as what I wrote for the location in Scottsdale and outside of the above I think there are two other things worth noting: The place has only been open about a week and it was showing a few signs of bugs being worked out of the system including an error in our bill and a pretty crazy wait to get it fixed. However, Anderson (maybe the manager?) helped us out personally without a fuss and we will be back to try it again. Also, from the perspective of the Brazilian experience in general we have also tried Churrascaria Plataforma here in NYC, Espetus Churrascaria in San Francisco, and Texas de Brazil in Las Vegas and to date hold Fogo de Chao on top.",9,1,3,John R.,"Warren, NJ",181,1233,353

5.0,12/22/2013,"Came here with family who had previously been to the location in Indianapolis. It does seem expensive, but it is definitely worth it. The salad bar is large and impressive, and was fresh. The seemingly endless supply of different meats were really, really good (the chicken and lamb were delicious). There is no dedicated server for your table, rather, the whole staff waits on you. If there is a particular item you're interested in, you can simply tell a waiter and  they will make sure that item is sent to you ASAP. For instance, my table wanted to try the lamb but it wasn't making it rounds. We told an employee, and a few minutes later, there is was. The gluten free rolls were buttery and delicious. Desserts were a tad too large, but also super good. I had the papaya cream thing a waiter recommended, and I tried a bite of the towering chocolate mouse. The chocolate mouse cake was too sweet for my tastebuds, but the papaya cream was amazing. Nice and light, which was good seeing as how you will definitely overeat beforehand since everything is so tasty.I think its important to note that the servers who walk around with the meat have different pieces cooked to different temperatures (rare, medium rare, medium well, etc.). I hope there is a Groupon or LivingSocial deal at some point in the future, because this place is fantastic (albeit expensive).",1,0,0,Rianna G.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,45,3
5.0,12/20/2013,"$60 a head for dinner might sound steep, but it's more than worth every penny for a dining experience that is unforgettable in every way.Sure, the never-ending parade of delicious meats is amazing and the real reason you come here, but the thing that surprised and wowed me the most was the incredible service. It was seriously the best service I've received at any restaurant in recent memory, including any fine dining and non-buffet establishments.From the moment you arrive, every single member of the huge staff treats you like royalty, showing you to your seats, taking your jacket for you and putting it on your chair or checking it, and helping you into your seat. After that, they will ask you if you've been there before - you should just say yes and don't make the mistake I did, as it wastes a valuable minute that you could be gorging on the delicious meats going around the room and enjoying the beautiful salad bar.To save you those few minutes, they will just explain to you how you have a Green card and a Red card, which are pretty self-explanatory - leave it on Green the whole time to make sure they keep on bringing on the meat.So first make your way to the salad bar, which luckily has a lot of lighter fare, to offset the pounds of heavy meat and beige you will be eating otherwise. Oh yeah, and a giant, overflowing bowl of pure bacon. Yup, huge, crispy strips of bacon. This place is great.By the time you get back to your table, there is a fresh basket of Pao de Queijo waiting for you (cheesy bread), which is delicious. Once it loses its heat though, you should make sure to ask for a fresh basket, which they will be more than happy to bring you. Once the meat starts flowing, they also bring you endless amounts of the three available sides: Caramelized Bananas, Crispy Polenta, and Garlic Mashed Potatoes. To go along with all that beige, make sure to also get some Rice & Black Beans from the salad bar. These sides aren't the best, so I would probably avoid them in favor of saving more room for the huge variety of meats.Speaking of the meat, it's pretty much all great. And by great, I mean extremely juicy and tasty, but also some of it VERY salty. There is a helpful menu on the table detailing the huge number of cuts available, though there are even some more not listed. Among the ones I tasted that were really great were the Filet Mignon, Top Sirloin, Bottom Sirloin, Parmesan-Encrusted Pork, Ribeye, Pork Ribs, Bacon Wrapped Filet Mignon and Chicken, Lamb Chops, Marinated Chicken Legs, Pork Sausages, Picanha, Beef Ribs, and their Fogo Steak house specialty. It was mostly a blur of meat, but I vaguely recall the sirloins and the filet mignon, as well as the parmesan-encrusted pork being the standouts. You also must try the bacon wrapped filet mignon or chicken, which are also among the best.After several minutes of difficulty with breathing, I finally realized we should probably flip our card to Red, at which point the waiters finally stopped offering us the meat. At this point, there is no way anyone should possibly ever have any room left for any food, but we still went ahead and ordered some dessert, since you always have to end with some sweet. There is an extensive dessert menu (which is unfortunately not included in the $60 price, but fortunate since I would have had enough to really make myself sick if it were all included), from which we chose the Turtle Cheesecake ($11). I was once again surprised by how delicious this slice of cheesecake was, as it was one of the best I've tried, and it was an incredibly satisfying end to an overwhelmingly good meal.Once again, the service here is unmatched. The meat guys were so good, they quickly learned which temperature we liked our meats cooked to, and they even learned of our preferences for which meats we wanted (the sausage guy stopped coming to me after I rejected him a few times). The other staff members were also incredible, repeatedly checking on us to make sure we had everything, but not in an overbearing or interfering way. They even have those guys that come and clean the crumbs off the table, who moved like stealthy crumb-cleaning ninjas, and completed the job before I could even notice in some cases.At this price, and more especially at this quantity of food you will likely consume, this is definitely not an everyday restaurant, but for any special occasion or day where you feel like eating a ton of really good food, this place cannot be beat.",34,16,12,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1694,69834
5.0,12/19/2013,I was excited to hear today was the opening day. From the moment we walked in the staff was all smiles. The hostess upstairs communicated with the downstairs staff and once we got downstairs i was greeted by name. Our waiter Luke was very informative and very warm and friendly. We felt right at home. From the great wine suggestions to the desserts we had an amazing experience. Its a great experience I recommend to all meat lovers. Welcome to New York,3,0,0,Esther A.,"Queens, NY",0,98,27
5.0,12/19/2013,"The staff was very friendly and welcoming at the door. Nice atmosphere and the service was excellent. It's a meat lovers Paradise. You must try the lamb, it is tender, lightly seasoned and out of this world. I am not a big meat eater but there are all types of delicious beef. However, the lamb was my favorite and I is highly recommend it. There's a salad bar which is light. I like the polenta which is served at the table. it is very light and crispy. The caramelized banana is also nice. We had a 5:30 reservation and it was a good time. It got crowded later but they don't rush you. Leave room for dessert have the papaya cream it is so mellow and a nice ending to the meal.  Nice evening and great food!",3,0,0,Aurelia J.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,47,98

5.0,12/17/2013,"Picanha, Ribeye, Filet mignon, and Lamb (lamb is new for me at a brazilian steak house) but all were delicious. The salad bar was a little light, which was ideal for me, fully allowing me to focus on whats important--the meats. Filet mignon wrapped in bacon was expectedly awesome.In terms of decor, the place is huge and impressive, noise ok, and the decor/feeling very new yorkish elegant - not quite Quality Meats, but nice.",2,0,0,Maximiliano E.,"TriBeCa, Manhattan, NY",1,12,2
