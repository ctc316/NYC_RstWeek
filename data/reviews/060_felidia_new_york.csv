4.0,4/21/2019,"For the price point, the food should be mind blowingly good.  It's not.  Service is excellent, the wine list is impressive, they have like 5 different dishes featuring black truffles (for a mere $45 extra) and the food is well crafted high-end Italian, but nothing will change your life, or even your evening.  It's very Upper East Side.  If that's your thing, you will like it.  Personally, I prefer the downtown vibe, but that's just me.My dinner companion was sweet enough to buy me Lidia's book for sale at the front.  Much to my disappointment, it was not a cookbook, but the story of her life, which, frankly, I could care less about.",0,0,0,Tamara L.,"Croton-on-Hudson, NY",1,43,36

Overall: 4.5/5Value: 4.5/5 (lunch)Food: 4/5 Service: 5/5Decor: 5/5 We came for lunch and had their pre fixe ($34 for 2 course, $39 for 3 course). A number of options for each course which was nice, but some of them have supplement charges which can skew the prices on the high side. The food is fantastic and portions are big though. I had the seafood stew and the king salmon along with Nutella panna cotta. The seafood stew was rich and flavorful yet still light, with nice chunks of lobster and calamari and a bit of fresh pasta. The king salmon had a nice crispy skin, was a great portion and was nicely accompanied by potato with spinach. The panna cotta was quite rich and creamy. Others in my party had the lemon meringue and tiramisu, and they both liked those as well.

3.0,2/19/2019,"Quite a nice restaurant, but not a favorite. Will likely not be coming back. My boyfriend and I had come for a late Valentine's Day dinner, the day after, and were expecting something extraordinary. The atmosphere/dining room was just okay, somewhat old fashioned, and it left much to be desired. In fact, it was quite small. There were many servers, waiters, etc and they were all hovering around in one area. That makes it quite awkward when you're eating and there are about half a dozen attendants staring at you. However, they were indeed very helpful.We ordered a ravioli special to share as an appetizer, along with a zucchini pasta app. The ravioli were amazing, but they were perhaps the best part of the night. The other appetizer wasn't bad but I can't say we loved it. As for our entrees, they were both good but not great. My boyfriend was actually quite disappointed with his osso bucco because of the strange sauce it was in, and his butternut squash side was unnecessary to him. Additionally, his choice of wine was unsatisfactory as well. And I thought the Manzo was great but the vegetable sides were an odd choice. Finally, the dessert. I had ordered the tutto cioccolato, which was advertised as having ""nutella panna cotta, dark chocolate mousse, milk chocolate brownies, white chocolate ice cream"". All sounds amazing, right? Well, it wasn't... The nutella panna cotta was covered by whipped cream in a tiny cup and barely tasted like anything. It was just very fluffy overly sweet whipped cream. The same goes for the 'dark chocolate' mousse, which was anything but. On top of the brownies it was, again, far too sweet. Finally, the white chocolate ice cream was really no different from vanilla ice cream and it sat on top of a chocolate chip cookie that you couldn't even cut into to eat with it. Although the plating was nice, it seemed like it wasn't thoroughly thought out. I'm a HUGE chocoholic and I was left disappointed by the arrangement. As was my bf with his banana sundae. On a bright note, they did include a little selection of cookies in a baggie at the end of the night. That was very nice and the cookies were quite good.Overall, the restaurant is just fine and I'm sure that, with the right options, you could have a very nice dinner here. However, it just wasn't worth the value for us. With only one good appetizer, one half of a good entree, and a disappointing dessert overall.. it wasn't worth the price tag. If in the future we look to dine like this again, we'll definitely be looking for a place with better food options and a more enjoyable atmosphere.",0,0,0,Ella L.,"Brooklyn, NY",11,55,82
1.0,2/14/2019,It was such a bad experience. We went there to celebrate Valentine's Day. They told us that there's only one prix fixe menu that costs $155 min. We didn't like anything on the menu but had no other choices. So we decided to stay to see what will happen. The food was not impressive at all. The worst part was the dessert. It was even worse than the food we would get from a food truck. Will not go there again. Not worth the money we spent.,0,0,0,Emily C.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,3,0

We ordered from the restaurant week 2019 menu.They started us with fresh bread, along with avocado and white bean spread. For apps, we got the pesto pasta and house smoked salmon. Their homemade pasta was so fresh with the correct amount of pesto sauce. Yummy!!! The smoked salmon was surprisingly not too salty, perfect match with the egg salad.For the second course, we got the braised beef brisket and branzino. The branzino was cooked to perfection, not too raw but not rough, def good timing and cooked at the correct temperature. The braised beef brisket was very typical, very tender, and tasted more like pastrami but with good flavoring and spices.Lastly, we finished our meal with the tiramizucca. Very different from the traditional tiramisu, this one only comes with cream and not much cake or espresso powder. Unique, however def not my type of dessert. Overall, great service, great food.

4.0,1/13/2019,"It was our second visit to your restaurant on 58th Street. It was Friday December 21st. We were dining with our daughter and boyfriend who came to spend Christmas with the family. The food was delicious as usual. We requested a table on the mezzanine which we got and enjoyed. Service was very good as usual, except when it came to the truffles ""promotion"". The waiter kept pushing for the truffles and finally we gave up under the pressure. What we didn't realize that the two rounds of truffles for four people amounted to $600! It wasn't until I received the check that we found out. In a respectable restaurant like Felidia's you should expect to be asked if ok to serve you truffles at a $75 per person round. We are fortunate that we could afford $600 in truffles but it is disingenuous to push for a dish so expensive without informing the customer. (The entire check was for $1,400) That experience left me with a ""bitter taste"". I'm not ruling out going back but right now I'm not happy about what happened.

5.0,12/22/2018,We come into NYC to dine at Felidia once or twice a year. Last night was great.

1.0,12/21/2018,"I am giving Felidia 1 star - not because of bad food (our meals were actually quite delicious), but based solely on the bad attitude of our head waiter.My mother and father live in Florida but  are staying in NYC for a couple of months because my father is being treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering.  We were so excited to secure a dinner reservation at Felidia - my parents are HUGE fans of Lidia!  My father hadn't been feeling well and finally had an appetite and although exhausted, was excited to indulge in ""a nice dish of pasta"" after a long day in the hospital.When we were seated, our first server asked if we wanted to start with a drink from the bar.  We declined as my father is not permitted to drink alcohol during his cancer treatments, my mother does not drink and I was just coming off of my holiday party the night before.When the head waiter came to take our orders, we decided to forego appetizers and opted for a main course (followed by desserts and coffee).  I ordered my entree and was asked what I'd like for an appetizer. When I declined, our waiter was noticeably agitated.  My mother then ordered an entree with no appetizer - again a look of disgust on his face!  Before my father could speak, the waiter asked in a sarcastic tone, ""no appetizer for you, either?"".  My father apologized but said he wasn't feeling well enough to have more than his entree.  Really???!!! I wasn't aware that one has to apologize for not ordering a 3 course meal?  The water then walked away and dramatically dropped the menus down on the back counter.  We were all so uncomfortable, but decided not to let it ruin our evening.  The entrees arrived and we all enjoyed them.  Afterwards, my mother and I ordered a couple of desserts with some coffee, that were quite good as well.  It didn't go unnoticed that our waiter stopped by the surrounding tables to check in on other patrons, asking if they needed anything - but not once did he stop at our table.  I was very close to having words with him but did not want to put a damper on our little celebration of sorts.  My parents actually questioned if perhaps they didn't look ""rich enough"", hence the lack of attention.  What a terrible way to feel!I am extremely disappointed in our experience at Felidia and hope that this review is brought to Lidia's attention as I am certain she would be appalled to know that 3 patrons (and fans) were made to feel unwelcome in her establishment!",19,0,0,Dorothy S.,"Locust Valley, NY",0,1,0

2.0,11/11/2018,"DINNER, NOVEMBER 8, FELIDIA 2 stars 1.  Lovely dining room.  Small tables very close together, difficult to maneuver.  However, we were an early reservation so the dining room was empty. We got to our table, in the back of the restaurant at the kitchen having passed 12 empty tables.  Why?2.  Staff very warm, very attentive, very personable.3.  Food was of the Italian Minimalist nature.  Small portions and underwhelming flavor.  In Felidia' s case, you DO NOT GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.FOOD:All of our expectations were extremely high.   Collectively, we were all disappointed.APPETIZERS:* Shishito Pepper Salad was ok.* Scallop and caviar (?) special was boring looking on the plate.  Zero eye appeal.   And the caviar was hard to find on the plate.* Grilled Octopus was good.  Tender, not rubbery.* White Truffle Risotto we shared. Shaved white truffle on top.  Excellent. But, at $103.00, some extra rice would have been nice.ENTREES: * Quail Special, good, lovely plating, but not hot.* Veal Medallions were without any seasoning and the plating presentation was not good.* Veal Milanese was undercooked; tasteless, greasy, and beige.  Ate three bites. After seeing that I didn't touch this entree, the server inquired if I was full, I said no, it was not good. So it just sat in front of me.  I wasn't offered a different entree and wasn't take off the bill.DESSERTS:   Fine, just fine. Regrettably, nothing to comment about. SUGGESTION:  Lidia might consider going into Felicia's Kitchen  and expedite the food leaving the kitchen making sure each plate is DELISH and PERFECT.  Or better yet, maybe it is time  Lidia put her Chef Hat on and get and return to the kitchen and start cooking again.  This was our SPECIAL DINNER while visiting NYC, not even close.

3.0,11/8/2018,"This review is based on two dinners. Recently we had an early dinner reservation as it was a weeknight. Everyone was very solicitous. We ordered 4 first courses, 4 mains, a bottle of wine and sparkling water. The food was good but not terrific which we had hoped for. The fish entrees were good the veal bland. Pasta with cauliflower was pedestrian. They kept refilling our water and wine glasses. Not just one person but about four. They kept asking another wine, another bottle of water? Not just once but a number of times.We decided just to end with coffee. When they brought our coffee they threw the bill on the table without our requesting it! They did  not need the table the room was 1/2 full. They kept hovering waiting for our credit card!  It was rude.

1.0,8/14/2018,"Went for Restaurant week lunch with a friend and was very disappointed with the food, service, and overall experience. 1. The food.- ordered the beef tartar, tortiglioni & the tiramisu- beef tartar was subpar and tasteless by itself yet was drowned in some sort of sauce that didn't compliment it very well. The arugula on top was wilted.- tortilglioni - I guess it was my fault I shouldn't have ordered this when the waiter recommended the fish but I figured for an Italian restaurant, the pasta would be a good choice. Umm... it was not great. It was covered in a green broccoli sauce and lacked flavour. It was a simple dish but for a lunch entree, it left me wanting more (and not of the tortiglioni) - tiramisu - I don't know what this was but it was not tiramisu. It was supposed to be made of butternut squash with the usual mascarpone & chocolate layers but whatever I had was a thick pile of indistinguishable cream. I couldn't figure out what I was eating and had to stop after two spoonfuls cuz it tasted so bad.  2. The service was terrible - I had to ask 3x (and 3 different waiters) for hot water & lemon. When we finished our entrees, because I didn't finish mine, I asked the waiter to pack it up for me. He returned a few minutes later and pushed the takeout bag onto my shoulder right when I was in the middle of talking and said ""Here, miss"". Both my friend and I were taken aback at how abrupt he was. The servers were rarely around throughout the whole meal but oh so conveniently showed up immediately after we paid to take our bill (and also rudely making sure to open up the bill to make sure we tipped!).Overall, wouldn't recommend this place... with or without restaurant week!",3,2,2,Esther Y.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",102,21,9

4.0,7/28/2018,"Growing up as an adolescent boy, Lidia is one of the reasons I became a foodie and got into cooking.  I would watch her cooking shows at 1-2 in the morning on public access or PBS.  ""Tutti a tavola a mangiare"" will forever be ingrained my head as I was drooling watching her eat the creation she just made.  I finally ventured over to her restaurant to see if it was the real deal.  Here is my review...The first thing I noticed walking up was the sanitary inspection grade of a ""B.""  Most NYC restaurants actually fall into this category but I did expect it to be graded higher.  Anyway, on early arrival the maitre d had us go to the bar for a pre dinner aperitif.  The bartender was very outgoing, made a delicious Manhattan, and helped with some food recommendations.  We were quickly escorted to our table.  Our waiter came to our table friendly, enthusiastic, and with a smile on his face.  Unfortunately, I wish I could say the same for the sommelier he brought over to help us select the rosso di montalcino which was paired very well with our meal.  For NYC, the wine was reasonably priced.  I just wish the sommelier would have smiled and been a bit more personable.  She may have even rolled her eyes as she walked away from our table but I cannot 100% be certain about that.  We picked out 6 dishes between 2 apps, 2 pastas, and 2 mains.  Our server had us do the Traditional Italian dinner as it included that plus dessert for a less expensive price than if we did everything a la carte.  They brought out a delicious focaccia bread with some sort of bean and green purée.  I'm not exactly sure what it was, but it did taste good.  We started with the veal tonnato and burrata appetizers.  I felt both dishes were under salted and mediocre.  The whole time eating it I could see Lidia saying it needs more salt!  Next, was our pastas!  We had the cacio e pere and the Bianconeri.  I loved both dishes!  The cacio was delicate, buttery, and savory.  The pear filling was such a nice touch!  I felt the Bianconeri stole the pasta show.  It is this homemade black and white pasta with perfectly cooked shrimp and some other seafood such as calamari in a red pesto sauce.  For our main, we got the eggplant ""parm"" (came with asparagus, eggs, and scallions) and the Vitello with summer black truffles.  The eggplant was extremely tender and either lightly or not breaded at all.  It was rich, served in a generous portion, and deliciously caramelized around the edges.  The Vitello was cooked to a perfect medium rare and the hazelnut fonduta made the dish.  The summer black truffles unfortunately were bland and a complete waste of money.  When the waiter was grating the truffle over the veal he said, ""we don't want to overpower the veal with too much truffle.""  He could have grated the whole truffle over the veal and it still would be bland.  When I told him about the tasteless truffle, his disappointing response was that summer truffles are not as strong as winter.  Now, I know that is true however, this truffle did not add anything to the dish and why order it if that is the case.  They should have comped that off our bill.   For dessert, we had the raspberry panna cotta, tiramisu, and mixed berries. Neither of us are huge dessert eaters, but we were impressed with the offering. Strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries were at the peak of seasonal freshness and the portion was just right. A complimentary variety of cookies and biscotti were also delightful. We opted for limoncello over coffee and unfortunately were disappointed- it was not great- aftertaste was very overpowering and lacking in the bright lemon flavor we expected.",0,1,1,Mike O.,"Howell, NJ",262,8,15
3.0,7/24/2018,"I went there for a work-related dinner.  We got a 'tasting menu' with at least five (maybe six?) dishes, plus a dessert assortment for each of us.  The main dishes were all excellent, and delicious.  As for the dessert, it's hard to say if my feeling 'full' at that point may have affected my viewpoint of the dessert.  I really wasn't into eating more food at that point, but not wanting to waste, nor miss out on something potentially spectacular, I DID try a bit of each of the desserts on my plate.  But yet, I didn't seem as bowled over by the desserts, as I was by the appetizers/entrees.As for the service, it was fine.  But for a restaurant of that caliber/price point, the servers didn't strike me as being real food connoisseurs, or like they knew the menu inside out.  It was more like they were just putting on airs that they thought we might like, such as their listing off each of our dishes, as they were brought to us, but in a manner that suggested a lack of real knowledge or enthusiasm.Getting a tasting menu meant that all five of us had to get the same dishes.  At a certain point, we could not eat any more of certain dishes, or decided to take certain leftovers home.  Anytime the plates were cleared, if we asked for doggie bags, this was all done out of our site.  Now why on earth I'm going to seriously think that the servers are actually going to hand us back, our 'exact' leftovers, is beyond me.  I highly doubt they take note of exactly whose leftovers is whose.  Remember, we got the tasting menu, so all of our leftovers looked exactly the same.  This fact was rather unfortunate, for at a certain point I realized it was pointless to ask for more leftovers to be wrapped up.  As good as the food was, I decided I would only be trashing the leftovers once I got home.  I had no interest in eating one of my work colleague's leftovers.  NOTE TO RESTAURANT:  If a party that did the tasting menu asks for leftovers to be packaged up, you should either do the packaging up AT the table, in front of them, so they understand the leftovers are 'theirs'....or else you should hand each person a takeout container, to do the packaging themselves.We dined there on a Monday night, and sat in the back room on the second level.  By around 730p, the small room was more or less full.  The noise level was quite loud, which unfortunately for me is a deal breaker.",0,0,0,Lisa e.,"New York, NY",54,320,20

The food (from the chickpea spread & bread, to our entrees - pear and pecorino ravioli & pork chop, and the desserts - mini cannoli and tutto cioccolato), the service, the atmosphere. I can't even believe some of the reviewers saying this place is expensive. Felidia's is reasonable given the quality of the food and the stellar service. We have been to a ton of other restaurants in NYC and elsewhere, paid the same but had subpar food and/or service. Highly recommend. Can't believe it took me 25 years to come back.

First of all, I didn't know who was the waiter for the table and after it took far too long for someone to come and take our order, I ended up asking what looked like the sommelier to get whomever our waiter was. When the waiter arrived he breezed through the specials (not to mention forgot a few of them) and seemed like he was either very new or very distracted.I will say the pear ravioli dish is absolutely divine, and a truly magical experience. I wish I had gotten the larger portion as my meal, ITS THAT GOOD. But we also had the spinach and duck tagliatelle which was also extremely delicious. Overall they know what they're doing when it comes to pasta. Perfectly al dente, perfectly seasoned and overall was fabulous. I got the eggplant parm as my entree which was a great portion size, very hot, and very flavorful. I noticed no breadcrumbs were used on the eggplant which I liked a lot. I think the asaparagus salad that came on the side was a little random and sad looking but I ate it, of course. For dessert we shared the tiramisu and it was just not tiramisu. It was two scoops of cream with a white chocolate and dark chocolate shaving. Oh yes and a few bits of lemon zest. The presentation was there but where was the ladyfingers soaked in espresso?! There was zero espresso flavor. However, the complementary cookies were GOOD, I loved them.",1,0,0,Kristen V.,"New York, NY",3,30,24

Started with the delish fennel salad cooked and uncooked. It was awesome and will try to replicate at home. Then we went with the black truffle Home made pasta. At first it needed some salt and pepper. Keep in mind black truffles are no white truffles($69). Then we dived into the se bass fava beans and nettle green broth. It was a special for the evening. Oh, it was special too. We had two super tuscans($18each). A sambuca with the espresso And a margarita of Dom Julio($24). The grand total was $244 before tip. I think they margarita was a tad over priced. I think that not to offer a biscotti or petit fours is ridiculous. I asked about the petit fours and he said we do not do that. He also had me repeat it a couple times like petit fours is unheard of. If I am going to sit down and pay $300 for a dinner it should excel on ever aspect. The meal was good. So is Primola  and dozen other places. For me it fell short. Ok live and learn. Primola for a wonderful attentive meal that will make whatever you want on menu or off.

A pasta with pesto, which we ordered to replace a pesto pasta. This would be the moment for the waiter to point out that despite the dish having pesto, it's not listed on the menu (which is its own separate problem that needs to be addressed) but he put in the order knowing our allergy. He and the restaurant are LUCKY we are vigilant about our allergy.2. The dessert course came out with an almond milk Panna cotta. The dessert was pre-selected with the tasting menu, therefore giving the kitchen ample time to prepare an alternate dish for us. This makes me think that there are 3 huge problems:1. The menu is inaccurate 2. The waiter did not know the menu/was unable to help us navigate the food3.

Our table was right next to a cooking station and also each time the door opened we got a blast of cold air.  It seemed ridiculous that this 4 seated table was positioned where it was.  The Felidia menu has changed also, much more limited.  The olive oil tasting, used to be a favorite, disappeared as has a number of dishes.  Vegan choices extremely limited.  Bread basket with 5 pieces of blah tasting bread, we asked for more and it never arrived.   I had the scallops app which was a special last night. Very good but very few scallops.   The other 2 people had the special butternut squash soup which was delicious.  They each had a pasta dish which was nothing special, for 55! dollars i had the grilled seafood plate.  It arrived warm and became cold as the blasts of cold air came in.  It was skimpy, tiny pieces of calamari and the rest just so so, no real flavor, not sure how fresh the fish may have been.  Service was not what it used to be, it wasn't busy but felt rushed. Dessert not special either. I had the bread pudding which i normally really like, it was bland and flavorless.  The best part was the plate of cookies they provided.  Not sure what has happened there, but will think twice about returning.  The restaurant looks great with the renovations they did, they need to get the food and service back up to par.  Other reviews say similar things so something is up.  Lidia should return and be more hands on before the reputation of this restaurant is sullied for good.",2,0,0,Stuart K.,"Bronx, NY",0,17,0

4.0,9/8/2017,"Being a fan of Becco, I'd been wanting to dine at Felidia to compare the food & experience.  As much as I'd wanted to give this place 5 stars, there were 2 minor items that gave me pause.First, the service staff were all friendly and attentive.  We had an early reservation (6:15) and we were greeted and seated immediately.  They have a more than adequate wine list and a broad selection of Italian wines (as expected).  The sommelier noticed my reviewing the wine list and came by to offer his assistance, I politely declined.  They brought the bottle over to confirm our selection and here is where I have minor complaint #1; I know that it's a common practice to decant the wine and bring it to the table, but I'd have preferred to have the wine decanted table-side.  Apologies, but I'd prefer to have visual confirmation that you're getting the bottle you've just selected.Felidia offers a seasonal menu with appetizer & entre'e sized portions, a ""family style"" dining experience (as long as everyone at your table agrees to it), or a standard or vegetarian ""tasting menu"".  I'd have loved to try the ""family style"" menu but couldn't convince my dinner companions to entertain the idea.Our table shared the tuna carpaccio/tartar & asparagus special, we all found it to be excellent.  We also shared the Busiati pasta w/ roasted tomato, eggplant & zucchini.  The pasta was fresh, well prepared, and tasty.  For my entre'e, I ordered the Vitello w/ asparagus, carrot purée, grana padano fonduta, and pistachio.  Minor complaint #2; although the waiter properly warned me that the veal would be served med-rare, but it was a tad rarer than I would have liked.  Shame on me for not speaking up, but I hadn't expected it to be that pink.  I enjoyed the meal nonetheless, but I'd have enjoyed it more had the seared it an extra 2 minutes.The desserts capped the meal for me, the assortment of cookies provided were phenomenal, especially the pignoli amaretti ... just awesome.  They have a unique take on tiramisu (peach, amaretti, and chocolate mascarpone) that I enjoyed, but if you're a traditionalist you may want to avoid it.Overall it was an excellent dinner and I'm looking forward to returning to try the ""family style"" menu.  :-)",1,0,0,John S.,"Cedar Grove, NJ",1,4,0
1.0,9/6/2017,"Quite the disappointment.  While the service was fine, and the food was decent, but perhaps not superlative, Felidia seems to have become one of these soulless corporate chain restaurants, where the drive for expansion now has left the core restaurant in the hands of non-owners/chefs, and hence the attention to detail is now lacking.  No one really cares that much.We went for my birthday last week, spent $300+ on the tab, and what was most disappointing was that the A/C in the restaurant was at meat locker cold levels on what was a chilly late August evening, even being to the point where our appetizers and entrees became cold prior to our finishing them.  When informed of the problem, the answer we got from our server and then the maitre d' later were more or less, so sorry, but next time it will be better.I must say, having lived in NYC for over 30 years, and having experienced many fine meals in the city, (many of them Italian), that the shrugging of shoulders and come back will make it better, was a pretty weak response for a restaurant of this purported caliber and at this price point.  It has to be right the first time, not the second or third time.  Sorry, but trust me, next time it will be better at this price point is just a terribly poor response.  Especially when we very likely will never come back after this.  Calling the Maitre d' after he gave us his card really means nothing, an empty gesture on his part seemingly.  There are just too many great, non-corporate Italian restaurants in NYC.  Skip this one, unless you enjoy going to a high end chain......",0,0,0,Scott F.,"New York, NY",0,14,0

5.0,6/22/2017,"My wife and I ate dinner here this evening with some of her coworkers. Prior to dining here we had done our research on best Italian restaurants in the city because the people she was hosting were from out of town so we wanted them to have. Superb meal. Felicia's continued to come up each time we googled best Italian places in the city and it certainly didn't disappoint. Wine- the wine list was extensive and as to be expected some were a bit pricey. The only downfall of this extensive wine list was that it consisted mostly of wines from Italy which in hindsight isn't necessarily a downfall considering this is an Italian place, however it would have been nice to have a variety of wines from various European countries Appetizer- as one of the specials we ordered the Burrata which came with some greens and toasted bread. The burrata was on point it was extremely fresh and creamy. The quantity was great, the four of us split it easily.Entree- I ordered the Candele which came with spicy rosemary sauce and ricotta. The portion was just enough leaving me completely satisfied and not overly stuffed. The candele was very fresh cooked to perfection along with the fresh rosemary sauce that did have a kick but one that wasn't to overwhelming even for those who don't enjoy spicy food. My wife had a the pear and pecorino ravioli. The ravioli were absolutely delicious. They were in a light cream sauce that went excellent with the pasta choice.Overall the meal was  phenomenal so much so that we left zero room for dessert. We did however brows the menu and they offered a large variety of cake, gelato, and sorbet. The only downfall would be I wish they offered more protein dishes consisting of more traditional chicken breast, red meat, and fish. As for price they certainly weren't as expensive as I anticipated. I don't mean this to say this would be an inexpensive meal however for location and quality food I certainly didn't mind spending the money. Every dish was reasonably priced especially for Manhattan. However, even with that being said this meal was great the chef certainly hit it out of the park! If you are in the city I strongly recommend dining here!",1,0,0,Daniela R.,"Paramus, NJ",17,18,2
3.0,6/21/2017,"we came with high expectations - i'm a Lidia Bastianich fan - went to Becco's and loved it. Felt very disappointed after our Felidia dinner. The burrata appetizer was disappointing. part of it was mostly very thin and skinlike. not creamy. and the creamy part wasn't very tasty. Also had the pappardelle for appetizer. it was al dente, but not exceptional, and honestly, Manzo in Eataly was much better. Had the grigliata (grilled seafood) dish. it was good but honestly, the calamari was just a little overcooked. not rubbery, but just a little too chewy. other seafood restaurants in town do it much better, and tastier. the scallops were good, but not exceptional. my husband had the quail, but i think it was the size of a parakeet or a hummingbird. there were two nuggets served with it, but they were rather fatty (as if wrapped in bacon...)and for $45, more than a little disappointing.  For just these 4 dishes, $180 w/o tip - I don't think we'll be back.",1,0,0,Cynthia A.,"Malibu, CA",9,173,163

They give us BOTH fusilli and the male head waiter insisted that is what I said. Literally caused a scene for no reason. Admit your mistake and fix it. The bresaola was ok. My friends fusilli was nice. Shoulda kept it the first time lol. For entrees, we both got the monkfish, and it was terrible. Chewy and tough, fish shriveled up while cooking. There's supposed to be a notable chef here? I didn't taste it. One of my pieces had a cluster of veins (on the bottom, not the inside). I asked why it wasn't removed. The already 'amicable' head waiter of ours again gives me attitude, goes to the kitchen, and says, ""the chef said that is how it's supposed to be"". Oh, I'm supposed to eat a tough fish with a bunch of veins, thanks. For a $$$$ Italian place, my dessert of tiramisu was maybe the worst tiramisu I've ever had in my life.

4.0,5/24/2017,"Came here to celebrate an anniversary with my husband. Since we live in the neighborhood, Felidia has been high on our to-try list.The restaurant appears really cute from the outside, on the first floor. It's always packed and has a nice bar area. As we arrived, we were brought upstairs though. The architecture of this restaurant is definitely pretty unique. There's multiple floors (feels like 5!) and seems like different wings also. I say that because we were seated in a part of the restaurant where through a glass, we could see the other side facing us.The setting is extremely formal and almost severe. Maybe it's ""traditional"", but we were seated next to three other tables for two. I felt like if only one couple was talking, the whole area could eavesdrop. Luckily, everybody kept their respective conversations going so it wasn't horribly awkward.We both started off with some delicious cocktails. I should have taken notes, as they are not listed on their website so I cannot share which ones we had solely based on memory.For appetizers, we shared Busiati which is hand rolled pasta, oven roasted tomato, roasted cauliflower, black currant and as what I recall seemed like an endive salad, which is not listed on their site. Both were excellent and great sharing portions. As a main, I ordered the Grigliata which consisted of scallops, lobster, calamari, shrimp & razor clams alla piastra, spring vegetables. The portion was generous, every piece of sea food was cooked differently, so I really got to appreciate the unique flavor and textures. For dessert, they brought us a tray of: panacota which I loved, tiramisu which was so delicate and heartwarming, and a fruit salad I could have lived without. They additionally threw in some little cookies, which I really appreciated, being such a fan of dessert. We also receive a loot bag of scrumptious sweet madeleines (those cookies that feel more like moist cake).Honestly, I really enjoyed the food and I think for such quality, the price was very reasonable! However I'm not convinced about the setting being ideal. Maybe we're not the targeted demographic (we're in our 30s), but the lack of music and feeling stuffed into a small room with 3 other couples seemed a little uncomfortable.",1,0,0,Laura S.,"Manhattan, NY",128,329,4

Perhaps not always for the food but perhaps for the service or ambiance or for particular dishes or ingredients. In this case the highlight was the food. It was an early dinner and very quiet / low energy in the dining room.I'd made reservations and indicated the request to try the winter break menu - a Prix fixe dinner menu - usually reserved as a pre-theater specialAn overflowing basket of complimentary bread started the meal and was accompanied by a spread (I believe made of bean) which included olive oil but the spread  was bland at first until I requested additional olive oil to enhance the flavor. Selection of bread included an interesting purple wheat bread which was soft and a little sweet compared to the other white breads, which tasted a little dryVery pleased when first course arrivedSalmone AffumicatoLarge plate with generous amounts of smoked salmon pastrami with bagel crostini that were worked well to eat as a bruschetta with a layer of salmon and boiled egg and blue potato salad to top.

The cookies were useful and very tasty as scoops for the TiramisuAdditional sweet bites (pignoli cookies, pistachio cookies, plus a fruit cookie) were provided with the bill and those were excellent as wellThe service was fair.

3.0,2/4/2017,"I dont write reviews often, but I have been looking forward to having my birthday dinner at Felidia for months. The food was absolutely delicious except that the red wine was served chilled. I am sorry to also say I am very disappointed with the service I received. My family of 6 was seated behind a false wall closed off from the rest of the restaurant due to a private party being held on the second floor. However, our waiter perhaps was focusing on this party, because when we sat down no one even came to offer us water until about 10-12 mins into our meal. We ordered appetizers, and the waiter was no where to be seen again. My mother asked someone to bring him and I saw people peeking into our closed off room with confused expressions as if they weren't sure whether they were supposed to serve us or not. Eventually, i began timing these intervals. At one point an entire 20 mins passed without anyone entering the room, refilling our glasses or anything. Finally, I had seen on instagram that Felidia does latte art. I kindly asked if they could do that for my drink. The man was hesitant in saying yes. My mom chimed in and said it's for her birthday, and he said he would try his best. I'm not sure why this is up for debate. It's a matter of having someone make a dog face on a latte with a toothpick for someone's birthday. Something you publicly posted on your social media. I hardly think the request was unreasonable. Again, my latte was divine and my tiramisu was delicious. I tried to relax and let it go. The last straw was when the coat check lost my coat. They brought me a man's coat, and then a black parka even though I explicitly said it was a grey peacoat. It wasn't until I noticed the person found my coat balled up, that I realized it was most likely on the floor and no one thought to pick it up.

5.0,2/4/2017,"We went here for dinner during restaurant week, not knowing that their deal was only for lunch. And then our table wasn't ready for 15 minutes even though we made reservations... So we were fully prepared for a disastrous evening. But nothing could be further from reality...I now understand why famed chef's Lidia Bastianich's flagship restaurant (she also owns/co-owns Del Posto, Esca, Becco, and Eataly) has been going strong for over 35 years. First, we were greeted by the lady herself on the way to our seats (her office is in the restaurant). That in itself lightened our moods.Next was the really nice and spacious dining room. No bumping into other diner's elbows or having to overhear everyone else's conversations. And none of that, Manhattan-style lighting where you can't even read your menu.No, the ambiance (old school Italian) was perfect and the service was friendly but respectful... And then there was the food. We had the Captain's tasting menu, replete with more than a few strong cocktails. I'll just say, first of all, for the price, you're gonna get way too much food. I think I was actually full from the first appetizer, (the chicken liver dish, which was *wonderful*). My dining companion had a similar reaction with his perfectly cooked octopus.This was followed by two pasta dishes that they split for us so that we both could partake. The pear and pepper ravioli (a signature dish) had a surprisingly fresh flavor (special) but the star was the broccoli rabe pasta which was, in a word, ""unexpected"".So now we're beyond full, but we managed to still enjoy the pork chop main dish which was good, but maybe not as good as the previous dishes, and a steak dish which was Manhattan steak-house great (and both beautifully presented).The dessert was kinda throw away dish, but we were so full and happy by then it just really didn't matter. Thank you Lidia and Felidia for uplifting our culinary spirits and reminding us why we love Manhattan on what really could've been a disappointing evening.

2.0,1/1/2017,"I'm only giving Felidia a 2 star because the service was decent and I did enjoy two meals out of the six course New Years Eve tasting menu offering. My mother always wanted to go to Felidia since she is a big fan of chef Lidia Bastianich. We had reservations and decided that we were going to try their six course tasting which was $225 per person. I'm excited at this point because the food sounds good. The server brings out the drinks and then appetizer shortly. The first appetizer was a poached lobster tail with squash purée, burrata, topped with caviar. It was absolutely delicious. Now I am really excited to try more food. They brought out small bites of food that consisted of raw salmon, a beet salad, smoked salmon pastrami and a kale salad with local cheese. Quite tasty but the lobster still set the bar for me at this point. They brought out a second appetizer which I asked for a  substitution because I could not eat any raw foods as I am pregnant. I had cod in a lobster sauce with mushroom and crispy potato chips on top. I could barely taste any lobster in the sauce and the cod was cooked well but it was just very bland. I wish they added more crispy potato chips because that was the best part of the meal. My mother enjoyed her tuna tartare and carpaccio appetizer. Now here is where things takes a turn for the worst. I love risotto and that was probably the dish I was looking forward to the most. At Felidia the risotto I had was horrible. Undercooked, watery and not creamy. The chive, butter, salmon roe and sturgeon caviar did not mesh well together. Always the optimistic one I thought the last two dishes were going to make me forget about the fluke that was risotto. Unfortunately, the 3 meat ravioli entree was forgettable and the veal tenderloin in a grand padano sauce with artichoke and sunchoke left a lot of flavor to be desired. Atleast they did not mess up dessert. I am underwhelmed with Felidia's food. You'd expect for food of that price range to be executed better and have consistent flavor.

4.0,12/11/2016,"The food was excellent and expertly prepared.  You won't be disappointed.  Ellie was terrific helping with the wine selection as my knowledge of Italian wines isn't deep. For about $100 in NYC it was a nice selection.  It might have helped to have the specials on a printed paper as it was rather difficult to hear them described, part of the understanding was a bit of an accent from our waiter as well.Dishes:  Grilled octopus, excellent and a nice portion.  Tuna entree, wonderful and such a nice presentation, grilled only on one side and seasoning was perfect.  Spaghetti squash topped with an egg was a nice light dish.  Pasta with pistachios, yum.  Since the pear ravioli is a specialty we added an entree plate to share among the table which was a great add on.  Wonderful restaurant.  I'll come again for sure.",0,0,0,Mark S.,"Saint Louis, MO",87,142,56

3.0,11/28/2016,"This was my first time at Felidia's.  A friend and I went for dinner this past Saturday night. i must say we were having a great time, the staff and the food was amazing.  the reason I gave it a 3 stars was because halfway through our dinner the bus boy cleaning off the other table bumped into our table hard knocking over my full glass of prosecco that our sommelier had just poured.  It spilled all over the table, floor and my 'dry clean only' leather vest. (thank goodness it wasn't red wine) The busboy was super apologetic and cleaned everything.  I wasn't angry with him because it was an accident . The tables were way to close for anyone to get by.  My problem  was that not one manager came over to see if there was anything they could do.  at first we thought perhaps they didn't want to make a big to do with other diners there and would stop by at the end.  Not so. I know the bus boy told someone that looked like the floor manager or head person in the room with a suit on.  He would stop by the tables to make sure everything was good.  Not once did he stop by to apologize for the spill.  It would have been nice for him to acknowledge that it happen and at least offer another glass of prosecco. For a nice restaurant that we sent over $250 for two people I don't fine this expectable.  With so many nice restaurants in NYC, this might not be my first choice again. I wasn't looking for a comped meal, so I didn't make a fuss but was quite disappointed at the response or lack of and this experience is something that i will be repeating every time someone ask me how or meal was at Felidia's.",0,0,0,P L.,"Gilbertsville, PA",0,9,1

We arrive just as they opened at noon on a quiet Tuesday afternoon. Three course lunch special was great value for money with more than enough variety to satisfy the most discerning palate. However, my head was turned by the special ink conchigle pasta with shellfish and I wasn't disappointed. It was superb as were the scallops I had as a starter. We were seated upstairs where the food was  and presented by the wait staff pretty much beside the table which was a nice touch.

Felidia is definitely for those with coin, not just the prices for food and wine, but the whole ""show"" is designed for those who are into the design of the food rather than the quantity or flavor.Things started off fabulous as we ran smack into Lidia Bastianich as we walked to our table!! The real deal and stopped and said hello and complimented her on her TV show and our time at Eataly, her Italian gourmet food store/eating experience that's a MUST!The rest of the time there was a C+ experience of small plates, boring service and very good wine. The waiters seemed far too distracted for a place where two entrees, a salad and a couple of glasses of wine totalled $150. The pasta was good but no better than many other much less famous Italian joints.

3.0,9/5/2016,"This would have been a four review had it been more reasonably priced, but I was disappointed by the meal and didn't really get the experience we were hoping for.  TBF, we are not New Yorkers, and we certainly looked like we weren't.  I was visiting from Chicago, and my parents live in Jersey - we were coming into the city for my mother's birthday.  I had made a reservation long before we came in, and had told them that it was my mother's birthday.  As soon as they seated us, my father pointed out that it was very clear that we didn't have ""clout.""  Despite the reservation put in weeks earlier, and the fact that we were early, they gave us what was clearly the worst table in the house - right next to the server's station and a wide doorway, so silverware was clanking in our ears and at several points throughout the meal servers or customers walked by us and accidentally brushed our arms with their thighs.  At one point my sister actually had her elbow jolted by a server.  I understand that every restaurant has a worst table and someone has to sit there, but I was hoping at least a bit of a better table given that we had a reservation and it was a special occasion.We each got the tasting menus - my parents got the vegetarian version, and I got the regular and told them I had no dietary restrictions. Most of the other people in the restaurant seemed to get the prix fixe, and to be honest their food smelled and looked a whole lot better than what we got. Our meal started out well, with a delicious and wonderfully composed salad with lots of flavors, but it went downhill from there.  We did get a plate of their signature pear ravioli, which was nice but unremarkable.  My parents later got some regular cooked vegetables with barely any seasoning whatsoever (literally less than a dollar's worth of ingredients just thrown in a plate with about three minutes of preparation), and I got the most terrible quail dish - extremely overcooked, with a layer of pancetta and cheese, of all things, melted on top.  Overcooked quail with melted cheese on top!  ugh.  When it arrived to my table I couldn't help but think it was a joke, since it was so out of place with the restaurant's style and everything else - it looked like something you'd get at Chili's.  This dish was so horrible and it ruined my whole meal.  This restaurant is definitely a solid meh.  I know this is the soft spot on Lydia's empire, but we would have gotten a better meal if we had just spent $60 on grocery at her store, Eataly and thrown it together at home.   It was later explained to me that New Yorkers never get tasting menus - that chefs usually take the leftovers from the kitchen and throw it onto the tasting menu, and that usually prix fixes are collections of their best dishes.  Maybe that's true, so now I know.  Overall, cold service and a very average, overpriced meal.  Really great desserts, if you're into that sort of thing (not too sweet) and great wine selection.",5,2,0,Sam K.,"Chicago, IL",183,238,7

5.0,7/9/2016,"I've been to lots of restaurants where $$$$ clearly is just tied to the literally price of the items, and the food quality nor the service match up to that pricing indicator. Felidia was by far one of the best restaurants that both quality of food and quality of service went hand and hand and the price tag was 100% worth the while. This is pretty fancy place. The type where men are pretty much all wearing a jacket to dinner. I was a bit unprepared for this, and felt underdressed, but the staff didn't make me feel out of place at all. They treated me just like anyone else. It was awesome. Upon arrival, culinary queen Lidia Bastianich was sitting at the bar. I knew this place had to be good...and then about 10 mins into being there I put it together and realized, she is the Lidia in Felidia, and this was her restaurant. So that said a lot to me that someone like her is visiting her restaurants and probably making sure that things are always high quality. I hadn't done much research on this place, as it was recommended to me by one of my go-to wine guys and I just trusted his reco. Boy glad I did. The wine list is supreme. So many options from Italy and beyond. The tuna tartar appetizer special was delicious and fresh. Then we opted to split two entree items, the pear and pecorino ravioli AKA heaven on a plate, and the roasted cod special over a white wine caper sauce and garlic potatoes, AKA take me back to the European seafood wonderland. Yes, to say the least we were in love with our food. It was a go big or go home night, and the desserts, one a burrata cheesecake, and the other peach and berry crumble tart were excellent! Our dinner was paced perfectly start to finish. Never once were our glasses of wine empty, we never were rushed from one course to the next, we got to sit, chat, eat, and be civilized and didn't feel like were just another set of mouths that they were trying to rush through a meal.

It was a rainy evening, we arrived and were greeted, and promptly taken to our table. The room is stunning, quiet, serene, and classic, and not very large.  It was quiet enough that you could actually talk, which can sometimes be rare these days. A wonderful setting to celebrate such an event. From the beginning to the end, everything exceeded our expectations. The sommelier (Jeff?) was a highlight of the evening, offering interesting selections for us that were within our budget, and even brought us some delicious after dinner drinks for our parents' birthday. His presence was a highlight in our visit, and we absolutely loved his selections and his knowledge. It's a joy to be around people who love what they do, and it shows.The handmade pastas are hands-down the best pastas I've ever had. We had chicken liver starters, all of the small plates, fried olives, burrata, and many more courses. We all had different pastas, my mom has a pear ravioli at the suggestion of our waiter which was a highlight. Our waited was charming, I think it was the first night of being a captain as he told us, and his service was perfect. The desserts blew us away! All of them incredibly complex,but also not very sweet, more rustic and delicious textures. We had also had the burrata cheesecake, not to be missed. They wrote a wonderful Happy Birthday note to our parents on a  plate with cookies and brought it out to the table. We ordered after dinner Champagne, again the sommelier led us in the perfect direction, and we very much loved what he selected.It was the perfect dinner, and the highlight of our trip to NYC for our parents' birthday. The other highlight was for brunch at MOMA, but Felidia's has a special place in our memories.

The course was presented as a salad with mushrooms, grana, and a vegetable and pistachio vinaigrette.All in all, the food here is reliable and well-balanced.

I have no problem spending a lot on a meal, but only if it is worth it and in my opinion this just simply was not. My husband and I each ordered a manhattan which was really not that great. We did not specify a type of whisky, so that was our mistake, but at $18 a pop you assume that a quality whisky will be used. It was clear that it was not. By the end of the dinner, it had given me a headache.The bread was brought out with a white bean and pea pesto, which was very lovely and tasty. My husband and I shared a pasta appetizer with spicy red sauce and ricotta cheese. This was pretty ok The paste was homemade, the sauce had pretty good flavor, the ricotta was fresh. For an entree, I ordered the risotto special with morel mushrooms and zucchini blossoms. They were kind enough to make it with vegetable broth because I am a vegetarian. The risotto, however, was severely lacking flavor and was just really boring. I ate about half of it and asked for salt to give it something and even then only took a few more bites. My husband wasn't impressed with his entree either. He ordered the pork chop and just found it lacking flavor. My parents were equally not that impressed with their entrees as well. I am typically a dessert person, but after that meal I just wasn't that enthused to order any. This is weird for me. It was my mother's birthday in addition to it being mother's day, and the staff brought out a complimentary plate of cookies with the dessert my mom ordered. That was very thoughtful. Overall, the service was impeccable. I felt very taken care of and attended to and everyone did it with a smile on their face. I just wasn't super impressed with the food.

The menu looked so appetizing that I couldn't chose so we went with the 5-course meal. I started off with a fresh raw seafood plate- delicious! Then we had pear and cheese ravioli, which at first I was a bit thrown off by, but once I tasted it, I was blown away. Beyond delicious, and different. Then we had a pappardelle with pork (I think). Which was fantastic. And the 4th course was a grilled Branzino with veggies. The waiter brought it over, showed us, and then began to skin the fish with a knife and spoon, right next to our table. He did a wonderful job. I only had a few bones left in mine which was expected. The taste of the fish was indescribable. So moist, definitely cooked to perfection. There was so much fish that I barely had room for the vegetables. For the 5th course, they brought over several types of desserts.

I understand a 5-10 minute difference given uncertainty but we would have gone elsewhere if they had told us it would be an hour wait.

Anyway, we were promptly seated by the lovely hostess and given water & menu by the captain (our server).

We inquired about a possible wine pairing and the sommelier (Jeff) came up with fantastic wines to go with each dish (even dessert).The captains tasting menu (5 courses). You basically can pick 2 apps/ 2 different pastas / and a main course from the menu to share. We picked the octopus app and beef tripe app. Both were tasty and excellent. The wine pairing made them taste even better. The two pastas were freshly made and delicious. We selected the lamb chops as our main course and they were perfect.

The seafood pasta was AMAZING - almost as good as the truffle risoto that my mom had (and I taste-tested). Both are highly recommended by me. The best dish was the tartufo that they serve for desert- there are no words... Above all, the service was beyond.

2.0,1/27/2016,"SLOW FOOD!Felidia has been our special occasion restaurant for about 15 years, so our anniversary dinner last night was a surprising letdown.  We had not specified a table in our reservation, so were seated upstairs for the first time.  The lighting was bright and the noise level deafening, augmented by shrieks from a party of five drunken bachelorettes.  Service was good initially, then deteriorated to friendly but erratic and negligent. We first ordered a puntarelle salad to share (described as chicory with pecorino and anchovy dressing and black pepper, usually a piquant, flavorful salad). It arrived fridge-cold with a watery, bland dressing, like coleslaw.  There was no discernible pecorino or black pepper and a lone small anchovy fillet garnish was the only hint of that flavor.  The vegetable did not appear to be or taste like puntarelle (it was thickly sliced and tasted like the chunk of broccoflower that I found in the mix). We probably should have sent it back.  We then waited for over an hour for our main courses to arrive and during that time were ignored and not told of the reason for the delay.  We were seated next to a service and finishing station and passed the time watching the waiters prepare the food being relayed to two large parties seated on our level. After an hour, we finally flagged down the head waiter, who was devoting most of his attention to these parties.  He  was apologetic and eventually urged ""chef"" downstairs to expedite our order.  The entrees, when they arrived, were excellent (a tiny portion of duck pappardelle) and good (a large portion of too-thickly sliced and a bit chewy rare liver with onions and polenta crepe).  The excellent dessert we ordered (palacinke crepe with poached pear and ice cream) was left sitting on the service counter an arm's reach from our table, with the ice cream starting to melt because our particular waiter was occupied. We had to call the maitre'd over to get it.  Coffee was excellent and we were given a little bag of cookies to go. On presentation of the check, the maitre'd asked about our experience and we were frank about the service problems  (I didn't have the heart to complain about the puntarelle, though I overheard a guest next table say that his pork chop had been dry) . My husband and I both worked in the restaurant business and know that delays happen. Information and attention would have been enough to smooth things over.  To his credit, he whisked our bill away and removed the price of a glass of wine.  We've had many good experiences here and it is not impossible that we would return at some point (though would specify a downstairs table), but yesterday was a disappointment.",0,0,0,Elaine T.,"Kent, CT",0,5,0

Also, waitstaff was very conscientious about my husband's nut allergy, and also gave him lamb chops (not on the regular menu), when the pork chop sold out, without any hesitation.  Will the waiters vamp and schmooze you?  No, but the service was impeccable, with no poor attitude, as other reviewers have criticized.

5.0,12/28/2015,"Our Christmas Eve dinner choice, and Santa himself could not have delivered a better gift!  To begin, the restaurant is cozy, quaint and picturesque with a nice view of 58th Street from the panoramic window on the second floor.  Granted the atmosphere was a little on the noisy side as there was a very large party seated in the room directly behind the wall from our table, and they were clearly enjoying their Christmas Eve experience as well.  The tables are also somewhat close together, and we were able to hear the entire conversation of the gentlemen seated next to us (in reality we were close enough to have participated had we chosen).  However, NONE of that could diminish the most spectacular Italian Christmas Eve meal (save those made years ago by my grandmother, of course).  We opted for the five fish meal (seven just seemed too greedy), and each course was more amazing than the last.  Beginning with succulent clams casino and crudo, we sampled an indescribable seafood and pasta bisque, chitarra pasta with octopus, and a branzino entrée which literally melted in our mouths!  The staff did an outstanding job of pairing both whites and reds with the meal, and were attentive yet unobtrusive throughout the meal.  Lidia Bastianich has hit the mark with Felidia and we will most certainly be back again...Christmas or otherwise!",1,0,0,Tara V.,"Springfield, VA",78,26,0

4.0,11/30/2015,"We had a lovely tasting lunch at Felidia.  I love Lidia Bastianich, I have a few of her cook books and one of her dishes is my go-to ""having company over"" dishes, so I was very excited to dine at her first restaurant.  Overall, I'd really give Felidia a 4.5, but since Yelp doesn't give half stars, I have to go with the 4 star option.  For food, I'd say Felidia is a 5.  The homemade pasta is out of this world.  For our first course, my husband had the Tagliatelle, which is his favorite, and it was delicious (I stole a bite).  I had the scallops, which were also very good.  For our second dish, I chose the Ahi, which was supposed to be prepared on the rare side.  When I got my dish, it was more towards the medium-rare side than a traditional rare ahi steak, no biggie.  My husband had the veal, which was also very good.  We both had a few great glasses of wine, Felidia has a wide selection of awesome Italian reds.  For atmosphere, I'd actually give Felidia a 3.5, only because of the other guests that seem to frequent this place.  It was truffle week (yay!) which we didn't opt for the truffle tasting menu, which drew in a crowd that I could have sworn weren't real people, but characters in a movie.  There was an obnoxiously loud table of 2, yep, just 2 people, loudly gushing over their truffle tasting menu.  The woman was hooting and hollering about her food, it totally ruined my groove thang at Felidia.  Also, in our section, here two business men hashing out some details of a deal and cursing up a storm.  I have a mouth on me something good, but when eating such a lovely meal I'd prefer less Fbombs, more casual, normal volume ambiance.  Totally not Felidia's fault, it may be the day-to-day clientele they attract.  For service, 4.5 stars.  Our servers were great, prompt with service, and professional.  We waited a little longer than I'd like for our check, we had a plane to catch.  Overall, strong 4.5 for Felidia.  Allora....",2,1,1,Maile F.,"Redlands, CA",62,74,3
4.0,11/28/2015,"Good food but a little pretentious. I've eaten at some amazing places and while the food at Felidia was tasty the service was a little cold. We were seated next to a group of about 8 and then a table of what seemed to be Wall Street spenders came in so our little two top ordering wine by the glass apparently didn't warrant the attentiveness of other tables. With that being said the food was very tasty and they have a dedicated staff working tirelessly on their extensive wine list and pairings for their meals. The menu took a minute to figure out and once we did figure it out noticed it wasn't as extensive as I would have guessed. It is broken up by sections of surf, turf, pasta, and sides with each section having a couple of starter options and then entrees. Then the tasting menu options at the back. If I were to come back I'd try the tasting menu since it's likely the best way to experience what they have to offer.We had a few starters and then pasta as our main dishes since we weren't overly hungry. The bread and bean/pesto they give you for the table was a nice touch and quite tasty. I had the Vitello Tonnato which was just so so and my wife had the quail half portion which was also just ok. The waiter kept trying to upsell us which was a little off-putting since it was so relentless.For our mains she tried the Cacio e Pere which while tasty ate a little sweet for my liking. She did enjoy it so if that's your thing it's definitely worth a try. I had the spinach pappardelle with the braised duck and it was delicious. The duck was incredibly flavorful and paired well with spinach pasta. All in all a very satisfying dish and one that I would gladly order again. Felidia definitely has some good food and an extensive wine list. I just didn't care so much for the atmosphere/service so not sure I'd go back nor if I'd recommend it to a friend.

1.0,11/19/2015,"Went here for my fiance's birthday dinner this past Saturday after reading the yelp reviews and having family and friends rave about this place based on their past experiences.  The one star was for the fact that they were nice and could accommodate a party of 8.  However, being a large party, we were subject to the chef's tasting menu.  We were assured that the vegetarians would be accommodated to and there was an honest attempt on their part to do so.  However, every course, but one and the dessert, were extremely unsatisfying and remarkably bad.  The first appetizer course was an artichoke salad that was completely bland and slimy.  The second appetizer course was forgettable.  The first main pasta was a pear ravioli which was the best thing that we had that night.  The second main course they served us penne pasta with tomato sauce. The pasta itself was extremely undercooked (one of dishes had crunchy pasta) and the tomato sauce was too sweet!  The third main course was an over salted polenta dish with burnt mushrooms.  Dessert was okay but nothing to write home about.  For paying almost $200 per person (including the vegetarians who were served simple pasta with tomato sauce that wasn't event cooked right) and for a restaurant that associates itself with some of the best in NY (i.e., Babbo), one would think that the food would be amazing.  Instead, I left hungry and thinking we would have been better off grabbing a $3 slice of pizza or two.",0,0,0,Sneha S.,"Chicago, IL",44,2,0

The staff gave us glasses of prosecco on the house while we were waiting, which we appreciated.Once seated, they served us a free appetizer course (I assume for our long wait) and they took into account the vegetarians at the table. It was a squash dish with greens and really wonderful.For our meal, we decided on getting 3 pasta entrees and sharing between the 3 of us. That turned out to be a great decision. We ordered the Cacio E Pere (pear and pecorino-filled ravioli--delicate and savory at the same time), chocolate ravioli filled with squash, burrata, and  served with sage (very savory but heavy/filling), and the Candele (spicy rosemary tomato sauce and ricotta). We loved all 3 of them but were glad to have shared--I don't think I could have eaten an entire bowl of the chocolate ravioli because it was so rich. The staff even told us in which order we should eat the pastas and even split our first dish for us in three separate bowls. The pear ravioli was the favorite.For dessert we had sorbet and gelati in a hard chocolate shell. They also gave us a little tray of pistachio cookies and a paper bag of little spiced cakes.

The restaurant had been redesigned which was fine but we all found the decore to be quite cold especially compared to the warmth of the previous furnishings. We also found the newly reformatted menu very confusing and challenging to pick out what we wanted. The menu is divided out by land, sea, pasta and the like. The items that have two prices are available as an appetizer and entree. So you have to pick through everything to figure it out- not impossible but just more work than we wanted to put in. The service wasn't quite as top notch as usual, for instance we needed to ask for bread. Having said the above, the food is great and the restaurant is still wonderful.

After a wonderful dinner experience, I would agree, and add that it is suitable for almost any occasion--- e.g. business, date, lunch.The menu is classic Northern Italian (table-served, whole Branzino + crudo di manzo) with flare (ambitious truffle-menu) and a few pleasant surprises (Cacio i pere... a remarkable, can't-miss twist on the classic cacio i pepe, with pear!)Above all, however, was the service, particularly the sommelier, Jeff. I  ultimately chose Felidia on this occasion because of the impressive wine list offered, and can honestly say Jeff made the evening so much more enjoyable for both my guest and myself. There were wine pairings offered, but we asked our somm to pair with our dishes at his discretion, and were so pleased. The wines were spectacular, but moreover, we enjoyed learning about the origin of the wines (Jeff had just returned from the region), the pairing process to each unique dish, and specifically, how to best enjoy should we wish to buy any of the wines later.

5.0,10/17/2015,"Wow.It's rare that an Italian restaurant blows my mind (I think the last was Bestia in LA, back in 2013). It's rarer still that my experience there is so good, I have to write about it less than 24 hours later (usually, it takes much longer).This wasn't even a perfect dining experience. But the few hiccups were eclipsed by the many, many highlights. Here's the breakdown:Starter: Housemade Burrata with Vegetables and Crisp Kale- We opted for this special because it sounded too good to resist. I love burrata, and I love housemade cheeses, so housemade burrata is a no-brainer. Its texture was perfect and the tart, flavorful vegetables housed beneath it were the perfect companionsEntree: Three shared dishes of the Cacio E Pere, the Chocolate Ravioli and the Pappardelle - Cacio E Pere: A pear and fresh pecorino-filled ravioli dish served with aged pecorino and crushed pepper. I normally detest sweet things in savory entrees, but the pears here were so fresh and so well complemented by the cheese and sauce, that the entire dish worked- Chocolate Ravioli: Cocoa-infused ravioli stuffed with winter squash, served in a brown butter sage sauce. Just phenomenal and surprisingly not the least bit sweet- Pappardelle: The best of the bunch. Perfectly al dente strings of fat spinach pappardelle, served with braised and shredded moulard duck and mushrooms. So many of my favorite things in one dish, it was enough to make my head spinDessert: Tortino di Zucca All'olio- Pumpkin olive oil cake flavored with Venetian spices, and served with amaretto ice-cream. Words cannot express the depth of my love for olive oil cake, and this was no exception. Soft, moist, warm, and all the almond flavor one could wantDrinks: Donna Brigante, Marsala Coppler- Both delicious in their own way, but the Donna Brigante seemed more fittingly Italian with its generous pours of CampariHiccups: Just a few- Not having Lambrusco when I really, really wanted that to accompany my meal. The sommelier was very nice and suggested a reasonable alternative, but I love my pure Emilian Lambrusco and will accept no substitutes- Giving us the bill when we hadn't asked for it yet--and weren't even done dessert + post-dinner drinks yet. They tried to make up for it by saying we could take our time, but this is one of my greatest pet peeves at a restaurant. I don't care how busy you are: unless you have a stated time limit for meals, you do not rush your diners- Trying to take away the bill when we clearly hadn't paid yet--because we were still finishing our drinks.

5.0,8/27/2015,"Best new restaurant I tried on this NY trip. The restaurant itself has a very laid back and cozy atmosphere with dim lighting; I can see why many reviewers said they have to wait if they have a later reservation. It is very easy to lose track of time while sitting in the restaurant. We opted for the 5 course tasting menu which consists of an antipasto, 2 pasta dishes, a secondi, and dessert. Unlike many other restaurants, it was not a separate menu for the tasting or a set menu, so we got to pick dishes from the actual menu. My relative and I decided to try different dishes so we could taste more dishes! Antipasto--Polipo- omg... it was absolutely delicious. The octopus was so tender yet had a charing on the outside that created a textural component to the dish. It was perfectly plated with tomatoes, cucumbers, and a vinegrette.- Fagiolini e Ricotta - very interesting dish. The ricotta added a creaminess to the dish and everything went surprisingly well.- They also gave us a complimentary tasting of another dish which had asparagus and thin slices of prosciutto on top.  Pasta-- Minestra Di Pesce - who knew that a seafood broth could be so flavorful?! I truly tasted the ocean in each spoonful of this soup. It is more of a seafood soup with pieces of pasta- Cacio E Pere - The description says ""pear and fresh pecorino - filled ravioli"". I will have to admit, I was a bit hesitant when we ordered this and I was not sure if I would like it or what to expect. However, I was very surprised at how delectable this dish was. The pear was tender and added just a slight hint of the pear taste and also a textural component. I will definitely be ordering this dish in the future.Secondi-- branzino - I will have to say that this was the least impressive dish of the night. Yes, the fish was cooked to perfection but it just seemed like a dish I could get somewhere else. - Manzo - this is a steak dish and it was so scrumptious. The steak was tender and juicy. For the secondi, I would order this dish againDessert-I got the burrata cheesecake which was pretty small... I wanted a larger piece! That is my only complaint. They also have 2 levels of wine pairing that they offer with the tasting menu, the first option is an additional $50, and the second is a $90+ wine pairing menu. We opted for the $90+ wine pairing and 3/6 wines ended up on my to buy list... however, sadly, 2/3 that I enjoyed are not available in the US.",8,5,8,Connie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",757,508,2347

He knew just what to serve with each course, to bring out more in the dish, and some interesting notes/changes to the wines themselves. We were super impressed and will definitely be back.

The tiramisu came in a little coffee cup and was out of this world.  They also brought us a complimentary plate of homemade cookies with a candle and ""Happy 50th Anniversary"" spelled out in icing.  We had a really great experience there, and look forward to coming back again",0,0,0,Tony C.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",0,12,0

5.0,4/1/2015,"Sooooo........ This was the most amazingly surreal, excited, delightfully delicious, celebrityish experience of my adult life. Yes, I made up a word and I'm sticking with it. Ok. Hold on people...... My name is Felidia Maddi. On my 33rd birthday, I finally was blessed with the opportunity to visit the restaurant of the person whom I was named after. I grew up watching Felidia Bastianich on PBS(she goes by Lidia, I dont). Every Saturday I would lay on my living room floor in Queens watching this lady with this thick Italian accent take me on a tantalizing cultural journey through the cities and countryside of her beautiful country.  So, how'd I get the name? You ask. My father worked at Felidias back in 1981 when she was renovating the place for her opening and my mother was pregnant with me. He brought home some napkins and matches one day and my mother fell in love with the name. Fast forward 29 years and I am getting ready to open my first restaurant. One day while searching the Internet for names, I come across Felidias website and found her signed name and picture on one of the pages. In that moment, I was frozen, elated, awestruck, humbled, amazed. In that moment I knew I had to get there. Not only did the restaurant have my name, but it's owned by the woman I am named after and had been watching for years. I tried to make it there for my 30th birthday. That didn't work out. For my 31st birthday I got all the way to the city and the crowd I was with was unsure so we chose somewhere else. I was pissed. Finally I decided that 2015 I was visiting come hell or high water.You guys, I MADE IT!!!!! IT WAS PHENOMENAL!!!!! Ok so I might be a little bit bias because of the whole awestruck thing but I am definitely honest.When we walked in we were greeted by the beautiful matradi Cynthia. She was excited that I had finally arrived. We (my husband and I) made reservations for 6:30 pm but arrived closer to 7 pm. Cynthia said they were all excited to know that I was coming. They had a special table intelligently positioned so we could see everything. And we did. The staff was knowledgeable, warm, and attentive. The soft whisper of rosemary and garlic and goodness tickled my sense of rememberance. I will never forget this. Complimentary sparkling wine to began. A medley of crusty and nutty breads with a creamy basil and olive oil based spread with cannellini  beans and other bits of fun (so good I asked to take some home). The Antipasto was sexy. Slices of grape flat bread, fresh homemade mozzarella and perfectly poised slivers of prosciutto engaged yet another sensory cortex further entangling me in the excitement of the experience. For our second course we shared portions of her perfectly poised pasta creations. Our dessert was complimentary and my favorite was the Nutella cake topped with a light pistachio icecream. To top off my perfect birthday celebration. Felidia Bastianich herself told her staff to present me with an autographed copy of her latest book which all the staff signed. PRICELESS.

Dinner was a prix fixe of four courses, and we both enjoyed the meal tremendously.  Some nit-picky noticeables: the food could have been hotter (temperature wise), repeated asks for new silverware between courses, a black napkin would have been preferable to a white one, the champagne came after the stroke of midnight (we don't drink so it did not really matter). The service was good but not amazing.  Our waiter was flat and did not check on us.

Gelati is supposed to be creamy and rich but this was the opposite. My wife got a tart that came with a scoop of sorbet. The talk was good but the sorbet also had no flavor.

I was feeling like pasta so I got the Bianconeri Alla Trapanese, which is BLACK AND WHITE BAVETTE with CALAMARI and TRAPANESE PESTO - all delicious and beautifully plated.Highlights: CHICKEN LIVER dish! This dish came in two forms, which I love! It gives everyone at the table options. One option was a pate that was whipped into a mousse-like texture and paired with super thin bread. Don't know what kind of bread it was but it was very thinly sliced and crunchy. Just enough to hold the pate but not fill you up with carbs. The second option was sliced up chicken liver and cooked in a creamy rich white sauce - rich and delicious!Cute place for a nice and quiet dinner with friends, family, or significant other.

2.0,2/20/2015,"I am not sure what the big deal is about Lydia in general  but  now that I have been to her restaurant which is as overpriced as it is underwhelming --I can say  she is just lucky to have an older bejeweled Upper East side matronly  clientele who do not know really know what Italian food is supposed to taste like. For the prices, I would rather eat at Eataly where at least the pasta is not mushy and not served in a pretentious setting.  Lydia, for your edification, Punterelle should not be on your menu if they taste like tough celery.  They are supposed to have a bit of bite and tang. They are not supposed to be less bland than celery.   Putting burrata with no flavor on top of it with 2 anchovies with no olive oil is not charming.  The punterelle are supposed to be made with anchovy paste and olive oil but i guess that would not sell to skeletal Upper East Siders who are terrified by olive oil.  And if I wanted a salad with water on the bottom of my plate, i could have  easily done that at home. If you need to find good punterelle, go to rome and there is a place near campo dei fiori and maybe the chef  can give you a hint as to the proper preparation. As for the pasta, it's overcooked spinach pappardelle and the duck ragu needs salt.  Many people who rave about your restaurant rave about the soft pasta and I wonder how much mac and cheese they have eaten in their lives. The person who I was eating with also had an underwhelming vitello tonnato and pasta with cinghiale. Lastly, if you can't cook a plate of pasta that is not scotta  (overcooked) then at least make better desserts. We ordered some lemon crepe that had zero personality and little flavor and were brought a tiramisu didn't have any coffee flavor but can only be described as bland chocolate pudding pops as you would get with New York City school lunches.  The cookie plate you can keep.  I have had better cookies from Stella D'Oro. Not sure why you bother. Those pistachio things are gummy and really a gruesome green color.I would also suggest that your waiters bring a drink menu over before they offer you a glass of ludicrous champagne that ends up costing you $28.  I would not have minded the cost of the champagne if the meal had been anywhere near good or innovative.  Innovation was not even attempted on that menu. If I wasn't from Emilia - Romagna and hadn't eaten in many better places all my life at less absurd prices, I would not be commenting but you have built an empire on your cooking and really, there is no excuse for the culinary experience to flounder at any table where the bill is over $200.   It's amazing how everyone fawns over this place and it's cuisine; it's neither interesting nor innovative and it would seem to me that you are a fraud resting perhaps on your past laurels.",1,1,0,Daniela R.,"New York, NY",4,11,1
1.0,2/19/2015,"I went there with my girlfriend on Valentine's Day evening for their set course meal set at $120 per person. We were seated 15 minutes after our reservation time but at one of the three tables in the waiting area!! I have been to this restaurant several times in the past few years, and I don't recall having tables at the waiting area. The result was, I was sitting there for over 3 hours watching bunch of people waiting and standing within a feet from my table. Sometimes I felt like the crowd was watching me eat. It was as if I was eating in the waiting area of a popular but crowded Chinese dim sum restaurant! It was very uncomfortable.Then the wait: how can a 3-course meal last for over 3 hours?! Our waitress came in and out and did not even take our orders until 30 to 40 minutes later. In fact, the person who actually took our order was the manager, it seemed. Some people who sat down much later than we did got their main course and finished it before we finish our appetizer. No, my girlfriend and I were not slow eaters!The dessert...oh wait, the waitress brought my check...before my dessert even arrived?! She did apologize, but if the restaurant was charging $120 per person for a meal, it should make sure that its service was at that level and that it was not under-staff.Despite many people waiting, it took another 20 minutes or so before I could get a manager to give me my check. The night was supposed to be fun and romantic, and customers paid the price for that experience, but clearly, the restaurant did not deliver that night.My feeling was not unique. The table right next to us had the same feeling: if everyone in the restaurant was paying the same price per person that night, why did we get an inferior seating area (the waiting area), and why we were not told such was the case at the time of the reservation?! Also, while the food quality was okay, why was our service so bad on a Valentine's night? This was simply unfair treatment. I hope this had nothing to do with the fact that both me and my girlfriend were Asians. I paid 10% tips at the end just to be polite, but I really thought even 10% was way too much.As a side note, my girlfriend was harassed some months ago on the subway where a guy secretly (or not so secretly) took multiple pictures of her using his cell phone. She went up to him, took a picture of him, and demanded that he erase those pictures. The passengers nearby also saw how he took those pictures and asked him to delete them, but he denied that he did. In fact, he told her in response that she was a very beautiful woman. The nearby-passengers and my girlfriend got into a verbal fight with him. At the end, my girlfriend went to a police station and filed a report. The punchline: one of the people who picked up the dirty dishes from the table that night was this guy!! My girlfriend double-checked at least twice. She left the place in fear. While I don't expect the restaurant to do a background check on all its employees, how comfortable would you be if you know someone working there sexually harassed women.Given this situation, I don't think I will ever come back to this restaurant or recommend it to anyone.",2,1,1,Samuel L.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,7,0

If I thought other tables weren't looking I would have licked the dish it was served in.  All of the bread served were very tasty  - my favorite was a pignoli bread.  The pastas were soft and absolutely delicious - my favorite was a chocolate ravioli stuffed with winter squash.  My main meal was a veal chop served on a bead of spinach - it was delicious especially if you like it on the rare side.The views from our second floor table were street level and awesome.  The bar downstairs was tight but everyone was absolutely friendly and super professional.  I can tell you that the prices were on the moderate high side but that shouldn't bother you -it's worth what we paid for and we will be going back.  So should you,1,0,0,Eric F.,"Long Valley, NJ",129,152,29
2.0,2/15/2015,"Last night, Valentines Day, was our first dining experience at ""Felidia."" As I can leave a positive comment on the food being that it was delicious, beautifully set up, and correctly portioned, I cannot unfortunately say the same with the service, primarily to the two hostess. Firstly, right when you walk into the restaurant to your left there are three small tables which seat two, right next to the window. You would think those tables were for enjoying a drink/appetizer waiting to experience the actual environment of the restaurant. Sadly, this was not the case. Even though we made a reservation almost a month and a half in advance and arrived on time, we were being seated in the dark corner where those three tables for two were placed. We approached the hostess and asked nicely if we could please move our seat into the actual dining room. The hostess replied that we would have to wait 45 minutes to an hour ONLY if she will be able to find us a table, as if changing our seats wouldn't even be an option. We had the Pre-fix Valentines Day menu which was almost $130 dollars PER person. You would think that you can sit in the actual dining area when your almost paying $300 for dinner. Since we were sitting in the corner behind a window and near the entrance, the only view we had was the numerous amount of people waiting to be seated and surprisingly a lot of very unhappy customers due to hearing their complaints. Even though it was nice that they had a coat check, since we were by the entrance of the restaurant, it was very cold with the continuous opening and closing of the doors. The two couples that sat beside my fiancé and I were complaining about the draft as well. My main concern is why they would put three tables in the corner of the restaurant KNOWING that the tables weren't even in the actual environment of the restaurant where other tables were placed. Is it because they are that desperate to make a profit? That they would rather make money then risk losing a customer? If we paid almost $300 dollars for dinner why couldn't we sit in the actual dining room? Shouldn't we deserve the right to have the whole fine dining experience just like everyone else?

4.0,12/22/2014,Enjoyed a very nice Saturday dinner here.  We sampled the broccoli di rape e zucca and the cacio e pere (pear and pecorino ravioli) and the manzo braised flat iron steak and the other entrée was a very rich seafood stew prepared tableside.Dessert was killer.  A nutella cake with pistachio ice cream.  The house also gave us various tiny cookies on a plate and that is probably standard No cocktails-just sparkling water.  Dinner came to about $176 without tip for two of us.Location/Misc Comments1.  If you are in NYC at a peak tourist time and plan on requiring a cab to or from the location you will want to plan at least 30-45 minutes in advance of your reservation.  2.  Study the menu online in advance.  The staff is very nice but our server was vague and had a heavy accent which may Q&A a little more difficult than we expected.3.  Request in your reservation that you DO NOT want to sit near the bar and coat check.  The tables are in a bad spot and we wished we had a quieter location.  A huge disruptive xmas party was breaking up and people were literally brushing our table getting their coats from coatcheck.  Not good!4. Coffee and bread were not replenished or offered.  I thought it a little strange to not be offered or asked-not that we needed it but the service seemed a little off. 5. If you are a big eater or generally hungry you are going to need to order a few items/courses here.  The food is superb but minimal in proportion-one entree will not suffice unless you pair it with some other appetizers or pasta.,1,0,0,Joe B.,"Beverly Hills, CA",1,104,21

5.0,12/3/2014,"Hi friends. I have been to Felidia a bunch over the years. But I have to tell you that I probably had the best meal of 2014 here this last week. It wasn't just good and it wasn't just excellent, it was simply a gastronomic treat worthy of the hype that has been generated by the reviewers who flock to this place. Was gonna order off the regular menu, but the tasting option looked so intriguing that I took a chance. I don't like tasting menus normally because you have to choose from the ""column A and column B"" thing. When I commented on this, our server said  ""No, sir, you get it all"". That's right, the whole gazillions of items on the menu are presented. It was wonderful. There was charcuterie, cheeses, I think; a salad of local cheeses and beets that was just so good, I think my palate is ruined for life. Then brilliant shrimps, and so much more that l, honestly, I can't remember. And that was just the starters. The pasta course has lasagna with probably the best ricotta I have ever had and separately, a pappardelle-like offering with tiny sausage meatballs that were just heaven. Then, the meat offerings, with filet, indescribably delicious baby lamb chops (and you know I am not a lamb fan), beautiful grilled salmon with a creative mustard sauce on the side. Oh, and a brilliant chicken thigh that was succulent and juicy. WOW. Oh, and did I mention the flight of desserts?  Little mini cannoli. Chocolate cake and a plate of cookies. All for $65 bucks per. In Manhattan. Yay.  PLUS, the staff was so friendly, explaining each course and extremely attentive.

4.0,10/10/2014,"It was a Sunday 6:30 reservation, and the bar - the only thing you see when you enter - was empty. I looked to the right, and the silence was the product of a nearly empty dining room. Since I follow Lidia on Facebook, I already knew she was basking in the culinary delights of Croatia and Southern Italy the same time we decided to visit her home in NYC. Did everyone know that she wouldn't be there? Is that why there were only four out of 15 tables occupied?After a delightful conversation with John the bartender, who voluntarily recommended some of his favorite dishes, we tiptoed quietly to our table. The decor was simplistic and the furniture felt a bit dated, as if it hadn't changed since opening in the 80s, but we were here for the food. The menu distracted us from the blah-red chairs. Four tasting menu options made the selections more difficult, so instead we just ordered a la carte.The basket of mixed crispy-crust European-style breads was the first sign of quality. A spread of bean paste, olive oil and herbs was more updated than an 80s offering of just butter. After two pieces, I needed to push the basket out of reach so as not to fill up before my appetizer. I would have been easy to accomplish. The first plate to land, the Tutta Crudo, helped to ignore the bread. This first suggestion looked like a Jackson Pollack on a plate made of shaved raw tuna, salmon, branzino, vegetables, puffed rice and shaved horseradish to top it off. The bartender did mention that Executive Chef Fortunato Nicotra was also a painter, and it showed. Yet it wasn't exorbitantly decorated (although I must mention that the pricing seemed a bit exorbitant for the not-4-star Italian restaurant). John stated that everything on Chef's plates are meant to be there for texture, taste profile, color. It's very purposeful, and with every forkful that I stole from my husband's plate, it served me a great purpose while I simultaneously enjoyed a pasta special filled with rabbit meat, topped with carrot and rabbit jus and butter. Not too long after came the grand dame platter of simplicity and flavor: the Gigliata de Pesce - grilled scallops, lobster, calamari, shrimp, octopus, razor clams 'alla piastra', string beans, green onion, sea beans. Even though I knew I would not finish it, happiness abounded knowing I would have more for a second meal the following day. While alternating cutting small pieces from each different piece of seafood, I missed the description of the black sea bass special as the waiter poured a green herb sauce into that bowl. We waited a bit before sharing a single dessert: the palacinke, which is like a caramelized crepe with poached peaches, local sheep milk yogurt, peach salad. Although Lidia was not present to greet us again, we experienced the essence of her style and felt like we raided the fridge in her home.",1,0,0,Evelyn F.,"Bergenfield, NJ",115,28,12

5.0,8/21/2014,"What an absolute treat; one of my aunts wanted to take me out for a (slightly belated) grad school graduation celebration dinner, and we both had such exquisite meals coupled with a warm environment and top-notch hospitality. Though our reservation was at 6:30, the staff sat us when we arrived at 5:45. We had just planned to sit at the bar in the meantime, but we didn't complain! All of the staff we interacted with made us feel at home. Our waiter, outfitted in a gorgeous gray suit with a red tie (so disarmingly dapper) informed us of the night's specials with great passion. It was hard to make decisions, but, in time we succeeded. For appetizers, my aunt ordered prosciutto and figs with huckleberry bread, and I ordered squash blossom tempura with house-made ricotta and smoky tomato dipping sauce. The former is just a classic pairing, but the huckleberry bread really added to it. The squash blossoms were incredible, with a slight hint of that plant-like chlorophyll taste. (I hope that doesn't make it sound unappealing; quite the opposite. I loved it!) Both the sauce and cheese were divine with the blossoms. For entrees, I opted for a popular menu item: Ravioli con Cacio e Pere with cracked black pepper. Each bite was a flavor bomb, and the cheese and pear compliment each other so wonderfully. Though not a huge fan of cracked black pepper, it was not overwhelming and really rounded out the flavors. My aunt got the special ravioli filled with guinea hen; it had an intoxicating sweet yet smoky braised taste to it. For dessert, I went for the crostata with nectarine and apricot, which was a light end of our meals. In addition, the staff treated us to some complimentary biscotti slices and some almond-flavored French macarons with a citrus jelly. I could have eaten an entire plate of the macarons!

The somm helped us pick a lovely 2007 Marion red that was fantastic. Reminded me of a smooth pinot noir or malbec, so it went well with dinner.I would definitely come back again!

They sent over a nice young guy. We explained that we wanted a medium bodied white but no Riesling or Chardonnay - keep it under $100. And how are the Bastianich wines? He steered us away from Lydia's own vineyards (!) and suggested a Chardonnay blend - no thank you - and then a Riesling - really? - both over $100! Then the head sommelier came over - lovely woman with instant know how -  who suggested a medium bodied white from Le Marche. Very nice but didn't taste like the $110 price tag. I appreciate that there is a huge mark up on wines but please instruct your staff to follow your patrons' wishes. We ordered starters, pastas and main dishes. The braised beef special and asparagus with prosciutto starters were great. Then after a pleasant pause two different waiters brought our main dishes. We asked what happened to the pasta? They were flustered and took away the plates. There was a hushed conversation among them and then our main waiter came over and started placing a main dish on the table again. We asked her about the pastas. She said oh, I thought you wanted the pasta last. We all looked at each and said no, primi piatti first. She had clearly forgotten to place our pasta order with the kitchen and was trying to cover up because our mains had come out too soon. Very poor.

Our shared plates were grudgingly delivered without utensils.  Our request to clear the bread service went unheralded.  No one bothered to take our coats.  We ordered the mixed seafood grill.  It was overcooked to the point that we could not extract the meat from the shell.   It's hard to choose the worst default.  Failure to deliver what the kitchen was capable of or simply asking way to much of what the space and staff could handle.  Good seafood delivered competently to the table does not happen here.  So sad.",0,0,0,Sue M.,"Carmichael, CA",0,3,0
4.0,5/13/2014,"Went back to Felidia for my first visit in 20 years. When this still charming converted townhouse opened in 1981, fine Italian dining in NY meant parmigiania & red gravy (local exemplar: Mamma Leone's). Today, food from the motherland is much better presented across america, in part thanks to the great Lidia Bastianich. She put in years of hard work here and at her previous restaurants, travelling far from native Istria to develop an authentic pan-Italian cuisine. Felidia influenced american restaurateurs long before the television renown. She hasn't run this place since the '90s, but Signora Lidia's presence is deeply felt and she still makes occasional appearances.The staff is organized into family-like teams (captain, waiter, runner, busboy). These servers have been here forever and are super professional. They are generally highly attentive and might even ask ""what's wrong"" if you are not obviously enjoying your dish. Your special request will be graciously met _IF_ you ask with respect and patience. My long-delayed return proved you need not be a regular to get good service at Felidia!  Some spoiled Yelpers apparently want bootlicking waiters to fawn over them for primo prices. Those complaining about slow, cold-shoulder service may have disrespected the proud, occasionally aloof senior staff, probably unintentionally...FELIDIA is for special occasions---jackets for men optional, but appreciated. Young money hipsters and model-dating high finance ballers should go elsewhere.  It's an Upper East Side crowd. Fully grown-up tourists welcome too and autographed cookbooks are available on the way out. The vibe here has evolved into relaxed, old school elegance. When there, i noted several multi-generational dinner parties. Today patrons Tutti-a-Tavola here at a mature, leisurely pace. Don't be shy about bypassing Felidia's massive wine list and requesting a bottle priced well under the first suggestion. The low-end wine we drank here was probably better than many of their midrange selections.If your entire dinner party agrees, I recommend 4-course 'Signature' tasting featuring grilled octopus salad, pear ravioli, sliced steak, & tiramisu. We paid $90++/pp with basic vino.  I believe meat options are now the most reliable entrees here. Felidia is indeed over the hill and coasting a bit.

5.0,5/5/2014,"Came here for Mom's 80th with the birthday girl and my siblings.  Of the 3 restaurants mom chose, I was happy that we were going to the one that seemed like I can squeak by with a couple of good gluten-sensitive choices. I am also a big seafood fan, and there looked like there were some really good choices there. Upon learning I had a gluten issue, the first thing they did was bring out the gluten-free crackers/breads. These were amazing. There were 2 choices, one yellowish, and one black one. They both had a distinctive cheese taste to them despite the fact that we were told the black one had no cheese in but, but did have cuttlefish ink. Cuttlefish ink? Really? It was so good, however, that my gluten-friendly siblings ate more of the gluten-free than the ones not meant for me.Their seafood was really good.  The plates were a little small, but not too bad. We all sampled a bit of each plate, and there was not a bad choice in the bunch. Mom's birthday plate had many little tasty baked treats, including a couple of gluten-free options too. My guess is the espresso cookies were particularly good, judging from my sister's sneaky hand grabbing at them whenever she thought no one was looking.It is not a cheap place however. Not the most expensive either, but unless you are dating a CEO of one of the Fortune 500, I don't think this is going to be your ""regular place"".  It has already been suggested that Mom ask we return here for her 85th.",1,0,1,Becki W.,"Somerville, MA",387,146,5
3.0,5/1/2014,"I regret to report that my party of 3 had a less than satisfying experience at Felidia on Thursday, April 24. We had a 2 PM reservation for lunch and were evaluating the wine menu because we planned to enjoy the fixed price lunch with a modest bottle of white wine. So we were debating our food selections. Our wait person learned our wine preferences and suggested she bring us a taste of one of the house wines offered by the glass. We thought this was nice, but the wine was not what we were looking for, consequently, our wait person had the sommelier visit us. The lovely young woman who appeared was a bit abrupt and asked us what kind of wine we liked. I said typically a white Bordeaux but that we also enjoyed a wide variety of Italian wines. She suggested another wine by the glass and the wine list disappeared. The new tasting arrived and we liked that even less. I am not faulting the wines, they might have been perfectly suited for others. We were just seeking a something less fruity and I had no idea of the cost of the wine we had just tasted.   At this point, I requested the wine list back to find out. I knew there were several white wines under 40.00 per bottle. One of the reasons we chose to return to Felidia for this important family lunch was that we had been there before and impressed with the selection of moderate wines. I was determined to select one especially when I discovered that the second wine the sommelier had suggested was 80.00 per bottle. I had informed both our original wait person and the sommelier that we wanted a modest wine, so I was a bit distressed because of this and glad I had the wine list back. I continued to review the wines and the sommelier made various comments about the appropriateness of the various wines under 40.00, and eventually we selected a Sauvignon Blanc. I thanked her for her help.We finished the meal and left with an uncomfortable feeling that had we been more trusting, we would have been sold an 80.00 bottle of wine when we made it quite clear we were trying to avoid spending that much. I respect that Felidia haswines available for all palates, and am curious as to why the sommelier would not support this. As you can see, the experience with the wine overshadowed the lovely meal.  A pity.",1,0,0,Michele C.,"Raleigh, NC",0,31,1

5.0,4/19/2014,"Amazing!!!  My family and I had been a fan of Lydia Bastianich for a very long time, and have been to her other restaurants in the past.  We were saving this place for a special occasion, since let's face it, it isn't really the least expensive one out there.   We decided to finally have dinner here for someone's 60th birthday (2 of the guests we were with had previously dined here), and let me just tell you that it was everything we hoped for and then some.   Our reservation was fairly early,  515 to be exact, so the restaurant was still quiet.   There were only a couple of other tables in the restaurant, and we were seated upstairs.  It was quiet!  So quiet that I feared they would ask my loud Italian family to either keep it down or leave, but no one said a thing.  It took a while for us to quiet down, but the servers did not rush us to place an order.  In fact, they were very patient with my sister-in-law, who changed order a few times.  Our appetizers arrived shortly.  As in 10 minutes later.   I had their bruschetta special, and it was one of the best I have ever had!  It was not like your typical bruschetta with tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, etc.; but with mushrooms and other goodies so delicious, and so perfect, I didn't want it to end.  The others in our group had the ceviche and grilled octopus, and though I don't eat either, they raved that those were also excellent.  More drinks and a few minutes later, the entrees arrived.  I had the seafood dish off the regular menu, a sampler consisting of a lobster tail, scallops, razor clams, shrimp, and octopus; my other half had the veal special with truffles; brother-in-law had the raviolis; and my sister-in-law and her son had a fish dish.   All of us raved about the superb flavors and presentation, while those of us who had the fish gushed about the freshness of each dish.  My seafood dish did not look like much, especially since I don't eat octopus, and for a minute I thought I would still be hungry, but it was just right.   Last was dessert (duh!).  Since we were there to celebrate a birthday, I had called the restaurant ahead to let them know (bonus:  Lydia herself picked up the phone!!!  She thanked me for letting them know, and promised they would do something for the celebrant).  Since I gave up baked goods for Lent, I honestly cannot remember what everyone ordered, but the one that stands out the most was the orange pistachio, which I heard completed the meal, and the plate of cookies for the celebrant.   In place of dessert, I ordered a moscato, which I truly enjoyed.   When I asked our server of its name, he was kind enough to offer to give me the wine information card, which I of course gladly accepted.  Overall, this place was excellent.  The service was impeccable, the ambiance pleasant, and the quality of the food turned us into raving lunatics, eager to recommend it to anyone we encounter (can't you tell?!?!).  Watch out, because we will definitely be back!",0,0,1,Dennise P.,"New York, NY",50,52,635
1.0,4/7/2014,"A true surprise!  For a special occasion for my wife, I took her to her favorite TV chef's restaurant.  When we were seated, we were asked what type of water.  We requested bottled still water.  The waiter came back with an opened bottle of water that was not opened table side.  Later in the evening when the water was getting low, a waiter took the bottle and returned with it full.  I think I got tap water when I requested bottled still and paid for still.  The wine we picked was special to us and when he brought the bottle to our table it was the right one.  Again it was not opened table side but somewhere else.  It was definitely not good.  I then ordered a bottle of the house Chianti hoping that it would be acceptable.  It was barely drinkable.  The dinner was just ok.  Nothing special but the costs at this restaurant were exceptionally high for what you got.  Hoping still the dessert would salvage the evening was to hope in vain.  The waiter brought the wrong dessert.  When I tried to get his attention, I was left unnoticed since the wait staff is too busy talking to the regulars and amongst themselves.  Next time I will save my money, money and the frustration, and go to our favorite Italian restaurant close to home.",0,0,0,Joe G.,"Bellport, NY",0,6,0
2.0,4/6/2014,"Our experience was mixed. The space is lovely, it has a more traditional, clubby, elegant feel. We were three people and they sat us upstairs at a large round table which was very spacious.  I sense the bar would be a nice place to go for a drink. My friends had pasta for starters, and I had the spring greens salad with blue egg carbonara. One friend had the highly recommended Cacio E Pere and she felt it wasn't that special. The other had the Orrecchiette, didn't love hers, with the main complaint was that was very green. It was one color but I didn't taste it. I sense the vegetable sauce overpowered the pasta. I agree it did not look appetizing based upon the color and consistency. My salad was OK, and definitely more of an appetizer size, but didn't wow me. The egg was very tasty and the yolk the perfect consistency. We all really enjoyed our entrees. I had the veal tenderloin, which was expertly prepared. It melted in my mouth. I felt the sauce, vegetables, and starch all worked together perfectly, all the different tastes melding something delicious. I would recommend this and order it again. One friend had the calves liver and really enjoyed it.  The other had the grilled seafood dish and the presentation was lovely. She thought it was quite good. We each had a dessert which was fine, nothing outstanding. The one thing I found odd and a huge turnoff, the wine service. When the server presented the menus, he did not present the wine menu. When I said that I would be having wine with dinner, he asked me if I preferred white or red. I responded that I wasn't sure and would decide when the table was ready to order.  Even then. He didn't offer the wine menu until asked for it. I picked a bottle, $60 white, they didn't have it, the som arrived with a substitution, same varietal but, $35, which I guess is better than a much higher price point, but based upon my initial selection, I would have expected them to offer to show me the list again and assist with a selection, even another varietal, that was at a price point closer to my budget and more in line with the experience I wanted to create. Even when I asked her, her response was that they have 3 other bottles of this varietal and this is the best in their opinion. When we finished the bottle, we were asked if we wanted another glass of something,  again, no wine list, just leave it to them to select something.  We said we'd like to stay with this grape, he said sure, and then so done returned  pouring something else.  This just struck me as incredibly inconsistent with a fine dining experience, or they really assumed I had no idea about wine. I would not go back for this reason alone.",3,1,0,Ellen S.,"New York, NY",8,80,0

So many nice choices, even at $29.95 for three courses.It's a nice space, a bar area, a small room, and a larger room in back. We were seated in a two-top table behind a four-top. Our first mistake.They brought their 'B' game...Bread, in a woven basket, came, along with a big swirl of a nice olive oil. Interesting breads, the walnut one just bitter enough, the seeded one very seeded.The scallops were great until I encountered the hearts of palm. Imagine listening to a great piece of music, moving along with the congruence of sounds, when a sharp, tinny sound, like the blare of an out of tune trumpet, breaks out. Crash...Along comes the salmon, skin beautifully charred, the flesh succulent looking, and flaky to the fork. Looks great, and yes, their purveyor has delivered great product, and the kitchen did well by it. Things tasted great, right until I tried the mustard sauce. Pickle punch! The tang overwhelms, so sharp, so not right. Crash.The waiter comes by, we ask a question and he never comes back with the answer. No, he wasn't busy, he had time to chat with the guy in the suit for a while.My dessert was a kind of crepe with plums, excellent! Perfect!The wines we enjoyed, each by the glass, were excellent, as well.Glad to have tried this place.

So let's break it down:Situation:  Came here for a work dinner with clients on a Thursday night for a 6:30pm reservation. Guys, girls, ages 20-50's.  Pretty expensive so wouldn't be coming here on a date on my own dime, if ya know what I meanAmbiance:  Located on 58th street between 2nd and 3rd aves, I thought the location was a bit weird...but based on the location, you can tell it definitely probably draws a big corporate wine-and-dine crowd.  We walked in and met our party in the bar area, which was DEAD SILENT, no music, etc, (though there was a piano up front, un-manned) and very dimly lit with dark wood paneled walls and a matching bar.  Veryyy old school gentleman's club feel.  We were brought up the stairs to a dining room (there seemed to be a couple) and sat at a round, white linened table.  As the parties filtered in, the crowd was more of the same...old. school.Food:  So the food....was good.  That kind of good where you're like OH this is fancy, bougey good. Definitely not going to find your run of the mill chicken milanese or eggplant parm on this menu.  We all ordered our own entree and a bunch of apps to share, and they also had a special lamb chop for an entree that we shared as a group.  BEST. LAMB.CHOPS. I've ever had. Like melt off the bone into your mouth kind of good.  Wine:  Extensive and expensive wine list, but all very good.  we had several bottles and I didn't order so I don't know the prices, but it was very good.  And I drank it AwWwWL. ahhService:  Our host, waiter, and bus boys were all extremely attentive and knowledgeable, and it was obvious that they were there to cater to us.  This is not one of those places if you need to be ""in and out"".  It was a long, leisurely meal, and for a 6:30 reservation, we probably didn't leave until 9pm or so.  My pet peeve is rushed service, so this is good....just don't come here if you're trying to catch a show!All in all, I had a really great, high quality experience here, but probably won't be back anytime soon without a very special occasion....like for my grandpa's 90th birthday, or ordination into the priesthood.",0,1,0,Tara O.,"Chicago, IL",103,43,2

4.0,12/20/2013,"KenScale: 8.5/10Felidia is an Italian restaurant from owner Lidia Bastianich and chef Fortunato Nicotra. It's long been one of those places on the border between Midtown East and Upper East Side and that I rarely visit. I've finally made it for dinner one night. I was expecting an overpriced fancy Italian restaurant catering to older Midtown crowds, but was actually quite impressed with the quality of food there (high price points notwithstanding).I had one antipasti, two pastas and one secondi, followed by one dolci. Crudo di pesce (consisting of shaved raw seafood salad and vegetables) was a pleasant surprise. I really loved the texture of various raw seafood working its way with the vegetables. An acquaintance of mine once declared Felidia's pastas are better than Marea's, so I had to try at least two pasta dishes to see whether that bold statement was true. In conclusion, I liked the two pasta dishes (pappardelle with braised duck and mushrooms and pear and fresh pecorino-filled ravioli) for their rich flavor, but wasn't as blown away. What did blow me away, however, was corvina (black seabass filetwith celery root puree, mushroom broth and celery gratin). The filet was perfectly cooked, and worked so harmoniously with the broth in flavor to create an outstanding dish. The meal ended with pumpkin olive oil cake with poached cranberries and honey mascarpone ice cream, a delightful dish that was not overly sweet to my relief. The restuarant definitely has more older crowds, perhaps due to its location. Getting a reservation here was not a huge challenge. The restaurant has an extensive Italian wine list, as well as some cocktail menus. Felidia would be an ideal place for an Italian dinner after work in Midtown.

He refused to reverse the waitress's mistake. All 7 of us at the table heard $7, or else we would not have ordered the special!

He sat us down and took our drink order. Drinks were served. Then we proceeded to wait and wait and wait for the waiter to come over. He never did. They actually sat two people at the table that we did not want and they were eating prior to us ordering our dinner.

Finally gave our order for apps and dinner and we were finally on our way. Key word was finally.There was also a wine sommelier/ waitress there to help with wine choices and their wine pairing meals.

5.0,9/18/2013,"Felidia has been around for some time, has a reasonably famous owner who also has an interest in other excellent restaurants plus Eataly.  The dining rooms is a little worn looking.  This didn't bother me a bit.  It adds to the charm.  On both of my visits, the food was superb.  The menu has changed a bit over time, but there is still a dedication to quality.  The food is fairly simple, as the best and most authentic italian food is. There is also a skewing towards northern italian fare, which means more pork, beef, lamb, veal, rice, animal fat and butter than there is pasta, tomatoes, garlic, and other staples of southern italy.  On our most recent visit, it was black truffle season - and we indulged.  Yes, it was expensive.  But, it was excellent.Baby beet salad with pistachios, blue cheese and greens was excellent.  We also had a veal dish with mushrooms, a cream sauce and truffled and a ravioli with cheese, bitter greens, a butter/lobster sauce and more truffles.  All perfectly executed and delicious.  For dessert, cheese, 40 year old port, and their riff on tiramisu.  Wonderful.",0,0,0,Rob B.,"New York, NY",6,174,25
5.0,9/13/2013,"When a restaurant lives up to your expectation, it is time to celebrate. Felidia delivers handily and with panache. The setting is lovely. If you are lucky enough to get the upstairs room with the glass wall that overlooks other rooms, you will be impressed by the incredible job the architect did in creating an open feel in what was probably a very small space. The room has just 2 tables for 2 parties of 6. Delightful...quiet and intimate, you feel like you are in a private dining room. But the food...well, that's the real star. From the inventive and flavorful appetizers--shrimp in the onion is not to be missed if it is a special--to the beautifully presented and well-prepared entrees--the sea bass special was just that, very special; others were delighted with the tuna entrée--sushi grade and perfectly prepared; the mixed seafood grill was amazing. We couldn't fit dessert but the waiter brought us a small plate of 4 different mini-cookies--all were good but almond/pistachio cookie was memorable: chewy, intensely flavored and just the perfect sweet ending touch. Kudos to the wait staff for their perfect blend of solicitousness minus the ""hovering"" that is so annoying. Thank you Filedia for delivering a perfect ""Mother's Day Weekend"" gift!

The staff was attentive, a bit pushy when i didn't finish my pasta and the waiter wanted me to take it in a doggy bag, I had to tell him that i never take restaurant food home.    The appetizers are the worst of the menu. I had a crudo fish plate, awful. The salmon was greasy and warm.    The pastas were ok, but it's not the same quality that they had a few years ago. The flavor and the texture of the pasta has gone down. For a pasta when there is nothing else it works. By the way, the ambiance is snobbish and arrogant.",5,1,0,Samuel M.,"Manhattan, NY",62,420,54

4.0,8/7/2013,"This review, and every star of this review goes to Matthew and the food. The food was insane as was the wine, all thanks to Matthew-- our sommelier. HOLY MOLY though... the other staff was totally off. As in didn't help recommend dishes and was neglectful most of the night. I agree with the other yelper who said these folks look like they're working in a ""Nazi parallel universe""... My asparagus and ricotta salad was delicious-- fresh and a wonderful way to start my meal. My pear ravioli was sublime. Totally amazing and the portion was generous. I hate when you order ravioli and they give you four pieces of pasta and call it a day. Come on! I want lots of yummy ravioli please! Felida delivered. I also should mention our uncomfortable start to our meal when we were sandwiched between two loud, boisterous parties of business men. The whole place was pretty empty, yet they fully sat the upstairs and wanted to put us in a crowded corner. We asked to move and stood around awkwardly hovering over other diners while the hostess headed back downstairs to ""check if it's okay with the manager"". We didn't enjoy that welcome to a ""nice"" restaurant. Service isn't everything, but it's a huge part of a meal. The service and help we received from Matthew about our wines was phenomenal. He was knowledgeable and made good recommendations within our price range, AND he gave us free tastes of wine with dinner and dessert!

1.0,7/21/2013,"What a major disappointment.Lydia is my Wife's favorite TV food personality so we were greatly looking forward to our meal here. This restaurant is so different from the personality that you see on TV it is difficult to comprehend. While the TV Lydia is casual, friendly, homey and even a bit rustic, this restaurant is snooty, anal and pompous.The wait staff is from some parallel Nazi universe. They all looked like frightened animals scurrying about. I have never been so ignored in a restaurant. When the waiter initially asked us if we ""wanted anything from the bar"" he spoke directly to my wife, then myself, then walked away, completely ignoring my son.  We were sitting in the central dining room, where there were, at most, 10 tables and all of the staff needed to pass thru to get from the kitchen to all the other spaces. We had to flag down a different waiter each time we needed or wanted something.Unfortunately the food was not able to save the pathetic service. My wife ordered the pasta with mushrooms and truffles. The pasta was far from al-dente to the point of being mushy and the mushrooms overwhelmed the truffle. My son had the chicken mozzarella. It looked like a deconstructed chicken parm and consisted of three bite sized medallions of chicken with a small slice of mozzarella on top of each. His main dish looked like a nice sized appetizer. His actual appetizer was the only decent dish of the meal, but then how hard is it to slice some prosciutto? My octopus appetizer was underwhelming. At lease the veal in my main course of vitello tonnato was cooked excellently. Unfortunately the dish was overwhelmed by shavings of hard, raw artichoke.The waiter screwed up our desert order and forgot my limoncello order.

3.0,6/14/2013,"3.5 stars for the food; 3 stars for service. We ventured here for a long business lunch and threw several wrenches at the staff, including last-minute additions to the party and the presence of two vegans at the table. I was impressed by the restaurant's ability to cater to a particularly difficult (for a meat/cheese heavy spot) set of food preferences, and the waiter recommended at least four suitable dishes, albeit with a marked level of disdain. Sadly the waitstaff continued in this aloof and disinterested manner, taking zero cues from the accommodating and gracious hostess.Hopes ran high for the food, as the prix fixe lunch menu seemed a great deal (only a few bucks more than the typical restaurant week lunch), and we ordered a variety of apps/pastas and mains. The pear and pecorino ravioli was light and well put together. Although the tagliatelle was a tad undercooked, the veal/beef/pork ragu was excellent. The beet dish looked beautiful and was well-received by both the vegans (sans ""local cheese"") and the non-vegans. Mains were unfortunately less of a hit, with the yellowfin tuna coming out spectacularly overcooked and tasting primarily of salt. The agrodolce sauce, usually a favorite of mine, was allegedly done with red pepper, but sadly tasted like Heinz. Branzino was oily and slightly over, though the salmon was a perfect pink. The dessert highlight was hands-down the nutella tiramisu because, duh, and nothing else on the sweet side is particularly worth a mention. Overall, I would return for more pasta dishes (and possibly a taste of the burrata appetizer), and would probably request a seating downstairs so as to avoid the awkwardly silent and cramped upper dining area (unless there is also no music or noise of any kind downstairs as well, in which case the restaurant should consider investing in at least a white noise machine?)",1,0,0,Erica I.,"Brooklyn, NY",22,11,0

The scallop appetizer was delicious - seared to perfection and so great with something as simple as peas and carrots. The tuna entree (an $8 supplement) was well worth it and the best, freshest tuna steak I have ever had in my entire life.

After telling our server our likes and dislikes, the chef prepared a 6-course meal for us. The food was incredible! Service was also top quality. My one and only complaint is that we asked our server (who sort of doubled as the sommelier??) for a recommendation for a wine bottle in a certain price range and he recommended several bottles which were wildly out of that range.  It was a little embarrassing, especially when I'm trying to take my mom out for a nice meal, to have to re-iterate the lower price range.Overall, I would say that dining here was an excellent experience and would highly recommend it.",2,0,1,Sarah Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,62,20

He never came by to ask how the food was or see if we wanted anything else to drink. While we were in the middle of dessert he put down the check and picked it up again before we had the chance to even look at it. We felt rushed and unworthy of his time the entire time we were there.

Staff are sniffy and a little above their station. The maitre'd was a bit hopeless and all over the place describing the specials. The sommelier was amateurish and seemed thrown by my request for a bottle under $100 dollars. He flicked through the wine list and chose a bottle at $95. Didn't seem very knowledgeable which is a shame as you need help navigating through the wine list.If I were again, I would stick with pasta dishes which they seem to do well.

2.0,5/20/2013,I came here with my significant other this past Saturday. From a food perspective I was quite impressed. It does live up to the standards that I expected. From a service perspective is well another story.We started with the tutto crudo and moved on to the pappardelle. The pappardelle was very very tasty. Quite the flavorful experience. Our entrees were branzino and anatra. The fish was soft but not brittle and the flavors from the garnish of onion and artichoke brought a natural sweet taste. The duck breast was perfectly smoked with the juices blasting through your tastes buds asking for more. I almost bit my tongue because it was so good.Here's the interesting part. We arrived at around 7:45pm and did not leave the restaurant until 11pm. Why you ask? Because after our entrees arrived it seem liked the whole wait staff forgot about us. We sat at our table well over 40mins before someone came to clear our plates. We sat and we sat and no one was stopping. I saw two other couples who came in after us leave. I didn't even bother ordering dessert or coffee because I was afraid I would be there for 4+ hours. Not to mention that waiter was not personal and didn't even seem like he cared that I gave him an attitude when I ask for the check. You are a high end restaurant and I believe the rating should include the entire dining experience. You received a 5 for food and a 0 for experience.

Aunt and uncle both had the special, which was a pasta with boar. They were concerned it would be too spicy since the waiter described it as spicy (their threshold for spice is not exceptional) but they said it was not too spicy and was excellent. I had the tagliatelle with duck, which was amazing although I don't think there were many mushrooms in it which is the only negative.For dessert, we had the nutella cake.

What I love about Felidia is that they give you FULL portion sizes, even with the lunch set menu, so you don't feel like you're given the short end of the stick. The restaurant is situated in an old townhouse and is conservatively designed. There is a nice long bar as you enter the restaurant that leads the entrance to the main dining room. My favourite dishes by far have been the Pappardelle with Veal/Pork Ragu and the Polipo (grilled octopus, corona beans, celery). Dessert lovers will not be disappointed.

The food is excellent, the wines are to die for, and don't even get me started on the desserts. The lunch special makes it surprisingly affordable, which is always welcome.The best pastas they offer are probably the pappardelle and the cacio e pere ravioli. The duck and mushroom pappardelle is perfect if you want something rich and savory, and the pear and pecorino ravioli is a great lighter option.For the main course, I've had luck with the quaglie saltimbocca, which is always prepared perfectly and offers a nice combination of flavors and textures. Again, you won't be disappointed by anything on the menu.The pecan tart is incredible, and possibly my favorite dessert anywhere. It could not be improved in any way.The service is professional and friendly. Waiters here have a way of making you feel comfortable.

5.0,8/28/2012,"@$29.50 the three-course lunch menu here is an amazing weekday bargain. The Upper East Side which was once the dining destination of Manhattan has moved downtown & to Brooklyn- to some older food critics and stalwarts they have not quite gotten this reality. Felidias remains as a bastion of high end yet evolving cuisine with formal uptown graciousness, presentation and service.The restaurant is in a townhouse- very elegant and hoardes of servers answer your every dining whim.  There are many options within the lunch menu some do have an additional supplement, but for this level of food- it is worth it.Ordered for the table:AppsMaine diver scallops in fava bean pureeTagliatelle w/duck, pork and veal raguMainsSalmon w/mustard sauce over swiss chardGrilled lobster, razor clams, scallops, shrimp, calamari($15 supplement)DessertsGelato w/chocolate saucePalichinko pancakeWe also drank two Lagunita(California) beers. The bread here arrives with two small rolls stuck on top- lollipop style(ala Donnatella & Burke) with a nice raw pesto/cannelini dip. The tagliatell comes out in a pan and is plated on the side in view- very showy. The tagliatelle was perfect period- al dente, flavor galore! My friend's grilled seafood was amazing. The razor clams had parmigaina and tasted like a clams casino. The palachinko- best I have ever had as well as delish vanilla & strawberry housemade gelato and chocolate sauce capped an outstanding meal! $118 w/o tip.",5,0,1,Franny A.,"New York, NY",865,1323,1125

5.0,7/20/2012,"Had an amazing meal at Felidia last night.My server George was incredibly attentive, personable, and extremely patient in explaining the dishes, specials, and tasting menu. I loved the feel of the restaurant also. Not stuffy, but laid back and definitely a nicer atmosphere where you can go there for a special occasion and really enjoy it. A casual elegance if you will. The service was one of the better examples I have received at any restaurant. They made me feel like family. And I even got to meet Lidia!!! (which I will get to later)As for the food:1st course- Appetizer portion of the porcini pappardelle with braised duck. This is a signature dish that I was highly in anticipation of trying. George claimed it was a spectacular dish and I was planning on getting it anyway. This was a really incredible pasta. The pappardelle was perfectly al dente and the braised duck and chunks of mushrooms were absolutely delicious and plentiful. Even as a half portion it was a big portion and I only got through half before asking to have the rest wrapped up to save room for my other 2 courses.2nd course- Aquarello risotto with lobster, corn, and whipped mozzarella ($36). I love risotto and when you are throwing lobster, corn, and mozzarella in it how can that be bad? Again, another HUGE portion but this was not available as a half order. It was extremely rich, creamy, and cheesy. The risotto was expertly prepared and was done with precise technique. There were generous amounts of lobster and the corn aided in adding sweetness and crunch to cut through the richness of the cheese and undoubtedly massive amounts of butter. This was pricy, but it could definitely serve as an entree (which is what I think it is intended to be but since I am a glutton I ordered it as a second course before the entree).3rd course- Whole branzino with aqua pazza, potato, grilled onions, grilled zucchini ($36). It was presented whole and then they filleted it for me in the dining room. The fish was extremely simple, yet delicious and super fresh. The side vegetables were only ok for me and they could have made it a little more imaginative. I enjoyed the whole lemon slices on the side which I squeezed on to the fish. It was well done overall, but I think next time I'd order something a little more creative. After a rich first two courses though, the fish provided a nice break. I still ate the whole fish and nothing was left on my plate.Side of polenta was also ordered and OMG this was incredible! It seemed like a tiny portion served in a pot but it was superrrrrr indulgent. Rich, perfect texture, and it had some black flecks in it which I couldn't make out (perhaps truffles) that added amazing flavor. The best $8 I spent.Dessert- I was full but I couldn't pass on dessert. The order was the palacinke with raspberry jam, blueberries, raspberries and a side of mascarpone pistachio gelato. They were 4 little crepes of deliciousness. A little sprinkled sugar on the outside gave them a nice crunch to balance the soft crepes. I combined them with the unbelievable gelato and it was sensational ending to a fabulous meal.Now the best part of the night was when all of a sudden Lidia starts walking down the stairs from the 2nd floor. She turns and I waved. She then came over to my table and I had the pleasure of chatting with her for a little. I felt weird asking fer to take a picture but how often am I going to see Lidia right? Funny thing happened... When I get my phone to take the picture, it dies!!!!! Can you believe that? But no worries George came to the rescue. He took the pic with his phone and emailed it to me!What incredible service. Awesome food. Great experience. I will be back again at Felidia in due time.",2,0,1,G C.,"New York, NY",21,264,798
5.0,7/18/2012,"Felidia is the flagship of Lidia Bastianich's vast restaurant empire.  The high-end Italian restaurant is the brain child of Lidia and her ex-husband Felice (hence the name).  I had absolutely no expectations when my friend suggested we go to Felidia for an NYC foodie outing.  I had not heard much about Lidia besides her cooking show so I didn't know what to expect.  A casual choice turned out to be one of the most amazing Italian meals I have ever had. The service was perfect, the décor was classic, and the food was mouthwatering.   I soon returned for a very special occasion (my birthday!) so I can share two different, yet equally wonderful dining experiences.Both times, we were served a delicious spread that I would say is comparable to hummus.  The first time, it was made of white beans and the second time, with peas.  They were both accompanied by a variety of breads.  I could not get enough of them and the waiter was happy to bring us several heaping servings.The Olive Oil Sampler has become tradition.  The informed waiters explained the differences between the olive oils, which were from different regions of Italy.  I was surprised to be able to distinguish between the olive oils...all satisfying in different ways.During my first visit, I was foolish enough to skip the appetizer.  The second time, I made no mistake.  I shared the Fegatini with a friend.  It was Chicken Liver-Trifolato with mushrooms, onion, and pate.  I know chopped liver scares many people, but I think if you gave it a try, you would really enjoy it.  It is meaty yet sweet.  The only qualm I had was that the pate was served with biscotti which was too sweet for the dish.During my first visit,  I ordered the Vitello (Veal tenderloin with mushroom trifolati, castelmagno fonduta, and spinach).  It was beautifully presented, cooked to perfection, and absolutely divine.My second visit, I opted for beef.  I ordered the Manzo-Braised Beef Flat Iron Steak Tagliata with spring bean farrotto.  The beef was juicy and cooked just right.  The farrotto was a light accompaniment  for an extremely flavorful dish.To finish off my first meal, I got the Hazelnut Torte (you just can't go wrong with hazelnut) which was perfectly complemented by the pistachio gelato scooped on top.During my second visit, we ordered the Limoncello Tiramisu which was a delicious twist to an otherwise traditional Italian dessert.   It had all the basic components of tiramisu but was flavored with tart & sweet limoncello (an Italian lemon liqueur).The waiter sent over a complimentary Rhubarb Panna Cotta.  I wasn't sure what to expect from a rhubarb dessert, but it was delightfully pleasant.  The Panna Cotta was creamy and light.  The rhubarb added a slight tartness to the sweet panna cotta.I will definitely be returning to Felidia to try the other dishes on the menu, they all sound great!",4,0,2,Michelle B.,"Huntington Station, NY",816,1320,3063

When pressed on the matter, they tell me that this is their policy for groups of 8 or more because the kitchen can't support a large group with the regular menu. Which from previous experience I know to be untrue. I'm used to being gouged in Midtown, but this is absurd. I asked to speak to a manager, then the person on the phone flippantly said ""do you want to make a reservation or not?"" Tired of this nonsense, I declined. He hung up on me.Get real Felidia.

Unfortunately, the more expensive price tag at Felidia did not translate into more elevated, delectable food.I had quite the culinary week: dining at Felidia on Friday night after having experienced the awful Joanne on Tuesday and the transcendent Jean Georges on Wednesday. I thought Felidia would round-off the week with a bang, but what I got was more of a fizzle. What I ordered at Felidia sounded good when reading the menu, but was truly lackluster in the eating.  The appetizer featuring burrata was a letdown.  I was hoping for the cheese to be the expected velvety, creamy delight it is but instead got hardened, chewy bites that were created when the cooked elements of the dish were piled on top. The element that was billed as the star did not get the star treatment. Sad. My main course candele was a bit rubbery and tasted like I was eating fistfuls of rosemary: I couldn't taste any other flavor as the rosemary overpowered everything else. As for the rest of my party, the pear pecorino ravioli and pappardelle with duck were appreciated, while the orecchiette with seafood was left largely uneaten, the lamb deemed OK and the quail was considered the most successful dish of the night. Dessert was blah with a passable panna cotta, a weird, stale-tasting open cannoli and a fine Bicerin.I must give the service a positive mention--our captain was particularly professional and pleasant--but for the foods sake, I will not be returning.",2,0,0,Kim G.,"New York, NY",116,22,10

In addition to their lunch special, they also offer 3 of their Signature Pasta dishes & dessert for $29.99 (which sounds like a better offer, but everyone at the table has to order it). - Pecan Tart: I gravitate towards candied pecans like a moth to a flame.  The maple ice cream put the dessert completely over the top and made me forget about my dislike of the 2nd course.",2,1,0,Hector M.,"Jersey City, NJ",537,513,2227

4.0,1/8/2012,"I had a dinner at Felidia for the second time the other day.  This time I decided to do the pasta tasting which included 4 pastas and a dessert.  Pasta dishes were all delicious but I found the sauces too rich in general and I was not able to finish any of them.  After my second visit, I decided I like their fish and meat dishes better than the pasta.  It is still one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the City.",1,0,1,Akira O.,"New York, NY",74,401,73
4.0,1/4/2012,"Felidia had been on my must-try list for ages: it always looked so warm and inviting on a chilly New York evening. The front dining area (visible through paned glass windows) glows with reds, golds, and rich wood paneling -- sort of a Christmas card meets Don Corleone's study.So I had high hopes for ambiance when we made a reservation for a pre-theater dinner for eight a few days before Christmas.  And while Felidia is as lovely on the inside as it is on the out--our large round table was set with candles and a bowl of fresh roses--it is disappointingly dull.  There is no music and, despite a relatively full dining room, the main part of the restaurant was nearly silent. However, the food was really excellent and surprisingly simple.  We ordered the chef's tasting menu (a personalized six-course menu chosen by chef Fortunato Nicotra) which included the Tutto Crudo (a mildly tangy raw seafood salad topped with crunchy black rice), an unusual (and addicting) salad made with four types of artichokes, the Cacio e Pere (my favorite dish of the night: homemade ravioli filled with fresh pecorino and slivers of pear, topped with just enough black pepper and aged pecorino to balance the buttery sauce), and Porcini Pappardelle (my second fave: fresh pasta served with braised shredded duck and mushrooms - so hearty and delicious!). For our main course we were served a forgettable (and slightly tough) braised beef topped with hanger steak but this disappointment was remedied by a quartet of lovely Italian desserts (of which, the chocolate mocha cake was the most popular at our table).The service was also very good and the staff readily accommodated our theater plans by expediting the sequence of the courses.  Nevertheless, in spite of the five-star food, Felidia felt too sober (verging on somber) for an evening out with family - it was something of a relief to step back out into the holiday air.",3,0,0,Anna M.,"Manhattan, NY",17,50,2

My boyfriend and I participated in the four course signature dish prix fixe ($70 per person). Everything was just divine. Lidia was there and left 30 minutes before I arrived (I overheard someone say she was so excited to have met her as I walked in) so I asked the hostess if I could meet her.

4.0,12/22/2011,"It really is a joy to work for two gourmands who appreciate, understand, and take pleasure in a good meal.  This Holiday season, the bosses took us to Felidia.  Last year, we had gone to Del Posto (I know, swanky, right?), but in my estimation, this  was the more memorable and enjoyable experience.The atmosphere is rich and warm, there's an instant glow of reds and ambers as you enter this restaurant, it feels so inviting and you relax very naturally into your seat at the table.  The seven of us sat upstairs and we were afforded a great view of the bustling action in the main dining area downstairs.  The great thing about being on the higher floor, was the noise level was greatly reduced, and we were also in plain view of the pasta-making section.  The service was what you would expect from a celebrity-chef-owned establishment, courteous, attentive, and knowledgeable.  Lidia Bastianich definitely knows how to frame an elegant dining experience.  We had asked for an assortment of cheeses and prosciutto as a starter.  Though this was not on the menu, Felidia was happy to oblige our special request.  The cheese and cured meats were of the highest quality.  I'm not a huge fan of prosciutto, but dinner that night at Felidia, with that incredible spread, converted me into one.  To further whet our appetite, we ordered a number of half-sized pasta dishes and passed it around the table.  As an astute lover of pasta, these dishes were unbelievably good.  Most notably (and highly recommended), is their Pappardelle -- porcini pappardelle with braised, shredded hudson valley moulard duck and mushrooms.  The pasta was al dente, the heavenly sauce of porcini and duck was absolutely perfect, hugging my palate in gentle love.  For my main dish, I went with the Manzo -- creekstone farm braised beef flat iron, steak tagliata, vegetable farrotto.  This dish was actually not my favorite.  The meat was a little more rare than I had anticipated, or requested.  And the (very)  odd piece of flash-fried leafy green as a garnish or aesthic piece - whatever function it served - was really just unattractive.  Otherwise, it was a good (and huge) chunk of beef, tender and flavorful for the most part.  I looked around the table, and was awestruck at some of the other, more elaborate, and stunning presentations (for example, the Grigliata Di Pesce -- scallops, lobster, calamari, shrimp and razor clams cooked ""alla piastra"" with fagiolini, corn and cherry tomato).  I had never seen anything like that before, and it was quite stunning.  Dessert was not particularly that memorable, I had a pear tarte that was very light and refreshing, but very plain.  Someone else had ordered the tiramisu, which was not your classic little slice of cake.  This was served completely deconstructed with slices of bread instead of cake on the side, and the mascarpone cheese and tiramisu mixture in a tiny cup.  I was a bit disappointed, but was told the dessert was still tasty nonetheless.  One of my boss' had ordered the Palacinke, which he loved -- palacinke (crepe), rosehip jam, pistachio brittle, crème fraiche, which is apparently is a Croatian staple (Lidia by the way, is Croatian!  I'm not sure if she's also part Italian, I would hope she is, but anyway, there's a little secret reveal for you, ha). Of all the Lidia Bastianich restaurants I have been to, I would say Felidia and Becco are a tie for first place, followed by Del Posto.  Needless to say, she takes pride in her recipes and her restaurants, and you will certainly have a good experience at any of her establishments. However, be prepared for a costly bill.  Though I did not have to pay for this meal, I could tell that the restaurant was full of ballers, all decked out in designer suits, possessing that aire of affluent  magnifience.  Thanks to my kind bosses for helping us experience the same as those very well-to-do folks!!",2,2,3,Jennifer C.,"Elmhurst, NY",559,645,1350
2.0,12/20/2011,"My girlfriend and I were in New York over the weekend, and she said that Felidia's was the best place to eat.  My gf is also the chef of an Italian restaurant, so I took her word on Italian food.We were promptly seated for our reservation and ordered a nice bottle of Soave.  Sadly, the wine was the best part of the meal.  The bread basket, while decent, was just not what I expected.  It was 3 types of bread with a white bean paste instead of olive oil.  Not that flavorful.For appetizer, we got the filet carpaccio and kobe beef tartare.  Both had good beef flavor, but had nothing else to it.  It literally tasted like raw beef.  No capers, no garlic, very little, if any, seasoning.For dinner, my girlfriend got the Seafood platter (calimari, scallops, razor clam, lobster, octopus) and I got the parpadelle with duck meat.  The seafood platter was about as small as I expected, but not nearly as flavorful.  The razor clam had too much breading on it, but no flavor.  All of the cooked meats were barely luke warm and once again, had no seasoning to it.  The calimari was too chewy, but the scallops were cooked perfectly.For my meal, I got about 10 ribbons of pasts and a nice portion of duck, but once again, the food was barely warm.  I like a nice, hot pasta that I have to blow on before I eat.  This didn't even taste like it was prepared to order, especially since the server brought up the plates of food, then mixed the ingredients and cooked the plates on a hotplate.  No lie.As for dessert, I got the Panna Cotta, which tasted and felt like I was eating Fluff and the gf got the hazelnut moist chocolate cake made with nutella.  The PC was meh, as I've had much better, and the chocolate cake was horrible.  The cake was cold and dry.  No moisture to it or even a hint of nutella.Also as a side note, there was no music or other entertainment.  Just the conversations of other patrons and ourselves.  Just awkward.All of this would have not been that big of a deal if the waiters actually checked up on us to see how everything was, but no one ever came by.  They weren't rude by any means, they just didn't care. The bill came to $200 and I do not feel that it was even worht $100.  If you're going to charge a premium price, offer premium food.  I know it's supposed to offer upscale Italian, but all they seem to be doing is ruining Lidia's good name.",1,0,0,Chris T.,"Woburn, MA",11,79,0

5.0,8/24/2011,"Took a friend here for her graduation/farewell dinner.  The bread basket comes with (what we thought was) their version of a hummus...  white bean puree with minced chives and olive oil.We both chose the 6 course Chef's Tasting Menu.  This tasting menu consists of 6 courses.  First course was a Rock Shrimp Salad, with cherry tomatoes, corn taken off the cob, celery, and asparagus, dressed in olive oil.  The shrimp was very fresh and perfectly cooked.  First thing I noticed with the salad was varying textures married together and complimenting each other.Second course was a trio of summer squash: gazpacho with asparagus, cherry tomatoes, topped with ricotta with a fried zucchini fritter on the side; what seemed to be something similar to a rollantine (i couldn't understand the server) in a marinara sauce, and then squash fried, seasoned with black pepper and topped with ricotta.  The gazpacho was the best out of all three preparations.  Again, loving the difference in textures.  The soup was very creamy, contrasting with the crunch of asparagus and tomato.  The fried squash was a little heavy on the pepper.The third course was the first pasta course, and probably my favorite out of all the courses we had: Pear and Pecorino filled Ravioli.  Now, some may feel that fruit has no place in a savory ravioli, but the ravioli, surprisingly, was not overly sweet.  The homemade pasta was clearly the star.  The pecorino was very smooth, and you could taste a hint of the pear, but not enough to make it sweet.  The only downside, was the portion size, as the ravioli were rather miniscule.Fourth course (2nd pasta course) was what could be described as siamese-twin bucatini, with an eggplant ragu.  I had never seen this kind of pasta before, I couldn't understand the actual Italian name of it and frankly, I wasn't sure what to do with it.  The length and width of the pasta was not conducive to twirling on a spoon.  We weren't given knives to cut the pasta.  The pasta was just long enough that spearing it with a fork and eating it did not make for an elegant approach.Fifth course, was the main entree - bone-in lamb chop and lamb shoulder served with roasted fingerling potato and mushroom.  Both cuts of lamb were perfectly cooked.  The potato was perfectly seasoned and complimented the proteins.Dessert was a sampler quartet served with a side of assorted italian cookies.  The quartet consisted of a chocolate cake, raspberry tapioca with sorbet, deconstructed cannolo, and citrus tiramisu topped with strawberry.  Tapioca was a little undercooked.  The tiramisu was light, fresh, and simply amazing - a different take on an Italian classic.Overall, the decor was what you would expect from an elegant Italian restaurant.  Service was on point, changing silverware after every course.  Price point for a tasting menu such as this ($85) was reasonable given the amount of courses, as well as the name power and the skill level of the chef and restaurateur.  Amazing and creative food, excellent and attentive service, couldn't ask for anything more!  Kudos Lidia!",1,1,1,David N.,"Edison, NJ",325,31,0

5.0,7/14/2011,"Felidia is truly a gem. A God among titans, and a force to be reckoned with.  It's a harmonious balance between something grandiose and something homey.  Making one feel like royalty in your own home.  Cookbook author, restaurateur ,TV personality and queen bee herself, Lidia Bastianich, truly lives up to her reputation.  The space has a rustic feel, but grand with dimmed lighting, giving off a warm feeling.  The staff mostly friendly offer good energy and a warm welcome.  Some of the wait staff may seem rushed when explaining the menu, but this could be explained by the busy dining room.  Once seated, you will find yourself surrounded by many working professionals, suited to the gills and ready for the night that stands before them.  Although jackets are preferred, they are not mandatory when visiting the restaurant.  You need to be properly dressed, no hats, no open toe sandals or ripped jeans.  Neat is the magic word here.If you find yourself visiting with a crowd of 8-10 people, Felidia offers a four course prefix for $85 that is stellar.  You will also find a wind list, that is both extensive and confusing, throwing you for a loop if you don't know your wines.  The food which is Superb, is artfully executed by longtime executive chef, Fortunato Nicotra, a native of Palermo, Sicily.  After tasting the amazing dishes that came from his kitchen, you will be hard pressed not to bow down to the master.  A celebrity in his own right, he is as talented as he is down to earth.  You will soon understand why he commands so much respect amongst the culinary world.  Although Lidia's signature style of cooking is all over the menu, Fortunato does an exceptional job in staying true to it and bringing new flavors.  Not often you find a chef that has his/her dishes perfected.  For starters, the grilled octopus with its perfectly charred tentacles have a great bite from start to finish; the best I have ever had.  The pear ravioli with pecorino, was light, sweet and fork tender, AMAZING!  The Porcini pappardelle with braised, shredded hudson valley moulard duck and mushrooms, was delectable!  An earth like quality that satisfies you from the core.  The filet mignon carpaccio and wagyu beef tartare practically melted in your mouth, and the black and white bavette (similar to spaghetti) with baccala and trapanese pesto was sweet, salty, herby, and made music in your mouth.  In fact you will probably find yourself out of your seat dancing.  Something you spontaneously did as a child, for no other reason then to show your happy.  I can talk about some of the other great dishes, but to keep this short , what is worth noting, is the Limoncello Tiramisu.  It's nothing like you've had before.  It's sweet, light, and citrusy.  Light on the fork and light in your belly unlike most Tiramisu these days, which are heavy laden with cheese.  Definitely the way to finish off your night.Felidia gets high marks from many critics across the city.  It is well deserved.  Beautifully done across the board.

Everything was bland and tasteless. The bean spread on the table is just as bland and teaseless as the pastry.Here is why they only get two stars.  The service is a HORROR. No silver to eat at two times during the meal. No bread on table. Some got it some did not. We had to ask. The dining room manager needs to train the staff.  The waiter was rude.  Whene one of my guests asked for a saled the way he wanted it the waiter brushed him off and was insulting.  We all were amazed.  When he stated he would rather not have a salad the waiter said "" No salad for you, fine"" in a very snippy and rude manner.  When we could not get service I had to get out of my seat and go to the front to get the manager.  The tables are so close together you can't breath.  No room to eat on the table with water container and basics preventing you from getting access to your plate.  The water container flew off our table we were so close to another table.  Had to wait a long time to get check.  Id rather go to Maialino get much better food and service in a much better room. The four of us all stated that we won't be back.  I think Gangi? is the manager. Nice guy, but the staff and their level of service is not fitting anything like waht Falidia presents itself to be.With some in T-shirts and jeans and sneakers; I wonder if Filidia needs to take a step back and think about who they want to be as a room, service and seller of quality food.For those over 80 and the sneaker and T-Shirt crowd I guess Filidia can get away with this.  At some point they will do less and less turns.",1,0,0,Paul F.,"New York, NY",0,51,2

Our table wasn't ready so we were directed to the bar, which is really just a high traffic hallway with a bar along it. Luckily, we had a table upstairs so that dinner was in a better atmosphere, though rather dull and uninspired, much like the food. I had a green salad to start, which isn't on the menu, but they did whip up an overly dressed and salty assortment of greens for me. I also tried the octopus, and the polenta with burrata, both of which tasted like nothing more than their aforementioned main ingredients.For dinner, I had the cacio e pere, a sweet ravioli with ricotta and pears. It was ok, but I think I can buy the same at whole foods. Two in our party had the risotto and I felt terribly embarassed for them. With a texture like dry, lumpy oatmeal, even an amateur can prepare better. This being  a ""special occasion"", we did stay on for dessert. Again, not much to say, which is quite out of character for me.All in all, nothing went horribly wrong, but there are just too many better options for a memorable fine dining experience.",3,0,0,Tricia K.,"New York, NY",17,132,0
5.0,4/1/2011,"I have not given a 5 star rating in some time, but this place deserves it.  Divya and I came here last night around 9 pm.  We did not have a reservation, but they had no problem accommodating us and gave us what I would consider the best table in the house - back right corner against the wall so we can see everything.  The Decor:Very pleasant and relaxing.  Dimly lit, but not so dark where you can't see the rest of your party.  They have a nice wine rack too.  Tables were somewhat close, so if your over 250 lbs, maybe a little tight, otherwise, its fine.  The Food:Delicious!  Divya had the Gnocchi with truffles (don't you just love truffles) and I had the Veal.  Veal was cooked perfectly and the Gnocchi was out of this world amazing.  One of the best gnocchi's i have ever had.  The wine was great too and I love how they put it in a carafe for you.    Our somelier (spelling?) was fantastic and picked something in our price range with our exact specifications.  I am always amazed how someliers know all the wines yet are rather skinny.  For you to know every wine you must have had to try every single one.  And I am pretty sure if I drank the 1000 bottles that they have available I would be one of those people having problems fitting between the tables.  And finally the service: It was perfect.  They were pleasant, didn't bother us too much.  Kept both our wine glasses and water glasses filled.  Were quick and had recommendations (their Pecan dessert was a favorite amongst the servers and it did not disappoint!).  They also through in some extra cookies and a crepe for us as well.  My only complaint was that the bean spread for the bread needed a bit more salt, but otherwise an outstanding experience.

2.0,3/29/2011,"This was my last attempt to save my relationship with Felidia (no, I am not monogamous, but): Our marriage has run its course from the honeymoon - the first exquisite pleasure of chewing the perfectly al dente pasta and cutting into the artistic mosaic of octopus; then to the comfortable domestic life of solidly agreeable entrees (which the Italian restaurants in New York seem to have even harder time to execute than boiling pasta); and gradually to the taciturn evenings filled with recurring disappointments and bitter resentments, some of which directed toward the invariably inedible desserts - be it tiramisu or bomboloni; and finally, in the last year or two, to the extramarital affairs to discover greener grass and recoup the lost years. Even the expensive truffled tagliolini had failed to rouse my interest: Money neither buys heart nor stomach. Now, this last dinner was the ultimatum; let us see if the family reunion - a.k.a. Winemaker Dinner celebrating Umbrian Food and Wine - with Signora Lidia and Signore Nicotra - and a third-party mediator - Signore Salvatore ""Toto""* Denaro - would be able to rekindle my love and interest. *In Sicily, ""Toto"" is the nickname for Salvatore, like in Cinema Paradiso.The tired bean spread remained unchanged and bland, garnished with a large absolutely tasteless black fava bean like an evil eye. Even the whole-wheat focaccia with walnuts (and perhaps butter) did not do more than raising my eyebrow a millimeter. Castellucio Lentils with BaccalaThe baccalà was bland - how many bowls of water did it require the chef to change in order to ring every last bit of the good fishness out of the salted cod - slick and viscous from too much pommede like a mafia hairdo. The lentils underneath revealed the simple earthy origin with onions and celery, which would have brought back happier memory if it was properly salted. Salvatore's Chickpea SoupThe change of plan from the intriguing chickpea pasta to the common zuppa di ceci did let me down intellectually, and yet, seemed rather suitable for a night of blizzard at the end of March. The luckluster soup was thick in texture but thin in taste, on which the small but hefty greasy lardo crostino sat heavily down; such superficial show of machismo was not impressive but only disdainful.Rigatoni alla NormaThe perfectly cooked rigatoni, slathered in an intense tomato sauce with tender fried eggplants and aromatic basil, picqued my interest for the time being; while the creamy shreds of ricotta salata mellowed my sharp and ready anger toward the sloppy hand that scooped the pasta. Porcini Pappardelle with Braised DuckThe thin delicate sheets of pappardelle were light and silky, folding in the rich and dark duck sugo with porcini. The concentrated flavors of the duck and porcini almost made me forget the bad memories; nevertheless, when I turned for some carbohydrate support, the pappardelle deserted me with its quick sleaziness. Jamison Farm Roast Leg of Lamb and Lamb Chop with Sunchoke Puree, Roasted Potatoes in Black Truffle SauceThe leg and the chop were aptly roasted to medium: Good meats do not need to be bloody rare (double entendere intended) because they are tender and flavorful anyway. The execution of the earthy and licorish sunchoke pureee was well-done, so were the roasted potatoes with the evenly bowned skin. However, the paltry amount of the black truffle showed the ungenerous side of my former caro mio. Umbrian Chocolate Cake with Gelato As expected, the chocolate cake - or should I say chocolate pudding à la Kozy Shack - was unacceptable in both texture - lumpy - and taste - too eggy. The vapid cherry sauce was masked as a mixed berry sauce (or was it the mixed berry sauce masquerading as the cherry sauce). As I scooped the frozen milk - the only edible part of the dessert - off the plate with a frozen face, I contemplated the cosmic wisdom of Mr. Albert Einstein: ""Women marry men hoping they will change. Men marry women hoping they will not. So each is inevitably disappointed.""",4,2,2,The World Digested A.,"Tokyo, Japan",8,119,85

4.0,2/2/2011,"Felidia ranks as one of the most pleasant dining experiences I've ever had. Our bald, circular-glasses-wearing, ambiguously European waiter unavoidably called to mind the Nazi whose face melts off in Raiders of the Lost Ark, but I have to say, his presence added a lot to the meal. He introduced every dish with a flowery turn of phrase that should have been pretentious and grating and face-punch-worthy, but somehow instead came across as endearing, humble, and weirdly accurate. For instance, the beet salad was ""like a bike ride in San Francisco,"" and of course I scoffed at him, because what kind of a-hole says that about beets? And then I took a bite and I was like HOLY CRAP SAN FRANCISCO BIKE; the beets are a refreshing breeze, the chunks of cheese, creamy rays of sunshine. Earlier my companions mocked me for picking the beet salad over beef tartare and Alaskan king crab salad, and admittedly it seems like a pretty simplistic dish by comparison, but in the end I was like, now who's a stupid jerk who orders dumb things? It really was uncannily, unaccountably good, one of the most pleasing things I've ever eaten. Similarly, the pear and pecorino ravioli kinda was ""like a poem,"" or at least worthy of having one written about it. Ravioli with stupid fruit in it instead of meat sounds like a lousy hippie idea, but the two flavors went together amazingly well, and altogether it was one of those foods that deserves to be eaten as slowly as possible, savoring not just every bite, but every chew.Unfortunately, the rest of the meal didn't quite live up to the beginning, though it must be pointed out that the level of variance we're talking about here is 7-9 instead of 10. The duck pappardelle was expertly made--you could just tell the same dish would've been a little too salty at a lesser restaurant--but compared to my first two dishes, it was more of a familiar deliciousness, a level of deliciousness I've had many times before. The subsequent entrees were probably the weakest parts of our meal: I was very much looking forward to the veal tenderloin, but it ended up being nothing terribly special--though still good--and had similar thoughts on the bites of quail and sea bass entrees I snuck off my neighbors' plates. For dessert, I had a kind of citrusy tiramisu, and while I enjoyed it, the intensely tart flavor seemed incongruously in-your-face, even kinda chintzy, for this type of place.Also of note, the portion sizes were surprisingly large (excepting the ravioli, which I believe was literally two pieces), and I left feeling much, much fuller than expected. Like, uncomfortably full. So don't fill up on bread thinking you'll be receiving comically piddly portions here, or, like my friend Terry would, fill up on bread because they keep putting bread in front of you and if food is in front of you can't help but eat it.Anyway, though the food quality definitely hit its peak early on in the meal, the overall experience and atmosphere was impeccable. I often can't help but feel a bit out of place at these fancy restaurants, where they've never even HEARD of chicken fries or associated zesty dipping sauces, and as a general rule while in public establishments just want employees to leave me the hell alone. But the staff here was exceptional, and throughout the meal I felt I was in entirely good hands, even if one of them would be departing to kill Dr. Jones as soon as his shift was over.

4.0,1/20/2011,"I've had a long standing love affair with this restaurant.It warms my heart that it's been open since 1981 and is still going strong. I remember coming here back in the day with my family when Lidia Bastianich was not so well known and this place was still the new kid on the block.Now of course, Lidia is famous from her multiple, fabulous PBS cooking shows, other restaurants and cooking school.  Her own kids are now grown and her son Joe is a partner both with his mother and with Mario Batali in other restaurants and enterprises.But back to where it started is Felidia, opened originally by Lidia and her husband Felice; the combination of their names coming together in the restaurant name.   Felidia is a place you should experience when in NY.I can't recall a bad meal here.  Really.Just a few menu stand-out favorites are the cacio e pere which is the pear and fresh pecorino filled ravioli, the polenta with vegetable ragu, the pan-seared salmon...on and on.  Just pick something that strikes your gustatory fancy and run with it.  Chances are excellent that you're going to love it.I also recommend getting on the Felidia email list so you can be sure to get notice of special dinners and events the restaurant hosts.  These can be wonderfully interesting and fun.If you've ever seen Lidia on one of her cooking shows she comes across, as a no-nonsense yet warm, family-oriented women who truly wants to teach you how to cook and perhaps more importantly to enjoy her style of food.  That same sensibility is apparent in the restaurant.  It's somewhat formal yet feels very accessible, inviting and friendly.  It's no wonder to me that Lidia Bastianich has become such a culinary force to be reckoned with as this restaurant has consistently turned out top notch Italian fare in modern comfortable surroundings for quite some time. Added to that, Lidia is no showy prima donna, never one to toot her own horn. She puts to shame some of the narcissistic TV ""chefs"" foisted upon us on cooking show after cooking show these days, some of whom have limited credibility. Lidia competes, in my mind, with the likes of Julia Child for sheer talent and well-deserved longevity.  Brava Lidia!  Brava Felidia!",16,10,15,Alexandra S.,"Hingham, MA",306,545,1877

A special occasion came up and I finally made reservations to come here. Can't believe I waited this long to make the trip!My girlfriend and I split the octopus and beef tartar appetizers. Both were delicious; the octopus came out on a bed of marinated eggplant and tomatoes while the beef tartar came topped with a small arugula salad.

If you're a veal fan or just want some outrageously well prepared veal tenderloin, get this dish! The meat was cooked to perfection and seasoned just right and along with the asparagus and polenta, it provide such a complex and delicious taste; I savored every bite.

4.0,5/11/2010,"Chef Fortunato Nicotra has created a little gem of a place in Manhattan, tucked away down 58th street just of 2nd Avenue. The initial bread offering was good, the sun roasted tomato was by far my favorite.I tried the chefs tasting menu  and it was a fine choice, starting with an octopus dish that was a dream, never have I had anything like it. The Octopus was seared on the outside (crisp) and juicy in the middle. Scattered about the plate was some balsamic olive oil. Under it all was a bed of very thin sliced octopus and a potato herb sauce (to die for). Amazing start!Next were ravioli with pear and cheese. Ravioli is actually really hard to get perfect (good ravioli is one thing, perfect is another) it requires a great deal of timing between preparation and service, that pasta keeps cooking. I tell you this was perfect, flawless. Main dish was a flat Iron meat, two ways. one was medallions of medium-rare beef (melt-in-your-mouth good) and mushroom medallions lightly seared. And a brisket of sorts under the other steak and mush room (under that was some beans and veggies that were fine, but unremarkable). the brisket was a bit dry to my taste, but hardly poor by any measure. Dessert was a well drawn (fine crema) espresso, some lemon tiramisu (fantastic), a poached cinnamon pear, and some cookies (all delicious).Nice place, nice decor, and great food.Oh and btw a note to the managers and operators. If you have a seriously obnoxious man that is making other patrons flee his presence you should ask him to go not move them.

Although, some standouts were beet salad and octopus (Polipo) for antipasti and the pear and fresh pecorino-filled ravioli, aged pecorino, crushed black pepper (Il Cacio e Pere) for an entree.  The other things that we were served are not on the regular menu, but all were amazing.

We made the reservation through open table and were unaware of the special menu.  Because our time was limited we had to bypass the set menu and order a la cart. This at first seemed like it was not going to be possible but after our waiter spoke with the kitchen he found some a la cart menus. The tasting menu looked amazing but only having two hours to catch train we were not going to be able to fit in a 4 course meal. We started with a cheese an salami plate. The cheese was a particular type of aged Parm and was great, the salami was sliced super thin and had fennel seed overtones.  For my main I settled on the pasta with Sunday ragu.  The pasta itself was a wide tube noodle who's name escapes me. The ragu was pork with pork sausage.  The sausage had the same fennel seed overtones as the salami starter.  It was amazing.  One more thing, diners are treated to a basket of assorted bread which is served with a white bean purée.  The bread and purée was very good.",2,0,2,Randy M.,"Warrenton, VA",18,501,11
4.0,3/4/2010,"Celebrity chef empires. Molecular gastronomy. The Food Network. If I were an older and wiser New Yorker, I'd be put off by the gimmickry dominating Manhattan fine dining, and revel in the persistence of confident, comfortable old school mainstays like Felidia. Ms. Bastianich may technically be a restaurant mogul, but a decidedly ungaudy one. Here, your $30+ entree won't buy vapor-brushed bathroom doors, Gossip Girl cast member sightings, or ninjas doing magic. It buys you well-executed FOOD - not tapas, amuse-bouches, or cheese foam - but hearty, delicious portions of technically sophisticated pastas, fish, carne and tiramisu (limoncello flavored, in fact!) that hit the molto italiano nail on the head. You sense that the servers have been trained more by time than by finishing schools.They aren't overly svelte, beautiful, or sycophantic, but no-nonsense, practical, and disarmingly knowledgeable about the menu and the wine list.The decor evokes an era your parents and grandparents would recognize, but not in any self-conscious or ironical way. Felidia feels old-fashioned, because it's thirty years old. The yellow lights and pink tablecloths will shamelessly make scenesters, transient finance hot shots, and aspiring models feel out of place in order to cater to a more timeless sensibility - and for that prudence, I rather approve!",10,7,7,Liz C.,"Brooklyn, NY",643,600,3

I was so looking forward to coming here, as it was on my bookmark forever and a day. Jacket is preferred for gents here, but not required. It's surprisingly big with two floors. We were seated in the private room on the second floor. The duck pappardelle (~$20) primi dish was very well received so I need to order that next time, along with the lobster broth ($21). We passed on the Bastianich wine (she co-owns Mozza vineyards in Italy w/ Mario Batali). On our way out, as we made our way downstairs we saw someone freshly preparing pasta and bringing the pan to the table. I need to find out how to order that next time.

4.0,2/27/2010,"You must order correctly. Meaning order the pasta of the day! It is fresher than the other pastas (so it seemed), even though the other pastas are still spectacular. We started with the creamy lemon shrimp with spaghetti squash, followed by the pasta of the day (chocolate ravioli stuffed with the smoothest melt in your mouth warm bursting ricotta cheese I've ever had), third dish the pecorino romano and pear stuffed ravioli was delicious but not nearly as mouthwatering as the chocolate ravioli. Finally, we had the veal tenderloin with beef cheek. While it was good, we probably should have gone for the hangar steak given how rich and buttery everything was. Hangar is less fatty and would have been a better 4th dish choice. Dessert was good the nutella flan with pistachio ice cream and a plate of complimentary mini cookies. We shared a bottle of Bastianich's red wine La Mozza Aragone mostly Sangiovese grapes from the Tuscany region which was surprisingly complex, full and did not overwhelm the pasta. Her house wines are a good deal at 2x retail value vs all the other wines which average 4x retail like typical restaurants. Would definitely come here again, the pasta is on par with Dell'Anima's, my favorite, better than Babbo's and totally blows away Del Posto (which really is not in the running). The ambiance is a little more formal but jeans with a nice top are ok. Average age of patron was 50, not exaggerating. But don't let that deter you from good pasta. Service was excellent, down to the bread crumb scraper (that gets me all the time, very old school and demanded in the 40+ crowd fine dining establishments, a big positive for Felidia, it's the details!). Why not 5 stars? There is so much competition in NYC. If Felidia were in Boston, SF or anywhere else in the US, I'd give 5 stars for sure (I give stars relative to nearby competition).

The bathrooms downstairs were not what one would expect from a place as expensive as this -- trash overflowing, empty toilet paper roll, messy. Overall the place does not feel special, very run of the mill.The food was also disappointing. Broccoli rabe app was overcooked and mushy. Special beef carpaccio app was doused with way too much lemon (and I like a lot of lemon). I had a liver main and it was about 8 huge chunks of tough, flavorless liver on polenta with very little flavor anywhere on the plate. A special 30-year vinegar was drizzled on top at table but was so little it didn't even make a dent in the flavor! I will give a thumbs up on the wine, and they have a huge selection of many pricey wines but also make it easy for you to order good ones that won't break the bank. Service was so-so.

5.0,10/21/2009,"Having dined at Becco (one of Lydia's other popular restaurants in nyc) over a dozen times and only two times at Felidia, I noticed elements of Becco throughout the meal including the same plates, a very similar but slightly more exotic bean puree before the meal, similar bread and bread sticks, and similar colors/decor throughout the restaurant. Everything else, including the service (our waiter was as professional and knowledgeable as can be), the presentation (we loved the way they brought the pan of made to order pasta to the prep area upstairs and plated it to order on steaming hot plates) , the quality of food, and  the clientele of business lunchers (as opposed to pre broadway tourists at Becco) is clearly is worth $7 more than Becco for the pasta special. Granted, you don't get ""all you can eat,"" but do you really need all you can eat at lunch? You really can tell the difference from made to order, fresh pasta from the mass made (perfectly acceptable) pasta at Becco.  You will also pay a few bucks more if you order wine. Now to the food. We started with Orecchiette with broccoli rabe and pesto.  We loved the slight bitterness that the broccoli brought to the dish. Next, came a duo plate with Pear and fresh pecorino-filled ravioli, aged pecorino, crushed black pepper - It was so light. I would have thought it would be too sweet but it was perfect.  On the other plate was  (brown) Tagliatelle with a sauce of pork and mushrooms. You could tell that the mushrooms were high quality. It was a hearty pasta. This is a top notch restaurant. Based on today's meal, I would give it a 4 star rating. I am giving it a five star rating because I remember back to a chef's choice tasting menu dinner maybe two years ago with business colleagues.

My suspicion was someone who suffers from either an eating disorder or needed to get into a very tiny dress in a short amount of time.  What I do know is - to quote the sage Shaggy - ""it wasn't me"".I certainly appreciate the visual presentation that a small amount of beautiful food on a big plate offers, but come on we are in a recession.  I want to feel like I am getting my monies worth and this nouveau riche presentation makes me feel like I am getting jipped.So back to the missing chicken...I was at Felidia and was informed the special for the evening was a full roast chicken with potato's and spinach for two.  I LOVE roast chicken, I LOVE potato's and I LOVE spinach, I probably would have been able to eat it all myself but I easily convinced one of my fellow diners to share it with me.  Everything was going very well. The wine recommended was very good and the bread selection kept me distracted from the service being a bit slow.  Who cares about the wait when there is fresh roast chicken on the way and bread and wine to enjoy?The entire chicken arrived, I saw it.  It was de-boned and presented butterfly in the pan, it smelled wonderful and looked even better.  This was going to be good...and it was.  The folks at Felidia know how to roast a chicken.  There were five small pieces on my plate and a dab of spinach with a couple of potato's my friends portion was the same.  I devoured it and was ready for more.  And stupid me I thought there was more. I saw an entire chicken and the ten little pieces between us certainly did not equal a whole chicken.  Where is the rest? I wondered.I asked the waiter - yes I know I am soo tacky, but I could not believe that those ten little pieces was the entire chicken and we bought the whole chicken.  The waiter assured me there were no seconds or doggy bags waiting for me and I'm not tacky enough to argue but I am still suspicious.

My brother had pear ravioli which was AMAZING..I should have had that or even the scallops which were equally savory.For my entree I had the salmon which had a crisp skin and came with swiss chard. The portion was perfect and was satisfying without being gluttonous. I also had the peach tiramisu which was served in a cup with lots of cream. I also had tea which was served in a proper pot. The only drawback was that they give such a small amount of sugar (small in the sense that I require about 6 spoonfuls...it's disgusting and I don't care)I would highly recommend this place for large or small parties. The people were nice, the ambience and decor was lovely and I couldn't find anything distinctly negative to say (try as a might).It's not your typical italian restaurant..much better",4,0,4,Samantha S.,"Brooklyn, NY",125,377,44
5.0,6/15/2009,"So, I'm a Lidia fan for sure.  I have been here about 5-6 times.  This place is just perfect for a quiet, amazingly prepared meal and I have never been disappointed.  The atmosphere is reserved, but warm.  The service is attentive, but unobtrusive.  Favorites on the menu include the Istrian wedding pillows (ravioli filled with a sweet mixture in a veal broth), the pear and pecorino ravioli and the various game selections.  The prix fix lunch is a great bargain.",0,0,0,Jennifer T.,"Mineola, NY",1,11,0
4.0,6/4/2009,"""We make everything in the kitchen.""  says our server.""That's...good, I guess.  Better there than the bathroom, I suppose."" says his apparently unfunny patron. (That would be me.)"". . . . "" says the still smiling server.""Oh, just bring us whatever the chef is making...in the kitchen."" in a tone that suggests a nice pat on the server's cheek.  (His face, that is.)And so begins our experience of Felidia's chef's tasting menu, which as advertised, was made on the premises.  Our meal included Carpaccio with shaved asparagus and truffle butter, Ravioli con Cacio e Pere (Ravioli stuffed with pecornio and pear), Porcini Pappardelle with duck ragu, and Quail Saltimbocca.  This meal was more fantastical than I've had in a long, long while.  I was quite tempted to give it the big ol' 5-star rating, but there were a few nits to pick.  Gratefully and humbly, I had no problems with the phenomenal fare, nor did I balk at the $85 price tag (x2 for my partner in gastronomic mayhem).  The pastas were incredible - especially the (all too meager portions) of ravioli.  The quail saltimbocca was a savory surprise to the palate - a party in your mouth.What did kick it down a notch was the dessert, the wine pairings and (to a lesser extent) the service.  The dessert tasting was a plate of four:  Il Tiramisu (theirs is very imaginative, with lemon and citrus flavors as opposed to coffee), Mini-Caprese chocolate cake, a Palacinche, and hazelnut-chocolate flan.  With the exception of the Tiramisu, the others didn't stand up.The wine pairings I left to the discretion of the sommelier. I think he'd gone home for the night, seeing as our reservation was at 9 p.m. and the waiter appeared to be reaching for whatever white and red bottles were open at the bar.  Oh well.The service was meh.  We started off on the right foot, with a friendly, sharply-dressed and intelligent server (he put up with my bad jokes, so he's a-o.k. in my book).  As the meal progressed, however, we were passed off from one server to another, until finally it seemed as though the bus boy was left to serve us coffee and dessert.  (Maybe the chefs did the same thing, which would explain our dessert crisis.)So, all in all, a truly fantastic meal with all the makings of a five-star establishment.  Kind of like watching a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat through its entirety and then decides to have a Scooby-Doo ending.  WHAT?!  The bus boy actually WAS the chef in disguise the whole time?!?  Those damn kids.",4,6,2,Nils E.,"San Francisco, CA",154,101,1

4.0,5/26/2009,"My wife and I went last Saturday night.  It was her first time and my third or fourth.  We decided to have the $85 pp Chef's Tasting Menu.  We were both pretty hungry and hadn't gone out like this in too long.First course was crudo, nicely executed, well balanced and very refreshing for a late spring evening.  Second course was all about the octopus.  There were 3-4 different types of beans, grilled octopus, and something that looked like octopus pate that was served on top of a light bean spread.  Overall, it was a very good course.Third course was one of the signature dishes at Felidia.  It was the ravioli stuffed with pear and pecorino.  Delicious.  My wife would have loved a larger portion as an entree.Fourth course was tagliatelle with duck ragu.  It was very good but nothing that you couldn't have eaten at any number of other places.Fifth course, take 1, was roast chicken with potato and spinach.  The chicken was shown to us at our table before being whisked away and carved.  I was kinda surprised, and disappointed, to see chicken on the tasting menu.  Don't get me wrong, I love a good roast chicken but would rather not see it on a chef's tasting menu.  For better, or worst, it was inedible.  It was overly salted.  The waiter observed that we weren't eating it and immediately asked if there was a problem.  We told him and the plates were whisked away.Fifth course, take 2, was veal three ways.  Sweetbreads, stewed, and pounded.  The pounded veal was served under baby asparagus that was under some melted, and crunchy, cheese.  This was a nice dish that was appropriate for a tasting menu.We received a small complimentary cheese course.  We were told that it was being served due to the previous error.  The interesting part of the cheese course was the sausage that the cheese sat on.  It was made of fruits.  Plums, figs, and one other which I don't recall.  It was very thinly sliced.Dessert was a sampler.  Each of us received a plate was divided into four mini dishes.  Rhubarb with ricotta cheesecake, a flourless type chocolate cake, an almond tart and tiramisu made with limoncello instead of coffee.Lastly, we received a small plate with a variety of maybe 4 small cookiees.Service was very good and we great appreciate the professionality with which they handled the chicken situation.",0,0,0,Jon K.,"Paramus, NJ",1695,331,537
3.0,5/4/2009,"This is the first part of a Bastianich double-header.  I decided to have the prix-fixe lunch at Felidia, and then later the tasting menu at Del Posto for dinner just to see how they compare.  Unfortunately, it wasn't even close.  At Felidia, they have a prix-fixe lunch special allowing the choice of antipasti, secondi, and dolci for only $29.95 plus tax and gratuity.  This is an amazing value to be sure given the portion sizes, but the overall quality was lacking.  Antipasti:  I opted for the Capesante ""Saltimbocca"".  Literally meaning ""jumps in the mouth"", but I certainly felt otherwise.  The presentation was exquisite with a bacon wrapped Maine diver scallop as the centerpiece resting on a bed of spinach.  To either side was a crispy swatch of speck and an elegant, yet simple salad.  There was a wonderful aroma of the ocean emanating from this dish.  The blend of land and sea elements was visually beautiful and appetizing.  But the scallop was only so good, and its taste was completely masked -- if not inundated -- by the bacon.  For seafood, this was an especially heavy beginning to the meal.  The speck was divine, but otherwise I had mixed feelings with respect to this dish.Secondi:  I had the Tagliatelle Verdi di Fara San Martino con Bolognese.  Again, an elegant presentation, but the dish was lacking.  Even though it was spinach pasta, I really did not pick up this enhanced flavor in the dish.  Further, the bolognese which was a veal, beef, and pork ragu just felt muddled.  I could not pick out any of the distinct protein flavors, and the marriage with the noodles was not harmonious.  Also the cut of the noodles seemed a bit narrow for tagliatelle.  Dolci:  I was very pleased to see an Istrian specialty on this prix-fixe menu, the Palacinche.  (Lidia Bastianich was born in Istria, not Italy).  The crepes were exceptional, truly the only standout in the entire meal.  But the pairing with the sorbet was another miss.  So, all in all, the food was just okay and the service was minimally adequate if not borderline rude (I was not certain if at one point a joke was being made at my expense).  If I had not known in advance, I would have been very surprised to learn that this is a celebrity chef restaurant -- very disappointing in that regard.  2.75 stars, but I rounded up.",2,0,0,Jim U.,"Washington, DC",690,1303,3044

2.0,4/3/2009,"There are more than a handful of classic Manhattan restaurants that, despite the economy, have truly stood the test of time.  Some that immediately come to mind are (most of these I've not been to): The Four Seasons, Felidia, 21 Club, Peter Luger Steakhouse and Rao's.  Growing up, I used to watch Lidia Bastianich's cooking program on PBS and hoped that one day, I'd be able to dine in one of her many NYC restaurants.  In the five years that I've lived in Manhattan, I've only been to Becco, Lidia's theater district Italian.  Finally, after spending half of a decade in the Big Apple, I paid pilgrimage to Queen Bastianich's flagship restaurant, Felidia. Struggling to justify paying over $20 for a plate of pasta, I was elated to learn that on Monday's through Friday's from 4:30pm-6:15pm, Felidia offers a ""Dinner for 2 for under $100"" which includes 3-courses and bottle of Bastianich wine.  With a deal like that, my friend Allie and I made a 5:30p.m. reservation for Tuesday night.In true Lunch Belle fashion, I arrived at Felidia 20 minutes early.  The place was completely empty, with the exception of the staff.  I grabbed a seat at the bar, ordered a glass of Moscato d'Asti (though the enormous glass jars filled with homemade fruit-infused grappa looked fantastic) and began surveying my surroundings.  The restaurant occupies the first two floors of a lovely townhouse, and its space is broken in to several dining areas.  Felidia is richly decorated with Oriental rugs, dim lighting, mahogany wood-paneled walls, and a warm Tuscan color palate.  While I was sipping my Moscato, I caught a glimpse of Lidia.  The bar tender told me that she was being interviewed in the main dining room...I was star struck!  Unfortunately, she left minutes before Allie arrived.We were promptly seated at a spacious table for two.  After gorging myself on too much cheese and wine in Paris, I told Allie that there was no way I'd be able to eat and drink what was offered on the 3-course menu.  Our waitress greeted us and was under the impression that we were going to order the dinner special.  When I told her that we weren't, she put up a skillful sales fight.  After we rejected her solicitations at least three times, she finally gave up.Upon receiving a glass of wine, Allie and I placed our entrée orders.  Though our waitress tried to upsell appetizers, we both annoyingly declined.  I chose the ""Pear and fresh pecorino-filled ravioli with aged pecorino and crushed black pepper,"" which happens to be Felidia's signature pasta.  A bountiful basket containing breadsticks, focaccia and paper-thin crackers arrived along side a dish with an ""ice cream scoop"" of bright green pea ""dip.""  With a texture similar to hummus, the pea dip was incredibly fresh, flavorful and unique.  I tasted notes of olive oil, crushed red pepper, garlic and the market's freshest emerald-green peas.  Paired with the assortment of fresh breads, I thought to myself, ""If our entrees are nearly as good as this, I'm going to be in love."" Not long after receiving bread and dip, our entrees arrived.  I was both shocked, yet not very surprised (expect the worst, hope for the best) by the small portion size of my dish.  Luckily, this was a blessing in disguise.  Swimming in a shallow butter sauce were long ravioli ""tubes"" filled with spicy pecorino cheese and the most subtle kiss of pear.  The pasta was topped with more pecorino and a delicate dusting of black pepper.  After my first bite, I was overwhelmed by cheese and butter. The black pepper and pear filling did nothing flavor or contrast-wise to my entrée, as both were barely distinguishable.  I found my meal to be rather bland and much too heavy.  (Now remember, I had just returned from France where I spent a week indulging in some of the world's richest foods, so I am confident when I say that if I thought this dish was over-the-top, it was.)  Our check arrived with a small dish of homemade petite fours, which included a delicious pistachio cookie topped with a dollop of lemon curd.In conclusion, I found my experience at Felidia to be average:  The service was a bit too intrusive and aggressive, my pasta was sub par, and the price point was steep.  Should I return in the future, I'll make a meal out of bread, pea dip and a couple of glasses of bubbly at the bar.",3,1,1,Lindsay F.,"New York, NY",376,277,184

5.0,3/2/2009,"I've loved watching Lidia's cooking shows for years because everything she makes looks incredibly delicious. But I never thought I'd get the chance to try her cooking since I'm a West Coast gal. I was fortunate enough to be whisked off to NYC two springs ago for a romantic weekend and even luckier to discover that we could get a Saturday night reservation on short notice.The restaurant is located in a brownstone in a somewhat residential neighborhood, and the interior is very intimate. We were seated on the ground floor, not far from the wine bar, at a small table for two. We started with an appetizer of fresh spring vegetables: asparagus, fava beans, and greens served with a soft-cooked egg and fresh mozzarella. My date immediately decided to have the vegetable risotto with the aged balsamic vinegar. I was agonizing over which to choose, the rabbit ragout with fresh pasta or the lobster ravioli. I asked the waiter which he recommended because they both sounded so good, and he said, ""Why not try both?"" Why not, indeed! And so I was served half portions of both pastas, both prepared tableside on a little hot plate. I was in absolute heaven with both of my dishes. They were easily the best Italian food I've ever had, in the States or Italy, and my well-travelled date agreed.Seemingly impossibly, our dining experience got even better when I ordered the limoncello tiramisu for dessert. Since I love tiramisu and anything lemony, this was truly perfection for me. We ended up closing down the restaurant, and I will remember this as one of the best meals I've ever had.

So when we were in New York for a wedding we took him there for his birthday, hoping we'd have a great food experience and maybe catch a peek of Lydia.Well they really saw us coming and knew exactly how to treat us. They knew we were the casual types. Granted we are from SF and have dined in some great restaurants but we don't stand on ceremony. When dad asked for a bottle of wine, they brought one out, opened it and poured. He deemed it fantastic, high on the whole experience. Being responsible for the bill, I was quaking in my boots as I'd purused their incredibly 'diverse' wine list online.  It turned out to be the cheapest $40 table wine in the house. They are true artistes and I loved them for their excellent flair for just carrying a party through each moment in precisely the way those particular people should be. I'm sure it's possible to hit or miss some crowds, but I doubt Felidia's staff does it often. They threw all the native Italians at us who fawned over us like we were their own family.That said this place is obviously capable of the finest formal service - I was just totally impressed at their ability to quickly adapt to whatever the tone of a party was.I swooned over my appetizer of Chicken liver: trifolo and pate. The truffled mash was just amazing, and the pate sublime. As an entree they highly recommended the venison to me, which I found to be far too chewy and didn't much enjoy. My father had the tripe, transporting himself back to a time at his mother's table. I must say I have a bit of an 'opportunity-vs-price-point' issue around ordering the offal at such a phenomenal restaurant, but that's what he wanted.Overall it was really a wonderful and unforgettable experience.

1.0,2/3/2008,"Wow, what a great disappointment this Ristorante Italiano was!  I decided to try this place out due to the great reviews they received on opentable.com as well as other sites.  I am also familiar with and like Lidia's cooking show on TV so I figured it would be a great dining experience.  Everything was disappointing including the service, management and food.  Our server was either new or very uneducated about Italian foods and what she was serving as she had difficulties clarifying some of the dishes on the menu.  She also asked me repeatedly (about 3 times) if I wanted wine when I made it clear that I do not drink.  I felt like she was desperate to upsell for a bigger gratuity or something!  My friend and I started off with the caprese salad and the seafood salad.  We were expecting fresh mozzarella burrata or mozzarella di bufala but instead we got small balls of mozzarella which tasted like the kind you can get at the grocery store.  The seafood salad consisted of a few minuscule pieces of raw salmon arranged sloppily with a few pieces of tomato or rather tomato pulp and a sprig of dill.  The menu said something about a ""seafood salad"" which is hardly what was served and at $24 was a total waste of money.  For the entree I decided to try the pear and pecorino cheese ravioli which everyone was raving about online and what I received was some rather bland ravioli which was cold on the inside.  The pears were crispy and did not meld well with the pecorino cheese.  My friend got the lobster risotto which was a bit mushy and runny for a risotto.As you can see, our dinner was pretty darn bad but we had faith that at least the gelati here would be decent because I had never been to an italian restaurant in New York who didn't have at least a decent gelato but we were definitely wrong about this as well!I ordered the chocolate gelato which I was really excited about because my meal was so bad.  I lived in Rome for 4 months last winter and ate gelato ""artiginale"" or artisian style at least 3 times a day with my native Italian friends.  The Artiginale gelato in Rome is  made carefully in small batches daily with the freshest ingredients  so I think I know a little bit about gelato and what they served me at Felidia was worse than than the gelato they served at McDonalds in Rome!  In fact their ""gelato"" was not even gelato.  It was regular American ice cream and to add insult to injury they put chocolate sauce all over it which they would NEVER do at real gelateria's in Italy.  How do I know it was regular American ice cream?  It had a lot of air in it and the flavor was very weak and not intense like a real Italian chocolate gelato.  The color was a light brown due to the fact that American ice cream is made with cream while Italian gelato is made with milk and pure chocolate so when you go to Italia you will see the the chocolate gelato is a very dark dark brown like a bar of 72% dark chocolate would be.I was so upset about this that I told the server that this was not real gelato and she said ""Oh I thought gelato just means ice cream in italian"" which is true but gelato and ice cream are made totally differently and with different ingredients which she did not seem to comprehend.  She even brought the Italian manager over who told me that this American ice cream was in fact ""gelato"" and that he was from Rome and this ""gelato"" served at Felidia's was better than the gelato found in the artisinal gelato shops in Rome.  I was absolutely horrified.  If they ran out of gelato and had to run to the store to get American ice cream as a substitute, they can just admit that fact instead of insulting me by thinking I would be stupid enough to  believe that this ice cream they were serving me was gelato.  I am sorry for ranting but this was the biggest disappointment from an Italian restaurant that I have ever experienced in New York and I think that Lidia should perhaps look into why the quality of her food was so poor last night.  I will never be going back here again even if they offered me a free meal.",4,0,0,Tamae I.,"Los Angeles, CA",366,49,24
2.0,10/18/2007,"First, Fortunato Nicotra is a genius.  I've been craving the food we had at Felidia since I went with my fiancee in February, but I refuse to go back based on the service we got there.It took us 30 minutes to get seated and another 15 to get menus.  We were almost totally ignored by the wait staff.  The waiter told us the specials while filleting a fish for another table, lost our wine order, leaving us to eat the stellar broccoli rabe and burrata appetizer without wine.  When I complained, he didn't even turn around from fawning over another table.Our mains appeared and I was given a fork with a bent tine. No big deal, but it was five minutes before I could flag anyone down to replace it, and no one ever checked up on us.The food itself was phenomenal to a morsel. Unreal. But the service makes it not worthwhile to return. I live around the corner and would've become a regular.  Maybe they can deliver?I emailed lidiasitaly.com about this poor experience in February and got no reply.",2,0,1,Rich A.,"New York, NY",11,14,0
5.0,9/20/2007,"What a delicious meal!  I love watching Lidia's Kitchen on PBS and had to try her restaurant.  I tried the Bastianich (Lidia's last name) white wine, which was fabulous.  I had a delicious ravioli dish with pear and cheese in a white wine and butter sauce it was quite deliciouso.  For desert I had a butternut squash tiramisu and they served complimentary linzer tart-type deserts.  They also brought over a complimentary ""box of cigars"" that were filled with espresso cookies.  I felt like I died and went to heaven.  I totally recommend this restaurant to anyone who appreciates good italian cooking.  Yum!",3,0,2,Laurie S.,"Astoria, NY",11,21,0

5.0,6/21/2007,"Oh ma god!  The food was AMAZING here!  I've been wanting to check out Felidia for 1 yr now after seeing Lidia's show but just never got around to it.  FInally I went last week and am so HAPPY that I did!  Normally, I find expensive gourmet restaurants disappointing and not worth the price, but I can honestly say the food is absolutely worth it here!!After reading Charlotte's review (THANKS!), we tried the Rock Shrimp appetizer......uh.....I'm trying to think of other adjectives besides YUMMY, DELICIOUS, AMAZING, PHENOMENAL...but nothing seems to come to mind...hahaha.  I love the surprising hint of lemon in this dish.I had the Seafood pasta which was pretty good (although my pasta was a little too hard, 3 more min of boiling and it would have been a 10!).  My friends had the calamari linguine and the special: veal chop on top of some greens (the chop was as big as my arm!)  Both loved it and it was cooked perfectly.They also served us complimentary cookies which was great!  The service was a bit on the slow side especially considering we had an early dinner and there were only 2 other tables, but I am DEF going back there!!",4,0,3,C A.,"San Francisco, CA",28,283,22
5.0,6/5/2007,"Went here with a group of 4 to celebrate a friend's birthday.  It was fabulous - from the drink at the bar to desert!  We were a tad early for the reservations so we sat at the bar and had a drink, the bar has a menu of drinks and the bartender is helpful and classy.  We had a seat on the second floor right up against the banister overlooking the first floor which was great!  When you sit down they bring out 3 different pate's - 1 is roasted red peppers, 1 is pesto'ish, and the 3rd olives - all very good.  For appetizers we had the rock shrimp (THE BEST EVER), beet salad, and the asparagus (forgot all of the proper names)!   For entrees - I had the soft shell crab special, someone else had the pear and pecorino ravioli which i admit were the BEST of the entrees even though everything was delicious, then the other 2 was the other ravioli and the tuna bolognese.  For desert we shared the tiramisu and the apple/rhubarb tart... of course I'm going to say they were good... because everything was superb!  I am honestly already planning on my boyfriend taking me back for my bday!We even caught  Lidia herself walking around shaking hands and greeting her guests!",4,0,2,Charlotte S.,"Tappan, NY",35,255,0
3.0,5/31/2007,"Audrey was right, that pear and pecorino-filled ravioli is awesome, I should've ordered it as an entree though the soft shell crab special was delicious as well.my only gripe about this place was when I made the reservation 2-3 wks ago, they made me give a credit card to hold the reservation and when I called the day of to confirm, the hostess was very rude and said there was no reservation etc. and damn near close to hang up on me. after making me spell my long last name 10 times, she finally figured out the person who took the reservation initially made it for June 29th instead of may 29. thankfully she said not to worry, that there would be a table for us when we got there, but she never apologized for being rude and not wanting to help at 1st. she's lucky I didn't see her there when I arrived, I was ready to get stankps: the bathroom was kinda smelly",1,0,1,Theresa X.,"Manhattan, NY",70,216,77
3.0,9/29/2006,"We were so excited to have dinner at Felidia in NYC.  We made our reservations, showed up a bit early to have a drink at the bar and after a bit of a wait, made our way to our table.  Felidia is small in front, with low ceilings, dark wood paneling and trim and a larger, brighter back room with an upstairs area for additional dining.  We found the staff to be friendly, professional and very helpful.  We wish we could say the same for the food.  Our meal started out well enough with Liz having Lobster with heirloom tomato, basil and mozzerella.  The dish was very tasty and nicely presented.  I had the carpaccio, which was also very nicely done and presented.Our main courses is where things fell down.  Liz had the wedding pillows and they were, at least to us, waayyyy too sweet.   Tasted alot like fruitcake.  If this is the intention, then it was successful and just not the dish for us.  Ron had the risotto with Humboldt Fog goat cheese.  It was a bit underdone for my taste and lacked the creamy quality I've come to expect from a good risotto.  Desserts were also a letdown.  Ron's chocolate and Chestnut pudding tasted like jello chocolate pudding complete with skin!  Liz had the sorbets which were a bit more successful.  A bland selection of cookies accompanied the check.We hate to be so down, but we were so disappointed!!!  We wanted to love our dining experience and while the staff did their best, the kitchen fell down and could have done much better.Perhaps we'll visit again on our next trip and try it out with better results.  -Ron & Liz",2,0,1,Ron T.,"Oakland, CA",21,260,2
4.0,4/21/2006,"Felidia was pretty dang good, but be sure to order the pasta!  I do so regret not ordering the pasta. Italian is for pasta!! :) I had the Maine diver scallops (which were pretty good, but not nearly as amazing as the pear and pecorino-filled ravioli) for my first course. For my second course, I ordered the grilled salmon, which was also good, but I'm STILL fixating on the ravioli!! Dessert was interesting. It was tiramisu, but it wasn't the traditional tiramisu we were expecting. The tiramisu was citrus-inspired, so there was a lemony flavor to it (which was an interesting twist) and candied kumquats as a garnish (which was kinda weird). A solid lunch place with good food and a beautiful, light, open and airy atmosphere.",2,0,0,Audrey J.,"Los Angeles, CA",605,618,78
5.0,3/22/2006,"Enjoyed an evening of fine dining at this restaurant.  The menu changes with seasons, so that all ingredients are fresh.  I personally had the cheese ravioli.  However having sampled some of my dinner  companions food, I would have preferred the meat ravioli or gnocchi.  Wait staff was extremely knowledgeable of the menu and showed an enthusiasm for the dishes.  The decor was simple yet elegant.",1,0,0,Daniel H.,"New York, NY",4,153,30
