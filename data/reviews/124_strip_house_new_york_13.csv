3.0,4/22/2019,"Four star NYC steakhouse...can't go wrong right? ... wrong... I was sadly disappointed by strip house I heard a lot about this place and saved it for my fiancé's 30th birthday. I made a reservation for a Monday night (his actual birthday) and was asked if it was a special occasion and I told them it was his 30th birthday... this was not acknowledged at all throughout our meal (which isn't a huge deal because we don't like big displays but some acknowledgement would have been nice for him) I have to preface the review by saying the food was very very good but the service just did not feel four dollar signs or four stars worth. My water was not once refilled. We sat by the kitchen and I could hear conversations about who needed to bus what table. The waiter was nice but not attentive and did not take the time to make us feel like he actually cared whether or not we enjoyed our meal.

3.0,4/19/2019,"We had a dinner for 15 people that we had made a reservation for on a Wednesday night.. We had to crowd into a table for 10 in the center by the entrance to the kitchen.. Not pleasant.The food was good.. not great... The exception was the onion rolls..they were great..The scallop appetizer for $24.. two scallops, lots of mushrooms and some other root vegetable you can pass on..definitely not worth the price. Same for the Foie Gras.The Bacon appetizer was one of the few shareable appetizers on the menu.. That was really good.I had the 14 oz NY Strip. Perfectly cooked/ charred, but over seasoned. The service was excellent.. Martini's and old fashion's were good.Overall impression- It is an overpriced steakhouse.  That even charges $5 for the Bernaise and Au Poivre sauces. Stick to Peter Luger's, Capital Grille, Palm, Smith and Wollensky's,",1,0,0,Rob C.,"Nutley, NJ",61,5,0
5.0,4/9/2019,"We had an amazing dinner here and incredible service. This was the best steak I have ever had in a beautiful ambiance. The waiter was very helpful with helping me to navigate the menu with my gluten allergy. For an appetizer, my grandpa ordered the Caesar salad (big enough for 2 to share) and had a poached egg in it. He enjoyed the Caesar salad but it had croutons in it so it was not gluten free. I ordered the NY strip and I loved the pepper crust. The steak was big enough for 2 meals though. I ordered a side of the twice baked potatoes which were incredibly tasty. I contemplated getting an order of the potatoes to go! My boyfriend ordered the ribeye with cream of spinach and loved his as well. The cream of spinach is not gluten free though. My grandmother ordered the lobster bisque which she said was very rich and tasty. She also ordered the scallops which were in a sweet, cinnamon-y sauce (very unique and yummy). For dessert, we ordered the 24 layer cake (which was huge) and everyone else said was very tasty. We will definitely be returning!",0,0,0,Lindsey D.,"New York, NY",398,204,105
4.0,3/18/2019,"I told a friend I was going to the Strip House and she said really who's getting married? I was like what? You said strip house? Uh, its a steak house .... I think some how they like that moniker. The classy but subdue interior was a pleasant experience. Seating was comfortable surrounded by photographs of famous stars all staring at you while you eat. Our friendly server was casual and prompt. He introduce himself and got our drinks. He gave us a long list of specials but the only one that stuck was the lobster Mac & Cheese.I went with the NY strip while my friends choosed the filet and rib. The meat came simply presented on a plate. The meat after all was the star. It had a wonderful char but still perfectly cooked as ordered (mine was medium). The meat didn't even need the steak sauce. We got the crab cake to stare and a side of bake potato, fries and lobster Mac&Cheese. The baked potato came with the usual mixing and chopped bacon bits. Cake was equally enjoyable start. The fries were nice and crispy with a hint of salt and side of ketchup. Unlike fries the lobster Mac & Cheese was disappointment. It was more of a soupy goop and overly salty. One try and the rest was left on the table as the horrible step child of the other sides.We decided to try the 24 layer chocolate cake which delivered. The decadent dense chocolate cake was delicious way to cap off the caloric meal but all so worth it. It has to be worth the calories.I'd say the Strip House certainly delivered on the steak. The meat was juicy, perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Even the appetizers were enjoyable while the sides was a hit or miss in my book. You can't really go wrong with a baked potato or fries, all steakhouse staples but beware of the specials.",1,1,1,David N.,"Brooklyn, NY",123,631,903
1.0,3/16/2019,"Let me first say- this is the BEST steak in nyc. I have been here 13 years and upon finding it a few years ago I am obsessed. The food is always INCREDIBLE and so was our waitress last night. She really tried to make the best of the situation we were given. So almost a month ago, I called to make a reservation for my birthday dinner. My dad was flying in just for the chocolate cake! We celebrated my 30th here and we had come to make a tradition of him coming and us dining here. I told the host on the phone that is was my birthday. Last night we come and we're on time for our reservation. We were sat in the alcove almost between the 2 sets of double doors to go into the kitchen. This meant all night runners were bumping me (I'm tiny and was squeezed in as far as possible. We always had runners standing over our table waiting until they were needed elsewhere. But the worst part was every 30 seconds when someone came out of the kitchen to run food, I had a flash of fluorescent light  when the restaurant is pretty dark. I had to leave before my dad even paid cause I developed a migraine from it. I have worked in NYC restaurants for over 10 years and was taken aback by this. This isn't a table you should get for a party of 4 with advance reservations for a special occasion! And the waitress didn't know it was my birthday until my dad told her. Usually the service here is great but this really missed the mark for me and ruined the experience.",1,0,0,Peg K.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,4,0
2.0,3/9/2019,Well I have to say the service was great right up until having paid they delivered our coats to the table as we were finishing the last drinks they had sold us. If they had informed us they needed us in and out within a time frame we could have worked with it or declined and gone elsewhere. Very poor!Steaks were average and expensive but we knew the second part of that statement prior to arrival. All other food was actually pretty good.

4.0,3/2/2019,"Food: 3.5/5I've been coming here for years. There are days where I think Strip House is the best and other days where I think Lugers is better. Call me weird but.. I think they might have a different chef on Tuesdays. We ordered a caesar salad and two dry aged strips. The strips (on Tuesday) were not good. It was over cooked, dry and tough. There's other times I ate here and it was heaven in my mouth so I'd give this place 3.5 due to their inconsistency.Btw, their 24 layer cake is PHENOMENAL.Service: 5/5The staff here are great. My water and wine glass never goes empty! Very friendly and attentive staff. Ambiance: 5/5This might be one of the nicer steak houses in NY.

The only downside was that my table was on athe corner , next to the bathroom and the servers and the customers would walk and hit my chair all the time... and also my server had a strong smell of cigarettes (he probably smoked before his shift and it was smelling like such, which isn't acceptable if you work as a server).I also had the winter Sangria which was amazing !!

4.0,1/30/2019,"Strip House is what you get if a traditional, old guard steakhouse and a vibrant and plush downtown lounge had a baby.A fun ambiance that takes some of the stuffiness of out the old steakhouse experience. Steaks are very good, and meals can be done family style which is a pretty neat experience in a steakhouse setting. Staff are very knowledgeable and attentive.You can drop some serious money here: For 5 people we did bottle of red wine ($95), 2 rounds of tequila shots (idk why), some folks did cocktails, full seafood tower, porterhouse for 2, special 40oz wagyu tomahawk, one ahi tuna, probably 4 sides, and a large slice of cake for dessert. With tip things came to ~$230 pp. (this was a random celebratory night for a friend's engagement).Great spot to take a date if they're a lover of a good steak and will appreciate an intimate but still lively environment. Similarly good for clients to have a friendlier experience.",2,1,1,Seth W.,"New York, NY",6,204,171
4.0,1/10/2019,"Had their sea scallops, tomahawk steak, brussel sprouts side and sorbet for dessert. Their tomahawk steak was cooked to perfection but their exterior seasoning was a bit too much. Their brussel sprouts were good but would have tasted better if it was more savory instead of sweet and saucy. The menu stated ""roasted"" brussel sprouts but it doesn't look roasted at all... the service was great though and the interior design created a nice atmosphere. The searee sea scallops as appetizer was a pretty good choice - came in two big pieces and was savory with each bite I took.",0,0,0,Wendy T.,"Queens, NY",369,190,406
4.0,1/9/2019,"+.5 for serviceI decided on Strip House after some recommendations from friends and seeing overwhelmingly positive reviews here. I reserved a table for 7pm and we were served almost immediately (with a convenient detour to coat check).I had the lobster bisque, crab cake, and porterhouse for two. Stop me when I say this, but the lobster bisque was the best I've ever had, and I've had them from almost 50-60 restaurants by now. It's certainly pricey at $17, but the end result more than makes up for it.The crab cake was also very good, though I wouldn't say extraordinary like the lobster bisque. The porterhouse steak was overcooked a little bit, but only to medium (I usually order one lower at medium rare in case something like that happened). Regardless it was absolutely delicious and definitely deserves the rank near the top for steakhouses in NYC.Huge note here that I didn't seem to find on the website: There is a dress code. Anything with a collar will suffice, but you won't get treatment if you arrive wearing athletic gear/casual wear or the likes.Definitely a place I'd recommend if you can't Peter Luger your way to that restaurant.",0,0,0,Calvin S.,"Winnipeg, Canada",75,1210,1340

As sides we had the garlic fries and the Goose fat potatoes. We were quiet staffed after that. But we couldn't resist ordering the chocolate cake. This is a total must!!! So delicious. One is fully enough for two. We couldn't finish it and took to go. The interior is really classic and cool. Good music was played as well. The only downside was that no information was shared that the Fiji water cost 9$ and we payed for the bread for each of us 16$.

1.0,12/15/2018,"Three of us were looking to have a great meal at this upscale restaurant but for the money we spent, $450, we were quite disappointed.While my filet mignon was good, my wife's rack of lamb was just OK as was our friend's rib eye. Shrimp cocktail was good as was the foie gras. The sides were actually underwhelming. The French fries were nondescript, the spinach was inundated with cheese and the baked potato was just that. The desert, their signature 24 layer chocolate cake, was dry and no better than the chocolate layer cake found in a local NYC diner.Service was good but we were being rushed out immediately after finishing our meal  by the waitress and manager.In sum, the overall impression we were left with is that this restaurant was indifferent to the satisfaction of their customers.

I've tired espresso Creme brûlée because my friend recommended that and knew I love eat that. Oh boy, it was really fantastic. I enjoyed that more than their steak.

Definitely too sugary for my taste. Server knew it wasn't supposed to have cream when she delivered it to me since she said the bartender made it with cream on accident. So why not just make a new one if you know it's incorrect? Strip steak and sides were good but don't live up to the prices. Luckily I wasn't the one paying so it's fine with me, but would prefer more flavor if I was paying myself. Wine was delicious.

5.0,11/18/2018,"Excellent! Standards are certainly higher when going to a pricey steak house but I can say with confidence you will not be disappointed here. The interior is a cool, red-hued old-school decor that gives off a slightly upscale but casual vibe. The dress code ranged from casual to dressy so feel free to rock whatever you are feeling that evening.ServiceThe service of course is outstanding - not overbearing but they know exactly how to time everything up. Our server also was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and different meats.  CocktailsBetween my boyfriend and I, we tried the Rye Chai, a Tito's Martini, and the Barrel Aged Old Fashioned. The Rye Chai is amazing but you can probably skip the Barrel Aged Old Fashioned and opt for a regular, less expensive one. FoodEverything was incredible. We started with the Charred Iceberg Salad as an appetizer. For dinner I ordered the 14 oz Dry Aged Strip and my boyfriend had the 14 oz Dry Aged Rib Eye. For sides we ordered the Crisp Goos Fat Potatoes and the Creamed Corn w/ Pancetta. And we had the Bordelaise sauce and the complimentary steak sauce. We truly enjoyed everything!

5.0,10/28/2018,"It is a rare occasion when I get to venture to New York to dine so I had to return to one of the establishments that created so many of my fond memories from previous trips, Strip House. This old, seemingly mafia style, steakhouse has been aiming to please New York City diners for years. Their menu is classic, yet innovative, offering a smaller selection than most other steakhouses but perfecting everything they serve. So when I tell you that you cannot go wrong, I mean it. My friend and I started with Moscow mules as one should and awaited our meal. I ordered the steak tartar to star because it is my absolute favorite starter and I feel as if I have to get it any time it appears on a menu. When it arrived the presentation was beautiful, a deep red beef, mixed with many herbs, topped with fried capers and pickles. The pickles were sliced thin and the capers added a little bit of crunch to the dish which is welcomed in a dish that is usually mono-textural. The quail egg was deep in color and rich, which for this rendition of beef tartar was necessary. The tartar surprised me because it was mixed with a Moroccan chili oil, straying away from the usual delicate flavors of tartar the chef decided to use impact flavors (salt, chili raw herbs). When consuming so many types of tartar throughout your life, a new take on it can be refreshing because it demonstrates that the art of the dish is not lost in our modern culinary realm. We also shared the lump crab meat cocktail, which was served on a bed of ice, accompanied by a classic cocktail sauce and aioli. Both sauces were delicious but the star of the show was the crab meat itself, briny, fresh and somewhat firm, the crab was an excellent choice for the meal. For the main we ordered the 48-ounce porterhouse for 2, potato gratin, duck fat fried layered potato and miso broccoli. The steak was cooked perfectly to my liking, being mostly rare and extremely crispy on the top. Garnished with sea salt and some herbs. The meat was dry-aged so it had some funky qualities to it but mainly what stood out was how tender it was. The duck fat fried potato almost reminded me of an indian bahjee because of its presentation and the way it was seasoned. The crust was hard and crispy because of the duck fat and the fried garlic on top was a nice touch. The potato gratin had proper flavor but the layer of melted cheese on top was a little bit too heavy for my liking, I also wished that the potatoes were sliced a little thinner because then the dish is a little more delicate as a whole. The only dish I was not crazy about was the miso glazed broccoli, this dish seemed rushed because too much moisture was still being released from the broccoli due to a lack of straining, causing the glaze to come off and the dish to seem fairly bland. They also gave us mushrooms which were tossed in butter and fresh herbs on the house, that was too generous but was extremely delicious. I will always love the strip house and it did not disappoint, I will see you very soon. Cheers.",0,0,0,Aaron L.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,32,100

2.0,10/14/2018,"Was recommended this place by a friend after finishing a sauna session, shvitz specifically, so we weren't dressed up. Unfortunately we didn't have a great experience from the beginning due to their unspoken dress code so it seemed like an automatic judgment. With the benefit of the doubt, plus we were hungry, we started at the bar waiting for a table for two. The bartender was busy and didn't acknowledge us until we flagged him down, then someone else came over. 20mins later a table was ready and there was no transfer of tab. No biggie but surprising. We finally take a seat as the table next to us were just being seated as well. We had the same waiter and he was all over their table while we were still waiting for our typical introduction and water. Time passed we got sparking water and immediately order a bottle of red wine, so that should have triggered him that we had intentions on spending some money. After our first glass he had yet to come back so we had to pour our own glass after that. NOW it wouldn't be a thing if it were a regular chill restaurant, however you can tell it was upscale and the service should have matched their atmosphere and price points. ON TOP OF THAT the table next to us already had their first meal/appetizers already. FINALLY we get to start our order so we simply started with two fresh non cooked appetizers. TWENTY minutes later we were wondering why it was taking so long, we literally just got a Caesar salad and lump crab meat (which was clearly from a can) and we waved our waiter down. I GET IT GETS BUSY AND EVERYTHING ISN'T PERFECT, but this guy had FORGOT to put our order in and didn't remember what we had ordered. So now we are a BIT frustrated but 3min later our appetizers came, so we know he had it RUSHED. At this point we agreed that we DEFINITELY had to say something or our experience would continue to be level 1 when we're paying level 10 prices. After we spoke to a manager she apologized and switched our waiter and he definitely turned everything around!!!We did enjoy the rest of the night order ANOTHER bottle, bone and ribeye, salmon, potatoes Au gratin, Brussel sprouts. The manager did add crab cakes but didn't really eat them nor wanted to fill up on undesired food but it was a nice gesture. We didn't have dessert, I'm not really a dessert person, plus I was ready to go.Overall, the atmosphere is nice, business casual and food overall was delicious but not a first choice in recommendations.Atmosphere: 8/10Food: 8/10Service: first server 0.5 second server 5It's a great place to visit, the music was old school R & B and soul, just go dressed up and hopefully that'll change their expectation. - [ ] EXTRA PART: at the end I was doing a video review about the experience and the head chief was outside and took it to heart but my friend who overheard him told him the full story.

1.0,8/2/2018,"I used to frequent their location in Livingston, NJ years ago, but this was my first trip to the original Strip House. Unfortunately it was extremely disappointing. I started with steak tartare which was heavily over-seasoned, probably a 2.5/5 stars, but the main courses were an absolute disaster. They claim their meat is dry-aged, and it may be, but it was easily the worst quality dry aged bone-in NY Strip I've ever had. The presentation was nice (and they gave me an impressive piece of meat that must have been close to 2 inches thick), but it wasn't evenly cooked and the meat was just bad. It tasted like costco choice steak not prime-dry aged steak. To top things off it wasn't seasoned. How do you serve a NY Strip without salting it prior to cooking? I could have easily cooked myself a better steak at home. Hell for the price I could have gotten a steak from Lobels and cooked a meal that makes the Strip House meat look like a McDonalds burger. Food- 1/5Value- 1/5As mentioned above the food was terrible as was the value.Ambiance- 4/5The ambiance itself is nice and the place has a cool speakeasy-type feel to it.  Service- 2.5/5The service wasn't great.

5.0,6/30/2018,"Excellent restaurant! I say restaurant and not only a steakhouse, because this is a classy place where you dress up to and have great food that includes but is not limited to a steak. The sides were phenomenal. I mean the miso brocolli with almonds on top? What kind of steakhouse serves that combination. Ussually, you just get a bunch of steamed brocolli without anything. The duck fat potatoes were not our favorite, because they were simply lacking in flavour. Seems like they were pre boiled or steamed and then fried. The scallops appetizer was absolutely delicious with the avocado butter. Huge shrimp cocktail, but for some reasons they gave us only 4 shrimp. The norm is 5 to 6 shrimp in these cocktails. The waiter also said we would get 5, but we didn't bother him. The bone marrow special was also delicious and buttery. Hubby got Tomahawk Steak for two and I got the 12 oz. Fillet Mignon. Of course we finished off with the famous chocolate cake slice. That  piece is definitely egnouth for a party of 5 to 6 people. Will I be back? You bet!

1.0,6/2/2018,"It makes me lose confidence in the wisdom of the crowd when I see four yelp stars for a restaurant that is clearly undeserving... I am writing this as service to fellow yelpers who also love and appreciate good food -- this place is not for you. Let me explain.  Sure it's got decent vibes, old black and white photos on the walls, accented by a red decor, and not as cheesy as it sounds describing it.  So, if you come here just to hang by the bar and booze it up with buddies, I can see it working.Now the food is a different story.  We ordered a porterhouse for two, a 2-lb lobster steamed, the bacon appy, shrimp cocktail appy, caesar salad, lobster mac&cheese, truffled creamed spinach, fries, and the day's special ""farmers market veggies.""  I had a bite of each and no more.  First of all, everything was oversalted, unpalatably so.  Second, the ""farmers veggies consisted of snow peas, peas, water chestnut and two twigs of fern and while the fern might have been fresh, the others were clearly not and obviously redundant and not really what you'd think first when you order the special of the day.The steak was tough and flavorless, just awfully salty.  The shrimps were not fresh and gross.  the bacon should be salty but this was next level where it is the only thing you taste and none of the sweetness and flavor of the pork belly.  Now, I didn't walk into a decades long standing restaurant with high expectations for food; it was a casual occasion where drinks and conversation mattered more than what's for dinner.  But the fact that we were universally grossed out by the food, that reminded us more of college cafeteria provisions than an NYC restaurant, let alone 4 yelp starred joint, just boggles the mind.",4,0,1,Jay K.,"New York, NY",24,66,47
1.0,5/27/2018,"Yesterday evening I went to dinner at Strip House and had a very negative experience.  The meal was enjoyable enough, but when the bill arrived my eyes nearly jumped out of my head when I saw that it included a $395 bottle of wine that I did not order (the bottle I had ordered was only $80). I promptly pointed this out to the waiter and he corrected the charge from $395 to $80.  I was not completely satisfied, however, because it seemed unbelievable to me that a restaurant could make such a huge mistake without taking notice.  I spoke to the manager, Travis Camesi, and explained in the most calm and polite way possible that I had been shocked to see such an exorbitant charge to my bill, and that I felt like the restaurant had tried to take advantage of me. Camesi was visibly impatient and gruff.  He said that he ""did not know what I wanted him to do,"" and that ""they had fixed the problem"" by removing the errant charge. If I were at a casual dining establishment I would expect as much, but when I'm spending over $250 at a restaurant that advertises itself as ""fine dining,"" I expect to be treated better than this.  Camesi's tone was not appropriate, especially when I went out of my way to raise my concern as politely as I did.  Moreover, he could have offered a gift card, free desert, or other small gesture of goodwill, but instead decided to doggedly defend this as nothing more than a harmless ""mistake.""But it probably wasn't a mistake, and it certainly was not harmless.  Seeing this fraudulent $315 upcharge definitely was enough to to ruin my meal.  And while the restaurant could have done something to help mitigate this, they instead compounded the problem by refusing to even acknowledge that it was a big deal.       I have never written a bad restaurant review before, but I feel obligated in this instance, as a public service, to post this review to prevent hapless would-be patrons from being taken advantage of like I almost was. Although savvy restaurant-goers probably already know to avoid Strip House, the less well informed should beware.

5.0,5/19/2018,"The steak is usually excellent. A bit different from places like Peter Luger and Wolfgangs, a bit more traditional in how steaks used to be (though so many people are copying Luger that it may have become the standard for high-end steaks), but it's very good. The creamed spinach is amazing, the best I tried anywhere. Had their potatoes with cheese. Didn't think it would be good, it sounded like a childish combination to me, but it's very good too.On the down side, got the tomahawk (large ribeye on a big bone). Half of it was fat.  I complained, they didn't seem too happy, but they did bring me another steak to add to mine It was a cheaper cut, but it's still appreciated. They also free side.

2.0,5/9/2018,"Oh boy. Where to start?How about the drink at the bar? Tasty but you want to transfer the drink to your table? ""We prefer that you settle up here first."" Ok, but when you're charging $20 for a well Manhattan, figure out how to share the table tip with the bartender. How about the appetizers? Got the bacon. $21 for 2 pieces cut in half to make it look like 4. You're not fooling anyone.  Plus it was nearly inedible because it was so fatty. I get it, bacon is fatty. But huge chunks of this bacon were nothing but fat. Disappointing when compared to similar dishes at other steakhouses. How about the main course--the steak. We were 3 and tried to order a porterhouse for 3. Sorry, they said, all their steaks are precut. You can have a porterhouse for 2 and a steak for 1 and we'll slice it up so you can share it all. Ok, not what we wanted but worth a try, right?  Ordered it medium rare. All the steak came out so rare it was actually slimy. I won't go so far as to say it was cold, but it was vile. Not only was it on the rare side of rare, but it was fatty across the board. Even the filet part of the porterhouse. Fatty and grissly. Highly disappointing. I understand the recent trend to grossly undercook steak under the theory that it can always be cooked more but not less. But properly cooked steak is cooked correctly, rested, sliced, then served. Sending it back after all that to cook it the way you actually ordered it at that point is an exercise in futility. To summarize: here's what we ordered: 1 bacon app, 1 burrata app, 1 porterhouse for 2, one ribeye for 1, 2 sides, 4 mixed drinks, 1 bottle of wine, and 2 desserts. The cost: $630. What a ripoff! Best part was the hot brownie dessert.  I don't mind spending a small fortune for dinner. But only when it's the proper quality.

2.0,4/21/2018,"Strip House is the inaugural stop on my newly formed NYC steak club. I have been a few times since the restaurant first opened.The red bordello theme is still playful and sexy as I remembered, and the restaurant is busy as ever. The bartenders are impressive, chatting with some guests and not falling behind. I do not wait long for my martini.The front waiting area has leather stools and no crowd, so I sit with my drink until my party arrives. We are seated at the first table in the bar area, and I find this annoying. I made my reservation a month in advance, and clearly the restaurant recognizes that these front tables are inferior. The bar is loud and hectic. We feel we are on the edge looking in. The back half of the restaurant is the proper dining room, where you are away from the bustle, and the bordello decor has this warm enveloping effect. PRO TIP: Make sure to request a table in the back dining room. I get over it and we settle in for dinner and conversationThe Meal:Shrimp Cocktail:This is very good. Shrimp are large and sauce is spicy.6 Oysters:These are also very good.Bone In Ribeye:This is quite disappointing. The steak chews more like a NY Strip, which would be ok if it were not so bland. I rarely ask for a sauce at a high end steakhouse, but I am regretting my decision to go naked. The temperature is medium rare as requested.Lamb Chops:I have a bite of my girlfriend's lamb chops, and this dish is also quite bland and unimpressive. It is hard to distinguish that it is lamb, and the texture is more chewy than tender. The temperature is medium rare as requested.Goose Fat Potatoes:Good, Crunchy, Rich PotatoesTruffled Creamed Spinach:Very Good. Not too truffly.Chocolate Cake:This 17 layer chocolate cake is a signature of the restaurant, but the only impressive thing about it is the size of the slice. The cake is just ok.We drink some good wine by the glass, and service throughout is thorough and friendly, though none of the staff seems particularly excited to be here.So why only 2 stars? Mainly because the meat is not great, nothing stands out, and the prices are very high. Expensive restaurants should be special, and the only things special about this meal are my dining companions.

The first two were solid but the potatoes were a bit bland and underwhelming considering they had goose fat.I don't mind being a bit extravagant at times with my meals but the value is just not there.  I thought everything was too pricey for what you got and again I left the place hungry and ordered seamless when I got home.Service was also meh, our server had this arrogant and pompous attitude.  I don't remember the details since this was a few weeks ago but I know of all the NYC steakhouses I've been to, this one was memorable in that I remember the server being kind of a jerk.Would not return.",4,1,0,Johnson L.,"New York, NY",244,127,2

5.0,2/23/2018,"Easily my favorite high-end restaurant. The food is always delicious, and surprisingly reasonably priced for what it is. From my most recent visit:Dry-aged Ribeye (medium-rare): Easily the best steak I've ever had. Perfectly seasoned, exceptionally cooked, the meat was delicious and the fat on the edges was even tastier. I personally hate these Wagyu/Kobe beef gimmicks that are used to charge 3x more for meat that has no additional flavor. This steak was everything I wanted and more. Yeah, its $53, but you're probably gonna pay about as much, usually more at any good steakhouse. This steak blows Peter Luger's out of the water. Black Truffle Spinach: This is my favorite side here. It's as good as spinach can possibly get. The  truffle comes through but is not overpowering and is perfectly complimented by the cream and spinach. Goose Fat Potato: Delicious, crispy, salty and rich. While I very much like this side, I consider the Black Truffle Spinach to be better because the goose-fat potato seems to lose flavor as you get to the middle of it. It's still great but not quite as good as the spinach. Lobster Bisque: Very, very flavorful. In fact, the flavor was so intense that I had to drink water after every second spoonful just to cleanse my palate because I would otherwise become  too desensitized to the other flavors. I would prefer for the consistency of this bisque to be thicker however; I felt that it was too runny. Foie Gras: Incredibly smooth, buttery and delicate. I was joking with my friends that I could hardly tell if I was eating the liver of a goose or butter right out of the container. Bacon: This was my third favorite menu item of the visit, after the Ribeye and Black Truffle Spinach. The bacon came in these thick wedges which were juicy, incredibly flavorful and perfectly roasted. I had to remind myself multiple times to savor the piece instead of simply inhaling it. Burrata: Very tasty but this one didn't stand out too much from burrata anywhere else. Somewhat forgettable. 24-Layer Chocolate Cake: When the slice of cake comes to your table, it is larger than life. Delicious, moist and rich, I highly recommend this cake because its one of those desserts that both looks impressive and actually tastes good. In the age of instagram and viral marketing, a lot of desserts go for the wow-factor and then you have to dig through layers of ""decoration"" to get to the parts that you actually want to eat. This cake carries the WOW without the nonsense. Chocolate Brownie: This brownie was my favorite dessert of the night. Somehow the chefs at Strip House made it crispy on the outside but the inside had a texture almost like a dark chocolate butter. I was stuffed at this point, but once I got one taste of the brownie, I continued to eat with renewed vigor like the glutton I am. Lemon New York Cheesecake: A solid cheesecake but a somewhat weak contender compared to the other two desserts. You can get a similar cheesecake at any decent bakery - unimpressive. Decor: The interior here is one of my favorite of any restaurant. High-end but relaxing, private but well-lit, impressive but not loud or overwhelming. The lighting perfectly compliments the food and the table arrangement allows the staff to move around smoothly. Service: Our waiter was excellent, knowledgeable and concise. Not overly verbose, but was able to brilliantly explain the whiskey selection and the menu items. Bonus: Complimentary champagne to celebrate my graduate school completion. The wonderful staff here asked my friend if this visit was for a special occasion when the reservation had been made one week prior to the visit, and of course the staff remembered. These types of little things really give Strip House that additional boost to edge out its competitors as my favorite high-end restaurant in NYC.",1,0,0,I B.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,21,0

The side dishes (creamed-corn and creamed spinach) were outstanding.The reason I won't go back to this restaurant is that the temperature in the dining room was unbearably warm.

3.0,12/1/2017,"Thoroughly underwhelming experience. That's not a bad review, it's just for the price and the reputation, it was underwhelming. We shared the Gem Lettuce Salad which looked like zero effort was made in making it. Literally gem lettuce just cut in halves (or quarters) length ways with bacon, apple, and pecans sprinkled on top. It's more ordinary that I can make it sound but it wasn't necessarily bad tasting. I got the 20 Oz. New York Strip. Ordered medium-rare, came out closer to medium which was disappointing but it was very good. Very good. Finished off with the apple sundae (seasonal I think) which was just a huge mush in a jar but still pretty good. My issue was with the service. Serving the person on my left from my right because the waiter was too lazy to walk around, bumping into my chair, taking away my bread-and-butter plate multiple times (twice while I was actually buttering my bread), shoving my knife and fork with the plate to lay the plate in front of me, etc. I know it sounds picky and I obviously wasn't expecting silver-service but I was expecting something better at a restaurant where one of my dishes costs over $60 (and it's a steakhouse so that's with no sides, just the meat).  If I had a dollar for every time one of the many servers asked if I was done (when I wasn't), I probably could've paid for my meal with that.

I sat at the bar and got a meal. Have to say the steak tartare was...unfortunate, but overall everything else was decent. I really was very disappointed with that starter...but hey. Service at the bar was decent, the steak was okay, though far too heavily seasoned with black pepper. Was informed that's how they do it normally, though I wasn't informed. No biggie, just scrapped the black pepper off. Wine list was damn good, so was the overall drink selection. Very, very impressed with the awesome list.

3.0,8/18/2017,"Came here a few weeks ago and had an interesting experience. A few quick things. The décor was kind of old school - lots of wood and leather. The decision was a wall to wall play on its name making you wonder if this was originally located in Times Square. And red. Lots of red. As in red light district or Chinese New Year. The service was terrific - the waiter was attentive, informed, and engaging. The drinks were very good and you could tell (partly from these prices) that they weren't going to be your grandma's old fashioned. Except it kind of was, but with a very modern focus on craftsmanship. My self-designated whiskey expert friend claimed this was the best one he's ever had! My sangria (I know, why at a steak house?) was pretty delicious given some of their enhancements. Before we ordered, we were served a complimentary amuse-bouche of a cold pea soup shot. It was really good and so our hopes were high for the rest of our meal. We shared the PH for 2 with a side of goose fat fried potatoes (because any amount of research will tell you that this is required here). Steak for two is tough if you don't share the same doneness preference. Buddy likes medium rare where I'm a medium erred on the side of medium well (sorry, I also ordered sangria remember?) We split the difference and ordered medium. What we got was more medium rare I'd say. Plus, the steak was surprisingly gristly. The potatoes were good but I must be getting old since consuming all that fat was becoming challenging. We passed on dessert but they knew from the reservation it was my birthday so they brought out a plate with a candle on it. Strange but appreciated. Then came the bill. My buddy was studying it far longer than normal. Turns out there was a service charge on it, but not 15%. Strange since it was just the two of us. When we asked our waiter, he brought the manager out. She basically explained that a) the restaurant is party of the Landry group and b) since back of the house kitchen workers didn't share the tips, this was a way to pay them more without raising food prices. Evidently corporate had just rolled this out and the manager herself had recently learned about this tactic. Given that it wasn't mentioned anywhere or by anyone, she understood our issue with it and was apologetic and happy to adjust our bill accordingly. This is a bad idea and rolled out wrong (travel ban, anyone?) My friend would come back just for the drinks. I think I'm pretty much done.",1,1,0,Dan K.,"Albertson, NY",7,136,403

I would say this location has a similar ambiance setup to the midtown location but is a little more casual in terms of attire. The steak was delicious as usual.

Really!!!! The entire restaurant was empty but they sat someone there anyway. The wonderful manager was equally amazed and did everything he could do to apologize. Well, the saga continues...the same genius hostess recently assured us that we can ask for our favorite table, but no guarantees. After all, someone else might ask for it. Really!!!!

4.0,6/17/2017,"We came for a celebratory occasion, and this was definitely the perfect place for it. It's an intimate space that is very romantic, with dim lighting and red patterned walls throughout. Their service was extremely friendly and hospitable, and without pretensions. I enjoyed the Strip House and only anticipate a future return, especially to try the other cuts that they offer.I chose the 14 oz. Dry Aged Rib Eye based on a friend's recommendation while my bf had the 20 oz. Bone-in Rib Eye. For starters and sides, we had the goose fat potatoes, roasted brussel sprouts, and the roasted bacon. The brussel sprouts were my favorite among the sides. They were super flavorful and lightly crisp on the outside. The goose fat potatoes and bacon were also great, but I admit it felt heavy next to the steak. I honestly would have preferred mashed over fried potatoes, but the goose fat potatoes are notable and certainly worth the try here. Trying a little bit of the bone-in, I very much prefer the dry aged over it. The texture and flavors were quite different between the two, but both were excellent steaks in their own right. Their rib eye has this wonderful charring on the side, smokey and flavorful, adding lovely texture and taste to each bite. The dry aged also has wonderful charring, but I felt it was a tad juicier. Both are very meaty steaks so prepare yourselves. Do yourself one last favor and save room for dessert! We did manage to make some room and try their most famous layered Chocolate Cake. It's huge, a towering 20+ layer cake that is dense and rich with chocolate but without being overly sweet. We couldn't resist trying, and I am glad we didn't. This is an amazing dessert, an extremely memorable and wonderful way to end the meal. Compared to other steakhouses I have been, which aren't too many, Striphouse is perfect for those who want a bit of added romance. I would love to go back and try other cuts, particularly the strip steak. The dry-aged rib eye was great, and if I had perhaps one less side, I would have been able to finish it all in a sitting considering how tasty it was. I am definitely looking forward to more of that chocolate cake. Definitely book your reservation at Striphouse if you have not been.

4.0,6/15/2017,"I haven't been back here since 2013 and wanted to give it another try. The steak continues to be great and cooked to order, however, the black truffle creamed spinach appeared to have too much truffle this time around. It was bordering on overpowering. I could only eat a few bites. I would normally start with the bacon but opted for the jumbo lump crab cake for the first time. It was filled with mostly pure crab meat. I didn't care for the romesco sauce. I found it to be somewhat bland and it didn't add anything to the dish.For main course, I had the 20 oz. Bone-in Ribeye and it was fantastic. It had a great char which I didn't recall from previous visits. It was almost peppercorn like, but it wasn't and the goose fat potatoes were tasty.

Both the 20 oz bone in rib eye and 14 oz dry-aged rib eye were terrific and had so much flavor and seasoning, the meat was remarkably juicy.

5.0,5/11/2017,"Good lord!  Let's be honest if you are an upscale steak house it's pretty difficult to screw up a steak.  So to me the best way to differentiate steak house to steak house is the sides and service.  Let's start with our waitress, Lauren.  She was attentive but not hovering.  Love that.  And she directed to an exceptional bottle of wine and an amazing dessert wine as well.  We started with the Italian Bufala Burrata with Speck, Saffron-Poached Quince, Chianti Vincotto, Focaccia and also the Diver Scallops with Salsify, Hen of the Woods Mushroom, Arugula, Blood Orange Gastrique.  Of course you can't go wrong with Burrata and the Scallops with all the accompaniment was perfection in every bite.  Our sides were Crisp Goose Fat Potatoes, Black Truffle Creamed Spinach, Fire-Roasted Asparagus with Brown Butter-Soy Emulsion and Charred Broccoli with Toasted Almond, Miso Butter.  Good Lord!  Once again!  Perfection!  I could come back to the Strip House and eat just the sides.  And this is coming from a huge meat lover.  And of course from what we read you really can't come to the Strip House and not finish with the 24-Layer Chocolate Cake.  It could feed a small village and it was a perfect way to end the night.  Oh and it was delicious the next morning with my coffee.  :-)Thank you Strip House for bringing it!",1,0,0,Dave R.,"Sunnyside, NY",7,24,36

3.0,4/22/2017,"I've been to quite a few steakhouses around NYC, but this was definitely one of the more meh/average experiences I've had. We tried the following:-Jumbo crab cake: This was delicious and easily shareable between two people. I wasn't a big fan of the purple potatoes it came with though, it had absolutely no flavor.-NY Strip (16 oz): Not bad, but not the best I've ever had. Was a bit too charred at the ends to the point where it tasted bitter, and mine was cooked a bit more than I would've liked (I asked for medium rare). I wish it had some extra fatty bits to elevate the flavor, because I got pretty bored eating it after a while. Also really liked the roasted garlic it came with as a garnish!-Black Truffle Creamed Spinach: My absolute favorite dish! Yelpers didn't disappoint with this recommendation, because this was really, really good. You could definitely taste the hint of truffle, and the spinach was so perfectly creamy.-Mac and Cheese: Easily the biggest regret because it was pretty comparable to Kraft Mac and Cheese. It was bland, and had a stale aftertaste...I suspect they used stale breadcrumbs or something, because it just didn't taste right.The restaurant itself emits an old-school, but very romantic/sexy vibe. Service, however, was painstakingly average. Unlike most steakhouses, our server was more concerned about getting our orders in rather than making any small talk or even emitting any emotion in his tone. Also, I have noticed that exceptional service entails the server picking up on signals of a special occasion, but our server did not ask about the bouquet of roses on the table (it was an anni dinner with my boyfriend). He was a dutiful server (which is still nice!), but not much of an intuitive one.Bill for 2 came out to about 200 bucks - this included 2 drinks, 1 app, 2 entrees, and 2 sides.

I was seated promptly and wait staff came quickly.I ordered our beverages and they were served promptly. We ordered our meal(porterhouse steak for 2) and we only sent the steak to be cooked a little further. Medium well. It was delicious not tough at all and the steak sauce was a nice touch but not necessary. We ordered the creamed spinach and the asparagus to go along with the steak.  Delicious!

I think the seasoning was a bit overdone and would order without it next time.For side dishes I shared the broccoli and asparagus. these were both cooked just right but a bit too much sauce/butter for my liking.  When you serve top quality steak and vegetables, no need to mask the flavor.

The cake was a volcano of chocolate goodness! We shares a slice between 4 people and still took 1/3 rd of the piece home. The size is enormous, and it is amazing how they make this cake.

5.0,2/24/2017,"So this was quite possibly the best steak experience I've ever had. Strip House serves up an excellent NY striploin--perfectly charred on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside. Tried medium and medium rare, both cooked to perfection. The steak was spiced so well that you didn't need any steak sauce at all; the meat itself was just so flavourful. No raw, gamey taste either. The cuts are expensive--$50 for the 14oz NY dry strip--but worth absolutely every penny. Even the sides were delicious...brown buttered asparagus and the Strip House mashed potatoes were two favourites. Service was great, both the host and waitress were very welcoming. The restaurant had a retro-style vibe to it--very ""authentic"" New York and very cool dining atmosphere.Portions were quite large so among three people we split two 14oz steaks and 3 sides to share. Our waiter was very kind as to make this arrangement after we insisted on the smaller NY strips vs sharing the $120 cut for two. The steaks took ~25 min so she suggested we share an appetizer, which we did. A dozen raw oysters--decent, but at $40 these were quite expensive...the only dish I'd say was not really worth it.Still, after the steaks we were so full afterwards that we had to resist ordering their famous 24-layer chocolate cake that we saw other tables ordering!

It goes perfectly with the steak.  We also got the french fries, which were delicious, crispy and garlicky, but had no room in my stomach left to eat them.  I would definitely return here, but it would have to be for a special occasion.  Dinner for two ran us $250.",0,0,0,Scarlett O.,"New York, NY",1,24,12

2.0,2/18/2017,"I have to be a voice of reason in all these overrated reviews from people blinded by birthday or anniversary or holiday dates.  This place is extremely expensive for extremely mediocre food and service.Not sure I'll ever understand the appeal of a criminally overrated place like this/ any ""steakhouse."" If you're there for steak, prepare to pay many times more than the food is actually worth - especially for side dishes. $13 for 1.5 potatoes mashed. $14 for about 7 brussels sprouts. Our table was pitched a 60oz steak which our server suggested was enough for 2 or maybe 3 people! (Which he stated not only with a straight face but with a snobby blasé.) So - minus the bone - that's about 44oz for 2 or 3 people??? An adequate serving of red meat is 3-5oz. I guess if you order that steak @ $180 for 9 people - this restaurant might be a deal.If you're  there with people who are there for steak, prepare for mediocre salmon (or other pedestrian dishes) priced as high as Michelin starred versions just blocks away. And plan to be surrounded by bachelor and bachelorette parties and shouting/ cackling so loud you won't be able to hear your dining partners. Basically - this is the epitome of American excess without care for where the food came from.

It is each time I have gone. I LOVE their martinis. Our waitress Rachel was really cool and helpful. However.... this place tolerates sexual predators talking about their brutal exploits so loud, that everyone around them was cringing. Including me. When he bragged about physically and sexually accosting a woman in the street and having her be really upset, I told our waitress Rachel, and asked to move to another table. We moved and it was a lot better. That was until 2 hours later and that table's 6th round of drinks. He started talking about forcing his way into a bathroom and ""finger banging a chick while she was puking over the toilet"" and his friends were laughing, but in the end they had to shush him because he was so loud. A woman sitting next to them kept putting her head in her hands and asking her husband if they could leave. Then he talked about having his friend watch him fuck another drunk girl at some other point. Thats when I asked to see the manager. I told the manager, Amy, all of this and she said she couldn't do anything. That she wished she had known sooner. She would have moved me for ""my convince."" Sorry but no, Striphouse. She asked me what she could do and I told her she could go over there and tell them that their establishment doesn't condone sexual predators bragging about their exploits. But alas it seems they do condone that behavior. The normalization by the staff and management (Steve and Amy as managers) is part of the reason why this kind of behavior occurs in the first place. Not just the actions, but the bragging about it in public over the course of 3 hours.I own a client-based business. There would be absolutely no way I would allow this to occur, because I stand for something, beyond making a buck.In the end I went over to the table myself, because I have too much respect for my fortitude as a woman and I have integrity to call this kind of thing out when I hear it. Striphouse, I am sad to say you have lost me as a customer, and you have lost my recommendation. I vote with my wallet.

Unless you enjoy spending $300 plus for a bottle of wine, I would stick to cocktails. I work in a high end restaurant as well and these bottles blew ones i am used to seeing away, excellent selection, unfortunately just not in my price range. I'm not sure if there is a corkage fee, I would believe there is though. For apps: we had clams casino, tuna tartare- spicy, the Brussel sprout and kale salad which I normally would never go for was great, and the bacon steaks were very good as well.  On the chefs compliments we were sent out a parsnip? Soup. It was sweet and creamy and the perfect amount to try. Dinner: tomahawk for 3, delicious steak we had leftovers!! Highly recommend Others at the table shared a 20 oz bone in ribeye which they said was great And a bone in NY strip and 12oz filet I'm more of a medium steak person, everyone else was medium rare so since we were sharing we compromised at the MR, they seem to cook up more than expected I would say MR is more medium (fine with me disappointing to others)Sides: black truffle creamed spinach- after reading reviews we had to get it and it was AMAZING!!! I would go there just for this side. Potatoes Au gratin were delicious as well!!Creamed corn with pancetta was to die for!Broccoli was good we also tried the duck fat potatoes, I was excited to try these but I personally wasn't blown away, not much flavor too it, tasted like fried mashed potatoes Mac and cheese- personally wasn't a fan, seemed like store bought mac and cheese did not exceed our expectations. Their house made fries were DELICIOUS I had to stop myself from picking on them when I was already so full!Dessert: 24 layer chocolate cake was great but HUGE!! We could not finish it.

4.0,1/7/2017,"My husband loves steak and so we ventured here for his birthday midweek. Definitely make a reservation to ensure you have a table. It was empty when we arrived on a Wednesday at 7:30pm, but it livened up after about an hour. The decor is a little sexy and interesting. Lots of red and photos everywhere. I liked it and think it works well for what they're going for here. It's the kind of place you can take a date, have a boisterous birthday dinner or take a client for a nice meal. It has a bit of everything and plenty of food options to choose from -- all on the expensive side, mind you. They have a wide selection wine, we opted for one of their cheapest bottles of red ($75, yikes). We're not crazy wine drinkers but didn't feel like paying $9 for a shitty beer. For food, we went for the 14 ounce dry aged strip steak ($48) and the 20 ounce bone in rib eye ($58). We figured it was a good opportunity to see the difference between dry aged and bone in. Expect to pay around $60 per person for any meat you get here. Typical of a quality steak house in NYC. Don't get the sauces on the side people. Seriously... you're going to spend this much on a piece of meat - you need to taste it. Not smoother it in something that covers the flavor. If you don't like the taste of steak, then don't order it! And don't bother with their house sauce. It's gross - like sweet ketchup. For sides we ordered the crisp goose fat potatoes, which is like a little fried pile of home fries. It was tasty but I wouldn't bother getting it again. However, the black truffle creamed spinach is one of the best things I've ever eaten, ever. OMG keep the steak, just give me a vat of creamed spinach. My husband and I could not stop talking about it. Even as left overs - bliss! As for the steaks, they were both delicious and perfectly cooked (medium rare, don't you dare ask for it cooked more!) The dry aged was more tender, soft like butta. But the bone-in was really tasty. Super juicy with a bit of a chew. My husband preferred the dry aged but I'd be find with either. The leftovers warmed up well too. As an FYI. For dessert, we went with their famous strip house chocolate cake that has 24 layers. Our server, who was amazing by the way - she was incredible the entire night and the perfect amount of funny, sassy and attentive - even put a candle for my husband. The slice of cake was enormous!! We still have left overs days later. Honestly, the cake was fun to get but not that tasty. I'm pretty sure this thing could feed a table of 8. Overall, dinner was great. We had a really nice time and ate until we could eat no more. We had tons of leftovers and enjoyed them the next day. You will drop bank here though. For the two of us, I spent $300 (nice tip included). This is one of those special occasion places.

5.0,12/25/2016,"Went last night with 2 friends for Christmas Eve Dinner. This is now my favorite steakhouse in the city. The vibe of the room is classy and comfortable at the same time. The breadbasket included pretzel bread and onion bread. Both were very good. But be careful not to fill up. For appetizers we had the bacon(excellent),shrimp cocktail (basic),the scallops(good but as with most scallop dishes,small). We all picked different steaks my friend had the filet mignon(literally melts in your mouth),my other friend had the strip( excellent crust) and I had the bone in rib-eye ( great flavoring and just the right amount of fat). For our sides we had the special warm brussel sprout salad(delicious and a nice alternative to the brussel sprouts on the menu) and the strip house potatoes (on the mark warm and gooey). They bring a complimentary steak sauce which none of us tried as it was not needed. Make sure you make room for the chocolate cake. It is really the best I have ever had. Only need one per table as it is huge. My friends ordered their wines by the glass as the bottles are pricey. This was a perfect night out.

5.0,12/10/2016,I went to Strip House yesterday after a lot of review reading and can say that the food was just as others have said ... AMAZING. I'll start from the top however:1) The ambience of Strip House is exactly what the description says. It was a 'sultry' and chic aura with a Gatsby feel. We were seated right away which was great for a Friday evening. I recommend reservations because the place filled up so quick once we got there. 2) For a starter we got the crab cake which was great. The potato salad and asparagus complimented the cake very well. For entrees Ingot the Filet and my friend got the Rib-eye. Prices were very reasonable for a steakhouse ranging about $50 each. My Filet was fantastic and that is an understatement; the seasoning and cook was perfect. The truffled creamed spinach is the best side creamed spinach I've had to date and the Strip House potatoes were good but the spinach definitely was better. I can go on and on about the food but I'll stop there.3) The service was quick and good. My only complaint is the position of our table. People kept trying to pass in between our table and the next and this would result is our table shaking each time which was definitely annoying.But other than that I'd say definitely go to Strip House - it's on several 'best steakhouse in NYC' lists as well!,1,0,0,Isha B.,"Jersey City, NJ",2,5,0

4.0,11/14/2016,"What a great place to bring a date!  I was lucky enough to be invited by my long-time girlfriend for a little pre-birthday celebration.  Strip House has a fantastic vibe, with dark accents that resemble what I imagine a smoke-filled backroom speakeasy may have looked like back when alcohol was illegal, but you could still smoke cigarettes.  I ordered the dry-aged Ribeye, while the lady ordered the 8oz Fillet.  Both were delicious.  We also ordered the crab cake for an appetizer.  I recommend for the sides, the mac and cheese and whipped potatoes.  There were more adventurous options for the sides as well as a raw bar that looked delicious based on what I saw glimpsing at others tables.This place breaks the predictable mold of many NY steakhouses (ala Del Friscoe's) but retains many of the things New Yorkers love best about these restaurants.  Great food, strong creative cocktails and reasonably priced single-malt scotch are just a few of the things that a good steakhouse should nail down.  The unique atmosphere of the Strip House, however, gives you something a little extra for an intimate dinner or sharing a meal with friends (you'll definitely want to make reservations).The staff were friendly, and we sat within minutes of arriving after we told them we had a reservation scheduled for 8pm.  The wait staff were helpful in recommendations and determining how much we should order.  Lastly, there was great coordination between bar/waiters/bus boys so that bread came out on time, cocktails were refilled prior to arrival of the main course, and we had enough time to digest before being offered desert.  Speaking of, you'll definitely want to order the chocolate cake.",0,0,0,Rich W.,"Jersey City, NJ",4,27,0

Raw hand cut filet mignon with spicy maine lobster. We quickly moved on to the main course. We ordered double cut aged rib chop for 2 ($55/PP) with side of black truffle cream spinach ($13) and mac n cheese ($13). The aged rib steak had came in a pan with less than 10 pieces for two. We thought that it was a bit of a small portion even though it was thick cut. The outer layer of the steak was a bit too charred to the point where it was burnt and little bitter. The steak was just seasoned with salt and pepper to give you full flavor of steak. The black truffle cream spinach was the best I ever had, with the perfect amount of black truffle in it. The mac n cheese was great with nothing bad to say about it. Overall, the quality of steak is very good. This place is not bad at all, but would I go back?

Would have requested the fresh pepper if it was needed.  I'm far from shy. Strip house potatoes side was excellent. Broccoli with almonds perfect. The porterhouse steak was served at the perfect temperature and it had an amazing crust that helped categorize this beef as well above expectations. Wine list was superb. Service could not have been better and ant more attentive without being overbearing.  So you say ""then what irritated you and influenced you to remove one full star?""Here it is folks. When I sat down I ordered Chopin Vodka on the rocks with blue cheese stuffed olives. When the check arrived I was not upset that the Chopin was $16 a glass. What did disappoint me was that I was charged  $3.00 for the added blue cheese olives. I view that as petty considering the total meal was over $350 without tip.  Again...

3.0,7/9/2016,"Alright so let's talk.... Went here with 4 friends, none of us major steakhouse players but we did okay. Menu is good. Not too big, not too small. Some daily specials. Steakhouses apparently make the least amount of money on the actual steaks, and most on the smaller plates and drinks etc. I'm beginning to think that I should just order rare for now on bc medium well wasn't as juicy as I'd like it to be. I got the dry-aged rib eye, and I actually liked my friend's filet mignon better. I wonder if I'm being stupid and dry-aged would be dry, but I'm thinking probably not.....The 24 layer chocolate cake was huge BUT I would never get it again. It tasted like 24 layers of Entenmanns. I'm sorry to say but I'm serious. Unless we got a bad slice, it feels like anyone who gloats over this would just be someone who doesn't actually care how it tastes and just makes a decision based instagram likes. And besides, it's $16. It better be a huge ass cake, I'm surprised it's not the whole thing. I would definitely get the baked Alaska next time.Also, I would do more research with the pictures on yelp and get things that I am absolutely sure of. For instance, I got the daily special of the local farm tomato salad --- it was just way too expensive for such a simple portion of food. Bacon, a few pieces of charred pork belly. It's fine, but whatever, charred pork belly. Mashed potatoes, creamy and cheesy yeah it's good. Now, I'm not saying the food is bad in any way, but I am saying that you should be thoroughly researched when ordering. The beer selection is surprisingly not that good. There are only 2 beers that are not owned by huge ass companies. You'd think they'd put a little care into that based on the seemingly great wine selection (and I don't even know, I am only judging by the length and prices).The place is fun and the waiters were nice enough, though it seems that only your own can actually help you. This review is only of one experience, so I would definitely consider giving it another chance, especially on someone else's dime.If I were to go again, I'd like to try:Creamed spinachMac and cheeseBaked Alaskaand possibly one of the non-steak entrees (yeah I'm that wild)",1,1,1,Jeff O.,"Jackson Heights, NY",488,1403,217

Ordered the NY strip and it was amazing! Absolutely loved it and the roasted garlic. The homemade steak sauce was okay. I had the whipped potato purée which was pretty good but a little on the salty side. For dessert I had the strip house chocolate cake. It was massive. Definitely enough to share with other people in your party. I would rate this restaurant higher if I did not have to wait so long despite making a reservation.

We'd been to a couple of those so we were in!  We had an 8:15 reservation on a Friday night, and were seated 10 minutes after our arrival.  I have a thing for red walls.. The atmosphere was sexy, and just perfect for a hip steak house.  The space is long, not as big as I expected but they did have a downstairs which we didn't go see.  The red and photo-covered walls provide a great intimacy to the space.  The wine menu is extremely expensive.. we knew some of the selections and they were 3x the standard price (we're used to it being 2x at a restaurant).  We opted for cocktails and then glasses of wine with our steaks.  I had the seasonal Cosmo, and my hubby had a couple of Old Fashioneds.  Then we switched to a delicious Pinot Noir with our steaks. The service was fantastic, and our waitress was amazing.  I didn't get her name, but she seemed to be Eastern European.  She was very friendly, and gave great recommendations on what to order and even recommended a rooftop spot to go after dinner, which we really enjoyed.  Skip the pretzel bread (not worth the carbs or stomach space), but the onion rolls were good. To start, we had the lobster bisque with couscous.. unique twist, but really delicious.  The texture of the couscous somehow made up for the lack of lobster chunks.. I know you think I lie, but it really did... I could go for another bowl of it right now!  I think I'm going to have to try replicating this at home.  Next up, I had the filet.. the large filet was only $4 more than the ""small one"", so I went with it but I couldn't finish it... at least my husband had some.  I ordered Rare+ and it was delicious.. It has a nice blackened crust, so it had nice texture on the outside and the perfect melt-in-your-mouth rawness at the middle.  Mmmmmffff... My husband had the bone-in ribeye, which was delicious as well.  More textured, but a perfect amount of fattiness.  They gave a side of sauce, which we didn't order, and aren't sure what it was.. I thought maybe their steak sauce, complimentary?  Neither of us cared for it though.  We feel the steak should speak for itself, and it did.  That said though I loooove garlic, and fully appreciated the roasted half-head of garlic that was provided with my filet.  As a side, we ordered the creamed corn, which was spicier than anticipated, but every bit as sinful and delicious as expected.  Order it!  Dessert?  We couldn't... we were soo full on all the other goodness.  We'll be recommending it to others, and we'll be back ourselves.",3,0,1,Candace T.,"Miami, FL",108,246,813

The $16 tag on the slice is reasonably justified because it is a huge slice. Good for 2-3 people! But this is no way a great piece of chocolate cake.

This is the steak that will ruin all other steaks. As for sides, I attest the black truffle creamed spinach is amazing. And for dessert, if you have room, the warm double chocolate brownie with vanilla is my choice over the cake which sometimes can be dry. I'm not a huge brownie fan, but this darling is perfectly warm and gooey on the inside and not overly sweet. Aside from the food, the ambiance just screams old school steak house. From the dim lighting, red walls and old black and white photographs, you can picture Don Draper and Roger Stirling knocking a few back here over bone-in rib eyes.",3,2,3,Rae R.,"New York, NY",56,40,6

3.0,4/24/2016,"Food is good as well as presentation.  Serving staff was attentive.  I would not choose this restaurant for a romantic fine dining experience.  The tables are WAY TOO CLOSE.  They pack in the sides of the restaurant that share common bench seating. The tables are so close that they need to pull the tables out in order for the person sitting on the bench to get in.  Whether you want to listen to the conversations on the side of you or not, you have no choice.  You can't hold a private conversation because the people on either side could hear you even if you whispered.  I have sat further apart at a round table at wedding than the proximity at the restaurant.

1.0,4/3/2016,"I'm writing this review from inside the restaurant right now. I work for a delivery company and I'm picking up food for a customer where I had to place the order myself. I go to try and place the order and the bartender holds his hand out, asks for my phone and I told him, ""Can't I just read it to you?"" And he said ""No. It's better if I can just put it in."" I told him I'd rather read it. I didn't explain why but the reason is because my phone has been dropped before by employees of restaurants in the past. All they say is ""sorry."" If my phone drops and cracks who is going to pay for it? Not them. Not my company. Me. So I would rather avoid all that and read the order myself and if I need help I'll show you. Then he said, I swear to GOD, ""well whatever you can read it *turns around to order system* I don't give a shit."" I'm working on myself so I ignored my first reaction to get angry and instead just asked him, ""Why do you have to curse?"" And he said with his back to me, ""I'm sorry."" Then asked what I needed. I've never eaten here but when I came in, I overheard 2 customers coming out say, ""that was a really good steak tho!"" I was in awe by how beautiful the restaurant is, it's vintage and moody. It's good quality food I'm sure but this kind of service is unacceptable, even if I'm ""just"" a delivery girl. I understand I'm not a direct customer right now but could be a customer in the future. Hopefully no one else has had to endure this kind of treatment. The bartender in question is Caucasian, tall, black hair and working right now at 8:45pm on 4/3/16. I want to the owners to know who it is and to let him know his behavior is not okay. Already having a somber day and I get cursed at for no reason at all.

Service was great, the filet mignon was wonderfully seasoned (although not as tender as I expected) and the potato purée side dish was delicious. I ordered the chocolate cake for dessert and it wasn't as moist and good as I expected based on other reviews (and the food channel). The 7-layer chocolate cake at Costco beats the Striphouse chocolate cake, so I was disappointed.  The chocolate cake was the main reason I was attracted to this restaurant.

4.0,3/27/2016,"I've been to both this location and the midtown one a few times. I was here for my birthday last month and last night I was here for a friend's birthday. It's kinda becoming a regular spot for us. I usually get the porterhouse, which is great. I've had the ribeye-- also very good. I also once had a bone in rib-eye, which was a special, and I wasn't impressed. Last night I tasted my friend's bone-in New York strip, and it wasn't very good. He was pretty disappointed by it. He's a big fan of Wolfgang's, but he did say he liked the sides better here. I agree-- the sides are great. We had the goose fat potatoes, creamed spinach and brussel sprouts. My favorite dessert is the brownie with ice cream. Last night, however, it wasn't as good. The top part was almost kinda stale, though the rest of it was moist and delicious. They are known for their chocolate cake, which I think is pretty overrated. It's just a giant slice of extremely chocolatey cake that gets to be a bit much. Too monotonous in my opinion. Also not that good, especially for the money, is their $21 old-fashioned. A major problem with it is the ice they use makes it diluted. For $21 I think they should at least give you the giant ice globe or whatever it's called. A great place as long as you know what to get. My tips would be to get something dry-aged (makes a world of a difference), get the brownie, avoid the chocolate cake and avoid the old fashioned.",0,0,0,Eugene H.,"Norwood, NJ",80,7,0

5.0,2/6/2016,"4.5 star experience! Half a star knocked off due to the hostesses being a bit standoffish, but with a place this packed I get that their job is tough. This place was really crowded on a cold February Friday night! I almost felt a bit like I was in a club near the bar area, but there also was a really fun energy. Also of note, I've never seen so many 20-35 year olds in a steak house ever. Anyway, on to the ambience. Very upscale bistro-like decor. I loved the deep red walls, chairs and darker lighting. Cornily, this place would be an awesome pick for Valentine's Day! Our food was great! We only ordered two sides, the duck fat potato and the truffle creamed spinach. The creamed spinach was EVERYTHING and I had to try to stop myself from eating the whole pot full! The duck fat potato was a bit of a let down, I didn't see what was so special and maybe would opt for the mac and cheese next time. The steak, awesome! Beautiful char on the outside and lovely pink medium inside. My first steak was a bit cool, and the waitress graciously brought me a brand new hot steak! I had only asked for a warm up, but I appreciate this type of hospitality when spending this much. I had the Malbec with my steak, and it was a nice pairing that I made (pats back). Another note on price, they had some outlandishly priced special wines at upward of 24 bucks for 3 oz, whoa! Certainly I will never try those, but I'm sure for the right guest this is desirable. We were too full to try dessert, but the famous chocolate cake looked divine and I will certainly try it on a return visit!

The Union Square location delivers excellence reliably and across the board, from the steaks to the sides to the drinks to the service. The steaks are perfectly charred in their broiler, always cooked perfectly to order, and attractively plated with roasted garlic and rosemary. The bone-in cuts are the stars - the strip, ribeye, and filet are all great, but the NY Strip is (perhaps fittingly) the best here. Sides-wise, don't miss the goose fat potatoes, which are the stand-out/signature. Fries are a big hit too, well-portioned and topped with garlic and herbs. Green beans recommended too.

Service from the hostesses and waiters was superb. My friend and I started out with the roasted bacon. To be honest I didn't see the hype behind it, most of the edges on mine were burnt and hard and I had to leave it off. The side arugula and tomatoes that came with it was good though. I probably would not recommend it. It wasn't juicy like that what others have said. We ordered the dry-aged porter house for two in medium rare for our main entree and the black truffle creamed spinach. The porter house came with a side sauce that I think can definitely be left off. The meat itself was so delicious. Juicy, but still has a bit of that chargrilled on the outer part. Also, the best part is the meat near the bones cause of all the flavors! Mmmm.

Wow I am really beginning to think you can service certain people shi* on a plate and they will eat it.

I called 2 days ahead and they almost ran out of dinner reservations, luckily we were able to get one at 6:15pm. We arrived about 20 minutes early but they seated us immediately.I loved the variety of meats and seafood that they offer on their menu. I had a glass of their Malbec, which was absolutely delicious and my boyfriend had their Stout and Ale which he enjoyed also. Our meal, overall, was amazing:+Complimentary bread & butter: There were two different kinds in our basket, the regular sourdough-type and pretzel. Great start.+Littleneck clams: I started off with half a dozen of their clams from the raw bar and they were the best I've ever had. So fresh and the cocktail sauce/vinegar were the perfect accompaniment.+Filet mignon: My boyfriend had the 12oz and I had the 8oz. 8oz was perfect for me. We both had it cooked medium rare and they were done perfectly, I loved the char on the outside of the steak, it gave it a little crunch. The roasted garlic on each of our plates was a great touch, I almost ate every clove. +Whipped potato puree: We shared a side of this and they are basically they mashed potatoes, just extra creamy. Super delicious, enough to share between two people. +Double chocolate brownie: By the end, we were so full but decided to try the brownie with vanilla ice cream. The brownie was super sweet but the ice cream cut through it pretty well. My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed our experience at this restaurant. The service was great and the atmosphere is just super romantic.",11,6,7,Lina P.,"Orange County, CA",345,220,472

4.0,10/24/2015,"My husband and I visited last night to celebrate his birthday. Food was excellent 5/5, service was slow... 3/5 at best. Timeline of evening - 8:15 Arrive for our 8:15 reservation 8:50 Get seated at our table 9:15 Server took our order 9:50 Our food (main courses) arrived 10:50 Dessert arrived 11:25 Left restaurant The restaurant was full so I think our server was stretched with so many tables. Once we were seated we ordered drinks which they forgot to bring us! We were given complimentary bread which was really good. We decided to give appetizers a miss as we'd ate so much bread before we ordered and we had our eye on the 24 layer chocolate cake for dessert! I ordered the 12oz filet, cooked medium and my husband ordered a bone in rib eye, cooked rare. For side dishes we chose garlic fries and green beans. I was really happy with the food, my steak was delicious, one of the best steaks I've eaten. The sides were also really good, I was a bit apprehensive about the green beans but they were lovely, but maybe a bit over seasoned and salty. The fries were a great portion size and could easily be split between 3 people. My husband found his steak too fatty, even for a rib eye and felt it was unmemorable. He also found the food a bit salty. Throughout the meal our server was a bit scarce, although our water was constantly kept topped up by other staff. I had to ask our server 3 times for the drinks menu before it materialized. When I had booked our table I mentioned it was a special occasion and they said they could put a candle in my husbands dessert, so I was very pleased to see that they remembered. We ordered the 24 layer chocolate cake. It is HUGE and could literally feed 6 people easily! We cut off a slice each and boxed the rest to go. It was really nice, a small slice from the large piece was just right. Overall, it was a really nice meal but it just felt like we were there forever. 3 hours for a main course and dessert seems excessive (even taking account of ordering my steak be cooked medium) and it felt like there was a lot of waiting around. However the steak was excellent and I would recommend it, just be prepared for a wait.

It's steakhouse pricey so definitely not an everyday kind of expenditure. But this place practically begs for your special occasion.And the cut that screams the loudest is probably the bone-in rib-eye. Now that's my favorite cut anyway and I'm fairly convinced it's the most flavorful of all the classic cuts in any chop house.

1.0,8/5/2015,"Really pissed off at this place today. Bring my out of town family to this place because I used to come here a lot on my own and enjoyed it. Such terrible service today. Start off with ordering and my sister in law forgot her id. She looks young but shes 24. We are very obviously a related family of 5 (not 30 ppl deep). Waitress makes a big deal about id. Manager comes over and explains how we need id for everyone. I am from new york and I don't need the fresh off the boat explanation from a condescending manager about how id's are necessary in the US. We aren't ordering a bottle of wine to get wasted. Ok fine but I am sure every other table with young-ish looking guests didn't get carded. But I won't play the race cars. Plenty else to rag on. So next the waiters take away all bread plates except one from our table after we order. Wtf? So I have to bug the waiter for bread plates. They bring the plates and leave out 2 butter knives. Really? The whole point of an upscale steakhouse is that everything be impeccable (including service and table setting). Already ruined the tone of the meal. Now for the actual food.As for the steak, medium rare tomahawk for 2 was done more medium. Also, they say dry aged but could not really taste the age. Wife ordered the on menu dry aged ribeye and really could not taste the age at all. Unfortunate story of a formerly good restaurant gone bad. I will be taking me and my brokers' business to wolfgangs instead of this overpriced dump. They struck out when it was most important to me.

We also loved the cream spinach and corn sides.  For dessert we had the banana tart, a little too caramelized for liking.  All in all great dinner. Why 3 out of 5 stars? Well the service was missing something. Perhaps the staff just found out that their beloved house cat died because everyone appeared to be going through the motions.

3.0,6/28/2015,"Ok I will start by saying that I'm not a huge steak fan, so perhaps I don't have the experience to know quality steak. I came here for a friend's birthday and ordered the 14 oz dry age steak, medium. It came out and was quite a hefty piece of meat, but was a little too chewy for my taste (I like no chewiness which is probably not even possible). The steak itself was lightly seasoned though I mostly just doused it in the Striphouse sauce and mixed it with the sides we ordered. The meat was quite juicy though. The steak itself comes with nothing so you should definitely order sides. My friends ordered the filet and liked it though they ordered it medium rare and it looked more rare to me.We got the cream of corn, creamed spinach and goose fat potatoes. The corn was so good! I love corn, but I especially loved their corn. It was so delicious with the bread crumbs and the pancetta. The creamed spinach was also quite good. The goose fat potatoes we could have done without. It came out in a dome shape and was so hard you basically need a knife to cut. It didn't taste anymore flavorful than a normal potato so you might be better off trying one of the other potato dishes.To finish we got the Striphouse chocolate cake of course! It is quite large and comes out slightly chilled.3 of us ate maybe half and let the birthday girl take the rest home. It was good but very rich and very difficult to take a bite of all 24 layers!Service was good.

For dessert we shared the chocolate cake and took half of it home. Total bill before tip was $143.Service was attentive but not overbearing.Pro: A very pleasant evening. Almost (see below) everything done perfectly.Con: Skip the garlic green beans, they are nothing special and certainly not worth the price. The only reason I am not bestowing 5 stars was the noise level. We arrived very early, the place was less than half full.

3.0,3/29/2015,"This place is old school.  How else do you put up velvet drop ceilings and call it charming (it's not, but others might say so).  Our group consisted of seven guys and we were there to eat excessively without judgement of wives or girlfriends (we may have also drank excessively).  We pretty much ordered every appetizer and side.  Some are better than others, but I would say the bacon, creamed spinach, and green beans were the best.  What sort of fell flat was the steak itself.  I did the double cut with my friend ($55/pp) and of the 34 oz that was delivered, 14 was straight fat.  We also ordered it medium rare and it was pretty rare.  I didn't mind the rare thing, but seeing that much fat on a cut that you are paying $110 for is sort of disappointing.  It wasn't a big deal because we had eaten way too much already, but you come to a steak house for the steak.The service is great, exactly what you would expect in an expensive old steak house.  Overall I really enjoyed the meal and I think this is a good spot for a group to get together.  That said, for my money, there are better steak houses in NYC.  I still think Luger takes top billing.",4,0,0,Tyler L.,"Manhattan, NY",251,523,1
1.0,3/28/2015,This resturant has been on a steady decline for the past two years. I have eatenhere many times in the past but decided to give it a break after a very disappointing experience about a year ago. Today I returned with my partner. We both ordered the Rib-eye. His was medium and mine should have been medium well. Both were tasteless and mine was burnt and unedible and the potato gratin was just dry. My stake was sent back and was even worse when it returned to the table. The service was good and the host was very friendly but we will never return.

3.0,3/27/2015,"I have to say, I was a little disappointed.     Came here with colleagues on the recommendation of another co-worker who said, ""best steak in NYC"".    We have a very small meal allowance from our company so we all agreed to chip in to make up the difference.I arrived early and had a nice drink at the bar but I felt like I was bothering the bartender to ask her for my drink and she never did bring me my glass of water.    When everyone arrived, we were seated quickly and bread was tossed on our table but no waiter in sight for quite some time.    He finally brought menus and service picked up a bit.     We had several appetizers including the bacon which was excellent - probably the best bite of the night.We all ordered steaks.   My boss and I both got the ribeye.   His was supposed to be medium, mine medium-rare.   Both arrived looking more like medium well but we kept them anyway since everyone else had their food.    I thought the steak was ""ok"" but the pepper crust overwhelmed the steak itself and I ended up feeling like I had a mouthful of salt by the end of the meal.     A good steak should stand on its own without a lot of seasoning.      Side dishes were good - the fries and the spinach were the highlight.   The goose fat potato that sounded so good fell flat and even though there were 8 of us, there was a good chunk of our single order left on the plate.Overall it was a decent meal but I didn't feel like it was worth the money or the hype.   There are definitely better steaks to be had in NYC.",3,0,3,Ann K.,"Sylvan Beach, NY",49,607,1

1.0,3/15/2015,"Came here for a friends birthday on 2/7/15, we entered through the lower level. Greeted by the manager, Valentino, promised to take care of my friend for his birthday, we had a party of 10. Valentino said it was ok for us to drink a bottle of whisky that we brought with us, and agreed we wouldn't be given a complimentary bottle of champagne. 5 minutes later Valentino said he couldn't allow us to drink our bottle, once I asked him what has changed in the last 5 minutes, his entire attitude shifted, he spoke in a disrespectful and loud tone, everyone at the bar and nearby tables stopped eating and looked on thinking a fight is about to go down. The rest of the staff kept working and looked like they weren't surprised the manager was acting like this, they seen him act disgusting in the past for sure. Once he got personal with me and, I told him the conversation is over. If it was my birthday I would've left and went somewhere else, since it wasn't I had to go with the flow of my friends. I can't believe a classy and prestige restaurant like strip house would allow an unprofessional & rude clown like Valentino to settle or discuss agreements with costumers, he was anything but courteous.   It was one of those nights where you and your friends have a good vibe, and it turns upside down because someone can't keep their word, embarrassed by me confronting the change in decision, Valentino took his anger out on me in a nasty way.The party of 10 I was with agreed never to step foot in strip house again, if I'm ever invited to eat there again, I'll be considered a no show. There are too many better steak houses in the city to settle for disrespectful service.- I don't like the dark atmosphere, they need to turn up the light, I want to see what I'm eating.- Steak was burnt on the outside, I ordered medium, it came out medium rare.- The sides were nothing special, but edible.- Way to stuffy inside if you come with a big group, we were sitting on top of each other, not comfortable at all.- Loss of appetite after the confrontation with the manager had me nauseous all night.$120 per person, I rather have spent it at Wolfgangs, Uncle Jacks, Benjamins, Peter Lugers, Club A....the managers know how to act professionally as well!",1,0,0,Leon M.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,37,21

4.0,2/17/2015,"4 star rating average & 600+ reviews?Strip House must be doing something right. I made reservations here last weekend for my significant other's bday on a complete whim. The name Strip House made me think of other things other than food but I figured, Meat + man = match made in heaven right? Right. This restaurant is not trendy or 'hip' (does anyone even say 'hip' anymore???) nor does it try to be. It's just filling, solid, old-school deliciousness. No, you won't find kale here nor do they claim anything is gluten free. Just carnivourous bliss. Now on to my experience here on a Saturday evening.The ambience is dark, with lots of black and red all over the place. The napkins even have a silhouette of a naked woman on them. I see what you did there Strip House. Very tongue in cheek. There's a lot of old school jazz standards playing in the background. Gabi A approves.My significant other and I ordered the oysters to start with. At half a dozen for $19 it is not cheap. But they were high quality oysters. 3 from the east coast of LI and 3 from the west coast of LI. Very fresh and very tasty. They taste exactly how it would taste if you bailed hard while surfing. Really good.For entrees I ordered the dry-aged NY strip and my S.O. ordered the 12oz fillet mignon. He ordered his medium while I ordered my steak medium-rare. Damn shame he ordered his meat like that, and I'm sure the waiter who was taking our order felt the same sentiment.The crust on my steak was delicious. So much pepper and crust. I don't know what kind of wizardry was performed to create it that way. To accompany the steaks we ordered the garlic string beans & the chef's special potatoes. I really wish I knew the name of the potato dish that we ordered. They were delicious. They were essentially fancy tater tots. The string beans were solid. While I served myself a helping of the string beans I saw a hair like thing on my plate. My stomach sank. Just my luck.I called over the waiter and he with no hesitation removed my plate immediately. The restaurant manager than came over and explained the situation. Apparently it was the hair of a string bean that happens from cleaning them. He said this was a rare occurrence but has happened before. They gave us a new order of beans and re-plated my steak.Our dessert was a brownie with their homemade ice cream which was nothing to write home about but tasted sweeter because it came complimentary for our mishap.All in all including drinks, the meal for the both of us was 200$.

Throughout the meal, the staff was very attentive, filling up drinks, taking orders, etc, in a timely but not intrusive or rushed way. Then, there was the amazing food. By far, one of the top steaks that I've had. It was perfectly done as I had ordered it, with a charred outside and tender middle. I ordered the filet, with parmesan-roasted brussels sprouts, and side of creamed spinach. All of this was fantastic, it would be hard to beat the food quality here. For dessert, I had cheesecake and tried the specialty chocolate layered cake. Both of these were fantastic, and would be something I would order again in a second.

The decor was a bit dark but gives a very intimate feel with the dim lighting and the red walls covered with black and white photographs. The restaurant has great atmosphere and a vintage feel.  The reason why this review isn't a five star restaurant is because I was late five minutes and when I arrived they had given my table away to someone else and I had to wait for 15 minutes. The front desk hosts know how  to make a birthday dinner special. I didn't even get a courtesy call when I was running late a few minutes to be warned it will be given away. I would've called but the subway didn't allow me such ability when I demand. I acknowledge the lateness but they were aware it was an important evening because I had called and made special requests when reserving. This grievance alone is a huge deduction on their overall rating. The rest of the night was spectacular once we were seated. Order their classic cut for two, 42 oz classic porterhouse, cooked medium rare. Flavors were spot on with nice juicy and buttery beef. Went perfectly with the roasted garlic bulb they provide to each person. We also had their special appetizer of roasted bone marrow with butter and garlic toast points. The entire bone is served with the marrow nicely roasted in the center and oozing with the gelatinous and beefy oils. The toast points were greasy but goes so well with the nice chunks of marrow. Finished the meal with their 24-layer chocolate cake with a special birthday message that was organized with the restaurant when I had made reservations. The rich chocolate flavors were nice and thick.  Overall, the food would rate at 4.5 but the reservation failure drops their rating to a 3. The food filled my stomach with deliciousness but giving away my table so quickly left a bad taste and a terrible impression. I don't want this to scar all other Strip House Steak Houses.

I enjoyed the soft pretzel sticks. 2. The mustard glazed Brussel sprouts side was the highlight of the meal. They were part of the specials menu and they're a no brainer. 3. I had high expectations for the Mac n cheese but it was nothing out of the ordinary. 4. My wife's rib eye was dry aged but didn't taste anything like it.

My wet aged bone in strip was good for a wet aged cut but you can get a much better dry aged offering for a similar price elsewhere.  6.

5.0,11/15/2014,"Our party of 5 from LA dinned here on a Monday night. Made reservations for 8pm and the place was lively and packed when we got there. We were immediately seated (yay for free coat check!). Our waitress was super sweet as well as the rest of the wait staff.The Food -- 8oz filet, medium rare -- came out great, although I thought it looked a little small for an 8oz, which honestly was fine by me. I barely finished it. Comes with half a roasted garlic head and I pretty much ate all the garlic with my steak.Golden beat carpaccio salad -- good, but I would try something else next time.Creamed corn w/ panchetta -- phenomenal! comes with some crunch on top which blends well with the creaminess. The panchetta makes it nice and salty so no need to season at all.Goose fat potatoes -- delish! It looks small when it comes out, but trust me, you probably won't finish it. It's almost like a mashed potato ball seasoned with rosemary and thyme and then deep fried. Sooo good!Mac 'n cheese -- I had a couple bites and was also really really good.. just the right amount of pasta and cheese mix. Comes in an iron skillet so it stays warm and cheesy throughout the entire dinner.Paired all that with a glass of Pinot recommended by our waitress which was the cherry on top.THE CAKE -- so we've all seen pics of the chocolate cake. 24 layers. 12 layers of cake. 12 layers of frosting. So here's the thing -- they seem to keep the cake refrigerated because when we got it, it was pretty chilled and not as good as I expected -- BUT, we took the rest home and ate it the next day and it was 10 times better. So, if you know you're going to splurge at the end of your meal, order the cake right when you get there so that it has time to come down to room temperature before you enjoy it.My salad, steak, corn, potato, wine and cake set me back $140 with tax and tip. Considering the amount of food I ordered and the service, it was well worth the splurge. I'm most definitely coming back on my next trip to NY!Cheers!",2,2,2,Julie M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",202,60,9
3.0,11/8/2014,"I have not visited here in some time. Nothing has change..... Great experience! The wine was good and the food was better! I have the bacon salad and my wife the crab cake for appetizer. Both recommended both were great! For main course I have the dry aged strip steam which was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing. My wife orders the filet and it to was delicious. The cream of spinach is highly recommended!!! Desert was good we had the profiteroles. It comes with three different ice creams.... Chocolate, vanilla and coffee. I hate coffee so we substituted the coffee for vanilla. The waitress made an error and forgot the substitute the coffee ice cream, but immediately realized her mistake once the desert was placed on the table. My only complaint was..... We did NOT get a new desert.... She merely took the coffee ice cream out of the profiterole and replaced it with vanilla. The original presentation of the desert was the server places the plate on your table and pours chocolate sauce over the desert. Well when she returned with our plate she was pouring the chocolate sauce over our plate as she was standing above us and placing the plate down. You ask why is this a big deal??? I'll explain, she could not let us see the chocolate syrup was in our plate already....  Poured by the first server when we received the incorrect ice cream. I know this because being a non coffee drinker I taste the flavor rather quickly. It's the same if you never use salt and someone adds a little you are able to taste right away. I did not complain about this to the staff but was very disappointed!! When you go to a fine Resturant and pay over $200 for your meal (2 people) and the establishment attempts to fool you it's insulting! It was obvious to us they did not want to waste money by making us a new desert properly as requested. But did not mind to waste our money and experience. Poor decision! I gave 3 stars for this total review because of the desert situation. I however give 5 stars for food and 4 stars for decor. We did not mention this because my wife and I were enjoying our evening and with our work schedules and children it's hard to get time alone. We just did not want to ruin the vibe and connection we were experience during our evening by complaining to the staff. The waitress just left a sour taste in my mouth and was disappointed over her not thinking my palate was sensitive enough to notice or we were important enough to serve us a fresh new desert(which she stated it was) It's the little things that matter.....

Both my husband and I had the filet mignon and both were cooked perfectly. I had the goose fat potatoes which came looking like a hard dome/pudding shape. Not at all like the roast individual potatoes I expected. They were good though - just a surprise.  My husband had what was possible the hottest (temp) jacket potato ever. It was still steaming way after we finished dinner !!Service is good, exactly how you would expect it to be in a high end steak restaurant. The tables are a little too packed together for my liking. I don't really want to hear the whole of the conversation on the table next to me, which was about 6 inches away from ours.... and there was no room to get out to use the bathroom without moving tables.

Wish I could give it five stars because the meal was great but unfortunately our table was in the middle of the restaurant and we had people passing by our table way too much, at some points I had servers and bus boys running into my chair and that was a bit annoying as I don't like people around me or over me especially when I'm eating. Other downsides were the Mac and cheese which was lumpy and cold as well as the complimentary bread, they have a pretzel kind that was way too salty for my taste but other than that this place was pretty good.

And I must say it was quite tasty, all though not the best I've had in the city. We split 3 sides at the table: Strip House Papas Bravas (not my favorite, but good with the sauce), Black Truffle Creamed Spinach (prob the tastiest item I had, mmmmmmm) and Sautéed Green Beans With Garlic (run of the mill, but not bad). The service was good, the waitress was very knoweldgeable about the menu and gave great recommendations, and it wasnt long of a wait.

4.0,9/22/2014,"I came here with my brother for a friend  because he wanted to have a steak in NYC before heading back to London. He had heard of Strip House from a friend and because the location was so close, I figured why not?

The room is rather dark and red with lots of autographed photos adorning the walls. I feel like the decor hasn't changed since the 60s? I was almost expecting to see a table full of mobsters in the back.The service was great, we were attended to fairly quickly. We split a bottle of Pinot Grigio which they kept flowing every time they noticed we were getting low in our glasses. The complimentary bread was delicious, although the pretzel thing they put in the basket was to salty! I ordered a NY Strip Steak (16 OZ-Medium). It was good but not great. I thought it was a little overcooked in a few places, but I wasn't about to send it back.

He was staying near Union Square, so I figured Strip House would be perfect. Anyways, the decor of the steakhouse was pretty old school, but not worn or dated, by any means.The menu contained your basic steakhouse offerings, and in an effort to be ""healthier"" at my mom's behest, we only ordered the 20-ounce strip steak, crab cake, and just got a variety of vegetables and sides. I liked the garlic and rosemary garnish that came with the steak, mostly because it livened up the presentation a bit. Strip steak was perfectly cooked, as expected, with just the right amount of salt crust and char on the outside. The crab cake, while very dense, had a nice crispy outside, and was full of delicious crab on the inside. We also got the creamed spinach, goose-fat potatoes, mushrooms, and the steamed asparagus. You know, to be healthy. All the sides were delicious, my favorite being the goose-fat potatoes. Seriously though, the potatoes were unreal. Yeah, it really wasn't that healthy though. Sorry, mom.Even though we had just gotten one steak, we were still quite full after the meal. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive, even chatting with us for a little bit.

I don't recall ever having left a steakhouse hungry -- and for that matter any New York restaurant. The rib steak was extraordinarily fatty. Despite ordering medium rare, more than half of the steak was very well done. We would have left it, but were too hungry due to the portion sizes, I guess.

I'm not saying he should be jumping up and down but a little smile or pleasant attitude would have helped.The food: we got the special dry rub 45 day whatever. It was good, but not mind blowing. It was lacking flavor. I found myself getting really excited when I would get a salt fleck in a bite bc that way, yum! Flavor! How does a 45 day dry rub steak not have flavor?? I'm not putting steak sauce or anything else on a steak-a fabulous steak should speak for itself.That said, it was cooked perfectly.Bread at the table, one of the types was stale. don't remember which one.The sides. terrible. The asparagus so boring. again lacking flavor and the Bearnaise was less than thrilling. the potato duck fat thing. for some reason both the bf and i had thought or assumed that this would be more like an au gratin style but it was this dry mash with a hard shell on the outside. again, less than flavorful. how do you mess up duck fat potatoes??I got a kahlua and cream for ""dessert"". this was delivered in a brandy snifter with no ice. huh? that bartender was nice and competent before-not sure what happened there.

2.0,7/9/2014,"1 stars + 1 star for the capable waiter (John C.)I've been to Strip House before, and had a great experience.  Ever since then, this steak house has been on my list of restaurants to revisit.  After our dinner last night, I now know this is one place I will not be returning to again.We arrived promptly for our reservation, the hostess and maitre d' looks us up and down, and seats us at one of the tables near the bar, and not the main part dining room.  Our party of four was the only one in this section at 7:45 - the tables here are small and cramped.  It feels like we were placed here because we were not wearing a power suit since there were plenty of tables available the main seating area.For starters, we had the lobster bisque, Caesar salad, roasted bacon, and crab cake.  They were all pretty standard and unremarkable - there were several slices of bacon and they were on the sweeter side (I'd rather pay for one slice of amazing bacon).  There were no lumps in the crab cake and there are better versions of this in the freezer section (sorry) of my local grocer.  We all got steaks, two bone-in rib eyes and a porterhouse for two.  While the meat was cooked at a nice temperature, they were under seasoned and only slightly warm when they reached the table.  The steaks cooled down very quickly.  The meat was so bland that it was almost inedible(!) without steak sauce - and I'm one of those that believe using steak sauce is a taboo, especially at a steak house.   For sides we had Strip House potatoes which was cheesy and salty, and black truffle creamed spinach.  Since we were there with guests from out of town, we also had the chocolate cake for dessert, the size of it and the numerous layers were the most impressive part.The highlight of our meal was the courteous waiter.  He was very attentive and polite when taking our orders and explaining to us the specials of the evening.  John C. came by to check up on us several times and made sure we were taken care of.  I couldn't help but notice that the servers kept saying (intrusively), ""pardon my reach"" every time they stop at our table to set the next course down - it was difficult to enjoy the food and carry on a conversation.  At other restaurants, the waitstaff would make the effort to walk around so they are not holding their elbows and forearms across the patron's face.We enjoyed our cocktails - the old fashioned was well crafted - no complaints there.  The house Merlot was on the dry side last night; the Cabernet paired better with the steaks.  The Fonseca was a delicious way to finish the meal.The decor inside was simple, dimly lit, red, and traditional.  It was probably an off night for the kitchen but there are so many other options in this town I will never give them another chance.  It's easy to spend $500 for dinner in NYC - this was supposed to be one of the top steak houses in the city and the value just wasn't there last night: the service was fine, but the food needed A LOT of help.  To each their own.  You'll find me enjoying hot, seasoned, sizzling, succulent American steaks elsewhere.",2,0,0,Jenny L.,"Queens, NY",95,191,288

5.0,6/25/2014,Went for dinner last night. We wanted to celebrate our birthdays now that my fiance and I are in the same decade. It was recommended by one of my friend and gosh... I am so happy we went!Decor is nice and very appropriate - lounge/boudoir like with waiters and waitresses wearing ties like in the old days.  We started with oysters - super fresh and overly good. We shared a 42oz porterhouse that was cooked to perfection - medium rare is the way to go.The black truffle creamed spinach were out of this world and so were the crispy fat goose potatoes... We were quite full and didn't try any dessert but I swear... This was one of the best steaks I had in my life and I can't recommend it more...

4.0,6/9/2014,"4/5 stars for me here. Came here with as a group of 6 for work. We showed up a bit early b/c it was pouring rain post work, mid week. Luckily it was 6pm and the only people in there were likely having an affair or 80 years old. We continued to our table, which was now 6. Striphouse set up another table setting on the fly, which was nice of them. One of the folks was from Atlanta and had been wanting to try this place. The walls are decorated with pictures and the steakhouse has a very old feel to it, as you'd like and expect. Our server was on point and offered some drinks before we started. We had some manhattan's and old fashions and ordered some appetizers. We had some oysters, the Lump Crab Cakes and the Strip House Roasted Bacon served with baby arugula, russian dressing. We also ordered a spring vegetable salad that was a special for the night, and recommended by our waiter. Each and every starter was well seasoned and delicious. I've had thicker bacon at Wolfgang's and Del Frisco's but the other appetizers were unique, especially the spring salad. On to the main course and sides. Our waiter did a good job of explaining the menu and I made a decision NOT to have a steak. Instead, I went with the Maine Lobster Linguine in a lemon-cream, lobster bordelaise. Everyone else ordered the ribeye bone in, which I tried and yes, was incredible. My lobster and pasta was perfectly cooked. Not too rich, not too overpowering one way or the other....just the right balance. We had some after dinner drinks and some Profiteroles which were served with hazelnut, milk chocolate & coffee ice creams and hot fudge sauce. Overall, this was a great experience. By the time we left the place was jam packed. I will say that our waiter was much better than in other steak houses. He didn't force things on the table, regarding which sides to order or how to get a steak cooked, etc. If you find yourself in the heart of Greenwich village, come check this place out! There is also a small little bar and lounge next door! Until next time...",1,0,0,evan r.,"New York, NY",9,131,7

The GM was so disrespectful and horribly unprofessional that I literally walked out and went across the street to Gotham (which was far more of a pleasurable and hospitable experience). When craving a steak in NYC...think of going elsewhere. I know I will. There are MANY other great places to eat a steak in this city. Good luck to you Strip House.

5.0,5/26/2014,"For my sister's birthday, I decided to take her to an upscale NYC steakhouse, and Strip House came up often as being one of NYC's better offerings.The restaurant is a very well decorated in that 1960's smoking room / lounge retro look with minimal lighting, deep red leather benches, and dark tones everywhere.  Pretty fashionable old-school look they have achieved, and it matches the ""Strip House"" theme/motif.We started with the Tuna tartare which was very tasty, and a proved to be a very nice light & fresh starter for a steak dinner.  Of note was the creamy avocado and nice small spicy zing of the wasabi roe.Now onto the steak!Being a huge carnivore (especially a huge fan of beef) I had very high expectations beforehand and Strip House delivered on those expectations.I know people's tastes vary greatly, but in my opinion, Ribeye is THE cut of steak to get no matter what, so naturally I ordered Strip House's 20 oz. bone-in Ribeye.My sister (another beef lover) also ordered the 20 oz. bone-in Ribeye.Honestly, it was one (if not the) best steak I've eaten, which was an opinion equally shared by my sister (she has eaten at Bobby Vann's & Michael Jordan's before as a frame of reference).It was superbly seasoned with just salt and pepper, which really allowed for the natural beef flavor to shine through.  In stark contrast is what you encounter at many of your commercial chain steakhouses that tend to mask the lower quality of their beef with extraneous seasonings and sauces.Adding to the experience was the awesome sear on the steak, which just sealed in all the moist medium-rare juicy beef goodness within.For the side we ordered the traditional steakhouse side of creamed spinach.  It was very tasty and rich (which really made the portion size just enough for two people to share, as I can't imagine one person finishing off such a heavy side dish).  Though I didn't really taste much of the stated black truffle.To cap the meal we ended with the famous Strip House 16-layer chocolate cake.I was a bit leery of the size of the cake, as when ordering our waiter asked it we were going to share the cake or order individual desserts.My fears were allayed as the cake was a huge single slice of chocolate cake, chocolate cream, and a top layer of rich chocolate ganache. What I loved the most about this cake was that it was not overly sweet; leading me to believe it's made up primarily of dark chocolate.Between us we could only eat just over a 1/3 of the cake, so be prepared!Service was up to par for a restaurant of this caliber and reputation, with the servers being ready, willing, and able to assist in whatever questions or accommodations you may require.Strip House definitely provided a great dining experience from the ambiance, the service, and of course to the superb quality of the food.",3,1,3,Edward C.,"Matawan, NJ",163,351,1430

3.0,5/10/2014,"Came here for a birthday. We had 12 people just enough for them to allow ordering from the main menu. They started by giving us bread and a drink called the amouse  Bouche. It was warm and had parsley on top. It was kind of creamy but still very tasty. I order the spicy tuna tartar which was tasty and was indeed a bit spicy but so that much. For entree I got the aged Ribeye boneless. Thinking I  should have gotten the boned one instead as my friends had gotten those and they enjoyed that better. I asked for it medium rare but got served it more on the medium side. Next time I should say medium rare but more on the rare side. There just wasn't a huge amount of flavor from my steak. Although the outside of the steak was charred which did help to lock the flavor inside, it was just not that much flavor. I have had better. Next time I will definitely get the bone in instead For sides I tried the following :Sautéed green beans with garlic - simple, nothing special just wanted something to go with the steakGarlic herbs French fries - just simple fries, wasn't that great to me. Wouldn't order this again. Sautéed wild mushrooms - this was tasty, I enjoyed this. For dessert I got the Baked Alaska which was very tasty. Seemed to have some alcohol near the bottom of the dessert which added a bit of a kick. Enjoyed the pistachio ice cream as well.  The cream on top was a bit let's say over the top, I could have had less and still enjoyed this dessert. Overall a great place to take a date, it has nice low lighting, big wine list and the place just raves expensive, but at the end it is a steakhouse and I wasn't satisfied with the one I got.",0,0,0,David C.,"New York, NY",44,162,122
5.0,5/5/2014,"First night visiting NY on vacation and we felt like steak for dinner. So we went to strip house because I had heard of it before and we wanted a dining experience.  First things first, this is a very pricey steakhouse.  But the overall quality, ambience, service, and food was all top shelf quality.  You will definitely get what you pay for here.  We started out dinner with a couple glasses of Riesling wine suggested by our waiter.  Excellent suggestion by the way.  We then moved on to appetizers consisting of complimentary house breads and butter and lobster bisque.  The bisque was served hot and poured out of a teapot into our bowls. Great presentation and amazing richness in flavor.  Our silverware was switched out with new ones for each new course and we now reach the main course consisting of a 20 oz new york steak bone in and a 14 oz ribeye.  The steaks came out cooked to perfection at the right temperatures and each had the right amount of charring. The meat just melted in your mouth and all the flavors were beyond words.  We also had a side of broccoli and asparagus that came with a very good cream sauce and complimented the steaks well.     If you are a steak lover this is definitely a place to go and experience for excellent food, service, and fine dining atmosphere.",0,0,0,Francis P.,"Bellflower, CA",46,15,16

I came here with co workers for  a work dinner and since none of us were footing the bill we went all out. I started with a cocktail and got the pama, which was fantastic! A sweet and light mix of gin and prosecco was a great start to the meal. For apps we all split the oysters and enjoyed the delicious bread basket! For the entree I got the filet mignon, which was amazing! It was perfectly cooked to medium rare and I thoroughly enjoyed it. A slight mishap occurred with my co workers filet as it was way overdone, but the staff handled it graciously and replaced her steak quickly. For sides we pretty much ordered everything, from the duck fat potatoes to the black truffled cream spinach. The spinach was the star in my book but my co workers loved the mac and cheese. We did get the famous chocolate cake, which was HUGE! The 5 of us split it and there was still cake left over to take home.

I ordered the lobster linguini which was TO. DIE. FOR! For dessert we ordered the cheesecake which was great AND we got a complementary brownie a la mode along with it!!! Amazing! Our server was great and the prices were too. The only 2 negatives I have are 1) we felt very crammed where we were seated (along the left side where the tables were half booth/half chair seating). We felt like we were on top of our neighbors and we could hear their every word. 2) We felt a little rushed.

Nothing is cooked fresh, its is only reheated. They brought me a plate of raw vegetables for dinner while my friends dined on steak and crab cakes. I mentioned that I've eaten in restaurants and steakhouses all over the world, ordered my food plain/dry and have never encountered an issue; Strip house's response ""we've never had anyone ask for plain food and every other steak house is lying to you"". They were rude and unwilling to compromise. If they had raw vegetables and spinach, there was no reason they couldn't steam them and at least prepare them nicely. All they needed to do was throw them in PLAIN, unsalted boiling water and when I asked for that the managers response was ""It's not possible and I didn't even charge you for the vegetables, what else would you like me to do?"".

I ordered the Roasted Chilean Sea Bass and it was nothing short of AMAZING!  The fish was cooked perfectly and the flavors in the dish married together beautifully.  I wasn't sure about the cockles (salt water clams), but they complimented the bass nicely.  The broth was flavorful and the chorizo was a great usage of an ingredient to add salt and texture.  The place is pricey and I was not sure I would get my money's worth, but I honestly feel that I did.  The ambiance is on the darker side (which I find warm and intimate), but I'm sure not everyone's taste.  There is lots of vintage art work up.  I happen to be a fan of all things vintage, so I enjoyed that as well.  I would definitely recommend giving this place a try for a special evening out on the town.",1,0,1,Rae P.,"Cambridge, MA",97,16,0

4.0,1/27/2014,"4 stars - based only on the cheesecake and the 24-layer chocolate cake for take out.Cheesecake - one of the best cheesecakes in NYC, period. Normally cheesecake crust is something to be avoided, this one is very harmless. The cheesecake itself is topped with vanilla frosting (could do without because it's pretty sweet and doesn't add anything), but the rest of the cheesecake is tart (lemon flavor throughout), not sweet, substantial, yet light, and just overall a home run. Top 5 I've had in NYC and I've had a lot. Except for the sauce. That sauce (seems like some berry flavor mixed with licorice) is clearly not right. Please don't eat it with the sauce.24-layer chocolate cake - 12 layers of chocolate cake mixed with 11 layers of chocolate custard, topped with 1 layer of chocolate ganache. Yes, chocolate custard is what's on the inside - not frosting or fudge or anything else. Custard. The cake is obviously very large, but not as big as the chocolate cake at The Palm (and it's the same price at $16). The cake itself is not to sweet, which is great. If it had been icing instead of custard, it would've been way too sweet. The cake layers are pretty standard chocolate cake, good, but not particularly special. The custard layers add what the cake really needs - moisture and uniqueness. It makes the cake creamy, particularly if it's warmed a bit, and makes it a bit richer because otherwise this cake would be way too light. It's still light, not dense, and certainly not rich, but the custard and ganache help make it more substantial. Overall taste is great, but if you're a dense chocolate person (people who love super rich flourless chocolate cakes, for example), this cake will be too light for you. I guess you can just eat more to make up for the lightness.",0,0,0,Laura P.,"Manhattan, NY",4,342,0
4.0,1/27/2014,"Been here a few times now and I must say, I have yet to be disappointed.  My friend had the rib eye while I opted for the lobster linguine. It is definitely the best lobster linguine I've ever had. There were literally chunks of lobster meat in there (unlike a typical Italian restaurant that gives you tiny crumbled pieces). I love love LOVE the truffle creamed spinach. My friend, who does not like to eat his veggies, enjoyed the dish as well. I would definitely recommend that to everyone. The goose fat potatoes are indeed a very small portion. I didn't find it mind blowing in anyway, though my friend enjoyed it. I really liked the Brussels sprouts as well. It was not drenched with oil like some others have said. It was seasoned perfectly and topped with lemon juice, which I love. Yes, we would compare this place with Peter Luger and /or Del Frisco's, but I believe each restaurant has their own attracting parts. The decor in Strip House is marvelous. From the few times that I have been here, it does get a little loud and you will hear your neighbor's conversation; all of it. I would definitely come back and bring those who haven't tried it yet. It's a great place for a nice dinner after work but is even better for special occasions, especially if the person you are bringing loves unique a interior.UPDATE***Came here again.. and I was so disappointed. The bus boys were rude... and took away all the food, cleared the table BEFORE I WAS DONE EATING. We were a party of 8 (first time dining here with more than 2 people) but that does not justify the way they served us. My steak was tasteless!!

5.0,1/23/2014,"Wow. My fiancee and I loved our meal here. From the dark, warm interior to the photos of old movie stars on the walls, to the food, there was very little not to love.Getting the negatives out of the way first:1) It's pricey (it's a steakhouse, so...)2) My fiancee ordered the house special martini with bleu cheese and black truffle stuffed olives. I believe it cost $25. I took a sip -- it was basically vodka. However, she said the olives were amazingly delicious.3) The busing staff was oddly and overly attentive. They were constantly refilling our water glass even when it was more than half full and were kind of aggressive in taking away plates/food. It felt like they were standing right behind me. They were polite though, so it wasn't a big deal.Now, on to the positives:1) The appetizer: We had roasted bacon. Thick cut (about 1"") and served with arugula. Kind of hearty for an appetizer, but so good.2) The steak. We had the porterhouse for two, medium rare. Cooked perfectly, and the meat was delicious. Normally there's a big difference in flavor between the filet and the strip. Honestly, I thought they were just as good. The meat was seasoned and charred so well that even the fatty parts almost melted in your mouth.3) The cake. Their famous chocolate cake is famous for a couple of reasons. A) It's good. B) It's roughly the size of a basketball. Man up and order it. You'll have leftovers for days, but it is so worth it.4) The service. Our waitress was knowledgeable and friendly.

2.0,1/2/2014,"I would hazard a guess that the good reviews here come from very young people who haven't been to a steakhouse before.Let's start with the meat. It is wet-aged--this is something unambitious steakhouses do because it allows them to minimize losses (dry-aged meat shrinks and costs a lot more). But of course they charge for it as if it was dry-aged. I wouldn't be surprised if my ribeye was a Choice cut, too--the marbling was not good, and it was gristly as all hell. The cut was thin and oversalted to the extreme. I just don't understand why anyone would eat meat here.The sides were meh--small and greasy. The brussels sprouts were positively swimming in oil. The goose fat potato thing was tiny; maybe 6 tbsp in all.Then there is the wine list. You don't expect a good deal at a NYC restaurant on wine, but their prices are just over the top.The crowd and the noise level: maybe it was just the night we were there, but they were piping horrible disco music over the loudspeakers (emphasis on LOUD) and the crowd was of barely legal drinking age.

Had the special - bone-in filet, with the crab cocktail for an appetizer and the au gratin potatoes and green beans for sides. The crab cocktail and potatoes were outstanding. We also had their signature chocolate layer cake for desert (one piece easily enough for 3 or 4).

(I get it, it's new york, but I don't think its fair when I'm spending last weeks paycheck on this meal).  The bus boy, however, was fricken awesome.  We both agreed that he should be the one greeting and taking care of guests, but thats a slim to none chance considering his ethnicity (yep, I said it).  I know a small portion of my tip goes to him, but I felt like he should have received it all... he gave us fun conversation and did all the work, not the stiff white guy who had absolutely no personality.And for a young, hard working couple, beware that you probably won't come out of there without a $300 tab.

2.0,11/1/2013,"Look, this isn't a bad steakhouse per se, but when you're in the conversation for best steak in New York, I expect more. A lot more. The gold standard, for me, is Peter Luger's. So inevitably I have to compare this place to Luger's. But it just doesn't compare. The meat at the Strip House is prepared and cooked beautifully, but you can absolutely taste the difference in quality between this place and Luger's. Even their bacon appetizer isn't as good. Again, that doesn't mean their steak or other things are bad, but definitely not worth the price. This place shouldn't be in the discussion for best steak in NYC.The night I went, the waitress, who was very friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful (always a plus), told our table that they had just gotten a large shipment of black truffles, so she rattled off the night's black truffle-heavy specials. I opted for the NY Strip with foie gras and black truffles. I could taste neither the foie gras nor the truffles. Very disappointing. The actual quality of the meat itself was nothing special, either.I also had some of their steak for two. Generally speaking, at a steakhouse like this that's the best cut. Again, beautifully cooked, but you could just taste the difference between the quality of their steaks and the quality of the meat at Luger's.The sides we had (black truffle potatoes au gratin, creamed spinach, and string beans) weren't great either. Just like with the steak, you couldn't tell the potatoes were prepared with truffles. The creamed spinach, which always has to be great if you want to be considered a great steakhouse, was just ok. String beans were fine.Also, their bartender is subpar. Cocktails are nothing great--taste was mediocre at best and presentation was heinous (the twist in my martini was more brown than yellow).

The restaurant has a fun retro ambiance making you feel like you are sitting in a restraurant that has been in the city for decades. We order the chopped salad, 2 ny strips (med rare and med plus), strip house potatoes, whipped potato puree and steamed broccoli. The chopped salad was oily and confusing. The flavors did not blend well and it was a little on the salty side. Moving on to the main dish we were extremely excited to dive into our strip steaks. The food runner brought out the steaks and did not know which steak was which. This I would normally not even pay attention to but come on, we are 1 of 5 tables at this point and there are only two steaks. We sort the steaks out and dive into what was probably the most over seasoned steak I have ever eaten. The chef blasted both with too much salt/pepper/steak seasoning.

Amazing ambience, impeccable service, and delicious food and drinks.I'm visiting from LA and was in dire need of a steak dinner so my friend and I decided to try Strip House. We didn't have a reservation and it was a Saturday night, but the manager said he could get us a table in 20 minutes or so, so we grabbed some drinks at the bar.I asked the wonderful Ariel if he could shake me up a lemon drop with muddled mint and my friend ordered a Manhattan. Let me first say that I love lemon drops and order them any chance I can get. Unfortunately a good lemon drop is hard to come by so I haven't been ordering them as often as I'd like lately. I felt good about this place and hoped they'd be able to satisfy my lemon drop needs. OH MY GOSH. Ariel made me the best lemon drop I've had in two years, this one was probably even better than the last (Foundation Room, Las Vegas). The mint was muddled perfectly and paired wonderfully with the citrus and it was ice cold. I was in love. I sat at the bar mmm'ing creepily with every sip.The dining room was beautiful and we were instantly greeted by our lovely server, Carrie. She told us the daily specials and brought fresh bread while giving us time to look over the menu. I ordered the lobster bisque which was delicious (a close second to Mastro's Ocean Club) and a filet which was cooked perfectly. Ordered another lemon drop from Ariel, which I hadn't originally planned on, but I couldn't resist. The meal came out in excellent time and the filet was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.Carrie brought the dessert menu, but we were both so pleasantly full that we passed. We thanked her for her service and I told her that I'd been looking forward to a nice steak dinner in New York since it was my first time in the city and how happy we were for the experience. The next thing we know, she brings us a huge slice of cheesecake as a thank you for coming in and for my first time in the City.

I ordered the 14 oz dry aged rib eye medium rare and they definitely cooked it medium rare so that was good. The steak itself was not the best in terms of taste, it was quite bland and even with the house sauce it is only pretty good, probably not worth the $48 I spent on it. I get much more flavor and tenderness from my grill back home. For sides we got wild mushrooms, potato puree, and cream of spinach. Mushrooms were pretty decent. Potato puree was quite bland, and basically just potato that was mashed up. No extra seasoning and needed more salting. Cream of spinach tasted wayyy to spinachy but that is certainly good if you are into that for your cream of spinach. I would definitely recommend the puree and spinach at Capital Grille over Striphouse's sides.The 16$ Chocolate cake that feeds about 7 people was a monster, as expected since it was 16 freaking dollars for a slice of cake. It definitely looks huge and delivers a great finish to your dinner. I would rate this place 4 stars for the dessert/service/ambiance but 3 stars for the food (average steak). Since we paid 70$ a person (we did not get wine), Im rounding it down because food taste is more important to me and the fact that we paid roughly $70 a person I was expecting a better experience.I might come back again and try another cut but im on the fence about this one.",0,0,0,Xi L.,"New York, NY",176,484,179

When asked the occasion, the hostess gave me a strange look and said ""it's Wednesday!""Even with reservations, we waited over half an hour for our table but were supplied with libations (drinks pack a punch and if you're willing to pay for it, are plentiful in selection). Our waiter was nice, offering up suggestions all night. On his recommendation (and the many Yelp! reviews), we ordered the truffled spinach (as delicious as they say!), crab cakes (delicious, very crabby in the best way!) and the ripped apart potatoes (fried, delicious), ribeye (rare & delicious) and rare strip. Everything was quite delicious (word of the day?!?) and we much enjoyed our amuse bouche of creamed cauliflower soup.We enjoyed everything and when we were too full for dessert, our waiter decided he'd treat us, serving up a complimentary slice of classic NY cheesecake, complete with lemon tart icing. Wonderful and great hospitality.SO and I loved the dark, intimate atmosphere and our neighbor table shared the sentiment.

3.0,9/5/2013,"Food Rating: 4-5 starsService Rating: 2 starsFirst I want to start off saying that the food was good. We had their Filet Mignon which was very nice. As side we shared the Strip House Potatoes, which were perfect to share between 2 people and just delicious! For desert we decided on the Creme Brulee. Disappointing was definitely the service. Our waitress was good, but the other staff somewhat felt like either they didn't want to be there or they didn't want us there... At some point one of the guys just took my husbands bread plate while we were in the middle of eating without any reason. They kept the plates for everyone until the end of the meal... just didn't make sense at all - we had just barely started tasting the breads.

5.0,9/3/2013,Strip House is an old school steak house in NYC with delicious food and a great ambience.  The garlic bread with gorganzola is an amazing way to start the meal and the creamed spinach can not be beat.  The steak was cooked to perfection and came with roasted garlic to put on it which was a nice added touch.  I have been to many steak houses in NYC and I think Strip House really tries to be traditional with a slightly different flare.  The meal truly was mouth watering and I would definitely rank this among one of my better steak house experiences in NYC.,0,0,0,Kelly R.,"Manhattan, NY",25,45,0

5.0,8/24/2013,"Come on guys, like I can afford a lap dance in Manhattan! To clear up any confusion, just like Beaver Choice in good ole' AZ, Strip House is NOT a strip club. It is only one of the oldest, coolest steak houses in New York.As an enthusiastic carnivore, my visit to Strip House taught me that we West Coast dwellers have a LOT to learn about a good steak!Let's start of with the atmosphere. I knew I was in for a treat when I entered the intimately lit dining room decked out in red. I am a SUCKER for old school, red leather booths so they had me, hook line and sinker within 10 seconds of my walking in the door.I was seated and promptly greeted by my server who was cordial, friendly and professional all at once. Throughout my whole meal I felt like I was looked after by an army of servers who made sure that my drinks were filled and that I was a happy camper. It was amazing to be looked after so well and by so many people without it being the least bit obtrusive or annoying.I started with a Caesar salad which was delicious: the perfect fusion of fresh romaine, hearty but not heavy dressing, parmesan and of course some yummy little fishies.I opted for the special, which was a 12-ounce bone-in filet mignon. I've been to a few high-end steak houses in my day and I have NEVER had a bone-in filet. So I kind of felt small and inadequate and like a bad meat-lover. Needless to say I had to overcome this handicap so I ordered it with great eagerness and anticipation.I was NOT disappointed. It was served blackened and crisp on the outside but oh so delightfully tender and juicy on the inside. I could practically pick the meat off the bone with my fork.  And to top off my bliss, my server got the chef to prepare some fresh garlic mashed potatos. I LOVE garlic mashed potatoes but sadly so many places serve such utter shit. Not the case, the potatoes were lightly fluffy and creamy and mixed in with fresh roasted garlic. Only one other time in my life have I had such heavely garlic mash.  Seriously as good as it gets. I accompanied this with a delightful pinot noir.Against my better judgement I ordered New York Cheesecake for desert. It was smooth and creamy but alas I could only force half of it down before I was fully spent. Just too much damned good food.While I still don't know if I could ever live in New York, experiences like these make me reconsider. I know that my tummy and tastebuds would move here in a heartbeat.I envy all of the folks who do live in New York who can come here whenever they want. Even if I lived here I wouldn't take a place like this for granted, Since I don't live here I can add Strip House to my places for special occasions and let it embody New York living in my mind.Whether you're local or not and haven't been here you're in for a remarkable dining experience.",7,4,3,Eric R.,"Denver, CO",544,563,170

5.0,8/23/2013,"Been here many times for different occasions.  Ambience is great, the burlesque moulin rouge kinda scene, very romantic and sexy.  I prefer the downtown spot over midtown, decor is very similar but downtown spot is def more intimate.For food, I always leave my appetite for the steak so the bacon is the only thing I tried before.  I am personally not a super fan of bacon so this doesn't really do the justice.  Steak is absolutely mouthwatering.  Get porterhouse for two if you have the appetite, it's HUGE.  Filet mignon is a good portion for the girls and it's very juicy.  What stands out for Strip house than the other steakhouse in the city is the way they treat the crust.  It's seasoned enough for you not to dip any steak sauce, even the sauce comes with the steak.  I recommend to try it without the sauce, it's definitely flavorful enough for your liking.  Black truffled cream spinach is the side you can't miss.  After all these food, you will probably have no more space for dessert.  Other than the chocolate cake, I like the way they do Baked Alaska.  It's not easy to find this dish in the city and Strip House does it well!",2,0,0,Fiona C.,"Manhattan, NY",221,21,6
5.0,8/19/2013,"Took the bartender's recommendation on the roasted bacon and was like ""ok this guy here, he knows what he's talking about so I will trust this man the rest of the night."" I was enjoying my 6 slices of super thick bacon complimented by a small arugula salad and a nice peaty single malt and then comes my buddy Chuck who wants to eat some of my food...I was like ""no way man we can order some when our party gets here, this is my consolation for waiting on you aholes!""  Chuck stole some of my bacon anyway.  Now the funny thing is with all of that fuss about bacon, the steaks?!?!?!?!  Oh the steaks were incredible!  Dry-aged is all that needs to be understood here, don't go out on your own, don't even think about what you're used to eating, get the dry-aged steak(s) and you'll be good, trust the man!OK the bill was close to a cool $400 between 3 people but it was so worth it!  Back soon--",1,4,0,D.

5.0,8/13/2013,"This place is excellent, it's my second favorite steak house behind Lugers. I love the decor, it's very dark and very classic New York. The crowd is kinda upper crust New York, though.The food:New England Sea Scallops- My only issue is that there are only two scallops but with that said, it is a perfect dish. It has two perfectly cooked scallops on a corn broth with edamame and greens. I could easily eat three plates but at $16 a pop, it's on the pricey side.NY Strip- A medium rare strip steak is my steak of choice, the filet is nice but lacks flavor, in my opinion. The nice addition that works perfectly with the dish is the half bulb of roasted garlic, the garlic and steak pair excellent together.Goose Fat Potatoes- I really liked this dish, it was kinda like a deep fried potato igloo. The outside is perfectly crunchy and the inside is like the best hash browns. Strip House Chocolate Cake- This was the only thing I wasn't insanely in love with. It was just a very big ass chocolate cake. It was basic, nothing extraordinary.",2,2,1,Ben L.,"Queens, NY",978,1001,2785

3.0,7/26/2013,"Came here after dinner one night to get dessert and a glass of wine, so my review is limited to that. And by dessert, I'm referring to the chocolate layer cake, because what else would you order for dessert when that is an option.The cake was excellent. I would have preferred it to be served a bit warmer, as I think the flavor was more subdued by the fact that it was served as if just coming out of the refrigerator. But it still had that rich, chocolate-y, moist flavor. It was also a huge piece of cake, and between my date and I, we still took almost half of it home. I'm looking forward to throwing those leftovers in the microwave for a few seconds to warm it up before devouring it.The wine was served way too warm. It tasted warmer than room temp, as if the bottle of red had been sitting next to a lamp or computer that was pushing out so heat. Didn't finish the glass, so minus one star for that. Overall I would say if you're looking for a nice end to the night and want to get some dessert, Strip House would be a good option.",0,0,0,David B.,"Charleston, SC",0,31,3
3.0,7/15/2013,"Went here on Saturday night for my birthday. Had a reservation but were told it would be a minute or 2 for the table to be ready and to go over to the bar, which was no problem. Ordered a drink at the bar (a nice heavy pour) and the table was ready for us just as he handed me the drinks. Great room. Much more laid-back than the stuffiness of some of the midtown steakhouses. A complimentary serving of gazpacho came out, which isn't really my thing, but my wife loved it. For starters, I had the bacon, which was excellent, and my wife had the special which was tuna tartare, which she said was unbelievable. Add to that the fresh pretzel rolls and we were in heaven. We ordered our steaks, and unfortunately, this is where things took a disappointing turn. All I had been dreaming about for the previous few days was enjoying a big, juicy ribeye. However when it arrived, it was so overly fatty that I had to send it back. Now, I know a ribeye is a fattier cut (which I love) but this was inedible. The first cut I made was pure fat, no meat, and the more I cut into it, there was a white strip of hard fat running through the middle of the entire steak. When I did get around the fat to some meat, it was overly tough as well. I rarely send anything back, but there was no way I was eating this. Our waitress, however, was excellent and very accommodating, and the manager was nice enough to come over as well, which I really appreciated. Unfortunately, fearing another ribeye would be the same cut, I played it safe and opted for a small filet which was cooked perfectly, however, not the same as a ribeye. I was disappointed to say the least, but the staff was great and even sent over a complementary slice of cheesecake with a candle in it for my birthday, which I don't remember my wife or I even mentioning.I almost forgot, the goose-fat potatoes for a side dish were incredible. I'd go back just for more of those.Overall, everything else was very good and the staff was fantastic, but it's pretty disappointing to go to a top steakhouse and the steak you've been dreaming about for days has to be sent back for being inedible.Maybe next time...",2,0,0,Joe W.,"Rutherford, NJ",2,4,0

1.0,5/27/2013,"I visited Strip House on a Saturday evening with two of my girlfriends on the recommendation of another friend of mine. We made reservations for 9pm, confirmed our reservation via phone, arrived at 8:59pm, and were pleased to hear that our table would be available within 5-10 minutes, as soon as another table finished paying their check. At 9:30pm, you can imagine our surprise when we were still not seated. In fact, we were not seated until 9:45pm, after a friend of mine visited the hostess stand for the third time. I understand that there is some degree of uncertainty involved in planning reservations and estimating wait times, but I did not appreciate being told that the table we were waiting on was indeed, ""paying their bill"" for 45 minutes, as this seems very unlikely. It was clear that we were not the only customers who had arrived on time and were waiting in excess of 30 minutes to be seated. I rely on the fact that upscale restaurants like Strip House are better able to manage the traffic at the restaurant, and in the event that they are unable to promptly seat a party for a reservation, they offer a drink or comp some portion of the meal; however, neither courtesy was extended to my party. One of my girlfriends actually spoke with the manager regarding this matter to which the manager replied that should he comp our party at least a drink, he would have to do so for all of the guests who were waiting an inordinate amount of time beyond their reservation. She actually noted to him that night that would have been the best business decision he could have made that night seeing as how the restaurant completely FAILED to manage their reservations. In fact, there was a couple there with a reservation for an anniversary dinner who got a babysitter who was only staying till 11:00; it did not appear that they would be seated anywhere near a time that would allow them to have a meal.Despite our terrible experience to be seated, once seated, we had a very good meal . However, our 45 minute wait with untruthful information about how soon we would be seated dramatically dampened our experience. In a city such as New York where customers have a multitutde of fantastic restaurants to chose from, Strip House needs to better manage their reservation and learn how to better treat your customers so that you see return guests rather than unsuspecting first timers.",0,0,0,K A.,"San Francisco, CA",0,6,0

5.0,5/11/2013,"This is only the second 5* review that I've given, but it's definitely justified.My guy was in NYC for business and I flew up to join him for the week. Since this was the first time he'd been to NY for any length of time, I wanted to treat him to a really nice dinner outside of the business dining/hotel restaurant experience. He's definitely a meat a potatoes kind of guy, so I took the recommendation of a friend and made a reservation at the Strip House down by Union Square.Our reservations were for 8:30 and it took about 15 mins to be seated, which was no big deal. We enjoyed looking at all the photos on the wall and sipping on a cocktail while we waited. The ambiance is definitely old-school steakhouse, with flocked wallpaper, pictures of celebs on the wall, and deep red lighting. When we were seated, we were served a basket of various breads and butter, and two small ""shots"" of a smoked potato and leek soup that was really delicious. The soup was smoky, slightly salty, and had a drizzle of peppered oil on top. What he ordered: NY Strip medium rare, asparagus, chopped saladWhat I ordered: Petit filet medium rare, goose fat potatoes, mixed greens saladWhat we shared: a bottle of Grenache, the chocolate cakeHis chopped salad was served with chickpeas and Parmesan. My field greens salad was served in a roasted Parmesan bowl. The dressings on the salads were subtle and just right - not at all overwhelming. The steaks - wow. What can I say about the steaks? Both came perfectly cooked - medium rare - with a crust that was slightly salty and meaty. His NY strip was served with a steak sauce, but it was too sweet/sour and he didn't eat it at all after the first taste - because the steak didn't need it.  My petit filet was melt-in-your-mouth tender with a flavorful grilled crust on it. We both agreed that they were the best steaks we've ever tasted. The steaks are served with a head of roasted garlic, which perfectly accompanies both the steaks and the sides we chose. Take your fork and pull out a soft, sweetly roasted clove and spread it on the potatoes or a slice of steak, and it's an absolute revelation in your mouth.The asparagus was perfectly cooked to be lightly crunchy with a buttery/lemony Bearnaise sauce that was awesome. The goose fat potatoes were not what I expected (I was picturing something akin to home fries cooked in goose fat and what came out was a molded mound of potatoes with a rich, browned crust), but they were absolutely amazing. Breaking thru the browned crust to the tender and fluffy potato interior was delicious and perfect.Be warned that the sides are large, so you should plan to share them. We each ordered 1 side with our steaks and then split them between us.For dessert we ordered the famous 24 layer chocolate cake. It was HUGE. The guys at the table next to us even commented on it and we all laughed. We wound up eating slivers of it and taking the rest back to the hotel and snacking on it for 2 more days. (Thank heavens for hotels with refrigerators). The service was impeccable and our waiter was absolutely the right level of friendly and attentive without being obnoxious. He offered suggestions for wine  that were spot on. If you're not used to NY prices, this place will make you a little woozy when the bill arrives. (Or as my guy said: ""Darlin' that's a car payment!!!"") But for a special treat out, it was perfect. (Plus, I already own my car, so I'm ok there!) Our total bill, plus tip, came to just a hair under $400. I highly recommend Strip House for a nice steak dinner if you're in the mood for a splurge.

5.0,5/9/2013,"I'm going to be saying this more than once throughout this review: THE BEST STEAK I HAVE EVER HAD..........EVER! Now, I didn't really eat steak until I moved to New York - it's just not done that well in the UK (sorry fellow Brits, but we do really suck at cooking steak!) So I started my foray into this new food group at Del Friscos, which was a revelation. Then I moved to Peter Luger's - again good, but the cross waiters put me off. Capital Grill, Porterhouse, Quality Meats, Maloney and Porcelli...etc etc etc They all had delicious steaks on offer, and it's probably for the best that I didn't try this one in the first couple of years that I was there. It wasn't until a few weeks before I left NY that I came here with friends and was completely blown away. Now I like any restaurant that is dark, red and sexy looking like this place. I especially like restaurants that have comfy chairs, very friendly waiters and a full bar! I was torn on what to order, so let the waiter guide me to the small (hahahaha!) NY Strip.  It was enormous, and the best steak I have ever had! (I told you that was coming along again!) I ended up scorning all the sides and taking half of it home. The leftovers that I had in a sandwich the next day were just as good. That meat was just the best I have ever tasted!",1,0,0,Emma M.,"London, United Kingdom",2577,438,329
5.0,5/7/2013,"This place is amazing! I love the filet here, which I being a 110 girl, can easily finish the 12oz so I say for the extra $8 bucks or whatever it is, just get the bigger one. The potato sides are ALL amazing!! The twice baked smashed is the best. The coolest part is that the place use to be an old Speak Easy, so if you walk in to the main door from 12th they take you all the way through the way they use to take people when it was a Speak Easy so you get the full effect. The bar is cozy, and has tons of character. I can't wait to come back and just have a cocktail and hang out. The service is so fantastic! We were able to try 2 of the deserts, both were so incredibly good!!! The Cheesecake and brownie w/ ice cream. Can't wait to come here again!!",0,0,0,Kris R.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,46,2

I have never seen that at a steakhouse, especially one that is so expensive. Also, I typically can never finish a meal at a steakhouse, so I usually have some leftovers that I ask to take home with me.

First we had 8 o'clock reservations only to be sat at almost 9. The hostess was out and out rude. The worst part is that they must have changed distributors because I basically received a salted tasteless piece of meat as opposed to a steak. To help you understand, when my so called steak was served, the runner made sure to drop off steak sauce. That's the kind of clientele that Strip House serves now. The Steak Sauce kind.

Host wouldn't make eye contact, hostess snidely smiled at me, lied to my face telling me we hadn't been skipped, while the host whispered to her about getting us a table in front of me, talking behind his hand like a child, and miraculously, finally a table opened.  Total fiasco:  birthday meal ruined, $400 thrown away on some of the most unprofessional service and mediocre food I've had in the city, and the steak, the reason to go? Bf said since ownership changed hands they must have changed distributors.  That it was ok, nothing like it used to be.

5.0,2/25/2013,"My boyfriend took me to Strip House for our one year anniversary last Saturday night and we had a lovely meal. The ambiance is intentionally old school with lots of red and black and old photos all over the walls. Very old New York and kind of romantic. We sat at a table near the front of the restaurant and our waiter was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu and made some great suggestions. He recommended a really great pinot grigio for me and my boyfriend had a beer. We were served a shot of cauliflower soup, which I normally would not have liked but was surprisingly yummy. For my appetizer, I started with the lobster bisque which was presented beautifully in an oblong bowl and poured table side from a soup kettle and topped with creme fraiche. My boyfriend had the crab cake. Both appetizers were absolutely delicious. We both had the filet mignon and ordered the roasted brussel sprouts and smashed potatoes for our sides.  I loved the brussel sprouts but thought the potatoes were a little too crunchy (my boyfriend completely disagrees with me about the potatoes, so I think it's just a personal preference.) Next time, I'd probably try the whipped potatoes or the creamed spinach. When it came time for dessert, we decided to try the chocolate cake. I'm a huge chocolate lover and just couldn't resist. The cake was literally the size of my head and tasted as amazing as it looked. As our cake and coffees came to the table, the manager of the restaurant stopped by our table. He introduced himself and said that he noticed from his appointment book that it was our first time dining at Strip House and thanked us for eating there when there were so many restaurants we could have chosen in NY. He then gave us a complimentary piece of their delicious cheesecake. I thought that this was a lovely thing to do, especially since we were already perfectly satisfied with our meal. We ended up taking home both cakes, and half our steaks and sides. We got quite a bit of food for the price and the experience was one I'll be raving about for awhile!",0,0,0,Jennifer N.,"Huntington Station, NY",61,55,2
3.0,2/15/2013,"Went here on Valentines Day. I'm torn between wanting to give it 5 stars because the night was great (I got to spend Valentines day with someone so special) but wanting to give it a true review for the food.5 stars for the service!  The staff was great and kept refilling our water, made sure we had everything, knew the menu well.  Kept clearing the table when appropriate.  Just great all around.  The hostesses did seem a bit disorganized.They gave out a soup shot which was cute and very tasty. Maybe cream of broccoli or cabbage or something?  Was good though.  Very rich.We shared the scallops appetizer.  The scallop itself was good but it was very salty. Came in a bowl of butter and cream.  Good flavor but was just too much.  They really need to go easier on the salt.  The filet mignon was good.  I got it medium rare, 12 oz.  It seemed to lack seasoning. There was salt on the top but there was a flavor I felt was missing.  A little more fatty of a cut than I usually find at steakhouses.  Maybe because this is the third time I've had filet mignon in the last week I am a little more pick than usual. Ruth Chris seemed a bit better in cut and flavor.Mash potatoes (potato puree) seemed a bit too buttery but were not bad.   Macaroni & Cheese was excellent!!  My favorite part of the meal.  We got the chocolate cake then to go. I love cake and I love chocolate. I eat a lot of both unfortunately (since my pants are getting tight).  I would say this cake was okay.  But with the price and hype around it I expected it to be better.  It was dark and had nice romantic lighting. I liked that. Typical NYC restaurant with many tables near other diners, the norm. Maybe it was just as it was valentines day so every table was booked and they were super busy that the food seemed to be a bit lacking given the reputation and price.",2,0,1,Cori B.,"Manhattan, NY",26,64,0
3.0,2/14/2013,"I'd give this place 3.5 if i could, but think overall that the restaurant is overrated so i'm rounding down.  Came here for dinner last night and had a 8:30 reservation.  The waiting area was packed and i knew it was gonna be a while so we hit the bar for some drinks.  I don't mind waiting 15 minutes when i already have a reservation, but it 40 minutes, and that's just ridiculous to me.  What's the point of taking reservations then?  Anyway, once we were seated they brought over the bread basket, which was awesome.  I loved the pretzel type bread, it was definitely different than what you usually get.  For our app we went with the bacon, which was awesome.  I was actually surprised by how big the appetizer portion was, and thought the arugula with russian dressing gave it a nice touch.  As our entree we got the porterhouse for two, with sides of the black truffle creamed spinach and goose fat potatoes.  By far the best thing was the creamed spinach.  The addition of black truffle just brought it to a whole other lever.  I didn't see what the big fuss is over the goose fat potatoes.  It's not that big of a portion, and i didn't think it tasted much better than normal,  homemade mashed potatoes.  It was a pretty big letdown.  The steak also was kinda disappointing.  It's way over seasoned.  There's no need to put that much pepper on a steak.  It completely took away from the taste of the meat.  I read about this in some other reviews and just thought they were probably exaggerating, but they were right.  Taste wise, the filet side was much better than the strip size, and i'm more of a strip guy, so i'd stick with the filet if you're going.  We got the steak medium-rare, and it was cooked right, but was lukewarm when it arrived. It wasn't still cooking on the plate like at other steak houses.  Overall i just don't think this steak house is worth the price.  The steak was good, but i'd take lugers or wolfgangs, and probably even delmonicos, over this any day.",1,0,1,John P.,"Queens, NY",154,594,399

My friends had the ribeye for two and was equally delicious. We had the creamed spinach, corn, and brussels sprouts as sides. The creamed spinach was the best I've ever had at any steak house.

Add on some sauteed wild mushrooms and black truffle cream spinach as sides and, voila, I had a perfect dinner. The spinach was excellent, the mushrooms were as I expected, and the steak was excellent.The best I've ever had? No. But up there. The outside was slightly blackened as it should be and the inside was still juicy and moist. The large salt crystals they sprinkled on top of the steak was an unnecessary garnish in my mind since a good ribeye needs no additional flavoring or sauce. However, when they brought out their unique steak sauce, I had to just try it. It was excellent. Too bad I dont usually use steak sauce.

5.0,1/3/2013,"I'm a pescetarian (fish-eating vegetarian) and I LOVE steakhouses. My Yelp profile doesn't list my full steakhouse resume, but I've been to the standards in New York City and tested their seafood offerings -- just to name drop a few: Peter Luger, Wolfgang's, Keen's, Old Homestead, Sparks, Capital Grille, Smith & Wollensky.Out of this bunch and others not mentioned, the Strip House is one of the best experiences and certainly among the best for their seafood offerings. The crowd can be a bit touristy, but this is a NYC steakhouse we're talking about here so good luck finding something a bit more off the beaten path. At least at 12th Street, it's not a heavy duty midtown business crowd so you'll feel comfortable going on a nice date here. The dark atmosphere contributes to this vibe. The service is outstanding and they've given me some of the most professional service I've experienced in years of NYC fine dining. Anyway, my carnivorous companions all say that the Strip House is the best steak in the city, but ... how about the seafood? Well - I love the crispy skin salmon - it's an outstanding choice and I never feel like I'm missing out in any way on the indulgence of the steakhouse experience - it's buttery and flaky and perfectly prepared like the best pieces of salmon. The sea bass is also a nice choice, and on occasion I've had swordfish. But I've had the best experience with the salmon recently. I've found their other seafood offerings - like their crab cake - also to be fresh and worth trying.As for the sides -- the choices are plentiful but the one that haunts my dreams to this day is the black truffle creamed spinach. I'm not a drug addict but I imagine eating this stuff is about as close as I can get to chasing the dragon. Other vegetables, like the broccoli, mushrooms or asparagus, are a little more average but still do the trick. Also, go with the Strip House potatoes for your starchy side.

Coincidentally my holiday dinner for work was the same night but I literally took one bite of each dish because I wanted to save myself for the delish steak I knew I would consume at Strip House. I had reservations at 8:15pm but it took them about 15/20min to seat us. They started us with some yummy bread and rolls as we split a bottle of red. Our waiter was very friendly and charming, however I did feel a slight bit rushed but that may have been due to the crowded side seating and rambunctious atmosphere. We settled on the porterhouse for two and side of cream corn. We wanted to save a bit space for dessert so decided to only get one side. The char on steak is effing heavenly. Perfect salty and smokey flavor encrusting some tender a$$ meat. Oh yum. I think it is the best steak in terms of taste I've had in the city. The corn was super rich and I think I ate the majority of it. For dessert I asked them to bring out their famous chocolate cake for my bf's birthday. We could only eat about a quarter of it because it is as big as my head. I was really looking forward to the cake but it wasn't as amazing as I expected.

3.0,12/8/2012,"Went there for dinner a couple nights ago and it was a really good experience!  Our table started off with the seafood tower as an appetizer, which was pricy and almost left us feeling that we didn't get our money's worth, however, the entrees and sides more than made up for it.  I ordered one of the specials, the bone-in filet...  It was flavorful, tender, and cooked to perfection!  My side consisted of the roasted brussel sprouts, which were probably the best I've ever had -- they were that good!For the deserts, the table shared the Alaska Bake and the 24 Layer Chocolate Cake.  The Alaska Bake was just okay...  It seemed to be missing that something ""special,"" but it wasn't bad.  The 24 layer cake was very rich and decadent, and it was huge!  Between three people, we couldn't finish the whole slice.The service was excellent and the food came out quickly.  While there's room for improvement, I definitely enjoyed the visit and will be back again.",1,1,1,Jaszon S.,"Westchester County, NY",948,224,182

So delicious and flavorful, and so plentiful! I didn't even finish 1/2 my filet and I can eat!

For main dish, I got their New York Strip Steak, cooked to medium, with Black Truffle Creamed Spinach. The steak was cooked just about right and it was quite delicious, although it was certainly not the best I have had. I tried a bit of my friends' veal chop and lobster linguine as well and they were all pretty good.

This was some of the finest meat I have ever had.  We started off with the most indulgent appetizer that one can order...their thick bacon.   So wrong and so tasty!  If there is one tiny complaint, which is very minor is that the salads seemed sort of ordinary.  On to the reason to come to the Strip House...the steaks.  I ordered the NY Strip with bone and my wife ordered her usual of Filet.  I love Strip and it's my favorite cut and this one was prepared absolutely perfectly.  It was wonderfully charred on the outside and it's not completely dripping in butter which is what some steakhouses do as a cheap way to appeal to you.  My wife's filet was quite simply the best filet I have ever tasted.  The filet melts in your mouth and I can not stop thinking about it.  It stays with you for hours.  Bring the cash because it is very expensive, but all great restaurants are in NY.  The service was impeccable...what a great stop.

A friend recommended this place and salivated at the thought of a good steak, so I made reservations. Unfortunately, the only opening they had was a 5:30 dinner, but I didn't mind too much. I must say this was the best steak house I have ever visited. The ambiance had an intimate feel to it. The service was by far, the best I have ever received in a restaurant. A dedicated water boy refilled our glasses every time we drank water, and the tables were cleared and cleaned with diligence. We received shots of spicy cauliflower soup before the food came out, compliments of the chef. For entrees, my brother and his girlfriend shared the 42oz Porterhouse, while I ordered the Bone in Rib Eye, which was highly recommended by the same friend who suggested this place. Both medium rare. Both cooked to perfection. I make no exaggeration when I say that the Bone in Rib Eye was the best steak I ever had. We were all pretty full by dessert, but the waiter, seeing that it was our first time there,  presented us their vanilla cheesecake which was on the house. We ended up taking it to go because we were truly too full.Overall, I had a great experience. I was definitely not disappointed and will definitely come back again when I'm in the mood for steak.

I've been to a few steakhouses including Peter Lugers, Old Homestead, Wolfgangs, and Del Friscos but the service and food is outstanding at Strip House. I did have an issue with how my steak was cooked the second time around but they took it back without any problems and not only made us a new order but also gave us complimentary new side dishes since ours were cold and half devoured by the time the new order came. The manager also came by to make sure everything was how we wanted which we really appreciated. We had the bone in Filet Mignon and bone in Rib-eye, both were melt in your mouth delicious. The creamed spinach is probably the best I've had out of all the steakhouses I've been to. I also recommend the creamed corn with Pancetta and crisp goose fat potatoes.

When the stake came.... it had no side dish.... it had like a piece of VERY dried lemon with some type of plant sticking out from it... looked like a small CHRISTMAS TREE... even though it was summer.... maybe it was CHRISTMAS LEFT OVERS.... they also gave me a SPECIAL HOUSE SAUCE... that tasted like a REGULAR KETCHUP....  since when does KETCHUP becomes a SPECIAL HOUSE SAUCE.... ???the STEAK WAS HORRIBLE...  i had to chew each piece like 100 times before I could swallow it..... avoid this place... there are other places where you could get a cheaper steak that tastes like a normal juicy steak that melts in your mouth....boooooooooooooooooo strip house .... you guys SUCK in making steaks.... booooooooooo",1,0,0,Arthur S.,"REGO PARK, NY",1,4,1

3.0,7/17/2012,"Excellent meal marred only by the fact that my group was split up over two tables. Our reservation was made a month and a half in advance and we were never told that we would have to be split up. Granted, we were a large group (19 people), and we had two more people than we originally reserved for. Because of the two extra people, I had no problem with the fact that seating was a bit tight around the tables. But even without them there would have been no way to seat us all at one table. They should have been up front about their lack of seating for large parties. As I said earlier, every other aspect of the meal was excellent. We ordered 5 porterhouses to share and each one was cooked perfectly. The bacon was also excellent. I'd like to come back here, but with a much smaller group next time.

4.0,7/10/2012,"Being ranked as one of the Top 5 steakhouses in NYC on multiple critics websites, has to say a lot about Strip House. When you walk in, you're taken back several decades to a vintage burlesque era. The room is dark-lit, with deep red undertones from the red velvet-like walls plastered with photos of old celebrities, red cushioned seats, white table-clothed tables and dark wood-lacquered furniture. It's borderline tacky, yet classy once you get into the mood of things. It's private and cozy enough to bring a date, or open enough to spend an evening out with some friends wanting to splurge on some wonderful cuts of beef.To start, we were provided with 3 pieces of varying complimentary bread which were all equally good. A salty like bread stick, raisin bread, and another firmer bread roll.I ordered the 20 oz. Bone-In Rib Eye ($46), wet-aged. It was cooked to perfection, which is my preferred Medium-Rare. The steak was seared two or threefold so that there was a very thick and deceptively looking burnt/charcoal crust on the outside of the steak. But it was far from burnt. The steak was tender, juicy, fatty, and rich with flavor. The heavily seasoned crust was out of this world, subtly salty and seasoned enough to really accentuate the flavor of the beef. Neither did it  have that thick greasy feeling that steak sometimes has. Every bite was delicious and I realized I wouldn't have my steak any other way. Complimented on the side  was a bulb of roasted garlic which was also very enjoyable with every couple bites of steak.The 14 oz. Bone-In Filet Mignon ($52) dry-aged for 28 days, an off-the-menu special, cooked medium, was also a treat. I was surprised that the filet mignon was still very tender and juicy, even when cooked at that temperature. It had that same nice salty crust on the outside, making for a very enjoyable steak.For our sides, we tried the Crisp Goose-Fat Potatoes ($12) which was sort of like a mashed potato smooth puree contained inside a hard crispy shell. It was good, but I could have easily gone without it. We also tried the Black Truffle Creamed Spinach ($12) which was thick and creamy. The creamed spinach was definitely a step above the Goose-Fat Potatoes. It was tasty, though nothing out of this world, as I didn't really notice the pungent aroma or distinctive flavor from the black truffle.Service here was impeccable. Our waiter was very courteous, taking the time to explain the different cuts of meat, how they are aged (dry vs. wet), and their daily specials. Our glasses of water would be constantly refilled by the busboy who always seemed to be on close watch as well. When we initially began to cut our steaks, the table was unbalanced, and I tried to carefully cut my first slice of steak without spilling our glasses of wine (which average $12-$20 / glass). A busy boy noticed and rushed over. He knew exactly what was on our mind and placed what resembled to be a towel underneath the table to stabilize it. Our waiter would frequently come by to check up on us, always unobtrusively, and seeming to come at the right time. Even when I went to the bathroom, the waiter would come over to fold my napkin on the table.We were somewhat full after eating a sizable piece of steak, so we decided to skip dessert/ We had some leftovers which they doggy-bagged, provided us with a ticket stub, and informed us we can pick up our leftovers by the front entrance. We sat to enjoy the ambiance and chat for a while. The waiter was nice enough to bring over a small plate of complimentary baked pecans coated with brown sugar. It was decent, though not something of my preference. I only ate one or two, before opting out to enjoy the rest of my glass of wine. When we were about to go, I took a quick glance behind me and noticed our water was serving another table. As soon as he was done servicing the other table, he conveniently brought the bill without me even having to ask. As if he read my mind. Smooth and attentive.If you have any doubt of going to a pricey steakhouse especially the lesser known Strip House, I highly recommend checking it out. It is true that you can easily spend $200+ for two steaks, 2 glasses of wine, 2 sides, and then some. But it is worth every penny.",3,0,2,Jason P.,"Forest Hills, NY",545,1119,3574
5.0,7/4/2012,"Hands down, my favorite steak house in the city. I came here a few years ago for the first time, and again for my birthday this year, and it was just as good as I remember the first time. We started out with the seafood tower which was pricey but worth it. We were a group of 7 so I had the opportunity to try a few different sides including truffle creamed spinach, goose fat potatoes, ripped potatoes and the strip house potatoes. My favorites were the spinach and the strip house potatoes. I chose the bone-in filet, medium rare, which was excellent, although I wish I had ordered the bone-in ribeye.

5.0,6/28/2012,"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday and we both loved it. The decor and music are upbeat and sexy without being sleazy. (Red lights, current music, black & white photos of women.) It's fresh and more accessible than stuffy steakhouses overrun by men in suits, and pretentious waitstaff.AND THE RIBEYE IS SO GOOD. He got the 20oz ribeye and polished it off- down to gnawing on the meaty char on the seared bone. I got the 20oz strip steak and although it was good, I ignored it to steal bits of ribeye off my bf's plate. Thankfully, the staff were happy to put the strip steak in box to go in the coatcheck for later. (Such a good idea, so you aren't sitting at your table with awkward chinese food takeout containers.) Both were cooked medium rare as requested and seasoned perfectly. We got the goose fat potatoes which were like a weird potato cake and the caesar salad which were fine, nothing special. They also sent out an amuse bouche of gazpacho that boyfriend loved. Drinks were all fine.We ordered the chocolate cake and the staff were kind enough to put a candle in, which I had requested in my opentable reservation. The cake is ENORMOUS as has been mentioned, and most of it also came home with us.So 5 stars for the ribeye and for the staff executing 99% flawlessly. We got off to a bit of a rocky start because we had a trainee waiter + his shadow waiter, and we were lost without menus/drinks for a bit, but the wait staff was all very sweet and personable which I appreciated. Our table was never without food, and all empty plates were removed immediately, and the staff smiled and joked with us.Need to start thinking of a reason to go back for the ribeye...",1,1,0,Lila C.,"Brooklyn, NY",24,78,0

3.0,6/26/2012,"Sorry i have to deduct 2 stars. I have to admit, the last time i was here, i should have given this place 4 stars instead of 5. However, now i have to bump it down to a 3. The front of the house was fine. They checked my bag no problem, and i just sat at the bar. The bartender was chill. I asked for an Old Fashioned, and he made it well. He asked me if Maker's was fine, and i said it was perfect. Instead of using a sugar cube, he just used a small spoonful of sugar, but he def didn't overdo it like the bartender at Lugers.The waitress who took our orders was very nice too. She was personable, and knew all the daily specials. She was also able to inform us the difference between the bone-in ribeye and the other steaks on the menu. All of their steaks are wet-aged except for the bone in rib-eye special which is dry-aged. For apps we got the bacon and crab cake. It sucks for Strip House that i got the bacon at Lugers. The bacon was cut into smaller pieces and it was definitely smaller and more expensive than Lugers. In addiition, it was severely overcooked. It was like cutting and chewing rubber. It had a unappealing char of dark brown/dark red. not like the reddish/pink hues of Lugers. The crab cake was fine. It was actually pretty yummy.I ordered the 12 oz. filet mignon medium rare. What i got was a medium/medium-well steak. I was disappointed. Unlike the last time i was here though, the steak was seasoned well. Too bad it was just cooked improperly. I was expecting to see some blood drip out onto my plate, but nope, there was no blood whatsoever. The saving grace was the roasted garlic that came with the steak. I smeared that all over my steak slices to cover the doneness of my steak. Black Truffled cream spinach - best part of dinner. It was awesome, and i have to admit it was better than lugers. THe mac and cheese was good, but no lobster or truffle? Ehh i've had better at other places.",1,0,0,Thomas A.,"Watertown, MA",329,895,435
5.0,6/21/2012,"Throughout my suburban adolescence, my parents would occasionally drag my brother and I into New York for dinner in the big city. More often than not, we'd be at steak joints. However, they never brought us to Strip House. And I'm pretty sure it's because of the boobies.Accompanied by blood red decor and sexy dim lighting, the bordello-like establishment has loads of topless, black-and-white, burlesque photos framed, mounted, and lining the main dining room. Not so sure the horny teenage version of myself would appreciate an expensive steak when there are titty-balls on the walls to gawk at, so maybe the parents made the right decision here.Anyway. I recently sat down at Strip House for an all-out gorge-fest with a table of dudes. And sticking with the adults-only vibe here, well, we ran pretty much ran train on their menu.First came the amuse-bouche, a shot glass of Tomato Gazpacho, a very nice, cooling, summer taste to kick off the feast. The Vine Ripened Tomatoes and Red Onion appetizer, a pick I would've never thought to order on my own, had some of the freshest vegetables I've ever had at a restaurant. The Strip House Roasted Bacon was solid, thick, flavorful, mandatory. And the special was a must-try, if for its creativity alone - a Seafood Sausage comprised of crustacean meat and bacon bits. Think consistency closer to foie gras than the snap of a typical link of encased ground meat. And instead of, perhaps, an intermezzo of sorbet or Prosecco to cleanse the palate between courses, the kitchen must've sensed the gluttonous display from our crew was just hittin' its stride and sent out Lamb Chops for the whole table - on the house!As for Strip House's steaks, if you've got a willing and able carnivorous comrade at your side, definitely tag team the 38 oz. Classic Porterhouse (for two; $45 each). It's the best of both worlds really, given it'll yield tender cuts of both strip steak and filet mignon. Cooked to taste (medium rare), this pick was obnoxiously delicious, a perfect porterhouse in every sense. When it comes to sides, you simply can't go wrong, especially when you have six different types of potatoes to choose from (their self-titled, twice-baked gratin gets my vote). The Black Truffle Creamed Spinach is a strong, popular selection, but the under-the-radar Creamed Corn with Pancetta was the sleeper side, for sure. I could've housed one of these all my own if I didn't have seven other bros to consider (although, I'm still pretty sure I took the lion's share). And then, for our final trick, we washed it all down with an uber-rich slice of their signature, innumerably-layered Chocolate Cake.For a pricey place, the fact that Strip House is pumpin' Led Zeppelin and Rolling Stones through their speakers sucks any stuffiness right out the room. It's also appropriate because everyone here is a bona fide rock star. The service is professional, but personable, and the front of the house certainly knows how to treat a well-paying table.

A complimentary amuse bouche of pureed something or other shooter (potato?) was served to us at the start. We ordered a half dozen West Coast oysters which were good, but not mind-blowingly so, perhaps no longer in season. The black truffle creamed spinach was fabulous as touted, but all were unnecessary precursors to what proved to be the star of the meal -- the Bone-in Ribeye.  We had almost ordered the porterhouse for two -- our standard order at every steakhouse that offers it -- to compare apples to apples, but our waiter was adamant about us switching over to the bone-in ribeye because as he said it was more representative of their signature char. He was so passionate I thought for a moment they might have some extra incentive for pushing the ribeyes that night, so we had no choice but to acquiesce. Hats off to you, Waiter! Crisis averted. The bone-in ribeye was divine. The fleur de sel sprinkled across the crusty charred surface really made the flavor of the steak pop.  The sauces that they served up on the side were expendable, but it was nice to have them as an option for those who love their sauces.  The atmosphere was intimate without being stuffy so it's worth bringing a date or two if you can afford it.

We had ordered the fudge brownie with ice cream and they placed a candle on the top in honor of my BF birthday which was a nice touch.  I was sooo full by the time it came I only had a couple of bites but it was good!  I was really impressed with the manager's attentiveness.  He stopped by our table halfway through our meal to see how we were doing and if everything was okay.  Then before our dessert came he gave us complimentary cheesecake (delicious and creamy) since it was our first time there!.All in all great night but be prepared to shell out $$$ (it was worth it)!",0,0,0,A P.,"Queens, NY",0,3,0

4.0,4/4/2012,"I read so many good things about this place so I figured I would have to try it out. Apparently I'm not the only one that has heard of this restaurant because I made a reservation for Saturday night a couple days in advance and the only seating I could get was at 6:15pm. Although those are senior citizen dinner time hours, I did not get any early bird specials here. Be prepared to empty the wallet.Upon walking in it became clear where all the money was going to. The decor was pretty well designed offering up a low lit posh look to it that seemed like you are stepping into the 1940-50s. They have the waiters wearing white bolero jackets which would make for one messy bullfight and a launderer's nightmare. The black and white photos of dead celebrities all over the walls seemed like and odd and overdone choice. Obviously that was meant to class the place up but the photo of Rambo with the explosive tipped arrows kinda shattered that idea for me. I guess if you are going to a steak place you have to throw in some manly elements.The 20oz. rib eye is what caught my eye. On good days I have been known to take down as much as 35oz. in one sitting but I can eat like a normal person every now and then. They cooked my steak to the medium rare temperature that I had specified and, although it was good, I expected something amazing for the $46 that I spent on it. I also had the mac n cheese and the truffle cream spinach. Both these side items were entree prices at lesser restaurants. They were both as good as expected but nothing too exciting. Pretty standard. The hype machine on Yelp was working in full force on this one and I guess I had my expectations way up. There are so many really great steakhouses in NYC and this place tries really hard to give off the idea that it has been around just as long as the others. You will get a good steak here but there are so many places that do just as good or better and for less money. Because of that, I could only see coming back if I am meeting friends or have an event here. If you haven't been here it's a good place to try. It just adds one more decent option in a sea of many other good options.",2,2,0,Evan M.,"Manhattan, NY",96,320,158

1.0,3/26/2012,"First of all, let me say that nothing has ever upset me so much that it would spark me to write a bad review, but I feel that it is my duty to do so.  My friend and I were visiting from LA, and we wanted to go out and have a really nice steak dinner.  It was our last night there, and we wanted to just do it up and enjoy.  Upon reading multiple good reviews, we decided to try the Strip House.  We had a 10:00 reservation, and apparently our table wasn't ready so we were escorted to their ""grill"" next door, which was a new addition to their restaurant, just a little more casual.  We were open to it, so we said that would be fine.  The first server that greeted us was nice, but apparently she was just starting us off, because our actual server was rude beyond belief.  I couldn't even believe it.  I have been serving, bartending, and managing for over 10 years, and I can't believe that a nice, expensive restaurant would let its staff act in such a way.  Every time we ordered something or asked a question she would glare at us and give us a condescending and passive aggressive answer.  Basically she tried to make us feel dumb, and very unwelcomed.  In addition, she never once asked us for another glass of wine, as our glasses sat their empty.  We had to flag down another server to be served on multiple occasions.  Then our dinners came out...what a moment..We ordered filet mignon and lobster tail with fries, goose fat potatoes, creamed spinach, and a side of cheese sauce...Although the sauce didn't come til about 10 minutes later, the first time she checked on us..Meanwhile, we decided to eat our steak anyway without the sauce, and discovered that the steaks and the lobster were not hot at all, in fact slightly warm.  The fries and the spinach were good and hot, that's it..Those were the best parts.  The plates of steak and lobster were not even warm, and your plates should be hot to keep the food warm.  We sent it back, we were paying good money for steak and lobster, not for it to be sub par and not hot.  Our server's response was, ""oh, well, I was checking the window, and it wasn't sitting up there for long""  ..Rule number one..NEVER make excuses to your tables, you take responsibility, and never act defensive. Who hired this girl?  When we got our plates back, 10-15 minutes later, the steaks went from medium rare to medium well, and the lobster was over done and chewy.. Funny thing was it still wasn't even hot..At this point we were super annoyed, and I told the manager about our horrible experience.  She was over apologetic, as well as the General manager who came over, and gave us his business card, and told us to call him if we want to come back for a better experience.  I don't think so.. BTW, out of towners beware, do not say you are not from New York, as we did, because they obviously don't care.  We just wanted to get out of there, and the manager sent out 2 desserts when we were trying to leave.  We paid the bill, worst $250 ever spent!!! They didn't even do so much as to offer to take off a steak or anything, when they are the ones who messed up!!! Couldn't believe it!!!  I wasn't going out to get anything for free, I will gladly pay for quality, but they ruined our meals, and our service was horrible!

It really removed the feel of the place and I felt like I was in a cafeteria rather than a whore house... no bueno!But, the one thing that I do suggest, is get the potato and cheese starter, I don't know the exact name, but it is the 'ripped potato' something like that. It goes so well with the steak. Also stay away from the vegetables... yes the urban myth is true, a steak house is for steak...",2,0,0,Mischa A.,"New York, NY",83,69,4
3.0,3/13/2012,"Steak was a bit overly salty for my taste, as were my side dishes (not too much to make unedible but enough to notice), which bothers me (this is also the reason SH gets a 3 instead of a 4 or 5 star rating) because oversalted dishes are either done so to mask other ingredients that the chef feels lack flavor or the chef is going for the overflavoring/overpowering approach.  Imo, a good steak (such as the one at Striphouse, which was in fact the strip) doesn't need more added flavor to be exceptional, it needs less because it should be in and of itself naturally flavorful.  All in all a decent place, but certainly not the best for steak in NYC.",0,0,0,Brandon M.,"Raleigh, NC",23,132,2
2.0,3/12/2012,"A friend and I arrived promptly for our Thursday evening reservation at the very popular Strip House. We were seated in the bar area, which I thought was a little odd considering we had a reservation. It was sort of cramped, not the best situation but considering the fact that the ambience here is super creepy old-manish/porno/weird/:insert your own odd and confused impression: anyways, I was willing to overlook it. I was here for the steak!!! Duh.The overall service was quite lackluster: awkward waiter, giving us our steaks but not our sides until a few mins later, giving us the wrong check, trying to clear the table while my purse was on it...just odd, but again I was here for the steak. So let's get to it...I was so disappointed. We both got the bone-in strip steak, which is supposed to be their thang. But honestly, if that's their thang, they need to go into a different business. First off, we both ordered a 20oz. It was definitely not a 20oz. I'm a fatty, I've been to a few steak houses and I can guesstimate or at least compare size based on the look and most definitely how full my stomach is. After a steak, I've usually eaten myself to an absolute food coma and want to roll up into the fetal position with the happiest of smiles on my face...not the case here. We even went for ice-cream after this then I went home and ate an entire bag of goldfish (yes, please don't judge me).Now to logistics for our slab of meat...when they brought our little bundle of joy (or so I thought), I was as happy as could be. It smelt great and looked great (minus being pretty small but I wanted to give it a chance at that point). The steak was perfectly charred, I will definitely give them that but my steak was definitely more on the rare side and my counterpart's was what I would consider medium rare (we both ordered medium rare). I would have been ok with a rarer steak, if that's what they considered medium rare. I mean I'm pretty much a garbage disposal, I'll eat whatever and judge it for what it is...but the inconsistently in our steaks made it pretty disappointing and for a top notch steak house, you really can't have two wildly different steaks at the same table.Now for the actual nom nom...so disappointed. It was just not a top quality steak. I know it's a strip but there were multiple bites I had to spit out and at a top steak house, I'm willing to overlook a bad piece or two but it was just a complete waste. A good portion was back on my plate. I honestly felt I could have gotten a better quality steak from the grocery store or even a place like The Outback crossed my mind (which I wouldn't have been as pissed about since I'd be paying a fraction of the price)....ok that might be an overstatement but you know what I mean here. Maybe I just got a bad cut...who knows but overall, the steak was overly salted anyways, the sides (creamed spinach and goose fat potatoes) were mediocre.  It could also be we went in with some lofty expectations given its reputation and positive reviews, but when you don't even come close and I leave not just mildly disappointed but pissed considering I love food...something is wrong. I've done some of the other top steak houses, had the same expectations, and haven't really been let down like this before. Maybe I'll try Strip House again to see if it was a one off...but highly unlikely since there are so many better places in the city and the fact that I could use the money I spent for about 15 Happy Meals...which undoubtedly makes me happiez.lisapak.com",0,2,0,Lisa P.,"Boston, MA",2,15,0

2.0,3/8/2012,"I recently dined here with reservations on a Thursday night around 7pm. My companion and I were looking forward to Striphouse for a while since it is always highly regarded in the conversations around best NY steakhouses. In our opinion though, Striphouse was very disappointing and lacking in not only the food, but the service and ambiance as well.Even with reservations, we were seated in the bar area instead of the main dining area, which was unappealing for a couple reasons. The noise level in the bar area was very lively, as expected, but not what you want during a dinner. Also, the bar area was uncomfortably cramped. Every time you shift around in your seat or move your arms to cut a piece of steak, you feel like you're going to bump the person behind you or trip a passing waiter.The meal itself wasn't terrible by any means, but it definitely wasn't memorable in a good way either. Our waiter did well to take our drink orders, then gave us ample time to look over the menu and tell us about the specials. We passed on the appetizers this time around as nothing quite stood out. I will add that we usually go for steakhouse bacons; however, there was never enough buzz around Striphouse's bacon to warrant a go at it, especially after you've had Luger's, Wolfgang's, and Del Frisco's. For our entrees, we both ordered medium-rare 20 oz. bone-in NY strips (the cut that Striphouse is supposedly known for). The steaks arrived with perfectly crispy chars on them that deceivingly promised an equally tasty treasure laying inside. Upon cutting into the steaks, my companion's meat was more rare than medium-rare, whereas mine was a nice warm red medium-rare. One of our biggest gripes with the steaks was that they were not tender enough to compare with the other top steakhouses. If it normally took 3 cutting motions there, it took 5 here. We felt that we spent more time and energy cutting than enjoying. To add to the disappointment, our steaks were showered with an overly-generous amount of salt. Don't get me wrong, I love a nice salty and well-seasoned steak, but when the salt crystals overpower the meat, that's when you have a problem. I will say that the accompanying roasted garlic is a nice touch though.Based on the other reviews, we decided to go with the crisp goose fat potatoes and black truffle creamed spinach sides. The potatoes were deep fried on the outside, but provided nothing special in terms of flavor or texture. The spinach wasn't as pureed (which I prefer) so you could actually see and taste more of the spinach leaves. Unfortunately, I could not taste that much black truffle in the dish. As with the steak, the potato and spinach sides were over salted, leaving us disappointed and thirsty.The last straw came when it was time to pay and our waiter even handed us the wrong bill. I understand that it's busy, but a quick glance at a $540 bill for a party of 2 should have set off some bells that something was amiss. He expressed his apologies and fetched our correct bill, but still, this sort of mix up should never occur.Overall, it will be a long time before I would consider coming back to Striphouse. Over-salted food coupled with less than great steaks led to a disappointing experience. For the same price, there are other NY steakhouses that offer better food and service.",3,1,1,Enoch H.,"New York, NY",134,26,25

My only gripe is that it was just a little too seasoned for me, something easily fixable on our next visit. Bf loved how his steak was cooked, too-buterflied, medium well. We had to try the black truffle creamed spinach and it was fabulous! The intense black truffle flavor was an interesting spin on such a typically boring side dish.  We decided to pass on a potato side and try the creamed corn with pancetta and I'm very happy we did! It was my favorite of the two sides which shocks me as I love me some truffle!Dessert was really the only part of dinner that left me less than impressed. We ordered their signature chocolate cake and it came cold and dry. We each took two bites and couldn't eat anymore.

I had the Strip steak, asked for it medium well, it came medium rare. At this point, our waitress disappeared so I dealt with it. My boyfriend ordered the Lamb Rack.

I don't understand why you wouldn't want to put out anything but your best stuff as it's an opportunity to bait a lot of new clientele. I think because so many people order from the limited menu that the cooking process becomes more of a conveyer belt like process during that week. Anyhow, I got the ribeye, which I was not very impressed by either the cut or the flavor. It was very thin!

Checked our coats and waited by the bar for 20 minutes before we were seated. This place was popping for a random weeknight. Aside from the yummy bread basket, we started off with the crabcake. Nicely done with a good amount of crabmeat. M. had a glass of red wine. I had a glass of Riesling which I thought was very good. For the main attractions, I ordered the Bone-In Ribeye, medium rare. M. had the 16 oz. strip steak, medium rare. For sides, we had the Crisp Goose Fat Potatoes and Black Truffle Creamed Spinach. The steaks came out and looked ridiculousy good. Both were done as requested and were deeeeelicious. I even enjoyed their steak sauce. It has a smokier taste rather than sweet, like most other steak sauces.The creamed spinach is a must have as a side. Absolutely delicious-if you like truffle oil. We liked the potatoes but didn't care too much for it.We finished up our meal with the Banana Tart. It's made with fresh banana slices then caramelized and topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It was soooo good. Highly recommend!Service was top notch. Very friendly and attentive.

It's dimly lit so it's good for privacy, we sat at the corner booth and felt pretty secluded from the other diners. Service was good but i don't hold service to that high of a standard anyway.So far BLT Prime is still my favorite steakhouse.bread: run of the mill stuff, small basket, nothing impressive.appetizers: house bacon - I usually eat pork belly in Vietnamese cooking so I'm fond of it and this was a good preparation. A bit salty for my  palate but that's how it's meant to taste. The cut wasn't as fatty as i assumed which was good.crab cake - I don't know if it's supposed to be that salty, but it was very salty and even more so than the bacon, all i could taste was salt which might have affected my palate when tasting the bacon.entree:20 strip bone-in - i guess this wasn't dried aged so that knocks it down for me. We had 3 of these and there seem to be some cooking inconsistency between the 3 medium rares. Expecting a more tender steak but it was a bit chewy.sides: goose fat potato - good, it's basically chunks of potato shaped into a half sphere and deep fried to get a crispy outside. Not bad for a side.creamed spinach - great tasting with the truffle flavor. I'm loving anything with truffle flavor flavor lately and this didn't disappoint.Brussels sprouts - Cut in halves and roasted. Would have preferred whole roasted as cutting them in half made them soak up alot of the salt and made them a little mushy on the inside for my taste.desert: chocolate brownie with ice cream and fudge poured on top - maybe we should have gotten the chocolate cake.

Rich and full of lobster flavour. My companion had some sort of salad and she said it was good.For the main course we both ordered the 7 ounce ribeye steak and frites (the only steak on the prix fixe menu). Maybe because 7 ounces is a bit too small for a ribeye steak they've decided to cut it very thin. It was a very average tasting piece of meat.

Prepare to pay for the goodness, $100+ pp.The service was impeccable, attentive waiter, water filled at every opportunity. If I were to nitpick over one thing, it would be our location, right next to the kitchen. Constant flow of staff, several times our chairs or table was bumped.On to the food.. Tried two appetizers, the sea scallops and the crabcake. The scallops were excellent, and our waiter split them into separate plates for us, nicely done! The crabcake was a 4 (out of 5). Chose two sides to accompany our steaks, the goose infused potatoes and the creamed spinach. The potatoes were not what I was expecting, least favorite thing we ordered, a 3. The creamed spinach were just about the best I've ever tasted. Great texture, you could tell there was whole leafs in the mix. And to the meat of things, the steaks (one Rib eye, one New York Strip). First, I am not a huge fan of rib eyes, it is usually too fatty for me. But this was a good steak, definitely up there for the cut it is. The strip was phenomenal, buttery and tender with every bite. Definitely try the strip! We finished up with the Striphouse chocolate cake.

Nonetheless, we waited by the bar patiently and had a drink. The seating was my least favorite thing... we were so close to the tables on our sides that it was a bit bothersome but what more can one expect in a small, packed restaurant in the LES. The decor was very nice and type romantic. Dimmed lights, red walls, with a 20's vibe. Now to the food ....We had the oysters which were on their appetizer's special and they were delicious. So fresh and scrumptious. So fresh, in fact, it brought me back to the summer though outside the weather was more like 10 below.For our entree we ordered the porter house (medium) and our sides were the mashed potatoes and the creamed spinach.The steak was amazing!!!

Now onto the good stuff:- Corn Chowder Soup Shooters: these were given to us for FREE. Made with bacon, these shots were fatty and delicious.- Sea Scallops: shared this as our appetizer. Scallops were cooked very well, not rubbery at all. The broth tasted similar to the corn chowder.- Filet Mignon: Cooked very well.- Creamed Spinach: delicious and made with truffles!

We had a great table with a full view of the restaurant, which was great people watching (as per my previous comment on the clientele), the wine list is long, the staff is quick and knowledgeable, and the food is great!  Our waitress recommended a great melot, and was extremely knowledgeable.Absolutely loved the lobster bisque Tom ordered - it was creamy, flavorful, with bits of lobster meat and - best part - a roasted red pepper ravioli in the center, which was blowing my mind it was so good.  Scallops were good too - served with corn and edamame.  The edamame was a nice, unusual accent.  I had a seared tuna dish, which was cooked exactly as I'd asked - didn't love the sauce, though. The sauce matched much better with the filet, which was excellent as well.  Creamed corn on the side (not my pick, but so glad i tried it!) tasted like mac & cheese.The decor is sexy - low lighting, red walls with 20s-themed photography, very nice stemware, etc.  Before we realized, we'd been there for 3 hours.  Definitely a great choice for a special occasion fancy date (it's expensive), to bring clients, or family.",1,0,2,Emily R.,"Manhattan, NY",452,361,4

2.0,12/26/2011,"Eh....so my boyfriend is really into steakhouses, and as a non steak eater, I'm always very hesitant, and am only willing if they serve tuna (which most do, just not well).  We wanted somewhere festive for Christmas Eve, and naturally my boyfriend preferred a steakhouse, so we ended up switching our reservations at Benjamin (due to being super inconvenient from the west village), for Strip House, as we live just a few avenues west of it, and also it had great reviews.They took our reservation for later that night, we arrived late (called to warn them), and had to wait for a table at that point (annoying as they obviously shuttle you to the bar to spend $$ on drinks while waiting, but having been drinking all day, we weren't going to be ordering any cocktails while waiting).  After being seated in the front bar-ish area, our waiter was super friendly, schmoozing with tables, but a nice guy.  To be honest, I thought the ambiance here sucked.  It didn't look ""old New York,"" as other reviews said, but fairly dumpy to me, with subway tile, etc...a very casual ambiance compared to other steakhouses (not that this is a bad thing, but when the prices seem on par with other steakhouses, and I expected my non steak food to be mediocre at best, a nice ambiance would be appreciated).We ordered the bread with gorgonzola, scallops, tuna for my entree with a side of truffle creamed spinach, and boyfriend got the 8 oz filet with a side of garlic fries.  We'd hoped to do the tuna tartare as well which came in an app platter, but they didn't want to risk running out (which was fine).After taking our order, we hardly ever saw our waiter again (well, we saw him schmoozing with other tables right next to us, but never did he really return to ours).  When they brought our entrees they forgot my spinach (which our waiter had raved about), so we asked if it was coming...to which they said yes.  Our waiter FINALLY returned when we were half done, and we mentioned the spinach never came...he somewhat mumbled ""oh they forgot it?""...and wandered off. Never to be seen again until we were long done, and flagged him to finally bring the bill. Super frustrating as he was obviously unconcerned they forgot the spinach, and was ass kissing at the table next to us for ages, yet did nothing to check on the spinach (sounds stupid, but being as the tuna was mediocre as I'd expected, I'd wanted my side).Of course when he brings the bill he's all ""muaha yeah no one makes the leap to dessert, you must be stuffed!"" ....I was even more annoyed as 1) no, I planned to get something else afterwards as not stuffed, nor loved the tuna, and 2) i never even got the side i'd ordered, so even less stuffed, just hate dessert.After my boyfriend made a few more awkward comments about the spinach, he finally seemed to realize ""OH! they hadn't EVER brought it??"" um no, we said that, you repeated that, and then didn't give a shit the remainder of the time we were sitting here.He removed it from the bill, but being as the service ended up sucking, forgot my side that was supposed to be so spectacular, and my boyfriend thought his steak was on par with any random chain in another city, won't be back.  Although I did get to bitch I told you so, I hate steakhouses, didn't want to try it, knew it would go like that for the remainder of the night.  Total bill (no cocktails, tap water) was around $170 with tax tip, so prices seemed on par with other steakhouses (tuna was $33, not worth it, steak $40 something, plus two apps and one side.",3,0,1,Danielle J.,"West Village, Manhattan, NY",213,572,10

Eesh).  Instant turnoff.  But even weirder, and perhaps SCANDALOUS:  A chunk of our cake tasted like cigarettes.  Yes cigarettes.  While we were noting this, we realized that lit birthday candles also kinda taste like cigarettes....so dare I ask: does Striphouse recycle cake?!?!?!?!!?!  Did we get some united part of someone's birthday celebration?As I said, everything here from experience to food was average.  2.5 stars.  I THUSLY round down to 2, given how unimpressive and expensive the meal was.  Whatever, I do what I want.",0,1,0,Josh R.,"New York, NY",3,6,0

In addition, there are many pictures of what I think are old actors and actresses all over their walls. The seating is very tight and crowded. We got this tiny table. Luckily there was only one other couple on one side of us, but if I stretched out my arm, I could literally hit the girl in the face. Having to get up to use the restroom became a balancing act because you didn't want to disturb the table right next to you. The service was excellent. Our glasses were never empty and whenever we would finish our plate, someone would swoop in and take it out of our way quickly. For our appetizer, we decided to order the Strip House Roasted Bacon. This was really good. It was cooked perfectly. Crispy, fatty, and delicious! I tasted Peter Luger's Bacon, but enjoyed Strip House's more. What's also nice is that even though the appetizer comes with 2 strips, since there were 2 of us they cut up each slice and serve it nicely on 2 separate plates with the Arugula and Russian Dressing. Once we finished our appetizers, a waiter brought out a Yellow Tomato Gazpacho, which was compliments of the chef. This was refreshing. We decided to get the Porter House for 2 (cooked Medium) for our main meal with a side of Crisp Goosefat Potatoes. They brought out the full steak when it was finished cooking, just to show us, before cutting it table side and dividing it among the 2 of us. The steak was very juicy and flavorful!  It was also perfectly cooked. We weren't able to finish the meatfest that was going on, but it was really good, a carnivore's dream. The potatoes were a great side. Nothing goes better together than steak and pot! Even though we were stuffed beyond belief, we knew we had to get their famous 24-layer Chocolate Cake, which I had seen on Food Network's ""Best Thing I Ever Ate"". Ever since that episode this was on my list of ""to-try"" desserts. This was a MONSTROUS dessert. It was HUGE! Even when we halved it, each of our pieces could still be considered a cake slice ! It was soo choclatey, rich, and decadent. I wish I was able to have mine with a glass of milk! We had to get the rest of our cake wrapped to go. Luckily I was able to enjoy it with milk the next day!Great steakhouse!",3,2,2,Melissa D.,"Matawan, NJ",403,501,745

1.0,10/13/2011,"It may be long, but worth the read to see what type of people you may deal with at this location. If you choose to still spend your hard earned money to eat there, I hope all goes well and you don't need to speak with anyone in management!  Read on if you're curious!  The bottom line is the steak was pretty good, the sides were not & the service was horrible. Definitely not worth the money.I made a reservation for 4 people at 7pm for my husband's 40th Birthday. We were in NYC for our 1st time for this special occasion & decided to splurge and enjoy a high end, nice dinner.  When I made the reservation I informed her it was my husband's 40th Birthday and asked if they can do anything special.  She said they generally do a slice of their chocolate cake with a candle in it, but my husband could choose any of the desserts & have a candle in it. She then asked if I would like them to write ""Happy Birthday"" on the dessert plate. When I said yes, she then asked if I would like my husband's name written on it as well. I said yes & gave her his name, which she repeated back to me. At the beginning of the dinner, it was mentioned to the waiter that it was my husband's birthday. At the end of the meal my husband looked at the dessert menu & when he was unsure of what to select, the waiter suggested the chocolate cake. My husband agreed & the slice of cake arrived with a candle in it. No writing on the plate, but it did have the candle. Upon receiving our check, I saw a $16 charge for the cake. I asked the waiter about it & explained my call earlier in the day. He said they do not provide complimentary desserts for such occasions & would speak with his manager.  Rasheed then appeared at the table asking what the issue was. I re-explained it & he too said they do not provide any complimentary desserts & said no one works there named Joanne. His tone and body language were unfriendly. I said I might be mistaken on her name, but he could check their roster to see our name/reservation at 7pm to confirm I had called. He went to check on this & came back confirming he did see the reservation. He was very rude & condescending when he said ""So what, you think we should have bought him a cake?""  I said no, but the way it was explained to me gave me the impression it was complimentary as most restaurants do for special occasions. He said ""restaurants in New York don't give free desserts"" in a tone that suggested I should have known this. I told him we are not from New York and were in fact visiting for the 1st time for my husband's birthday. I finally ended up saying ""I can't believe I'm having to have this conversation with you at a restaurant of this level.""  He continued to be confrontational, so I just said ""Never mind, just never mind.""After he walked away, we decided we would not be paying a tip for this meal. Mainly due to Rasheed's behavior, but secondly we were already not impressed with the waiter's treatment either. He kept hovering around our table pressing us to make our order vs. enjoying our time. There were plenty of empty tables, so I'm not sure why he kept applying the pressure to hurry along. Maybe his shift was ending?  Regardless, he wasn't rude but he certainly was not friendly either & seemingly had no personality. I am still SO upset that this is my husband's memory of his 40th birthday dinner. And on top of it the bill for our table was over $300!!  What a major disappointment. So much so, the next night we went to Ruth's Chris for a do-over dinner since I felt so bad.  The service was not only a lot better, but when we asked the waiter to take our group picture for my husband's birthday he gladly did so. At the end of the meal he asked if anyone would like dessert and we said no. When he brought the bill to us, along with it was a plate with a sample size chocolate cheesecake along with a scoop of ice cream, a candle & ""Happy Birthday"" written on the plate!!  The waiter said ""I couldn't let you go without having a little dessert for your birthday.""  We were in complete shock since it wasn't even mentioned/asked for.  NOW THAT IS SERVICE!!!Here's the final kick in the pants of the whole Strip House event....After we paid & left, we were walking down the street to find the subway. Unsure if we were going in the right direction, our friend turned to look behind us & saw manager Rasheed standing out on the sidewalk staring us down as we walked away!!  We realized we were going the right way, but after a little bit our friend turned back around out of curiosity to see if he was still there & sure enough he was still standing on the sidewalk staring at us!  We thought his behavior was SO strange we even joked around that he was probably going to call someone to come out of a dark alley to finish us off!",1,0,0,Nicole M.,"Round Rock, TX",0,8,0

4.0,9/9/2011,"All my husband wanted for his birthday was meat, so steak it was! First, Strip House has late seatings, which accommodated my work schedule AND my husband's meat craving. The steak was great.  And for that alone, Strip House deserves four stars.  We ordered the porterhouse for two and watched the carving tableside.  The steak wasn't overly fatty, had great char, but was perfectly rare inside.  A well-executed steak, for sure.  The sides were good, but we were mostly there for steak.  I will say that the ""chocolate cake for two"" could be for 8 - we've been eating leftovers of the chocolate carcass for days now.The only thing that I was disappointed with was the wine list.  There wasn't a lot of value, but moreover, there weren't a lot of interesting wines.  Just seemed ho-hum.  I wish we could have had an interesting tasty wine with even a semi-reasonable price tag.  It was the only thing about the place that made it feel like a chain.  Additionally, if the restaurant is going to offer late seatings, which we appreciate, there shouldn't be so much pressure to clear the table quickly. We were in an out in slightly over an hour with drinks, apps, dinner and dessert, but the busboy asked us three times if we were finished with entrees and hovered over us, watching like a hawk until my husband finished his last bite of steak, swooping in to clear the table before the fork left his mouth.",1,0,0,Elizabeth B.,"New York, NY",51,414,0

4.0,9/5/2011,"My dining companions declared Strip House's rib eye as the fattiest rib eyes they have had.  I believe them -- that thing was FATTY. The most important items at Strip House --the steaks and seafood entrees -- are solid, so they are already on par with the best steakhouses in the city.  However, what's great about Strip House is that it's the full package. The appetizers and sides are also excellent.  The BACON STRIP was claimed to be better than Luger's bacon, which I understand to be a sacrilege to some.  I cannot compare since I haven't been, but it was damn good.  The JUMBO SCALLOPS were fantastic, they came over a bed of edamame succotash which was delicious and completely sopped up by the group.  The FOIE GRAS was incredibly rich and irresistible.  Great apps make for a happy start to the meal.  Little talking was done at the table once the entrees came out.   All in our table got 1 NY Strip, 3 Rib eyes, and 1 Sesame Crusted Yellow Fin Tuna.  Everything was excellent.  The tuna was perfectly cooked and the crust added great texture.  Sides are worth getting here.  GOOSE FAT POTATOES were very good, but the best part was the crispy outside.  BLACK TRUFFLE CREAMED SPINACH -- yes.  If you like creamed spinach, definitely get this.  It's filling but worth a taste.  The only so-so side was the MUSHROOMS.  They seemed to have just sauteed them in oil with no seasoning.  The 24 layer chocolate cake is a gimmick.  My friends enjoyed it, but I didn't like that it was cold and somewhat dry.  At the end of a satisfying meal, I would skip this dessert, unless you really want to say you ordered the 24 layer cake.  Otherwise there are better dessert out there.  What I didn't appreciate was that our server tried to push us to order 2 table-share sized desserts, when one was clearly more than enough.  I get that the more we order the bigger his tip, but some consideration for our experience and appetites would have made the service excellent instead of just satisfactory.  Also, he hovered awkwardly around our table as we were trying to figure out tip, and even threw in a joke about tipping him more than 20%.  Definitely overstepped boundaries and made us uncomfortable.Besides that hiccup, the whole experience was great.  Strip House is a different kind of steakhouse, it's dimmer and has a very cool atmosphere.  With the classy framed photos of pinup girls lining the walls,  it's the not your average stuffy midtown steakhouse, and provides the full experience of a great meal.",3,1,0,Lu H.,"New York, NY",1218,411,1977

4.0,8/25/2011,"I came here not too long after a meal at BLT Prime (pretty disappointing) to once and for all satisfy my primal craving for meat. Strip House did not disappoint. Firstly, this place is extremely dim. I hope you don't come in here from outside on a sunny afternoon because it will probably take you a good 5-10 minutes to adjust to the lighting. That being said, the corner booth where my party sat was actually well lit and cozy. Caution: you will feel like a mob boss sitting here with the burlesque portraits hanging on the wall, dim lighting, and overall decor. Scallops, foie gras, bacon strip (and bacon strip, and bacon strip, etc...). All so so so delicious. Seriously I would be just as happy with my meal if I only ate these appetizers. STEAK: Bone-in ribeye. Medium rare. Flavorful. Juicy. Fatty. So good. You can't go wrong with a ribeye. Don't be one of those people who order a sirloin strip because it's less fatty. You're at a steak house. Order a fatty steak and enjoy it.Sides: Goose fat potatoes 8/10, truffle creamed spinach 10/10, sauteed mushrooms 5/10, steamed broccoli (it's steamed broccoli...) If you saw pictures of the 24 layer chocolate cake and thought it was huge, you're right, the thing is HUGE. Our waiter was trying to upsell us (party of 4) by telling us we'd probably need a second table-share dessert. Let me tell you, if you and your friends are of average appetites, this thing will be good enough for 6 people, especially after the 10,000 calories you just ate. The cake was pretty good and exceeded expectations given that it was pre-made and chilled in the fridge for however long. It is moist, not too sweet, and as you would expect, very chocolate-y.As I would forewarn diners planning to eat at Strip House, please be courteous to your stomach and fast at least half a day before you go.",2,1,0,Danny W.,"Manhattan, NY",14,61,0

The last time I came here I got the scallops and colorado lamb rack and that was delicious as well. However for first timers, I would recommend the lobster bisque and the strip as I think they are the two best dishes on their menu. For desert,  we got a couple of dishes to share. The creme brulee was perfect - thin crunchy crust on the outside and soft and creamy on the inside. We also got the chocolate cake and it was HUMUNGOUS. I believe it has 13 layers or something obscene like that and its as good a chocolate cake as any. It can easily be shared among 6 people after a big meat heavy dinner so just make sure you have the space in your stomach for it.

2.0,8/19/2011,"Food is absolutely superb. I ordered the 8 oz filet mignon which was cooked to absolute perfection. Often times restaurants simply pop the meat in the broiler, but Strip House seasons their steaks before cooking them...the result is a crisp savory outside paired with a juicy tender inside.The atmosphere is at best, sexy. From the red wall paper to the napkins, the restaurant takes full advantage of the double meaning of its name. Do indulge in the chocolate cake. Believe the hype. The slice is enormous (24 layers!), layered with chocolate ganache and the cake itself is decadent and rich. The bad news? After steak, creamed spinach and mashed potatoes me and my date could not eat it all. The good news? I took it to go and finished it at home with some Turkish coffee....yum. The waitstaff was excellent as well. Lawrence was charming, witty, attentive, and overall a pleasant server. He was well versed when it came to selecting a wine to pair with our steak and I will certainly request him should I dine here again.However  the reason I'm granting this place such a low rating is due to its management. While waiting at the bar for my table, I witnessed the older gentleman who pleasantly greeted us at the door later snap at a member of his staff (threatenting to ""rip her head off"" I kid you not) and later caught the poor girl crying in the bathroom.

They thoroughly and expertly balance the platonic steakhouse and NYC sophistication. I have yet to experience a steakhouse that pulls this off as well. The appetizers are hearty and delicious, yet thoroughly accessible. I thought the sea scallop over corn + edamame succotash was brilliant. The bacon and arugula dish was also off the charts. The apparently obligatory truffle creamed spinach and goose fat fried potato tasted about as delicious as they sound, and then some. The spinach was rich and flavorful but not heavy. The potato crust was crisped to a perfect golden hue and the inside was airy and full of flavor. Our waiter looked and acted like Josh Brolin with white hair - steakhouse gold.But in the meat department, the perfectly cooked steaks were bland and not very memorable. The 20 oz bone-in strip steak arrived on a much-too-large plate with a rosemary flagpole rooted in a decapitated garlic head. The bareness of the plate matched the lack of seasoning. When slathered with Strip House sauce, it was delicious, but it could've have been chicken breast or a pork chop at that point.

I was expecting some old school loungey boudoir where you could still feel the cigarette smoke from hollywood starlets - one that played jazz or music that you'd hear on a victrola . What we got instead was an average restaurant with a bunch of black and whites on the wall, mismatched music (modern day lounge music like you'd find in the meatpacking district),  a dress code that's not adhered to (there dress code is business casual but there were a good amount of people that walked in with shorts, sneakers and backpacks that were actually okayed to eat there) and service that was just ok. In terms of food, the menu was just average as well. There was nothing that really stood out for me (with the exception of their steak) except for maybe the lobster bisque in the appetizer section. Despite the fact that sides at steakhouses such as this are almost always around $10, here they were not worth it. They offered things like steamed broccoli (which I make at home quite frequently for $2), sauteed string beans with garlic (also at home for about $2), herbed french fries and mashed potatoes. All were very standard and all were very boring. As such, my boyfriend and I ended up only getting a filet mignon each and a side of fries. Meh.I do have to say, though, that the filet mignon I had was extremely tasty. It was well seasoned and cooked to perfection. Add the roasted garlic that came on the side of my steak and it was even better.Overall, if I were to come back, it wouldn't be for a special occasion and it would be knowing that I wasn't having anything extraordinary. It was a good steakhouse with good wines (despite their 4x price markup) and that's it. If you know this, you should be pretty pleased. If you expect more though, be prepared to knock your expectations down a few levels. Do this and you're golden.",1,0,0,Nerissa I.,"New York, NY",181,151,121
5.0,7/5/2011,"I had never told anyone to ""shut up"" while I was eating because I needed to revel in the ecstasy of my food. Until now.The Strip House easily has the best steak I've had in years. Served with roasted garlic and a variety of amazing sides, my New York strip steak was mouth-wateringly delicious allllll by itself. I literally have no words to describe it other than perfect. Which is what I told my friend when he tried to distract me from my dinner with his meaningless yapping. The Strip House experience begins when you open the door into a Big Red Room that is reminiscent of the 20s with its plush wallpaper, red leather seats, and black-and-white photos. There are small lampshades on every table sheltering a candle, which adds to the romantic ambiance. The optional sides range from black truffle creamed spinach to green beans to french fries, and everything I tasted was incredible. Literally, everything. Even the appetizers were worth reviewing: we got two specials, oysters on the half-shell and a beautiful salad of yellow and red tomatoes, mozzarella, and a homemade vinaigrette.  We paired our meal with a Spanish red wine, and were both impressed by the expansive (and expensive) wine list. For dessert we tried Baked Alaska, which, amazingly, I had never tried before. Chocolate cake smothered with ice cream, surrounded by a meringue that tastes like toasted marshmallows? Yes please, thank you very much, and may I please come here for dinner every night for the rest of my life????",26,25,22,Ray J.,"Alameda, CA",1137,646,460
1.0,6/22/2011,"This is the first time I've ever felt compelled to write a review for a restaurant so please bare with me. I was so excited to try this place as I've heard from many people that the food and atmosphere were both outstanding. My friends and I arrived there last night for dinner and ordered the seafood plateau appetizer and steaks and sides. One of my friends who doesn't eat seafood mentioned that the waiters were really pushing that seafood sampler and that the seafood was probably about to turn. We wrote him off as just being his normal non-seafood loving self and proceeded to enjoy our meal. We finished the seafood app easily and moved on to the entrees. The steaks were incredibly flavorful, perfectly cooked, and the sides were outstanding. We ordered the white truffle mac, the creamed spinnach, and the goose fat potato, all of which were absolutely delicious. We left the restaurant full and for the most part happy until we each got home. One of our friends got so sick so quickly he we had to stop the cab and let him out. I thought nothing of it and went home. 9 hours later I was still awake having been sick all night. I called my friends in the morning and they had experienced the same thing. The only person who slept soundly was our friend who did not have the seafood. I rated this one star because I would not wish this sickening experience on my worst enemy. It was the sickest I've ever been, and I will not be back because of it. However if you do go there and only get steak + sides, this would have been easily 4 stars.",1,0,0,Jason R.,"Miami, FL",5,11,0
5.0,6/20/2011,"After my last experience, I wasn't sure that there was any possibility of me returning to this restaurant.  However, I was contacted by Penny Glazier of the Glazier Group who apologized for the service we received and invited me to give her restaurant another try.  I decided to take her up on it and invited one of my friends from last time along.The experience was completely different than last time, and much, much better.  TheMaitre d' greeted us and offered to take our jackets and umbrellas (it was pouring out).  The manager showed us to our table, which was probably the best booth in the house, with a view of the entire dining area and away from the kitchen.  He even pulled out the table so that we didn't have to ""shuffle"" into the bench (it's a rounded banquette).  Our server was a really nice woman named Asha (I think I'm spelling that correctly), who started by reviewing the specials of the day and taking our drink orders.We opted for the bacon appetizer this time, which we hadn't had during the previous visit.  The thick cut bacon had a great flavor and a nice crust all around it.  It was delicious and I can see why so many people on Yelp like it.  Definitely something to try when you go.Having eaten a late lunch, I opted for the smaller rib eye.  I think my buddy ordered a filet, but I don't remember.  The steaks came out cooked exactly how we ordered them, rare for me and medium rare for him.  When we ordered the steaks, Asha also let us know that they had several steak sauces to try.  I opted for the Roquefort cheese sauce and my friend ordered the Bearnaise sauce.  The sauces came out in small gravy boats, which was nice because it let us control how much sauce we actually wanted.  Asha also brought out the house peppercorn sauce for us to try, which is a milder form of au poivre.  The steaks were good and the sauces were a nice addition.  We also had the goosefat potatoes and spinach as side dishes.  The goosefat potatoes were good and had a light crust on them as though they may have been deep fried.  The spinach was great and has a strong truffle flavor.  I reduced this a bit by mixing in some of the Roquefort sauce.  While there are some purists out there that insist on eating a steak sans sauce, I must say that the Roquefort sauce was really delicious and although the food didn't need it, I probably tried it on everything just because I liked it.For dessert, I ordered a mint tea and split the creme brulee with my friend.  The creme brulee came with a biscotti and a delicious pineapple topping.  Creme brulee is one of my favorite desserts and I'd probably order this again, although I hear that the chocolate cake is also quite good.Have I been converted? Short answer is yes.  I was impressed that the management of the Strip House actually reads the reviews on Yelp and bothered to contact me.  I spoke with Penny Glazier and voiced the problems that I had with the service and she investigated them and got back to me once she had spoken to the manager who was on duty that day.  Upon our return, the service was far superior and exactly what I'd expect at a restaurant of this caliber.  When leaving, I presented the coat check claim to the manager since the Maitre d' wasn't at the entrance, and he took it and even remembered my name.  That extra little detail really shows how good the service can be.I was wavering between 4 and 5 stars because I still think there are better steaks in the city, but I'm rounding it to a 5 specifically because the manager remembered my name.",3,0,0,Christian D.,"Manhattan, NY",23,11,4

4.0,4/21/2011,"Strip House Steak is two parts classic steakhouse, one part modern chic in Union Square.  The exterior is fairly unassuming, as a non-descript entrance off of 12th St near Union Square.  Once inside, though, you're welcomed by classic red booths, white table cloths, old school Hollywood pictures, and cool funky music.Our reservation was for 7:30pm, but we weren't seated until 8 or 8:15pm.  This normally would have been disappointing, but we weren't in a huge rush and waited at the bar.  Once seated, the service was fast and attentive.Below are the highlights:-Apps:  I started with the ""Bacon"" salad (bacon, arugula, and russian dressing).  Golly, this was a little bit indulgent on my part, but I had read reviews and wanted to try it.  The bacon was thick and flavorful.  Only problem is, they give you ALOT of it and its awfully rich.  By the time I finished, I was starting to get full.  It might be a good option to split among 2 or 3 people, but I wouldn't suggest ordering it if you truly want to savor your steak.  My friend ordered a Caesar salad and it looked fairly traditional.  Either way, I'd suggest ordering a salad or splitting somthing else so you can save your appetite for the main event.-Steak:  My Ribeye was excellent.  Cooked and seasoned just right.  A fairly large 20oz cut.  Nice and juicy.  Next time, I'll likely get the NY Strip.  It looked mighty good and perfectly seasoned from where I was sitting.  They have a few other options and all the standard cuts you would expect at a steakhouse.  They all come with roasted garlic.-Sides: We ordered the goose greese potato and plain broccoli.  The goose greese potato was fair.  It was very rich at times, but it wasn't extraordinary by any means.  We ordered the broccoli for a touch of healthiness and it was standard fare.  Looking back, I would have gotten the french fries instead.  They looked yummy.-Dessert:  They brought us a free slice of chocolate cake for making us wait so long.  The cake was ginormous.  Far too large for 2 people.  It was pretty good, however.  I think we only ate about 1/4 of it.  Thats how big it was.All in all, I'll likely go back to Strip House if I have the hankerin' for a solid steak.  The food was top notch, but not unlike any other top notch steakhouse.  The highlight for me was the cool interior.  Old meets new in an oldschool hollywood setting.",0,0,0,Andy R.,"Houston, TX",159,65,0

As to why, the rest of this is just a few reasons.Dear Strip House Steak House Manager: New York City,I lost my cell phone at your establishment. After our party had generously paid our 21%+ tip on our party's dinner. That easily equaled over $200. Upon leaving, I must have left my cell phone underneath one of your elaborately decorated napkins. I remember returning to pick up the doggy bag that was left by the side of my seat. Two Indian bus boys quickly scurried into the kitchen as I walked closer to the table. They were the same ones that semi-attended us during dinner, the one with medium length hair attending my side of the table. The table was cleared amazingly quick I thought as I made my way back to the coat check. It was semi-chaotic as we decided on rides to our next destination. Upon arriving at our next parking spot, I began searching for my cell phone and did not find it. Oh table napkin, the self-inflicted sleight of hand--darn you. I looked too, back at the stained dirty table cloth at the far side of the restaurant as I put on my coat--as if looking for something. After discovering the phone's disappearance, my friends and I tried calling the phone--it was turned off. Which honestly is kind of funny since I easily had 40- 50% battery life still left after using a certain application. Do phones usually do that? You know, end up on the off function inside your restaurant after 10 or so minutes. Ah geo-location function, I thought you were just used for stalking and what not--if only you worked when the phone is off.Though I am contempt with the situation. I would kindly request that you ask each of your dinner service staff on March 6, 2011 if they have recovered a touch screen cell phone in a blue case 'on accident' as there is a possible likelihood that one of them has. I thank you graciously for your service in that respect and can come by for its recovery if it turns up. I suspended service to the phone minutes after calling your hostess (several times, I hope she had a chance to leave the front desk to look as she was always there to answer when I called).

The goose fat potatoes, creamed spinach, and creamed corn with pance all perfetto.For dessert we went for the baked alaska which is a new addition since last time and it starred.

1.0,2/3/2011,"Overall, I was completely dissatisfied with my dinning experience at Strip House. For starters, when I called to make a reservation, I made it very clear that I needed a reservation for three but  when we arrived they had us down for two. Luckily that issue was resolved and the hostess was able to seat us. Aside from that, the service was very slow and when the waitress did come around, she made several attempts to push the more expensive items on the menu (very annoying). The wait staff also forgot to put bread plates on the table as well as utensils for our guest!The food was alright but lacked flavor and the same goes for the chocolate cake that we had for dessert.Another thing that I found to be bothersome was that the tables in our seating area had glass tops and so when we would cut into our steak, the plates would slide around.  They could definitely use  table clothes or place mats - at least in the front section.The martinis were very good and the bacon was delicious hence the 1 star rating.Honestly, there are way too many great steakhouses in this city and Strip House simply does not provide the service, food quality and attention to detail to justify their prices. I have no problem spending top dollar on a meal but it better be good. If you're looking for a great steak dinner I would recommend Luggers or Wolfgangs.",0,0,0,Lisa A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0
3.0,1/25/2011,"This rating is for the food.  Service was courteous, thoughtful, and speedy as one would expect at a place of this caliber.Having heard lots of fanfare around Strip House, I was eagerly looking forward to it.  The atmosphere is nice, a little more modern than most of the old school houses.   I had the bone-in rib eye.  Perhaps it's a personal decision but I like a bit of firmness with my steak (even at medium rare).  I think the aging process produces a very tender steak but I think this can detract and make a steak not a steak.  To me, I enjoy the chewing process of steak where the flavors are extracted and explode in your mouth.  Follow that up with a nice wine and I'm in heaven. Added to that, there wasn't all that much meat left (for a $45 steak) by the time you carved through the excess fat.  Perhaps another cut would have been better.  I may be back to try another cut eventually...Keens still remains my favorite (the ribeye is huge!) thus far but the hunt continues.",0,0,0,gary b.,"New York, NY",0,21,0

I wont go down the list of competitors and make my bones, suffuced to say Luger's cuts are only marginaly better and the amience, location, service, sides, and wine in strip house vault it above the former winner. Gorgonzola garlic bread is a winner. Call it a cheap filler. It is so damn good. The cuts are prime and cooked to order, really to order. The wine list is definately well priced and has good to great options. They say they have the best creamed spinach in the city, i wont argue, but its up for argument. Damn good tho.

When the waitress led us to our table someone had to physically pull it out so I could get on the inside. The two person tables are extremely close and space is limited. The first half of our dinner was a bit uncomfortable since there was a d-bag and his girlfriend sitting next to us and we could hear every word of their obnoxious conversation.Luckily the food was good enough that I blocked out Mr. & Mrs. D-bag. I ordered the 16 oz. strip steak and hubs got the 20 oz. We were going to each order a side of garlic herb fries but our waitress suggested we only order one since it was large and sized for two. The steak was very well seasoned, just how I like it (I'm not a fan of steakhouses that don't season their meat). We asked for it to be cooked medium rare and it came out a bit too rare, though neither of us minded. The fries were served in a huge metal bowl. I consider myself to be somewhat of a french fry connoisseur and these fries were some of the best I've ever tasted. After dinner I was full but still in the mood for dessert. I got the warm double chocolate brownie and hubs got a huge slice of warm apple pie. I didn't try his pie, but my brownie was amazing. It was warm and gooey and everything a brownie should be.

5.0,1/14/2011,"I was almost embarrassed to tell my wife where I had been last night. Strip house? Isn't that a den of sin?Why yes...if it's the sin of gluttony and one of the best steaks I've had in recent times. Strip House, besides being a play on words (as strip steak is their specialty and the interior suggests houses of ill-repute where another kind of stripping may occur)  is a full service steak house.Bone-in rib eye? Check. Filet mignon? Check. NY Strip, 16 and 20 oz ? Check and char.For it's the char that made this NY strip sizzle and exude a most high deliciousness when entering my watering mouth. No, not the char  that is fish or C++  programming type but the fine grilling that creates an outer layer one must penetrate before revealing the money shot of the meat.Appetizers are an after thought, honestly, with steak this good. But they do add to the overall experience of  gluttony-- potatoes romanoff and green beans with garlic were quite good. (Well, come on, green beans are not why one goes to a steak house.)The potatoes romanoff had a delicious crust of gruyere reminiscent of french onion soup. It's the kind of side that stole too much of my attention from the main attraction. The decor of Strip House is certainly unique. A literal red light district, with red being the dominant color throughout the restaurant. Photos from erotic art purveyor Studio Manasse, a Viennese outfit from the '30's, adorn the walls. (Which makes wonder if the steak house of 2080 will feature continuous feeds from the classics of the early 21st century AVN awards...) Anyway, Strip House delivers superb service, quality steak and an unusual interior. I was too full for dessert!

It was all just... meh.I mean, sure it was fine, I guess, and the bone-in filet mignon that one member of our party ordered was pretty delicious, but everything else was not that great.  The porterhouse was a not cooked consistently (ordered medium-rare, and some parts were completely grey, while other parts were completely red, nothing was pink like medium-rare should be).  The creamed spinach was tasty, but clearly skimped on both the cream and the truffle, the mac and cheese was lusterless, and the chocolate cake was basically frozen right before they gave it to us.Let me put it this way: it's cheaper than Luger's, but the dollar-per-deliciousness value just isn't there.  I think most of the money goes into the overdone decor and not enough into the food.",4,1,1,Dan F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,0

Good space for us.Strip House has a nice niche in that it has a burlesque them,  so it's doesn't have that clubhouse or business-suit appeal that some of the other steakhouses (e.g. Del Frisco's, Smith and Wollensky) have. When you walk in, you think you walked into the Red Light District (actual red lighting inside), but in actuality, it's all tame and harmless. Kitschy! As for what I/we ordered: (1) Bone-in rib-eye: Get it medium or medium rare. Very good and juicy. But I've had better steak at Del Frisco's, Peter Luger, and Quality Meats. (Why I didn't give the place 5 stars.) (2) Creamed spinach: Holy crap! Awesome. I could taste the spinach, but it was all the butter, salt and oil. This is a must-get. (3) Goose fat potatoes: C'mon, how can you go wrong? Yes, more fat on potatoes. Definitely. Just loosen your belt and you'll be set. (4) Strip House Chocolate cake (to share): Okay, I saw pictures of this and wasn't sure how big it was. It was nearly 6 inches high. Damn! And damn good too. I was with 4 guys -and we (maybe) got through half of it. It's a lot of cake; a lot of chocolate.

For my gf i had the chef (I called up before hand to find out if there was anything vegetarian at all) cook up a pasta primavera ($40) it came out with broccoli (almost uncooked) some other veggies (whole string beans, huge baby carrots, etc). It was the saddest excuse for a primavera ever, and I don't hold it against them at all. I'm only upset I dated someone who didn't eat meat, thus the ""ex"" in gf.

3.0,11/14/2010,"Given what I have heard and read about this place I was expecting to try one of the best steakhouses in the city. But to my dismay, I was fairly disappointed.To begin the seating is horrible- you sit elbow to elbow, with absolutely no privacy and the lighting is just plain stupid. The ambiance is just dark and blurry, as if it is filled with smoke. I came here for my birthday hoping the restaurant would live up to its rave reviews. I instead got squished in their horrible seating arrangements, a table that was lopsided and with a waiter who looked like the guy from the Old Spice commercial-I kid you not! I was so close to the people sitting next to me that I could hear the waiter tell the girl to my left that her credit card had been declined and learned that the couple to my right had no idea what filet mignon was.So back to the food- we ordered the table side carving for 2 of the porterhouse 40 oz. steak. We were told by our waiter it would take 30 minutes, which it did not, I felt as if it was a ploy to get us to order appetizers.. not cool.  Everything is a la carte on the menu, so you cannot get the steak for 1 and share etc., - which I wasn't a fan of either. We nibbled on the bread while we waited for about 15 or so minutes. The steak came out semi burnt and we ordered it about medium with some pink on inside. Also, the waiter shows you the steak before he cuts it, and then takes it away somewhere behind you and cuts it (in the dark mind you)- so basically you have no idea if he was able to get all the meat off the bone before plating it - and again, all this is going on in the dark :-/So the steak wasn't the best steak I have had to be honest. I have had better. I felt this steak alone did not taste seasoned enough. I have had steak where itself alone, it tasted great. However, here I found myself swirling pieces of the steak with some mashed potato and steak sauce. The mashed potato (or as it is called on the menu ""Whipped Potato Purée"") was pretty decent. I overheard one of the waitresses stating how they do put about 20+ ingredients into their steak, but I didn't feel like the steak was seasoned at all. In terms of the environment and crowd of this place, I was a little put off by the demographics of the crowd. Much of the crowd was young- in their early 20's and 30's. In my opinion, a good steakhouse appeals and satisfies to the older crowd- it just makes it look more legit.

I shared the special which was a bone in Rib-Eye for 2 for $45/person. MORE than enough meat to be consumed at the table. Thank god for ""to-go"" containers. Honestly, I froze my steak so that I would be able to consume it here in the Bay after the 6 hour flight back home. Can't wait to experience my left over rib-eye. YUM!We asked for medium-rare, but my steak came out a little too rare for me. They were kind enough to throw it back on the grill for a minute to cook it to my liking. Definitely a pricey meal, but well worth it if you're trying to experience the great food NYC has to offer. The only downfall must have been the suggested chocolate cake, a la mode. Our waitress suggested the cake which should have been more moist for the $16 we paid for it......OK, I still ate it =)  Must have been my lack of soberness. Regardless, a great experience.Our party of 6 consumed: 2 orders of bacon, 5 rib-eyes, a petit filet, 3-4 sides, a bottle of wine and 3-4 alcoholic beverages and the chocolate cake.

4.0,11/2/2010,"Came here for a Sunday dinner with some friends.Started with the bacon, which is really more like Canadian bacon than American bacon. It had a nice taste and was not too fat or greasy, with a good char on both sides. The salad that came with it had thousand island dressing. Each order has 4 slices, so don't over order (unless you want to OD on pig). Also got the foie gras which was cold and a too little fatty on the outside. But the toast was crunchy and went well with the foie gras.I ordered the bone in rib eye medium and it was cooked perfectly. The house steak sauce was nice, with a hint of sweetness. The meat itself was well marbled and I ate every single bite of it even though I was very full. For the side dishes, we ordered the black truffle creamed spinach and goose fat potatoes since our meal did not have enough calories. Both were very good. The potatoes were crunchy and fried on the outside but soft on the inside. The spinach was good but I couldn't really taste the truffles in it. On the advice of the waiter we got the brownie which was very sweet and pretty large.The pictures and prints on the walls show women in various stages of undress. Add the red background and it does look like a strip club, with the feel of an old New York steakhouse. The ambiance is great.

The food was decent, the music was interesting sounded like I was in a club lol, when I got there it was empty then it started to fill up around 7pm, looks like its a pretty popular place. The sides were delish, I had the lobster linguine which was really yummy, and the baked Alaska is a great dessert which I've had at a different restaurant. The Truffle Creamed Spinach was pretty tasty and the potatoes were pretty good as well. I don't know if I'd go back and the price for 2 wasn't bad at all.

3.0,10/10/2010,"We came here for my girlfriend's birthday - craving delicious pieces of meats sans the stuffy aura of most high-end Manhattan steak establishments. The food did not disappoint - the steaks were all wonderful, of course, as were the sides we ordered (in particular, the black truffle creamed spinach and goose fat potatoes were both differentiated and scrumptious). We finished with a 17 (or it might have been 22?) layer, extremely decadent chocolate cake, which was mostly impressive because of the sheer number of layers.However, two observations that soured the experience for us (almost down to 2 stars, but as I write this I'm remembering the creamed spinach and feeling altruistic). First off, we had a party of 5 at 8pm, and  arrived punctually. The hostess continually said we would be seated within 10-15 minutes, and she repeated it again and again every 10-15 minutes we asked her. We ended up being seated a little after 9pm. No warning, no condolences, not even a complimentary drink for the birthday girl. They just kept us lingering by the bar for almost an hour. Very frustrating and inconsiderate.Secondly, the place is too dark (especially in the bar area). Understand this is supposed to be part of the charm here, but I actually had difficulty seeing people 5 feet away that I was talking to. Perhaps the old and shady men and women who are trying to disguise what they actually look like benefit from this on the margin, but other people who actually enjoy their sense of vision (like myself) will find it a bit frustrating. It's more well-lit in the actual restaurant, so criticism was exacerbated considerably by our extended wait time.",0,0,0,Nils H.,"Denver, CO",40,188,0

While I was not a huge fan of the decor, too red, too dark and too boudoir-esque for my taste, I was pleased with the sides they had to offer. I am a firm believer that potatoes should always be cooked in goose fat. What is there not to love about a huge portion of crispy goose fat fries? Another standout? The black truffle creamed spinach, arguably the best I've had in the city. And the sauteed mushrooms were great too although if I had to choose two, I'd choose the former two. I shared the porterhouse with my date... okay, I didn't because he was on the phone and I was hungry but it was grilled to perfection. I liked that it didn't come slathered in a sauce and you could actually taste the meat. Hmm... come to think about it, I had the shrimp cocktail as well, but obviously it was forgettable.

5.0,9/13/2010,"Strip House Fever What makes a Steakhouse your dream second home?  Besides great steak, stellar sides and servers that don't walk around with a permanent hunch, I'd say, it's the plush, scandalous décor that the Strip House provides, where eastern, swanky opium den and glamorous old world Hollywood, merge into a boozy, balling, bordello inspired, last meal worthy, Steakhouse that's get you hot just talking about it I took my younger brother to the Strip House to celebrate me finishing my first TV Pilot.  He chose to celebrate this occasion by ordering a Grey Goose and Vodka with extra lime which wrecked any veneer of class or respectability our table had to offer, but it didn't matter, the waiter took care of his thoughtless, immature request with style and ease. There are no old world, older than dirt waiters at this knockout steakhouse, the place is far too hip and sexy for such flat, one note, senior waiters for life. The walls are decorated with stenciled drawings of classical looking cabaret/stripper/opera/sword swallowing, entertainers cut from the sexiest, finest cloth.  Not that you have much time to look at them when your savoring every succulent bite from the roasted slab of bacon in your Bibb Salad that is the thickest, juiciest, most distinguished slab of bacon Bill Clinton could fathom. The leafy, bright greens that accompany the Roasted Slices of perfection are bathed in a dollop of house made Russian that adds a savory creamy blast to an already sublime dish.  The NY Strip Steaks we ordered, had a blue cheese stilton, encased, crust that infused a hit of pungent, creamy goodness that skimmed the steaks surface instead of leaving that never ending blue cheese aftertaste.  The NY strip was more tender than a Filet and less fatty than a Rib Eye without losing its eye popping, holy shit, I can't believe people eat like this on a regular basis sort of flavor. What took the meal to a new level of greatness were the heavenly, gourmet bitch, sides like the Creamed Spinach that's cooked with actual Black Truffles which is like mixing brownies with expensive Kush, the expensive, gourmet green feel penetrates your insides all over like you just ripped a bong hit  from a freshly packed, glass bowl full of, crystal covered Kush.  The baked potato with Goose Fat wedged in the middle put this potato in a class by itself. This potato was a one man show that didn't  need a supporting cast of condiments to lean on. Most steakhouses drop the ball when it comes to offering dynamic, rich tasting, red wines that add complexity, depth and silky smooth sexiness to a meal. I had a Napa Cab for sixteen dollars a glass which isn't a steal but it blew my taste buds away.  I blew a load, my taste buds and kisses to the Sommelier for making such happy ending selection.  Oh, yeah, the crowd at this venerable, Village steakhouse is full of artistic, edgy types, gung ho, muscle bound Chelsea gay types, and old world, Mad Men, gin slamming goy types that haven't aged as well as Don Draper and it was packed at 11 on Thursday Night like any legendary New York house of food worship. As sexy as the place is, the woman dining there, weren't on par with the prime beef on display at this, memorable, stand-out steakhouse that leaves you  with a deeply engrained after glow like you were just lap danced by  the spirit of the saintly looking strippers that grace the scarlet laced walls of this oh my god generating, tender loving, steak house. I'm not in the Hampton's phase of my life yet my one night at the Strip House gave me a taste of what that dream second home can be.

4.0,9/2/2010,"By now you probably know enough about the Strip House that I don't need to go too far into a detailed description of the place. It's dark, it's sexy, it's red. Took a seat at the bar while we waited for our third and ordered an Old Fashioned. Was extremely unimpressed with the drink overall, and the bartender's seemingly little knowledge of the bottles that line the wall behind him. The almost candy-like generic maraschino cherries and dry, flavorless orange peel seemed bad enough, that is until he opened a tupperware container of sugar and carelessly dumped it on top of the already poured drink. That my good sir, is not how you mix an Old Fashioned. The pistachios were tasty though.The three of us were surprised to be seated at such a perfect table in the back of the house, close to the kitchen, a red leather, brass studded curved couch. We have arrived. No complaints about the service, our waiter was nice enough, and quick on his toes if not a little uninformed about the food he was actually serving. I found it surprising that he insisted I order the special of the night, a filet Oscar over the NY strip, isn't that their namesake cut? I obliged anyway.The shrimp cocktail were bigger than my fist, the Caesar salad really nothing to write home about. I love when they make your salad table side, they should do that here. Our steaks came perfectly cooked, two of the filet Oscar, one rib-eye. The meat was well seasoned, extremely flavorful but lacking in juice, dare I say a bit too lean. The jumbo lump crab that studded my meat and Bernaise were both stellar.For sides we went with those we've heard raved about time and time again. Black truffle creamed spinach was fantastic, and served in a tiny copper All-Clad pot, a nice touch. The special side of the night, a truffled mac and cheese was ooey-gooey and creamy with a flaky browned crust on top. The goose-fat potatoes were not at all what I was expecting, instead of your typical steakhouse hash, this thing literally came out looking like a giant, deep fried goose egg. Crunchy, flaky, not too greasy on the outside with a mashed potato filled center.Finished off the meal with an Oban oh wait they were all out, then a Lagavulin, wait out of that too, sorry a Laphroaig neat and asked for some room temperature water on the side. The waiter seemed perplexed by this, ""Is your table water too cold?"" he asked. ""This is good for drinking, but I'd like some room temperature water to add to my scotch."" He nodded his head awkwardly and soon returned with a metal carafe of boiling hot water. I was confused to say the least.I never, ever order dessert for dinner and while Strip House is known for their twenty million layer chocolate cake, my compatriots insisted on ice cream. We went with the profiterole, a towering monstrosity that is made even more absurd when it's placed on the double then doused in hot fudge poured from a foot above the table. The chocolate and hazelnut ice cream inside were absurdly delicious, but the cream puff itself was a bit too hard to my liking.Delicious meal all in all, only regret was that we didn't order the $96 tiered seafood appetizer.",1,1,1,Ben K.,"New York, NY",64,47,27

We got an assortment of warm rolls with a side of butter, and a shot of honeydew juice. Steak is very good. I ordered the 10oz filet mignon, and it was sufficient to fill me up. You can request for sauces on the side like bearnaise etc. but I found the steak to be great on its own. For sides, i think that their creamed spinach is a winner. I'm picky about creamed spinach, and this is just as good as the one served at the Palm, possibly even better. Other yelpers spoke highly of their goose-fat potatoes, but i found them to be just okay. Mushrooms are also average. We could have done without them. Their 10-layer chocolate cake is large enough to be shared by a party of 6. Once again, I requested this since other yelpers had claimed it was ""to die for"".

Thankfully, I was already flying to New York the week after the show aired. The visit to the The Strip House was obviously centered around eating this amazing tour de force of cake, but, it was also delightfully enhanced by the deeelish garlic bread and fondue app...well that, the great service and the fantastic music selection. En Vogue, the Jackson Five, Neyo and SWV were admittedly the last thing I expected to be pumping through the speakers, but after sitting around and soaking up the ambiance it all seemed quite fitting.Now that I am back on the West Coast, a trip to their Las Vegas location is definitely in order to have some more cake!!",2,1,2,ten m.,"Studio City, CA",395,66,104

Strike one.After we all arrived, he put us at a tiny table where all of our arms were touching. Strike two. Fortunately there was no strike three. Since we were eating on the firm CC, I ordered almost the entire menu. The Porterhouse, medium rare was great. It wasn't drowning in butter or anything, you tasted the meat, it was perfectly cooked. The creamed spinach was very good. Buttery, nicely salted. Goose fat fries were okay. Seafood platter was also okay.Garlic bread with the buttery, cheesy dipping sauce was delish. But after spending well over a $1,000 on dinner, we didn't even get a sorry, thank you or goodbye from 5'3 guy. Our servers were very polite however.

3.0,6/7/2010,"3.5 starsIt's a NY institution, and I wonder why I just won't give it another star, but I felt overall the restaurant was just lacking for what it ought to be.  Classic steakhouse dishes, and tasty quality food, but I don't know - I just didn't really feel it.  Fortunately, this was another fabulous JT dinner , so the company was perfect.  The decor is classic NY steakhouse too -- white table cloths, well attired waiters, portraits and artwork (mostly of nudes) all over the walls.  There is a bit of a chattery vibe with all the patrons talking, and lighting could be lower.  Space is way bigger than I expected.We had the cold seafood platter to start, and I found the seafood just to be good - nothing really felt like ""heaven"" in my mouth. Shared a gigantic prime rib that we couldn't finish and had the creamed spinach and the famous crisp goose fat potatoes.  Again - all solid, but I don't know, was it the hype that had me expecting more?I'd come back for a business meal, but wouldn't really do so on my own again.  Great location, obviously, and no surprises.  I guess I just expected more heaven in my mouth - am I becoming jaded??",2,1,3,Joan H.,"New York, NY",213,485,3
3.0,5/27/2010,"Came here with a friend because he had a gift certificate to this steak house.  I'm not going to say the food was horrible, but it's nothing to brag about, especially for the prices.  I would have been more disappointed if I had actually paid for this meal.The decor and service is not nearly as upscale as other steakhouses.  The atmosphere almost felt like something inbetween Mortons and Buca de Beppo, especially with the hundreds of framed black and white photos on the wall.  The tacky decor is what most reminded me of Buca de Beppo, including the furniture. The service was average and the wait staff was not nearly as personable as other steak houses like Le Steak Bistro in the Upper East Side, where the wait staff remembers me every time I go there (and I've only been 3 times!).Lets get to the food.  First off, our first waiter, who for some reason switched after he described the specials, said they had asparagus as a side special, so of course when it came to ordering, our second waiter admitted to not having asparagus for the evening.  I had a NY Strip with a side of sauteed green beans and steamed broccoli.  The steak was a great cut, very lean and little fat, however the cooks over seasoned the steak, which was then burnt in the process of cooking.  I personally really dislike steaks with too much seasoning because it overpowers the taste of the steak.  Steaks have such a great flavor and I usually prefer it with just a little salt and pepper if anything.  I did enjoy the center of the steak where there was less seasoning and where it was cooked perfectly medium.  All in all, the Strip House isn't too much to brag about.  I'd say its on par as far as steaks and service go, but for the prices, I wouldn't say its worth it.  Save your money for the next steak house.",0,0,0,Veronique L.,"Brooklyn, NY",35,109,8

Although they came apologize, however no one really offer me a dry clean service. I am not complaining they didn't give me a free meal but the restaurant really needs to think about how to improve their services when accidents happen like that.

5.0,4/25/2010,"Best steak house I've been to yet. Somehow, they're able to get the most unbelievable crust on the outside of the steak while not upsetting the integrity of the meat. Crisp on the outside, raw on the inside, just how I like it. The lobster bisque was some of the best I've ever had.The 16 oz. strip steak, while not cheap, was worth every penny. Served with a simple roasted garlic head, this steak was outta this world.The ambience is kind of overwhelming. The restaurant was very loud and busy Saturday nite and the waiters were almost a bit too rushed on picking up the plates, etc. However, the food was so good, I can forgive all of that. You must try the creamed spinach- it's sensational. I recommend skipping the herb-garlic fries- as they weren't worth filling up on. The homemade cheesecake can also be skipped- there's too much cinnamon in the crust and it has a weird hard-shell topping. However, you should definitely try the passionfruit sorbet- it's delicious!Overall, an exceptional dinner and definitely worth the money if you want the best steak you've ever had. P.s. Corkage fee on wines is $35 pending it's not on their wine list. Be sure to pay attention to the images on the wallpaper and your napkin ;)",0,1,0,El Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",46,101,49
2.0,4/9/2010,"My boyfriend and I wanted to have a nice dinner on Tuesday night and decided to go to Strip House instead of Butter because I had heard horrible things about Butter and he loves steak.I had been meaning to check out Strip House for a long time because my boyfriend and I are steak people and have previously been to Luger's, Ben & Jack's, Smith & Wollensky, and Craftsteak (those are in order of my preference). We finally decided to go because I'm a big Bruni fan and before he left the Times he said he wished he had gotten over there to review it. Well Sifton, his replacement, just reviewed it and gave it two stars so I thought, why not.I was disappointed. Granted I did not order steak, but I think if I had I would have been even more so. My main problem with Strip House was what you get for your money. The decor was beautiful but the seating arrangements made it so you bump elbows with your neighbors if you are in a couple (bigger parties get the best tables). We actually got to know our neighbors quite well (an older couple who came for the same reasons we did and were just as displeased). My boyfriend enjoyed his ""special"" 14 oz. filet for $50 and said the famous goose fat potatoes were ""ok"" as a side (really just a deep fried mound of very dry mashed potatoes). I was not in the mood for steak so I ordered the lobster bisque and the sea scallops. I will say that the sea scallops were the very best I have ever had, but the bisque was nothing special and I found the weird ""crisp red pepper ravioli"" plunged to the bottom of it very disgusting. We also got a special appetizer from the chef that night of deep fried macaroni. It was chewy and dry. My boyfriend hit the nail on the head by saying we could have gotten the same thing at T.G.I. Fridays so I am glad we did not order that ourselves. The couple next to us said the best part of their meal was the ginormous chocolate cake they got for dessert and their cappuccinos. Again, it was all good, but not for the $100 we spent between us. To top it all of the waiters were extremely rude and pushy to everyone around us. At the end of the meal my credit card was declined and I had to run to the ATM to make sure all was in order. I withdrew the amount in cash and had no problem what so ever. I have no idea what caused the mishap but the waiter was so rude to us the whole meal I wanted to talk to the manager after that. My boyfriend calmed me down and just told me to let it go. We went across the street and got a Toasted Marshmallow Shake from Stand. Honestly it is probably where we should have had dinner.The only reason I would go back is for the scallops, but it is a steak house. So come on.",3,2,1,Jennifer M.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,11,0

3.0,3/11/2010,"I went to the Strip House on a Wednesday night (with reservations for 7:30) for my birthday with my boyfriend and as soon as we showed up at 7 we were seated.  This would have been great, but there were also a lot of people waiting and we requested that we would rather get a drink at the bar and relax a bit, so we would wait.  Instead we were rushed in once we finally got the bartenders attention.     Upon sitting we discussed what we wanted for wine and within 5 to 6 minutes the waiter came over twice asking if we had questions--let me breathe!  We finally placed our wine order in and began looking over the food menu and again the waiter was just rushing us, and because of this I wanted to place our app orders in before our meals so they didn't rush everything out but the guy just waited there until with selected our meals.     We ordered the lobster bisque which was good, but a little too much on the butter side (I only had a few bites) and the garlic bread which was good (they gave us 6 pieces which lasted us through the entire meal).  We couldn't enjoy the time before the meals came because three different waiters came over taking things and moving everything around to prepare for the meals which was kind of annoying when trying to have a conversation.    For meals I got the 10 oz  Filet at medium rare and it was good, but not melt in your mouth good--I don't think it was worth the price.  My bf got the prime rib which was HUGE and was very good--I recommend that.  As for sides we got the crisp duck potatoes---not bad, but nothing to ride home about and the creamed spinach which was Amazing (my bf never had it and wasn't gonna even try it, but ended up eating most of it).   During the meal the waiter did give us a little bit of a break, but once my bf got half way through his steak, me maybe a quarter of the way he began the hassling a bit.  We didn't want to rush our meals, we wanted to enjoy it, enjoy a conversation in between bites just like everyone else around us was.  I was saving half of my steak to bring home but was picking at the sides and bread still when the waiter was ready to wrap things up but I think he got pissed when we ordered another bottle of wine (which this time he poured only twice trying to rush us, once even coming over to pour out more to find we didn't even have the chance to take a sip!)     Meanwhile a couple of young girls sat next to us and had about 3 of the workers come over to their table kissing their asses about every little thing, one even knocked into my boyfriend while he was eating, turned around and looked at him and said NOTHING!     Done with our meal we took a breather to enjoy the wine and my bf had requested cake with a candle when he made the reservations days before so the waiter brought that out.  The chocolate cake was huge and very good, a little dry at times but good still.     I think that the place was a nice setting and cool atmosphere, but that is where the price of the food is doubled compared to the quality of the food.  I had such a great experience at BLT Prime that I guess I expect the same quality of food and service when I go to an equally priced steakhouse.  Overall, services was horrible, food good but not great,  It was an experience but not one I would sit through again.",1,0,0,Andrea F.,"Manhattan, NY",46,38,3

The hostess was pleasant and we were seated in the main dining room past the lounge section. The reviews are right about the close seating arrangements, but there was enough ambient noise so that you could not hear other people's conversations unless you really tried. Its initially a little uncomfortable being so close but its not as noticable once you settle in. The decor is not what you would expect from a steak house. The restaurant is lit in a lush red and the walls are adorned with photos of pin-ups and auto-graphed photos. Our server was at out table within 5 minutes of sitting to take a drink order and answered all of our questions about the menu. We went with the scallops and crab cake for our apps, the 10oz filet and 20 oz bone-in strip steak, and the sorbet for dessert. Our sides were the truffeled spinach, goose fat potatoes, and garlic green beans.The timing in which our food was served was not rushed at all. Our plates were cleared only when we were clearly finished. The crab cake was top-notch and consisted of only lump crab meat and no filler. It was served with a very tasty, some what spicy sauce. The scallop appetizer were two thick sea scallops that were seared just right. The centers were moist, with the surfaces just barely split open from the searing. Our steaks arrived cooked to order (medium rare) and were nice and thick. The filet was more tender but I thought the strip had more of a deep, meaty flavor. Both were good but I would skip the house sauce though.The one side you must order is the truffeled,creamed spinach. I could not get enough because you could really taste the truffles with each bite of the spinach. The goose fat potato was also good cause its first sliced and cooked then formed into a ball that is pan seared then deep fried to produce a crunchy, flavorful shell with a baked potato interior. The green beans were fresh and had a slight crisp to them. Our dessert was a trio of sorbets, and we went with the mango, guava and passion fruit. They had real pieces of fruit in them and it was served in a fortune cookie-esque bowl.The service was truely excellent on a night that was busy. Our server was attentive and friendly. He was also knowledgable and not over bearing. He didn't have an attitude when I chose to have beer instead of wine as one may expect at such places. At any point you could also stop a bus boy if you needed anything as well. Our water glasses were always full, our dinner was not rushed (granted it was at 9), and the food lived up to the hype.

Shrimp to a plate.  Great when you are splitting with 4 people as you can try more things.  We also tried the seared foie gras which was perfectly decadent.  The clams casino, was okay, not what the four of us were expecting, but no complaints as it had bacon which seems to make everyone happy.  Then between the 4 of us we had 2 bone in filets and a porter house. The steaks were all cooked to perfection with a nice seasoning of salt and pepper with a crowd pleasing bit of clarified butter on each steak.  You might have thought we were lions on the plains of the Serengeti which haven't eaten in about a week.  We managed to dispose of every last trace of meat on our dishes and the bones.  The roasted garlic served with each steak was a huge favorite for my fiance.  The sides are pretty awesome at this place.  Some of the best at any new school steak house.  I think I have had most of them, but the two that I always come back for and never seem to get enough of are the truffled cream spinach and the goose fat potatoes.  Ofcourse, as we were there celebrating a birthday, dessert if you can manage to loosen your button on your pants to be able to fit any more food in, by all means is a fantastic way to end the evening.  The chocolate layer cake has always been more of a show piece than the perfect dessert.  It is good, but not always moist, sometimes dry.  But always garnishes a reaction from the crowd.  We also got the caramelized banana tart for the birthday girl.  Then magically out of nowhere we managed to have mentioned how vanilla ice cream would have gone well with the chocolate cake, the waiter recommended caramel ice cream, but I don't remember anyone ordering either, but the vanilla showed up as though it dropped from the sky.  Continued stuffing of the face ensued thanks to the delft waiter delivery of the tasty rich vanilla ice cream.  Well, Strip House, your double entendre of a name is really always a blast, but it is your service and super decadent dinners that make me come back for more.",2,1,3,Caesar R.,"Somerville, MA",915,946,20

4.0,2/1/2010,"Came here with friends to celebrate finishing our first semester of med school. It was a hard semester, so we were ready to let loose a little - so we went with 5 sides, 4 steaks, and 1 bottle of wine for 5 people. Yes, we probably shortened our lifespan by a couple years with all the carcinogens and fat from the steaks and side dishes, but seriously, when you've just had the !@$# tested out of you for a couple months straight, it seems like a nice reward.Our sides were: crisp goose-fat potatoes, black truffle creamed spinach, potato puree, potatoes romanoff, and the creamed corn with pancetta. For steaks, I split the 10 oz filet mignon, cooked medium rare. Everything was great - my favorite sides were the spinach and the potatoes romanoff, and I loved how well seasoned the filet was (not to mention how it literally dissolves on the tongue). Rich, fattening, and totally luxurious - qualities that were definitely reflected in the prices. (The prices totally made sense when considering who else was in the restaurant with us - suits-and-ties who'd just gotten off work and were most likely having ""business dinners"") But was it worth it?

5.0,1/4/2010,"This is my absolute favorite place for a great steak in the city. I've been to many steak houses in the city with my brother (we really love steak), including Craftsteak, Lugers, Sparks (ugh), and Minetta Tavern. This is absolutely my favorite of the bunch. The only place that I've found that serves a better piece of meat is Minetta Tavern, but the rest of the meal at Minetta didn't quite meet the quality of their steak, and it was pretty tough to get a table there, making Strip House top my list.I've been to the Strip House at least a half dozen times, and I've never had a bad meal, or a steak that wasn't perfectly cooked. They have decadent sides to match their phenomenal steaks (the truffle creamed spinach and goose-fat potatoes are an absolute must) and a really solid wine list. The appetizers are also pretty great, including their salads. The decor is unique, if a little dim, but your eyes will quickly adjust and it gives the place a great vibe. The service is outstanding and they have an excellent sommelier.

2.0,12/28/2009,"Went there for dinner last week w/ my girlfriend as an early Christmas gift to ourselves.  The food was very good but I must say the overall experience was lacking.We had a 7pm reservation in the beginning of the week so it wasn't too crowded when we got there.  The decor and aura of the place was pretty cool but very dark.  We checked our coats and were seated w/in 5 minutes.  Once seated the waiter came by and we each ordered a drink to start but said we needed a minute to decide for an appetizer.  It took him 15-20 minutes to come back and when he did he didn't bring our drinks.  He took our first order and said he would be right back with the drinks but we waited for another 10 minutes.I had the crab cake appetizer which was very good when I finally got it.  By the time we apps were finished we already knew what we wanted to eat but listened to the daily specials anyway.  The waiter was interrupted and pulled away from the table before we could order and had to wait again.  When he did come back we were starting to get very hungry again.  My girlfriend and I each ordered our entrees and got 2 sides to split figuring we'd bring the left overs home.  We also ordered another round of drinks.Well the drinks didn't come out until the food did and that took 25 minutes.  In the mean time no one stopped by to ask if we needed anything ( there wasn't even any water left).  When the food did come out we were starving.  I had the special of the night - NY Strip with melted blue cheese and my gf had the filet.  The strip was very good but cooked a little more than I would've liked.  The steak was def medium and I asked for medium-rare but it was still very good nonetheless.  The filet was cooked perfectly and seemed to melt in your mouth.  For sides we had the garlic fries and the black truffle creamed spinach.  The fries were good but the spinach was out of  this world.  We were very satisfied with the food when dinner was over.  For desert we split the double chocolate brownie w/ vanilla ice cream (very traditional and boring but you can't go wrong with it) and each had a cocktail.  They didn't have my favorite scotch, Lagavulin, but was satisffied with a Macallan 18.When we were all finished the waiter brought us the bill right away but then disappeared again.  The manager of the restaurant saw us waiting and came by.  He took my credit card and said he would be right back.  He must have been pulled aside because we were waiting another 15-20 minutes to sign for the bill.  At this point we were laughing because it was getting to be so ridiculous.  The waiter finally came back and we explained what had happened.  He left and was immediately back with the final check.All in all it was extremely good food but lacking service.  We both liked the waiter- he was very nice, personable and extremely knowledgeable.  It mabye just wasn't his night or he was covering for someone in addition to his own section.  For the price we paid for everything (~$250 w/ tip) I expected more.  I would go back to Strip House but only if I wasn't footing the bill.",0,0,0,Patrick C.,"New York, NY",146,37,0

This came to me not pink, but BLOODY and swimming in blood on the plate.  My friend who had ordered the same thing had his medium-well come out well-done!  Seriously?  You're a steak house?Will not be returning.  Save your money and aggrevation and go to Brooklyn over to Peter Luger. ***I'm starting to think Strip House is using its own staff to write raving reviews to bump up its score here.***",2,1,1,Will P.,"New York, NY",7,142,1

Pretty tasty smokey fatty flavor.Kinda disappointed with the steak. 22 oz bone-in ribeye could have been a lot more tender and flavorful and the Stilton cheese sauce and they're house sauce were not exciting at all. I would stick with horseradish. I should have opened the bottle of Peter Luger steak sauce that I bought for 3.95.The truffled creamed spinach side was super tasty and the portions were enough for 2 or 3 because of the richness of this side.

We decide to come in early to get the ball rolling because of all the complains retarded reservation policies. So we got there at 9pm told the hostess our name and what time we had our reservation. She told us it will be 10-15 mins for our table to be ready after about an hour of chatting we ask the hostess what the hell is going on. She again tells us is should be another 5-10 mins they are finishing their drinks. So we decided to buckle down and just wait it out, we finally got a table around 10:40 pissed off the hostess offer everybody a cheap glass of champagne for our troubles. We order quickly hoping to get our food asap because we were all starving by the time we got the table. The service was terrible,missing plates, glass and sliver ware and even all that said the steaks were a big disappointment the only thing good I can say about this place was the sides. Again I have to repeat how terrible the service and I did forgot to mention that the bus boy dropped a piece of bread in one of the glasses of wine we bought took it away and never even came back asking to give her another glass.

Next, we had a caesar salad (split for two) and 4 slices of thick cut bacon split between us.  All of these ingredients were perfect, and the contrast between the still-hot bacon and the still-cold romaine lettuce was fun.Of course, the 14oz filet mignon was the way to go.  I normally get the Porterhouse but there was no Porterhouse-for-1 option.  The steak was pure, tender meat with almost no connective tissue, and it was cooked to a perfect ""rare"".  They have a special side dish right now, black truffle creamed spinach with bacon, so that was a must.  Anything cooked in duck fat has my attention at the moment, so we also went with the Goose Fat Potatoes.The dessert menu looked weak here.  I rarely trust steak houses to have dessert at a quality that matches their steak, so we left and went to Momofuku Milk Bar instead, just a few blocks away.",2,0,3,Chad T.,"Manhattan, NY",52,776,127

YOU MUST try the spinach as the side order, but be careful not to love it too much or you'll have midday fantasies about it. It's creamy and full of flavors, you will not be disappointed (this is coming from a guy who HATES vegetables). The drink menu is A plus gus( lol A plus Gus, shout out to old people for their funny slang).

4.0,8/21/2009,"I went here with some friends and it was delicious. I had the filet mignon and if I remember correctly, my one friend had chicken (it's been awhile since we were there). My steak was perfect, I get mine rare and it was so tender and buttery. We got most of the sides, I like a la carte because it's like family style when you all get to share. The wine was great, the white and red we got. The restaurant is nice and dark with red walls and dim lighting, so it was very intimate, it was also fairly loud. I like that type of atmosphere because you don't have to yell at the people you're with but you also don't feel like everyone can hear your conversation.

Both were totally delicious and were served on their own little plates so they were more important! The ambiance in this place is very cool...lit with red lighting, pictures of people cover the walls, has a great bar where you can order food and eat your dinner(so we did!) and awesome wine selections.I think I am lucky I don't live in NYC, or else I would weigh 300 lbs!!!",1,1,1,Jaymi W.,"San Fernando, CA",422,207,115

It was perfection.20oz. bone in NY strip med-rare was tender and juicy and perfect.Truffled Creamed Spinach was amazing.Goose Fat potatoes were good, not great.Banana tart with ice cream was unspeakably good.I still like the steak at Wolfgang's, but Strip house is the whole package.",1,1,1,Michael S.,"Castro Valley, CA",15,227,22
2.0,7/28/2009,"For the price, you could do much much better. My wife and I recently had dinner here while in New York for her birthday and we were thoroughly unimpressed. Based on the reviews that I read, we we expecting to be blown away. We WERE blown away, but we were blown away by how mediocre and blah our $200 steak dinner was. The atmosphere was DARK and the food was average at best. We had the rib steak which supposed to be the best cut in the house and it was average at best. I have had much better steaks in my back yard in San Diego. Azul in La Jolla BLEW IT OUT OF THE WATER. The meat was fatty and chewy and the goosefat potatoes that we ordered as a side dish were OK. We had a crispy bacon starter which was the highlight of the meal. We finished the meal with a baked alaska, which had to be order an hour in advance, and it was good...not great. I've had better carvel ice cream cakes. Our server was very knowledgeable and attentive, no problem there. I felt a little under dressed in a button up shirt and khaki shorts because everyone there was in a business suit. We had just come from a Letterman taping, so, oh well. I would definitely not dine here again. I would rather get a felafel from a street vendor than waste my money here. For a much better steak try Ruth's Chris or Donovan's.

5.0,7/23/2009,"When I think of steak, of think of Strip House.  Not only does this place serve one of the best cuts of heavenly meat in the city, it also delivers in every other area that most steak houses tend to forget - decor, side dishes, service, atmosphere, desserts.  This place has it all and all at very high standards.  With the deep red walls covered in old Holloywood photos, you feel the intense sexiness evoked from the burlesque dining room.  The Porterhouse is unbelievably savory as is the New York Strip and Rib-eye.  For a healthier cut of meat, the Filet Mignon won't disappoint.  You must order the truffled creamed spinach - it is fantastic!  The mushrooms and mashed potatoes are also a fine dishes.  For dessert, the enormous slice of chocolate cake delivers stupendously and makes for a spectacular end to a grand steak feast!  Great for a date, client dinners, or dinner with the guys - this place has it ALL!",1,1,1,Natalie B.,"Greenwich, CT",26,108,0

Believe their deliciousness is implicit. What else?  Service was very pleasant, my martini was excellent, shrimp cocktail were colossal & so fresh tasting.  Back to the steak.  Maybe I am just a bad steak order.  We were at strip house, so went with the NY Strip.  Was this a bad choice?  Mine was cooked fine, but it was so sinewy/fatty.  I like some fat on my steak as much as the next girl, but this was really gristle.  Like to the point where I was occasionally having to spit steak into my napkin when my dining companion wasn't looking.  Room is fairly odd for an expensive restaurant.  It's so dark that it becomes hard to notice just how jank some of the stuff is - chairs are crap, linoleum floor, cheap-style wall coverings.  But no matter.  Vibe is good, noise level is just boisterous enough for the general spirit of the place.So the steak itself was the low point.  But as previously noted, since steak is not my thing, & since everything else was great, guess it all turned out okay.Also, next time I am going alone to sit at the bar or bringing a girlfriend.  Hot men abound, and not in that typical Uptown steakhouse douchebagery kind of way.",0,0,0,Talia R.,"New York, NY",49,510,0

5.0,5/10/2009,"BEST STEAKHOUSE IN NYC!Well this is the only steakhouse I've been to in NYC, but I did my research and picked Strip House as my one and only steak house to visit while in NYC last month. Boy, was it yummy!My best friend and I made reservations online I believe... and like the yelper below me said... there is a wait! We waited about 20 to 30 mins. But it was worth it. Bread in the basket was ok. My best friend is a huge steak eater, while me on the other hand... steak is not my thing. We had the shrimp scampi to start... I believe we had 4 huge jumbo shrimps. YUMMY! He ordered the steak and I had the fish. We had mushrooms and mash potatoes on the side. Both dishes were lovely. I tried a peice of his steak and must say it was nice and juicy. Love the red/dark lighting. Place was packed... tables/bar full of people. Looked like this was a popular place to come for drinks at the bar. It was an older crowd. Seating is a little tight. We were seated inbetween 2 gay couples that spoke really loud and it was annoying. One of the couple kept on talking about the other gay couple and it was irritating to hear it. People seem to dress up coming here... but I was dressed casual. The chocolate cake dessert looked amazing and it was huge! The people next to us asked us if we wanted a piece because it was to huge for them to finish it all, but I was too full to eat dessert... but it looked delicious. We had the chocolate brownie with ice cream! yummm!So if you don't mind waiting with or without reservations... and don't mind hearing your neighbors conversation... then you won't have a problem. Got here via subway and had no problems finding the place. Not good for kids or family. Maybe better for small groups or couples. This place is on the expensive side, but the food is excellent and the service was great! Totally worth it!I would love to come back here again if I visit NYC.

5.0,4/20/2009,"As far as NY Steak joints are concerned, this is the place to go.  I have eaten here at least 15 times and never once I have been dissapointed.  I do have a few complaints, but they are minor and something that many popular restaurants in NY suffer from.  First, the food and libations:- Drinks -  are excellent here.  They don't have foo-foo drinks, just the typical bar drinks with a good selection of wines and an excellent selection of scotch.- Bread - they bring out an excellent little basket of fresh bread and crackers.  I always eat too much of this becuase I love the onion bread they have.  Take one piece and sent the rest back.- Appetizers - Yes, they joined in on the Peter Luger copying crowd and added the grilled thick cut bacon.  The difference is that they charred the hell out of theirs and its better then Lugers.  There salads are excellent for a steakhouse and easily shared.- Steaks - they do no worng.  If it's on the menu, it's damn good.  They cook them perfectly to your liking and if they are not right they will take them back and cook you a fresh one.  While its always tempting to order the larger steak, i would say go with the smaller one so that you can finish it.- Sides - My god the creamed spinach is divine.  Another awesome artery plugger is the goose fat mashed potatos.  Do not order more then one unless you have three people.- Dessert - if you have room, which i never do, i have no suggestions.  I know I had a dessert once, but blacked out from an overloaded belly and had to be rolled home with no memory of whatever put me over the edge.Ambiance:This place exhudes cool.  There are old black and white nudes from the 50's on the wall.  The red patterned wall, which is the silhouette of naked women also really gives this place an edgy feel.  My complaints:If you make a reservation later in the evening on a weekend there is a good chance you won't get seated until about 15 to 20 minutes until after your reservation time.  They are quite popular these days, in a great and easy location, and as such they are usually slammed.  If you want to be seated on time go on an off night (Monday or Tuesday which is still crowded) or make an early reservation.Otherwise, eat and enjoy!",0,0,0,Ari L.,"Chicago, IL",157,506,153

We walked in, a bunch of 20 somethings, into a place of 30-40-50+ year olds. We had called ahead and asked if there was seating in the dining room, we were told yes, so we went over. Came in, host eyes us warily (we're all dressed fine), and seats us right in front, by the door, in the lounge area. We mentioned we called ahead for dining room seating and that it was available, and in a really asshole-ish type way, he says, ""Who told you that?""He kind of lingers for a moment, deciding to say yes or no, and finally gives us a decent table. Fine, so now we're sitting. Fuck you and your little dog too, host guy. The waiter (who was *awesome*) comes over, gives us our menus and wine list, is all smiles. We start off with the seafood platter for four; it's got crab legs, calamari, oysters, tuna, clams, scallops, and is excellent. Alongside that, we had the foie gras app, which was a little different than some of the foie gras I've eaten in the past. It was a generous portion, but I think I'd skip it next time. Caesar salad looked good, and we're onto the main course.Oh -- the sommelier came over and recommended us two fantastic bottles of wine which went with the dinner very well. Big ups to him. We all ordered the 14 oz filet; I got mine medium. It was mostly excellent, but there were some parts that were just a tad too overcooked on the outside. On the whole, a good steak. Toss in a side of wild mushrooms and I'm happy as a clam. Dinner was $650ish with the wine included, with 20% tip you do the math. Not terrible for NY, or for a steak house.Three stars because the host is a dick, the steak was a little bit off (but definitely good enough to go back for, and probably an anomaly).

My steak was soooo marbled I swear half of it was fats (the other half was the bone). The sides were good though. Stay away from the chocolate cake.

Do not miss the black truffle creamed spinach (sooo good).Other reviewers were not as complimentary of the steak as I was, but I really do think it was very good.Oh and by the way, the chocolate cake is massive and delicious (it should be shared between at least 3 people).I would have considered giving 5 stars, but we waited for an extremely long time, even with reservations. It seems that the tables weren't turning over nearly fast enough. The staff realized that we were becoming upset, and gave us free drinks, so that helped.All in all, I definitely recommend this place.

5.0,2/10/2009,"One word...SEDUCTIVE... I first came to Strip House on a client dinner a few years ago and it has been in my dreams ever since. This is THE best steak restaurant in the city. I can not stand all of those others that cut my meat for me.  I mean come on seriously.  I am not five years old and I think I can use a knife and fork.  There is just something that bothers me about that dining experience.  Strip House does offer that option but you rarely see a table doing such a catastrophe.Sorry for the rant, back to the review, let's get the one negative out of the way first and then we can move on. The seafood tower is not worth it. I don't think it is worth it at any steak house but just to confirm, don't get it. Don't waste the space in you stomach and it is too expensive even on someone else's tab. Appetizers:*Vine Ripened Tomatoes And Red Onion - refreshing, delicious, not tremendously filling, my go to appetizer.*Lump Crab Cake - I am bias since I grew up on the Chesapeake Bay.  I do not think this is a crab cake but most fellow diners enjoy this dish.*Caesar Salad - Just the way I like it.  Fantastic!  Not drenched in dressing, long stalks of romaine, and delicious shaved parmesan.  Mmmm...*Roasted Bacon - I mean this is a NYC steak house regular.  Why can't they make back in the 24 hour diner across the street from your apartment like this?  I would be there every night after I went drinking for a slab of bacon like this!*Jumbo Shrimp - exactly what it says, they are the definition of the oxymoron Jumbo Shrimp!Entrees:*Fish (Tuna and Snapper) - The fish that I have tasted on the menu have been well cooked and very well spiced (not sauced).  If you are dining with someone that does not eat red meat or would like a ""lighter"" meal, the fish is very good.  If I did crave the steak, I would get the fish.*Colorado Lamb Rack - Moist, Juicy, not gamey, not much else to say.  I have tried it, and it is wonderful.*Steak - Let me start like this.  They do not marinate, they do not put butter or oil or any extras on their meat.  When you have a steak from Strip House you have the flavor of the meat with a little salt and pepper.  I will not comment on other restaurants and what they do but let's just say, Strip House does it RIGHT!  With that said, they are known for their strip.  The waiters will say the strip is the best steak they have.  Most people will get the strip.  A cut of meat is a very personal experience and taste.  What I will say is all cuts are extremely tasty.  My favorite is the Filet.  It is tender, juicy, and wonderful experience.  I could put every positive adjective here but you will get bored and not read the rest of my review so I will stop.  I will just repeat, this is the best steak house and the best steak in NYC, hands down!Sides: These are something to share.

4.0,2/9/2009,"A long favorite NYC steak house of mines, but a little disappointed on my last visit.  My friends and I had reservations for 8:30 PM on Saturday.  We were about 10 minutes late, so was expecting probably a short wait.  Come an hour later, we finally got a table.  The hostess was apologetic and bought us around on the house.  We started with the scallops which were pretty decent, though a little pricey since it only came with 2 per order.  For entree,I had the filet migon while my friends had various different cuts.  All our steaks were cooked nicely, however it had a little too much char on the crust (which made the steaks a little too salty).  We had the mushrooms and the goose fat potatoes.  The mushrooms were average, with not too much flavor except saltiness.  The potatoes were rich but very enjoyable.  Given that I've been here numerous times before, this experience was a little disappointing.  Prices are average to above average compared to NYC steakhouses ($44 14oz. filet).  The decor felt more burlesque than restaurant, with black and white nude pictures of women on the walls.  Service was good and attentive.  This would be a good place for a guys night out, and not a date spot.",0,0,0,Wailun C.,"New York, NY",9,56,0

From truffle creamed spinach, to goose fat potatoes, you feel as though they might need to butter you out the door if you actually make it to the end of the meal before passing out! The dark red decor, and the black and white photos of women on the walls create a seductive feel. I don't know if I'll go back unless I'm in the mood for a heart attack. Plus, it feels like a ""mans"" restaurant, not to sound sexist. I was one of three women in the joint.

Friendly, not overbearing, professional, fantastic overall. The food was very good. I have heard great things about this place and I can't complain much. We had the seafood tower which was fresh and fun to eat. The caesar salad is solid. The bread basket was solid too. Then, I had the porterhouse steak for 2. I wanted it medium rare and some parts were med rare, but not all. Some were a bit overdone which is why I am not giving the place 5 stars. The flavors were great and I loved the house made steak sauce! It was tangy and flavorful and different. Now, the sides... the creamed spinach was the best ever. Better than Luger's. The potatoes were also good. But, nothing can beat the spinach. For dessert, we had the cheescake and the 24 layer choc cake. Both (separately) were the size of my head! They were great. WHOA...

2.0,1/13/2009,"I'm calling bullshit on the Strip House.  To echo numerous reviews, this place is overpriced and the meat is just not impressive.  I think they are surviving off of the straws of a reputation from a bygone era or something.  I can't explain it.  To start things off on the wrong foot, we showed up on time for our reservation, but were quickly escorted to the bar with the explanation that our table wasn't ready yet.  Long story short, we weren't seated until 45 minutes after our reservation.  That's just not how you treat customers that are spending this amount of money.  Of course, while we were waiting for our table, we dropped $75 at the bar, and nothing was comped for our troubles.  I firmly believe that this was not an error, but a business model, and for that reason alone I will not return.On top of that, I thought the wine menu was absurdly expensive, with hardly any bottles under $80.  The sides were also skimpy and unimaginative.  Sorry, truffle oil does not cover up mediocre mashed potatoes.  For entrees, we had the ribeye for two and the lamb.  Don't get me wrong, it was good.  But it wasn't worth the expense and hassle.A meal is too precious a thing to waste on an amateur-night experience like Strip House.  Save yourself some frustration and go to Keene's or Peter Luger's.  Seriously.",3,2,2,Max M.,"Brooklyn, NY",21,12,0

1.0,12/10/2008,"Last night was the second time I've been to this place and I just don't get it.  The food was just okay both times and the service was bad last night.Let me just get this out of the way:  The creamed spinach was incredible and the sommelier was friendly and helpful.The food had some misfires, but what caused me to wake up at 5am this morning was the way we were treated by the staff.The oysters ($18 for a half-dozen) were flaccid, small, and tasteless.  The $112 rib-eye for two was raw in the middle.  It was also carved tableside, so the waiter could clearly see that he was serving us raw, not medium-rare, steak.But, again, if the food was the only thing, I wouldn't feel compelled to write this.  (I'd just not go back.)When I checked in, the hostess was clearly displeased that one of our party was going to be fifteen minutes late.  If we had just stalled instead of telling them we knew we were going to be late, maybe none of the rest of it would've happened. We waited on a couch in the lounge area.The hostess approached and asked us if we'd ""like to have our cocktails at a table while we wait[ed].""  I agreed, even though I didn't see the point.  Once we sat down at the table in the bar, menus, wine list, and bread arrived.  They were trying to shift us to the lounge area instead of the dining room.  I did not appreciate the underhanded way the hostess did this.  When I made it clear that our reservations were for the dining room and we weren't going to be strong-armed into the bar, she led us to the worst table in the place, right at the mouth of the dining room, swarmed by wait staff and food runners.  When we left later, there were still better tables sitting empty.  This was dishonest manipulation, and, when I called them on it, pure vindictiveness.I should've gotten the check for our two Manhattans right then and eaten elsewhere.  Instead, I got poorly executed food, an enormous bill, and my foot stepped on three times.",2,0,0,Rich A.,"New York, NY",11,14,0

I started off my meal with the shrimp scampi appetizer special. Large, succulent, tender shrimp in a fantastic butter and herb sauce with crunchy croutons as opposed to the traditional breadcrumb crust. Absolutely delicious! For an entree, I ordered the New York strip steak (On the bone, of course. What kind of steak masochist do you think I am?!) which was tender, flavorful, and seasoned and cooked to perfection. Every bite was a dream. We decided on the black truffle creamed spinach and garlic herb french fries as sides. The spinach was creamy, rich, buttery and flavorful; absolutely fantastic! The crispy, well seasoned fries were literally the best french fries I have ever had in my life with the perfect crisp and fresh potato taste.For dessert we ordered the 24 layer chocolate cake and to our surprise it was the size of my entire head, maybe bigger. I have a pea head. It was rich, moist, chocolaty and decadent; everything you could possibly want in a cake! ( Better make it worth it if you're going to consume all those calories!) The atmosphere:Pictures of old school strippers and celebs on the burgundy walls (tasteful pictures, not floozies mid-spread eagle.). Lighting was perfect and created a very intimate setting.

Ok, on to the main's.....i just can't bring myself to order anything but the Bone-in Ribeye. It was outstanding as usual, and perfectly coooked. Each bite brings a different explosion of flavor.

3.0,9/24/2008,I went to the strip last night for my cousins bday and I ordered the 8 0z filet Mignon($45) and a side of fries ($10). The steak was well cooked and the presentation was nice. The steak was also covered in some kind of rub which I was not crazy about. The roasted garlic was a nice touch and the fries were good. The house steak sauce was also somewhat lacking. I was tempted more then once to stick my steak in the ketchup was generously supplied for my french fries. The wait staff was very helpful bordering obsequious. You definitely got the sense that you were being treated as if you were about to spend a lot of money.  Ambiance was a little stuffy. but overall nothing new.Overall I dont think I would go back.

This dish could've gone wrong in so many ways, but went so right! The Truffle oil to cream to spinach ratio is perfection. The steak here is good and each cut comes with its own bulb of roasted garlic. I wouldn't say the steak is as tender, juicy and delicious as Wolfgang's or Peter Lugar's (No sizzling plate!) but is pretty damn close. My favorite cut here is the bone-in filet mignon.  Beware of the Strip Steak-- it was a bit saltier and much less tender than the Filet.For b-day celebrations, tell the waiter in advance what the birthday person's name is and what dessert you want to order at the end. Your birthday guest will be wow'ed since they bring out your dessert of choice complete with a lit candle and a cute, chocolate ""Happy Birthday [name here]"" message written on the plate. :-) I picked the 12-layer chocolate cake and as the other reviews confirm-- it's gargantuan, moist, and has just the right level of sweetness.As for ambiance, I prefer Strip House over Peter Lugar's and Wolfgang's.

The strong taste of uni gets mellowed out by the steak. You can hardly taste it unless you put a bit of the butter on your mouth. It also taste a bit fishy when you do that.

4.0,5/7/2008,"So Im giggling as Im about to write this review....I have nothing bad to say about this place.  We didnt have a reservation, we hung out on the red couches and sipped glasses of wine while we waited, we werent in a rush.  We got seated after 45 minutes at one of the tables right up front by the bar, again not a bad thing.  We werent on a romantic date, so it was totally fine, and I dont usually care about stuff like that.We had a salad and shared it, then got a steak for 2 (our dog loved us with the bone we brought back), 2 sides....So full but so good.Well this is the best part.  We decided to order the cheesecake, figuring we'd each have a few bites, retire and call it a night.WELL, was I ever wrong.  The cheesecake came out, and I kid you not, it stood off the plate, almost mid chest height on me!  a good 6 inches high atleast!!! It was the tallest, biggest piece of cheesecake Ive ever seen! My boyfriend and I sort of looked at each other like is this a joke and when we realized it wasnt, both broke out in laughter like r u kidding me!!!!! We took a few bites each , not even making a dent and taking the rest home. Needless to say, we had left over cheesecake for like 2 weeks!!! i would defintely go back!!! :)",2,0,2,Julie I.,"Westfield, NJ",5,59,0
3.0,5/7/2008,So I was really psyched to try this place after reading all the amazing reviews.. I ordered-the lobster bisque (did not disappoint)clams casino (too much bacon)ny strip steak (it was okay i guess)filet mignon (not bad)side of black truffled cream spinach (very creamy)i guess the reason I give it 3 stars is I didn't find anything particularly outstanding.. be sure to order your steaks more cooked than you usually do.. we did medium rare and medium .. both came closer to the rare side.. i think i would have preferred to cook steak at home than have it here.. the price was just not worth the food served.,1,0,3,Diane L.,Hong Kong,166,261,408
3.0,5/5/2008,"Good Steak. Bad Service.This past Saturday night, my friends and I had a 9pm reservation for 9 people.  It was a birthday dinner.  Reservation was under the name Casion - pronounced ""Cash-un."" Our entire party arrived by 9:15pm . When we let the hostess know, she advised that we needed to, ""wait just a bit longer."" So... we all grabbed some drinks and sat on the couches by the bar. By 10pm, a waitress comes by with a tray and says: "" 'Cas-E-on' party?""  My reply: ""Yes, it's 'Cash-un'"" She replies quite rudely: ""No, 'Cas-E-on."" My reply: ""NO... it's 'CASH-UN'""  She blankly stares at me for a moment and finally responds with, ""Right. 'Cas-E-on.' We are seating you. Give me your drinks."" My friend, Ms. Casion says: ""Oh, right now?""Waitress: ""Yea, right now. Give me your drinks.""Even though she was beyond rude, we obeyed and gave her our drinks.  The 9 of us then colleceted our belongings and proceeded to the dinning area where we were then stopped by another waiter who said: ""Oh, wait. You can't sit yet. They just ordered desert.....""Seriously?! We had been comfortably AND patiently waiting to be seated for AN HOUR - even though we had a 9pm reservation. Yes, the last of our party arrived 15 minutes late ... but waiting an extra 45 minutes to only be rushed off the couches and made to wait ANOTHER 15 minutes amidst the dining area traffic?? You have got to be kidding... It was now 10:15pm. Another group had taken over our comfy couches and the 9 of us were still standing around like a bunch of lemmings in the middle of traffc.  We were famished. So, of course we decide to complain to the manager in hopes of a free porterhouse... or at least some free sides.  Wishful thinking. Instead, they offered us a complimentary bottle of champagne. We accepted.  Anyway,  eventually we were escorted to our fabulous table. Our fabulous table meant for SIX people! Did I mention that there were 9 people - 4 petite women and 5 larger men, one of which was a GIANT at approx 6'6""! So, we complained. Again. We requested to be seated at a long table which was just being cleaned off, but they needed to ""seat two parties of two."" TWO PARTIES OF TWO?! The whole situation was laughable at this point...  In order to appease us, they offered to give us the adjacent table ... once they finished their meal. We were thankful and didn't give it another thought until we realized that they JUST received their steak! Now it was 10:30 and we were sick of complaining.  We sucked it up  and stayed at our miniature table.  So, to make a long story short - BAD service. Good steak. (Seriously, the steak was delish!)Actually ... very very bad service ...",6,3,5,Lauren T.,"Manhattan, NY",24,18,1
5.0,4/8/2008,"We walked right in and got a table for 4, without reservation, on a Sunday night at 830, which was great for our not-so-great planning ahead skills.  They stop taking reservations at 5pm, so if you don't want to try the show-up-and-hope route, call or use opentable before then.The Classic Chateaubriand -- a filet mignon-like cut from the thick middle part of the tenderloin -- came at a perfect medium rare, and with 6 slabs to split between two of us, we still took 2 pieces home for amazing leftovers.  I think you can only get it for two or more people at $41 each.The spinach with truffle oil is phenomenal (surprise surprise, truffle oil makes something taste good), and the goose fat potatoes are nice if a little inconsistent in flavor, but the fries are boring and disappointing.We only saw the desserts from across the room, but the cheesecake looks immense and fluffy.  I almost want to stop in here sometime late, and see if they'll just serve us dessert.",2,1,2,Chris F.,"Brooklyn, NY",55,246,13
4.0,4/7/2008,"Wow.  So, not accustomed to places like this, and in search of a good steak for out of town visitors, this place was recommended.  And wow - really really good food.  Best spinach I've ever had in my life (add truffle oil to anything, it basically becomes magical in my opinion.)  The goose fat potato was also great but the fries were disappointing.  The filet mignon, when ordered medium-rare, is cool and pink in the center - just as it should be.  Rarer than most steaks I've had, and I always order medium-rare.  I would imagine ordering it rare would result in a rather bloody cut of meat, so do that at your own risk!  Overall, definitely ranks high among  the best steaks I've ever had.Service was super professional and friendly.  Excellent wine list.Two drawbacks.1)  Extremely pricey.  'Nuff said.  2)  The atmosphere is overwhelmingly masculine and old-school.  Overwhelming shades of red and wood and black and white photographs.  I guess I generally prefer my dining atmosphere a bit more modern.  It really looks like a traditional steak house/ boudoir from the 1950's.Note - I had walked by it a million times and never given it a second look because for some reason I just assumed it was a strip club.  I wonder if other people have had this same experience.",3,2,3,anni b.,"Brooklyn, NY",195,353,1
4.0,3/30/2008,"Came to Strip House as an alternative to Peter Luger after having had a really annoying conversation with their reservations guy.  I wasn't familiar with Luger policy of booking 8-10 weeks in advance and the guy was totally condescending!  Well EFF you Peter Lugers, I'll take my anniversary and $250 elsewhere!Anyhow, we made the less offensive trek to Strip House from the UWS and were pleased overall.  The interior is hot...rich red walls covered entirely with black and white photos of old stars and pinups.  We had a reservation at 6pm on a Saturday so the crowd was overwhelmingly 65+, so I felt a little like I was at an early bird special.  As the night progressed a huge mix of people came in...some in sweatshirts, some decked out.   If I come here next time I'm gonna try to make it later...Our waiter was really awesome.  I was afraid at first that we'd get the kind of waitstaff that intuitively knew we were NOT rich and would thus be snooty, but this guy was so friendly and candid.  We had a good five minute conversation about how 2005 was a good year for wine, my bf and I being totally ignorant of this.  The wine list was extensive and VERY pricey...most are in the 100-200 dollar range, but you can find a few for like $60-80.  We ordered a cabernet sauvignon for $63.My boyfriend and I both ordered a 16 oz NY strip, which was delicious.  Not the best steak I've ever had, but certainly the best I've had in a while.  Charred black on the outside and juicy on the inside.  I had the black truffle creamed spinach which was quite possibly better than the steak!  I had no idea spinach could give that kind of pleasure!  BF ordered goose fat potatoes, which were OK, a little bland.  Everything came in huge portions so we were too stuffed to get dessert, but the table next to us ordered a ridiculous 12 layer chocolate cake bigger than my face. I subtracted a star only because the tables were a little close together even by NYC standards.  I'm fine overhearing 4 different tables conversations if I'm paying like $50 for a meal, but when I'm dropping this much money on my meager paralegal salary, I'd like a little more privacy!   However, only the two person tables were like this, so if you go in a larger group you'll get more space.Conclusion: if you want an amazing meal in a fancy but unpretentious place, go to Strip House.",0,0,0,Cersei L.,"San Francisco, CA",16,77,5
5.0,3/18/2008,"my favorite steak house in manhattan.i've had their strip and filet mignon--i might even go as far as saying that their filet mignon is better than their strip (gasp!). it's hard to find a place that does a filet really well. the bunch of roasted garlic that comes alongside the meat is one of those details that leave a really great impression--and it tastes so good with your meat. in terms of the meat itself, strip house really knows how to cook steak. they let the meat speak for itself and they don't overwhelm it with salt, butter or sauces. for sides, definitely go with the highly-buzzed crisp goose fat potatoes (very good and very long-lasting in terms of crispiness, and the flavor is unbeatable for something relatively simple). the black truffle creamed spinach is another side that is common at nice steakhouses. it's a good portion, definitely creamy and heavy though. the garlic herbed french fries are also delicious but take a backseat to the potatoes. sauteed mushrooms are a good balance to all the heaviness of the other dishes, but nothing spectacular. it's a pretty simple side with a clean and no-nonsense approach. and lastly, the creamed corn with pancetta is also delicious.i love the interior--it sets a somewhat 1950s mood and vibe. it's low-key, just dark enough, and the deep ruby-red is a nice, sleek touch. although an after-thought, the food and interior work really well together.",0,0,0,Stella Y.,"Atlanta, GA",124,366,277

Even the apps are great (fantastic heirloom tomatoes when in-season). They also have an extensive (but pricey) wine menu. The only minus I would say is the dessert.

4.0,11/21/2007,"I've eaten here twice and do plan on going back again, however, there are some reservations I have about my experience and should be noted to others.  I think Striphouse does quite a few things very well, unfortunately their steaks are not equally excellent across the board so I find other steakhouses are more consistent and server a better slab.On my last visit, it was spur of the moment and there wasn't a reservation opening till 9 pm on a Thurs.  which was fine, we had 6 and some didn't get off work till then.  Even will our whole party there, we still waited 30-40 min for a table which seems to be standard here when you have a reservation.   The bar area feels crowded, with groups pushed up against each other clamoring for a cocktail or beer and some of the lounge seems to have been converted to tables.  When we sat (both times) the tables are right on top of each other, so when I hear this is intimate, sure if you mean sharing your meal conversations with the tables adjoining yours.  Stick to later evening reservations for more ""intimate"" dinners.The start of many a steak places are the seafood apps and in this case, their Seafood Plateau.  Striphouse does seafood justice, much better than many steakhouses in NY and I loved their offering - lobster, lump blue crab, oysters, jumbo shrimp, clams etc.  I've also enjoyed their lobster bisque and clams casino.  I wasn't as impressed with the oysters and when I asked one of the servers for some vinegar (I like a little red vinegar with shallots on my shucked raw oysters), what I got was a bottle of balsamic vinegar... I've tried the strip, rib eye, fillet and rack of lamb and would have to say the rib eye was their best cut but I still think it's overly peppered.  A good dry aged cut should stand on its own and although the rib eyes tastes excellent to me, some purest will be annoyed by all the pepper on the meat.  The sides are excellent at Strip House, and fully recommend the goose fat potatoes and black truffle creamed spinach.  The sides tend to be priced on par to other steakhouses but served smaller in portion.  You may not mind the extra calories and I can't recall finishing the sides at steakhouses unless they're that good to substitute the meat. Our service was excellent, but in an ordered chaos kind of way.  With all the tables pulled together, the servers and busboys tend to assist each other's tables so we didn't have a point waiter; just shout out to anyone of them for your needs.  I would go back again with out of town friends, business partners etc. but I have other steakhouses I prefer for a personal night out.",1,0,1,Austin V.,"New York, NY",45,378,126

I don't generally consider myself a steak fan.  I'm thinking 40 bux for a big slab of meat that's most likely too dry, more medium than rare, and probably doesn't have much taste.  I could not have been more wrong.  The meat was perfect, not too fat not too lean.  The cooked layer on the outside was just hard enough to contrast the moist interior when you bite through.  The seasoning is fantastically balanced.  I will never look at steak the same way again.The bill eventually came to about 450 for 3 people.  The wine was easily one of the best reds I've had and cost $180, so the meal could've been significantly cheaper.Bottom-line:  probably the best meal I've had for months!  Definitely not cheap, but not any more expensive than other  NYC steak houses.  Worth every single cent.  No review can do it justice, you just have to experience it yourself.",3,1,1,Simon X.,"New York, NY",80,42,2
4.0,9/7/2007,Great atmosphere. The place is decorated like an old bordello/brothel.A very good steak place among many in nyc. The seafood tower was good but I've had better.

3.0,8/18/2007,"I was truly expecting to have the best steak in the city when me and my companions entered Strip House after hearing and reading all the reviews. I must say not one of us left feeling good about ourselves. The steak was not even close to being the best. Our table had a good variety of orders with alll the meats represented. I had the strip of course and I could not wait to cut into the meat. When it came, I cut a piece and tasted one mediocre steak. Our whole table almost at once looked at each other with disapointment. The steaks were either too salty, peppery, charred, or just plain bad. It wasnt just our table either because the table next to us had a woman who was very upset with her filet. Me and my friends have been to almost all the top of the line steakhouses in the tri state area and i must say this place is not one of them. I dont know if we came on a really off day for this place but if we're paying top of the line prices there shoudlnt be any off days.

3.0,7/9/2007,"My brother and I had the urge to eat steak, and considered the likely candidates: The Palm, Keene's, Old Homestead, and decided to try Strip House for the first time.Had a couple of drinks at the bar at the Gotham Bar and Grill (across the street) first. Needless to say, that is one of the most efficient, professional places in the City. Year after year, just the right level of glamour, energy, staffed by consumate professionals. Every time I go there, I wonder why I don't go more often.But I digress. Strip House-skews to a much younger demographic than most steak houses. Staff is competent, young and enthusiastic.We had a very mediocre clams casino, and a much better Ceasar's Salad-great dressing.We both ordered strip steaks medium rare. My brother's was a good looking piece of meat. Mine was very fatty and sinewy. Both had a nice char, and were properly cooked.We ordered their signature sides: goose fat potato and creamed spinache. The potato was interesting, but not something I'd long for. The spinache was good and very, very rich.The restaurant, over all, was good, but nothing I'd rush back to. I have to admit that I think about Spark's, Luger's, the Post House, but I don't think I'd rush back to Strip House.",2,1,2,Richard B.,"San Francisco, CA",63,36,0
5.0,7/3/2007,"""Oh! That's where Carmen Electra is teaching her striptease work out, right?"" NO NO NO NO!! It's only the best steak restaurant you've ever seen! Carnivores far and wide can attest to this place's holy cowness. So can burlesque aficionados. Obviously, there is a double-entente, if you will, when it comes to the restaurant's name. Yes, they have nirvana-esque New York STRIPs, but they also have pictures of rag time STRIPpers all over the restaurant. You see the connection? Cheeky.So we started with seared scallops with an edamame succotash- heavenly! I had the filet because I'm a lady and couldn't possibly attempt to devour an entire NY Strip. But, I emphatically urged my boyfriend to get it so that I could still have most of it anyway. It was a religious experience. My mouth just started watering again at the thought of it. We split the black truffled cream of spinach and the goose fat potatoes. Both were incredibly decadent and fatty and delicious.We didn't even consider dessert, but since we were celebrating a birthday, they brought us a plate lovingly decorated with ""Happy Birthday"" in chocolate letters. I wish I could always right in chocolate letters. Anyway, the plate had their delicious pralines on them with a candle on it. Very cute.I loved every second of my experience here, and I hope to be back.

4.0,6/15/2007,"I've walked by the Strip House for years. It was finally time to confirm that this is in fact a steakhouse and not a place for poll dancing and dollar bills. Alright, of course I know it's a steakhouse but between the name and the mudflap girl images in their logo one might get confused for a moment.I'm going to go right to the most amazing item on the menu - the creamed spinach. I'm adding this to my list of food crack. One mouthful and you'll be watching it carefully as it pases around the table in that little shinny copper pot. Get that back over here NOW so I can have some more!! I had the Chateaubriand (prepared for two). We ordered it medium (out of habit) but the chef did us right and sent it out medium rare which is how it should be.  It was deliciously soft and juicy with a slightly crunchy blackened crust. Add some of the creamed spinach and you'll be in steak heaven. So what is a Chateaubriand exactly? I really didn't know until I looked it up today. Like filet mignon, it comes from the tenderloin area of a cow. Chateaubriand is the whole tenderloin whereas filet mignon is a smaller cut.  This part of a cow is prized because the muscle does very little work and therefore results in a soft and tender texture. Huh - there you have it. (Thanks to Yelper Caroline A. in Chicago  for helping me get this right)The service was excellent. I was called 'Sir' the whole time which normally would feel a bit odd but it felt right here since the restaurant has a private club feel with all the dark red fabric, low lighting and pictures on the walls. The bartender was attentive and made a proper martini. Note: The waiters are well trained in the art of selling but they were never overbearing. Still, if you've had a few cocktails I'm sure they will get their way and you WILL order more than you can eat. There was one major inexcusable issue which I almost forgot to mention since in the end it was handled very well by the staff.We had an 8pm reservation for 10 people. Due to poor planning on their part, they didn't seat us until 9pm because they had to wait for certain tables to clear so they could combine tables for us. The manager and the reception staff were very apologetic but there wasn't much they could do other than yank the lingering dinners from their tables. The manger picked up our bar tab to keep us calm. Good call on his part. The drinks kept us busy and the time passed more quickly. That was the right thing to do and it was all fine in the end.  I had more of an appetite by the time we sat down so I appreciated the meal even more.

Be advised that even if you're on time the hostess will chant ""Tables are leaving... just a few more minutes"" for about 30-40 minutes.The steaks here are why I stopped being a whiny, pasty vegetarian in canvas shoes. They have one of the hottest broilers in the city, so the steak is marvelously seared on the outside. Their seasoning is simple and stellar. You don't need steak sauce. In fact, I curse your steak sauce usage.The appetizers are good but overpriced. We no longer bother with them. Bread basket, appetizers, entree and sides - too much food, unless you're morbidly obese.Speaking of sides: Excellent. Our usuals are Creamed Spinach with Truffle Oil and the deliciously unhealthy Goose Fat Potatoes. Get 'em before our liberty-restricting intrusive City Council bans 'em.Never once made it to dessert. The dessert portions could feed a small nation's sweet tooth.Service is usually quite good. Great wine list. Killer atmosphere. Tight quarters. Moderately noisy.

I tried their house made steak sauce, which was delicious, but the meat definitely did not need any sauce! and don't even get me started on the sides - the creamed spinach with truffles and pancetta creamed corn made my head explode. brain matter was everywhere. goose fat potatoes, while in theory sound like they might be the best food you ever tasted, I didn't enjoy AS much (not to say that it wasnt good!) - mainly because I was kind of expecting mashed potatoes but it's really more like a small mound of hash browns with a hard crust on the outside - but if you're curious about goose fat,  I say go for it! one thing we did not eat but I observed at the next table and felt very envious about was the shrimp cocktail - they were the most monstrously large shrimp I'd ever seen, seriously baby lobsters!!

Yes, it's supposed to be a very tender cut, but the lack of serious marbling always makes it seem less than flavorful to me. The restaurant has very interesting decor and is reminiscent of a bordello with its red walls and pictures of semi-clad women. I had the signature strip steak and was less than enthused. It was kind of tough and not all that flavorful in my opinion. I didn't finish it and it wasn't because I wasn't hungry. In all fairness to the Strip House, my friends enjoyed their steaks much more than I did. I just happen to be a fan of rib-eye and strip doesn't cut it for me, but I had to give it a try.

I had Filet Mignon at both places and both were served similar with wild mushrooms. For healthy reasons I had steamed Broc on the side. The food was good. I asked for the steak to be Medium Rare. It came out Medium Well and at times I felt as though I was eating wood. NOT the way a Fliet should be. At Capital Grille however, When I asked for Medium the waiter asked whether I wanted more well or rare, I said Medium RARE. Well the Filet came out PERFECT with Wild Mushrooms and cippolini onions. I also had steamed asparagus. Also had oysters at both joints. You got more oysters at SH but CG was alot less. I would suggest Capital Grille.
