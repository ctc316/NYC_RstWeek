3.0,4/7/2019,"All the highly reviewed restaurants in the area were fully booked so we ended up here for a Sunday brunch. There were plenty of available tables and we were seated immediately. The ambience is nice for brunch - lots of natural lights, comfy booths in the back, and the bar area has a great design. The decor is confused - lots of rustic elements and a strangely modern painting that was probably meant to be cheeky but fell flat. The service is where this restaurant lost all the stars. We didn't have a designated server. The host who seated us also took our order and all further requests were made through the busboy. The host / server barely knew the menu and was sorely misinformed. We asked if the chicken sandwich was spicy. When he said no, we ordered it for our child. To be fair, the chicken was not spicy... but it was slathered in a spicy cole slaw that made it inedible for her. I asked several questions about items on the food and cocktail menu and the host / server didn't know any of the answers. The food and cocktails were tasty, but the decor and poor service means I will never come back for another meal. A cocktail at the bar, however, would be fine.",0,0,0,Jeanne R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,1
3.0,3/22/2019,I stayed at The W for work so I ate in the Irvington a few times. The menu is classy but limited and they cant do many substitutions. They do have at least one vegetarian option on the breakfast and dinner menu and seem like they can accommodate dietary restrictions. I had a good experience with the waitstaff but generally I found that they weren't very attentive as I often had to physically flag someone down after being ignored for 5-10 minutes.,1,0,0,Jessica C.,"Pacifica, CA",88,580,17
1.0,3/12/2019,I am a long time guest of the W Union Square and the lovely ladies at the front desk gave me a couple of free drink tickets for the lobby bar run by the Irvington restaurant. Imagine my surprise when I realized I had developed super powers and was invisible. Sat waiting for someone to take a drink order for 10 minutes - after zero acknowledgement and being walked past several times by servers who acted like I didn't exist - I gave up and left for my dinner reservation. I stay in Marriott properties over 100 nights per year for the last 10 years - makes me an elite guest with ambassador service - to be ignored by the bar staff. So what I would say is go for the hotel and the amazing location and front desk staff and skip the restaurant and bar - you are in a neighborhood with literally hundreds of options who would love to see you,0,0,0,Patti W.,"Poway, CA",0,13,0

Also.. i been here several times and every single time the same Hispanic hostess has such an attitude on her face.

3.0,8/1/2018,"Hadn't been to this place since it was Olive's years ago. This place has a better vibe, better light & it's more upscale casual. Olive's was a bit stuffy. I'd give the aesthetic here a higher mark than the food, which was fine...but just fine. My husband's Branzini was just OK. Not bad he said, but not great. Small portion for the price. My corn risotto with blueberry and popcorn was odd & interesting, visually funky. I mean I ordered it because it was a weird combo & so no one's to blame but moi. My buratta with peaches was also just OK for the price. I don't mind paying $18 for a really special appetizer but this just wasn't. Hard peaches and the buratta wasn't melt in your mouth soft and creamy deliciousness like some I've had.The service was attentive and friendly w/ out being too much. Ok, let's talk bathroom.

After explaining my food allergies to our server, who was knowledgeable and helpful, my dinner was delivered, it was probably wonderful. I watched it get cold while waiting for my husband's dinner. When his was served, I asked for mine to be reheated. It came back still cold, they only reheated the protein,  all else stone cold. They wanted to reheat a second time, I declined, it would then be overdone. They offered a new dish, but then I and my husband would be eating in shifts. My husband awkwardly ate his dinner while I went hungry. The manager was apologetic and very professional,  but she could not our two dinners on the table at the same time. She tried everything she could, but the problem could not be solved.

4.0,4/30/2018,"I really enjoyed the meal and experience at Irvington!  I came with my parents on a Monday night around 6:45 - it was pretty empty inside.  We ordered a round of cocktails and some wine to start.  I had the GG Manhattan and it was amazing.  As for the food, we shared the burrata (10/10, honestly one of the best I've had, which I did not expect) and the tuna tartare tacos (9/10, so tuna was tender and delicious) to start.  For dinner, my mom got the striped bass - tasted it and it was incredibly flavorful.  My dad and I both got the strip steak, medium rare.  Came our perfectly cooked, and had a delicious chimichurri sauce on top (it was a tad too garlicky for me, but that's just personal preference).  Also came with delicious shishito peppers and roasted potatoes.  YUM!!! 8/10, not the best steak I've ever had, but really flavorful. I also had the barrel aged old fashioned, not quite as good as the Manhattan, but still tasty (and strong).I wasn't too stuffed after dinner, but we ordered dessert, and then became unbearably full.  Got the brownie sundae, but would definitely skip in the future - wasn't that memorable.The atmosphere is so cute in here.  Love the vibe and the decor.  Staff was also very attentive and friendly!  Definitely on the pricey side, but would return here for a nice dinner out with family or friends.",0,0,0,Katie E.,"Manhattan, NY",278,10,5

A couple came after me and they were served first.  I had to ask 3 times for a glass of champagne.  The first time the bartender took my order but I guess he forget to serve me.  Ok... so I ask the other bartender who literally looked at me and said what do you want?  I said I ordered a glass of champagne but clearly the other bartender forgot about me.  Not sure why.  She got my champagne.  He saw but said nothing ok.  Not complaining.  I asked for another glass of champagne.  It never came.  Ok, now I'm annoyed and just want my check.  I waited 15 mins.  I stood up and put on my jacket which got their attention and said can I have my check please.  They took a few minutes to get my card and close me out.  I would like to note that I'm a woman of color.  All other patrons were white.  I'm in a business suit and I was alone.  I'm not sure race played into the way I was treated, but I definitely feel like I was being ignored on purpose.",1,0,0,Nikki S.,"Manhattan, NY",179,20,6

I recommend that you stick to wine, beer or liquor neat. This is located in the W hotel, so you can imagine the prices to be on par with other bars that are in these types of hotels.

1.0,4/3/2018,"I live on 17th and Irving and frequent all the local restaurants in what is my opinion, the best area of Manhattan, and I cannot stress enough the absolute horrible experience my friends and I had at a Saturday brunch at Irvington. We made a reservation for 12:30pm and arrived 15 minutes early. We waited patiently in the front lobby and enjoyed the overall nice ambiance. It was not until 1:00pm that we were seated but as understandable people, we had no problem with the wait. The problems only began after we sat, in that we were put in a back booth that had no lights on, only to wait another 15 minutes to be greeted and asked about water. It was then we noticed how neighboring customers were also waiting to be greeted and for water and knew something was up. After the continuous wait from many customers, I looked for a manager to ask if all was OK and inform him of the lights that were off and see if we can fix the lack of service. This manager was a stocky male with dark hair and tattoos coming from under his rolled up button shirt and he angrily answered that someone will come and help us. After more time and seeing the staff standing around on their phones, including this manager who was also entertaining his friends at the bar, we decided that this place does not deserve our patronage and that their management needs a total re-vamp. Then, -- and I still cannot believe this -- after getting up to leave the restaurant to find a different place for all of us to enjoy our Saturday, I told the manager who was on our way out of the restaurant that this service was unlike any I have ever received and he ROSE HIS HANDS to me calling me a liar in the most aggressive manner any person has ever spoken to me in my life. My heart dropped and I left in an emotional state. My friends, two of which were guys, and I swear that we will never go to this venue and I make sure I tell all of my friends in the city that this place is an absolute NO. Now, I have to walk home everyday and pass this restaurant with fear of the manager working and locking eyes with me, not knowing his mental state. I sincerely wouldn't wish this place on anyone, whether it is just for drinks or a meal, and this man should not be in the service industry, let alone managing, a restaurant within a W hotel, as his incompetence and instability was proven to be a problem effecting the entire business.",0,0,0,Noelle K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,3,0

I was there for a lunch meeting on a weekday and did not feel like they were going to rush us out. Dinner might be more busy.

You would think for a place like this, they would hire top shelf personnel- NOPE! I complained to the hostess when leaving but she was just as young and unseasoned as the bartender.

Wait time for a drink varied but hovered around 10 mins on a night it wasn't overly busy. Drinks were made really well and as expected, they were costly (although surprisingly a Mcallen's 12 on the rocks was $19 with a generous pour). I had a couple of their SPICY PALOMA (casamigos blanco tequila, thai chili aperol, fresh grapefruit juice & grapefruit soda) which set me back $18 each. The crowd was more polished and jovial. I can't comment on the food as we didn't have any. FYI - if you need to use the bathroom be prepared to walk a considerable amount of distance.

Service at the bar and at the table was excellent, I don't understand the service digs.  Great spot.",0,0,0,Logan F.,"Princeton, NJ",0,96,1

I personally think the prices are fair because I appreciate the thought that goes into the preparation of the simple ingredients. FOOD: Eggs Benedict = nothing to write home about.

I want to return for a drink -- the bar is cool -- and I may try another meal there down the line, but there are definitely other places higher up on my list.The restaurant itself is well-decorated and feels classy, and the location is great, right on the corner of 17th and Park Avenue South (on the ground floor of the W Hotel). We had no trouble getting a reservation, and the restaurant was only about half full.The food felt very hit or miss. At our table, we enjoyed the avocado toast, frittata, and the farro bowl (though be warned -- it's a lot of farro). The omelette was nothing special and definitely not worth $19. It took about 35 minutes for all our food to come out, which was a long time despite our large group. They totally messed up the omelette the first time, and when they brought it back the correct way, it was as if the egg, which was flat like a tortilla, had been moved to a new plate with correct ingredients stuffed inside.I'd recommend Irvington for a drink, but if you're looking for a great dining experience, there are many other restaurants in the neighborhood that do a better job.",2,0,1,Katie S.,"New York, NY",280,277,462

The croquettes were a triumph! So creamy on the inside and perfectly breaded on the outside. The tuna tartare tacos were crunchy, savory and fresh.

1.0,7/24/2017,"Ordered a cocktail from ""Joni,"" one of the bartenders, that simply wasn't up to par - sour and uninteresting. When I asked to send it back for another drink, she gave me that certain kind of petulance reserved for the diviest of LES establishments: a good three-count of silence before bitterly and deliberately asked what I'd prefer instead. Another veteran bartender throwing her weight around at her company's expense. Whatever. I let it go and ordered a martini. After making the drink (it was good!), Joni tags out for a break and a taller, seemingly greener bartender with long dark hair steps in. Because of some receipt confusion - I was given an ""amount due"" receipt for my martini with no refund for the previous order I had sent back - I ask the new bartender if I can have a slip showing that I paid, for expense purposes, instead of the one Joni had provided me with. The new bartender then informs me that the receipt on the bar IS the receipt they provide customers. After a decade writing off expenses, I kindly assure her this was most likely not true and definitely not usable for my purposes. She then reluctantly sorts through her receipt stack, plucks a ""paid cash"" receipt off the top (it exists!) and tosses it at me, before snatching the previous receipt off the bar, complaining she ""needs SOMETHING for HER records."" I understand how this could be dismissed as a toxic/paranoid customer's unforgiving assessment of a busy bartender's temporary loss of composure, but trust me when I say I'm pretty damn easy going and this was, in both instances, patently inappropriate service. I felt like I was having a $19 cocktail at a daycare.

1.0,2/6/2017,"This is the worst experience I've ever had in a restaurant before. My boyfriend and I treated like absolute garbage, and I hope someone reads this so they don't experience the same.We came in for dinner before the game last night (Super Bowl Sunday) and had Ashley as our server, all was ok and average. Not the best service, but not the worst. She didn't mess up our drink orders, or our food order which is all we were looking for in this place. We ordered calamari, the squash and mushroom pizza, and then the fried chicken sandwich. Both the calamari and pizza were amazing. When we got to the fried chicken sandwich, something was a little off, it definitely wasn't up to the same standard the other two meals had presented. The meat looked a little dark, but we thought that's just what they were using - dark meat instead of white meat. We each took our second bite, and it was so chewy that it was difficult to swallow. My boyfriend cut into his piece of meat, and it was pink. Raw. Not cooked all the way through at all. But we didn't make a big deal, we just wanted it gone off the table and off our check.We called Ashley, our server, over and she assured us it was cooked due to have they make the meat, and that's just how it was meant to look. However, we asked if she could show it to the chef, and then came back and told us she would be taking it off our check. I instantly feel sick, having just consumed raw meat. And then Ashley proceeds to tell us off, informing us that ""if it looks wrong, you should tell us sooner."" I'm shocked, together we've had about 3 and a half bites and we are being reprimanded for not telling them of their raw food sooner. Then, the manager, Kaley (I think this is her name) comes over, and tells us the same speech. ""This is how it is cooked, it's how it's meant to look."" My boyfriend and I ask for 2 shots of tequila to kill any bacteria we had just consumed from that sandwich. Kaley then also chimes in on the attitude. And brings out check over, full price, sandwich and shots included coming to a total of $138 for 3 drinks, a raw chicken sandwich, and 2 bacteria killing shots to try and savor the calamari and pizza we had before. My boyfriend asks for his card back, and the emended bill, as he would now be paying in cash.Kaley brings back the check, it's $120 - she has taken the sandwich off, but she has run my boyfriend's card, even when he asked her not to. This is against the law in all respects, and I cannot believe she felt she had the right to chose to run his card, when he asked for it back, and wanted to pay with the cash he had. Kaley then tells us to leave the establishment. Before she gets security to kick us out. She stands by our table and watches us pack up our bags. I'm distraught, I feel so embarrassed and humiliated. We were just asked for the raw food we had eaten to be taken off our bill, which they weren't going to because they believed it to be fine, and then when they showed it to the chef they decided to take it off our bill, and then they didn't actually do it, and then they finally did when we pointed it out in the $138 version of the check, and it has turned into a huge thing, and resulted in us being ""kicked out."" So we are out $120, and it isn't even the money that is an issue, it was the way she felt she could treat humans, it was horrible. I have never felt less respected in my life.

2.0,2/4/2017,"Classic hotel restaurant and bar that is featured at the W in the beautiful Union Square area.Unless you're staying here at the W and you have a per diem to use at the hotel for food, I see it as a hard choice to come here, unless you really want to check it out. The bar does look appealing for either a late night stroll in the area or even an happy hour right after work.I was here at the residence over a year ago and picked up a burger for the room. It was a solid burger and the service was a great point considering it is part of a nice hotel and I was a resident at the time.If you must, check it out, the ambiance is pretty and consistent with the signature W overlooking Union Square.",1,0,0,Joseph L.,"New York, NY",860,486,143

While waiting for a table, a few of my friends ordered drinks at the bar. The bartender said to them after looking at their IDs, ""i'm not going to take these away from you, but I'm also not going to serve you."" Um... okay... Their IDs were from Mass and TX, so maybe the guy just wasn't familiar with other states...? He continued to be weird about the whole thing. He talked to his manager and when he fiiiiiinally served my friends, he didn't even apologize. Super weird and waste of time. I think the manager should have at least apologized for him, as my friends waited at the bar for at least 15 minutes.Overall the food was okay.

Then we had to keep asking him to refill our water repeatedly throughout the meal.Finally, the worst part was that it took over half an hour for us to all get our food and it came at different times.

When I still didn't have my meal and everyone else at the table had theirs, the waiter came over and asked us if we needed anything. Yeah...my meal would be great! There was a point where I could see my burger sitting on the counter for the waiter to take over, and I had to get the waiter's attention to get my burger and bring it over to the table!

The food was pretty solid (I'd say 4/5 stars). I ordered a latte and the baked eggs, which came with tomato braised chickpeas, mergeuz, kale, and avocado. The dish was a little bit spicy with the mergeuz (a spicy sausage), but was a good touch with the chickpeas and eggs. The dish came out in a hot skillet and was very satisfying on a cold, long day.The main reason I'm giving this place 3 stars vs 4 is the service is horrible. Our waiter too centuries to take our order (the three of us had to wave him down obnoxiously) - and in the beginning, it wasn't super busy. Then, as the place started to fill up more, our waiter became more negligent. I was running late to another meeting and really wanted our check. We waited around for 15 minutes, and eventually I got so fed up, I just walked up to the waiter to get our check! Super annoying.

They have Liquiteria juice at $10 a pop, but they literally come in the same bottles that you can get for $8 at the actual Liquiteria so it mostly feels like a rippoff, although it is nice to have some juice with the Sunday brunch foods.

4.0,10/1/2016,"Could it be Irvington's proximity to the Union Square's farmer's market, Chef Delgado's hospitality or the open kitchen but I felt I had dinner at a dear friend's home at their beautiful modernly appointed country house. The guests at the W Hotel and all New Yorkers for that matter are fortunate to have Irvington, a couple years on the square replacing Olives but spot on in its execution of fresh, rustic farm-to-table food. We had the following starters, entrees and dessert and each can be savored and appreciated on its own or in the eclectic combination in which we had them.Crispy Muscovy duck bib lettuce cups, black seabass lettuce wraps, spinach and pumpkin flatbread, crispy baby artichokes, charred octopus with legumes, bucatini with lobster and semi freddo.The duck was steak-like in its uniform prime sliced pieces which were generous for the bib lettuce cups in which they were supposed to be wrapped.  If they were described as lettuce wraps on the menu I probably would not have ordered them thinking this would be a version of Peking Duck which it wasn't.  The blueberry ver jus is what attracted us to the duck and it complemented the perfectly roasted pieces.The black seabass taco appetizers are the appropriate sized bites and not overly sauced or spiced.  The tacos were crispy and soft at the same time and if the menu offered entree versions I probably would not have ordered them thinking it would have been the ubiquitous and plebeian fish tacos menu item which they were not.The spinach and pumpkin flatbread, the chef's amuse bouche to us, was savory and satisfying and could possibly be the best flatbread I have ever had.  The bread was thin and had a chewy finish and the textures of sweet pumpkin and spinach were magical.  I regret I gave up that  last piece as I am writing this now!The crispy baby artichokes with shaved percorino was another winner.  The salsa verde gave a tart kick to what would have been a mellow and comforting dish on its own but all together it made you realize the artichokes were probably just picked yesterday at the farm.  The bucatini with lobster, charred corn and cherry tomatoes was pasta with a purpose.  The sweetness from the generous lobster chunks and corn countered the acidity of the tomatoes perfectly and the light creamy sauce integrated the house made bucatini very nicely.  Pasta can be overwhelming sometimes in its abundance and as a backdrop to heavy sauces but in my bowl the bucatini was showcased very delicately and took its turn playing nicely with the other ingredients.My favorite was the charred octopus with legumes which tasted of smoked bacon and what seemed to be lentils.  I couldn't stop eating the tender bites of octopus and could have had an entire platter by myself!  This was not on the menu but was a special offering which should become a permanent item.Chef Delgado says the menu is about to change and I know between lunch, happy hour, brunch and dinner, we will have many opportunities to come back to try his new selections.",1,0,1,Wailana W.,"New York, NY",59,309,1103

However, the minute I sat down at the bar area, I was rudely greeted by one of the Asian female bartenders, who for some reason, was extremely cold to me. Not only did she ignore me for the entire duration of my stay, she was shamelessly flirting with the old white men sitting at the bar in hopes that she could make herself a decent tip that night; pathetic. Luckily for her and the restaurant, there was a kind older blonde haired female bartender who immediately catered to me and brought me my meal and drinks. Upon her recommendation, I got the braised short ribs which she told me would melt in my mouth. It was literally the dryest piece of meat I have ever tasted. The only thing that salvaged it was the brussell sprouts and this cheesy, creamy, asparagus dressing type sauce which lacked in both flavor and character.

It was too late for dinner, so I read over the tapas menu to see what was good. So glad I got the grilled octopus. They are hearty slices paired with celery and sweet potatoes. They use this amazing sauce and dressing to compliment, but not overpower the grilled octopus and sweet potato flavor. It was so good that I had to come back once more before I left. This time, I came earlier enough for dinner. The asparagus is also pretty delicious. If you're a fan of flat bread, give the mushroom one a try. The pasta was a bit heavy for my taste.

The menu is most enticing and I had a hard time choosing from the lunch options. I opted for chicken and chorizo croquettes and a merguez flatbread. Both were really good choices and made me wonder how good the rest of the menu is.

5.0,4/4/2015,"I was passing by and walked in on the spur of the moment for brunch, and I'm so glad I did. This is a terrific place that just opened.1) There are herbs in stone pots for decoration on long wooden tables. I cook often with herbs and saw a plant I've never seen before, and I asked the person standing nearby what kind it was. He said that he had tasted a leaf to try to identify it earlier but did not know either, and he plans to cook with it to see how it tastes in a dish. This person turned out to be the head chef. I appreciated that the chef is a curious person who is so interested in food, he will taste and cook with the decorations for the sake of exploration.2) My absolute favorite part of the meal was the bread, which is a rich brown earthy grain and served with jam that seems to be a dark berry blend made in-house. I'm from Kentucky farm country, and this is the kind of bread our family would make; it's also what someone from Europe would appreciate. 3) The potatoes are seasoned with herbs and taste delicious. It's nice to order basics & have them be different from what you would make at home. 4) The server Elvis will make sure your water glass is never empty, even if the water bottle is on your table. 5) There are high ceilings, wood furniture, and decorations like old-school vintage hard back books, a typewriter, blue and green glass bottles, and bound lavender. Even if this sounds corny, like a NY interior designer trying to imitate a photo of a New England farm interior, it works and has a soothing effect. The tables are spread apart in asymmetrical angles, so you have space and are not sitting cheek by jowl with other patrons. The ceiling is high, and the music is relaxing, not blaringly loud. Mercifully, no TV. 6) Unless money is no object for you, the price range for brunch is ""Special Occasion"" not ""every day wear"", ie two eggs, toast and potatoes cost $18. If you don't eat meat, note that many menu items include meat and will cost the same if you ask for no meat. An omelet with two ingredients & salad on the side is $19. You are paying for the beautiful atmosphere. 7) Victoria the host has a beautiful smile, asks for your full name, and surreptitiously makes notes about your preferences, ie what kind of table you like.8) The latte was lukewarm; if you prefer these kinds of drinks to be very hot, I suggest requesting this with the server when you order.",1,0,0,Eli F.,"Cambridge, MA",3,47,53

I tried the croquettes which just didn't have anything wow about them.  I ordered the cavatelli with the bolognese and it had so much meat in it that it completely took over the pasta, it was a big bowl of stringy meat.   My bowl was half full when I was done. My friends tried the crispy baby artichokes, which they enjoyed and the bucatini which I was jealous of because it really was a nice bowl of pasta. Just felt like a new menu in an old place.

The chef came to the table during our meal (who is so talented), as well as the pastry chef because we loved our dessert so much as well.We started with the lamb tartare. It's served with kettle chips, but goes better with the bread they serve. The flavor of the kettle chips takes away from the flavor of the tartare. But both the kettle chips and tartare are delicious.Then, I ordered the Duck Pot Pie. Woah. Worth it. Order it. It was ridiculously good. It was so filling. Such a generous portion, but every flavor was perfectly put together.Then we had a sorbet sampler. Their pineapple cilantro sorbet was the most unique yet delicious taste to cleanse your pallet.Finally, I had the peanut butter chocolate bar with toasted marshmallow ice cream.
