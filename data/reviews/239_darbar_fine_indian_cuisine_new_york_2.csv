4.0,4/14/2019,Had Indian buffet here and the food was pretty good. They had great service - the waiter was very attentive and always refilled our water when needed and the check came promptly when asked for. Their dessert was some type of flan that tasted a bit like egg custard which was pretty unique to other Indian buffet places ive been to that had rice pudding and other stuff. Would recommend!,1,0,1,Wendy T.,"Queens, NY",368,190,406
2.0,4/8/2019,"Tried Darbar after reading such great reviews. Had a birthday lunch for 4 last week. Let me begin by commenting that the table service was excellent. Everyone was attentive & polite - thank you!The food was ok; I was a bit disappointed because I expected fine dining. We opted out of the buffet as the presentation/choices were not appealing and by 2:30 in the afternoon we weren't sure how long the food had been exposed (the buffet is right by the entrance- everyone that comes in has to pass by the food;some of which is not properly covered).We ordered 3 varieties of bread- Aloo Paratha/potatoes, Cheese Nan, & Nan- The aloo paratha was ok-skimpy on the potato though. The Nans were a little greasy (visible) as was the pastry on the samosasOne person who doesn't care for ginger asked if ginger could be omitted from her order... any selection...the answer was unfortunately not as the spices are pre mixed.  So she ordered Tandori Shrimp. I tasked a shrimp because I noticed her sour facial expression as she ate. I saw why... the spices were overpowering  & salty even for me who loves highly spiced food. But the most disturbing was the fact that the shrimp I tasted had a pungent aftertaste of ammonia which I had experienced before when buying fresh seafood from a well known wholesale place. Not sure if the shrimp were old or it was some kind of preservative. Nevertheless, the waitress was most gracious and canceled the order & replaced it with Chicken 65-spicy deep fried chicken ... except it was covered with sauce! - which was not described on the menu. The chicken was a little dry on the chicken vindaloo even though it was smothered deeply in sauce.All was not lost, the  guest of honor highly enjoyed the Chicken Korma and another enjoyed the Chcken Tikka Masala. The mango and pistachio ice cream was very good.Darbar is ok but I've had much better. It was overpriced for the quality and certainly not  'fine dining' at least in my opinion - sorry.",0,0,0,Carol L.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",0,2,0
5.0,4/5/2019,"We ate here at the end of 2017, and have been meaning to write a review about how wonderful the service was.  Can't remember what we had anymore, but the food was definitely excellent Indian.  What stood out was how much the manager / owner cared about our experience, they served us our food after bringing everything out, and plating / environment was overall quite excellent (lovely without feeling overly formal).",0,0,0,Danna W.,"New York, NY",3,8,6

5.0,3/5/2019,"New favorite Indian place. Grew up in the UK so I fancy myself as someone who knows their stuff. I discovered their shrimp vindaloo first, great flavor and spice with a delish garlic naan to sop up the sauce. Good options too for those that don't like the spice at that level, they'll tailor things, nice friendly staff. I have them dial up the heat on the garlic shrimp bhoona but have that as is and enjoy, superb flavor. So happy this place is around the corner from my office.

5.0,2/13/2019,"One of the best Indian restaurants in NYC. Darbar is conveniently located a short walk from Grand Central. It offers cooked-to-order menu for dinner while buffet style dining for lunch. We have been here a couple of times and the food has been phenomenon for both lunch buffet and a la carte dinner. Very fresh meat and vegetables and generous on spices and seasoning which makes this restaurant really stand out that you don't have to go to Murray Hill for an authentic experience. The weekend lunch buffet is definitely a steal with various meats and vegetable dishes to choose from, fresh oven baked nann are served right out of the oven. I fell in love with their Bindhi Masala AKA okra sautéed with onion in masala sauce  when I had it at lunch buffet and kept ordering it from a la carte. Not many places can get this dish, it so easily gets slimy or not tender but this restaurant really knows how to make this dish perfectly. Even my husband who hates slimy food would enjoy it. Chicken tikka malasa and butter chicken are also fantastic with juicy tandoori oven grilled chicken pieces in rich sauces that is full of spices instead of sugar. We've been fooled so many times at other Indian restaurants in NYC areas that the sauces are too sweet and chefs taking short cuts of throwing uncooked unmarinated chicken breast into tomato soup (I could name quite a few...). This is definitely not the case at Darbar. This restaurant truly lives up to its great reviews and is our go to Indian restaurant near Grand Central.",0,0,0,Ling J.,"New Rochelle, NY",53,58,1

3.0,1/6/2019,"Having been to Darbar many times, I was looking forward to another great experience eating here and enjoying a fun night with friends. I love the food and the ambiance was great.We walked in having made a reservation for 7:30 pm. We were seated and given menus. The ambiance hadn't changed and it was still quiet, warm, and a great place to host conversation. We started with three samosas (not on the menu, but they accommodated our request, which was really wonderful of them). They were delicious, as is the food there. I ordered the saag paneer with chickpeas added so chickpeas and paneer in the saag. Partner ordered the chicken tikka masala and our friend ordered the chef special, which looked like a sort of curry, with a check-in naan. The food was presented gorgeously and the waitress told us to let her know if we'd like more rice, implying that it would be free. Only issue is that they also didn't ask us what spice level we'd like and I LOVE spicy, which was a bummer. Again, wow, the food here continues to be some of the best Indian food. However, when our orders came, mine didn't have the chickpeas. I notified the waitress, and she removed the dish and later came out with a fresh one with the additional chickpeas. Together, it was delicious and I was thrilled. I was less than thrilled when a different waitress asked me if we wanted more rice and we said sure, then she said it would 4-5$. I was very confused as I thought that the rice would be free, and that previously and in every other Indian restaurant I had been to, extra rice was free. She later came back when we decided and gave us free rice, but this whole encounter was very confusing and slightly upsetting. We tried to leave by asking for the check, but I think there was miscommunication or our request was lost because we waited for about 20 minutes for our check. This, in combination with my order mishap, and the rice confusion, had marred the experience. The food though, still great.",1,0,1,Ashley B.,"New York, NY",206,79,27

4.0,11/2/2018,"We had a delicious meal at Darbar last week. We had a weekday dinner for 4. We were seated immediately near the bar and started going over the rather large menu. We had 2 vegans and 2 non vegans in our group and all left satisfied.We had the vegetable samosas and the Manchurian cauliflower for appetizers. Samosa were spot on. The cauliflower was good but the sauce was too sweet. We had the chicken tikka masala and another chicken dish. They were both well seasoned, fresh and tasty. The vegans had an eggplant dish and yellow dal. The dal was good but the eggplant was fantastic. I almost preferred it to my chicken dish. The portions were just right. We finished off our plates, shared a bit, but we were just perfectly topped off. Service was interesting. Our waiter was fantastic. Friendly, patient and he entertained my brother's chatting (he just returned from Delhi and had a million comments.) the other servers were rushed, somewhat dismissive and not too friendly. We sat downstairs near the entrance. We smelled a pervasive cigarette smoke smell throughout our meal. Never figured out where it comes from but we definitely smelled it and it was annoying.

They had the classics - naan, chicken tikka masala/butter chicken, saag paneer - but also a lot of interesting dishes - fish curry, goat curry, and a flan. Everything was fantastic.

And this was horrible and definitely not at all worth $14.95. The food was spicy and tasteless. I don't know how is their a la carte as I have always been having lunch buffet in the past. It used to be favorite lunch place when I worked in a near by bank but that was 3-4 years back. Lately their buffet quality has gone down. Only thing I liked was their Naan bread. If that is what you want to have in buffet with maybe a mint chutney or raita or mango chutney then go ahead and spend 14.95 else you are better off enjoying the halal cart street food for $6 or some other Indian restaurants in the vicinity.",0,0,0,S.

And twenty minutes to get water after asking. Everything was extremely slow to arrive and the venue just felt cheap. I noticed a lot of Indian families eating there so perhaps the food is pretty authentic. But the Indian family sitting next to us was treated like royalty: kept getting their beer glasses and water refilled while my mother and I just were ignored. Not cool. The food was average; certainly nothing to write home about, but decent. We shared the chicken tiki masala and lamb saag. I like spicy so it made me happy. They should have specified the spice levels or at least asked how much spice we wanted. But they never asked us how the food was or if we needed anything. I asked for the bill and that never came. I had to ask again and the server said ""he didn't bring it because he thought we wanted to chat."" Huh?  Yes we are chatting while we wait, but really I just want to get the beep outta here!

Also, happy hour until 8? Totes bomb. For our meals we ordered the Aloo Gobi and the Saag Paneer, which were by far the best cooked of each dish we've ever had. For $14 bucks nonetheless!

He tried to make both of us feel better by saying that the squeaking we had heard was an air conditioner or something. But the next few minutes of prolonged squeaking made it clear that it was not in fact an air conditioner. When our waiter came by to clear our plates, we told him about the squeaking. We told him as an FYI because we assumed someone would want to take care of it. Unfortunately, not only was he completely unsurprised, he said ""there's nothing scary back there"" and then basically ignored us as we pushed him on it. He was not apologetic in the least. There was no acknowledgement by anyone in any managerial or supervisory role of our complaint. I will not be returning to this place.",1,0,0,Saraa B.,"Boston, MA",0,14,0
4.0,6/21/2018,Amazing Indian cuisine at a great price.Service was on point in here. There was some miscommunication with one of the items we had ordered and they were nice enough to send us the corrected dish.  Throughout the dinner the waiter kept asking if we were ok and checking up on us but not in the annoying way. Everything was delicious. I can't wait to come back.,1,1,1,Patricia N.,"New York, NY",216,243,463

5.0,6/7/2018,Was staying at Hilton UN Millennium and this was close by. Excellent and very conscientious service. Favorite thing is the spice level is right on with a perfect amount of heat (I requested spicy). Chicken tikka masala was spot on and perfect for dipping with garlic naan; I also tried the Lamb Bhuma (listed as as a speciality) and like others found it enjoyable. They also have a great price fix menu for dinner that has all the major popular dishes which is what brought me back for more.,1,0,0,Jason S.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,32,3

4.0,5/15/2018,this review is for delivery. great chicken tikka masala that hits the spot. it was the right amount of spicy but if you don't want it to be Im sure you could specify. I also like that the default basmati rice that comes with the entree contains peas. I ordered their samosas and veggie biryani and thought those were great and generous portion sizes too. On balance I think the food could be less salty but it hits my indian food craving perfectly.,1,0,0,Jack N.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,9,0

4.0,2/2/2018,"First time trying Darbar with my team and manager for their Lunch Buffet Special $14.95 per person. It was pretty packed downstairs so the hostess seated the 7 of us at a table with our own little corner. One of my colleagues didn't get the buffet but he ordered the Tandoori Salmon Tikka from the dinner menu. He specifically told the server that he wanted the salmon plain with no spices. Unfortunately, the portion size was small and way too many spices coated on the salmon...I didn't get a picture btw! My colleague mentioned the salmon was dried and way too spicy for his palate so he had the staff take the plate away. I feel bad that we were all enjoying our plates from the buffet.I did like a few dishes such as Mixed Pakora (reminds me of Popcorn Chicken because of the deep fried battered), Basmati Rice with peas, Chicken Tikka Masala (my go-to), goat curry (needs a bit more seasoning), Paneer (Ooo yummy love that they fried the cheese and tossed into this sauce), and Kadai (peas and broccoli). Ooo we got two baskets of Naan bread...I do love bread! Man the food left me in a major food coma #itismode!Holy moly soda was $3 a glass...they should include beverages in the buffet special with unlimited refills...just saying you know. At first, the server charged my colleague $22 for his salmon but my colleague told the server to minus the salmon because he really didn't enjoy it which was nice of them. Actually, I noticed that Darbar is on the same block as my other two favorites Udon West and Joy Curry.",13,7,10,Anna H.,"Queens, NY",248,805,10791

The restaurant was beautiful, super clean, an overall very fine decor. We were seated at a table and our waiter still offered us the happy hour bar prices which was super nice. I had a couple glasses of red wine which were so decadent and full bodied. I loved it. My friend had the white which he couldn't get enough of. We started off with the chicken 65 which was so good that I honestly could have licked the plate clean. Then for dinner he had the chicken masala and i had the butter chicken, to which we both added spice. BAD IDEA (But it was so damn good). I'm a heat fanatic so I was sure this would be right up my alley but they sure humbled me completely.

4.0,11/11/2017,"Came here for lunch on a Friday afternoon, and they were able to accommodate my group of 8 without a reservation. The interior is classy, warm and well decorated. We decided to try the lunch buffet because they had close to 8-10 different entrees (including several vegetarian entrees,) rice, naan and 2 desserts for $15/person. The food was good, not the best Indian I've ever had not definitely not the worst. Service was good but not over bearing. The waiters set you up w water and come by to refill it, and then you're basically on your own with grabbing food. Food:Paneer Pasanda - great flavor, right amount of spice, could be a thicker gravy though.Palak Channa - could use more spice, but fresh Mango mousse- amazing! Light, sweet and tasted just like a thick mango lassi Sooji Ka halwa- a porridge like dessert made from a grain.

After the walkthrough at the venue, we discussed exactly what needed to be rented and what his staff would bring, and I was so glad to have a caterer who valued attention to detail as much I do. On the day, the staff arrived on time and set up promptly. They were very polite, attentive and very efficient. They are clearly experienced and provided wonderful service.

I have an adventurous palate when it comes to Indian food but I chose the butter chicken because I was in the mood for creamy tomato spicy noms. It had just enough heat to be sexy and the spices were a subtle glide on the tongue, riding along the creamy rich sauce. The rice was sweet and fragrant with hints of orange rind..oh my. The Naan was excellent and I used it to mop up every last drop of the sauce.  They have an extensive menu and a lovely libations menu. I was tempted by some of the creative cocktail creations but ended up ordering a crispy Pinot Grigio. I finished off my meal with some rice pudding  which once again was superbly spiced with lovely hints of cardamom and orange rind.  The service was impeccable. The waitstaff was attentive but not obtrusive.  I could tell that they try their best to give first class service and to meet the needs of their guests. Our waiter noticed that I fanned myself with my napkin and he asked if I was too warm. He set up a pillar fan and directed it at our table. I was appreciative. I also appreciated their attention to our water glasses.  When our rice bowl was empty someone immediately appeared to see if we wanted more.

We both checked in on Yelp for the free naan bread, and I asked the waiter if it applied for garlic naan. Initially he said no, but when our food came out he brought us a garlic naan anyway! So nice of him!! I love garlic!I ordered the Chicken La Jawab, and my friend got the Chicken Mirch Bhuna. The La Jawab was well spiced and very tasty. Mirch Bhuna was a bit spicy but not too overwhelming--might get that one for myself next time, as I felt the La Jawab needed more of a kick! Portions were perfect--with the two naans plus the entrees and the rice that came with the entrees, we were nicely stuffed afterward but not feeling like we'd explode.

Husband's house special shrimp and my mango chicken were both uncomfortably hot for us. But then the waiter stepped in, whisked away both dishes and brought them back much milder.   Rice with mushrooms and peas and naan bread completed our meal.

I had no problem with it BUT when he brought the food, he gave us a beautiful GARLIC NAAN!!! That was extremely nice!!! The naan was really delicious, the texture was similar to a pizza crust but thin, chewy and crispy. We got one butter chicken and one chicken mirch bhuna. They were both good. I love that they used dark meat to make the butter chicken, the sauce was creamy and slightly sweet. But I prefer the sauce in chicken mirch bhuda because it's spicy but not too much that you still can enjoy everything else.

From the time we placed the order to the time we actually got the food was about 28 minutes however we did get papad and chutney while we waited for our meal to come out.I had ordered the food to be medium in level of spice however the food was actually pretty spicy . I am able to handle the level of spice however my boyfriend not so much. I felt pretty bad that this food was a lot more spicier than it should have been for a medium. The waiter was nice enough and he gave him some yogurt to add into the food to make it a little less spicy.I had also ordered my naan with very little butter as I am not a big fan of butter and they were really great in honoring that. Most places look at me crazy but I was happy that they honored it without asking any questions. Minus that little mishap the food was great, the service was great. I will be going back here again when I get a chance.Just a tip for those of you who can't handle spice- order with the level of spice at a low because the medium was amazing for me but for someone who can't handle spice- the medium will burn your mouth.:) But I love my spice so I will be back .,.

After thorough perusal (I was thinking the word was perusion so thanks autocorrect) of the Indian options in my area for delivery, I settled on darbar. (Grill? The other one? Enigmatic identities if you ask me) Holy smokes. Ordered the Chana saag. Delivery estimate was 45 min. Because I'm sure my neighbs have had enough of me blasting the same edm over and over the last week, I spared them and used headphones this evening. I only had to one-ear-on-one-ear-off briefly bc right on cue 45 min later, the dude arrived. I had tons of shit that I wanted to finish before dinner and I was procrastinating so by the time I chowed down it was luke warm at best. But Holy Smokes (note the upper case for emphasis) it was bomb AF anyway. Flavors were out of control. I asked for medium spice level which I feel like is usually pretty sweat-inducing for white people but this was not spicy enough for me and I had to add sriracha. I also despise onions and could kinda perceive the essence of the dreaded and repulsive (imo) onion crunch but this was so delish, I'm letting it slide. What really put me over the edge was the fucking RICE. The fucking RICE is flavorful!!!!!! I could eat the whole fucking container of that shit PLAIN. (UPDATE: I just did). The rice bumped this shit from 4 to 5 stars. The portions are also really big. I barely ate today so my stomach is probably more shrively than normal with less capacity but still, I'm struggle-city trying to finish it. Do yourself a favor and eat here.",17,14,14,Rebecca H.,"Philadelphia, PA",249,285,490

We didnt order much but we were both stuffed! The staffs were very well mannered and attentive, lots of smiles and also asked us how our food went when we are not chewing. great job on that! the restaurant look tidy and clean. only reason why i didnt give a full 5 stars is because we had special treatment for writing a potiential review on yelp. i felt they shouldnt have to do that for a review. politely ask for a review ONCE is okay. it gets weird after a couple of time and with a complimentary dish. A yelper would have honestly rate them on service and quality without it.other than that, i would recommend you to go test it out yourself, check in for 15% off a dish they have at discount. otherwise, hide your identity and see how you would rate them. happy yelping!",13,12,12,Gloria W.,"Manhattan, NY",72,41,275

Upon eating the food, though, I realized that my concerns were unfounded as the food itself was quite tasty. I filled my plate to the brim with Saag Paneer, Chicken Tikka Masala, rice, and various other delicacies. I dipped the naan into the sauce which remained on my plate and I savored every bite of that Indian flatbread. The interior of the restaurant is impressive for a restaurant in Midtown; the fact that it wasn't crammed to the door was a nice addition, especially since the meal was occurring around afternoon lunch time.At the end, there was some confusion over payment as I was with a large party splitting a check multiple ways.

2.0,8/24/2016,"Had the buffet lunch, for the price paid and the quality it was ok but in a city like New York much better places are available. Darbar is actually a Bangladeshi place not Indian so the food tastes slightly different to a traditional North Indian place for example. The naan bread was a naan but flavorless as they do not have a tandoor so lacks the crisp smokiness of a good naan. The saag paneer didn't have cubes of paneer as I've experienced everywhere else, smashed to tiny little balls and mixed with the paneer to cut costs. Some of the buffet dishes such as the chana were oilier then this needs to be, perhaps to make it heavier so diners consume less of the buffet.Tandoori chicken again had the same issue as the naan, no tandoor so lacked the correct flavor of this dish if you just bake it in an oven.. As I write am thinking which dish was the stand out dish from the buffet to be more positive and I cannot think of a single one, so if you're in the area and fancy a curry then its ok but don't expect anything special.

5.0,4/25/2016,"My boyfriend made reservations for us here to celebrate our 2 & a half year anniversary. It was a Saturday night and we were seated on the ground floor (didn't realize there was a higher level). You definitely get the feel that this isn't a typical casual restaurant spot-- but at the same time the feel is not so elevated in ambiance that it's intimidating to visit. The staff were attentive and knowledgeable about the menu, and frequently checked in on us to ask us how the food was and how we were doing. Lots of water refills, which is perfect for this flavorful meal! We were also excited to try some Indian beers that came in beautiful looking bottles.My bf and I decided to go with the prefixe dinner for $38 each, which includes a soup, appetizer, entree, and dessert. Each dish was perfectly portioned with the exception of the entree-- that entree filled me up! The pacing of the meal was great as well. It really allowed us to take our time with each dish to chat / share / enjoy to the fullest. Below are some highlights:Reshmi Kebab: Oh my. That chicken was literally... divine. I LOVED it. My boyfriend originally ordered it but I kept stealing small bites from his plate... The chicken was just so soft and tender, perfectly seasoned, and not dry at all. I could literally eat a whole plate of it were it not just an appetizer. Definitely got me excited for the rest of the meal!!Behl Puri: At first i was intimidated by how it looked (I honestly ordered it without really knowing what it was, and from the looks of it I still couldn't figure out what it was) but as soon as i took my first bite I fell in love. Refreshing and flavorful, I was delighted by its crunchiness! I guess I could try to equate this to a salad, but calling it a salad doesn't do it justice. Such a fun and delicious appetizer!Lamb Rogan Josh: Also cooked to perfection. Tender and filling, the sauce was a perfect dip for my naan. I found myself, near the end of the meal as my belly was starting to bulge, forcing myself to at least finish the lamb... i just couldn't let it go to waste!Both of the desserts & soups were delicious as well, I especially liked the Mango Mousse cake. It was a great, cool & sweet ending to a memorable meal! I would definitely visit again.",15,15,15,Joyce C.,"Manhattan, NY",207,45,56

5.0,3/17/2016,"On 50th street in Central Manhattan Clustered amongst other Asian cuisines is this hidden gem called Darbar. A fine Indian cuisine to be exact nestled in midtown Manhattan. Debar was an excellent place to enjoy wonderful gourmet filled dishes with an abundance of flavor. New to Indianan cuisine I was skeptical on what I might feel, even after reading other reviews. When entering I was greeted by soft spoken and a respectful staff that then escort me to my table. Your serve then hands me this well thought out menu filled with an assortment of Indian cuisines. For novice Indian cuisine diners, the staff was more than happy to explain in detail the content of each item on the menu. In a few cases they gave me excellent recommendations based on my taste preferences.From the first drink to the desert, each item was saturated with flares of showmanship. Never a dull moment.  Temperature, timing, presentation and flavor were on point.  The Food was amazing and worth every penny.  My order included the following. Drinks: Mango Mojitos.  Made with a perfect blend of ingredients making for an abundantly flavorful refreshment. Appetizer: Okra Crunch, and Vegetable Samosas Scallops.  Okra crunch was quite exquisite. I was completely blown away. Definitely wasn't expecting you can take okra and make anything near what I received.  It's a perfect starter to prepare you for the main course.  I tried the Vegetable Samos and they were on point. Crispy outside, with a warm hardy inside. Main course: Chicken Mango and Fish Tikka Masala. Chicken Mango was delightfully flavorful. In clued with an order of flat garlic bread which truly complemented the dish and helps you wipe the gravy off the plate. The Fish Tikka Masala was moist and flavorful. Both excellent choices I would recommend both. Desert: Gulab Jamun and Mango Mousse Cake. The Mango Mousse Cake was unreal. For mango desert fans like myself, I was in mango heaven. Gulab Jamun, was a new experience for me so I have nothing to compare it to but I liked them. Now out of the entire order the only thing that I could say was less then par was the scallops. They were little salty and a little chewy. Keep in mind I Have worked in the restaurant business for a 15 years and an avid cook myself and I know cooking scallops, as easy as it looks are one of the more difficult things to prepare. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and reorder to see. Over all I loved it.The ambiance of the restaurant was very inviting.  The walls were filled with dark wood Decorated with sconces and art native India.  No booths just table seating that was set up in a way to allow for a nice flow were people weren't bumping into each other. Overall I was very pleased with the entire experience and would recommend it to anyone. Just be prepared to be astonished.",16,14,14,Ronald G.,"Paramus, NJ",11,1,7
5.0,3/13/2016,"Overall very happy! My friends and I organized a get together for over 10 people and we were seated right by the bar, which was great for us to mingle while we waited for our appetizers and entrees. I love Indian food and my friends ordered a range of naan and soups to start, and everyone was happy with them. The server also brought us a house ""chip"" with dips, which looked like long toasted skinny bread and everyone enjoyed trying out the different dipping sauces. We weren't charged for that. That was very nice of them.The bar drinks were nice, I must say. For an Indian restaurant, I was expecting the Happy Hour to be so good. Good drink portions and great selection!For dinner we ordered a range of chicken and vegetable dishes, and they all came with rice and very generous portions. There was a lot of food at the table, and between cocktails and mango lassi drinks, we all felt very satisfied. For dessert, we weren't sure what to order and the waiter suggested that since we were a large group, we would try one of each and share. We did and that was fun, because all of the desserts were yummy! I've been here a number of times for lunch buffet and for dinner in smaller groups, too, and it's been great, but by far, this was my best experience. Most restaurants don't handle large tables too well, but we were all so happy with the meal and customer service. I had called ahead to make a reservation and to let them know we were getting together a group of friends who hadn't seen each other for a while.

1.0,2/22/2016,"No. Just no.My bf and I came in around 3:20 pm on a Saturday afternoon. We were greeted by a young man who, right off the bat, told us that the buffet they advertise until 4 pm was closing in 15 minutes. I haaaaaaaate when offers are advertised until a certain time and businesses don't abide by that. My bf wasn't too worried and figured he could eat enough in 15 minutes to warrant paying for the buffet but I really don't like to be rushed so I decided to order from the menu. I ordered a cappuccino, mulligatawny soup, and the shrimp bhuna, and everything about this whole meal was just wrong.My bf immediately dove into the buffet (ONLY 15 MINUTES!) so he definitely had food before I did and that's ok. Totally expected. What's not ok is that 15 minutes in, I still didn't even have my cappuccino. In fact, I was served my soup before my cappuccino. I'm like 90% sure the server had forgotten. I did see him start on it about 10 minutes after I ordered it so I shrugged it off and started on my soup. The soup was good if you're looking for a cream of coconut soup. There was no chicken, there was no veg, there were no discernible lentils. It was a puree. Not what I was expecting but not bad. It did get a little too much, though, w/ how creamy and rich it was. I didn't end up finishing it for that reason. So back to my cappuccino. The server finally drops off a cup of coffee w/ coffee grounds on the plate and floating on the top and literally says, ""Here's your cappuccino."" There's a tiny bit of foam on top that's dissipating quickly and I realize there's literally no milk in there. I grab the server as he tries to slip by and I said, ""Sorry, I ordered a cappuccino. There's no milk in here. This is definitely not what I ordered."" He said, ""Yeah, I think our cappuccino machine is broken right now. Do you want me to get you some regular coffee?"" Whattttttt! Why wouldn't you just tell me the machine is broken? Why would you serve me something really unappetizing and literally tell me it's what I ordered? I don't care if something is broken and you can't offer that. What I care about is that you gave me one thing and told me it was another and expected I wouldn't catch you. I mean, it was so clearly not a cappuccino, it just seems super insulting that he thought he could pull that off. Honestly, my mind is still blown about that. I told him I wasn't paying for that but I didn't feel like going through the hassle of getting anything else. I just told him to get me milk and I'd drink it. Another 10 minutes goes by and I stop him again and asked where the milk was. He went into the kitchen and got it right away but at this point, all the bridges were burnt. The drink wasn't salvageable and I didn't drink it.My shrimp bhuna finally came out (long after my bf was finished w/ his buffet and they were cleaning it up). The server brought out the shrimp and was like, ""Oh, oops, let me get you some rice."" The rice he brought was cold. The shrimp tasted so so so fishy in a not good way. The sauce was good but the shrimp itself made me super nervous to eat so I didn't. My bf got the check and paid for it while I went to the restroom but I asked him if they still charged us for that goddamn cappunccino. He said they did. I'm still furious about this whole experience two days later. If NYC thinks this place is worth 3.5 stars then NYC is crazy. Darbar sucks.",2,0,0,Virginia E.,"Philadelphia, PA",32,94,60

3.0,1/15/2016,"Unclear. As an Indian I feel like I should know more about Indian food. But I didn't appreciate this place for two reasons: lack of service (given for an Indian restaurant, but being in a location like this, I think they should step up their game), and the dish that we got wasn't very good at all. Beet balls in some curry - but there were only three balls. Didn't matta cause neither me NOR my dad wanted to grab the 3rd one. Odd taste - maybe I just don't like cooked beets. I WILL SAY THOUGH, their samosas are FRESH AS CRAP! Honestly, best tasting samosas I've ever had (and these, I know like the back of my hand).",2,1,1,Priti R.,"New York, NY",324,409,57
3.0,1/13/2016,"The statement that the customer is always right is about as valid as the statement that the lion is the king of the jungle. Both are equally baseless, have been handed down for generations, and are mindlessly parroted despite having no basis in fact or reason. A lion doesn't even live in a jungle, and is not even the largest or most powerful cat, let alone the most powerful animal. There is no truth to the statement that the customer is always right. When a business states that, it is simply trying to establish goodwill with us as its customers; when a customer states it, he or she is just a worthless cretin with an inflated sense of entitlement. Some of the negative reviews of restaurants like Darbar are a reflection of how wrong customers can be. When you go to an Indian restaurant and order something that is not traditionally Indian, it is preposterous to complain that it was not authentic. For example, cheese naan is not even a thing in Indian cuisine. If you order it, it's ludicrous to complain that it was Americanized. Due to the fact that this Darbar location is close to my office, I have had a few lunches and dinners here. I have always been satisfied with the taste of the food, the portion sizes, and the service. Hence the A-OK 3 star rating. The dish that stands out at Darbar, which warrants a repeat visit, and by itself may even bring Darbar to a 4 star experience, is the chicken kali mirch, which is available only on the dinner menu. Cubes of chicken breast are cooked in a creamy sauce that contains a mix of black pepper and a green chili paste. The heat indices of the black pepper and the green chillies combine to cover the various areas of the mouth's geography, and give this dish an interesting level of spiciness. The all white meat chicken tends to get a little dry, but that's where the creamy sauce helps to moisten it. If you do find yourself in the area and find yourself wanting Indian food, try the chicken kali mirch at Darbar. Everything else on the menu is pretty standard and consistent with the other Indian restaurants around town.",16,6,8,Kashif K.,"Manhattan, NY",1485,381,8670

The pleasant lady greeted us and asked ""upstairs or down?"". Since I was confused by the book and movie ""Up the Downstair case"", I asked what she advised. Upstairs it was and was very cozy. As my wife is lactose intolerant, she enjoys Indian cuisine as she simply avoids the yogurt. The waiter even went further and brought some roti while I devoured the garlic naan.My wife's chicken biryani was made without any dairy products and was even more flavorful than our favorite local haunt back home.

2.0,7/20/2015,"Darbar is quietly tucked in Midtown East. I was invited to a dinner party here and unfortunately, the food really fell short of my expectations. I see the high ratings went to lunch buffet, so perhaps dinner was a bad choice to begin with. Chicken Tikka Masala is my all-time favorite dish at any Indian restaurant. This British-Indian fusion dish is usually made with marinated chicken slow-cooked in a creamy, spiced, and orange sauce. Essentially, tomato is the most apparent taste of all ingredients. I have a very soft spot with this dish and with all the high ratings I see, ordering this dish is a no brainer. The balance of ingredients of the dish was way too off for I tasted too much tomato puree with a strong sour tomato aftertaste. It was really just tomato soup. Not to mention, the chicken came in huge, chunky pieces but was way too dry. I had trouble cutting it. Mango Lassi is always a safe choice but their version of it was way too thick. It was really hard drinking it from the straw. I thought there was too much yogurt and not much mango. Service was very attentive and we were very well taken care of. I almost feel bad for giving this place a two-stars review but I really could did not enjoy the food at all.I will stick to my Indian spots in Jackson Heights, Queens.",5,2,3,Cynthia D.,"Queens, NY",498,888,6834

Made a reservation for 6:30pm and when I arrived, it was pretty quiet. Sat at a table upstairs which was empty. I actually prefer environments that I can sit and talk to my friend so I wasn't the least bit upset. It was happy hour and the waiter explained that it was only valid at the bar. He came back a few minutes later and said he'll still honor it for us. Super sweet. My friend and I each got a cocktail and they both definitely had a kick to it. Thumbs up.We ordered an order of garlic naan to share between the two of us and I got my butter chicken and she got the goat with spinach. I'm usually a chicken tikki masala girl and the butter chicken is quite similar but not quite as acidic. Still yummy though. They even ended the night with an indian dessert which resembled rice pudding. That was tasty too... never had it before.All and all, I'm glad i ventured out of my comfort zone and gave this restaurant a try. The food and service was great and if i'm up in midtown east again, i will for sure be back.",16,14,15,Lisa C.,"New York, NY",236,274,156

4.0,2/21/2015,"I was jonesing for a palak paneer at work and hopped on Seamless to see which Indian restaurant could deliver that spinach and cottage cheese goodness in as little time as possible. Darbar was a top choice for delivery estimate so I went with it.You don't get to choose the spiciness level of the palak paneer but it was mild (which I would have chosen anyway). It was packed into one of those round plastic containers, and comes with a similar-sized container of WHITE rice. It does not look like Basmati or brown rice is an option on the menu, but they have a few other types of rice (lemon, vegetable biryani) that you can order as a side dish.You could alternately order a garlic and cheese naan like I did for dipping in the palak. Most Indian places have garlic naan and cheese naan, but the two are great together in one delicious pillow of dough.It's a little on the expensive side for how much food you get but it is take-out and this is midtown.

The waiters were excellent and made sure we had water and anything we asked for.  The décor was nice although not ritzy, but the best part was that you could actually talk in Darbar (I find that in most NYC restaurants you can hardly hear the person next to you when it's crowded).  My wife who loves Indian food absolutely loved the restaurant and although I do not usually eat at Indian places much, even I was impressed with the food.  Anyone that gave one star to this place is nuts.  Go here if you want a great meal, a restaurant where you can talk and excellent service.",2,2,2,Michael L.,"Huntington, NY",7,8,0

1.0,10/20/2014,"Ordered twice from this place. First time experience was disappointing so decided to give them another chance before writing a review.The ambiance is slightly better than surrounding Indian restaurants but the food has been over-priced to compensate for it. Quality of ingredients are mediocre and its a clear exploitation of the local crowd who are typically unfamiliar with what good Indian food should taste like. Staple food items like Mulligatawny soup, biryani and chicken tikka masala are huge let downs and poorly executed. A $14 chicken biryani dish should not have huge chucks of dry, tasteless chicken breast. Basmati rice was undercooked or just refrigerated for days on end since it had a crunchy, slim texture.   The buffet is probably a good bet if you are craving Indian food to stuff your face with. However, this place is far from being a fine Indian restaurant, as they claim to be.Takeout lunch or dinner for two will run you about $40, and will leave you feeling regret and an early reservation at the toilet seat.",1,0,0,Mystery M.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",1,17,23

When we got there, it was one couple there but hey, we got there at 10pm on a Saturday night. It was the Superbowl weekend and everyone was at Times Square. It was perfect for us since we wanted to get away from the crowd. We decided to try the Prix Fixe menu for $38 dollars. It was on the limited side when it came to options but we weren't too hungry since we had empanadas from a vendor on Times Square (that would be my next review, lol).Our waiter was extremely nice and patient with us because we were very confused but willing to try anything. For the soup, I had the vegetarian one, which was called Mulligataway soup (it was a special lentil that they used that made the soup yellow). That was very fulfilling. For appetizers, you know I love me some crab cakes. Since it was part of the prix fixe, they only gave one. I was kinda pissed because it was really that good. Mind you, we had empanadas before and we were supposed to be be full, (yeah, we are greedy). The entree was exquisite; I ordered the Paneer Pasanda. For dessert, I ordered the Gulab Jamun which is like four sweet cheeseballs; it wasn't the best. I actually didn't like it but my friend ordered the Mango Mousse cake which melted it my mouth. I felt bad eating her dessert since it was her bday.The grand total of this perfect night was around $100 something (I included the tip, too).

Quick service. My boyfriend and I came for the second time on his birthday.  The first time was good as well but our second visit confirmed Darbar to be a new favorite of ours.  Because I had told them it was his birthday, they brought us a very well-presented piece of cake (free of charge!) and sang to him :) A dying tradition, I think. The man who took our order warned me that my dish (Chicken Vindaloo) was very spicy but I tried it anyway.  Later, he came by to check on me -  I told him it was a little spicy but I liked it.  He then brought me some delicious yogurt to cool down the spices (I'm not a yogurt fan but this added a good flavor too!).  I was impressed that he had the consideration to check on me as well as to actually do something about it!  Throughout the night, staff checked on us often but inconspicuously and never interrupted our conversations. My boyfriend ordered the lamb dish with spinach sauce (saag I think) - incredible! This is a dish he orders frequently at Indian restaurants and Darbar executes wonderfully. Not the biggest wine list but for $6, you get a good sized glass of decent wine, from my non-connoisseur opinion.  In the end, they took this off the bill as an added bonus! Lastly, if you like rosemary - the rosemary naan is definitely worth the extra $1!",2,2,2,Nadia T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0

We went there on a Saturday evening around 730 pm or so. The crowd was more white people than Indians :). When i first saw that, i was skeptical about the food cos if you find lot of foreigners in an Indian restaurant, it is given that the food is more bland and has less spices. That was not the case here. We got seated. They started with Papad and mint/tamarind chutney. We ordered samosas as appetizers and my wife and I ordered Madras chicken curry, rotis and chappathi. Samosas was served with Tomato pickle. Samosas were fresh and tasty. The pickle was tasty. My wife loved it so much that we asked for some more; and they brought that in a bigger plate. (They didn't charge for the pickle). The pickle was tasty. Then came the madras chicken curry, roti, chappathi and rice. They had garnished the chicken curry with curry leaves fried in coconut oil.  That completed the curry. It smelled good and tasted delicious. Chappathi, roti are the usual thing, was ok. This is definitely a $$ place. They charge 4$ per roti / chappathi. Yelp check-in offered a free dessert. They served kheer which was tasty too; 8/10. Overall, I liked this place.

It is red colored coconut only. I have had it this way before though so I don't mind as much. Won't add or subtract as one Naan was free.Mysoori Chili Chicken chicken cooked with mustard seed, dry chili, and coconut with bell peppers.      $16.00So I go this as it had Mysore/Mysoori in the beginning. Mysore means a heavy red spice, commonly found in dosas and I was curious to see what they would do. Dish turned out to be basically Kung Pao chicken, as in Faux/American-Chinese. I wasn't happy and the dish wasn't flavored as well as well. -1/5. Oh wait it was 16 bucks for this, -4/5, as it wasn't even good by American-Chinese standardsMadras Chicken Curry Chicken with dry chili, mustard, coconut and curry leaves. $13.00Was OK but the curry leave flavor/mustard/dry chili coconut flavor was lacking, o wait that is all of the flavors. This was honestly the best of the entrees so that isn't that good a sign. Was a part of the price fix.2/5Chicken Saagwala chicken with garlic and spinach     $16.00I see the spinach. I see the small amount of chicken. Where are the spices? It was basically chicken topped with creamed Spinach that had been hardened. Not spicy, well actually not spiced. 1.0/5-1/15Desserts (4 bucks)I would have had Gajar Halwa but they were out of it so I had kheer.It was OK, not enough of a pistachio flavor but the texture was good and the golden raisins had good flavor as well. 2.5/5Gulab jamun: was ONE cheese ball. I haven't seen a restaurant that gives 1 cheese ball, I mean really. This dish is not pricy at all  and even the mid-range places give 2.

3.0,2/20/2013,"Darbar is a very solid place for Indian food. However, my great experience there has to be adjusted to a 3 stars simply because many other Indian restaurant are just as flawless. So let me make a quick disclaimer: if you looking for re-assurance about your selection - you made a great choice. The draw of Darbar is in its ambiance. Once you get past the the crummy looking sign outside, you will immediately notice the midtown tier milieu with the fine white table clothes to the black vested wait staff. I had the chef recommended chicken malai (16). I was disappointed that the incredibly mastered mix of spices in this dish had absolutely no kick in it. Temperature wise, I was hoping it'd be hotter as well so I have more time to work on the dish. And the fact that it came in a very pretty looking but big surface area plate just sped up the cooling, making the last bits of chicken that much harder to enjoy. I also wished the chicken was prepared more tender because I don't like the feeling of too much substance in a curry-like dish. The service was impeccable. The water refilling, table cleaning, the food serving were all close to the fine dining they advertise themselves. However, I have been spoiled by the level of service in Indian establishments so I'll give credits where its due but not necessarily put them above others for it. Sorry! I will definitely come back when I am in the area. But unless the midtown real estate is a necessity, its still hard to beat out the pricing and similar levels of service and polish in places like Seva (yelp.com/biz/seva-astoria) in my neighborhood.",0,0,0,Qian W.,"Queens, NY",327,349,61

4.0,1/17/2013,"I decided to go to this restaurant because it was highly recommended by some of my collegues in our NYC office. I am a huge fan of Indian food and know good Indian food when I have it. I walked into what I would consider a very nice restaurant and was greeted right away. since it was early for dinner they asked me where I wanted to sit and I suggested the back because I didn't want to be on display being the only customer at that time.For my meal I ordered Beetroot Malai Kofta. The sauce was pretty run of the mill, but good. Their Basmati rice, although plain, was also very good. I asked what wine the waiter recommended for this meal and he suggested a Pinot Nior; he responded to my question like he was asking ""Pinot Nior?"" but I took his advice and it was a good pairing for what I ate. When I eat Indian food I always need naan. Their plain naan was very basic and did not have the taste I was looking for, not sure why, but it was missing something.

4.0,1/10/2013,"I want to start this off by saying this is my very first time eating Indian food.... S P I C Y!!!!!!(I almost died).. ok so I'm being dramatic.My darling little brother who just came back from India suggested I eat the Biryani since it wouldn't be spicy. (He lied) lol. The waiter told me not to get it but noooo I listened to my brother. First bite & the heat kicks in, I'm a burning fool at the table. The waiter comes over & tells me I told you so. Lmfao!!!! So there's no way I can eat the Biryani & tell my brother he has to eat it. He happily digs in. I try his chicken tikka Masala still a bit spicy but far less than the Biryani. The meal came with rice and a yogurt sauce which quickly became my meal besties.. They also had this really good flat bread which I'd happily eat all the time if I could cope with the rest of the menu items.. The food was very good if I could remove the heat factor I'd eat here often. A huge thank you to the waiter who felt bad for me & brought me a chicken tikka masala that was less spicy than the original version. (that was too spicy for me too) But his efforts were very much appreciated. He probably hates me & thinks I'm an idiot for going to an Indian restaurant not being able to eat spicy food but I'd rather say I tried it and know that its not something that I can eat then never try at all.While I probably cant eat here again I'm sure my brother would so 4 stars.",7,7,7,Daneliz R.,"Bronx, NY",221,240,30
3.0,1/9/2013,"Indian lunch buffets are iffy, but we took a chance and headed over to Darbar for a late lunch after arriving in Grand Central. We were seated right away and they had a lot of options on the buffet which was nice. The usual suspects were there: tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala, mattar panner (peas and cheese), and daal (lentils). They also had fish korma and a goat curry, plus some rice, chutneys and other sauces.The tikka masala was not good, but the tandoori chicken was solid, the mattar paneer was very good, and the daal was as expected. I liked the korma sauce, but didn't get any fish as that seemed a little dicey to me. They brought plenty of naan and water was refilled frequently. Our server was friendly although occasionally a bit hard to track down.If I come here again I'll order something from the menu instead of the buffet.",1,1,1,Rachel E.,"Houston, TX",110,983,299
3.0,1/4/2013,"LUNCH DELIVERY REVIEW:$9 lunch deal for Tandoori Chicken, Veg of the day, Naan & Rice is pretty good. I have no major complaints about the food either. Overall it was good and I would have given them 4 stars except for two things:1) They needed to remove the cardamom before serving the food! For those of you who don't know  - it's a spice about the size of a pea with a very potent flavor and is used extensively in Indian cooking (one of the key ingredients in Garam Masala) but your experience can be ruined if you happen to bite into one. I know people who have thrown up from biting into this. This was in the vegetable of the day, which happened to be peas. I have no problems with cardamom - in fact it's essential for good Indian food - but you have to find a way to take it out after you're done cooking or grind it down before you cook with it! It was perfectly camouflaged with the peas and I almost gagged when I bit into it.2) Is my name Samantha Sissy? No it's not. When I ask for my food to be spicy, I mean I want it to be spicy. The food they sent me wasn't even mildly spicy. However the chicken was cooked well (though leg meat is hard to mess up) and the flavors were well balanced which is why I still liked it.I will probably still order from them in the future. I just have to make sure to give them very specific instructions on Seamless Web.",2,2,0,Wahed K.,"Astoria, NY",680,778,1618

4.0,12/10/2012,"Darbar is a trendy little Indian restaurant close enough to Grand Central that you can grab take-out there on your way home.Kofta actually won my vote, it was made with beetroot, so it was a beautiful color, and the texture was divine. Tandoori paneer appetizer was kind of bland and insanely overpriced. Seriously, for three pieces of fcking cheese, I should not be paying $10 dollars. I can make paneer at home for cheaper.I didn't realize I got a check-in coupon for a free dessert until after I paid. But they honored it by giving me a second dessert. They even let me pick what I wanted (rasmalai, all the way baby!)Overall, I very much enjoyed the food from Darbar.

The chef's special chicken is roasted in an oven then baked in a curry. It was very good, but not strong flavors. I actually used the curry to ""mild-up"" the butter chicken sauce, since I am spice-phobic.  Each dish was around $16, so a little pricy.Kheer for house dessert (free with yelp check in) was good too.

Cheese naan was phenomenal! Meat platter was delicious as the chicken samoas were my favorite.  Chicken tika masala was ok. I've had better, but I was satisfied. Prices are reasonable. Can't complain in that department. Service was a little slow at first. It took a long time for anyone to come up to us. But then... service became a little too good. First off, Im not use to people putting food on my plate in front of me. Never really had that done before, but I didn't really mind. However, when we had asked for ice to put in our sparkling water, our server actually scooped the ice and put it in our glasses.

If I had only ordered those two dishes I'd rate this restaurant 3.5 stars.  However, the other dishes were so bad i threw them away! The Palak Paneer tasted like canned creamed spinach with a minty taste or something that just made it disgusting.  And it was really bright green looking (which is normally not the case).  In terms of the Chicken Vindaloo I'd normally describe it as being tangy or something like that, but this dish had way too much vinegar.  Don't waste your time here...

5.0,7/26/2011,"I've eaten at every Indian restaurant in Cincinnati, and none of them come close to the amazing tastes of Darbar. The service and presentation was immaculate. Our dinner service was very formal: ladies were handed menus and served before men, the server would dish out the first portion of your food to your plate, permission was asked before removing plates, and crumbs were cleaned up between meal courses. It was a very classy atmosphere, but the customer needs not to wear a suit and tie.The food was spectacular. I had a samosa, a pakora, and the eggplant korma. The curry was adequately spicy, and didn't make my nose stuffy. I could taste the eggplant and all of the vegetable flavors. Every individual ingredient was noticeable and not overwhelmed with spices. Delicious. My dining companions had Vindaloo, a very, very spicy dish. The waiter even warned them ahead of time of the heat level. Being English, they scoffed in the face of hot ""American"" curry. Turns out, the Vindaloo was some of the best they've tasted, including what they had back home in the U.K. They were impressed.My meal was very reasonably priced for the quality, and considering it is New York: $22.00. (In Cincinnati, a similar meal would cost $17.00.)Darbar, if you're looking to open another location, come to Cincinnati. We need you here!",5,6,5,Paige M.,"Seattle, WA",75,1041,1812

The vegetable curry are good too, very tasty. Should try this place out.

Food: for the appetizer we got the samoas and potato thing. None of it were very spicy, the portions were small (but enough to share perfectly among 4 people). I thought the flavors were a little bland. For entrees we got the 1) butter chicken, delicious! Perfectly cooked chicken with flavorful sauce and not spicy at all. 2) spinach, an interesting taste, but good interesting. It's very thick and spinachy. It comes with bamati rice and no meat. 3) chicken malai, very very mild spicyness. Kind of like the butter chicken. 4) lamb bryani, I don't know if this is authentic but it's mega delicious!!! The spiciness was perfect, with good flavor and the lamb was the perfect softness and texture. Naan, we ordered two types, the plain one and the cheese and garlic. The cheese and garlic was very delicious with very generous flavors of cheese and garlic. The plain one...it was so good it tasted better on it's own. We got two of those. For dessert we got the mango ice cream. It was perfect! If you love mangos then you'll need to get this. Though the meal was kind of pricey, I would come back.

The boyfriend and I came here on Halloween night (yes, in costume) after driving around trying to find a Chipotle that was open, not crowed and was around parking. Needless to say, we were not sucessful (why didn't we just eat in the Bronx??) so we ended up finding a parking space right in front of this place (close to where we planned to go out dancing that night) and decided to just try it. What a way to start off the night. First off, the staff got a kick out of our Halloween costumes (he was a pilot, I was a flight attendant) and seemed to enjoy to have a little Halloween spirit at their restaurant. The service was wonderful and the food even better. We ordered meat samosas which were really yummy, Chicken Tikka Masala and Shrimp Biryani . I finished my meal with a Mango Lassi which tasted like it was made with real mangos. Overall, wonderful experience.

I'm not really into Indian vege, so I can't comment on that, but they had this mashed spinach thingy which is really good! And the dessert completely blew me over - the mango mousse is refreshing while the other more traditional dessert (something like a rice pudding I think) is uniquely different and delicious!The only thing is I wish they had papadams, then it would have been perfect!

The portion was also perfect, on the larger side.I also had the eggplant bartha which was delicious!! The only gripe about this entree is that it was spicy. Usually this is a mild dish.

Right now it is $11.95. To summarize my feelings: baah, baah, baah, a little pedestrian. Bukhara Grill's food is superior in the taste department, but this place is more convenient for me due to its location. Ironically, when you're next to a Teriyaki Boy, there is no competition! Sadly, Teriyaki Boy is now closed and now some noodle place. But I digress.On a recent visit, my companion and I was offered to wait for a table or sit at the bar (there are two floors that provide the same things). We hung our coats on the back of our chairs at the bar, ordered King Fisher beers and ran to the buffet. Chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken and curry goat are the highlights of the meat section. Actually, I don't even like their chicken tikka masala because it's dry (at least I use the tomato based sauce for my naan). There are also rice, saag, potato and other vegetarian option trays. There is a pathetic ""salad"" section consisting of iceberg lettuce, onions, chickpeas, etc and a dessert. Last time I saw a mango mousse. At least it wasn't the soggy donut (I know that's not what 'galub jamun' is, but blech).If you are seated promptly (you may have to wait if you have an entourage), get water refills and naan, it is a good deal.
