5.0,4/22/2019,"Come hungry and ready to savor the best sushi in Chelsea. Seriously, I'm picky when it comes to my tuna but Naoki are amazing. They also have a whole new menu, which in my humble opinion, is far better than the one before.If it's just the two of you, I highly recommend ordering the Delight option from the tasting menu. Naoki also has a great sake selection. I, for one, loved their Plum sake.Staff is very, very nice. They will call you ahead of time to make sure you're coming and yes, you will have to provide your credit card.",0,0,1,Tatyana F.,"Falls Church, VA",118,133,34

Overall, the quality of the dishes was excellent with fresh seafood. The service was also quite good, and the ambiance is dark but a good place for a quiet, private meal for small groups.

5.0,4/3/2019,"Naoki Takahashi was an amazing experience! Both me and my best girl friend felt so spoiled after this night. The boyfriend surprised me with a reservation here and made advance payment for the Naoki Kaiseki dining. We were greeted immediately with smiles when we entered. Gorgeous garden where we were sitting at. Hostess and server was very friendly, attentive, and considerate! This was a night that we will always remember. Naoki Kaiseki Menu & our dining experience: AmuseBluefin Tuna & Scottish Salmon Tartare with Caviar - this was very flavorful. So yummy as a started.FirstKing Crab Yuzu Cerviche- the meat was so yummy and tasty! Cerviche gave this an extra kick. Second Scallops & Mushrooms with Sweet & Spicy Garlic Sauce- this was so good & garlicky! Soft Shell Crab Spring Roll - crab was crispy and soft at the same time Black Cod with Saikyo Miso - the fish was so soft. The Miso was on point! Third Whole King Crab Leg Glazed with Uni Sauce - can't get enough of crab meat! So fresh! Wagyu Sukiyaki - oh em gee. The meat was so soft and melted like butter! The sukiyaki broth was so tasty! Fourth We had the sushi chef surprise us. The sushi was good, but some didn't taste the freshest. Still enjoyed everything! Dessert Matcha a Green Tea Brûlée - so creamy and yummy! Black Bean Pudding - oh me gee! This hit the spot! This was an such a delicious meal. We both ate so much this night and got super full with everything. It was such a great way for us to end our New York trip! Overall, if I am in the area again I will be back here for sure! Thanks to the bf for making this happen!

4.0,3/11/2019,"A little pricey, but kinda worth it.Tofu steak impressed me. Slightly sweet tofu on a hot rock, dipping in sweet miso sauce, just tasted perfect.Soft crab shell karaage was nice as well, but not very impressive comparing to the tofu steak.King crab legs were just fine. The sauce was too light. However, the cod was the best, nicely grilled, very soft and sweet. In addition, it used my favorite sweet miso as the sauce. The baby peach on side was truly sweetish.As for dessert, try black sesame pudding!",0,0,0,Ray Y.,"Boston, MA",14,356,509

2.0,2/14/2019,I am literally at this restaurant right now and am having the worst restaurant experience I have ever had in my entire life. For a NYC restaurant it is completely unacceptable. First we were sat 30 min past our reservation. We tried looking for another reservation but last minute on Valentine's Day is difficult. I knew we were in trouble when I saw all of the receipts at the kitchen window that still needed to be fired. Multiple tables have angry patrons waiting for food.  We were really sad to have such a terrible valentines experience at a restaurant we were looking forward to eating at. We sat for one hour and we only just received our appetizers (it was 10:36 from our 9pm reservation.). My boyfriend literally was begging them to give us any food bc we were so hungry. The kitchen obviously was unable to handle the number of reservations and the set menu they made. We were served my appetizer and they did not serve my bf appetizer for 15 min. He had to ask them for food. The appetizers were cold / mediocre. Chawamushi and calamari was cold (it's supposed to be warm to hot.) Lobster tempura and sashimi appetizer were delicious. The steak and black miso cod were perfectly cooked. Sushi fish was good quality. Yummy Uni! Very flavorful miso soup with tofu skin. Washu sukiyaki was perfect. Not too sweet and not to salty with a delightful onsen egg. The food was good it's unfortunate the night was poorly planned for them. I feel bad for the servers. They had to deal with many upset tables. For desserts we had a lovely ichigo mochi and green tea matcha crepe cake. Despite all the fuck ups on the service they didn't even comp us on a single drink and rushed us with the check before we even finished our dessert.  Poorly managed restaurant and multiple unpleasant conversations with the manager/ hostess woman.  Didn't want to not leave a tip and fuck over the waiter and totally contemplated just walking out on this bill for the first time in my life. Totally ruined our Valentines Day experience.  Apparently the chef recently left the restaurant. To boot a mouse ran across the grating as I was walking out of the restaurant door.,1,0,0,M L.,"New York, NY",294,90,28

2.0,2/12/2019,"One word: unimpressed. The décor inside is spectacular, but for all the money we spent at this place, I was expecting the food to taste divine. Instead, my local Japanese takeout serves better tempura. My husband and I came here for restaurant week. I had ordered the soft shell crab as an appetizer, the lobster tempura for the entrée, and strawberry daifuku as dessert. The soft shell crab was good (a bit oily) but portion size was small and left me wanting more. The lobster tempura was extremely oily with no flavor whatsoever. NONE. The daifuku was good, but nothing memorable.What did it for me is that they had not taken my intolerance to mushrooms seriously. When the waiter came to take our order, I had advised him of my intolerance to mushrooms. He guaranteed that none of the food would be prepared with mushrooms. In addition, my husband had called the restaurant in advance to ask if they could prepare the dishes without any mushrooms. They had said yes that they would make the accommodation. To my surprise, the rice and miso soup that was served along with the tempura had mushrooms. My husband ended up eating the rice and miso soup. However, this should not have happened, especially since we had told the restaurant twice of my intolerance to mushrooms.Overall, we were was disappointed and left unsatisfied.",2,0,0,Amanda D.,"Newark, NJ",375,296,83
2.0,2/8/2019,"Came here for restaurant week, and left rather unimpressed, especially for the price we paid for it. The two things that lived up to the price was the sashimi ($50, 12pcs) we ordered outside the restaurant week menu, and the sake (cold mountain?) we ordered that was pretty good.We did order the restaurant week dinner menu (soft shell crab kara age, sobanomi truffle risotto, washu beef sukiyaki, tempura with shrimp, and both dessert) Because we started off with sashimi, we were pretty excited to try the meal, but first, the kara age crab came out cold. When I asked the server if that was how it was supposed to be, she apologized and told me that they were making a new order for me. When it came out again, I noticed that the shape of the kara age was suspiciously similar to what I tried before, and more importantly, it was still not hot for something that had just been fried. Having also had their tempura as the main dish, I don't think they have the right batter for all their tempura, which was really disappointing, especially for an upscale kaiseki place. Moreover, I also think their oil isn't fresh enough as all the fried items were rather stale, again, for an upscale kaiseki place. Risotto was okay (truffle anything is really hard to mess up), and sukiyaki was also okay, but both kind of meh.I don't think I'll be going back to this place, except for the sushi. But even that, I feel like there are good and less expensive ones in the city. It was disappointing.",0,1,0,Kay Y.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,3,0

1.0,1/28/2019,"Totally not a good experience. I came for restaurant week.  The menu has appetizers, main course and desert.  We waited very long, and the main course come out first??? So she took it back and we wait again, finally the appetizers is here but then they taste like it already made for a while because they are not hot.So we wait again, main course is here, sukiyaki and shrimp tempura. The pot of sukiyaki as I know it is very hot BUT the waitress did not mention anything... and the Tempura is soo oily and again they are not hot...Also want to mention about the rice, it is extremely dry it taste like the rice not yet done and it is not hot again, they put rice in the bamboo container ahead of time. So end up because of all waiting and mess up the order, they gave a free desert to us which I appreciated. But overall experience is not good. As a high end Japanese restaurant the waiting time of food, the time manage to serve the food, the service, and the quality of food that should not be like what I experienced.  As I seen not because I am ordered the restaurant week menu which got bad experience, I can see the next tables they are waiting long time for food too.",1,1,0,Joyce W.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",1,6,12
3.0,1/27/2019,"This review is solely based on the restaurant week experience.Seeing that this establishment had so many fantastic reviews, I decided to come here with my bf for our anniversary and birthday dinner. Lovely interior, like all the pics on yelp show- simplistic, lots of wood, cute little zen garden to gaze at during your meal. Music is soft but sometimes eclectic. I find myself confused when the eclectic music came on cause it felt cluttered which was different from what the interior suggests. We ordered the restaurant week menu and we ordered the soft shell crab, nigiri sushi, matcha tiramisu, daifuku, and they gave us complimentary matcha anmitsu. The soft shell crab was delicious but left us wanting more. When our entree of nigiri sushi arrived, my boyfriend and I felt disappointed. The fish was fresh but there was an unequal amount of wasabi placed under each fish. My boyfriend had a few pieces of sushi with so much wasabi and I had an underwhelming amount of wasabi (I didn't even notice it). Some pieces felt so overpowered by the wasabi that we couldn't appreciate the fish. Very anti-climatic starting the meal with a fantastic appetizer then served fish that was overpowering and not special. The desserts were quite nice, the matcha tiramisu had a wonderful texture. The daifuku served was only half a daifuku, which I definitely would have preferred a full one. I understand the pricing of the RW menu was less than their other kaiseki courses, but being served half a dessert was odd. Overall the meal left our palate and stomach unsatisfied. We had no wait time, they sat us right after we entered the establishment. Service was nice, our waitress was attentive and kind. I can't complain about their service but there was nothing spectacular either. I would not suggest coming here for restaurant week. Maybe if you're willing to splurge on the Naoki Kaiseki set then you might have a nice meal. Maybe.",6,3,2,Jodie Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",159,74,679

Lol please bring in a empty stomach to try. Bluefin tuna tartare was great to start with, very rich and fresh. I think the most impressive dish to me was soba risotto, fist time to try it in Japanese style, was small portion but taste was great, very rich with the truffle oil. The king crab and Washu beef was okay, I can taste little bit burn on the beef, maybe we took too long to eat it. My bf said the black cod looked sad just becoz it was on a black plate, kinda surprise us once we try it, the flavor was very rich don't know how to explain, but i think this one is better then the washu beef and king crab. For the A5 wygu beef sukiyaki, you cooked it with very heavy flavor soup, and then dip into egg, the beef was very soft. I just love it. Overall was great!!

1.0,12/7/2018,"Such a disappointment! I'm visiting from out of town and decided to take myself out for a beautiful Japanese dinner but was horrified with how the handled my gluten intolerance. After sitting there for over 20 minutes while the server went back and forth between myself and the kitchen relaying second-hand information while the staff talked about the ""allergy person"" loudly, I eventually ended up leaving the restaurant without ordering. It's 2018! If you are operating a restaurant and can't figure out how to make a few substitutions on your tasting menu with an allergy without humiliating your guests than you need to get out of the restaurant business!Update: I was not offered a gluten free menu as the owner stated in his reply. Additionally, a suggestion that one should somehow know to inform a restaurant way ahead of time of an allergy before assuming that they can dine there is not only arrogant, but also completely unrealistic. This is not a peanut allergy in which I might die. It's a damn gluten intolerance. Smh",1,1,0,Becca B.,"Grass Valley, CA",0,21,13
5.0,12/6/2018,"4.5My fiancé and I had an amazing and romantic 6th anniversary dinner at Naoki Takahashi Sunday evening. We arrived about five minutes early and were seated immediately for our 6:30pm reservation (made via yelp). Upon entry, the restaurant was relatively unoccupied and we were able to choose our own table, secluded behind the garden area. Of the 5 or so tables in the section we were the only customers there for the duration of our stay, and we greatly enjoyed the privacy. We chose the $128 naoki tasting, which I originally thought you were unable to choose unless you booked a certain time in advance. However, it seems like the naoki tasting is always being offered along side the $98 chef tasting. The only difference between the two seems to be that instead of one entree, you get two entrees and are able to choose your three pieces of sushi to be served after the entree. Additionally, the a5 wagyu sukiyaki does not have a +$20 additional charge with the naoki as I does with the chef's tasting.For my entrees I selected lobster tempura and a5 wagyu sukiyaki. My fiancé also ordered the sukiyaki (as it seems to be the most bang for your buck) but chose the black cod for his other entree. We also got two orders of matcha tea ($5/cup) which is prepared table-side with matcha powder, hot water, and a chasen (tea whisk). We started with ootoro tartare topped uni and caviar - a little fishy than what I have come to expect from ootoro but overall a good start to the meal. After that we both got kaiseki baskets (personally, my favorite part). Our baskets came with monkfish chawanmushi (steamed egg custard), soft shell crab tempura, poached tomatoes in honey, steamed broccoli, okra and green beans with sesame dressing, picked salmon with green onion, and assorted fall veggies incl. lotus root, taro, and shishito pepper. The stand-out for me was the soft shell crab tempura which was quite meaty and crispy. Note that a kaiseki style restaurant like Naoki must master a variety of different food preparations, so although the tempura was not the best I've ever had, it was still tasty and lighter than what you may normally find of tempura in the US.We also had assorted seasonal sashimi, truffle mushroom and beef soup (very strong, very umami), our entrees (lobster was a little starchy, but black cod was excellent), a5 sukiyaki (good but not nearly as good as the ~$30 sukiyaki next to Kyoto station), our choice of three nigiri, and finally, complimentary ice cream mochi dessert!Overall, I was very impressed by the breadth of dishes, but felt that the raw fish wasn't exceptional. If I were to rate the food alone, for the price, I would give 4 stars. However, due the excellent, warm service we received, I give Naoki a 4.5/5! Our server was incredibly friendly, explained our dishes thoroughly, and answered any questions that we had. Upon bringing out the free dessert and seeing that my fiancé had gone to the bathroom, she decided to wait behind a corner for him to come out before bringing the mochi, so that it would be more of a surprise! Really appreciate the thought that goes into the little gestures of consideration.Thank you Naoki Takahashi for a great anniversary meal!",3,0,0,Christina H.,"Potomac, MD",466,111,163

It was missing that wow factor, especially at that price point. For the appetizer platter, a lot of the vegetables were tasteless and lacking flavor. The king crab was good but plain and not special - I wish there was some sort of glaze or sauce to accompany it. The Wagyu sukiyaki was way too salty and basically felt like a bunch of ingredients drenched in soy sauce. It also didn't come with rice - I had to order that separately.

3.0,9/19/2018,"First off, I love the space. Tucked away on 17th St., you descend slightly down some stairs into a narrow pathway into a discrete entrance, which I later remembered was the same as my old happy hour favorite, Sueños, which Naoki took over and beautifully transformed. The stone garden is worth fighting for the bench seating for so you can spend your meal looking at.My friend and I did the Naoki tasting, which has a large amount of food with courses that can easily take you past 2 hours depending on your pace of eating. Amuse bouche, appetizer assortment, risotto, sashimi, choice of entree, sushi and soup. We were plenty full by the end of it.The risotto and sashimi were among my favorites. Overall I felt the balance of seasonings were a bit off. The sukiyaki was too sweet, and the chawanmushi egg custard and sushi were not salty enough.At ~$100, I think the price is good for getting a nice meal and a large variety of food and options but the lack of seasoning or anything special to set it apart from other restaurants wouldn't make me rush to come back.

5.0,9/19/2018,"Copy of my review from the Chef Naoki Takahashi Tasting Course yelp page as it overlaps:Wow. Just wow! First off, this restaurant is beautiful. Simple yet elegant! The service was impeccable. Our waiter (I think his name was Chris...) was super attentive, so informative about the food and sake. My best friend and I just had a wonderful time enjoying our sake and the Chef Naoki Takahashi tasting menu. So glad I made these reservations through yelp, especially since they only offer it to one table per night so we felt super special!The presentation of the food was just as beautiful as the restaurant. Everything was placed perfectly and looked almost too pretty to eat. But of course we ate it. We literally ate everything! We started off with the a sake flight and tuna tartare. A perfect start to our foodie adventure and my best friend's bday celebrations. We made three choices of sake by the waiter's very informative rundown of 6 sakes, from mild to dry. The tuna was nicely sliced, very fresh. The sauce was light with a good amount of salt to accent the tuna. So beautifully presented and delicious! Then the Hassun (basket of appetizers) which included a bunch of small bites but here's a few highlights: I had some of the best broccoli I have ever ate. It was so simple, topped with some carrot paste sauce on top of cooked kale but it was phenomenal. Their corn tofu with soy milk sauce was out of this world. The tofu was silky smooth and the corn sung beautifully in the tofu.Then the soba rice risotto with truffle. Amazing. Because we got the chef's tasting menu, it was topped with scallops. Yum! The truffle flavor was the highlight. The risotto was super al dente. A great combination.Sashimi - another beautiful presentation of food, all the slices on top a big plate of ice with side garnishes coupled with the sashimi. The fish was super fresh. Entrée - we shared the grilled king crab and the wagyu beef sukiyaki. The sukiyaki was nicely but not overly sweet. Wagyu had great marbling. The king crab was so worth it. It had like an uni spread cooked on top of it. So good and plentiful. Sushi - another great set of fish. The rice was cooked perfectly and there wasn't so much of it that it overpowered the fish which was great. Dessert - We ended with dessert which included their black sesame pudding with little gold flakes on top which I absolutely loved. The black sesame flavor was prominent and the pudding tasted like crème brulee custard, milky and creamy. Perfect pairing with the black sesame. We also go this Nutella like cake of some sort. Not sure what it was but really good as well. The best part to all of it was that it was my best friend's birthday so they added a candle to the dessert and sang happy birthday to her. It was really sweet. They also gave her a beautiful bouquet of flowers but think it was because the restaurant was celebrating their one year. Regardless it was so nice!!!!Overall, it was an amazing experience. We were stuffed by the end. Actually we were stuffed by the sashimi haha but we just had to eat every bite. So good!

4.0,9/12/2018,"Expected more from a $$$$, although I went for lunch. I think it's totally reasonable to calibrate lunch experience to dinner experience (food quality and service, not ambiance, of course).There weren't really many choices for lunch but the two set menu, no a la carte. Both of us picked the better of the two (HANAKAGO BRUNCH) and one carafe of Dassai 39. The place is known for its yama kaiseki style in baskets, very authentic. As one would imagine, the dinner menu should be even more eye-popping, sadly we don't have that selection for lunch.Its sashimi and tempura were outstanding although I suspect the wasabi to be synthetic. The black cod and duck skewers were good too although my friend mentioned it being a little cool and fishy (eat it first). The mushroom rice in the wooden bowl was fine as I expected a little more mushroom and flavor. Now, the appetizers were a little cheap: steamed broccoli, pepper, and pickled kora and diced pumpkin. We both expected more from a $$$$ even if it's a brunch menu.Dassai 39 was just what it is: don't get the cup, but the carafe (pours 6 cups).Be sure to ask about the chef's tasting menu and the garden seats.

Their sashimi and sushi offerings are also decent but don't expect a full sushi bar. The restaurant's concept is more focused on more every-day cuisines in Japan.

It wouldn't stuff your belly like a typical American brunch place does, if that's what you are going for. Both courses had 4 pieces of sashimi, and a verity of tempura along with other vegetables. One of them included tempura don. The rice was mixed with assorted mushrooms. Loved.

It began with a basket of appetizers which had a selection of small dishes. They were a little bland tasting but worked up my appetite so I think that is the point? Next came the risotto that uses Soba rice which was delicious. After that came the sashimi which had 6 pieces of super fresh fish. I only wish they gave me more. Next was the main course, which I opted for the Beef Sukiyaki. The beef was excellent being super tender and fatty.

The tasting menu was a mix of favorite Japanese categories - sukiyaki and Japanese cod, sashimi, sushi and various pickled and fried vegetables. We ordered dessert separately - a black sesame pudding. Pretty tasty but also not as good as similar I've had elsewhere. While I felt everything was fine, nothing stood out. As a result, the tasting menu and experience as a whole felt pretty mediocre.

They have a gorgeous zen garden and skylights. The bar showcases the many sakes they have. Naoki only has two things on the menu ( naoki tasting and chefs tasting menu) as it is kaiseki based restaurant. What is Kaiseki? It is a traditional japanese multi course meal with a mix of hot food and cold food (sashimi and sushi). Both tastings you get a choice of one entree and one sushi dish. The difference between naoki tasting and chefs tasting is that the naoki tasting is more premium and offers slightly more food. I tried the Naoki tasting and there was a total of 6 courses. Each dish was amazing and presented like art- with the beautiful plates and presentation. The first course was the amuse and it was tasty egg pudding. The second course was hussun which was a platter with a bunch of small dishes. This platter was so pretty!! The third course was truffle risotto and I love anything truffle. The fourth dish was sashimi, again it was arranged so beautifully. The star of the night was definitely the premium wagyu sukiyaki. The wagyu melted in my mouth and dipping sauce was super flavorful. The course ended with sushi and it was super fresh. I ended the night with the black sesame pudding and strawberry daifuku. The strawberry daifuku was so unique as it had a sponge cake on the bottom. The black sesame pudding was amazing. It tasted like flan but with a intense sesame flavor. I loved it. Overall,  I would come back.

(2) a few hours after the meal, she got tremendously sick (probably due to the shellfish allergy) and was up all night and could not eat for the next 24+ hours. When we called in about this situation, the restaurant was very defensive. We spent many phone calls back and forth with no success of getting the restaurant to take responsibility for this allergy mishap/food poisoning. Completely unacceptable at a high-end restaurant like this one is trying to be Even without this terrible experience mentioned above, I thought the food fell far far short of any Kaiseki I had in Japan. Fyi, we ordered the $108 Naoki tasting. Unless you're staying at some cheap ryokan, this meal does not even get close to the amazing experience a ryokan would serve you. The wagyu sukiyaki was way too sweet. The risotto (dairy-based) according to my friend who doesn't have the dairy allergy was way too salty!  (I would've given this restaurant 3 stars if it wasn't for this ridiculous health episode + the way they handled it!) Since I knew I was going to be in New York for work, I spent some time weighing different restaurant options and I finally narrowed it down to here, Tempura Matsui, and Jean-Georges.

3.0,5/5/2018,"Tucked away on 17th street, it's easy to pass by Naomi Takahashi. Note that if you use Google Maps navigation to find the restaurant, it will say you've arrived a good couple feet before the entrance.I came here last week without a reservation around 7 PM and was able to get a spot. However, if you're coming with at least 2 people, it's better to make a reservation since the space seems quite small.I ordered the Naomi Testing for $108 and have mixed feelings about it. The first couple items they brought out were absolutely delicious. The egg custard was amazing and the risotto while not super appealing to the eye, was delicious and memorable.Unfortunately half way into the meal, my stomach started acting funny.

However when I got the sushi at the end of the meal it was quite disappointing. The fish did not taste or look super fresh.I was also compelled to get the green tea tiramisu since it looked so lovely in everyone's yelp photos. Unfortunately it was kind of a letdown.

Everything on the chef's tasting menu was unremarkable. There was not one dish that had a flaw. The service was superb as well. The biggest downside was the seating arrangement. Being in NYC, of course, space is limited but there were multiple empty tables but we were seated next to a loud pair. Our dinner was far from peaceful and having a conversation was difficult.

4.0,4/4/2018,"My friend took me to Naoki for my birthday. Upon entering, I was impressed by how zen, beautiful, and minimal the interior of the restaurant was. There's this beautiful view of Japanese trees and you just feel so at peace. The smell of the kitchen is amazing - for some reason, it reminded me of tempura and udon noodles.The waiter sits you down and hands you a warm towel (I love when they do this) then asks if you want something to drink. I wasn't feeling well so I ordered water and the matcha tea. They whisk the matcha tea in front of you and man it was quite delicious! Wish they gave you more than just a quarter cup though...serving size was quite small. It comes with a side of these Japanese sweets but I wasn't in the mood for it so my friend ate them. Their menu changes depending on the season and what's available during that season. We went end of March and ordered the Chef's Tasting Course. The basket of appetizers was delicious! An assortment of bite sized apps that included mochi and such. I wish I wrote everything down since their menu changes on a monthly basis. Next up was the Sobanomi Risotto with truffle oil -- my absolute favorite part of the meal. I wish it was a meal itself instead because the little bowl was not enough. Only reason why I even gave an extra star to make it 4 stars was because of this delicious risotto. Things were looking up after the risotto....until we go to our next course. The sashimi is seasonal. Ours included hamachi, tuna, oyster, and some others. It's a rather small portion but let me tell you, for a Japanese place you'd think the sashimi and sushi would be fresh but it was probably one of the worst pieces of sashimi I've had. It was hard to eat because it wasn't fresh at all. If the sashimi and sushi had been fresh then I would have definitely given the place all 5 stars.The main dish was next. We both ordered the Washu Beef Sukiyaki and it hit the spot! It was cold outside and I wanted something soupy. While this isn't a soup really since the base is too thick and sweet to be considered a soup, dipping the pieces of beef and eating it with the veggies and broth was the perfect combo. Tip: ask for the beef to be served raw and cooked it at the table in your broth.The last part of the meal was the miso soup and sushi. By this point, we were both dying of fullness but thankfully we weren't missing out on much because the sushi was not fresh at all....what so ever. Would I come back here? Probably not. If i'm going to shell out $100 on a tasting menu, I rather it be for Omakase.  Other than that, the service was slow but the waiter was super friendly.

5.0,1/24/2018,"The Naoki tasting menu is the way to go. Each course takes your eyes and tastebuds on a journey that you never want to end. When it does come to an unfortunate end, you're left full and satisfied. But then, there's dessert! They all sound great, and since we have a second stomach for dessert (or at least I do), I ordered all 4.",1,0,1,Tommy W.,"New York, NY",182,10,29
4.0,1/21/2018,"Beautiful indoor Zen Garden!!! The ambience is great for a romantic and quiet date! My boyfriend took me here for my birthday. I really had a great time here everything from the decor to service and to the food! We opt for the Tasting Menu which comes with Chuwanmushi, Assorted Appetizers, Mushroom Truffle Risotto, Assorted Sashimi and Oyster, Sukiyaki Wagyu Beef, Sushi Plate - Chutoro, Uni, and Snow Crab, and Clam Miso Soup. This was a great variety of food especially the fresh fishes! Loved it! Mushroom Truffle has a rich truffle taste and it was aromatic! I would probably skip the sukiyaki style next time but that's because I am not a sweet taste lover. The wagyu beef did melted in my mouth and I loved the texture! The fried blowfish from the appetizer basket was delicious! It was nicely fried and seasoning had good flavor! Chef's Tasting Menu changes every month!",5,5,5,Cynthia D.,"Queens, NY",498,888,6834

5.0,1/7/2018,"I went to Naoki with my family for my brother's birthday dinner. Upon entering, I was super impressed by how beautiful the restaurant was. We were seated in front of a window facing the Japanese rock garden, and it was such a zen ambiance.We all got the $108 Naoki tasting menu, which included:- Amuse: chawanmushi with grilled monkfish & dried mullet roe- Hanakago: a tray of a bunch of small appetizers. Some of my favorites were the snow crab stuffed mushroom and the kabocha.- Soba rice risotto with mushrooms and truffle oil: one of my favorites of the menu. It was different from typical risotto because the rice was thinner and soupier.- Sashimi: another favorite. We got tuna, scallop, salmon, yellowtail, and oyster. Every piece was super fresh, and the scallop was sweet, some of the best I've had.- Lobster ""wafu style"" aqua pazza: lobster, clams, cherry tomatoes, and cooked meat with a light broth poured on top. Unfortunately this was my least favorite dish.  The meat was really dry and didn't really complement the lobster.- Wagyu beef sukiyaki - this was another entree choice that I didn't order, but I sampled some of my mom's. The beef was really fatty and tender. It came with a poached egg on the side for dipping.- Sushi: I chose the uni, snow crab, and chu toro option, but they were out of snow crab so they swapped in unagi instead. All the nigiri was good, though nothing different from what you'd find at a sushi place.Overall, I enjoyed the food (other than the lobster) and left dinner feeling stuffed. Everything was presented beautifully. I would definitely recommend Naoki for dinner if you're looking for somewhere to splurge in a zen, intimate atmosphere.",4,0,1,Michelle L.,"New York, NY",423,287,2844
5.0,12/17/2017,"Ambiance: At first you might miss the entrance since the sign is small and you have to walk down the staircase to the restaurant. The environment emulates a Japanese minimalistic theme where the design and coloration is kept simple. There is also a mini zen garden in the middle of the restaurant. Overall the restaurant is on the dimmer side, but still comfortable and quiet.Food: Apparently they change up the menu quite often. I had their 5 course meal early in October so I can't remember what everything was in the pictures I attached. The first course was this assortment of smaller dishes each with very unique tastes. The second dish was this soup-based dish that I remember being light but had a lot of aroma due to the truffle oil. The third dish was a sashimi platter served over ice, which kept the sashimi at an optimal temperature. I found it interesting that they had gooseberry and mini-watermelons served on the side. My friend and I joked that we could eat a whole carton of those gooseberries. The fourth dish was our own pick of entrees. I chose the duck served with a roasted orange on the side. I have to admit that the duck was very well cooked as I'm not usually impressed by duck meat. The citrus complimented the duck and the sauce. The meat was tender that it melted in your mouth. Finally, the last dish was a plate of nigiri, which I don't recall being very special, but it was still good. Overall I would definitely come here again even for that price range as every dish was detailed and unique in its own way.

5.0,12/14/2017,"Kaiseki (traditional Japanese full course) meal that's one of the best in the city. I've tried another place (EN Japanese Brasserie), but it wasn't even close to how good the overall experience here was. EN Japanese Brasserie had all the bells and whistles along the lines of smoke covers and cook your own rice in a cute setup. However, the quality of everything here (from the sashimi to the truffle mushroom soup) was top notch. Also, it's not like they didn't provide display their food in extravagant ways either. My highlight of the meal was the gooseberry included with the sashimi. Can you believe that, of all things, the gooseberry. I've never eaten one in my life, but that was a delicious cherry on top of this sundae (I guess in this case sashimi haha).Meal Value (from 1-10, my measure of quantity/quality of the meal compared to price): 9Yes, this is pretty pricey for a meal in general, but compared to the normal price of Kaiseki in NYC, it's definitely a standout for what you receive in terms of both portion and quality.",1,0,0,Hung Yu C.,"Fremont, CA",57,64,100

5.0,11/6/2017,"Overall: 4.8/5This place let you experience the real Japanese fine dinning in New York City. And it does not disappoint! The price is fairly reasonable compared to a few other high end Japanese places that I've been to.Here are a few highlights from the Fall course-Appetizers course (HANAKAGO, small plates)      - Cherry tomatoes with yuzu flavor (great palate cleanser)       - String beans with sesame sauce (this dish is just so simple but so delicious, packed with umami flavors!)-Soba Rice Risottos with Mushrooms and truffle oil         This is heavenly. I never have soba rice before, kind of tastes like Barley. The truffle oil is more for the fragrance, not pronounce in taste.-SASHIMI        The tuna and salmon slices were sooooo good! Probably the best ones I have had in the states. It turns out that they are from Spain not from Japan.-A5 Japanese Wagyu Sukiyaki          There is a $20 supplement for this. The tofu is great and the umami of the Wagyu is to die for. However the beef portion is a bit small and I wish there are more veggies that come with the sukiyaki.-SUSHI & Soup         Again, the tuna here is the star. The scallop was interesting. Smoked salmon with yuzu doesn't really have a strong Smoke flavor that I was expecting. The miso soup was quite good, but I feel like the clam flavor could come through a little bit more-Surprised Birthday dessert         They also provide a nice birthday dessert! It was plated really well ( I think it was a mini-sampler of all of their dessert). The black sasame pudding was the best. The sweet potato creme brûlée was pretty creative.Service overall was great and attentive, not much to complain about over here.

4.0,10/24/2017,"This place is truly stunning. The garden in the middle is breathtaking and completely unexpected to find in the concrete jungle. The food is equally beautiful. A meal here is visually stunning, and no picture that I took does proper justice to the art that arrived on my plates. It's a legit 100 out of 100 for decor and presentation. The first plate that arrived was 9 small appetizer tastings (check out my pictures for the complete menu), which was highlighted by the tomatoes. Seriously. I never would have expected to say ""man, these are some amazing tomatoes,"" but man, these were some amazing tomatoes. The rest of the plate was tasty, but nothing else was really outstanding. The next plate to arrive was a soba rice mushroom risotto with truffle oil. It married Italian and Japanese flavors really well. It was a lighter, less creamy version than the typical Italian risotto. It was good, but not outstanding. Next came the sashimi plate. The sushi was after the main courses, but I'll group the sashimi and sushi together. If you've been to any proper sushi omakase, both the sushi and sashimi here will disappoint you. It's not anywhere near the same level of sushi or sashimi as any of the other well know sushi omakase places. On to the mains. My friends and I all shared the grilled black cod, the pan roasted duck, and the Japanese wagyu beef sukiyaki. All three were really excellent, but all three felt a bit on the small side. The cod was similar to some of the other miso black cod dishes at other well known places; rich and buttery and a little sweet. The duck was cooked really nicely in an orange, sweet teriyaki sauce with scallions. It's a bit of a riff off of duck a l'orange and the scallions evoke memories of Peking duck. The sukiyaki was super thinly sliced and simmered is a mildly sweet sauce. The texture of the beef was reminiscent of gyu don... but the most tender version you've ever had. I'd give the appetizers 3.5 stars, the sushi 2 stars, and the mains 5 stars. Overall the food here is a 3.5, and at an $80 price tag, I didn't leave too disappointed with what I got for what I paid. Not sure I'll be back here again, but the beauty of the restaurant itself, the artistic care to the plating of each dish, and the excellence of the main dishes make it worth visiting once.",6,2,2,Dave F.,"Hoboken, NJ",429,633,1392

As she won't eat raw fish, she had the vegetarian tasting menu, but substituted the salmon for the entree.  I had the blacked cod served with a creamy miso and young peach, and it may have ruined me for this dish elsewhere.

The fishes of sushi plate are definitely from better source or having better quality control comparing with what you could expect from sushi Nakazawa. Since I cannot take any eel due to my food allergy, I asked them to change that and they did it without any hesitation though I forgot to mention that before the plate coming. Also, I like the way they serve. Not that attentive as other restaurants in the same field. It's really nice as they introduce each arty dishes carefully without being a too attentive robots and make you feel pressured.

4.0,8/6/2017,"Overall the experience was alright but there's definitely room for improvement. The service was alright but not too attentive and nice. I tried the tasting menu and thought it was great in general. The first dish was a combination of small dishes. Nothing left a big impression for me, but the miso eggplant was too oily and salty in my opinion. Next we had a small sea food risotto which tasted great. The sashimi was super fresh both the salmon and tuna melted in my mouth. Definitely a 10/10!! For the entree we upgraded 20 dollars for the wagyu sukiyaki. The taste was good, but a bit overcooked. I absolutely enjoyed the sushi at the end. The fish was super fresh, but the sushi rice was not really good..The rice didn't seem to hold together but the fish was fresh! In the end we were served with complimentary dessert because they were making a dessert menu. They brought us a sweet spring roll, vanilla ice cream and a chocolate fudge thing... it all tasted fine but I just found it really boring and very different from the rest of the menu. Since the experience was really japanese throughout the whole course, the desserts were really western?(don't know if that's a good word to describe it). I was expecting anmitsu or a green tea parfait, or japanese daifuku for dessert but instead received vanilla ice cream and chocolate fudge.. it was just kind of weird... But it was free at least!! I told the waiter what I thought since I thought he would like some feedback after serving us complimentary dessert, although I did say my words very nicely I am not too sure he liked my extra opinions.Food was alright environment was super nice.

3.0,7/26/2017,"Cuisine: 5Service: 6Decor: 10Value: 4Overall: 6Aaaaaargh! I really wanted to love this place and therefore dined there on grand opening night. The restaurant design is very unique and thoughtful. However, the food was just not up to standard compared to other high end Japanese establishments around NYC. Ultimately, for that reason, I will have to wait and see if it's worth a return visit in the future.When you arrive at the restaurant, it has a beautiful, somewhat ""hidden"" entrance that opens your imagination to an exciting experience to follow. Then, as you walk into the dining space, your eyes are drawn to the lovely zen garden behind the glass walls. For a relatively small restaurant, they decided to go for aesthetics over maximizing the patron space. I applaud them for that because the decor is definitely one of my favorite restaurant designs in all of NYC.Unfortunately the cuisine did not match the fantastic ambiance. Their menu is set up as a $80 prefix for five courses, with entree being the only one that had three choices (Grilled Black Cod, Wild Range Chicken Tatsuta, Beef Sukiyaki). Here is a rundown course by course and how I would rate each item.1. Hanakago (Basket of Appetizers) - 3/10. Disappointing for such a pretty display. There were definitely no wow's but certainly a few duds. For example, I know that they served lobster as an entree the day before from fellow Yelp reviewer, so it makes sense that we received a Lobster Ceviche using the claw. Unfortunately, check my picture and you will see that my app was made with mostly the tips of a lobster claw and not the meat, which sucked majorly. Another example is the stale tasting bread that came with the Unagi Sandwich. I doubt they are using inferior bread on grand opening night, yet it can be way better for sure. Lastly, the fried bass was extremely overcooked, felt liked it came from a can. I think the main problem is everything needed to be served together, as well as for many patrons, hence many items lacked the proper timing for it to be served at its peek freshness.2. Salad - 5/10. The sesame dressing was very good, but so is the Kewpie brand I buy in Japanese supermarkets. Not bad. Nothing special. 3. Sashimi - 9/10. Love the gorgeous plating. All the crowd pleasers were present, along with some cool accompaniments. The Hotate (scallop) was tender and sweet, Otoro (fatty tuna) was extremely buttery, Ikura (salmon roe) was a bit of salty goodness, while the Hokkaido Uni (sea urchin) was rich and creamy. One of two best dishes of the night.4. Entree - 9/10. Paid extra $20 for the A5 Japanese Wagyu Sukiyaki. Definitely worth the upgrade. The beef was super tender while the sauce was intensely flavorful. I would get this course again if they had it a la carte. The other highlight of our meal. Btw, bowl of rice costed me an additional $5. Maybe the climax of the meal, but costly.5. Sushi & Soup - 0/10. Could not even eat this course. The two pieces of Conger Eel were fishy. Never had fishy eel before. Other two pieces were Washu Beef, which looked terrible and not appetizing at all. Check out my pictures for reference. Not sure what happened, though my best guess is that it's been prepared too far ahead and the beef oxidized to create that unsavory color. Maybe they can trick novices, but you have to expect that majority of your customers on opening night would be Japanese food veterans. Lastly, the rice was made by a press rather than by hand (I asked and the server confirmed with the kitchen). The rice was also cold, another mistake likely due to it being prepared way ahead of time to keep up with the many courses they have to serve. Not sure which is more of a crime, but both are unforgivable when it comes to the preparation of sushi rice. Yuck! Utterly disgusted!Finally, we decided to order desserts in order to remove the previous sushi course from our memory. We got the Matcha Tiramisu (served in a cute wooden box, good flavor, a bit too sweet) and the Black Sesame Panna Cotta (excellent video worthy presentation, black sesame flavor was too light). If I were scoring this course, then it would be a 7/10.The service was on and off, similar to the food. It was friendly but at times absent when we were searching for assistance. Part of it has to do with the odd shape of the rooms, causing the servers to have nowhere to stand to properly see guests seeking help. It is also somewhat understandable since it's opening night. I just hope they figure it out soon. I pray that they get their act together, or at least offer a la carte option one day. I really love the restaurant decor. But until other facets of the dining experience can be fixed, I will probably stay away.",5,0,0,Gordon Y.,"Rego Park, NY",562,237,1376

The beef marble was also not even which made it harder to eat. I do not recommend paying the extra $20 for this quality of beef.",1,0,0,Shirley L.,"Emeryville, CA",14,25,21
5.0,7/19/2017,"So good.  I mentioned this restaurant to a friend visiting from out of town and he jumped at the idea, luckily for me:) I didn't know where to start on the first course.  There was a cluster of small portions including soup, fish, vegetables, etc.  My favorite was a caramelized eggplant dish.  The second course was a risotto, which I heard is a better substitute to the salad that has been previously offered.  The third course was a plate of sashimi which didn't disappoint.  For my entrée I decided to try the steak which I highly recommend.  They cook the steak on the table right in front of you.  I was so satisfied with the steak that I forgot there was a fifth course of sushi and soup, but was glad for the palate change at the end. If you are into desserts then the apple pie is absolutely necessary!",2,0,0,Abi C.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,2,0
4.0,7/18/2017,"TL;DR Food 4.5 /5  Service 5/5  Overall 4.7 What a foodie adventure at Naoki last Sunday evening! I took my friend who just moved to the city here for dinner. We both got blown away. And my foodie reputation is now further solidified :)The space itself is airy and tranquil. We opted for a table looking into the zen garden, perfect. They are currently offering seasonal tasting menu only at $80 /pp, which I consider a great value given the quality/quantity of food. Plus, I am lazy, just serve me the best you have ! We started off with Hanagako - appetizer course. What a banquette of summer seasonal greetings! Starting top(see pic) : crab ceviche with refreshing lime and yuzu; purée edamame cream soup with #radish and asparagus; spinach goma-ae aka spinach in sesame sauce ; lotus  root tempura with stuffed shrimp accompanied with eatable flowers ; grilled unagi aka freshwater eel avocado mini ""sandwich""(rice cracker) ; corn tofu topped with ikura (salmon roe). Last not least, my fave - nanbanzuke! fried sea bass marinated in citrus vinegar sauce. Each dish were bite size and deliver distinct tastes and textures yet all conjured harmoniously like a symphony. The plating was a joy to appreciate as well! Second course was some salad(?) ... too busy catch up with my friend :/Came sashimi, another highlight of tonight. Assorted selection of fresh cut of fish including salmon, yellow tail, yellowfintuna, Japanese mackerel, scallop. ikura (again, salmon roe) and freshly shucked oyster !! Accompanied with grated wasabi. Mind you, this was freshly made in house at the time, not the phony green paste come in a tube :P  Oyishi!!Entree was the only course you could chose. I opted for the washu beef sukiyaki while friend opted for the saikyo cod. Both were oh-so-good! If I had to choose, I might go with the cod. But that is  becuz I am a seafood lover. The beef was good tho wish was less done. They would show you the beef. Then served it ping-ping hot on a sizzling cast iron pan. Fun! Love the sweet and savory sukiyaki sauce. I made it at home sometimes- mirin, sake, soysauce and sugar. Would be more fun if we could cook it ourselves :)Last course was sushi. Came with 3 pieces - salmon, grilled eel, flash-grilled washu beef and uni. My favorite piece was the sea eel - scrumptious and savory. Accompany with miso soup. At the end of the dinner, we were full and decided not going for any dessert. I think the portion was perfect. I have made my next reservation. And so should you :)",3,0,1,Nomad M.,"New York, NY",126,298,1138
5.0,7/15/2017,Thank you Naoki. I had a very satisfying dinner. it keeps reminding me the super nice dining experience in Japan with high quality food and excellent customer service. This place will be very popular very soon. Tasting meaning is a must try. Highly recommended to go there before it becomes over crowded.,1,0,3,Y H.,"Forest Hills, NY",0,8,0
5.0,7/9/2017,Food and service were both excellent. Very low key atmosphere which I liked. The 5 course meal was more than enough food to satisfy any hungry person.Highly recommend.,3,0,1,Jung R.,"Manhattan, NY",176,13,0
2.0,7/8/2017,"Came here on the day of their opening, and tried to make reservations in person for the same night and got turned down saying the place was fully booked. Not even minute later my husband made reservation through opentable for 8.30 without any troubles. We had the pre fix menu, my husband choose chicken for main and I had a steak. First course was a basket with 8 appetizers. Nothing that I was too crazy about, one of the appetizers was a mini sandwich, the bread was stale and clearly very old. Another one was a cream of edamame, completely tasteless and another one was a cured fish that was so dry and without any taste either. For the second course we got salad with sesame dressing. The dressing was good, but the greens that were served were clearing not fresh since they had brown spots in them. For the third course we had plate of raw fish which was tasty. Fourth course was our main, my husband got served chicken on a hot plate which was over cooked and super dry. Fifth course was sushi and soup. Soup was great, sushi was disgusting. They serve steak sushi that's borderline inedible and the other one was with a fish I can't remember but it was very fishy and overcooked. Not to mention staff forgot to bring the soup and brought it to the table after we asked for a check. Overall the meal was overpriced and unsatisfactory. Would not recommend, they are much better Japanese restaurants in the neighborhood.",3,3,0,Petra S.,"New York, NY",3,2,0
5.0,7/8/2017,Leaving a placeholder here as I've got a reservation for tonight to check this place out. Just a heads up to everyone that it's now a 5-course tasting menu instead of the 4-course shown. Guess they're just as excited for this opening as I am!,5,0,0,Henry Y.,"New York, NY",376,801,1
5.0,7/7/2017,"I was invited to the soft opening by my boss and it was the first time I have ever tried something like this. The first course had 8 small portions all put in one large woven tray. Each one was more flavorful than the last. The second course you get to choose. I chose the tempura which I kind of regret because that you can kind of get in any other Japanese restaurant. The people that I dined with chose items that came in some kind of clay pot which was very interesting. Next course you also get to choose. Being that I love lobster, naturally that was what I went with. It was AMAZINGG. Super super tasty. Presentation wise though there was too much salt. In the picture all the white part is salt and I feel bad for it to go to waste. Last course was a sushi dish. This dish doesnt come with soy sauce but it does have pickled ginger. I wasn't too crazy about this last one but the shapes and designs were interesting. Lastly, desserts! (This isn't included with the prefixed course set.) We ordered every dessert and rotated them around the table and took a bit of each. The most interesting one to me was the tear drop. Service was very attentive and friendly. The servers kept refilling our glasses and brought wine, beer and sake very quickly. Their sake carafes are very small though!Food time. Being that it was the very first day of their opening we didnt mind but the wait times for the next courses were pretty long.But the food here was amazing nonetheless. Cant wait to go back!!",4,1,2,Sandy P.,"Queens, Queens, NY",56,96,205
