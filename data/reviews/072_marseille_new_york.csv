4.0,4/28/2019,"Finally made it back to the city and to Marseille for Brunch.  As I suspected when I first came here based on the quality of the drinks, atmosphere, service and menu options, the Brunch was fantastic.  All 3 of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals and drinks.  The dishes were well prepared, cooked and seasoned just right, and TASTY.  The service was spot on and un-rushed, our waiter was fantastic and pleasant.  We were dropped a fruit plate by accident by one of the food runners and the waiter said to enjoy on the house.  The noise level here is great, you can carry on a conversation without having to yell at each other. Will definitely be back again to try some of the other menu items.",8,2,4,Fred B.,"Collingswood, NJ",144,122,5235

5.0,4/22/2019,"I had the most wonderful experience at Marseille! We were seated immediately when we arrived around 5pm at a gorgeous spot near the windows. We ordered the sangria and rosé spritz to start which came almost immediately. The sangria was strong and the rosé was light and well... spritzy! We got two breadsticks covered in everything bagel seasoning with butter in EVOO literally two seconds before our risotto appetizer came. Unfortunately the breadsticks were a bit too rough for me to eat but my friend didn't seem to mind. The risotto came out, with a beautiful yellow colored cream surrounding the risotto. I complemented the dish to the server because it was so amazing, and he told me that the dish changes with the season but the saffron always remain an integral part of the dish. Next we got our chicken grand-mere and spring pasta. YOU GUYS. MY GOD THIS WAS SO GOOD. The chicken was beautifully crisped, the potato gratin was delicious, the string beans were buttery, and the roasted garlic wasn't too strong in flavor so we even ate the cloves! The spring pasta was a light dish with a hint of spicyness. We actually realized it has pancetta, and I had mentioned to the server that the only meat I ate was chicken. We asked if it was indeed pancetta and he immediately took it back and brought out a fresh dish and the kitchen was so kind as to add chicken into it instead. For dessert, we ordered the profiterole which was huge and came with chocolate sauce on the side for us to pour over. The ice cream was delicious and it was soft and flaky! It was my first time having profiteroles and this was truly phenomenal. All in all a great meal and a great time.",0,0,0,Shweta G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",242,29,63

Although it gets very crowded, the service is good, as they know many folks are heading to see shows, but they certainly don't rush you. Beautiful decor as well.

4.0,4/9/2019,"Overall, had a really great meal here. Though I wasn't super impressed with the drinks available at brunch, all of the food was really delicious. The French onion soup is to die for, and the lobster tails, though very expensive, are delicious and well prepared. The lox bagel was very fresh and tasty, and the steak and eggs wasn't bad, but I wouldn't order it again. The desserts were delightful- especially the creme brulee! Service was prompt and friendly, and the overall atmosphere of the restaurant is really beautiful, with people bustling inside and out, it's an awesome place to sit and enjoy a meal.

A little bland but perfectly cooked. Potatoes were good as well. Dessert, the apple tart, was good. I had a margarita but I don't usually drink so I have nothing else to say other than I enjoyed it and finished it.

5.0,3/10/2019,"Made a reservation here for brunch at 1pm on a Sunday. Even though the restaurant was still pretty busy and my friend was running a couple minutes late, the hostess still seated me right away (not sure if this was a fluke because some other groups seemed to have to wait until their whole party arrived). After we ordered, the waitress brought us complimentary bread--delicious raisin bread and mini carrot muffins. Thought it was nice touch and step up from plain sourdough or french bread that restaurants typically provide. I ordered the crab and egg bruschetta and it was delicious. Usually restaurant dishes that feature seafood in combination with other ingredients skimp on the seafood, but there was a relatively generous portion of crab meat. The green onions and sour cream incorporated in the egg made the dish so rich and creamy, which was perfectly complemented by the bread and light side salad with minimal dressing. My friend and I stayed for quite a while catching up and the waiters and waitresses never rushed us and were very attentive in refilling our waters, which I appreciated (probably helped that the brunch frenzy had well died down by the time we left).Going to see a show with my roommate in a month and I will definitely try to come back and try the dinner menu here!",0,0,0,Jennifer Z.,"New York, NY",0,3,0

2.0,3/3/2019,"So I've eaten here numerous times, usually for brunch. I really like the California omelette and the moules frites for dinner. My major complaint is that there are serious problems on the service end: on two separate occasions within the last six weeks I've eaten here and the kitchen has somehow failed to deliver one of the dishes to someone in my party, resulting in one diner waiting 20-30 minutes after the others received their plates to get their meal. In addition, it's almost impossible to figure out who to ask for requests -- despite a plentiful wait staff, requests for stuff like ketchup often take five minutes or longer to arrive. Not sure what the deal is, but the service here is particularly disorganized -- could be miscommunication between the front of house and the kitchen, poor training of the wait staff, or understaffing. It makes me think twice about coming back to what should be a neighborhood favorite.",0,0,0,a b.,"New York, NY",0,16,0

So I went for lunch and the food was absolutely horrible. We got the seafood burger and the crab meat salad. Tried ordering the goat cheese tart but they were out of it. Looking back, I'm glad we didn't waste any more money on their food. Service was ok. They had plenty of seatings. So the food: I can eat and I eat a lot. I never leave food on my plate but I couldn't even finish half of the seafood burger because it was gross and my husband's salad was mediocre at best.

3.0,2/20/2019,Myself and a friend had brunch here while in Hell's Kitchen. The food was great but a bit on the pricey side. The service was a little slow but the restaurant wasn't too full. I don't think it was the server more so the kitchen. I ordered the short rib polenta dish and it was super flavorful but a bit cold. I hate sending food back so I proceeded to eat it this way. We shared the French toast which was delicious but again was kind of luke warm. Those are my only complaints but the food is tasty.

This restaurant deserves more than 5 stars!Service - 5 StarsFrom the moment we stepped inside, we experienced great service. We got there about 15 mins before our reservation. I was expecting to wait a little bit as it was very busy since it was Valentine's Day, but instead they seated us right away. They gave us the menus and poured a glass of water for each of us as soon as we sat down. The waiter never rushed us to order but he did not ignore us either. As soon as we decided, he was there to take our order. Food came out amazingly quick. Did not have to wait long for a single dish. They had a small dessert with a birthday candle for my girlfriend. They gave me the check when we were ready to go. Food - 5 StarsEvery was délicieux. My girlfriend ordered from the Valentine's Day prix fixe menu. She had the scallops, filet mignon and the Valentine's Day parfait. I had the escargot, New York strip and the creme brûlée. Everything was amazing and the steaks were cooked and seared to perfection. The prices were very reasonable too. Ambiance - 5 Stars One word, Romantic. Only complaint from my girlfriend is that the scallops should be a part of the a la carte menu and not only for Valentine's Day. She really enjoyed the scallops and wished she could have ordered it again. I want to thank the restaurant for giving us such a wonderful memory!",0,0,0,Allen Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",58,14,3

5.0,2/4/2019,"I was very excited to dine at Marseille and finally had the chance to on Sunday. My friend and I decided to try out their brunch menu since it was highly recommended by a bunch of my blogger friends. The restaurant itself was stunning and very detailed to say the least. The staff was kind, well mannered, courteous, and just flat out amazing. Our waitress, Christina, was amazing as well and she even suggested a few menu items that I happily enjoyed. They have an amazing bottomless mimosas for $19 and trust me it's worth every penny. The drinks we had were a pomegranate mimosa and a regular mimosa. Both drinks were nicely garnished and a little strong just how I like it. For an appetizer, I had the french onion soup which I would highly recommend! The broth was flavorful, had a good amount of cooked onions inside, and lots of cheese. We ordered three entrees and they were all delicious! The entrees were steak with eggs and fries; short rib on a bed of polenta and fried onions; and their infamous french toast. The steak was cooked perfectly, eggs were delicious and far from dry; and the fries were nicely crisped. The short rib had a sweet wine sauce on it which I enjoyed and the polenta was tasty too. The french toast was probably the best I've ever had! They definitely used a high quality toast and can definitely tell a difference. The french toast was in a sweet banana foster like sauce that I absolutely loved!  They placed fresh berries and pecans that were juicy. I loved every meal and you will too.",4,0,2,Vanessa J.,"West Orange, NJ",182,200,485

5.0,1/4/2019,"I like this restaurant a whole lot. The food three to five stars, but the atmosphere is perfect and the service is lovely. And their bar is excellent. Dined here NYE.  Whereas some restaurants are mob scenes and have limited menus on 12/31, they let you order à la carte at their normal prices.The restaurant is a lovely oasis on 9th Avenue - decorated in classic French bistro style.  Tables are well spaced, unlike in many Manhattan restaurants.I started with a KIR. It was perfect, the epitome of a good kir - plus it had a really delicious lemon peel, which elevated it.Appetizers:  Sweetie got French onion soup and liked it.  I got the TUNA TARTARE. I'm sorry to say that, though NY Yelpers have praised this dish, it was rather boring for me. It was certainly inoffensive. But tuna tartare is a super trite dish in San Diego, and I've had so many playful spins, with so many different oils and flavors. This was definitely fresh, but it was quite bland - just the tuna and avo, plus a few dabs of meh sauce on the plate.  Not what I expect at Marseille, and less good than at almost any place at home.Entrees:  On the advice of our excellent server (a charming man from Morocco whose name I don't recall), I got the trout with lemon sauce and capers. Perfect. Really delicious and a good portion.  Sweetie got the chicken and son got the steak - they were not as enthusiastic as me but they thought their dishes were fine.Wine: I got a perfect glass of Alsatian pinot blanc. Worked perfectly with the trout. Dessert:  I was a little disappointed here. Ordered PROFITEROLES, one of my favorite desserts in the world. The pastry part was too eggy and not really worth eating, though the vanilla ice cream and the chocolate sauce were fine. I wouldn't order this again, and it didn't cap the meal off well. My son enjoyed his strawberry sorbet and vanilla ice cream.Why am I still giving 5 stars if my first and last course were not so great? Dining is not just the courses but also the whole experience.  Service here is both warm and correct, atmosphere is fantastic, price is reasonable. I had some excellent alcohol which put me in a very good mood - and I had one superb dish and two that were fine.  This remains one of my go-to places when visiting NYC - a chic neighborhood place, close enough to Times Square and the Port Authority - but light years away from the craziness!",2,1,2,Alyssa S.,"San Diego, CA",44,373,446

It didn't start off well.  While I stood there for a good 4 minutes watching the host talk on the phone and then walk away from me with menus without even acknowledging my presence, I wasn't thrilled. She came back a few minutes later to then ask if I needed a table. We sat down after my party arrived and was greeted with the menu and tap water.  That was fine. But after we ordered at 11:50, our food and drinks didn't arrive till almost an hour later!  It was bad enough that it took 40 minutes for drinks to be made (my friends ordered mixed drinks and one ordered a simple berry lemonade).  What made it worse was the fact that what some of us ordered were salads ... the waiter was almost nonexistent and didn't even come to apologize or let us know the food was coming until the very end.  I'm giving an extra star because at the end he complimented the creme brulee that my friend ordered, but overall, the mood was gone because of the long wait.  In terms of food, it was just standard, but I did enjoy the french onion soup very much.  Though the cheese was thick, the soup itself was very light and delicious.

For the entrees I tried the crab omelette and they are very generous with the crab- there are tons of pieces in it. I also tried the mushroom ragout with parmesan french toast and two eggs.

3.0,12/24/2018,"Went for NYC Restaurant Week DinnerFood - 3/5. The bread had good flavor to them and I liked the herbed butter in olive oil. Risotto was OK. The corn made it a little sweet and there was plenty of cheese for the creamy texture but flavor wise there wasn't much. You can smell the hints of truffle but it was lost in the mediocre butter sauce. The monkfish had an awful stench to it that would not go away throughout the entire entree. Eating it with the sauce and capers helped a little to mask the monkfish's rather fishy flavor but it felt like I was killing the point of the entree when I'm deliberating trying to not taste the fish. Chocolate cake was deliciously moist with the ice cream adding a creamy and sweet coolness.Service - 2/5. The service was slow and although I can see the restaurant was busy, it was unacceptable that the ice cream was almost done melting away by the time it arrived to the table. This was clearly due to them forgetting to serve the dessert and it sitting on the window for too long. They didn't even bother to replace the ice cream! Very unprofessional.Value - 3/5. There was a lot of inconsistencies in the quality of the food but their restaurant week menu did have many other options. Some of the other options such as the duck schnitzel that my partner had was excellent so I can pass the monkfish as a fluke.

After waiting 10 minutes for a drink, waiter said they ran out of Jameson and had to go downstairs for it. We were sitting next to the bar and I saw the bartender poured a single before running out. Note they failed to serve a single then being another single. After another 8 minutes I told the waiter to forget about the drink to which she replied ""ok"". I presume no apology necessary in instances like these. The food was bla- mussels were over cooked and tough, fries over salted. The salad was ok. When we asked for a check had to wait again as the drink wasn't removed immediately after cancellation and a manager had to be searched (still looking for that Jameson's?) for.

The flavor, the cheese pulls, the bread. Ugh. So good!!! PS- I recommend dipping the breadsticks in the soup for some extra deliciousness ;) We ordered the steak frites and the croque madame. Both of these dishes were amazing. The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare and the béarnaise was delish on top. The croque madame was so fluffy and the egg on top was the best part. Pop the egg and let it run down the sandwich for some delicious flavor. The fries were perfectly crispy in both dishes.

It was absolutely delicious with the right amount of fresh crab meat and caviar on top. The toast was perfect and the salad on the side made the heavy dish just a little lighter which i appreciated since most places serve this with home fries for potatoes.

We put in our orders as soon as we could, yet our entrees were not served until about 7:15, well after our uninspired appetizers had been cleared away. As for the food itself, the apps were poor quality: the bistro salad was almost all frisee with 3 small pieces of beets almost lost in the pile; the duck liver mousse was ordinary, lacking in real flavor and served with just 2 pieces of ""grilled baguette"" (forget about asking for more - took forever.For entrees my wife had the chicken grand-mere which admittedly wasn't bad. I opted for steak frites - it's a French restaurant and we were on a timeline, this should be a basic dish. Awful.

Went here for dinner a couple of weeks ago. We started with the French onion soup and goat cheese croquettte. Both were delicious! As a main course I had the Moules frites and it was so flavorful. Also tried the hanger steak and it certainly did not disappoint. I would go back and order the exact same thing again.  Finished the meal with some apple tart and ice cream.

5.0,4/15/2018,"Everything about my experience here was perfection. Made a 7:00 reservation for my one-year wedding anniversary after a Matinee. We arrived early and sat at the bar. My husband had a tart and bright Bordeaux, and I had their Old Fashioned Riser (Woodford Reserve, mole and orange bitters, Ethiopian cold brew coffee). Both awesome. We were seated early when a table opened up at their offer. I had the Goat Cheese Croquette (TO DIE FOR) and the Half Duck Breast, also phenomenal. My husband had the grilled octopus (best octopus he's ever had) and the lamb chops (worth the breaded calories). Dessert was a creme brulee with mixed berries and the lavender almond financier with honey ice cream, and some dessert sparkling wine on the house for our anniversary. I cannot stress how good literally everything was. Celia, our server, deserves a special shoutout. Welcoming, warm, and knowledgeable, and made us laugh on top of it all.

Came in at 9:30 and as you step through the door, you feel the warmth emanating from all angles of this beautiful bistro.  Seated by the window overlooking 9th avenue, we decided to make a meal out of several appetizers.  We got shrimp beignets, duck mousse, mushroom tart, goat cheese croquette and escargots. A crusty warm bread preceded our choices; it was terrific. My drink was made very well. We skipped the entries and went for dessert.  I had the Meyer lemon tart, a perfect balance of sweet/light/slightly tart and hubby had profiteroles.

The drinks are delicious - I ordered the jalapeno margarita which is reason enough to stop into Marseille. My cousin had another drink but then switched over to the margarita.

2.0,3/5/2018,"Marseille is a place with interesting bistro decor that contributes to a ""bustling Paris vibe,"" or at least what I know of it from watching movies. But that's about where the charm ends. It's a pretty frustrating place to eat, especially when you discover that it's basically banking on Times Square and Theater District food traffic to survive. That strategy has largely worked, so who am I to criticize it from a business perspective.But I'm not here to talk about Marseille's finances. I'm here to talk about the FOOD. It's just not great. The calamari (sp) was super dry, with an insufficient amount of marinara sauce mysteriously tucked underneath the squid rather than in a bowl. We ate half of it before realizing that there was even sauce available, and it wasn't that much, to boot. The stuff itself was really dry and not well-fried. The texture wasn't of a delicious breaded covering but... sand. Pate was OK but nothing extraordinary. French onion soup was like eating a bowl of sodium and definitely on the bottom of my NYC rankings for french onion soup. (#1? Can I hear it for Brassiere RUHLMANNNNNNNNNN?!) Chicken was OK. I forgot what my friend had, but she said so-so. Mousse was serviceable but not extraordinary.Logistics are a disaster, with overt favoritism shown by owner towards large tourist groups! Food also takes forever to arrive. You can probably fly to Marseille and back before it arrives, figuratively speaking.Stay away and head to Rockefeller Center for much better French food.",2,1,1,Merlin C.,"Manhattan, NY",274,608,74
4.0,2/23/2018,Very nice place for a work lunch or dinner before a broadway show. Wait service is very attentive and they give you bread before the meal. The olive oil is very good. The portions are a good size and dishes are mostly around 20 or 25 dollars.Ingedients are very fresh. I had the salmon entree for lunch before and it was very good and had crispy skin. It filled me up and was cooked perfectly. Had a tastey sauce with it too.Today I had the lump crab meat salad which had a lot of crab meat on it and tasted very fresh. It was pretty light and gave me energy for the day and had room for dinner still. Overall great nice place that is not super fancy and high priced but not average also. So its right in that middle spot if you want a nice lunch or dinner without spending a fortune but still want to impress friends or clients.,1,0,0,Marisa M.,"Suffern, NY",230,111,259
2.0,2/21/2018,"I have been a frequent guest for at least 10 years so I throw out the question - what went wrong?  Suffered through an awful dinner last Saturday , when just about everything went wrong .  First, I made reservations well in advance and when I arrived they seemed flustered and put us in the bar area. I mentioned it was too loud and cold because of the open door and the hostess kind of smirked and said that it was all she had.  I mentioned that the guest was very hard of hearing and she ignored me. Once we were all seated the waiter removed the table settings .  I don't know why.  I asked , he put them back.  We were all served water out in different glasses. Mood, already , gone south. I ordered the boulibaisse which arrived cold, with two small cracked pieces of toast to use for the soup. Our guest ordered mussels and they forgot the French fries.  Had to ask twice.  The wine got poured every 25 minutes or so and we were always waiting or had to ask. Keep in mind it was still very loud and cold at our table.  I asked for a Calvados and they informed me they only had one that was the highest priced one .  It happens but I find it difficult to believe.  So....the reason I write this is to let you know that dedication to this restaurant means nothing and even a regular customer can be treated terribly and receive bad food and service.  It makes me sad but never again.",1,0,0,Chris F.,"Nutley, NJ",0,13,0

5.0,2/16/2018,"Having owned a home in France for the past 20 years, I am quite familiar with what a French bistro should deliver in terms of food, service and ambiance. MARSEILLE restaurant is exemplary on all three levels.The decor is as French brasserie as it gets. The welcome by the French hostess from Toulouse was genuine, warm and accommodating. Our service table-side, was attentive, knowledgable and timely.The Mediterranean and Winter salads were fresh and  full of flavorful, seasonal ingredients. The onion soup was crusty not too salty (frequently the problem with reduced broths) and full of caramelized onions. The entrees that we ordered-duck breast with choucroute and vegetables were spot on. The duck itself was tender, moist and well seasoned. The choucroute, so often overbrined, was sweet, tangy and reminiscent of one of Alsace's culinary claims to fame. The wines that were recommended by the sommelier (I believe his name was Wally), a Cotes du Rhone and a red from Luberon,  complemented the duck perfectly. Our profiteroles and the glass of sparkling Muscat were a stellar finish to the meal.With so many choices in New York, and so many mediocre reproductions of french bistros, MARSEILLE stands out as location that deserves the return. On our next trip to New York, we will certainly make it a destination of choice.",3,0,1,Eric W.,"Willow, NY",1,10,0

I'm not big on French food, but this restaurant close and convenient to where we were.  I ordered the Branzino,  and my friends ordered the Steak, and the Burger.  The Branzino itself was a bit dry and rather bland.  The accompanying cauliflower and sauce made it palpable.  The service was friendly and knowledgeable.  The prices are typical for a NYC establishment.",10,2,7,Leena S.,"Princeton, NJ",258,504,2002

Had a 7 PM Broadway show and just wanted a drink at a pleasant bar and an appetizer.Wanted to go to Bea but it was closed for a private party. So we walked a block and this looked like a plan B.Beautiful bar area but a little small and already almost filled at 5:30 PM. The hostess had people move their winter coats off bar stools and voila, seats. Dining area all open but barely filled, even when leaving around 6:35. But tables with white linens were pretty.I had a ""Cherry Manhattan"" and we shared the truly delicious hummus with lots of pita and some olive tapenade on top. If you like decent hummus, order. Drink was fine if small. Wine for my colleague was fine. Spent part of the time eavesdropping on a young couple right next to us about a work intrigue. She kept making him promise he wouldn't tell what she told him just now later at a holiday party starting at 8. I mean she kept saying promise me, about 6 times.  After a couple of drinks, he already confessed he had already heard the info--as had others. She wanted to see his phone to see his text stream. He refused. What drama. A classic example of why sitting right at the bar is so ""amusant""!The group on other side, more relaxed and jovial, had great looking calamari app--also a nice size as was our hummus. We left feeling satisfied to get through the three hour show with the easy possibility of another drink and small plates after.Nice bartenders. Classic French dinner menu looked good.

It was certainly a bon anniversaire and a special night.  While Marseille seemed a bit like a neighborhood haunt (recommended by someone who used to live in a townhouse feet away from the restaurant), I would return, especially for the appetizers and wine.  Also, 9th Avenue tends to be my pre-theater meal destination of choice, so it will be top of mind for those occasions.",2,0,1,Caroline B.,"New York, NY",457,1247,36

The stuffed zucchini flowers which were one of the three appetizers offered were not available and unfortunately were what we were all looking forward to having. We were told that the shipment didn't come in the evening before. Since another option was NOT offered, we were left with heirloom tomatoes or a salad. So far, I wasn't feeling the French . The entries offered were just as uninteresting including, corn risotto, a chicken breast or FARM raised salmon! What self respecting restaurant serves FARM raised anything now a days ????!!!!I've enjoyed risotto around the world, and have NEVER seen it with corn, obviously they took a very inexpensive twist on the risotto! The chicken breast atop wilted arugula and kale salad left me feeling as though I had ordered from a THIN menu; completely tasteless! The whole experience left me feeling anything but French, there was absolutely nothing French about this place; I am convinced that a restaurant can open up on any street in NYC and make it regardless of its being good or not!Skip this poor excuse for a French restaurant, there are plenty of others truly more worthy!",0,0,0,Maria P.,"Lebanon Township, NJ",0,5,0

The wine list is extensive, with a choice of half-bottles, particularly welcome at lunchtime! The prices are reasonable for a restaurant of this standard and in the area. What does let this place down is the erratic quality of the service; on some occasions it is courteous and efficient; on others it is lackadaisical: on one occasion there were obviously not enough staff, and we had to wait forever to be served; on another, very recent, our waiter had an unkempt appearance and was unable to answer simple questions about the menu.

4.0,4/6/2017,"Ever since my favorite French bistro closed, I've found solace at Marseille.  This bistro sits in Hell's Kitchen but is two blocks away from Theatre District and chaos of Times Square.  Often crowded but always charming, this venue feels very similar to that of an authentic French bistro in Paris and lets you forget that you are even on Ninth Avenue.Each time I've come here it's always been for brunch.  Reservations are strongly recommended as my first two attempts to dine here resulted in a 20 or so minute wait time.  When you first arrive, make sure to come in at the front entrance on W44th Street, since often times people get this confused with the side entrance.  Coming in you'll see it's an older crowd sprinkled with tourists but you'll quickly take notice of the charming decor.  Service is quick and very attentive offering water and giving you menus straight away.  Whether you're here for brunch, lunch or dinner items on the menu are influenced from France and other Mediterranean countries.  The menu is broken up by cocktails ($11-14ea), champagne cocktails (7 choices for $10ea), starters, specialities, salads and everything in between.  The drinks can easily add up but to make up for it all of them have flavors to match nearly every food selection on the menu and are well mixed.  If I'm not having an Acai Cosmo it's going to be a Passion Mimosa.  On my most recent visit, I wanted to be on the healthier side so my boyfriend and I shared their Burgundy Snails which come with 6 pieces in a piping hot snail dish.  Each snail is smothered in olive oil and crispy bread crumbs with a hint of cheese (parmesan?).  To follow up we both had the Healthy Frittata: spinach, egg whites, roasted peppers and leeks with pesto drizzled on top.  On the side we wanted to get our carb on so that included fresh fruit, a toasted bagel with cream cheese and croissant (yolo).  Although I knew what we had recently wasn't terribly Mediterranean I know for the next time I can have their Mediterranean salad to start, enjoy a main of Moroccan Shakshuka or one of their seafood sandwiches or salads.  Looking back at my old French bistro, they seemed to cater to the American taste palette when the Marseille gently coaxes - if anything - people to embrace the flavors of France and the Mediterranean.",2,0,1,Anna F.,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",262,241,2187

3.0,2/13/2017,"If my understanding of Manhattan from my short trip to explore the city doesn't fail me, I believe Marseille is in the middle of the midtown area. It has a very French feeling and looks like it was built to appeal to the early 20th century patron but it still appeals to the customer in 2017. We made reservations for noon but were running late because I decided to go to SoHo in the morning and get my Dominique Ansel fix. But more on that in a different review.They have a lot of seating so that's not a problem. But it was fully packed when we arrived. Thankfully we had a reservation and they honored it even though we were almost 15 minute late (thank you crazy new york traffic). The crowd was mostly upper 30s and onward. We were probably the youngest people in the whole restaurant. So if you're looking for a younger crowd, I'd steer clear of going there unless I was just here on an early bird special day.The food here is good. I can't really say that it was amazing because I found a crab shell in my crab and egg brunch. The server apologized and the manager did too when he came. Maybe I'm used to service par excellence where if something like this happens they usually remove the plate from your table and ask to bring a different one or comp you for it. I am not one to get free meals because there's something wrong with it but I just couldn't bear eating after having my tooth and tongue practically destroyed. Thankfully it wasn't serious and I healed after the round of drinks they brought to us after on the house to remedy the situation. Also, the eggs were a little runny for my liking. The drinks here are good. So my take away from this experience is go for the drinks and stay for the atmo ? maybe get the french onion soup. Skip all the brunch specials because they just looked like docotred specialties of any brunch place. With a name like Marseille I would expect a lot more than what the menu offered.

I just did not find it as good as my first or second time.But at the urging of trusted friends, I have been back to the restaurant twice in the past two months. Both times for brunch.

My friends had the creme brûlée which was creamy and had vanilla extract and seeds at the base which adds to the aromatic beauty of the experience.The green tea was light and aromatic.

The deserts were also pretty disappointing. The wine list was extensive and expensive. Overall I would say because it is located on Hells Kitchen it is a tourist trap.

4.0,2/22/2016,"Marseille was suggested by a friend when we made plans to do a double date brunch in NYC together. She said she had been there couple of times and absolutely loved it. One look at Yelp and I said YES.Conveniently located, the atmosphere is super nice. I am glad she made a reservation cause the place was packed. We got seated right away without a problem.  Our choice of drink around the table was Kir Royale and Espresso Martini. Both different but very good. If you are looking for something bubbly and sweet get the Kir Royale. If you are a fan of coffee I highly recommend the Martini. For appetizer we shared the Burgundy Snail, super buttery and garlicky topped with bread crumb. As good as the snail was I really wished they served bread on the side. Although they served a plate of delicious bread (cranberry bread and mini-muffins) they really could not be eaten with the escargot. Our Entree of choice were Pork Belly Madame and the Moroccan Shakshuka. The hubby got the Pork Belly so I really cannot comment much on that but he seemed to really enjoyed it. The Shakshuka was amazing, really different from any other brunch item I have ever had. The eggs were perfectly poached in the delicious tomato sauce, the yolk immediately started running once I put my fork into it. The basil ricotta topping was heavenly and just took the dish to another level. For dessert we got the Creme Brulee. I am huge fan of Creme Brulees in general but I thought it was just OK. After the amazing drinks and meal I really expected more from the dessert.

4.0,2/12/2016,"Nice atmosphere, great food, conveniently located near the theatre district. I found this place on Yelp when we were looking for somewhere to eat before a show. The reviews were good and the menu looked awesome so I thought we'd give it a try. Booked a reso through OpenTable, that worked out fine. Our first server was knowledgable but aloof, never made eye contact and didn't seem all that interested in us but he was efficient, I'll give him that. Considering there were only 3 other tables in the restaurant at 5pm there was no reason to act like we were wasting his time. With 3 seniors in the group of 5, they needed a bit more time to look at the menu and ask questions. The food itself was spectacular. I had the moules marinière et frites, which was maybe one of the best I've had outside of France. The fries were golden fried, lightly seasoned with sea salt and thyme, pairing nicely with the fresh mussels. For dessert I had the lemon tart and sorbet. Divine. My friend that paid the bill accidentally miscalculated and only tipped 10%. Our server - a new girl by this point - came by and asked if there was anything wrong with service because ""normally you tip 18-20%"". We may be Canadian but satisfactory service is usually 15%, 18% for good service (or a large group) and you better be outstanding for 20%. Let me tell you. Service was not outstanding. And we aren't the first to experience this. We felt bad for the mixup with adding up the bill (give him a break, he's 80 years old) but that was a rather rude way to go about asking for a bigger tip.

5.0,1/27/2016,"I'm the director of operations for an upscale highly rated restaurant in midtown(won't name it so as not to gratuitously exploit review) and last night we joined our best friends for a ""restaurant week dinner"" at Marseille. We started with a few non RW dishes, mussels in white wine sauce and Escargot, both were prepared perfectly. From the RW menu I had the Mushroom toast which was comprised of succulent duck shredded like pulled pork and mixed with sautéed mushrooms on a slice of brioche toast and topped with arugula...overall excellent although the arugula buried the duck and mushrooms. My main was the Beef Short rib Bourguignon which was hands down the best I've had...the meat just melted apart and the bed of truffle-parsnip puree was sumptuously creamy and delicate, so glad they didn't cut corners and go with mashed potatoes which all the lazy chefs do. When the Cabernet daube sauce mixed in with the puree it was karmic! I picked the wine for the table and since my wife and friends were all having fish I was about to pick a white until I spotted a bottle or red from the Canary Islands. First, kudos to who ever put the wine list together, that was an inspired choice...and a great price point at $45. A flavorful but light red with similarities to a good Burgundy the wine floored everyone at the able. I finished with the ""Delvils Food Cake"" which was hedonistically rich but not too and was matched with a milk chocolate sorbet that was delicious. Our sommelier, Watson, was helpful and friendly as was our server (forgot his name- had glasses).

There's a very Continental vibe.One of my favorite brunch entrees is Moroccan Shakshuka which comes with 3 baked eggs plus ratatouille and basil ricotta. It's delicious, flavorful and probably their signature brunch dish.Last time I had the Pork Belly Madame sandwich with egg and Guyere cheese. It was unique and filling and another of my favs. The Chicken Paillard with Arugula was decent but nothing to write home about. Sunday I tried the Short Ribs Polenta since it looked so good at the table next to us. The meat was tender but a bit under-seasoned. Polenta doesn't have much taste so the total entree wasn't what I thought it would be. Service is always prompt and courteous. One time our server knocked a Bellini glass over and it broke on the table. She moved us to another table and we all got new drinks!

The appetizers were also very good - my co-worker and I tried the tuna carpaccio  and the spinach leek goat cheese tart. After that, it was all downhill. Had the summer risotto -- the rice was good in terms of texture but the presentation and flavor combinations were way off. I HATED the arugula pesto - it looked disgusting, like a glob of toothpaste. It didn't taste good or complement the dish in any way. My co-worker wasn't impressed with her grilled jumbo shrimp either - I tried some - they were giant but the texture was a bit tough. They were also paired with mediocre cauliflower - not the best combo.Desserts are hefty in terms of portions. I tried the triple sorbet -- mango, black cherry and peach. It was good - great texture but very sweet, almost overwhelming. My co-worker's apple crisp with vanilla ice cream was also good but super sweet. They had a decent beer menu. Also noticed their admirable scotch selection. Our server was really nice but seemed way overworked. It looked like she was doing EVERYTHING. She greeted us, took our orders and in several instances - filled our water and took away our plates.... It wasn't busy but I assume they were short-staffed.

5.0,8/6/2015,Marseille continues to deliver in a very busy part of midtown after being open for over a decade.  This has been one of my two favorite French brasseries on the west side for years and it continues its rein as an all around great French eatery.  The service is efficient and friendly.  The stereotypes of the servers of older New York French establishments fall flat here as bartenders and servers are on their game and make you feel welcome.  The menu is always reliable and whether you're sharing a few plates as we chose to do and enjoy cocktails or you're going for a full three course meal you can't beat the French fare here.  I can't wait until I go back next even if it's for a glass of wine and escargot at the bar!

But I finally tried this place and figured restaurant week might be a good time to do a sampling. I LOVE Mediterranean food and was excited but I ordered the artichoke appetizer and it was in a tasteless broth with mushy filling, there was no sign that it was broiled or even put under the appropriate amount of heat. The ""jumbo prawns"" came in an order of 4 for $24 which makes them $6 each and they came below room temperature, I asked the waiter if it was supposed to be served warm and they re-fired it after 15 minutes its clear that once you take the prawn heads off and separate the meat there is the equivalent of one shrimp's worth of meat. If it had been a few bites of amazing food I would have left satisfied but it was tasteless and I spit out a mushy portion the texture was completely off. The chef must be new or inexperienced because he butchered what should have been two straight forward dishes. I made one right choice with the vanilla bean ice cream and left PISSED $80 later.

We ordered a sizable variety of seafood appetizers and found everything to be well prepared, beautifully presented and absolutely delicious. The octopus was unbelievably tender.

And, the crab marseillaise was the memorable favorite that will keep me returning again and again. The seafood tagine was something off the beaten path, and while good, it was overshadowed by the fluke which was the clear winner for us both. When ordering dessert, take a walk off the beaten path and order the sesame parfait.The food was very good, but the service was great. Our waiter, Prince, was impeccable from start to finish. He answered all of our questions very knowledgeably and seemed to go the extra mile by anticipating our needs.

They no longer have endive on the app list - but if it comes back, order it. I never get dessert before a show - so can't comment.

No one served us at the bar. I can't imagine they had any reservations for after 10pm either...We were eventually seated, but took a long time to find someone to order off. There were dozens of waiters, but we reveled in our new-found 'powers of invisibility'. The man that seated us was rude and declined to take our order. Everything just seemed a challenge. The bread we were given was far too crusty and unenjoyable. The check sat on our table for 20 minutes before a waiter decided to put through our credit card.

We intended to come here for restaurant week but only to find out that Marseille was no longer participating since restaurant week was over; this was strange because the day of our visit was supposed to be the last day of restaurant week, but whatever. Since we were already seated at this point we decided to give the restaurant a shot. We all shared the tuna tartare, the crab cake, and the cheese fondue (it was apparently cheese week at the restaurant) and the tuna tartare was probably my favorite out of the three appetizers we had. My friend had the organic chicken and she said it was a bit too salty for her liking. Another ordered a dish that sounded like some sort of fancy chicken (at least that's how the waiter made it sound) but turned out to be a plain ole chicken salad. I had the chicken coucous dish and my dish was probably the best out of everyone's. My other friend ordered the Beef Short Rib ""Bourguignon"" but they brought her a completely different dish featuring salmon. When she waived a waiter down to tell him about the mistake he told her that it would be another 20 mins before her food came. She just let it go and decided to eat her salmon since at this point we all had our food and were all starving.

I swear Marseille gave me the best calamari I have ever encountered. Ever. Do you know what that means? Probably not. But take my word for it, I'm a calamari fanatic. I would (and plan to) eat it for breakfast lunch and dinner. This place did it right.They also had a satisfyingly long wine list. We ordered a bottle of white for the table and it will probably bother me for the rest of my life that I cannot remember the name of the wine since it was divine and difficult to come by. I could wax poetic for eons about my love for Marseille but that wouldn't fill your tummy. You've gotta try it yourself.",2,2,1,Jena G.,"New Haven, CT",25,45,41
3.0,3/23/2015,"Good location.  Lovely interior.  Sat my friend before I arrived (a good thing).Runners were nice and professional throughout the meal.  Our server didn't seem to be interested in us until we ordered drinks, apps, and entrees, and I made it clear that the drink list should remain on the table.  Though he did seem quite friendly and jovial with the regulars.Enjoyed both the Pear Martini (tasted like liquid boozy poached pears) and the Jalapeno Martini (perfectly balanced).  Neither of us were fans of their take on escargot.  They sprinkle seasoned breadcrumbs atop each snail.  The effect quickly became cloying, and took away from the texture and earthiness of the snail.  It also clogged up the butter. So dipping the bread we requested didn't satisfy.My friend ordered the duck.  Very lovely presentation.  Good balance of puree, protein, and sauce.  Medium cook nailed perfectly.  However, the duck wasn't particularly flavorful without the sour cherry sauce.  And the entire dish was tepid (a hot meal would have been preferred).Then there was the lamb ""shank"".  After the server presented the contents of the tagine (I loved the vessel itself), I just tilted my head, stared, and had a significant ""blink....blink...."" moment.  The server noticed, though didn't inquire.  I signaled for him to come over.  I asked him whether this was an entire shank (which I knew it was not...unless they are using pigmy lambs).  He enthusiastically assured me that it was whole, simply taken off the bone.  I simply replied, ""uh huh...""He left.I cook lamb.  I know Mediterranean cuisine.  I order the lamb shank nearly every time I see it on any menu.  This was a quarter of a proper shank, at best.  Taken of the bone?  Certainly.  But a fraction of that for which we were paying, especially keeping in mind that no Mediterranean culture serving a shank would dish up such a measly portion.Oh, and my friend has ordered this same dish before.  It was served whole, on the bone, and was plentiful in size.  #timestheyhaveachangedTo the server's credit, he spoke with a manager without me requesting he do so.  The manager immediately came to our table to ask if there was an issue.  To the manager's credit, he did not refute my statement that this was a portion of a shank.  He professionally apologized, and offered a complimentary side dish.I chose the Porcini Cigares, which were phenomenal.  Generous portion of three cigares.  I'd gladly serve those individually as a passed hors d'oeuvre at my own wedding.  They were so divine. ps - The shank and couscous were only a step above tepid.  If you like your food hot, I'd recommend requesting as much.pps - The merguez couscous was delectable!Overall, I doubt I'll be back.  Too many other options in the area that serve both types of cuisine, and do it better.  I'm glad I went, though.  It did make for an acceptable experience.  It's a place to keep on the map for am impressive while affordable option for your out-of-town guests.",5,1,1,Christopher M.,"New York, NY",1591,1629,394

I arrived at exactly 8 pm for reservations I made to celebrate my 3 year anniversary with my husband. We were sat at a corner table and the waitress brought us water and asked if we wanted anything to drink to begin with. I ordered a drink and she asked to see my ID. Since I turned 21, I have NEVER had a problem using a foreign passport as my ID. Not at bars, restaurants, clubs. Apparently, it is a problem here. The waitress asked if I had ""anything American"" which took me by surprised. I asked her if you needed to be American to be served there and she said, ""well...yea"" and giggled.My husband and I promptly stood up and walked out. I can't believe a restaurant in the theater district would discriminate against foreigners. Given that NYC is tourist central. Regardless, I am of age and there is no law saying that you cannot have a drink unless you're American. The blatant discrimination was humiliating and outright disgusting.

2.0,2/17/2015,"I've been to Marseille three times, though each time was underwhelming.  The place, which allegedly gets crowded and noisy during peak times, is mostly empty and quiet at about 2.30p.  Marseille is a glorified coffee shop with prices that do not greatly exceed those of the corner diner.The trout was flattened out and tasteless.  The scallops were lightly fried and dry.  Best appetizer is the salted cod, which comes out warm and well spiced.  Beet salad appetizer is nothing special.For desserts, the chocolate torte was on the dry side and with little taste while the panna cotta was overly citrus.  Fig bread pudding would have been a better choice.To be fair, each time we ordered the prix fixe though many of the dishes are on the general menu as well.  The Restaurant Week cost of $25 per lunch (extra for beverage and no coffee or tea supplied on the special menu) is reasonable.  We had to ask for extra lemon three times.  It was brought speedily enough, but why the serious cutbacks?  No lemon was provided for either fish dish.  The lemons served on request were tiny, pits remaining, and insufficient for both the fish and the St. Pellegrino bubbly water.Marseille boasts a southern French-Moroccan specialty but you have to order the more Moroccan-ish dishes like Vegetable Tagine if you prefer the Mahgreb to the Gallic.  Emphasis is on design rather than flavor.",0,0,0,Harvey K.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,19,0

The beet and goat cheese gnudi were a little strange but very tasty. We also ordered the porcini risotto and we were was literally scraping the bowl for more because it was that good. We explained to the waiter again that we weren't rushing and he was very accomodating and understanding after that. I ordered the lamb shank and couscous for dinner.

Now about the food, we ordered the pre-fix for two since it had all the dishes we would have tried anyway. We got Escargot(snails in garlic sauce) and beet and goat cheese gnudi for appetizers which were surprisingly delicious. Wife ordered lamb couscous and i ordered grilled salmon. When our plates arrived, the first thing that came to mind was chopped kitchen since the presentation of my plate was perfect. The fish was perfect, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and the sides were a perfect compliment. Lamb couscous was good. The lamb was vert tender but the wife says she has had better.

They had a reservation for 6pm which was perfect since our show was at 8. The moment we walked in our table was ready! They politely asked to take our coats. Nice touch. Once we were seated we were given menus and our drink orders were taken. We stuck with water. Quickly after, we had bread service. Our choices were between whole grain and olive. I chose whole grain and it was perfect. My sister, fiancé, and I all ordered the price fixe. For appetizers we shared the pistou soup, fall squash and eggs, and the escargot. We also ordered the shrimp beignets and short rib cigars. The pistou soup was good, but not thick and did not have pasta in it like it was supposed to have. I'm not into fall squash at all. But I did try the fried poached egg and it was tasty! The escargot was my first snail. Sounds scary, right? I'm know a convert. But to be fair, if you drown something in butter and top it with breadcrumbs it's gunna be good. The shrimp beignet was underwhelming. It was just a fried shrimp. It was okay but not great. The short rib cigars were delicious. The meat had a tasty spice blend and the tahini sauce was perfect. For entrees we each had the hanger steak. We ordered it rare and it was perfect. The buttered spinach that accompanied it was perfect, had a nice fresh bite. We all loved it. For dessert split 3. The warm chocolate cake, the creme bruleé, and the fig bread pudding. They were all so good. The peanut butter ice cream that came with the chocolate cake was addicting. The creme bruleé was not overly sweet and had lots of streaks of fresh vanilla bean. The fig bread pudding was my favorite. It wasn't super heavy and creamy, instead it was more like light cake stuffed with fig jam. It was heaven. We sat, had our 3 courses, and left within an hour.

2.0,11/26/2014,"Last Saturday evening, I had the distinct misfortune of dining at Marseille.  I have not been to this restaurant in a couple of years, and without a doubt, this place has gone down hill.Arriving promptly for my 9pm reservation, my guest and I were seated at a two top with views into the kitchen, just a stones throw from the bus station.  Let's just say that it was not the best seat in the house.  We immediately asked the hostess to reseat us.  The restaurant was about 75% full so there were plenty of open tables.  She told us despite our request that we could not sit at a four top as she informed us that couples were not seated at four tops.  I accepted this response and also accepted a marginally better seating option than what I originally had.Before moving on to the food, within 20 minutes of seating, the hostess sat a two top at a four top right next to my table.  There were several empty two tops around the restaurant, so I was totally confounded.  I approached the same hostess that had sat my table and the table next to us and asked her why she gave the table next to me a four top and did not let me have one.  She simply shrugged her shoulders and gave some lame explanation.  I was furious.So let me get back to my cramped little two top and what was supposed to be a ""good"" dining experience.  To begin with, we had ordered the shrimp beignets, which were pretty good, but it went downhill from there.  We also shared the octopus, which was a bit gamey.  For the entree, my guest had the monkfish, which was absolutely bite size and not all that good, in fact almost inedible.  I had the lamb, which was simply meh and the portion size seemed to be under 6 ounces, which left me still hungry by the end of my meal.In all honesty, the service was decent (excluding  the inept hostess), so this is what earns the restaurant two stars.  That being said, given the combination of the marginal food and sloppy hostessing, I will not be returning to this sad excuse for a restaurant.  And, as such, I suggest that you go elsewhere to meet your dining needs.You've Been Warned!",1,1,0,Tim S.,"New York, NY",3,100,0

Thirdly, I asked for my steak medium rare and it was raw most of the way through resulted in it being very chewy. I've NEVER seen pieces of cheese on a cheese plate this tiny. Unbelievable.

4.0,10/19/2014,"Had a great experience at this restaurant as part of a great, spontaneous day in the city.  Stopped in at around 12:30 pm without a reservation for Saturday brunch before a show.  Completely by chance, as we had no particular destination in mind, wanting only a place that was not overly commercial or generic.  Coming upon Marseille at 9th Avenue as we turned the corner from 44th Street (and very hungry at the time), we were immediately intrigued by its French bistro vibe and the energy emanating from inside, which carried over to the tables and street outside.  Luckily, as a party of two, we were seated immediately at the only interior table available at the time, in a little nook just inside the bar entrance.The waiter was very professional and attentive.  I ordered a Moroccan Bloody, and my wife a pomegranate mimosa, both of which were brought out promptly, along with a couple of slices of French bread and mini carrot muffins, accompanied by a thin slab of butter and jelly.  My wife really enjoyed the mimosa, but my drink was a bit too peppery and bitter for my taste.The brunch menu is very intriguing and we went back and forth before deciding on what to order.  Ultimately, my wife ordered the seafood burger, and I ordered the pork belly madame, having no idea what I was getting but trusting the waiter who said it was one of the more popular brunch dishes.  One was brought with fries and the other with a salad.The pork belly madame was unbelievably delicious!  I relished every bite of it and was genuinely sad when I finished the last bite.  The side salad was terrific, fresh and lightly dressed, and the fries, seasoned with, among other things, rosemary and salt, were good, although not as well done as I prefer.  The seafood burger was okay.  It was what it purported to be, a Moroccan-spiced patty with shrimp, salmon, and scallops, and it was well-done, both in its preparation and temperature.  However, as we often find with such burgers (and crab cakes to be fair), the dish sounded and looked better on paper than it tasted.  A bit too mushy and overwhelmed by the aroma and flavor of salmon.  Not something we would order again.  Nonetheless, we would definitely return to Marseille for brunch or dinner before a show.",0,1,0,Mitch B.,"Nassau County, NY",8,78,12

3.0,10/11/2014,"This restaurant is right next to my office. My friend and I were actually looking for a great Italian restaurant, but settled for Marseille. The food was just okay (salmon was flavorless and the calamari had too much mayo) and the customer service was lacking. We were seated by a female hostess who only gave us a wine menu. We sat there waiting for almost 5 minutes for wait staff to bring us menus. Shortly after, we were given waters, and didn't see our waiter again...almost another 7 minutes went by before I decided to get up and ask the hostess if she could please send our waiter back to our table to take our cocktail orders. We ordered, got our drinks, food, etc. On the outside, this restaurant looks fancy and the prices certainly reflect a high-end place, but again, this restaurant failed to deliver anything of quality. We were given 2 glasses of complimentary moscato at the end of our dinner I guess to make up for lack of customer service. However, that certainly doesn't suffice when you've spent over $100.00 for 2 on a meal.

We started with a passion mimosas (yum!) and the waiter brought out a delicious bread basket with small banana nut muffins and cranberry bread - definitely a surprise and step up from your normal ordinary bread basket (although I ate too much of it)! We ordered a truffle and pea tart to start which was truly out of this world! The truffle was just right, not over powering, but definitely strong enough to leave it's mark. We also ordered the frittata verde (also something different) that had Swiss chard, raisins, pine nuts, Parmesan and pesto within.

I *still* couldn't remember what I'd gotten once we got the menus so... this went about as well as you would expect.Located squarely in the theater district, Marseille has that Uncanny Valley/Disneyland style of decor where you can tell they're going for something but not quite making it. I'm sure it's meant to be a ""French oasis"" within the bustle, but really, give me a good restaurant over stage design. My chicken was dry and not worth finishing, the corn thing it came with was cold but not cold enough to be an actual counterpoint, and my raspberry honey tart was the only possibly good part.

Their bernaise sauce is such a perfect flavor and consistency, the risotto is absolutely out of this world. I dined with an Italian chef who couldn't believe how wonderful the risotto was. We also had chickpea empanadas and some tiny meat filled cigars which were tasty. The steaks were cooked exactly to order. Baby back ribs were deboned and so tender they could've been eaten with a spoon. Desserts? Omg. The creme brûlée is not over sweetened, the bread pudding is an insane delight, the chocolate desserts were gobbled up by the others at my table before I tasted them! The house poured us z complimentary glass of dessert wine that was slightly fizzy and tasted of pears. Yum.The service was prompt, friendly,professional, and never seemed rushed.

The omelettes are to die for. I especially like the merguez sausage and egg scramble with creme fresh. Perfect combo of spicy, creamy, and filling. 4. The french toast: this is serious business.

Worst of all was the arrogant host verbally insulting my friend as she was taking lovely photos of the place as we were leaving. He said in an audible belligerent voice, ""Why don't you just take pictures of the whole place?"" Apparently our wished-for departure wasn't good enough. He had to toss in another jab. This prick should be fired. He's the one with the tight ill-fitting grey suit. He should be ashamed of himself, and so should the management for hiring him. Also, the wine prices are absurd and the portion minimal. $16 a glass for California 2012 Lyric. The peppercorn sauce for the steak was tasteless and had no pepper in it at all. The vegetarian couscous was also tasteless. They also charge 12 dollars for four asparagus on toast with an egg. The mixed berries dessert was excellent though.

Perfect flavor. The steak on the other hand was mediocre and very tough. Will not order that again.

I can comment on the wine, and the wine list is fantastic!  The wine list is actually a BOOK with the various wines listed by region and grape. There are bottles ranging from $40 to several thousand dollars.... So, definitely a huge range of wines available. The cheese plate is not on the menu but you can select 2, 3, or 4 types of cheese (goat cheese, parmesan, roquefort, and brie).

My mom and I both got the snails to start, the salmon entree for my mom, and the tuscan chicken for me. Obviously the escargo was amazing - they were so full of flavor and made with just the right amound of breadcrumbs; deeelish. Our entrees were also exceptional - the accompanying sauce with each dish was so flavorful and had a little twist that made them even better. For dessert, my mom ordered the apple tart and I the banana bread pudding. We were so full from the appetizer and entree that we could barely get through the first couple of bites unfortunately. One of my favorite parts of the experience? The waiter assumed that we were going to the 2:00 matinee show and made sure that our courses were timed so that we finished eating and settled our check with enough time to make it to the theater.

The vibe is not stuffy but certainly feels like a higher end. They have a sommelier that will make rounds and the prices seem reasonable. This is the second time I get seated without having a reservation right away ( admittedly during slow weekdays) but they do so quickly and in a very efficient manner.Both times the hostess was incredibly friendly and welcoming. There are just a few people that imprint themselves into my memory here in New York, and she is one of them. Additionally, the server  regularly checked on me, made good suggestions and had a pleasant personality. In terms of the food: I had the calamari and NY strip steak because I was starving and wanted something substantial ( this is not a steak house so I had set my expectations low).The calamari was great but a little bit on the salty side. Let me say with full confidence that the steak was better than anything I have ever had at Shulas. It was juicy, tender but again a bit on the salty side ( owed to the generous helping of sea salt on top ).I recommend this for what it is: a consistently good experience.

I definitely feel like we made the right call.Dinner started out with some wonderful bread and a pad of butter in olive oil. Fat in fat? How could you possibly go wrong?We got the Moroccan eggplant, which was like a smoky tomato-baba ghannoush combo. It was wonderful. The arugula salad was basic but perfect. The charred octopus, though? THAT was the stuff dreams are made out of. Perfectly-cooked, flavored beautifully--I probably could've eaten that all night.Moules frites were perfect and plentiful. Frites were battered beautifully and were delicious. The mussels were pretty much how I hoped they would be--they didn't skimp out, either! We focused on finishing those just because taking them home would've been a pain.The other dish we got was the scallops, which were also excellent. The pommes pure they were served on top of was a wonderful compliment. We only got through 2 of the 4 due to the insane amount of food otherwise, but it was great.Marseille was excellent, and I'd happily go back.

Marseilles is a bustling restaurant but the usual rush last night was calmed by one of their exceptional waiters. His name is Sunil.Sunil was friendly, professional and attentive. He did something that was unusual for us at Marseilles. We requested some Dijon mustard, not an unusual request for a French restaurant, I thought. He brought us coarse Dijon and told us that the restaurant does not carry regular Dijon. I love the Marseilles frites, but seriously, how can you enjoy the frites without regular Dijon mustard?This is where Sunil shined through! A moment later he brought us some regular Dijon and told us he walked next door to get it for us. We were amazed! Beside the beautiful bottle of St Emilion Grand Cru wine and our favorite lamb shank dish, Sunil made our night!

4.0,2/16/2014,"Went to Marseille before seeing a show. Overall it was a great place for a casual dinner. It had a lively french bistro vibe from the decor to lighting, the place was full by the time we finished dinner. For first course me and a friend had french onion soup. After hearing a friend rave about the soup who went there the night before, it was a must try. The broth had a nice deep flavor, and I was expecting the cheese to be mild & gooey, but had more of a distinct flavor than I'm used to (for my American Taste), they must of used a high quality gruyere. My other friend had the calamari, which was hot and crispy, and had a nice aioli sauce. You seriously can't go wrong with calamari.For the entrees I had beef short rib bourguignon and my other friends had the hanger steak and duck breast, and we all shared a little. The hanger steak with frites was alright, a little on tough side for medium, the duck breast was pretty good, and while I liked my short ribs, I thought the meat was good, but the sauce was better. I kept having some of my friends duck and dipping it in my sauce (That would be a good dish!)Of course we can't forget dessert, we shared creme brulee, and it was good.Service was good, very attentive til the end when we were waiting for our check a little bit longer than we would of liked.

We ordered some pommes frites, because. . .. it's a French brasserie, sort of. The pistou was delicious, served with a large cheese crisp. The risotto, also delicious, with great depth of flavor and texture. My chicken, served with crisp potatoes and truffle oil, was absolutely delicious. An excellent portion, perfectly cooked and sauced precisely. The salmon was also fantastic, fresh and redolent of tarragon and mustard. The pommes frites were likewise terrific.They ran out of our favorite dessert, an apple crisp, but obliged with a pear bread pudding, and brought us complimentary muscat with dessert.

I had originally stayed away from this place because I thought it was just for tourists, but it's actually a really lovely neighborhood spot too.  What keeps me coming back is Jimmy - my favorite bartender in New York - and I have done my research!  Here's what's great about Jimmy: (1) he makes the absolute best martini in the world - crisp, smooth - perfect; (2) he has that perfect balance of making you feel comfortable but still leaving you to your own thoughts if that's what you need; and (3) he's interesting and fun to talk to when that's what you're in the mood for. I've noticed that it's a bar where you often see people (women especially) enjoying a nice meal alone, and I think that's a credit to Jimmy, who makes it feel like a warm but still elegant place.  Although I don't always eat there, I've enjoyed every dish I've had - everything is fresh and tasty.  It can get crowded of course, and the dining room can get loud if you're eating out with say, parents who have a harder time hearing, but other than that it's a perfect place for dinner.  And always a perfect place for a drink.",0,0,0,Nina C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0

For our entrees, it was sort of bland. It felt more like a chain restaurant. I ordered the lamb shank over couscous which had no flavor in it.

I also liked how it wasn't incredibly noisy and  I could hear my dining companion easily.The waiter was super relaxed and polite as it took us forever to decide on our entrees.  I chose the scallops as it was suppose to have a bit of jalapeno flavor to it.  Unfortunately, my dish came with only three very tiny scallops that tasted like any other scallop.  If my date was paying $23 for this (before tax and tip), I would've hoped this entree would have something a little bit unique to it (like the jalapeno mentioned on the menu...).  His salmon fared a bit better and was cooked well.We capped off the meal with a super strong coffee (strong as in I did not sleep that night) which I actually enjoyed more than my meal.To sum it up - not the worst place I've been to but it didn't stand out to me.",1,2,1,Elyssa J.,"Manhattan, NY",295,590,142

The food was ok, though not particularly memorable - like the lamb with veggies in a tomato sauce is something you could cook at home. And so are scallops with kale burnt to a crisp. The ambiance is the same as the other places I mentioned, though with a bit cheaper decor (Hell's Kitchen). The wine list is outrageous: it's huge but everything is priced ridiculously high, so you can't really spend less than $100 unless you're getting vinegar. The sommelier tried to defend it by saying they had ""unique"" bottles, but the Lebanese wine which I knew well was all priced at $100-200, and it's more like a $50 wine (at restaurant prices). The rest of the list is very skewed towards French, so I guess they can just pretend it's fancy wine by saying it's French. Our $88 bottle of pinot noir (sommelier's recommendation) was average.

Though they participate in Restaurant Week, we decided to order off the menu instead. I had the duck pate for my appetizer and the duck breast for dinner. Can you tell I love duck? The duck pate was quite a big portion and I did like the gelee on top which gave it a sweeter touch. It was very rich and enough for myself and my dining partners to share. I also tried my friend's escargot which was very flavorful and decadent in the garlic oil. My duck breast entree was perfectly cooked and came with an amazing sauce.

So I went with the calamari. Wow, it did not disappoint. It wasn't like an ordinary italian fried calamari, it was a french fried calamari. I don't know how to describe it, but the pieces were bigger, the calamari was still crispy, and it was delicious. Instead of putting the marinara sauce on the side they put it on the bottom, and boy that thing was delicious. I would eat that dish forever.I also had the steak frites. They were okay.

My friend had the corn salad, lamb entrée, and apple pastry.  All in all, everything was delicious, fresh, and our server was both very pleasant and attentive.  We came in before five, and you might want to get there around then also, as it starts to get quite busy and bustling by the six o'clock hour.  It was just a couple of blocks away from the show we had tickets for, so the location also gets five stars for convenience.  The prices in general are right, here, and the quality is just wonderful.  I highly recommend it.",0,0,0,Elena P.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,9,0

Service was great and our waiter was very attentive in spite of the packed restaurant. Also, they were smart enough to put in 2 women's and 1 men's restroom- it's the little things that count. My only issue to bring it down from 5 to 4 stars is that the table was uncomfortably small. All of our dinner plates were touching each other's and it is a miracle that nothing was spilled. The food was amazing. 5 stars all the way! I had the beat and goat cheese agnolotti, which was the best part of my meal. Instead of a normal meat stuffing, these were stuffed with a beet and cheese puree and had an fantastic butter sauce. For the entree, I ordered the diver scallops with a broccoli puree (which tasted like green peas but was still delicious). For dessert, I indulged in the dark chocolate torte with what I think was homemade chocolate ice cream.

I had 3 big scallops on nice puree sauce and spring carrots. I really like my dish and was full after it surprisingly. For dessert, I ended with a Chocolate Torte. It was not as good as most chocolate cakes I have had because the cake is too dry for me. Overall, the food is decent for a French Bistro type of restaurant. However, our waitress was kind of slow.

With the tahini sauce, a perfect appetizer to start with. Plenty of other choices, all looked good as they came & went to the surrounding eaters.2 Steaks & Frites next. Done perfectly, with a sauce to die for and although the Frites were actually fries, a minor deduction, the waiter brought a garlic aioli to dip them in, after we made mention of their thickness.  So far the service had improved, 2 waiters were checking in with us and the place was FULL.To compensate for the initial slow start, 2 glasses of bubbly arrived, compliments of the house.

Or even really going out to restaurants or any of that (I still do break down and eat pizza, so don't feel too bad for me), so I was actually ridiculously excited about going here. Specifically in a brunch capacity, and specifically for french toast.So I got the french toast. And it was awful. I might even go with ""barely edible"" as descriptors. They breaded it with something? It looked like cinnamon, but then it wasn't.  It was sad, and maybe my expectations were too high, but I don't think good french toast in New York City in Hell's Kitchen is too much to ask for. I actually moved the plate aside, because... ew.To their credit, the manager dude came over and asked me if everything was okay. I am by no means a complainer, and I was with friends I haven't seen in literally years, so the whole thing was kind of awkward. I ended just getting some bacon and eggs, because... you can't mess that up, right?The eggs were kinda soggy though. But I had nice things to say about the bacon.Michelle and Liz liked their food, but it was rather sad looking. Our waitress was really fun, and we overall had a great time here.

4.0,2/19/2013,"My girlfriend and I decided to celebrate Valentines Day on Friday the 15th and I had planned a night in the city. I chose Marseille based upon its close proximity to the hotel we were staying and some previous Yelp reviews. It ended up being a great choice. We made 7:30 reservations and arrived a bit early. The hostess greeted us and said she would have us seated shortly and invited us to have a drink at the bar while we wait. The crowd was large, many eating before a Broadway show I presume. The restaurant is comfortable with most people casually dressed and having a good time. The noise level is loud but not to the point where you have to raise your voice to converse. which I think is the perfect level for a great dinner experience.The bar along with the entire restaurant is cozy and definitely gives off the vibe of being in an upscale cafe. Drinks were prompt and to order. We were sat before we could finish our first drink and quickly greeted by our waiter. He was very informative of the menu and was able to answer any questions regarding the preparation and was glad to help out with a custom order. The food came out on time despite the restaurant being very busy. This must be a norm for them because despite how busy it was, it was not chaotic and the place seemed calm despite the large crowd. The staff is definitely well prepared and trained. The food was very good and the plates were nicely put together. For an app we had the Kale salad with Pork Belly strips. That was awesome and something I have not seen at other restaurants. My girlfriend had the steak and it was cooked perfectly and I had the braised beef which was delicious . The meat was tender and flavorful. I also had the French onion soup, which was one of the best I have ever had. We did not do desert because we were full and decide to walk and check out another place later on for coffee and desert.Overall a great experience, with good food, good staff and a good atmosphere.

My boyfriend said it was one of the best he's ever had, and that's saying a lot since he loves them. We waited no more than 15 minutes and were taken to a table. If you ask me, that was great since we didn't have any reservations and it seemed busy. I started with a Nutella croissant...delicious and my boyfriend got the mixed berries.

Basically a puff pastry with cheese dumped in the middle. The fries came out greasy and cold, and the calamari we sent back because it was too rubbery to eat.I can't speak about a novice bartender, that's management's mishap, but the chef should at least be able to fry a decent pomme frite.

4.0,8/11/2012,"Lovely surprise in the heart of midtown!Marseille should get four and a half stars, but Yelp hasn't evolved to the half star rating yet, so I docked it a full star (we'll get to that later though).  I came here with my mom before seeing a Friday evening show of One Man, Two Guvnors (SEE IT if you can before it closes Sept. 2!  SO FUNNY!).  We arrived about ten to five (our res was for 5), and the hostess very nicely informed us that, though they officially opened at five and thus were unprepared to seat us, we were welcome to have a seat at the bar and have a drink.  The restaurant itself is very pretty and ""French"" looking, as some other commenters have mentioned.  Around 5:00 the bartender informed us our table was ready and the moment we settled up the hostess met us at the bar and walked us to our table.  Such service!  Service is a hallmark of Marseilles; the service at this restaurant was impeccable.  We were seated at a table for two facing 9th Ave.  My mom is very sensitive to sunlight, and so she sat facing me and away from the window; still, though, the sun was a little much on her neck and back.  She asked a busser if he could lower the shade, and he went one step further and went outside to roll the awning out a few more feet.  My mom was much more comfortable after that, and it was such a thoughtful gesture.  Our waiter set a nice pace throughout the dinner; he was attentive but not overly so, and though the restaurant filled up quickly once we were sat, we were never rushed.  Water was poured promptly once we sat, drink orders taken immediately, and bread was served.  And such bread!  Soft and fresh and very, very good.  It comes with softened butter served in olive oil, with enough olive oil to use simply that if you don't want butter.  I tried it all ways: butter with oil, plain oil, plain bread (on one piece of bread!  Don't be judgy): the verdict?  All ways were delicious.   We started dinner off with two appetizers: the goat cheese tarte and the hummus bi tahini.  Both were excellent, but the hummus appetizer was amazing (I have to admit though, I'm somewhat of a hummus fanatic).  The tarte was a very tasty baked and flaky bit of goat cheese, neither too big or too small; it's a nice start to share for two, but one could consume it easily, if one has only that appetizer.  The hummus bi tahini consists of a plate of fresh hummus with a dollop of tahini in the middle and surrounded by warm pita slices.  The hummus and tahini were so fresh and delicious; I would definitely get that again.  For our entrees I got the sweet pea tortolonni and my mom got the bleu cod.  She liked her dinner very much; it came with come kind of bean.  It actually looked tasty for fish, which I nearly never eat.  My sweet pea tortolonni was delectable, and I believe handmade.  It was fragrant.  The only reason Marseilles lost a star (really a half star!  Get on that, Yelp!) in my book was dessert.  I thought with the quality of food that night that dessert would be amazing.  I was unfortunately proved wrong.  My mom and I shared the apple crisp and...I would just say avoid  Maybe their other desserts are better.  The crisp was like...I don't know.  A baked piece of nothing.  No apple taste, no crisp, just like, baked phyllo dough, and I recognized some apple slices, but I couldn't really taste apple in it.  It was hard to break apart, and it wasn't really worth it.  It came with a small dollop of vanilla ice cream, which was the only edible thing about it.  To say I was disappointed in that ""apple crisp"" is an understatement.However, I do plan on coming back to Marseilles, so I may be able to update you on its desserts should I brave another one.  Good food, though, a nice ambiance, and its proximity to theaters (if you're seeing a show) makes this a destination for sure.",3,1,1,Kim M.,"New York, NY",25,155,0

Meals:Everyone at the table enjoyed their meals. Specifically, the chopped salad with grilled shrimp (nicknamed the ""Babson"" because one of our firm's partners frequents Marseille so often and orders the same thing). I had a vegetarian couscous to-go and really enjoyed it. It was authentically Algerian (which is why I guess they had it at a French place considering the high number of North Africans in France). I really liked it. I wish it had a bit more variety in vegetables, but the vegetables were VERY fresh and had a great crunch to it without being undercooked. My co-worker said one of the best salmon he had was from this spot because of  the sauce, salad and lentils.

So I decided to give this place a try and  ordered their brioche French toast. It's not your average French toast dipped in maple syrup. They pour some kind of heavy and very sweet syrup all over the toast, which I didn't really like that much because it was way too sweet for my brunch appetite. I also don't like how my toast was so drenched with the syrup, it was all too soggy. Sad to say but my side order of pommes frites tasted so much better. Overall, it's a nice restaurant with a very Frenchy ambiance. I think I just made a poor choice in my selection but the egg omelettes that my friends ordered looked pretty normal and delicious.

The bread starter is not great...cold chewy generic bread with butter that's drowned in surprisingly tasteless olive oil. There's a pretty great prix fixe dining menu for $35 for an appetizer, entree, and dessert.  I had a lovely spring risotto to start, which had fresh peas and mushrooms.  My entree was a homemade tortellini, again, with fresh peas and micro greens.  Dessert was a tough decision b/c the menu sounded wonderful...we settled on sugared beignets with a dark chocolate fondue.  The service was very good...attentive without being intrusive, and he delivered our food at just the right speed in time to get us fed before we left for the theatre.",0,0,0,Lucy W.,"Atlanta, GA",18,1033,683

My Tuscan chicken (""under a brick"") was fine, but the skin was not crisp (Isn't' that the whole point of anything under a brick?), and it was not particularly moist. I tasted the lamb shank, which was flavorful but stringy and, frankly, unappealing.Desserts varied. My chocolate cremeux was served too cold to really taste, but the beignets came in a gigantic pile of fried pillowy goodness. In addition to wine (obviously), there's a cocktail menu and interesting beers, some of them Belgian (nowhere near the South of France, but who's complaining?). In spite of the 2-star food, I'm going up to 3 because the service was attentive and amiable, even as the place filled up. It's a lively, relaxed atmosphere.

Via a $35 prix fixe, I started with the arugula salad--they wisely kept it basic with parmesan and olive oil.  Fresh and tasty.  Followed with the roast chicken which surprised me: juicy, flavorful appeal, on a bed of interestingly spiced veggies and broth.  Not bad at all.  I lucked out and got the bottle of beer I chose on the first pick (my first visit they'd been out of multiple brews, despite an appealing--and sizable--beer list), though it should be pointed out the bottle cost $16!  Please.Our wait service was fine, perfectly tolerable.  What is NOT tolerable are the tables in the far corner by the bar--between the window banquettes, which are situated so low that diners practically bang their chins on the table, and a HVAC setup that blows hot air from the ceiling at gale force that blows the table candles out, it was certainly clear that we'd arrived without a reservation and were being banished.I get it; you're busy, you're full up this evening--so just say so and let us dine at an establishment that gives a shit.  Either improve the tables that you legitimately seat people at--or turn them away with an apology and a smile.  Two stars for the food, and a big ruh-roh to the rest of this joint.",1,1,0,Jeff D.,"Portland, OR",8,81,0

Oh.. they gave out a rose to all the ladies.. :)I really like the environment here.. not too quiet and not too noisy.. so I do not have to eat like a ""lady"".. lol.. Start of with their bread... mmm.. they have one of the best bread in NYC... I am serious!! If only the bread was served a little hotter.. but well.. I had most of it before the meal came...I ordered a fish.. I forgot what's the name of it.. All I remembered the name was BOLD... which means it's their specialty.. It's fish with a lot of cheese on it... and some oranges besides.. I am not a huge fan of cheese.. but the cheese was perfect.. not too filling.. just nice for me to enjoy it.. I thought the portion was huge but it was not!! I just love it... my date ordered the Hudson Valley Chicken Breast.. It's grilled chicken breast with a garlic that you can spread on it... I am curious on how they cut and make their garlic into such a nice shape.. Dessert... We ordered the dark chocolate pudding.. I don't see it on the website now.. It's basically tasted like a chocolate cake/pudding with cream on top.. except the chocolate taste was so strong and we really like it..The waitress was extremely nice to us and she took her time to explain her favorite dish and dessert to us..And to be honest.. it's not expensive.. compare to lots of restaurant.. :)",1,0,3,Shing Yiing O.,"Manhattan, NY",384,624,603

2.0,2/13/2012,"Owned by the same people as Nizza next door. Well... what do the two restaurants have in common? Neither Nizza serves truly Italian food, nor does Marseille serve authentically French cuisine. That said, don't come here expecting sophisticated French cooking. Nothing really stands out about Marseille's food for me, although I think coming here during brunch is a far safer bet. They serve plenty of complimentary muffins and breads with butter with your meal, and brunch entrees fall within in $8-$16 range. The flavors are undoubtedly American though, mixed with some confusing Moroccan and sometimes French influences... i.e. merguez sausage and ratatouille with poached eggs.Overall I prefer the service and ambiance here more than Nizza.

3.0,11/7/2011,"This place is truly like a French impressionist work of art - looks great from far away, but kind of a mess up-close.  From afar, Marseille shines like  the street front of Moulin Rouge, and displays a busy view of patrons clinking their wine glasses and silverware against a candle-lit backdrop and intimate conversations.  But,  up-close and personal, the whole experience is kind of a wreck.  The service was slow here - everything from ordering and receiving our beverages and food, to paying for the meal.  Also, our waiter appeared to try to fake his way through recommending wine for us. I don't know what most of you think, but isn't a pinot generally lighter and LESS full-bodied than a cab?  He told us the contrary.  He also highly recommended the house cab for us, so we ordered it.  Not poured at table and served in Munchkin-sized chalices, it was flat, without any interesting qualities.  While the menu wasn't striking, nor was it classically French, the food was good.  The arugula salad with pickled onions and shaved parmesan was nice - simple, not overly dressed, with a subtle nuttiness from a well-aged block of parmesan.  Also, the pappardelle with ground veal and citrus rosemary ragout was good.  Nothing special, but the pappardelle seemed homemade - generously wide pasta strips, delicate but al dente. The beignets for dessert were greasy, burnt, and overly sweet.  I certainly didn't need the chocolate syrup drizzled on top.Overall, the food was nothing to write home about, but was still the saving grace for the night.  With all of the other options in the neighborhood, I'd probably pass Marseille up next time, especially if I had a performance to get to right after dinner.

We decided to get the duck liver mousse since so many people on this website gave rave reviews about it, and I'm glad I ordered it! The rhubarb gelee on top of the liver mousse provided a very nice balance and contrast to the mousse itself. It also came with a little side salad with walnuts that I didn't expect to be dressed, but it was with a tangy dressing that cut through the mousse too. Very nice starter. I'll recommend this to everyone who goes to Marseille.I ordered the Croque Madame and my friend ordered the multi-grain waffle.

I chose the 3 course prix- fixe for $35 and started my meal with some bread from the bread basket and a garden salad, bibb lettuce, hazelnuts and vinaigrette. Granted, I swapped out the mustard vinaigrette for balsamic, but the salad was a bit too simplistic. Moules Frites. The mussels with white wine, garlic and tomatoes were perfect, a balanced combination of flavors. The frites were good, crispy, lightly salted, but I have had better. My friend raved about her fish dish. She had the grilled salmon, white and green asparagus risotto with lemon and tarragon oil. I had a bite and it was heaven, salmon tender and well cooked, risotto was light and tasty. I wish I ordered what she had!

The creamy, spicy, and crunchy corn all played well together along with the earthy mushrooms.Main: Freebird chicken breast with braised endive, cress, miso - orange sauce and potato tuille. Moist, juicy chicken and well seasoned. Dessert: A cheese cake made from a typically strong cheese (I want to say goat cheese) not made for sweets. A basil ice cream and a sweet chocolate type of sauce made from balsamic vinaigrette. Sounds odd but the savory flavors played a trick on your mind as they turned to sweet. A nice way to end the meal.The dining experience was one to remember. Once you walked in you knew everything was going to fall in place.

1.0,7/22/2011,"Wow, I can't believe the way I was treated here. It's been two days and I'm still in shock at the negligence and abuse I experienced during my dinner. I came here with the BF and another couple for restaurant week. It was a Wednesday night and the restaurant was not full. I'll admit some fault by including that we were about an hour late for our reservation. However, there were tons of open tables and it didn't look like it mattered. Our server came by with menus and gave us a minute to look them over. So far so good. They brought out the bread. I took a piece and began eating since I was starving. Everyone else looked over the drink list. When the server came back to get our drink orders, they took away everybody's bread plates and knives. I was the only one who still had mine since I had a piece of bread on it. Weird but not unforgivable. When our first course came out, everyone was underwhelmed (except the BF who's tortellini was actually really well done). Then we waited. For 25 mins. Second course came out. Again I was underwhelmed. I got braised short ribs and can say that I've had better (What's up Pete at TGL!!!) The BF had the risotto and it was not good. I can't say that it was the worst I ever had, but we were at a fancy restaurant so I shouldn't have the worst ANYTHING there! The risotto was dry and mealy and the the taste was unpleasant. Then we waited. And waited. And watched as our server brought out food for the tables around us. And watched as he then brought their checks. And watched as he cleared everything away. And then watched as he stood by the hostesses and flirted. At that point my friend got up and physically grabbed the waiter to yell at him. He acted like an asshole and said ""oh are you ready to order dessert?"" So he walked over to our table and threw the menus down without a word to us knocking things around on the table. I was about ready to flip the table and walk out. But I kept my cool since Laura (hi Laura!!) was busy yelling at the hostesses. We finally put in our dessert orders and they tried to put a band aid on the whole situation in the form of complimentary tastes of wine and a couple of cookies. We ate our desserts in near silence, had to ASK for the check, paid and left wishing that we got a Papaya Dog instead.",14,7,0,Christine J.,"Levittown, NY",38,168,86
5.0,7/12/2011,"This was our fine-dining choice for a recent visit to New York, and  it passed our expectations with flying colors. The food was to die for. We treated ourselves to the goat cheese tart, just one of many unique appetizers, and I've been dreaming of that dish since; strong goat cheese in a delicate crust topped with any amazing salad. I had the artichoke ravioli and my boyfriend had a couscous dish, which were equally as good and just the right portion size. The cocktail and wine selection was superb.The environment was surprisingly laid back. We were expecting for it to be a bit stuffier, but that was not true. We were comfortable, our server waited on us hand and foot and when we were left with two drinks to finish and no food, there was not that awkward pressure to rush us out the door.I would recommend this if you're looking to celebrate a special occasion or really want a night on the town.

1.0,7/2/2011,"I really wanted to like you, Marseille.  Before the BF moved from the Fidi, we had easy access to comforting French bistro food from Les Halles and Jacques in SoHo was only a short train ride away. I had been poking around Hell's Kitchen/Theater District looking for a new place that would provide the same satisfaction of good, simple, hearty bistro fare.  Despite my wariness of Marseille due to its Port Authority location, the menu sounded intriguing.  Hanger steak frites? Check.  Provencal mussels? Check.  Daily rotating specials, including a rack of lamb dinner on Tuesdays? Check.  So, we decided to give it a whirl and booked a table for 2 at 8pm on a Tuesday night.  The interior of the restaurant is really charming, spacious and definitely evoked the feel of a Parisian Bistro.  We were seated promptly; the restaurant appeared to be 2/3 full.  Things just went downhill from there.  It took a waitress about 15 minutes to even approach our table, and the dining room was definitely not busy.  My BF was eager to try the Tuesday special, a rack of lamb dinner.  I myself was not terribly hungry so I settled for a potato leek soup and crispy calamari salad.  We decided to share an order of shrimp beignets for our appetizer.  Our shrimp beignets came -- $7 for four pinky sized fritters, each of which sat in a little puddle of spiced aioli.  The fritters were tasty -- sweet shrimp wrapped in a delicately fried batter, swathed in the creamy paprika sauce -- but SERIOUSLY? $7 for four bites? Something about grossly overpriced food just leaves a sour taste in your mouth.  After we finished our pathetic little appetizer, and waited another small eternity (a repeating theme) the lamb and my soup came.  My soup was supposed to have came with croutons, grated horseradish and parsley - none of it was present.  The flavor was fine -- starchy potatoes blended together with the oniony sweetness of leeks.  The texture was not bad, but I've definitely had smoother creamed soups before.  Most off-putting to me was the temperature.  It was not advertised to be cold like a vichyssoise, so I expected it to be piping hot.  It was lukewarm. Actually, make that tepid.  Tepid cream soup. That is definitely a big no-no.  The lamb was odd. The chops were tough and flavorless, not tender at all and lacked any sort of that wonderful gamey flavor.  The best part about the plate was the robustly earthy and salty mushroom ragu atop of a pile of creamy polenta. When I had finished my soup, I waited for my crispy calamari salad, which I expressly stated that I wanted it to arrive as my entree.  20 minutes passed between finishing my soup and when the waitress asked me if I wanted anything else. ""Yes.  I am quite ready for my salad now.  In fact I've been ready for about 20 minutes.""  She apologized profusely and another five minutes passed before my dinner arrived.  It was a disaster on a plate.  The calamari was inedible because it was so salty (props to them for frying it properly).  A strange fishy smell permeated the entire plate and the accompanying vinaigrette was harshly sour and bitter.  I took a couple of bites and put my fork down.  We paid our check as fast as we could and ran out.  Perhaps our expectations were too high, but truly, we have never been so disappointed (being the indiscriminate eaters that we are.) Maybe our visit was a total fluke -- we are temped to go back to try something more simple, like their steak frites and provencal mussels.  If they screw that up too, then they have no right to bill themselves as a French bistro.",8,0,0,Tiffany Y.,"New York, NY",39,40,11

4.0,6/20/2011,"There has been a crop of new restaurants in Hell's Kitchen lately, with even more set to open soon, but Marseille has been a mainstay for many years now.  It's one of my fave pre- or post-theater dining spots because the food is always delicious and the service is always good.  For a pre-show meal, the servers are very mindful about getting your food out expediently so you won't miss your curtain.  They have it down to a science here, and as an avid theatergoer, I appreciate that.  They make good use of their ample space, so it's perfect for both group dining or a romantic night for two.  The tables are also spaced out really well so you don't feel like you're on top of each other.  And even though it's usually busy, it never feels super crowded and the volume-levels always stay moderate.I've had dinner here many times but brunch only once.  The dinner menu has quite a few options, while I feel that brunch is more limited.  Everything I've tried on the menu has been delicious and executed well.  The fish entrees and tagines are equally tasty, so there's something for all cravings.  The portions are also perfect - not too huge but not skimpy either.  If you're especially hungry, go for the 3-course prix-fixe dinner for $35.  Sometimes when a restaurant offers a prix-fixe, the entree is one of the less popular or less desirable items, but not here.  I highly recommend the steak frites, but be warned you might be too full for dessert!  The pot de cream is chocolately and sweet, and the creme brulee is rich and decadent.It's definitely not the cheapest of restaurants in the area, but I think it's worth paying a little more for ambiance, decor and a quality dining experience.  You can go before a show to make sure your tummy won't rumble before the end of Act 1, or go after to leisurely discuss the drama you just witnessed.  Or both!  4.5 stars",5,0,1,Kristine R.,"Astoria, NY",299,363,1

The wait staff was a little slow, but not terrible. We decided to have wine, from their extensive wine list, with panisse ($5)and shrimp beignets ($7) for apps. I thought they were both delishes, especially the beignets, which were perfectly fried.  For entrees, we ordered the duck ($28) and salmon ($24).  The duck was ordered medium rare, but came out well done and looked like a re-heat. Had to be sent back. When it came back out it was pretty much raw, but edible. The salmon wasn't bad. It was cooked nicely and came with a creamy asparagus risotto. It was a bit too lemony for my taste though and the plate was bland; felt like it was missing something.  We decided to skip dessert and go for ice cream somewhere else.

Anyway, we got seated pretty quickly on a Saturday afternoon, which was nice. They gave us a basket of table bread including mini carrot muffins and some sort of sweet grainy bread that was pretty yummy as well.They have a good selection of omlettes, but I caved to my sweet tooth and ordered french toast with a crushed cereal crust and caramelized bananas. It was REALLY good and would have been even better if I had ordered it for dessert! They sort of slopped on a lot of caramel sauce that made the top slice of toast pretty soggy (although still tasty). The cereal crust gave it a nice crunch, and the brioche they used was fluffy and dense at the same time--if that's possible. The omelettes my friends ordered were great, and the house potatoes that came with them were dressed in some delicious sort of pesto sauce. The reason for docking some stars--although the servers were nice, it was REALLY hard to get their attention, even though there seemed to be a ton of the running around. The salad that comes with the egg dishes was very bland--literally like they just chopped (roughly) some lettuce and threw it on the plate to fill up some empty space.

3.0,2/1/2011,"During one of my stays in midtown I stumbled, although not literally, upon Merseille and decided to whet my appetite with some brunch at this Hell's Kitchen establishment. The decor is what I've come to expect from most French brasseries and with a modest wait and packed dining room I was ensured that the quality of food would match my expectations. Maybe my expectations were to high, or maybe I'm judging too harshly against their Saturday brunch service, but either way this is my experience.My companion and I started with drinks, sampling the Moroccan Bloody, the Ruby Red Sunrise, and the Bellini Martini. Of the three all were fairly standard, not overly alcoholic, not terribly creative, yet fair representations of morning cocktails you'd find on most brunch menus. If I had to chose a favorite, it might have been the Bellini being partial to peach puree and the choice of Skye Vodka over most other house blends or even Absolut for that matter.For my meal I had the Poached Eggs Provencal which should have been a slam dunk, but fell short on many aspects of its profile. First, the ratatouille was extremely bland for Provencal cuisine which leads me to believe that timing is not something that is taken into consideration when it comes to cultivating flavor. It could very well be that they ran out of the original batch that day, but I would have taken it off the menu if that were the case. It's almost embarrassing to try to pass bland ratatouille off as country fare. Further, the olives seemed out of place, but whatever, they're entitled to put their own spin on things. The poached eggs were barely runny and the sauce was suspiciously reminiscent of others that I've known to be poured straight from the can.All in all the experience was a bit of a let down, however given the close proximity to my friend's apartment I would consider giving it another shot. It was clean, the staff was attentive and friendly, and I cannot pass up affordable French cuisine to save my life, especially in New York. The only thing I might change is that I would likely be dining during lunch hours and skip the breakfast...",0,0,1,Mike O.,"London, United Kingdom",244,246,163
4.0,1/31/2011,"Let me start this review by saying... I seriously love this place!My first time at Marseille was when I lived 2 blocks away, and my most recent excursion was 3 days ago. I can't recall a time when I didn't enjoy the food.The most enjoyable meals I've had at Marseille have been during Restaurant Week. I have to say, out of all the restaurants in NYC I've been to during Restaurant Week, Marseille has some of the best menus. Unlike some other restaurants that don't put any effort into Restaurant Week, Marseille actually manages new items that's not on their regular menu.I especially enjoyed the Winter 2011  menu, from appetizer to dessert.Appetizers1. Baby calamari. Cooked tender and full of flavor! There was a heaping portion of big pieces of calamari. Delicious!2. Beef tartare. I usually don't eat raw beef but this was absolutely amazing! Mixing the quail egg with the tartare and eating it with the crispy wafer and mustard sauce... YUM!EntreeThe waiter enthusiastically recommended the pork tenderloins, so both of us got that. It came with shimeji mushrooms and baby carrots in this amazingly flavorful sauce! Mmmmm~Dessert1. Roasted pineapple. I've eaten plenty of pineapple before, but roasted pineapple? Never! It was tart and sweet at the same time, a party of flavors in my mouth!2. Chocolate sabayon torte. With candied kumquats and passion fruit sorbet. I chose this dessert purely because of the kumquats - I love love LOVE them! The chocolate torte was more like dense chocolate mousse and it was absolutely delicious! Coupled with the sweet and tart kumquats and passion fruit - it was a perfectly balanced dessert.Some of my friends don't like Marseille and I can't figure out why! The decor is lovely and the atmosphere is relaxed. The food has a very warm feeling to it and I really like that - makes for a comfortable and enjoyable meal!",3,0,1,Sherry L.,"San Francisco, CA",339,960,2427

We were seated on a Friday night straight away for our 6:15 res. My wife thought her Dirty Martini was excellent. We went prix fix and we enjoyed all. The Arugula salad was very fresh and tasty. I had the leek soup, also very good. We had entrees of the Lamb  and steak frites. The steak was a bit  tough in parts- the meal's only low-point.. My wife prefers  med-well and I felt that cut may have been better med or med-rare. My Lamb was very good.Dessert menu had a good selection. Both choices were tasty. Service was also good. Our waiter asked if we were in a hurry or wished to take our time. We indicated our desire to get to a show at 8pm and he accommodated us nicely.

I had to ask for the Bernaise sauce - The dish was served to me without the Bernaise.Service was slow and cold, which bothered me, as that particular night, the restaurant looked to be pretty slow.  But, not atrociously, offensively so.  I just felt a couple aspects of the service could have been cleaned up.All in all, not a bad experience by any means.  I just did not feel that the average/average plus meal I had, at the price, warranted a four star rating.  I will definitely be back, but it's not on my ""to do"" list.",0,0,0,Josh D.,"Denver, CO",220,639,0

3.0,10/5/2010,"My momma and I stopped in for Saturday brunch before our matinee performance of the Phantom of the Opera. The location of Marseille is prime for Broadway show goers who are looking for a place to dine before or after the show. The interior is reminiscent of a French bistro. It's lovely and really cute. Like an elegant cute sort of way... if that makes any sense. We were seated next to a huge vase of fresh lilies so it smelled of fragrant flowers for the duration of our meal which was pleasant.To start off, we ordered the tuna tartare to share. The tuna was mixed with diced jalepeno, cucumber, radish and topped with a spicy sauce. It came in three mini tortilla bowls (like the ones they give you when you order a taco salad). It was a nice, light dish to start with. I thought it was too salty, but my momma seemed to enjoy it. She even talked about trying to recreate it at home (my parents do that a lot. They always think they can recreate a ""better"" version of it at home. Weirdos). Then came our brunch dishes. I ordered the eggs benedict with Canadian bacon and my mom ordered the omelette lorraine. Both came with a small salad and home fries. I liked the eggs benedict. The english muffin was toasted perfectly and the hollandaise sauce was creamy. IMO, the egg was a touch under poached. The egg whites were runny; it looked like snot. Not very appetizing. The omelette lorraine consisted of egg, comte cheese, bacon and caramelized onions. I thought it was delicious. It had a lot of flavor and was very filling. My mom enjoyed it too, which is saying a lot since she doesn't usually like heavy Western foods.Overall, I liked Marseille's atmosphere and food.

3.0,9/18/2010,"We came to Marseille for dinner before a show. The restaurant is definitely convenient to Broadway, and they managed to serve us a three course dinner in under an hour-and-a-half, which was definitely a plus. The interior is decorated in French bistro fashion, and is quite attractive. The noise level was medium-bustling, which was to be expected on a Friday night. Though we got a table in the center of the room, the experience was still pleasant--the tables are set far enough apart that you don't feel uncomfortable. Our server was okay: he was polite enough; however, at the start of our meal he was a bit pushy about trying to get us to order cocktails and bottled water, and I heard him recommending some of the more expensive wines and dishes at the table next to ours.Overall, the food was very satisfactory: it wasn't remarkable, but it was tasty enough. We started out by splitting the goat cheese tart, which was okay. I found it very run-of-the-mill: the goat cheese was good, not great, and the plating was rather unimaginative. The frisee on top was tasty, but a more generous serving of the tomato really would have helped the dish out. For an entree, I had the lamb shank couscous, which was very tasty. The North African spices in the dish were very well done and it had a nice heartiness to it. For $22 I would have liked to have had a bit more lamb on the plate. My boyfriend's steak was also good (he ordered the steak frites), although bear in mind that the chef is willing to serve you rare meat when you ask for it. The accompanying bearnaise sauce was okay (I've had better); however, the frites were wonderful! For dessert, the dark chocolate tart with salted caramel ice cream and fried bananas was excellent, while the beignets with chocolate dipping sauce were also good.

The risotto and ravioli were both so creamy and melt-in-your-mouth succulent. They also did a great job with the apple tart. although I would definitely recommend serving it with some whipped cream or ice cream.My friends ordered the lamb with kous kous and several seafood items. All three had nothing negative to say except for the chocolate tart which was quite dry (it was the only thing we did not scrape clean).  I am not wine savvy enough to tell you about the quality of wine there but I had a glass of sauvignon blanc and enjoyed it very much. They also have this great special if you do chose to do restaurant week where you can get three glasses of wine with your restaurant week order for just $15! Wish they had a vegetable option that I wanted just for that special, but I think everyone should take advantage of it!",1,0,1,Raina B.,"Ann Arbor, MI",106,271,11

5.0,6/29/2010,"I went here for an impromptu late night dinner with friends on a Friday night. No waiting for a table (which I didn't think was possible on a Friday in NYC), and the decor was really lovely. I'm not great at describing aesthetics, but it was clean, had a good mix of vintage and modern (dark wood, some leather seating, white floors) and an overall great and friendly vibe. Our waiter was excellent--a great attitude and knowledgeable about the menu. The three of us had very different tastes and he managed to help us each pick an entree out of their substantial menu that ended up being very satisfying. I had something simple, the steak frites bearnaise (this was a while back, and I got the prix fixe which was a very reasonable $35 given the quality of the food). The steak was cooked to my preference just perfectly, with an abundance of fries on the side. I'm not much of a french fry person, but even I couldn't say no--they were well cooked with a nice crunch.The dessert, a delicious creme brulee, was excellent and the surface torched quite nicely, and it was nearly fought over by my friends (I barely got a few bites, sadly). To be honest, I don't really remember my appetizer, but I think it was soup--that might have been unmemorable, but it doesn't mean it wasn't delicious at the time. I was so happy to discover this little gem for myself--definitely one of the better meals I've had in this city, and the type of place I would take my parents, an out of town guest (especially given its proximity to Times Square), or really anyone who wanted a good hearty meal in a classy and friendly atmosphere.",0,0,0,Darjeeling T.,"Washington, DC",2,81,1

4.0,6/3/2010,"Marseille was my french connection dinner location last evening. Occupying a surprisingly sunny corner in Hell's Kitchen, Marseille's menu reflects the French port's status as an immigration hub from the former French colonies of North Africa-- think Algeria.So besides the traditional steak frites, you'll also see couscous and lamb and hummus on the menu.Marseille offers a $35 prix-fixe that includes a choice of salad, risotto or soup. The entree choice is lamb couscous, hangar steak, chicken provencal, moules frites or fluke fillet. And, as an added benefit, you'll have access to any dessert on the menu.I bypassed the prix-fixe, however, for the sake of trying panisse.What is panisse? Chick pea flour that's been formed into squares, fried and served with mayo. The panisse at Marseille was delicious and I strongly recommend trying it. (in fact, I'd go back just for panisse and a beer at the bar. Or cocktail. Or one of their many wines.)Service was quick and attentive. Water refills were plentiful and the staff gave us enough leisure time after dinner instead of shooing us out.As my entree I ordered the Moroccan lamb, which included braised swiss chard, pistachios, olives , all served in a spicy aioli.The meat was tender, the seasoning subtle and not at all hot. My one disappointment was the exclusion of any starch but that was a fact I knew ahead of time by reading the menu. My mother's prix-fixe lamb included couscous and was equally tender, falling off the bone.My father ordered the moules frites and was quite happy with the large number of shells on his plate. A fairly large side bowl of fries complement the mussels.With access to any dessert, my mother ordered the beignets, small pillows of fried dough with powdered sugar. Included was a chocolate dipping sauce that wasn't even necessary as the beignets alone were sweet enough.By the time we were ready to leave the place was packed and would-be diners sent to wait at the bar.

The food came out within a decent time. Some sides were missing, and some requests (like, no peppers) were not honored. As far as how it tasted... it was okay, nothing blew me away though.

5.0,8/11/2009,"So while in New York we walked a few blocks down from our hotel near Hells Kitchen and stopped to checkout the menu at Marseille.  The menu looked great and prices seemed reasonable so we decided to check out the place.  The decor was nice and the place was very dimly lit with only a few people seated inside.  Outside they offered a small patio which faced 9th ave and was packed with people sitting at table and standing just inside the railings.  We actually visited the restaurant twice and sat in the dinning room the first night at at the bar the second night.  The service at the bar was much better.  Both nights the bar and the dinning room were not very busy.From other reviews it looks like this is a great place for brunch but the dinner menu had a few unique offerings so I am glad we came for dinner instead.  My wife and I both shared each entree so we could taste as much as possible from the menu.  We ordered on the first night the Crispy Sweetbreads with asparagus tips, spring onions, caper sauce, verjus-raisins & crispy onion rings as an hors d'oeuvre and it blew us away.  I have always wanted to try sweebreads and I was in no way let down.  For our entree we split the Monkfish Baby Calamari with artichokes, green olives, coco beans, cream & espalette chili oil.  I love monkfish and this was some of the best I have ever had.  It was perfectly cooked and didn't have the rubbery texture that it can sometimes get.The second night at the bar we sat and ordered hors d'oeuvres in order to try a few things that we had no room for the first night.  This time we tried the Grilled Octopus with fennel, preserved lemon, olives, avocado & serrano chili and also ordered the Ricotta Gnocchi with peas, parmesan cream sauce & basil.  The octopus was great but the ricotta gnocchi was the show stopper.  So creamy and rich and the peas were just perfect with a little pop when we bit into each one.All in all this is one of my favorite places we ate at in New York and I hope to go back soon.",1,0,0,Joe F.,"Dallas, TX",47,13,13
4.0,8/10/2009,"I have been attracted to this French-inspired corner cafe for quite some time. I finally caved and went to enjoy their Saturday brunch. Boy oh boy...it was delicious. The decor of the inside is a snazzy version of early 1900's design. The rich colors and warm lighting create a smooth, warm atmosphere and instantly establish this place as ""welcoming.""We opted for a sidewalk table, due to the uncharacteristically cool breeze that surprised us mid-summer.The food was delicious. I had the Asparagus & Goat Cheese Omelette--while my friends enjoyed the Moroccan Omelette (tomatoes, peppers, olives, spicy harissa & feta cheese) and the Multi Grain Waffle ( with strawberries, whipped cream and maple syrup). The food came very quickly and was presented without any flare...just the basics. They didn't need any distracting frills...it was good food served fast with excellent flavor.

I ordered the smoked duck with bing cherries, sliced turnips, and little bits of pie crust that was even juicier than the lamb. We couldn't finish everything because there was just waaay too much meat. The dessert menu was also interesting. My friend ordered the creme brulee with strawberries and blueberries that comes with a side of champagne granite, which absolutely brought the entire meal to a nice ending.

I've seen this neighborhood evolve but somehow Marseille is able to stay the course. I guess a great meal combined with good service and value never goes out of style. Even with the recent economic turmoil, the place is always packed. On my most recent visit I ordered the Pre-Theatre meal. I could not believe that I had a Tomato-Rhubarb Gazpacho, a perfectly cooked 12oz steak with fries and a bowl of mixed berries with chantily cream for $30. My girlfriend ordered the Restaurant Week menu and she had the calamari appetizer and the Beef Cheek Salad with a peach soup for dessert. The peach soup was out of this world. Service was very attentive. Every time we went out for smoke (I know I should quit) or to the restroom our waters were refilled and our napkins were folded back on the table.

2.0,5/29/2009,"Not my type of restaurant, honestly, but it's decent. There were a lot of old folks dining. It reminded me of Marche. The only thing that really stood out was the menu, which is not purely French (not my thing) but also had some Moroccan undertones (definitely my thing). They had this couscous dish that was okay, but nowhere near as good as the ones I've had in Morocco. Meaning: not authentic enough, but that's besides the point. What ethnic cuisine is really authentic outside the borders of the country of origin? Beware small portions. I didn't even realize that the pistachio-crusted tuna I ordered was an appetizer, until they placed in front of me four small sushi-sized tuna, with a palm-sized bit of mashed chickpeas. The tuna was dull and flavorless. The pistachios were grating on my tongue and did not complement the texture of the tuna. The mashed chickpeas portion was the star of the tiny little dish.

4.0,5/20/2009,"Lillie and I arrived at the restaurant just minutes shy of our 12pm reservation, and were seated immediately. Looking around the space, Marseille vaguely resembled many of the brasseries I dined in during my trip to the French Riviera: Tarnished mirrors, large vases of fragrant flowers, intricately tiled floors and walls painted with bright Nicoise colors.Shortly after we settled in to our seats, a server approached with a basket of breads and a small saucer with butter and orange marmalade. ""We don't serve cocktails until noon, but if you ladies want to place an order for one, I can take it now. You only have to wait for about three more minutes."" Lillie requested a mimosa and I ordered a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice (which, by the way, was among the best I've ever had, with the exception of Norma's).While I found the halved slices of rye bread to be dry (and random), the basket's assortment of freshly-baked mini berry muffins were addicting. Lightly spread with butter and a dollop of orange marmalade, I could have made a meal out those alone.""Which would you recommend: Merguez Sausage and Egg Scramble or the Marseille Burger?"" I asked the server. ""Oh,"" she gushed, ""Our burger is outstanding. Definitely one of the city's best! That's what I recommend!"" Lillie perked up from reading her menu, and (almost in unison) we both exclaimed, ""I'll have the burger!""Approaching the table with a plate in each hand, our server seemed to be coming toward us in slow motion with the sounds of a church choir singing in the background. My pulse rose as I was presented with my entrée. A large oval plate arrived with: A split hamburger bun with ingredients placed on each half (meat patty topped with Comte cheese, aioli and sautéed onions on one half, and the other half topped with crisp lettuce and a tomato slice), alongside a bowl filled with homemade frites. After seasoning the burger with a dash of salt and pepper, I united the two halves and took my first bite.Each of my five senses went in to a euphoric stimulation-overdrive;the Marseille Burger was exceptional: The soft brioche bun proved to be durable enough to house the thick beef patty without falling apart. The meat was cooked until precisely ""medium"" in the center, allowing its natural juices to be successfully married with the homemade aioli. The buttery sautéed onions, fresh tomato slice, and mound of melted Comte cheese added textural decadence to the already-perfect sandwich. And the homemade frites? Among the best I've had in NYC! I finished the entire (ample) portion of these golden, crispy, perfectly salted spuds.Besides a couple of service hiccups and some dry rye bread, I was extremely pleased with my meal at Marseille. While I do plan to return in the near future, I don't think I can bring myself to order anything besides their outstanding burger.

4.0,5/16/2009,"Other than the loud and obnoxious table of 10 gay guys/straight girls next to us, this place was fab. I do have to say though, they were pretty funny when they started singing my all time fav song, ""I like to move it move it, I like to move it"", which I happened to be singing only the night before for some reason. Hmmm, I wonder why I was singing it? Now, this is gonna bother me.Anyway, the place is so french bistro, bright, airy, and just all around pleasant to be inside. And REALLY colorful. The place was so cute that I took a picture the minute I entered, despite the playful fun-making of a sassy, but funny waiter that I bumped into while taking the photo. No, I wasn't trying to take a picture of you, geez. Note that this was the same waiter who decided to mess with me and hide my camera in his apron when we were leaving the place and I ran back because I forgot my camera in the restaurant. You win again sassy/funny waiter.Two roads diverged in a yellow wood--this is my dilemma with brunch. I usually get so indecisive, but this particular day I felt more lunchy, while my cuz and bro took the breakfast path. I ordered the Marseille Burger, which was topped with sauteed onions and comte cheese with an optional piece of purple lettuce and tomato to put on top. It also came with frites and aioli. All of it was absolutely delish and the burger was appropriately tender and juicy. My brother ordered the Eggs Copenhagen, which is exactly like a Benedict, but with smoked salmon instead of canadian bacon. The salmon was sooooo good, which seemed to be the case for all salmon I ate in NYC.  My cousin's omelette was a little over-filled with cheese, but it was tasty. Not my thing though. I say, if you can't steal a bite without a strand of cheese following you and fighting back, it's just too much cheese. Oh yeah, by the way, I have to give a shout out to the delicious mini muffins and apricot spread they serve as an appetizer for brunch.Overall, it was one of those light and airy experiences that I love to have for brunch, thanks to the environment and the food.

A few places in Chicago do that as well but we have all sorts of different liquor laws here. I digress.There was nothing particularly amazing about the cuisine but everything we tried was tasty.

3.0,3/11/2009,"This is going to be tricky to do...but I'm going to state an unpopular viewpoint. I didn't really like this place all that much. Overall, it was fine but for good money from a ""fancy restaurant"" I EXPECT every dish to be amazing. I'm not going to take the trendy stance that holes-in-the-wall offer the best food because I don't think they do. There are different classes and a pomegranate to banana comparison but I don't expect as much food quality, elegance and refinement from Guy's Gyros as I do from a place in Hell's Kitchen and calls itself Marseille. While I like their French/ Mediterranean fusion and the interior is gorgeous old world grandeur, I must admit I was extremely put off by my appetizer salad. Yes, a salad, but it was bad. If I hadn't been at a dinner with people I didn't know well I would have asked for something else and I'm not the person who does that. Greens, walnuts, apples, endives and a vinaigrette. Sounds simple right, ideally tasty, but at the very least harmless. There were soooo many endives in there it was like biting into a whole onion. I had to l pick around them for the scarce bits of apples and walnuts. The proportions were completely off. I like endives but they completely overpowered the other elements of the the dish--leaving a total imbalance of flavor. Picking around made it more edible but the burning sensation of endive is not what you want to have waiting for your entree. It completely soured my mouth and my mind waiting for the next dish. My entree of I believe cod, lentils, bacon, and apples was fine and actually quite well proportioned. Perfect amount of fish to base--it made the salad all the more puzzling. The beignets I had for dessert were fun with chocolate and raspberry sauces. Neither dish jumped off the page at me but both were subtle and enjoyable. Not to harp on the salad but it really was a problem. Perhaps others disagree, who am I to disagree with a real Chef, but darn it I am a passionate eater and a Yelp Elite '09 member, and I found the dish to be totally disproportionated and fatal to the meal as a whole. If I had had a better salad with my other good dishes this would have been a decent meal but something that misses the mark this intently for good money is not something that can be overlooked.",1,0,0,Matt E.,"New York, NY",30,289,0

I also tried the goat cheese salad, which had more goat cheese than salad and was overrun with beets...good salad but I'm not a beet fan.The pecan crusted tuna was pretty delicious and the two people that ordered it were disappointed with the four bite-size pieces [because it was so good]. For dinner, the mushroom risotto was perfect: creamy, mushroom-y, and rich.The smoked trout was too, too smoky--each bite was all smoke and no trout. Chicken was chicken; nothing outstanding. The calves liver was not that great.They paired it with polenta and I think spinach and the combo was just a mushy mess in your mouth. My experience with calves liver is limited, so I really don't know how it could have been improved--other than just not ordering it. Finally, desserts were all very good.

4.0,1/14/2009,"A yummy not Theatre Districty restaurant in the Theatre District.Located in a less hectic corner of the Theatre District, Marseille offers a lovely selection of FRESH INVITING FRENCH FOOD. This low light chic yet cozy bistro can get a little loud at rush dinner time but late night (11pm) when my friend and I went, there was a healthy little crowd just enough to make it warm and inviting. The seating is comfortable and not as crammed as you might find in most restaurants in this area, it is also filled with LESS TOURISTS which is a huge bonus in my book. Marseille's food and VERY FRIENDLY SERVICE are consistently good. The menu offers a little bit for everyone but is on the limited side with tons of shellfish and (surprisingly) short ribs but not a lot of other options that don't contain either nuts or bacon, which some with food allergies might find very limiting, which is why I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars. My friend and I went there after a movie recently, happy that they have a midnight closing time. We both decided, as it was quite late, to have 2 appetisers instead of a single heavy main and were very happy with the proportions. My friend had the ""SOUPE AU PISTOU PROVENCAL VEGETABLE SOUP"" which she truly enjoyed and found just hearty enough in this weather without being overbearing. She also had the appetiser of ""RICOTTA GNOCCHI W/ BUTTERNUT & SAGE"" and said it was lovely if a little light on the gnocchi. The soup portion was large and more than adequate and the gnocchi was truly an appetizer portion which was just large enough to really hit the spot. I had the ""JARDINIERE SALAD"" with a most exquisite dressing. The salad is neither petite nor huge, both of which I was glad for as it was enough so I got a great taste of all the lovely flavors, but not so big that I felt I was chewing forever. My other appetizer was the ""HOUSE CURED SALMON"", with fennel greens and tiny melon balls of apple served underneath. The salmon was a little on the salty side and the fennel greens where a little on the oily tasteless side, though both were very fresh and I would probably order it again because I love cured salmon. Since we were splurging we decided to go for dessert as well, my friend having the ""APPLE TARTE"" and I having the ""CHOCOLATE TIMBALE.""  My friend truly liked the apple tarte but was not as ecstatic about it as I was about the wonder that was the Timbale. The Timbale consists of three nirvana like layers: the first layer is a VELVET SOFT CHOCOLATE MOUSE CASING COVERING A CENTER OF CREAMY CREME BRULE, the second layer is a RASPERRY-ROSE SORBET that sent my head swimming it was so fresh and vibrantly good, the third layer which is more of a garnish, is a sugared and fried pastry ribbon with almond overtones shaped in a little nest ball. Put all three together, with the cherry compote sauce, and you have a desert that I COULDN'T DECIDE IF I WANTED TO EAT IT OR SET UP HOUSE WITH IT. Topped off with EXCELLENT FRENCH ROAST COFFEE it was all in all a delightful meal. I will definitely be coming back again as this is one of the few restaurants in New York where I have found the food and service, not just consistent but happily excellent.",1,0,1,sara w.,"Brooklyn, NY",28,51,0
4.0,1/4/2009,"Marseille + Brunch = AwesomeMarseille + Brunch + Seeing Tyra Banks in the corner with a very sketchy looking dude when the place was empty = Awesome x 500Before I go into the Tyra sighting, I will say that Marseille has an amazing brunch selection and a great starting bread basket.  It could really be a full meal in itself.  Nevertheless, I always get one of their omlettes which completely rocks my world.  Plus they come with potatoes AND a small salad.  Yes, pleaseeeeeeee.I've been here on enough occasions that I've experienced the array of waiters they have here.  A majority of them are prompt and courteous, though I've had a few sketchy ones.  There is one that always lingers at the table a bit too long after you've ordered.  Then he disappears for a good 30 minutes.  Yeah, it's awkward.  Anyway, I had gone here with a friend one morning when it was near empty (I think they had just opened for the day).  We had been sitting there for a good 30 minutes when my friend suddenly whispers to me ""Holy shit, is that Tyra Banks behind us?""Turns out it was...and she was draped over this much-older gentleman who kept kissing her neck.  Hmm.  The best part about it were her bangs.  HOLY CRAP THEY ARE HUGE.  I'm pretty sure she hides small children in there.

I probably should have opted out of the olives in the omelette as they were pretty overpowering in taste, so I took them out. Two omelettes and a side of sausage came out to $21. How cheap! Most brunch spots price their omelettes at $13 so the $9.75 was definitely something great!Some of the waiters and waitresses acted especially ""rushed"" and were literally running around the restaurant chaotically, and our orders seem rushed.

Nice goat's cheese salad, and my boy said his calamari stuffed with short ribs (sounds bonkers hey?) was good too. Steaks were really good though they tend to overcook them a little so 'under order' yours as my medium turned out a little well done.  Despite being stuffed after two courses in the name of research I've tried a few of their puddings.

I had some warm asparagus/goat cheese(?)/truffle oil/arugula salad. It was probably the best salad I've ever had in my life. There was a soft-boiled egg (the yolk was still droopy) and I'm not sure if it was deep fried because it had a crust. It is definitely NOT to be missed.  I had the scallops crusted with pralines/cabbage, which was really delicious too (the cabbage had bitty raisins or currant, and it had a bit of a curry taste to it). We had a Rose wine (Chateau de Bellet 2007) which was impressive for a light wine, and it was has a beautiful color (very dry, and had some after flavors of rose). So I wasn't going to get dessert, but because of the impressive entree and appetizer, I decided to go for the dessert. I had the berry Crème brûlée, which was probably one of the best. The burnt part crust probably stayed under the heat a little bit longer, which gave it a thicker crust, and flavor. My partner had a grappa that our server recommended, and he loved it. I think it's going to replace the bourbon that he typically gets for dessert. i'm definitely coming back, and bringing guests.Service was excellent. There is an expert at wine who told us about all the wines. He even let us taste a bottle (that he opened), but we weren't privvy to it because it was a little sweeter.

Wrong, there is something more than that.An early morning brunch in a nice french bistro, on a Parisian environment, teeming with art deco details, and with enchanting company for hours of conversation; Marseille. Came here with a horrible hangover, which my waitress took upon herself to write-off during the course of my meal at Marseille, pouring coffee into my cup like clockwork everytime I took two sips. In the span of 20 minutes the hangover was gone. A pair of blue eyes is as effective -if not more- than Tylenol.I tried their Moroccan Bloody Mary *sans vodka* which was fantastic (albeit celery laden, not my cup of bloody); the cumin and fennel garnish gave it a sweet gist with a boost of aromatic spice, which negated the citrus somewhat but was tasty nonetheless. I upgraded to two immediately upon cosumption.We ordered goat cheese with arugula, which I'm sorry to say, was disappointing; the goat cheese rolled in nuts was overly thick and way too zesty; it intruded into your palate like a barbarian dairy horde, raping it before you could delect.I decided to go Moroccan again, and ordered the Moroccan Omelette which was good despite the fact that it contained fetta (which I loathe and forgot to tell my waitress to ixnay), the peppers and other components taking care of the overall taste.So it was a great brunch overall; we were allowed to remain and chat over more coffee for hours (a total of 3.5 hours) uninterrupted and in peace.

5.0,12/3/2007,"I went here for a pretty early lunch so can't speak to the service quality; there was about one server per party, it seemed, and we had our water refilled as often as a desert denizen could want. My food was definitely good. I ordered the potato leek soup (perhaps a little too creamy but I just told myself, ""pureed potato, it's just pureed potato"") followed by a roasted chicken salad that supposedly would have green beans and other vegetables and goat cheese balls with nuts or something. They actually brought the wrong salad, and I ended up with chicken healthy-gyro-style, as far as I could tell. The tsatsiki-ish sauce was delicious and the salad consisted of tomatoes, feta cheese, Greek olives, and tiny toasted bits of pita that were quite delicious. I don't even remember seeing this salad on the menu--plus it's a French restaurant, so I felt kind of blindsided--but that's what I got. I wouldn't have been shy to send it back, since it was not at all the dish I ordered, but I was very happy with it.You may wonder why I'm giving five stars to a restaurant that, despite being nearly empty, screwed up my order, but my sudden love for this place is due to something unexpected and probably difficult to believe: the butter. Nope, not the bread and the butter; just the butter. The bread is typical outside-of-France-French-restaurant bread, which means the crust is chewy and the inside is doughy and the thing as a whole is not that tasty. But you could have given me saltines with this stuff and I would have been over the moon. Let me explain. A thin triangle of butter (yes, the fancy European kind that probably comes from real live cows rather than the robot animals we raise in the United States) is served in a low dish that's filled with olive oil. This in itself is, of course, wonderful. But on top of the butter are fresh herbs: the usual suspects--rosemary and thyme--but also, now brace yourself, a tiny bit of lavender. You may be saying to yourself, I have lavender sachets in my underwear drawer! or My grandma uses lavender soap! or Lavender is for wusses! I'll admit that I have a thing for lavender, in drawers, the bath, and the kitchen, but the combination of all these delicious items would make even the most committed of lavender haters rethink his position. Anyway, forget the lavender. Just go have some delicious herb-oil-butter at Marseille.

3.0,4/16/2007,"I had a pretty interesting dining experience here recently after the autoshow.  I met up with some friends around 8:30 for a bite here after soaking up up some gorgeous sheet metal.  The beer and wine selection is large and interesting and the food was genuinely good.  It is not quite a bistro and the the prices are not quite as low as at a bistro, but the steak frites I had and the appetizers that were shared (including a killer braised swiss chard) were very tasty.  The interesting part came with our waiter, a middle aged guy with white hair and glasses who alternated between funny and bizzarely obstrusive throughout the meal.  When I accidentally chose a half bottle that I thought was a very reasonable chateauneuf de pape, he pointed out my mistake and showed me the full bottles.  I randomly selected a comparably priced (cheap) corbieres and asked his opinion.  ""Well you know my boy you have gone from the sublime to the ridiculous!,"" he said snatching away the menu.  He then made several other suggestions, one of which we took with good results but the net effect was that he clearly thought we were wine novices when we really were not.  From then on every dish was delivered with a funny but slightly sarcastic comment that some of us laughed at but others interpreted as condescending.  At one point I was trying to find the bathroom and had almost walked into the kitchen... He saw this and pointed me the right way saying ""Go ahead pee in the kitchen sink... I dare you!""  Now I am pretty sure it was just witty banter but that's a bit bizzare.  I would definitely go back though for the food.",2,5,2,Ted S.,"New York, NY",19,192,0
4.0,4/13/2007,"Marseille has not failed me yet. This is a slice of southern France/Algiers smack in the middle of Hell's Kitchen. The brasserie atmosphere is so authentic, you could imagine Pepe Le Pew wining, dining, and l'amour-ing some female cat in a cozy corner. Or Rick from Casablanca chowing down here after his Cafe closes.After a long day of slaying dragons at work, my friend and I eased into the meal sharing a half bottle of tasty French red wine...it was the perfect companion to the creamy hummus with toasted pita wedges starter. The waiter was in rush mode until we told him that we weren't doing the pre-theater shuffle. We then split a summery-tasting lobster salad...more wine...I really didn't have to look at the menu to know what I wanted for the main course...I craved for a mountain of fries...with a side order of their succulent steak au poivre (cooked medium rare). My date went surf-side and ordered the sole over some kind of endive salad...she was very pleased (she's European, so I guess that's a thumbs up)...more wine...bring on the dessert menu... We decided not to take the chocolate tart route for dessert and capped off this delicious meal with some mixed berries w/ a scoop of refreshing blueberry sorbet sitting on a long cookie swing.Someone posted on YELP that there weren't any good restaurants in Hell's Kitchen. What?? Marseille is just one of many.",2,2,6,Scott K.,"New York, NY",21,52,0
3.0,1/26/2007,"Decent food, nice staff, pleasant decor, very convenient for anyone in Hell's Kitchen who has a sudden craving for a decent hanger steak.  Occasionally , you'll be lucky enough find exemplary dishes (often on the specials list) but otherwise, you're not going to be crushed by anything you order here.  It's all pretty ok.  However, the hummus is fantastic! I realise this is a huge claim for a city where even a dive bar serves hummus, but it really is the best I've ever tasted.  Ever.  Without question. The creme brulee is superb too.  Sit outside, linger over a glass of wine, a book maybe ... Large wine list, though every time I go, I wonder how many of the $2500 bottles they actually manage to sell.",0,0,0,Jes S.,"New York, NY",6,16,0

4.0,10/7/2006,"I mainly sit with a couple friends at the bar or the little tables in the bar area (although I always opt for outdoor during warmer days), so I can't comment on table service, etc.... But, the following small plates will never disappoint, making this a great, more upmarket, neighborhood solution: brandade, merguez, scallops, fries, risotto.

5.0,4/7/2006,"Enjoyed dinner here twice... both walk-ins. We had to wait... but the bar was a lot of fun. The overall feeling of the place is fun and lively. After being in France, it feels very much like you are transplanted to a night in Paris. Great service, great food, excellent wine. Price was ok... nothing that dropped my jaw. Sorry for the lack of detail but I highly recommend this place.",1,0,0,Hector L.,"Redmond, WA",42,82,30
4.0,2/24/2006,"My friend and I wandered in here after a fitting in the garment district, solely on the basis that it looked nice and we were in the mood for French.  What a great surprise!  Once inside, we were struck with how beautiful the decor is.  I ordered the vegetable tagine and absolutely loved it.  It was a huge amount of delicious vegetables in a spicy tomatoe sauce with almosts and raisons, and cous-cous on the side.  I had enough left over for lunch the next day.  My friend had the duck, which was excellent.  The place only loses a star for lackluster service.",1,0,0,Debbie A.,"Mill Valley, CA",48,81,1
