4.0,4/13/2019,"Not your typical diner. Very modern and lovely inside. My coworker and I stopped in for a quick lunch one day around 1:15pm. It was packed! We were able to get one of the last tables available and seated right away. The menu is a bit pricy. $18 for a chicken sandwich and $10 or so for the vegetable soup. The chicken sandwich did not disappoint (besides for the price). It was a thick piece of white chicken and fried crispy with coleslaw on top of it. I gave half to my friend because it was too much for me. The sandwiches do come with fries so it justifies the price slightly. The service was fine, nothing great, although I understand they were very busy with the lunch crowd. I didn't exactly love this place, but I didn't dislike it. Not sure if I would return.",0,0,0,J K.,"New York, NY",4,164,95

The food was more flavorful and creative when it first opened. Versus now, it feels like the portion is a lot smaller, food is less creative and it taste mediocre.I brought my friends from Seattle here as I haven't been here for a couple of months now and I was extremely disappointed from the whole experience.

2.0,3/22/2019,"I've eaten in the restaurant before, and have always had a great experience.So, it was unfortunate that we decided that some people in our office decided to order lunch from here today, and had one of the worst ordering out experiences we've ever had.For the privilege of paying a $2.99 delivery fee, this is what we received:- 2 sad, soft, grilled cheeses, that was supposed to be on brioche, but was instead on a generic piece of bread. Not crispy or tasty in the slightest- 2 tomato soups that came with the grilled cheese, where they could barely bother to fill the container past the halfway mark- One BLT, that was also supposed to be on brioche, but was on the same sad bread, that came completely fallen apart (is sticking a toothpick in to hold it together too hard?), that was supposed to come with a side salad, but didn't. We asked for a side of tabasco, but that didn't come either.My side of hashbrowns were decent. That's all I can say. Maybe we sound like pretentious assholes. But we paid pretentious prices as a treat and got worse food than going to a regular diner. Thanks for ruining our Friday office lunch, Nickel and Dimer.

Overpriced and was not substantial at all, obviously .... and before I ordred, the waiter said the soup is large. The food is not bad but not worth the money - save your cash and go somewhere else.

The diner decor is cool, but even cooler with a bar behind the counter. We got 2 burgers and the chicken and waffles. All delicious. The Pat LaFrieda patty was HUGE and so good. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and addicting. Recommend both. Typical New York prices. However, service was not super attentive and we waited a while for our check even though we were some of the only people in there. Food was worth it, but I'm not over the top impressed.",1,0,1,Ashley O.,"Hartford, CT",266,62,100
3.0,3/10/2019,Modern day diner. Staff was nice but menu items were more attractive on the menu than on our table. Fresh fruit side (with pancakes order) doesn't mean an assortment but a handful of blueberrys or whatever they decide is the fruit of the day. The salad bowl says it comes with sweet potato but it's more of a decorative addition and no more than a teaspoon. Found the menu a bit misleading from these orders.

4.0,3/6/2019,"I came for brunch with a friend and the place was fairly packed. We opted to sit at the bar as there was a decent wait for a normal table. The bar area was almost full as well, but I didn't feel like I was on top of anyone and it was still very comfortable. I'm absolutely in love with the grain bowl! The portions are bigger than expected and the flavors blend mesh so well. Once you split the egg on top, it really brings it all together. My friend had ordered the eggs benedict, which was just okay and not really spectacular compared to other places.",0,0,0,Jensen D.,"North Dallas, Dallas, TX",232,49,98
5.0,3/6/2019,"Arrived Wednesday evening at 8PM for an 8:30 reservation. I waited at the bar where they offer me the drink menu. The restaurant wasn't too busy at this hour. When my friend finally arrived, we sat in the back in a diner style booth. I'd say it was quiet spacious and could've fit 4 people comfortably. The restaurant welcomes the late crowd as there were all sorts of people who came in throughout the evening time. They close at 11PM.Another friend joined us at the start of dinner so we had a size of 3. We were told to try the Clam Toast, which to me sounded like clams between two pieces of toasted bread. When it arrived, the saucy clams were wide open on top of... toasted bread! It was by far one of my favorites of the evening. The bread underneath soaked up the delectable sauce and tasted amazing a nice balance of savoriness. My next favorite was the Sliders. The patty was not over done and was well-flavored, with onions, American cheese, pickles, greens on top. No additional ketchup needed. We also went for the Braised Short Ribs and the potato puree was divine. The ribs were tender and the juice intact. The last item I had was the Skate Grenobloise, something totally new to me. It was tasty but I don't know if it would be my immediate choice. I did take home the leftovers short ribs and skate, which was delicious the next day.There's a cafe/morning option, as well as lunch menu available. Would have to come again to see how it compares to dinner.",1,0,1,Eunice C.,"Brooklyn, NY",184,254,132

An egg, slice of cheese, link sausage cut in half. Oh and did I add--it doesn't come with any sides.

3.0,1/22/2019,"I showed up for brunch at Nikel & Diner on a fairly slow cold Sunday with some friends. I was pleasantly surprised by how beautiful and large the space was and was excited to try their menu as I'd never been here before. I'm not sure if it was just our waiter or the fact that there wasn't a lot of people dining but our service was very poor. Our waitress kept spilling our drinks all over the table and never came back to clean it up and only asked us for drinks once.They seem to have a good selection for brunch and lunch and I was determined not to let our poor service ruin my opinion on the food. I ordered the classic Eggs Benedict that came with a side salad and unfortunately these were not good either. The eggs were practically boiled and the English muffins burnt. I would've sent them back but our waiter was never around. The drinks were good, however, I got a mimosa and white wine but overpriced for what you get and for the area.Maybe this was just an off-day for them but I wasn't very impressed and it was just okay.",1,0,1,Brittanny K.,"Brooklyn, NY",205,108,333
3.0,1/22/2019,"Super cute vibe, feels like an upscale, old fashioned diner.  Good space, easy to get a reservation for brunch on a Sunday.  It seems like they have plenty of space to accommodate. The food was ok. Two of us had the grilled cheese with tomato soup.  Both fine, nothing to write home about, a small grilled cheese on whole wheat bread with two kinds of cheeses and a very basic soup for $16 was a bit much.  I've had fancy grilled cheeses before, this was not that, it was much closer to a diner grilled cheese, but without the greasy satisfaction.  Overpriced.The service was not great.. I had accidentally misread the wine list and asked for a glass of pinot grigio.. the waitresses' response was ""we dont have that"" i was confused, i could have sworn i just read it on the menu, then my friend pointed out, ""its only by the bottle"" ok, my mistake, but she could have said so instead of acting like i made something up completely out of thin air. Then when i said Oh what white wine do you have by the glass, her response was ""its written right there"" pointing at the drink menu, which my friend was currently reading so I clearly could not see.  Just struck me as rude and unhelpful. Our drinks and food were delivered quickly but by the time we were done, she had disappeared, we had to ask the busboy for another round of drinks when he was clearing our plates.overall, cute space but the food and service could be improved.",1,1,1,Morgan G.,"New York, NY",4,16,1

Their menu doesn't specify whether their buns are brioche/dairy, so I asked in the instructions to swap out the bun for a non-dairy bun if the regular had dairy.I got a slice of brown bread. ‍Pretty sure that a restaurant charging $26 (all inc.) for a burger by delivery, can do better than this.

How do youbring an order out extremely late and not even say ""apologies for thewait"" (we waited over 15 minutes for the order to come in). No onecared to even acknowledge that a mistake was made. I reached out to them via email (info@nickelanddiner.com), yet it's been a week and no response. I'm obviously very upset about this experience.

Then for food I had the lemon ricotta pancakes. They had the option of adding seasonal fruits etc. And I'd thought that meant on top/on the side, but they baked blueberries into the pancakes. It could've had a bit more of the lemon and ricotta element considering its description but for now I'll let it fly. The side of bacon I had was good as well. They also have a small coffee bar at  the front, I believe serving Stumptown. The decor here is like an elevated, elegant diner, and I do love the name.

We ordered the lemon zest pancakes, avocado eggs Benedict and salmon Benedict. Our food came out cold, we politely asked if we could have a fresh order warmed. To us, this wasn't a big deal, it's busy and things like this happen! Brett was understanding and apologetic, always had coffee refills ready and did everything she could to get our food out. She's also doing this alone, mind you. There are other customers she has and she now has to fix a kitchen error, not fair to the other guests. The food came out again, not all at the same time, and cold. No manager ever came and spoke to us, coffee was taken off the check, but still a pretty steep bill considering the food was relatively inedible,and we had to eventually get breakfast somewhere else. In addition when coming out of the restroom the manager almost ran me over (it's busy, I totally get it) when I said ""oh sorry"" he gave me a look of disgust and kept moving.

Because it was late evening, the lighting and the overall decor made it feel more like an upscale but casual restaurant. The food and the prices are definitely more than a usual diner but they are well worth it. I had the hangar steak salad. Wow...the salad was excellent, and the steak (medium-rare) was perfectly cooked, well seasoned and just absolutely delicious. My son had the Nickel Burger and he loved it. The bathrooms are clean, spacious and well-maintained, also great decor, and the best surprise is that right by the bathrooms is a private dining room that can seat 10 people, and it is BEAUTIFUL. The food here is definitely deserving of that setting. Yet and still, my son and I felt quite comfortable casually walking in here and eating. This place would be great for a date (they have a nice bar too) but is also good for brunches and families - a rare combo.

Hostess ushered out local patrons for not having a reservation and offered bar stools as an alternative to elderly patrons that were clearly physically handicapped. The front of the restaurant, not trained properly in customer service. Excellent training in having an poor attitude versus educating/understanding of local patrons of Chinatown. Clearly, this place from the treatment of hostess is trying to cater to affluent community while emulating and exhibiting discrimination. As a local to the area, I want to support an establishment that may look out of place in a predominantly Chinese community. But was turned away as though we were not in the right socioeconomic status to be served here. This is a weekend call ahead place.

We noticed the sliders came with grilled onions and the chef agreed to add them ""as they were already somewhere on the menu"".-- Why onions and not greens too?We have never heard of a restaurant in this health conscious age that will not exchange fried potatoes for veggies.

Iced tea with just a splash of lemonade...those guests did not have to get an Arnold Palmer, or a lemonade and an ice tea separately.Someone else added chicken on the side of a dish where it was not normally served...but that was OK with the chef.How would exchanging salad or some lettuce for fries or a cup of crudités served just like the fries hurt the ego of the chef? Please change this silly regulation. Burgers can be eaten without fries without shame.",0,1,0,Wendy F.,"New York, NY",22,9,14
5.0,5/2/2018,"After a friend of mine suggested I check out Nickel and Diner, I finally went with a few friends of mine for an early dinner and I pretty quickly wondered what had taken me so long to finally make it in!VIBE: I was hesitant at first, wondering how a concept of ""diner"" meets fine dining would work out, but I was definitely impressed. The decor of the place is reminiscent of a diner, with the big comfy booths and long bar lined with stools, but the ambiance, service and food is that of a fine dining experience.DRINKS: We started with a round of drinks, a spicy margarita, the ruby soho, and at the suggestion of our waiter, Malic (more on him later), what he called gin and roses. Now, I'm not a gin kinda girl at all, but he convinced me to try it and to my great misfortune, I had to admit to him and the bartender (I think his name was Thaddeus) that I absolutely loved it. Thaddeus even came over and asked if the spicy margarita was spicy enough after we ordered another round (bonus points!)FOOD: I ordered the crab fettuccine (again at the suggestion of our waiter) and it was so unique, delicious and did not disappoint! **eye roll at another admission at a great suggestion lol**My friend, who is a vegetarian, loved the potato tasting, which for an appetizer was a generous size. The sauce was rich and delicious and the crispy things on top made for a great contrast of texture.My other friend got the burger and hardly said a word the entire meal, only making sounds of pleasure at every bite. She's a bit of a burger aficionado and it was safe to assume she was very happy with her choice!SERVICE: Malic was very friendly, hands on, and kept us laughing the whole time, without being too overbearing. He made us feel right at home and was definitely the cherry on top of our overall fantastic experience here!! If I could give this place more than 5 stars I would - can't wait to go back!",0,0,1,Nicoline S.,"Queens, Queens, NY",50,2,0
2.0,5/1/2018,"First of all this place is definitely not $$ but at least $$$: $24 chicken in Chinatown? That's an oxymoron. $25 vegetable entree? Must have some magic mushrooms in it for this price.The manager was very accommodating and mixed up two different teas for us in one pot, but when I asked him for whole wheat penne (from different dish) instead of fettuccine with our crab, we're told chef does not make substitutions (""pre-made"" makes one think?) Got Crab Fettucine and grilled-looking Cod. Fettuccine (by look and by taste) was too watery to stick to the pasta, and taste was a bit sourish-metallic and unnecessarily bitter. Honestly, I'm writing as I just swallowed my first bite and the sensation in my mouth is similar to having just chewed on aluminum foil (don't ask but I HAVE done it). When the waiter insisted that I share my opinion and I told him about the sauce being watery, the response was ""every chef makes it differently, that's why you get the spoon""Ironically, my girlfriend decided not to continue on the Cod, which I guess I chose as lesser of two evils. It was ok in my opinion. I guess we got lucky having chosen two different evils haha. I initially gave them 3 stars and was hoping to be able to add one for the food. The food obviously didn't deserve a star, but I subtracted one for the... punchlineSo here's the punchline: I went to add a 22% tip (just to round off not because I'm so generous) and paused thinking why two dishes and a tea are costing $68, then realized they added 20% service charge even though the menu said ""to parties of 6 or more.""

5.0,4/13/2018,"Love love loveeeeee this place! Nickel & Diner has been on my list for a long time and I recently found myself in the area and starving. Nickel & Diner is beautiful inside--strongly reminiscent of your classic diner, but more sleek and modern. When my friend and I got the menu, EVERYTHING sounded great. The menu is not overwhelmingly extensive, but is still packed with great options for anyone. After a good 15 minutes of deciding, I settled on the Eggplant Parm Sandwich and my friend ordered the Classic Egg Sandwich. The food took a bit of time but that's probably because it was being prepared to perfection. My sandwich was great: very fresh tasting, lots of flavors, but not too salty, greasy, or heavy like I find many eggplant parms to be. My friend was also visibly very pleased with her choice. She raced about it even after she had finished it. I decided I wanted dessert, and the waitress told me they had vanilla, chocolate, and swirl soft serve. I asked for swirl but when it came it was vanilla and charcoal, as opposed to regular chocolate. It actually tasted quite good, but I wasn't really interested in eating charcoal, so I sent it back and the waitress had no problem replacing it. She was very understanding about it. The vanilla soft serve was great. My friend ordered the hot chocolate assuming there would be the marshmallow in it that we've seen in pictures on here; however, it didn't not come with it and she said the hot chocolate was watery. Neither issue put us off from Nickel & Diner. We both agreed we would definitely be back to try some more of the amazing stuff on the menu.",0,0,1,Kira L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,13,21
2.0,4/10/2018,"The food here is INCREDIBLY overpriced. I have never felt so underwhelmed by a restaurant with such great reviews/chic ambience. My friends and I came here on a Saturday night. We had reservations ( we were a large group), but it wasn't a packed place. The food took forever to come. Maybe it's because we had a lot of people, but there wasn't very much going on outside of our table. We ordered fries for the table but they weren't very good. They tasted dry and underseasoned. McDonalds would have had better fries than that.I ordered the Salmon dish, and it was alright. Parts of it were cold, but parts of it were good. It wasn't cooked very evenly. There were well done parts of the filet, and rawer sides of the filet. The dish was small as well.BUT SPEAKING OF SMALL, EVERYONE'S DISH WAS MICROSCOPIC. THE CHESTNUT PAPARDELLE WAS LAUGHABLE. IT WAS LITERALLY LIKE 2 SCOOPS OF PASTA. For $22, that is almost immoral. It wasn't delicious enough to be worth that much. This place is also supposed to be $$, not $$$. We were APPALLED at how small the portions were. All the pasta dishes were small. Everything about the restaurant was small. The waitress's attitude was small too. You could tell that everyone was kind of shocked at how much money they had to dish for the quantity of food they got.Oh, and the REAL kicker in this story? A couple of us had to go out for SECOND DINNER after this. Thanks for the $30+ appetizer, Nickel and Diner. Won't be coming back.",8,3,2,Rebecca W.,"Los Angeles, CA",939,446,1007
3.0,4/8/2018,"Nice looking ""diner"" (sleek with a slightly retro feel due to the black & white color scheme) with booth and table seating available. Tables are spread out so there is lots of space to move around and you don't feel like you are brushing elbows with the party next to you. Waitress was attentive. This place is more upscale (re: expensive) than your local diner and it doesn't really have a lot of the traditional diner offerings... New American cuisine is a proper label. Definitely make a reservation if you plan to go.The plating of the food was nice & ""instagrammable"" but honestly was not very memorable for me. Ordered the roasted maitake mushroom. It was okay in terms of taste, but the portion seemed quite small for price paid. My friend said her kale cashew bowl was good and the portion looked decent. Matcha latte was good (not sweet).Overall, it's a ""just-okay"" spot for brunch/lunch if you want to try something different in the area. But the food didn't have any amazing ""wow"" factor to make me want to go back anytime soon.Food: 2 ""meh, I've experienced better"" but combined with the nice ambiance and attentive waitstaff, I give this place an overall score of 3.",1,0,0,Lisa C.,"Queens, NY",38,238,438

4.0,4/1/2018,"As parts of Chinatown near Canal Street have begun to change over the years, I watched with interest a couple years ago as Nickel & Diner was built and finally opened.  This beautiful venue is a literal corner diner with a beautiful modern look inspired by art deco design of the past.  Complete with a long counter space with bar seating and several booths lined up along the side, this diner looks to merge the old and the new in a convenient downtown location that is a short walk from both the Grand Street and Canal Street stations in Chinatown.In addition to the beautiful main dining section, the back area (beyond the immaculate rest rooms) is a private room that can be rented out for parties.While Nickel & Diner opened a couple years ago, every time I have tried to drop in the place was so packed the wait was estimated at over 45 minutes.  Finally I decided to make a reservation and that made the process 10x smoother.  I highly recommend setting up a reservation before you go to guarantee your seat.Here's a rundown of what my girlfriend and I tried while we were at Nickel & Diner:ROASTED MAITAKE MUSHROOMS(Poached Eggs, heirloom ratatouille, melted provolone, fine herbs garlic butter)Absolutely delicious.  Even without the two perfectly poached eggs the mushrooms, cheese and ratatouille were delicious together.  Add in the poached eggs and you have a very satisfying dish that has layers of flavor.EGG WHITE FRITTATA(Fennel sausage, spinach, wild mushroom, puff pastry, ricotta, parmesan)In contrast to the maitake mushroom dish, this frittata was wonderfully rich.  It's actually a good thing it uses egg whites because the sausage, puff pastry and cheeses really kick this into high gear on the taste buds and I feel like having regular eggs with the yolks may have been *too* rich.  This dish is delicious, but very rich.POTATO HASHThis has consists of small potatoes cooked with sliced sweet peppers and cheese.  It was sweet and savory at the same time.  The potatoes were perfectly cooked and seasoned as well.BRIOCHE FRENCH TOAST(Fresh berries, caramelized banana, maple whipped cream)This dish was simple yet perfectly done.  The brioche had not been drowned in egg wash.  It had just enough to give it the right consistency and flavor.  The maple whipped cream was nice and tasty but I will be honest, I did not notice any caramelizing on the bananas.  They seem like they had been fresh sliced and tossed onto the dish (which honestly, I have no problem with).  The toast was cooked perfectly and had a wonderful texture.I was very pleased with my first Nickel & Diner experience and I look forward to going back.",2,0,0,Benson Y.,"New York, NY",393,1300,917
1.0,4/1/2018,"I have never experienced discrimination/racism the way I did at this Diner today. If I could give 0 stars I would.I entered with my husband and step son. My husband is Hispanic but appears middle eastern due to his beard. We were given a wait time of 30 minutes. They said they would serve us by the bar for now. The bartender was clearly unhappy with this, wanted us out, so they escorted us back to the front. Giving the benefit of the doubt, I figured it was because my stepson was underaged and should not eat by the bar, we said no problem.However, they then asked if we would like to be served in the waiting area for now, I agreed, assuming they'd seat us properly in a booth when one was free. Again, giving the benefit of the doubt, I thought we were seated there due to the diner being full. However, as more customers showed up, they were seated in booths immediately, no wait time, we watched  as customer after customer got seated. One lady even had an entire booth to herself, while we were kept in the front, at a small table in the waiting area. At this point the message was clear, the staff didn't want someone that looks like my husband at their diner.God bless the waitress who noticed how poorly we were treated and was very apologetic, trying to make our experience better. As we watched the staff talk about us and refuse to seat us at their restaurant, we bit our tongues, smiled, paid for the coffee we had, tipped and left.

My table ordered the salmon lox, fries, hash, steakhouse burger, and the egg sandwich. I really enjoyed the salmon lox and fries even though I couldn't finish the fries cause I was so full. The steakhouse burger was really good too. The burger was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious. I didn't try the egg sandwich but it looked so good, and the person eating it was totally feeling it. I'm also a person that's really into drinks (non alcoholic) so I was wondering if they'd have any smoothies but I was told those are coming soon so I'm excited to come back to try those.

1.0,1/30/2018,Worst experience ever! Here for a few days with my friend. We stopped in during happy hour. The place was absolutely dead. We sat at the bar ordered a special drink on their Menu to say it was terrible would be an understatement. Prior to that we asked the bartender if the prices on the drinks were half off due to happy hour or what the deal was and she said yes! So ok we get our bill for two drinks and it comes down to 20$ and we asked how is that half? she replied they were 16$ each before the discount. Now let's due the math here... the biggest disappointment yet was the lack of customer service to a whole other level. There were 5 visible servers on sight and a manager at the door and somehow we waited 20 minutes to get one drink. And this being our second choice Bc I couldn't get my gin in tonic the bartender couldn't find a bottle opener for the tonic. Never again will I walk in this venue or recommend it to anyone!

They have a nice breakfast & brunch menu and also offer cocktails.I decided to order all the sides. I ordered 2 eggs scrambled, an avocado and the potato hash. The potato hash was prepared with peppers and had a spicy kick to it. Definitely a welcome choice to combat the cold outside. The avocado was fresh and thinly sliced. The eggs were cooked just right, yellow all around but still had a soft texture about them which I really loved. My waitress Melissa was friendly and welcoming. Definitely has my recommendation as a great server. I also ordered 2 rounds of Cappuccino, both of which I slowly sipped in between my breakfast.",7,2,6,Eric A.,"Brooklyn, NY",505,274,1594
3.0,1/16/2018,"I came here for my friend's birthday brunch with a group of girlfriends on a cold Sunday afternoon. The overall aesthetics of the restaurant is clean and neat and perfect for pictures. When our whole party arrived, we were seated in the back area. First things first, some drinks we ordered were a regular latte, two matcha lattes, and one chai latte. I felt that it lacked the rich tea flavor in all the drinks but the regular latte wasn't bad. Nothing spectacular though.For entrees, we got Eggs Benedict ($17), Eggs Florentine ($16), Kale Cashew Bowl ($17), and Grilled BLT ($16). Our side dish was potato hash. My two friends that had gotten the Classic Egg Sandwich ($12) said it was way too salty. The Eggs Florentine which I got was pretty good - the muffin was nice and crispy. The birthday girl got a Kale Cashew Bowl and was happy with her choice. However, at the end of our meal, we had asked our waitress to help us take a group photo but she rushed it and did not seem to care. She did not even ask if everything was alright throughout the course of the brunch. In all, I felt that it was mediocre and was not entirely impressed as I thought I would be based on past reviews I saw.

3.0,1/15/2018,"It was a really cold Sunday in the city catching up on appointments and at 1:00 pm it's time for lunch.  Not too far from where we parked we decided on this place.   Walked in at 1pm and asked the host a table for 3.  He asked if we had reservations.  We three looked at each other and confused..  hah.  In my head I was saying ""Isn't this a diner""?.  Anyway, I said no. So we put our name for 1:30 and given our number to call when a table was ready.  Waited 20 mins and called back and immediately got seated with water and menus. Here's wat we ordered:We ordered 3 sides for our little one having to be a bit picky:Shoelace fries- lightly topped with parmesan cheese made no difference.  It was to me no special fries and kept my 9 year old eligthed but $6 for just a handful of fries, I expect some special fries.  Not too mention they were cold. 2 scramble eggs- For some reason it looked a bit too yellow to me.  I didn't try these but my little one said she couldn't finish it all as the more she ate them it tasted kinda weird.  Hubby had a tried and said was ok.Side bacon- who doesn't like bacon?  Was crispy like good bacon.  Egg white Frittia- very good.  I thought it might be a bit heavy with cheese but surprisingly light with the perfect amount of taste equally amount of sausage and veggies.  BLT- mmm...  so good. 3 layers of goodness made up one great empire having the salad on the side. The bacon is aromaticly smoky and crispy. The salad I found it overly dressed with olive oil but hubby had no complaint.  Overall, we like our food and service was only medricro.  And a diner having to ask about having a reservation is definitely not our style or very unexpected. $65 for brunch style food I would expect more from both the quality of food and their service.  Granted that I love my egg white frittia and despite the other flaws,  I would go back for their other dishes.",0,0,0,Jenny G.,"Brooklyn, NY",68,354,2147
1.0,1/10/2018,"I really wanted to give this place a 1 star review but Alexandria saved the day. So I really really needed to use the bathroom and I offered to buy anything in order to use the bathroom, as I know that you have to be a customer in order to use the bathroom. I turned to a gentlemen at the counter and offered to buy anything but he looked up and down at me and declined. It was an emergency so I begged and pleaded to buy anything but he just kept saying restroom is for customers only ,while I kept saying, is there anything I could buy. Finally the employee names Alexandria offered me a cup of coffeeq I can purchase just so I can you use the bathroom. The name of the gentleman that did not allow me to use the rest room is Fabian. He's has no sympathy for others nor does he know how to treat his employees. I literally asked to purchase something and he just kept turning me down and looking at his computer. I do not understand how is he a manager and all he is doing is sitting at the counter staring at his laptop. To the owners of this establishment, I am a business owner myself, he clearly does not care about your business. I'm sure if you guys watch the replays all you will see is him on his computer, update, I want to say that this place is actually worst then I thought. I called at 9:40 pm to ask if they were open... I got there at 9:50 and the manager says to me, sorry last called was when I called, and he said I called at 9:30 which was false. He could have at least told me over the phone is was going to be last call. Instead I got there with my girlfriend to be turned down. Funny thing it was the same shit manager.

I like the idea of the coffee bar in the front of the restaurant.Had the shoestring fries with Parmesan, brioche French toast, and eggs Benedict. Food was high quality and what you would expect. Knocked off one star for the service being notably bad. Our server was a young woman who didn't even greet us, but abruptly asked us to hand her the water glasses so she could fill them. She visited the table exactly 5 times: to fill our water glasses, take the order, ask us if we were done yet, brought us our check, and brought us the change. She was extremely rude and seemed bothered by us from the getgo.

3.0,1/3/2018,"We were thankful to find this place in a pinch.  My sister had selected a place and it turned out it was not a sit down restaurant and we had 10 in our party.  Did a quick search on Yelp to find something near by and came up with this option.  They were nice enough to accommodate us without a reservation since we were there a little ahead of the lunch rush.  But they tried to put 10 of us on a table that really only held 8 comfortably.  So that was kind of an issue and they would not let us add to make the table bigger.  They claimed they had pending reservations. We made it work.. Our server was very nice. And my sister has a small service dog, and the server got us a high chair for the dog... Cute dinner atmosphere.  I got the pasta but did not care for it because it had a strong roasted pepper taste.  I don't care for bell peppers of any kind in anything.  My hubby switched with me and he liked the pasta.  The serving could have been larger and I should have been offered some Parmesan... it needed Parmesan.  My hubby got the burger and fries.  That was outstanding!  Fries were perfect and seasoned perfectly.  Burger was huge and very flavorful!  I could only eat half so my hubby ate the other half.  Several in our group got the egg sandwich and they all raved about how good it was.  My niece got the power bowl and it looked healthy and delicious and she reported that she liked it.  My brother in law got the pancakes and they were just ok.  Nothing remarkable.  No special topping.  The restaurant was not full when we left... but I'm sure it was the time of the day.",0,0,0,Malia K.,"Honolulu, HI",289,126,49

I ordered the mushroom with poached eggs and the mushrooms were flavorless. It was under seasoned but there was no soul, empty. The pancakes were almond ones and they were different enough that my husband liked them, but for the price, there are much better options within a few blocks where there is a line 7 days a week.

2.0,11/4/2017,"Overpriced with disappointing food. Went here for brunch and ordered the ranchero omelet and burger. This was the worst omelet I've had in years. Bad enough that I feel compelled to write a review.  The eggs were rubbery and came in a thick, sheet-like shape. The eggs looked and tasted like they were poured out of a carton and into a mold, like the egg patty you get inside a McMuffin or from the food court at LaGuardia. The sad dollop of ""ranchero"" sauce atop the eggs tasted like a few chunks of tomato drenched in vinegar. And after cutting into the omelet, the eggs sat in a pool of water. The burger was $17, plus $2 for cheese. There are a lot of $19 burgers around the city. Except they are usually served at higher-end restaurants and are usually exceptional. This burger was mediocre, at best. The meat was overcooked and of middling quality. The bun tasted store-bought.",2,0,0,David L.,"New York, NY",8,13,0

The environment is an upscale modern diner design with neat touches that was warm and inviting. I've been meaning to try this place for so long because I LOVE Chikarashi and eat there more often than I'd like to admit sometimes. The chef truly cares about his food quality and flavor, which is very important to me. My friends and I met up for dinner and this is what we tried:-Wild Mushroom and Lobster Risotto: perfect texture and great lobster and mushroom flavor-Grilled Spanish Octopus: so tender and chewy in a good way (not tough at all), it felt like they massaged the octopus for hours -Roasted Chicken: very flavorful, but could've been a little more moist-Crispy Duck Duo: they weren't kidding about the crispiness, I don't always love duck, but this was really really good.-Black Truffle Burger: uh, this had real black truffle shavings on it...YES, IT DID. I was shocked because so many places use truffle oil like they their lives depended on it or some sort of imitation stuff. The fries were also crunchy and seasoned well.-Charcoal & Vanilla Softserve: You don't taste much of the charcoal flavor, but I had the impression it could cleanse my body of all the food I ate (hopefully), but beware that it will tint your lips a little black!

After greetings by the hostess, you will see a lot of 2 x 2 table booths that you normally see in diners. It wasn't crowded when I went with my boyfriend, no wait, around 2pm (pretty late for brunch typically). We were seated all the way in the back (far into the restaurant) for 2 people groups.

It is what it is. 2 eggs with bacons and ham and some pesto on a kaiser roll.My boyfriend got the Marinated Hanger Steak and eggs ($25). Although it was on the expensive side because it's steak, he enjoyed it very much. The steak was cooked well to his liking - medium rare. It was a filling meal. We also ordered a Bloody Mariko ($14).

5.0,8/23/2017,"Heard this place got its liquor license so that's a 5 star development!  Fries are light and crispy.  Grilled octopus is a standout.  Not chewy, lightly charred flavoring from the grill, and just the right amount of salt (I prefer my foods on the saltier side).  The dry aged strip may sound expensive at $38, but it is actually a bargain for the product you get and when you compare to steakhouses.  Absolutely no need for condiments.  You even get to suck on the marrow as it's part of the plate.  I imagine it's a good source of calcium.",0,0,0,Buck C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,23,0

It does not exude comfort as a the name dinner would suggest, it is much more polished.  For food, I had the ranchero omelette which a bit odd.  I would have expected the dish to have a little heat to it.  However, it was acidic which was unnecessary since the side greens had acid to it, and it was sweet which was just very odd for this dish.  The sour cream was nice, but it was not integrated into the omelette, but on the side.  Overall, the dish was a little disappointing.The experience is nice but I will have to return to try some more dishes before I can make a full assessment.",0,0,0,K.

3.0,7/17/2017,"I LOVE a good diner so I've been dying to check this place out since they replaced the sketchy $5 for 3 item Chinese place that had been there for years. I was really encouraged when I walked in and saw the sleek, minimal interior that still had the friendly feel of a diner. I've heard a lot of great things about the breakfast sandwich and I wish I had stuck with that because unfortunately I wasn't happy with my meal for the most part. I was excited to splurge on a burger which came with their shoestring fries. Though I asked for the burger medium rare, it came out medium-well to well done, which just makes me sad - such a waste of good meat. The poppyseed bun was a bit hard, and the fries didn't taste fresh at all. My date got the Benedict with some potato hash on the side, which they forgot, but the server felt really bad about it and took it off our check, so all was forgiven. The hash itself wasn't very tasty either, though. Though it came in a piping hot cast iron dish and was piled high with fixins it was still lacking flavor.We also got excited to share the milkshake of the day, which was mango. Sounds really fun and interesting, right? But what I tasted was just a vanilla shake with some orange wisps on the bottom which I kept trying to stir to get more mango flavor but I honestly don't think they added to it at all. And though I should have known better, I got coffee because diner coffee is one of my favorite things, but like many organic/fancy coffees I found this one much too sour. Totally a personal preference thing, but be warned that you're not going to get your traditional diner coffee here. All of this being said, I really am willing to give Nickel and Diner another shot because there were so many things on the menu that sounded tasty and they could have just been having an off day. The service was friendly, ambiance stylish and cool, and it's a great location if you find yourself in Chinatown/Little Italy and want a non-Chinese or touristy Italian bite.",6,4,4,Christina P.,"Culver City, CA",4723,2090,4060
4.0,7/15/2017,"Nice diner. Very clean. Minimalist and modern. The food is great but missing diner breakfast staples like egg, bacon, home-fries combo. Here you have to order all of that separate. A side of egg, a side of bacon and a side of hash browns. There are omelette combos, eggs Benedict etc. It looks like while trying to be a cutting edge diner near Chinatown and Little Italy the menu lacks the essentials. We can allow the twist on essentials like here your hash browns come in a little pot with melted cheese and a bit spicy  and taste delicious.

The service is also impeccable - the waiters, waitresses and hostesses are all so sweet! The location is also ideal, as it's at the intersection of Little Italy, Chinatown, and SoHo.

There's plenty of seating and the arrangement is nice and spacious so you really do get that diner feel.The service is friendly and for a Sunday at noon, the place was far from packed, though maybe it was because it's July 4th weekend. Nevertheless, this place is definitely on the up-and-up, conveniently a few blocks away from the Canal Street stop, so I'm sure it'll start to fill up as time goes by and its reputation builds.I got the iced chai latte and the classic egg sandwich, which I HAVE to rave about. The two fried eggs were runny and even though the yolk got everywhere, I really can't complain because the flavors were fantastic. Nice, crispy bacon coupled with some savory ham and cheddar and a basil vinaigrette (which added a nice little kick to the sandwich) on top of a poppy seed kaiser roll - what a genius and fantastic combination. I was so full after that sandwich and for $10, it's really not bad at all.My friend got the kale cashew bowl, and YES for warm grain and vegetable bowls.

I had a weird mashed potato and broccoli purée side that was basically baby food. That was my ""dinner"". Food looked great but wasn't anything special.

This place was brand new, with only just over 100 reviews and I was excited to give the new neighborhood spot a try. The wait wasn't too long, but my friend had hoped to get a booth seat - they were large and we were only 2 people so I can see why they placed us at the bar. We were seated after a 15 minute wait (we went to the post office down the block so he could mail a letter, and came back and waited some more). Service was slow, but the wait staff seemed really busy and stressed. We ordered, him an eggs benny with the hot chocolate special of the day and myself a brunch BLT with side salad. I really liked my open face sandwich! The cheese was super melty and dripping down the sides, and their choice of green steak tomato was quite interesting. The dish itself wasn't too aesthetically pleasing but the flavors were all there - BLTs are probably my favorite sandwich of all time, and this was not a disappointment. My friend's hot chocolate was actually REALLY good, the huge chocolate marshmallow block floating in his drink was, as we found out, handmade and set in stores, and made specifically for that drink. I'd go back for that hot chocolate, it was so good!! Friend liked his eggs benedict, didn't say if it was particularly good or bad (he's in the nation of food eaters who call food ""good"" or ""bad,"" no descriptors).

The food is okay. Nothing mind blowing. My friend and I shared the egg sandwich and great steakhouse burger. The egg sandwich is something you can make yourself at home without much more effort. Just get a kaiser roll, fry an egg and make some ham and bacon. The burger was fine, not particularly flavorful. My friend said he liked the texture and beefy taste but wasn't a fan of the roll. The feedback below is based on lacking service in both my experiences. We were seated in the back again, same seats. I don't understand the purpose of the translucent glass. Be warned that if you get seated in the back, service may be lacking or extremely slow. It's one thing to not be pushy and let your customers easy at their own pace. It's another to have customers trying to get someone's attention (several times) and no one notices. This includes the bus boy, two maitre d's, and waitress. I didn't know the bus boy was just a bus boy. Even when I got his attention, he proceeded to look around for more dishes before getting the waitress...I asked the waitress how I'd be able to get her attention going forward and she said she'll walk back there to check more often. Didn't really happen considering the repeat of my experience happened shortly with the customers seated next to us after. It may be busy, but it's not a holiday. I think that as a business, you can tell if you need to hire more. After charging $10 for a not so special egg sandwich and $18 ($16+2 for white cheddar cheese), I have higher expectations.

When our dishes came, we were honestly almost shocked to see the plates- super small portions and did not look appetizing at all. Pancakes were two flat pieces with a side of syrup and omelette was insanely tiny with a few embarrassing peices of greens. We finished our meals on ten minutes (they were that tiny), and nothing great flavor wise. The pancakes were flat and not fluffy, and I could have a made a better omelette at home for 1/8th of the price. Service was alright, we sat at the bar but our water had to be changed twice because there was stuff floating in it.

3.0,4/5/2017,"I rarely give out less than 4 or 5 stars for a place that doles out great food. Why? Because I know service is subjective (used to be in the industry, now in retail). TLDR: Waiter forgot my order, didn't want to talk to me directly (used the kitchen staff), and then didn't tell us about the automatic 18% gratuity. Oh and didn't apologize or comp anything for forgetting my order. I sat there awkwardly for nearly 15 minutes while my friends ate.But I've been here a few times and had the same wait staff and just can't handle the inconsistency.1: Today they forgot to put in my order. The four others got their orders and I just sat there, the kitchen staff who brought the food looked at me funny, then after 5 minutes I make awkward eye contact with my waiter -- he then hurries to the kitchen and sits in the window saying stuff.2: After TEN (10) (TEN) minutes, I look again and he goes ""it's on the way."" No apologies, smiles or anything. Like this is my fault to inconvenience him?3: Food shows up sans side order of bacon (I'm fat, I know)...and I'm trying to tell the kitchen guy (again, waiter doesn't bring me my food like he did for everyone else?...ok) and the guy doesn't understand what I'm saying (no big, NYC is diverse that's what I love about NYC) and he tries taking back EVERYTHING. I grab the plate and wait another minute before the bacon roles out.No apologies, that's fine...but here's the kicker.We had a group of five, no rush table, and they grouped in gratuity into the bill and didn't say anything nor did we see that warning on the menu.I'm OK with this normally, but the fact they didn't apologize for me getting my food 15 minutes after everyone else, didn't comp anything (not even my coffee?), and then didn't tell us they included 18%...cool story, Hansel.Oh also, they still don't have their liquor license.",0,1,1,Matt F.,"Portland, OR",631,42,2
5.0,3/31/2017,"Booth seating is so quintessential diner, loved that. FYI Nickel & Diner is non-traditional diner fare. Liquor license pending.Started with the foie gras terrine. Although plated beautiful and tasted fantastic, the foie was served on a hot plate which literally melted the terrine and became soupy.The crispy skin duck was very nice. Cooked medium rare, the meat was tender and succulent inside while the skin was salty and crispy. If available get the slow roasted acorn squash! The show roasting brought out the natural sweetness of the squash. A bite of the squash, sliced almonds, Swiss chard together...party in your mouth. (Seasonal dish)If you're looking for something hearty, the Berkshire pork chop is great. They recommend medium rare but we decided on medium which was a better idea...the center was only slightly pink and still very juicy. The meat has a smoky flavor, very delicious.

5.0,3/27/2017,"Nickel & Diner is a cute little 1950s style diner nestled on a quiet corner on the Chinatown/SoHo border. Breakfast and brunch is what they excel at here. The classic egg sandwich ($9) is a fancier take on the bacon, egg and cheese on a roll. The roll is a deliciously fluffy poppy seed Kaiser roll, the bacon is delightfully crispy and gets some reinforcement from slices of country ham, and in addition to a couple of really well-fried eggs (runny yolk, crispy edges) and melted cheese, there is an amazing basil vinaigrette that elevates the dish. The sandwich by itself is great but I think adding half an avocado makes it extra special. The bf got a shaved vegetable salad ($13) which is a great choice for vegans/vegetarians. Everything in this salad is crispy and well seasoned (helped especially by a delicious sunflower pesto). The portion size for the salad is huge so even though you're just eating vegetables, you will still get quite full.",1,1,1,Honghui Y.,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",84,190,84

Nice laid back vibe, and the people working there all seemed friendly and helpful. The only abject negative is their availability of high chairs - we were four adults plus a toddler and needed a high chair. They seemed to only have one high chair for the entire diner, and this was being used so there was a long wait, loitering in the entrance waiting for the high chair to become available. There may also have been some murmurings of the high chair only being an option at the tables in the back in order to avoid fire hazards; i think there are probably some staggeringly simple solutions to that particular problem but the place is still in its infancy so maybe they'll figure it out...or maybe it's an intentional policy to prevent the place from turning into a crèche. Hard to say.The food - we had the egg sandwich, ranchero omelette, scrambled eggs and potato hash.  It was perfectly ok but a little underwhelming. It just seems like standard diner fare but smaller portions. One exception - the scrambled eggs were superb! Some of the best scrambled eggs i've had since the Caravan back in London.

5.0,2/7/2017,"Nickel & Diner is a treat in Chinatown. The decor is modern; from the tiles colors to the font on the menu.

We received great and attentive service, even with some of us arriving 30 minutes late.I had the Salmon Lox ($15) which was served on a pumpernickel everything bagel, cucumber, avocado, spinach and a side of hollandaise.

5.0,1/30/2017,"First impression: what is this American diner doing in the middle of Chinatown? I believe the space used to house a popular Chinese restaurant for affordable eats. That being said, it's been completely transformed into a modern-ish ""diner"" (or rather a nice room with diner-style bar stools) with shining white tiles and light flooding through its giant windows. The vibe is perfect for brunch that's casual yet elegant. The menu is perfect for the same.Salmon Lox: one of my favorites, a filling and healthy dish with an awesome combo of spinach, cucumbers, avocado, and lox on an impressively good pumpernickel everything bagel (2 of my favorite bagels in 1!). It's near impossible to eat as a sandwich - eating it open-faced is the way to go. Roasted Maitake Mushrooms: the healthiest dish we ordered, mostly vegetables. The ratatouille has a nice zing, and maitake mushrooms are my favorite. Some grains or bread to soak up the sauce/egg yolk would've been a nice addition. Yummy but not very filling. Eggs Florentine: pretty standard, well executed with a fresh non-goopy hollandaise. Buttermilk Pancakes: larger than your face and really delicious. Bits of macadamia and hints of orange throughout perfectly-fluffy-yet-densely-satisfying pancakes, and a trio of toppings including one very cinnamony apple compote.Potato Hash: interestingly mixed with roasted red peppers and some gooey cheese, a decent carb side (would be perfect with the mushrooms!). I may go for fries next time.Sharing is highly recommended, so you can order a bit of everything for a well-rounded meal. I had my eye on the breakfast sandwich and burger, which seemed popular. Service was fine, and what I really appreciated was the faint jazzy background music and moderately quiet noise level.

1.0,1/22/2017,"Came here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. Wait time was about 20 minutes, though I'm not sure why cause when we were seated, there were plenty of open spots.. at least 8! Some open seats had dirty plates from the previous customer so it was obvious that they didn't clear those seats for waiting customers. Anyway, we were seated at the bar and first thing I noticed was how slow and unattentive the staff/waiters/waitresses were. It took about 20 min for us to order. I also noticed a bus boy who was standing there shinning the cups. I guess it's nice to get paid to do that.. lol I just couldn't help but notice how almost useless some of the staff were. Anyway onto the food, there's not much to select from the menu. It's pretty limited and it seems like everyone ordered the same thing cause there really isn't much to order. We got the burger, asked for medium rare. It came out super well done. Also ordered the most typical dishes (it appears), Brussels sprouts and chicken. Everything was very below mediocre. We ate just to eat and quickly got out. The only thing attractive about this place is the transformation from an old Rundown Chinatown buffet to a modern trendy lower east side meets Chinatown joint.

4.0,1/17/2017,"I love the drastic contrast between the Chinese exterior and the modern, Western diner interior. Nickle & Diner certainly knows how to decorate. However, to be honest, the large booths (though comfortable) seem a little bit of a waste of space. Meaning, it has the potential to seat  six people but more often it seats 3-4 people. If they were smaller they could fit more parties. Anyways, the food--the thing that matters most. My friends ordered the hot chocolate with the chocolate marshmallow. I tried a sip. It was so good! Not too sweet, not too bland. Only con: a little pricey (but what do you expect, it's NYC). We ordered the burger, the BLT, and the eggplant parmesan. Personally, I thought the eggplant parmesan was a little underwhelming. It would've been nice if it had a side that filled up more the dish or something that made it seem more worth it for what we were paying. BLT was pretty good, according to my friend. She particularly loved the truffle dressing on the salad. I ordered the burger, and I think I made the best choice. It was filling and rich with flavor. I loved the poppy seed bun!! We ordered the rosemary fries to share, which was a good portion, enough for 4 or more people. However, while there was a slight noticeable difference, it tasted rather similar to the regular fries that accompanied the burger dish. Everything was so filling. I came here a second time for the breakfast food. GET THE POTATO HASH. It's worth it. We got the eggs florentine and the egg sandwich. Both good, full of flavor and texture. I really loved how they balanced the flavors. Only complaint about the egg sandwich: the egg. It was neither poached nor boiled fully. It was rather confusing, maybe we were just unlucky with overcooked/undercooked egg.So overall, in terms of what to order, my favorites were the potato hash and the burger. There is a separate cafe at the entrance. So if you're only interested in drinks, there's that option.",3,1,1,Jung Joo K.,"Great Neck, NY",512,105,263
4.0,1/17/2017,"For now this place is BYO, and paired with the excellent food, this is a recent favorite spot of mine.The only thing this place has to do with a diner is the modern, fresh interior which looks like the diner of the future. It really looks sharp. The food is nothing like diner-fare fortunately. I have ordered the pork chops and half chicken and both were superb. Well cooked, oozing with rich flavor and the fries, you must order the fries, there are a lot of them and they are sublime. My gf has ordered the beet salad twice now and greatly enjoyed it both times. A couple weeks ago, I organized a dinner of 7 people, planning to take advantage of the BYO policy while it was still in effect. Most restaurants would see seven 20 year olds with 4 bottles of wine and show a level of disapproval, but the staff here were very accomodating and did not make us feel like the hooligans we were for stretching the meaning of BYO. Our waiter the first time was perfectly polite and well-trained. The second was nice and chatted us up a bit but I could tell that he was new to the job and attempting, in a slightly infuriating fashion, to persuade us to order appetizers to share (as recent college graduates, we were not looking to break the bank). He went thru the menu, item by item, mentioning which were his favorites and it took him a few minutes. Hopefully he has excised this from his routine by now.

5.0,1/17/2017,"We were just in town for some college stuff and found this place one morning. When we found it we were a little bit skeptical of it because we just wanted some regular old American Breakfast food and it's in a predominantly Chinese area. When we got in, all our concerns were dispelled. This place has a really great atmosphere. It's sort of like a cross between an old 1950s diner and what I'd imagine a diner will look like in 2050. Very cool looking place. I had the eggs Benedict and my mom had the buttermilk pancakes both were amazing (but the Benedict was better). We also each had a cup of coffee which was great. I ordered a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice. A bit pricey but it's worth it for the fresh ingredients and friendly wait staff. We liked it so much we even came back a second time (tried the eggs Florentine. Also fantastic). My only disappointment was the cinnamon roll we had at the end. It wasn't bad, just not what I had expected from a place like this. Sorta dry. I'd highly recommend using some warm sauce on them or something.

3.0,1/16/2017,"We came by today with my parents for lunch. We were seated right away in the back. The experience went went downhill from there. Since it was past 11, we were told no breakfast item will be served even though I really wanted to try the egg sandwich. Usually if you call yourself a diner, the menu is all day and I can't imagine how hard it would be to serve something on the breakfast menu. Also, we were told there is no kid menu and also they won't be able to serve the burgers in halves so we can share. The waitress had an attitude while taking our order and didn't offer to refill our water during the whole meal. The food was definitely above average, I enjoyed the fried chicken appetizer, the burger and the pasta dish. When we were checking out, I noticed our waitress added 20% service fee to our bill for 4 adults and a toddler. Usually I would be fine if the service is good, but I thought this time she got a bit presumptuous and also 20% for lunch is steep as an automatic service fee.

We ended up ordering two egg sandwiches and fries to share, as sides are separate orders (which bumps the price tag up a little). Our server got our order wrong and only brought us one egg sandwich and fries to share. We didn't really notice until 20 minutes longer of waiting and then asked her and she seemed quite peeved. The food, itself, was VERY salty. I was downing cups of water. The fries were extremely salty and the egg sandwich, which had a very tasty bun, was nothing I couldn't make at home and doused in salt. Upon leaving we asked to split the check, at which point our server rolled her eyes and said she had too much going on to split the check. We said it was no problem and we would venmo each other, already quite put off.

I've experienced better.This place has been sitting here for a while, but only recently did they start doing dinner, which I went for.Arrived at 8:30 PM and tried to get a booth, but was unsuccessful as they told us we needed to reserve them. As the night went on, the place got pretty crowded, despite it being a Wednesday.My friend ordered the carrots and potato and celery puree, with an appetizer of fried chicken, which was laughably small. I got the fries with the pork chop. The portions here were quite small, and quite the pork chop was cooked just fine, they threw some sort of spice/flavor on the pork chop that was very distinct, and kind of ruined the whole flavor. Fries were fine, but it's not too difficult to mess that up.This is a pretty clean establishment and a welcome addition to the greater Chinatown area, but the thing is this place isn't really a ""Diner"" at all as far as dinner goes (which is kind of misleading). It has the words diner, but the dinner menu suggests that this is more of a typical contemporary American restaurant. Don't expect to get patty melts, milkshakes, or any of that kind of typical 'Diner' food.While overpriced, I do understand that making the rent at this location must be tough.

4.0,12/10/2016,"Oddly situated within the bounds of Chinatown, but I loved the feel as I walked in - a sleek, clean, modern day diner that's spacious enough to comfortably fit the long counter running the length of the space and banquettes lining the perimeter.The weekend brunch menu is divided into salads, eggs, and sandwiches, with most options falling within the great price range of $10-15. I went for the classic egg sandwich - hickory smoked bacon, sharp cheddar, fried eggs, ham - per recommendation by my server and added on a side of fries to make it extra healthy. The sandwich turned out to be good but ok - tasty, filling, but not quite to the point where your mind consciously registers ""hey pay attention, this is good stuff"". The kaiser roll was too soft to support the weight of the sandwich, especially when it became soggy from the spread and egg yolk; I wouldn't have noticed the supposedly sharp cheddar if it weren't visibly melted onto the bacon; the bacon tasted like normal bacon to me - didn't hint at much hickory smoked flavor.The thin fries came with a liberal sprinkle of parmesan and herbs on top, but personally speaking, I would've loved if the cheesiness/herbiness were on all the fries, not just the top ones!Can't fight the price point though - I paid $15 for the entire meal and even though it wasn't fully satisfying, I still came out of it feeling like I'd just gotten an awesome deal.So - 3.5 stars on food, but service, vibe, and price push it up to 4.",4,0,0,Millie S.,"Manhattan, NY",384,284,415

The burger topped with cheese and fried onion was cooked perfectly and topped with a delicious aioli. The BLT was too messy in my opinion and fell apart on the plate.

1.0,12/6/2016,"New diner on the borderline of Little Italy, Soho and Chinatown, right on the corner of Howard and Centre. My friend had told me about this new diner that had recently opened. Perhaps our expectations were high but My friend and I left very disappointed. You walk into the entrance on Centre St., the host will be on your right and in front of you, you will notice a nice coffee station serving up Nobletree coffee from Redhook Brooklyn. Five and dime counters with fixed diner bar stools. Large, bright windows with spacious and comfy booths. The host offered us a nice spacious booth. The server was repressive and did not seem into the job even though it was not that busy. The server took our order then left the table. When the food came, the server asked if we needed anything and we declined. After digging into my meal, the server did not come by to check on us. Not that I needed supervision but I was ready to speak up if he would come and check on the table. The food was sadly disappointing. Less than mediocre. I was honestly not planning to touch the food and see if the server would stop by and check our satisfaction. The other staff members even hawked over my table many times because they have noticed that i was not touching the food anymoreIt is a huge red flag if your customers order only a few items and not even finishing one fourth of each dish. But nope, no questions, concerns or interactions. Distastefully, did not even bother to give desserts a try. Table was just cleared, check was paid and on my way to out to quickly find another place to grab a fast lunch at before work. The burger was super dry and bland. I had asked for the burger to be medium rare and the burger came medium well, was there a miscommunication there? did the server ask for the wrong temperature or the chef not know how to make a burger medium rare? The brussel sprouts and shishito peppers had a weird herbaceous taste. Not sure how I feel about these two items mixed together. The cavatelli could use some salt, actually a lot of salt but unfortunately that did not save it either, just super bland. I was excited for their shoestring fries, nothing about it tasted exciting, not think enough either. Even the coffee was too acidic.

4.0,12/4/2016,"Growing up in the tri-state area, I frequented Chinatown weekly as a child as my grandparents spent most of their time there.  As long as I can remember, this spot used to be a Chinese fast casual quick service spot.  Then one day, Nickel & Diner took over.  It's sad that old school spot are disappearing, but at the same time, this area gets another taste of American food.  My party of two came in for Sunday brunch at 2pm.  There were plenty of seats, and reservations were not even needed.  Just as you enter, there is a coffee bar area to grab a coffee to-go or sit down to chat or do a little work.  Then, you enter the dining area where we were seated.  We ordered the Classic Egg Sandwich ($8) and Salmon Lox Bagel ($14).  The Classic Egg Sandwich delivered!  The Sandwich may seem small, but the taste and the heaviness of the dish fill you up.  The Bagel was also good, but very difficult to eat.  It is nicely presented on an open faced bagel, but all the ingredients fall off once you take your first bite.  This dish needs to be better constructed!  Definitely not a date food as you'll be caught trying to catch your falling sandwich.  All in all, the food was good, but nothing mind blowing.  It is a solid brunch meal that doesn't break the bank.  But then again, you can just go to your corner deli and pick up the egg sandwich or lox bagel!",2,0,1,Jennifer L.,"Manhattan, NY",192,385,517

I also got the hot chocolate with the chocolate marshmallow. I wouldn't recommend this simply because it was a little cold and the marshmallow wouldn't melt.

3.0,11/29/2016,"Decent.  Not great.  The decor is modern, actually a bit too modern.  It would have been nice if they peppered in some classic diner design.  Also the music playlist leaves much to be desired.  I am not trying to listen to some bumping hip hop at 11 am eating breakfast and drinking my coffee.  The identity of this place is confusing to me.  It seems like they are trying to go for a super sleek European modern feel with a clubby vibe, in the heart of Chinatown...On to the menu.  I have never been to a diner with a single page menu.  Every diner I have been to has had an overstuffed menu chock full of laminated pages with pictures of food photographed in the 80s.  Case in point, I would have appreciated a few more options and a little more variety.  The food was decent.  My steakhouse burger was juicy and flavorful and the fries were very crunchy, so no complaints there.  The potato hash wasn't great, once you got past the crunchy top layer with cheese, it was a sad mosh pit of soggy potatoes with no seasoning.  My girlfriend's egg sandwich was big but lacking a lot of flavor.  I can't comment on my friend's salads because I don't have any interest in salads. The most interesting part of this brunch was seeing the sweet Chinatown local ladies peer into the windows to see what was going on, most likely wondering what happened to the $5 buffet that preceded this restaurant.  Another sad reminder of increasing gentrification...going from $5 buffet to $17 burgers...For whatever reason, the stools that wrap the bar area are on a raised platform.  There were a couple of instances where a few patrons tripped over the raised corner of the platform.  Luckily no one fell or got hurt.  Definitely a poor design choice.  The service was the highlight of the experience.  Our waters and coffees were always full and our waiter was very accommodating and friendly. Feelings on this place:Do I feel clean?  Yes.  Do I feel sexy?  Not any more than I did coming in.  Does the food taste good?  Depends on who you ask, but I would say yes.  Will I come back?  Most likely not.",2,1,1,Jon L.,"Manhattan, NY",223,117,0

3.0,11/27/2016,"I spotted Nickel & Diner's clean/sexy decor on my way to the MoCA, and after some quick Googling decided to check it out after my museum visit. I was drawn in both by the beautiful interior design and the Chikarashi pedigree -- Chikarashi is my absolute favorite poké spot in NYC. I think Nickel & Diner probably runs a stronger brunch/lunch game than dinner, though my dinner here (during its opening week) was solid. They weren't doing anything revolutionary with their dinner dishes, whereas their brunch menu seems to provide higher quality fare than a lot of places in Manhattan that are just phoning it in. The waitstaff were all attentive, kind, and helpful -- though they weren't able to mitigate the odd timing of the kitchen (we got our dishes all out of order). And like Chikarashi, these dishes are all Instagram-ready. There's a nod to Chinatown in a few of the dishes, which seems fitting, given the location. We liked but didn't loooove the bok choy stir fry, and found the foie gras + diver scallops ($16) rich but not especially complex (both of these meats are sumptuously textured but didn't play well off each other). The roasted mushroom side was disappointingly devoid of salt, though that didn't hide the natural umami flavor of the fungi. The acorn squash was delightfully autumnal but ultimately a bit too sweet, and the shrimp was probably the best-spiced dish but even so, wasn't the most memorable restaurant shrimp we'd had recently. I felt that every dish needed a little more excitement; mostly, they felt like the small plates that every somewhat upscale, trendy restaurant in Manhattan is serving now. In the end, the food just wasn't all that memorable. New American/elevated classics is already done well in NYC, and I can't say that Nickel & Diner really bucks the genre. At least with Chikarashi, they were able to make their mark known in a relatively uncrowded market, but with Nickel & Diner, they have a lot of competition.",2,0,1,Natasha G.,"Sunnyside, NY",554,229,281

Nice interior, new but retro at the same time. Very spacious and welcoming, especially with all the big windows. Food:  We were very excited. I got the Ranchero omelette and my wife got the kale cashew bowl. She thought the bowl was ok. Decent flavor and satisfying, but not something she would crave.  My omelette on the other hand was a little disappointing. I read the description and was preparing myself for a flavor extravaganza! Sadly, I got an average omelet that barely had any of the ingredients inside. I'm not expecting a giant overstuffed egg dish, but I want the correct ratio of omelet-to-stuff inside. The coffee was very good though, but  the mugs are a little too small. Service:  Ok, not pleased here. Yes, I know they are new. But all the more reason to be giving each guest the attention they deserve. We were seated and maybe only 8 other people in the whole place at the time. We got our coffee, and placed our order. Then shortly needed a refill. Our server didn't check on us until way after our food was delivered. I even had to ask for more coffee, with two empty mugs on the table. I absolutely hate lukewarm coffee. Or no coffee. And never asked us how the food was, just seemed disinterested. Overall:  Nice place, decent food, poor service. So far.

It's still within a short walk of my current apartment, but had they opened a little sooner, they'd have been seeing me darn near every day. Some may call it a sign of gentrification in a predominately Chinese neighborhood, but I say they filled a much needed gaping hole in the market. They're fully open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner (after a hard stop at lunch), but so far I've only had a chance to try a fantastic breakfast sandwich. Hickory smoked bacon and country ham, two fried eggs, sharp cheddar, and basil vinaigrette on a kaiser roll, it was a step up from the classic deli BEC, but with many more bells and whistles. And at $8, it's a lot less that some of the other elevated breakfast sandwiches going around the city.

Everything combined together was just an amazing explosion of flavor in my mouth. The maitake mushrooms had the right texture and was very juicy. The fries are delicious and totally sharable.The hot chocolate was really delicious after our meal. The chocolate marshmallows are placed on the side and super delicious. At first, I felt that the hot chocolate did not have enough flavor, but after the marshmallow melted, it was very delectable. My friends tried to order alcohol, and then tea but they don't have either. Our waitress said they're in the process of acquiring a liquor license. My friend did order the cold brew and really loved it.The service here was pretty great. Our waitress was attentive and nice.Nickel & Diner is an awesome new brunch spot, and I am definitely coming back again. It is delicious and relatively cheap!Update: The BLT IS SO BOMB.",3,1,0,Elain T.,"New York, NY",631,169,121
5.0,11/13/2016,"An upscale diner in the middle of Chinatown might seem out of place- but step inside and you instantly feel a sense of nostalgia. Nickel and diner did a great job of modernizing the look while still giving us the feel of a classic American diner. From the quality wooden menu clipboards to the hooks underneath the booths- I appreciate the thought that went into each and every detail. As for the food- our group ordered the egg sandwich, salmon lox and steak burger. The egg sandwich is a must try! The burger was thick and juicy but didn't feel too heavy and greasy. We wrapped up with the peanut butter chocolate cake and vanilla soft serve. Perfection. You can also grab coffee to go as they have an in-house coffee booth stationed at the front. I hear the dinner menu is even better- will definitely be back for the lunch (chicken soup) and dinner (grilled lobster and dry aged ribeye) menu!",2,0,0,Elena L.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",0,7,4
5.0,11/12/2016,Came here for dinner with some friends.  I had the porkchop with farro risotto.  Both were delicious.  The porkchop was perfectly cooked.  I had it medium.  Also had the fried chicken appetizer which was very good.  Ambiance was great.  Good for both groups and dates.  Would come back again.  No alcohol served though.  They are still waiting on their liquor license.,3,0,0,Michael S.,"New York, NY",15,68,0

5.0,11/7/2016,"I've marked nickel & diner my go-to brunch spot because it is THAT delicious. The interior of the diner gives me a classic elegance and modern vibe(uh not sure how to explain that). We were greeted and seated by the hostess as soon as we walked in. I've tried the Buttermilk Pancakes,Roasted Maitake Mushrooms,Ranchero Omelette, and Salmon Lox. I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE the salmon lox. I am not a salmon fan BUT it was surprisingly delicious. The best part was the dessert. Kaffir key lime tart is a must order item. I will be back for dinner sometime this week! super excited. There might be a wait but it is well worth it.",5,3,4,Yannie H.,"New York, NY",13,112,68
2.0,11/7/2016,"I went to Nickel & Diner this weekend with high expectations for it, especially considering the Yelp reviews and a friend's recommendation. My sister had made a reservation for the both of us at 11:30 am on a Sunday. We arrived at the restaurant at 11:25 and was asked to wait. Fine, we were a few minutes early. No big deal. However, by the time 11:30 hit, we still had not been seated and other parties who had arrived as walk-ins had been seated before us. We tried not to let that bother us as we were brought to a nice big booth for the two of us. Seemed a little like a waste to seat the two of us at a booth big enough for six, but we weren't going to complain.Our waitress soon arrived after to introduce herself and poured us each a glass of tap and asked us for drink orders. However, it was only later when the table behind us sat down that I heard them being asked if they would like still, sparkling, or tap water. I'm not sure how I feel about not having been even given an option, but that's fine. Not a big deal.We soon put in our orders for Roasted Maitake Mushrooms, Classic Egg Sandwich, and a side of Potato Hash and proceeded to entertain ourselves with our phones and with conversation. However, fifteen minutes soon turned into thirty, at which point I believe our waitress stopped by to tell us that the food would be out shortly. Thirty minutes turned into forty-five minutes, and at that point, we were pretty concerned about how long we'd waited. We were really tempted to just walk out at that point (doubt we would have done it but the thought certainly crossed my mind), so it was good that our food showed up right then.By this time, we pretty much shoved our faces with the food because we were so hungry. I can't say that I would say the food was exceptional in any sort of way. It was good, but certainly not something that I would wait forty-five minutes for, especially since we consumed all three dishes in fifteen. Likely will not be coming back since I feel like there are plenty of other better options in the city to try out.",3,1,1,Myrna C.,"New York, NY",425,176,92
3.0,11/7/2016,"Good food - wait was horrendous. If you go expect the wait to take longer to sit down then what they tell you. I get that it's new and they are still dialing in everything, but it would have been nice if they acknowledged the wait by giving us something to snack / drink while we were waiting for our food.",0,0,0,Anthony D.,"New York, NY",49,12,4
4.0,10/31/2016,"This fancy diner from the Chikarashi  folks actually has no Howard St frontage far as I can tell (you enter on Centre St to a host stand on the right and a takeout counter ahead of you, with restrooms behind that). Friendly staffers took our order for the hazelnut crunch to go, which was quite good, but the bag and container were quite an excessive waste. The restroom also had no hand soap (empty bottle) and the receipt subject line is oddly from 'house account'.Hazelnut Crunch $3.50 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Subtotal: $3.50 Total Tax: $0.31 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Total: $3.81",1,2,2,George C.,"New York, NY",0,7747,14304
5.0,10/30/2016,"What a great addition to the neighborhood!  Comforting diner classics with a modern chef'd up taste.  You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu!  But-- my favorite for breakfast is the Classic Egg Sandwich.  It is perfectly delicious-- served on a classic poppy seed Kaiser roll with hickory smoked bacon and country ham, two fried eggs, sharp cheddar, and a basil vinaigrette.  So good that I couldn't stop thinking about it the whole week and returned back for breakfast the following week.  Coffee here is amazing, they also do a nitro brew. If you live close by, change your morning routine and pickup your coffee here!  There is a cafe area that you can do pickups if you do not sit down to dine.  Other great breakfast meals-- Kale Cashew Bowl, if you want to be healthy.  The Roasted Maitake Mushrooms plate is amazing and the Salmon Lox won't disappoint either!  For lunch, the fried chicken is a great small plate.  The Slow Roasted Squash is shockingly delicious that you won't be able to stop eating it.  Also a great silky delicious chicken soup that will warm your soul and fill you up-- the ricotta dumplings pair it up so beautifully. The sliders are a hit and the mac and cheese is one of the best I've had!  I also spied a soft serve machine!  What's not to love? Such a gem!",1,0,0,Kat W.,"New York, NY",165,55,6

5.0,10/30/2016,"My new favorite brunch place -- and I can't wait to see the dinner menu when they have one. The place isn't officially open yet for another week, but they are serving brunch and I think also lunch so far.  My friend and I had brunch today and I'll definitely go back.  I had the egg sandwich, a bargain at $8.  It comes with bacon, cheese, egg and I think ham on a Kaiser roll.  Really scrumptious.  I started with the chicken soup, which isn't much to look at but is very flavorful and has delicious ricotta filled dumplings.  (Wish they'd offer the dumplings as a menu choice by themselves.  The warm ricotta just oozed out of the middle.)  And the kefir lime tart dessert was also really appealing.  My friend had the macadamia pancakes and she liked them, although I don't think she was as wow'ed as I was.    Some other tables near us had ordered the burgers, and those looked mighty mighty fine.   As far as ambiance goes, the restaurant is airy and a bit deco in feeling.  It seemed very clean and new.  My friend called it a definite 2016 take on a diner.  A great addition to the neighborhood.Wheelchair accessibility notes:  The restroom I saw was a large single use bathroom with bars by the toilet and a mirror canted so that a wheelchair user could see him/herself.  The sink was on legs rather than cantilevered from the wall, so that might be a bit harder to use.  The hand dryer was at a level suitable for wheelchair users.  There are, however, two steps at the main entrance to get into the restaurant but a ramp at a secondary door.  The dining area is all on one level, but about 2/3 of the seating is either in booths or on elevated stools.  The North end of the restaurant has a seating area with at least 6 tables, and it would be easy to position a wheelchair to eat in that area.",1,0,1,Meg S.,"Manhattan, NY",3,137,0

4.0,10/23/2016,"Sunday brunch! This new place (soft opening 10am to 4pm now) just open 10 days ago, but it was packed when we just went there for brunch around 1pm!  We both ordered sandwiches which were average.  The place is spacious and clean with simple design which I like it, it is good for 2 people or a small group of 4-5, not sure it will do dinner in the future. Guess I will go back another time to try its lunch menu or other dishes, and hopefully it will serve some other drinks  beside coffee and juice  by the time, also with better preparation of food that they ran out of food and juice I wanted to order originally, but it could be understandable due to soft opening.",2,0,0,Joyce C.,"New York, NY",0,39,122

5.0,10/14/2016,"Ever wonder why nostalgia compels you to eat crappy quality diner food time and time again, forcing you to tell yourself the food is ""good"" for the sake of tradition? Well stop wondering since you'll be abandoning your sad habit and going to Nickel & Diner from now on. Its decor and menu philosophy undoubtedly pays homage to the classic American diner experience, yet it upgrades the experience via artisanal ingredients and execution by a world-class executive chef.  Just try the sliders and think about how empty your life was before you tasted this bite of awesomeness.  Have the freshly made lemon tart along with the Nobletree Coffee and then self-flagellate for ever having eaten those stale florescent-lit diner counter desserts and instant burnt coffee. Oh and its cheap too. So go for the 3 course experience here, folks.",2,1,1,Kang K.,"WALL STREET, NY",3,2,0
