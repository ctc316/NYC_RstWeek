3.0,4/7/2019,"Good, not great.  The service was decent and attentive, the food was okay, and we ended up marginally satisfied.  Appetizers we ordered were the burrata plate and beet salad.  The portions for these 14-15$ plates were underwhelming.  The burrata was exceptionally watery and the beet salad appeared to be simply some beets and greens placed on a plate.  Our entrees were equally underwhelming- 20+ for rigatoni and ~34 for seabass.  The rigatoni was way too salty and the seabass (similar to the beet salad) appeared to be simply a small piece of seabass topped with some greens and a dollop of some sort of puree on the bottom.  It wasnt a bad meal, but for the price point we were expecting much more than what we saw.",0,0,0,M A.,"Ridgefield, NJ",363,16,43
3.0,2/24/2019,"We had a great meal...but we had to do it at home. The restaurant was overbooked, and we ended up waiting over an hour and a half before giving up and asking for take-out. At least the food was good.  We had made a reservation for 7:45pm, but received a call the night before asking if we would move our reservation to 8:15pm because they had a large party of 19 people coming in right before us. The space is small, so we were understanding and happy to accommodate the request. I was less happy when we arrived at 8:15pm, and the host told us we'd be waiting another twenty minutes, especially because there wasn't even space to sit while we waited. In fact, dessert for the large party hadn't even been served yet, and we waited another hour and a half. With no end in sight, we decided to order the food to go. The host was apologetic, and really did try to make it right by comping our meal. While we didn't get to enjoy the atmosphere of the restaurant, once we got home to eat, the food was good. The grilled octopus was fantastic as was the carpaccio, the rabbit ragu was flavorful albeit a bit over-seasoned, and the only complaint about the mushroom pasta was that there wasn't enough of it. All in all, we had a great meal, but the restaurant needs to work on its reservations. I guess you could say we just got unlucky with this one.",0,0,0,Nikki S.,"New York, NY",1,4,0
4.0,1/31/2019,"Had an excellent dinner on Monday night. My BF had the lamb sausages and I had the Pasta con funghi. Our starters were the duck liver and beet salad. Each were huge portions and delicious. Our server, Ridley was friendly and considerate, checking in with each course. After dinner, we went next door to the wine bar. There we order the wine, we had at dinner. Enjoyed conversation and watched a movie with other patrons.  Lydia, the bartender took very good care of us and our water glasses.

4.0,1/2/2019,"This is a difficult review to write.  I found most of the dishes forgettable, and the service was a little wacky (we sat for ten minutes before the server realized we were hers, but then we seemed to be handed off to another server?).  The room was warmly lit, and refreshingly scene-free, but we practically sat in the laps of the two parties next to us.  However, the lasagna!!!!!  I don't even know what prompted me to order it - I never order lasagna anywhere.  This was one of the best things I ate all year.  Delicate, yet deeply, richly flavored - it was soul satisfying, and the only reason I would go back.",0,0,0,Jessica D.,"New York, NY",4,158,0

5.0,8/6/2018,"I have nothing but good things to write about the food here. This is my favorite spot in the city to get pasta when I'm craving it, and have found many other gems on the menu. The salads are always really solid, especially the wilted escarole, and the side vegetables are worth a try. As far as the entrees go, the only one I have had is the steak, and it was very well cooked.Now onto the pasta-- every single pasta I have had here has been AMAZING. My favorite is the Anelloni pasta with lamb sausage and mustard greens, but you can't go wrong with any of them. Service is generally good, and we have had really great experiences with the hostesses, who try to get you a table if they can, even on a crowded night without a reservation.

It was like being led up a MC Escher drawing--it just kept escalating to better and better. The beer--which we could only find in Italy--was here. The peach salad drizzled with vinegar was here. ...We didn't even know we were missing this but we were. The burrata. The pepper laced Chitarra pasta with crab meat. Then the cordials.

2.0,6/22/2018,"Made a reservation for a Friday night for 5 people. It's a slow dining experience so it's good to come only when not in a hurry. Occasionally we had to flag down our waiter but I think he knew a lot of the guests that evening and was being very social. Most if not all the cocktails have vermouth in them, which I'm not a fan of, so it made my options limited. I got the mushroom risotto. It was very good but they must've puréed the mushrooms because none were overtly visible in the dish, but I could definitely taste them. It was also a small portion for the price tag. All of the meals at the table were relatively close in color and just generally not visually appealing, although everyone said there's tasted good.

For the main course, I had the Rigatoni al Norcino and my friend had the Lamb Anelloni Pasta and WOW the flavors was out of this world. This is one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the city.

Contemptuous when I politely declined wine, then the party next to us complained about him to the host while we were there waiting for our meals...that was half of the clientele...and then he disappeared after we got our dinners. Never asked if we wanted grated cheese or black pepper, never came back to see if we wanted dessert. Never cleared our plates. Never came back. The host apologetically handled our check. The place was half seated. It is tragic when staff ruins an otherwise finessed food experience. I would never single out a specific server, but I will be calling the restaurant to see who needs to know how regretful at least 6 diners felt about his being on the floor.

However everything else was just ok. The salami was bland, the salad fine. I'm not a sommelier but I have a few wines that I know well and drink consistently. Every wine I ordered tasted off.  The worst part was that we ordered the pana cotta desert which when it arrived tasted sour  like it had spoiled. The waiter said it was the pistachio olive oil ( the menu said it came with pistachio and chocolate, no mention of olive oil). We sent it back and he took it off the check, which I appreciate. The service was slow and not incredibly-but it seemed like they were understaffed and doing their best. This was a busy Saturday night, my guess is week nights are better.

4.0,11/6/2017,"Porsena is a little Italian eatery in the East Village located in an old building that has probably seen decades (if not a century) of history pass its doors.  As you walk in you are greeted by a nice very nice host at a stand near the door.  Near him are tall tables with bar stills around them.  Next to that is a bar that runs to the back of the restaurant.  Opposite the bar are tables along a wall suitable for solo or duo dining.  If you have larger parties, you will wind up sitting on the other side of the wall where the main dining area is.  There is another section to the restaurant next door, but I did not go to it during my visit.I went on a Sunday evening and the lighting was dim but comfortable and the light glowed nicely against the brick walls and wood tables.  It is a very welcoming space indeed.  However, I would *highly* recommend making a reservation as far ahead of your visit as possible.  My friend who invited me had done so, which was fortunate because I watched people being turned away all night (at 7:30, one family was told they could not be seated until 10PM at the earliest).  Be warned.Given how absolutely jam packed the restaurant was, our service was slower than I think it would normally be.  During our meal there was more than one occasion where we wondered for a moment where our waiter had disappeared to.  Usually by the time we were about to ask, they would appear with our food and/or drinks.  The staff was certainly pleasant, but I think they were simply overwhelmed that night.Let's get to the good stuff: the food!  Because I went with two friends we had the luxury of ordering and sharing various dishes.  Here is what I was able to try:PAN-SEARED TUNAWith bulgur wheat, green olives, capers, cherry tomatoes, parsley, chili and orange glaze.Sear is right!  The fish was cooked perfectly with a fantastic seared crust on the outside.  I found the bulgur wheat only ""okay"", but the fish was the main attraction and it was great.HAMPSHIRE PORK CHOPWith creamy polenta, caramalized quince, honey, lemon, parsley.  This was fantastic.  The pork chop was perfectly cooked with a nice flavor partly thanks to the sauce on the plate.  The quince was a nice, sweet counterpoint to the savory pork.ANELLONI PASTAWith spicy lamb sausage, mustard greans, toasted bread crumbs.This is the dish that I am still dreaming about two days later.  The pasta in this dish was cooked perfectly.  It had a wonderful chew and flavor.  The spicy lamb sausage sauce and mustard greens were *out of this world*.  Note: my friend suggested pairing this with the Cantine Miali Primitivo (2013) and he was right.  Doing so really enhanced the dish's spiciness and flavor.LEMON OLIVE OIL CAKE (with lemon curd)The cake itself was good, but the lemon curd really helped elevate it into a really tasty dessert.  The cake was *just* on the edge of being a bit dry, but the curd made up for that.GOATS CHEESECAKEFeaturing goats cheese, lime and a pistachio crustThis was a very unusual dessert for me.  I had never had goats milk cheesecake and it was every bit as rich as you would imagine.  The pistachio crust and lime offered a nice balance to the flavor, but I'm glad I shared this as it was *so* rich I'm not sure I would have finished it on my own.The only minus I will give Porsena is their music.  In a word, their music was LOUD, making it hard to hear my friends even though they were sitting right next to me.  Oddly, the music being played sounded like a ""greatest hits of the 80's""  which really did NOT need to be pumped up to such a high volume.My first experience at Porsena was a really great one.  You know it was great when you are still thinking about the food days later.  I will definitely be returning!",3,0,0,Benson Y.,"New York, NY",393,1300,917
2.0,10/7/2017,My wife and I went to Porsena yesterday for a party. I had always disliked Manhattan dining because I believed it was for a large part pretentious and expensive. Porsena did not change that idea.We had a reservation and were seated by a table that was near the kitchen which was in itself distracting. We were then handed out some grain bread and some olive oil... not so fancy for an upscale place. I then ordered a bruscetta appetizer which i was told was only bread with garlic with NO bruscetta.Why have an appetizer with no ingredient as listed.I then ordered a mozzarella and pepper appetizer with the same bread as handed out which was not very good. Upon the recommendation of our waiter who said it was the best dish on the menu I then ordered a spicy sausage and ziti entree. This entree was bizarre since I could not find the spicy sausage in it. When I asked they said its in the sauce.It appears it was not visible to the naked eye and was very hard to find and the dish was nothing special If this is the best dish on the menu I cringe at eating the worst dish. I cannot speak for the others at my table but my meal was not very good at all. Service was OK and was mostly responsive. The price to value ratio was probably around or slightly below average for this type of restaurant. All in all this was a poor experience and if this is Manhattan dining I will remain on the South Shore of Long Island to dine.,0,0,0,Eric P.,"Boynton Beach, FL",71,332,0
2.0,10/4/2017,"What a terrible dining experience. The only thing this place had going for it was the ambience, which looked great from the outside... but once seated I was overwhelmed by the smell of the candle on the table. Was it a scented candle? I don't know... it was just very unpleasant and made me feel like I was inhaling fumes all night.The food is very basic, plus a lot of fat... meaning that it is essentially whatever you expect from passable Italian food with a ton of butter or cream added. I actually had a hard time eating the two different pastas I tried. The pastas are fresh and cooked nicely al dente... but the sauces were unbearable. And if the pastas were $12 each, I would probably roll my eyes and say ""oh well, you get what you pay for""... however at $20+ a dish, please... not worth it. And you know, I would give them a one star review, but I understand the business and I understand New York real estate. It is not entirely their fault. You simply cannot have a restaurant in the east village and charge less than $20 a dish... this is what has become of NYC, the rent is too damn high!",0,0,0,Bo H.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,77,4
3.0,10/3/2017,"Came here for a pretty large sized birthday party the other night and was a little underwhelmed. I understand that it all circumstantial but I'm just trying to write an honest review. The our reservation was made for 5:30, the same time the restaurant opens, but they doors weren't open until 5:35 so we sat outside and waited to see maybe they forgot about us, not a big deal though. The place itself was pretty big and very nicely decorated, but they sat us in the back next to the kitchen and back doors so our atmosphere left a lot to be desired, but again, I get that there's only so many places that they were able to seat us because of the size. Although we were on time for happy hour, we were told we could not participate in happy hour because happy hour was only available to *general hand gesture in some direction* a different part of the restaurant. The service was ok, at no point did I feel we were getting ignored, they did a good job dealing with my foreign family which usually come off as rude because of their language barrier (We're Russian and sometimes sound more aggressive than intended). I got the rabbit ragu in white wine sauce, which was good but not exceptional. It tasted home made, but not restaurant level dish worth $22? I don't know, I think some parsley could have made a world of difference, but they also didn't offer any Parmesan or pepper, which was odd to me. I tried my sisters pasta and enjoyed that more, don't remember the name of it though. The desert was, again, good but not exceptional. They were however nice enough to give us an additional lemon tarte that we didn't order (actually I don't know if they charged us for that as my dad took care of the bill, but I'm going to give them the benefit of a doubt!) I don't know, I wanted to like this place because of all the great reviews, but I personally wasn't blown away.

I went at about 8pm on a Thursday and the bar area was almost empty, so finding a seat was not a problem. The server was very sweet and offered a few suggestions - I opted for a glass of Pinot Noir and the Lumaconi Pasta.

I have been here five times in the last three months. Most of the pasta is delicious. The problem is that sometimes the chef forgets to salt the dishes. 4 out of five the dishes are great. The fifth time, we had to add lots of pepper, salt and chilli flakes. I went with a large group and ordered almost everything on the menu and at different days.

We were able to try each other's food and everything was amazing and delicious. Or dessert, he had the chocolate cake as well as the lemon cake.

The sweet corn and salty cheese balanced perfectly in the risotto. My husband raved about the homemade annelloni pasta with lamb sausage, practically licking the bowl clean.

1.0,2/14/2016,"My experience at this restaurant was more irksome than it was anything else, and the only reason I'm writing about it is the way it ended, which was with me forgetting my card after paying. Which is my fault, I get it. However, I'm 99 percent certain that the reason I had to cancel my card is because the Porsena staff decided to be jerks about it, due to the small tip I left for our server. Following our meal, we walked just a couple of blocks away to a CVS, and when I went to pay, I realized I didn't have my card, and I must have left it behind at the restaurant. I walked back to Porsena quickly (all of 10 minutes had passed since we left) and the host said he had cleared the table himself but hadn't seen my card; he went back to the bar to ask my waiter/bartender if they had seen it (or so I thought), but said it had not turned up. He asked me if I was sure that I hadn't taken it, and I said yes, I had checked every single pocket on me, and I didn't remember taking it, so I must have left it. He immediately became defensive, and suggested I hadn't looked hard enough; took my name and number, then suggested that I just cancel my card right away, which of course I was going to do anyway. About an hour later, he called and left me a voicemail claiming that they had ""found"" it, and that I could come and pick it up the next day, though I probably had canceled it by now. No explanation as to where it suddenly turned up, but due to that voicemail, I'm sure he was aware of it all along (after all, he was the one who cleared my table, and no one else was sitting at it when I returned to inquire about it), because, like I said earlier, I left a small tip. Here are the many reasons why I did not leave 20 percent:--Came here last night (a Saturday) with my boyfriend for a 6:00 reservation, and we were on time. The restaurant had all of 4 other tables seated and 2 servers in addition to the bartender, and we were seated in the front window nook, away from everyone else--which was fine and kind of romantic, at first. Except that we were virtually forgotten about throughout the evening. It took our waiter approximately 12 minutes before he came to take our order, but we weren't in a rush, and while bothersome, he was nice once he arrived, and recommended a really nice bottle of red.--We ordered the beef tenderloin salad to share (which was quite tasty) as an appetizer and then for our main meal, I got a buttery pasta with prosciutto, while my boyfriend got the trout with lentils and we shared a side of brussel sprouts. These were good as well, once we actually received them. Following our apps, the food runner brought out my pasta, but failed to bring out my bf's trout. At first, I thought it'd just be a couple minutes before the rest came, because that happens sometimes, but after 10 minutes went by (and our waiter failed to check on us), that didn't happen. We flagged the host, and told him we were waiting for the rest of our food, and he instantly apologized and took my pasta back and said they would re-fire our food and bring it all out together. It was only then that our server came to check on us and said that he thought we were sharing everything, and that we wanted it all one at a time, which is not a thing that any waiter anywhere has ever assumed about a main course dish. Unless your table tells you they plan on sharing everything, you don't assume such a thing, and even if a table does tell you this, that usually means that you bring all of the main courses out together with share plates, not one at a time. He apologized generously, and we were STILL okay, and thanked him for apologizing.--After our meal, they dropped a dessert menu, which we were too full to partake in, but my bf did decide that he would have a coffee to end our meal. Another 15 minutes went by with no one checking in on us (our waiter passed by frequently serving other tables, but mostly avoided looking in our direction), and by then, we were ready to go, and my bf no longer wanted his coffee. Finally, the host swung by--again, not our server--and we asked for the check.Unless I have a truly unfortunate experience, I always tip 20 percent, because I've been both a host and a server and I know that sometimes things are out of your control when you're on the other side of the experience. But while none of the service here was initially rude per se, they really dropped the ball, and there's no reason that should have happened, because again, we came here at 6pm when the restaurant was practically empty. A 20 percent tip was not earned in this case, and it's just unfortunate that I forgot to grab my card, because then I gave them a chance to retaliate. A minor annoyance, but in turn, I will not recommend this place to anyone, unless you're doing take out & don't have to deal with the inattentive staff.",3,1,3,Aisha H.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,1,0

The homemade buffalo mozzarella was tasty, but the arugula side was way over seasoned, and the bread did not compliment it well. The bread was dry and bland.  I saw that people raved about the olive oil for the bread, but it tasted no better than the Whole Foods oil I have at home. The mozzarella would have been much better with a light tomato salad. I have no idea why so much seasoning was on the arugula, but we couldn't eat it. I had the penne with the pork and ricotta. The penne was too al dente, it needed one more minute in the water, at least. The pork was gamey and odd tasting with the pasta, and I didn't taste the ricotta at all.My friend has the spicy lamb. That was the best thing that we ordered. It was spicy though, so if you are not into spice I wouldn't get this. The cream sauce it was in was good, and at least the pasta wasn't raw.

The extra bar we were in had a long bar stretching the majority of the space, and one small table in the window where we sat. Great people watching from the table! The main restaurant itself looked like a popular spot for large groups due to the size of the restaurant, particularly for the area. It's also located a few doors down from McSorley's, a popular NYC spot, so could be a good place to come before or after a beer there (or maybe to drop off any non beer drinkers before you head to McS's lol).

5.0,1/30/2015,"Amazing food, amazing ambiance, amazing staff. I went for a birthday dinner on a Friday evening and was blown away by the entire experience. I walked in to the restaurant area and was the first one there (obviously), but they led me next door to a more quaint bar area where I sat for a few minutes and enjoyed the scenery. The walls are covered with really interesting, exquisite art, and the dim lighting in the bar area and candles across the bar make it for a great date scene. The owner actually came up to me and asked if my whole party was coming, and when I told him maybe only 5 out of the 6 were coming he was actually super polite in asking if he could take a 2-person table out of our seating area. Honestly most restaurants I've been to are pretty rude with a 1-person late cancellation and force us to squeeze without asking, but I was really impressed by how respectful they were. When we finally got seated we got to know our server who was AWESOME. He recommended us a Xinomavro, which he really turned us onto. It was very easy to drink, a little fruity, and we all agreed that we could have been tricked to believing it was a white wine. The only thing is that the server was a LITTLE too shy in interrupting us to ask if we needed refills or if we were ready to order. He kept coming over and then leaving without saying anything, we had to flag him down a few times. The food is divine - I got the lasagna of the day, which changes but mine had some braised rib ragu and parmigiano baked in terra cotta. It's steaming hot when it comes out, and it's great to share if you get an appetizer as well (but of course I ate the whole thing because why not). My friends loved the anneloni pasta and the gnocchi. The nicest thing they did though was that they didn't give us just one, but TWO amazing desserts on the house for the birthday! We didn't even have to ask. They were so sweet to us, even though we were a large group of old friends catching up for hours, and the owner personally came up to me and asked about my experience when it was all done.

There was no energy or excitement, the lights were too bright, the bar area was stark and almost airport- bar feeling. We ordered a bottle of wine to start and again, boring.

We started with one of the appetizer specials, and I honestly cannot remember what it was. For a pasta course we ordered the pasta al ragu and it was probably the best thing we tried, the meat sauce was very flavorful and the pasta noodles were homemade.

2.0,9/3/2014,"I had high hopes for this place after reading reviews and looking at their menu online, but sadly, they didn't live up to their expectations for me.For starters, you can only make reservations on their online system for up to 4 people, and we had 6, and they don't open until the evening so you can't call ahead of time to let them know.  I made a reservation for 4 and in the comments box told them we had 6 people and that we're vegetarians.  After walking in, I realized we didn't really need to make reservations because only a few tables were occupied around 8:30pm on a Thursday evening.Little did I know, their menu changes daily and they don't have many options for customization.  Online, their menu had an array of vegetarian options, but when we sat down for dinner, there was only one vegetarian option - risotto.  I'm not a big risotto fan and there were 5 vegetarians out of the 6 of us that were there.  We asked if they could take the meat out of other dishes, but the waitress said that it would be difficult to do so and for those that she could take the meat out, we couldn't get anything else substituted.I understand that these restaurants are ""true"" Italian places, but when I made my reservation, I explicitly said that almost everyone in our party is vegetarian and then you only offer us one vegetarian option?  C'mon now.I will say this though, the vegetarian food we got was surprisingly decent.  I kept an open mind even though I was a bit frustrated with the service and lack of customization with the menu to suit their customers' needs.",4,3,0,Sunny S.,"Philadelphia, PA",136,386,145

3.0,3/10/2014,"KenScale: 7.5/10Porsena is an Italian restaurant by chef Sara Jenkins focusing on pasta dishes. It has that rustic trattoria vibe of Italy, but I think the dishes overall could have been dressed down a little.I started out the meal with escarole salad with garlic anchovy dressing and roasted beets. Escarole itself was crunchy, but I felt the heavy dressing undermined, instead of enhancing, the texture of the vegetable. Roasted beets were largely forgettable as well. I definitely expected greatness from the pasta dishes and ordered anelloni with spicy lamb sausage and mustard greens and rigatoni with ricotta cheese. I did love anelloni, a ring-shaped pasta dish with excellent spicy kick from the lamb sausage. Definitely one of the better pasta dishes that I had had recently. On the other hand, I thought rigatoni was too creamy. For dessert, I had panna cotta with dark chocolate, another OK dish but nothing spectacular.The restaurant does have a nice neighborhood atmosphere of East Village, with a charming dining room and bar area. It has a full bar with some nice Italian wine selection. Getting a reservation wasn't particularly challenging as long as booked a couple of days in advance. I wish other dishes were as good as the anelloni pasta (i.e. not too heavy yet offering the right balance of flavor and texture), because that dish alone might make me come back again. Maybe I could come back and see if other pasta dishes that I haven't tried are on the same level as the anelloni.",2,0,0,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738

We started with salads; I had the green beans with almonds and cheese and my friend had the mustard greens with grilled shrimp. I think this is one of the best salads I've ever had; the beans were perfectly crisp and the toasted almonds were a delicious addition. My friend's salad was delicious as well. We then shared a pasta (no fuss) of anelonni (might not be spelling that correctly) with lamb sausage. Oh my goodness was it good. The pasta was tender and the sausage was like a bolognese with cream, the right amount of spice.

2.0,12/15/2013,"We came here for brunch, having been curious about this neighborhood restaurant for quite some time. Unfortunately, the visit was a qualified disappointment. While the food was decent (though not for the $50 that French toast, steak and eggs, and two cups of coffee came to), service and almost everything else was a disappointment. The waitress was unfamiliar with the menu, and had to check with the kitchen what one of the menu items included. For a brunch place, they had no coffee (just Americano) and charged a ridiculous $5 per cup. $15 for two cups of coffee and one refill with a meal is not what I'm used to. A breadbasket for the table was available - if you paid an extra $6. The waitress forgot to ask how we wanted the steak prepared, and what she described as ""big, thick, and juicy"" was a tiny piece of steak next to uninspired eggs and home fries. The nutella French toast, made with sourdough bread and whipped cream, was a rare bright point, priced reasonably, tasty, and offered in a generous portion. Unfortunately, overpriced brunch items with no coffee, juice, or beverage, poor service, and disappointing portions means that we won't be wasting over $50 on two small brunch dishes again, with so many other tasty brunch options nearby.By the way, the ""Grade Pending"" sign that I noticed entering the restaurant, which means the restaurant received a bad health rating and appealed the grade, should have been enough to warn me away.",0,0,0,Michael C.,"Cooperstown, NY",0,5,0

Another 30 minutes later, the waiter came over and again apologized and said that the meal would be on the house; we had already waited close to 2 hours being seated for our entrees. They offered us wine, and a Salted Caramel gelato for dessert as well, which was probably the best part of the meal.The Pomodoro was cooked well and although it was a small portion, was satisfactory.

And there was a little pool of melted butter at the bottom, gross.  Also, the portion was TINY!!!!!!!! this is not an entree. A few of my friends ordered the anelloni, which was also dry.  Everyone licked their plate clean, but really only because we were all still hungry :(Go anywhere but here. Spend a little more money, go to Hearth. Spend a little less money, go to Frank. Spend equal money, go to Supper. Better yet, just go to Osteria Morini, that place is a revelation.",0,0,0,Irene C.,"San Francisco, CA",1,6,0

4.0,10/22/2012,"After hearing rumors of ""overrated,"" I was nervous about Porsena, as I really wanted to like it.  I had this perfect date planned out in my mind, starting with McSorley's next door and finishing with Big Gay Ice Cream Shop, all along the same block in the East Village.  AND IT WORKED.  Porsena absolutely exceeded my expectations - but on dishes that I didn't think I'd love.  I can see how individuals ordering old standbys or tried-and-true favorites might feel slighted, as my own order was the dish I liked the least.  Thank goodness I have a partner who is willing to share.Porsena is a long, rectangular shop with a romantic feel and cozy wooden tables, lit by candles.  We had a nice two-top by the window, and our server was totally hip.  She was attentive, knowledgeable, and disarmingly honest.  Big fan.  To drink - we decided on a bottle of tuscan red, which was light and tasty - her suggestion.Tom surprised me by steering us towards the seared whole cuttlefish for appetizer, served with baby artichokes in white wine.  I'd never pick this by my lonesome, but I'm so glad he suggested it - it. was. bomb.  The cuttlefish itself wasn't standout, but it was large - a little thicker and tougher than I'm into for a calamari-type dish - but the baby artichokes were absolute perfection.  I'm not even in love with artichoke hearts, I find them to be the least exciting part of a stuffed artichoke, but Porsena turned me into a believer.  The white wine sauce was salty, buttery, and clean, with the leafy vegetables and soft hearts - love, love, loved this dish.On to the real reason why we're here - pasta.  My senses immediately led me to the rigatoni with garlic sausage, ricotta, and black pepper - but my senses did me wrong.  I really didn't love this one.  The sausage was crumbly, but was blended thick with the ricotta.  Pepper was overwhelming..there wasn't enough liquidity here.  It was like dunking bread into a dip that doesn't give, and was too heavy.  Fail, and I always love rigatoni!  HOWEVER - Tom ordered the anelloni.  A ring-shaped pasta I've never had before, looks like calamari to the untrained eye.  This came with a spicy lamb sausage, much lighter, less overwhelming, a super-thin tomato broth, and mustard greens.  The spicy greens absolutely crushed it here - it was perfection.  I can't wait to come back and try this dish again.  We ended up switching plates, as he ended up liking the black pepper and ricotta rigatoni.I thought I knew what I liked - especially on an Italian menu....apparently, not always so.  Glad Porsena was able to surprise me.",3,0,0,Emily R.,"Manhattan, NY",452,361,4

We only do this once a month so we have to get it right. Well Porsena was by far the best date night we had so far. They are affiliated with Porchetta which is an Italian Street Food Sandwich Shop that we frequent quite often. My husband heard about Porsena and decided we should give it a try. It is tucked away all the way downtown on 7th Street. The interior is really beautiful, charming and inviting and so is the staff. We decided to have dinner at the bar area, which is rather our preference then sit at a table. The bartendress was AMAZING. She picked out our entire meal and recommended probably one of the best red wines we have ever had. We started with Mussels and the broth was so good I almost picked up the bowl and drank it. Thankfully, they give you homemade bread to dip it in.  Our second course, we split the lamb rigatoni and it was so flavorful that I regretted not getting two orders so I would not have to share. Our third course was the pork chop with butter beans and red shredded cabbage. It was so yummmmy I kept trying to take more then my share.

Two stars for effort -- but would not waste a 3rd meal here.  With so many great pasta places in NY, why go here?  (Much better pasta in the city: Osteria Morini, Spigolo, Marea, Locanda Verde, Maialino, Scarpetta, Bar Pitti, and at a lower price point, a handful of places in the EV).",1,0,1,MT P.,"New York, NY",2,36,2

The average entree was about $17 or $18 and adding in a drink and even an appetizer the dinner would not have cost more than $40 with tip and tax. I do believe that the fixed price did not include a drink. While we were still waiting for our seventh person one of my friends returned to ask the hostess why would they vary from the posted menu. She mentioned that they had a small kitchen and they would not be able to prepare that many individual dinners at once. Strange, to-say-the-least because if 3 couples came  in at the same time they would be accommodating them. I'm sure I will never venture into this place again.

Now it's not a huge restaurant by all means, and there were maybe 3 parties of 2 waiting (including us).  As we waited by the bar, she appeared completely baffled as to who was next.  I began to wonder if this was this same lady I had spoken to multiple times in an attempt to get a reservation, and if maybe those other nights there were actually tables free but she was just too confused to be able to schedule it.  We continuously peaked into the dining room and saw multiple open tables, but oddly enough she continued to come in and out and tell us a few more minutes (""a few minutes"" ended up being a bit over a half hour).  In all fairness, we were walk-ins, so a wait is understandable, but the way she handled it was a little bizarre.  Why they weren't filling all the tables was beyond me...So the big question: Was it worth the wait?  I so badly want to say yes, but no. The entire meal can be summed up in one word: disappointment. I'm a huge pasta fiend, and amongst my favorites are Maialino and Osteria Morini, which I already knee not to expect anything in those leagues.  However, I was expecting good, solid comfort food.  My general approach at trying a restaurant for the first time is to order whatever I feel is appealing.  Try everything so that you can make a proper decision.  This way if you dislike it, you don't have to ever have to even consider coming back.So the important stuff. What we ate:1) Pasta Special: amatriciana with home made pancetta. Sounded delicious.  When it arrived the sauce was reminiscent of leftover Ronzoni spaghetti with Ragu sauce out of the bottle, reheated in the microwave. The sauce was dried out onto the spaghetti, the spaghetti itself was very stiff (not in the good al dente way), with only a few microscopic pieces of flavorless pancetta.  2) Pasta with lamb sausage - probably the best dish of the meal.  The pasta like shortened rigatoni were tender and the sausage bits very flavorful - just the perfect amount of spiciness to give it a welcome kick.  I'm not a lamb fan at all, but this was a solid dish, though not outstanding. The odd part of the dish, was that the sausage chunks were very dried out, yet on the bottom of the dish, was a puddle of grease.  I'm no chef, but know that sausage can be quite fatty, and when they are fried up they release a lot of grease. But here, it seemed as though the kitchen had completely fried all the grease out of the sausage meat, then dumped it into the pasta. 3) pasta al ragu. When I see ragu on a menu I think of a hearty red sauce with lots of meat and  flavor.  Complete fail here. The little tubes of pasta were cooked al dente, which I appreciated. However, where was the sauce?  Even the dried out sauce on the special pasta was more than this dish.  When they say slow-cooked on the menu, I guess they mean slow cooked to the point where all the sauce evaporates.  And I don't know about the meat, or lack thereof.  There were small dried out pieces of meat scattered, but nothing substantial. 4)  Braised beef shin.  To begin with, I love short ribs and just recently the menu changed and the short rib dish I was looking forward to trying got replaced with beef shin.  Not letting this deter me, I thought the beef shin may have potential.  If properly prepared it had potential.  The disk was served on some pretty bland polenta, with a brown sauce that was nothing to write home about.  The meat itself - the cut wasn't the greatest.  The meat wasn't fork-tender, as I had hoped for.  Edible and ok, but I expected more.  All in all, I left the restaurant feeling full, yet disappointed.  The food was not worth the price, nor the wait, and I felt like it was a big build up to nothing special. I'm glad we ordered the food we ordered, because I can safely say I won't be returning.  If you're in the area, I'd recommend walking a few more blocks to Barbone where the pastas are fresh, tasty and reasonably priced.",0,0,0,Pam W.,"Manhattan, NY",1,16,0
4.0,5/22/2011,"I finally got to check this place out and I did quite enjoy it.While waiting for my date to arrive, I sat at the bar for a bit and enjoyed a full sail IPA.  It did indeed put some wind into my sails as I had worked out a couple hours previous, and had not eaten all day.  So I sipped!  Within five minutes a nice gentleman - perhaps a host or manager of some kind, asked me if I'd also like some bread while I waited at the bar.  Attention to detail, I like that!  Once my date arrived we were seated right away.  This being around 7:30 I was pleasantly surprised.  We ordered the snow-pea salad and green bean fennel salads to share as appetizer and we were both dazzled by these tasty prequels.  They know how to make a salad at this place I will tell you that.  My date enjoyed the pasta with meat ragu sauce and I got the penne with cauliflower and place olives.  Mine was on the mild side overall and not overly rich and heavy like some italian places.This place is really nice and would definitely go back.  My only minor gripe was the decor was a little plain for my tastes.  Very clean and new, but somehow lacking some artful flair or style that I enjoy at Max, Supper or Gnocco.",3,0,0,Sean S.,"Manhattan, NY",757,1661,36
2.0,5/21/2011,The food was great and deserves 4 stars. I went with a friend who loves it here and had the pomodoro pasta and the market salad. Both were excellent! I wish the portions were larger it was so good we could have eaten more! Our waiter was super nice and didn't try to rush us. The busboy was also super nice.The reason i'm giving it 2 stars is because the hostesses were horrible. There were four tables open in the front of the restaurant and they told us to wait just incase someone showed up for a reservation. After ten minutes and nobody showing they gave us a table. The next people showed up for like 25 minutes later and they had to wait even though there was 3 tables open in my viewing range. Then the rude hostess kept walking past our table and glaring at us and our food trying trying to get us to hurry up. Then it was even weirder when the two hostesses started talking about us and pointing from the front of the restaurant. I would definitely order food to go but I would only attempt dining here earlier in the day to see if service is better.,4,1,0,Dani J.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,8

I had an annoloni with homemade lamb sausage and broccoli rabe that ruled and was so spicy I had to dab my sweaty neck with a napkin. I know, gross. I also loved the mussels appetizer, mmmm those yummy little mussels with white wine and garlic. My Dad raved about his pork chop but my brother was less enthusiastic about his roast chicken entree. According to reviews, this is a great place to take a date but the acoustics weren't great and it was hard to hear. Also I know this is nitpicking but the wooden chairs were uncomfortable and tilted backwards, so it's hard to stay engaged in conversation. Would I go back?

It was just boring and plain - I really needed any sort of parmesan cheese, but felt rude asking. My dining partner's spicy lamb was the only uplifting part of the meal.

My wife and I consider ourselves sophisticated eaters. We've eaten in any number of Italian restaurants. We've allowed newer places their opening jitters. This was a case of food that should never have reached the diner's table , especially with the chef in residence at the time of our dinner.Serving pasta rings that are severely undercooked ( wife and my order ) and lasagna that is severely overcooked to the point of mush and very underseasoned ( son's order ) is inexcusable.

4.0,3/25/2011,"It's Friday, cue Rebecca Black's catchy hit, and Brian M. and I want to go partying, partying (yeah)! Actually, we're just arguing over where to go out for dinner. The whole, ""you pick"", ""no, YOU pick"", ""NO - I picked last time"" bantering goes on and on until almost an hour later, we're starving and still at square one. Thank you, Sara Jenkins*, aka the female version of Mario Batali for solving our Friday dining issues. First up, baby octopus. Alright, I digress, but I get REALLY excited when I see Brian eating exotic things. Octopus is pretty damn exotic for a man who never ate fish before his senior year in college. So the dish? Scrumptious. The octopus: Juicy, tender, explode in your mouth with flavor. The accompanying citrus ingredients of orange and lemon, finished off with a hit of saltiness from the olives was perfecto. I could have done without the celery. Obviously, I highly recommend this. I ordered the Penette Col Cavolfiore for my entree and devoured that m'fer in about 10 minutes. The harmonious blend of the roasted cauliflower, olives, and capers really did me in. Ohhh yes, and the toasted bread crumbs on top created a beautiful crunchy texture to my pasta. Love, love, love. Simple, subtle, with a zing of an end. Brian got the Orrechiette Con Salsiccia E Rape. The pasta was just the right amount of al dente, sitting in its pool of spicy lamb ragu, over tender mustard greens. OK, I just drooled while typing this at work. What to not order? The Mozzarella Crostini. Yikes, I did not like the rubbery texture of the melted mozzarella. It tasted oddly like the cheese on a Domino's pizza. I've read that Sara Jenkins hates Yelp because she can't take some of the angry reviews. Don't worry, Sara, they're all haters.

What seem like a good start with Barcala Mantecato salt cod and baby octopus gave us the illusion it was going to be a memorable meal. The octopus was tender and flavorful with spoonful of capers+onion. The slightly toasted crunchy cod was dancing in my mouth when I took the very first bite. The place is suppose to be known for its pastas but i beg to differ. Pasta Al Ragu should be a simple staple to any Italian/pasta restaurant. However, Porsena manage to make is bland, tasteless and the meat can easily pass as unidentifiable!?! In addition, we ordered the special duck pomodoro + clam spaghetti which both are equally anticlimactic and very disappointing.  Perhaps it should consider serving tapas style dishes and just stick with starters only.  The decor + atmosphere gave us the old run-down pizzeria vibe with harsh lighting hanging above.

Interesting take on pasta (basically a taller, fatter rigatoni) with great balance between the hearty and savory crumbled lamb (it's not particularly strong tasting) and the bitter mustard greens.

3.0,2/22/2011,"There has been a lot of hype about Sarah Jenkin's new ""pasta"" restaurant, from a rave review from NY mag to a short (but positive) blurb in the NY Times. Given that my eyes rolled to the back of my head when I had my first Porchetta sandwich, I was eager to try this place. I went into the meal expecting simple, home cooked dishes but also expecting that something extra (flavor, perfect execution, unique ingredients) that made Porchetta so great. I did not find it. I think Porsena is a great neighborhood spot. As other reviewers have said, the service is accommodating despite the large crowds waiting and the space is big and airy for an east village spot. However, I do not feel that the food warrants all the attention and definitely not worth trekking from uptown or making reservations 1 week in advance. Appetizers: Baby octopus over chickpeas and sliced oranges. While the octopus was tender, the rest of the dish was kind of bland and undersalted. The citrus underneath should have added a great element, but the oranges were bland as well (and it's orange season!) Mozzarella and Bottarga - delicious toasted bread, good mozzarella, and bottarga which is salty and umami-ish. It's a great combo and a good idea, but nothing that another restaurant could not make. Mains: Lamb sausage with anneloni - For some reason, the NY  mag review made me think that this pasta would be some really crazy shape. It looks like thick, short rigatoni basically. The lamb sauce is very good - flavorful, creamy, and disappeared too quickly.Pasta al ragu - Ziti with a bolognese meat sauce that looked like something I would have had in college after a drunk night out. There was not enough meat flavor (maybe just not enough meat sauce) and all I could taste was the pasta after a while. When you eat this dish after you have had the lamb sausage anneloni, it is like drinking red wine and then having Kool Aid. Beef Shin - Very impressive looking piece of meat that comes on a huge plate with braised red wine sauce and polenta. Hearty and tender, but the sauce was a bit salty and the polenta did not add anything to the dish. I know that Jenkins is making pasta the Italian way - mostly pasta, little sauce, not crazy amounts of meat, and the pasta is made very well. However, I feel that her prices do not justify the food that she is making. $17 dollar dishes that essentially amount to ""homestyle pasta"" that I could get ingredients for at Eataly. To justify her price points, her pasta needs that extra ""oomph"" - that element of restaurant stuff that you can't get anywhere else. To compare, Babbo's Mint Love Letters with lamb sausage has about 6 components which blend perfectly... and it's $20. Dessert: The Panna Cotta was good... but it comes in a 3 inch ramekin and contains about 1 inch of panna cotta (topped by 1.5 inches of whipped cream). For 7 dollars?? Pass...Try it out if you are in the area but not worth going out of your way for this spot. I also feel that it's not as if East Village or lower manhattan in general is lacking great homestyle pasta places.

4.0,2/17/2011,"In the interest of full disclosure, I have to say that I was already a Sara Jenkins fan, for both her food and general way of doing business (does everyone know she sent 300 pork sandwiches to US Marines in Afghanistan?).   However, I am an even bigger fan of good food so this should still be a reasonably accurate review.The service was really fantastic.  Even though the hostess warned me in advance that they were very tightly booked (Saturday evening) and would only hold the reservation for 10 minutes, when we got stuck in traffic and then had a terrible time finding parking, they ended up holding the table for us for more like 40 minutes because we called to let them know we would be late.  And they didn't make us feel guilty about it either.  It's a great spot for family, or for a first date, because it's not too pricey and not too intimate, and there is a very bright, social atmosphere about the place. Now for the food.....In true SJ fashion everything was prepared perfectly and meticulously, but in a welcoming and unfussy way.  All of the ingredients were extremely fresh and high quality. The portions are a perfect size, especially because Sara always seems to give you a little extra sprinkle of whatever makes the dish especially yummy, like the cheese or the sausage.  You can order pasta here and still be able to walk when you leave.Starters:poached baby octopus: extremely flavorful and texturally perfect - no rubberyness here.green bean, fennel, and slivered almond salad - very tasty and perfectly dressedtoast with salami and anchovies - so good. there were people at the table to don't like anchovies, and they loved the anchovies.  there were also people who don't care for salami and they loved the salami.  people were fighting over the remnants.Mains:Pasta Pomodoro - I wanted to really test Sara's pasta mettle with this classic, and she did not disappoint.  The pasta was al dente and was nice and tomatoey...and cheesier than i expected, which was a nice surprise.Pasta al Ragu - my sister took one bite of this and warned me ""If you want to taste this, you better do it now.""  it was really yummy, and there was a great amount of sausage.Lasagna al Forno - ohhh how I love individually baked lasagna!  it was really perfect....steaming, cheesy, meaty, and oozy, with an awesome cheesy crust on top.Braised Beef Shin - this was an entire slice of braised shin...as in, a segment of a cow's leg.  it was braised whole and served on a bed of creamy polenta.  the meat was so tender that it was falling away from the bone in the center like flower petals and had a huge chunk of marrow in the middle waiting to be dug out.  This was a crazy portion of meat...there was by far more meat on this plate than there was pasta in my bowl, but perhaps the most important thing to know about this dish is that at no point was any sort of knife required to eat it, because it was so tender.

With so many amazing restaurants in NYC, inconsistency to this degree guarantees we won't be back. This is a shame as Porsena has the potential to be a great local. Service: this is the main reason for such a poor score. We were there on Saturday night and the maitre d' seemed so overwhelmed, there weren't enough serving staff and when we did get someone's attention they were seriously slow. When we were waiting for our table we saw 3-4 empty tables that just needed to be cleared so we could sit down. It was not only annoying as we could have been sitting down, it was also a bit gross watching dirty plates congeal. Food: Good in part. We had the crostini, salt cod, lasagna and lamb sausage pasta. Crostini and salt cod were fine (way, way too much bread though). Lamb sausage was delish, lasagna was pretty terrible. Lasagna had no meat, it was just layer after layer of stodgy pasta and was pretty tasteless. Also, at $22 was priced a bit steep. Atmosphere: decor is fine but there's something a bit cheap looking about it. Can't quite put my finger on it but it's lacking a in atmosphere - if it weren't busy, it would be a pretty average.

Paint that red black and maybe add a fan to move the air and you've got a perfect neighborhood hang with yummy food.",1,0,0,East V.,"Manhattan, NY",7,38,0
5.0,2/5/2011,"Even though I'd never been to Porchetta, I knew Sara Jenkins had something going when I watched a 12-year-old skate kid make the fastest bee-line I had ever seen to the Porchetta table @ Brooklyn Flea, with five-dollar bill ready in hand, for the Porchetta sandwich. [Longest run-on sentence, check.]  So when I heard about Porsena, I was very excited to go. And I absolutely loved it, in every way. Here's why:From the moment we walked in, we were greeted by a lovely hostess, who was completely unpretentious and friendly. 45-minute wait, but on a Friday night with no res, that's to be expected. We gladly put our names down. Around the block, a glass of wine and 45 minutes later, we came back and were offered bar seats or an additional wait for a table. We opted to wait for the table, to allow the waiter enough time. Our waiter brought our menus and took our drink orders at just the right time, with a great wine rec. What we ate:- Green bean and fennel, red onion, almond salad - light and refreshing, yet satisfying. Perfect to start a meal and exactly the type of food I'd love to make for myself!- Crostini w/ mozzarella and bottarga - tasty, ordered this because I was dying to try bottarga. Got a hint of bottarga flavor in this, but not as much as I'd hoped. But still cheesy, toasty and delicious.- Roasted cauliflower pennette - if this was any regular Italian place, this dish alone would get 5 stars, the flavors were perfect, pasta al dente. But unfortunately, this does not compare (and nor would anything else, btw) to the next dish... - Lamb sausage annelloni - ""OMG."" - is what I could not stop saying after every bite. I am not going to even try to put together a description, only to say - spicy, creamy, flavorful, comforting, balanced, orgasmic, eyes-shut-bliss, incredible, die die die, boo-na-nas. Get the picture? Definitely one of the best things I have EVER eaten. Go and get it!!! You too, will die.- Chocolate almond torte - this was just OK, but honestly who cares about dessert with this kind of food?!!!!Every waiter or runner was so nice, smiles with every dish. Just a lovely, cozy, perfectly NY restaurant!  Will definitely be back to try more!!",6,3,5,Sasha H.,"New York, NY",33,575,0

3.0,1/24/2011,"After several years of enjoying regular trips to Porchetta (and pickups from their table at the Brooklyn Flea), as well as avidly following Ms. Jenkins' excellent contributions to The Atlantic, I had high hopes for my first meal at Porsena.  Unfortunately, it was a bit of a let down.Appetizers, pastas and wine were all interesting and tasty, if somewhat expensive.  While I respect the extremely high cost of opening and maintaining a Manhattan restaurant, $17 for a small bowl of dried pasta with cheese seems somewhat excessive.  However, there is no one to blame here but myself as I had ample opportunity to examine the menu prior to visiting for dinner.The truly disappointing part of this meal was the service.  After placing our order, we waited 15 minutes for two crostini appetizers, and then an additional 45 minutes (1 hour from placing our order) for two pasta courses.  Certainly some of this delay could be attributed to the kinks of a restaurant still in its infancy, but perhaps Porsena is understaffed.Perhaps my overall disappointment was due to my admittedly lofty expectations, but I do not plan to return to Porsena in the near future.  Hopefully things improve, as Ms. Jenkins is a demonstrably great chef and the atmosphere of the Porsena is very welcoming.",0,1,0,Will W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0
3.0,1/6/2011,"Ok, I love Porchetta. So when I heard she was opening a sit down Italian place I was stoked. The evening started off well enough, octopus salad, Pork Aspic and Di Palo's mozz crustinis. One of the best octopus dishes I have ever had. Pork aspic was just OK (a little under salted and the herbs over powered the pork taste). The Crustini was a total waste of time. I love Di Palo's. The cheese was bland the shaved tuna loin was not there. Entrees.  The lamb sausage pasta was good and flavorful (a little to salty for my taste and the pasta a little too al dente for my liking).           The Lasagna was good (but $22 come on.). The pork chop was amazing cooked almost perfectly (med rare was how I ordered it came out closer to med). The beans that came with the pork were completely flavorless, boring and uneventful. the cabbage salad on top was just okay. Dessert the lemon olive oil cake was good but was confused when the menu said it came with whipped cream and we got what appeared to be lemon curd (with way to much lemon zest). Didn't try the chocolate walnut cake. it looked good though. Service. I thought the service was good however one of our party is a wine drinker and the server never offered to refill her glass and she probably would have had 3 glasses of wine. At $9 a glass way to blow your check average. Will be back to see if they can fix some of",2,0,0,Chris G.,"New York, NY",74,33,3

4.0,1/3/2011,"The space is a little strange (somehow I expected it to feel a lot more rustic) but the food is great.I tried out Porsena during one if its first two weeks of opening and I really enjoyed the food.The bread (from Sullivan Street Bakery) was outstanding.For appetizers, we tried the mozzarella crostini with shaved bottarga was mouthwatering.  It had a really amazing, savory aroma and tasted delicious.  It's a heavy appetizer though and can easily be shared among two.  The olive oil-poached baby octopus was tasty but not particularly memorable.For entrees, we tried the lasagne and the braised short ribs.  Both were very yummy.  The lasagne required a 20-minute wait but it was definitely worth the wait.  It was served bubbly and piping hot in a earthen crock and my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  The shortribs were also very tasty and meltingly tender.  However on hindsight, perhaps for a first visit it would be better to stick to the pastas since that's her specialty.",2,1,1,Princess M.,"New York, NY",33,337,591
2.0,12/28/2010,"I really wanted to like the place. I really wanted to love it.  I love Porchetta. I came expecting big bold italian flavors, and a warmth that would carry over from Porchetta.It is early days, but I was quite disappointed.  The rooms are very cold, the walls are empty, and except for a large painting at the end of one of the dining rooms, the walls are bare and the banquette seating is hard and wooden.  And the food - perhaps it was a bad night - everyone has one of those - but the sauces were thin, the flavors were watery, and the beans accompanying the pork chop tasted like someone rinsed them under water after they were cooked.One of the appetizers, just looked bad - a crostini with bottarga looked awful - and tasted bland.I am going to wait a few weeks and try again.",0,0,0,Quite C.,"New York, NY",0,44,0
2.0,12/19/2010,"An important note up front:**If you come with a group of 7 or more, you MUST ORDER the family style dinner, which is $60 a pop. And they're really, really, really, really obnoxious about this**And on to the food! We had 7 people that night and they neglected to tell us about the ""family style"" requirement and were quite peeved by the fact that we refused to pay for that style of dinner, and made it a tacit requirement that we order some appetizers to share, and were very persistent when asking us to order dessert (by the way, their reasoning for forcing the family style menu is that it's too hard get all those orders of different things out at the same time. Take it as you will)Anyway, we ordered some crostini (pretty good) and aspic (good) to start. When the main courses came, I was pleasantly surprised that they had relatively smaller portions, but with enough food to fill you up. I was unpleasantly surprised by how unmemorable the Pasta Al Ragu was. To be completely honest, the ragu had no depth of flavor beyond the flavor of the meat itself, which was quite dry, and the pasta was unspectacular.On a good note, Olive Oil cake to finish was really really good and you can't complain about $4 beers. If I were rating just about food they'd receive 3 stars, but since they took out their mistake (not telling us about family style dinner) on us (by forcing us to spend more money than we would have liked), it's easily -1 star.2 stars for unmemorable food and not so friendly serviceRevisit?

5.0,12/17/2010,"I don't get some of these other reviews.  Sure, everyone is entitled to their opinion, but really now... Surely it couldn't have been THAT bad as some would lead on.  Also, considering they have only been open like 2 weeks, I'm able to give a little leeway in my view and take into account the growing pains that comes with opening a restuarant. So, disclaimer aside, I loved Porsena.My boyfriend and I are like vaccumm cleaners and can put away a rediculous amount of food when put to the challenge. We started off with the Crostini which was simple, elegant, and generally wonderful.  We also had the Mussels which were great.  AND they are very happy to provide as much bread as you need to soak up all the juicy white wine saffron garlicy goodness when the mussels run out. We tried a few pastas, the Penette Col Cavolfiore was great and different than most pasta dishes you will find.  It was on the dry side, but delicious in every way.  I also really enjoyed the Brodo, again something I wouldn't normally find or order (or make at home).  It is very tasty...  In both cases, our pasta was cooked to our liking.Hands down, my favorite part of the meal was the Short Ribs.  I am such a sucker for short ribs.  I like to try to make them at home, but apparently I never have enough time or patience to make them fall off the bone and melt in my mouth.  Sara Jenkins has the time, patience AND TALENT to pull off one the best versions I've had in the city.  The Hake was good, but I'm not much of a Fish person...I thought the service here was pretty good compared to most places, especially in the E.V.",5,2,2,James P.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,31,6

2.0,12/14/2010,"The one thing I hate more than getting a bad restaurant or bar recommendation from a friend is giving one out. It triggers an unrepentant sense of guilt, especially when it fails another person's expectations. Dining out is expensive, and the opportunity cost of going out in terms of time and money spent, especially in this economy, is even more poignant.One would think Porsena would be amazing, given the fact that Sara Jenkins brought us Porchetta, the Italian version of the French ballotine, a stuffed roll of deboned pig, spices, and seasoning rolled up into a greasy, porky bundle. The woman can cook and the woman can write, but there were several challenges of opening a new restaurant that have not yet been overcome. Most noticeable was that service was consistently uneven throughout. Despite making a reservation for 6:30pm that day, we were sat on a two-top that was directly in the line of Arctic chill. We politely asked to get a table in the dining room adjacent to the bar as to avoid turning into little Frostys. Additionally, the waiter asked to take our apps on two separate occasions, both when our apps were halfway done and when they were three-quarters done. Understandably, the waiter was trying to turn the table before the 8pm reservations, but this is Italian dining and one shouldn't be rushed during service.The meal was also uneventful. After scouring the few reviews of the place, we decided to have the crostini with salumi and anchovies, lasagna, and short ribs. The crostini was a decent app to start out with, but the stinginess of the olive-oil salt cured anchovies and salumi slices were noticeable. The lasagna was a limpid mille-feuille of pasta, with none of the bechamel sauce or cheesy crust asserting any tangy flavor or texture. The short ribs were the most disappointing dish of all, with the funky meatiness that one would associate with a Sara Jenkins production having leached onto the plate amid a tepid slick of polenta.At the end of dinner, I joked to my dining companion that I was considering an audible to to Osteria Morini before coming here; in retrospect, this was most likely the decision best taken.",8,2,2,Jonas M.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,166,0
2.0,12/7/2010,"I wanted to like this place, I really did.  Porchetta is one of my favorite sandwiches in our city of plenty.  Thus, I assumed the long awaited Sara Jenkins follow-up to her sandwich spot would be good or even great.Unfortunately, this is not so.Firstly, Porsena is poorly laid out.  For no particular reason, there are two separate dining rooms.  As for the tables themselves, they're a rather tight squeeze, so seating requires moving both your and your neighbor's table.  Porsena still exudes that sandwich shop atmosphere, even though it's masquerading as a sit-down restaurant.    Moving on to the food -- which could've saved this review -- Jenkins continued to disappoint.  My Italian convive and I ordered simply since Porsena aspires to be a hole-in-the-wall with home-cooked traditional entrees.  It's supposed to be what you could make in the kitchen, but better.  Alas, no.  The pasta al pomodoro is a standard tomato, basil, and parmigiano spaghetti.  With such few ingredients in this dish, I expected them to individually shine.  It was not to be: GARLIC overwhelmed and cheapened this poorly executed pasta.  The pasta al ragu also disappointed: the meat ragu to maccheroncini ratio was stingy and more aptly described as a sprinkling of ground lamb on plain pasta.  Finally, both pastas were undercooked by at least two minutes since they were uncomfortably crunchy.  I'm an average cook at best, but even I have made better tomato-basil and meat ragu pastas.  Finally, service -- maybe better summed up as ""what service?""  Let's put it this way: I only ordered one course followed by espresso and this meal lasted nearly two hours.  I don't enjoy pestering the server for basics, but that was a survival requirement at Porsena.In summary, it was a nice touch seeing Chef Jenkins greeting diners during dinner, but I'd suggest that she quit her dillydallying and hightail it back to the kitchen.  Porsena, you're better than this aren't you?  I thought you were related to Porchetta!  Chef Jenkins, are you really ready for a sit-down restaurant?",5,2,3,D L.,"New York, NY",178,98,1

The food was great.  I felt like I was at home when I was eating at Porsena.  Great atmosphere, friendly waiters and great food.  Started off by getting the baby octopus.  So tender and juicy.  Was a fantastic appetizer.  Then I decided to go with the Lasagna.  It was great.  Cheese was perfect and it was just great. No other words to really describe it.  Then I decided to get the porkchop.  The meat was so tender and juicy.  It just melted in my mouth.  My friend got the short rib.   It was so juicy and tender.  It literally felt like it melted in your mouth.  I'm a typical guy. I like to eat fast, and eat a lot.  But when you can appreciate meat by letting it slowly dissolve in your mouth, you know you got a winner.  I noticed I said juicy and tender about 5 times. Either my vocabulary is limited or it was really juicy and tender.  I say both. Great restaurant. Highly recommend! Thanks Porsena!",6,4,4,Dave K.,"Chicago, IL",269,181,508
