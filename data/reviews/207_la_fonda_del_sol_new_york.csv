5.0,3/21/2019,"Okay el pulpo was so yummy and tender omg. I mean baby baby baby wow. I wish I was chewing it right now. Flavor busting right out of that tentacle. I also had their mango-chile flavored margarita.... the guacamole & empanadas are good options for my vegetarians. Crispy, flaky, savory. Croquettes were a little cheesy but I love that! Not for everyone though. What else did I enjoy? Ohhh yeah, service was sweet. I actually sat in the dining room first and asked to move to the tapas lounge. I felt like an asshole, but they were so gracious. Just melted my heart. I was there celebrating a pretty great achievement and they sent over champagne...I mean it's the works here! I didn't feel overwhelmed by staff or anything. Perfection. Even the dessert...wowweewow. Bunuelos? Please call me Bunuelita because I didn't know I needed cinnamon fritters in my life until dining here. I'm definitely going back. How could I not??",0,0,0,Cid N.,"New York, NY",698,6,0
4.0,12/21/2018,"The food is good and the atmosphere is nice - if the service was also great this would be five stars.Came for a business lunch on the recommendation on the team with which I was meeting.  This is a regular haunt for them so no surprise that it was good. I had the suckling pig (very tender, cooked perfectly) and we split the octopus appetizer (a little tough for galecian octopus but still good). If you're coming for a 2 hour relaxed lunch, this is a great place.  If you're on a schedule though, you're going to be late if you come here.",3,1,0,Al W.,"Brooklyn, NY",312,138,76

I was for dinner with my friends tonight and we hade some tapas such as lam coca which was nice and crispy,, as well tuna tacos.

4.0,11/29/2018,"I came here after work to grab a bite with a co-worker. Good service; we had an attentive waiter who was quick to resolve when my friend's ribe eye was served a little too rare for her liking. She has ordered it done medium well..even the manager got involved to ensure we got the best service. Steak was well seasoned served with pico de Gallo, jalapeños and potatoes. It can be a good serving for two hungry people or three not super hungry people. They have good drinks; I got a white peach margarita and spinach and cheese empanadas. Overall its worth the money.

2.0,9/30/2018,"Damm, shrimp and garlic appetizer comes with 3 shrimp?  LOL. I've been eating that dish in Newark for years and you probably get 20 shrimp on average. 3 shrimp is comical at best. Rest of the food was OK but I won't be back. 100s of better choices in the NYC area for the same food. I hope we don't fall into another recession soon. They may have to limit it to 2 or maybe even 1 shrimp.",0,0,0,Mike H.,"Paterson, NJ",0,133,0
3.0,9/26/2018,"This place is solidly good. So in actuality this is a 3.5 star review. I ordered the guac and chips which were good, not the best guac I've had but good, I also got the pulpo (Octopus) INCREDIBLE. The empanadas were not good at all. And the bravas were the most basic bravas I've had. The desserts were good, you have to try the fried donuts. The service was weird. The gentleman who was serving us was nice, but kept clearing our table before we had a chance to finish our food. Like he didn't know how to properly read his table, and wouldn't even ask, would just grab things. More than once I had to tell him we weren't finished.

4.0,8/9/2018,Once again I am soooo happy its NYC Restaurant Week. Dined at La Fonda Del Sol and had a very good meal.  The downside....the lunch menu for restaurant week does not come with dessert (bummer).  The upside.....the appetizer and entree was so good and so filling that I didn't have room for dessert.I started with the chicken empanadas with the aioli sauce.  They were delicious - no other word can describe them.  For entree I had the grilled skirt steak with potatoes.  The steak was cooked to my liking (so many restaurants cannot cook a steak medium).  The potatoes were fried to perfection and came with a spicy aioli sauce.There are two areas to the restaurant - the downstairs causal area and the upstairs formal area.  I would have preferred the casual area but we weren't able to get a table there.  The formal area is nice but the service is a little slow but good.  Nonetheless it was a wonderful lunch at a very nice restaurant that I'm glad I found.,1,0,0,Kim O.,"Yonkers, NY",67,190,2
4.0,8/6/2018,"I've dined at La Fonda del Sol a few times for lunch and dinner and the food and service has always been exceptional. Although it's supposedly a Spanish Restaurant, it's menu isn't exactly traditional Spanish cuisine. While they offer some traditional Spanish tapas and entrees such as paella and jamon iberico, there are also South/Central American dishes as well, like tacos and empanadas. Either way everything is delicious. The restaurant is beautiful and a wonderful fine dining option in the Grand Central area that is also great for groups and business lunches or dinners or after work cocktails.",1,0,0,Karine R.,"New York, NY",5,52,0
4.0,7/28/2018,"I really like this place for tapas.  I have been a few times.  Food and drinks are reasonably priced.  I went yesterday for lunch and ordered from the restaurant week menu.  They had a nice selection to choose from.  We both had the chicken empanadas for course 1.  I had the hanger steak with potatoes brava and my friend had the salmon.  We were really pleased with our selections and the service was friendly, attentive and fast.  I give them a 4 because I have been going here for years and the decor has not changed, it seems dated and over used.",0,0,0,C G.,"Tarrytown, NY",0,22,2

3.0,6/26/2018,"I came here over a year ago after work and had a good experience. Today I Came here with a friend after work and We ordered 3 Tapas, the Meatballs (4 very small), Chicken Empanada (2) and Ham Croquettes (4 small with mostly a cheese filling). We shared them and had their Happy Hour Sangria $6 a glass.  We were still hungry and ordered a 4th tapas, the potatoes which had an odd spice on them and we both left hungry wishing we had picked a different place to eat. The tapas are not worth the price because they are small portions and not filling. The Sangria was very strong.  It was nice sitting outside & our wait staff was great but I'll never come back. Not worth the price for food that leaves you starving when you leave. We should have gone to Naples 45 instead. This was the worst $70 I ever spent and left hungry.",0,0,0,Sno N.,"Manhattan, NY",0,93,36

3.0,4/30/2018,"We had a very pleasant lunch at La Fonda Del Sol on Friday.The stylish dining space is two tiered- with a somewhat casual first floor with booths and high-tops and a huge bar. The second floor is much more formal, with white linen tablecloths.We were seated promptly by the front staff and directed to a high-top by the back wall next to the bar. Service was fine throughout our stay with no inordinate delays for ordering or food arrival or check receipt. Our lunch order included two Grilled Chicken Wraps served with cabbage slaw, tomato salsita, and roast garlic mojo on a warm flour tortilla with potato chips for $16, and a Steak Salad of mojo-rubbed steak, avocado, charred tomatoes, cucumbers, mint vinaigrette, and baby spinach for $19.My salad was a pretty good dish. It had four thick delicious steak slices and the spinach, tomatoes, and cucumber were all very fresh and tasted great. Quibbles? Well maybe the size of the salad itself could have been a little bigger, and maybe I should have ordered the mint vinaigrette on the side, because it was strong and whoever poured it had a heavy hand.New York City pricing brought our food bill to over $50 (we ordered from the lunch menu), which I guess is par for the course for what we had.",6,2,3,Dan R.,"Simsbury, CT",1775,2408,36884

3.0,2/23/2018,"Went here on a date.  Service was very good. Drinks were great. Food was good, but there was no dish that I would crave, recommend getting, or go back for.  The biggest deterrent is the price.  We got 6 super small apps and drinks for $200 plus tip.  At over $100 per person, I can think of several better ways to spend your money. Here is what we ate and I am listing them in order from favorite to least favorite.Octopus - Very good. Would order again.Patatas Bravas - Perfectly cooked home fries.  I would order again, but pretty expensive potatoes.Mahi Mahi Taco - Better than the Chicken Taco, nothing memorable.Crabmeat Stuffed Piquillo Peppers - Tasty but came with 2 peppers about the size of a quarter.  save your money.Chicken Taco - Don't waste your moneyShrimp Ceviche - Would not order again.",0,0,0,Fearless P.,"Manhattan, NY",1,71,35
1.0,2/1/2018,"Disappointing experience topped off with being overcharged. Went on Jan 30 for restaurant week.  Place is tastefully designed.  Server while polite needs more training.  Food was not spectacular.  When I asked the waiter what is in the Valencia rice (I don't eat pork or shellfish) His response was:what it says on the menu. Since I know how to read I was more than annoyed. I had to tell him that there was no description and he said it's rice.  No    S*it. Then he said it's plain Spanish rice.  The rice actually comes with peas and carrots.  He was not knowledgeable about the menu and was unable to make any reccomendations. I ordered the fava beans which were supposed to have lemon and mint. While the texture of the beans were good it probably would have been great if the were lemon and mint were included.  The chimichurri appetizer could have been better had there been ample chimichurri.  The ropa vieja and chicken entree were good.  Not good enough to warrant another visit but they were good.  As the restaurant was closing the servers were not subtle about wanting to leave.  Plates collected before fork hit the table,lights dimmed music was turned off....that sort of thing.  It was a party of 4 and 3 paid by card 1 in cash.  Checking the card statement the next day he double charged 1 person!!!! I guess that way he could keep the cash.  Of course the charge will be disputed and I will never patronize this establishment nor will I recommend it.",0,0,0,Cylantro S.,"New York, NY",2,38,0
5.0,1/31/2018,"I come to LFDS several times per year on business lunches - so my experience is with the CAFE (the front room w outdoors) not the reservations/fancy restaurant which is up 2 steps in the rear of the place. The food is fun, tasty and we have always had quality experiences with service (inside and outside). We love the croquettas, fish tacos, meatballs, etc as Tapas and my fave entree is the hangar steak with the roasted potatoes and secret orange dipping sauce.

2.0,1/10/2018,"I've come here twice for work lunches and hopefully will not be returning for a third. The first time was decent - we ordered two types of tacos and then everyone had their own entrees. The tacos were pretty flavorful and while I don't remember the dish I ordered, I seem to recall that I enjoyed it. My experience yesterday was not pleasurable in any way besides the company. Everyone had the business lunch, which comprised of a refresco/soft drink, soup/salad and entree. I already grew annoyed when they told me I could only order one of the multiple refrescos listed on the drink menu (tamarind), because they didn't have the ingredients needed for ANY of the other drinks. Why would you have a whole menu for these drinks if you can't make any of them? The tamarind drink was too sweet and not to my tasting, either way. My friend got an iced coffee that was clearly hot coffee poured over ice and said it was watery. For the entree, I ordered the salmon burger, which was a whole mess. I ate only the salmon inside, which seemed to be both overcooked and undercooked in different places, and overall had no flavor. Our table had two orders of patatas bravas as well, which were tasteless unless severely dunked in sauce. Definitely wouldn't come here again (and especially would not come here if I had to shell out on my own dime).",6,3,2,Elaine Z.,"New York, NY",495,291,132
5.0,11/4/2017,"I eat here all the time and I've never had a bad meal. One time they were slow with their service and comped our meal. I mean they really look out for their customers. They even introduced a tequila company from a local businessman into their bar. They really are a neighborhood gem. So they have the main dining room and the bar area. The main dining room has carpet flooring, dim lighting, padded chairs and all the compliments of fine dining. The main floor is for those seeking a more casual experience; the floor is brighter and more bustling. There's usually a crowded bar but it usually simmers quickly. The bartenders usually know what their regulars want and even take care of the newbies just as quickly.  The hospitality at the bar is amazing - Nina is my go to girl. I always tell her make me something and she never fails. Sometimes if I have a busy day I'll call ahead and she'll make sure my food is waiting when I get there. They had a really great summer promo for an express lunch - either soup or salad with a burger, fries and a soda for $19 but the lunch menu now has more options available and new specials. It's definitely a good eat from the tacos, burgers, goat cheese montadino, the salmon, the hangar steak, the angus burger, the salmon burger, the empanadas, the guacamole , the margaritas, the sangria, the chicken entree....i can go on but you get the drift.",1,0,1,Laquana B.,"Brooklyn, NY",523,48,153

For my meal I ordered the ropa vieja- it was a bit too salty and it didn't mention that there were beans which bummed me out because they were a large portion of the meal.

2.0,2/9/2017,"Food was overpriced and decent at best.  Service was spotty - the girl who took our wine order was fantastic and offered a better bottle than the one we ordered for the same price because it was out.  Unfortunately, our main server was constantly distracted, he seemed really inexperienced, and the general feeling was that he was trying to up-sell us the whole night.  We went during restaurant week but tried the paella with lobster off the regular menu.  The paella was salty and sandy from the shellfish and the lobster came with an additional charge similar to the cost of the paella itself.  The additional lobster, which our waiter had described as a ""really big portion"" actually looked like a single piece of langostino cut in half.  Throughout the night, we had to flag our waiter down multiple times for run-of-the-mill asks--including water.  Unclear whether this was on someone else to handle, but it was consistent with our general experience.  When a late comer came to the table, one of us actually had to get up and serve him wine ourselves since our waiter had been MIA.  When it came time to top people off, our waiter took the liberty of filling the glasses of two people at the end, rather than everyone gradually, and then informing me I needed to order another bottle bc we were out.  Instead of ordering another bottle, I asked whether the restaurant serves the wine we were having by the glass and after inquiring about it, he said no; I said that's fine, I'm okay with water.  Fifteen minutes later, as the meal is nearly finished, he comes over with a glass and all but said, you're welcome.  Bad form: in addition to being done with my meal I had no idea how much this wine runs by the glass bc there was no opportunity to ask.Save your $100 and change on a great meal and experience somewhere else.",0,0,0,Irene K.,"Manhattan, NY",5,2,0

My friend had the empanadas and I had this cold shrimp thing for appetizers. For the main course, we both ordered the hanger steak, and for dessert, we ordered churros and a fruit tart.

Example #1: I was away from the table when my entree arrived, and it was apparently whisked back to the kitchen to keep it warm when the server realized. Thirty seconds after I sat back down, it was in front of me, in perfect shape. Example #2: I had an unpretentious, honest, unrushed conversation with the wine captain, resulting in some fantastic picks. Example #3: Glasses were filled but not overfilled (the latter being a pet peeve of mine), and at perfect intervals. Example #4: The servers were extremely conscious of not interrupting the active conversations we were having. This, in my experience, is extremely rare in all but the most expensive restaurants--and maybe not even there!. Nice job, guys!",0,0,0,Craig W.,"San Antonio, TX",1,6,0
4.0,11/8/2016,"Sometimes when you sit down to write a YELP review,  you realize that longevity says it all - especially in the Big Apple.  The restaurant business is so difficult and such a precarious enterprise, that it's a wonder any place survives more than a month.  So many things can go wrong. But they don't at La Fonda del Sol ( The Inn of the Sun.)When I told friends that I had a reservation there, the most common response was, ""That place is still there?!""  Yes it is, and going strong from everything I could see. It was packed on a Thursday night,  It opened in 1960 and shows no signs of ""aging out."" The food is excellent; the service first rate.  You can choose from prix fixe, tapas, or the full menu, so you are likely to find something you'll enjoy.  I can't account for the poor reviews I read on YELP.

Ignorance?  In the heart of sophisticated NYC?  The chefs need to be educated in Barcelona or Mexico!

4.0,6/3/2016,"This review is for the tapas bar as I've never eaten in the restaurant section. I've sat in the tapas bar several times over the past few years since the location near Grand Central makes this a convenient place for me to meet up with friends after work.  The food is tasty - the croquettes and empanadas are my favorites. For drinks, I prefer their margaritas to sangria. Unless you're prepared to spend money, though, don't go super hungry.  Portions are tapas size, enough for a bite or two per person if you share. Best way to order is to try a few dishes for the table and share so everyone gets to try a little bit of everything.",2,1,0,Lauren D.,"Bronxville, NY",25,112,323
3.0,5/5/2016,"Ok, I'm a big fan of the food at LFDS.  Great tapas and drinks.  But their service has no game whatsoever.   We walked in after work with a party of 3 and asked for a table in the bar area which we have done on prior occasions.  They told us there were no tables of 4 and they weren't allowed to reconfigure the tables so they couldn't accomodate us in the bar area despite the fact that there were plenty of tables for two that were empty.  Since the tables are very light and rectangular, it would take no effort to reconfigure.  But they were insistent.  They offered us a table upstairs in the dining area which we weren't thrilled with since we were not staying for dinner.  They were prepared to have 3 covers walk out the door rather than reconfigure two tables for two.  This is poor training by management plain and simple but wait it gets worse.  We agreed to take a table in the dining area and made it very clear we wanted tapas and drinks and not dinner.  After being seated we were given a dinner menu.  We had to specifically ask for the cocktail and tapas menu.  They gave us one cocktail menu to share among the three of us and a 1-panel tapas menu with a handful of selections.  Since we were here before, we know that the tapas menu is a 3-panel menu with about two dozen choices.  We asked if they had made a change to the tapas menu since our last visit.  That's when they offered the REAL tapas menu.  Why were they hiding that menu.  WHY IS IT SO HARD TO GET A COCKTAIL AND TAPAS????????????  After we ordered, it took forever to get our cocktails.  The tapas came out much quicker than the drinks and were excellent.  Our waiter never checked on us and it took begging and pleading to order a second round of drinks.  Go for the food but have patience OR do what I plan to do.  Find a new after work tapas place.",1,1,0,Dino K.,"Stamford, CT",0,7,1

4.0,3/28/2016,"Beautiful restaurant serving good tapas with excellent hospitality.I was not dressed properly for sure because I was surprised after work, wearing jeans and a work sweater, but they made me feel at ease and comfortable.My boyfriend and I had the fixed courses and an octopus to share. The courses were all pretty good, and our favorite dish was the scallops for appetizer. Nothing really stood out except for my boyfriend loved the different types of bread for some reason.Our octopus however, was overcooked. Not over cooked as in chewy, but borderline to mushy. Cardinal sin of cooking octopus! It was tender when you bit in, but as you chewed it was not a pleasant feeling in the mouth. So starting off with 5 stars, the restaurant was beautiful and service was swift and courteous. Dock 1/2 star for price and 1/2 star for food not standing out, and 1 whole star for mushy octopus.

4.0,9/17/2015,"I come here from time to time and felt it was time to write my review... For starters, I ordered the Mango-Chile Margarita and thought it was well prepared.  I found it pretty clever that they infuse chiles in this drink as the liquor flavor is heightened by this ingredient so I wasn't left feeling like I was duped of alcohol. We had about 7 tapas (only photographed a few) because they are super tiny so don't come here on an empty stomach otherwise your bill will leave you in tears. Of all the tapas, my favs were the tuna tacos and the shrimp flatbread. The tomato bread had an odd flavor so I had to pass on it... Since they use the beefsteak tomatoes they lack the tangy taste of tomatoes on a vine. The chicken on skewers was ok... Warning: this tapas is served with bacon wrapped around the 2nd piece of chicken on the skewer. For dessert, we ordered the Cinnamon fritters (highly recommended by our waiter Raymond... Thanks Ray!). Similar to churros, they are fried dough balls dipped in cinnamon and served with 3 dipping sides (a cocoa-flavored chocolate, passion fruit and Carmel sea salt). The fritters were light and soft and were pretty good with the sauces (my fav was the passion fruit and Carmel). I ordered the Carajillo, an expresso served with Brandy and it was very, very, very strong.... I now understand why it's called Carajillo.  Don't think I will order it in the future because I wasn't really able to enjoy it.

5.0,4/24/2015,"This place was awesome. Made reservations for a friday evening & was seated rite away in the dining room towards the back. Front area was bar and bar seating which i guess is first come, first serve. It was quite large actually for a non-reserved space. They have outdoor seating waiting for the corresponding permanent (v. Fleeting) warm weather.Started with a red sangria, which was perfect. Not super sweet or overtaken by fruit pieces. Ask for tapas menu if tapas is what u want, otherwise they start you off with prix-fixe/ a la carte menu. We ordered: grilled shrimp, ceviche (scallops, not ur Peruvian ceviche), chicken empanadas & patatas brava. The shrimps were cooked in great light garlic sauce. Love love. The ceviche tasted good but it didnt blow me away. I liked the cilantro flavor. The empanadas the same. Loved the patatas and the dipping sauce. I know, its just potatoes but they were cooked so well and the sauce! So good. I must say, none of the dishes felt heavy or greasy or unhealthy. Next time id like to try the croquettes and the red peppers tapas. And possibly the calamari. And definitely the tamarind & chile margarita. Then we got both the bunuelos and the crema catalana for dessert. Crema catalana is like spanish creme brulee with small churro on top. Not bad by any means but wasnt thrilled. Now...the bunuelos...with the 3 dipping sauces...the passion fruit sauce was my favorite! They look heavy and big but its actually very light & ""airy"" & (most importantly) not guilt-trip inducing. I could have had another 4 bunuelos...followed by another quad. Service was on point. Our waiter was nothing but smiles & gratitude. Our busboys were equally as friendly & provided great service & attention to detail.  Butter was served fresh and room temperature so we didnt have to scrape it off to put on our bread. And the bread was delicious. I enjoyed the olive (spanish olive) mini baguette. Soft inside, crunchy outside. Location is convenient.

5.0,3/8/2015,"i was surprised to have liked this place so much, especially considering the rest of the reviews and ratings. i came here with girlfriends on a friday during restaurant week. we had a reservation for 615pm and were seated right away in the upstairs dining area. our waiter was really attentive and very friendly. he was able to recommend a white wine to my tasting for the night which was a crisp and buttery chardonnay. YUM! for apps, i tried the clam chowder and the shrimp arroz. both were great! i loved the little kick of spice in the chowder and the shrimp arroz was deliciously creamy with a definite seafood flavor. for the entree, i got the grilled salmon which was cook medium rare (to the chef's suggestion). it was cook perfectly! the roasted carrots were yummy with still some bite to it. and i couldnt get enough of the fennel puree too. that was rich and nutty. and finally for the dessert, i ordered the mango bread pudding. the mango flavor was subtle and surprisingly light considering the density of most bread puddings. the crema catalan was FANTASTIC and the banuelos were fried donuts of love. overall, the dinner was an excellent experience and im hoping it wasnt a fluke!!",3,0,0,Katrina B.,"Manhattan, NY",37,85,76

The servers are attentive as well as the manager. I didn't like one of my tapas and I wasn't going to say anything. However, the manager noticed I didn't touch it and I explained to him that I wasn't a fan of the flavor profile. The chef then sent out a plate of Spanish cured ham and bread. This was delicious! I appreciated that they went the extra mile. At the end of the day, this place has the potential to be great but the food just isn't that good. The ratio of hits and misses is to big for me to come back and dine on their tapas. The mango bread pudding and sorbet is their saving grace.

We have a reservation at 6:15pm through OpenTable and was seated right away at the upstairs dining area. Our original server Ana had a great personality interacting with us since it was our first time dining at La Fonda del Sol. She was grabbing our attention when she was describing the desserts...oh boy, oh boy *drools*! It was Ash Wednesday so my friend couldn't have meat and there were plenty of seafood dishes on the Restaurant Week Dinner Menu. Ana also gave us a brochure of the restaurants participating Restaurant Week and suggested Raymi for another restaurant that we should try with the same flavor profile. Man, our palate were bouncing off the walls with these delicious flavor profiles made by Executive Chef Eric Basulto...you ROCK! Sadly we departed with Ana because her shift was over and her colleague Juan took over but he didn't have the charisma engaging personality like Ana did. Appetizers: Creamy Shrimp Arroz, bomba rice, avocado, oven dried tomato, micro cilantro (my friend's order)South American Clam Chowder, aji amarillo, fingerlings, fennel, seafood broth (my order)...after drinking this delicious soup, I told Ana to tell the chef that ""mama like"" =)Entrees: Roasted Atlantic Salmon, fennel puree, baby carrots, orange scented sofrito (my friend's order)...forgot what temperature was her SalmonGrilled Hanger Steak,sweet plantain, caribbean dirty rice, chimichurri - well done (my order)Desserts: Crema Catalana w/a churro (my friend's order)...Ana described it as being better than a crème brulee and she was indeed right...yummyyyyBuñuelos (my order)...it was good but I like my friend's order WAY BETTERDefinitely the best dining experience that me and my friend had and we left very heavenly pleased!Book your experience today nycgo.com/venues/la-fond…!",0,0,0,Anna H.,"Queens, NY",248,805,10791

Six small shrimp on a skewer on a puddle of bland squash. The shrimp did not taste or appear to be grilled. It was truly disappointing. One bite of the guava empanada was enough.

Wish there was more texture with the ingredients. - Guac: good; you cant really mess this up- Meatballs - very tender. The sauce was a little bland- Empanadas: ordered the beef and they were good, but probably my least favorite thing. Maybe becsuse they were baked and the dough was a little too hard for my liking. The sauce was amazing though!!- Carnitas taco - a nice sized portion and great for sharing. Theres also a pre-fixe dinner menu for $38 that is a great value. Come for the drinks though!!

2.0,10/22/2014,"The only thing memorable about the tapas lounge section of this place was the bill: $130 for 3 tapas plates + 5 alcoholic beverages for 2 people.  A bit on the high end when you consider that the tapas were lackluster: the Selection of Spanish Cured Chorizos offered a sampling of four sausages but it was difficult to ascertain the nuances in taste among them; the Spanish Octopus ""VBX"" was extremely soft to the point of melting in your mouth (possibly frozen and defrosted just for us?  Yum!), bland, and forgettable; and the Fig Montadito was not balanced properly: a huge chunk of hard bread smothered in goat cheese with very thinly sliced figs of which the orange honey and mint flavors were barely perceptible.  In addition, the wine list offers few choices by the glass. I ordered the under-impressive chardonnay while my friend had a watered down mango-jalapeno margarita. If you are in the area and are in need of a frosty one prior to hopping on a train at Grand Central, then perhaps stop in if you're that thirsty.  Grand Central offers additional dining options that I have not tried yet but would prefer to gamble on over stopping here again.",0,2,0,Christine G.,"Fort Lee, NJ",40,39,1

I walk by it all the time on the way to work, but decided to stop by for dinner one night with a friend.It's a decently fancy place with friendly and attentive wait service, but the food was mediocre and overpriced for what it was.What we ordered:- Duck taco special: okay dish, nothing special about this special- Octopus a la plancha: decent portion for an appetizer, but it lacked seasoning- Paella for two: they were out of lobster so we just went with the regular. The pan was filled to the brim, but it lacked the most essential part of any paella - socarrat. And, I mean there was none at all. It was basically boiled rice. Definitely overpriced. At least it was pretty.- Cinnamon fritters with a trio of dipping sauces: This was the best dish of the night. Fluffy fried dough, which serve as vessel for their rich sauces - salted caramel, passion fruit with pink peppercorn, and chocolate.Overall, nothing to write home about.

4.0,8/7/2014,"I've eaten at this location numerous times for lunch alone, as well as when meeting friends in the evening, as my office is just a few blocks away.  Today I had a visitor in town that I work with from Canada (Montréal), and she invited me to lunch, but needed a location close by, as she had a train to catch afterwards, so I took her here.  The last time I ate here I was disappointed by inconsistent and rather subpar food, but today I was treated to a great experience, with beautifully presented food that I've come to know this place for over the years.Let me first say that this is a high-end type of establishment, where quality and presentation matter over portion sizes.  The theme of the restaurant is to showcase Spanish cuisine from Spain with a bit of modern flare, which I think is done well and makes me feel as if I'm back in Europe again.  The portion sizes are perfectly normal, but ""small"" for the American customer who is not accustomed to fine dining.  The idea is to not stuff yourself on one dish, but to have the opportunity to try an array of dishes, so you should expect a European type of experience when dining here.  The chef changes the food menu regularly based on what is in season, and what sells well, so while a few items were familiar, the vast majority of the menu featured new items, which I like and don't like, because while I like the idea of experiencing something new and fresh when I visit, when I'm craving certain dishes and they are no longer on the menu, I am a bit disappointed. Nevertheless, I respect the need to change things up and to showcase seasonal ingredients.  It shows an ongoing sense of creativity, and desire to improve from a culinary standpoint.As for the food, we both decided to go with the Atlantic Salmon, which I have had numerous times before and recommended, but today's dish had been slightly tweaked.  This version has asparagus and oyster mushrooms.  The fava bean purée was the only ingredient outside of how the salmon was prepared (grilled) that had not been changed. The dish was beautifully presented as usual, and the ingredients were a great marriage with our Spanish Rosé.  Speaking of Rosé, our waiter recommended it to us based on our food selection. He informed us that they had overhauled their wine menu, which I was not aware of, but was glad that he mentioned.  The same choices existed that I was used to seeing, but the supplier is now different. The bottle of Brut Cava that I selected originally was far too dry from the Cava that they used to have, and my colleague noted that there was a strange aftertaste, which I noticed as well upon sampling it.  The waiter immediately agreed to let us sample something else, and we were both satisfied with the bottle of Rosé that he brought to the table.As for dessert, I chose the buñuelos (Spanish style donuts), which is a favorite of mine, and was not disappointed.  It is presented so nicely that my colleague decided to try it and loved it, and she usually does not eat dessert.  All and all, the experience was what I'm used to here and then some... Non-pretentious and friendly... In fact even friendlier and non-pretenious than I can ever recall.  On a few previous visits, I've sensed an air of snobbery, but that was addressed, at least for today's visit. I even chatted in Italian at one point with our waiter, as we found out that our lineage was both traced back to Sicily not too far from each other. My only hope is that going forward the food will remain consistent, as the chef changes here too often.  My one bad experience with my croquetas (croquettes) during a previous visit forced me to deduct a star.  When I'm spending $100+ on lunch (as I do when I eat here alone for lunch), I expect perfection, as it is clear that this place is trying to set the standards high.  Today's meal was actually 5 stars, especially because of the fact that for the two of us, the bill was just slightly more than what I'm used to spending alone, which is quite respectable, though I ate much less than I usually do, and we did not have any macchiato or espresso here afterwards.  The one thing that I am not wild about is their coffee here.  It leaves much to be desired, and I usually like a macchiato or an espresso after my meal, but sometimes I skip that here and get one elsewhere.",3,0,0,Vittorio B.,"Riverdale, NY",14,59,1

Our selections: the black bean w/ chorizo, the salad, the salmon & the steak entrees, the cinnamon fritters and the flan, double espresso and coffee, even the bread all had a fresh delicious special taste. I drank a nicely done straight up Marguerita, and my companion had rose wine to start but we also tried some sherries.

The jamon plate was $21 and had few slices on it, although each small little slice was very good. I would say the food overall is average. The ambiance, lighting, spacing, was perfect for a business lunch, but it might take a bit too long.",0,0,0,Ken W.,"New York, NY",66,228,107

3.0,11/5/2013,"The general reviews of this joint are mediocre, and my review is no exception (though I do give exceptional reviews)Location is nice right near Grand Central.  Walking in, the bar was crowded with the Wall St. types, or at least the wannabesWait staff nice and then the hostess announced our ""captain"" will be taking care of us - what the h@ll is that?  WhateverLet's get to the food - cause this is what it's all about - ordered a Diet coke...FLAT.  No carbonation.  Like they poured me a glass of water and squirted cola flavoring...like a flat can of RC Cola back in the day.  Fortunately for them, the replacement came quick and it was carbonated.  Definitely tap, bottle or can would have been nicer - the flavor is just more rich.Appetizers - had the octopus, ceviche and lobster bisque soup.  The winner was the octopus.  I don't think I saw one piece of crustacean in the soup and ceviche is ceviche to me.  Paella with lobster was the main dish of the evening, the highlight as you would say.  Mediocre at best - pork belly was too fatty - like they took the fattiest piece of pig ass and put it in, seafood medley was nice, but the biggest loser was the rice.  I had plenty of paella where the rice wasn't soggier than a hot dog bun during the Nathan's 4th of July hotdog eating contest.  It's like kobayashi was sitting next to me and was getting ready to pillage this meal.  There was enough water content in this rice to hydrate a parched camel in the desert.  Not a fanDesert was the donut thingies and flan.  The donut thingies were excellent - nice big fat pieces that I shoved in my mouth and swallowed.  The flan was decent - the donut thingies were the true star if the evening.  Me gustaPrice was what you'd expect for a restaurant near grand central.  Not really worth it.  Cheaper alternative: go to Chipotle for a burrito instead!  Listen to me!  I know what I'm talking about!",1,0,0,Albert Y.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",17,68,85

2.0,10/2/2013,"I so truly wanted to be blown away. New York magazines's critic's pick led us here and I believed our experience would be worthy. Disappointment. Beautiful modern decor. Large space. We spent $300+ for 4 people (included 6 drinks). We were salivating for the jamon iberico, but it tasted rancid. The patatas bravas, although perfect in concept and execution, I suspect, had been fried in old grease.  The old grease flavor clung to my tongue and they were also over salted  The hanger steak was a perfect size for me--not too big--perfectly cooked mid rare like I like but it tasted like it had been marinated too long and tasted stale.  The chimichurri tasted beaten up and muddy. I didn't get the bright fresh flavors of chimichurri that would have provided needed support to the steak. And where was the promised garlic?It seemed to me that the chef/cooks have mastered their techniques but whoever is in charge of supplies and prep are disconnected to the chef/cook. When deserts came around, we ordered artisanal cheese, the cinnamon fritters and orange flan. More disappointment--the cheese was sweating, which told me that the cheese plates had been sliced ahead of time and, I imagine, were stacked high in the kitchen waiting for delivery.   The manchego was pedestrian.  The blue cheese was pleasing but not spectacular or unusual. The orange flan was delicate and pleasing but was not imaginative or even homey--generic. Cocktails boring.  The cinnamon fritters were bland donuts.We asked the waiter to recommend a digestif with one of our desserts. He told us he'd take a recommendation from the in house sommelier about the accompaniment to the cheese plate. When he brought the drink, he never told us what was suggested.  And we just ticked in blithely. We think we got one of the Spanish sweet wines--in our view too heavy for the sweaty cheese. We observed what we thought was the exchange between the sommelier and our waiter about a suggestion and the sommelier seemed dismissive and unhelpful to the waiter. Sigh. The overwhelming sentiment of our party was stale, waay overpriced, pedestrian fare. It seemed to hew to my rule which is beautiful decor indicates shortcuts on food. There are disconnects between management, chefs, and wait staff. If they think it's not visible, they're fooling themselves. It is evident in the food and that's a mighty, mighty shame.  NY Mag's critic's choice is a bit tarnished for me but worse for La Fonda, we won't be returning. The one bright spot: the octopus appetizer/starter. Delicate, grilled, so tender I cut it with a fork--almost. Nicely seasoned. Just enough salt to bring out the subtle richness if the octopus and smokey flavor of the grill. But octopus was not brilliant enough to bring us back--ever again. Off our list. *Bye La Fonda.",0,2,1,Mary F.,"Murfreesboro, TN",60,142,222

2.0,7/26/2012,"I had dinner with a friend at La Fonda Del Sol last night for Restaurant Week. You get two tapas to start, two entree tapas and a dessert (a recession-sized version of it), and all for the price of $35. The ambience is unnecessarily noisy and rowdy and upbeat especially in the main ground floor dining hall, and this is baffling considering how sub par the service and the quality of the food here.  I just feel a disconnect with the happy smiling faces that I see at the ground floor bar atop my cozy perch on the second floor dining room. What are these patrons at the bar all smiling about? the food here is sad, the service is sad and akward, and I don't know why I ever agreed to waste my limited time restaurant week experience at this sub-par tapas joint! Yes, I have experienced better, and please don't bring a special date here or try to think you'll make a splash with your coworkers by introducing them to this place. Just another over hyped over priced grand central eatery. Our waitress disappeared for a good twenty minutes after our table was cleared and she looked confused when we finally flagged her down for the check, with the kind of look that said, ""i dont know why they're flailing their arms at me trying to get my attention."" Why do you think? we want to quickly pay for our meal and get the hell out of this place! The ladies restroom is another akward horrible experience. There are two stalls, and with the reflective floors you can see the person in the next stall doing their business. All their business. Whatever you do, keep your eyes locked straight forward and don't look down because you'll accidently catch a full clear-as-day reflection of your neighbor in the next stall. I was absolutely horrified. The faucet at the sink is also not properly aligned with the sink bowl so the water flows out onto the counter and all over your dress as you're leaning over to wash your hands. Please. Just please, do not come here or don't think to come back. I sure won't.",0,0,0,Grace Lee A.,"New York, NY",42,311,54
3.0,7/19/2012,"Lovely relaxed dinner here.  Had the chili mango margarita, which was a bit spicy as promised, and just what I was looking for.  We shared the restaurant week menu, and had the lobster gazpacho and trio of spanish hams.  From the RW menu:- Potatoes bravas - crisp potatoes with a chipotle-mayo-like sauce, yum!- Classic Ensaladilla - which was described as tuna ""confit"" with ""root vegetables"" - uh, this was basically a potato salad with a few specks of what tasted like overcooked tuna. The low-light of the meal.- Meatballs - tasty for sure, but unremarkable.- Paella - the rice had a really briney, mineral taste to it, but none of the savory richness you'd expect.  The sausage and chicken were oversalted and didn't complement the rice all too well. Very disappointing, considering how amazing paella can be.- Churros for dessert - these were big balls of fried dough that were underdone in the center and overly sugared.  Again, not pleasant. The gazpacho was amazing though, as were the trio of Spanish hams, which came with pa amb tomaquet.  But the RW menu was very disappointing.  Service was attentive and ambience was nice, albeit a bit corporate.",0,0,0,Sasha H.,"New York, NY",33,575,0
4.0,7/17/2012,I went to this restaurant yesterday for Restaurant Week and it was delicious. First of all if you are looking for a more private scene or maybe a business lunch/dinner ask them to sit you on the top part and if you want a more relaxed ambience you can sit right when you get in. Now to the good stuff: Food! We literally ordered everything from the menu. The patatas bravas were amazing and the croquetas too. The chorizo was really good too. The paella was good but nothing crazy. And for the dessert the churros were just amazing!I will definitely recommend this place and will go again.,0,0,1,Fiorella V.,"Stamford, CT",0,7,0

My friend and I also shared the ""spicy"" potatoes and they were so delicious and crispy. They tasted much better than expected. The sauce wasn't actually spicy, but I have a high tolerance for spice, so perhaps others would consider it spicy. The white sangria is so delicious. It is perfect for a hot summer day.

4.0,6/15/2012,"La Fonda Del Sol is polished, pretty, and ideal for the business lunch or post work cocktail (and has prices to match the expense accounts.) Service is great, and the layout is smart - the front is open to the street, with a wide bar and cocktail tables. Its ideal for people watching, chatty conversation, and tapas. (I recommend the front for a nice first date.) The back is quiet, facing the wine room and overlooking the hustle and bustle of the bar. Its a bit dimmer, the plates are bigger, and more ideal for a special date or business conversation. Jon F. and I ordered:octopus a la planchatasting of hamslobster saladpotato bravasbraised beef short ribsside of spinach with raisins and nutsPortions are on the French side here, with small, carefully placed items plated on gigantic platters. Its easy to over order after seeing the first few plates come out. I enjoyed the lobster salad, with fresh naked claws paired with a salty and lemony greens and small dollops of cool cream. The octopus was perfectly tender and seasoned with paprika. The hams were delightfully subtle, rich, and smoky, and having multiple to sample were fun. The entree and sides were where things mellowed out. The short rib was boneless and solid but had too much of the fat rendered out, leading to a dry, shreddable beef that was flavorful, but poor on texture. The sauce and polenta redeemed it a little. The spinach and potatoes were nothing special. However, we were so full at this point, that having less stellar food at this point didn't rob the experience. Lastly, and I really really hate to point this out, our server was kind and well knowledgeable about the menu. He was prompt and responsive. But he had some major BO, to the point where I would hold my breath when he would walk by the table.

4.0,2/16/2012,"La Fonda Del Sol is an elegant establishment situated at the base of the Met Life building right next to Grand Central Station.  I've passed it a million times and always wondered about it.  When looking for a place to spend a nice Valentine's Day evening it seemed like the perfect place that wasn't over the top but not your every day eatery either.Divided between two floors, the ground floor is a bar/lounge area that is first come, first serve.  The second level, a few steps up and tucked into the back is the main dining area that takes reservations.  We wanted to experience the lounge area so we sat there instead of the main room.We arrived early after work so we were seated immediately and the hostess and waitress were super nice.  This may sound silly, but they actually smiled quite a bit and it didn't seem forced.  I've been to some places recently where a grunt would have been considered extraordinary.  They seemed genuinely interested in making the night a good one for us and it was much appreciated.Styled as a modern tapas bar, the menu here will make any foodie's mouth water.  It was a challenge limiting ourselves to a few select dishes.  Here's the rundown:TUNA TACOSThis dish comes with two ""tuna tacos"".  It's actually a lot more elegant than that.  Set on a taco crisp is a tuna ceviche with jalapeno and onions.  This wonderfully tasty combination is set on a bed of avocado puree.  Each one is worth about two (maybe three) bites but they are wonderful bites!PORK BELLY SLIDERSYes, you read that right.  The dish comes with two of these beauties.  A small slice of perfectly cooked pork belly (tender and juicy) on a small slider bun with bacon marmalade and pickles made for a wonderful combination of sweet, savory with a bit of kick.  I was worried there wouldn't be enough meat or the thing would fall apart too easily but neither was true.  I think me saying ""I could eat five more of these."" during the meal says it all.FLATBREADServed with romesco, smoked vegetables and goat cheese, this flatbread was huge, cut into six pieces and positively stacked with toppings.  The bread was crisp on the outside but chewy in the middle.  My girlfriend prefers a more crisp flatbread but this was my preferred consistency so your mileage will vary.  The vegetables were great and the cheese added some wonderful flavor.  SPANISH CURED MEATSThis plate offered up several types of meats including two types of ham, blood sausage and more.  What I enjoyed was the progression of flavors from one side of the plate to the other.  Some of the meats were relatively mild while others were spicier.  Having the range of flavors was great!My girlfriend ordered the sangria and I got their chili mango cocktail.  Both were fantastic in different ways.  The sangria was sweet with just the right amount of alcohol to make it interesting.  My cocktail was a great combination of spiciness and sweetness.  The two flavors worked together very well and they didn't water the drink down at all.You're definitely going to pay a pretty penny here, but it's a really nice experience with a lovely environment, great food and drink.",4,1,1,Benson Y.,"New York, NY",393,1298,917

The ideal ending to our meal was a Torta de Santiago membrillo, fromage blanc ice cream with a guava melmalate and the Buttermilk Panna Cotta which was so soft and creamy. A flan like consistency. -----After great conversation and food indulgence, we got the bill. It was totalled and under that was our due total, which was $0.00. We looked at each other in confusion... did he make a mistake? than at the bottom it read: THANKS (his name) and a SMILEY FACE... Come again. Wow thank you! So I looked that the waiter and said ""Really?"" He said: ""yes the manager fixed it for you..."" I couldn't believe it, so of course feeling weird about it, we left him a pretty good tip! As I walked out, I introduced myself to him and he said with an accent, ""Your face... it looks so familiar not sure from where but..."" I said thank you and told him I would be back....

5.0,7/14/2011,"I randomly chose La Fonde del Sol because I was meeting someone from out of town and wanted her hotel to be within walking distance. Three of us met for dinner around 6:15, and we wanted to get tapas in the bar (as opposed to going  into the dining room for the full menu). My first impression was that it was SUPER loud. Our waitress, who was a decent server overall, could barely hear us because of the noisy after work bar crowd. After about 45 minutes, that started dying down, and after an hour, the noise was at a perfectly reasonable level. I would recommend going after 7 if you're not going to the dining room.We started with cocktails. I had a mango chile margarita, which was fantastic. Fruity and sweet, with just a little spicy bite, and a decent pour  of tequila, as well as a salted rim. My boyfriend had something called Cava del Sol (cave of sun?) that had grapefruit vodka, rose cava, pomegranate and bitters. It was a little strong to my taste, but I'm not a big vodka fan, or rose for that matter.The best way to do tapas is to order a few dishes for the table, eat those, then order a few more, and so on and so forth, so you aren't overwhelmed all at once. We started with the tuna tacos, for which they appear to be famous, an artisan cheese plate, and the pork belly sliders, which was one of the tastiest things I've had in recent memory. Two words: BACON MARMALADE. Heaven. The tacos were also pretty fantastic, if you're a raw tuna person. They kinda fall apart as you eat them, but they're delicious.For our second round, we opted for the empanadas, which had chirizo and potato, the cerviche of the day, and potted duckling and pork. The empanadas were great (I'll eat anything with chirizo), but very, very small. The cerviche was made with a white fish that I'd never heard of, and, while the waitress told us honestly that the dish was pretty good, but she'd had better, it was everything I could want out of cerviche - light, refreshing, delicate, and not overly fishy. The potted duckling was almost like a pate with shredded pork on top, intended to be spread over bread. Absolutely delicious and very rich. I'm glad it was tapas; I probably couldn't have eaten a whole entree of it.We weren't originally planning on getting dessert, but a few items on the menu intrigued us, so we went for it. My boyfriend and I shared the ""Naked Goat"" Cheesecake, which was served in four bite-sized pieces with lime crust crumble over lime curd with blackberries and blackberry sorbet. The use of goat cheese made it a more savory cheesecake, which went well with the sour sweetness of the lime and blackberry. We also had a cocktail-inspired dessert sampler, which had a mini vanilla bourbon milkshake, a mini dark and stormy float, and margarita sorbet, which I would be willing to eat every hour, on the hour, for the rest of my life.Other than the noise, my experience at LFDS was ideal, and even the volume level calmed down eventually. We all left full and satisfied, and I immediately told other people how good the food was. I'm already planning on going back (although not too frequently, or I'd run myself into debt...).",0,0,0,Peggy N.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,44,0
5.0,7/13/2011,"I've dined here many times and have never written a review, but on 7/11, I attended a wine course hosted by Nick Nahigian. It was such a fun, informative class with generous pours of 6 six wines, and tapas pairings that were out of this world delicious - I couldn't hold out on writing a review any longer. I later found out that most of the tapas served throughout the course are also available on their regular menu, which is really exciting because I tried several tapas I wouldn't have ordered myself and sincerely enjoyed each one.Each time I've eaten here, I've had absolutely no complaints on the food or drinks - I usually opt for a fish entree, and it's always fresh and delicious.

I did enjoy the greens and buttery parma that was on the bread. The potato tortilla was good. The potatoes were tender with bits of zucchini in it. I think I expected it to be warm/ hot. It was served room temperature. The Chop Chop Salad was refreshing. It contained apples, cucumber, avocado(wish there was more of it), and bits of tasty chicken.

I recently made my first visit for a celebratory meal with coworkers, and while I enjoyed the experience, I certainly wasn't blown away with any aspect of it.I can say that the service was very nice, with the sommelier needing only a few adjectives about our preferences to recommend the perfect wines and the wait staff working efficiently to meet our every need.And the food was presented beautifully. It was all pretty good, but when spending $350 on lunch for four, I expect more. The tuna tacos (tapas) were a highlight, but the grilled halibut was so mild that it was almost flavorless. I enjoyed the side charred asparagus salad more than the fish. For dessert I had the assortment of ice creams, which were fine, but no better than any other ice creams out there.There are certainly better restaurants around, and while I wouldn't complain if someone invited me back to LFDS in the future, I wouldn't jump for joy either.",5,2,3,Jonathan N.,"New Orleans, LA",1470,258,53

Like others, had a variety of tapas incuding garlic shrimp, tuna tacos (only one that we liked), jumbo scallop, etc. I really wanted the paella but it was a bit expensive, priced at $34 per head.  The bread that they gave us were also hard as a rock and biting pieces of that was a work out itself.Oh - the sangria was delish.

From the moment I heard of the gorgeous, renovated space and innovative Latin menu, I yearned to dine there.  After sending my friend the menu, she was also intrigued, so we scheduled a time to meet.The restaurant was absolutely beautiful.  It had a modern bar space, a upscale and refined dining room, and even a casual patio.  While the tapas-style lounge menu sounded a bit more exciting, my friend and I were starving and wanted to check out the experience in the fine dining area.  The menu for this section was much more elaborate, but also substantially more expensive.  Our server was a bit slow and blaze, but beyond endearing and accommodating.   He started us off with some beverages  - a glass of white wine for my friend and a delicious Peartini for me.  This beverage was a sweet blend of ripe fruit flavor with its spiced pear vodka, elderflower liquor, and pear nectar.  We also delighted in a basket of doughy, delicious bread. At this point, we were pretty pleased with our experience, but we had yet to try the cuisine.  Our starter of Grilled Octopus was bland and rubbery.  In addition, the horrific plate only contained two tentacles for a steep $16.  My Wild Striped Bass with saffron, tomato, and calamari was sadly flavorless and unsatisfying.  My friend's Suckling Pig was topped with a rhubarb marmalade, oloroso sherry, and chives, but was still very bland.  The pork meat was also full of fat.  Lastly, we shared a side of Crispy Eggplant, which was tossed with tomato, raisins, and pine nuts.  This was a mediocre addition, but when a side dish outshines a main course, that is rarely a positive sign.Neither of us finished our meals, but we did ask for additional helpings of bread and even contemplated a second dinner elsewhere.  When our waiter questioned our nearly full plates, we had to explain that we were unimpressed, which I have never done before.  He seemed genuinely apologetic, but was also speechless.La Fonda del Sol might have a lovely atmosphere, but its tasteless food, meager portions, and sky-high prices ruin the entire experience.  I can now eagerly cross this restaurant off my list.  I guess there really is terrible food to be had in Manhattan...",1,0,1,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640

Anyway, the selection of Beer was not extensive, but quite diverse. I ordered a large glass Sixpoint sweet ale, which was very rich and delicious. For the appetizers, I got the spicy potatoes ""Bravas"" and the Pa Amb Tomàquet (bruschetta type dish).  Both were very fresh and tasty. The atmosphere was very fun, yet classy.

3.0,5/10/2010,"Forced to improvise at the last second on a Friday evening, after my family had to drop a reservation at an upscale Italian restaurant, I chose La Fonda del Sol's front room as a spot that was close to my place, could be entered at the drop of the hat, and served Spanish tapas. Well, pseudo-tapas. La Fonda del Sol may have a lot of history behind it, but the newest iteration has the very not-Spanish Josh DeChellis at the helm.Still, the online menu looked appetizing enough. I'm usually an authenticity whore where ethnic foods are concerned, but there are times when it's best to drop such pretenses, e.g., when you're in Midtown trying to eat tapas from a distinctly non-Iberian chef whose previous gig involved lightly deep-frying everything in the kitchen. (That would be the sorely missed BarFry.) I kept on blocking out the word ""tapas"" and repeating the phrase ""Spanish-inspired small plates"" as a talisman from elevated expectations.The place itself is literally a stone's throw from Grand Central Terminal, the front room proving an airy, jauntily decorated space. We were the only family there; the rest of the cafe and bar's seating was occupied with chic young professionals grabbing after-work drinks and perhaps a bite or three. Between that kind of crowd and the blaring music, it was more jumpin' than probably appropriate for my parents. We pressed on over the din, ordering a smattering of dishes from a menu sensibly organized into seafood, vegetable, and meat.As expected, when our small plates arrived, they were, a. hugely varying in terms of portion size, b. not particularly Spanish. Something of a mixed bag, but the dishes had their charms. Perfectly fried discs of eggplant were paired with a sweet pine nut concoction that brought the word ""chutney"" to mind: tasty. A take on patatas bravas was less Spain than Idaho, but it was generously portioned and again fried nicely -- I'm telling you, the man knows his way around a vat of oil -- with a searingly spicy aioli on the side. Albondiguillas meatballs reminded me more of Italian than any other romance language, but again, well-seasoned. ""Pa Amb Tomaquet"" was a pair of bruschetta-like bread discs topped with tomato; hard to go wrong there. And sea scallops a la plancha were so lushly cooked -- moist and light all at once -- that a nice bedding of salsa verde was entirely superfluous.Less successful was an octopus salad, mixed with potatoes in a muddle more fit for a potluck. A selection of Spanish cured meats was not too impressive either but for a particular sausage on the plate which melted decadently in the mouth. (My knowledge about this type of dish is lacking, but the famous charcuterie at Bar Boulud would benefit from a hit of that meatstuff.) A bowl of garlic shrimp was fine but unmemorable.All this was rather expensive for tapas, with most dishes hovering around $10. But if you too can block out the ""tapas"" meme, it becomes reasonable for Midtown dining. Not destination dining nor anything you would hustle out-of-towners to. But with the right kind of fellow revelers and wise menu management, possibly a good kickoff to a night on the town. Nothing wrong with that.Probability of return within 1 year: 30%",3,4,1,Lawrence C.,"New York, NY",82,215,0

4.0,4/3/2010,"We went last evening armed with the $100 gift card for Patina Restaurant Group which I got from my American Express Rewards program.   So the whole meal of 8 tapas and 4 drinks cost me $25.00 including the $18 tip.  We sat in the lounge area where the tapas are served and started ordering.  We first ordered a glass of chardonnay for my SO and a Stoli martini for me.  Both were excellent and the martini had the extra olives I requested.   We started with the marinated octopus...superb and fresh, the salt cod croquettes with romesco sauce...hot and tasty, the pam amb tomaquet, like a large crostini with tomato, sweet olive oil and sea salt and a potato tortilla which is a Spanish frittata made with eggs, potatoes and bacon..We segued into chili glazed chicken wings  and pulled pork sliders with smoked figs.  The chicken wings were perfectly done and delicious.  The pulled pork sliders were smoky and flavorful, not really a Spanish tapas item, but an interesting departure.The caboose of our grazing adventure was a portion of thinly sliced Iberian Serrano ham, cured for 18 months and a portion of Marcon almonds and Arbequina olives.  The almonds were sautéed in spices and some sugar and were delectable enough to consider dessert.  The olives were tiny and delish, floated in extra virgin olive oil. The Serrano ham was a religious experience,  Like prosciutto but less salty and the flavor kicked up a notch.  Don't go for tapas and miss this dish.All in all this was a fun, casual and tasty way to have 8 different dishes for dinner and the Brazilian Mojitos with Cachaca and pomegranate juice we had were a stunning after dinner cocktail.We went home sated and happy.",0,0,0,Robert C.

3.0,3/10/2010,"We had a birthday gift certificate, otherwise, the price tag to this restaurant definitely doesn't warrant the meals we had this afternoon.Situated on the ground level of the MetLife Building, of course the real estate fare is built into the meal prices as well.  Since it's a belated birthday meal, we wanted to do it the 'right' way, so we marched onto the dining floor (aka the elevated dining area).  So what are the advantages of dining on the second floor? Well, you can unlimited bread service (but not warmed up, boo), cushioned chair, dimmer atmosphere (aka no sunlight) and the opportunity to 'look down upon' the tapas people. So what are the cons? Well, again, you can't order off the tapas menus, more wallet drainage, and a deprivation of Vitamin D.So back to the food. The appetizer portion is definitely small. I ordered the blood orange salad and for $14, basically it's a 3...ok, 5 bites salad. It was not even artfully assembled.  Rather, the fish dishes are better presented, except for the salmon, which I saw neighboring diners ordered.  The filet was just too charred and overcooked from my naked eyes.  My dining companion  chose the cod.  Not too bad, but if you take your bloody good time with this dish, the sauce will eventually taste too salty towards the end.  But the cod was executed well and the clams, luckily, weren't sandy.  Finally, we went all the way and indulged in some cinnamon fritters.  Four pillowy balls of fried doughs stacked upon one another along with three dipping sauces (chocolate, peppercorn, and caramel).  My buddy thought of taking home two, but she failed.  They were quite light and not greasy at all and she favored the peppercorn dip the most.  She concluded the 1.5 hour lunch meal with a cup of lukewarm cappuccino.  Our waiter was friendly, though a bit scatterheaded.  I had to remind him to bring me lemon, bread, and also my cup of tea.  But he was probably overwhelmed.  This is a place for the corporate world apparently.  It's distinguished as a Spanish restaurant, but the dining area is more like fusion-Spanish-American to me.  PS remember to check for the drink prices.

In fact they are even separated as such (much like the Brady's split level) with the bar on the ground floor and the restaurant rising a few steps above the fray.And what a fray! I was a half an hour early for my dinner reservation so I killed time at the bar. The bartender, Dan, was amusing and attentive. The other patrons at the bar? Not so much. Executive types draping their coats over too few chairs, on which they never sit, so that a lady (yes, I consider myself a lady on some nights) cannot sit and sip her wine. I eventually asked one group to combine their coats onto one chair so that I may sit. The indignant looks I got spoke as loudly as the din in the bar (it's pretty loud in here). Thankfully the rest of my party arrived and I was able to wind my way through the very crowded bar area.And arrived in the far more spacious, brighter, and much quieter and calmer dining room area. Even the tables were larger so you weren't on top of your dining compatriots. Our group of four split 2 oz. of Iberian ham (delicious!), the tuna tacos, the scallops, and the prawns... just to start. And they are small servings, as so many have noted -- small, but delicious. I particularly liked the tacos as they came in a blue corn shell with an avocado crema; they are the cutest little tacos ever. Bucking the mainly seafood menu, I ordered the braised short rib which came with pomegranate seeds for a really nice contrast to the super tender meat. Also tried my compatriots' salmon and [other fish], the former I was wavering between. And because we just didn't have enough food, our table split the apple tart and the spicy chocolate cake (mmm spicy).I really liked the food here, most of the dishes had a good array of flavors, though you can certainly put a hurt on your bank account just by ordering appetizers/tapas. I think if you're looking for tapas, however, there are better bangs for your bucks throughout the city.

3.0,1/7/2010,"I debated between 2 and 3 stars for quite some time, but decided I'd be nice and put 3 after all.I came here with two colleagues (one a fellow Yelper even!) the day of Christmas Eve (does that even make sense?), having been here a few nights before for a company event where we had some pretty good stuff.We agreed that we'd played it pretty safe previously (garlic shrimp, chicken wings, not exactly hardcore tapas) and wanted to get some really neat stuff this time. We got octopus, braised short rib (yes, singular, I thought it was a typo but more on this below), patatas bravas, potatoes with chorizo, piquillo peppers, empanadas, and the duck-pork pate. Now, I don't eat pork, so I can only speak to the octopus (delicious), the patatas bravas (pretty good, I lived on these for 4 months in Barca so it is hard to impress me with those), piquillo peppers (stuffed with lobster, yummy), and the short rib (delicious and fantastic). Oh, and of course, the sangria. Yum.So why only 3 stars? OK, I know tapas are small portions. But this was ridiculous. The braised short rib? It's ONE little rib. I mean, come on, how can anyone really share that? The octopus had about 6 pieces and some chickpeas. The bravas were a decent portion, but it's freakin potatoes and if you skimp on those your restaurant should just burn down. The biggest portion was the piquillo peppers, which had 2 little peppers stuffed, but little nonetheless. Everything was delicious, but the portions were obscenely tiny. This was straight up ridiculous portioning, and it's almost insulting to think this stuff can be shared. It's not even enough for one person.The portions were so tiny that we then also ordered the cheese croquettes and the fried cod, both of which were larger portions and definitely delicious (I'd definitely stick to those over other options if you are hungry). Our waiter was fantastic, and helped us figure out what to get when we were still hungry (I think he knew the portions were way too small), so kudos on that.Overall, it is good but you definitely feel ripped off. I'd avoid it for an actual meal and head down for an after work drink and a snack, or just the sangria.

3.0,12/13/2009,"Last night I made an Open Table reservation, then searched through Grand Central for 15 mins to find La Fonda Del Sol. When I eventually  found the restaurant, I realized this was the place I had wanted to try for a while now because I was intrigued by the windows and decor (pictured).It is a nice looking restaurant from the open and modern front area to the more formal back area. They clearly spent time and money on decor. The carpeting, the tables, the chairs, the vaulted ceilings and the impressive wine area are modern and not your typical NYC space.  There's actually room between tables!I would imagine this is a good place for a business dinner (during the week) for the many businesses in the area. We however went on a Saturday night when it was not too crowded and felt a little ""subdued"" at times with a random crowd consisting of families with young kids and tourists.  All-in-all, we enjoyed the food and drinks. First, we received an amuse bouche, which is always a nice touch. It was a fried scallop in shell with a chiplote like mayo. It was a nice bite. Then we had Queso Ibérico Croquetas (cheese croquets), they were piping hot and it was ""fun to eat"" with the tangy cheese inside the crispy shell that was the right consistency and pop of flavor at each bite.  For dinner, we enjoyed the Atlantic Cod with tiny clams, parsley sauce, and smoked potato. The smoked potatoes were really flavorful and mixed well with the mild parsley sauce and fish. The fish was cooked perfectly - crispy on the outside, moist on the inside.  With that said, I am going to stop ordering dishes with just a few clams or mussels (at places that don't serve a high quantity of shellfish) because I got one of those ""rouge clams"" in my dish. We also had the Braised Shortrib of Beef with pomegranate, Rioja, celery leaf. It was sweet and the right consistency. All portions were generous.  We could have ordered more tapas and just shared one main dish but we decided we were not in the tapas mood.  We finished off the meal with some complimentary mini Christmas cookies, which was a nice touch. Service was slow but the waitress was very nice. I am giving it 3 stars overall though the food deserves 4.

Do not mistake their 'selection of spanish meats'  to be as filling and diverse as it sounds though; it's basically four rows of thinly sliced pieces of pepperoni, salami, and ham. 12 bucks for toppings I could have just plucked off a $2 slice of pizza? No comprendo, amigo. Sangria was average, but I'll toss on another star for the prompt, attentive service and vibrant decor. Left here totally starving with a significant deflation in my wallet and the sad realization that I could have ordered a 3-course meal from the dining room's actual Restaurant Week menu for cheaper than what I spent on these miniature servings.",1,1,1,Sarah L.,"Paramus, NJ",280,26,8
5.0,8/10/2009,"Awesome. Great food, good service, great ambience. Went for a casual lunch the other day and ordered a few tapas, some of their salads and two entrees. The ingredients are incredibly fresh and very tasty. Would definitely go back.",0,0,0,Nishant S.,"New York, NY",41,122,0
4.0,7/22/2009,"Opened in January 2009, La Fonda Del Sol is the next NYC offering in a series of recent revival restaurants which include the likes of Minetta Tavern, Monkey Bar and The Oak Room. The original La Fonda Del Sol, dating back to 1960, was housed in the former Time Life Building and today the adventurous Patina Group (Brasserie, The Sea Grill, Nick & Stef's) has resurrected this chic resto to a new 21st century glory as an unprecedented stage for modern Spanish cuisine nestled at the Met Life Building with a focus on tapas and reinventing traditional recipes. Designed by legendary architect extraordinaire Adam Tihany (Jean Georges, Per Se, Daniel, Sea Blue), this split-level masterpiece consists of a spacious yet casual café/bar on the ground floor and is designed solely to comfortably entertain the massive happy hour crowd that swarms this hot spot each day of the work week. The swank main dining room is lined with large banquettes hued by browns and burgundys and the signature Tihany metal ceiling rings. A state-of-the-art glass enclosed wine cooler houses about 1200 selections. The main dining room is situated on the upper level and is definitely the more formal dining experience. Both areas are posh yet modernist in a mid-century ""Mad Men"" sort of way, perfect backdrops for the modern ""take"" on regional Spanish treasures being served up nightly. Summer Restaurant Week 2009 features some excellent choices. I decided to throw in a few from the tapas menu as well making a five course lunch total. Before I was seated, I had a perfect Pisco Sour in the bar/lounge area which jumpstarted my palate. The kitchen is helmed under the eagle eyes of journeyman chef Josh DeChellis who entered The Culinary Institute of America in 1992. After graduation, he began his professional career as a chef de partie working at the Frenchtown Inn in New Jersey. DeChellis then landed a position in San Francisco as sous chef at Wolfgang Puck's famous Postrio. After three years, Puck sent DeChellis to France where he worked at two Michelin three-star restaurants: the famed L'Arpège and Lucas Carton. Back in the US, he worked with Rocco DiSpirito at the then New York Times three-star-rated Union Pacific and in recent years opened his own restaurant, the Japanese Sumile, which received critical acclaim including two New York Times stars in 2003. DeChellis followed this up with a modern American tempura bar in 2007, BarFry. The tapas dishes were presented first. My competent and courteous server Leslie brought out some savory olive mini loaves with house butter and dijon mustard by my request. I started with a market catch tuna taco tapas sampler accompanied by an avocado smear and jalapeño pickled onions. The taco shell was just right, soft enough to bite but firm enough so it wouldn't shatter into pieces. My second tapas offering was the octopus with potatoes, pimentón, and olive oil. The plate came to me smoldering with smoked paprika essence that made it a five senses experience. The octopus was sliced just a bit too thin to really savor its flavor, but still it was a solid dish. From the Restaurant Week three course menu I ordered the tomato gazpacho. The flavors were good, but the soup was slightly watered down which disappointed me. My main course was a triumph; Roasted chicken with chorizo and Spanish rice. The rice was expertly prepared and the juicy chicken lifted off the bone easily. The chorizo was cut into cozy bite size morsels and rounded out the plate with precision. I paired my entree with a great 2007 Verdejo, Paso a Paso, La Mancha from Spain which was crisp and delightful. For dessert the Tres Leche Cake with Cinnamon Whipped Cream and Strawberry Salad was ultra fresh and reminded me a bit of an Italian ricotta cheesecake. It made me smile all the way home. Lunch with wine, two extra tapas courses, tax and tip was $70.00.",1,0,0,The Jedi Foodi E.,"New York, NY",333,107,515
3.0,6/11/2009,went for lunch for tapasthe empanadas were good; the steak was very good; the patatas bravas were very good and salty;  The salad we had hadn't been washed so there was sand in it.  but I still managed to enjoy it.The tomato bread was SO good;  I've hated raw tomatoes for a long time and it on the spot converted me! now I can look forward to eating tomatoes all the time.Minus: Pepsi products.,0,0,0,pim l.,"Manchester, NH",2,27,0
5.0,5/6/2009,"What a screaming find!  There are two parts of La Fonda--a downstairs, loud, fun bar area with tapas and drinks, and an upstairs...by upstairs, it's three or four steps up and it's all connected in one big room, but it is still a lot quieter and more sedate upstairs, plus there is a dinner menu.  Where you want to sit depends on the conversation you want to have, I think.They have a great list of Spanish wines, and people who can help you figure out what is what on the list which is nice--Spanish wines are great, but the names are not as familiar.But the food...oh, wow.  Amazing.  I've been to a lot of great restaurants, and even at the best there is usually one dish where you say 'eh, that was just OK'.  In La Fonda, upstairs, 3 of us, every single dish I'd order again.  That will make it tough to explore the menu, won't it?  A sea scallop cerviche with sea urchin roe AS A COMPLIMENTARY AMUSE BOUCHE!  I mean, usually complimentary means a piece of toast with something on top.  Tuna tacos that melted in the mouth, and empanadas that, I think, sang to me on the plate before I ate them.  Oxtail soup, with these amazing croutons and cheese, which was like the best onion soup you could hope for.  Suckling pig, with crispy skin on the outside and moist, tender meat on the inside.  Oh, wow.Oh and the decor...pretty fun throwback theme.  Like I imagine the Pan Am First Class lounge looked like in 1965.Go!",2,0,1,Kirk F.,"San Jose, CA",36,442,4
3.0,4/19/2009,"Based on the fun tango music playing, I stopped in for a light dinner of tapas and alcohol.  The space is hip and fun, clean stylish ambiance, and very spacious, definitely a nice spot to stop for drinks with friends.  I had 4 tapas items, moderately shared, adding up to less than $25.  The drinks were neither cheap nor outrageous--a tasty standard mojito, fair sized, and an undersized unimpressive caipirinha (both for $9), although I guess the latter serves me right for ordering a brazilian cocktail in a spanish tapas place.  For the food, I tried to stick to standards.  First, the tortilla española, fine, but a bit bland, and so-so potato frittata doesn't quite cut it, plus the accompanying dense unexciting lemon mayo didn't help matters.  Second was patatas bravas, which were less than the fierce advertised--the potatoes themselves were very well fried, crisp and flavorful, but rather than coating them with the sauce, as is traditional, it was left on the side, though as it turns out that's not such a bad thing, since it was a rather ungainly emulsion with too much sherry and smoked pimentón, rather than the expected spiced tomato mayonnaise.  Still, it was pretty tasty, and practically a steal, with a sizable plate for only 4.50.  Next the pa amb tomàquet, essentially a tomato bruschetta, an admirably straight-forward genuine tapa (and downright cheap, at $3), but unfortunately the star ingredient, tomato, was flavorless, unripe, and unseasoned.  The toast and olive oil were good, so perhaps even this dish will shine in the right hands, once they get good tomatoes.  Last was a slight divergence from tradition, the pulled-pork sliders with smoked date and pickled fennel, and this was actually excellent, down to the fresh brioche bun.  I guess this goes to show that there is some talent in the kitchen, but not quite enough skill to make the unadorned basics really sing.  For the final tally, nothing was overpriced, nothing really objectionable (including the service, which was perfectly fine), and the atmosphere agreeable.  I wouldn't hesitate to stop in here again, but I also wouldn't go out of my way.",1,1,0,Scott P.,"New York, NY",10,19,0
4.0,4/17/2009,"I've been to La Fonda Del Sol a few times now.  The drinks from the bar are exceptional -- the mojitos, caiprinhas and sangria are all delcious.  When going out with friends, we always order off the tapas menu -- it can get very pricey very quickly.  Sitting at the bar might be a better alternative if you're looking to keep the bill down -- you can still order tapas and the like.  The tapas were great, don't get me wrong, but an overwhelming majority of them are fried.  I also didn't see some of my favorites (tortilla espanola, jamon serrano -- although they do have salchichon) on the menu.  Leave room for dessert -- the assortment of Spanish cheeses are incredible.  The chef did bring out complimentary brandy and dessert after dinner because my friend and I ordered so much food and I can't complain from a customer service standpoint.  Because of the proximity to Grand Central, it's a good restaurant for commuters to try.",1,1,1,Dana F.,"Queens, NY",665,925,146
5.0,2/19/2009,"Newly opened restaurant.  Valentine's Day.  Midtown East on weekend.   It was a daunting pick for a date; however, this place delivered.This combination tapas bar/restaurant is well worth the trip.  Even though the MetLife building is fairly empty on the weekends, the food packs a crowd for the tastebuds.  I ate in the upstairs restaurant vs the downstairs tapas bar.   Lucky for me, they offered a sampling of the tapas on the dinner menu.  We started with a couple of the tapas, which were fantastic.  Definitely give the manchego croquettes an order!  The albondiguillas (meatballs) also packed a big taste in a small bite.  I am definitely going to head back during the week to give the tapas bar a try, which I hear is quite the scene for the afterwork crowd.For the entree, we had the filet and the lamb loin.   Both perfectly cooked and full of flavor.  The filet comes with a nice trio of sauces/toppings, anchored by some great chili pepper salt. A very nice wine list, with some great Spanish choices.  Great food and wine, coupled with very attentive service, made for a great Valentine's Day.I never went to the original La Fonda, but I will definitely be back to the new one...if only to binge on more manchego croquettes.",0,0,0,Tom L.,"New York, NY",1,4,1
