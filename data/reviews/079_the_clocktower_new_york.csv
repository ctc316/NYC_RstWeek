5.0,4/27/2019,"Did not know what to expect, but definitely not disappointed! The duck breast was so tender and one of the best we've eaten. Had the tilefish which was moist and flaky.

2.0,4/22/2019,"I have never been so disappointed by every single dish at a restaurant, is it my bad ordering or The Clocktower just has terribly underwhelming food?! Thank your waitstaff for their impeccable service for the two stars. Hudson Valley Foie Gras and Chicken Liver Parfait (0/5) - for being the biggest fan of foie gras I barely touched this dish because it is SO SALTY, when we asked for bread it took 20 minutes for the kitchen to prep it.. by then I was over this dishEggs Benedict (1/5) - just look at the photo I uploaded, is this not the saddest/most pathetic/underwhelming plate of eggs Benedict you've ever seen?

5.0,4/9/2019,"The Clocktower is a perfect third date restaurant.  It's the private eating club that you're invited into tonight.  Get cozy with a drink in the plushy chairs while feeling like you're in someone's luxurious mansion.  This restaurant is on the second floor of the Edition Hotel on Madison Square Park.  It's gorgeous, has several rooms, including a pool table, and has pictures hung all throughout the vaulted ceiling rooms.  Even walking into the clock tower, you pass through the Edition lobby, with its Aspen fireplaces and fur throw blankets. The restaurant is based on a upscale British Tavern (if that tavern had gorgeously high ceilings and was well groomed). The food too is slightly English, including pigeon pie, fish and chips, and halibut.  However, you can find most classic light american dishes on there too, such as oysters,",0,0,0,Lexi E.,"Austin, TX",374,144,44

2.0,3/30/2019,Overall ambience is nice and the bar area is great but that's where it starts and ends. Had appetizers and entrees. Beef tartare was bland at best. The sliver of lamb priced at $46 was tough and not satisfying. The duck was ok. I was truly excited to try this place and then promptly disappointed.,0,0,0,Karim T.,"New York, NY",102,7,4

5.0,3/17/2019,"I really loved how low-key and old school the vibe was at Clocktower, and for a Michelin-starred restaurant the experience was blessedly down to earth.Our table only really shared two things: the Boston Lobster salad, and the 32 oz Dry Aged Ribeye ($160 or so). The Lobster salad was delicious, and quite fresh, if not particularly mind-blowing.The steak though--what a treat. Easily shared between 3-4 people (which makes it downright affordable in this city), it was simply one of the best cuts of meat I have had in a while, and came with (!) a drool-worthy bone marrow jus, fantastic potatoes au gratin, and a decadent green bean and truffle salad. I barely had any room for dessert, but we went for the Earl Grey soufflé and I'm glad we did. It was light, delicious, and a perfect way to end the meal.It was kind of weird to go in expecting a stuffy, Michelin-style experience and end up finding my new probably-favorite steakhouse in the city, but it was a pleasant surprise. I'll definitely be back to try some of their other entrees too, if I can convince myself to skip the steak. Easier said than done...",0,0,0,Aaron J.,"Boston, MA",118,78,44

3.0,3/15/2019,"The Clocktower is a classy place. A little too expensive for my taste. If I spend hundreds on food then I expect it to be perfect, and then some. And it's really not here. The only thing that was standout was thier homemade ice cream. They had a bunch of different flavors from orange blossom to chai, hazelnut and vanilla. They also had sorbet. The orange blossom was my favorite flavor, its very delicate and light and has a nice floral note at the end reminiscent of rose water. It's a perfect cleanser and end to a meal. Service was very friendly and polite (got more friendly when we started ordering more than just one entree and a couple of drinks). The atmoshpere was cozy and classy. They give complementary bread which is bonus points (that is delicious). I love a place that does that. We split the strip steak. Its enough to feed two I thought, even though the waiter was definitely not happy we didn't each order an entree. The steak was great and the side of cauliflower was great too. The side was just so small though. Then we got the earl grey souffle, the honey cake and ice cream. The honey cake was dry. The earl grey suffle was okay, it did have a strong earl grey flavor. The ice cream was great!The only reason I'm rating it 3 stars, and its a big one for me, is that I feel I can get the same food, just as good or better and more of it somewhere else. But I guess its expensive because its an iconic place and in a hotel. No matter what hotel restaraunts are always so expensive. Go here on a business dinner! Or if you have a gift card, like we did :)",1,1,1,Marisa M.,"Suffern, NY",230,111,259
2.0,3/13/2019,"I had been waiting for a long time to dine at The Clocktower; unfortunately, the experience was a disappointment. My fellow diner and I took four different dishes, two very good, two below par. The beef tartare was excellent, juicy, with an excellent and unusual dressing; the scallop too was delicious, served with lentils, cheddar and a duck coulis. The main dishes were disappointing. The preparation of the Dover Sole was sweetish, banal; the dish was very small and definitely not worth $50; the breast duck, on the other hand was huge, served as one big slab, with a coulis that was too citrusy and a minuscule ""confit leg tarte"". No proper accompaniment, partly our fault for not noticing the side dishes on the menu, but this was not brought to our attention by the waitress, as she should have done. Actually, the whole service was unsatisfactory. We waited forever for bread; when it appeared, it was piping hot, impossible to touch for five minutes with burning one's fingers. The sommelier appeared before we ordered our food: how could we choose a wine when we didn't yet know what we were going to eat?  Are patrons expected to pair the food with the wine rather than the other way round...? This said, the wine list was quite extensive. During the service, no waiter bothered to top up our glasses. Yes, the decor was attractive, but that is not enough to make for an enjoyable dining experience. One last, small but revealing thing: there were two metal coatracks next to the hostess's desk, where a proper closet would have been more appropriate for an allegedly four-star restaurant. We will not be back.",0,1,0,Alex L.,"New York, NY",31,58,0
5.0,3/11/2019,"My fiance and I are from the philly area and are big Stephen Starr fans so while we were visiting NYC we wanted to try one of his restaurants and had heard good things about the clocktower. We were not disappointed.We made reservations on the later side on a Saturday night so it wasn't overly crowded or loud- it was actually quite quiet considering the beautiful high ceilings in the main dining room. The overall atmosphere was cozy and moody with soft light that reminded me of being in an old, grand library. The service was exceptional throughout the meal. My fiance and I both tried a cocktail to start and then I switched to a glass of wine with dinner. All the beverages were great.We started with the scallops and the beef tartare. Both appetizers were delicious but the scallops were especially tasty and cooked perfectly. For dinner we decided to share the 40 day dry aged prime rib which was also delicious plus the sides were amazing too, especially the foie gras salad. my fiance, who likes potatoes more than me, thought the potato gratin was exceptional.

Prices are definitely steep but a good place to frequent for a social night out.

Can ask for a private spot when you reserve, and if you mention prior it's a birthday, receive a slice of cake with a candle with is sweet.

3.0,2/17/2019,This is the restaurant in The Edition Hotel.  The first morning we ate here it was okay. The pancakes were really good.  Just our food was cold... like the butter wouldn't melt (at all) in the oatmeal.  That's pretty cold.  The next morning it went from cold to worse.  They poured our coffee and didn't come back for TWENTY minutes with the cream.  It was kind of cold at that point.

5.0,2/6/2019,"What an amazing restaurant week lunch!!! The complimentary bread was so tasty and as soon as I cut into it it let out a huge puff of steam. I dunno how they did that but it was super effective, I was impressed. The monkfish was really tasty, super moist with a nicely sour sauce that made me want to keep eating. But it was the beet salad that I'm still thinking about a week later. The goat cheese was almost a foam, so light and creamy that it was almost like a mouthful of cool air. I have no idea what all the little dots and different beets were but it all combined into something fantastic. The thing that blew my mind though were the candies walnuts on them. I hate nuts, and yet these were so perfectly toasted that I was hobbling them up even without the salad! It was seriously the best beet salad I've ever heard, not to mention seriously beautiful",0,0,0,Ming L.,"Manhattan, NY",20,12,6

I went there for brunch so the choices were more limited.Food: English Breakfast (scrambled eggs, pork, sausage, bacon, pudding, mushroom)Skirt steak and chips (steak with fries and pink peppercorn sauce)The scrambled eggs were amazing (probably were one of the best I've had in my life). The toast that came along with it was way too hard and dry. I felt like the portion size of the steak was way too small for it to be that expensive. I ordered it medium rare but instead, it was medium well. The fries tasted like regular fries so no complaints there. The ""salad"" was whole pieces of lettuce...but the dressing was very subtle and not overwhelming.The service was mediocre, and it's actually not hard getting a reservation here.",2,1,2,Cherry J.,"New York, NY",359,34,91

The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful the entire evening.We ordered the Roasted Maine Scallops to share. The scallops were perfectly cooked and the broth was quite delicious. I ordered the duck and my friend ordered the pork chop, both which we enjoyed thoroughly. For dessert, we ordered the Earl Grey soufflé with cognac cream. It was very flavorful and fluffy.

Very fulfilling though so I dont reccomend if you expect to eat more. For the fourth i had the duck along with the Dover sole. You could smell the jus as it hit the duck. Lovely. The sole was phenomenal. Everything on that plate married together exquisitely. I would definitely recommend. Purple velvet pool table? Hell yeah!! Perfect for photos of a beautiful date.

5.0,1/5/2019,"I love this restaurant.  It was a last minute decision to make a reservation; I am glad I did. The hostess, who was lovely, sat us next to the fireplace and we could see the whole room.  The lunch was fabulous. We ordered the macaroni and cheese with the mushrooms and beef tips.  It's not your typical macaroni with cheddar, but with several white cheeses. It was very tasty and filling. Great idea to add the beef & mushrooms because it adds richness to the plate.  We then had the chicken which is breast white meat. That came with a chicken leg confit topped with a small amount of greens, and on the plate were Brussels that were artfully presented which looked like a flower. The Brussels were the best I have tasted, ever! The chicken was moist and delicious, but the little dish of leg  confit, I could have eaten on my own.  Gil was our waiter and he was very on point and had a very charming personality.  He helped us with our order, thank goodness. There were so many dishes I wanted I couldn't make up my mind. I am sorry I didn't order the fish & chips, but that makes me just have to return.

4.0,12/12/2018,"Main reason my wife and I wanted to check out The Clocktower is because after spending a few years in Philly, we became fans of the service level at Stephen Starr restaurants. Then we moved to California and there was no Stephen Starr to be found. Well, moving back east, we finally had the chance again, but in a new city! We chose The Clocktower first since it seemed to have the best reviews and the chef previously worked for Gordon Ramsay (my wife grew up in the UK so this is normal a selling point). The service definitely did not disappoint, and the food was amazing!For a starter, I had the Foie Gras And Chicken Liver Parfait (see photo)... it was delicious. For dinner, the venison... also delicious. All the food was amazing. The service did not disappoint... one of the small things I really appreciated was the communication among the service team. For example, we told the hostess we were excited to try this place and were fans of Stephen Starr restaurants. At the END of the meal... an hour or so later... our server commented to us he heard we have been wanting to try the restaurant.

Came here specifically for the soufflé this season was earl grey flavor, minus one star for the lateness of the soufflé even though I ordered it way ahead at the beginning of the meal. However they made it up and took the soufflé cost off as it took a full 40 mins before coming out as the first one apparently fell apart. The restrooms were super clean, service was good enough.

5.0,11/25/2018,"This restaurant really blew me away. I saw some negative reviews, which made me slightly hesitant but I personally had an amazing experience here.The hostesses are so friendly, will check your coat for you. The restaurant is set up and it is a large space, each room is slightly separate from the others. Service is amazing. Wine list super extensive. Great cocktails. Food: Ox mac and cheese: Wow. Absolutely amazing. For an app, it's a pretty big portion. It's not the standard pasta they use in traditional mac n cheese, the cheese is absolutely amazing and the ox meat is sooo tender do not miss out on this! Our server acutally brought this out with our entree, as she recommended it would go better with that.Apps: Foie gras with the duck prosciutto - comes with buttered white bread. The foie gras is absolutely decadent, you have to eat it with something to counter this crazy flavorful dish! Super good, and the thinly sliced prosciutto pieces are amazing as well.Burrata - my friend argues it isn't burrata because the inside should be more creamy, and it was more on the solid side. Loved the sauce that accompanied it, it had a citrus flavor to it. Entree: Venison - so good. How often are you going to find this kind of meat at a restaurant? I would highly recommend taking advantage of it here. So delicious. You are given around 4/5 slices of this meat. Absolutely amazing. It also comes with vegetables. Quality over quantity, definitely.Complimentary bread: Literally the best I have ever had at any restaurant. Homemade and the butter is delicious. Desserts: next time if I'm not about to hit a food coma, they have an apple tartin for 2. Otherwise, the other desserts are much smaller. We shared the mousse which was great. Their selection of teas is pretty fun, they're unique and all very high quality, many sourced from the UK. Great place, dark, intimate, great for all sorts of occasions.

I actually reported the turkey was undercooked to the staff and they said it was supposed to be that way. I was shocked by their response. (My friend threw up after she got home and i had an allergic reaction but the friend who got fish was fine.) The cornbread stuffing was literally just croutons, the mushrooms were severely dried out and the vegetables were pickled....who wants raw vegetables on thanksgiving? Anyone? No one. Also, nothing on our table was hot, not even warm.When the staff cleared our plates, two of them barely had dents in them, and no one asked if there was anything wrong w our meal.

It could be a slip of the mind but for the prices and what the restaurant is trying to present, it didn't seem acceptable. We finished our appetizers and he gave us the dessert menu before we received our main dish ( which was the duck for two). Again like he wanted us to leave. At that point the manager or someone got involved. When the duck was finally served, it was completely cold. We returned the food and left. I can't believe we had to pay for this meal thankfully they didn't put the cold duck on the bill. It was a terrible experience.

3.0,10/8/2018,"Clocktower is nestled in a cosy space above the lobby of the EDITION hotel across from Madison Square Park. Being a collaboration between the famed restaurateur Stephen Starr and British Chef Jason Atherton (enjoyed his Michelin starred Pollen Street Social in London) -- it's no ordinary hotel dining room. Given the talent backing The Clocktower, as well as its Michelin star, it seemed like a solid choice. Overall, though, while we found the menu to be well conceived, the dishes need more editing and finesse. Would love to give 4 stars to the very personable staff and cozy environment, but the food fell short of expectations at this level and our wine selection was served at an improper temperature, so rounding down to 3 stars.Atmosphere- Clubby enclave that really suits the concept, not staid/stuffy though.- Warm and inviting with several distinct rooms, dimmed lighting and classic British design elements.- Tables are nicely spaced for NYC.FoodEverything sounds great in concept, and to be sure the flavor profiles were all nice. Some dishes felt like they were missing components, while others could use a touch more refinement. Menu descriptions are elaborate and try overly hard to connote farm-to-table. The anticipation generated is fulfilled unevenly. Entrees were lackluster, while apps and desserts hit high notes. We had:-Hudson Valley Foie Gras And Chicken Liver Parfait (london stout, lentils, smoked duck - $19): Highlight dish - foie with lentils and stout very innovative pairings. Well done!-Long Island Tomatoes (sauternes and tomato gelée, shaved brooklyn burrata, olive biscuit, peppermint - $20): Tasty, but unexceptional, despite the enticing description.- Long Island Duck Breast (spiced peppercorn, grilled peach with Argan, pickled kohlrabi, five plum sauce - $ 39): Cooked to good temp, but wish fat was a bit further rendered. Served as one large piece of meat, without any accompaniment to add balance and interest.- Berkshire Pork Chop (beetroot soubise, white balsamic puffs, semi-dried chioggia beets, black pudding, charcuterie sauce - $37): Moist, with the white balsamic puffs lending a nice textural element. Favorite of our proteins.- Strawberries and Cream (vanilla custard, olive oil cake, red verjus sorbet -  $15): Loved it! Top caliber with nice nuance and great interplay of textures; sweet but not overwhelming.BeverageHaving had cocktails downstairs at The Lobby Bar (nice environment), went straight for wine. Upon seating, you will be presented a ""Champagne cart"" which seemed cool in concept (some may find it hokey). In general, wine list had good breath across regions and solid options in various price points, including sub $150. Somm suggested the 2013 Odoul-Coquard Aux Saint Jacques ($152), a very solid Nuits-Saint-Georges Burgundy - good recommendation. Sadly, it was served very close to room temperature, which is unexpected for this caliber of venue. Should we have made a comment? Probably, but hated to see a nice bottle go to waste and everyone was just too nice. It didn't kill the experience, but was disappointing.Service- Waitress very personable and attentive, delivered great service.- Somm did good job interacting, happy to discuss the wine list and perceptive to our tastes and budget.

Great way to start our anniversary dinner. Every bite of food we had was amazing. We had the chilled Boston lobster, steak tartare and fois gras for our appetizers and all were absolutely delicious. For dinner the duck and pork chop, typically I don't have a pork chop as my number one pick on a menu, but it was so tender and flavorful. For dessert we had the ice cream and sorbet selection.

The two appetizers we got had gelatin in it, which I get it, it is great to offer something different and mix different flavors, but I thought it was over used.We got (2 people):- Scottish Langoustine Tartare ($22): grapefruit gelée, avocado, finger lime, anise leaves. A shrimp tartare, without the egg yok and little grapefruit jello mixed in. Loved the taste, hated the texture. Made it seem like caviar from a far, but it wasn't - Marinated Yellowtail ($21): seaweed custard, bonito gelée, spring onion and ginger salad. Square pieces of marinated yellow tail on a base of - again - jello like base. This put me off.- Braised Atlantic Halibut ($44): salt baked baby carrots, dulse seaweed, yuzu, lobster, pink grapefruit. Really good tasty fish. The baby carrots abnd the grapefruit had a mild sweet taste that went very well with the fish. Lobster is just  a tiny bit, don't expect too much.- Long Island Duck Breast ($39): spiced peppercorn, grilled peach with Argan, pickled kohlrabi, five plum sauce.

And another 5 to present a clean knife and fork on a wooden tray. My friend had, of course, finished her chicken breast, the dining room was practically empty and it was 3:00 p.m.  And our captain who had been initially friendly, now realizing we were probably not going to be generous tippers was remarkably officious, plunking the bill down with a curt, ""Whenever you're ready.""  Granted it is restaurant week, not a time when restaurant food is at its best, but that's not an excuse for an inept wait-staff and an inattentive kitchen.  The food, certainly hotel-dining room quality-- even though that ox was ground up mystery meat  and the foie gras parfait served on a bed of lentils, was a peculiar melange, probably is adequate for the tourists paying top dollar to stay in a luxury Marriott and the regular menu prices are high enough to have that bespoken quality and the ghosts of all those MetLife employees who brown-bagged it for lunch are floating though these rooms wondering why people are paying so much to eat in an office.",0,0,0,Melanie R.,"New York, NY",11,42,0

The lobby is really something with the billiards table and bar while you wait for your friends or table. Food wise, we got the foie gras, sea urchin, duck breast, halibut, and chocolate dessert. The bread was quite nice, crusty on the outside and hot and fluffy on the inside.

And pushed all responsibilities to the sommelier, who was also someone we have to hunt for. This sounds funny but the tables are tiny, and can hardly fit our food. Because the chef loves to use gigantic presentation plate! So during the dinner, we spent a lot of time moving our plates around and try to be comfortable. And the server/busser didn't attempt to help at all. They just put everything on the table and leave us struggling on our own. Such a waste on the good food. Also, the manager was extremely arrogant, when we complained about the the service. He argued with us and act like he's smarter than his customers.

4.0,8/13/2018,"We came in for lunch for restaurant week that runs about $26 for a two course menu. Our server was great and the food was also very good. The bread they serve looks good, but was really tough. The butter was delicious but breaking through the tough, rubbery exterior of the bread made it tough to eat. Looking around, most people didn't even touch it. The foie gras parfait was nicely plated and came with a side of bread. The lentils added a nice texture to the creamy liver dish. It was also sort of sweet and nutty, with small prices or duck sprinkled around. The risotto with lobster reduction was very good but could have been a little warmer.The ox cheek and ale pie was delicious. It came with an oyster sauce they pour tableside and had a delicious dark sauce that encircles the pie. The crust was perfect, but again, I thought the food could have been warmer. The flavors were great, service was spectacular, but the timing at which the food came out could have been better. We saw them bring our entrees out right after our first courses made their way to the table so they turned around and brought it back in, which is probably why the food was more on the lukewarm side. Maybe a little miscommunication on the part of timing. But don't let that stop you from paying them a visit. The restaurant is up a set of spiral stairs.

When we asked her for the side of potatoes we ordered, she had an attitude about it and we ended up getting it after we ate our meal. I had specified my allergies and told her that I could not have banana but she failed to write that down so naturally she brought me granola with giant slices of banana. We had to constantly ask for our plates to be taken up, get refills or flag down another tables waitress to eat our order right. Since we were staying at the hotel attached to the restaurant, she didn't give us our check at the end and said it will be billed to the room. To our surprise, the check had items we didn't even order and the charge was much higher than what we calculated. Overall, the waitress left us with a  sour taste in our mouth. As far as food, there are no gluten free or vegan options other than avocado toast. They don't even have gluten free bread. I had to order oats with berries which was $20.

(also wasn't real truffles it was fake truffle oil)  My pork chop was very sweet and tasted very strongly of clove.  I don't like clove at all.  Also, wasn't mentioned on the menu.  That being said, vodka soda was dammed good.

I made a reservation online easily for 7:30 a few weeks in advance, but the restaurant didn't have many empty tables while we were there so I'd definitely plan ahead.Started off the night with the Royal Engagement and The Don for drinks, both of which were very sippable. The Don came with a side of chocolate candies to enjoy with the drink as well.As many other reviewers have noted, the complimentary bread and butter is amazing. You get an entire mini loaf of fresh baked bread (seriously, when we cracked it open it was still steaming) and salted, whipped butter. For food, we split a half dozen oysters, ox cheek mac and cheese, and the baked chicken for two. Everything was delicious (especially that mac and cheese). The chicken was prepared 3 ways - the white meat came plated with morels and some sort of puree, while the dark meat came in mini sliders and a separate pot with jus poured over it. So good! Not as good as the Nomad chicken, but still delicious.Dessert was the apple tarte tatin for two (the panna cotta from last time is no longer on the menu, thankfully), which was seriously one of the best desserts I've had. Nothing fancy about it, just a perfectly prepared apple tart with caramel sauce drizzled all over it, and I couldn't ask for more.Meal ended with complimentary almond financiers.

3.0,4/25/2018,"Had dinner here last weekend for F's birthday. I like the ambiance in here; dim and romantic. The high ceilings and the wall to wall gold framed images make quite a statement. We were told by the hostess that we only had until 9:15 until they had another party booked for the table. It's always annoying to hear this; I'm sure it's a necessary practice so that they can seat as many parties as possible in a night, but please keep that practice behind closed doors. In the end, there were plenty of tables open and we weren't asked to leave... but in the back of our minds, it was lingering there and we opted not to order extra drinks after we finished our bottle of wine. They started us off with a small glass of sparkling wine because they knew we were there to celebrate a birthday, which was very nice. We ordered the $125 seafood platter to start. It read like it would be huge and at that price point we thought it would be so we didn't order any additional appetizers... but it turned out to be very small. I'm sure I could've easily finished the whole platter myself. I ordered the pork chop. It was well cooked, but there was lots of fat - and in the dimness of the restaurant, you couldn't always see if it was meat or fat. I don't eat the fat on meats so whenever I got a bite of fat, I had to suppress the urge to spit it out (fancy place as it is). But others who love fat might like this; A joked that it sounds delicious. Friends ordered the duck, lamb and burger and all seemed to enjoy their dishes. F got the pistachio soufflé. This takes 20 minutes to make but it's worth the wait. It was light, fluffy and delicious. A and I shared the warm mango pudding. Texturally, I thought it was kinda weird and flavor wise, there was nothing special about it. F and J tried a bite each, but no one on the table liked the dish much. Most of it was left. The service isn't very warm or affable. It started out very friendly when we got the sparkling wine and waters... but we waited a while before a waiter came to take our order and even then, he only came by after we waved him over. (We had been told we had to leave by a certain time, so we wanted to make sure we can place our appetizer order early so we would have timers leisurely enjoy our entrées.) When he came by, he told us he would prefer if we ordered everything all together instead of just the appetizer cuz it would make things easier. Ok. Luckily, by the time he arrived to our table, we all knew what we wanted so it was fine. Overall, we had a solid 3 star experience.

Both of our steaks came with frites, but we opted to substitute one of the sides for the potato gratin-- I cannot recommend this enough! Creamy and garlicky, the gratin was my favorite part of the meal.The only reason The Clocktower gets four stars instead of five is the dessert- the apple tarte tartine for two was underwhelming.

3.0,2/9/2018,Nice menu at the Clocktower however service was poor this evening. There is also a lack of professionalism in the Kitchen the steaks were both seriously under cooked.  All of our dishes lacked seasoning a bit of salt and pepper would have helped a lot.   I do give credit to the floor manager for trying to help the poor servers and making up for the kitchens mistakes.  It's worth another try perhaps they'll fix the issues.io,0,0,0,Ivan K.,"Manhattan, NY",73,84,552

3.0,1/29/2018,"This year, the Clocktower was given its first Michelin star, so I decided to check it out. The space is absolutely gorgeous -- beautiful people, dark wood, a pool table, and chic architecture. We had a 2:15 reservation and were seated at 2:30. As it is still Restaurant Week, I decided to go with the  Restaurant Week Lunch menu for $29. The bread service is a delicious sourdough served warm so that when you rip it open, hot steam rises and melts the sea-salted butter right into the bread. My only critique of this is the fact that the bread itself is only slightly cut to indent where one should take a piece. The bread is not served with a knife so ripping oppen the crusty sourdough made quite the mess.I ordered the Kale, Sunchoke, and Salsify Salad with buttermilk and cider dressing as my first course. It was a nice portion, was well seasoned, and the dressing complimented the crispy sunchoke chips. We also ordered the Goat Cheese gnocchi with mushroom puree, black garlic, and lettuce sauce ($18). These gnocchis were light, pillowy, and just tasty. The lettuce sauce was poured table side and I enjoyed every bite. The goat cheese flavor was not prominent, so if your not a goat-cheese lover you would still enjoy these. If you are a goat cheese lover like myself, however, you will that a little more of that tang from goat cheese would have elevated this dish to a next level.For my entree I ordered the Roasted Atlantic Cod with braised baby leeks, hollandaise, and hazelnuts. The fish was succulent and very fresh and the leek was perfectly tender. The chive hollandaise was executed perfectly and had a wonderfully smooth moutful. The hazelnuts did not necessarily contribute to the dish and I wish they were salted a little more to bring out the mild flavors of the cod. The dessert here, however, is worth it's weight in gold. The Sweet Potato Pudding with chocolate sorbet and hazelnut crumble was topped with gold leaf and could have seriously brought me to tears. Think of the best sticky toffee pudding you've ever had with a crunchy-toffee like component from the hazelnut crunch, an earthy undertone from the sweet potato, and a bitter and velvety coldness from the high-quality dark chocolate sorbet. This dessert was utterly heavenly and I could have easily eaten 3 portions worth (please make your desserts bigger!!!). While I truly enjoyed my meal at the Clocktower, I just wanted to mention that their sodas are not free refills. I know you may chuckle that I even pointed this out, as the fine dining restaurant will cost so much to eat anyway but when the diner serves large portions of unlimited soda for $2, it is slightly disappointing when you have to pay $10 for two half-can portions of Diet Coke. Our meal was concluded with complimentary almond petit fours with a raspberry jelly which were a very nice bite. Overall, I enjoyed my dining experience at the Clocktower, but there are many other restaurants I would like to eat at before I'd return here.",0,0,0,Luciana C.,"Staten Island, Staten Island, NY",171,23,115
4.0,1/29/2018,"As a disclaimer, I came on a Sunday night, and the restaurant was fairly empty, so a lot of the issues that people had with service didn't really apply. Our (party of 3) waters were always filled, and the food came out at reasonable times.From the hotel lobby, you take a winding staircase up to the second floor, where the restaurant is actually located. The interior is dark-ish, with countless photographs lining the walls that gave off a very swanky, country-club type feeling. It was definitely unique, but I can't say for sure whether I was a fan or not.Bread service was good - the butter was served at a temperature where it bordered being solid and melting, which was a nice surprise.For entrees, we opted for the Long Island duck, the pork chop, and for the rack of lamb, of which I honestly think the pork was the best option. Lamb was tender but relatively flavorless, and the duck was overcooked and tougher than anticipated. Also as a heads up, if you're looking at the duck for the foie gras skewer, don't bother, because they really skimp out and give you this tiny little piece, and it was overall disappointing. Oh well. Still, the pork was really well-seasoned, there was a TON of meat, and the sauce/crust combo really did it for me. I didn't even mind the pumpkin, which I'm usually extremely averse to.For dessert, we got the apple tarte tatin for two and the warm mango pudding, both of which were pretty good. I wish they hadn't drizzled the caramel sauce on top considering nobody in our party really liked caramel, but I know others can't have apples without it, so to each their own. The mango was fantastic, and I'd get it again in a heartbeat.Positive overall experience, but I think their brunch menu is a more enticing reason to come back than dinner.",3,3,3,Dan C.,"Manhattan, NY",24,128,24

5.0,1/16/2018,"Upscale experience with thoughtful service (personalized to the occasion), creative drinks, and impeccable food!!We chose to come to Clocktower because of their Michelin star and we were thoroughly impressed with the food and service. Up a set of winding staircase from the Edition Hotel lies an expansive restaurant, complete with a bar and a pool table. The dining space spans three rooms, and it feels like you're dining in a mansion's drawing room. With tasteful gallery-style black and white portraits on the walls and a stately crackling fireplace, The Clocktower provides a cozy and intimate experience for all diners. We were celebrating our anniversary, which the boyfriend thoughtfully included in our reservation. The Clocktower, in response, provided us with a hand-written card that greeted us at our table, congratulating us on our anniversary. We were served complimentary champagne by the sommelier. And after our meal, we were treated to complimentary dessert, comprised of a mango mousse cake (with a candle!), and two almond tarts, all of which were delightfully light and not too sweet.Our meal:- Complimentary bread: The softest and warmest (actually quite hot) complimentary bread! The hot steam escaped as I broke apart the bread and for once, I didn't have to gut the bread because the crust was crisp enough to have a bite but not sharp enough to cut the roof of my mouth. - Roasted Maine Scallops: Hands down, BEST scallops we have ever had. Yes, we do have a running list because we both love seared scallops. These were perfectly seared at the top so that it was a light crisp and the whole dish was so cohesive paired the bed of cauliflower crumble, which was both tart and creamy. -Dry aged Creekstone Beef Tartare: We love a good tartare, and the wild mushrooms were such a nice touch (we love mushrooms). The penny bun biscuit that topped the beef tartare can be described as giant Chex mix rye chips, shaped like mushrooms. A playful and creative touch.-Roasted Long Island Duck: Hands down, BEST duck (aside from Hong Kong style duck) that we have ever had. The presentation of the duck was much like a thick slab of pork belly, and the cut had the juiciness and richness of pork belly, which we've never experienced with roasted duck. It was the most tender and succulent duck and we highly highly recommend it. The foie gras skewer was a surprising addition but paired nicely with the duck to yield a rich mouthful. -Braised Atlantic Halibut: Great dish that was overshadowed by the perfect duck. The halibut had a nice crispy sear on the top. We really enjoyed the chestnut gnocchi, which was smooth in consistency. The drink menu was filled with creative cocktails. My French Connection, served in a rustic tin moscow mule-like cup, was sweet and fragrant. I appreciated the candied ginger that topped the drink. The American Cereal Killer was more whiskey than I would like, since I was drawn to the ""cereal milk"" that it boasted. It was served in a glass version of the traditional single serve paper milk carton. Really cool glassware.Thank you so much to The Clocktower for a wonderful dining experience.

We sat at the gold bar and had a tough time getting the bartender's attention to place an order and we were rushed because I had a flight to catch. I requested a margarita not on the menu. Most of the cocktails didn't have tequila and that's what I wanted. Also, all the cocktails were ~$16 so I assumed mine was the same. NO ONE asked what kind of tequila I wanted, then just hit me with an $18 PER DRINK. I know it's New York but come on. Some warning would be mice-- would have gotten a cheaper tequila.  When it came time to close the tab, the bartender failed to listen when I asked him not to automatically charge the card used to open the tab. Total nightmare with everyone having to Venmo me. On top of all that, the clientele attracted to this spot had gone downhill greatly. Used to be young chic attractive and unfortunately not anymore. A couple was seated next to us and they were hell bent on harassing us, screaming loudly and hurling insults toward everyone at the bar. They were wasted in an embarrassing way and the bartenders said nothing to them. Legit making pro Trump, racist remarks and the managers / bartenders simply looked on.

You can tell that the menu has British inspired items infused with contemporary flavors and presentations.I think a must try is the Long Island duck with the Foie gras skewer but I'd go with medium or medium well rather than the medium rare recommended. The duck sits on a preserve of plums and shallotsAlso tried the pigeon and quail pie (see picture) cut in half. Very unusual and I think also a signature of this place.Also tried the fries (were OK, a wee bit dry) Berners Tavern macaroni and cheese with mushrooms and slow cooked on cheek (amazing and rich!) $26 and the Brooklyn burrata which was 'OK'Also tried the steamed green vegetables which vary from time to time but surprisingly small helping After trying all of the above I had to have green tea (they might consider changing the brand, very forgettable tea) and the apple and berry tart (cute, bite sized and fragrant) and a scoop of Banana and Passion fruit sorbet ($13 a scoop:/ )The interior looks old school with dark wood, huge marble fireplace, a billiard and bar room. Something that fits into the insurance row and credit Suisse clientele.

My friend and I came here for brunch and even though we didn't have reservations we we're promptly seated in the main dining area.

I ordered the English breakfast and my friend the eggs Benedict. The food, which came out promptly was simple and fresh. The sausage and pork belly were perfectly cooked and the eggs were just the way I like them. My only complaint was that the tomato was a bit soggy.

We were a table of 3 and started with a few cocktails... the dill - so delicious, and the presentation was on point. Absolutely lovely. Order that foie gras...

I would typically not ever mention service unless it was really bad - this was not bad service, however, you do have a Michelin Star and your service should reflect that. There were times that our water glasses stayed empty for 10-15 minutes, while waiters were walking by us.

3.0,12/19/2017,"3.5 Stars? We wanted to try it out after The Clocktower received a Michelin star.  Six of us came for dinner on a Sunday night with a reservation on open table. The restaurant is located on the second floor of the hotel and is surprisingly spacious and has kind of an old library feel with wooden paneled walls. The menu is al a carte, no tasting menu. We each got a cocktail to start as well as ended up sharing 3 bottles of wine between the 6 of us over dinner. We ordered 3 starters to share: the foie gras pudding which was okay, weird texture because almost too gelatin-like and mushy for foie. We also got the truffle Mac and cheese with pork belly which was delicious and the quail pie which was also so tasty and fried. For entrees we got the halibut, sea bass, duck, pork chop, burger, and lamb. My friend said the  sea bass was mediocre. The burger was huge and comes with crispy fries. My lamp was delicious as were the duck and pork chop. The halibut had sounded amazing with the oyster and roe but didn't end up being that outrageously great. My lamb came with a side of vegetables and various other meat parts of the lamb, which was tasty and very filling. We also shared the steamed vegetables (broccoli) and potatoes gratin sides for the table. The potatoes were really yummy, but overall these sides are very small for $8 each. We each literally got like maybe 1 or 1.5 pieces of broccoli. The reason for the major hit to the stars was the service. Waiters were friendly and knowledgeable but seemed to disappear and never come back. Our glasses stayed empty for over 10 minutes even though we still had wine left in our bottles. My friends first glass of champagne he ordered was completely flat (they gave him another when he told them.) When we wanted to order, it took a long time to do it. When we were handed dessert menus, some of us were in a rush and she still never brought the check. Took over 15 min for them to come back to actually let us order dessert that we almost said forget it. We ended up getting three cheeses which came with a nice bread and jam spread. To top it off, there are two private unisex restrooms for the entire restaurant, and both were found dirty whenever we went in. Toilet paper was all over the floor, and another guest had even thrown up IN THE SINK without any staff noticing and cleaning it up!! Overall pretty pricey too at about $35-50 per entree, $20-30 per starter, and $8 per side. Food was not the worst experience at all, but service really messed with the experience.

5.0,12/15/2017,"Excellent service, variety of dishes, and pacing for dinner. We got the Black truffle risotto ($25),  Long Island Duck ($39), and Rack of Colorado lamb ($45). FYI - they do not serve the uni risotto anymore.Service was awesome and I can see why they're a Michelin star restaurant based on that alone (along with the bread but we'll get to that later). They bring out a full set of plate, fork, and knife for your starters. Then, when you're finished they help clean the table up a bit and bring you a new set. Also, they're pretty attentive when it comes to refilling your beverages and asking if everything's good. Nothing ever felt rushed or too slow. Pretty standard stuff for a high class restaurant, I know, but still isn't the norm at all restaurants. Highlight: THAT BREAD, SOMEBODY PLEASE GIVE ME SOME MORE! The fluffy bread is the perfect warm temperature along with that somehow solid from a glance until you grab a slice of almost melted salted butter. I could eat this forever and this comes from a guy who eats sushi all day every day. I would come here for that alone, but let's not take away from the rest of the meal.The risotto with truffles was pretty standard stuff although the grains were a bit hard. However, the main courses were great and each done two ways. The duck breast was very complex in flavor with that persimmon and shallot chutney + duck juice, then the foie gras skewer was a delight as well. The lamb wasn't as good as the duck breast, though I think it was because I was too full at that point. One way it was done was a mini lamb mint stew like pot and of course as a rack too.Meal Value (from 1-10, my measure of quantity/quality of the meal compared to price): 9This is definitely on the higher end for meals to pay for, but it's well worth it. The main courses are deceptively filling, especially with how heavy most dishes are. That is definitely not a good thing, but it's British cooking - how can you not expect copious amounts of cream and butter in your dish.

4.0,12/2/2017,"Went for a late-night dinner date on a Thursday, and was shocked by how crowded it was. I'm glad we made a reservation. Presumably from the new Michelin addition. The somalier was the first of many waiters to offer service, and recommended a perfectly medium-bodied red that matched my palette. Following some light research of online reviews, my date and I opted for two appetizers to share and dessert. The beef tartare was the more hyped dish, but a massive disappointment; the meat, while well prepared, was totally overpowered by horseradish. I couldn't stomach more than two bites. Where the Kitchen redeemed themselves was with the scallops. Oh my, they were perfectly cooked and surrounded with comforting complementary flavors. For dessert, we tried the warm mango pudding, with banana passion fruit sorbet and shredded mango. So bomb. I keep thinking about the blend of opposite textures, temperatures, flavors - you had creamy, smooth, crunchy, cold, bitter, sweet...we were totally blown away. Also recommend the Tea!

4.0,11/20/2017,"Despite living right by Madison Square Park and seeing the namesake of this restaurant countless times, it never occurred to me that there was anything inside the building boasting the bright clock at the top until last year, when someone mentioned they were eating here. I certainly knew the restaurant across from it (EMP), but despite being a Stephen Starr production (having lived in Philly, he is 'the guy' when it comes to defining a Philadelphia food mogul), we didn't make it over until we decided to go grab a nice yet casual dinner last Friday. While peak reservation times were occupied, grabbing a 6 PM reservation after Daylight Savings Time ends doesn't feel as late anymore. Getting up to the dining area once you enter the hotel isn't that hard - go to the back left and take the modern-looking version of a spiral suitcase up - and the folks at the front will get you seated in one of the many larger rooms that comprises the Clocktower. As soon as I walked in, I felt like I was back in London - perhaps because my last meal there was at Berners Tavern, which is also run by Jason Atherton. It definitely captures a similar vibe, with a huge smattering of photographs adorning the walls, but with wooden frames to the windows and rooms as opposed to the more ornate (and a tad over the top) finishes that Berners exhibits. With very high ceilings, it has a bigger feel to it and helps to diffuse the noise from all the diners - it can get a bit louder as it fills up. Service was pretty solid overall, with the only possible benefit(?) being that I was originally charged more than $40 less(!) than the receipt had said (I told them about it - no worries). I went with Dill or No Dill, which was a little too tart of a cocktail for my liking, but it was still a decent cocktail overall. The beer selection was a bit generic (they had crafts, but fairly accessible ones), and my wife's glass of wine was okay but nothing too special.Unsurprisingly, just like Berners, the food here was overall quite delicious, if not mind-blowingly so. We started off with a dozen oysters (2/3 East Coast, 1/3 Kumamotos)...in a switch from my usual preferences, I actually enjoyed the Blue Points and Wellfleet oysters more, largely due to the slightly milder finishes, whereas the Kumamotos were a bit larger than I preferred, diluting the impact of their typical creamy texture. The mignonette was solid, and while the small, penny-sized slices of wild boar sausage were good, I'm not sure what business they had being served as an accompaniment to shellfish. The steak tartare was more interesting, as it had a very earthy flavor - enhanced by the mushrooms - that gave it a bit more of an interesting texture. That said, I felt the additional toppings were distracting, and I didn't get the impression that the steak itself was the best cut of raw beef one could use. Once we moved on to the entrees, though, it was a real treat. My wife's duck was cooked perfectly - a proper medium-rare, where the meat is succulent and juicy but still firm to the bite without being chewy. I went with the braised halibut served in a truffle sauce that not only had a strong flavor but was also thick - making it a great contrast against the lightly grilled but flaky halibut meat. Usually seafood is treated as a lighter dish, but I really enjoyed the very savory approach to the fish. We finished up sharing a cheese plate - not the largest selection in the world, but I did enjoy the 2 imported UK cheeses on the menu, particularly the mild hard cheese from Lincolnshire.Overall, I did enjoy the meal here, and I would probably come back again. It's got a decent price point for NYC, but it's not cheap (although cheaper than some other similarly Michelin-starred spots). That said, the food is pretty good on balance, and I do enjoy the fact that I felt like I was across the pond while eating here, even if Madison Square Park was just outside the building.",2,0,0,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",371,1653,169

The rumors about the bread are true: It's amazing! All I needed was a piece of cheese and that could've been my entree. Although the menu is quite adventurous and I wouldn't order the same thing again - I'm glad I tried it. Nothing is bad! Save room for dessert as 'hand on bible' the pink lady apple tart tatin is the best dessert I've ever had. Lastly, thank you for making my birthday dinner truly special.

2.0,9/4/2017,"Honestly very disappointed with this place, I was visiting with a couple of friends, all from different states and the service since the beginning was very unpleasant. I don't believe there is a dress code or age requirement to have dinner here, but the host placed us in one of the first rooms which was empty isolated from other customers. The waiter was very rude never really gave us any attention and was very pushy for us to start drinking wine or liquor, but we had to leave back to our states later on, so we stick with water and a strawberry drink with no alcohol. Moreover, since there was no consumption of liquor and after 2-3 times he asked us to drink, he left and came back one time to get our order. In a very rude way told us there was no way to add or remove any Ingredients (as if there are no food allergies) but we finally decided for stake, duck and scallops. The food was great but the service was very bad.  ""Our"" waiter never came back after he took our order and the person in charge with a grey suit every time he picked up a glass of wine from a customer that was leaving he helped himself by finishing their glass. Honestly I've been to other restaurants with same  and/or higher reputation and rating and never felt like they were treating me as a foreign or as if I didn't have the money to pay the food even when We were dressed casual as well as other people inside the restaurant.

The salad was deceivingly large and great taste.  They also surprisingly gave us a free tart at the end. Very nice.After, we ventured to the bar box pool table.

They do have a som if you need one. We requested for a specific type of table on our reservation and we're able to accommodate. Food : Ordered 1/2 dozen Kumamoto oysters, Berners Tavern Macaroni and cheese (morels, slow-cooked ox cheek), and the Long Island duck (roasted hen of the woods mushroom, confit leg, kohlrabi and peach salad). Every dish tastes delicious. The saltiness of the duck is perfectly balanced when you eat it with the kohlrabi. At the bottom of the kohlrabi they have more duck which was a nice surprise.

4.0,8/18/2017,"The clocktower is one of the hidden restaurant in the flatiron district, located in the second floor of the edition hotel. As a first timer to the restaurant, I thought the main cafe in the lobby of the hotel was the restaurant itself, which it wasn't... it was up the spiral staircase on the second floor of the building. So do ask for directions when you are in there. I check out the restaurant for restaurant week (summer 17'); for my pick I had the shellfish  linguini, the main cod, and the peach eton. The shellfish linguini was one of the best appetizer as if it were served in a different restaurant, the appetizer can be an entre by it self. The main cod was cooked with perfection, with mussel mainstrone, olive tapenade, and purple artichokes.

Interesting, but just way too strong. On to the food.... the beef tartare and scallops were amazing! The potatoes were a bit too cheesy/buttery for me.

4.0,8/5/2017,"Gosh, this place is unique and wonderful. Was visiting friends and they suggested we come here after dinner. The feel of this bar is just so different, there is a gorgeous pool room off the bar area, the decor is just fascinating to look at. The actual bar area is fairly small, semi-circle shaped and when we arrived on a Friday night around 9:30, we had the entire place to ourselves. I think craft cocktails are fantastic, I personally do not drink them because I cannot keep track of how much I am drinking. Well that went out the window this night because our friend who brought us here insisted we do cocktails. The glassware the drinks came in were hilarious, my friend ordered some sort of milk based drink, which came in a glass like see through milk carton. I had some refreshing vodka drink that went down far to easily and followed up with a mezcal drink garnished with a flower that went down even easier and was probably the best tasting cocktail I've ever had, smoky from the mezcal but perfectly balanced. My boyfriend got a coffee based cocktail, highly recommend, I mean everything was inventive and delicious, and with a price. Worth it though, however the rest of the night was interesting so drink slowly. I guess the place will close when people start to leave so they were closing up around 10:45 ish.

5.0,7/24/2017,"First stop of my restaurant week summer 2017 adventure.  Me and a few friends had this place on our lists, so we decided to come as a group of 3 and tried one of everything. Firstly, I love the decor of the restaurant. It's very old fashioned I would say, a little dressy, but at the same time very comfortable. It's a great place to catch up with your friends and have a good meal and a chat. Also there's a pool table which is super cool.The bread: amazing! I would come back for this bread, no joke. Apparently there's a ""normal sized"" and ""restaurant week sized"", with the RW one obviously a bit smaller. Not sure why the waiter felt the need to point this out to us, but I guess it was good to know. I will say that the normal sized one was superior to the RW bread because of the size - the normal one had more soft bread inside, while the RW one was mostly the crunchy exterior. I love the soft part of the bread.Japanese eggplant: easily the weakest appetizer in my opinion, but I may be a bit biased because I hate eggplant, but my entire party was not fond of this dish. Somehow the Aubergine caviar component saved this dish from complete disaster, as it changed the taste of the eggplant to something more palatable (but they're both eggplants... weird huh).Heirloom tomato salad: I quite enjoyed this! The tomatoes were perfectly ripe and sweet, and I loved the crunch of the sliced cucumbers. The lemons added sourness, acidity, but also sweetness. Overall a very light and refreshing appetizer to start off the meal.Shellfish linguine: the STAR of the show. I was so surprised to see this offered as an appetizer, because it would no doubt be a entree at any other restaurant week location WITH an extra charge. The broth was absolutely delicious - rich and decadent, and I loved the foam component. The linguine was a perfect al dente, and they were VERY generous with the king crab. 10 stars for this- definitely get this if you're a fan of seafood!Pork belly- a bit disappointing for an entree, as it was a pretty tiny portion. The pork itself was quite juicy and tender, and super flavorful. While the taste was there, the portion size left a little to be desired.Maine cod- the fish was cooked to perfection, and it was the perfect amount of flakiness. The green olive tapenade took me by surprise, as I normally hate olives, but this was really delicious. The sauce did not overpower the delicate fish at all.Lancaster chicken- the biggest portion of the entrees, and super worth it in my opinion. You get a big piece of chicken breast, SKIN ON (YES), with some radishes, kohlrabi purée, and chicken gravy. The chicken was perfectly cooked, and super moist and flavorful. The skin was the perfect crispness, simply amazing! I wish they gave more gravy actually. The kohlrabi purée was a great addition, and it's a taste I've never experienced before. I am not a fan of the radishes however; they were super hard and quite bland.Strawberries and cream, rose sorbet: the stronger of the desserts. It's a cream base, with a strawberry mousse:jelly on top, with an olive oil cake and a scoop of rose sorbet. I loved the addition of the cake.Peach Eton mess- a literal mess of a dessert. It's a ring of cherry whipped cream (yuck), with some peach compote I wanna say, with a scoop of peach sorbet (I assume) with pieces of meringue sticking out. The flavor profile was overly sweet in my opinion- I would avoid this one.Overall a fantastic place to go for restaurant week - the dishes I recommend are the shellfish linguine, the chicken, and the rose sorbet. The shellfish linguine alone gives this restaurant week experience an extra star because of the amazing value. Highly highly recommend The Clocktower.",2,0,0,Kevin C.,"Queens, NY",234,140,1516
4.0,7/24/2017,"Made a reservation for 12pm for Summer 2017 Restaurant Week. Overall, I think it was worth the $29 RW lunch price and it was a beautiful restaurant to eat in. The restaurant itself is located on the second floor of The Edison hotel, you just take the elevator up one floor. The décor and ambiance of the restaurant is very cozy, English and elegant. The pictures on Yelp do not do this beauty justice! Can I just say, their bread and butter is SOOOOO GOOD. It's fresh and hot out of the oven and their butter is so soft and creamy. I could eat that all day. & as far as I could tell, other tables loved it too because everyone seemed to have asked for more.Appetizers:    The Japanese eggplant with black sesame tahini, aubergine caviar, feta and cilantro made me feel very bougie. In simple words, this appetizer is a sesame seed coated eggplant with some black sesame sauce on the side. They somehow made a very mushy, messy, not the prettiest - looking vegetable taste, look and feel sophisticated.       The heirloom tomato salad, green strawberries, smoked Persian cucumber came with pickled lemons and tasted extremely refreshing and healthy. It was delicious, probably not worth the $29, but I'm sure its accounted for in the high quality of the ingredients.     The shellfish linguini, lemongrass king crab, lobster bisque was definitely worth the money. The portion was a lot bigger compared to the other two appetizers, there was a lot of crab and lobster chunks in there. They foamed the bisque which made the dish more bougie. It tasted great, nothing to complain about.Entrees:     The 36 hour braised pork belly, crispy polenta, roasted apricots, golden thyme was very tiny. I was kind of disappointed because the ""36 hour"" description makes it seem like the pork will melt in your mouth when you bite into it. But the meat was very lean for it being a pork belly, and I wasn't blown away by the taste or texture. It tasted like pulled pork without all the pulling. The crispy polenta was good though, it tasted like fried potatoes.     The Pan-roasted maine cod, mussels minestrone, green olive tapenade, purple artichokes was very aesthetically pretty, but I think the fish lacked some salt. I think this dish was better than the pork belly. There were more components to it, whereas the pork belly was just too boring.    The Lancaster chicken, kohlrabi puree, radishes, chicken gravy was surprisingly good. I think no one wanted to get the chicken because chicken sounds boring. But it was a really big slab of chicken and it was cooked beautifully. The meat was incredibly moist and the flavors were not overpowering. I thought the chicken was the most delicious out of all of the entrees.Desserts:    The strawberries and cream, rose sorbet looks like a crème brulee and was super yummy. It is vanilla crème with a layer of strawberry jam (which doesn't sound good together but trust me - its good) topped with a tiny tiny piece of olive oil cake (which doesn't sound good either but trust me again - its good) and fresh strawberries. Highly recommend.    The peach eton mess is a composite of meringue (that has been made into a chip/chocolate bark - type form) with whipped crème, jam, and a tiny tiny scoop of peach sorbet. The sorbet was delicious but everything else was a bit too sweet and not what I expected. I wasn't really crazy about the concept.. would not recommend.",0,0,0,Jenn Z.,"Jamaica, Queens, NY",247,182,1535

I usually hate the pork and apple combo but I liked this3) Dessert was a non-distinct toffee molasses cake. *Their house bread is phenomenal. Yea I said it. Come at me Wonder Bread. Movie room (see pic) is brilliantly adorned with pics of celebs of past, very cool. They also have three separate dining rooms, all with their own theme, uber coolThe Clocktower's regular menu might have you reaching for your checkbook applying for a loan and refinancing your house, so RW for $29 was a good tease. However, this was one of the rare RW encounters that left me wanting more. Every dish was meticulous and executed flawlessly. And who doesn't want some good ol' spotted dick. Yes. they have spotted dick. LOL, joking aside, The Clocktower convinced me and I will definitely be coming back for a special occasion. Can't wait!",18,7,9,Albert K.,"New York, NY",2235,456,1930

4.0,5/10/2017,"I love the ambiance of this place. Don't get lost the restaurant is not on the first floor, you will go up in the narrow spiral staircase leading up to 3rd floor, although if laziness hit you, you can use the elevator as well. It is a 3 room dining areas. The rooms are surrounded by antique dark mahogany, the old style doors are gorgeous, rooms are high ceiling, old gold frames with black and white photos hanging near the top crown moulding down below, the dark tables and chairs, the image is classic NYC.  The music is soothing 60's and 80's. Not loud. Very intimate ambiance.They have pre-fixed lunch which composed of a choice of an appetizer, an entree and a choice of a dessert for additional $6. They serve the bread right out of the oven, very warm and still smoking when you pick a piece paired with a soft butter. They bake their own bread. The crust is crispy and the bread is soft and moist. I ate almost half of the bread. My pre fixed selection is the salad, very surprising as it was overly substantial. The salad itself is a heavy lunch choice already. I did not finish it even after we shared it, so I elected to take the leftover home. Had a taste of the burger. Quite a big portion for a small person like me. It was perfectly done for my taste. It came with a juicy French fries which was not consumed hence another take home. The foie gras was creamy and it almost look like a compote to me. Very delicious.  The fish and chips wasn't oily and the mashed pea pairing intensified the smoothness of the fish. We preferred not ordering the additional dessert for our figure sake. Unexpectedly they serve a small sweet cake that goes well with my cappuccino. Very good experience and the lounge downstairs is very elegant and good for some photo shoot.",1,0,0,Gwen G.,"New York, NY",52,192,1125

4.0,4/17/2017,"Summary:  if you have the funds, the Clocktower is worth your time. First floor bar - mix their drinks right. It's not cheap, but worth the extra price compared to my hotel bar. Ambience:  was the reason I chose to come here, and it did not disappoint. The first floor was terrific blend of modern and classic. The spiral stairs take you to the second floor, where many rooms await. One has a pool table, all of them have a bevy of framed art and comfortable seating. Service:  very good. Kimberly (1st floor) and Natalie were great, and she had a team of staff that was great about waiting on us without being intrusive. Asparagus appetizer:  good - it's white asparagus, which may throw you off, but it tastes goodBread:  you could have the bread and biutter alone for dinner and would walk away a satisfied customer. The bread was artisanal, the butter had enough salt to bring a solid flavor. Skirt steak - I know this had a lot of butter and lime. Healthy?  Probably not. Tasty?  You bet. And the accompanying fries were enjoyed by all. Wine selection - they either had very cheap or very expensive. Not much in between.

As a hotel guest, I was very impressed with the Clocktower.  I had an 8:30 reservation but my guest was running late and needed to move it to 9 PM and they were completely accommodating. I went to the bar which is fairly small in size and intimate - surrounded by floor to ceiling gold framed pictures of famous actors and actresses dating back to the 50's and 60's and beyond it seemed...... so much to look at.  Exceptional service from the bartenders.  There is a very cool room with a purple felted pool table just off the bar which is really cool.  The restaurant is set up such that there are various ""rooms"" so while there is a lot of space, it is broken out.  This made for a very romantic and intimate dinner.  The food was delicious. We opted to share several plates and had the Kale Salad (added Burrata), a warm loaf of amazing bread that was steaming, and the steak which somehow they cooked to perfection with the edges med/well and the center med (my guest and I prefer different levels of pink).  It was delicious.  The wine selection was great and the service was impeccable from our waiters.

4.0,3/7/2017,"Tick tock, this restaurant week menu won't last long...And boy, did I think it was worth it. We had a new addition to my team at the office and I planned a welcome lunch at one of our go-to's. Luckily my coworker mentioned it was restaurant week and that Clocktower had been on his list. One quick call later, we were on our way.The interior and decor is on point. You walk through the lobby of the Edition hotel, up a winding staircase that feels like a portal into another world, and you end up in a fancy, British-style dining room adorned floor to ceiling with framed portraits and scenes from the streets of London.Service was okay. It took a while for us to get the attention of anyone, and I liked the touch of new silverware every course. However, the forks and knives were just arbitrarily placed in front of each person and wasn't neat looking at all. If you're going to do something special, go all the way; halfway is just messy. They were very accommodating when we needed to dash out earlier than expected and our dessert and check was expedited.For food, our table covered every single choice on the menu. I went for the shellfish ravioli, pork belly, and toffee bread pudding. The ravioli was quite tasty, and I loved the sauce they poured over it. My pork belly was cooked very well, which made the dish. The sides, including the pear and the charred fennel, were pretty forgettable and I wished they used a different starch with the dish. The dessert was a little sweet for my tastes, and I thought the toffee was a bit too hard in bigger chunks. It went well with coffee though and the sorbet helped cut through the density of the pudding (but not the sweetness; it was equally sweet if not even sweeter).If you want a bigger portion, the kale salad is HUGE. Like overflowing from the bowl huge. At any other places, add a protein and you've got a meal. The greens were very fresh and I loved how well they dressed it. The deep fried sunchokes added a nice crunch. The cod was a bit undercooked for my coworker, and I didn't love the sauce. My other coworker commented that his chicken was way too salty.

Accompanied by pear-ginger sorbet.Not my typical cuisine to try but I did enjoy the meal and experience.

4.0,1/30/2017,"Truly thankful that they were able to accommodate a surprise birthday dinner for a group of 9 and execute the meal without any hiccups. The Clocktower is a beautiful establishment on top of a captivating spiral staircase with walls lined with gold frames in the dining room, bar room, billiard room, etc. My boyfriend and I arrived half an hour early since we didn't want to carry a bouquet of balloons around town and were able to play a few games in their classic billiard room. They don't allow balloons in their dining room, but the manager made an exception to let us have them at our table until the birthday girl showed up. We checked them in after. Totally understandable for this type of dining ambiance (especially since they were Spongebob). Their drinks were delicious and fun. They made me contemplate ""dill or no dill"", ""give peas a chance"", and nobody can say no to cheerios (milk). After drinks were served, we were blessed with warm, sourdough and creamy butter. More restaurants need to serve warm bread. We ordered the steak tartare and scallops to share, along with two orders of the mac & cheese as appetizers. The chips with the steak tartare were basically pork rinds - amazing! The mac & cheese was addicting, the ox cheeks were incredibly soft. The scallops were just OK as well as the halibut entree. I was not a fan of the cucumbers and the chartreuse was very faint. The duck entree was fantastic however, with the skewer of sweetbread and chanterelles being a highlight. I would come back to have that and maybe the dover sole if my wallet is feeling heavy.We had brought a cake for after the meal and didn't intend on it being a surprise, but after some confusing yet hilarious signaling with one of the servers, it was a perfect surprise.Also, I totally forgot to ask where the bar carts are from, but would love one of those for my living room (please advise if anyone can answer this!).",3,2,2,Sharon Z.,"New York, NY",550,114,158

5.0,12/27/2016,"An amazing time and experience at The Clocktower, which went much better than anticipated. I made a reservation a month before for my boyfriend's birthday, and I was so glad I made the choice of Clocktower. The food was absolutely delicious, atmosphere was perfect for a celebratory occasion, and service was attentive and unpretentious. Five stars/bonus point that my boyfriend had a really great time and very much enjoyed his birthday dinner, and who doesn't want to try to impress their loved one on their birthday.For those of you like myself who have limited exposure with a very basic understanding of British food, this is a place to try. Or rather, it is a must try. The menu looked outstanding upon reading, but note it all comes at a bit of a steep but all worth it price. I wanted to find a place that was somewhat fancy but without the necessites of a particular dress code. You can come and be yourself. It borders between casual but high end enough for any special occasion. There are three rooms plus the main bar. We sat in the middle room, or what I call the Hollywood room, with framed pictures upon pictures of well known celebrities. The lighting is nice and dim at night for what felt like a mostly intimate but comfortably spacious space for two people to converse. Meanwhile, food and drink -- I personally thought A-mazing. Cocktails are a worthwhile try ($16), all of which were expert mixtures and a lovely complement to our meals. Give Peas A Chance was our favorite of the night, a mixture of Bombay gin, Yellow chartreuse, Salted pea cordial, Lemon juice, Fresh mint, Butterfly absinthe, and Egg white. The Los Pollos Hermanos (ode to Breaking Bad perhaps) was refreshing as well. We ordered some appetizers -- 1/2 doz bucket of oysters bits and bobs and quail frumenty scotch egg with wild mushrooms, tea, liver parfait. For main, I had the Colorado lamb (spiced pistachio crust, mixed grains, caramelized yogurt, artichokes). My bf had the Berkshire pork chop (piccalilli, black pudding, crackling, apple sauce). We loved our dishes. I tried some of his pork chop, which was succulent and tender. My lamb chop was real tender and slid easily right off the bone. I would get this again, but I would also be curious to try one of their seafood dishes, like the sole or halibut. We ended our meals with a bit of dessert, but 'a bit' might be an understatement. The Pink Lady apple tarte tatin for two, Madagascar vanilla ice cream could have fed 4 people easily. But I would go for this in a heartbeat again. It was a truly sweet end to our meal. Overall, a really pleasant experience at The Clocktower and a successful birthday dinner for the two of us. I would recommend it for a special occasion, if you are looking for this sort of experience/food. It's not over the top but fancy enough to satisfy a more celebratory occasion. Otherwise, I would definitely return for brunch or lunch and see their offerings during the day. The dinner was exceptional, and I was very happy with The Clocktower in its entirety.

Service is great and you definitely will not feel rushed at any point!Favorite appetizer was the quail frumenty. I had no idea what to expect but it was a small bowl of a risotto-like stew with pieces of delicate quail, a tiny scotch egg, and the wonderful flavor of wild mushrooms. Served with a mushroom tea on the side and a liver mousse. It was fantastic and perfect for a cold winter night!! Also delicious was the king crab and the marinated yellowtail.For entrees, both the duck and the lamb were sensational and cooked beautifully. The macaroni and cheese with slow cooked ox cheek and mushrooms was also delicious but unfortunately was over salted. So salty that my mother couldn't eat more than half the plate! I noticed my lamb was too salty, as well, but not as overpoweringly so as the mac and cheese. This was definitely disappointing.For dessert, don't miss the apple tarte tatin- it's HUGE and decadent doused in thick caramel sauce. The sticky toffee pudding was possibly the best sticky toffee I've ever had.All in all, a very delicious meal with great ambiance and service.

4.0,12/9/2016,"Clocktower was a pretty good experience and my rating is closer to 4.5 stars than 5. I tried the American Cereal Killer cocktail which was interesting but I didn't love. It wasn't that far from milk with a shot of bourbon was pretty expensive.I really didn't enjoy the pressed chicken appetizer. The pickled veggies on the side I thought were too hard and too sour. They were likely there to help cut the richness of the foie, but I ended up just avoiding them. It came with garlic bread and the chicken also had cobnuts so texture wise there was too much hard and crunchy. The main however was phenomenal. I had the cote de boeuf and shared with one other person and it was definitely more than enough food. Perfect medium rare with a bone marrow gravy that was incredibly decadent. The greenbeans were cooked to perfection too though I'm not sure the foie gras cubes tossed in brought anything to the dish. I love gratin as well so that was a great addition.I ended the meal with the pistachio souffle and it was definitely worth the wait. Relatively soft and light with the chocolate ice cream melting down the center it was a great finisher that I would love to have again.Service was on point though the lay out of the restaurant is a bit labyrinthine. Multiple people finishing their meals at the same time is a bit annoying though as the coat check is behind the maitre'd which is in between a bunch of fairly narrow hallways.",0,0,0,Hamilton Y.,"Manhattan, NY",3,51,2

The sommelier came to our table right away and was charming and informative.Onto the food-- We got the beef tartare and the pressed chicken/foi gras to start. I love both beef tartare and foi gras generally speaking. With that said, the starters were the biggest miss for me. I didn't love the beef tartare and I wasn't expecting the foi gras appetizer to be a terrine. If I had know that, I wouldn't have ordered it-- I didn't think it was that great. BUT the bread-- the sourdough bread they bring out is amazing.For the entrees, we ordered the Duck and the Bone in 40 day dry aged prime NY strip. Both were very good. It wasn't the best steak I've ever had, but it was a very good steak and I thought the duck was delicious.

4.0,11/27/2016,"Beautifully executed food in an elegant setting. When you enter the building, there's a great bar you need to walk past/go up a spiral staircase to access The Clocktower.Highly recommend. The only reason for 4/5 stars is because, relative to other similar restaurants, this was good but not necessarily a stand-out.1. Food: let's start with the basics. The bread is so good! It's a round sourdough that is piping hot, crusty on the outside and soft on the inside. Apparently the burgers are famous here based on other Yelp reviews; one person in my party tried it and pronounced it as a ""superior burger"" and I had a delicious duck l'orange that was perfectly done, with crispy skin and tender duck meat. They serve complimentary cookies and sweets when they deliver the cheque, too.2. Drinks: I had two of their red wines - good selection, good temperature. Also tried one of their cocktails, the American Cereal Killer (michter's bourbon, Cheerios milk, Madagascan vanilla syrup, and angostura bitter) which was pretty strong and served to me in a milk jug.3. Vibe: upscale, relaxed, elegant. The rooms are filled with paintings, and near the bar area is an open room with a billiards table. I would happily go back just for the bar to sample more of the cocktails. Spotted a few people wearing jeans, but most folks were in business casual wear.",0,0,0,Christine Y.,"New York, NY",30,50,12
5.0,11/20/2016,"This review speaks for the bar and the pool table access. On an epic hunt for a pool table, Yelp led us to The Clocktower. From the pictures it looked elegant and we also assumed the pool table would be totally open in the middle of a Saturday afternoon.We met the bartender and (naturally) challenged him to fashion us two drinks with Bourbon and Gin. I received an incredible orange-coffee-bourbon cocktail, and my boyfriend received a delicious citrus-y Gin creation. After this we were blown away and proceeded to challenge him over and over (and over, whoops). Not only did we enjoy beautiful cocktails, and a cool chalice cup that my boyfriend said made him feel like a king, but we also got our pool fix in! The pool room has one table and is in between the dining room and the bar. The perfect distance from our next cocktail :)Beware of the pool sticks however. They are shorter than normal ones! My boyfriend swears the only reason he lost more than 70% of our games was because they were too short. He can say what he wants but we all know I'm just a tough pool competitor :)What an incredible find! We've definitely discovered our new spot!",0,0,0,Katie R.,"Manhattan, NY",18,38,47
4.0,10/25/2016,My review for The Clocktower is long overdue but here it goes! My Aunt and Uncle took me and my here for my birthday dinner when I visited New York. We arrived a little early for our reservation and went straight to the bar. The bar was very lively filled with people mingling. I can't remember my drink but I remember that it was really pretty and it had an orchid for the garnish! When our table was ready we sat down and the waiter greeted us with the most amazing fresh bread. I could have eaten this crusty warm sourdough all night. I ordered the steak tartare to start and it was so delicious. It was served beautifully and it was the perfect way to start my meal. I ordered the crispy duck for my entree and they were very accommodating with my request to leave out the fennel that is usually an ingredient with the dish. We were all too full when the meal was over so we skipped dessert but the check came with a tin of cookies and caramels! Overall The Clocktower is very good. It gives off an old New York vibe. I have been able to experience a lot of the food scene in New York and it didn't quitemeasure up to other places with a similar price. I had a good experience and enjoyed my food here but 4/5 is my overall opinion of The Clocktower.,8,8,8,Amanda P.,"Woodland Hills, CA",559,225,268

With the starters blowing us away we were admittedly nervous about the mains. Discerning wife got the duck and I ordered the pork chop. Both were excellent with the duck taking the win on complexity and depth while the pork chop was pure classic with apples and crackling.

The crackling was a very nice addition to the dish. Dessert was the pink lady and the milk chocolate mousse, both of which were very nice.  The pink lady is sufficient to satisfy two people easily.Will be back again.",0,0,0,K.

5.0,9/11/2016,This is a great hotel Reasturant that really elevates food and service to a new level. It deserves a 2 star Michelin  . From starters to main dishes you could not really make a complaint cause it would be a insult to the chef . Although my fish came out warm and not straight from oven the taste was amazing and was one of the best seafood meals I had in a long time . I honestly felt I was at a 3 star Michelin resturant but at a fraction of the cost. My wife ordered the filet steak which was one of the best steaks she ever had . I was able to taste it and I cut with my regular knife and it just cuts so effortlessly . The manager was running around all night making sure that waiters were doing their job right and attending to all customers .

1.0,7/22/2016,We had waited so long to go to this restaurant. I live in LA - my daughter in NYC. When this restaurant first opened she said we have to go. But it was hard to get a reservation the few dates I was in town. So last night - when other plans fell through - we scored a same night reservation.  What a beautiful hotel and a beautiful bar. Very impressive. My daughter had been there for drinks before and thought they were fantastic. We were ready for a wonderful meal. We sat at a cute table by the fireplace and yelped everything we wanted to eat. The reviews and pics were all good. But somehow the menu had changed and nothing we ordered for appetizers looked like they did online. The streak tartare - probably one of my favorite dishes elsewhere  - hand chopped - tasted like raw hamburger you mixed with ketchup for meatloaf. Neither of us wanted a second bite - and just stared at it. The Parmesan crusted scallops were raw and the little crust was a hat that quickly fell off. I suggested to her that we Iove sushi and so why does this taste so bad?  Again - stared at it. I considered the fact that it was 20 and I cut my one (if two) in 4 pieces so each horrible bite was 2.50. I still just had one bite. At that point we had also ordered the burger and considered stopping it. The other dishes we were ready to order fell from our  minds. Perhaps we leave and go to an old favorite?   The waitress knew we were unhappy and started to ignore us. No manager was called.  The burger was good. No question. Even great. And the fries were to die for. Really good. But that's it. In the end - The appetizers were credited to the bill - thanks I guess - and the waitress gave us two horrible desserts as a token. They gave us spoons - but the poached peach we had was so hard I considered  asking for a steak knife. I wanted to tell the manager a few suggestions - or even to go and taste the food they were producing that night - perhaps the chef was out ill?  But he or she was not to be found. I wish you guys the best of luck. Please pay attention to my review as I will not be back and will not have an opportunity to help you with the other dishes. But I might stay at the hotel. Hopefully they have other restaurants to recommend to the guests.

3.0,7/19/2016,"This is a restaurant that makes you feel cool and in the know but also a little foolish for liking it's silly gimmicks and paying ridiculous prices for certain dishes/drinks. You walk in to the lobby area with music pulsating from the  multiple dining rooms and bar areas.  The host/hostess were very chic but friendly and we were seated quickly.  I ordered the the gin cured salmon and filet mignon.  The salmon was an unexpected, 2 inch high mini block (I'm used to sliced) and was paired with an iced tea.  The salmon cut beautifully- almost like a terrine or foi gras but the texture was mealy and off- putting.  In addition the flavor was two mild (apparently gin curing doesn't add a whole lot of flavor) and some fishiness came through.  The tea was refreshing and a great palate cleanser but otherwise didn't add much.The filet mignon was cooked perfectly and was wonderfully tender but was served on a wooden board next to an empty dinner plate (with a skull design).  What was the point?  I moved the meat onto my plate and they took the board away.  My partner ordered the chicken Kiev that was brought table side in a wooden drawer.  The server opened the drawer and took out the piece of chicken.  Is this some historical reference or a warming technique?  Kind of perplexing and cool but then we wondered what the point of this was, other than some indulgent showmanship.  We order the dessert for 2- a tartartine for $25.  It was very tasty but $25 for an apple dessert?  The other desserts were all$15.  Our check was almost $400 for 2 people with 2 courses each, a shared dessert and a couple of drinks.  The service was pretty good and mostly consistent.I will go back but will walk, not run.",1,0,0,Roni J.,"Manhattan, NY",65,98,204

We started off with two appetizers: split pea risotto and the tuna. I'm not usually a fan of risotto, but this one was so flavorful and not too heavy. The tuna was also fresh and the shiso and sauce on top complemented the dish well. For the mains, we got the halibut and the burger. The halibut was recommended by the waitstaff and didn't fail to disappoint. The burger was melt in your mouth juicy, and also came with large block fries which were delicious.

The somm was at our table within seconds after I cracked their expensive and aggressively marked up winelist, i.e. $74 for a bottle of Oregon Pinot that wholesales at $13??  That's obnoxious. The service wares are nice, but they don't begin to justify the beverage prices. When it was time to close out, the check was literally dropped on the table with no form of ""thank you"".

5.0,4/5/2016,"FIVE STARS FOR THE BREAD.My favorite thing is when a restaurant has really solid bread for the table.It's a whole wheat sourdough that comes warm (ours was actually PIPING hot) with a side of butter.  Not only is it plenty for two people, they asked use TWICE if we wanted more bread.  Crazy self control on my part that I denied it twice.  If they asked one more time I might have said yes.  I had the chicken kiev which is I think fried with panko on the outside.  (It doesn't take like a greasy fried chicken though)  When you cut open the chicken buttery juice come pouring out...not sure if they stick a chunk of butter in there before frying but it is seriously decadent.  I can't even remember the sides that were on my dish, but I cleaned my plate, didn't leave a single thing behind.My boyfriend had an equally pleasing experience with his choice which was a the halibut.  Halibut is one of our favorite fish and it's hard to find in NY so he had to get it.  His came with some sort of carrot puree?  and some other delicious veggies.  There was nothing left on his plate either.  He did leave some mushrooms behind that I was more than happy to take for him.Dessert looked amazing but just couldn't possibly do it.  I secretly knew they would give us cookie with our check so I was looking forward to that. There were two buttery shortbreads, some brittle and some sort of caramel.....We had everything and left a couple tiny pieces of brittle behind.  It was a pleasant palete pleaser!

Would have traded that for flavor, as it was remarkably bland. On an up note the $25 burger was well worth it, although I would have enjoyed a few more bites to be fully satiated. The beer choices were limited to one of each type, but the IPA was solid. Coffee and cheese plate were good; the Baked Alaska very well crafted and delightful. Service was sluggish.

4.0,3/25/2016,"I tried this place with my wife for my birthday.  There were a couple of things that intrigued me about this place.  First the executive chef seems to be a close apprentice of Gordon Ramsay, who I think now is a sell out, but still a one of the best chefs in the world nevertheless.  We were led to a dinning room which had three compartments, but we were seated closer to the exit.  I never like to be seated near the exit, but I let it pass because my reservation was done relatively late.  We started with king crab, which were fresh.  Then I got the veal sweetbread, mushroom risotto.  I thought the seasoning was well done, but I wish the rice was cooked a tid bit more than what I was served.  It was tasty, but it was still too raw and crunchy to me (Well, I like crunchiness for other food, but as for risotto, I prefer it to be silky smooth).  I had duck breast for entree, and my wife had burger.  Both were pretty good.  I thought the duck was medium cooked perfectly, which the exact aroma/smell that needed to stay in duck, and the puree (I forgot exactly what that was) matched perfectly with the meat.  Then pistacchio souffle.  Being a crazy souffle hog, this was one of the main reasons I chose this place for my birthday dinner.  and I wasn't disappointed.  They dropped a scoop of chocolate ice cream on top of the souffle right before I started.  It was amazing.  It was so soft and fluffy, and melted in my mouth right when I put the spoon in my mouth.  This was the second best souffle I have ever tasted, and it wasn't that far from the first one (and the restaurant I tasted the best souffle ever... has closed down since then).  I thought staff/servers worked hard, but sometimes they were a bit off (like taking the longest time to bring the check, etc).  I think this issue matter should be addressed in a timely manner for this restaurant to become one of the best in the city.Overall, I really liked my experience.  I will definitely come back especially for souffle.  I am not just saying it because there are already a couple of my friends who lined up to try it.",1,0,1,Jay I.,"New York, NY",260,683,192

Came here for a business lunch since its relatively close to my office. The bread was delicious - warm and comes with yummy butter. The drinks service was great as well.What fell short for me was the burger. And before you read on, know that I ordered it well done, which could have taken away from it's glory. That being said, I did not love the flavors that went into this creation. Something about the smokey bacon, or the bread that was a little too toasted, or the coleslaw that it comes with- did not hit the spot.

It's a giant loaf of some sort of whole wheat bread that comes hot out of the oven w a whipped butter that is so addicting. Shamefully my friend and I ate 1 loaf each and seriously thought about splitting a third...Onto the actual food! Everything on the menu looked pretty good but I would highly recommend the braised beef cheek.

5.0,2/13/2016,"My wife and I came here for an early Valentine's Day date. We chomped though a good deal of food, so I'll just get right to it.The decor here is incredible. It's elegant yet old fashioned-inspired. High ceilings, big fireplace, wide-planked dark wood floors, dark wainscoting, etc.The bar is a destination in itself, and they make some really unique cocktails that utilize ingredients you never expect to see in a drink, like chicken stock and pea puree.Table bread is a nice warm and toasty loaf that's served with a soft, freshly salted whipped butter.We started with a dashi cured smoked salmon appetizer that was topped with puffed rice, greens and a soft boiled quail egg.This had a bright and acidic pop to it. A great way to start the meal.Our next course was a burger, which we shared.This this was pretty much perfect. By far, this was the best thing we ate here.It was seared to a nice crisp on the outside, and a beautiful medium rare on the inside.On top was lettuce, bacon, red onion, pickle, cheddar cheese and special sauce. Nothing too fancy - just really good quality shit. The bun was toasted and warm on the outside but soft like a potato roll on the inside. Just the right balance.The fries were thick, long and hand-cut - like John Bobbitt's dick - only crunchy on the outside and soft inside, like mashed potatoes. They could have used a little bit more seasoning or salt, but they were so perfectly cooked that I didn't mind.Our awesome waiter Jake, who had really great suggestions on drinks and food items, cleared the table and presented us with these kickass plates as we awaited out main course.For our main course we ordered the cote de boeuf for two, which was a 40oz bone-in rib eye that came with gratin potatoes (two servings), a green bean salad, and bone marrow jus.This thing was beautiful. The sear on the outside was like a salty and crisp meat bark, and the aroma was out of this world. It was dressed up with some lightly roasted garlic cloves and thyme.As you can see, the meat was cooked to a gorgeous pink medium rare, and every bite was tender and juicy. The fat was so soft and mushy too - completely edible. Nine out of ten!I wasn't much of a fan of the bone marrow jus. For some reason it wasn't working for me in the flavor department, but it did smell wonderful.The potatoes were pretty good. With gratin style potatoes, I always find myself wishing that the chef had done several thinner crisped preparations and then layered them before serving, that way there is some more of that delicious top crunchy texture as you work your way down into the middle.The green bean salad was nothing to scoff at. It was topped with truffle and tossed with foie gras! This thing was so earthy from the truffles, the truffle oil, the toasted hazelnuts and the foie that it was almost like having another meat course.By time dessert rolled around we were pretty full, so we just shared this chocolate custard item with a cocktail that was made from cheerios milk and bourbon called ""The American Seriel Killer.""To our surprise, Jake later brought over a tin of shortbread, brittle and English toffee, along with a special dessert plate of grapefruit sorbet since he learned that we were celebrating a special occasion. Killer service here.I highly recommend this place. At $25 the burger may seem a bit steep at first, but it's a half pound of some of the best eating you'll ever have, and it also comes with those delicious fries. Similarly, at $135 the steak for two may seem steep, but you get three sides with it, and I guarantee you will go home full and satisfied.",2,2,1,JohnnyPrimeC. C.,"Manhattan, NY",199,213,4300

4.0,2/7/2016,"The second floor setting accessed by the elevator of a tony downtown hotel makes Clocktower a spot worth reserving. A London bred, Michelin starred chef has brought his show to NYC and it is an excellent show. The exceptional hamburger ($25) is a hearty patty made of dry aged blend beef. There is sharp cheddar draped and melted onto the burger. The Churchill sauce is a mayo ketchup  mix that pairs well with the hot red pepper pickle slices, lettuce and red onion. The patty is seasoned well and charred with nicely. The temperature is precisely medium rare. Juices flow freely and the beef stands up and through the toppings. This is a well balanced tower of meat, bread and condiments. Although the brioche style bun appears lofty and large, it holds the sandwich and its' juices in a neat package. An order of tuna tataki ($18) involves Yuzu sauce and pickled English cucumbers, whipped avocado, sesame seeds and baby radish. Seared quickly these tiny roulettes of tuna are rich and tender. Buttery. Drizzled with olive oil. The plate is airy and simply perfect in its presentation and combination of flavors. Mario Battali sat next to us with a large party. Always a good omen. The Saturday lunch service is professional and well timed. The drinks are mixed with exactitude.The atmosphere is clubby - a bar sits in one room connected to the dinning room via pool room.

The only negative is It is a bit hard to find (have to climb the winding staircase which doesn't have a sign).The sourdough bread to start (free) was delicious. It comes to the table still warm with soft butter. I had the burger which was solid - not the best burger I have ever had but still worth the money.

As a birthday surprise, my husband made us a reservation at 8:00pm on Sunday. The decor is lovely and cozy, but I will say we were disappointed that they sat our table next to the server station. What would have been an otherwise intimate celebration, was slightly awkward with the waitstaff constantly gathering, switching out silverware, etc. The food itself was delicious, but I don't think worth the price. We started with the scallops, which were very good. I had the venison, which I liked, but I laughed at the plating -- a HUGE white plate, with two carrots, two pieces of granola (I almost broke a tooth on it), and two small cuts of venison. For $43, it definitely wasn't worth it -- they were borderline bite-size. My husband had the duck, which was very good, with a flavorful au jus, but the turnips and onions were undercooked and didn't really go with the rest of the flavors on the plate. The service itself left a bit to be desired. Our server couldn't have cared less - he barely greeted us, took our menus and walked away without saying anything after we ordered, never came to check on us, and when we said no thank you to dessert, dropped the check on our table and rushed us out the door. Perhaps we were spoiled from a special night out the night before, or perhaps I'd built up my expectations too high, but it's the first time we've ever had a fine-dining experience that left us disappointed.",0,1,0,Allison S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,0

Still we stay patient and begin to eat...but neither during us eating nor even after we are done does our or any other waiter ask if we would want anything else!?  No question about how the meal is? If we we would like anything else!?  And add to all, by this time we have been there for over 45 minutes and the meal is done and still nothing on the 1st thing we ordered and repetitively re-Requested: bread/butter.  We travel considerably and have the mindset that 1st purpose of a Resturant is to ""SERVE YOU FOOD"" and do it in a satisfactory fashion.  Ambiance and theatrical characteristics of the waiter(s), if even if interest, should only be subordinate to that 1st purpose.  This Resturant utterly failed at that.",0,3,0,S.

Rather than greeting you as a diner, you are eyed skeptically, as if you were intruding.  My wife arrived 5 minutes before our reservation time and was left standing next to a pool table. Of course, she asked to see the manager, who escorted her to a table.  I arrived on time but received more scrutiny than in the security line at an airport.

After we ordered, the hostess informed us an unfortunate incident in the kitchen meant we would have to choose an alternative, and we ordered the duck. It did not disappoint.

5.0,11/30/2015,"Who knew British food could be so good? Well, actually I do as I became a huge fan after spending some time in London earlier this year. I read about the Clocktower and the fish and chips and had to try them out for lunch as that's the only time they have it on the menu. We had a 2:00 reservation on a Saturday and the place was jammed. My only complaint as the atmosphere is lovely is the acoustics...holy moly the girls table next to us celebrating a birthday with LOT'S of champagne was deafening. Our server seemed a bit green but was professional none the less. I opted for a great bottle of Gamay and we decided on the fish and chips and the burger. The chips were spectacular! Just as good as the ones I had at one of Gordon Ramsey's places in London. The fish was nicely coated and not at all greasy and the mushy peas were lovely with just the right amount of mint. Now on to the burger...Best.Burger.In.Manhattan. The meat was a combo of probably some short rib or even waygu it was so tender. The caramelized onions were the perfect topping and it couldn't have been more expertly cooked to a nice medium rare. We were seriously in a food coma for the rest of the day/night.

Multiple rooms with a huge bar as the centerpiece. This is Manhattan, so a $16-18 cocktail can be found though I'm still not convinced is worth it. The dining area reminded me of a library with many small rooms. The food was very good, but the portions were very small. My halibut and the accompaniments took up 1/4 of my plate.

Big walls in a second floor space filled with photographs with frames, beauteous.  Vintage photography. A portrait of Grace Jones in the 70's. Pictures in black and white of the Chrysler Building.

5.0,11/18/2015,"Went on 11/15. Hot damn. This is definitely a destination for...essentially 1 star Michelin dining (fine dining at a reasonable price). Possibly one of the best places I've been all year.First off, do not mistake the downstairs bar for the Clocktower's bar, at your peril. The downstairs bar is, I believe, called Edition. I accidentally thought it was the Clocktower bar, due to the similar unique names of the drinks, but once the bartender had to look at a book to figure out how to make the FIRST cocktail listed, I knew there was something wrong.The Clocktower bar is upstairs, adjoining the restaurant. The cocktails are clever (particularly the Cereal Killer, using momo milk-style cereal milk and bourbon), and the non-alcoholic ones (like the Ps and Qs) are interesting enough to satisfy your loser teetotaling friend (kidding, buddy!). May want to consider sticking with cocktails for your meal, because there were less than 10 or so wines under $100, which is an issue.The restaurant arrangements are going to be my only major quibble. We definitely got seated in ""dammit this is a three top taking up a four top"" zone, right in front of the fireplace. Meaning it was HOT. Very hot. Sweaty hot. I get the need to jam as many tables as possible, but c'mon.Oysters - definitely east coast oysters, though they weren't identified by name. Slightly overpriced, but large, juicy, and perfect for slurping while making eyes at your date...or at your two married companions where they have like, ""a problem"" with you wearing a nametag that says ""Third Wheel"" on it.Lobster on Half Shell - perfectly cooked cold lobster, apples, fennel, little touch of some emulsion, perfect seasoning. Gonna go ahead and say a must order.Risotto - I'm not going to lie, I think I missed out a bit given the uni is no longer on the risotto menu (I get it, but still). The risotto was highly flavorful, though a tad overcooked (not toothsome and soupy like I prefer), but that was a minor issue. The fried sweetbreads were fantastic, and as usual, an utter surprise to the non-organ folks who think they're eating sublime chicken nuggest. This is why you need Third Wheel. He'll show you his thymus gland.Pigeon Pie - I think the restaurant misses out on not making this an entree. It should be three times the size, with a full lobe of foie and a full filet of game bird. It's hard to discern the flavors because it's so small, and I would 100% order an entree-size of this. It's game bird, crust, and foie. The only thing anyone could want is more.Duck A l'Orange - Intense portion of perfectly cooked duck, thick demi glace orange coating that means Third Wheel is going to lick your plate clean. Second only to Le Philosophe in recent memory.Roast - The other sign, besides the pigeon, the the chef is British. It's a well-cooked roast, with a delightful yorkshire pudding, and then a large pile of throwaway cabbage (eat only the crispy outer coating). The box around this item makes me feel like this is a very cheap moneymaker for the restaurant. Skip. Instead, getBurger - Holy crap, bruh, this burger is unctuous as FAAAAHCK. Edges out Bowery Meat for best new high end burger. Mineral finish, cheddar so sharp I'd use it to cut my enemies, powerful kick of bacon, and I don't know what Churchill sauce is, but I bet it would sober Churchill up immediately. Get this. Get two.Pistachio Souffle - intense as F souffle, double the size of the ramekin, with a strong eggy component that most places cook right out of the dish. Fantastic.Concord Grape and Goat Cheese gelato - Get this if you want super strong flavors. I'd have a spoonful goat cheese ice cream every night before bed. I'm going to buy a goat for this purpose, and also so I can bring it along instead of being Third Wheel next time.Petit Fours are nothing special (some cookies, some brittle), but totally enjoyable and a nice bonus.I can see this being a big hit for the corporate Eleven Madison Park spillover lunch crowd, but it's definitely a date spot, a Mom's birthday spot, and, you know it, an ideal place to bring your Third Wheel.",10,13,7,Brady B.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",18,62,48

5.0,11/17/2015,"Easily a top 5 meal in NYC. Food, cocktails, service, and ambiance all top notch. Ambiance is great. The Clocktower is located in the former executive office suite for MetLife. Love the separate dining rooms and bar area. Cocktails are magnificent and creative. American Cereal Killer (Michter's, Cheerios Milk, Madagascan Vanilla syrup and bitters) is unlike any cocktail ever had, and that doesn't even include the fact that it's served in a glass milk carton.  Great presentation and tastes even better.Meal was impeccable. For starters, wife and I split the poached and smoked salmon and the mac 'n cheese.  Salmon was a beautiful piece of fish. Great smokiness paired perfectly with grapes, walnut and celeriac.  Mac 'n cheese was the most elevated Mac 'n cheese you'll find. Thick cut pasta, creamy cheese, mushrooms and ox cheek. Delish. Oh, and the IPA Beer bread - insanely good.For mains, we split the venison and the duck. Can't say I eat venison often, but this was far and away the best I've had. Perfectly cooked. The spiced plum sauce was delicious, and all paired perfectly with the cabbage and carrots. The granola balls were a tad tough on the teeth, but once cracked open, added another layer of texture and complexity to the dish.  The duck was also perfectly cooked and the sauce l'orange, turnips, fennel and endive all came together wonderfully.For dessert, had the chocolate mousse. Very, very good. And oh, that Cold Fashioned cocktail. Cold brewed coffee and bourbon - heavenly.Service was fantastic. Warm, friendly, not overly formal.

Pretentious doesn't cover it.We were there to enjoy a good meal by a renowned chef and hadn't expected the restaurant to have such an uptight vibe.  Hurried to the bar by the greeter, it was 45 minutes before we were shown to our table, which is ridiculous by any standards, especially with a reservation.  The table next to us were busy taking drunken photos of an apple pie and everyone else seemed to be sneering at each other or sticking their nose into a martini.  We took a quick look at the menu (which was expensive but had some great looking dishes), but it's not a foodies place right now. We got up and left. The concierge desk were horrified and wanted to know why we were leaving, (too little customer service, too late). Apart from the long wait to be seated, we couldn't explain why we didn't want to be there - something just felt off.  If they keep the venue as a bar, I'm sure it will be hugely successful into the future, but if it maintains that it's a restaurant, too many people will be put off by the uneasy crowd and won't return.",4,6,2,Kerry P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,13,1

2.0,10/28/2015,"Wanted to love The Clocktower, but won't be going back. I will say that there were certain things -- things you would consider afterthoughts, like braised cabbage -- that had no business being as delicious as they were. The duck l'orange was beautiful, as were the lobster fennel starter and, later, the milk chocolate crémeux. The whole experience, however, left a bad taste in my mouth. It was our one-year anniversary, for which we had made reservations as in advance as the reservation system allowed. Still, we were sort of deposited into a dark corner (and not in the romantic sense) and routinely disregarded. Several times we had to flag down our server, who would walk past our table and ignore us. When we did order, we were rushed. When we asked for his input, he would throw his hands in the air and say, ""I don't know, I can't say, what's delicious to me might not be delicious to you!"" Um, thanks dude. Our cocktails (which we would have liked to have enjoyed before the meal) didn't arrive until after our first course came to the table. We wanted to order a bottle of wine to accompany our dinner, but by the time we could get someone to take our drink order (and not for lack of trying on our end) our entrees had arrived.Bottom line: there is exquisite food everywhere in the city.

We were excited to try this restaurant since we heard it had the same owner as our other favorite restaurants, Buddakan and Morimoto. We started with the poached then smoked salmon and big eye tuna tataki appetizers. Both of these apps were great but the salmon dish is the reason why I might have to come back to The Clocktower! Really exceptional.Then I had the scallops app for my main dish since I wasn't very hungry and my boyfriend got the North African spiced Colorado lamb. Both of these dishes were tasty but so small. The small portions was a theme the entire night, which is why I had to deduct one star.For dessert we had the chocolate cremeux which reminded me of a ferrero rocher- delicious! I definitely recommend trying this restaurant if you're in the area. The plating could not be more beautiful.

2.0,10/25/2015,"I've caught the Clocktower for drinks a few times, mostly because out-of-towners want to check out the Edition.  The crowd is stuffy.  For instance this past Thursday the pool table was surrounded by four guys wearing Yale baseball caps who probably pay $8 for a cup of coffee.The space is very cool, I have to admit.  I love the photography, both the images and how they layered it throughout all the spaces.  Definitely well executed design.The cocktail menu is overpriced, but not really too different from other establishments of this nature.  The drinks are obnoxiously crafted with stupid add-ons like a mini clothespin holding on a garnish.  Busy bar + slow drinks = points deducted.The actual menu is promising to look at, executed decently, and served at the pace of a snail.  If you want to have the longest dinner of your life, definitely choose Clocktower.  The things we tried:- Dressed crab, crispy uni,apple batons, lemon purée (could have been canned crab)- Diver scallop and hamachi tartare, seaweed pesto, pink grapefruit (pesto overwhelms)- Hand chopped steak tartare, roasted bone marrow, sourdough, pickled artichokes, mustard leaves (not bad, not special)- Tomato salad, tomato gelée, Lioni burrata, basil granita (gelee consistency not for me)- Braised halibut, pink peppercorn sauce, seaweed, chanterelles, carrot purée (pretty good, could go further with the seasoning)- Fries (awesome)My buddy and I agreed that there wasn't a single thing we would order again other than the fries.  I repeat, the fries.  They also have this weird way of serving, where the food runner will come out with trays and stand there with your food and you're thinking ""just put it on the table, this is taking forever"".  It is bizarre.Anyways, I can't say I would go back.  It is overpriced and underdelivered.",3,4,2,Tyler L.,"Manhattan, NY",251,523,1

We started with oyster platter and beef tartare, followed by lamp chop and grilled duck, finished with a apple tart for two to share.

2.0,10/3/2015,"Very mixed feelings because the place is beautifully laid out and there is an unbelievable amount of potential but....at least the night I was there we had too many flaws to consider it a top notch restaurant. First, the service was just terrible. Perhaps it's because we were there late on a Saturday night, but we sat at our table for 15 minutes before anyone came to help us. After that we had a disinterested server who seemed to be mentally checked out. He highly recommended the beef for two and then 15 minutes later a hostess came to tell us ""for the first time ever"" they had run out. She kindly offered to comp us two regular steaks, only to have one of them show up on the bill anyway! The steaks then came out medium well instead of rare. We kept one, sent the other back and a few minutes later had one prepared properly. While the whole concept is surely a lot of fun when the place is firing on all cylinders, it just didn't work for us that night. Fun drinks, cool decor, great ambience.

3.0,9/21/2015,"Reading the reviews and walking up the cocoon-like white circular stairway, my expectations were high, and I was excited for the meal.  The decor was similar to Nomad's but a bit more casual and sparse.  With 3 separate dining rooms, the flow of the space was a bit off - but notwithstanding, let's go to the food and service.Delicious starter bread and butter.  Lobster with fennel and apple was unique and refreshing - perhaps a bit too much vinegar but still tasty.  Tartare was good, the bone marrow taking place of egg yolk.  And then we waited, and waited, and waited some more.  Our hostess, after 20 or so minutes, finally came around and let us know the chef had to re-fire the halibut (could not hear the rationale).  Ten minutes later (water not refilled, picking at the bread without any plates), the food arrived and looked great.  We ordered the fish (tasty), duck (a bit salty but very tender + flavorful), and skirt steak (per Eater's rec).  Down by my side came the bone-in strip steak - not what I ordered, but it looked amazing and was $20+ more.  I was more than happy to keep it, informing the waiter so, but he insisted that I should get what I ordered.  Five minutes later it arrived with a ""thank you"" - not so much an apology for the extra delay or incorrect order, but a simple ""thank you"" - at which I was taken aback.'Strawberries and cream' was not too sweet and a solid ending to the dessert.  In the end, dessert was taken off the bill, but I still felt slighted.  I had really high hopes for the Clocktower, and while the food was solid (once it finally arrived), the service was off, which I would not expect from such a high-pedigree establishment.  Tables around us seemed happy and were receiving their dishes in a timely manner, so to not only have longer wait times AND receive the wrong dish (which I was not allowed to keep!), I felt slighted.  With just one of these issues, I would still recommend highly to friends - but with both, I felt the need to post.Overall, solid meal but the service was mis-aligned.  I'm not a perfectionist, but I feel like there should be certain standards at this type of restaurant.  Give it a try - hopefully you'll have a better experience than me.",2,0,0,James T.,"San Francisco, CA",23,16,0

Nice touch.For starters we had  the scallops and the steak tartar which were both great but the Pigeon and foie gras pie might be trying a little to hard .For entrée I ordered the  spiced Colorado lamb . Dam you lamb in America why is it such a challenge . At $ 43 for 2 small lamb chops you better be good . Sadly they were a little chewy and tasted more fatty than spiced . Now the Dry Aged burger, be a bit rude not to after reading the  amazing reviews. Ordered medium rare but sadly it was served well done .Of course it was whisked away with an apology and then served again to perfection but to add insult  they even charged me for new fries even though I sent them away and they were given to another table next to us .The dessert of strawberries and cream is must , oh and those little berries are frozen blackberries broken down to mini berries . 100% my highlight of the meal .Still I see this place being a winner as its a much a scene as it is a restaurant .Oh don't be put off if you call up for a reservation  and cant get one , I went straight on open table and got it after a negative telephone conversation with someone that assured me there wasn't any available .I will be back even if its for a cheeky burger and a cereal killer !",8,4,1,John B.,"New York, NY",781,380,697
5.0,9/12/2015,"So, I read a lot of reviews and had somewhat high expectations going in, so already that is a recipe for disappointment. But none the less, I was still blown away.  This is only my second 5 star rating for a restaurant. The restaurant is on the second floor above the lobby of the hip Edition Hotel, so we entered the building to a cool lobby bar scene before heading up the spiral staircase to the restaurant. The second floor is the former executive floor for the Metropolitan CEO back from the Mad Med era with beautiful dark wood detail and fireplaces in several rooms, all with hundreds of nouveau framed photographs to bring it to modern hip.    Our night started with a few signature drinks at the bar. I had the Cold Fashioned which was an interesting adaptation of an old fashioned with coffee and really good. My wife and friend had the Cobblerplolitan, which tasted nothing like a traditional Cosmo, but was delish.  We were seated and given the obligatory bread, and while the bread was good ( way better than average)  the butter was like a drug.  I could not get enough.  We ordered an assortment of appetizers and main courses and every dish delivered.  Of course we tried tar tar, how could we not, and as reported, it was excellent. For a main, I had the lamb chops which were tender and had an excellent sauce.  My buddy got the burger ( I was a little jealous) and reported it was one on the best 5 burgers he had ever had.  I got a taste of the fries, and despite some negative reviews, we all thought they were great.  Moving on to desert, we ordered the apple tarte tatin and it was amazing.  We were all served an individual portion of vanilla ice cream to go along.  There was not a bite left, I made sure of that.  And then, of course, the cookies that were served at the end. This is a nice touch, even if they are just ok, but the shortbread cookies melted in your mouth....and the caramel / toffee candies with sea salt ( I am guessing) were amazing.   And finally, not that some will think it is s big deal, the coffee was amazing, even for a Starbucks snob like me.  So often restaurants fail here and at such a critical part of the meal. As far as service goes, it does not get much better.  Bryn, who is also a sommelier in training, was engaging and at our beckon call, and made some excellent recommendations.  As a plus, we were by chance seated next to an A-list celeb, so that put a little icing on an already legendary night.  I have to come back, if for nothing else, to try that burger.  It is a bit pricy, especially the cocktails, but you are getting what you pay for, unlike so many overpriced average hip but not-so-hip places.

I have to say it lived up to that rating and some. From the minute you enter you know this is going to be an experience. From the decor to the well dressed attentive wait staff (I believe we had a total of three waiters serving our table for two!) this place is exceptional. I had the aged burger and fries which you can see a picture of elsewhere on this page and let's just say I have never seen a burger and fries served so artistically. The beer was served in a silver tankard (nice touch) and I chose the strawberry custard dish for dessert - also presented like a work of art.There were also complimentary desserts delivered in a little box at the end of the meal.The ambiance was perfect, the wait staff attentive but not smothering (for me there is nothing worse than wait staff who keep coming over asking you how everything is!).I didn't pay too much attention to prices as I wasn't picking up the tab but my companion's face didn't turn ashen at the bill so I presume it is moderately priced:)All in all an amazing experience and yes I will return probably at Christmas time.",0,0,0,Lee P.,"New York, NY",288,122,4

I believe that the decoration is spot on, the menu promises enchanting dishes but falls short of the promise and I can definitely find a more attentive service at a McDonalds. I ordered the Uni risotto which was well balanced in terms of flavor and the consistency was right on point, a great opening for sure; my next course was the North African spiced lamb which was flavorless and with more fat than meat, not what you expect for a $42 entree. The waiter was lost in space, I had to chase him down to order wine and he managed to drop the plates on the table without even explaining the dish or ask if I needed anything else. At the end I decided to skip dessert, just to avoid interacting with someone that clearly doesn't understand the basic rules of service, and move on to do better things with my life.The Clocktower might be a hot spot in the city, but if they fail to deliver on the food and service on balanced proportions they might have a very cold season ahead.",1,0,0,Eduardo F.,"Houston, TX",0,6,3

The skate had a muddy taste, but I think that's just the nature of the skate and not the chef. For dessert, the pistachio soufflé was excellent. The pistachio essence is not a sauce, but is whipped into the egg white before baking, so the soufflé turned out a beautiful green color. Minor complaints: our waiter was very amateur (seemed nervous and took orders from the guys at the table first) and the coffee arrived really slow (after the entrees).",1,0,0,Lisa Z.,"New York, NY",0,9,1
4.0,9/3/2015,"Clocktower is so desperately seeking that Michelin star (or two)... but chef Jason isn't there just yet. The food was amazing and the dishes were very well thought out. Acclaim should go to the saucier - all the sauces we tried were out of this world. The proteins were just a tad overcooked (that goes for the halibut and rabbit). And there were a lot of servers, but not whole lot of service - we definitely felt unattended at times when we wanted small things from the staff (such as ordering a second drink before our entrees came out, and not halfway through them). Overall, I would highly recommend Clocktower - the experience, food, ambiance are all worth the dining experience.",0,0,0,Ron M.,"Manhattan, NY",10,124,20
4.0,8/31/2015,"My friend surprised me by taking me here for my birthday dinner. I've secretly been wanting to come here for brunch so brownie points for him for picking this place. Let me start off with the decor: This lovely restaurant is located in the Edition hotel on the 2nd floor. I love restaurants that have that dark, woody atmosphere-such a mysterious vibe. They have several rooms all named after different colors- or so my dinner companion informed me. Not sure if it's true since I didn't go exploring. Now onto the food- we started with the scallops and the steak tartar. His scallops were really yummy, I wish I'd gotten it. The tartar to me was so so. I've definitely had better. He got a gigantic roast for his entree and I stuck with the salmon. Both had good flavors. He noticed that the chef left off the mashed potatoes from his dish. The waiter took care of that and gave him a separate side of mashed potatoes. We shared the apple tart for dessert. It was HUGE. I wish it came with a larger ice cream portion though. I'm definitely coming back here for brunch though. It's what I've been craving for this entire time.",0,0,0,Lisa C.,"New York, NY",236,274,156

4.0,8/10/2015,"Had dinner here this past Saturday. Was expecting more given its (current) 4.5 star rating, which in Yelp terms puts it with the likes of Per Se, Le Bernadin, Eleven Madison Park, etc. My experience definitely places The Clocktower a tier below those restaurants.Food: 3 to 4.5 star range -(3 stars) Appetizers we ordered were average. I wasn't impressed with the favorably reviewed uni risotto or steak tartare. I mean, steak tartare with bone marrow? That should be ""blow you away"" delicious. I've definitely had better steak tartare elsewhere. The uni risotto bordered on fishy for me and the consistency didn't seem quite right.-(4 stars) We were relieved that both of our entrees were a major step up and we thoroughly enjoyed them. The duck was delicious and cooked to a perfect temperature. The mac and cheese with oxcheek was a sort of deconstructed mac and cheese...unexpected and amazingly flavorful.-(4.5 stars) Dessert was another highlight...strawberries and cream lived up to the hype. Service: 3.5 stars-Didn't quite have the service experience I was expecting from this caliber restaurant. But the hostess was welcoming and on point. She ""got us started in the bar"" and we enjoyed the Dill or No Dill cocktail. We didn't have to wait too long...just enough to check out the decor/tons of pictures and sip our drinks.-Server was nice but not stuffy. Things got a little discombobulated though. I saw them start to bring over our entrees but stop because our silverware hadn't been replaced. Things like that. Not enough to ruin a meal or anything, I would never be that dramatic, but I just noticed some of the little things that at top tier restaurants are seamless and thus not even noticeable.-Drinks took a very long time and we had to reorder a drink that never arrived. Unless there was another bar I didn't see, they only had two bartenders servicing what had to be like 75 people between the entire restaurant and bar room.Ambiance: 5 stars-Perfectly executed decor and experience, without seeming cheesy or ""theme-y""...the spiral staircase leading up to the restaurant, as if through the actual Clocktower, was the perfect introduction. All in all, not sure I'll return, at least not in the near future. Maybe in a year or so once the kinks are ironed out.

The complimentary desserts were delicious and such a nice touch. The salted caramel melted in my mouth. - /Service sucked.We had our drink orders taken. A minute later, another gentleman asked for our drink orders. We said thank you - but we just put them in. He seemed annoyed, didn't say anything, raised his eyebrows and walked away. We laughed it off. Time to order. I asked how big the Gazpacho was because I was considering getting that and a salad for lunch instead of one larger dish. The dry answer: ""it's an appetizer."" Really? I can read and didn't see it was under ""starters,"" how'd you know? Thanks. So I just went with the salad. For two salads, two appetizers, and espresso, our business lunch took 2.5 hours because we had to wait so long for the check. Being a new ""hot spot"" in town I would have understood if it was as bustling as one would expect, but it was pretty dead. Maybe they were annoyed we weren't a big ticket table and wanted to freeze us in their blasting A/C in retaliation. I don't know. Not impressed.

4.0,7/28/2015,"KenScale: 8.5/10British cuisine has always been neglected in the gastronomic world, falling way behind French, Spanish and Italian counterparts in the rankings of European cuisine. I've never heard about people going to London for culinary journey, and I haven't seen any place in NYC that really shows what British cuisine is all about. That changed recently when acclaimed English chef Jason Atherton formed a partnership with a famed restrauteur Stephen Starr to open The Clocktower inside the chic Edition hotel. I was overall very pleased with the dining experience on a recent Friday night. There is nothing fussy about the food at The Clocktower. They seem somewhat predictable if you just skim through the menu. The level of execution and balance of flavor and texture of most dishes, however, were on a very high level. I could eat lobster with shaved fennel, mussel and apple salad every day for my meal. Lobster was perfectly cooked with crunchy texture to my delight, and the unexpected combination with apple salad worked quite nicely. While I was expecting a bit more spice from North African spiced Colorado lamb, it still was a perfectly cooked lamb dish that wasn't overpowering in seasoning to my liking. Some dishes fell somewhat flat. I was puzzled why uni risotto with peekytoe crab tasted a bit on the sour side, and thought it would've been a perfect dish if not for that sour seasoning. Braised halibut was perfectly cooked and created intense flavor with pink peppercorn sauce. I did like the spicy kick from the sauce, but felt the seasoning could've still been toned down a bit. Both desserts that I tried, on the other hand, were marvelous. I've never had pistachio-flavored soufflé before, and the combination of the soufflé with chocolate ice cream was pure bliss, with silky smooth texture of warm soufflé working wonders with the cold sensation of ice cream. ""Strawberries and cream"" dessert that consisted of vanilla custard, olive oil cake and verjus sorbet was also quite delightful with its elegant flavor without being too sweet. The Clocktower is one of the hottest spots these days (not just for food but for its throwback-style décor that would make for a hip and pleasant dining experience), so make sure to book early. I loved the classy yet energetic vibe coming from the restaurant. The restaurant has full bar menu (with some creative cocktails coming from the bar area next to the dining space). The Clocktower is a welcome addition to the New York dining scene with its introduction to what sophisticated British cuisine would look like.",2,0,0,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738

5.0,7/21/2015,"fantastic new upscale place in NYC. immediately rocketed up my list of favorite restaurants for a splurge.the space itself is really nice; up a spiral staircase to 3 dining areas, a billiard room, and a bar. early 20th century paneling and mirrors give a really warm old school new york feel, which is only enhanced by the plethora of b&w photos, ranging from NYC scenes to celebrities, crowding the walls. it's a compelling mix of casual and elegant. we arrived early, and went to the bar for cocktails while we waited. lovely marble bar, small without feeling crowded. 1st thing the bartender did was ask if we were waiting for a table, and when we said yes, she took our name, so they could watch for when our table was ready. this was the first indication of how well thought out their service is. meghan had a gin/lemon/dill cocktail that was bright and grassy, i had a rum/maple thing that was comforting without being heavy. yum. it was a birthday dinner, so we pulled out all the stops (as if we don't usually pull out all the stops). we started with a dozen oysters, 3 east coast varieties. all super fresh and tasty. for appetizers we had an salad -English breakfast radishes, salad leaves, cucumbers, feta and pistachio purée, that was capricious and playful, with an unexpected citrus gelee, and a mini pigeon pie with , Waldorf salad, celeriac,& sauce diable. this was recommended by our waiter, and it was tremendous. maybe the best single taste of the night. they also have an uni risotto and a steak tartar with marrow and mustard leaves that i really want to go back and try.for our mains we had Macaroni and cheese, with morels & slow-cooked ox cheek, which is more delicious that it sounds, and it sounds delicious. the macaroni was a large rigatoni sort of pasta, which allowed the cheese to line its inside surface in a very delightful way, and we had Rabbit and foie gras w/ Lancashire hotpot, heritage carrots, Parma ham, & tarragon oil. this was really 2 dishes, slightly disconnected by the plating, but that's a minor quibble when compared to just how delicious it was. the 1st part was rabbit loin and foie gras rolled together, and wrapped with prosciutto cotto, on a plate with carrots and some bitter greens (i love carrots with rabbit - it's so what's up doc) and next to it was a tall ramekin with rabbit and small sliced potatoes in a deep rich sauce. The menu has a duck breast that is supposed to be really good, real dover sole, and an interesting looking lamb with N. African spices. (yes i plan on going back and trying all this stuff, at some point)we had a bottle of Lo Vièlh Carignan - from Le Clos du Gravillas in Languedoc. not overly complex, really smooth and drinkable. the wine list is pretty extensive (and expensive) herefor dessert we had ""Strawberries and cream""- vanilla custard, olive oil cake, verjus sorbet, which was excellent, fresh and creme and a great light dessert, and Grapefruit sorbet, curd and suprèmes, hazelnut streusel, fennel marmalade, which was really bright, if slightly disjointed.the service was smooth, and proper, without ever feeling stuffy or staid. the staff was well trained, friendly, and everyone was open to help out, and check on how it was going. for a restaurant that is only 2 months all, the kinks are remarkably well worked out, and they are clearly hoping to build a following. i hope they do, this place deserves to last.TL;DNR - lovely room, great food, excellent service. not cheap, but well worth the splurge",2,0,0,matthew h.,"New York, NY",235,211,3

Wine list definitely pricey, but a really nice list and settled on a lovely French red which didn't completely break the bank. (Extra points for having my fave rose, which is from a small producer in Italy.) Food was excellent. Scallops and tuna tartar to begin. Scallops served alongside cauliflower accompaniments and the tuna was served as bite sized pieces w/cucumbers. Both delicious. Skirt steak was a nice size and cooked perfectly (and eaten on really nifty plates w/skulls on them). Came w/great chips (fries) and a side salad. Pork chop was big and juicy, served w/delicious beets. Strawberries and cream for dessert...very different interpretation...light, yet decadent.  Complimentary cookies (shortbread was so yum!) are served in an old fashioned tin when the check arrives.

And a huge huge shoutout to the general manager who was so wonderful and attentive and to Bryn who made our entire experience 10x better. Unlike many other top notch restaurants that have very rigid staff, the staff at this restaurant has the perfect balance of elegance and friendliness. Now onto the food... WOW. Appetizers: Steak Tartare - Yes, this wonderful dish comes with bone marrow. If you didn't think steak tartare could get any better, you are mistaken. This was perfect. Asparagus - This dish was heavenly. You have the consistency of the egg perched on top of the asparagus mixing with the chicken thigh and the result is pure bliss. Add on the chicken jus that is poured on top from a chicken container, and you have the perfect dish.Entrees:The Duck - Ohhh that wonderful, wonderful duck. Cooked to perfection. There is nothing else to say but yes.Macaroni and Cheese - This dish comes with Ox Cheek, you read that correctly.. ox cheek. The balance of the meat with the pasta and cheese was incredible. This is definitely a dish that you must try!Desserts: Strawberries + Cream - delicious! light, fluffy and airy - this dessert was a perfect ending to a perfect meal. Apple tarte tartin - If you are an apple lover, then look no further. This is it. This is the pinnacle of desserts for you - it will never get better than this. And how about those drinks! Check out the incredible cocktails menu. Our drink came in a milk carton and had bourbon and cheerios milk (yes actual milk from cheerios). It was strong and delicious. Some of the other drinks came with friendship bracelets, glow sticks, etc... What more can be said? This is my new favorite restaurant in NYC and definitely my new go to.

I met my dining companion at the bar and he was already drinking a martini, hey it was 2.  We then were seated in one of two dining rooms in a  sumptuous chartreuse booth and I decided on trying the American Cereal Killer cocktail that comes in the cutest little milk carton glass.  It's a delicious bourbon based cocktail that tastes like a decadent dessert.  I ordered the burger medium rare with chips and my companion had the tuna tataki as he was staying on the liquid diet.  The burger was perfectly cooked and juicy with a great proportion of bacon and cheddar.  The chips were amazing, I'm going to come back for happy hour and have those with cocktails.  His tuna was a nice and light starter.We ordered more cocktails and spent the rainy afternoon gossiping, drinking and eating and enjoying the cozy setting.  As this was a summer weekend, it wasn't packed but the patrons were a mix of hotel guests and mostly late twenties and thirtysomething couples looking for cover on the rainy day.",2,1,3,Sascha M.,"New York, NY",593,822,7

I just love Ian Schrager and the design looks superb. Went for a lunch with a friend. Food is okay, I mean, it's ENGLISH, what can you expect? Portion is small but quality is generally okay. We liked the King Crab and the chips. Skirt steak was nice too. The service, meh. I wouldn't even call it service. I'm not sure if it's because this place is relatively new and the personnel training is still ongoing - we were served by a couple different people and I couldn't figure out who's in charge of us until someone came over asking if the meal is okay. More than 5 waiter/waitress in the dining room serving probably less then 20 ppl and it's a mess. Our waiter kept forgetting the orders - my friend wanted a refill of hot water of her tea, he forgot it and we had to ask another person who was avaiable; when we finished the meal I asked for a coffee and I waited about 10 mins, this person brought us the dessert menu and  did not even ask if we'd like to have dessert (I already ordered coffee!!!), just laid down the menu on the table and walked away, without even talking to us! How rude!I asked, again, another lady to bring me a cup of coffee. Coffee is good, then, I asked, with my best patience, if I could get a refill...he said yes and forgot to refill me, for a THIRD TIME IN A ROW. Then I was pissed, very much. I just couldn't believe what we've experienced. I'd like to believe he's just new to the place. But again, if this was the case, I wouldn't put this person on duty. The two stars, one for the deco/design; half for the kind people who helped - a lady who looks like the manager was very nice and there was another gentleman who's been helping all the time; half for the food. But I am not going back. This is a restaurant affiliated to a 5 star hotel and it is certainly not the service I'd expect.

It is perfect setup for a first date or a business dinner. To start, I went with the American Cereal Killer. An innocent looking drink with a deadly punch! Made of Mitcher's whiskey.\, cheerios milk, Madagascan vanilla syrup , angostura bitter, served in a cute milk carton. It is easy to sip at first and potent after taste. Not a girly drink and I love it! Onto the food. We got the uni risotto with peekytoe crab, bottarga and zesty yuzu peel. It is creamy and savory , the citrus flavor from yuzu really stands out and a good contrast. But somehow not as harmonious as I hope. Prob better decorated with nori instead?Come along the risotto, roasted diver scallops, ragout of line caught squid, crepe , bacon in celery root purée. It is savory tho a tad too salty to my taste. The scallops are perfectly cooked, soft and juicy.Again, not bottom-shaking but it is well executed. Fave tonight! Long Island duck, sauce l'orange with fennel, endive and salt baked turnips . It is amazing. The bird is cooked medium rare while the skin is crisp, the muscle is juicy and scrumptious. The sauce is fragrant and just the right sweetness and consistency. The turnips are the best part which soaked up the #duck juice and sauce. Beautiful presentation. Service is attentive and each dish was introduced in details. That's what fine dining should be.Considering my office is close by, I will stop by every now and then, even just for drinks.",3,1,2,Nomad M.,"New York, NY",126,298,1138

4.0,6/7/2015,"This beautifully decorated restaurant was a delicious brunch experience. Aside from a miscommunication with the server which I didn't deduct stars since they remedied it appropriately but removing an item off the bill, we had a nice dining experience. The bread which isn't served for brunch is delicious. Served pipping hot, it has a hint of sweetness to it. The butter served on a wooden hair pick is velvety smooth. The steak tartare is very flavorful. They take a bone marrow and scrape it right on top of the steak tartare. Yum!The burger is very good. We ordered it medium rare. The condiments of thinly slicked pickle, lettuce, red onion and their sauce stayed well in place surprisingly so it wasn't a sloppy meal. The king crab sandwich is buttery good with a creamy bisque like spread. The fried are amazing; perfectly crisp and thick. They end your meal with complementary dessert consisting of marshmallow, butter cookie, chocolate peanut toffee and caramels- all homemade!",0,0,0,Donna V.,"New York, NY",221,288,328
5.0,6/5/2015,A great new restaurant in the city. The scene is definitely hot and loud. The decor clubby with interesting retro photographs. Service is attentive but not intrusive. The scallops were perfectly cooked and tasty. Cornish fish stew was like a deconstructed bouillabaisse featuring tasty bits from the sea. The portion could have been a little bigger. The pistachio soufflé with chocolate sorbet was amazing. Light with a nutty fragrant finish and then rich chocolate to balance it off. Overall outstanding.,0,0,0,Lawrence C.,"Jamesville, NY",0,10,14
5.0,5/30/2015,"Wow Wow Wow!!!! I love Edition hotels, I have been to them in Istanbul and Miami, I have to say this is by far my favorite one!  The lounge downstairs has a cozy fire and the bar is just perfect. Ok, enough with the hotel...it's all about Clocktower for this reviewWe walked up the circular staircase to the restaurant and  the moment I saw it, I was in love. I really appreciate how they divide the dining rooms, this means less noise and more intimacy. There is also a bar to the side, which looks like great date spot!The food was simply amazing, I had the white asparagus as an appetizer and only let my boyfriend have 1 bite.....I'm selfish when it is that good : )My entree was the lamb and it was cooked to perfection. My boyfriend had the filet  mignon and he was very silent while eating....which means he loved it.Wine list is grand and eclectic. 2 thumbs upMy only complaint is do not come here if you are very tired, the dark lighting and dark wood design/smell may make you drowsy. Maybe i'm totally off on this remark, but i did find myself yawing a few times, an espresso fixed that though!I highly recommend eat, drink and enjoy!",2,0,0,Julia G.,"Miami, FL",17,28,0
3.0,5/27/2015,"Came here four days into the opening of this restaurant, my friend knew about it but due to low advertising, I hadn't heard of it. I really liked the vibe, the photos on the wall and the dim lite. Standouts would be the service and steak tartare with bone marrow. Oysters come out looking nice but they werent extraordinary, scallop crudo was a bit fishy to me. Nice touch is a tin box at the end that reminds you of Grandmas house and is filled with various goodies. Bravo-lebritisa and celebs were there during my time. I would love to come back for the tartare and sit at the bar.",0,0,0,Taylor P.,"Manhattan, NY",385,247,426
2.0,5/27/2015,"In all fairness, this place is just getting it's legs so I'll try and go easy.The staff is very nice. Was hour wait so we grabbed a drink in the bar. Only one drink as the bartender takes about 20 min. per concoction, but the waitress was very nice and exchanged the adventurous ""pollos hermanos"" drink I tried and didn't like at all.Personally, the appetizers were my favorite. Although they took an eternity, as did the mains, the lobster salad was great and the tuna tataki was even better. I would suggest they add a little ponzu or similar to the lobster salad, as we were dipping it in the tuna sauce and not the mayo it came with.Again, took about an hour for our entrees to arrive and the place wasn't that crowded around 930. We were fine waiting but man they better get that time cut in half!I ordered the salmon rare and it came out medium/well. A very nice piece but I was not impressed at all with the ""parsely chowder."" I'm not a fan of mint flavors in my food and this had a hint of mint so it was a bit of a downer. A mustard or champagne sauce would be much better.The lamb was cooked great but again I was not impressed by the sauce. Call me crazy, but I like what I like and this place - at least for now - misses the mark with those two dishes and the really long waits. However, the grapefruit sorbet is to die for and the waiter brought out all 6 flavors for us to try due to the long wait time so that was nice. the combo chocolate and vanilla are awesome, too.",2,0,0,David F.,"Jersey City, NJ",608,217,11
5.0,5/25/2015,"Beautiful and classy restaurant with immaculate dishes.Cote de boeuf - a delicious bone-in ribeye cut with fatty, marbled, and bone-in sections. Bone marrow jus was the perfect complement to this steak, without overpowering the natural flavors at all. Grilled garlic was a great touch. Tip: pair with the Grenache red for an awesome experience. Colorado lamb - cooked to perfection, ideal tenderness. So tasty on its own and even better with the innovative combination of condiments and vegetables on the plate - eggplant, yoghurt, curried onions, perhaps cucumber and a rich sauce?King Salmon - the salmon was also cooked perfectly. Crispy skin and firm exterior with a ""medium rare"" interior than almost melted in your mouth. I don't like peas much. But the black garlic purée was a great addition.Roasted sea scallops - one heck of an appetizer. There were so many good ideas in this dish and it all came together in a blaze of gastronomic delight. Lobster salad - I don't know how but the apple slices complemented the light, fresh taste of the lobster excellently. Not the typical heavy butter taste.Steak tartare - tasty. Their thin bread crisp puts a spin on the traditional toast.The restaurant has a classy, dark wood interior and boasts a pool room next door to boot. Great for brushing up on your pool skills whilst waiting for apps.",0,0,1,Joseph O.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,8,0
5.0,5/24/2015,"Uhhhh....yes yes and did I mention YES?Friends of mine were visiting from Miami (where there is also an Edition Hotel) for MDW and informed me that an Edition Hotel opened in NYC recently and that they wanted to have dinner there. I had no expectations and was blown away.The staff was welcoming, knowledgeable, and actually acted like they enjoyed working there. I hope that over time this won't fade...+ My water was constantly re-filled throughout the night and the staff seemed on point. AmbianceDark wood and perfect lighting. Need I say more? Very romantic vibe yet also could see business dinners conducted here. There are two rooms directly next to each other but yet separated so each room feels very intimate. We sat next to Fredrik Eklund (from Million Dollar Listing) so I assume a lot of ""celebrities"" will be pouring into this hotel.Wine+ They have great options for all price points. I was really surprised at the range. I wasn't let down as I had the Austrian wine (Gruner Vetliner, which I seem to find on every menu in NYC which leads me to ask who the hell is their wine rep?!) and it was yummy yet very inexpensive. FoodI ordered a salad to start. I can't remember the exact name of the salad and can't seem to find their menu anywhere online but basically it was just a mixed green salad with a light yet fruity vinaigrette dressing. The salad was excellent. I'm not usually a fan of paying a large amount of money to eat lettuce and I seem to always find that the dressing portion applied to salads are either too heavy or too light.Thiswasperfect.A really light and refreshing way to start my meal. I would say this is a MUST ORDER.I followed the salad with the uni risotto despite it being listed as an appetizer. I was still a bit hungry after the salad and risotto but not too bad. I wasn't in the mood for a huge entree and wanted a smaller portion for dinner as I had a late lunch. It was quite tasty and I would definitely order it again. It was a tad too creamy for my taste (I'm lactose intolerant yet still consume a lot of dairy, don't ask) but nonetheless was very good. My friends had the filet mignon (which was cooked perfectly) and the chicken (which she loved).+ I was impressed with how on point the experience was from start to finish despite it being a brand new restaurant.I definitely will throw this restaurant into my rotation!",5,2,3,Melanie A.,"Manhattan, NY",1284,565,388
5.0,5/21/2015,"Recently opened, this is a new restaurant from the Starr Group.  It is in the Edition Hotel at the clocktower of the former Met Life building at 5 Madison Park.  The space is paneled with an eclectic gallery of photographs of artists and celebrities.  The music is trendy.  The Goldleaf bar is a half round bar next to the  Pool table and is warm and inviting.  Service was good and very friendly.  Drinks range from 8-16 for the most part.   Dinner was in adjacent rooms with similar sort of decor.  One room has a fireplace.  Service was over the top and very accommodating and attentive.  Food was excellent and presentation was great.  I tried a few dishes including the lobster, the risotto and the radish salad.  I also ordered the bone in Sirloin Steak.  While all the dishes were very good the Uni Risotto was a stand out.    The Steak was perfectly cooked and very tasty.   Prices are on par with fine dining restaurants.  This is a wonderful place to go for a romantic dinner or a business dinner or just a drink after work.  Definitely they are going for the Michelin star so time will tell.   Check it out before it gets too busy.",0,0,0,Raymond P.,"New York, NY",14,267,29
5.0,5/18/2015,"We were there on opening night. I understood that they already had a soft opening . We had 6:30 dinner reservations and got there a few minutes early. They offered us a seat at the bar and then actually seated us at a small tall table within the bar area. We ordered drinks, and before the cocktail waitress made it back to our table, the restaurant hostess came to tell us our that our table was ready and they would bring the drinks to our table in the restaurant. We sat down and our delicious drinks were delivered in less than a minute. A word about the decor. It's a beautiful place with art on all the walls up to the ceiling. There are two bar rooms, one with a pool table. It would and probably will be a nice place for drinks only without actually dining. By the way, maybe because it was their first night, but it looked to me like there were twice as many workers as needed, thus the over the top service. Food: scallop appetizer, for my wife and chilled lobster for me. Both very good and adequate portions. 14 oz. NY strip for me and lamb chops for her. Done to perfection and very flavorful. Apple tart with vanilla ice cream for two to finish our meal. Note this is a nice place and the food was great, we were there for almost two hours and yet the check came to $203.00 before the tip. Not a bad deal for Saturday night in New York City. Upon leaving my wife asked me if we could come back next week.",3,2,4,Charles L.,"New York, NY",922,197,3277
5.0,5/16/2015,"Came on the opening night.  Ambience, service and food are all amazing.  The cocktails are creative,  nice and more importantly, taste great.  We were seated in the American Room.  Started with the American Cereal Killer cocktail which is Bullet Burbon and milk and Give Peas A Chance cocktail.Starters were Steak Tartare...probably one of the best I have had in a long time and Uni Risotto. Main was Pork Belly and Bone Marrow as well as Cornish Fish Stew. We will definitely return!",4,1,1,Lenny H.,"New York, NY",12,25,210
