4.0,4/23/2019,I had a lovely lunch here today the food was yummy with a nice presentation.  My favorite dish was the salmon avocado hand roll  with a refreshing green tea. Please note I had a very good green salad with Miso dressing which is standard in a Japanese restaurant.  I am rating this place four stars as I was good mood and I love the bathroom. They were those w/c types with privacy and clean which is major statement to me how the owners cherish their restaurant.,0,0,0,Heather R.,"New York, NY",5,49,8
3.0,4/23/2019,"Super great food!! Beautiful interior including the restroom. Young female staff by the front desk were very rude and didn't seem to care about various customers' concerns or questions. It was odd since they are the very first point of contact and first impression of the restaurant when you enter. The saving grace here was the female with glasses. It really is a super place to dine (5 stars), but you seriously get rubbed the wrong way as soon as you enter. Customers should never be treated that way especially without cause.",0,0,0,Michelle B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,13,3

4.0,3/27/2019,"True to its name, mostly sushi with some cooked options. For pre-theater dining close to most Broadway theaters, the happy hour menu until 6pm weeknights -- including poke tuna and salmon, California rolls, chicken wings, and tempura cauliflower -- is a great value. Reservations are recommended during the intermission between Harry Potter shows across the street, when the dining room is packed. A refreshing alternative to the chains of Times Square.",0,0,0,Catherine C.,"Brooklyn, NY",258,89,46
3.0,3/24/2019,"Came with a groups of 7 and were told that we would be able to split the check with 5 credit cards and the rest cash. Perfect. But when we got our check, our server Junita was quite short and rude and told us to just write our individual totals just on the one receipt and spent 15 minutes just trying to do the math and figure out how to divide everything correctly with tax and gratuity and what not. Not really the best method. The food was delicious and the price was reasonable, too bad we left with a sour taste in our mouths.",1,0,0,Sarah G.,"Aylesford Place, Lexington, KY",140,1,0
3.0,3/17/2019,"The food was good but nothing exceptional. The quality of fish didn't seem to be any better than what we get in N.C., which is surprising as this is NYC. The service left a lot to be desired several times food that was not meant for our table was in the process of being set down and we had to stop it.  While our glasses stayed full we didn't see our waiter much for the little things like when we ran out of soy sauce.",0,0,0,Kellie B.,"Moyock, NC",0,33,47
3.0,3/14/2019,"I was not crazy about the takeout here the last time I ordered but figured I would give it another chance. Once again, it was just ok. The delivery took longer than stated in my original order. I completely understand that restaurants get busy and things happen, but I am not ok with the fact that my food was ice cold when it arrived. This makes me think that this restaurant is maybe not set up well for delivery orders. The king crab dumplings were tasty once I heated them up. I order one of their special sushi rolls (Hell's Kitchen Roll) and I did not really think it had the spicy flavor listed in the description. I love sushi and this was not my favorite roll. Overall, I would suggest ordering delivery from some place else. There are lots of great and efficient sushi restaurants in the city and unfortunately, this one did not quite live up to my expectations.",4,0,1,Cara T.,"Manhattan, NY",1355,53,27
3.0,2/24/2019,"Haru was in close proximity, literally in the back of the Lyric theater so we decided to grab an early dinner here between watching parts one and two of Harry Potter and the cursed child. The food was pretty average, and prices are comparable to restaurants in Times Square. Not the most amazing place to eat, but super convenient and gets the job done. While it wasn't packed while we were here, making a reservation on opentable never hurts.",5,1,2,Ju L.,"Philadelphia, PA",154,228,302

3.0,2/19/2019,"Ok, let's start with what's great... Theatre district location, beautiful dining room, and manageable menu. Some good options, Brussels sprouts, super super spicy pork belly fried rice, tempura, all done very well and came out in a jiffy. The sushi was also pretty good, but took much longer. I wasn't looking to linger around and recognize the dining room was at nearly max capacity, so took my patience pills. We were just under an hour which was about where my patience expires dining with the minions. I know lots of Manhattan places cram them in, and this is a place where you have to become friends with your neighbors a few inches on either side. And you will hear their conversations, and they will hear yours. So nothing to this point knocks them from 4 to 3. Where they failed me was on the rolls. They fell apart upon contact. Take a look at the photo where the chefs are using film on the sushi bar. Clearly not enough hold. And for an uber premium on the basics, this isn't really cool. Regardless, food was good, and I would come back for the other food, but maybe stay away from the sushi.",0,0,0,Frank T.,"Merrick, NY",23,155,258

2.0,2/14/2019,"If there is something that you probably shouldn't order for takeout, it's probably fish. Especially when the fish is $20.I recently ordered Haru through Seamless as I was craving some Japanese food. Order was the miso black cod, king crab fried rice, and miso soup.Cod - This was probably my biggest disappointment as it was pricey and mediocre. At $20, it it one pricey piece of fish. It came on a bed of asparagus and a small cup of miso sauce. The fish was quite over done and the sauce had a heavy alcohol taste to it, not much miso. Rice - the rice was also mediocre at best. Not much seasoning and the crab really didn't shine at all. Soup - I've always had the idea that all miso soup are the same. They all taste the same regardless of where you go and it's always delicious. I can say this is the first where it tasted different, and I'm not for it. It's not bad but it just isn't that miso soup you get at most restaurants that leave you wanting more. Perhaps the food would have been a touch better when dining in. But for my recent experience with the take out, I am left not wanting any.",9,4,7,Park G.,"Quincy, MA",155,242,683
1.0,2/13/2019,"We went here after seeing a matinee. We ordered two hot sakes. One was saki, the other was just hot water. Even the maitre d' tasted it and couldn't believe how such a mistake had been made. This left us with a bad taste in our mouths but we decided to give them a chance. Bad choice. Food was mediocre and to top it off when the waitress brought us the check she said, ""I comped one sake."" We looked at the bill and she did no such thing. I guess she thought that in addition to not noticing the difference between hot water and hot saki, we also wouldn't notice the bill.

Open Table canceled our reservation and we didn't get to the restaurant until 7:15. We were in a huge rush and panicked that we would not be able to eat and make the show. Our reservation was gone and there were no more seats left. The Manager, Niaz saved 4 seats at the sushi bar for us and was waiting for us at the door when we rushed in.

4.0,1/27/2019,"If you're looking for a relatively quiet place to eat near Times Square, away from all the tourist spots, try Haru Sushi.  Food is quite pricey though. But then again, you are in New York City and in Times Square, where it tends to get very expensive.  We had different appetizers and rolls.  They were all very delicious.  Customer service was great, but it also helped that my cousin who was with us regularly went there for business luncheons and knew the staff.",0,0,0,Lynn R.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,28,0

The appetizers were very good, but surprisingly the sushi was just a little above average. Nothing special and overpriced for what it was. Spicy tuna wasn't very spicy or flavorful, and all of the fish just seemed...bland. Even the special dessert tasted like it came from a supermarket.

2.0,12/30/2018,"The 2 star(positive) is simply for the food. Sadly i can not give higher because it will jeaprodize the customer service which was horrendous.  The hostess told us that we would have to be out in an hour because other tables have reservations. Being a manager in the industry I've accepted this because I do understand Friday evenings could be busy. My family came from Florida so I wanted to show them a great sushi spot (my usual spot is in Amsterdam) which is amazing. As we got seated our waitress came over and and asked if we was ready as we started ordering and requesting no salmon sub shrimp (which I do all the time in amsterdame nyc location). After 15 min of waiting the waitress came back and said its $7 upcharge. I didn't understand why. I was more irrirated at the fact we were on this Time Limit yet there was no sense of urgency. Ok at this stage our entrees were put in, we now have 20 min to be out the door as per the hostess. After another 15 min..we ordered rice, lobster rolls and tempura that came out twice before the entree which was chicken n rice. The manager(man with burgundy suit) came over and asked if we are ok and we explained after 40 min we still have no food. He said ""wow that's crazy, i wish we didn't tell people the time"". Wow ok let me go check on the food. The manager never came back to tell us the duration of how long the food will Come out or anything. We kept seeing him walk back and forth as he seemed to be avoiding the table....eventually the food came out.I dont know but this location is not a good representation of what we are use to.

He treated each and every table as if he was their own personal waiter He did an amazing job and for that we tipped him well!!!We started with dumplings and salads which were oversized  and super fresh.

Their selection is pretty much the same across both Harus...They had mixed up our nagiri and sahimi orders which was a bit disappointing to be frank and during a very busy lunch hour, it took far too long for them to fix our order, bring out the corrected versions of our dishes and left us a bit sad in addition to rushing our lunch at that point...Sad because that particular client and I go to the Wall St version quite often - we will stick to that one and will not be going back to this one, unfortunately.

It's like a lot of places these days, the sushi is a bit underplayed to sell more expensive fusion small plates and fancy cocktails.Tempura shrimp were expertly prepared hot and crispy.  The sauce needed seasoning.  Ahi, hamachi, sushi were very good.  Lobster tacos were tasty but not what I expected, maybe because I was raised on Dean Fearings groundbreaking ones at mansion on Turtle Creek in the late 80's. I guess I really just prefer lobster steamed and plain.Pork boa were nicely done but I prefer that pork belly cooked a bit more the render the fat.  Some call it unctuous; I call it unappetizing.  Beer.  Please serve it cold.  With a cold glass.",1,0,0,Texzilla Z.,"Mansfield, TX",2,29,0

It also is a pretty large portion.-ceviche taco: pretty small and not a ton of flavor, I wouldn't recommend -field green salad: really good, especially the dressing. It's not sweet like many other places which makes it so good. -miso soup: very good, but hard to mess up-gramercy Park roll: so good. I especially like the lemon that comes on top because it's something different and refreshing. -spicy titanic roll: I love the salmon, avocado and spicy tuna combo -haru wasabi roll: I love the fresh fish inside (tuna and salmon) and tobiko on the outside -hells kitchen roll: really original roll and a lot of flavors going on but it may be my least favorite I'm really disappointed that they got rid of the symphony appetizer but maybe I just didn't see it on the menu. It was one of my FAVORITES! Also the lunch sushi portion is a little on the small side for how much it costs.

4.0,6/23/2018,"Surprised a coworker here for their birthday and the staff pulled it off amazingly. Before that though, let's talk about the food. I got the Park Avenue roll, and it was delicious. The fish tasted good, but I do wish that the mango on the top was cut a bit thicker so that you could've tasted more of that. The tobiko was great - but if you're not into wasabi, beware the green tobiko that is on half of the roll. It's pretty intense. The gold leaf was adorable, and even though they didn't give a lot, I was still surprised that the roll was only $19. We were in Times Square, so the price for the roll was surprisingly cheap. My coworkers got most of the combos, and they said the food was good. We shared a plate of calamari which was alright. The best thing was the tempura cheesecake that we used to surprise our coworkers with. They put candles in it, and there was coconut on the outside, and this great jam (couldn't really put my finger on the taste though... but definitely not really lychee as it's advertised on the menu).

The others in my party ordered the Teriyaki chicken and the cauliflower tempora.The chicken teriyaki was not liked by either person who ordered it and the portion was small for $23.50 a plate. Wow!!

The ambience and decor was nice but it seemed a little cramped. We were seated in the section with a long booth bench that ran along the wall and chairs on the other side. The tables are so close together that you need to move the entire table to get in or out. The tables in the middle of the room had chairs that backed into the neighboring tables' chairs. I suppose being in Times Square, space is a luxury. Waitress came to take our drink order then disappeared for 15minutes. Our tea came and we were finally able to order. I'm accustomed to having complimentary tea when going to a Japanese restaurant but it seems of late, more and more places are charging for it; $3 an order but though we ordered one for each of us, we were only charged for one. We also received two Miso soups for free. I suspect the waitress was compensating for the lack of service earlier. We had the sushi and sashimi for two as our entree but was not impressed.

Practically in the middle of Times Square! Large layout with plenty of tables. Found it ironic the host asked if I had a reservation when not even a third of the place was full.

He complimented our choices and refilled water as soon as our glasses reached half empty.Drinks all around!

2.0,8/16/2017,"My aunt, my sister and I come to Haru three times a year. Once for each of our birthdays. We've been doing this for about three to four years now. I don't think I've been to any other restaurant in NYC more times than I have Haru. And it's not because the food is great, but it's more out of convenience. At some point, we all worked in midtown, so it was the midpoint for all of our offices. Plus, my aunt was always raving about it so we always just came here by default. Little by little, we've noticed that the quality has been going down. We collectively decided that this past time for my aunt's August birthday was the last time we will go there. There's nothing, or at least no 'last straw', that really triggered this decision, although there was something on my sister's plate that looked like a bug, which the manager kept trying to convince us it was seaweed. (I don't know about you but the seaweed I eat, typically doesn't have legs but OK.) It's really just a mix of things. The quality of the sushi is fine but not great. It's similar to what you would order for takeout sushi, but three times the price. And I know, it's all about the location so for Times Square, you need to expect higher prices. But it just doesn't seem worth it anymore. The quality is not worth the price point that they charge. Especially since we always miss happy hour, which ends ridiculously early at 6.It seems the majority of its patrons are tourists drinking Fiji from a wineglass, or drunken businessmen. Really not the type of experience i'm looking to have.

5.0,7/22/2017,"My first experience with Haru Sushi was during Hurricane Sandy, when they delivered to Cassa Hotel where I was staying during the storm. I've been there many times since for dine-in and takeout, during lunch and dinner. Every experience has been exemplary and their food still delicious after all these years. I preferred the dark, sultry ambiance pre-renovation, with bamboo and Asian touches throughout. After their remodeling a couple years ago, the space is more modern and a bit austere. But they're still an excellent choice for sushi in the Times Square wasteland. For lunch, I always enjoy their salmon teriyaki bento box with brown rice, shrimp kakiage, California roll, and miso soup. For the amount of food, it's a great deal at $20. Their specialty rolls are very good as well, with my favorite being the Spicy Titantic roll - salmon avocado and caviar wrapped around crunchy spicy tuna, which is everything delicious all in one bite. Their sashimi is delicious, you can taste the freshness of the fish, and they know this, so minimal sauces are added to allow the fish to shine.The menu items I would skip are their tempura rolls. The fried seafood roll, shrimp tempura, and vegetable tempura have all been disappointing in the past, tasting like seafood deep-fried to disguise their impending expiration. Fresh is best at Haru, from their eel avocado to the crunchy spicy salmon to their tuna and salmon avocado rolls.

The chicken Katsu was tasty, soft, and crusty. The inauthentic rice that came with was disappointing: flavorless parboiled rice. The dish had a side of mushy eggplant and tasty yam. My friends teriyaki, which was accompanied by rice and rehydrated white raisins, was delicious (his words), but was almost too sweet to be paired with raisins and yam.

It tasted fresh and the wasabi sauce gave it a good kick. Good size for sharing. Specialty roll, Gramercy Park- albacore tuna, salmon, and yellowtail, a hint of spice from the jalapeño balanced with the acidity of the lemon and yuzu miso sauce made a great tasting roll.Tip: heavy pour of alcohol by the bartender",1,0,1,Frances T.,"Manhattan, NY",245,87,440

5.0,4/2/2017,"We were wondering around on a Saturday around 5pm and wanted alcohol & snacks. We started around Bryant Park into Times Square and found most places packed with huge waits. So we accidentally found this because of a small sign out front advertising happy hour which lasted until I think 6pm. Happy hour menu sounded good so we went in. It was pretty full but there were some available tables so we were seated immediately at window which was great. BF and I decided to share three plates - crab & corn fritters, yugo? roll, and another roll that may have had the word Haru in it. Anyway, the fritters were fantastic and came with a delicious spicy pink sauce. I asked what was in it but server wasn't sure. Whatever it was was awesome. The rolls were also fantastic - I wish I had taken pictures but we were starving so we sort of went crazy eating. BF had two beers & I had a lycheetini which was delicious and fruity. Then I ordered a sakitini. The server warned me it was strong so I was a little nervous. It was pretty strong but I LOVED this one so much I had a second. It tastes mostly like cucumbers since there are shredded cucumbers in it, and you don't realize how strong they are until after. Meaning they don't taste strong but are in fact strong. Very very glad we found this place instead of one of the overpriced packed places surrounding it.",0,0,0,Jessica A.,"Goldsboro, NC",25,62,104

2.0,3/28/2017,"We ordered the sushi dinner and Chirashi and it was so simple and boring. Very overpriced. Unlike other places where you may get free green tea, miso soup and salad, nothing comes with it. But most disappointing was that it was just the ordinary most plain fish. The Chirashi has a huge pile of shredded carrots and lettuce in between the fish and rice. Not only was this very unappealing looking but it made no sense. Chop it up and put it on the side with salad dressing - ok. But this made no sense as a garnish. If the carrots were Japanese pickled style then they would have gone and if the plain lettuce was replaced with shiso leaf then great. But just a pile of plain lettuce and carrots? No seaweed or Japanese pickles or mushroom or anything in the rice? Pretty bad Chirashi. Nothing unique, nothing special which given the price, is not okay. I guess to have an interesting experience it's best to stick to the appetizers and rolls although at $18 a roll you better be prepared to spend.",1,1,0,Amanda S.,"Brooklyn, NY",11,109,121
1.0,3/26/2017,"Truly terrible. I had gone to a Haru near Union Square a few years ago and recalled the sushi being somewhat decent - not great, but ok. Today we were in the Times Square area and we really wanted to get some sushi; Haru was conveniently located near where we were so we decided to come here for our dinner. What a mistake! We ordered the sushi and sashimi for two, priced at $66. For this price, we were really expecting at least decent sushi. Instead we got old sushi with old vegetables - there was a sad leaf of limp lettuce lying lifelessly atop a pile of old carrot strings. The sashimi was cold and thin, and the rice on the sushi rolls was most definitely old or spoiled. We were so shocked by the quality, given its location, posh-y decor, and cost. You'd get better sushi at a deli, honestly. They might get away serving this ""sushi"" to tourists who don't know any better but if you've even had moderately decent sushi, you would know this is truly awful! I still cannot believe we spent $80+ on this meal. Please avoid this place if you wish not to get explosive diarrhea from stale sushi. Almost all of the sushi places I have frequented in NYC is better and cheaper! And to Haru if you are reading this, I know you must be aware when you are serving subpar sushi to customers, especially food that is clearly not fresh -- given that it is sushi, I think this is a health hazard and I think it's awful to charge customers this kind of price and to blatantly bring out old food as if we are fools who cannot tell the difference.

Very Americanized (if you like standard Americanized rollups with stuff like avocado and jalapeños tho, they're good at making them).Some reasons this place isn't for me:1. The miso black cod appetizer tasted to us like regular cod. I obvs can't prove what it was after the fact nor do a genetic test on what I ate, but New Englanders know our cod and what we ate did not taste to us like black cod/sablefish. If it really was black cod, the restaurant did an amazing job making it taste like regular east coast cod. 2. Fishy sea urchin/uni that cost $6/bite3. $8.50 for a liter of Fiji still water4.

My partner had the salmon skin hand roll and the Chelsea Roll. The sake varied from a nauseatingly sweet lychee to perfectly smooth and mellow. The chirashi was good-sized, not too much wasabi as some places, and included a wide variety of raw fish. The tobiko was a chunk of cucumber bursting with juicy red eggs. Definitely my favorite. My partner's salmon skin roll was a thing of beauty and almost appeared to be two entire rolls. Regarding the Chelsea Roll, his comment was ""a little shiso"" goes a long way.I did enjoy Haru Sushi.

3.0,1/1/2017,"I've been to Haru a couple of times before, and visited various locations, with all experiences leaving me very happy with the service and food. However my last visit was somewhat less impressive. I didn't have any problems with the service, but the food in my opinion, did not live up to the price tag. I ordered the lunch sashimi set (9 pieces + soup/salad) and the lobster tacos. My soup came out promptly and had a good umami flavour. Then came to lobster tacos - probably the highlight of the meal - which were appetiser-sized, light and fresh. The taco shell is made of a fried wonton skin, and the filling is a mixture of lobster, cucumber, avocado and other condiments. I would definitely recommend it to others as something to try, however my one gripe would be the ratio of lobster to everything else. Obviously $15 for three tacos won't give you an abundance of lobster, however the protein is cut in such a chunky manner that while eating the taco, you end up with many vegetarian mouthfuls. I had one taco that had four pieces of lobster, and another that only had one.I also tried the sashimi set, which presented me with two pieces of tuna, two of salmon, and three of some sort of white fish (which I think was hamachi). I didn't feel like the fish was very fresh and it was a bit pallid in colour, and while the pieces were large, the cuts of the fish appeared quite inconsistent. While this may not seem important and only cosmetic, the way the fish is sliced determines its flavour and texture. Out of the three pieces of white fish, one was sliced with the bloodline, and the other two appear to have been taken lengthways from they belly, which resulted in a very stringy texture with a lot of fibres.All in all, I found the food the be acceptable, but not great value for the price. The service on the other hand was lovely and consistent, and the ambience was nice and quiet despite being so close to Times Square. I would still go back, however I think I would try something else.",1,1,0,Euling C.,"East Perth, Australia",108,12,29
1.0,12/31/2016,Your location on 43rd street is run by extremely unprofessional management. I made a reservation on Open Table and when I arrived I was told the reservation was not in their system and would have to wait an additional 30 minutes to be seated. I showed the hostess and two managers Edwin Tapia and Kevin Ng my confirmation and they dismissed me. I was made to feel like some sort of liar and all I wanted was to be able to have a nice meal with my best friend. Kevin Ng also told me it wasn't his problem that there was a glitch with the Open Table app. I find this completely unacceptable and rude. Needless to say I will never visit any Haru location as a result of the way I was treated last night. I am a manager for a luxury jewelry brand and would never make a client feel the way I was treated last night. I go out of my way to make people feel special and this type of treatment should not be tolerated. Your managers and host staff need better training on customer service...or did they receive any training at all?

She said 45 minutes. 45 minutes came and went and I was still sitting there. I asked again how long will the wait be and now she says I have to wait another 45 minutes becuase the large groups of people won't leave the resteraunt . At this point, I was hungry, my sugar was dropping, and I was so annoyed. I asked if we can be seated  faster if they split the tables up  four and three. She says sure, no problem , so she seats my daughters table first, the table of four, and I'm still sitting there waiting for another 25 minutes. At this point, I asked to speak to the manager, which he explains to me he did not know about the situation, how  does a manager not know ? Lol. He continues to say that he will take care of us. We finally sit down and order the food. I ordered the miso soup, tasted good, perfect fantasy roll, it was good, vegetable spring rolls were awful, they tasted more like shiitake mushroom rolls . Calamari was good with peanut sauce, a little rubbery, I don't care for the large rings, I'd prefer the smaller ones that are usually more tender. These were all large rings.

4.0,7/28/2016,"Came here for lunch and had quite a pleasant experience. Ordered the popcorn shrimp and edamame as starters. The shrimp was fresh, the batter was light and not too oily and I liked the spicy mayo sauce it was drizzled with. Same goes for the edamame, very fresh and not too salty. For my main course, I ordered the salmon jalapeno, shrimp tempura and the spicy salmon. The fish was very fresh and the sushi was well rolled and prepared (none of that falling apart business!) I left feeling very full and satisfied, this was a great place to grab some good sushi and I'll definitely be returning! :)",2,0,0,Cristina V.,"New York, NY",266,87,43

The sushi is always delicious and fresh and they have some really unique rolls-- love the one with gold flakes! We have dined in at the restaurant as well, and with a large party of 8 we were given a table in a special section of the restaurant that was quieter and had 2 other big tables for larger parties. While dining in, the service was quick and friendly. Haru is the only good sushi option in the Times Square area, in my opinion!",0,0,0,Kristina P.,"New York, NY",250,150,39
5.0,7/18/2016,Love Haru Third avenue. Food is great. Friendly atmosphere and nice folks. They have a seasonal menu. For spring there was a great soup with lobster and mushrooms. For summer there are lobster tacos. Have brought kids and they are family friendly. You can dine inside or out. They have a few locations  but this is the one I frequent often.

To his embarrassment we did give him a tip of over 20% which fell below from the cleaning of the table.  WE HAD TO FIND THE TICKET. HE NEVER LOOKED !

The rice was overcooked but after finally finishing the three rolls that I had, I ordered a second soup. Miso soup is always my weakness and this miso soup was very cloudy and not mixed very well. Finally, for dessert, there was nothing, hardly any choices besides ice cream.

Unfortunately, that's the only highlight of my meal.My bento box came about 20 minutes later and it was pretty much cold. Although the portion was big, the flavors were way off.

3.0,12/24/2015,"Haru is in between my sister's office and my apartment, so it's the perfect place to meet in the middle. Despite being located in Times Square, the interior is quite calm and I didn't notice any typical tourists. The seating is a bit uncomfortable with their wooden chairs, unless you're a luck one and catch a bench seat. Like most NYC restaurants you won't be seated unless your entire party is present, which is a little irritating considering there's literally nowhere to wait around. Your best choice is just waiting outside or making sure your the last one to arrive. I'd recommend the lemongrass hot & sour soup, the shishito peppers, spicy crab caviar roll and salmon jalapeno roll- I like it spicy. Their cocktails are also quite good, like their cucumber gimlet. The sushi's fresh and the staff is speedy. I wouldn't go out of my way to visit Haru, but because the location is so convenient I'll be coming back.

After no apology and a lot of wide eyed blinking stares, he finally offered us a table with a pillar in the middle of it. So basically my husband and I could sit and stare at the wall. The lack of service at this place was appalling. They obviously do not care about their clientele at all. They must depend on the high turn over of tourist in the area to remain full. I will be making sure to tell all of my friends that they should never go to Haru Times Square or any of its affiliate locations.

1.0,7/27/2015,"I have been to every Haru location in the city and have always had a decent experience in terms of service and food; however, the two times I have been to the location on 43rd Street have been pretty awful.  The first time was about a year and a half ago with my parents who were in town and staying in Times Square. The service was slow and the server forgot parts of our order, but that experience was not nearly as bad as what my friend and I endured last week. We had tickets to an 8:00 show that was a block away from Haru, so we assumed that a 6:30 reservation would allow ample time to have a quick meal and head to the theater early. I arrived at 6:15 and waited for my friend at the bar. She arrived at 6:35, at which point we let the hostess know that we were ready to be seated. She informed us that our table would be ready in a few minutes. Approximately fifteen minutes later, she told us that there had been a misunderstanding,  and that our table was not ready yet, which seemed odd since there were multiple tables for two that were unoccupied. At 7:05, I asked her for a status check again and told her that we had tickets to an 8:00 show. She looked into the system, and then she told us that there had been yet another misunderstanding and that she had thought we had a reservation for a party of five instead of a party of two. There were only two of us standing there the entire time, so I'm not sure how this misunderstanding occurred, or why she would not have questioned where the rest of our party was.We were finally seated and ordered immediately (we also informed our server that we had an 8:00 show). Twenty-five minutes later we still had no food and there was no sign of our server, so I found her and reminded her that we were in a rush. She said she would check on our order, but instead of bringing out our entrees, she brought out an order of edamame. By this time it was 7:40, and my friend and I were starving and angry. I complained to the manager, who acknowledged that he had seen me at the bar as early as 6:15. He apologized for the wait and was actually very nice. He comped our drinks and told me that he would put a message in the system so that I would receive special treatment the next time I came in. Unfortunately, there will be no next time. I feel like I'm still digesting the sushi that I was forced to inhale in 10 minutes, and we ended up getting to the theater late, which was completely avoidable had the seating/service at Haru not been such a hot mess. Given the number of places in Times Square that have mastered the pre-theater rush, it's not worth the risk to go to Haru.

I tried the rock shrimp avocado roll as well as the plain avocado roll, and both tasted pretty good - though an avocado roll is pretty hard to screw up. Since we were a large group, we were seated in a semi-private area toward the back of the restaurant that had bigger tables. This was fine, but it was super cold back there for whatever reason. I was thankful for my sweater.I'm mainly ambivalent about this place because everything tasted fine, but nothing really stood out to me.

Their sushi seems to be better than their cooked dishes. The chirashi was a selection of two tuna, whitefish, salmon, sawara, yellowtail, shrimp, two kani, octopus, tobiko and two tamago sashimi, on a bed of sushi rice. The fish was okay, I've had better quality fish but I guess its passable for what you can get at Times Square. The tamago wasn't too great, it lacked that semisweet taste. If you plan to get any drinks, avoid the tea. I was actually surprised they charge $2.95 for tea and it tasted really watered down.. If I knew it wasn't complimentary, I would've sent it back for a new pot or actually I wouldn't have ordered it at all. Most Japanese places offer tea without extra fees but I guess this isn't really ""Japanese"". It's more of a franchise..

Not the best I've ever had, but they were good - good enough for me to get two.After a couple drinks and a few apps, the bill was way higher than I would have expected, but I guess that's Manhattan prices for you.

2.0,8/12/2014,"Simply said, this is deli sushi at a wannabe high end mark up. The selection of fish is limited. The white tuna tasted like it was thawed post-slicing. The regular tuna didn't have any tuna taste or any flavor for that matter. I've been to other locations and thought this would've been okay. Guess I should know better than to eat sushi in Times Square. Trust me, this is New York. Don't bother with this place. I came out of convenience on a rainy day and my friend was craving sushi.

2.0,7/23/2014,"I thought that Haru could be at least a decent (e.g., average) sushi option in Midtown West near my office, per some of my friends' recommendations. Unfortunately it proved to be yet another awful sushi spot on par with the generic fare in the suburbs of NJ which are usually run by Chinese rather than Japanese people. The fish here is nothing special. I knew there would be an issue when I saw the sushi ""Specials"" were Salmon Toro and Yellowtail Toro. Does that even make sense? On top of that, I went at the business lunch hour and fortunately had a reservation. Of course, it was packed, which meant that servers basically want you in and out as fast as possible. While our server took our order quickly and rushed our food out, we couldn't even get his attention when we needed him (they brought out the wrong rolls and eventually insisted we ordered the wrong item).Given the poor food and service experience, I will not be coming back. In terms of ""decent"" sushi, I would expect something on the level of Tomoe or Kanoyama. Haru is nothing better than the Benihana of sushi.",0,1,0,Eric S.,"Summit, NJ",4,19,2

We ordered edamame and drinks to start (beer and sake) and the waitress quickly returned with drinks and to take our dinner order. We got a selection of standard rolls and a few specialty rolls which were maybe only $1-$2 more than you would see at any good sushi place outside the city.

Watching the sushi chefs do their thing, rolling sushi rolls and I was amazed at how fresh the fish was.We started off with an appetizer order of rock shrimp tempura.These were pretty good but not as good as my favorite at Morimoto's in Philadelphia.The spicy titanic roll had salmon, avocado and caviar wrapped around spicy crunchy tuna. I like that this one had a bit of heat to it. I was surprised by the caviar, I've never been a fan, but for this roll, it added a little oomf.This is mine and Joe's go to roll at every sushi restaurant we eat at, we love soft shell crabs! The fun part is always the end pieces with the huge crab piecse and trying to figure out how to fit this entire thing in your mouth. I usually end up cutting it in half and eating it in 2 pieces whereas Joe just places the entire thing in his mouth.The phoenix roll had shrimp tempura, spicy tuna and cucumber.

I had the chance to sit at a booth and at a regular table which I preferred as it fit well with the theme of a spacious setting. Onto the food and sushi, which, is decent considering the price. However, as it is located in Time Square, its hard to find a good sushi restaurant nearby my workplace  and in terms of quality and price, Haru is not a bad place. I had tried almost all of the sushi and I would recommend any of it for a decent price. Haru does give a special reward where they give you a $20 Birthday certificate and inform you of current events or promotions that are happening at Haru.In conclusion, Haru is a great place with decent sushi and food.

I especially like the thin, tall tree trunks that are lined up to serve as room dividers. It was great to score a booth to sit in too.While not super-expensive, nothing is cheap here either. Given the pricing, the food is good but falls short of spectacular. Still, I liked being here because the room was fun to be in. This is, after all, the theater district!The Rock Shrimp Tempura appetizer ($12) was quite crispy and tasty. But while the steamed Vegetable Dumplings ($6.75) looked attractive, they fell apart to the touch. The Wafu Seaweed Salad ($8.50) was large but a little bit too watery. At $2.95, the Miso Soup was the cheapest item on our bill -- next to the $3 soda -- and it was okay.One piece -- I repeat, one piece -- of yellowtail sushi set me back $4. In all fairness, though, it was very fresh and I had a second piece for a total of $8. The California rolls, at $4.90 each, were generously sized and very fresh too.If you like Chicken Katsu, $19.75 buys you a lot of breaded, fried chicken cutlet.

The atmosphere was nice, we had a very friendly and helpful waitress, the food was good and overall it was a nice spot to catch up at before she took her train. The reason I'm giving this place three stars is how expensive it was for the food. I mean 7.50 for a good eel avocado roll, seriously?? Most sushi places I go to have that for 4 dollars. They also lacked a solid sushi special where you got to choose 2 or 3 rolls for a certain price, most places have that as well. I also found it weird that the lunch special ended at three; it's normally at four isn't it? Honestly thought I can't say I'm surprised, I mean it is in midtown, time square area, so everything is a bit more expensive there. I mean even the street food is expensive there, perfect example a hot dog in union square, a dollar, a hot dog in time square, four dollars.

4.0,8/24/2013,"Making a reservation at the restaurant thru Yelp was easy, and as though it was a summer Friday night, it was easy enough to switch our table to a slightly quieter, more well-lit booth. The waitress--Cassandra, like many who work in and around the theater district, was moonlighting at Haru and a theatrical dance choreographer by trade. Bright, personable, and accommodating, she made our dining experience (which happened to be a birthday dinner) very enjoyable. Though not a huge connaisseur or consumer of sushi--I may eat it once or twice a year--this was some of the freshest, best-tasting sushi I've had anywhere, including other restaurants in LA, NY and FL. The presentation and selection were not too elaborate, which made it easier to come up with a selection in not too much time, but offered an appealing variety. Expect to spend $100 for two, for two appetizers, two entrees, and one drink each (plus one shared dessert).",0,1,0,Lee D.,"Pleasantville, NY",6,69,0
4.0,8/12/2013,"Great sushi place to hit up if you happen to be in Times Square or the Theater DistrictTip: its on 43rd so walk up/down 8th and hang a turn onto 43rd that way you can avoid navigating through the crowds at times square and resist the urge to take free tickets to the 40 comedy shows that people offer in that area.The place has a laid back, chill decor - not like many other delicious times square staples (i.e. hard rock, TGI Fridays...)The bar has a daily happy hour with cheap drinks and apps, so I would strongly recommend it (i think its from 3-7pm, wknds too!)The sushi was very good, and prices were reasonable...While many typically won't plan a destination in Times Square, it might be a good place to take any visitors you are showing around the city or a great stop if you are in the area.overall: very pleasently surprised with the experience!",2,3,1,Scott S.,"Hoboken, NJ",104,220,0

3.0,7/28/2013,"A solid theater-district Sushi place that doesn't intimidate and serves a complete line up. It's about half the restaurant it could be, so it gets by on location and excellent service. The decor is also pleasant. Here's the deets:Summer roll ($8.5): Special for the night; very tasty shrimps and mangoes. Should have been $5, but we're where we are. Shishito peppers ($7): Nicely prepared, presented, and spicy. It's a big portion. Sushi & Sashimi platter ($27): Pretty much what you'd expect. Nothing about it lept off the plate for me. Calamari salad ($9.75): Yeah, it was overdressed, but it was plenty for two, and makes a great appetizer. Salmon skin roll ($5.75): pretty good value, Add a piece of uni (sea urchin) at $6, and two glasses of:Deep Sea Chardonnay ($12)So we get to $95.81, before tip.BONUS: Convenient locationTIP: The basic rolls list a few pages into the menu. There's some good values here. TIP: Low value for the most part. Search for the good value. It's there.TIP: There was an avocado and surimi roll on the platter. In this context, I expected crab instead of krab. TIP: We ordered too much. The server thought we might have been under-ordering, and I really look to servers to give solid recommendations on this point.

4.0,7/18/2013,"i like to think of myself as quite well-versed in where to eat in times square -- i see a lot of theater, i work about 10 blocks north of the theater district, and i love food (and yelp.)  yet i was struggling to identify a good option when heading to the theater last night: everything was either too far away (most of my favorite dining options in the area are in the upper 40s or low 50s, and i was heading to a theater on 43rd and therefore wanted to be a little closer), or too expensive, or too crowded according to yelp reviews (there's no time to wait for a table when you're eating before going to see a show.)  so, ultimately, i decided on Haru Sushi -- it wasn't going to be cheap but would still be better than places with $28-38 entrees; it was one block away from the theater we were going to; and i was able to make a reservation for the exact time i wanted.the reservation was wise, as the place was PACKED when we were there and i'm not sure we would have immediately gotten a table otherwise; but even with the restaurant being so crowded AND even with half of our group arriving really late so we didn't place our order until 7pm, they still had us out of there at 7:45, perfectly timed for our 8pm curtain.  so they're definitely efficient and know what sort of crowd they're catering to, which is good.the food is definitely not cheap, even by sushi standards -- most of the ""special"" rolls (which is what i usually order, as opposed to the more basic rolls) were $18, so that's a few bucks more than i'm accustomed to.  but three of us shared four rolls, and when you do that, it helps mitigate the cost a bit.  and, the quality surprised me -- it was actually quite good, very fresh-tasting and quite yummy -- so at least i wasn't over-paying for mediocre sushi that makes you wonder if it's really safe to eat this fish raw.with one round of drinks, the four special rolls + the vegetarian sushi entree for our fourth person, and tax + tip, it came out to $44/person.  like i said, definitely not cheap -- but in that area, it could be a whole lot worse, and i did really enjoy the food, it was actually quite good sushi.  yes, you could do a heck of a lot worse.  and in times square, that's really the bar that's been set.",1,0,0,Lily T.,"Brooklyn, NY",131,275,0

I walk in I ask to sit at the bar and state plainly to the hostess station I will be using my birthday coupon.So my friend and I made sure to order plenty of food - far more than  $20 and a couple of drinks each and when the bill comes I try to use the coupon and am then told I can not It is somehow invalid.  The wording that I read 3 times before using it during happy hour and then stating during happy hour to the staff that I WILL BE USING A BIRTHDAY COUPON that they email out.....it is now useless of a $55.00 check.  When I pay for the meal and tip the bartenders who aren't the ones who made the decision to reuse the coupon I left but not before informing the the front hostess staff I will be reviewing HARU @ 43rd St. for this indignity.  A manager Thomas James seemed genuinely concerned about losing a customer but unwilling to rectify the situation and the Red Headed Female Manager who's card I refused to take on the grounds she made it clear the misinterpretation of the wording on the coupon was my mistake even though it specifically read does not include drinks alcohol gratuity or tax.  She did thank me for bringing this the her attention so she could take the issue up with corporate  (HAHA!! Am I going to get paid for that??? laughable)  But NO ONE made any effort on that day to retain me as a customer.  Only suggested I come in again.

3.0,1/7/2013,"Definitely not the best sushi place I've been to and nothing mind-blowing about this place, but excellent service, great atmosphere, and a fairly original menu make this restaurant a stand-out in an area full of national chains and touristy eateries.We were headed to the theater district that evening for a show, so our dining options were limited.  Haru ended up being a nice evening out for us and very good food while still providing us a very close locale to our theater so we just had a short 10 minute walk in the 25 degree weather after dinner.Our server was fantastic, to the point that when we questioned exactly what type of sake we were having (because it was delicious), he came back with a handwritten note with the official name for us to take home.  The highlight of the night was by far the trio of tacos.  One salmon, one tuna, and one yellowtail - these 3 little mini tacos were delicious and fresh with perfectly blended flavors.The rock shrimp was mediocre, nothing too special about them and a little bit heavy on the batter.  For sushi, we went with the Grammercy Park roll and the Strawberry Fin.  Both were tasty, but there was just a little bit too much going on and almost too many flavors happening that the fish got lost in the mix.The sake menu was very reasonable.  Not a huge list of options, but we were shocked to see we could get a 300mL bottle or a bamboo of sake for just around $20.  We went with the bamboo of nigori and it was fruity and delicious.I wouldn't recommend Haru if you're trying to find the best sushi in NYC, but if you're headed to a show and in the area looking for a good dinner spot, I think Haru is the perfect place - classy, trendy, great service, solid food, and very reasonable prices.",1,0,0,Amoli P.,"Chicago, IL",82,335,328
4.0,1/5/2013,"Haru Sushi provides a very pleasant dining experience for the Times Square area. It's great for those who work in and around this part of the city and for those who are just simply touring. However, if you want some good sushi and a venue that has a slightly less touristy dining experience without being over the top, then this is a good place to consider. I've been here more times for lunch and came specifically for special occasions. Haru provides a spacious interior with warm and inviting decor, dim lighting, a lot of seating, plus a sushi bar in the back. For lunch, I usually order from their lunch special menu which consists of sushi/sashimi combos, bento boxes, and teriyaki. The last time I was here though, I got a little more spendy and ordered the Chirashi from their full menu (This is basically sashimi/vegetables over rice), and it was a very sufficient, well-presented, and delicious meal. Order some sake or green tea on the side, and you will have a complete meal. The sushi here is not bad at all and the presentation is nice. I've seen some sloppy sushi put together at other places, but they do a nice job here in my opinion. Service can be a bit spotty, and I think it mainly has to do with the time in which you choose to come here. It can get very busy especially from noon to 1pm, so if you can take an earlier or later lunch or make reservations, I would advise it. Otherwise, the waiters are usually friendly and attentive to your needs. Wait times for food to arrive can be longer or shorter, and again, this is dependent on how busy/packed the restaurant is. If you're in the Times Square area and are looking for a decent spot for a special occasion or a somewhat above average dining experience in Times Square, Haru is a fine place to dine at.",0,0,1,Sara L.,"Manhattan, NY",721,552,3545
4.0,12/31/2012,"I came to this place for lunch since it was walking distance to Times Square.  It is a nice place to dine with light bamboo, lots of light wood floors, with a contemporary and modern appeal.  We ordered the shrimp and mushroom shumai with spicy soy vinegarette.  This dish comes with 4 pieces of shumai which was very tasty.  A bit of a sweet and fishy taste but nonetheless it was good.  We also ordered three rolls: rainbow roll, broadway roll, and another roll which I can't remember.  All of the roll were good but not great.  I don't know of very many sushi restaurants that know how to properly make sushi rice which is Japanese white rice infused with rice vinegar for a little acidity and tartness.  The rolls were standard in size and portion is similar to what you would get at a decent sushi restaurant.  The price was a bit high taking into account the quality of the rolls but then again, you are in Times Square!  The gold foil on the broadway roll was a nice touch but I feel they can a bit more in terms of internal contents to make this better.  The rainbow roll was good and had a variety of fresh assorted fish and shrimp.  Overall, this is one of the better restaurants in the Times Square area, but be ready to drop some cash on your lunch.  The Hard Rock Cafe draws a much bigger crowd especially tourists, but a much cheaper lunch alternative.",0,0,0,Tet W.,"Portland, OR",44,230,93

I didn't try the Gramercy Park roll but it certainly looked awesome with the colorful roe. The Super Dynamite consisted of cooked eel, asparagus and fried tempura style. Very tasty.

It is now an hour later and I have not gotten any chicken.  The manager (who I spoke to earlier) has no answer other than believing the fact that we got disconnected at the end of our call meant that I no longer wanted the chicken dish that I had asked for (and he had promised) numerous times.",0,1,0,Michael B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,44,0

The normally $13 cocktails are $7.50 (you have to sit at the sushi bar depending on the time for this) and there are also some food (sushi and appetizers), wine, and beer specials. Cocktails: They have a really great specialty drink list. $7.50 is a steal for these drinks especially in this area. The green tea margarita was awesome. I had two; the first just tasted like a regular margarita while the second had a little more green tea flavor. I wish the green tea was a little more prevalent but it was a great drink (my friend said it was one of the best drinks she has ever had- high praise!). The other drinks on the menu looked amazing too, will need to try these in the future.Food: Sitting at the sushi bar was cool because we got to see all the rolls and they all looked amazing. We had dinner reservations so we didn't eat much but we did order the Crunchy Spicy Salmon Roll. It was soooo good and at $5 a total bargain. A friend ordered the chicken teriyaki which came with sweet potato and broccoli. Also a good deal at $6.They also have a brown rice awesome for sushi which is great. The dragon roll looked really good, will have to come back to try this. Also if you sign up, you get a $20 gift certificate on your birthday (for food only).

2.0,7/15/2012,I would like to preface this by first stating the last time I yelped was over a year and half ago.  I went to Haru in midtown Manhattan last night and after having lived in Manhattan for 15 years I was a little surprised by the amount of disorganization and poor treatment my friends and I dealt with.  We were a party of three with a reservation and two of us arrived at the time of the reservation waiting for the third person.  The restaurant was probably 3/4 full but they wouldn't allow us to be seated until the third person joined.  Meanwhile a couple walks in with no reservation and were immediately seated.  So that wasn't too off putting but still it was only a party of three and they should have seated us.  They sent us to the bar to wait and we ordered a bottle of wine after waiting 10 minutes for the bartender to acknowledge us.  When our friend arrived the bartender said we had to sit at the bar table versus the main dining area which made no sense to us but we moved to the table.  We waited roughly 15 minutes until the bartender who made us sit in the bar area came to take out order and our friend didn't have a drink yet.  This bartender had no personality and I felt like we were inconveniencing him  at the table as well as at the bar.   He takes our order and then a waitress came by roughly 10 minutes later to say she would be taking care of us and proceeded to take our order after we already gave it to the bartender.  She was lovely and efficient and basically somewhat redeemed the evening but for a restaurant where entrees are $25 to $30 this was unacceptable and disappointing to say the least.   In a city where restaurants open and close over night I was more surprised than anything.  I know Haru will not be closing anytime soon as it's in the heart of touristville but I certainly hope this lack of service and organization is an infrequent occurance.,0,0,0,Dave V.,"Manhattan, NY",1,9,0

Prior to a show in times square, I was trying to determine a restaurant that we could go to that would have good food but also be close enough to the theater that we could avoid the crazy tourists as much as possible. I'd been to the Haru on Park and probably others, and decided this was close and probably one of our best bets.I was pleasantly surprised. Nice room. Nice staff. Food was very good - highlight was definitely the miso soup and veggie dumplings.

4.0,1/17/2012,"When I'm on business travel I hate eating by myself. There's something about sitting at a table with no one to talk to that makes me feel like nobody loves me (awww). So I was pleasantly surprised when I found Haru right by my hotel. I've been eating there whenever I'm in NYC for business and have always had a good experience, esp. as they have a sushi bar with other ""loners"" so you fit right in.The hot and sour soup is excellent, very spicy and filled with a couple of shrimps and some scallops. On this visit I also had the rainbow roll and three pieces of individual nigiri (tuna, salmon, shrimp), all with brown rice, and they were excellent. The prices are reasonable too, for all of that plus a Kirin the total bill came to $55 including tip. Not too shabby for a restaurant right off of Times Square, and the atmosphere is kinda nice too (although the music, the MUSIC! is so loud at times).If you're in the Times Square area and hankering for some sushi, I'd recommend checking it out.

4.0,11/27/2011,"I was at Time Square on Broadway and 43rd Street, and I took out my iPhone and pressed the ""Around Me"" APP. Haru Sushi popped up right away and it was listed as only 43yds away. Alright, I thought. It was around 3:55PM and I wondered if it was open. I reached the front door and saw a street sign advertising: Sake Hour, Mon-Sun from 3-7pm. I saw sake for $4.50 a glass (cold or hot) and rolls for $3.50 to $5.00. I was psyched.  When I walked in, I told the hostess that I wanted to sit at the Sushi Bar. She directed me to the bar, and gave me a menu for food and drinks. However, she didn't give me the list for Sake Hour prices. I was a little annoyed by that. I had to go back and ask for it. I ordered a cold glass of sake and it was pretty good. I also ordered a Wafu Seaweed salad; wafu refers to a Japanese style of dressing. The seaweed salad was unique to say the least, with a lot of shredded veggies besides seaweed, including daikon radish which tasted pretty good with dressing on it. The salad was good, but I would have preferred just seaweed. I then ordered sake toro (salmon belly) sashimi. The waiter asked me how many pieces I wanted, and I was immediately confused. Definitely not a traditional Japanese restaurant;  here you pay by the piece. Haru Sushi, I guess, is a fusion place. The pieces are the same size as sushi pieces (pretty big for sashimi), so I ordered five pieces. The sake toro was good, but I wouldn't call all of the five pieces toro (salmon belly). Three were and two were half and half.  The guy sitting near me at the bar was a big fan of the place. He said that he visited the Boston Haru Sushi and it was great too. Once the female waitress came on duty the service became quick, efficient, and friendly. I guess that I arrived during a shift change because the guy who was initially my waiter wasn't especially helpful or prompt. I had to wave at him to come over when I wanted to order. A definitely gone for the day dude.  I ordered another sake from my new waitress and I then ordered two of the $5 special rolls: a Spicy Tuna Roll and a Crunchy Spicy Salmon Roll, and they were pretty good gajin rolls for the money.  Later, I ordered Ika (squid) sushi, and that was pretty good too. After that I ordered green tea, and green tea mochi for dessert; it came with three mochi on a long plate, and I had the waitress throw in a red bean mochi in between two green tea mochi. This brought back a funny memory when I told my Japanese CEO that I wanted some mochi ice cream. He said: ""Ken San, Mochi Ice Cream is for children."" I laughed and said that I hope that I will always be a child at heart: filled with wonder and excitement for new experiences. He laughed and said: ""Very good, Ken San, we will find some."" Haru is definitely not a traditional Japanese sushi bar, and it is not the best sushi I've ever had, nor is it the least expensive. However, given that it's located in a high rent and heavy tourist area, I was surprised by the quality of the fish.  I will definitely revisit Haru. The Japanese sushi chef whose name is Nobu was very pleasant too. No, not the famous Nobu. We had a good conversation about Japan. Haru's serves decent sushi at a reasonable price - especially for being located just off of Times Square.  Haru Sushi is conveniently located near the theater district so its great for a flavorful, quick meal before taking in a show on Broadway. Some of the other items on the 3-7PM menu: Plum wine, $4; edamame, $4; California roll, $3.50; spicy chicken teriyaki, $6; Tempura, $6; Spring Rolls, $5 and Japanese Beer, $4.50.",1,0,0,Ken M.,"Hartford, CT",6,208,36

It was ok, however I probably wouldn't order it again.  Finally, at the end of the meal, they surprised us with three desserts of fried bananas and ice cream for the birthday girls, complete with candles.

Then, she blatantly forgot about us as we were sitting there, wating for our food to arrive. It had been nearly 50 minutes since we sat down and ordered our food and we had finished our bottle of sake. I started looking around the restaurant to see what was up... also to signal our impatience to the wait staff because quite frankly, I was hungry and out of alcohol. Another waitress saw us looking around, and she flagged down our waitress. Our waitress's eyes turned big and round, and I knew at that moment she completely forgot about us. She ran to the sushi bar and got our food, which Im sure was sitting there for about 20 minutes.  I would've been okay with giving this place 2 or 3 stars if the sushi was good. I understand that waiters have to juggle many tables.  But my sushi roll wasn't even rolled correctly. The nori didn't reach all the way around the special roll, which by the way was $12, and every time I picked up a piece it fell apart.

The interior is soothing with its bamboo walls and soft lighting and the servers are very knowledgeable about the menu items.I started with a champagne cocktail to celebrate my arrival which was very satisfying. However, the night got so much better when I ordered what, to this day, I consider the BEST cocktail I have ever had in my life. I am so serious about this that I am telling everyone that reads this,: if you go here and do not order the Don Q premium LYCHEE MOJITO, you are missing out on an incredible mixology experience. This drink is literally a party in your mouth, an explosion of complex flavors, and surprisingly refreshing for a cocktail. To start my meal I had the vegetarian dumplings (excellent), the vegetable roll (so-so). and the strawberry fin special roll. The strawberry fin was rolled with crunchy yellow-tail, jalapenos, and mango, and topped with fresh strawberries and scallops. Although this is one of the most unconventional sushi rolls I have ever had, it definitely was one of the best mix of interesting ingredients and flavors that I've tried yet.  I would certainly recommend this place to anyone in the mood for a good sushi experience with some really interesting new combinations that I have not seen before.",0,0,0,Sarah H.,"Raleigh, NC",96,216,5

Most of the tartares I've had were with hardboiled eggs. We ordered the kiss of fire roll, the spider roll and the gramercy park roll. So the kiss of fire roll was definitely spicy for me although my friend though it could be spicier. The spider roll was good but I wish the spicy mayo was thicker. The gramercy park roll was okay. Nothing too spectacular about it. I think what made the break were the drinks. I had the berry kiss and puma while my friend had the haru's painkiller. I loveddd the berry kiss! It was the right amount of sweetness with liquor. The puma was not bad sort of like a fruit soda. Haru's painkiller is comparable to a pina colada with more coconut in it. Would I go there again?

3.0,4/7/2011,"Having been to the Haru in Philadelphia numerous times, it was an easy decision to give Haru in NYC a try. I came with the same expectations & standards. The ambiance was decent & the service is more upscale than the Haru in Philadelphia. The space of the restaurant was pretty tight though. I came with a party of 6 & they seated us too close to the other tables that we had to move the table over ourselves for more space to get into our chairs. It wasn't easy getting our waiter's attention when we needed something & we were in a rush to catch our bus back to Philly, but it didn't take very long to get our food, so it made up for it. My boyfriend & I shared an order of the Trio Fish Tacos for an appetizer. It was mediocre. It's basically chopped up tuna, salmon & fluke w/ cherry tomato & shallot salsa, yuzu ceviche sauce and avocado. For our entree, we had the Gramercy Park Roll and the Park Avenue Roll. It was pretty good. I really enjoyed the tobiko that's sprinkled on top. Mmm...I really wanted to try their Cheesecake Tempura since I absolutely love it at Haru Philadelphia, but we didn't have time for dessert since we had to catch our bus. :( Although the service is mediocre, I would still recommend this place because the food came out reasonably fast despite how busy they were.",0,0,0,Ling P.,"Philadelphia, PA",117,146,561

Both were excellent choices.  I LOVED the roll.  The spiciness was perfectly balanced with the sweetness of the mango and strawberry.  The fish tasted fresh and delicious.  I ordered two Asahi with my meal.  Total came to around $50.

I love fried foods and katsu being pone of my favs, but I barely ate any. Imagine cut up raw fish presented in a ball of mush and you have the cerviche. Oh but it gets worse, it was so stringy and sort of fishy that I wished it tasted like mush. That would be a step up.Oh the Christmas light decor and Michael Jackson song in the background somehow worked for today, but I figure it happens to fit in with the snow and cold from last night.

2.0,3/14/2011,"I will start out with saying that Haru in Times Square is a real nice change of pace.  It's quiet bustling and a very nice dinner ambiance, but my experience here was soured when I found a hair in my sushi (ick!). They are definitely on the more expensive end (it is Times Square and you are in New York after all), but if I hadn't found the hair in my sushi, the quality of the food definitely deserved another point.  The service is quite slow, but if you're in good company, it goes by quickly.   For starters, we had the lobster tempura & the vegetable spring rolls.  There wasn't anything special about the lobster tempura that made me say ""wow"" and the vegetable spring rolls were average.  You've got to be quite talented to screw up battering and frying, imo.  We ordered a few rolls to round out our entrees:1.  Spider Roll (Crispy soft shell crab, lettuce and tobiko): Nothing special or extra tasty about this.  Very standard spider roll, though I will add that the crab they used was very bitter, not sure if they cleaned it properly.2.  Golden Passion Roll (charred super white tuna wrapped around asparagus, shitake mushrooms, avocado and carrot topped with yuzu tobiko): This was my favorite roll of the three.  I really liked the charred white tuna and the shitake mushrooms flavor with the rice and avocado.  MMM3.  Gramery Park Roll (Crunchy spicy super white tuna and jalapenos wrapped with tuna, yellowtail and salmon and topped with lemon, cilantro, tobiko and yuzu miso sauce).  Even prior to me finding the hair in a piece of this roll, I was not a big fan of how it tasted.  The salmon was very fresh, but all the other additions didn't work well together.  I wish that I had gotten a regular salmon roll now.  Overall, Haru really disappointed me, especially after I heard (and read) so many rave reviews.  Definitely check out other places in that area that offer better quality.",0,0,0,Crystine W.,"New York, NY",773,1215,283

Ugh, Ick, Yikes.  We call the waiter over to show and he babbled and said something about getting a manager.  (I watch him wait his other tables and do nothing.)A manager never showed up.  By this point I am pissed and want out of the place immediately.  He comes by again and I bring this up.  I see him then go get the manager.  The manager babbles something that doesn't address the problem.  New guy rolling sushi, blah blah.  What about the brown salmon???Whatever, received a tiny credit on our bill and with the beginnings of stomach stabbings we depart and I vow never to visit another Haru again.  UNACCEPTABLE.",1,0,0,Joanne B.,"Mammoth Lakes, CA",83,283,39

I will concur with other reviewers saying the service is a tad slower than one would expect and Haru is to be enjoyed without a tight schedule, but believe me it's worth it.First off, the staff is out-of-this-world helpful and understanding. I turned up in a very sorry state (after hours of intercontinental flying, running and dragging my luggage), and not an eyebrow was raised when I asked to leave most of my stuff by the small and crammed reception area. Remember: this is times square on a busy night! Secondly, portions are very generous. I shared a sushi platter for two and, the first-class eater I am, I struggled to finish my half.

4.0,10/8/2010,"With the exception of my dinner last night, this place deserves four stars. Now if I was basing this review on last night's meal alone, I would be giving it three, but let's just assume Haru was having an off night, and give them the benefit of the doubt.It started with the appetizer. Our vegetable spring rolls tasted strange. I don't mean they were spoiled, but it seemed like some of the flavors just didn't mesh well together. There was a strange apple flavor to them, which to be fair could have actually been apples, but whatever it was, it didn't blend well with the overpowering amount of mushrooms.For my meal I had the Super White Tuna Jalapeño Roll, despite the name making me feel a little racist when I ordered it. I had my roll prepared with brown rice, which makes me seem so healthy, but it's really just to deter my boyfriend from stealing a bite since he hates brown rice. The roll was good. The fish was good quality, and it tasted very fresh. It just wasn't outstanding the way it usually is.We skipped dessert, since I had half a pint of raspberry sherbet back at my apartment.

3.0,8/6/2010,"It had been a while since I have had some good sushi and I wanted to try something new so I decided to check out Haru Suhi.  It looked kind of nice from the outside, but it was hard to tell entirely because the building is currently covered with scaffolding (as of August 2010).Going inside, I was really impressed by the ambience.  The restaurant is two levels, with the sushi bar and a bar for drinks on the second level.  Booth seating lines the outer edge of the restaurant with smaller tables in the middle, lower section.  Branches rise up from the edge of the lower seating area, separating the two sections from each other just enough that you can see through, but still have a sense of privacy.So great atmosphere right?  Total turn off by the really nasty hostess.  We asked for a table for two and her first answer was ""Do you have a reservation?"" in a snarky tone.  We admitted no and she went on to tell us that normally one is required.  The place was 75% empty so this was a bit mystifying.  I looked to the gent next to her and he sort of had this ""I better jump in here."" look on his face so he immediately told us he thought it would be okay.  Right after that, another couple walked in after my girlfriend and I and without a reservation, were seated before us.  So yeah, not a good first impression.Anyhow, all that said we were eventually seated and from that point forward the service was top notch.  The waiter was very attentive, very helpful and fast.  We ordered the sesame spinach and roasted peppers appetizer.  The spinach was really tasty, with a wonderful sweetness and tenderness.  The peppers with sea salt were okay, nothing to write home about (and really not worth the money).For our entrees, we shared a sashimi platter and a vegetarian sushi platter.  The sashimi slices were pretty insanely huge, about 1/3 larger than your average sashimi slice.  The fish was very fresh and tasted fantastic.  The vegetarian sushi platter was really cool with items like a grilled shitake mushroom wrapped with rice by a seaweed band and roasted asparagus given the same treatment.  Perhaps my favorite was the mushroom.  The smokey flavor was to die for and the presentation was beautiful.  I also noticed they use a particularly strong brand of wasabi here that really has a wonderful flavor to it.The bathrooms were very clean and they use the common sink area set up where the sinks are set up outside the bathrooms.  I like this since your wait time for a rest room will be less if you're not waiting for someone to wash up inside (and taking their sweet time about it).This was almost a four star review, but two things turned me off.  First was the hostess and second was the pricing.  For what it is, the prices here are a lot more than I'm used to paying.  For two people the meal came out to twice what I would normally pay at other sushi places nearby (that have nicer hostesses to boot).I'm not going to offer a ringing endorsement of this place, nor am I going to slam it.  I hope this review gives you a good balanced view of both the good and bad of this restaurant.",4,1,1,Benson Y.,"New York, NY",393,1300,917

Everything was excellent, although I could have done without the chicken dumpling things. Those were just okay. The service was excellent and all the food came out in a timely manner. I was concerned, since we were off to see a show, but everything came out and we left in a good amount of time. The prices were incredible for Times Square.

The agadashi tofu was made with the wrong kind of tofu. They used firm chinese tofu that sours slightly after prolonged frying, which was definitely a bad decision.

I like the sushi there so much that when I've thrown parties are my place around the block, Ive picked up large orders of these rolls to serve to guests. Aside from the sushi, any time i have ordered anything off the regular menu, its always been nothing but great.Definitely a great place to do dinner with friends or somewhere to stop by and have a quick drink.

2.0,10/6/2009,"I really, really dislike this place. I work in the neighborhood and any time clients want sushi, we always end up ordering from here. Anytime I've gotten sushi from here it tends to be more rice than fish. The spicy tuna rolls also tend to sometimes just taste ""off"".

What was meant to be a girl's night out after work, turned into a sampling of beverages with a few rolls thrown in. I love that although this location is near Times Square (gasp), it still has a great work crowd and doesn't feel as touristy as I had expected it to be.I started the night with an Enter the Dragon which was a combo of Sake and Pommegranite. I have to say that I didn't really taste the Sake; however, my friend's drink, The Derby was a perfect blend of Bourbon and mint! On my second round, I had the Saketini which was a mix of sake, vodka and plum wine - it was garnished with cucumbers. We ordered the Kabuki which had three rolls and then I ordered a Spicy Crunchy Tuna Roll. My friend stuck with another Derby drink and everything together was $70! I love the bamboo decor and drinking and eating by the bar was a great option. I'd like to believe that with all the Haru's in the city, this experience would be the same no matter where you went.

Point already!My sister and I got sat at a window which made the experience even more fun. People watching in NY is as good as it is in SF. We started with the Sashimi Ceviche and that was one of the best appetizers I have ever had. If you like standard Mexican ceviche, you will most likely love this. I am SO glad we tried it. I wanted Sarah to not like it so I could eat it all but she liked it a lot too. Boo for sharing!We ordered three other rolls which I can't remember because it was a few months ago but I knew that my sister and I were VERY happy with them. I remember each roll was a good size and was as fresh as could be. We left there with very full tummys. If I return to that area of NY, I will be visiting this place again.

I love their ranbow roll and miso soup. Their teriyaki chicken is great too! I suggest that you DO NOT order the wok seared tuna. I should have known it was a red flag when the waitress asked ""And how would you like that cooked?"" Like, huh??? It's seared tuna! Anyway, it came out looking like beef and it was dry and horrible.

The other appetizers we had (the Vegetarian Spring Rolls and the Tuna Ceviche) we did not want to share because we loved them so much. My wife is a big fan of Chinese Hot and Soup soup and though this obviously is not Chinese the Hot and Sour soup bested anything she has had in the past -- and yes, the Miso soup is awesome (and this coming from someone who orders four misos when ordering for delivery from other places just for himself)The main meal was the Sashimi for myself and three select rolls for my wife.

I'd been to a different Haru several times before, so I figured this one would be about the same. I liked the wood-based architecture and design inside of this place. I ordered a very standard plate of sushi and sushi rolls (maguro, unagi, hamachi, shake, California rolls, tuna rolls, and maybe a few other things). I can't say anything was bad per se, but the fish just wasn't that great. Furthermore, even though I acknowledge that this is an American-style sushi place, their cuts are too long. Pieces of sushi are meant to be consumed in a single bite, and I just wasn't able to do that with any of the sushi here (even the rolls were too big...). I came for dinner early, but the service seemed kind of mediocre. For example, the person filled my water up to the point where it was almost overflowing, so I spilled some water on myself. The waitress was also unnecessarily slow in taking the bill at the end of the meal.

I can't answer the second question, but I will say that I was obviously delusional in the first count. The decor is totally overdone. I suppose it's to some people's liking, because they are into the whole zOMG, themez, Oriental, yes, it's like we're in Japan, because they totally have these awkward fountains in the middle of the room thing...Anyway, moving onto the food. I got the calamari appetizer. It is definitely from a frozen package and the dip is from a jar. The sushi sounds fun on the menu, but I guess I'm just more of the k.i.s.s. school of sushi. Good sushi for me means fresh fish and properly made rice, not too soggy or soft, and seasoned. So, yes, extravagant rolls can be good, but in general, I think it's not. Haru is def for the suckers that don't really want sushi, but just want to have sushi, because it's trendy. Stop pretendin' and just go to Applebee's, darling.

A normal california roll - lazy on the crab part of it by just putting the chunk of imitation crab into it (but whatever).

2.0,2/11/2009,"I remember a few years ago I tried sushi here in new york and was so horrified that I vowed to never try it again.  Alas, I decided to go back on that in good faith, hoping that I would be proved wrong.  But, no.  I think that people who think this sushi is amazing or wonderful or anything remotely close to that need to pack up and go to the west coast.  Hello fresh fish and good sushi chefs!Now the rolls themselves weren't horrible, but they were only a grade above supermarket sushi.Let me start at the beginning.  I walked in and thought the decor and atmosphere was nice.  Very trendy.  Because it was just me, myself, and I, I decided to sit at the sushi bar.  Low and behold I soon realized that I didn't order my food directly with the chefs!  What?!  What's the point of sitting at a sushi bar then? Strike ONE!  I ordered my tea and sushi and was pleased to see that they brought me a tea pot.  I like it when they do that.  I know, small thing, but that's about all I have to focus on.They bring my rolls and I'm immediately disappointed.  I ordered a california roll with masago.  And I get a mere sprinkling of it.  What's the point in ordering masago if you can't taste it? Ugh.  But that wasn't the only problem.  The crab was merely a square chunk placed inside.  Or should I say krab?  What happened to real meat? Gross.  Roll #2 was the Broadway roll.  It was a spicy tuna roll with avocado topped with regular tuna.  The spicy tuna wasn't spicy and was flavored with wasabi.  The point of spicy tuna is to have a different taste of the spice and be able to mix it with wasabi so it isn't redundant.  And they topped it with gold leaf (I think the $18 of the roll went to pay for just that, because the roll sure wasn't worth it).To make things worse (if that's possible),  they start cleaning the area where the fish is displayed right in front of me!  They're using a hose and spraying it right in my direction (thank god for the glass) and I'm feel like I'm looking into a carwash.  Wow, thanks.  You couldn't have waited till I left to clean it?

The thick glass blocks out the ambient noise of the street and the bamboo stalks that separate the different areas of the restaurant are coiled with Christmas lights giving the place a soft glow that can make it feel more like eating outdoors on a summer afternoon than cramming lunch down your throat before you run back to the office.The food is elegant, subtle and filling in a way that doesn't leave you gut-pregnant. I'm still tasting the Unaju eel and pickled vegetables and man does it feel good.

I had my birthday dinner here two years ago but have eaten here on numerous occasions.Here's my story: I had a birthday dinner group of 20 and it was impossible to find a place in the city to accommodate that without prerequisites (ie: pre-fixe). I had dined at the Union Square location previously (which is just as fantastic, same menu, but with a little bit more intimate setting, I won't review it twice or Yelp will take down a double review). I called them and not only was the lady super helpful and patient, she quickly put down my reservation and proceeded to confirm with me at an appropriate pace (the week prior, the day prior, and a few hours before). I had reservations at 7 but had to push it to 8:30 p (you try getting ten out-of-towners out of your apartment on a Saturday!) Not only were they accommodating, they gave me the best table in the house. A long, well placed table in the middle of the restaurant. I had a few guests arrive early and they were directed to the bar and were very well taken care of until I arrived.The waiters were kind and patient and were always around when we needed them. The food was great and the sushi was fresh. I've tried almost everything on the menu and can honestly say everything is pretty good. The drinks are great and although it's not a five-star restaurant, their service, ambiance and attention to your needs earned it a five-star rating from me. It's just nice enough but not over the top that you feel bad for your friends shelling out $50+ each. Everyone had a great time and enjoyed the food/drinks.Aside from my birthday dinner I order from here at work often and have come here on numerous other occasions (both locations).

The decor was modern and clubby, with dark lighting, loud music, and weird fake jellyfish in aquariums above the sushi bar. We were seated against the wall in the booth area which was a little disappointing because the cushions were all torn and busted up and the seat back was an odd shower-curtain-like cushion. The service was spotty and not particularly helpful, possibly because it was so loud inside that you couldn't hear them talking. I had a lychee martini which was quite tasty and true to the lychee flavor. We ordered some sushi and sashimi which was fresh as well as some dumplings which were like har-gao dim sum at a chinese restaurant. For my entree I had the chilean sea bass on a bed of saimin noodles which was tender, flaky,  and tasty, but didn't blow me away. My dining mates had the filet mignon which was juicy and the new york strip steak which was dry. My dining mates seemed to enjoy all their dishes though. For dessert we had the mango and lychee sorbets which had great flavor and texture. I wish I hadn't had so much to eat before, because I wanted to clean my ice cream bowl!

This is a great place to enjoy a light and delcious dinner before seeing a broadway show. The dessert is not reminescent of anything Japanese, but still good.",1,0,0,Gerard B.,"San Jose, CA",169,181,257
4.0,6/11/2008,"Great expensive sushi place.  Better than the typical place.  Fresh fish, very creative and tasty rolls, great service.  Its expensive and its kinda fancy in a hip modern kinda way, which makes it a great place to celebrate something, which is when i usually go there.  Recommended.",0,0,0,David S.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",439,258,302
5.0,5/4/2008,"We got seated immediately on a Friday before the dinner rush.Excellent food quality! This is the best sushi I've ever had. Everything was fresh and the portions are good for the pricing. We ordered the Mushroom and Shrimp Shumai and the King Crab Dumpling appetizers, which came out steaming hot. They were perfectly paired with soy dipping sauces. We enjoyed the Phoenix Roll, which had fresh spicy tuna and cucumber slices that you could smell in each bite. The Spider Roll was crunchy. We gorged ourselves in NYC so on our last night, my boyfriend and I split the wok seared tuna, which is cooked to order. We ordered it medium, which was my our own fault, too overcooked. Get Medium rare. The garlic sauce was tasty with the eggplant, zuchinni and yellow squash slices served under the tuna.Ahh! And dessert, how could I forget. The Lychee Sorbet was crisp and refreshing. The Fantasy dessert is a brownie crust, cheesecake-like base with specks of walnut throughout. It was worth the extra minutes at the gym.The atmosphere is tightly packed tables close to one another, tree branches adorned with white lights framing each section of tables. It's busy and private all at the same time.",1,0,0,EllaElla A.,"San Diego, CA",0,75,0
1.0,3/28/2008,"Haru ble. The sushi was rubbery and not nice at all. I sent back the fried calamari as it tasted like burger king cooked it in an old oil drum. Golum might like their raw fish but I would never go back. It's was way over priced, the food was not worth the trouble of walking in and I want that hour of my life back. The place looks nice, somewhat sylish, and its big, and its in the theatre district, and the staff is friendly, and service was quick, but you would be better off with a slice of Pizza from Ray's or a hotdog on the corner. Keep looking for sushi if you absolutely need you fish fix. Run Away - I rate it mediocre  to just ogre.",0,0,0,Jack K.,"San Francisco, CA",4,28,14

3.0,3/6/2008,"Made reservations for a weekday lunch here. Based on my experience here, I would recommend making reservations during the weekday. It was pretty busy with the lunch crowd. The service and wait time for the food to arrive at the table was good. The restaurant is nicely designed with that modern trendy feel and a pretty good looking waiter. Haha. I had one of their lunch specials but I think I've had better maki rolls elsewhere. I think the rice used in them was too soft and chewy. The fish used was good though. Overall, it's a good place for grub in this touristy spot!",1,0,1,Tracy L.,"Austin, TX",60,86,164
4.0,2/21/2008,"For the last 4 years this place has been my main staple and I didn't even realize it but I got there every year when I stay at the Westin across the street.Really good rolls, and pretty quick service.  It's a good place to eat in the Times Square when you are looking for something that is not a chain restaurant.",0,0,0,Amiee L.,"San Diego, CA",333,526,920
5.0,1/18/2008,"This is my favorite japanese restaurant in the city.  It's not somewhere I would go for a super special occasion, but it's a everyday japanese place with great rolls and super large pieces of fish!  Try to duck salad also, its great.",2,0,2,Paul L.,"New York, NY",1,6,0
5.0,1/17/2008,One of the best places in time square to eat.  Like other reviewers this place is dark and somewhat loud.  I love the kamakize Roll.  I do think the menu is not for beginners since nothing is described expect the very expensive roll.s,1,0,1,Robert M.,"Cincinnati, OH",62,477,7
2.0,1/2/2008,This sushi was good but personally it upsets me when the menu at sushi houses have the nigiri section in english only. Maybe that's because I secretly wish I spoke Japanese and enjoy the satisfaction that I can only read Japanese when it's featured on a menu. About the food: Very nice fish and I throughly enjoyed it. Great rolls...About the Ambiance: Very night club like = very dark and loud music....difficult to hear,0,0,1,Laura G.,"San Francisco, CA",141,197,5
3.0,6/24/2007,"Pricey but a good place to grab lunch if you're willing to spend $20-25. The calamari salad's one of my fave dishes, and the sushi is delish! Service is pretty good, and there's almost never a wait for table. The decor's modern and the location's extremely convenient if you work in/near Times Square. This is where you go when you want to find a place to avoid the tourists in the area.",0,0,0,Lynn T.,"New York, NY",234,149,94
3.0,5/21/2007,service = 4 starsfood = 2 starsambience = 1 staraverage 3 stars- - -many of my coworkers rave about haru - but maybe the sushi was the wrong thing to order for lunch -- the fish wasn't very fresh and the rice was kind of hard (tasted not freshly made).  it's really loud here and it's not a good place to go for a working lunch or a lunch where you are going to have substantial conversation.  the service is terrific though - i wish the food was on par.,0,0,0,Diana N.,"NY, NY",73,646,0
5.0,4/12/2007,"Been here many times and love the Miso Black Cod, which somehow is better than their Chilean Sea Bass.  Super fresh sashimi tastes awesome and I'd say it is one of the best Japanese places in the city.One more secret: Trying to make reservations at other restaurants the day of a Broadway show really sucks.  BUT I always seem to be able to get in here.  So if you need a great place to eat before a show, this is it.Oh, and the mango and green tea mochi dessert is awesome...",0,0,0,David S.,"Cupertino, CA",16,37,0
4.0,4/10/2007,"The spicy salmon roll was amazing. I want to go back right now and order eight more rolls  for dinner tonight :) Pretty decor and not super crowded, which was nice. Haru is the perfect place to meet a friend for a drink or dinner. Good service, nice selection of sushi and wine - and a great place to eat if you're in Times Square - pre theater, or just to get away from all of the crazy tourists.",1,0,3,meagan m.,"New York, NY",112,188,0
2.0,3/18/2007,"You pay for the atmosphere, not the food.  The pieces of sushi are small, expensive, and pretty bland.  The nigiri was overpriced and the soft sell crab in the spider roll (which cost $15 by the way) was soggy, not crispy like it should be.Maybe these prices are standard in NYC, but in California, you can get a lot more (quantity, quality, and decent atmosphere) for the same price.",1,2,0,Peter D.,"San Francisco, CA",324,29,0
4.0,3/3/2007,Great dining. Vegetarian dining there is a bit hard but there are veggie sushi options which are delicious. Eat at the sushi bar and look up. You'll see old japanese newspapers. A nice little perk.,0,0,0,Jack S.,"Dallas, TX",0,55,0
3.0,2/25/2007,"It's my confession..  I was addicted the internet game... 'World of Warcraft', and could play whole day long...  have several highest level characters...  one of them.. is 'Harumi' and u can find this name on the menu in Haru..  =)2005, I came to NYC for US Open tennis game w/ my friend, we had some free time, like other visitors, we prowled around the time square.  If u read some of my reviews, u could notice... I have to eat, whenever I feel like..  I was so excited w/ the restaurant name..   of course i took a pics, but unfortunately, it's gone..  =(the deco was unique, but can't tell food is awesome..  but u know... i have to go there for my Harumi.. someday..  tip: same sound, different meaning..in Korean, 'haru' is 'a day,' and in Japanese, 'spring.'",4,3,6,Julie K.,"New York, NY",224,418,883
2.0,1/27/2007,"ehhh. haru is kind of a fun place; the decor is really pretty and its a good place to go with a group just to socialize, but overall, the drinks and food are generally not that good. everything kind of just tastes sub-par and bland. i went here with a group of 7 other people, and i was the one who decided where we were going to eat, and after we left everyone hated it. haha. its worth checking out once to see what you think, but you may not want to go back. one thing i should note is that i haven't tried their sushi, so that may be okay, but their entrees are not good.",1,0,1,Ivory A.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,56,0
5.0,12/8/2006,"I normally am a bit of a lower east side snob, but my best friend got a new job, and we went out to celebrate, and thus, I agreed to make trek to midtown.And so, my relationship with Haru began.Apparently, Thursday night at 6 pm is a hot time at Haru, and there were no tables if you didn't have a reservation, so we were seated at the sushi bar...which, to them, was a consolation prize, but to me, major bonus. (We got to watch the men ""cook""!) We shared a king crab steamed dumpling appetizer and a mixed green salad with ginger sauce (both, sublime), then had our rolls - I had rock shrimp and avocado (which, is pretty much what I always get) and Shari had the shrimp tempura roll - both, delicious. And, as for cocktails...get ready...yiou know it's coming....Lycheetini!Yes, double the price of those at Verlaines or Cooper 35, but yummy and large and a perfect compliment to my meal.Haru is a little pricey, so it's only for those special occassions, but a wonderful culinary experience, no doubt.",1,1,1,Aly W.,"Brooklyn, NY",390,261,0
4.0,11/26/2006,"Just make sure you get your rolls inside out...This was nice, we had to find something close so we popped in at the request of one of our party.  Everything was good and the only thing I can suggest is to say what my friend said (if your buying) ""Get what you want but you can't have mine"" and if you can, get someone else to buy.that is the worst thing to say because his looked AMAZING!",1,0,1,Tricia M.,"Saint Charles, MO",4,99,1

5.0,10/22/2006,"With its close proximity to Times Square, I expected this place to be loud and packed with tourists. Haru Broadway is, instead, a quiet, lovely hideaway in the busiest part of the city! It has a beautiful, dim-lit (but not too dim) atmosphere, where simulated trees surrounding the dining area are lit up with white twinkling lights. Service is excellent, and the food comes in a very timely fashion--however I didn't feel rushed. It is definitely a good spot for a date. The fish is fresh-tasting, and the ""Sumo"" and ""Kabuki"" combination platters are both very good!",3,0,2,Allison G.,"Brooklyn, NY",247,356,10
4.0,10/21/2006,"One of two sushi places I stopped at while in NYC. Liked the ambience a lot, very minimilast eastern chic, with birch branches lining the walls and aisles and great lighting.I had beef roll appetizer which was very good, and two sushi rolls (spicy tuna and tempura shrimp) which were both B+ or so. The Haru-politan, their signature drink, is great!",1,0,1,Kathleen C.,"Glen Ellyn, IL",85,206,0
4.0,9/17/2006,"I wasn't expecting much as this was recommended by the concierge of the hotel I was staying at in Times Square. I have been burned by concierge recommendations in the past (flashback: Ritz-Carlton, Philadelphia, sushi restaurant) but considering I was starving, craving sushi and it was close, I was willing to give it a go.  I went there in a nice shirt and jeans - felt totally welcome and comfortable there. The food was unbelieveable. Postively the best sushi I have had in a while. It was super fresh, had great presentation, came out fast, and the roll combinations were incredibly good. I would recommend trying the Wasabi roll and the Chef's roll. The toro sashimi melted in your mouth. Prices were average and service was efficient.  I will definitely come back.",1,0,1,Stephanie I.,"San Francisco, CA",69,160,24
5.0,8/14/2006,"There are many places I miss now that I'm not in NYC anymore, and Haru is the first on my list. I often think about it when I'm hungry, craving a spicy salmon roll, or am just plain nostalgic. Haru's great prices, competent service and beautiful decor make it one of the best places to enjoy good food and good company. The sushi in this finely decorated Japanese restaurant is so amazing, my mouth is watering at the thought. And because I like the outfit I'm wearing today and don't want to drool all over it, I'm going to cut this short and only use one word for my precious Haru: phenomenal.",4,0,2,Natalia M.,"Park Slope, Brooklyn, NY",240,178,36
4.0,6/8/2006,"Interesting tidbit...""haru"" is Japanese for ""spring,"" as in the season... There definitely was a unique dcor that lavished this restaurant that is eye-catching and leaves some confusion too, stuff you can talk about if and when a conversation goes dry. The menu featured a wide-variety of choices, for the most part, there's something for almost everyone. The ambiance is mixed. You can have a intimate meal there or you can go with a big group of people, there's sections of the restaurant that cater to either. Whether you want to eat inside or outside, those are choices as well. Service was speedy, courteous, and attentive. Prices are typical of midtown Manhattan restaurants. I recommend the Salmon Tar Tar appetizer and the Teriyaki Steak, it's simply delicious... Try the martinis too; they are well sized and guaranteed to leave you feeling ""good"" for some time.",1,0,1,Forrest W.,"New York, NY",21,19,459

4.0,2/15/2006,"Went to this place as a third wheel for a non overly romantic dinner. Food was great. My dinner companions ordered non sushi meals and loved them. I ordered Sushi and was told about five times that it was raw. I know this is a touristy area but come on, i know what i'm ordering. Anyway, the service was good and the food was too. the two drawbacks were that the california roll was made with imitation crab meat and that when my sister asked for the rest of her chicken teryaki in a to go box they said ok but threw it away anyway. I will def, give it a second shot.",1,2,1,angela g.,"New York, NY",234,332,10

The Japanese fusion food is delicious, from the perfect portions of edamame to start to the tiramisu and cappucino at the end, and not overly pricy (dinner for two was $86, including drinks, appetizers, entrees, and dessert). Try the girlie drinks, too--specifically the Red Dragon and the Empress of the Sun.",3,0,1,Michele W.,"Los Angeles, CA",153,309,0
