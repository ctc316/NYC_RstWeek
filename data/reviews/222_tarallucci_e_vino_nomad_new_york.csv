5.0,3/23/2019,My daughter treated me to dinner here during my trip to NYC. The food is absolutely amazing and the bartender is an artist with his signature drinks.

Our bartender, Al, made the most spectacular drinks with such gorgeous presentation. i got the octopus appetizer (pictured) which was phenomenal! It had a delicious wasabi sauce that was not too overpowering which I've found happens often with wasabi sauces, but their chef made it perfectly. For the entree, I got the wild mushroom pasta which was also to die for! For desert, I did the chocolate mousse cake which was beautifully plated but looked too delicious to waste time taking pictures-- I dove right in, so so delicious! I can't wait to come back!

More recently we went out the last day of winter restaurant week. After seeing their menu was different than the normal offerings, I had to try it! Staff was very kind and was quick to make recommendations. I had the meatballs as an appetizer and then the butternut squash ravioli for a main course. Both were AMAZING and I have been crazing them since. Unfortunately I do not thin the Ravioli is on the regular menu. For dessert we had a lemon tart, also delicious.

My friend got there a moment before me order an appetizer.I got there 45 minutes for their happy hour appetizer supposed to and end they told me no more appetizers at all and there was no sign. I think this is very bad service. We asked the manager to come over and when she came over she said oh yes it's her fault she dropped the ball. But next year she would not drop the ball on Valentine's Day.

3.0,11/10/2018,"Went here with 2 friends for dinner after a show. In short nice place with a nice ambiance, mediocre food. We started with calamari, burrata and a selection of crostini - all were tasty nothing to write home about. For mains I had the Cacio e Pepe: another straight 3 it was decent - nothing spectacular, I could easily make it at home. One of my friends had the scallops (good it seemed - small portion he joked he'd be eating McDonald's after) and another friend had the duck which was also decent.

1.0,10/8/2018,"I came here for brunch with my sister on a whim because she only notified that she would be in town the night before.  We mostly opted for this place due to the location and honestly did not know what to expect.  Upon arrival, we were the only people there despite it being about noon.  The first thing I ordered was coffee and was pleased to find that the cappuccino was quite good!For my main, I opted for the Uova e Polenta ($14) which was decent.  Overall, it was not bad.  I was unimpressed with the amount of food and the way how the polenta was presented.  We all came in starving yet the portion is miniscule.  The eggs weren't even runny which, for some reason, I had expected.  It was cooked well-done.  The polenta came in these two round shapes and that was it.  That was basically just two bites.  TWO.  For me, the best part of the dish was the mushrooms.  Those were supremely tasty albeit a bit on the salty side.  Afterwards, I left still feeling quite hungry. My sister and her friend opted for the Uova e Salmone ($14).  They both seemed to really enjoy it even though my sister's friend's dish had kale in it despite specifically telling the waitress NOT to put that in.  Clearly, she did not listen.  Thankfully she wasn't allergic otherwise that would've been a huge situation.  And unlike my dish, their eggs were runny as seen in the photo.  I was quite jealous of that and honestly, I'm still not sure why mine were essentially well-done and theirs were runny.  Oh well.  My sister and I also decided to share the Patate ($5) which were essentially fries.  These were actually the highlight of the meal for me because they were delicious. My sister requested some ketchup on the side but for some reason, the restaurant didn't have any.  Honestly, I found that extremely odd because ketchup just seems to be such a staple in most restaurants.  Overall, I wouldn't go back to this place.  The food was subpar (at least for my dish - the rest was just okay) and the service was basically nonexistent.  At one point, my sister had to get up and find the waitress because there weren't anyone around. And when she finally did manage to reach a waitress, the waitress took forever to get back to us.  Maybe because it was a slow Sunday morning but regardless, it was not the best experience.",0,1,0,Stefany W.,"Manhattan, NY",202,214,33
1.0,9/24/2018,"This place is a hit. I tried. Twice. I don't think my experience will get any better. The first time I came w a friend during restaurant week. Our waitress sampled us two wines. A cheaper one and a more expensive one. We opted w the most expensive one. She seemed surprised and actually double checked with us to see if she heard right. My friend and I were a bit bothered but continued to stay. Don't remember the food but I guess it was OK. Waitress was nice throughout the night. Second time, by myself, and the food came out warm/cold. Like it was sitting for a while. It doesn't take long to make pasta and it was empty there. It was me and one other table. And my food still came to me coldish. I was on my lunch break so no time to send food back, plus I was already super late (my one hr lunch break turned into 1.5 to 2 hrs, yo!) So I ate the coldish pasta. Telling myself, I tried, but NEVER again. She was friendly though.

The fish was served with fennel and lemon and was delightful. The pasta was also excellent! It had fava beans and pancetta and was so very good! I enjoyed a spritz and a glass of wine with my dinner.

Octopus appetizer is a must! I enjoyed my Cappellacci di Vitello but wish the portion was bigger, as did everyone else with their meal. The waitress described the special as a hanger steak, but when it got to our table, it was really well done and shredded(even when my fiancé  requested medium rare). When he told them it was overcooked, they explained that it was cooked in the Worcester marinade like a stir fry,so it wasn't made like a regular steak.

From the decor, to the food, to the service this place really impresses. I'm definitely recommending it if you're on the hunt for an authentic Italian restaurant in NoMad.My friend and I arrived around 8:30 PM on a Thursday evening. The restaurant itself is located next to a apartment building and it itself is located in a pretty modern building as well. Walking in I was surprised with how empty it was, but I'm assuming it may have just been the day and/or the time.My friend and I both ordered drinks to start and after checking in on Yelp at the location I was surprised to get a notification for a free glass of prosecco! A nice surprise to expect if you remember to check in ;)When it came time to order I ended up going with the Gnocchi ($22) which was beautifully presented with a blend of speck, walnuts, and Gorgonzola. It also tasted as good as it looked!The service was also impeccable. My friend and I took longer than usual to decide what we wanted to order and our server was extremely accommodating with us. He would come back occasionally asking if we had decided what we wanted and also was able to answer multiple questions we had before we finally decided to order. A+ to the team they have there.Overall a wonderful night made possible by the quality of the experience I had here.

I was disappointed that they ran out of tiramisu for dessert so early that they were able to tell us that by 8:15 for our 8pm reservation. The flourless chocolate cake was good but very dense as expected. Ice cream was good too but just ice cream. This was definitely the heaviest restaurant week menu I've ever had but good. I'd probably go back again and hope they still have the dessert I want! Service was a bit slow as the night went on.

Food is excellent and fresh, service is top notch, cocktails are yummy but my favorite thing is the honey filled croissant paired with a cappuccino. If you come here for dinner expect to pay $50 more or less for dinner w a desert and a cocktail, it's totally worth it though. Pro tip: that croissant I mentioned or some lobster ravioli.",0,0,1,Cesar I.,"Manhattan, NY",599,116,293

3.0,12/12/2017,"Taralluci is very cute and quaint, and the servers were attentive and friendly but the food was a definite hit or miss.I loved my latte, and my companion loved his omelet with the arugula salad and side of bacon. However, I ordered a bombolini and the frittata alla norcina and was entirely disappointed.The bombolini was way too dense, and while I am typically an endless void that will put away anything on my plate, I just didn't find it at all appealing. The cream inside was great, so I ate the cream and left the rest.The sausage inside the frittata was great, but the entire thing was severely underseasoned- there was a sprinkling of black pepper over top, but there was no salt or pepper inside. The potatoes and eggs both really need to be seasoned separately and then added together before cooking...

3.0,11/8/2017,"I hate to say this...I wouldn't expect this place to be a solid 4 stars. Honestly, I thought about giving it two stars, but maybe I just went at a bad time and ate the wrong food. Ever since my sister moved to midtown, we don't go to the villages as much because we want to explore the more nearby areas. When we found this restaurant that was highly rated (4 stars), had a lovely ambiance from the pics, and good review, we were excited to give it a try! I have to say that after the meal, we (my sister, friend, and I) weren't extremely delighted and were somewhat disappointed. My friend and I had the 2-course lunch prefixe with the bruschetta as a starter and seared cod as the entree, but my friend changed the bruschetta to soup because she later found out there was meat on the bruschetta, and she doesn't eat meat. The bruschetta was all right. It wasn't bad but nothing memorable. Upon finishing the appetizer, we waited a longggggg time for the entree...we really thought they forgot to put our orders in. Finally, when our food came, we were so ready and excited to dig in! Our cod smelled very fishy, and that was the first thing my sister said when it came. I thought it was okay cause sometimes it smells fishy but tastes fine. The first few bites were fine cause we were starving! But the fishiness built up and I couldn't handle it anymore. I think I only fished half of it and picked on my sister's duck ragu pappardelle, which tasted much better. Still, good Italian restaurants and pasta places are everywhere in NYC...The food and service were kind of disappointing, the ambiance was very nice and comfortable. They also have a great wine collection. FYI, I went on a weekday for lunch...I would recommend you not to go then. Maybe try their brunch?",2,0,2,Fiona L.,"New Brunswick, NJ",422,353,1619

Nice list of cocktail options as well. The menu lacked variety so we just did a glass of wine and a couple of apps. I think to go here and NOT have a taste for Italian will make choosing a dish hard. It would be a great spot for dates -- was dark, candle lit, intimate. We wanted to sit outside because the inside table seating was a bit too tight for us but it was also too cold outside so we sat at the bar which wasn't bad at all but suggestion: get heat lamps for the outside seating.

The pieces of potatoes and sausage in the frittata were good but the overall egg parts were dry and tasteless.

5.0,7/13/2017,"First off this was probably the best service I have received in a very long time, if not best ever. My friend and I were walking around indecisive and happened to see it. We were immediately greeted by (we later realized) the manager, and when we got the table he told our server to give us the VIP treatment and we got nothing short of that -before we placed a drink order we received a round of complementary prosecco. However the highlight was our server Matias who continuously surprised me with his knowledge throughout the night. We told him our likes and dislikes and  let him run with it from there, and were not disappointed at all. The grilled octopus was one of the first dishes and stands out because well it's not your every day dish, but the texture and taste were wonderful. Later on he brought out the ravioli which was phenomenal. The presentation was lovely which won me over immediately, after tasting it I was simply at a loss for words. The sauce was delicious and the cheese from the ravioli melted in your mouth. Matias also brought out a glass of red at that point which really complimented the dish. Throughout the night Matias checked on us, and was so friendly he felt more like a companion at the table rather than some one serving us which is refreshing. Might I add we came in cutting it close to kitchen closing time but not once did he make us feel pressured or rushed. I will definitely be returning soon, and would recommend this place to anyone!",0,0,0,Karina V.,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",184,3,1

The olive oil they gave us with the variety of app bread was fruity and bright and it made me happy!Only comment is that the staff was so large that they kept coming up to us and to ask the same questions. Like, I already told 2 waiters and probably the manager I was ok.. please let me eat! Haha Also, the assigned waiter treated us like we never ate at a restaurant before. We said we wanted the prefixe.. he said ok have you ever ordered from a prefixe.. we said yes.. and then he tells us how to order and that we must order one item from the app entree and dessert. I'm like ok, I understand. Then he goes on about how I cant order 2 from the same section. I'm like ok yes I understand. It went on for a while. Like he gave us examples of how ppl order.. just went on and on and on.. I'm not sayin, it was because we were Asian but I felt like maybe he assumed we couldn't speak English. I don't know.. I think I speak perfect English and when I say I understand what a prefixe is, he doesn't have to teach us for 10 mins about how to order. My goodness He walked away after we ordered.

5.0,5/24/2017,"Met a friend here for brunch one weekend morning. We were trying to go somewhere else for brunch but it turned out to be way too crowded, so a quick Yelp search turned up this newly opened place. The restaurant was completely empty save us and a large family that was just finishing up brunch. It's a beautiful place, with tall wooden walls and windows looking into a small garden of sorts in the middle of a group of buildings. Wine bottles were stacked up tall within the walls, which we later discovered to be sliding doors to wine racks housing different wines! It was brunch time though, so it didn't seem appropriate to be drinking that early in the day but I would totally otherwise had a glass or two. I got the breakfast bacon and egg sandwich (per the waitress' recommendation) with a side of home fries, while he got a quiche and a side salad. The food came out quickly (we were the only ones there after all), and we ate. The occasion of my friend and I's meet up was sad, but the food was good and we cheered up considerably after our meal. They also offer an unlimited mimosa option that my friend considered heavily, but thought better as we both had long days to go. Instead, he got a latte with an almond croissant as dessert - the almond croissant was so good, baked supposedly locally in the city. Latte was good as well. Will be back to try the wines!!

4.0,5/15/2017,"I'm rating this for brunch. It was on the pricier side for brunch in NYC and the portions were not large, so if you are super hungry - this is not the place to go. But they had outdoor seating and a lot of it...so that's quite rare in NYC. I got a breakfast sandwich and it came with potatoes (so so good). I also got a really good cappuccino (highly recommend) but it was tiny so I would go for a coffee if I went back again. Everyone at my table got different things that all looked tasty, but again was small. The service definitely added to me giving it 4 stars as we had a dog with us and they were very accomodating. The food did come out about 45 minutes after we sat down so if you were looking for a quick brunch, this isnt the place.

The issue here is they have clearly downgraded their wait staff. I've been three times in the past two weeks and had the same waiter each time. He's is by far the most miserable waiter I've ever encounter. Not accommodating, impatient and rude. The hostess was all distracted all three times and we ended up just seating ourselves one of the times. Another time she was on her cell phone.

The drink menu is robust, but with limited by-the-glass options for wine.

1.0,5/1/2017,"I will go straight to the point and give this place one star! I have to be fair and applaud the great service however I didn't come here for service but for the food as we all do. This restaurant chain serves abysmal italian food. I opted for one of their pasta dishes called Cacio e Pepe, which is a Roman inspired repertoire. How can they mess up a dish that's simply based from pecorino cheese and coarsely ground pepper? I saw and tasted ample amount of ground pepper however I never tasted any pecorino cheese. It tasted as though they just mixed ground pepper and hot water with the pasta. I didn't expect their Cacio e Pepe to taste like the one I had in Felice Rome but they can at least try to make it enticing to the palate. The salmon panini we ordered isn't quite what we expected. The very salty smoked salmon was slapped in regular slices of over toasted bread. If you are in search of an Italian resto, choose one that serves authentic Italian cuisine and don't settle for this resto who just claims to serve Italian cuisine when there is no solid dish in their menu that is a traditional cuisine.

We arrived around 10:30AM, and the place was pretty empty. We were seated instantly. My friend loved their flat white - they use Lavazza Italian coffee beans I believe. I've tried their cappucino at the East Village location and it tasted just like the cappucinos I would have during my time abroad in Florence! I tried the grapefruit juice, which I swear is just a straight up grapefruit squeezed into a glass. It tasted so fresh and refreshing. For food, my friend and I decided to split the Frittata and the prosciutto and egg sandwich. Both were very good! I particularly loved the Frittata, which had potatoes and sausage with a hint of truffle oil. I could barely taste the truffle oil, so I wish the truffle was a little stronger in my opinion. But, it was still very delicious and filling! The two of us had a hard time finishing both plates. I think the prosciutto and egg sandwich was pretty good, but I'm not sure if I would order this again if I returned. The frittata was definitely the winner for me. Having been to the EV location and to the NoMad location, I think I can safely say that I am a fan of the Tarallucci e Vino chain. Also, check in and use 10% off your check!

I am majority Italian and this is probably the best I have ever had (and side note: I live in manhattan and crushed a lot of the little Italy restaurants)! This place is too great for a date or a group setting. Management was super accommodating and nice for my friend's bday and spotted the cake (they even asked what type of cake she liked!). We will be back!",2,1,1,Kara M.,"Manhattan, NY",224,33,13
5.0,10/9/2016,"Tarallucci is my favorite restaurant in New York. They have five locations in the city, and they're all fantastic. The food is unbelievable, genuine Italian. My favorite aspect of the place though is the staff--so kind, attentive, and warm. They treat you like family. Five stars! Buonissimo!",1,0,0,Brianna S.,"Manhattan, NY",1,12,0
5.0,9/10/2016,"I can honestly say that I haven't had Italian food this fresh and delicious since...Italy!! From a scale of Olive Garden to Eataly, this definitely falls on the latter end of the spectrum. Food-wise, you can expect fresh ingredients and authentic flavors; experience-wise, you expect attentive service and a classy ambience. Let's talk about the food first. I came here with my coworkers for drinks and appetizers. We ordered the meatballs, shishito peppers, and mozzarella sticks. Everything was superb, but the winner by consensus was the mozzarella sticks. The cheese- oh boy! So fresh that you wonder how many hours it's been since it was still sitting in the cow's udder as milk. Fried perfectly to a crisp, it's not too greasy and just the right amount of breading. We got bottles of rose to share. I don't remember which one it was but I can tell you that it was dangerously good. I'm not a wine expert so I can't comment on the body or the aroma, but all I can say is that for someone who usually can't discern between a $10 bottle of traders joe's wine and a 10 year old wine from Bordeaux, I knew this wine was $$$!!Onto service- it was fantastic. Our server was very attentive and friendly. Upon searing he greeted us warmly and tried to make conversation. He made sure that we never had an empty glass. Being so close to my office, my coworkers and I may have just found a new hang out spot after work. I would recommend this place to anyone who's looking for authentic Italian food and an extensive wine list.",1,0,0,Leona C.,"Greenwich Village, Manhattan, NY",73,13,11
5.0,9/7/2016,"Who: Flatiron residents, tinder dates & Gansevoort guestsWhat: Food- Contemporary Italian food, food comes in manageable portions (you do NOT eat until you hurt as you would at The Palm)Drinks - Nice selection of wine and cocktails. Bar seating full of tipsy tinder dates. When: I went here for dinner, but I could see this being a great place to grab happy hour drinks or come to lunchWhere: East side of 28th street (outdoor seating caters nicely to those who like to people watch)Why: Simple Italian food in a very contemporary setting. The noise level is low.",21,11,17,Courtney D.,"New York, NY",666,88,692
5.0,8/24/2016,"This location is close to my office, so I've had lunch here (last week - 8/18) and I also attended a baby shower here for a coworker (this morning - 8/24). Both experiences have been wonderful, with attentive and personalized service, as well as incredibly fresh food. A member of our party is gluten free and Carlotta helped ensure that her needs were met. For the baby shower, Tarallucci created a personalized menu for our party of 20 and arranged these alongside the place settings. Fresh chocolate and apricot croissants were offered (do not skip these - they rival those from the French bakery I worked in during college) with bold coffee and orange juice and then each member of the party chose from three options: (1) two eggs sunny-side up with pancetta, toast and tomatoes, (2) french toast with rum and walnuts, (3) vegetable quiche with greens. The veggie quiche had mushrooms, onions, and peppers and was a miniature pie, rather than a slice, and tasted wonderful. When I went for lunch, I ordered the bone-in chicken with chili and green olives. It takes 20 minutes to make from scratch, and is well worth the prep time. Our server was engaging and very knowledgeable about the menu. I am presently craving the chicken and will be back again soon!",2,0,0,Jackie K.,"Manhattan, NY",268,21,41
5.0,8/23/2016,"Amazing food and excellent service! I went with a friend for dinner and we started with great priced happy hour drinks - glasses of nice Italian wine for $6 each. We started with some aperitivo dishes, then the burrata for antipasto (which was delicious!) and then the agnolotti with mushrooms, hazelnuts, and lemon. Everything was so tasty, fresh, and authentically Italian. Service was great - the host and our server were incredibly attentive.I am very happy that this new location opened up in my neighborhood. I will definitely be returning!",2,0,0,Alyssa C.,"Rockaway Park, Queens, NY",0,11,0
